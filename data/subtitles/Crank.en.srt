1
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,400
Hector, are we spinning yet?
Nice.

2
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,900
Chelios! How we doing, baby?
And you never call me no more.

3
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,700
Come on, what is that?
Where's the love?

4
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
How are you feeling?

5
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,100
I guess you're feeling like
shit, right about now.

6
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Now you can't..

7
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,500
You can't move too good, huh?

8
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,600
You can't breathe too good.
What's wrong with you?

9
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What is this?

10
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,500
Oh, fuck!

11
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,700
Can you guess what this is?
I bet you can, Chelios.

12
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,100
Hold on, check this out.

13
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh! This is plain sick, man!

14
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,200
I must be the motherfucking
genius of sick!

15
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,799
Poison Chev Chelios
in his sleep?

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
That's like some
Shakespeare or some shit.

17
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,399
You knocked this dude
out pretty good!

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
About to get you a spot
on the Dodgers, son.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Maybe you don't understand
what just happened.

20
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,900
I just fucking killed you.

21
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,900
Try not to embarrass yourself
because you're on 'Candid Camera'!

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,100
This shit here I gave you!
This is some..

23
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,200
high-tech, sci-fi, Chinese
synthetic bullshit!

24
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I don't exactly know
what's in this shit, dude!

25
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,900
All I know is that once this shit
has binded with your blood cells,

26
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,800
you're fucked, baby, and
believe me it's binded.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,400
Yeah, you got yourself about
an hour, max. Tick-tock.

28
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,300
This shit has been real.

29
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,600
You probably should've thought
twice before you whacked Don Kim.

30
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,600
Experiencing a little
20/20 hindsight?

31
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,500
You know what? Thought so.

32
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,400
Now, you have yourself
a nice death.

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Asshole!

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,400
You like that, huh? Home run!

35
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,500
<i>It's Eve. I'm glad you
called, but I'm not here.</i>

36
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,299
<i>Leave a message,
unless you're selling</i>

37
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
<i>something 'cause I'm
not interested.</i>

38
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,900
<i>If you're not, then just..
Wait, time's up.</i>

39
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,500
Get a cell phone, honey. Please?

40
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,200
Come on.

41
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
Come on, come on.

42
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,300
- Dr, Miles office, may I help you?
- Yeah, let me speak to him.

43
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,900
<i>I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in.
May I take a message?</i>

44
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,500
- Where is he?
- I beg your pardon, sir?

45
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,400
Where the fuck is he?

46
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
No.. yeah! Wow!

47
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
Where you from?

48
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,500
I don't know, sir. This
is his answering service.

49
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,800
<i>- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Would you like me to page him?</i>

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,200
Yeah, fine.

51
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Please let the doctor know that
Chev Chelios is a dead man,

52
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
- if he can't call me back within the hour.
- Could you spell that?

53
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,100
- Yeah, D-E-A-D! Chelios.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,000
Thank you.

55
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,200
- Hello.
- Kaylo, where were you last night?

56
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,000
- What's up, Chev?
- I said, where were you last night?

57
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,300
I..

58
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,700
- You want to know what I was doing?
- What?

59
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
- Getting killed, you plum.
- What?

60
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,600
Yeah, you heard me.
Ricky fuckin' Verona..

61
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,600
- Ricky Verona?
- Who thought..

62
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,200
that little bitch had the stones
to wet me in my own crib?

63
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,099
- I mean, it's inconceivable.
Yet, here we are.

64
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,000
Where are we?

65
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,999
I'm dead and you're simple.
Now listen to me.

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
Put the word out I'm
looking for Verona.

67
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,800
- Anyone sees him you call me, understand?
- I..

68
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,700
I'm gonna get that fucker if
it's the last thing I do.

69
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
It may actually be the last thing I do.
You understand that?

70
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
- Ricky Verona.
- Copy me on that Kaylo?

71
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,500
Find him!

72
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,700
- Hey, man!
- What the fuck you doing?

73
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,538
What the fuck you doing?
Where am I going?

74
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,200
Fuck you!

75
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,900
Bathroom don't work.
What you doing?

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,100
- Yo, Chevy..
- Where's Verona?

77
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,700
- Talk!
- What about?

78
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,600
- Don't fuck with me!
- I'm not! Just calm down!

79
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
Don't tell me to calm down!

80
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,600
- Fuck, man!
- Orlando? You all right?

81
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,799
Hey, there's a white nigger
with a gun up in here!

82
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,700
Just be still, motherfuckers!

83
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,800
You see that? I'm trying
to help you here, man.

84
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
I gotta find Ricky Verona.

85
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,500
- Why would I know where Verona is?
- Yeah, yeah.

86
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,100
You don't know, but
you're gonna tell me.

87
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Or I'm gonna blow your brains
into the fuckin' toilet!

88
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

89
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,600
Whoa! Put your guns down!
The white man is cool!

90
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,300
The white man is.. The
white man is cool!

91
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,500
Y'all like them Somalia niggers.

92
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,300
Now look, Chevy came here
to discuss something.

93
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,700
We gonna discuss this shit in
a civilized manner. Chevy?

94
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,900
- You had a question? Or a point to make?
- Where's Verona?

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Okay, I'm not affiliated
with Ricky Verona.

96
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,400
You pulled the Anselmo job together.
Don't fuckin' bullshit me!

97
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,100
Easy! Easy! Easy!

98
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,300
All right?

99
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,788
Look, you're operating
under a false pretence.

100
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,900
Ricky and I did not pull..

101
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,700
the Anslemo job together. Ricky
fucked me on the Anselmo job.

102
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,600
In fact, Ricky Verona
still owes me $7,5000.

103
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,700
- Not how I heard it.
- But that's the way it is.

104
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,100
So, you see, I don't know
where Verona is. If I did,

105
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,200
I'd probably be there right now,
beating the Gucci off his ass.

106
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,400
All right.

107
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
All right.

108
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,900
That's what I'm talking about.
That's almost civilized.

109
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,300
Shit, dude. What's
wrong with you?

110
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,599
- Just give me some coke.
You got any coke?

111
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,300
Now you're gonna insult me.

112
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,100
Come on, I don't have time!

113
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,900
Just give me something.

114
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,300
- I'm really dying, here.
- I can see that.

115
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,400
I'm really fucking dying!

116
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,700
- You saying this is medicinal -use coke?
- That's right.

117
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,800
Well?

118
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,500
- What?
- This shit ain't free, nigger.

119
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,100
That's enough.

120
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,500
What, you gonna do the shit right here?
Chevy, come on, man!

121
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,200
Oh, God!

122
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,400
Chevy..

123
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,900
Oh! What the..

124
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,400
- Oh, that's good. That's good.
- That's good, right?

125
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,500
Why you looking for
Verona, anyway?

126
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,700
Some Chinese assholes
hired him to kill me.

127
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
- This is about Don Kim.
- What do you know about it?

128
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,900
- I know you pulled the trigger.
- Of course, I pulled the trigger.

129
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,900
Why wouldn't I pull
the fuckin' trigger?

130
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,800
Whoa.. Yo, Chelios, you good?

131
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
- This shit ain't working.
- Excuse me?

132
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,600
I know what I have to do.

133
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Well, shit. A man's got to
do what a man's got to do.

134
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,300
- What is it you gotta do?
- I gotta kick some black ass.

135
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

136
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,600
- Shit!
- There he goes again.

137
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,400
Who wants white meat?

138
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,400
You ain't got shit,
motherfucker!

139
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,600
- Put that fuckin' twig down, bitch!
- Faggot!

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

141
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,800
<i>- Doc?
- What's up, Doc?</i>

142
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
- You motherfucker!
- Why aren't you dead yet?

143
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,300
<i>- What the fuck you doing?
- Coming for you.</i>

144
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
- Fucking believe me.
- Whatever.

145
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll be waiting, but
you won't make it.

146
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,099
You should know that I'm
all about hooking up

147
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,700
with that mystery girl,
you've been banging.

148
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,899
<i>Soon as you're underground.</i>

149
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,700
<i>I forgot to say so on that
gay James Bond tape I left.</i>

150
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,188
What, and then you're gonna
rape my grandmother?

151
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,500
Bla, bla, fuckin' bla.

152
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,599
You listen to me.

153
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,300
What do you think Carlito will do
when he finds out what you did?

154
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,300
<i>Your whole crew is history!</i>

155
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,400
<i>- Driver, pull over!
- Fuck!</i>

156
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,700
Great.

157
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,300
<i>You talking about Carlito? Because
me and Carlito, we're boys now.</i>

158
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,500
We're tight.

159
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,700
Tight, like when your brother
fucked you in 3rd grade?

160
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,400
That's snappy. But I did you
pretty good, didn't I Chelios?

161
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,900
<i>- Admit it.
- We'll see.</i>

162
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,200
<i>Pull over!</i>

163
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,600
- Know what the best part is?
- Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

164
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
- Yeah.
- Doctor Miles.

165
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
<i>Fuck! What took you so long?
Jesus Christ.</i>

166
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,599
<i>- Sorry, Chevy, I
just got the message.</i>

167
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
- Okay. Forget it.
Listen, I'm dying!

168
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,800
I've been poisoned with some
Chinese synthetic shit.

169
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,800
<i>- What?
- You've gotta fucking do something for me.</i>

170
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,000
<i>- What are your symptoms?
- It's like I'm slowing down.</i>

171
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>- Stuck in tar.
- Blurred vision?</i>

172
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,900
<i>- Yeah.
- Dizzy?</i>

173
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,300
<i>- Sure.
- Any pain in your chest?</i>

174
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,600
Not really. I feel
good, right now.

175
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,900
- What are you doing?
- Driving through a mall, cops chasing me.

176
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,800
The adrenaline is what's
keeping you alive.

177
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,799
<i>- Having a little trouble
hearing you, Doc.</i>

178
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,700
<i>You got to keep moving, Chevy.</i>

179
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Explain.

180
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,200
If I'm right, they gave
you the Beijing cocktail.

181
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,100
<i>It's very nasty shit.</i>

182
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,500
<i>It works on the adrenal
gland, blocks it's receptors.</i>

183
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,999
<i>The only thing you can
do to slow it down,</i>

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,500
<i>is to keep the flow of
adrenaline constant.</i>

185
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Meaning, if you stop, you die.

186
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,500
Hang on.

187
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
<i>Jesus! What..</i>

188
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,900
<i>Are you there? Are you okay?</i>

189
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,800
<i>- What'd you say, Doc?
- If you stop, you die!</i>

190
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,400
That's what I'm trying to do. Keep
moving, keep the blood pumping.

191
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,800
<i>Chevy, you there?</i>

192
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,600
Every time I slow down, it's
like my veins start to rust.

193
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,200
<i>- Did you take anything?
- Couple grams of coke.</i>

194
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,300
<i>That's a start. I'll be in L.A.
in an hour.</i>

195
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,300
<i>I'll call you as soon as I get there.
Do not stop moving!</i>

196
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,300
Taxi! Yo, yo, yo!

197
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
- Go!
- Where we go?

198
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,300
Just drive!

199
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,600
- Would you mind?
- Where you want to go, man?

200
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,200
Right.

201
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,300
- Oh, shit!
- Go right!

202
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,000
- Okay! Yes!
- Go fucking right!

203
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,900
Crank the music.

204
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,300
Crank it!

205
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,800
<i>But don't tell my heart,
my achy breaky heart</i>

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,600
<i>I just don't think
he'd understand</i>

207
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,500
<i>And if you tell my heart,
my achy breaky heart</i>

208
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,700
<i>It might blow up
and kill this man</i>

209
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,100
Pull over, pull over.

210
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,500
- Thanks, mate. I'll be back in one minute.
- Okay, cowboy.

211
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Hey, buddy!

212
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,300
You move, you die.

213
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,000
<i>- Hey, it's Eve. I'm glad you called..
- Fuck!</i>

214
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,900
Where to, man?

215
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,300
Beverly Hills.

216
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,500
- Chevy!
- Hey, boss.

217
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,200
- Something urgent has come up.
- So I've heard.

218
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Word travels fast.

219
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,900
Carlito, I need your help. I
don't have a lot of time.

220
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,488
No, not much.

221
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,900
We've gotta find an
antidote, or something.

222
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,100
- What's the matter?
- That shit they gave you..

223
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,800
It's that Chinese shit.

224
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,100
- There is no antidote.
- What, that's it?

225
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Honestly, you should
be dead already.

226
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,000
- It's a miracle.
- A miracle?

227
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,900
We give that shit to horses.

228
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,400
You don't have to be so
damn fucking cool about it.

229
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,600
What do you expect me to do?

230
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,300
Find that punk Verona,

231
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,700
and his whole fucking crew, and
feed them to a cage of wolverines.

232
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,100
What is this? What, are you
boys now or something?

233
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,900
Verona?

234
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,600
That's a small time punk.

235
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,238
Not to say that this
isn't an opportunity.

236
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:58,900
Opportunity?

237
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,700
Everyone knows the love
I have for you, Chev.

238
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,600
But maybe this makes up for
the Don Kim hit which was..

239
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,600
- perhaps ill-advised.
- Ill-advised?

240
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,000
The heat from Hong Kong was
much more than we anticipated.

241
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, that's outstanding.

242
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Glad to know my death can
be of some use to you.

243
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,900
- Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

244
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,599
I don't know if you noticed,

245
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,400
but I'm having a difficult
fucking day, brother!

246
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,300
I'm out of here.

247
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,600
You're not getting
in my cab wet!

248
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,099
- I just gave you $200
to wait for 3 minutes.

249
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,900
- You're not getting
in my car, no way!

250
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,900
Yeah, you're right.

251
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,300
Al-Qaeda! Al-Qaeda!

252
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,800
I love America! I love Bush!

253
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
I Voted Bush!

254
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,300
- Yeah.
- Hey, Chev. My flight's delayed.

255
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,800
<i>- Shit!
- It's all right. Relax.</i>

256
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,299
I mean, don't relax.

257
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,800
That shit they gave you is
cutting off your adrenaline.

258
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,899
<i>Excitement, fear, danger.</i>

259
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>It causes your body to make a
chemical called ephedrine.</i>

260
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,838
<i>They introduced an
inhibitor to your system.</i>

261
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:53,300
<i>Fuck!</i>

262
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,599
<i>Dude, you've got to
massively increase</i>

263
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,300
<i>the ephedrine levels
in your body,</i>

264
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,100
<i>to force out the inhibitors.
Go to a hospital.</i>

265
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
Get epinephrine, an
artificial adrenaline.

266
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,700
<i>It comes in
10-milligram syringes.</i>

267
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,600
It's potent, so don't overdo it.
A 5th of an injection will do.

268
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,700
Chevy? Did you get that?

269
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,200
<i>- Did you get that?
- Yeah, epi-something.</i>

270
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
Okay, okay. I've gotta go.

271
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,100
<i>Now, I'll call you
when I get there.</i>

272
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,000
<i>- Yeah?
- Chev.</i>

273
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Yeah?

274
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,900
<i>- Chev?
- What?</i>

275
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,700
<i>Hello?</i>

276
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Come on!

277
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,300
Mother!

278
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,300
<i>- Chev?
- Yes, fuck?</i>

279
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,500
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

280
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,300
- The Prince.
- Yeah.

281
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,600
I was just down here getting a taco,
and he walked in, 2 minutes ago.

282
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,100
- Where are you, now?
- Across the street, getting a taco.

283
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,100
- Where are you?
- I'm there. Meet me on 7th and Catalina.

284
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,400
Is he in there, now?

285
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,800
Did anyone go in with him?

286
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,300
Right, wait here.

287
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,200
How'd you like that one, tough guy?
How frickin' awesome was that, huh?

288
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,300
Well, well, well.

289
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,700
You feel like talking? Where's
your fuckin' brother?

290
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,200
Doing your mother like
a whore, you bitch!

291
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,600
Nice. I wonder how many steaks
I could carve out of you.

292
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,600
You died, motherfucker!

293
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,300
<i>Yeah, wanna fuck with me, ese?</i>

294
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,700
What, you rolling
pin mighty good?

295
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:25,700
What the hell you
think you doing, huh?

296
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,100
What, you want to dance
with me, motherfucker?

297
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,700
I'll fuck you up! Come on!

298
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,100
Jesus! Nothing's easy.

299
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,500
Wanna hold hands?

300
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,100
<i>- Hey, talk to me, bro.
- Hey, Ricky.</i>

301
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,700
<i>You in the mood for
sucking me off?</i>

302
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,900
<i>Maybe let me lick your
ass or something?</i>

303
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,700
<i>Who is this? Shit! Chelios?</i>

304
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,900
<i>- Is this fucking Chelios?
- That's right, bro.</i>

305
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,300
<i>Guess how I got your brother's phone?
I'm sure you have it all figured out.</i>

306
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,300
Looks like you should've cut
me up when you had the chance.

307
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,199
I'm having a little
trouble hearing you.

308
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,300
You experiencing a
little 20/20 hindsight?

309
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,700
You're supposed to
be fucking dead!

310
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,699
<i>You know, I kind of like
that shit you put in me.</i>

311
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,100
<i>Gonna give me some more?</i>

312
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,300
- Well, I'm.. I'm..
- I know, I know. Hey..

313
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
What's this?

314
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,100
A necklace! You guys really
are faggots, aren't you?

315
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,199
You motherfucker!

316
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,100
My grandfather gave that medallion
to my father and then he..

317
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,600
Fuck!

318
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,788
Fuck you, man! Shove
that thing up your ass!

319
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,200
No thanks.

320
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,399
You know, I think
I'll hang on to it.

321
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,500
You'll have to come
find me, after all.

322
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,438
Fucked up that you
killed your own brother.

323
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:28,200
You..

324
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,300
What's that shit? Epi..
10 milligrams?

325
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,200
Good work, Kaylo.

326
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,300
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

327
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,400
<i>Doctor Sing to the labor room.</i>

328
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,400
- Asshole!
- No need to push.

329
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,700
I'm looking for something
that starts with "E".

330
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
England?

331
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,600
Very funny. No. Some kind
of artificial adrenaline.

332
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,600
- Artificial adrenaline?
- Yeah, I've got heart problems.

333
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,700
- Epinephrine.
- Yes! Epinephrine.

334
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,900
I love you. Epinephrine.

335
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,300
I can't give you epinephrine.

336
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,000
- Why?
- Just a minute.

337
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,800
Oi! What do you mean..

338
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,800
- What is this shit?
- Nasal spray.

339
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,700
Miserable bitch! What?

340
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,900
Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it.
It'll get you tweaked, man.

341
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,100
Hey!

342
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,200
- Sure that's the guy?
- Yeah.

343
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,100
This room's clear.

344
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,400
<i>Could anyone speaking
Korean please come to ER?</i>

345
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,400
<i>Anyone speaking Korean..</i>

346
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,400
Yo, yo, yo!

347
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,200
Yo!

348
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,500
Stop!

349
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,600
Stop!

350
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Jerk-off!

351
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,000
Coming through!

352
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,800
I know you motherfuckers
have epinephrine.

353
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,400
- Clear the hallway!
- Corner. Is the OR ready?

354
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,200
I'm having a bad day. Tell me you've
got epinephrine on this cart!

355
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,200
You all right?

356
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,100
Tell me you've got epinephrine!

357
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,300
- Motherfucker!
- I don't know. I'll check.

358
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,000
- Get back!
- Take it easy!

359
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,399
- Do you understand
fucking English?

360
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,900
- Yes, I just don't know
which draw it's in.

361
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Come on, look!

362
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,500
- Give me the fucking epinephrine!
- I don't know where it is, man!

363
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,300
What is this, a rest home?

364
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,700
What are you doing?

365
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,200
Hurry up!

366
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,000
- Get back!
- We can't treat without insurance.

367
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,199
- I don't know if I have
it, give me a second!

368
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,600
Put the weapon down!

369
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,100
What the fuck! Where
the fuck is it?

370
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,700
- My heart!
- What?

371
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,900
- My heart!
- Yeah, yeah.

372
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,700
Drop your weapon now!

373
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,300
- What do you think you're doing? This is..
- Shut up! You!

374
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Gimme the epinephrine?

375
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,000
Don't even think about it!

376
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,900
Albuterol.. Flortab.. Epinephrine!
Here it is! I've got it!

377
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,300
- Here you go.
- Gimme that.

378
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,200
- Asshole.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

379
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,800
All right? Just be quiet.

380
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,900
Juice me.

381
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,700
Juice?

382
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,500
Do it.

383
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
- All right.
- Come on!

384
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,000
I haven't got all day.

385
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,500
Okay, I need both of them to..
Give them to me.

386
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
One.

387
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Two. Clear!

388
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,200
Get the fuck back!

389
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,800
Get out!

390
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,800
How much of this stuff
did he say to take?

391
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
<i>Chevy, we're in the air, man.</i>

392
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,900
<i>- Did you get the stuff?
- Got it.</i>

393
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,400
- Did you take it?
- Yup.

394
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,500
<i>- You took the whole thing.
- Yup.</i>

395
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,138
I said one 5th. The
shit's gonna kill you.

396
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:49,700
Right.

397
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,300
<i>- Chest on fire?
- Check.</i>

398
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,700
<i>- But you're cold.
- Check.</i>

399
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,888
And you've got a steel
hard on, don't you?

400
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:56,900
Let me check.

401
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,000
- Check.
- Your blood vessels are stimulated.

402
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,900
Urinary sphincter's so tight, you
couldn't piss to save your life.

403
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,500
Urinary sphincter, check!

404
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,600
<i>- Get some Vicodin. You at the hospital?
- Negative.</i>

405
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,699
<i>Get some grass.</i>

406
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,500
<i>That shit'll be out of your system
in 30 minutes, or it'll kill you.</i>

407
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,900
This is costing me a fortune. I'll
call you in 20 minutes when we land.

408
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,400
<i>- Copy.
- Hey, Chevy?</i>

409
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,400
You're a good dude.
Been nice knowing you.

410
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,800
Copy, out.

411
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,000
Some medical emergency.

412
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,300
<i>Police have declined to name the
man they say is still at large,</i>

413
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,000
<i>on a citywide rampage that
has left one man dead,</i>

414
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,300
<i>dozens injured, and hundreds of
thousands of dollars of damage..</i>

415
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,399
<i>in it's smoking, bloody wake.</i>

416
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,900
<i>The suspect is a
professional killer..</i>

417
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,900
<i>with ties to organized crime
and a long police record.</i>

418
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,100
<i>He is considered armed
and highly dangerous.</i>

419
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,800
<i>We now continue with regularly
scheduled programming,</i>

420
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,499
<i>but stay tuned for
continuing coverage</i>

421
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,700
<i>of this bizarre
story, as it unfolds.</i>

422
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,600
<i>What your saying is that next to
olives, onions, lemons and limes..</i>

423
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,000
Oh, shit! Take it easy.

424
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,600
Get back, pig!

425
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,100
I.. just give me the..

426
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,600
Come on, then. Let's
see you run, piggy.

427
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,000
Come on, piggy.

428
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,000
Give me the gun. Let's
talk this over.

429
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,300
Yeah, you want it? There.

430
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,600
- Let's go, come on.
- Be careful.

431
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,300
All right. I'm gonna get
some help, all right?

432
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,700
<i>Yeah.</i>

433
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,500
<i>- Hey, did you try to call?
- You've been home all day?</i>

434
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,600
- I was sleeping in.
- Sleeping in. That's great, Eve.

435
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,400
Super great.

436
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,500
<i>You all rested, now?
Glad to hear it.</i>

437
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,400
Listen, I've been
fatally poisoned.

438
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,600
A psychopath's on his way
over to torture and kill you,

439
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,799
but don't get out of bed,
I'll be over in a flash.

440
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,400
Could you fry up a waffle?

441
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,599
- Sure, yeah. Come on over.
I'll be here.

442
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,900
Right, you'll be there. Okay.

443
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Bye.

444
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,400
So, let's go get the bitch!

445
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,300
Come on, please!

446
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,000
All right, all right. Jesus!

447
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,900
Oh my God!

448
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,900
- Is this your new look or something?
- Yeah, you into it?

449
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,500
It's gross.

450
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Are you looking for
my other boyfriend?

451
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Yes!

452
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,500
- You haven't watched TV today, right?
- No, why?

453
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,400
- Didn't think so. Come on, we're leaving.
- Don't be such a freak.

454
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
Get dressed.

455
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,999
Actually, can you change the
clock on the microwave?

456
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,500
I never changed it back.

457
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,000
- What?
- The microwave.

458
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,599
Can you change the clock?

459
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
The daylight savings time,
I never changed it back.

460
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,300
- The microwave?
- Yes.

461
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Listen. I bought some flowers. They
got fucked up on the way over.

462
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,300
That's sweet! You okay? You look
like you're on drugs or something.

463
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,500
You love me, yeah?

464
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,200
Yes.

465
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,700
- Then I need you to do something for me.
- What? What's wrong?

466
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,900
I need you to put some clothes
on and come with me, right now.

467
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,000
- No.
- I'll change the clock on the microwave.

468
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,200
Okay. All right.

469
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,600
Shit's wearing off.

470
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,188
The waffle iron's on
if you want to make one.

471
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,400
Great.

472
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,800
Great.

473
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,600
You're so stressed out. Want
some pot, or something?

474
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,800
Yeah!

475
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,300
- Ready! What's wrong?
- I burned my hand.

476
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,500
- Oh, my God! Let me see it!
- Don't worry about it. Hey!

477
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,700
What the..

478
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,400
- I'm sorry.
- That was completely uncalled for.

479
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,000
Can we just..

480
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,100
Fine.

481
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,500
Parked out the back.

482
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,000
- Darn! That.. thing.
- What thing?

483
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
The waffle thing, I
gotta turn it off.

484
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
Hello?

485
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,700
Hello?

486
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,200
<i>All right, very funny.</i>

487
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,100
God, I hate that.

488
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Do you want to burn
the building down?

489
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,600
- Ouch!
- Sorry, honey.

490
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,900
Nice on, Chev.

491
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,600
Oh, there's my Tiger Balm.

492
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,100
I swear to God, Chev.

493
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,000
I don't know what you're on,
but it isn't working for you.

494
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,100
My hand cream! That's
where you went.

495
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,900
Chev? Can I have
some help, here?

496
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,200
- Where's your car?
- Actually, I took a cab.

497
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,400
This isn't gonna be.. This isn't
gonna be easy, as they say.

498
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,600
Oh, fucker.

499
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,700
- All right, here it is.
- Sorry.

500
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,900
- I told you I was a video game programmer.
- Yeah?

501
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,200
That was a lie.

502
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Actually..

503
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,600
I kill people.

504
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,800
Professional hitman. I freelance for
a major West Coast crime syndicate.

505
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,100
Last night was a job like 100 others.
High dollar hit, nothing special.

506
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,900
<i>The Triads from Hong Kong had been
moving in on the local drug cartels.</i>

507
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,900
<i>My target was the
number 1 man in L.A.,</i>

508
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,400
<i>Don Kim.</i>

509
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,700
Well?

510
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,500
What are you waiting for?

511
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,299
<i>Then, this insane idea comes
in the back of my head,</i>

512
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,100
like a.45 slug at close range.

513
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,100
Congratulations.

514
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,200
- Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

515
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,600
100 grand wants you dead. So,
sooner or later it's gonna happen,

516
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,700
but I'm not doing it.

517
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,000
I see.

518
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,599
Instead you're gonna
do something for me.

519
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,900
You're gonna get out
of town, disappear.

520
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,400
I don't care where you
go or what you do,

521
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,700
so long as you're invisible for 48 hours.
That's all I ask.

522
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,900
48 hours?

523
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:49,000
Or, if you prefer, we can
do it the other way.

524
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:54,400
The way where I go to work,
and you meet Buddha.

525
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,300
See..

526
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,800
I quit.

527
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I quit the business for you.

528
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,300
- For me?
- Yeah.

529
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,700
I figure I call you that night
and tell you everything.

530
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,900
We get on a plane, leave
this shit, never come back.

531
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,700
Pretty crazy, huh?

532
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,200
You are so weird.

533
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,500
- Are we going on a trip?
- Well..

534
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:39,500
I might be going on a trip, but
you're not coming with me..

535
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,800
- Please! Wait, please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

536
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,700
Chinese poison? Do you know
how ridiculous you sound?

537
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,100
If you're gonna break up with me,
at least you can tell me the truth!

538
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,800
What's wrong with you?

539
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,900
- Wait a minute, you trust me?
- No.

540
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
- Make love to me.
- What?

541
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,300
- I think it'll help.
- What? Are you kidding? Get off me!

542
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,400
- Take your clothes off.
- No!

543
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,700
No!

544
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,838
You said you wanted
to be more spontaneous.

545
00:48:16,851 --> 00:48:18,500
You're crazy!

546
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,400
You're an adrenaline
junkie with no soul!

547
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,900
- Save me, Eve. Save my life!
- Stop it!

548
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,400
I'm sorry. Oh my
God, are you okay?

549
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,900
Are you okay?

550
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,100
No! No!

551
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
Shit!

552
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,400
Get off!

553
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,100
You filthy animal!

554
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,300
Take me right here,
in front of everyone!

555
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,500
That's it!

556
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,600
Come on! Do it!

557
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,600
- What are you waiting for?
- Jesus!

558
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,500
- Come on!
- I'm trying! Shush!

559
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,700
Oh, God! Now you
can't get it up?

560
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,400
- Come on, get it up!
- I'll fucking get it up!

561
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
- Goddamnit, Chev!
- Shut up!

562
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,600
I'm alive! I'm alive!

563
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,300
I'm alive, you motherfuckers!

564
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,700
Oh, my God! Wow!

565
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,100
Oh, my God! Yes!

566
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,100
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?

567
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,800
<i>- Yeah.
- I've got Verona.</i>

568
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,300
<i>- Kaylo?
- I've got Verona, man.</i>

569
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,400
- What?
- No shit?

570
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,500
<i>- Where are you?
- Don Kim's shirt factory, upstairs.</i>

571
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,300
- What's the matter with you?
- 5th and Alameda?

572
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,900
- Who's at 5th and Alameda?
- Don't let that fucker out of your sight!

573
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,388
Hear me? With you in 10 minutes.
You got it?

574
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,600
Yeah, Chev.

575
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,600
Honey, I gotta go.
I'll call you!

576
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,600
Oh God, what are you looking at?

577
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,400
Hey man, what's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

578
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,099
- Right, just step
on it, all right?

579
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,900
- You're won't die in
my cab, crackhead.

580
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,800
I got something for you.

581
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,100
Take this Haitian shit.

582
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,700
This shit is some hardcore shit.
It's made from plant shit.

583
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,300
Hey, what are you laughing at?
Look at this. You see that?

584
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,700
That's what a man look like, crackhead.
That's power.

585
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,500
Now look at you.

586
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,300
What the hell.

587
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,300
Yeah.

588
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It tastes like ass.

589
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,900
That's right, devil. You wait.

590
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,800
- Shut the fuck up!
- No!

591
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,100
- No!
- Shut the fuck up!

592
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,400
Whoop, there it is! Fuck him!

593
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,900
We're here.

594
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,400
- What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you, it's hardcore.

595
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,400
It's $5.55.

596
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,900
- It's all you, man.
- Have a nice day, devil.

597
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,200
This is fucked.

598
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,200
Hey, where's he going?

599
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,300
Yeah, okay. How the fuck you
going to call me, talking shit?

600
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,400
I'm gonna smack the hell out of you.
I don't know where he at..

601
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,900
Fucking call me talking shit!

602
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,300
I'm doing my job.
I'm doing my shit.

603
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,000
I'm up here chillin', doing what I do.
I'm a rooftop mother..

604
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,400
Hey, Chevy! What's up, dog?
You chillin'? You good?

605
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,900
- What a coincidence!
- What do you mean?

606
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,100
- What, you waiting for a bus?
- Actually, I thought a helicopter..

607
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,700
- What is this?
- What?

608
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,300
- You working for the Chinese?
- The Chinese?

609
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,599
- You crazy? I wouldn't
do that to you.

610
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,200
I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?

611
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,700
- Okay, ding. Time's up.
- What do you mean, "ding"?

612
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,200
What do you mean, "ding"?

613
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,700
Where is that motherfucker?

614
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,300
Chev.

615
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,000
- What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

616
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,000
Oh, you mean like this?

617
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:37,700
Now you tell me where that little
toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona.

618
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,400
Verona's got nothing
to do with this.

619
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,500
What?

620
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,700
- Don Carlos wants you off the streets.
- Carlito?

621
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,800
You've totally lost
your shit, dog.

622
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,800
You're all over TV. Destroying
property, making unauthorized hits.

623
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,000
You're causing the organization
a great deal of embarrassment.

624
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,800
- You're telling me Carlito wanted this?
- Look.

625
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,700
Don't worry, we'll
take care of Verona.

626
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:11,200
The best thing for you to do is find
some nice, dark, quiet place and..

627
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,500
just die.

628
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,500
Just die. You think I've got
"cunt" written on my forehead?

629
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,400
Maybe you're right.

630
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,800
- We all got to die sometime, right?
- Yeah.

631
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,500
We all got to die sometime.

632
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,400
So, I'll just die.

633
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,300
What the..

634
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,600
- What the..
- You got shot!

635
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,100
Mother..

636
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,400
Jesus! Eve, move!

637
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,500
- You, asshole!
- Don't talk to him like that!

638
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,600
- My boyfriend kills people!
- Nice.

639
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,600
Oh, God!

640
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,400
I had to see if you
were telling the truth.

641
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,700
Come on.

642
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,700
No, wait!

643
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Now come on.

644
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,500
Oh, God!

645
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,200
Oh, dammit!

646
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,700
- I forgot to take my birth control pills.
- What?

647
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,700
- Where are the keys? The keys!
- Here.

648
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,900
- Come! Come!
- My stuff!

649
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,500
All my stuff!

650
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,100
- You weren't lying!
- Welcome to my life.

651
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,600
No, I mean.. that you would
give it all up for me.

652
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,700
Yeah.

653
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,200
- And the other part?
- The poison's true, too.

654
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,200
Then.. that means..

655
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,100
Pretty much, Eve.

656
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,300
- How can we stop it?
- Only adrenaline can slow it down.

657
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,000
- So, when we were in Chinatown?
- Yeah. Sorry.

658
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,600
What are you doing?

659
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,000
- This'll get you going.
- What?

660
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,900
- Come on, let's finish what you started.
- Oh, boy.

661
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,900
Oh, that's it. That's
really working for me.

662
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,600
- You like that?
- Stay down!

663
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Motherfuck!

664
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:33,000
Jesus! Yeah, that's it, baby.
Just a little more.

665
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,700
Stay down, Eve.

666
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,000
- Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big!

667
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,300
Oh my God!

668
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,200
Just a touch..

669
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,600
- What's that matter?
- So you can fall asleep like always?

670
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,600
I don't think so.

671
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,300
Jesus! Fuck!

672
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,100
Are they really..

673
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,800
They're dead.

674
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:58,000
How can you do that?

675
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,700
I told you, baby. I quit.

676
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,300
Yeah.

677
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Shit! I've been trying to
call you for a half hour.

678
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,300
<i>- Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office.</i>

679
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,800
- Can you make it over here?
- Why not?

680
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,600
Chocolate?

681
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,200
What's this fucking receipt from
Gold Foods Market for $254?

682
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,300
Snacks.

683
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,400
I owe you again, Doc.

684
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,300
Chevy, you're my best customer.

685
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,000
What is this stuff?

686
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,700
Synthetic epinephrine..

687
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,100
- diluted with some saline.
- Feels sort of good.

688
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:52,400
Well, I got a little meth in there, too.
You're feeling the endorphins.

689
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,900
Wait a minute. I'm not better?

690
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,700
No, you're not better.

691
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,399
You're in such shit
shape, it's stunning.

692
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,600
I can't believe your
heart's beating.

693
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:11,200
You should be in a
fucking medical journal.

694
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,999
So, what are you going to do?

695
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
- The solution acts as
a competing inhibitor.

696
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,700
It's pushing the poison
out of your receptors,

697
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,400
and replacing it with a chemical.
It's just a temporary fix.

698
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,500
Then what?

699
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,400
Then you're fucked.

700
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,800
I can put you on life support and
string this out for a few days.

701
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,400
But you're going to go into
a comma at some point.

702
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,300
Does she know?

703
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,399
Why don't I load you
full of something?

704
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,500
You can go out in a
beautiful dream.

705
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,300
A dream.

706
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,000
Can I do that for you?

707
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,300
No, no, no. That's
not what I want.

708
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,600
What do you want?

709
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,900
One hour.

710
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,600
I want one hour.

711
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,800
Give me a fuckin' break.

712
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,599
<i>So, the wild rampage that
began 9am in L.A. continues.</i>

713
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,900
The suspect, still at large.

714
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,000
We didn't give him
enough Chinese shit.

715
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,900
You think?

716
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,900
Dude, it's him!

717
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,300
<i>- What's up, corpse?
- Bonjour, douche bag,</i>

718
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,788
<i>Thought you might be
interested in a deal.</i>

719
01:04:57,801 --> 01:05:00,100
<i>Oh, you a dealer, now?</i>

720
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,100
Don't you worry about what I am.

721
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,300
<i>- Listen, I want the antidote.
- Oh, the antidote?</i>

722
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,100
<i>- That's right, the antidote.
- What you prepared to give me?</i>

723
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,299
How about that jewelry
I got off that faggot

724
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,500
brother of yours,
you cocksucker?

725
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,988
<i>Don't pop a blood
vessel, you little penis.</i>

726
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:20,500
<i>Okay.</i>

727
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,500
<i>- You like the deal?
- Whatever!</i>

728
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,100
Be at the downtown
Lint in 20 minutes.

729
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,000
<i>- You know the spot?
- Yeah.</i>

730
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,900
<i>Don't be late, or I'll trade the
thing to a whore for a hand job.</i>

731
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,200
Look, I said I said I'd fuckin' be..
Fuck!

732
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,400
See you later, sunshine.

733
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,600
Dammit! Fuck!

734
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,700
Yo, it's Verona. You won't
believe this call I just got.

735
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,700
It's gonna be all right, baby.

736
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,800
- But you said..
- No, no.

737
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,600
Things have changed.

738
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:15,900
There's an antidote. I can make a
deal for it, but I got to go alone.

739
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,500
- I'm scared.
- Of course.

740
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,100
You'll be safe, now.
And I'll be back.

741
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,100
Promise?

742
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,400
I promise.

743
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:28,400
What's happening, bro?

744
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,900
<i>- Where did I go wrong?
- You fuckin' just say something?</i>

745
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,100
<i>It's like talking to the wall.</i>

746
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,438
<i>Mom?</i>

747
01:07:58,451 --> 01:08:00,300
<i>I'm amazed you remember
you have a mother.</i>

748
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,199
<i>- Please, I haven't
got time for this.</i>

749
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,800
You got no time, period.

750
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,938
<i>Orlando?</i>

751
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:08,500
<i>- You're a persistent
motherfucker, Chelios.</i>

752
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,900
<i>I give you that. They pop you
and you keep getting up?</i>

753
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,400
<i>- I'm the terminator.
- You was, but here's a new gun in town.</i>

754
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,300
You know, I just don't get it.

755
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,400
Why didn't you cut me up
when you had the chance?

756
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,700
<i>Too easy, motherfucker.
Look at you.</i>

757
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,099
<i>- Bi-polar, sadomasochistic
tendencies..</i>

758
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,100
- Adrenalinejunkie,
addicted to violence..

759
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,899
<i>Carving up a guy
while he screams in</i>

760
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,900
<i>his own blood and
excrement, would be like..</i>

761
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,300
<i>like a gift. A warriors death.</i>

762
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,800
<i>- Hell, you'd probably get off on it.
- Who are you, anyway?</i>

763
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,200
<i>- I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Better late than never.</i>

764
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,800
<i>You know you're
gonna die up there.</i>

765
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,100
Yeah, maybe. But I'm
taking you with me.

766
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,800
Some pills, Doc.

767
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,400
- Chelios?
- Hello, girls.

768
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:29,900
Hold up.

769
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,600
Give me the piece.

770
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,100
- Now, isn't that a fucking picture?
- Chelios.

771
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,000
What a fucking
nightmare you are.

772
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,600
No shit.

773
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,300
Sit down.

774
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,200
Whoa! Wait a minute. You
pat him down, again.

775
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,700
I know he's carrying something.

776
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,900
Let me see that.

777
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,700
Motherfucker.

778
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,600
Clever. What is this,
an insulin pump?

779
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:22,900
Basically.

780
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,900
What the fuck is insulin?

781
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,100
Ephedrine, right?

782
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,000
- Yeah.
- You're very resourceful.

783
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,100
- Found a new master, little bitch?
- I'm nobody's bitch.

784
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,900
You'll be a bitch when Carlito hires
you for half what he paid me.

785
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,400
That's enough.

786
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,300
You'll throw boss a reach-around,
show him you're a good bitch.

787
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,700
I'm nobody's little bitch!

788
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,200
You fuckin' hear me?

789
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,400
- He'll pay me what I tell him to pay!
- That's enough!

790
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,100
Sit down!

791
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,500
It's been a long fucking day.

792
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,300
In the end, you have to admit,
it all works out quite nicely.

793
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,700
Don Kim gets his
bullet, thanks to you,

794
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,100
and Hong Kong gets a
goat to take the fall.

795
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,500
- Please understand, it's nothing personal.
- Speak for yourself.

796
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,200
That what I think it is?

797
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,600
It's the Chinese shit.

798
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,500
Hold him down.

799
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,100
Not so fast, motherfucker!

800
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,400
He's gone dipsy-do, yo!

801
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,400
Whatever, psycho.

802
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,600
I'm afraid the Houdini
act is over, my friend.

803
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,300
- Our Father, who art in..
- Shut up!

804
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,300
So, this is how it is.

805
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:07,900
- It's Don Kim! He's supposed to be dead!
- Presto.

806
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:32,900
Police have moved to
surround the Hotel Lint,

807
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:35,600
<i>where the madman behind
today's mayhem..</i>

808
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,500
<i>is holed up and making a
desperate last stand.</i>

809
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,300
<i>Officials have confirmed
gunfire on the sundeck.</i>

810
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,699
<i>Our news chopper
will bring live,</i>

811
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,400
<i>uncensored coverage
from above the hotel.</i>

812
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,299
<i>Again, this coverage
is uncensored,</i>

813
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,300
<i>so any small children present
should leave the room.</i>

814
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:07,900
Get me out of here!

815
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,800
I'll kill you, Chelios!

816
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,600
Too late!

817
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,800
Look out!

818
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,100
Thanks, boss.

819
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:49,600
Let's get the fuck out of here, now!
Let's go!

820
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,100
Present from Kaylo.

821
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,400
Now what? Now you say shit!

822
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,900
Where the fuck were you?

823
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,500
Who's the bitch, now?

824
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,600
No, no! You fly, motherfucker!

825
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,800
Motherfuckin' fly!

826
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,500
You're dead!

827
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:18,100
Oh my God!

828
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,500
You're dead! You're
dead, motherfucker!

829
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,200
I told you I'd kill
you, you little bitch!

830
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,100
<i>Hey, its Eve. I'm glad you
called but I'm not here.</i>

831
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,599
<i>Leave a message,
unless you're selling</i>

832
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,600
<i>something 'cause I'm
not interested.</i>

833
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,300
<i>If you're not, then just..
Wait, time's up.</i>

834
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,800
Hey, doll..

835
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,900
Looks like I let
you down, again.

836
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:48,200
<i>Seems like all my life
I'vejust been going.. going..</i>

837
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,200
<i>going..</i>

838
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,800
I wish I'd taken more time to stop
and smell the roses, so to speak.

839
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,900
Well, I guess it's too
late for that now.

840
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:09,300
You're the greatest, baby.
