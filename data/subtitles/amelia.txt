1
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,980
Engine two looks fine. How's number one?

2
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,748
Did a compression
check. Engine one looks fine.

3
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,613
We love you, Amelia!

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,725
Good luck, Amelia!

5
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,521
Miss Earhart, do you really
think you'll break the record this time?

6
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,789
<i>She will fly the world's full circumference,</i>

7
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:08,596
<i>24,902 miles,
to travel across the South Atlantic,</i>

8
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,862
<i>crossing Africa, over India:::</i>

9
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,995
After this 'round-the-world flight,
Miss Earhart,

10
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,131
are you gonna give up long-distance flying?

11
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,266
Not while there's still life left in me.

12
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,208
I fly for the fun of it.

13
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,339
Good luck!

14
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,816
All right, give us a big smile!

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,409
We love you, Amelia!

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,044
Thank you. That's enough.

17
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,272
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.

18
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,109
Mr. Putnam.

19
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,204
The headwinds were stronger
than they knew when they took off.

20
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:06,217
<i>I recalculated the fuel:
Lt'll cost them nine percent:</i>

21
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,155
Nine percent.

22
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,932
<i>When I saw that little plane,</i>

23
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,600
<i>it lifted me above the Kansas prairie:</i>

24
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,813
<i>I had to fly:</i>

25
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,153
<i>My daddy had the wanderlust:
That's why I like to keep moving:</i>

26
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,132
<i>Flying lets me move in three dimensions:</i>

27
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:49,253
<i>Who wants a life imprisoned in safety?</i>

28
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,793
Miss Earhart?
Mr. Putnam will see you now.

29
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,537
Send the papers
over this afternoon. Thank you, bye.

30
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,476
- Miss Earhart?
- Mr. Putnam?

31
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,601
Please, sit.

32
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,849
I'm told you want to fly
across the Atlantic Ocean.

33
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,182
- I do.
- Why do you want to fly?

34
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,250
- Why?
- Why do you want to fly?

35
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,818
Why does a man ride a horse?

36
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,861
Because he wants to, I guess.

37
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,905
Three women have died trying.

38
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,837
Two others have escaped with their lives.

39
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,104
If you do make it, you will be the first,

40
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:48,612
which is the real attraction
for both of us, I expect.

41
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,175
Always nice to know
what the real attraction is.

42
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:57,418
The plane was bought from
Admiral Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite,

43
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,256
who's asked to find an American.

44
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,523
Educated, well-spoken, a flier

45
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,424
and preferably physically attractive.

46
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,659
Why would that matter?

47
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,669
Because she wants
the world to pay attention.

48
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,165
And pretty girls command more attention.

49
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,036
Was that your advice?

50
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,706
<i>There'll be a contract for the girl's
story with The New York Times:</i>

51
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,377
Also a book
to be published under her name.

52
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,679
But all the money
from this will go to Mrs. Guest.

53
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,449
Except for the part that goes to you.

54
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,545
Well, this is America,

55
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,320
and therefore I am obligated to
make as much money as I can.

56
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,665
You have a wonderful laugh, Miss Earhart.

57
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,997
You said she wants a flier.

58
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,509
Don't get your hopes up.

59
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,906
The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be pilot.

60
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,949
There will be a male co-pilot
who will also serve as navigator.

61
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,319
The woman will be purely a passenger.

62
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,425
Take Lindbergh. I published his book
three months after his historic flight.

63
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,333
Must be wonderful to actually know him,
to be a friend of his.

64
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,302
Friend? Good God, no.

65
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,396
Can't stand the man.

66
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,966
He's a stiff-ass, sanctimonious,
boring prude.

67
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,878
Was a bestseller though.

68
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,413
Why would anyone want to read
a book written by a passenger?

69
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,817
Because the hook is that they're gonna
make the woman commander.

70
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,183
The pilot will sign a contract

71
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,282
saying he's under
your direction and control.

72
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,621
It would be your flight.

73
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,627
My fraud, you mean.

74
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:49,066
A very distasteful word
in book publishing, Miss Earhart.

75
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,465
I don't know, Mr. Putnam.

76
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,266
My dream has always been
to fly across the Atlantic,

77
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,933
but the way you want me to do it is far
from the way I've envisioned it.

78
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,601
Let me be frank.

79
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,571
With your level of flight experience,
I wouldn't place you

80
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,673
anywhere near the group
that would normally be considered for this,

81
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,480
if a woman were to do any flying at all.

82
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,787
Miss Earhart, let me be painfully clear,

83
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,855
I give the orders and you take them.

84
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,019
And if you do as you're told, you'll be a star.

85
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,825
And I will be nearby, a small particle of dust

86
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,524
in your constellation.

87
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,625
Spoken like a gentleman.

88
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,760
Miss Earhart.

89
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,202
Mr. Putnam.

90
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,139
Of course,
a gentleman would've paid for my ticket.

91
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,432
What the hell are they?

92
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,636
Oryx!

93
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,882
Look how free they are!

94
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,513
No constraints, no schedules to keep.

95
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,680
For a gal who don't like schedules,

96
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,887
you sure got yourself hooked up
with the wrong fella in Mr. Putnam.

97
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,598
Boys, I'd like to introduce
your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart.

98
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,272
Say hello to Slim Gordon, your navigator.

99
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,776
How do you do?

100
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,608
And Bill Stultz,

101
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,773
- the best pilot working today.
- Hello, Bill.

102
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,215
How much fuel do you lose
because of these?

103
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,082
Costs us at least 400 gallons.

104
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,582
Well, then why have them?

105
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,856
The owner wants to protect her
plane in case you have to ditch it at sea.

106
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,897
But those are decisions I have to make,
not somebody else.

107
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,625
They're not making this trip, we are.

108
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,760
But she owns the plane,
and this is still America, Miss Earhart.

109
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,997
Ownership is the trump card.

110
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,539
Sad to say, but dollars put planes in the air.

111
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:15,012
I wonder if it can keep us up there,
not that I've ever had enough to try.

112
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,845
Our job is to figure out
how to fly this beauty without gasoline.

113
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,646
Include the whole engine up here.

114
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,812
The name is Amelia Earhart.

115
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,396
Careful up there, Slim.

116
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,273
They're leaving for Newfoundland.

117
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,537
Yes, they'll be taking off
for there tomorrow, weather permitting.

118
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,442
Make sure the reporters are there.
Goodbye.

119
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,444
Popping-off letters.
For my dad, my mom, and my sis.

120
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,687
You know, in case.

121
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,494
I'm honored that you would
leave these with me.

122
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,590
Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault.

123
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,760
Pray I make it.

124
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,971
Not much of a prayer man.

125
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,236
Then at least tip your hat
and cross your fingers.

126
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,946
Well,

127
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,878
- see you.
- See you.

128
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,438
<i>It's a short hop
from Boston to Newfoundland</i>

129
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,405
<i>for Amelia Earhart and crew:</i>

130
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,069
<i>Then on to Ireland,
and possibly the record books:</i>

131
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,706
<i>Earhart and top-notch ace
Bill Stultz have to get airborne,</i>

132
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,718
<i>quite a feat once their plane is fully
loaded for the Atlantic crossing:</i>

133
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,444
Seems like we got a situation here,
a real problem.

134
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,915
When you figure it out,
Commander, let us know.

135
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,210
I don't even know
what the hell I'm saying anymore.

136
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,343
Here's to Little Miss Earhart,
who couldn't lift a pigeon off the ground!

137
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,051
What time is it?

138
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,387
It's time to fly.

139
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,195
Get up, get dressed, we're going now.

140
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,390
Where's the weather report?

141
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,090
It's not good enough.

142
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,192
Great.

143
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,501
Either we fly to Ireland
or you're going home today.

144
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:02,869
Well, it's not good enough.

145
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,375
It's fine. There's a tailwind all the way.

146
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,877
We'll off-load to 700 gallons,
which gets us off the water

147
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,038
and the wind will get us to Ireland.

148
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,309
You're dumping fuel? You're serious?

149
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,351
Just as serious as you're hung-over.

150
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,822
Slim, you go now. Get the late weather.
We'll meet you at the plane.

151
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,018
Slim, go. I've got this.

152
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,681
I've loved one person unconditionally, Bill.

153
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,011
He's the most caring and generous

154
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,351
and charming
and flat-out funny guy I'll ever know.

155
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,381
He's my father.

156
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,185
He's a drunk,
and he's let me down all my life.

157
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:04,763
Now you get out of that goddamn bed,
and you fly that plane to Ireland,

158
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,134
or I swear to you, I will.

159
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,438
Good. Slim, start the engines.

160
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,977
This report indicates some degree of risk.
It's a risk I'm taking.

161
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,920
Have a nice flight.

162
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,695
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill!
We'll both be in them.

163
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,145
So, to take off,
you pull back on the thing, right?

164
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,950
Go get 'em, Amelia!

165
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,809
Start the clock!

166
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,946
Let's hope this works!

167
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:13,922
We're up.

168
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,064
We're up. We're up!

169
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,669
- Good work!
- Well done, Commander!

170
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,054
<i>The fog comes on little cat feet:</i>

171
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:43,651
<i>It sits, looking over harbor and city,
on silent haunches</i>

172
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,591
<i>and then moves on:</i>

173
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,993
<i>Listen:</i>

174
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,534
<i>The motors are humming sweetly:</i>

175
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,696
<i>And I feel at home:</i>

176
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,008
You okay?

177
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,109
Be better off if the damn radio would
join the party!

178
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,984
Mr. Putnam! There's a call coming in.

179
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,393
Putnam.

180
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,260
<i>I'm afraid we've lost contact
with Miss Earhart's plane, sir:</i>

181
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,399
Keep me informed. Thank you.

182
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,671
We've been flying for 19 hours plus.

183
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,407
How far to land?

184
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,238
Radio is still out.

185
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,114
There's no way to compute wind speed
and drift in the clouds,

186
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,211
so God only knows where Ireland is.

187
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,689
There may be an hour of gasoline left.
Probably less.

188
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:50,491
If we land on the water now,
we might have a rescue.

189
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,853
And a failure!

190
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,367
That's out.

191
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,608
Hold on to something, for Christ's sake!

192
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,912
Slim, go help her.

193
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,417
Hang on! Okay, I'm coming. Hold on.

194
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,896
Got it. Take my hand.

195
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,796
- Hang on, Slim!
- Help!

196
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,367
You boys all right?

197
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,609
Oh, God!

198
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,707
Land.

199
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,242
Land. Look.

200
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,112
We got land!

201
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,326
We did it!

202
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,130
We're alive!

203
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,897
Nice work!

204
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,381
Amazing!

205
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,322
Glory, hallelujah!
We made it!

206
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,436
Hello!

207
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,936
Hello there!
Hello, young lady!

208
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,065
Fine young fella.
Hello!

209
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,504
Hello there, gentlemen. Hello!

210
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,636
What do you make of that?

211
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,612
Hurry up with it.
You're going to miss it.

212
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,713
Hurry up, man!

213
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,554
Welcome, Miss Earhart!

214
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:47,494
Miss Earhart!

215
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,234
Morgan, be careful.
That's precious cargo!

216
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,119
There you go,
lovely lady. Watch your step.

217
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,706
Welcome.

218
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,807
Thank you.

219
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,779
Is it Irish tradition
to greet newcomers with song?

220
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,119
I couldn't say. This is Wales!

221
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,430
Bill, look!

222
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,076
Hello, Dorothy.

223
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,656
Are you going to be
the next girls to become pilots?

224
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,155
What?

225
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,863
It feels strange.

226
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,902
We haven't had a moment alone.
Just the two of us.

227
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,062
<i>Miss Earhart,
do you have a statement for the Times?</i>

228
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,537
We're so proud of you!

229
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,107
We love you, Amelia!

230
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,838
Amelia! Not in the rain!

231
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,409
I flew across the Atlantic!

232
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,210
Hold it right there.

233
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,347
Now, this is a list of the shots they want.

234
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,891
Do you have dirt on your face?

235
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,858
I believe you are referring to my freckles.

236
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,896
- They come with the skin.
- I don't like them.

237
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:03,674
Very heroic. Think Lindbergh.
Lady Lindy. That's what they'll call you.

238
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,078
<i>As I look back on the flight,</i>

239
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,116
<i>I think of two questions
that have been asked me most frequently:</i>

240
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,608
<i>'"Where are you going next? '"</i>

241
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,980
<i>And '"What did you wear? '"</i>

242
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,097
Lucky Strike endorsement.

243
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,462
I wrote the copy myself.

244
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,730
What does it say?
"I don't smoke, but you should"?

245
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,868
<i>No, it says that Lucky Strikes were
the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship:</i>

246
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,874
Which is true. I hid them under the seat.

247
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,776
True, maybe, but misleading.
Why would I sign that?

248
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,811
So that Bill and Slim get paid.

249
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:03,227
<i>Amelia Earhart,
the only woman to fly across the Atlantic,</i>

250
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,361
<i>just can't keep her feet on the ground:</i>

251
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,406
<i>The publisher George Putnam
has commissioned her</i>

252
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,534
<i>to write a book on her flying adventures:</i>

253
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,347
- Thanks, fellas!
You're welcome, Miss Earhart.

254
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,161
You didn't have to come get me.

255
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,758
You do have a dress to change into, I hope.

256
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,098
- Well, it's just a college class, George.
- No, no, no.

257
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,071
No. You have to take
every appearance seriously.

258
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,368
You never know what it might lead to.

259
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,808
Spoken by a man who should know.

260
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,716
What was that for?

261
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,011
Good luck?

262
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,054
What happened to tipping your hat
and crossing your fingers?

263
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:01,683
Oh, I'm afraid I'm way beyond that now,
like it or not.

264
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,355
I think I like it.

265
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,902
What did your mother say when she knew
you flew across the Atlantic?

266
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,841
Well, she sent a telegram
congratulating me

267
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,140
and then she said the next time

268
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,147
she wants to sit beside me in the cockpit.

269
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,418
How did it feel to fly over the ocean?

270
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,079
Were you scared?

271
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,690
When I looked down at the sea,

272
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,052
<i>it seemed much like the sky to me:</i>

273
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,762
<i>As if the sky and the sea were the same:</i>

274
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:46,598
<i>I felt much as I do
when I'm flying upward toward the sun:</i>

275
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,767
<i>Transported somehow to a simple,</i>

276
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,805
<i>safe, beautiful place,
where everything is comprehensible:</i>

277
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,619
Welcome to
the Chicago Congress Plaza Hotel.

278
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,349
Good night, Amelia.

279
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,788
Good night.

280
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,493
<i>It must have been moonglow</i>

281
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,337
<i>Way up in the blue</i>

282
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,504
<i>It must have been moonglow</i>

283
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:31,108
<i>That led me straight to you</i>

284
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,979
<i>I still hear you:::</i>

285
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,838
Dance with me, George.

286
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,486
<i>And I keep on praying</i>

287
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:16,125
<i>'"Oh, Lord, please let this last'"</i>

288
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:23,929
<i>We seemed to float right through the air</i>

289
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,239
<i>Heavenly songs</i>

290
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:37,042
<i>Seemed to come from everywhere</i>

291
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:43,083
<i>And now when there's moonglow</i>

292
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:49,154
<i>Way up in the blue</i>

293
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,390
<i>I'll always remember</i>

294
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:59,364
<i>That moonglow gave me you</i>

295
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,508
Hello, Elinor.

296
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:11,582
Mr. Putnam.

297
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,014
Yes, please come in.

298
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,379
Amelia.

299
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,015
Miss Smith.

300
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,959
I've been following your career
with a great deal of admiration.

301
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,690
Oh, Miss Earhart,
you are such an inspiration.

302
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,728
I never get tired
of reading about you.

303
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:34,330
They're saying
you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.

304
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,168
- On a good week.
- On a bad week.

305
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,606
Depends on
whether you want the real or the sell.

306
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,235
Oh, I don't underestimate
the value of selling.

307
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,043
A 16-year-old girl
makes headlines illegally flying

308
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,981
under the four bridges of the East River.

309
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:50,248
You don't seem to need
much help selling yourself.

310
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,351
Actually, Mr. Putnam,

311
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,460
I was hoping you could do to
me what you've done to her.

312
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,758
What's your primary ambition?

313
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,730
To take Amelia's place as
the number one female pilot.

314
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,659
- You want a tip?
- I do.

315
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,260
If I listened to everyone
who said it was impossible,

316
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,033
I'd never be flying.

317
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,540
Don't let anyone turn you around.

318
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,340
You're all here.
Thank you.

319
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,648
So lovely to see you.

320
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,651
- Hello.
Good evening.

321
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,385
Good evening, Miss Earhart.

322
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,120
Marvelous party.

323
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:34,488
Oh, Amelia. This is Gene Vidal.

324
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,865
Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix.
She's a friend of George's.

325
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,562
How do you do, Miss Earhart?

326
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,663
Quite well, Mr. Vidal.
Thank you.

327
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,607
I understand you're writing a book
about your transatlantic journey

328
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,871
under the tutelage of the master.

329
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,241
Yes.

330
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,338
You enjoying your stay here in Rye?

331
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,111
I must say, I'm a bit out of my element.

332
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,949
The distance between this world
and where I come from

333
00:30:57,055 --> 00:31:00,149
is as great as the distance
between the sun and the moon.

334
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,022
And you believe the whole
"opposites attract" theory is...

335
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,395
Pure hooey.

336
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,121
- Where are you from?
- Kansas.

337
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,792
"Hooey" is a Kansas word?

338
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,129
Yes, I suppose it is.

339
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,433
Public relations.
It's a new field, entirely new.

340
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,973
It's not publicity, not promotion.

341
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,334
Miss Earhart. May I call you Amelia?

342
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,706
We may be from different worlds,

343
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,714
but we have more in common
than you might imagine.

344
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,444
- Is that so?
- Yes. I'm a teacher,

345
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,180
at West Point, true, but still a teacher.

346
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,812
What do you teach?

347
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,185
Flying.

348
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,170
Listen, Amelia...

349
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:05,453
This is the first time
I've ever seen you stumped for a word.

350
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,129
What is it?

351
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:16,461
Marry me.

352
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,929
- What?
- I want you to marry me.

353
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,332
I don't want to get married, George.
I'm not the marrying kind.

354
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,672
Don't you see
you and I embarking on a new life?

355
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,914
Dear George.

356
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,011
Only I can make a fulfilling life for myself.

357
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,179
I don't believe
that one can have a fulfilled life alone.

358
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,257
Only when it's shared.

359
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,759
Let me share your life with you.

360
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,391
Let me try to give you whatever you want.

361
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,034
When I was a little girl,

362
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,045
for my seventh birthday

363
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,140
my father gave me a globe.

364
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,179
And I'd spend hours just spinning it slowly,

365
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:17,126
reading the names of all those strange,
faraway places.

366
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:22,092
Morocco. Spain. Ethiopia.

367
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,425
Dreaming that someday
I would go to those places,

368
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,299
like a wayfarer,

369
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,205
a traveler,

370
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,506
a vagabond.

371
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,105
I want to be free, George.

372
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,008
To be a vagabond of the air.

373
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,289
I'll help you get there.

374
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,215
Thanks.

375
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,587
Hello!

376
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,996
Give me the camera.

377
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:55,521
<i>I am on my shining adventure,
flying the world:</i>

378
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,065

379
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,328
<i>Only freedom:</i>

381
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,281
<i>You must know again

382
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:56,308
<i>my feeling
that I shatter thereby my life in flying,</i>

383
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,411
<i>which means so much to me:</i>

384
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,851
<i>In this connection,
I may have to keep some place</i>

385
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:05,122
<i>where I can go to be myself now and then,</i>

386
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,663
<i>for I cannot guarantee to endure at all</i>

387
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:11,166
<i>the confinements of
even an attractive cage:</i>

388
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,524
"In our life together,

389
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:42,531
"I shall not hold you

390
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,762
"nor shall I consider myself
bound to you similarly.

391
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,901
"I must exact a cruel promise.

00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,941
"And that is, you will let me go in a year

393
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,480
"if we find no happiness together. "

394
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,346
Only you, my dear Amelia,

395
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,821
could say those brutal words to me

396
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,825
and still have me wanting to be with you.

397
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,262
Forever.

398
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,140
<i>Amelia, do you promise to love,</i>

399
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,933
honor and obey this man...

400
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,237
Excuse me, sir?

401
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,009
May we take that back a bit, please?

402
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,104
Love, yes, if it's warranted.

403
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,944
Honor, same thing.

404
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,541
Obey, I can't promise that
under any circumstances,

405
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,553
but the groom understands that.

406
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,555
Please remove "obey" from the prayer

407
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,785
so we can wrap this up
before the bride runs off.

408
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,260
I now pronounce you man and wife.

409
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,629
<i>Announcing
the first Women's Air Derby,</i>

410
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,434
<i>racing from Santa Monica to Cleveland:</i>

411
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,141
Yeah, that's fine.

412
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,302
What's this we're hearing?

413
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,880
Advance press release.
The gentlemen who are running the Derby

414
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,007
are about to announce
the race has to end west of the Rockies.

415
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,106
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

416
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,845
That's absurd,
they're cutting out half the route.

417
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:43,920
What are they thinking?

418
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,182
They're thinking that it would be bad press

419
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,520
when you girls
start smashing into the Rocky Mountains.

420
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,618
How dare they? I'm gonna have
a word with these gentlemen.

421
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,663
Wait, wait, wait. No, no.

422
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,356
Come here and walk with me.

423
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:01,666
I think it would benefit women fliers
everywhere if Amelia won the Derby.

424
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,036
You know, the publicity
would put the race and all of you

425
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,233
up there with the boys.

426
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,375
Well, maybe I'll win the race myself.

427
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,542
Well, you can't win if your plane doesn't
pass the final inspection.

428
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,052
And let me predict that it won't.

429
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,520
- Well, that's a threat.
- No. A prediction.

430
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,689
Amelia's the one who said I shouldn't
let anybody turn me around.

431
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,266
Yeah, she probably meant me.

432
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,529
Well, obviously
she doesn't see me as a threat.

433
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,661
Oh, sure, she does.

434
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,069
She just doesn't care.

435
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,305
Hey, Gladys!

436
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,173
I let the boys in charge know,
in no uncertain terms,

437
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,041
we're not changing our route!

438
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,547
We'll sail
over those mountains like we're eagles.

439
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,011
I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor.

440
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,814
This is what my loyalty requires.

441
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:56,518
<i>Lady Lindy herself, Amelia Earhart!</i>

442
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:57,920

443
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:06,997
<i>Amelia Earhart

00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,652

00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,314
<i>as they approach the finish line:</i>

449
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,356
<i>Here they come, folks:</i>

450
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,954
<i>In first place,
Louise Thaden from Bentonville, Arkansas!</i>

451
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:46,805
<i>In second place, Gladys O'Donnell
from Long Beach, California:</i>

452
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:53,542
<i>Third place goes
to Amelia Earhart, Atchison, Kansas!</i>

453
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,185
How does it feel to finish third?

454
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,453
A victory for any woman flier is
a victory for me.

455
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,688
<i>I'd like
to add my congratulations to Louise Thaden</i>

456
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,732
<i>and announce that
we have formed an organization</i>

457
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,428
<i>to promote women in aviation:</i>

458
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:17,933
<i>Ninety-nine women pilots have applied,
so we're calling it The Ninety-Nines:</i>

459
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:22,075
<i>And we're going to fly forever!</i>

460
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,082
- George?
- Mmm-hmm?

461
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,017
- I've been thinking.
- Yes?

462
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,218
I want to fly the Atlantic.

463
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,518
You already have.

464
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,355
As a passenger. It doesn't count.

465
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,387
I want to fly it solo.

466
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:47,128
It's been five years since Lindbergh.

467
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,306
No one has made it solo.

468
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,000
Fourteen have died trying.

469
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,409
I'll make it. I know I will.

470
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,183
And if you don't?

471
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,325
I'd rather face a watery grave

472
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,121
than go on living as a fraud.

473
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,960
What's wrong with that?
I've been very successful at it.

474

Well, I'll nap on the way.

481
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,569
Good news about flying solo,
no one making noise.

482
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,673
Do you have money?

483
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:05,906
No.

484

A whole 20?

485
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:19,086
I spent our money on ocean liner passage.
Going to bring you back.

486
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,428
It's non-refundable.

00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:09,534
<i>having just completed the first flight
by a woman across the Atlantic:</i>

523
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:13,207
<i>And there's the little plane
in which she's broken all records:</i>

524
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,550
Well done. Well done.

525
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:48,744
<i>Action!</i>

526
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,921
You're on vacation
with Amelia Earhart luggage.

527
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,817
Travel the Nile, moonlight...

528
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,389
I'm sorry, I can't say this.

529
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:11,135
I try to put the freedom
that is flying into my clothes!

530
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,970
Eastman Kodak cameras.

531
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,651
Travel the world, save your memories.

532
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,889
<i>The second person to fly the Atlantic solo,</i>

533
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:36,727
<i>- and the first one to fly it twice:
- Standing room only, good.</i>

534
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:40,427
<i>Fourteen hours and 54 minutes:</i>

535
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,099
Are you staying for this?

536
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,536
No, I can't.

537
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,299
<i>I gotta meet the features editor at the Post</i>

538
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,073
and then organize
that photo shoot for the new luggage line.

539
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:51,838
What's wrong with you today?

540
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,313
Here I am jumping through hoops

541
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,850
like a white horse in the circus.

542
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,680
That's what's wrong.

543
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,320
The only way that
we can finance your flying

544
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,119
is to make enough money
to finance your flying.

545
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,886
<i>::: Amelia Earhart!</i>

546
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,253
Go on out there.

547
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:21,774
<i>Thank you!</i>

548
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,943
<i>Thank you very much:</i>

549
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,022
Oh. Please! Miss Earhart?
An autograph, please.

550
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,319
Miss Earhart, please.

551
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,160
Miss Earhart?

552
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,164
- What's your name?
- Gore.

553
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,995
That's an unusual name.

554
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,161
I know. I don't much like it.

555
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,828
We blame his mother.

556
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,772
She was a Gore,
roots going back to colonial times.

557
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,001
Hello.

558
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,803
God, do I have to wade through that?

559
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,347
You will have two Vidal men
to protect you. You'll be fine.

560
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,849
You are so much prettier
than your pictures.

561
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,976
Well, thank you, but that...

562
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,316
Have you heard from Lindbergh?
What did he say?

563
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,514
"Well done. "

564
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,090
Are you gonna write another book?

565
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,659
Yes, if my husband
has anything to say about it.

566
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,727
Take my hand.

567
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,127
Come on, Gore.
Let's you and I lead Miss Earhart to safety.

568
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,413
You know, that woman was right.

569
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,351
- Excuse me?
- I felt the same way when I first met you.

570
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:40,218
You are much prettier than your pictures.

571
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:48,554
It all seems rather silly
considering what's happening out there.

572
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,156
Those men, all those families.

573
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,530
Why have I been given so much?

574
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,067
You've earned the spotlight. Enjoy it.

575
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:02,106
You'll be fine. Just hold on to yourself.

576
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,471
I'm not sure who that is anymore.

577
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,449
She's that girl
from Kansas who says "hooey. "

578
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,714
<i>Distinguished
dignitaries from every corner of the world,</i>

579
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,222
<i>please rise and welcome
Miss Amelia Earhart,</i>

580
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:52,955
<i>honored guest of President Roosevelt
and the League of American Pilots:</i>

581
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:55,858
I'd like to toast a world-class pilot

582
00:53:55,966 --> 00:54:00,266
who, at age 15, became the youngest
woman in the world to fly solo.

583
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:04,400
This year, she's recognized
as Woman Pilot of the Year.

584
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:08,877
Here's to Elinor Smith,
an inspiration to us all.

585
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,573
Your husband
encourages you to fly across the Atlantic.

586
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,710
My husband wouldn't want me
to fly to N Street.

587
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,681
So, he hasn't actually forbidden you?

588
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,292
Franklin doesn't forbid.

589
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,889
He just feels it's a waste
of my valuable time to learn

590
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,057
since I can't afford to buy a plane.

591
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,327
The wrong Roosevelt got elected.

592
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:40,276
I did ask about aviation,
but he hasn't decided on the structure yet.

593
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,804
It might be under the Bureau of Commerce.

594
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:47,372
I think the structure may be less important
than the man chosen to run it.

595
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:52,217
I'm sorry, my hearing's failing.
I missed the words "or woman"?

596
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,483
This may be one of those rare instances

597
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,492
when the most accomplished
candidate turns out to be male.

598
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,323
Is it a name I know?

599
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,861
Gene Vidal.

600
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,700
I love finding the exception
that proves the rule.

601
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,997
How do you feel about flying at night?

602
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,908
Whoa! There we are,
ladies and gentlemen, champagne.

603
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,416
Champagne to toast the first lady.

604
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,021
Put your hands on the wheel!

605
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,593
It's dual controls. No one'll ever know.

606
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:44,468
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to toast to you!

607
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:48,169
Oh. Dear God!

608
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:01,621
Good night.

609
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,033
Well, I shall never, ever forget this night.

610
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,797
She seems quite taken with you.

611
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,429
And vice-versa.

612
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:21,172
Then again, lots of people
are quite taken with you.

613
00:56:22,078 --> 00:56:25,104
If you're referring to Gene,
as I know you are,

614
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,115
I was able to get a word in for him,

615
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,151
to head the Aeronautics Branch.

616
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,514
How did it go?

617
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,418
It's her husband's decision, but I'm hopeful.

618
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:37,152
Gene is so fortunate
to have you in his corner, Amelia.

619
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,660
He'll help me and I'm helping him.

620
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:09,147
<i>You do something to me</i>

621
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:17,766
<i>Something that simply mystifies me</i>

622
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:26,398
<i>Tell me
Why should it be</i>

623
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:35,846
<i>You have the power to hypnotize me</i>

624
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,754
Transcontinental was too ambitious.

625
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,187
Too many hops, too tough on the ladies.

626
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,624
But the shuttle,
Washington, New York, Boston,

627
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,718
we think it's the future.

628
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,098
Will you go there with us?

629
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,662
What on earth would you need me for?

630
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,703
You're the most
famous woman in America, that's what for.

631
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:57,804
You know, I can see it now.

632
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:59,738
You on the poster with Gene,

633
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,606
a legendary athlete at West Point,

634
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,076
two events at the Olympics,

635
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:05,739
a top pilot who's gonna be running
the skies for Roosevelt when he wins.

636
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,646
Thanks, Paul.
I think you've even talked me out of it.

637
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:18,350
<i>Do, do that voodoo that you do so well:::</i>

638
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:37,309
May I ask you a question?

639
00:58:37,344 --> 00:58:37,839
May I ask you a question?

640
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,778
That woman over there.

641
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,109
She's beautiful.

642
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:49,414
You're the only woman I know
who points out other beautiful women.

643
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,225
Lovely legs,

644
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:54,857
unlike mine.

645
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,222
No, I'm sure that's not true.

646
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,528
That's why you wear trousers?

647
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,328
No.

648
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:06,198
And all this while I thought you just
wanted to be one of the boys.

649
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:10,210
I may have, at one time, but not anymore.

650
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,156
Was that Amelia Earhart?

651
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,200
Sixth floor, please.

652
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,110
Gore!

653
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,625
I couldn't wait
for your visit this weekend.

654
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,955
Lewis. Lewis.

655
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:15,362
Help! Tiger, tiger!

656
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,768
Ah. The wallpaper.

657
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,371
Coming, Gore.

658
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,080
It's okay.

659
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:32,277
Do you know
why I papered this room like this?

660
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,849
No. But I wish you hadn't.

661
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,319
It's because I'm very, very afraid of jungles.

662
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:46,399
So, when I find myself worrying about it,

663
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,599
I test my courage by coming into this room

664
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,836
and pretending I'm in the deepest,
darkest part of Africa.

665
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,808
<i>In a jungle so thick,
I can't even see the sky above:</i>

666
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,011
<i>And I start to feel better right away</i>

667
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:07,755
because I looked my fear right in the face.

668
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,234
Miss Earhart?

669
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:20,860
Yes?

670
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:24,170
Could you please marry my father?

671
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,409
Then I'll never be afraid
of anything ever again.

672
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,499
Aw.

673
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,377
I'm already married to Mr. Putnam.

674
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,814
Why can't you be married
to Mr. Putnam and my father?

675
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,489
I put together one month in Europe.

676
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:45,357
Had to close some foreign licensing deals,
open new markets.

677
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:46,428
When are you leaving?

678
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,430
Well, the thing is, I'd like you to come.

679
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,163
I don't see how I could.

680
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,132
Well, I've already spoken to the promoters.

681
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,796
They're willing to switch
some of the lecture dates, just for us.

682
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,703
Well, it's not just that.
There's my work on the shuttle.

683
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:03,978
I've just started as Gene's consultant
at the Aeronautics Branch.

684
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,815
Normally I'd be worried
about leaving you here alone,

685
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,945
but I suppose
that won't be a problem, will it?

686
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,183
What are you trying to say?

687
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,657
Gene, here in our house, when I am here,

688
01:03:24,767 --> 01:03:27,099
is one thing. When I am not here,

689
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,033
- I can't have it.
- I understand.

690
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,733
I can't have it.

691
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,402
Hello?

692
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,511
I found something you'd written.

693
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,609
Quite beautiful.

694
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:56,349
"To touch your hand
and see your face today is joy.

01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:02,855
<i>'"Your casual presence
in a room recalls the stars</i>

696
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,759

01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,851
<i>Thank you so much for writing that:</i>

701
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,948
Even though I'd never seen it.

702
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,987
At the time, I...

703
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,086
George?

704
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:54,543
George.

705
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,462
Thank you.

706
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:13,834
How are you?

707
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:20,569
I wondered if you
were avoiding me a little or...

708
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,473
Just very, very busy.

709
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,708
I'm leaving for Indiana.

710
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:32,754
Edward Elliott of Purdue wants me to build
a Women's Careers Department there.

711
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:35,187
That's a wonderful idea, especially now.

712
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,259
What's special about now?

713
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,320
You don't read the papers?

714
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,861
Not unless someone makes me.

715
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:42,089
Well, someone should.

716
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,632
They're all saying
you took recklessly dangerous solo flights

717
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:48,431
for no earthly purpose other than publicity,
meaning money.

718
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:52,234
They also harp on a growing list of
products you commercially endorse.

719
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,673
How thoughtless of me
to be doing all this in a society

720
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:58,440
where no one else is interested in making
money, present company included.

721
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:02,608
People viewing you as Lady Lindy,
America's sweetheart of the skies,

722
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:07,314
the wife, mother, daughter
they all wish they'd had, would be helpful.

723
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,548
Thanks for the tip.

724
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:10,852
Thanks for not being defensive.

725
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,928
I've decided I'm resigning as your
consultant at the Aeronautics Branch.

726
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,007
The public linking of our names does more
harm to that image of mine

727
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,473
than everything else put together.

728
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:31,144
And you, of all people,
should know that whatever I do,

729
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,112
I do so that I can fly.

730
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:38,642
And I want to fly
that beautiful bird as far as it will take me.

731
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:43,618
I'm going to fly around the world, Gene.

732
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,319
It can't be done.

733
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,860
Well, I'm going to try.

734
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,633
And I'm going home.

735
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,033
To George.

736
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:00,037
You can't mean that.

737
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:56,622
Race you to New York City.

738
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:07,538
Well, are you going to tell me your
surprise, or do I need to be physical?

739
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,941
Boy, that's exactly what I want.

740
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:14,481
Come on, G.P., tell me.

741
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,211
If you're serious about this
flying-around-the-world nonsense,

742
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,052
then it might be handy
to have a plane to fly in.

743
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,593
Except it would have to be an Electra,
and they cost...

744
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:29,755
$36,000, after a generous discount
from Lockheed.

745
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,332
It may as well be a billion.

746
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,924
Not to mention at least another $36,000

747
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,936
to have it modified and ready.

748
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:39,534
And your surprise is you robbed a bank?

749
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:43,904
No, actually, a university.

750
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,447
I persuaded Ed Elliott to create

751
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:51,418
an Amelia Earhart Fund
for Aeronautical Research at Purdue.

752
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:56,651
I suggested a budget amount of $80,000

753
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:59,626
for a suitable flying laboratory.

754
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,894
The Electra?

755
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,669
Your Electra, Amelia.

756
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:10,798
George!

757
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:20,608
Well, there is one thing. The trustees and
the donors, they have to be on board also.

758
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,184
Well, that's my job.
I'll do a series of lectures...

759
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:27,779
No, there will be no more horses,
no more hoops, for my Amelia.

760
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,718
Thank you, George.

761
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,596
Even if you don't care if she lives or dies,

762
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:37,165
you know her death
will not be a plus for aviation women,

763
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,733
or your next campaign.

764
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:40,631
What if she doesn't die?

765
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:44,900
What if she just circumnavigates
the globe and it's a plus for everyone?

766
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,942
The closest land west of Hawaii is
beyond the range of the Electra.

767
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,135
She'll refuel in the air.

768
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,906
She doesn't have the flying skills.

769
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,378
She's taking bigger risks.

770
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,312
Yes. I'm aware of that.
Don't be so proud of it.

771
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,145
I understand the danger, fellas.

772
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,483
I've studied the route.
What have you come up with?

773
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,256
This is Howland Island.

774
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:08,557
It's halfway
between Honolulu and New Guinea.

775
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,026
It has no elevation, no trees,

776
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:14,261
hardly anyone knows or cares that it exists.

777
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,897
It would be
almost impossible to spot from the air.

778
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:22,569
It's really tiny, like a grain of sand
in a thousand miles of nowhere.

779
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:26,876
If you miss this island,
you're out of fuel with 2,000 miles to go.

780
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:30,917
But I'll have Fred Noonan,
the best celestial navigator around.

781
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,648
In fact,
she's taking Fred along for the whole trip.

782
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,418
Giving up my little arrogance about solo.

783
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,286
Safety first, yes?

784
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:45,224
You've always had Amelia's
best interest at heart.

785
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:47,928
And for that, we're both grateful.

786
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,262
Stay for supper?

787
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,265
I'd like to, but I'd better be getting back.

788
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:56,969
Please tell Gore hello for me.

789
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:03,118
Give him this. He can track the time zones.

790
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,685
He misses you.

791
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,702
He doesn't understand, really.

792
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:46,159
Is the new gasket up to spec, Jim?

793
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,523
Everything's good, Miss Earhart.

794
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,499
Hello, Fred.

795
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:55,570
Ma'am.

796
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,536
- Good to see you.
- And you.

797
01:13:00,309 --> 01:13:01,606
Thank you.

798
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,344
Are we sizing me up?

799
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:16,816
I'm told midair refueling
would be beyond my abilities.

800
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,621
You have to put in time,
learn the technique.

801
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:23,425
Even so, 20%, it works, 20%, you crash,

802
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:26,865
60%, you don't get the fuel,
so you're cooked anyway.

803
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:33,374
Better odds of hitting that island?

804
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:36,267
How do you feel about 100%?

805
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,574
Even with cloud cover?

806
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,514
Pan Am told you I'm the best
celestial navigator they've ever seen.

807
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,710
They did.

808
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,913
Someone else told you
I got a drinking problem.

809
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:49,923
Which is a big part
of why we're here, right?

810
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,322
Everyone I ever worked for will tell you,

811
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,057
nothing's interfered
with my performance, not once.

812
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:58,999
We'd be looking for
an island less than two miles long,

813
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,864
with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.

814
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,766
That's what you'd be looking for.

815
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,032
I'd be looking for coordinates on a map.

816
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,433
How can I lose?

817
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:17,909
<i>Amelia Earhart
leaves Oakland for Honolulu,</i>

818
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:22,320
<i>setting out on the most
dangerous aeronautic feat ever attempted:</i>

819
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:25,723
<i>To traverse the waistline of the world:</i>

820
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,298
How about
a smile for the people back in the States?

821
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,833
Miss Earhart, look this way.

822
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,840
Thank you.
- Thank you.

823
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,042
Take care of her, Fred.

824
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,408
That's great. Thanks.

825
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:48,949
One big one
for the camera, Miss Amelia!

826
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:52,851
You know, we've got so much fuel
we can't possibly get off the ground.

827
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,718
Much safer than flying.

828
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:57,348
Well, we'll need enough
for a third pass at Howland

829
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:00,087
after you miss it
the first couple times around.

830
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,753
Good thinking.

831
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,263
Thank you!

832
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:07,265
One more,
please, Miss Earhart.

833
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,699
Right here, Amelia!

834
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,297
Good luck, Fred!
Good luck, Amelia!

835
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,439
Clear!

836
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,013
No!

837
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:06,621
You all right?

838
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:09,486
Good reaction cutting the switch!
You saved our ass!

839
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,417
Come on, Fred!

840
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:23,938
Right engine, get the right
engine! Hose on there, right underneath.

841
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,974
- We need tetrachloride here.
- Pyrene, pyrene.

842
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,542
Sam,
make sure you get a picture of that.

843
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:35,640
Make sure
you get a good shot of their faces!

844
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,853
Turn her up. Okay, go.

845
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,552
I'll make it good, G.P., I swear to you I will.

846
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,748
I'll make it back and more, I promise.

847
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,256
The book sales, the lectures,

848
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,522
this flight
will keep us going another three years.

849
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:22,690
Maybe.

850
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,823
No, it will, I promise.

851
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:28,228
Our sales, our prices are going to double.

852
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,270
This just showed them
how dangerous it all is.

853
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,532
They were taking it for granted.

854
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,766
They thought I was competent.

855
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,205
Here.

856
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:37,335
I meant, maybe...

857
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,572
Maybe we can just stop it.

858
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,309
You mean after?

859
01:18:46,755 --> 01:18:48,222
Or even now.

860
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:56,188
So my exit would be a stupid crash

861
01:18:57,299 --> 01:19:00,359
and withdrawing from
a world-publicized attempt

862
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:03,529
to finally do something
no man had done before.

863
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,567
It would ruin us in the bargain.

864
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:07,801
- Mmm-hmm. Yes.
- We'd have nothing.

865
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:09,638
Mmm-hmm. It's true.

866
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,671
And I'd be fine with that.

867
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,048
That's because you're an idiot.

868
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:22,156
Lucky for you.

869
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,987
And what if it's
not something I need to show the world?

870
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:34,097
What if it's something I need to show me?

871
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:47,075
I don't really have a choice,
I have to reverse the route.

872
01:19:47,182 --> 01:19:50,447
I'd be facing hurricanes in the
Caribbean, monsoons in Africa.

873
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,918
Yeah, but you'll be flying Howland last.

874
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,420
- When I'm most tired.
- Yeah.

875
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,582
So, I just won't get tired.

876
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,861
What's the timetable on the plane?

877
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,324
Three weeks. She'll be good as new.

878
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:06,423
We have a remarkable crew here.

879
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,093
- The best that money can...
- Money can buy.

880
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,693
...buy, yeah.

881
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,163
All the money wasted
that's never coming back.

882
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:13,832
You cut the engines.

883
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:17,935
It would've cost a bundle more
to replace a burnt-out plane.

884
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:21,207
Not to mention a burnt-up pilot.

885
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:22,749
I overreacted.

886
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:26,480
The plane was too heavy, I should've used
more rudder instead of the throttle. I...

887
01:20:26,588 --> 01:20:28,283
It's only money.

888
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:32,049
We'll figure this out. We always do.

889
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:54,913
Have you considered, Miss Earhart,
that your enthusiasm as a pilot

890
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:59,510
outweighs your ability, as demonstrated
by the disaster in Honolulu?

891
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:01,350
People are saying that you're reckless,

892
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:03,185
a better celebrity than pilot.

893
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,626
Enthusiastic? Yes.

894
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:08,821
Reckless? Not on your life.

895
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:12,991
I'm a flier pursuing my passion
for the fun of it, that's all.

896
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:16,399
Thank you. A future flier!

897
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:26,712
You can do it, Amelia!

898
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:28,375
Mr. Noonan, over here!
Miss Earhart!

899
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,144
We love you, Amelia!

900
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,828
<i>She will fly the world's full circumference,</i>

901
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:46,697
<i>24,902 miles,
to travel across the South Atlantic,</i>

902
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:50,464
<i>crossing Africa, over India,
and across the wide Pacific:::</i>

903
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,472
After this 'round-the-world flight,
Miss Earhart,

904
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,542
are you gonna give up long-distance flying?

905
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,702
Not while there's still life left in me.

906
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:58,676
Always ready for a new adventure.

907
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:00,270
Great, great.

908
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:01,371
Fred, you're on.

909
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,883
Hey, Fred,
give us a big smile for the camera!

910
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,289
Come back to me.

911
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,924
Always.

912
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,616
Hurry up, come on! Hurry up!

913
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,516
Miss Earhart!
Just one more picture, please!

914
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,747
Just one more, please!

915
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,551
Miss Earhart,
over here! Miss Earhart!

916
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,795
See you.

917
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:27,000
<i>A fairyland of
beauty lay below and about me</i>

918
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:31,801
<i>so lovely as to distract
a pilot's attention from the task at hand,</i>

919
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:36,302
<i>that of herding a heavy plane
out of that great upland saucer</i>

920
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:39,209
<i>and over the mountains that make its rim:</i>

921
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,254
What is this thing, huh?

922
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:25,451
Whole thing's made of mud.

923
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,221
It's beautiful.

924
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:40,240
It's like working with you.

925
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:45,173
Come on, Amelia.

926
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,489
<i>Amelia Earhart has
reached Calcutta:::</i>

927
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:01,789
Dad! Dad! It's a bulletin!

928
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:03,796
<i>::: But heavy rains have
temporarily grounded her:</i>

929
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:06,458
<i>She will push on to Bangkok,
then Papua New Guinea</i>

930
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:10,436
<i>before heading east
toward her final destination, California:</i>

931
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:16,601
We should go, Fred.

932
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,872
Oh, come on! You're not really taking off?

933
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,005
It's only going to get heavier.

934
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,949
We could be stuck here for days,
even weeks.

935
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:26,919
It's only 700 miles to Bangkok,
it's lighter there.

936
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:30,457
To get that far in a monsoon,
you'd need divine help!

937
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:31,547
Chai?

938
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:32,648
Thank you.

939
01:25:36,865 --> 01:25:38,025
Come on, Fred.

940
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:09,396
You think we should turn back, huh?

941
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,522
Nope. I think we shouldn't have come.

942
01:26:38,876 --> 01:26:40,104
Hi, Joan.

943
01:26:40,211 --> 01:26:41,735
Hello, Frances.

944
01:26:59,197 --> 01:27:01,256
You look beat, lady.

945
01:27:01,365 --> 01:27:03,356
That's funny, you look tip-top.

946
01:27:03,467 --> 01:27:05,867
Why don't you grab a few hours of sleep?

947
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,165
Might as well keep you company.

948
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,433
I've got some good flying stories.

949
01:27:11,642 --> 01:27:12,700
Thank you.

950
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:13,936
Yeah.

951
01:27:16,514 --> 01:27:20,006
You and your old George.
That's a touching love story.

952
01:27:23,254 --> 01:27:25,654
An honest one, if I say so myself.

953
01:27:29,527 --> 01:27:31,688
I wonder if it's honest enough for George.

954
01:27:32,663 --> 01:27:35,996
If you mean Gene,
we're not together anymore.

955
01:27:36,734 --> 01:27:39,202
In that way. Not for a long time.

956
01:27:40,271 --> 01:27:42,000
You don't think I love my husband?

957
01:27:42,473 --> 01:27:43,599
Actually, I do.

958
01:27:44,642 --> 01:27:46,234
In a certain way.

959
01:27:47,578 --> 01:27:49,205
But you disapprove of how I live?

960
01:27:49,313 --> 01:27:50,575
Hell, no.

961
01:27:51,115 --> 01:27:54,846
It's just like me.
In fact, it's like most guys I know.

962
01:27:54,952 --> 01:27:56,146
Meaning?

963
01:27:57,121 --> 01:27:59,919
Guys love their wives, their girlfriends.

964
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:02,618
Doesn't mean they don't take advantage

965
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:06,823
of an opportunity.

966
01:28:13,604 --> 01:28:15,936
If you have a point, make it.

967
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,632
I believe I have.

968
01:28:24,915 --> 01:28:28,476
All you need to do
is just show up tomorrow morning,

969
01:28:28,586 --> 01:28:30,247
show up sober,

970
01:28:30,354 --> 01:28:32,049
and get me to Howland Island.

971
01:28:53,711 --> 01:28:55,201
Ready, ma'am.

972
01:28:58,115 --> 01:28:59,480
Thank you.

973
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:12,420
Feel like stepping out for a smoke?

974
01:29:12,897 --> 01:29:14,330
Oh, I don't smoke.

975
01:29:15,032 --> 01:29:17,262
Or something?

976
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,113
Earhart here.

977
01:29:31,816 --> 01:29:33,306
<i>Putnam here:</i>

978
01:29:37,054 --> 01:29:38,544
You should be sleeping.

979
01:29:40,558 --> 01:29:42,389
You should be working.

980
01:29:43,027 --> 01:29:44,358
I'm running a big adventure here.

981
01:29:44,862 --> 01:29:46,625
<i>I'm a very important fellow:</i>

982
01:29:47,231 --> 01:29:52,100
You told me I was the star
and you'd be nearby,

983
01:29:52,203 --> 01:29:55,570
<i>a small particle of dust
in my constellation:</i>

984
01:29:57,775 --> 01:30:01,233
I thought I was joking.
Guess the joke's on me.

985
01:30:04,749 --> 01:30:07,582
I'll be in Honolulu on the third

986
01:30:07,685 --> 01:30:10,677
and with you in Oakland
on the Fourth of July, okay?

987
01:30:12,022 --> 01:30:13,421
Don't keep me waiting.

988
01:30:14,425 --> 01:30:15,722
I won't dare.

989
01:30:17,595 --> 01:30:19,290
How's Fred? On the wagon?

990
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,664
I sent you my movies to lighten the plane.

991
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:28,233
You wouldn't sell a salesman, would you?

992
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,605
Fred is fine.

993
01:30:30,708 --> 01:30:33,836
He's calculating
headwind speed versus fuel as we speak.

994
01:30:34,612 --> 01:30:37,172
So what's that I hear in your voice?

995
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:41,044
<i>Is he drinking?</i>

996
01:30:41,685 --> 01:30:42,674
I can handle it.

997
01:30:42,887 --> 01:30:45,720
All right, call it off. Call it off now.

998
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:48,752
<i>Right now, Amelia: I mean it: Right now:</i>

999
01:30:53,164 --> 01:30:54,722
I can handle it.

1000
01:30:58,536 --> 01:31:01,061
After the Fourth, we're going home.

1001
01:31:02,973 --> 01:31:04,270
Where is that?

1002
01:31:05,075 --> 01:31:08,067
For me? Anywhere you are.

1003
01:31:16,987 --> 01:31:19,046
I'm going to like it there.

1004
01:31:23,093 --> 01:31:25,891
I'd better,
since this is going to be my last flight.

1005
01:31:28,933 --> 01:31:30,525
If you insist.

1006
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:37,669
I love you.

1007
01:31:54,325 --> 01:31:55,690
Should I let you go now?

1008
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:57,458
No, never.

1009
01:32:07,238 --> 01:32:09,968
I'll go tell the world you're on your way.

1010
01:32:11,842 --> 01:32:13,104
See you,

1011
01:32:15,346 --> 01:32:16,779
my darling.

1012
01:32:23,087 --> 01:32:24,850
See you, my love.

1013
01:33:05,396 --> 01:33:07,421
It looks like she's ready to leave.

1014
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:27,449
Might be easier to just shoot me.

1015
01:33:27,551 --> 01:33:29,416
Traveling light, is all.

1016
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,387
You got room for 180 pounds of asshole?

1017
01:33:36,026 --> 01:33:38,426
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

1018
01:33:39,997 --> 01:33:42,830
It's fine. Everything is.

1019
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:53,870
- Have you filled the other side?
- Mmm-hmm.

1020
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:17,959
<i>Not more than a month ago,
I was on the other shore of the Pacific,</i>

1021
01:34:18,068 --> 01:34:19,968
<i>looking westward:</i>

1022
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:23,005
<i>This morning,
I look eastward over the Pacific:</i>

1023
01:34:23,107 --> 01:34:26,099
<i>In these fast-moving days
that have intervened,</i>

1024
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:29,611
<i>the whole width of the world
has passed behind us</i>

1025
01:34:29,713 --> 01:34:32,238
<i>except this broad ocean:</i>

1026
01:34:32,349 --> 01:34:36,547
<i>I shall be glad when we have
the hazards of this navigation behind us:</i>

1027
01:34:37,087 --> 01:34:39,783
Mr. Balfour, come in, over.

1028
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:41,152
Mr. Putnam.

1029
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:43,920
The headwinds were stronger
than they knew when they took off.

1030
01:34:44,495 --> 01:34:48,261
<i>I recalculated the fuel:
Lt'll cost them nine percent:</i>

1031
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:52,292
Nine percent.

1032
01:35:01,078 --> 01:35:04,309
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?

1033
01:35:06,984 --> 01:35:10,010
King How Able Queen Queen.
Can you read me?

1034
01:35:15,893 --> 01:35:17,724
<i>Mr: Putnam, I can't reach them, sir:</i>

1035
01:35:18,495 --> 01:35:20,656
I tried voice and Morse Code.

1036
01:35:20,764 --> 01:35:24,325
No, forget Morse Code.
They didn't take the receiver.

1037
01:35:24,435 --> 01:35:26,903
Just stay with voice. You'll get them.

1038
01:35:50,561 --> 01:35:52,222
At ease, sailor.

1039
01:35:56,467 --> 01:35:59,925
The direction finder.
How long has this been left on?

1040
01:36:03,941 --> 01:36:05,704
The battery's dead.

1043
01:36:27,498 --> 01:36:29,625
That's her, on 3105.

1044
01:36:30,234 --> 01:36:31,997
She said "cloudy and overcast. "

1045
01:36:47,017 --> 01:36:48,450
<i>Itasca, this is Earhart.</i>

1046

<i>Itasca, this is Earhart.

1050
01:37:13,076 --> 01:37:16,204
<i>Earhart, this is Itasca:
Did you receive transmission?</i>

1051
01:37:21,451 --> 01:37:24,784
King How Able Queen Queen.
Please acknowledge our signals on key.

Please acknowledge. Over.

1053

Over.

1062
01:38:05,762 --> 01:38:07,593
She's got to stay on longer.

1063
01:38:07,698 --> 01:38:09,859
On air too briefly, bearing's impossible.

1064
01:38:45,569 --> 01:38:47,298
Maybe her Morse receiver's out.

1070
01:39:36,486 --> 01:39:38,613
They should
be able to see that for 20 miles at least.

<i>Itasca, this is King How Able Queen Queen:</i>

Please take bearing on us
and answer on 3105 with voice. Over.

1082
01:40:56,033 --> 01:40:57,625
Your signal received okay.

1083

It is impossible to take a bearing on 3105

<i>Miss Earhart has
finally received transmission from Itasca.</i>

1088

Keep us at 7500.
That's her only acknowledgment.

1089
01:41:29,466 --> 01:41:32,731
You've got her signal, damn it.
What about the direction finder?

1090
01:41:32,836 --> 01:41:35,634
Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir.

1091
01:41:35,739 --> 01:41:38,708
It was left on all night,
so we can't track her.

please come in and reply on 500?
