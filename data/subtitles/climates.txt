2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,150
- Are you bored?
- No.

3
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,033
CLIMATES

4
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,832
Should we give Arif a call?

5
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,595
Bahar!

6
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,629
Sure.

7
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,392
- Semra, dinner was great. Thanks.
- I hope you enjoyed it.

8
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,076
- How about some coffee?
- How do you take it?

9
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,909
- Medium-sweet for me.
- Me too.

10
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,115
Arif, it must be interesting living
here.

11
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,398
- It's kind of boring actually.
- Why are you living here then?

12
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,192
What else can I do?

13
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,630
The weather's great
but that's about it.

14
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,869
If there were a few more people
like us around...

15
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,592
Why don't you come down
more often?

16
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,037
Actually this is the first time
we've been away in years.

17
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,353
Bahar has that TV series.

18
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,235
The schedule's always up in the air.
And I have the university, you know.

19
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,757
I'm free in summer
but then Bahar is usually busy.

20
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,397
What's your job on the series,
Bahar?

21
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,114
Art director.

22
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,676
Is that the one with Ugur Yucel?

23
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,549
No, that's a different series.
There are no big names in ours.

24
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,113
It's getting cold.

25
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,430
- Aren't you cold?
- No, I'm fine.

26
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,639
- Why don't you put your jacket on?
- I told you, I'm fine.

27
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,635
You seem kind of fed up.
What's wrong?

28
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,829
What's going on?

29
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,189
Is there a problem?

30
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,593
Why are you using that tone?

31
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,433
Why do you keep nagging?

32
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,193
If I am nagging, it's for your own
good, isn't it?

33
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,315
If I was cold,
I'd be wearing the thing anyway.

34
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,994
Can't we go anywhere
without you making problems?

35
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,631
Hey, come on!
Don't go over the top.

36
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,508
Don't worry.
They enjoy seeing us miserable.

37
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,477
Come on.
You wrecked dinner, then...

38
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,631
No. It's OK. Don't worry.

39
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,433
Hey, come on, guys!

40
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,079
Just forget it.

41
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,389
So you can hear the waves
all the way up here.

42
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,876
- Is that the sea just down there?
- Yes, it's right there.

43
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,916
- Just behind those trees?
- Yes.

44
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,794
Kas has got so big.

45
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,355
I came here back in 1977.
There was nothing here then.

46
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,154
It's tourism. The Germans started
coming. So then...

47
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,869
- I worked as a waiter here.
- Really?

48
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,679
Shall we go for a swim?

49
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,315
What, now?

50
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,078
- Yes.
- You'll freeze.

51
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,431
Are you crazy? For God's sake!
Where do you get these ideas?

52
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,718
Why not if you want. But...

53
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,071
Forget it. It would be bad for
Isa's neck.

54
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,958
It's late.
Let's have our coffee and get going.

55
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,718
Semra, where's the coffee?

56
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,199
- You can stay here if you like.
- No, it's OK. The hotel's fine.

57
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,432
- Are you comfortable there?
- Yes.

58
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,309
I love you.

59
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,635
What's up?
You're covered in sweat.

60
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,359
I must have fallen asleep.

61
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,989
You shouldn't be sleeping in the
sun. It's really dangerous.

62
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,589
Bahar.

63
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,753
I want to say something,
but please don't get the wrong idea.

64
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,830
Maybe we should go
our own ways for a bit.

65
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,315
What do you think?

66
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,795
We'd still be good friends. I mean, it
wouldn't change things a lot.

67
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,076
We'd still go out together,
go out for dinner, go to the movies.

68
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,188
We don't have to be friends.
I don't mind.

69
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,391
Come on, Bahar.
Don't be like that for God's sake.

70
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,791
This would be better for you as well.

71
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,992
Even that meaningless "Serap"
incident has screwed you up.

72
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,837
You call it meaningless?

73
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,434
For God's sake,
don't get started on that again.

74
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,351
It's better that way for you as well.
You know it yourself.

75
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,720
You don't have to worry about me.
I'll be fine.

76
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,158
That's what I mean.
You're young. You're attractive...

77
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,476
You can get all the men you want.

78
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,873
Maybe it's true what you said.
Maybe I am too old for you.

79
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,469
The age difference
really has become a problem.

80
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,834
It just isn't working.
We can't seem to get along.

81
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,075
I don't need convincing, you know.
I agree with you.

82
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,992
I'm not trying to convince you,
just to point out the facts.

83
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,759
You know I'm right.

84
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,674
Are you crazy?
Are you trying to kill us both?

85
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,394
If you're that keen to die,
shall I throw you off?

86
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,957
- Shall I throw you off?
- Get off me!

87
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,431
Get off me!

88
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,715
Come back here.

89
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,515
Bahar!

90
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,829
Come back!

91
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,675
Fucking hell!

92
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,828
Your baggage receipt.

93
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,794
Don't lose it.

94
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,072
Do you have a sweater with you?
It gets really cold at night.

95
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,229
Yes, I do.

96
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,714
- OK then. Have a good trip.
- Thanks.

97
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,992
I'll call you when I'm back in
Istanbul.

98
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,315
- Don't.

99
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,399
- What?
- Don't call.

100
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,989
OK, people.

101
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,550
I want you to compare the
architecture of these two temples.

102
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,959
You have 15 minutes.
Any questions?

103
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,471
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

104
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,111
- How did the exam go?
- OK.

105
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,798
Who switched on my computer?

106
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,229
I have no idea.

107
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,912
Probably one of your students.

108
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,435
- Come on! Was it you?
- No! Why would I switch it on?

109
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,676
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, I have to.

110
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,511
I'm going to an art exhibition with
Plnar. Join us if you like.

111
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,117
Thanks, but no. I want to read
through these exam papers.

112
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,833
Can't you do that later?

113
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,751
I don't like taking work home.
I'll get it done here.

114
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,189
I've booked the court for Saturday.
Hopefully that's OK with you.

115
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,914
What if it rains?

116
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,038
Always excuses. If it rains, it rains!

117
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,470
In that case, we play even if it
snows.

118
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,829
OK. It's a deal.

119
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,473
- No getting out of it.
- No.

120
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,670
- We'll even go for a swim.
- In the sea?

121
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,119
All right, we'll do that too.

122
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,788
OK, see you then.

123
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,515
- Let's have coffee before you go.
- I don't have time, honestly.

124
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,548
She'll only complain if I am late.
I should go.

125
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,035
- OK. Have a good time.
- Thanks.

126
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,915
Isa?
Isa!

127
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,316
- Hey, how are you?
- Great.

128
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,317
- What are you up to?
- Same as ever. Work and all that.

129
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,878
- You're still in advertising?
- Yes. They won't let me go.

130
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,995
- Hey, Serap! How are you?
- Fine. And you?

131
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,512
Fine. It's so nice that you're still
together after all this time.

132
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,914
Did you get married?

133
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,799
I have an hour to kill.
Shall we have a drink together?

134
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,869
Let's see.

135
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,432
No. Sorry.
I have to meet someone.

136
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,030
Come on.
We hardly ever run into each other.

137
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,231
- I can't. But let's be in touch.
- OK.

138
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,034
- Don't forget though.
- You never call either.

139
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,597
Neither do you.
We're both as bad as each other.

140
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,829
- How are you doing?
- OK.

141
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,110
We're just looking at books and
magazines.

142
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,637
- OK. I'll see you then.
- See you. Take care.

143
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,352
Hey, the place has changed.

144
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,998
Why are you looking at me like that?
I can leave, if you want.

145
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,190
How did you know
I'd come home alone?

146
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,915
Guven said so, didn't he?
At the bookstore.

147
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,351
And I guess I wanted to try my luck.

148
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,796
Aren't you going to offer me
anything?

149
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,153
You want something to drink?

150
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,709
What should I have?

151
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,313
Something alcoholic?

152
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,959
Have whatever you want.

153
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,188
OK, I'll have coffee.

154
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,515
It's coffee then.

155
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,838
Then we'll move on to wine.
OK?

156
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,829
Sure.

157
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,472
You haven't been around
for a while.

158
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,752
Is Bahar out of town again?

159
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,352
What's it got to do with Bahar?

160
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,159
What are you trying to say?

161
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,555
What are you laughing at for God's
sake?

162
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,116
OK, OK. Calm down!

163
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,429
I am.

164
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,233
- These are stale.
- Don't eat them then.

165
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,389
Open your mouth.

166
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,991
How can you wear those pointed
shoes? They're so ugly.

167
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,075
I like them.

168
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,949
You want it?

169
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,193
- Nothing's wrong with it.
- No!

170
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,915
- Don't be so picky.
- It's been on the floor.

171
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,153
- So? The floor's clean. Go on.
- I told you, I don't want it.

172
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,875
There, it's done.

173
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,835
That's much better.

174
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,677
I was treading on them before.

175
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,314
They're just right now.

176
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,034
- Was there anything else?
- No, that's it. Thanks.

177
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,468
You're welcome.

178
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,716
I have to go, Mum. I'm running late.

179
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,673
I'm still working on my thesis.
I have to meet someone.

180
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,991
- You haven't eaten anything.
- I'm not hungry yet.

181
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,394
I can eat at home.

182
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,268
- Drop by now and again.
- I can't but I will try.

183
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,353
If I could just finish my thesis...

184
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,231
I still could not complete
lectorship thesis.

185
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,635
You should be thinking
about having children.

186
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,039
Come on, Mum.
Don't keep going on about that.

187
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,879
What does it matter
if I do or don't have children?

188
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,718
- Of course it matters.
- Why?

189
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,717
We're not getting any younger.

190
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,756
Who knows
how much longer we'll be around.

191
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,350
Having children adds
so much to your life.

192
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,273
But I don't even like kids.

193
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,240
It's different when they're your own
children.

194
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,871
Now, it may seem like that.
Just wait and see.

195
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,479
Dad, why are you wearing
that hat?

196
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,797
That's a new habit. He even wears
it when guests come over.

197
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,639
This hat has more uses than you
think.

198
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,390
For one, it protects the blood
vessels.

199
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,474
It makes the blood thinner
so it flows more easily.

200
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,712
Well, don't get too used to it, Dad.

201
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,595
He'll soon need another hat on top
whenever he goes outside.

202
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,468
As he wears one inside home,
that won't be sufficient outside.

203
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,631
I keep telling him but he never
listens.

204
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,433
It's late. I'd better be going.

205
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,669
Come and visit more often.

206
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,396
That was in.

207
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,795
What do you mean?
It was definitely out.

208
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,351
It looked to me like
it was on the line.

209
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,595
Are you blind?

210
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,832
So we'd planned the whole
wedding.

211
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,634
Imagine, everything's ready.

212
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,279
We go out for dinner one night.

213
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,634
Then suddenly, what do I see?

214
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,710
A finger wagging in my face.

215
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,428
That's a great image.

216
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,909
Unbelievable!

217
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,231
I said to myself,
just get out while the going's good.

218
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,630
I walked out and that was it.
Really!

219
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,479
I just left her like that.

220
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,197
That dress looks great on you.

221
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,839
- Really?
- Yes, really.

222
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,039
I like it a lot too.

223
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,958
You look good in black.

224
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,669
Thank you.

225
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,991
Guven got it for me in London.

226
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,035
Yes.

227
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,759
The bastard has good taste.

228
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,758
Why's he gone to Kazakhstan?

229
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,477
He's setting up an advertising
agency there. With a few friends.

230
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,228
That's why he has gone.

231
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,716
God! The stuff he gets into!

232
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,388
When does he get back?

233
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,870
- In a week or so.
- That's good.

234
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,632
So you're free for a whole week.

235
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,589
What's Bahar up to?

236
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,269
She's OK.

237
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,395
Does she come back to Istanbul
now and then?

238
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,918
- Where from?
- From the east.

239
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,593
What do you mean "the east"?

240
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,355
I heard she's working on a TV series
there.

241
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:51,755
Who told you that?

242
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,550
Nevzat. I ran into him the other day
at the opening of Istanbul Modern.

243
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,199
- We had a little chat. He told me.
- Who's Nevzat?

244
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,951
The architect, you know.

245
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,879
You mean Nevzat Sayln?

246
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,029
- How does he know?
- I've no idea.

247
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,309
When has she gone?

248
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,469
I really don't know.
Wait, didn't you know?

249
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,429
No.

250
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,989
Why not?

251
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,395
I just didn't.

252
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,349
We broke up.

253
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,919
Come on!
I don't believe you.

254
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,668
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.

255
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,711
Weren't you together
when you last came here?

256
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,232
Well, why didn't you say so?

257
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,915
You didn't ask.

258
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,750
How was I supposed to know
you'd split up?

259
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,358
- So why did you break up?
- It happened ages ago. In Kas.

260
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,957
Back in the summer
when we were in Kas.

261
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,434
Go on! What happened then?
I love hearing about break-ups.

262
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,232
Forget it.
It's a long story.

263
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,631
It's all dust and ashes.
Just like the song.

264
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,234
- Can I have more wine? It's good.
- Sure.

265
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,509
That tastes good.

266
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,669
Thanks.

267
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,154
An earthquake has occurred
but I didn't catch where.

268
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,798
I wonder if it was here in Turkey?

269
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,639
Are you going to watch that?

270
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,994
No. It's Cuneyt Ozdemir's thing but...

271
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,075
Come over here.

272
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,869
My wife...

273
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,995
The earthquake...

274
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,680
I thought you said she wagged
her finger in your face?

275
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,954
Well, you should see Plnar now.
She's meek as a lamb.

276
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,238
There's no more wagging fingers.

277
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,309
Believe me.

278
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,834
After I walked out that evening
she got really scared.

279
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,597
It's the truth, honestly.
She knows where she stands now.

280
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,598
Maybe she will revert to...

281
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,440
...her old ways after marriage.
No chance of that.

282
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,274
The girl's terrified!

283
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,314
The way I acted that night
she really thought it was all over.

284
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,991
So, that is difficult for her to do.

285
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,799
I wouldn't be so sure.

286
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,877
What are you doing
for the winter holiday?

287
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,908
Maybe take a trip to Russia,
but we're not sure yet.

288
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,991
Are you crazy?
At this time of year?

289
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,391
Well I promised Plnar some time ago
so I have to go through with it.

290
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,477
What are you up to?
You have any plans?

291
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,397
Wow! A trip to the sun, huh?

292
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,477
I need some decent weather.

293
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,432
The cold here gets to my bones.

294
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,711
You'll get bored on your own.

295
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,913
Why would I get bored?

296
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,597
I've been dreaming of a trip on my
own for years.

297
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,829
I'm sure to meet someone there
anyway.

298
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,513
It sounds good at first,
but the more I think about it...

299
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:25,432
I find places like that a bit vacuous
and kind of empty.

300
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,755
What places?

301
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,998
Faraway places.
Especially when I'm on my own.

302
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,195
Other countries.

303
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,397
But you're going to another country.

304
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,751
But at least I have Plnar with me.

305
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,717
Come on! You'll be fighting every
day. Just wait and see.

306
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,311
No, we won't. Not any more.

307
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,159
Hopefully you're right.

308
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,636
I have a class to go to.

309
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,999
The students will be waiting.

310
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,632
- Are you here after class?
- Yes. I'll be around.

311
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,991
- I'll see you later then.
- Have a good class.

312
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,309
Thanks.

313
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,759
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

314
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,995
- Do you have a room?
- Yes.

315
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,679
- How much?
- 20 lira.

316
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,231
- Isn't the lift working?
- No.

317
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,553
- How much is this?
- 25 lira.

318
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,588
- Are there any different tunes?
- Sorry. No.

319
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,716
I called but your number's changed,
I guess.

320
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,035
Yes. It has.

321
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,760
- How long have you been here?
- Four months.

322
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,674
Really? It's been a long time.

323
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,356
Haven't you been back to Istanbul at
all?

324
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:30,959
When did you get here?

325
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,995
Yesterday.

326
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,274
Where are you staying?

327
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,475
At the Ortadogu Hotel.
Across the river.

328
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,509
- You look well.
- I am.

329
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,828
You look well too.

330
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,189
I guess I'm OK.

331
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,195
- What photographs did you bring?
- What?

332
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,958
What photographs did you bring?

333
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,196
The ones from Kas.

334
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,157
I happened to see them in my PC.

335
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,870
I thought I might run into you here.
That's why I brought them with me.

336
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,198
- I got this for you.
- What is it?

337
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,436
I found it wandering around last
night.

338
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,314
- It's nice.
- Smuggled in from Dubai.

339
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,835
It's nice.

340
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,191
There's so much smuggled stuff
here.

341
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,315
Yes, Cenk?

342
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,599
I gave them to Zafer.

343
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,672
What do you mean they're not there?

344
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,555
OK, I'll call him right away... OK.

345
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,789
Sorry.

346
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,396
- Is there a problem?
- No, not really.

347
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,875
Hello, Zafer?

348
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,556
Don't you have
the Aga's costume for today?

349
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,311
But you told Cenk
you didn't have it.

350
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,957
Can't you get anything done?

351
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,348
When are we leaving?

352
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,838
OK. OK then.

353
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,555
Sorry.

354
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,238
Shall I get you another tea?

355
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,273
No, I have to go.
I should leave in a minute.

356
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,313
What happened with your thesis?

357
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,678
I still haven't finished it.

358
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,758
I want to photograph the ruins
at Ishakpasha tomorrow.

359
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,795
I thought the photos would look
good in the thesis.

360
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,714
I thought I could drop by on you
while I was here.

361
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,149
Right.

362
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,910
OK.
I'll be going then.

363
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,631
- Will I see you this evening?
- Unlikely. We don't return till late.

364
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,952
That's OK. I'll wait up for you.

365
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,718
How much longer are you here?

366
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:11,915
I don't know.

367
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,798
- OK.
- What?

368
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,273
- I'm going.
- OK.

369
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,074
- Give me a call anyway.
- I won't have time.

370
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,114
- I don't have a spare minute.
- All right then. OK.

371
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,430
- Good luck with your work.
- You too.

372
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,511
Excuse me.
You're crew, aren't you?

373
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,675
Yes.

374
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,075
- Can you give this to Bahar?
- She's in the van.

375
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,349
- That van?
- Yes.

376
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,198
Or I'll give it to her if you want.

377
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,271
No. It's OK.
I'll do it myself.

378
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,349
Bahar?

379
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,957
Hey, sweetheart.
Why are you crying?

380
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,269
Bahar?

381
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,430
Come on, sweetheart.
Why are you crying?

382
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,549
Why are you here?

383
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,879
To see you, of course.

384
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,115
Sweetheart...

385
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,437
I've really changed.
I'm a different person now.

386
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,959
I know I never made you happy
in the past.

387
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,351
But I've really changed, honestly.

388
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,472
I say, you quit this job...

389
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,709
...and come back to Istanbul with me
tomorrow.

390
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,718
Sweetheart, stop crying.

391
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,198
Bahar, stop crying for God's sake.

392
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,552
I swear, I really feel capable of
changing.

393
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,873
I have already changed lot.

394
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,279
I feel like I'm ready to start a new
life now.

395
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,157
You know, to get married,
have kids...

396
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,353
To even leave Istanbul
and move somewhere else...

397
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,029
To turn over...

398
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,596
I feel ready to give up
material things.

399
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,876
I don't want anything more for
myself. I'm done with all that.

400
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,595
I know I can.

401
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,596
I know I can make you happy.

402
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:10,038
I want to ask you something
but you have to answer honestly.

403
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,229
Sure.

404
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,839
Ask me whatever you want.

405
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,870
Did you see Serap again
after we broke up?

406
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,239
No, of course I didn't.

407
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,357
- Are we going, Ozcan?
- Pretty soon. The fog's lifting.

408
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,353
Bahar, what do you say?

409
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,915
Forget this job...

410
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,637
...come with me to Istanbul
tomorrow.

411
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,471
I'm sorry. It's too late now.

412
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,558
Well, fine then. I'm going.

413
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,112
Here you are.
Have a good trip.

414
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,629
Thanks.

415
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,960
Make sure you're there an hour
early.

416
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,040
- What?
- You have to be there an hour early.

417
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,710
- At the airport?
- At the airport. Yes.

418
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,438
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

419
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,156
Is the road to Ishakpasha open?

420
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,191
- Are you done?
- Yes.

421
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,471
What a great view
from down here as well.

422
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,600
I should take a photo from here.
Can you stand in the foreground?

423
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,989
I should take a photo from here.
Can you stand in the foreground?

424
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,479
It would be nice to have someone in
the picture for a change.

425
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,515
Come a bit closer.

426
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:01,315
Is this OK?

427
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,273
That's good but don't smile.

428
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:10,755
Look serious.

429
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,552
Tilt your head forward a bit.

430
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,949
Look more serious.

431
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,035
Look!

432
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:29,272
- Nice, isn't it?
- Yes, it's a good one.

433
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,712
Is there any chance
you can send me a copy?

434
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,949
Sure.

435
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,669
- Write your address, then.
- Ok, I will.

436
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,717
I'll write it on the back of this.

437
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:06,799
How long will it take to get here?

438
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,193
A couple of weeks or so.

439
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,512
What are you going to do
with the photograph?

440
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,199
Send it to my girlfriend.

441
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,915
Aren't there any photographers
in Dogubeyazlt?

442
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,714
There are,
but they do mostly passport photos.

443
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,715
It's nice to have a scenic photo for
once.

444
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,238
I'm putting my phone number here
as well just in case...

445
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,549
Here you go.

446
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,552
- Sorry for the trouble but...
- No problem.

447
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,752
- Are we going straight back then?
- That's right.

448
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,597
- Good morning.
- Morning.

449
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,713
- You were up early.
- I couldn't sleep.

450
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,679
- Did you manage to get some sleep?
- Yes, a bit.

451
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,634
I was even dreaming.

452
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,714
You forgot to take your present with
you that day.

453
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,835
I was going to give it to you
in the van but...

454
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:35,759
I had such a nice dream.

455
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:40,796
What about?

456
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:45,630
It was a beautiful day.
Perfect sunshine.

457
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,397
There were these rolling green
meadows.

458
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:52,989
And I could fly.

459
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:01,872
I was gliding gently over the
meadows. It was so beautiful.

460
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,915
Then...

461
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,919
...I looked down
and saw a cemetery or something.

462
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,072
I flew gently down towards it.

463
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,794
Suddenly I could see my mother.
She was waving at me.

464
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:25,796
I thought,
"Wow! She's still alive!"

465
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:28,869
It was really nice.

466
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:33,032
It made me so happy.

467
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:39,156
What time do you have to be on set?

468
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,958
You don't want to be late.

469
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,395
At nine.

470
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,713
Let's get going then.
I'll buy you a good breakfast.

471
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,871
I can go from there to the airport.

472
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,949
OK?

473
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,238
Aze, you're not crying again, are
you? Come on. That's enough now.

474
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,839
I won't stop
until my father's avenged.

475
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:58,318
That's going to happen. Don't worry.
I'm here.

476
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,549
I'm going to avenge your father.
I'm going to stop those tears.

477
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,919
We'll be able to walk with pride
again.

478
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,156
Can we cut, please?
There's an aircraft.

479
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,436
Oh God! That's all we needed.

480
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,591
- Tell me when it's gone.
- OK.

481
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,119
A cigarette, someone!

482
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,033
Guys, what's the problem?
You keep forgetting your lines.

483
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,110
Zeynep, what happened to the
rehearsals?

484
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,349
But they only forgot...

485
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:32,475
Apo. When you put your rifle down,
don't block it.

486
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,875
- OK.
- Watch out for that.

487
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,749
For my son, Ayaz.
