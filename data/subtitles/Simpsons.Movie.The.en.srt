1
00:00:46,928 --> 00:00:52,219
We come in peace
for cats and mice everywhere.

2
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:14,538
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

3
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:26,332
<i>Itchy... Itchy...</i>

4
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:07,707
Boring!

5
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:09,997
Dad, we can't see the movie.

6
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:14,165
I can't believe we're paying to see
something we get on TV for free.

7
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:18,134
If you ask me, everybody in this theater
is a giant sucker.

8
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,136
Especially you.

9
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,842
Especially you.

10
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,346
<i>Movie on the big screen!</i>

11
00:02:59,553 --> 00:03:02,969
Excuse me. My heinie is dipping.

12
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:20,694
All right, well,
thanks a lot for coming.

13
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,314
We've been playing
for three and a half hours.

14
00:03:23,534 --> 00:03:27,863
Now we'd like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment.

15
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:33,872
- You suck!
- Shut up and play!

16
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,541
- Preachy!
- We're not being preachy.

17
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:40,966
But the pollution in your lake,
it's dissolving our barge.

18
00:03:43,345 --> 00:03:45,254
I thought they touched on
a vital issue.

19
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,429
I beg to differ.

20
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:55,685
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
playing with you tonight.

21
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,580
For the latest rock band
to die in our town...

22
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,836
...Lord, hear our prayer.

23
00:04:23,257 --> 00:04:25,665
Lord, hear our prayer.

24
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:27,844
I hate being late.

25
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,168
Well, I hate going.

26
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:31,428
Why can't I worship the Lord
in my own way...

27
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,432
...by praying like hell on my deathbed?

28
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:35,350
Homer, they can hear you inside.

29
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:40,899
Relax. Those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phony-baloney God.

30
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:46,856
How you doing? Peace be with you.
Praise Jebus.

31
00:04:58,165 --> 00:05:00,621
Today I'd like to try something
a little different.

32
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,076
I'm going to call on one of you!

33
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:07,204
Now, the word of God
dwells within everyone.

34
00:05:07,424 --> 00:05:11,836
I want you to let that word out.
Let your spirit...

35
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,460
What is it, Ned?

36
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,135
The good Lord is telling me
to confess to something.

37
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,342
Gay, gay, gay.

38
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:21,679
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

39
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:23,719
Somebody else?

40
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,139
Let the Lord's light shine upon you.

41
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,438
Feel the spirit.

42
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,825
Let it out!

43
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:40,321
Horrible, horrible things
are going to happen!

44
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,906
And they're gonna happen to you!
And you! And you! And you.

45
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,537
Whoa, nelly!

46
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,091
People of Springfield,
heed this warning:

47
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:55,500
Twisted tail!

48
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,964
A thousand eyes!

49
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,421
Trapped forever!

50
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,556
Dad, do something!

51
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,604
This book doesn't have any answers!

52
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:10,305
Beware! Beware! Time is short!

53
00:06:14,737 --> 00:06:17,442
Believe me! Believe me!

54
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:26,453
Thanks for listening.

55
00:06:31,128 --> 00:06:32,871
Okay, who wants waffles?

56
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,203
I do, I do, I do!

57
00:06:34,423 --> 00:06:35,917
Wait a minute. What about Grampa?

58
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,710
- I want syrup!
- I want strawberries!

59
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:39,586
Something happened to that man.

60
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:44,464
I'll tell you what happened to him.
A certain someone had a senior moment.

61
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:50,518
But that's okay, because we love him
and we got a free rug out of it.

62
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:53,179
What is the point of going to church
every Sunday...

63
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,646
...when if someone we love has a genuine
religious experience, we ignore it?

64
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,653
Right, Grampa?

65
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:02,022
I want bananas on my waffles.

66
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,948
I rest my case.

67
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:07,490
I'm not dropping this.

68
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,621
Wait a minute. I'm still in the car.

69
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:16,745
Oh, right.

70
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:23,967
"Take out hornets' nest."

71
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:32,640
Check. "Fix sinkhole."

72
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:42,736
Check.

73
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,737
"Re-shingle roof"?

74
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:49,780
Steady.

75
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:53,908
Steady.

76
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,038
Why, you little...!

77
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:04,583
I'll teach you to laugh
at something that's funny!

78
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You know, we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

79
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:09,844
What kind of fun?

80
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:11,430
How about a dare contest?

81
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:14,808
That sounds fun. I dare you to...

82
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,560
...climb the TV antenna!

83
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:21,055
- Piece of cake.
- Earthquake!

84
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:29,730
Aftershock!

85
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,661
Homer, I don't mean
to be a Nervous Pervis...

86
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,701
...but if he falls, couldn't that
make your boy a paraplege-arino?

87
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:40,452
Shut up, Flanders.

88
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,371
- Yeah, shut up, Flanders.
- Well said, boy.

89
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:47,377
Steady. Steady.

90
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,705
Steady...

91
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,587
Hello. Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday...

92
00:08:56,807 --> 00:09:01,848
...but I'm sure you're as worried about
the pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

93
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:11,439
Lake Springfield has higher levels
of mercury than ev...

94
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:21,487
Why, it's the little girl
who saved my cat.

95
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,116
Lake Springfield is...

96
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:35,877
Come on over, Lisa.

97
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:38,965
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

98
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,671
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

99
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,560
Hey. I am very passionate
about the planet.

100
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,049
Say global warming is a myth.

101
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,686
It's a myth! Further study is needed!

102
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,018
That's for selling out your beliefs.

103
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:56,195
Oh, poor Milhouse.

104
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:59,065
Dream coming true.

105
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,774
Are you aware that a leaky faucet
can waste over...?

106
00:10:01,994 --> 00:10:03,452
Two thousand gallons a year.

107
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:06,366
- Turning off lights can save...
- Enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

108
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:08,739
And if we kept our thermostats
at 68 in winter...

109
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,078
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

110
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:13,789
I'm Colin.

111
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,629
I haven't seen you at school.

112
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,714
Moved from Ireland.
My dad's a musician.

113
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,503
- Is he...?
- He's not Bono.

114
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,134
- I just thought, because you're Irish and...
- He's not Bono.

115
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:24,760
Do you play?

116
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,013
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

117
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:31,681
<i>He's pure gold.
For once in your life, be cool.</i>

118
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,016
So is your name as pretty
as your face?

119
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,813
You okay there?

120
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:47,869
<i>Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!</i>

121
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:51,115
What could that be?

122
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:53,620
I believe it's the sound
the Green Lantern made...

123
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,870
...when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

124
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:02,381
Yeah. Thanks for coming over.

125
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:04,751
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

126
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,347
Never known comfort like this.

127
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:13,220
Why did I suggest this?

128
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:26,521
All right, boy,
time for the ultimate dare.

129
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:33,237
I dare you to skateboard
to Krusty Burger and back...

130
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:35,282
...naked.

131
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:37,409
- How naked?
- Fourth base.

132
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,788
Girls might see my doodle.

133
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:43,960
Oh, I see. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

134
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:48,123
Every morning, you'll wake up to
"Good morning, chicken."

135
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,135
At your wedding, I'll sing:

136
00:12:04,526 --> 00:12:06,399
I like men now.

137
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:08,731
Don't look where I'm pointing!

138
00:12:28,173 --> 00:12:31,340
Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!

139
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:43,972
Boys, before we eat, don't forget
to thank the Lord for this bountiful...

140
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:45,184
Penis?!

141
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,355
- Bountiful penis.
- Bountiful penis.

142
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,681
Amen.

143
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,817
Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes
in public, but, you know, it's the law.

144
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:00,028
Lunchtime!

145
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,036
You can't just leave me out here.

146
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:05,663
Don't worry, we found
a friend for you to play with.

147
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:17,342
Nelson, honey, where have you been?

148
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:24,517
- Dad!
- What seems to be the problem, officers?

149
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:26,553
Tell him you dared me to do it.

150
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,515
If that's true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

151
00:13:33,026 --> 00:13:36,395
And what happens to me
if it's my fault?

152
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:39,400
You'll have to attend
a one-hour parenting class.

153
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:42,189
It was all his idea!
He's out of control, I tell you!

154
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,608
I'm at my wits' end.

155
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:45,988
It's so...

156
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,372
See you in court, kid.

157
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,706
Okay, son, let's get some lunch.

158
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,579
Did you at least bring my clothes?

159
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,712
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

160
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:59,541
- You didn't bring my pants.
- Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

161
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,545
This is the worst day of my life.

162
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:04,798
The worst day of your life so far.

163
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:11,056
- Say, Bart?
- What do you want, Flanders?

164
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,975
If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

165
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,894
You know how boys are,
always praying through the knees.

166
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:19,351
Why are you helping me?
I'm not your kid.

167
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,519
We're neighbors. I'm sure your father
would do the same for my boys.

168
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,151
Thank you.

169
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:35,203
- Hey, what's with you?
- You really wanna know?

170
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:36,746
Of course I do.

171
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,417
What kind of a father
wouldn't care about...?

172
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,828
A pig wearing a hat!

173
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,212
Action.

174
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,386
Hey, hey! It's your old pal Krusty,
for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger.

175
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:53,508
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you're in Mexico!

176
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,931
And we're clear.

177
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,023
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

178
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:07,190
What...?! You can't kill him
if he's wearing people clothes!

179
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,250
You're coming home with me.

180
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,838
"A thousand eyes."
What could that be?

181
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:34,838
I'm pretty sure
a thousand is a number.

182
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:39,803
Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married
to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

183
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:42,013
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

184
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:45,149
Then say hello
to the newest Simpson.

185
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,692
Homer!

186
00:15:54,368 --> 00:15:59,029
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

187
00:15:59,247 --> 00:16:01,287
Please, get rid of that pig.

188
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:06,457
Oh, you're gonna love him.
Look, he does an impression of you.

189
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:11,171
You nailed her.

190
00:16:11,384 --> 00:16:14,301
He also does me.

191
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:17,509
You smiled. I'm off the hook.

192
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:29,600
Oh, you have so many looks.

193
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,542
So that's what snug is.

194
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:50,994
Who's a good pig?

195
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,872
Who's a good pig?

196
00:16:57,511 --> 00:16:59,633
Rough day, huh, son?

197
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:03,217
You don't know what rough is, sister.

198
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:06,517
Bart, you know, whenever my boys
bake up a batch of frownies...

199
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,056
...I take them fishing.

200
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:10,429
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

201
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,192
Dad, it's not fair to use a bug zapper
to catch the fish.

202
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,903
If you love fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

203
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:29,164
I think I have a nibble.

204
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,420
I think fishing might be
more fun with you.

205
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,421
Oh, great. Now, how about
I fix you some cocoa?

206
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,510
No way. Cocoa's for wusses.

207
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,592
Well, sir, if you change your mind,
it's on the windowsill.

208
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,369
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:14,206
Oh, wait. I didn't tell you the best part.
He loves the environment.

210
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,995
Oh, wait! I still didn't tell you
the best part. He's got an Irish brogue.

211
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,786
No, no, wait!
I still didn't tell you the best part.

212
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:23,798
He's not imaginary!

213
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:26,001
Oh, honey, that's great.

214
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:30,086
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

215
00:18:30,306 --> 00:18:33,592
Because nothing means more
than for a man to...

216
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,597
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

217
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:38,971
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig</i>

218
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,645
<i>Does whatever a Spider-Pig does</i>

219
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,101
<i>Can he swing from a web?</i>

220
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,359
<i>No, he can't, he's a pig</i>

221
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:50,439
<i>Look out
He is the Spider-Pig</i>

222
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:56,914
Are we having fun yet?

223
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:58,867
We are now. You've got a bite.

224
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:01,409
Whoa, mama!

225
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,336
Oh, no, my good pole!

226
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:10,676
You're not strangling me.

227
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:13,294
What the...?
Strangling's only good for...

228
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:15,639
Well, it's not good for anything.

229
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,889
The only time you should
lay hands on a boy...

230
00:19:18,101 --> 00:19:19,928
...is to give him
a good pat on the back.

231
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:22,054
Hey, what the hell are you...?

232
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,686
One more time.

233
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,657
Honey, I'm home.

234
00:19:49,214 --> 00:19:51,290
We are at the tipping point, people.

235
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,299
If we don't do something now...

236
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,546
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Isn't he dreamy?

237
00:19:58,765 --> 00:19:59,879
Agreed.

238
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,594
Okay, so here's the bottom line:

239
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,885
If we don't change our ways
right now...

240
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:07,887
...pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

241
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,144
That's not so bad.

242
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:13,230
No, the lift is stuck.

243
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:21,656
Am I getting through to anyone?

244
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,408
Hell, yeah.
We need a new one of those things.

245
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,911
All in favor of a new scissor lift,
say "aye."

246
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,868
- Aye.
- No!

247
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:34,124
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare.

248
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,751
But I knew you wouldn't listen.

249
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,750
So I took the liberty of pouring water
from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

250
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:43,840
This is why we should hate kids.

251
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,516
This is serious, people.

252
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:50,103
No more dumping in the lake.
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

253
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:51,642
Code black.

254
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:56,522
Black? That's the worst color there is.

255
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,488
- No offense there, Carl.
- I get it all the time.

256
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:19,204
Sorry, sorry. No dumping in the lake.

257
00:21:19,424 --> 00:21:25,260
Fine. I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

258
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:28,589
Chief, I think there was
a dead body in there.

259
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:32,058
I thought that too,
until he said "yard trimmings."

260
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,978
You gotta learn to listen, Lou.

261
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:38,517
Let us now make sure
this barrier is completely idiot-proof.

262
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:40,727
- Cletus.
- Yessum?

263
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:42,984
Try to dump something in the lake.

264
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:44,905
Okay.

265
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:55,707
I can't. I simply can't.

266
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,495
- Brilliant.
- Very effective.

267
00:22:09,555 --> 00:22:12,128
Don't get any ideas.

268
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:19,559
Maybe we should kiss,
just to break the tension.

269
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:21,682
What's going on here?

270
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,979
Nothing. Nothing.

271
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:25,518
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

272
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:29,734
And by the way,
what are you doing with his leavings?

273
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:33,733
Don't worry.
I've devised a most elegant solution.

274
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:37,407
It's leaking.

275
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:41,158
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.

276
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:45,326
He filled up the whole silo
in just two days?

277
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:46,543
Well, I helped.

278
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:52,047
Homer, stop! Stop. I know it's easy
for your mind to wander...

279
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:58,052
...but I want you to
really concentrate on me.

280
00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:05,145
I can't escape the feeling that this
is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

281
00:23:05,358 --> 00:23:08,524
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

282
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:11,068
Okay, Marge. I will.

283
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,189
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

284
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:16,740
He's not Spider-Pig anymore,
he's Harry Plopper.

285
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:31,502
Hello.

286
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:33,091
Homer, you gotta get over here.

287
00:23:33,301 --> 00:23:36,919
Health inspector shut down the doughnut
store, they're giving out free doughnuts!

288
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:40,091
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just got one thing I gotta do first.

289
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:43,758
Well, you better hurry.
They're going fast.

290
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:46,595
Whoa, that was close.

291
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:30,258
<i>Evil!</i>

292
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:33,979
Drive, drive, drive!

293
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:36,066
Oh, right.

294
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:05,885
Look at that. You can see
the four states that border Springfield:

295
00:25:06,096 --> 00:25:09,761
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

296
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,304
Oh, yeah.

297
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:14,852
And if you look real close,
you can almost...

298
00:25:17,274 --> 00:25:20,689
Well, this certainly seems odd...

299
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:24,602
...but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

300
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:29,945
We thank you, Lord,
for this mighty fine intelligent design.

301
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,034
Good job.

302
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:34,953
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

303
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,324
Hey! Jab one more eye
and it's a federal crime.

304
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:41,337
- Who are you?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

305
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,715
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA,
here to see the president.

306
00:25:58,354 --> 00:25:59,469
Mr. President.

307
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,138
<i>Ja, that is me.</i>

308
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:06,023
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

309
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:11,073
I hate this job. Everything's "crisis" this
and "end of the world" that.

310
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:14,118
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny De Vito.

311
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:17,992
You want a joke, huh?
Stop me if you've heard this one.

312
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:22,208
Look at those angry eyes
and giant teeth.

313
00:26:22,418 --> 00:26:24,376
It's like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

314
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:27,666
You know, sir, when you
made me head of the EPA...

315
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:31,251
...you appointed one of
the most successful men in America...

316
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:33,627
...to the least successful agency
in government.

317
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:35,755
And why did I take the job?

318
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:38,678
Because I'm a rich man
who wanted to give something back.

319
00:26:38,892 --> 00:26:40,434
Not the money, but something.

320
00:26:40,644 --> 00:26:44,807
So here is our chance to
kick some ass for Mother Earth.

321
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:47,728
- I'm listening.
- Well, I've narrowed your choices down...

322
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,900
...to five unthinkable options.

323
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:51,689
Each will cause untold misery...

324
00:26:51,905 --> 00:26:53,399
I pick number three.

325
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:55,192
You don't wanna read them first?

326
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:59,026
I was elected to lead, not to read.
Number three!

327
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,279
We're being sealed in a dome!

328
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,330
What do I do?
I don't know what to do!

329
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,663
If I stay, I'm trapped.
If I leave, I'm alone.

330
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,536
Oh, God. In, out, in, out!

331
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,832
I never saw Venice.

332
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:08,059
"Trapped forever."

333
00:28:08,268 --> 00:28:10,593
It's all come true.

334
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:14,395
That crazy old man in church
was right.

335
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:23,521
Dome!

336
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:41,005
All right, men, open fire.

337
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,003
Who's hurt? Raise your hands.

338
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,009
Without the attitude.

339
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:50,796
People, people.
I have an important announcement.

340
00:28:51,142 --> 00:28:54,226
I have just perfected
an acid-firing super-drill...

341
00:28:54,437 --> 00:28:57,391
...which can cut through anything.
- Hey, that's cool.

342
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:58,769
It's right there.

343
00:28:58,983 --> 00:29:02,683
Just outside of the dome.

344
00:29:04,405 --> 00:29:07,904
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

345
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:09,694
<i>The United States government.</i>

346
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:14,701
<i>My name is Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.</i>

347
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,203
The what?

348
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:19,872
<i>- Environmental Protection Agency.
- Come again?</i>

349
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:22,411
<i>Look, I'm a man on a big TV.
Just listen.</i>

350
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:25,204
<i>- Springfield has become...
- Springfield!</i>

351
00:29:25,466 --> 00:29:27,922
<i>- The most polluted city
in the history of the planet.</i>

352
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,464
Drama queen!

353
00:29:30,054 --> 00:29:31,762
<i>To keep your poisons
from spreading...</i>

354
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:34,048
<i>...your government has sealed you
in this dome.</i>

355
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:37,559
<i>It's the last thing we wanted to do.</i>

356
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:40,307
<i>I own the company that makes
the dome, but that's beside the point.</i>

357
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:42,230
You mean we're trapped like rats?

358
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,601
<i>No, rats can't be trapped this easily.
You're trapped like carrots.</i>

359
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:53,151
Wait. We couldn't be more polluted.
Everyone stopped dumping in the lake.

360
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:55,526
<i>Apparently someone
didn't get the message.</i>

361
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:59,412
Act natural.

362
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:03,122
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,
people are gonna discover this.

363
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:07,119
<i>Don't worry about that. We found
a way to take you off the map.</i>

364
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,999
<i>Coming up on your right:</i>

365
00:30:11,218 --> 00:30:12,842
<i>Nothing.</i>

366
00:30:13,094 --> 00:30:16,214
This is Kent Brockman,
reporting to you on a crisis so serious...

367
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:18,470
...it has its own name
and theme music.

368
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,809
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

369
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:29,146
The town is running low on supplies of
everything from gasoline to Botox.

370
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,317
Moment, please.

371
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:38,824
Now, as always, we end our news
on "The Lighter Side."

372
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:42,451
It's the time of year when
the swallows return to Springfield.

373
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,000
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

374
00:31:03,851 --> 00:31:05,642
Maggie?

375
00:31:07,062 --> 00:31:10,478
<i>We've got dome wax, dome polish,
dome freshener, all your dome needs...</i>

376
00:31:10,732 --> 00:31:13,021
<i>...at Dome Depot,
located at the 105 and the dome.</i>

377
00:31:13,234 --> 00:31:15,393
<i>Dome Depot!</i>

378
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,604
Maggie got out! Maggie got out!

379
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:23,906
Maggie was right there,
just outside the dome.

380
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,361
Marge, she's right here.

381
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:31,745
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and...

382
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,158
Oh, my God.

383
00:31:33,378 --> 00:31:38,040
I'm out of the dome.
Fresh air! Freedom!

384
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:40,633
I'll write you. Lead good lives!

385
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,566
<i>Good evening, this is Kent Brockman.</i>

386
00:31:58,777 --> 00:32:01,482
<i>Efforts to find out
whose selfish crime...</i>

387
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:04,022
<i>...caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.</i>

388
00:32:05,033 --> 00:32:06,112
<i>Until moments ago!</i>

389
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:10,700
<i>A shocking discovery has been made
here at Lake Springfield.</i>

390
00:32:11,414 --> 00:32:13,870
That could be anybody's pig-crap silo.

391
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,621
Homer, it was you.

392
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:24,510
You single-handedly killed this town.

393
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:26,960
I know. It's weird.

394
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,595
<i>Just a reminder, this station does not
endorse vigilante justice.</i>

395
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:33,429
<i>Unless it gets results. Which it will.</i>

396
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,315
You didn't listen to me
after I warned you.

397
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:43,059
Don't worry,
nobody watches this stupid show.

398
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:45,484
What's that ominous glow
in the distance?

399
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:50,780
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

400
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:03,376
Marge, look. Those idiots
don't even know where we live.

401
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:06,541
<i>Kill! Kill! Kill!</i>

402
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:10,719
<i>We want Homer! We want Homer!</i>

403
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:13,716
You monster. You monster!

404
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:15,344
Did you see the news?

405
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,467
Honey, come on,
we have bigger problems.

406
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:19,927
But I'm so angry.

407
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:23,597
You're a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

408
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:26,473
Okay.

409
00:33:27,194 --> 00:33:31,108
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob...

410
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:33,612
...and apologize for what you did.

411
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:37,075
I would, but I'm afraid if I open the door,
they'll take all of you.

412
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:39,280
No, we won't. We just want Homer!

413
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:41,704
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grampa.

414
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,624
I'm part of the mob!

415
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:48,294
Teeny! Take out the baby.

416
00:34:02,269 --> 00:34:04,475
Here, let me get that for you.

417
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:13,899
Stay back. I got a chain saw.

418
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:26,245
Bart!

419
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:27,917
Crawl across. Hurry.

420
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:30,415
But if they see you helping us,
they'll kill you.

421
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:33,250
I'm sure your father would
do the same for...

422
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:36,880
Point taken. Now, hustle your bustles.

423
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:41,930
Archers.

424
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:45,130
I'm using a red arrow
so I know who I kill.

425
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:52,726
No, Plopper.
If you push that, Daddy will die.

426
00:34:58,238 --> 00:35:01,025
Hey, my luck's beginning to turn.

427
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,411
Wait! There's something I have to get.

428
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:25,554
- What'd you get?
- Our wedding video.

429
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:29,257
- We have a wedding video?
- Torch his gas tank!

430
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,354
We lost them.

431
00:35:49,954 --> 00:35:51,531
Up here.

432
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:53,952
Get them! Get them!

433
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:00,124
Little help?

434
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:07,464
You know, the word "apology"...

435
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:13,384
...is tossed around a lot these days,
but when it comes from in here...

436
00:36:24,987 --> 00:36:27,822
Mom, what are we gonna do?

437
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:31,362
Maggie, not now.

438
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:34,240
We'll play later.

439
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:45,331
The sinkhole. Follow me, kids!

440
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:47,624
- Geronimo!
- Sacajawea!

441
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:55,545
So long, losers!

442
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:04,933
The top of his head is still showing.
Claw at it!

443
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,804
Well, they're China's problem now.

444
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:53,941
Colin!

445
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,908
I can't hear you!

446
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:27,469
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this is...

447
00:38:27,686 --> 00:38:31,185
Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

448
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,273
- Perfect.

449
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:48,611
- What do we do?
- Now we run.

450
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,126
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

451
00:38:54,336 --> 00:38:55,664
Damn it!

452
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:58,797
Well, then, you find them
and you get them back in the dome.

453
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,418
And so nobody else gets out...

454
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:03,303
...I want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

455
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:04,792
I want 10,000 tough guys...

456
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:08,216
...and I want 10,000 soft guys
to make the tough guys look tougher.

457
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:11,636
And here's how I want them arranged:
Tough, tough, soft, tough...

458
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:16,847
...soft, soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

459
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:20,400
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

460
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:24,608
Of course. Ever try going mad without
power? It's boring. No one listens to you.

461
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,060
- Bart, are you drinking whiskey?
- I'm troubled.

462
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,512
- Bart.
- I promise, I'll stop tomorrow.

463
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,139
You'll stop right now.

464
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,904
You come back here, little man.

465
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:15,285
I miss Flanders. There, I said it!

466
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,703
- Where's your father?
- He went out.

467
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,370
Let's quickly rebuild our lives
while he's gone.

468
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,209
Hey, guys?

469
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:25,207
What's the secret knock, again?

470
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:31,542
Look, I know I screwed up. This is big.

471
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:34,133
It's huge! We're homeless!

472
00:40:34,347 --> 00:40:36,423
Our friends wanna kill us!

473
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:39,048
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you...

474
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,724
...I need to know what was
going through your mind...

475
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:44,226
...when you didn't listen to me...

476
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,939
...and dumped that silo in the lake.

477
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:49,398
Homer!

478
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:53,230
I don't know what to tell you, Marge.
I don't think about things.

479
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,571
I respect people who do...

480
00:40:55,784 --> 00:41:01,288
...but I just try to make the days not hurt
until I get to crawl in next to you again.

481
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,156
I mean, oh.

482
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:09,541
Look, I'm really sorry.
But I'm more than just sorry...

483
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:11,582
...I'm prepared with a solution.

484
00:41:12,174 --> 00:41:16,386
I've always been afraid I'd screw up our
lives so badly we'd need a backup plan.

485
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:21,301
And that plan is right here!

486
00:41:23,477 --> 00:41:24,473
No.

487
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:25,765
Nope.

488
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:27,604
Bingo.

489
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:32,604
Bear with me.

490
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:38,694
Alaska?

491
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:42,858
Alaska. A place where you can't be
too fat or too drunk.

492
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,739
Where no one says things like:

493
00:41:44,955 --> 00:41:48,324
"Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate."

494
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:50,667
I don't know, Homie.

495
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:53,296
I'm not saying it right.

496
00:41:53,505 --> 00:41:57,206
Look, the thing is,
I can't start a new life alone.

497
00:41:57,426 --> 00:42:00,177
And I've really come to like you guys.

498
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:04,586
I just don't see it.

499
00:42:08,603 --> 00:42:12,303
Marge, in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

500
00:42:12,523 --> 00:42:14,765
"I need you to do this with me."

501
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:20,735
And there's only one answer
when somebody says that.

502
00:42:26,203 --> 00:42:29,488
Okay, Homie, I'm with you.

503
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:31,366
Thank you, my sweetheart.

504
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,743
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

505
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,204
You just bought
another load of crap...

506
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:39,457
...from the world's fattest
fertilizer salesman.

507
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:42,165
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

508
00:42:42,385 --> 00:42:43,380
Homer!

509
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,879
How are we supposed to get to Alaska
without any money?

510
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:51,558
All right, son. If you don't believe in me,
believe in America.

511
00:42:52,227 --> 00:42:58,312
America. Where any man can make
quick money with no questions asked.

512
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:02,978
Step right up and win my truck!

513
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:06,481
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

514
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:08,074
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

515
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:12,198
Just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

516
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:14,489
Three tries for $ 10.

517
00:43:14,874 --> 00:43:17,993
- Marge, how much money do we have?
- Ten dollars.

518
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,963
That counts as a try.

519
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:28,003
That's two.

520
00:43:30,347 --> 00:43:31,545
And that's three.

521
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:34,516
Here's what I'll do,
because I like seeing you hurt yourself:

522
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:36,184
I'll give you one on the house.

523
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:38,221
- You're the best.
- Dad!

524
00:43:38,437 --> 00:43:42,102
When you get to the top,
don't slow down, speed up!

525
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:45,270
- But that's when it's the scariest.
- Just do it!

526
00:43:57,414 --> 00:43:58,908
Yes!

527
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:02,916
Yay, Dad!

528
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:12,173
I'll take that truck now.

529
00:44:14,847 --> 00:44:17,338
Oh, man. My wives are gonna kill me.

530
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:23,136
Next stop, Alaska!

531
00:44:28,943 --> 00:44:30,936
<i>Day 37 under the dome.</i>

532
00:44:31,154 --> 00:44:35,021
<i>We are facing intermittent
power failures which...</i>

533
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,410
Okay, very funny.
I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

534
00:44:41,622 --> 00:44:44,706
When they come back on,
I want all my booze back the way it was.

535
00:44:49,379 --> 00:44:52,464
Yeah, okay. Okay.

536
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:03,136
I'm very proud of you, Bart.
Over 24 hours sober.

537
00:45:03,351 --> 00:45:05,640
- You are, aren't you?
- I'll prove it.

538
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:15,440
We're giving your father another chance,
and we owe it to him to...

539
00:45:16,864 --> 00:45:18,322
- Oh, my God.
- Can I help you?

540
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:22,362
We need diapers.

541
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:24,784
- Okay.
- No. No, we don't. We don't.

542
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:26,905
- Ladies' razorblades.
- Right.

543
00:45:27,123 --> 00:45:31,121
No! No. No, we don't.
I forgot, we're European.

544
00:45:31,669 --> 00:45:33,080
Just give us beef jerky.

545
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:36,047
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

546
00:45:36,257 --> 00:45:39,127
That's right. That's what we need.
That's all we came in for.

547
00:45:39,343 --> 00:45:40,672
Sure.

548
00:45:44,014 --> 00:45:46,221
Oh, my God. There they are!

549
00:46:05,827 --> 00:46:09,741
So you want some of my electricity,
do you?

550
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,325
Well, for once,
the rich white man is in control.

551
00:46:14,543 --> 00:46:16,666
I have two buttons behind this desk.

552
00:46:16,879 --> 00:46:21,505
One will supply your town with power,
the other releases the hounds.

553
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,505
Reach me. Make me your brother.

554
00:46:24,761 --> 00:46:26,919
The hospital's generator
is about to give out.

555
00:46:27,138 --> 00:46:28,383
Lives will be lost.

556
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:32,341
"Lives lost." Go on.

557
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,680
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

558
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:38,269
Tempting. Tempting.

559
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:40,190
Look, all our reasons mean nothing.

560
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:44,101
Just look into your heart
and you'll find the answer.

561
00:46:47,574 --> 00:46:50,409
- First door on the right.
- Thank you.

562
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:02,250
What...? This isn't the way
I pictured Alaska at all!

563
00:47:02,463 --> 00:47:03,922
Oh, that's better.

564
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:05,875
Homer!

565
00:47:12,306 --> 00:47:15,141
Well, at least my poster
didn't get torn.

566
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,522
Welcome to Alaska. Here's $ 1000.

567
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:32,312
Well, it's about time! But why?

568
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:34,490
We pay every resident $ 1000...

569
00:47:34,702 --> 00:47:37,619
...to allow oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

570
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:39,906
I'm home!

571
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:41,997
Oh, thanks.

572
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:01,267
What are you doing, Bart?

573
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:02,936
Just passing the time.

574
00:48:16,575 --> 00:48:20,157
My boy loves Alaska so much,
he's applauding it.

575
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,826
- Lisa, why aren't you clapping?
- But, Dad...

576
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,498
Clap for Alaska!

577
00:48:41,682 --> 00:48:46,059
Well, Marge, we're separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

578
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,018
All my dreams are coming true.

579
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:22,754
We're going to need more birds.

580
00:49:44,283 --> 00:49:46,074
Day 93 under the dome.

581
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,573
With necessities growing
dangerously low...

582
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:51,741
...who knows what spark will set off
this powder keg?

583
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:55,372
<i>- Let's discuss Tuesdays with Morrie.
- Again?</i>

584
00:49:55,585 --> 00:49:58,254
If we don't get a new book,
I'm going to puke.

585
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:02,128
You're the five people
I'm going to meet in hell!

586
00:50:04,093 --> 00:50:06,085
We're out of coffee!

587
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:11,472
I can't take another minute
in this dome!

588
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:24,192
Take that.

589
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,029
Oh, no! Blowback!

590
00:50:32,495 --> 00:50:34,155
Look what they're doing to our dome.

591
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:43,040
You know what that is, sir?

592
00:50:43,255 --> 00:50:44,963
- A crack?
- Exactly.

593
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:48,340
People got out of the dome before,
they're gonna get out again.

594
00:50:48,552 --> 00:50:51,387
When they do, there's gonna be
hearings, investigations...

595
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:55,344
I'll have to go back to
making family comedies.

596
00:50:57,352 --> 00:50:59,391
Don't worry,
I have a solution for you, sir.

597
00:50:59,604 --> 00:51:02,141
In fact, I have five solutions.

598
00:51:02,356 --> 00:51:04,812
You don't have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

599
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:06,817
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.

600
00:51:07,861 --> 00:51:09,819
No. I need to know
what I'm approving.

601
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,944
Absolutely. But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

602
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,484
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

603
00:51:16,703 --> 00:51:20,036
It takes real leadership to pick
something you're clueless about.

604
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:22,666
- Okay, I pick three.
- Try again.

605
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:24,667
- One. Five?
- Go higher. Too high.

606
00:51:24,878 --> 00:51:25,992
- Three?
- You said three.

607
00:51:26,212 --> 00:51:28,003
- Six? Two?
- There is no six. Double it.

608
00:51:28,214 --> 00:51:29,542
- Four!
- As you wish, sir.

609
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:45,762
<i>Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?</i>

610
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:48,851
Here we are, kids, the Grand Canyon.

611
00:51:49,067 --> 00:51:53,396
It's so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

612
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:55,736
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

613
00:51:55,948 --> 00:51:58,237
The U.S. Government
has lost its credibility...

614
00:51:58,451 --> 00:52:00,111
...so it's borrowing some of mine.

615
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:01,703
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

616
00:52:01,912 --> 00:52:03,869
Sure thing, son.

617
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:08,708
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the New Grand Canyon.

618
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:12,417
<i>This weekend. East of Shelbyville
and south of Capitol City.</i>

619
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,500
That's where Springfield is!

620
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,088
It's nowhere near where
anything is or ever was.

621
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:18,465
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

622
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,679
If you're going to pick a government
to trust, why not this one?

623
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,219
Did you see that?

624
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:26,137
Yes, they're going
to destroy Springfield.

625
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:28,095
But we're going to stop them.

626
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:31,099
Homie, get your clothes on. Homie?

627
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,604
I'm happy here. Screw Springfield!

628
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,105
I can't believe you'd say
something so selfish.

629
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,488
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

630
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,072
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

631
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,073
<i>- It was 7 at night.
- It was during Access Hollywood.</i>

632
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,115
Which is on at 4 and 7.

633
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:53,160
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

634
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,169
Flanders helped
when we were in trouble.

635
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,419
Who cares what he did?
He's not your father.

636
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,794
I wish he was.

637
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:01,000
You don't mean that.
You worship me.

638
00:53:01,218 --> 00:53:03,543
Oh, yeah?
Look what I did to your picture.

639
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:05,217
Look at it.

640
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:07,299
How-dilly-doo-dilly.
How-dilly-doo-dilly.

641
00:53:07,516 --> 00:53:08,975
Why, you little...!

642
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:11,519
I'll strangle-angle you!

643
00:53:11,728 --> 00:53:13,009
Diddily-diddily.

644
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,555
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

645
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,643
Homer...

646
00:53:19,194 --> 00:53:22,728
...in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

647
00:53:22,947 --> 00:53:26,031
"I need you to do this with me."

648
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:31,194
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

649
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:32,576
Homer Simpson!

650
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,332
We're saving Springfield!

651
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:36,700
Listen to me, all of you.
We are staying.

652
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:38,461
We have a great life in Alaska...

653
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,920
...and we're never going
back to America again.

654
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:44,089
I have spoken!

655
00:54:03,777 --> 00:54:08,854
Well, I guess I've let her
worry about me long enough.

656
00:54:20,877 --> 00:54:23,582
Marge? Kids?

657
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,807
<i>Okay, here goes.</i>

658
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,394
<i>Homer...</i>

659
00:54:40,604 --> 00:54:42,561
<i>...I've always stood up for you.</i>

660
00:54:42,773 --> 00:54:45,892
<i>When people point out your flaws...</i>

661
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:47,900
<i>...I always say:</i>

662
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:53,188
<i>"Well, sometimes you have to
stand back to appreciate a work of art. "</i>

663
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,944
Way back.

664
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,410
<i>Lately, what's keeping us together...</i>

665
00:54:59,622 --> 00:55:03,868
<i>...is my ability to overlook
everything you do.</i>

666
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:07,833
<i>And I overlook these things
because...</i>

667
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,416
Because?

668
00:55:10,424 --> 00:55:12,582
<i>Well, that's the thing.</i>

669
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:17,048
<i>I just don't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.</i>

670
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:21,631
<i>So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield...</i>

671
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,472
<i>...and we're never coming back.</i>

672
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:31,230
<i>And to prove to myself
that this is the end...</i>

673
00:55:32,486 --> 00:55:36,353
<i>...I taped this over our wedding video.</i>

674
00:55:37,658 --> 00:55:39,780
<i>Goodbye, Homie.</i>

675
00:55:53,172 --> 00:55:55,924
<i>I love you.</i>

676
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:01,925
Marge? Kids?

677
00:56:54,355 --> 00:56:57,225
- So, Mom, what's our plan?
- What are you doing up there?

678
00:56:57,441 --> 00:56:59,149
Looking through people's luggage.

679
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,277
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

680
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:05,987
Get down from there.
We have to keep a low profile...

681
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:10,279
...till we get to Seattle to tell the world
of the plot to destroy Springfield.

682
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:12,986
I don't know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

683
00:57:13,206 --> 00:57:17,500
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

684
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:28,168
<i>Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's pizza.</i>

685
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:31,507
<i>I like meat, but I don't know
if I'm ready to love again.</i>

686
00:57:31,724 --> 00:57:34,974
<i>- You hang up first.
- No, you hang up first.</i>

687
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,514
<i>Okay.</i>

688
00:57:36,728 --> 00:57:38,555
<i>She hung up on me!</i>

689
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:43,101
<i>But we're fugitives. We should
just lay low till we get to Seattle.</i>

690
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:45,186
Hey, everybody, I found one!

691
00:57:45,403 --> 00:57:49,270
The government actually found
someone we're looking for!

692
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,317
Yeah, baby, yeah!

693
00:57:53,077 --> 00:57:54,322
Homer Simpson...

694
00:57:56,288 --> 00:57:58,080
...do you know why you are here?

695
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:02,204
Because my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

696
00:58:02,419 --> 00:58:04,791
Drink this liquid.

697
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:08,751
More, please.

698
00:58:09,551 --> 00:58:11,627
Now we will cleanse your spirit...

699
00:58:11,845 --> 00:58:15,048
...by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

700
00:58:15,265 --> 00:58:17,387
Throat singing?

701
00:58:27,943 --> 00:58:29,521
How long are we doing this?

702
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:31,611
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

703
00:58:31,648 --> 00:58:33,487
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

704
00:58:36,952 --> 00:58:37,983
What's an epiphany?

705
00:58:38,203 --> 00:58:41,239
Sudden realization of great truth.

706
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:42,452
Okay.

707
00:58:57,012 --> 00:59:00,595
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig</i>

708
00:59:00,808 --> 00:59:04,176
<i>Does whatever a Spider-Pig does</i>

709
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:05,509
<i>Look out!</i>

710
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:09,929
<i>He's a Spider-Pig</i>

711
00:59:11,484 --> 00:59:13,607
Unless you have an epiphany...

712
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:17,734
...you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

713
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:21,064
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

714
00:59:21,786 --> 00:59:25,237
Bananas are an excellent source
of potassium.

715
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:30,078
Americans will never embrace soccer?

716
00:59:32,212 --> 00:59:35,130
More than two shakes
and it's playing with yourself?

717
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:39,965
Hey, what are you doing?

718
00:59:43,515 --> 00:59:48,307
Oh, do whatever you want to me.
I don't care about myself anymore.

719
00:59:50,188 --> 00:59:52,476
<i>Because...?</i>

720
00:59:53,107 --> 00:59:57,484
Because other people
are just as important as me.

721
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:01,989
Without them, I'm nothing.

722
01:00:03,784 --> 01:00:07,152
In order to save myself...

723
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,908
...I have to save Springfield!

724
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:12,993
That's it! Isn't it?

725
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:28,513
That was the most
incredible experience of my life.

726
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:33,931
And now to find my family,
save my town and drop 10 pounds!

727
01:00:34,271 --> 01:00:36,014
Thank you, boob lady.

728
01:00:43,738 --> 01:00:46,858
This is it, kids. Seattle.

729
01:00:47,075 --> 01:00:50,075
Russ Cargill! Do you think he saw us?

730
01:00:53,831 --> 01:00:55,373
Yes, I did.

731
01:01:00,295 --> 01:01:02,039
Run! Run!

732
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:04,291
Run! Run!

733
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,591
Run! Run!

734
01:01:07,302 --> 01:01:09,259
Jump! Jump!

735
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:11,463
Land! Land!

736
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:13,888
Rest! Rest!

737
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:15,976
Run! Run!

738
01:01:18,646 --> 01:01:20,722
Now, I know we've had a rough day...

739
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,894
...but I'm sure we can put all that
behind us and...

740
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:28,647
That's my whipping arm!

741
01:01:31,783 --> 01:01:35,448
Why does everything I whip leave me?

742
01:01:36,788 --> 01:01:40,916
Must keep going. Must keep going.

743
01:01:41,126 --> 01:01:45,075
No, I can't. I can't keep going.

744
01:01:45,296 --> 01:01:47,372
Yes, you can.

745
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,381
No, I can't!

746
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:51,252
Oh, shut up!

747
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:53,046
You shut up.

748
01:01:53,262 --> 01:01:55,089
No, you. No, you.

749
01:01:55,306 --> 01:01:58,093
No, you. Oh, real mature.

750
01:01:58,308 --> 01:02:00,597
How could you say that?

751
01:02:00,811 --> 01:02:02,803
Oh, what's the point?

752
01:02:03,021 --> 01:02:05,346
It's hopeless.

753
01:02:13,323 --> 01:02:16,905
Don't give up, Homer.
You are closer than you think.

754
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:18,742
But which way do I go?

755
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,957
Much obliged.

756
01:02:40,306 --> 01:02:42,429
Ten-hut!

757
01:02:47,688 --> 01:02:49,847
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

758
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,061
Lisa!

759
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:56,984
They captured my family.
What do I do? What do I do?

760
01:03:03,203 --> 01:03:05,990
There's something strange
about that "sop" sign.

761
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:26,262
- Did you hear something?
- Probably just a moth.

762
01:03:26,475 --> 01:03:27,886
I hope it's okay.

763
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:55,617
Look, we can't keep stopping at
every "sop," "yeld" or "one vay" sign.

764
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:57,034
Just move on.

765
01:04:03,176 --> 01:04:04,836
Let us out! Let us out!

766
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:07,211
Stop that.
You'll scratch your shackles.

767
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,470
I hope I do.

768
01:04:15,771 --> 01:04:18,974
Oh, way to go, Bart.

769
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:20,567
You stink.

770
01:04:20,776 --> 01:04:24,524
No, you stink.

771
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:41,537
Springfield.

772
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,204
I can't believe it,
but it got even crappier.

773
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,094
Oh, man.

774
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:00,892
Oh, hi, Midge.

775
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,182
Moe, what happened?

776
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,860
With the town sealed off from the rest of
the world, things got a little nutty here.

777
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,446
Why are you dressed like that?

778
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:14,068
Well, I don't like to brag,
but I am now the emperor of Springfield.

779
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,613
No, you're not!

780
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,117
Yes, I am!

781
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:21,905
Okay. Hail, emperor.

782
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:24,165
<i>Attention, Springfield.</i>

783
01:05:25,712 --> 01:05:29,840
<i>Your government realized that putting you
inside this dome was a terrible mistake.</i>

784
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:33,383
<i>Therefore, we're commencing with
Operation Soaring Eagle.</i>

785
01:05:35,096 --> 01:05:36,638
<i>Which involves killing you all.</i>

786
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:48,847
<i>As I speak, we're lowering a small
but powerful bomb into your midst.</i>

787
01:05:57,868 --> 01:06:01,817
Despite everything, I miss your father.

788
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:03,698
Me too.

789
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:06,584
His big, fat ass could shield us all.

790
01:06:11,172 --> 01:06:12,168
Ten-hut!

791
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:17,251
At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites...

792
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,842
...and I have an urgent note
from the president.

793
01:06:20,055 --> 01:06:22,427
It says to release
this town immediately.

794
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:24,220
Why is it written on a leaf?

795
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:47,659
Perfect.

796
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:55,083
Now Homer Simpson's gonna show
he has cojones!

797
01:07:12,605 --> 01:07:14,562
Mom, I've gotta go find Colin.

798
01:07:14,774 --> 01:07:19,020
Not now, sweetie.
Doomsday is family time.

799
01:07:23,949 --> 01:07:28,492
Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill,
the rest of us can climb up that thing.

800
01:07:28,703 --> 01:07:32,487
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

801
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:35,366
My time to shine.

802
01:07:35,919 --> 01:07:39,122
Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here!

803
01:07:39,547 --> 01:07:41,041
<i>What do you want?</i>

804
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,419
Look what I can do with my thumb.

805
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,212
You wanna know how I do it?

806
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,719
<i>Four generations of inbreeding?</i>

807
01:08:06,322 --> 01:08:08,030
I can smell fresh air.

808
01:08:08,991 --> 01:08:11,031
I can hear birds.

809
01:08:11,244 --> 01:08:13,532
I taste freedom.

810
01:08:13,746 --> 01:08:15,869
Excuse me!
Watch out! Coming through!

811
01:08:23,797 --> 01:08:25,256
<i>I was tricked by an idiot.</i>

812
01:08:25,465 --> 01:08:31,088
Hey, I know how you feel.
I was beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken.

813
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:32,763
<i>Goodbye.</i>

814
01:08:35,558 --> 01:08:36,886
Homer do good?

815
01:08:37,310 --> 01:08:42,221
Actually, you doomed us all. Again.
Nice knowing you, Homer.

816
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,815
But I...

817
01:08:46,902 --> 01:08:49,523
I can't do anything right.

818
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:54,691
Get out of here!

819
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,949
I've spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

820
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,840
And now there's only time to say:

821
01:09:09,048 --> 01:09:10,875
Life well spent!

822
01:09:15,888 --> 01:09:20,596
Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus,
be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

823
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:22,600
Will Buddha be there too?

824
01:09:22,811 --> 01:09:23,890
No.

825
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:26,020
- Hey, Flanders.
- Bart.

826
01:09:26,314 --> 01:09:30,264
How good to see you.
And how terrible you're here.

827
01:09:30,568 --> 01:09:32,193
Thanks.

828
01:09:32,403 --> 01:09:36,864
Listen. I was just wondering if...

829
01:09:37,075 --> 01:09:39,197
...before I died...

830
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:43,277
...I could pretend I had a father who...

831
01:09:43,497 --> 01:09:44,908
...cared for me.

832
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,792
Come here, son.

833
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:51,287
There's always room for one more
in the Flanders clan.

834
01:09:56,009 --> 01:09:59,378
Come on, bomb-disarming robot.
You're our last hope.

835
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:04,092
<i>Red wire. Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.</i>

836
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:06,976
<i>So much pressure.</i>

837
01:10:08,146 --> 01:10:09,390
<i>Pressure!</i>

838
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,520
He'd been talking about it,
but I didn't take him seriously.

839
01:10:22,617 --> 01:10:23,780
Marge.

840
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:26,235
Marge! Marge!

841
01:10:27,414 --> 01:10:29,371
Oh, no, the "epipha-tree"!

842
01:10:29,582 --> 01:10:33,366
Hey, I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

843
01:10:34,629 --> 01:10:37,879
But how am I
supposed to get up there?

844
01:10:42,928 --> 01:10:45,597
Here. Buy yourself something nice.

845
01:10:50,227 --> 01:10:52,932
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

846
01:10:53,146 --> 01:10:54,973
Risking my life to save people I hate...

847
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:57,811
...for reasons I don't quite understand.
Gotta go!

848
01:10:59,277 --> 01:11:01,270
But first, one stop.

849
01:11:08,244 --> 01:11:10,865
Bart? Son?

850
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,072
You think you could find it
in your heart...

851
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:15,912
...to give your foolish old man
one more chance?

852
01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:19,080
Oh, I don't know.

853
01:11:19,296 --> 01:11:21,834
It seems to me, son,
that your father's saying that...

854
01:11:22,049 --> 01:11:25,298
...he wants to spend
his last minute with you.

855
01:11:28,013 --> 01:11:29,922
No. I can't do it.

856
01:11:30,348 --> 01:11:34,298
I want a father who's the same
in the morning as he is at night.

857
01:11:34,519 --> 01:11:35,799
What's that word?

858
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:37,300
- Consistency.
- Consistency.

859
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:38,980
Thanks, losers.

860
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:40,304
Sorry, Homer.

861
01:11:41,859 --> 01:11:44,148
I'll let you hold the bomb.

862
01:11:45,487 --> 01:11:46,981
The man knows me.

863
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:53,776
I wish Homer was my father.

864
01:11:53,995 --> 01:11:56,949
And I wish you didn't have
the devil's curly hair.

865
01:12:05,047 --> 01:12:10,005
I've been taking your crap all my life!

866
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,179
This feels good. No wonder you do it.

867
01:12:20,228 --> 01:12:23,431
Okay, you've only got one shot
to throw that bomb through the hole.

868
01:12:23,648 --> 01:12:25,973
Dad, in case I miss...

869
01:12:26,192 --> 01:12:28,862
...I'm sorry I said I wished
you weren't my father.

870
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:32,237
I don't blame you, son.
I wasn't much of a father.

871
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:35,117
Maybe it starts with the way
my dad raised me.

872
01:12:35,326 --> 01:12:39,703
Yes. It's clear to me. It's just been
one long, unbroken cycle of...

873
01:12:39,914 --> 01:12:42,583
Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

874
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:06,805
What? What's going on?

875
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:32,618
We did it, boy!

876
01:13:33,005 --> 01:13:34,500
Dad?

877
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:27,508
It's amazing no one was hurt.

878
01:14:28,308 --> 01:14:31,178
Bye, everybody.

879
01:14:33,521 --> 01:14:36,806
Now, that was
a great father-son activity.

880
01:14:37,024 --> 01:14:39,313
Hello, Homer.

881
01:14:40,152 --> 01:14:43,852
So we meet at last, whoever you are.

882
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:47,109
There's two things they don't teach you
at Harvard Business School.

883
01:14:47,326 --> 01:14:50,030
How to cope with defeat,
and how to handle a shotgun.

884
01:14:50,245 --> 01:14:52,736
I'm going to do both right now.

885
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,114
Wait! If you kill my dad...

886
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:57,575
...you'll never know
where the treasure is buried.

887
01:14:57,794 --> 01:14:58,825
What treasure?

888
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:01,874
The Treasure of Imawiener.

889
01:15:02,089 --> 01:15:03,169
I'm a wiener?

890
01:15:05,092 --> 01:15:06,088
Classic.

891
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:08,460
Well, always leave them laughing.

892
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:10,090
Goodbye, sir.

893
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:22,057
Maggie! What a great little accident
you turned out to be.

894
01:15:25,028 --> 01:15:27,815
Colin? Colin!

895
01:15:28,281 --> 01:15:31,068
Lisa? Colin's dead.

896
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,783
But his last words were:

897
01:15:34,996 --> 01:15:40,619
"Milhouse, take care of Lisa.
Hold her hand."

898
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:45,876
I got her all warmed up for you.

899
01:15:46,089 --> 01:15:48,378
Colin. Hi.

900
01:15:48,592 --> 01:15:50,715
- Hey, you wanna go...?
- Clean up the lake?

901
01:15:50,927 --> 01:15:53,596
Well, I was gonna say
get some ice cream, but okay.

902
01:15:54,556 --> 01:15:56,347
I like ice cream.

903
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:04,728
Kind of sweaty. Sorry.

904
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:22,152
Boy! You survived! How?

905
01:16:22,374 --> 01:16:24,200
I did things no dog should do.

906
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:26,374
They will haunt me forever.

907
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:27,999
I love you too.

908
01:16:43,936 --> 01:16:46,557
Best kiss of my life.

909
01:16:46,772 --> 01:16:49,523
Best kiss of your life so far.

910
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,281
Steady.

911
01:17:10,169 --> 01:17:12,494
Steady.

912
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:15,955
Steady.

913
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:17,585
Dad?

914
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:20,253
Thanks, boy.

915
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:22,925
Steady.

916
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:12,684
They've taken everything, sir.

917
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:18,978
Smithers, I don't believe in suicide...

918
01:18:19,192 --> 01:18:22,727
...but if you'd like to try it,
it might cheer me up to watch.

919
01:18:57,353 --> 01:18:58,598
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

920
01:18:58,813 --> 01:19:01,683
If you see me in person,
please, leave me be.

921
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:18,528
<i>Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig</i>

922
01:19:19,082 --> 01:19:22,866
<i>Does whatever a Spider-Pig does</i>

923
01:19:23,294 --> 01:19:27,374
<i>Can he swing from a web?</i>

924
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:30,875
<i>No, he can't, he's a pig</i>

925
01:19:31,093 --> 01:19:32,374
<i>Look out!</i>

926
01:19:32,928 --> 01:19:36,629
<i>He is a Spider-Pig</i>

927
01:19:39,434 --> 01:19:40,715
<i>Look out!</i>

928
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:45,099
<i>He is a Spider-Pig</i>

929
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:17,833
Come on, Dad, let's go. I've been holding
it since they put the dome over the town.

930
01:20:18,054 --> 01:20:21,138
You can wait. A lot of people
worked really hard on this film...

931
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:25,477
...and all they ask is for you
to memorize their names.

932
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:28,094
Well, I wanna make sure
no animals were harmed...

933
01:20:28,314 --> 01:20:31,268
...during the filming of this movie.

934
01:20:35,029 --> 01:20:36,024
Okay.

935
01:20:36,905 --> 01:20:39,194
Floor popcorn.

936
01:20:41,284 --> 01:20:44,119
Wait, wait, wait! It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

937
01:20:44,329 --> 01:20:47,116
Oh, my God. Her first word.

938
01:20:47,874 --> 01:20:49,783
Sequel?

939
01:24:28,499 --> 01:24:31,868
<i>Springfield doesn't have an anthem</i>

940
01:24:32,086 --> 01:24:36,000
<i>We thought we had one
But we don't</i>

941
01:24:36,214 --> 01:24:40,046
<i>We paid a short guy to write it</i>

942
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,044
<i>But we never saw him again</i>

943
01:24:44,264 --> 01:24:48,047
<i>The tune we stole from the French</i>

944
01:24:48,267 --> 01:24:51,636
<i>There's a few things they do well</i>

945
01:24:51,854 --> 01:24:55,899
<i>Like making love, wine and cheese</i>

946
01:24:56,108 --> 01:25:00,058
<i>Like Roqueforts, Camemberts and Bries</i>

947
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:04,063
<i>Springfield, we're going to die</i>

948
01:25:04,283 --> 01:25:09,028
<i>Springfield, I'm scared, goodbye</i>

949
01:26:19,812 --> 01:26:23,892
Assistant manager
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

950
01:26:29,822 --> 01:26:33,321
Four years of film school for this?
