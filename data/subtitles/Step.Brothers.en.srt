00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,156
Hey, Brennan.

3
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,493
Mom, I'm watching the thing
with the lady.

4
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,579
I’m leaving. Okay?
I’ll be home around 11.

5
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,331
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, Brennan.

6
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,753
Let's slowly get those hips up.
Good. Now, hold it right here. Great

7
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,426
Dale.

8
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,595
Dale, I’m leaving for the conference.

9
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,182
-You leave me money for pizza, Dad?
-Yeah, there's $20 on the hall table.

10
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,601
Do not order pay-per-view, buddy.

11
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,437
-But what if I want wings?
-You don't need wings.

12
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,938
That's not enough, Dad!

13
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,732
The RTI cochlear implant...

14
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,443
...is the state-of-the-art
implantable hearing device...

15
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,864
...due to its input processing of sound
via the speech processor.

16
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,784
But the most exciting
new development...

17
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,452
...is the external processor...

18
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,871
...which fits directly over the ear...

19
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:06,167
...which eliminates the need to put
your face between those breasts.

20
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:13,299
I’m sorry. I’m just-- I’m so lost.
And this never happens to me.

21
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,888
My name is Robert, and I play
racquetball. I collect coins.

22
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,807
Sweet Jesus! I love Korean food.

23
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,810
I am Nancy Huff. I know
how to make tandoori chicken...

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,062
...I contribute to NPR
every single year...

25
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,231
...and I love the movies
of Rob Reiner.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,483
Pilates changed my life.

27
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,820
I have a boat, and I wanna retire
and sail around the world.

28
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,614
-I love the sea!
-And I drive a Mercedes...

29
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,659
...and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale,
who still lives at home.

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,995
-What did you just say?
-I knew I shouldn't have told you that.

31
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,039
I have a 39-year-old son
named Brennan...

32
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,792
...who still lives at home with me.

33
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,346
I would like to thank all of you...

34
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:04,725
...for being here with us
on this fantastic, wonderful day.

35
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,062
And I would like to raise my glass.

36
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,191
Dale and I wanna welcome you
to our home with open arms.

37
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,029
-Get a room, Dad.
-Oh, for chri-- Dale!

38
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,701
Well, as you all know, my youngest
son, Derek, couldn't be here...

39
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,203
...because of an important
fishing trip.

40
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:29,709
But my other son, Brennan, was going
to be moving into his own place...

41
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,962
...but he was recently let go
from his job at PetSmart...

42
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,924
...so he is gonna be living with us.

43
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,261
I wasn't fired from my job,
I was laid off!

44
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,555
But you wouldn't
know the difference.

45
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,268
I didn't want salmon!
I said it four times.

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,398
This wedding is horseshit.

47
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,739
Somebody's awfully quiet
back there.

48
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,909
I’m not gonna call him Dad.

49
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,244
Brennan, you're 39 years old.

50
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,413
I would not expect you
to call him Dad.

51
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:12,251
Well, I’m not going to, ever.
Even if there's a fire.

52
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,922
Robert better not get in my face...

53
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,758
...because I’ll drop
that motherfucker.

54
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,259
Jesus, Brennan.

55
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,639
I’m just saying, I think
you gotta think about your options.

56
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,683
I know that you are
technically married now...

57
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,520
...but that does not mean
that they have to live here.

58
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,901
Dale, I think it's time for a change
for both of us.

59
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,780
Dad, we're men, okay?

60
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,449
That means a few things.

61
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:47,286
We like to shit with the door open.
We talk about pussy.

62
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,831
We go on riverboat-gambling trips.
We make our own beefjerky.

63
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,293
That's what we do.
And now that is all wrecked.

64
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,130
We literally have never done
any of those things.

65
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,508
Where did he go to medical school?

66
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,219
He went to Northwestern
and Johns Hopkins.

67
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,806
-Is that good enough for you?
-No, it's not.

68
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,810
Well, Brennan, those are
very prestigious schools.

69
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,729
I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.

70
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,482
You don't know anyone
named Johnny Hopkins.

71
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,610
It was Johnny Hopkins
and Sloan Kettering...

72
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,613
...and they were
blazing that shit up every day.

73
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,158
All right, here's a scenario
for you, Dad.

74
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,661
Suppose Nancy sees me
coming out of the shower...

75
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,747
...and decides to come on to me.
I’m looking good.

76
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,125
I've got a luscious V of hair...

77
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,670
...going from my chest pubes
down to my ball-fro.

78
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,589
And she takes one look at me,
and she goes:

79
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,174
"Oh, my God.

80
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,512
I've had the old bull,
now I want the young calf."

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,266
-And she grabs me by the wiener.
-Shut the fuck up!

82
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,197
-Come on, Brennan.
-I’m fine here.

83
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,036
-There you are.
-Hi.

84
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,039
Oh, you look so cute
in your moving clothes.

85
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,874
-How was it?
-It was easy.

86
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,876
The movers did everything.

87
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,380
Where's Brennan?

88
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,759
He's still in the car.

89
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,427
It was kind of a rough drive.

90
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,721
Hey, Robert,
what's all the commotion?

91
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,599
-Hey, Don.
-Is that your wife, Nancy?

92
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,185
-Right here, Don.
-Can I come over this afternoon...

93
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,228
-...and touch your face?
-Sure.

94
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,563
Thanks. Good luck, guys.

95
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,856
We'll see you, Don.

96
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,817
Let's go, Cinnamon.
Heel, Cinnamon.

97
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,737
Heel! Cinnamon!

98
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,907
Cinnamon!

99
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,658
Hi, Dale.

100
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,578
Hey, Nancy. Could you make me
a grilled-cheese sandwich?

101
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,246
-Sure.
-No.

102
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,583
Dale just ate. He's testing you to see
how much he can get away with.

103
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,502
-I see.
-I’m hungry.

104
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,253
Look in your right hand.

105
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,756
-I sure don't mind a bit. I really don't.
-No, no.

106
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,092
No, no. He's fine.

107
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,202
Hey.

108
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,954
I’m Brennan.

109
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,831
I’m Dale.

110
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,291
But you have to call me Dragon.

111
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,003
You have to call me Nighthawk.

112
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,358
Brennan.

113
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,862
Please don't do that.

114
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,747
Now, that's enough ketchup.
Come on. Dale.

115
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,001
-I like it.
-That's enough.

116
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,045
So, what have you been
working on recently, Dale?

117
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,547
Well...

118
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,508
...I manage a baseball team.

119
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,679
-Little League?
-Fantasy league.

120
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,898
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

121
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,026
Why don't you stop
being so confrontational, Dale?

122
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,861
I’m not the one staring at me.

123
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,071
So, Brennan, how about you?

124
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,117
I know you used to
work at PetSmart.

125
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,537
-That's right, Mr. Doback.
-Call me Robert.

126
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,082
-That's right, Robin.
-Robert.

127
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,709
Robin.

128
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:09,173
Actually, Brennan
is a really talented person.

129
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,467
He's a very gifted singer.

130
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,637
-I’m really, really good.
-How good?

131
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,224
I've been called
the songbird of my generation...

132
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,518
...by people who've heard me.

133
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,728
That good.

134
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,314
The only trick is
is that Brennan's very...

135
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,736
...particular about
who he sings in front of, so....

136
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,448
I’m his mom, for example,
I've only heard him sing twice.

137
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,159
That's funny that you say that,
because I can sing too.

138
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,036
In fact, I’ll sing right now.

139
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,331
If you wanna get down
On these hairy balls

140
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,833
-Hey!
-Why don't you jump right in?

141
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,835
It's a crotch party right up in here

142
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,213
-Stop it!
-Why don't you lick on this big joint?

143
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,132
Stop it, Dale! Stop it! Stop it!

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,425
That's cute.

145
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,594
I remember when I had my first beer.

146
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,097
That's so funny,
the last time I heard that...

147
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,265
...I laughed so hard
I fell off my dinosaur.

148
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,268
Stop right now. All right?
Let's just back off.

149
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,939
All right. Brennan, it's okay.
It's okay.

150
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,816
Hey, hey.

151
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,901
-Great, Dale.
-He said a mean thing first.

152
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,779
All right, just--
Look, you know what--? Hey, guys.

153
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,991
Okay, sleeping arrangements.
It's gonna be different...

154
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,786
...but because Dale refuses
to give up his office drum set...

155
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,332
...that means that, Brennan, you and
Dale are gonna have to share a room.

156
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,460
-But it's just temporary.
-Mom, we didn't talk about this.

157
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,131
Well, it's gonna be
an exciting adventure.

158
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,135
You wanna show him the room, Dale?
Show him where he can put his stuff?

159
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,806
-That's nice, thank you.
-Good night, Nancy.

160
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,728
Hey, listen, I like to have
a lot of fresh fruit around...

161
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,772
...and chocolate chips
in my pancakes. Okay?

162
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,191
-Write it so you don't forget.
-Show him the room.

163
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,986
She's Mom now, so....

164
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,155
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, Brennan.

165
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,951
-Good night, Mr. Doback.
-Good night, Brennan.

166
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,087
So just a few basic rules
about the house.

167
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,173
If there's any foods that you like...

168
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,843
...I suggest you put your name
on them, or they will be thrown out.

169
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,553
By me.

170
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,390
House was built in 1825
by General Custer.

171
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,768
I wanna show you this room.

172
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,020
Hold up.

173
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,731
-You see this room?
-Yeah.

174
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,775
Okay, here's the deal.

175
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,112
This is my office
and my beat laboratory.

176
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,781
Okay?

177
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,033
And this is the one rule of the house:

178
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,787
Don't ever, ever, ever...

179
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,498
...touch my drum set.

180
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,541
-You understand?
-Don't go in there and--

181
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,794
-No touching!
-All right!

182
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,254
There. I was at about six there.

183
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,381
You don't wanna see me go to 10.

184
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,009
Get your shit.
We're going to my room.

185
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,268
Honey?

186
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,898
I just found a chain of islands
that we can sail to after New Zealand.

187
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,483
That's wonderful.

188
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,238
You know,
I've been meaning to ask you....

189
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,704
Why is it that Dale never left?

190
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,668
Well, Dale has always
coasted off my accomplishments.

191
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,878
I mean, he left college
his junior year...

192
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,673
...because he said he wanted
to join the family business.

193
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,927
-But you're a medical doctor.
-Believe me, I've told him that.

194
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,305
But he just always says,
"It's all about who you know."

195
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,933
I don't know where
he got this sense of entitlement.

196
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,270
Maybe it was his mother passing.
What about Brennan?

197
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,938
From what you've told me...

198
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,524
...his younger brother Derek's
been quite successful.

199
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,111
Well, certainly when his father
and I split, that was difficult for him.

200
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,783
And this one time, when Brennan
was 17 and Derek was 14...

201
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,870
...and Brennan decided
to enter a talent show.

202
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,875
He sang a song
from an old pirate musical

203
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:17,963
But Derek got his football buddies
to replace the choir and sing:

204
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,007
"Brennan has a mangina."

205
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,635
Brennan has a mangina
Brennan has a mangina

206
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:30,350
Finally, the audience and even some
of the nastier parents started singing:

207
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,186
"Brennan has a mangina."

208
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,648
And I have to admit, for a little while
I sort ofjoined in as well.

209
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,944
From that day on,
Brennan never sang again

210
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:45,032
Derek went on to win the contest
by lip-synching "Ice Ice Baby."

211
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,414
-Oh, that's a great song.
-It is.

212
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,254
-Hey, you awake?
-Yeah.

213
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:07,179
I just want you to know I hate you.
So does my dad.

214
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,557
Well, that's fine.

215
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,560
Because guess what.

216
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,896
I hate you too.

217
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,441
And this house sucks ass.

218
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,693
Well, the only reason
you're living here...

219
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,489
...is because me and my dad decided
that your mom was really hot...

220
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,242
...and maybe we should just
both bang her.

221
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,702
And we'll put up with the retard
in the meantime.

222
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,664
-Who's the retard?
-You.

223
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,583
-Hey, y'all don't say that.
-Shut up.

224
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,877
You'll wake up my dad
and get me grounded.

225
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,921
Just shut up.

226
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:44,007
You and your mom are hillbillies.

227
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:49,054
-This is a house of learned doctors.
-You're not a doctor.

228
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,974
You're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck.

229
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,394
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

230
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,562
-I’m a curly-headed fuck?
-Yeah.

231
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,356
You better not go to sleep.

232
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,235
As soon as your eyes shut, I’m gonna
punch you square in the face.

233
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,737
I hope you stay still
when you sleep...

234
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,991
...because I’m putting a rat trap
between your legs.

235
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,412
I’m gonna take a pillowcase
and fill it full of bars of soap...

236
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,080
...and beat the shit out of you.

237
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,420
I want you out of my fucking house.

238
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,631
No way, kemosabe.

239
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,384
This is my house now.

240
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,097
How do you like The Gilded Lady?

241
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,308
I wish we could retire right now.

242
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,435
Won't be long.

243
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,281
Oh, God! It's cold!

244
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,160
Hey! Is anyone listening? Help!

245
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,042
Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you!

246
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,002
-obviously you guys are hot
You know?

247
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,172
Just revealed her cover.
I was like, "Wow, this is hot."

248
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,342
A little girl-on-girl.
A little heaven, a little hell

249
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,597
-Hey.
-Hey.

250
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,977
-Why you so sweaty?
-I was watching Cops.

251
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,522
Not supposed to have
your feet on the couch.

252
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,214
Hey, man.

253
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,216
Did you touch my drum set?

254
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,595
-Nope.
-It's just weird...

255
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,225
...because seems like someone
definitely touched my drum set.

256
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,437
Yeah, that is weird.
Because I didn't touch them.

257
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,149
-Hey! Did you touch my drum set?
-Hey, knock it off!

258
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,111
I know you touched my drumstick,
because the left one has a chip in it.

259
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,780
You fucking crazy, man?

260
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:57,868
You sound insane, do you realize
that? You should be medicated.

261
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,495
Fuck you, Brennan.
I know you touched my drum set.

262
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,414
I wanna hear that
dirty mouth admit it.

263
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,459
You get out of my face,
or I’m gonna roundhouse your ass.

264
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,128
You swear on your mom's life
that you didn't touch it!

265
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,337
I don't swear to shit!

266
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,756
That's because you fucking
touched my drum set...

267
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,967
...because I know
Cops doesn't start till 4.

268
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,182
-Where are you going?
-I’m going upstairs.

269
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,102
Because I’m gonna put my nut sack
on your drum set. Okay?

270
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,481
Don't you do that.
I am warning you right now:

271
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:32,277
If you touch my drums, I will
stab you in the neck with a knife!

272
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,781
If you even go in the room,
I will go ape-shit, you hear me?

273
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,617
Don't wanna miss a spot.

274
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,994
John Bonham's playing
"Moby Dick" for real!

275
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,705
I swear to God. I swear to God! No!

276
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,299
I warned you.

277
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,802
There's one rule in the house,
and you broke it!

278
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,564
I didn't touch your damn drum set!

279
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,653
I’m pre-diabetic!

280
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,537
You fucking fucker! I’m gonna
rub my balls on your mom's face!

281
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,665
Come back here!

282
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,131
I’ll kill you! You son of a bitch!

283
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,676
Your drum set's a whore!

284
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,011
I teabagged your fucking drum set!

285
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,723
Well, my drum set's a guy,
so that makes you gay, you fucker!

286
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,351
I’ll kill you!

287
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,770
-The story has a....
-Excuse me.

288
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,356
Dr. Doback, the phone's for you.
I think it's urgent.

289
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:52,566
Hello?

290
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,068
Robert, they're like animals!
I can't stop them!

291
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,696
Stop screaming. Please.
I’m on my way.

292
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,031
There seems to be some
savage fight going on...

293
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,409
...between my son and stepson,
so I--

294
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:07,122
Rape! Rape! Rape!

295
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,168
What's going on?

296
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,587
Robert! They won't-- They won't--

297
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,756
-Stop it! Stop it!
-Dale, what--?

298
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,883
-Stay out of it, Dad!
-Stop it!

299
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,894
What the fucking fuck?

300
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,109
Someone got some air. Snap.

301
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,486
-I still hate you.
-Still hate you.

302
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,739
Such power. It's raw power.

303
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,699
What are you doing?
It's Shark Week.

304
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,992
Okay, here's the deal:

305
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,871
Number one, you will fix
the fucking drywall now.

306
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,374
Number two, you have one month to
find jobs or you're out on your asses.

307
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,252
I will arrange interviews for Monday,
and you will go!

308
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,214
Dad, why are you talking
to me like this? I’m your son.

309
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,924
I’m not buying that crap anymore.

310
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,928
Today I saw my own son
use a bicycle as a weapon.

311
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,806
You yelled "rape"
at the top of your lungs.

312
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:11,311
Mom, I honestly thought
I was gonna be raped for a second.

313
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,980
He had the craziest look in his eyes.

314
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,649
And at one point he said,
"Let's get it on."

315
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,861
That was about the fighting.
I’m so not a raper.

316
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,821
I didn't touch your drum set, okay?

317
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:27,118
I witnessed with my eyes
your testicles touching my drum set.

318
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,829
All right, that's it! That's it!

319
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,998
You two guys leave me no choice.

320
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,792
No television for a week.

321
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,085
-What?!
-What?!

322
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,379
-We are so serious, guys.
-You're fucking high!

323
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,797
Are you out of your mind?

324
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,800
This goes in Robert's wall safe
and it's gonna stay there.

325
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,802
-No!
-Okay.

326
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,639
-This house is a fucking prison!
-On planet Bullshit!

327
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,017
In the galaxy of
This Sucks Camel Dicks!

328
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,634
Hi! Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol.

329
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:29,973
-Hey.
-You can't catch me.

330
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,772
I gotcha.

331
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,405
Aunt Carol's on fire!

332
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,174
I don't know where you learned it.

333
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,093
-Well, there's lots more where that--
-My God.

334
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:10,763
-Oh, no. What happened?
-What the--?

335
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,807
Oh, my God.

336
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,061
Maybe Dale left the back door open
and raccoons got in.

337
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,606
Nancy? Is this your purse
in the freezer?

338
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:22,609
Yes. It's Brennan.

339
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,279
He sleepwalks and he always
puts my purse in the freezer.

340
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,072
Dale sleepwalks too.

341
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,742
-Are you kidding me?
-I’m not. Look in the oven.

342
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,996
-What's in the--? Couch pillows?
-Couch pillows.

343
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,623
Yeah, Dale.

344
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:39,751
Come on.

345
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,795
-It's okay.
-It's really hard.

346
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,172
It's gonna be fine.

347
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,842
They're gonna get jobs,
they'll be gone in a month. A month.

348
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,600
Guys.

349
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,772
-Guys. Guys!
-I’ll kill you, Leonard Nimoy.

350
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,982
The clown has no penis.

351
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,693
What kind of dreams
are you guys having?

352
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,445
Hey, it's 12:30.

353
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:10,365
Brennan, your brother's
coming today, so get up.

354
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:11,866
-Today?
-Yep.

355
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:15,328
-Shit.
-What's your problem?

356
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,289
My little brother's even
a bigger asshole than you are.

357
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,334
All right, let's really nail it this time.
Here we go.

358
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:25,964
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four.

359
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,653
All right, Tommy, you're the oldest.
I’m counting on you. Come on.

360
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,668
Nice vibrato, buddy.
All right, all right, Alice, let's go.

361
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,298
Flat. It's so flat.

362
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,342
I can't even-- You don't even
look good while you're singing.

363
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,261
The worst thing I've ever heard.

364
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,556
This is $1200 a week for
voice lessons, and this is what I get?

365
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,516
Okay, I’m gonna save it
with this solo.

366
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,020
I’m Derek

367
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,816
And I can sing high like this

368
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,695
And I can sing high

369
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,033
Jesus!

370
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,884
We were so sad you guys
couldn't come to the wedding.

371
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,719
-But we completely understand.
-Yeah.

372
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,804
You were busy fishing
with Mark Cuban.

373
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,973
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, not just the Cubes...

374
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,518
...but we had Chris Daughtry,
Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay.

375
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,771
It was insane.
I mean, it was almost too much.

376
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,272
My God, that's impressive.

377
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,775
Yeah, we were down in the Gulf,
fishing bonito.

378
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,903
Robert, have you ever been down
to the Gulf on the bonito run?

379
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,905
Always wanted to.
I hear it's amazing.

380
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,574
-It is. It's gorgeous.
-Are bonito fish big?

381
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,077
What?

382
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,245
Don't interrupt
when he's telling a story.

383
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,915
-It's fine, Robert.
-I was asking about the story.

384
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,085
-What's this guy's deal?
-I don't know, son. It's okay.

385
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,838
Well, Dale, they are
what's called a trophy fish.

386
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,676
So, yeah, they're pretty big.

387
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,302
I’m sorry.

388
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,431
Anyway....

389
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,810
Oh, God, I’m sorry,
I forget where my story was going.

390
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,186
Damn it, Dale.

391
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:46,604
-No--
-Robert.

392
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,939
-What?
-What? I asked him.

393
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,817
No, he can join in, Robert.
It's really okay.

394
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,860
Well, I asked him twice
not to interrupt.

395
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,823
Gang, don't be mad at Dale for ruining
the story. And possibly the evening.

396
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,117
It's totally fine.
I have a lot more stories.

397
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,620
-Derek, that you do. That you do.
-Yeah.

398
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,374
-Guilty as charged with the stories.
-Oh, God, you're impressive.

399
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,293
Come on. I love talking to you.

400
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,172
From across the room,
I feel like we have a thing.

401
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,468
You and me, man. You're my
new stepdad. You're unbelievable.

402
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,723
-I never heard that laugh before.
-Dad, why are you acting so weird?

403
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,308
Oh, hey, by the way, guys,
where's my bro, Brennan?

404
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,988
You're right about your brother.
Total dick.

405
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,656
Told you.

406
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,450
You know what? I still hate you...

407
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,327
...but you got a pretty awesome
collection of nudie mags.

408
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,997
Yeah, I got them
from the '70s, '80s and '90s.

409
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,500
It's like masturbating
in a time machine.

410
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:53,671
Anyway, so I figure by the summer
of 2010, we can probably set sail.

411
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,716
But I think about it
every day of my life.

412
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,177
Let me ask you this, Bob,
why wait two years?

413
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,429
-Well, I gotta make more money.
-Okay, look.

414
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,847
I hear you, believe me.

415
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,850
But what if I were to tell you
that I could sell this house...

416
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,769
...for 30 percent above market?

417
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,439
-That'd be great. Could you do it?
-Yeah. In a heartbeat, Robby.

418
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:14,901
Look, I got my real-estate license
a few years back for shits and gigs.

419
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,736
I'd do it for four-fifths commish...

420
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,197
...because you know what really
gets my dick hard?

421
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,615
Helping out my friends.

422
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:23,618
That'd be fantastic.
That'd be fanta-- Oh, my God.

423
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,120
-No, it would be kick-ass, bro.
-Oh, man.

424
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,914
Right there.

425
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,042
What about Dale and Brennan?

426
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,252
Because they haven't
even gotten jobs yet.

427
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,880
God, change the record.

428
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,840
Sweet!

429
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,637
Robert. Don't talk to me like that
in front of my son.

430
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,140
Oh, come on. We're talking about
our dream, the boat. Come on.

431
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:50,186
Yeah, it's our dream, but I think it
all needs to be done in good time.

432
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,898
I’m just saying give it some thought,
okay? That's it. That's all I’m saying.

433
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,235
Holy shit, triplets.

434
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,071
It's true, three's company.

435
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,240
-It shows tons of bush.
-Hey, hey, careful.

436
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,575
Careful with that. You're crinkling.

437
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,787
That's a collector's item.
It's worth a lot of money.

438
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,247
What's up, faggots?

439
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,583
What's up, man? What, you're not
gonna come down, say hi to me?

440
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,793
Hi, Derek.

441
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,879
Whoa, calm down, man.
I’m just joking.

442
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,007
You guys, I really like
your guys' setup up here.

443
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,759
What is your problem, man?

444
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,346
My problem? I don't know.
I don't have a problem, Dale.

445
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,765
Actually, I have the opposite
of a problem:

446
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,434
I made over 550 K last year.
How much did you make?

447
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,104
-It's not about money.
-No, it's not about money.

448
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,356
Well, for me,
It's a little bit about money...

449
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,608
...and I made
that much money last year.

450
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,235
I am the VP of the biggest...

451
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:43,114
...executive-helicopter-leasing
company on the Western Seaboard.

452
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,200
Okay? I haven't had a carb
since 2004.

453
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,662
Check these out. See these?
See these boys?

454
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,163
This is what I live with.

455
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,833
Every day I lather this up
with Kiehl's in the shower.

456
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,669
You wanna touch this shit?
You wanna touch these bad boys?

457
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,046
Sorry, not gonna happen.

458
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,631
Is there something you want?

459
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,550
I promised Mom I'd offer you a job.

460
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,636
I told her it'd count as her
Christmas present, so....

461
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,680
No. I’m never gonna work for you.

462
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,015
Fine. I don't care.

463
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,643
The truth is I just smoked a J
out in my car a few minutes ago...

464
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,770
...so feeling a little spacey.

465
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,981
Know what I’m say--?
What's up with you, man?

466
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,275
What you looking at, kemosabe?

467
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,776
You--

468
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,446
You wanna punch me right now.

469
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,824
You wanna punch me right now,
but you won't.

470
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,910
You wanna punch me too?

471
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,829
You guys both look like you might
wanna hit me in the face.

472
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,165
You do, I can tell.
Well, why don't you do it?

473
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,917
Why don't you punch me
in the face?

474
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,710
Punch me in the fucking face!

475
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,011
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, my shoulder!

476
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,429
That was awesome.

477
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,598
Mom! Mom!

478
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,142
Derek, know what's always good
for shoulder pain?

479
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,603
-What?
-lf you lick my butthole.

480
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,563
Snap!

481
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,858
-Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby.
-Sure.

482
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,362
Aside from that retard trying to punch
me, it was a pretty good evening.

483
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,949
-It was our pleasure, son.
-Why are you calling him that?

484
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,367
Oh, don't, don't.

485
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,328
Bye, kids. I’ll check out that stock
you recommended, Tommy.

486
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,537
Excuse me.

487
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,166
-Hi. I’m Alice, I’m Derek's wife.
-Hi.

488
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,795
Is it true you struck Derek in the face
and he fell from the tree house?

489
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:22,463
Yeah. He asked me to.

490
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,924
Oh, that's the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

491
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,717
I want you to know that tonight...

492
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:30,388
...I am gonna pleasure myself to
the image of you doing that to Derek.

493
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,181
You know what I mean?

494
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,975
Masturbate.

495
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,810
I am.

496
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,645
Oh, Dale.

497
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:42,817
You are something.

498
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,528
You're something too.

499
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:49,240
I wanna roll you into a little ball
and shove you up my vagina.

500
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:54,120
You could just live there.
It's warm and it's cozy.

501
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,413
In your vagina?

502
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,000
I wanna walk around with you
in there and just know that...

503
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,669
...whenever I feel a little tickle
or scratch...

504
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,172
...that it's just your hair
up my vagina.

505
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,425
Please, just do it for me.

506
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,093
What's happening?

507
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,055
Kiss me.

508
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,603
I know. I know. It's too much.

509
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,148
It's too much.

510
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,862
I hate my life, Dale.

511
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,490
Dale, I hate my life!
I have nobody to talk to.

512
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,617
-Well, you seemed okay at the di--
-Please.

513
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,703
Alice! Honey, come on!

514
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,498
Dane Cook, pay-per-view,
20 minutes. Let's go!

515
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:43,044
Coming, honey!
I’m just talking to Dale.

516
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,755
This is so stupid.

517
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,174
Call me.

518
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,594
-I love you.
-Okay.

519
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,186
-Hey. What'd she want?
-What?

520
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,106
Nothing. Who's--? Who?

521
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,150
Alice.

522
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,321
We were just talking. Not--
It was not about sex or anything.

523
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,699
I can't believe you hit Derek.

524
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,494
I know. Did you see
the expression on his face?

525
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,580
-That was cool.
-Listen.

526
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,750
I know that we started out as foe.

527
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,669
But after that courageous act...

528
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,923
...that you showed me
against the one they call Derek...

529
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,844
...maybe someday
we could become friends.

530
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,349
Friends who ride majestic,
translucent steeds...

531
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,685
...shooting flaming arrows
across the Bridge of Hemdale.

532
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,856
I would follow you into the mists
of Avalon, if that's what you mean.

533
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,360
Do you wanna see something cool
that only three people have seen?

534
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,825
Okay, open your eyes.

535
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,537
See that black smudge
right there on the blade?

536
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,539
-Yeah.
-Look at it closely.

537
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,166
-Pretty recognizable signature.
-No.

538
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,752
Randy Jackson from American Idol.

539
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,089
Why do you have Randy Jackson's
autograph on a martial-arts weapon?

540
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,716
I bumped into him
and all I had was this sword...

541
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,636
...and you're not gonna not get
Randy Jackson's autograph.

542
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,222
I would've done
the exact same thing.

543
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,309
Now, do you wanna see
something really cool?

544
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,603
-Of course.
-Turn off the lights.

545
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,401
Industrial-strength
night-vision goggles.

546
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,236
Holy Santa Claus shit.

547
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,489
Can you imagine if we had these
when we were 12?

548
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,908
Even better.
We got them when we're 40.

549
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,580
You know what's amazing? They're
not that noticeable on your face.

550
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,498
-Right?
-Yeah.

551
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,128
I can't believe I've been living here
for two weeks...

552
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,130
...and I’m walking
around this place...

553
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,924
...thinking I've got a huge doucher
for a stepbrother.

554
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,427
Secretly, you're not a doucher.

555
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,429
Let's play a game, all right?

556
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,265
On the count of three,
name your favorite dinosaur.

557
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,810
Don't even think about it, just name it.
Ready? One, two, three.

558
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,478
-Velociraptor.
-Velociraptor.

559
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,149
Favorite non-pornographic magazine
to masturbate to.

560
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,651
-Good Housekeeping
-Good Housekeeping

561
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,654
If you were a chick, who's
the one guy you'd sleep with?

562
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,239
-John Stamos.
-John Stamos.

563
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,700
-What?
-Did we just become best friends?

564
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,285
Yep.

565
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,537
Do you wanna go do karate
in the garage?

566
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,122
Yup!

567
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,310
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

568
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,400
I think they're starting to
like each other.

569
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,986
I got a really bad feeling about this.

570
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,156
-Sword fight!
-I know.

571
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,532
Sword fight!

572
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,706
-Exactly the same!
-I know! That's so weird.

573
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,419
Now you're in trouble.

574
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,714
-Come on!
-No!

575
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,175
They're betting against you,
but you can do it!

576
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,844
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

577
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,722
Is this a bad time?

578
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,266
What the hell's going on?

579
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,352
Ma, Mr. Doback, okay,
Dale and I were just--

580
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,354
Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback.

581
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,855
Sorry. Okay.

582
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,650
Mom, Doback...

583
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,528
...we think it would be very prudent--

584
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,197
-Can we turn our beds into bunk beds?
-Yes.

585
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,199
Why are you guys so sweaty?

586
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,244
We've already figured out how.
The beds match up perfectly.

587
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,664
It would give us so much extra space
in our room to do activities.

588
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,873
Please say yes.

589
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,334
You don't need our permission
to build bunk beds.

590
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,712
You're adults.
You can do what you want.

591
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,964
So...?

592
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,426
I’m not making myself clear.

593
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,137
I don't give a fuck.

594
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,723
Now, you both have
several interviews tomorrow.

595
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,393
I would think you'd be focused
on that and not building bunk beds.

596
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,148
-So...?
-So...?

597
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:18,569
-We can? No?
-Yes. Yes, you can make bunk beds.

598
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,988
-I knew it.
-Okay. You are not gonna regret this.

599
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,948
We'll get so much more
activities done.

600
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,076
This is the funnest night ever!

601
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,580
This is so scary.

602
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:34,126
-How you doing over there?
-Really good.

603
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,586
Okay.

604
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,796
Does your son know anything
about carpentry?

605
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,549
No, not a th-- Did I hear a drill?

606
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,385
-Dale! Dale, no power tools!
-Power tools.

607
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,721
-What?
-No power tools!

608
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:49,558
-No, I forgot, I have to brush my teeth.
-That is not your toothbrush.

609
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,227
Oh, okay. Well, I’m all done anyway.

610
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,729
-We did it.
-We did it!

611
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:54,980
It looks amazing!

612
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,233
Look at that! That looks like
what you'd buy from a store!

613
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,070
-Should've been a bunk bed all along.
-Look at this space.

614
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:04,114
-We could do aerobics in here.
-So many activities!

615
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,325
-Do step class.
-It's making my head spin...

616
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,786
-...how many activities we can do.
-Play Army men.

617
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,245
-Yeah.
-Come on.

618
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,669
Hey, I never asked you.
Do you like guacamole?

619
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:22,132
Oh, Brennan! Oh, God!

620
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,468
Brennan! Brennan!

621
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,179
Dad. Nancy. It's bad.

622
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,473
It's so bad.
There's blood everywhere.

623
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:33,268
The bunk beds were a terrible idea.
Why'd you let us do that?

624
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,686
It's so bad!

625
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,146
How would you describe that?

626
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,860
-It's not so bad.
-Right. See?

627
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,738
Put your beds back.

628
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,032
Rumpus time is over.

629
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,327
You got a big day tomorrow.
You need your eight hours.

630
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:57,084
And although she was 88 years old
she never stopped believing.

631
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,002
It's 8:20 in the a.m.

632
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,005
Coming up next, a recent study
by the American Council....

633
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,174
Look at her. She's hot.

634
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,595
Okay, guys, this is it.
Good luck. Don't be late.

635
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,348
Dad, I need to borrow
some clothes for the interview...

636
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,350
...since I don't have
any fancy clothes.

637
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,812
You go in my closet, take whatever
you need. You guys gotta look sharp.

638
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,981
This is the most important
day of our lives.

639
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,607
-Okay.
-No pressure, no pressure.

640
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,984
-All right? Relax.
-Okay.

641
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,235
I gotta go. I gotta go.

642
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,404
This is your day.
Remember that. You own it.

643
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,448
-This is your one day!
-All right.

644
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,702
Mr. Huff, Mr. Jeener
is ready for your interview.

645
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,037
Actually, we'll be
interviewing as a team.

646
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,457
We're here to fuck shit up.

647
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,713
Move it!

648
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,598
Hey!

649
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,267
Well, Brennan, you certainly
have had a lot ofjobs.

650
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,810
I’m a bit of a spark plug.

651
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,480
And, Human Resources lady,
when I think--

652
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,566
-You know, it's-- Actually, it's Pam.
-I’m sorry.

653
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,652
-Well, Pan....
-No, my name is Pam.

654
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,907
-Are you saying Pan or Pam?
-I’m saying Pam.

655
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,410
Yeah, I’m sorry, who is this
gentleman sitting behind you?

656
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,538
Hello, Ms. Lady. I’m Dale.
I’m Brennan's stepbrother...

657
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:20,167
...and I think I might be able to help
with the Pan-Pam dilemma.

658
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,252
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Pam.

659
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,087
-Pan.
-Pam.

660
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,256
-Pand. There's a D on the end.
-With an M.

661
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:31,929
-There's no D. It's Pam.
-It's like "comb," except P-A-N-M.

662
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,806
-N-N. There's two N's.
-Two M's. That was the confusion.

663
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,308
No, there's just one M.

664
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,519
What do you say we interview you?

665
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,855
All right. Yes, that's a
sometimes-useful exercise.

666
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,440
Please put your hand down.

667
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,775
Go ahead.

668
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,278
How much money do you make
a year before taxes?

669
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,156
Okay, I’m actually not comfortable
answering that.

670
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,951
-Come on!
-We're doing the interview, not you.

671
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,871
Here's a shot out of a cannon:
Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife.

672
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,290
You gotta fuck one,
marry one, kill one. Go!

673
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,084
I think we're done here. Thank you.

674
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,127
First of all,
I needed someone to work--

675
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,046
Wait, shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

676
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,506
I think we've had enough--

677
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,716
-Shush up for one second.
-Shut your mouth.

678
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,803
-Wait, shut your mouth.
-I’m sorry, what did you just say?

679
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,514
-You're just coming off stupid.
-I’m coming off stupid?

680
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:19,476
You're wearing tuxedos to a job that
requires you to clean bathrooms.

681
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,355
-Please leave this office, we're done.
-Do we get any sort of souvenir?

682
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,148
Get out of my office!

683
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:29,027
I’m looking to hire guys I don't mind
hanging out with for 12 hours a day.

684
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,654
You guys seem like cool guys.

685
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,824
Got hair similar to mine,
you wear tuxedos to the interview.

686
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,826
That's funny, it's ironic. I get that.

687
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:39,663
Underplaying the whole formality of it.
I think that's funny as hell.

688
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,666
So let's do this, you know?
You guys are hired. You're in.

689
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,544
Unless you're the weirdest guys ever
and I don't see it.

690
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,212
Great.

691
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,232
-Was that a fart?
-I don't know.

692
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,276
I can taste it.

693
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,569
On my tongue.

694
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,196
Okay, I’ll be honest with you.
I did fart.

695
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,366
Is that onion? Onion and--
Onion and ketchup.

696
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,370
-It stinks. And this is a small room.
-Shit.

697
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,873
Okay, now the tuxedos
seem kind of fucked up.

698
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,836
God. We were so close.

699
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,298
So, what do we do for jobs?
Is your dad really gonna kick us out?

700
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:35,594
Listen, don't worry about my dad.

701
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,430
Got him sewn up.

702
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:41,767
We've gotta start thinking bigger,
though, Brennan.

703
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:45,062
Listen, what are you really good at?

704
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,898
Singing. I’m a world-class singer.

705
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,776
See? Right there,
that's an amazing skill.

706
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,402
Now, what am I good at?

707
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,405
I can shred on the drums
and I’m a marketing wiz.

708
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,407
Put all that together,
what do you get?

709
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,912
-I don't know, a band?
-No, that's been done before.

710
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,250
Even better: we are gonna start an
international entertainment company.

711
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,586
The biggest and the best.

712
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,090
And we're gonna call it
Prestige Worldwide.

713
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,092
That sounds so cool.

714
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,513
I feel like a lightning bolt
hit the tip of my penis.

715
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,099
Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,268
We're brothers. This is why we met.

717
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,437
-To form this alliance, right?
-Right?

718
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,107
That's why our parents met,
so this idea could happen.

719
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,110
-Okay, what do we do?
-We get to work.

720
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,613
And we hit the beat laboratory
right now. Let's go.

721
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,323
-What?
-Wait.

722
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,991
What time is it?

723
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,660
-4:30.
-4:30.

724
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,745
4:32.

725
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,710
-I can't go down Whitworth right now.
-Okay.

726
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,795
We should go this way.

727
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,090
-What's up?
-Chris Gardocki.

728
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,550
-What?
-He gets in my face...

729
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,052
...and I just don't wanna
deal with the hassle now.

730
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,013
-Are you this scared?
-Can we please go the long way?

731
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,308
-Down Cutler?
-Yeah.

732
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,227
But that's 45 minutes.

733
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,146
You're gonna shame me
into doing this.

734
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,815
-You sound stupid.
-You'll be sorry. Okay, I’m stupid.

735
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,109
Oh, man.

736
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,529
Oh, God, there they are.

737
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,991
Oh, my God, is that Dale Doback?

738
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,702
-Let's make him lick dog shit.
-Yeah.

739
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,707
Hey, fag-stick. Long time, no see.

740
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,501
Is that your boyfriend?
Is that your butt buddy?

741
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,087
Look, Mr. Gardocki,
just leave me alone, will you?

742
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,047
Shut your mouth, ese.

743
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,384
You guys just go back and have fun
on your jungle gym, okay?

744
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,762
Does butt buddy have a name?

745
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,849
If you're referring to me as
butt buddy, yes, I do have a name.

746
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,350
It's Brennan Huff.

747
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,687
If you don't come over here
and lick that white dog shit...

748
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:53,064
...I’m gonna plow into your nose
with my fist.

749
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:57,110
-I’m not licking any white dog shit.
-I’ll lick the shit if you leave us alone.

750
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,447
Dale, you're not licking
dog shit, okay? They're kids.

751
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,866
-Brennan, it's just dog shit.
-It's ridiculous!

752
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,037
-Hello, how are--?
-Oh, God!

753
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,956
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

754
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,126
Get them!

755
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:28,433
So maybe you don't
go down that way anymore.

756
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,477
Maybe you go the long way home.

757
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,563
That's what we talked about.
We'll take the long way home.

758
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,483
You know in that one scene
in The Wizard of Oz...

759
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:39,486
...when the flying monkeys
pull apart the Scarecrow?

760
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,696
That's what it was like.

761
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,366
-It's okay, it's okay.
-I’m so sorry.

762
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:47,160
Is my dad mad about
the stuff that happened?

763
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,913
Robert was very upset, yes.

764
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,791
He knows that you interviewed
as a team.

765
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,501
And he heard about the fart.

766
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,586
-Oh, he did?
-Yeah.

767
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,505
You just couldn't hold it, or you--?

768
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,591
-No. I thought it was gonna be silent.
-It was not silent.

769
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,427
Just kept going, and it made a sound.
It was embarrassing.

770
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,637
It got louder.

771
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,682
So listen, Bobby,
I’ll get those keys made tomorrow...

772
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,352
-...and then we'll start setting up times.
-Thank you.

773
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,063
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

774
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,439
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

775
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,817
-Always nice to see you.
-You too.

776
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,536
Hey, guys.

777
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,788
Looks like your
free ride's over, huh?

778
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,790
Have fun living on the streets.

779
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:36,877
Okay, cool. Good chatting, you guys.
Bye, Mom.

780
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,295
-Bye.
-See you, buddy.

781
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,758
What was he doing here?

782
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,760
We're putting the house
on the market.

783
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:49,472
-Where are we moving?
-Is the house haunted?

784
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,309
Nancy and I are retiring...

785
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,228
...and sailing around the world
on my boat.

786
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,689
We are living the dream.

787
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,149
Well, what about us?

788
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:05,572
I’m sorry. Robert- We thought that...

789
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,534
...you should take responsibility
for your own lives.

790
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:10,911
This is the exciting part:

791
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,413
We're going to put enough
money in your accounts...

792
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,540
...for a security deposit
on an apartment.

793
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,000
What's this all about?

794
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:21,671
More than just money, we're gonna get
you another kind of support as well.

795
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,674
You're both gonna see therapists.
Nancy thinks it'll help.

796
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:28,595
-Guys, that's nonnegotiable.
-Hold on. We're not going on the boat...

797
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:32,098
...Derek's selling the house,
we have to go to therapy?

798
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,226
-What the fuck happened?
-Hey!

799
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,521
Look, I know this seems
really, really sudden...

800
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,024
...and just sort of unfair
and cruel and--

801
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:44,277
-But it's nonnegotiable.
-But it's nonnegotiable.

802
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,863
I got a bellyful
of white dog crap in me...

803
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,949
...and now you lay this shit on me?

804
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,077
You're adults. It's time
you started acting like adults.

805
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,288
-Mom.
-I’m not backing down, Brennan.

806
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,873
Don't even try.

807
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:00,126
I know it seems hard,
but it's the best thing for both of you.

808
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,920
We do it because we love you.

809
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:05,799
Dad, I’m doing this because
I love you: fuck you.

810
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,968
-Anything else?
-No.

811
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,553
Bon voyage! Have a great time!

812
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,473
Hey, what's up, Derek?

813
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,683
Yeah.

814
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,142
-Know what?
-Look what I got.

815
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,562
I’m sitting here thinking we finally got
a family together here...

816
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,233
...and now it's about to be taken away
because they think we're losers.

817
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,612
-Because they don't understand us?
-Yeah.

818
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,282
They don't get that this lifestyle
is a choice.

819
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,577
And all they think about
is that stupid boat.

820
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,123
I swear, I’m so pissed off
at my mom.

821
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,793
As soon as she is of age,
I’m putting her in a home.

822
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,713
We have got to get
Prestige Worldwide going.

823
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,923
It's the thing that's
gonna save this family.

824
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,926
I was thinking we should
have a investor presentation...

825
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,344
...like on The Apprentice.

826
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,680
We gotta start
with some capital somewhere.

827
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,765
Here's the thing, though:

828
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,102
If we're gonna start
a huge multinational corporation...

829
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,812
...I have to hear you sing.

830
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,690
Can't you just trust that
I’m a really, really good singer?

831
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:07,485
Just one song, so I know
what your voice sounds like.

832
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,779
Yeah, yeah. I’ll just do it.

833
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,117
No big deal. I’ll just dive into it
and just start singing.

834
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,207
Jesus, my heart is beating
so fast right now.

835
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,127
Okay, just do it. Just do it.

836
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,336
Just--

837
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,887
You know, I don't know.

838
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:19,349
I didn't sing too loud, because I don't
wanna wake up Robert and Nancy.

839
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:22,936
My throat's sore. I've had
a sore throat for a month and a half.

840
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,939
And this is not an acoustic
environment that's suitable...

841
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,191
...to request this from me.

842
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,611
You gotta know,
I’m not just some guy.

843
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,281
Brennan, that is
the voice of an angel.

844
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,702
Brennan, I can't even make
eye contact with you right now.

845
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,622
Your voice is like a combination
of Fergie and Jesus.

846
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,666
Why can't you do that
in front of people?

847
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,668
Are you messing with me right now?

848
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:49,754
It's me, Dale.

849
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,048
You're good.

850
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,093
-I know.
-This is gonna sound weird...

851
00:50:55,261 --> 00:51:00,390
...but for a second, I think
you took on the shape of a unicorn.

852
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:04,394
I felt like I was hovering
above my own body...

853
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,146
...watching myself sing.

854
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,064
Now, let's move on
to other business.

855
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:11,734
First thing tomorrow, we gotta get
cracking on this investor presentation.

856
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,863
And guess what else.
This just came to me.

857
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,449
-We're making a music video.
-Yeah!

858
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,452
What do we do about Derek
and the house?

859
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,248
Don't worry about him.

860
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:37,218
Oh, it's a great "nabe."

861
00:51:37,386 --> 00:51:39,262
Frank Gifford
used to live down the block.

862
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,599
-The Giff?
-Yeah, the Giff. Right down the block.

863
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,310
I’m getting
a really good feeling about this.

864
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,519
I am so glad.

865
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,355
You get us that 10-year
interest-only loan, we got a deal.

866
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,525
Hey, fuckers!
Welcome to the neighborhood!

867
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:56,487
-My name is Craig.
-The neighbor is a Nazi?

868
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:00,533
You guys ever need fertilizer,
I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons.

869
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:04,621
Hey, folks! How you doing?
You're gonna love this neighborhood.

870
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,456
Every single house here recycles.

871
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,541
-Okay, we're done here.
-Yeah, okay.

872
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,669
Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick.

873
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,464
Dale, I don't know how much
you know about therapy...

874
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,800
...but it usually starts by you
telling me something about yourself.

875
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,428
I work at a college as a janitor...

876
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,223
...even though I’m smarter
than most of the people there.

877
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,309
Sometimes I see an equation
written on a blackboard...

878
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,479
...like half an equation,
and I’ll just figure it out.

879
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,981
-Is this Good Will Hunting?
-No.

880
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,151
It sounds a lot like the plot
of Good Will Hunting.

881
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:39,030
Yeah. Anyway.
My best friend is Ben Affleck....

882
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:42,325
So I thought we'd begin
talking about your parents' divorce.

883
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:43,660
Okay.

884
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,828
How old were you
when they got divorced?

885
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,164
-Fifteen.
-That's a hard age.

886
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,251
-Yes. Yeah.
-Do you wanna talk...

887
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,544
-...about some of those feelings?
-I love you.

888
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:57,173
-Obviously, you don't know me.
-I love you so much.

889
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,718
Thank you. And I will take that
as a feeling that you have...

890
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,263
...of comfortability with me.

891
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,098
It's more than comfortability.

892
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:08,476
-I mean, I fucking love you.
-Okay. I th--

893
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,520
I’m just thinking
about our life together.

894
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,064
I feel like I’m walking on a cloud.

895
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,358
My penis is tingling right now.

896
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:19,237
-That is so off-putting.
-You're not feeling this?

897
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:23,366
In no way, shape or form do I feel
any feelings of intimacy towards you...

898
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,535
...in any way whatsoever.

899
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,537
You got a really dope
front lawn here.

900
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,622
You and your homeboys
can play on that.

901
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,749
-You can just say "It looks good."
-Yeah.

902
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,959
No, that's how I talk.

903
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:36,462
Oh, you got a really fresh
entryway here. Pretty awesome.

904
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,299
--show you the front of the house,
which is actual--

905
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:43,553
Will you vultures please give us some
privacy? He just died last night.

906
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:45,221
What is going on here?

907
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,724
It was the asbestos in here,
that's what did it!

908
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,350
I've seen too many dead bodies.

909
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,894
-I can't be in here. I can't.
-No, no, no.

910
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,859
-Not bad.
-Eat shit, Derek.

911
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,654
-Awesome B-day party, broheisens.
-You the man, Derek.

912
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:04,198
Okay, who's this from? TJ?

913
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,325
Where are
the rest of my gifts, dude?

914
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,327
Totally joking around, TJ.

915
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,746
All right.

916
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:14,292
Oh, yes! Yes! Callaway 3-wood.

917
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,752
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

918
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,670
Yeah.

919
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,423
-Bomb it down the fairway, bitches!
-That's right.

920
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,678
Hi, my name is Jim.
Wanna suck my dick for money?

921
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,473
-It's just me. Hi.
-Oh, my God.

922
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,933
What are you doing?
This is the men's bathroom.

923
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,935
Happy anniversary.

924
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,438
-It's our second date.
-What?

925
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:39,567
Listen, I’m sick of being
all coy and bashful, Dale. Okay?

926
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,612
-We're in the bathroom.
-This'll just take a minute.

927
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,032
There's really little you can
do about it. Let me just hop on.

928
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,577
It's all slippery.

929
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,579
Oh, my God!

930
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,796
It's getting tingly.
Something's gonna happen, Alice!

931
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,098
Oh, we just had sex.

932
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,643
-Just the way I imagined it.
-I like you.

933
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,812
I love you.

934
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,147
-Stay golden, Ponyboy. I gotta pee.
-Okay.

935
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,318
Oh, my God.

936
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,570
You're incredible.

937
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,156
Say hello to my little friend.

938
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,702
-Just kidding. It's from Scarface.
-Scarface.

939
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,039
Shut the fuck up!

940
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,917
-Sweet-ass gift, Teej.
-Yeah, not bad.

941
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,836
-I got it all mapped out.
-Okay.

942
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,339
-I’m following your lead, though.
-I’ll get all eyes on us.

943
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:44,841
-Okay.
-Just like we planned.

944
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,135
And then we'll drop the hammer.

945
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,139
Everyone, if I could have
your attention, please.

946
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,683
For those of you
who don't know me...

947
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,769
-...my name's Dale Doback.
-Check. Check.

948
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,647
Probably wondering
why we gathered you here tonight...

949
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,607
...besides Derek's birthday.

950
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,194
We got a special surprise for you,
Derek, and everybody here--

951
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,445
-Check, check.
-Check.

952
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,573
-Dale. No, please.
-Don't interrupt them.

953
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,741
-I’m begging you.
-You wanna shut this down?

954
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,869
-Just hold on.
-Derek, for your birthday...

955
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,453
...we thought we'd roll out...

956
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,831
...a once-in-a-lifetime
business opportunity.

957
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,124
Happy birthday, Derek.

958
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,917
Music.

959
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:28,593
Prestige Worldwide,
wide, wide, wide.

960
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,053
Prestige Worldwide.

961
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,015
-The first word in entertainment.
-First word.

962
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,225
-Management.
-Financial portfolios.

963
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,227
-Insurance.
-Computers.

964
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,731
-Black leather gloves.
-Research and development.

965
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,859
Putting in the man-hours to study
the science of what you need.

966
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:48,029
Last week we put Liquid Paper
on a bee...

967
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:49,488
...and it died.

968
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:51,032
-Security.
-Security.

969
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,450
-And--
-And.

970
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,370
-Possibly you.
-Possibly you.

971
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,665
-Oh, this is classic. This is--
-We'd like to present...

972
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:04,086
...the world premiere of Prestige
Worldwide's first music video...

973
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:08,424
...by our first act, Huff and Doback.

974
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,594
-Roll it.
-Roll it.

975
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,890
Pay close attention, Dad.
It's gonna look familiar.

976
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,976
-This is-- This is perfect.
-Is that my boat?

977
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,437
Yes, it is.

978
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,189
What are you doing on my boat?

979
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,858
The Nina, the Pinta
The Santa Maria

980
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:28,569
I’ll do you in the bottom
While you're drinking sangria

981
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,155
Nachos and Lemonheads
On my dad's boat

982
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,366
You won't go down
'Cause my dick can float

983
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,118
We sail around the world
And go port to port

984
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,871
Every time I come
I produce a quart

985
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:41,332
That is offensive. Brennan, Dale.

986
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,960
I gotta have me my boats and ho's

987
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,295
Deadliest Catch without the crabs

988
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,090
We're almost out of gas
Call the Arabs

989
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,509
Pull up the anchor
'Cause we're leaving dry land

990
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:54,178
Get below deck
With a dick in your hand

991
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:56,597
Boats and ho's
Boats and ho's

992
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:59,558
I gotta have me my boats and ho's

993
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,936
Are you ready for some
world-class vocalization?

994
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,771
-Get a partner.
-Wait a minute.

995
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,565
-Who's steering the boat?
-Dad, please shut up.

996
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:07,984
Please shut up!

997
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,537
Yeah!

998
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,627
So...

999
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,046
...big question is:

1000
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:33,092
Aside from the damage to the boat,
which we will fix...

1001
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,012
...what'd you think
of the presentation?

1002
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:42,268
Brennan, I think that what you did
to Robert's boat was horrid.

1003
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,770
Having said that,
I think that both of you boys...

1004
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,399
...showed a lot of enthusiasm
and inventiveness.

1005
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,651
Yes. Thank you.

1006
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,945
You gotta be kidding me.

1007
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,449
They destroyed our dream
and you're calling it inventive.

1008
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,201
-No, no, no. I didn't mean it like that.
-Yes, you did.

1009
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,619
Come on, you did.

1010
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,373
It's gonna be four years, at least,
before we can sail anywhere.

1011
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,918
-And you could care less, admit it.
-I will not admit that...

1012
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,504
-...because it is not true.
-Oh, yeah.

1013
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,716
But, you know,
I do think that you could show...

1014
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,970
...a little bit more attentiveness
to your son and your stepson...

1015
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,805
...who obviously need you.

1016
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,223
It's true, Dr. Doback.

1017
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,268
You've been very cold
and unsupportive of our dreams.

1018
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,228
You wrecked my fucking boat,
you goon!

1019
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,481
Don't speak to my son like that.

1020
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,192
Your son's costing me $80,000.

1021
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,570
We could bicker about this all night,
but what's done is done, Dad.

1022
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:37,573
-Are you guys gonna invest or not?
-That's it! That's it!

1023
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,533
-What are you doing?
-Grab the wheel!

1024
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,119
I can't believe
you're being so stingy.

1025
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,789
-Robert, come down.
-It's a simple business decision.

1026
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,624
You jackaloons!

1027
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:50,252
You're failures! Failures!

1028
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,255
And you're embarrassing yourself,
you geriatric fuck!

1029
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,882
-Brennan.
-Two things:

1030
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,843
You keep your liver-spotted hands
off my beautiful mother.

1031
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,095
She's a saint!

1032
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,807
Then you sit down and you write Dale
and Brennan a check for $10,000.

1033
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,016
Oh, stop it.

1034
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:08,062
Or I’m gonna shove one of those fake
hearing devices so far up your ass...

1035
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,980
-Brennan!
-...you can hear the sound...

1036
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,983
...of your small intestine
as it produces shit!

1037
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,444
-All right, here we go.
-Oh, my Lord.

1038
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,656
Somebody should've done this
a long time ago, and I’m gonna do it.

1039
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,282
-What are you doing?
-Robert.

1040
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,284
There are consequences
for your actions.

1041
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,162
-No! Robert!
-Dad!

1042
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:27,456
-This is not the answer.
-You're next, mister.

1043
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,749
-You understand me?
-Yes.

1044
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,961
-Certain behaviors...
-Let go of me.

1045
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:35,381
-...will not be tolerated!
-My ass is on fire!

1046
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:50,104
Wow, the tree looks great, Nancy.
Really tasteful.

1047
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,816
Thank you, Dale. That's a very nice
sweater you're wearing.

1048
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:57,570
It was my mom's.
I took the shoulder pads out.

1049
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,655
Oh, and, Brennan? Denise called...

1050
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,366
...and she said she can't go out
with you on New Year's Eve...

1051
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:05,411
...because she's not your girlfriend,
she's your therapist.

1052
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,912
-Is that what she said?
-Yeah.

1053
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,164
She's a rascal.

1054
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,666
Hey, Dad, Nancy?

1055
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:15,880
Would it be cool if Brennan and l
opened just one present each...

1056
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,215
...since it's Christmas Eve?

1057
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,260
I’m gonna go down to the
Cheesecake Factory, have a drink.

1058
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,016
But it's Christmas Eve.

1059
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,976
Merry Christmas.

1060
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,562
-Yes.
-Yeah.

1061
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,939
I had my eye on one.

1062
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,275
I hope it's what I think it is.

1063
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:38,652
Oh, my God. Hulk Hands!

1064
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,321
Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands?

1065
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:48,871
Well, you reek of Scotch
and cheesecake.

1066
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,332
You know...

1067
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:56,879
...tonight at the Cheesecake Factory
was the happiest I've been in months.

1068
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,716
-Well, then I feel very sorry for you.
-Well, just....

1069
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:04,803
Nancy, I don't know if I can ever
forgive them for wrecking my boat.

1070
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,681
-Why are you giving up?
-I’m not giving up. I’m not.

1071
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:11,852
-You are. You're giving up on our boys.
-But they're 40.

1072
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,980
I don't care how old they are.
They're still our children.

1073
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,234
Well, sometime it's got to matter
how old they are.

1074
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,111
That's all we do, is--
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1075
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,865
Oh, it--
You know, they'll go back to bed.

1076
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,451
See? They're sleepwalking.

1077
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,620
No. No.

1078
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:32,039
See, back to bed.

1079
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,457
They'll be fine.

1080
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,335
Just nonsense.
I’m gonna wake them up.

1081
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,964
-No. Why would you do such a thing?
-Well, because it's--

1082
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,550
-Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker.
-See, that's it.

1083
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,176
-We can't ever do anything.
-No.

1084
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,804
But they could do real harm
to themselves or others.

1085
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,557
-Oh, the Christmas presents.
-No, guys-- No, no, don't--

1086
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,101
-No. But--
-I think we should take control.

1087
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:55,479
-It's always about them.
-How do you propose to do that?

1088
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,815
-Oh, Jesus.
-Whatever you do, don't wake them.

1089
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:01,026
They might do real harm
to themselves or others.

1090
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,029
-Not everybody does know that.
-Oh, the Christmas tree!

1091
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,366
Oh, not the-- No, don't--
All right, that's it!

1092
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,201
-I’m waking them up!
-No! No!

1093
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,995
-Don't wake them up!
-That's a myth!

1094
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,663
-Wake up, both of you.
-Don't.

1095
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,334
I told you! I told you!

1096
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,629
Stop it! Don't hurt him!

1097
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,186
--grant me this one,
because I was pretty wasted.

1098
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,480
So I put my lips
around that breathalyzer...

1099
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,941
...and I saw those numerals pop up:

1100
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:45,904
0.079.

1101
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,451
So I started going to Chad
Michael Murray's Christmas party.

1102
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:52,703
I think that was the year.
And just driving--

1103
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:56,457
I have to interrupt you. Robert, while
the children are in the living room...

1104
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:59,501
...I think this would be a good time
to make our announcement.

1105
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,588
-What's going on?
-It's over.

1106
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,091
I’m gonna be moving in
with my friend Jack Handle...

1107
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,761
...and Nancy found a townhouse
in the city.

1108
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,638
What is this? What's happening?

1109
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:15,225
What Robert is trying to say
is that we are getting a divorce.

1110
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,312
-Don't do this.
-No. No!

1111
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,189
-I could've called this one.
-No.

1112
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,191
-Yeah.
-Is it our fault?

1113
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,401
-Is it because we were bad?
-No. No.

1114
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,571
The main thing that
Robert and I talked about...

1115
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,324
...is that we did not want you two
to blame yourselves.

1116
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,869
-What can we do to fix it?
-Dale, honey, are you okay?

1117
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,914
-Why are you calling him "honey"?
-I cannot stress this enough:

1118
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,709
-It is not your fault.
-Whose fault is it?

1119
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,253
-Fuck it, I wanna fucking know!
-Let's cut the shit.

1120
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:47,049
-It is directly your fault.
-Robert.

1121
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,675
You destroyed my boat.

1122
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,386
You beat me up in your sleep...

1123
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:54,598
...and worst of all, you made
Nancy and I resent each other.

1124
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:59,478
-It is absolutely 150 percent your fault!
-Of course it's their fault.

1125
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:03,065
They're the world's biggest dickheads,
and they're living in your house.

1126
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,776
-Shut up, Derek.
-I’m sorry, but that--

1127
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:10,155
Please don't cry like that.
Please don't, Brennan.

1128
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:18,038
-Mommy!
-Dale!

1129
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:21,083
I told you that they would feel
completely to blame.

1130
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:25,003
-Oh, let's grow up.
-I think I’m going to throw up.

1131
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,589
-I think I’m gonna throw up...
-Don't throw up.

1132
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,634
...all the nice dinner that I had.
I’m gonna throw it up.

1133
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:34,096
-You're not gonna throw up.
-He's gonna throw up.

1134
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,975
-Come on.
-My God, he threw up. Oh, this is ugly.

1135
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:40,227
-Hey, guys. Guys.
-This is not nice!

1136
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:43,355
-All right, dipshits. Right here.
-Stop it, Derek.

1137
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:48,735
-One, two, three....
-I don't want my picture taken now.

1138
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:57,953
Good luck, and remember, I need you
out of this house by tomorrow.

1139
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,289
No exceptions.

1140
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,717
If there's anything you need,
anything that you boys need...

1141
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:14,595
...you just give me a call. Okay?
It's all right.

1142
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,480
Hey. Are you awake?

1143
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,482
Yeah.

1144
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,696
I can't believe we actually
have to move out of this house.

1145
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,699
I know. I feel bad.

1146
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,494
Hey, you know,
we don't have to whisper anymore.

1147
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,037
Mom and Dad aren't here.

1148
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,247
Yeah, but can we keep
doing it, though?

1149
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,583
It helps me pretend that they are.

1150
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,586
You must feel just terrible.

1151
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,507
-I mean, I know I feel bad.
-Yeah.

1152
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,009
But I can't imagine how you feel...

1153
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:57,095
...after my dad looked
right at you and said...

1154
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,723
...it's all your fault
that they broke up.

1155
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:03,769
That's funny, because my mom said:

1156
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:06,355
"If that curly-headed fuck Dale
wasn't here...

1157
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,982
...everything would be perfect."

1158
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:13,028
-You take that back.
-No way. It's your fault.

1159
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,197
You know what your problem is?

1160
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:18,116
You live in a fantasy land.
You refuse to get a job...

1161
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,994
...and you don't know what it's like
to work for something.

1162
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:24,748
You don't take responsibility for
your actions. This is all your fault!

1163
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:28,001
Well, you're a mama's boy
who's too chicken to sing in public!

1164
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:31,338
Yeah, that's right.

1165
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,799
Run away, little boy,
because you know it's true.

1166
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,551
Just avoid everything.

1167
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,554
What are you doing?

1168
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,349
-Dale broke up Mom and Dad
-Motherfucker!

1169
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:46,311
Dale broke up Mom and Dad
Dale broke up Mom and Dad

1170
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,355
-Dale broke up Mom and--
-Brennan!

1171
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:57,322
Get up, Brennan,
I know you're faking. Get up!

1172
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,283
Get up!

1173
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:06,582
Brennan?

1174
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:10,085
It's just like Cold Case Files.
It's just like Cold Case Files.

1175
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,129
It's just like Cold Case Files.

1176
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,798
People die every day.

1177
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:19,303
Give him a proper burial
in an unmarked grave....

1178
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:25,934
-Brennan! You're alive! Oh, my God.
-I know.

1179
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,436
I’m alive.

1180
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:33,692
-You were dead. I saw you die!
-I was faking.

1181
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,320
I used ninja focus
to slow my heart rate down.

1182
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,573
-What are you doing?
-I’m burying you.

1183
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:43,201
-I’m alive. Brennan, I’m alive.
-You're waking the neighbors!

1184
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,662
-Shut up!
-No. No.

1185
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,750
-Now I’m gonna play your drum set.
-Help me.

1186
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,711
Close your eyes.
Let the dirt just shower over you.

1187
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,964
This is your fault.

1188
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:01,053
Oh, I’m exhausted.
I’m gonna sleep good tonight.

1189
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,350
-Don't you touch my drums!
-Zombie!

1190
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,686
Zombie! Zombie!

1191
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,522
Get off me, zombie.

1192
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,692
Get off.

1193
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,373
I’m late for school.

1194
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:33,085
I will kiss you right on the mouth,
Kenny Rogers.

1195
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,630
-Just get off me.
-Hey.

1196
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:41,718
So I guess it's really over.

1197
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,763
I'd say you trying to bury me alive
pretty much did it.

1198
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,182
You know what I just realized?

1199
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,518
You've been the one
dragging me down.

1200
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,771
Now I’m gonna go out and I’m gonna
get a job and an apartment...

1201
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:55,899
...and then I’m gonna get Mom
and Dr. Doback back together.

1202
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,819
I’m gonna be the hero,
and you can suck on it.

1203
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:04,950
My life was perfect
before you came here.

1204
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:09,162
Me and my dad had a perfect setup,
and you wrecked it.

1205
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,042
Hey.

1206
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:17,129
We're no longer brothers.

1207
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:21,299
We never were.
We were stepbrothers.

1208
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,773
-That was one of your best.
-These balls fucking suck.

1209
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:39,067
All right.

1210
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,737
Well, well, well,
look who's here, boys.

1211
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,865
Can you give me a job, please?

1212
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:49,244
TJ, get an office pool going.

1213
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,372
Give Ken-Doll Crotch here
two weeks, tops.

1214
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,333
Dr. Angel Face,
I just wanted to say thank you...

1215
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:59,212
...for meeting me
on such short notice.

1216
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,715
-Don't call me Angel Face.
-I apologize.

1217
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:06,553
I’m very alone right now, and the thing
I wanna ask you to help me--

1218
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,806
To show me how I can be
a grownup.

1219
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,017
Do I carry my
high-school diploma around?

1220
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,602
What do you do with your hair?

1221
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,896
What happens if there's
inclement weather?

1222
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:17,731
Where do you--?
What do you wear?

1223
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,691
Can you wash clothes
in the dishwasher?

1224
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,819
I notice that there's a long gap
in your job history...

1225
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,782
...and it said for 22 years...

1226
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,076
...you went Kerouac
on everyone's ass?

1227
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,496
I’m gonna be honest with you.
I really need a job.

1228
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,832
And I will take any position,
as long as it doesn't involve...

1229
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,045
...having sex with old ladies
for money or bear traps.

1230
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:42,798
-Those are my two bugaboos.
-All right, got it.

1231
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,717
There's a catering business,
there's a temp job open.

1232
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,345
And you get to play with fire.

1233
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,003
What do you want?
This is my online-poker time.

1234
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,463
I’m ready to take on
the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1235
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,549
Slow down there, Speed Racer.

1236
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,051
I know what it entails,
and I’m ready to nail it.

1237
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,762
I want it, okay?
I want the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1238
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,723
-Yo, yo.
-Hey, D-man.

1239
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,558
-You tell him what's up?
-I sure did.

1240
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,268
-Hey.
-Hey.

1241
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,896
Your brother wants a shot
at the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1242
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,230
I’m ready, walking tall.

1243
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,107
You're ready to run with the bulls?

1244
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:28,194
I've been earning and burning,
snapping necks and cashing checks.

1245
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,281
Screw it, let's let him do it.
It's a win-win for me...

1246
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,700
-...because if you fuck up, Brennan...
-Yeah?

1247
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:38,038
...I get to fire your ass. But if you pull
it off, I look like a genius to the board.

1248
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:40,373
-Okay?
-I get it.

1249
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:41,833
Brennan, here's the thing.

1250
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,836
It's the Catalina fucking
Wine Mixer, okay?

1251
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,172
Are you saying "pow"?
What are you saying?

1252
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:51,092
It's the biggest helicopter-leasing
event in the Western Hemisphere...

1253
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,303
...since 1997.

1254
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,431
-Why does he keep doing that?
-I have to sell or lease...

1255
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,725
...at least 80 choppers
to make my nut.

1256
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:03,563
And you mess with my nut, Brennan,
Randy here is gonna eat your dick.

1257
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:06,232
Like Kobayashi.

1258
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,110
I've seen him do it.

1259
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,737
You've seen him eat a penis?

1260
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:13,782
It was in international waters,
so they couldn't prosecute him.

1261
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,451
I tell you now, I’ll nail it.
I’ll pull it off, okay?

1262
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,620
Wait a second,
why do you want this so bad?

1263
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,289
Trying to get Mom and Dad
back together or something?

1264
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,666
-Why do I want this?
-Yeah.

1265
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:27,712
Because I wanna make bank, bro.
I wanna get ass.

1266
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,631
And I wanna drive a Range Rover.

1267
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,299
Okay, well, you better, Brennan.

1268
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,551
This is the fucking
Catalina Wine Mixer.

1269
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,947
Nancy. Hi.

1270
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:57,617
Hi. What are you doing here?

1271
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:59,703
Well, Dale's working the function.

1272
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,747
Guys, this is supposed to be jicama,
not bok choy.

1273
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:03,957
Sorry, folks.

1274
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,711
And I got an invitation from Brennan.

1275
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:11,006
Can you believe
Brennan put all this together?

1276
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:16,344
And now here we all are in Catalina.

1277
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,181
-It's funny, huh?
-Yeah, it's funny.

1278
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,684
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Hey.

1279
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,979
Not bad. You're nailing it.

1280
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,356
-Thanks, Randy. That means a lot.
-Yeah.

1281
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,733
I don't know what it is...

1282
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,736
...but I wanna deliver one of these
right in your suck hole.

1283
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:36,031
-Is there anything I can do?
-No. Not really. It's your face.

1284
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,742
Again, you're doing great, man.
The Catalina Wine Mixer.

1285
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,827
We're all having a great time,
having fun.

1286
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:43,538
You pulled it off.
But if you don't change your face...

1287
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,832
-...I’m gonna change it for you.
-Okay. Okay.

1288
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,126
All I can do is take that in,
consider it...

1289
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:51,546
...and I’ll just do my best version
of whatever I think that would be.

1290
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:54,507
I don't even hear you,
your face is driving me nuts.

1291
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:56,718
-Thanks again, though.
-Oh, tits. Hold on.

1292
01:15:57,178 --> 01:16:00,555
Hey. Hello, Catalina Wine Mixer.

1293
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,224
How are you? We are Uptown Girl.

1294
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:07,228
We are California's pre-eminent
1980s Billy Joel cover band.

1295
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,147
"Piano Man"!

1296
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,232
What did I just say, man?

1297
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,193
All right, we don't play that...

1298
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,904
...so let's keep it in the '80s
and let's keep it fun.

1299
01:16:16,072 --> 01:16:17,197
You having a good time?

1300
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:19,741
I hope you are,
because sometimes life can be tough.

1301
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:24,954
And I know that sometimes
it's hard to "Keeping the Faith."

1302
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,300
You guys seem to be hitting it off.

1303
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:38,760
Oh, honey.

1304
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,845
Oh, my God,
this is the greatest party.

1305
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,222
-Hello, Robert.
-Way to go.

1306
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:44,933
-Brennan, this is fantastic.
-Way to go.

1307
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,851
So impressed.

1308
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,062
-Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy.
-Hi, Dale.

1309
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,939
-Hey, Brennan.
-It's good to see you.

1310
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,274
Thanks for hiring
our catering company.

1311
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:56,319
Easy decision. You guys have
a outstanding track record.

1312
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:59,656
-Just like old times, huh?
-Right, it really is.

1313
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,699
You still have your
night-vision goggles?

1314
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:05,787
No, no. No, I had to sell those
to pay for car insurance.

1315
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,289
How about you?
You still breaking boards...

1316
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,458
...or kicking holes in pumpkins
or anything?

1317
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,210
No.

1318
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,131
But I did start taking baby aspirin
to reduce my risk for heart attack.

1319
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,134
That makes sense.
Gotta keep an eye on it, you know.

1320
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:22,303
-Knock off the sweets.
-Thank you.

1321
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:29,644
It's a truly funny observation.

1322
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,020
Yeah.

1323
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,690
Dale, the empanadas
are starting to sweat.

1324
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:36,025
Okay. I better run.

1325
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,069
-It's good to see you, Brennan.
-You too.

1326
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,364
-Take care, be well. Take care, Dad.
-Okay, buddy.

1327
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:43,950
-It's great to talk to him.
-Yeah.

1328
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,827
I gotta go too.

1329
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:49,164
We should do this again.
I think it was very constructive.

1330
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,712
-Maybe grab a bite to eat?
-Sure.

1331
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,672
-Go to Outback Steakhouse.
-Okay.

1332
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,507
I've grown very fond of that place.

1333
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,844
Thank you for coming.

1334
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,762
Great to see you.

1335
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,683
It was very nice to see you, Robert.

1336
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:14,647
I think Brennan organized this
whole thing to get us back together.

1337
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:21,237
You have to excuse me.
I think that I just might cry.

1338
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:24,991
It's the funniest thing. Bye-bye.

1339
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,372
"Start the Fire," buddy!

1340
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:35,126
Come on, man. Play something
from The Stranger!

1341
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:38,129
We strictly do '80s Joel music, sir.

1342
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,384
'80s Billy Joel doo-wop sucks!

1343
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,095
Hey, listen, motherfucker,
we only sing '80s Joel!

1344
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:49,057
So take your skank hooker wife
and get the fuck out of here!

1345
01:18:51,018 --> 01:18:52,060
Shit.

1346
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,270
-What's wrong?
-All right. "What's wrong?"

1347
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,648
Get him out of here.
Get his ass out of here!

1348
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,107
Hey.

1349
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:01,903
Hey, great job, fuck face. You just
busted my nut. This party's shot.

1350
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,614
Just relax. I didn't realize
he would say these things.

1351
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,574
You know what?
You cost me money.

1352
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,244
So this isn't even
a judgment call, man.

1353
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,288
-You're Audi 5000, my friend.
-Derek, can't we talk about this?

1354
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:13,623
No.

1355
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,583
-Hey.
-Shit.

1356
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,586
-Is everything okay?
-No. He just fired me.

1357
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:20,004
What happened to the music?

1358
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,924
The band left. The guy freaked out.

1359
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,259
Derek fired me.

1360
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,719
-It's no big deal.
-Robert, you don't get it.

1361
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,429
It's the Catalina Wine Mixer!

1362
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,848
People have killed
to be in the position I’m in.

1363
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,268
-He's right. It's a big deal.
-Here's a thought:

1364
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,020
I see an empty stage.

1365
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,940
I see drums, I see a drummer.

1366
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,484
I see a microphone,
and I see a singer.

1367
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:43,111
-Dad, come on.
-What?

1368
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,196
-We gave that stuff up.
-We don't do that.

1369
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:47,824
Listen to me.
Dale, look, when I was a kid...

1370
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:51,119
...when I was a little boy,
I always wanted to be a dinosaur.

1371
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:54,038
I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex
more than anything.

1372
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,166
I made my arms short
and I roamed the backyard...

1373
01:19:57,334 --> 01:20:00,962
...and I chased the neighborhood cats,
and I growled and I roared.

1374
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,964
Everybody knew me
and was afraid of me.

1375
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,632
And then one day, my dad said:

1376
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,678
"Bobby, you're 17. It's time
to throw childish things aside."

1377
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:09,929
And I said, "Okay, Pop."

1378
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:14,058
But he didn't really say that, he said,
"Stop being a dinosaur and get a job."

1379
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,603
But, you know, I thought to myself,
"I’ll go to medical school...

1380
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,982
...I’ll practice for a little while,
and then I’ll come back to it."

1381
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:23,067
-Dad--
-How is that a skill?

1382
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:24,819
But I forgot how to do it.

1383
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,195
You're human.

1384
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:28,573
-You could never be a dinosaur.
-Yeah.

1385
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,327
Hey, I lost it.

1386
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:34,495
-Dad, what's the point?
-Yeah.

1387
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:37,457
The point is
don't lose your dinosaur.

1388
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,752
Yeah. You know, I hated
the way you guys were before.

1389
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:42,170
I mean, I hated you.

1390
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:47,091
But it just kills me to see you
so crushed and normal.

1391
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,093
Listen to me, don't listen to me...

1392
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,513
...Prestige Worldwide,
that's what you gotta do.

1393
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,099
-You're saying we should go for it.
-That's what I’m saying.

1394
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,353
What do you think, Brennan?

1395
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,980
I’m so scared right now.
I’m gonna do what's sensible:

1396
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,732
I’m gonna file for unemployment...

1397
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,693
...and I’m gonna try to get a job
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

1398
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,696
Because they got
a excellent corporate structure...

1399
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,866
...and they give you the tools
to be your own boss.

1400
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,910
My dad's right.

1401
01:21:14,078 --> 01:21:15,620
This isn't me.

1402
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:18,956
I’m fucking miserable.
I had to get up at 10:00 this morning.

1403
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:22,960
And even though
I just got a tidal wave of nerves...

1404
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,837
...I’m going up on that stage...

1405
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,548
...and I’m gonna make beautiful music
for a sad world.

1406
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,051
-Dale....
-That's the boy I know.

1407
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,303
This crowd's gonna eat him alive.

1408
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:36,057
Wait, what's he doing up there?

1409
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:38,601
Somebody get him
off the fucking stage!

1410
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,895
Hi. How you doing?

1411
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:44,399
My name's Dale Doback,
and I hope you like to kick it.

1412
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:46,317
Oh, go get them, Dale!

1413
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:48,820
Boats and ho's

1414
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,863
Get off the stage, you dick!

1415
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,782
Stop yelling at him.

1416
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:56,536
-Terrible!
-Terrible.

1417
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,079
He's a human being.

1418
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:02,583
Dale has a mangina
Dale has a mangina

1419
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:03,876
No.

1420
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,170
Gotta have me my boats and ho's

1421
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:08,714
He's up there alone, Brennan.
He's up there alone.

1422
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,261
Gotta have me my boats and ho's

1423
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:15,263
-You suck!
-What are you doing, Brennan?

1424
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:16,514
Gotta have me my...

1425
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:18,933
Brennan, no!

1426
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,602
-What did you do?
-Oh, Jesus, Nancy.

1427
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,188
I couldn't stand to see him like that.
I miss my son.

1428
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,860
All right. Let me go for a few bars.
Come in soft, but then finish strong.

1429
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,987
-Okay. Hey, Brennan?
-Yeah.

1430
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:34,240
-Thanks for coming up.
-You got it, Dragon.

1431
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,242
We got a little change coming up.

1432
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,786
It's my main man Brennan.

1433
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:56,531
Boats and ho's

1434
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:47,164
-You did it, Derek.
-I made a kite fly.

1435
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:50,835
Brennan, you're the best
big brother ever!

1436
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:03,180
--floor mats. The ones that match
the seats, and I kind of wanted--

1437
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,808
I traveled 500 miles
to give you my seed.

1438
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,185
Lumberjack!

1439
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,811
Rock the fuck
out of those drums, Dale!

1440
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,271
I’m sorry.

1441
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:36,357
-We're Prestige Worldwide!
-Prestige Worldwide!

1442
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:40,528
-Fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
-It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1443
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,572
It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1444
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,282
Brennan, that was sublime.

1445
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,743
Amazing.
We are so proud of you both.

1446
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:49,453
-Thank you.
-Incredible.

1447
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:50,788
-Thank you so much.
-Hey.

1448
01:26:50,956 --> 01:26:54,875
So I made my quota.
Yeah, we sold a shit-ton of copters.

1449
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:57,128
-That's so good.
-Yeah.

1450
01:26:57,295 --> 01:27:00,756
Look, I’m not great at
this Hallmark stuff...

1451
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,259
...but, Brennan,
when I look at you now...

1452
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:05,845
...I don't wanna kick you
in the head quite as much.

1453
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:08,639
Thanks, man.

1454
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:10,349
-That was beautiful.
-That was nice.

1455
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:11,892
Yeah.

1456
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15,062
-What do we do now?
-We could hug.

1457
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,314
Yeah, you'd like that, faggot.
Sorry. I’m--

1458
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,652
Okay.

1459
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:36,250
-It's okay.
-Okay.

1460
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:53,100
-That's what we've been looking for.
-That's the ticket.

1461
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:54,769
It's fantastic.

1462
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,439
We've never done anything like that,
so you can't expect it to be perfect.

1463
01:27:58,607 --> 01:27:59,607
It was good.

1464
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,525
-Felt good.
-Gotten close to a hug.

1465
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:05,905
-Hello, Brennan. Hi.
-Denise. Hey.

1466
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:08,824
Robert, Mom, Derek,
this is my girlfriend, Denise.

1467
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:12,119
-Hi. How are you?
-Actually, I’m his therapist.

1468
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:15,289
-We are in absolutely no way dating.
-Right.

1469
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:19,293
Brennan told me he was going to
hurl his body off a helicopter...

1470
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:21,629
...into shark-infested waters...

1471
01:28:21,797 --> 01:28:24,215
...so I had a legal obligation
to be here.

1472
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:25,549
I get it.

1473
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:29,678
Don't wanna appear too eager,
and that is a good strategy too.

1474
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:31,972
You are an enabler.
You think you're helping...

1475
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,891
-...but you're not.
-And you are a keeper.

1476
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,851
What'd you think?

1477
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:41,148
Brennan, I thought
you were incredibly brave.

1478
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:42,358
And I mean that...

1479
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:45,820
...in strictly the most clinical
and professional sense possible...

1480
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:49,448
...with no emotional,
intimate, sexual...

1481
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:52,243
...or any other undertones
that you could possibly infer.

1482
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,162
God, you're gonna make me cry.

1483
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:59,333
What poem is that from?
Is that James Joyce?

1484
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,168
Alice...

1485
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:04,171
-...I like making sex with you.
-Yeah.

1486
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:08,092
I do. But you're also married.

1487
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,177
It's over.

1488
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,555
This is crazy. I’m a mother.

1489
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:15,432
I have two children,
I have a husband, a beautiful home.

1490
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,727
-I can't be fucking around with you.
-It was fun. It was fun, right?

1491
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,189
-It was fun while it lasted.
-I’m glad. All right, well, good luck.

1492
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:28,237
-No.
-Oh, my God, Dale!

1493
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:31,407
-Please don't leave me.
-Oh, my God. Look at that whale.

1494
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,117
Where?

1495
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,663
Dale!

1496
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:44,837
So I was with Seal...

1497
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:48,465
...and we were just taking a chopper
up to Everest base camp...

1498
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,801
-...and the plot to my Sherpa--
-Derek. Derek.

1499
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:53,804
-Sorry. Okay.
-Remember, we talked about this.

1500
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:56,891
Dale, Brennan.
Tell me about the karaoke business.

1501
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,060
Really great, Dad.
Yeah. We call it Karaoke 'n' Roll.

1502
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,814
We got six bars, three restaurants,
and two more wanna sign up.

1503
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:05,983
-So it's booming.
-Fantastic.

1504
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,902
Most karaoke it's,
"Open to everyone.

1505
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,279
-Hey, just get up and have fun."
-Not you guys.

1506
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:12,781
If you can't sing, just sit down.
That's our motto.

1507
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:15,576
-It's the big leagues.
-You guys are doing so great.

1508
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:19,788
Guys, I have a little Christmas
surprise for Dale and Brennan.

1509
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:22,333
-You wanna see it?
-Yes!

1510
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,919
-You bet!
-Let's go look at it! Come on.

1511
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:26,670
-Don't peek.
-I smell cookies.

1512
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:28,714
Be patient. No, no. No, no.

1513
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:32,927
-Just a pinata, isn't it?
-Be patient. Be patient.

1514
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,970
-Be patient.
-Did you get me a tiger, Dad?

1515
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:36,221
Okay, open your eyes.

1516
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:37,640
Merry Christmas.

1517
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,475
Holy shit!

1518
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:43,145
Dad, I can't believe
you put the boat in the tree!

1519
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:44,438
This is amazing!

1520
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:48,943
-It's The Gilded Lady. She lives!
-I can't believe it.

1521
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:53,238
-How'd you get it up here?
-Oh, Robert, it's so great.

1522
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,616
-Pirate hats!
-Pirate hats!

1523
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,704
-Hustlers!
-Hustlers!

1524
01:31:00,956 --> 01:31:03,082
Dad, that was so thoughtful!

1525
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,920
-Crossbows!
-Crossbows!

1526
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:11,006
You guys finally came to your senses
and got us something cool.

1527
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:13,634
You both know this is
completely fucked up, right?

1528
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,302
-Yeah.
-Of course.

1529
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:19,431
But Brennan sure can wear the shit
out of that pirate hat.

1530
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:22,476
-Chewbacca masks!
-Chewbacca masks!

1531
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:29,191
It's okay that mine's
not movie-quality.

1532
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,679
But he's like, "No, because you drove
my car last week, so I can't get it."

1533
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:02,850
So I’m like "You're gonna buy it for me
or I’m gonna sock you in the mouth."

1534
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:13,318
Oh, shit.

1535
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:22,786
Well, if it isn't Dale Doback
and his little butt buddy.

1536
01:32:22,954 --> 01:32:24,997
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...

1537
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:28,667
...but I’m gonna kick you repeatedly
in the balls, Gardocki!

1538
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,211
Let's get them!

1539
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,970
The cops'll be here soon.

1540
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,390
I guess this is what it feels like
to be grown up.

1541
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:27,059
Hey.

1542
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,311
Can I ask you something?

1543
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:30,938
Yeah, of course.

1544
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:32,856
You know back when
you first moved in?

1545
01:33:33,024 --> 01:33:34,066
Yeah.

1546
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,819
-Did you touch my drum set?
-No, I didn't.

1547
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:39,113
No, really, I won't get mad.
I just wanna know.

1548
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,198
No, I know.
You said you wouldn't get mad.

1549
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:44,076
I’m saying I didn't do it.
I didn't do it, I never did it.

1550
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:46,078
-Then I owe you an apology.
-No.

1551
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,871
No, you don't, at all. No.

1552
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,499
Why wouldn't you take an apology
if you didn't do it?

1553
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:53,502
Just because I’m cool.
It doesn't matter.

1554
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:35,640
You got my passport.

1555
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,809
I’m good.

1556
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:44,566
Don't worry, not gonna be late.
Don't worry.

1557
