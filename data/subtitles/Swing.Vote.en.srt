00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,920
SWING VOTE

2
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,689
After a hotly contested race, Americans go to the polls today...

3
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:10,549
in what promises to be a very close election.

4
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,489
The Republican Andrew Boone, hoping to hold on to the Oval Office...

5
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:16,829
by edging out...

6
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,129
the Democratic challenger Donald Greenleaf.

7
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,750
Bud... Bud.

8
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,810
Bud!

9
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,719
I'll call... I'll call him back.

10
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,900
If we had a phone, you could. Come on!

11
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,200
Goddamnit! It's cold.

12
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,170
We're gonna be late again. You need a shower.

13
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,170
Can't believe you slept in your clothes!

14
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,139
Leave me any hot water?

15
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,680
I don't know. Water heater fix itself?

16
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,060
Christ, Molly! Why don't you just take the day off, okay?

17
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,729
I'll write you a note.

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,770
Now! I'm not going to tell you again!

19
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:35,740
Get up!

20
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:46,139
Bud!

21
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,680
Alright, I'm coming!

22
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,310
- What?
- Egg salad.

23
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,050
Again?

24
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,229
You like egg salad.

25
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:34,819
Well, not every damn day I don't. You could mix it up a little.

26
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,120
We're on a budget.

27
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,000
You wanna eat better? Drink less beer.

28
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,370
- Fine.
- Fine.

29
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,680
- And don't forget today.
- What's... what's today?

30
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,579
Election day, dummy!

31
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm supposed to do a report on you voting, remember?

32
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,719
I already told you before I'm not even registered.

33
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,189
I registered for you in the mail.

34
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:02,159
That's great, I could get jury duty now.

35
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,590
- It's your civic responsibility.
- It's my civic, my what?

36
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,469
It's your civic responsibility.

37
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:10,129
My civic responsibility? Where you learning this crap?

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,699
Mrs. Abernathy.

39
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,069
Well, stay away from her.

40
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,839
She's my teacher.

41
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:44,699
Sign this.

42
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,360
What is it?

43
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,139
A questionnaire. I'm supposed to ask you about your politics.

44
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,240
Well, go ahead.

45
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,399
I already filled it in.

46
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,149
I wanted you to sound smart.

47
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:03,519
Give me the first question anyway.

48
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,920
What's your political affiliation?

49
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,149
Alright, I'm a conscious objector.

50
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:19,970
It's not a war, Bud. It's an election. And you are an independent.

51
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,500
Independent? Why in the hell would I be an independent?

52
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,480
Because the two party system...

53
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,500
has neglected the needs of the working poor.

54
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,399
- Let me tell you something, baby...
- Here we go again.

55
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,980
The voting doesn't count for a goddamn thing.

56
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,980
Just a way to make you feel like you're in control of something.

57
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,629
It doesn't matter who you vote for, we can't afford insurance and...

58
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:47,689
if you get sick, I'm gonna have to start selling my blood again.

59
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:51,670
Mrs. Abernathy said every vote counts. It's a social contract.

60
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,300
It's a social contract. This Mrs. Abernathy is full of shit.

61
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:18,029
Meet me at the polling place after work.

62
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,389
Fine.

63
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,800
You forgetting something?

64
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,810
Bud, screw this up and I'm leaving you.

65
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,480
Do good!

66
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,170
Where...

67
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,709
Where the hell is Dewey?

68
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:15,980
He got laid off.

69
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,540
Bullshit! He got insourced.

70
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,459
Insourced?

71
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,459
Insourced. Instead of exporting our jobs to Mexico...

72
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,220
they're importing Mexicans to take our jobs.

73
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,290
You're paranoid, you know that?

74
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,259
Attention! The opening this morning is officially cancelled.

75
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,139
I can't even read the damn signs no more!

76
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:44,040
Our days are numbered, fellas. You mark my words!

77
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,709
These hombres work twice as hard for half the money.

78
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,110
I just figure they need this job twice as bad as us!

79
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:53,180
Whose side are you on?

80
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,420
I don't take sides, Lowell. Just stating the obvious.

81
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,800
Next thing, they'll be taking away our right to vote.

82
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:03,730
You voting, Bud?

83
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,459
It's a social contract, isn't it?

84
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,199
Who are you voting for?

85
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,540
Shit if I know!

86
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,279
I think I picked up a couple shades. Looks like an eight.

87
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,540
What do you think, Marty?

88
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,790
I don't like the margin in Florida.

89
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:29,620
Bus some young Republicans down to the polling stations in Palm Beach.

90
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,259
Make sure they're tall, they're blonde and they're men.

91
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,500
Because old Jews see a pack of angry young white males...

92
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,330
and they're gonna think twice about getting out of their car!

93
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,570
Kennedy was a nine. And he put a man on the moon.

94
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:53,519
That's what we need. Something to shoot for.

95
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,820
A defining moment. Like... I don't know.

96
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,120
Cure for cancer.

97
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,929
Ohio run the gay marriage ad every twenty minutes.

98
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:10,330
Let's see if we can't get those God fearing bastards off the fence.

99
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,889
We take a bunch of scientists, put them in the desert somewhere.

100
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:16,509
Like the Manhattan project. Are you listening to me? I'm serious about this.

101
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:19,309
I think that cancer is going to be a tough nut to crack in one term, sir.

102
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,679
So, we make it a ten year plan.

103
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,279
- Lincoln got to see the end of slavery?
- No.

104
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,740
- Did Kennedy get to see the moon shot?
- Nope.

105
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,009
No! But they got the credit! It's the idea that counts.

106
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:33,210
The guy that sets the goal gets in the history books!

107
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,590
Hope and positivity! Marty, the American people want a bright...

108
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,049
shining smile to represent the promise of this country.

109
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:43,000
Take old Georgie there.

110
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,529
Boy, he was off the charts.

111
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,200
They wanted to make him King.

112
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,639
Son of a gun!

113
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,059
Thank you, thank you for coming.

114
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:15,929
Galena and I would like to thank America...

115
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,529
for this glorious opportunity.

116
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:22,629
I have met people of every race, color and creed...

117
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,500
during this long campaign.

118
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,669
I pledge to you that my White House will be a rainbow house.

119
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,870
It'll be open to people of all colors and creeds.

120
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:35,750
Now, please, go and vote. We need your support.

121
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:43,950
That was great. I'm gonna go do press.

122
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,580
Great.

123
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,330
Greenleaf! Greenleaf!

124
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:56,100
Gallup has you down by a point.

125
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,269
CNN, USA Today, has us up by two. News has us down by sixty.

126
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,639
What message are you trying to get out to the undecideds today?

127
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,049
The same message we put out yesterday, last week and last year...

128
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:08,610
when we started this campaign and that's why we're going to win.

129
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,409
Because we have the answers. Not platitudes and jingoistic rhetoric.

130
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,149
This is the truth train operation real deal.

131
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,830
In recent days, the president has aired ads claiming Greenleaf...

132
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,730
has vacationed at a nudist colony.

133
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,429
Come on, now, that's a tired accusation. It's pure fiction.

134
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,200
- Then, how do you answer for the photos?
- Right wing blogo-smear, that's how.

135
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,139
I could stand here and perpetuate the rumor that as a young man...

136
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,740
the president had a gambling addiction, but I'm got going to sink to their level.

137
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,179
Despite eye witness accounts and documentation.

138
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:39,840
They sling mud, we sling ideas.

139
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,820
Still, if Greenleaf loses, you'll be 0 for 7 on the national scene.

140
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,889
Thank you, Betty. Sorry, folks, that's all I have time for.

141
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,490
Leeches!

142
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,519
Why it's important to vote.

143
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,360
Many brave soldiers sacrificed themselves.

144
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:59,299
A right we take for granted.

145
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:01,889
- For the people.
- By the people.

146
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,070
We the people!

147
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,600
I can't read my writing.

148
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,470
All the world's great civilizations have followed the same path.

149
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,440
From bondage, to liberty, from liberty to abundance...

150
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:18,750
from abundance to complacency. From complacency to apathy...

151
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,149
from apathy back to bondage.

152
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,129
If we're to be the exception to history, then we must break the cycle.

153
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,360
For those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

154
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,529
Very good, everybody. Very good.

155
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,200
Hold this.

156
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,039
Okay, remember, no running till you get out to the playground.

157
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,220
Your last one was great. I'd like to use it on the news.

158
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,080
- Molly?
- Yes.

159
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,480
Molly, come here.

160
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,759
This is Ms. Madison. She's the reporter from the news.

161
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,159
- Hi, Molly.
- Hi.

162
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,389
- How you doing?
- Good.

163
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,889
Your essay was very thoughtful.

164
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:57,990
Thanks.

165
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,899
Ms. Madison is going to show your essay tonight.

166
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,889
- Isn't that exciting?
- Yes, madam.

167
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,399
Tell me something. What do you want to be when you grow up?

168
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,870
I go back and forth. Either a veterinarian or chairman of the Fed.

169
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,379
Where's Bud?

170
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,279
Went to take a leak half an hour ago. I heard his name over the loudspeaker.

171
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,779
What'd you have for lunch?

172
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:30,250
- Egg salad. You?
- Hard boiled.

173
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,490
Hey, Bud.

174
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,889
Just giving you a heads up.

175
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,970
Management wants us to cut another ten percent.

176
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,669
Well, you are management, Carl.

177
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:54,309
Look, you haven't punched in on time in six months.

178
00:13:54,549 --> 00:14:00,289
So, I'm five minutes late every once in a while. What is the big whoop?

179
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,049
You took thirty-one sick days this year, Bud.

180
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,919
Well, I gotta kid, Carl. She brings it home from school.

181
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,580
Shit! Goddamnit!

182
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,639
Well, hell, Carl!

183
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,409
You could have showed me your footage when you walked in.

184
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,950
I know we went to school together, Bud. I've always liked you.

185
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,919
You gotta give me one good reason why I should keep you.

186
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,259
Why I can keep you.

187
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:44,490
All hellsabelle!

188
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,860
Sorry you lost your job.

189
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,940
That's alright, Henry. Just...

190
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,600
As soon as take your money, I'm going from fired to retired.

191
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,940
- Hey, Bud!
- Yes?

192
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,809
Molly is on TV!

193
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,519
- Apathy back to bondage.
- Geez!

194
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,590
If we are to be the exception to history, then we must break the cycle.

195
00:16:14,419 --> 00:16:16,649
- Curly, what time you got?
- Nine past seven.

196
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,090
God!

197
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,529
God, man! Shit!

198
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,620
Goddamnit!

199
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,650
PLEASE, INSERT YOUR BALLOT

200
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,309
ERROR CODE
- RESTART

201
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,470
I hurt the top of my head.

202
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,369
Come on, lay down.

203
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,890
I'm so sorry, baby.

204
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,569
I want to live with Mom.

205
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,079
Me too.

206
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:26,569
New Mexico is a classic swing state.

207
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:28,200
- Mrs. Madison?
- Speaking.

208
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm calling from the New Mexico election board.

209
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:34,039
- The what?
- The New Mexico election board.

210
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,880
Madam, did you cast your vote at a Texico polling station last night?

211
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,210
I voted in the morning.

212
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:42,250
In the morning. Alright.

213
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,150
Is there something the matter?

214
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,960
No, no, sorry to bother you.

215
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,619
It is amazing. With every state but New Mexico reporting...

216
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:51,390
we're now in a dead heat for the American presidency.

217
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,519
Each candidate with virtually the same amount of electoral votes.

218
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:58,539
270, the magic number to win. This is a real photo finish!

219
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:00,799
And it goes to whoever wins the popular vote in the state.

220
00:22:00,869 --> 00:22:03,599
All five electoral college votes then swing to that party.

221
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,910
Well, they don't call it the land of enchantment for nothing.

222
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,500
Whoever takes New Mexico, takes the White House.

223
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:13,809
It's dижjид vu again. 2000 presidential election came down to Dade County.

224
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,960
400 votes in the state of Florida, out of a total of 105 million cast.

225
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,720
If this is a certified tie, neither the candidate would receive the majority.

226
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,589
Do we even have a president to deal with this?

227
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,869
Pursuant to the 12th amendment, the House of Representatives would decide.

228
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:32,799
That hasn't happened since...

229
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,569
John Quincy Adams defeated Andrew Jackson back in 1824.

230
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,269
We're talking rare.

231
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,710
No, this isn't a great civics lesson to the people of this country?

232
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,920
If anyone in New Mexico didn't vote, he be kicking themselves right now.

233
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,549
The latest reports coming in, Curry County still too close to call.

234
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,609
This election is down to a single county. Is this even possible?

235
00:22:57,789 --> 00:23:01,559
Listen, John, there's only 653 registered voters in Texico.

236
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,259
And they've already recounted those votes.

237
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:07,029
I know. With that information and a dollar, I could buy a chalupa!

238
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,640
Everyone I know who voted has been personally called.

239
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,599
So what?

240
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,400
So, the election. The fact that it's down to Curry County...

241
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,680
it has something to do with Texico.

242
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,609
Oh my God. Call you back!

243
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,559
Bud!

244
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,130
Come on!

245
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,140
God, my head!

246
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:52,710
What? What time is it?

247
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,380
There's some people here to see you.

248
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,150
Some people?

249
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,150
They look official.

250
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,359
- Child services?
- That's what I'm thinking.

251
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:18,240
- Okay.
- Here we go.

252
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,839
Mr. Johnson, we would have called first, but you don't have a telephone.

253
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,309
No, no, no, we got a phone.

254
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,759
It's just not connected right now. But I'm on it, you know.

255
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:37,750
I'm not gonna say it's been easy since the wife left, but...

256
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,119
- we're getting on fine.
- Sure are.

257
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:45,630
And I'm gonna pay these off, I swear. Just as soon as I find a new job.

258
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,859
- A new job?
- Yes.

259
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:53,180
I used to be in this Willy Nelson tribute band. I was thinking about...

260
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,980
getting the guys back together again, soon as our bass player gets paroled.

261
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,079
And the drinking, I know it, I know it looks bad.

262
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:04,990
And licking that sucker is at the top of my list.

263
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,049
Please don't take away from me.

264
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:11,119
I'll do anything you say, I swear.

265
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,859
She's just my only good thing.

266
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:18,130
Mr. Johnson, we're not from Social Services.

267
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,460
No?

268
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:22,930
We're from the State Election Bureau.

269
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,940
Fuck! Thank you, Jesus!

270
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:33,279
I'm Secretary of State Brower. And this is Attorney General Wyatt.

271
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:36,150
Mr. Johnson, did you cast your vote last night?

272
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:38,509
Last night, did you vote?

273
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:45,220
That's right, it's my civic duty, isn't it?

274
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,589
Indeed it is.

275
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,400
Mr. Johnson, is this your signature?

276
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:56,269
I guess.

277
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:57,869
You guess it's your signature?

278
00:25:57,869 --> 00:26:02,440
No, no. That's right. That's my signature.

279
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:04,269
Did you retain your stub?

280
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,480
What stub?

281
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,180
The perforated stub on top of your ballot.

282
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:21,730
Where's that perforated stub that I gave you for your school project?

283
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:23,130
I've got it.

284
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:36,269
It's him.

285
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,940
Yeah, it's him. What do you mean, "him?" Me, him?

286
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,380
Sir, your vote didn't count.

287
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,660
Mr. Johnson, it's our duty to inform you...

288
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,519
that you are entitled to recast your ballot in a timely manner.

289
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,180
What if I don't want to?

290
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,289
Bud!

291
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,069
Alright then, how about if I, how about if I just whisper it to you then?

292
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:03,539
Right here we'd get it over with, right now and you can listen too!

293
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:05,940
No, sir, there are strict rules and legal procedures.

294
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:09,970
Legal shit. Shit, fellas, I can't afford a lawyer.

295
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:13,009
You're not in trouble. You don't need a lawyer.

296
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,710
However, I will have to administer an oath.

297
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,849
An oath?

298
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,680
An oath. Please, place your hand on the Bible.

299
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:23,289
Do you, Earnest Johnson...

300
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,750
swear to recast your ballot in the spirit of the law?

301
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,089
Yeah, yes, sure. Okay.

302
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,430
So noted.

303
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,099
A petition will be filed on your behalf and a date will be set for your revote.

304
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,900
Does this put me on some sort of fast track list?

305
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,539
You know, for like jury duty?

306
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,640
Considering the gravity of this situation, keep all of this a secret.

307
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:49,950
Have a good night.

308
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,000
Sorry.

309
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,930
You should be! I could get into all kinds of trouble because of you!

310
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:14,740
Gosh, Molly!

311
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,809
Why can't you learn just to let things be?

312
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,640
I told you this was important to me, but you never listen!

313
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:37,299
Another astonishing development: New Mexico Elections Bureau is reporting...

314
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:41,400
a single irregular ballot is holding up a final decision in the state.

315
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,170
As I said, a single ballot. That's one vote, folks!

316
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:48,640
This really couldn't get any stranger, MSNBC has learned that the voter...

317
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,170
has been identified and has agreed to recast the ballot.

318
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,670
One voter will decide the fate of the state's five electoral votes.

319
00:28:55,819 --> 00:29:00,720
On this bizarre day, no one will soon forget, one American citizen...

320
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,680
will effectively choose the next President of the United States.

321
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,759
Apparently the electronic voting machine malfunctioned.

322
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,569
The ballot was scanned, but the machine died before the vote was counted.

323
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:12,470
It's an anomaly.

324
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,869
No shit, Larry! What polling station was the machine in?

325
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,910
Texico, New Mexico, sir.

326
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,829
Is that a place?

327
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,730
Where the hell is Texico?

328
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:23,569
New Mexico, sir, Curry County.

329
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,910
New Mexico election law dictates if a voter's right is violated...

330
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,079
The voter shall be-entitled to recast the ballot. I know.

331
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:34,750
Alright, kids, we're going to war.

332
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:37,019
A map! Somebody get me a map!

333
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,359
There's one schmuck standing between us and the White House. Find out who it is.

334
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,099
We can't do that legally.

335
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:45,470
Just find him.

336
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:54,210
We were supposed to my cytoplasm out of Jell-O today.

337
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,680
What kinda kid would rather sit in a crummy classroom...

338
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,049
than be out here?

339
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,009
What kind of father goes fishing when he should be looking for a new job?

340
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:06,920
The kind who would just like...

341
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,859
to spend a little more time with his daughter.

342
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,720
That's who.

343
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,490
- Fine.
- Fine.

344
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,890
Anyway, I've been thinking.

345
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,670
How refreshing!

346
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,839
Jesus! You gotta quit being such a smart ass all the time?

347
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,880
And you've got to stop using Jesus as a cuss word all the time!

348
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,150
He's a billion people's Savior.

349
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,240
Alright, fine, okay? I get it.

350
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,750
- Fine.
- Fine.

351
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,329
I wish... your mom could be here...

352
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:50,890
to talk to you about everything that's going on. I really do.

353
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,130
She doesn't want to be.

354
00:30:56,109 --> 00:30:59,799
No, she... no, she can't.

355
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:03,000
She's just, she can't, baby.

356
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,220
Bud.

357
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,119
Next Tuesday, is bring your father to school day.

358
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,920
- So?
- I want you to come.

359
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:26,029
It's not gonna embarrass you that I don't have a job?

360
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,660
I don't care.

361
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:29,769
I want you to come anyway.

362
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,599
- Think you can remember?
- Of course.

363
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,069
How?

364
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:41,819
Well...

365
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:45,339
I'll write it on my forehead.

366
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,529
Can I go to school, now?

367
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,400
Yes. Just one more cast.

368
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,579
Why don't you go start the truck.

369
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,369
Try to get a two shot, alright? Okay, come on!

370
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:36,660
Earnest Johnson!

371
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:39,200
- Yes?
- Kate Madison.

372
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:41,099
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

373
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:46,250
Shit! You're the lady from the news.

374
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,609
I am, and I'd like to ask you a few questions.

375
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,049
You know, you're much prettier than you are on the TV.

376
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,390
Thanks. I would...

377
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:56,019
Don't get me wrong, you're pretty on the TV too.

378
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,559
Just, we got an old set that kinda "squirshes" you.

379
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,529
Squishes everybody.

380
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,099
I believe, Mr. Johnson. I believe...

381
00:33:03,099 --> 00:33:04,730
You can call me Bud.

382
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,640
Bud. I was hoping you could tell me why those men...

383
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,130
flew from Santa Fe, to see you in the middle of the night.

384
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,710
Well, actually, I kinda promised to keep that a secret.

385
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:26,309
You mean, you're going to recast your vote.

386
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,660
Well, shit, I guess that I guess it ain't that much of a secret then.

387
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,059
Now, listen, Bud, you need to watch your language.

388
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,359
- We're taping this for TV, okay?
- The language?

389
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:41,000
Goddamnit, yes of course!

390
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:46,539
The question now is, who you voted for and are you going to vote the same way?

391
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:50,640
Remind me again who's running?

392
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:54,569
What you're saying is, you're keeping an open mind?

393
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,450
Yeah, that's...

394
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,250
That's the kinda guy I am.

395
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,150
You gotta be kidding me!

396
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:03,849
This is OJ big. Bigger!

397
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,720
I gotta call network!

398
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:11,699
John, let me break the story.

399
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,429
I thought I was gonna die in this shithole.

400
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,159
You said that when the time was right, you'd give me a chance. That's the time!

401
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,400
We'll be back to a real market.

402
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:21,380
The city! With elevators and Chinese restaurants and crime and traffic.

403
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,280
I got the tape of Mrs. Zachary's prize winning sow.

404
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,210
Screw Mrs. Zachary. And screw the sow!

405
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:27,369
You promised me.

406
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,710
Get network on the phone. Don't screw it up.

407
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,510
- You won't regret it!
- Better not! Darlene!

408
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:49,960
So... is your dad coming to talk to our class?

409
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:56,699
I don't know. Doesn't really leave the house much since my mom left.

410
00:34:58,309 --> 00:34:59,369
Mine left too.

411
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,219
She's pursuing a singing career in Albuquerque.

412
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,250
I'm going to move there when she becomes a big star.

413
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,119
And she's gonna take me on tour and everything.

414
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,760
She'll probably do a concert in Austin.

415
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,820
I could get you free tickets.

416
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
Maybe. Guess I could borrow my dad's car.

417
00:35:20,139 --> 00:35:23,760
I'll wait till he gets drunk. Sometimes he passes out.

418
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:30,969
Do you think I could try your skateboard?

419
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,210
Okay.

420
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,730
I'm the king of Curry County, John, and I've been 15 years at this desk.

421
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,989
I feel for you, Ted. Don't make me call security.

422
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,070
Holy crap!

423
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,340
You, desk! Sit!

424
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,980
People, we go live in 30 seconds!

425
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,019
From this point on, the news counts!

426
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:13,449
So excited, I got my accent back. My god!

427
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,489
And cue graphics!

428
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,320
And cue music!

429
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,690
And cue!

430
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,500
Good evening. This is Madison, coming to you from Curry County, New Mexico.

431
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,110
Over the last 24 hours, the American political process...

432
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,969
has ground to a virtual standstill as the world watches...

433
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,050
waiting for the outcome of an election. Today, I uncovered the identity...

434
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,949
of the person the entire world has been looking for.

435
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,590
The one swing voter who will decide the election.

436
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,349
Those of you hoping to hear that decision will be sorely disappointed.

437
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,789
Because you are about to meet a registered independent...

438
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:56,730
who claims to be keeping an open mind.

439
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,199
Imagine, on this man's shoulders...

440
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,340
stands the future of the free world.

441
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,139
Just the kind of guy I am.

442
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,340
Let it never again be said, that a single vote counts for nothing.

443
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,880
Bud!

444
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,210
Bud!

445
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,989
What?

446
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,519
There's some people outside.

447
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,090
Geez, you gotta stop waking me up like this, okay?

448
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,829
You're gonna kill me.

449
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,199
There are some people outside!

450
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,400
People?

451
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:40,440
God!

452
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,110
No, not there! Out front!

453
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:49,409
Oh, God... What now?

454
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:53,820
- Dad, hurry up!
- Yeah, I'm going, honey.

455
00:37:56,829 --> 00:37:58,320
There's a lot of people out there.

456
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:02,190
Okay, honey, let's see what the fuss is all about.

457
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,559
Is that him?

458
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,369
Bud!

459
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,929
Mr. Johnson, any decisions yet?

460
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:27,409
- Holy shit!
- What do they want?

461
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,059
I don't know.

462
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,260
Go turn the TV on, baby.

463
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,369
We are in the midst of a historic moment.

464
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,980
The swing voter has finally been identified.

465
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,380
We go live now to a trailer in Texico, New Mexico.

466
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,510
Earnest Johnson made an appearance just moments ago.

467
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,380
Apparently, overwhelmed by the media presence.

468
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:03,579
And Mr. Landry, exactly how long have you known Earnest Johnson?

469
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:07,130
Earnest Johnson? Hey, Earnest!

470
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,599
- You mean Bud?
- We all grew up together.

471
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,099
How do you think he's shouldering the responsibility...

472
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,570
of picking the next President of the United States?

473
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,610
Well, I'm sure that...

474
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,239
Earnest is... crapping his pants.

475
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,889
He's a good guy. He likes to treat them good.

476
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:33,909
We used to light the mesa back here on fire!

477
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:41,960
It's all my fault, isn't it?

478
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,260
No! No, no, no, baby, no.

479
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:48,739
None of this would have happened if I hadn't let you down.

480
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,170
What are we gonna do?

481
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,730
Well...

482
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,409
I'm gonna back these people up.

483
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,909
Holy shit!

484
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,550
There's so many!

485
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,550
Ok, I'm just gonna go out there, right? I'm gonna...

486
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,559
I'm gonna walk out there and tell those people it wasn't me who voted.

487
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,429
No, you can't!

488
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,769
Why not?

489
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:25,329
You swore to that judge, on a Bible and everything.

490
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:27,639
What? That was the middle of the night. That can't count!

491
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:32,440
You were under oath, Bud. Voter fraud is a felony.

492
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,980
And one more felony and they take me away from you.

493
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,110
You're right. Shit! I am down to one!

494
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:50,030
What do we do?

495
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:58,869
We lie. We have to.

496
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,340
Okay, that's a good plan. Just a little white lie is all this is.

497
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,650
- Between us.
- Just between us.

498
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,380
Who knows, maybe this thing, all these...

499
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,550
Maybe all these people, they just go away.

500
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,000
Stop! Stop!

501
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,400
What the hell is this?

502
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,309
The biggest space we could find.

503
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,650
How we gonna do this? Build a campaign around one man?

504
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,050
- I don't know how to do this.
- You're gonna leave it to me.

505
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,980
We're gonna win him, Don! We're gonna win this guy.

506
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,460
We got the issues on our side!

507
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,230
- There you go!
- He's gonna love me!

508
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,420
What's not to love?

509
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,630
We're in trouble. I need you to dig up everything you can on Earnest Johnson.

510
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:08,170
Talk to his family, his friends.

511
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,469
I want to know what he reads, what television show he watches.

512
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:15,000
His hobbies, his favorite foods, his hopes, his dreams, everything.

513
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:19,880
All we have to do is win over one American mind!

514
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:21,670
You know, I was just thinking, Marty.

515
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:24,579
I'd like to get to know this Bud Johnson. Personally.

516
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:25,820
Okay. Good.

517
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:28,119
Maybe take him out for some ice cream.

518
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:32,650
Ice cream?

519
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,260
What grown man doesn't like ice cream?

520
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,400
No higher education, not much lower education.

521
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:44,869
Divorced single father, recently laid off.

522
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,030
What's our first step?

523
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:49,340
Put you in a room together. See if you persuade him to come over to our side.

524
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:55,380
I like it. Him and me in a room. Yes, talking ideas, seeing what comes up.

525
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,420
Great plan. I'll get you some talking points.

526
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,980
I'm good off the cuff already.

527
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,989
Of course! We're just gonna get an itty bitty think tank together.

528
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:07,760
We'll run the data, see what you two could possibly have in common.

529
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,000
Your petition has been processed.

530
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,699
And in accordance with New Mexico state law, Chapter 1, Article 13, Section 11.

531
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:19,010
Could you do us a favor and back these news people up a little bit?

532
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,000
We could barely sleep last night.

533
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,119
Said voter Earnest Johnson, is hereby authorized...

534
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,110
to recast his vote 10 days from today along official.

535
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,719
And there's a fat guy there, he keeps leaning on my truck...

536
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,780
fixing his hair in my side mirror.

537
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:45,969
Said voter, Earnest Johnson, is hereby authorized to recast his vote...

538
00:44:45,969 --> 00:44:49,440
10 days from today. Along official documentary notification...

539
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,530
to both state, federal regulatory authorities.

540
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:54,739
Bud, life's gonna be a little different from now on.

541
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,039
You'll need security around the clock.

542
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:58,269
For what?

543
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,510
You're a household name.

544
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:03,880
Every political nut job in the country is gonna make their way down here.

545
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:08,480
In 10 days, you gonna make the most important decision in the free world.

546
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,460
And it is our job to make sure this thing comes off fair and square.

547
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,429
So, if there's anything that you think we need to know...

548
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:19,530
Like what?

549
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,300
Something we may find out later.

550
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,070
Better now, than later.

551
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:32,239
No, sir, there's nothing to know.

552
00:45:36,389 --> 00:45:38,949
Molly! Molly! Molly!

553
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:42,219
- I don't believe it. She's his daughter!
- Who's his daughter?

554
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:44,929
The Chairman of the Fed, the girl that won the essay contest.

555
00:45:44,929 --> 00:45:47,050
Remember, I ran the story on her, election day?

556
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:50,460
This is perfect! The network wants to do an interview with her daddy.

557
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:52,630
I'm not going to use this little girl!

558
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,159
I've told you this before. I have integrity, like Paula Zahn.

559
00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:57,010
I met Paula Zahn.

560
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,699
Paula Zahn eats where my friend is a waiter, alright?

561
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:02,340
I don't want to hurt your feelings, you're no Paula Zahn.

562
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:03,469
No Paula Zahn?

563
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:06,079
I booked this story. It was me.

564
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,210
Yes, that's why everybody here is trying to rip it out from under you.

565
00:46:10,489 --> 00:46:13,980
You want a desk in New York, you want a desk in Los Angeles?

566
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:16,519
Forget everything you learned in journalism school.

567
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:21,599
This isn't new anymore. This isn't life. This is bigger. This is television!

568
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,099
The Johnsons have been virtually besieged inside their trailer.

569
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,000
But we're lucky to be joined by their pizza delivery man.

570
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:02,030
How would you characterize Earnest Johnson's state of mind?

571
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,199
Mostly I'd say, he was hungry.

572
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:06,429
He was hungry.

573
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:08,579
Well, there you have it.

574
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,940
I ain't tipping him anymore.

575
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,869
I ought to trim Mrs. Hardy's elm.

576
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:17,539
Looks like it's moving in our roof. What do you think?

577
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,980
Hard to tell. What do you think?

578
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,219
Definitely.

579
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:27,590
Since has become the most Googled town in the world...

580
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:30,420
narrowly edging out in Jihad.

581
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,519
Holy crap!

582
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,230
- You Bud?
- Yeah!

583
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:06,269
You're Richard Petty.

584
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,360
You got it, man.

585
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,099
Hold on. Honey! It's the king!

586
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:14,070
I got a friend down the road I want you to meet. You wanna go for a ride?

587
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,010
Yes! Could my daughter come?

588
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:24,519
In that case, maybe you'd better drive. Precious cargo and all!

589
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,789
Just a minute, Mr. Petty. Hey, Chubby!

590
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,090
Just because it ain't rolling, don't make it furniture! Back out of here!

591
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,730
Come on, baby! We gotta go!

592
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,059
You're Richard Petty!

593
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,769
Molly! Get a picture, honey.

594
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,079
If you told me two days ago that I'd be driving your Dodge...

595
00:48:58,349 --> 00:48:59,579
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

596
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,260
Get one more. Get it with my chin out a little bit. Like that.

597
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:05,119
Like a hero.

598
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,860
I told you, you crazy!

599
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:09,860
You ain't seen nothing yet.

600
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:38,750
Bud!

601
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:41,590
This is the President's plane.

602
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:48,260
Hello, you be Molly. I'm Mr. Fox, I work with the President.

603
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:50,599
Hi. Hi. Bud, Martin Fox.

604
00:49:51,409 --> 00:49:53,469
- Hello.
- How are you? Come in.

605
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:55,269
Take your hat off please. Your hat.

606
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:58,010
So, this is the Johnson family.

607
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,239
Welcome to Air Force One. Hi, Molly.

608
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:01,969
- Thanks for having us, sir.
- It's a pleasure.

609
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:03,880
- Mr. President.
- Huh?

610
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,739
Call him Mr. President.

611
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:09,590
It's an honor, Mr. President.

612
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,820
It's an honor to meet you, Bud. May I call you Bud?

613
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:13,989
Yes, Mr. President.

614
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:15,329
Come on in, come on.

615
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:18,389
God, this...

616
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,400
This place is it's really something!

617
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:25,969
It's my little home in the sky.

618
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:30,440
It's kinda, like a trailer with wings.

619
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:32,539
Fine analogy, Bud.

620
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,980
Molly, I saw your speech on TV the other night.

621
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:37,170
Very impressive!

622
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,889
- Say thank you, baby.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

623
00:50:41,889 --> 00:50:43,719
- You must be a very proud father.
- Yes, sir.

624
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,400
God, I'm sorry. Mr. President.

625
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:54,300
You can see why she's definitely the brains of our operation.

626
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,739
I know what you mean. We all need a Molly.

627
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,000
Marty here, is my Molly.

628
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:03,650
That's right. Molly, I bet a smart kid like you...

629
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,340
would love to see the war room.

630
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,349
No, thanks.

631
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:11,050
Why don't we have a peek and then your dad and the President can have a talk.

632
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,090
Go on, Honey. Daddy has to talk to the President.

633
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:18,860
She's a firecracker!

634
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:21,829
Yes, sir, she's the whole deal!

635
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:25,730
I wouldn't mind seeing the war room, Mr. President.

636
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:30,170
I'll show it to you later. And please, call me Andy.

637
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:32,469
- Andy?
- Yeah.

638
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,510
Are you sure, that-that other guy...

639
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,070
I know, things can get a little formal around here.

640
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:42,820
Commander in Chief, running the country and all that. Please.

641
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,909
I am just an ordinary man, like you...

642
00:51:46,289 --> 00:51:48,050
The kinda guy you can sit down and have a beer with.

643
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,460
Would you like a beer, Bud?

644
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:54,849
A beer?

645
00:51:58,269 --> 00:51:58,960
No shit?

646
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:00,429
No shit.

647
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:03,230
Well, then...

648
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,300
- Yes. Hell, yeah, Andy.
- Okay!

649
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,639
David, would you get us a couple of beers, please?

650
00:52:09,809 --> 00:52:11,940
- Thank you very much.
- So...

651
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,349
you're gonna have some story to tell your friends.

652
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,250
I read about you in the paper. They say you've never lost an election.

653
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:26,320
That's right. You can learn a lot from reading the newspaper.

654
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:31,190
They also said that you don't believe in anything anymore.

655
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,900
Even if it meant selling your mother's soul.

656
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:37,559
No, see, no, see that's libelous, Because my mother is a wonderful...

657
00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:40,869
wonderful, wonderful woman.

658
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,219
If you met my mother, you'd understand.

659
00:52:58,329 --> 00:52:59,519
You a football fan, Bud?

660
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,260
Well, I'm an American, aren't I?

661
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,159
I played a little in high school.

662
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,000
Did you now? What position?

663
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:11,130
I was quarterback.

664
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:16,269
I always thought football was a strategic game. A lot like diplomacy.

665
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:20,010
You got your offense, your defense, the President is like your quarterback...

666
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,480
and the American voters...

667
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,179
Well... they're like the coach.

668
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,519
Never thought of it that way.

669
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,190
Now the coach's job is to make sure...

670
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:34,250
that the right man has the football at the critical time.

671
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,760
I know exactly what you mean, Andy.

672
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,389
Do you?

673
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:42,130
Maybe not.

674
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,099
Bring in the football, please.

675
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:50,940
Bud.

676
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:54,739
You wanna hold the football?

677
00:53:56,449 --> 00:53:57,579
There's a football in there?

678
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:04,920
That case holds the launch codes...

679
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,289
to America's nuclear arsenal.

680
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,199
That's what this election's all about.

681
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:16,489
Launch codes like... missiles and shit?

682
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:20,010
I want you to pretend that America is a team...

683
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,269
- and you're the coach.
- Okay.

684
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,050
Let's say it's the 4th quarter. We've got possession, but we're down by five.

685
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,480
North Korea has us pinned in our own fifteenth line...

686
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,420
with one second on the dooms day clock. What are you doing to do?

687
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:39,650
Okay, you go long. The only thing standing between victory and defeat...

688
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:42,360
is a successful Hail Mary. One play.

689
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,690
Who are you gonna give the ball to, Bud?

690
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:48,099
Do you pin your hopes on some liberal second string quarterback...

691
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:51,329
who hasn't had five minutes in the big show? Of course you don't.

692
00:54:53,409 --> 00:54:54,739
You do the smart thing.

693
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:58,980
The only thing. You go with your strongest arm, the man...

694
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,909
who's carried you through the season, who's never let you down.

695
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,559
Bud, America's counting on you.

696
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:13,750
Yes, sir. I'm not gonna let them down.

697
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,159
But, here.

698
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,530
Wouldn't want to drop the old football.

699
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,769
Blow up France or something.

700
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:24,909
You couldn't.

701
00:55:24,909 --> 00:55:29,539
There's a whole bunch of secret codes and these special little keys.

702
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:30,739
Here's to you!

703
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:36,449
Look at all... Look at all this stuff they give us, Molly.

704
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,519
They give us the same shampoo that the President uses.

705
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,889
Great.

706
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,659
So, what did you guys talk about?

707
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,230
- Stuff.
- What stuff?

708
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,530
You know...

709
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:59,400
grown up stuff.

710
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:00,730
Like?

711
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:03,070
Like...

712
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:08,269
Bud!

713
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,280
What stuff?

714
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:14,480
Like grown up stuff. You know, coaching. Football.

715
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:16,820
Geothermal nuclear war.

716
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:21,789
Andy's, a great... great guy.

717
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,389
He's not Andy. He's the President of the United States.

718
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,690
And he just wants your vote.

719
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,989
And gee, guess what? He's gonna get it.

720
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:31,730
It's not even yours to give!

721
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:34,030
You're gonna...

722
00:56:36,949 --> 00:56:38,340
ruin everything.

723
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:42,380
Andy, the President, invited me to watch the game...

724
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,190
- with him on Monday night.
- That's a bribe!

725
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,210
That's not a bribe.

726
00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:47,409
- Is too.
- It is not.

727
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:48,719
- Is too.
- It is not.

728
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:51,159
- Is too!
- Is not! What it is, "too"?

729
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,559
- What the hell do you know?
- More than you.

730
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:55,659
- You do not.
- Do too.

731
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:57,429
- You do not.
- Do too.

732
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,929
- Fine.
- Fine.

733
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:11,409
Did you smell all the leather on that plane?

734
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:20,210
If I made you feel second best

735
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:24,420
I'm sorry I was blind

736
00:57:25,329 --> 00:57:27,230
No, baby, leave it, leave it. That's Willie.

737
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,019
You were always on my mind

738
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,940
Hi, I'm Willie Nelson.

739
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,070
And when I'm not performing, I'm usually getting involved.

740
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,570
Hey, Bud, if you're out there and you're watching...

741
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,409
He's talking to us!

742
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,349
There's a special dinner, especially for you in your honor...

743
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:55,019
hosted by my good friend and Presidential candidate Donald Greenleaf.

744
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,659
- I'll see you here tonight.
- I'll do it, Willie!

745
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:02,530
This is really getting weird.

746
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,090
Democrat or a Republican?

747
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:35,530
I'm Art Crumb, Donald Greenleaf's campaign manager.

748
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,590
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

749
00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:42,900
You must be Molly. Quite an essay. You have a future in politics one day.

750
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:45,070
You might too. One day.

751
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:48,800
Shall we go in?

752
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,679
Not too hard to be nice, come on.

753
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,280
Party. Party!

754
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,949
Right this way... make yourselves at home.

755
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:03,269
Hello.

756
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:05,969
As you can see, we've got a lovely buffet.

757
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:07,469
Would you like a bud, Bud?

758
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:09,969
Sure.

759
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:15,309
Look at that. You got chipped meat on toast.

760
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,550
My momma used to make that for me.

761
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,989
- No kidding?
- Yes.

762
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:21,679
There's all you can eat.

763
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,250
It's all in your honor.

764
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,219
And there's all the Willie Nelson you can listen to.

765
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,289
I understand you're an aficionado.

766
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:32,300
Yes, sir, I was in an all Willie tribute band for about five years.

767
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:34,130
Called ourselves The Half Nelsons.

768
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,099
Only his songs?

769
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:39,239
No other request. But you know, I got my own stuff.

770
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,710
So, why don't you guys do one of your songs tonight?

771
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:49,550
I would but my rhythm section's incarcerated.

772
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:51,880
We've pulled a few strings.

773
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,960
- Hey, Bud! Bud!
- Hey, boys!

774
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,789
Come on up!

775
00:59:56,829 --> 00:59:57,849
They paying us?

776
00:59:57,929 --> 01:00:01,519
You really did, you got them out. Thank you. Pull strings.

777
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,760
Bud! Buddy, Buddy! Buddy, look at me!

778
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:11,769
Damn, Hank, you look good. Just like prom.

779
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:19,179
Thank you. Thank you, amigo. This is the best day of my life.

780
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,880
There's someone very special I'd like you to meet.

781
01:00:27,389 --> 01:00:29,150
Mr. Johnson!

782
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,050
Donald Greenleaf.

783
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:37,059
Too tight.

784
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:47,340
Hell of a party you got here, Mr. Greenleaf.

785
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:51,239
Yes, sir. We democrats are one hell of a party.

786
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:53,670
Call me Don.

787
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,619
Okay, Don.

788
01:00:59,219 --> 01:01:00,210
The stage awaits.

789
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:05,889
Well, he said so, right?

790
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:35,820
Pontiac, Pontiac

791
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,929
Out there in my backyard.

792
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:43,489
I'm gonna fix it up, paint it red gonna make that engine go

793
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,760

I love everyone of them

798
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:11,880
Molly? You remember me?

799
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,360
Hi, Ms. Madison.

800
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:17,769
Don't worry, I didn't bring a camera.

801
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,960
I'm gonna get one running yet.

802
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:29,170
All this craziness. I don't know how you're doing it.

803
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,409
If you ever want to talk, you call me anytime, okay?

804
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:40,949
I'm gonna give you my card. There you go.

805
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:46,320
You want an interview with Bud, right?

806
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,090
I'd like him to think about it.

807
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,000
Okay.

808
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,400

01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,130
I'll get one running yet

812
01:03:22,429 --> 01:03:24,730
I'll get one running yet

813
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,409
Bud! You're the man!

814
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:44,750
Well... I like you, Bud.

815
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,559
You seem to be a real genuine sort of guy.

816
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:49,449
Thanks, Don.

817
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,219
Tell me about yourself. You got any hobbies?

818
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,929
Just...

819
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:56,829
just fishing.

820
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:01,599
You're a fellow angler!

821
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:04,369
What kind of rod do you use?

822
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:09,269
Well, I use a six and a half foot graphite Johnny Morris signature series.

823
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,800
Heavy?

824
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:12,949
Medium heavy.

825
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:16,510
Bait catching reel, twelve pound test.

826
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:19,150
Don't tell me.

827
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,480
Seven inch power grub, purple shaky worm.

828
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:29,289
Yes, sir! Damn, he, he, you know your equipment!

829
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,300
I figured you for a bass man.

830
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:32,559
Well, I...

831
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:35,139
try to take Molly out as much as I can.

832
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,070
We caught a two dinner stripe on the Pecos just the other day.

833
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:40,670
I'm sorry to hear that, Bud.

834
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,440
Why?

835
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:47,179
There's a bill in the House targeting the Pecos River for...

836
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:49,239
reallocation.

837
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:53,750
You lost me there.

838
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,760
That's where a big corporation builds a dam.

839
01:04:57,190 --> 01:05:00,559
Limits the flow of water, the fish can't get to their spawning grounds...

840
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,400
eventually the whole population dies off.

841
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:10,130
That sucks, because I've been fishing there my whole life.

842
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:13,780
You'd better look for another river, because President Boone has received...

843
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:17,039
ten million dollars in contributions from the energy company...

844
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:19,550
and he's got to pay them back somehow.

845
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:24,940
Come on, now. Come on, Andy wouldn't do that.

846
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:28,320
He already did, Bud. He already did.

847
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:32,360
Okay. Can't you do something?

848
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,199
If I'm elected President.

849
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:45,199
What?

850
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:48,179
No, tell me exactly what was said.

851
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:54,420
It's my commitment to protect the wild places in this country...

852
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:56,179
for future generations.

853
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,619
And I'm not going to stop there, Bud.

854
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:02,179
With your help, my administration...

855
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:04,920
will be a leader in environmental protections.

856
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:23,940
My fellow Americans...

857
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,610
I give you, the Pecos River National Wildlife Preserve!

858
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:47,559
And what can only be characterized as a complete policy reversal...

859
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,300
the President has surely alienated his corporate donors...

860
01:06:51,369 --> 01:06:54,139
by adopting a pro-environment stance.

861
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:56,449
Bud and Molly Johnson were on hand today...

862
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:58,110
We are the environmental party!

863
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:01,420
Those bastards stole our platform.

864
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:05,420
Put the PR people on standby. We gonna need to run some catrats.

865
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:08,389
- You want Spiegelman Fischer?
- Too high brow.

866
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:11,219
- What about those iPod guys?
- No, Larry, too urban.

867
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,489
Get the guys who do those Miller Lite spots.

868
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:17,760
The ones with those girls wrestling in the fountain.

869
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:19,400
I don't know, Mr. Crumb.

870
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,989
I like the narrator's voice. His cadence.

871
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,239
Just call them.

872
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:28,079
Galena hates those ads, Artie, she says they send the wrong message.

873
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,050
Your wife's not our target demographic, that son of a bitch is.

874
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,610
Great.

875
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:38,579
He's got the Secret Service running flight patterns!

876
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:49,559
All we need is an issue that matters to this guy.

877
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,659
One issue, one man...

878
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,960
one vote.

879
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,369
Boy.

880
01:08:05,409 --> 01:08:06,239
I already own it.

881
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,449
Alright, I'm gonna buy a hotel.

882
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,989
Hi, there. I've got a delivery for Bud Johnson.

883
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:21,319
From who?

884
01:08:23,029 --> 01:08:23,930
From everyone.

885
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:49,649
Tell me, what drives Bud Johnson?

886
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:56,319
Right now, an '89 Chevy Silverado.

887
01:08:57,869 --> 01:09:01,270
You don't have to lift that up. If you leave it, it's probably better.

888
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:04,270
- This thing is getting away from you.
- I'm doing the best I can.

889
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:07,579
Do better! I thought you wanted to get out of this shithole town!

890
01:09:07,579 --> 01:09:09,039
I want to get out the facts!

891
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,939
You hear that? The clicking.

892
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,880
Click, click.

893
01:09:16,649 --> 01:09:20,590
The sound of a million remote controls changing the channel on your ass.

894
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,720
Click equals death!

895
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:26,359
You got to get people a reason to watch. This is the prime time news.

896
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:28,460
The key word, being new!

897
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:32,460
Find me something. You just got taken down by Mary Hart!

898
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:38,439
Bud, in looking at it, is there any issue in particular that...

899
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,000
has touched you personally?

900
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,010
Yeah, yeah, insourcing.

901
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:47,180
You mean, outsourcing.

902
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,369
No, I mean in.

903
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,890
- Can you elaborate?
- Yeah, well...

904
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:55,949
where I used to work, there's a bunch of guys I know, they got laid off.

905
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:01,130
Instead of sending our jobs, losing our jobs to Mexico...

906
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,659
they're bringing in Mexicans to take our jobs.

907
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:07,130
And we're out.

908
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,109
Wait a minute, could I say that again? I don't think that came out right.

909
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:12,369
That came out great.

910
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:15,000
That came out very well, Mr. Johnson.

911
01:10:16,279 --> 01:10:18,470
Very authentic. Central casting?

912
01:10:18,909 --> 01:10:20,010
Border patrol?

913
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,350
So, they're actual undocumented workers?

914
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:27,180
We prefer undocumented actors.

915
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:31,760
Alright, rehearsal's up, back it into one please!

916
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,289
But we courted the Pro-lmmigrant movement.

917
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:44,500
Inclusiveness is the foundation of our party. It's our base!

918
01:10:44,569 --> 01:10:48,029
We no longer have a base. Bud Johnson's our base.

919
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,539
I don't even recognize myself anymore.

920
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,369
And what about... Rainbow House?

921
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:56,850
Screw! This guy cares about immigration.

922
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,380
You wanna win? Go out there and rip the Statue of Liberty a new one!

923
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:02,520
And action!

924
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:06,859
Bud, in the last four years, President Boone...

925
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:10,960
has allowed millions of illegal aliens to cross the border...

926
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:15,060
Flooding cities like Los Angeles, New York and Texico.

927
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,609
With your help, Bud, my administration will mend our broken borders...

928
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,539
and stop insourcing.

929
01:11:21,909 --> 01:11:24,880
A vote for Greenleaf is a vote for America...

930
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,479
An America where Americans come first.

931
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:32,680
This land is our land, Bud. Help me keep it that way.

932
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:38,920
Dear Tommy, I was very moved by the letter from your 6th grade class.

933
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:41,800
Global warming is a serious issue...

934
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,630
and I promise to make it a top priority in my discussions with the candidates.

935
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,399
"Dear Mrs. Anderson, thank you for your letter.

936
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:53,109
"I am doing everything I can to press the candidates about health insurance."

937
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:56,569
"Dear Mr. Olsen, I sympathize with your fears about job security.

938
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:59,270
"I promise you, I will not ignore the issues...

939
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:02,750
"Education, veterans, the economy...

940
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:05,479
"health care, the environment.

941
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,489
"I am working tirelessly. I'm doing everything I can.

942
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,729
"Sincerely, Earnest Bud Johnson."

943
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:45,750
Now!

944
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:48,449
Now!

945
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,800
Oh, my God! Don!

946
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,600
The goose is down!

947
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,300
How many fingers?

948
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,770
America wants to know what it's like to be Bud Johnson.

949
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,340
It doesn't suck.

950
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:03,609
Come on!

951
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,869
I've heard you've received marriage proposals in the mail, true?

952
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:11,579
Yeah, you can tell that Miss September...

953
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,050
that I'm weighing my options.

954
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,560
Hurry up, Bud!

955
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,630
People Magazine named you the Sexiest Man of the Year.

956
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,060
Yeah? Well, what can I say?

957
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:26,699
Guilty as charged!

958
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,369
These people!

959
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:32,670
Molly, what do you think of your Dad? What do you think?

960
01:13:43,789 --> 01:13:48,989
Go ahead, go on. Stick your head up with that little camera. You turd!

961
01:13:52,090 --> 01:13:54,289
Bud... Bud!

962
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:56,659
- Freeze!
- Stop.

963
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,220
Stop.

964
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:00,489
Stop!

965
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:06,399
Come on, Molly? It's just chocolate. From the gun people.

966
01:14:06,979 --> 01:14:09,000
- I fixed you bacon and eggs.
- You did?

967
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:10,449
That's nice!

968
01:14:10,449 --> 01:14:13,470
- I want you to look nice.
- What's the occasion?

969
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,750
There's someone I think you should talk to.

970
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:16,770
Sit.

971
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:22,020
She's different than all the others. I think her heart's in the right place.

972
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:25,159
I want you to try not to say anything embarrassing, okay?

973
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,020
- To who?
- Ms. Madison.

974
01:14:29,869 --> 01:14:32,060
- The TV woman?
- She's outside.

975
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:35,199
- She's outside?
- Yes. In the kitchen.

976
01:14:36,369 --> 01:14:38,239
- She's in our kitchen?
- Yes.

977
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,640
Just try and be normal.

978
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,229
Do I smell?

979
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:50,079
Then, give me the Old Spice. God darn it! I was just having some fun!

980
01:14:56,829 --> 01:14:58,550
Molly, these eggs are amazing.

981
01:14:59,489 --> 01:15:01,619
Yes, they sure are.

982
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,220
Thanks.

983
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,329
Well...

984
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,029
I like this new look on you.

985
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:16,069
It's good, isn't it? Professional.

986
01:15:16,409 --> 01:15:19,279
Yeah, its damn good.

987
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:25,149
Anyway, Bud, I was thinking about interviewing you over the next days.

988
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:27,560
Get to know you and your thoughts.

989
01:15:28,659 --> 01:15:31,960
Think people really care about my thoughts?

990
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,590
I really do considering the choice you're about to make.

991
01:15:38,029 --> 01:15:39,500
Did you say you went to Texico High?

992
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,489
She did. Only her name was Morales.

993
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,000
Morales?

994
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:52,640
You're kidding. One of Bobby Morales little sisters?

995
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,479
Yeah, that's me.

996
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:56,550
Small world!

997
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:00,189
Small town. Then, Bud, are you ready?

998
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:01,819
It's a good time?

999
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:04,680
Yeah, go ahead, shoot.

1000
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:19,770
Thanks, Bud.

1001
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:24,939
Why don't we get started with your opinion of gay marriage.

1002
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:28,180
Shit! Do we have to?

1003
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,619
- So, you're against it.
- I... no, I didn't say that.

1004
01:16:31,949 --> 01:16:33,579
Then, what is your position?

1005
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,390
I don't have a position on it. Actually, I don't give a rat's ass about it.

1006
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:42,859
My daddy always said whatever a king does in his castle is his business.

1007
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:47,090
I guess the same can go for two queens.

1008
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:56,840
I'm President Boone, and I'd like you to meet a few friends of mine.

1009
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:00,039
They're our doctors, and our peace officers.

1010
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:03,779
They teach our children, they serve nobly in our armed forces.

1011
01:17:03,949 --> 01:17:06,149
For two long, homosexual Americans...

1012
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:08,180
have been persecuted by the country they love.

1013
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:13,989
This President, if re-elected, will implement the open door initiative.

1014
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:19,329
Gay Americans alike will be able to proudly step out of the closet...

1015
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:24,569
and on to the alter, to exchange the sacred vows enjoyed by the rest of us.

1016
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:29,579
Bud, With your help, this Republican administration...

1017
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:32,880
will say, I do. To gay marriage.

1018
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,750
I do.

1019
01:17:37,649 --> 01:17:38,350
I do.

1020
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:39,920
I do!

1021
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,609
I do.

1022
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,689
I do!

1023
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:45,489
I do!

1024
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:53,060
- I did it!
- That 'a way, baby!

1025
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,970
When we were kids, this was the only thing to do on the weekends.

1026
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:00,810
Still is.

1027
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,920
Well done, Bud.

1028
01:18:14,819 --> 01:18:15,380
See?

1029
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,819
Let's get to some real issues.

1030
01:18:19,590 --> 01:18:20,220
Okay.

1031
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:24,489
Pro-life or pro-choice? Where do you stand?

1032
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,829
Well...

1033
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:33,710
Life's pretty good. Right about now.

1034
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,409
So, you're pro-life then?

1035
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:39,739
Who isn't?

1036
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,069
Artie.

1037
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,750
- Artie.
- What?

1038
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:52,960
I don't feel comfortable with this. We're headed in the wrong direction.

1039
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,289
No, it's gonna be great.

1040
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:56,289
- Artie.
- And action! Action!

1041
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,829
And action, Donald!

1042
01:19:02,699 --> 01:19:03,899
What is our future?

1043
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,470
I'll tell you what our future is.

1044
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:10,250
Children like these, like your daughter, Bud.

1045
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:13,340
Happy, free, full of promise.

1046
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,680
But imagine a world without all this joyous laughter.

1047
01:19:19,449 --> 01:19:21,119
I'm talking about abortion.

1048
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:24,729
President Boone, he claims he's pro-life.

1049
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,229
But yet under his leadership...

1050
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:30,430
no significant challenge has been leveled against Roe versus Wade.

1051
01:19:30,569 --> 01:19:33,439
With your help, Bud, the Greenleaf administration...

1052
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:38,340
will lead a genuine effort to reverse this inhumane court decision.

1053
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:43,170
So, join me and the Democrats as we preserve all life...

1054
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,810
That's for filling God's intelligent design.

1055
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:51,180
I'm Donald Greenleaf and I approve this message.

1056
01:19:51,449 --> 01:19:53,220
That don't seem right.

1057
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:56,920
He's only saying that because you said you didn't like abortion.

1058
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:58,960
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

1059
01:19:59,189 --> 01:20:01,090
You told that you were pro-life.

1060
01:20:02,659 --> 01:20:03,289
So what?

1061
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:07,359
Pro-life means anti-abortion. Roe versus Wade? Hello!

1062
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:09,229
This isn't working.

1063
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:12,539
I thought would help, but it's just worse.

1064
01:20:12,609 --> 01:20:14,539
You're the one that wanted me to talk to her.

1065
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:17,739
I thought you might like her. She's smart, and nice...

1066
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,970
not like the other women you spend time with.

1067
01:20:23,649 --> 01:20:25,350
Which women would those be, Molly?

1068
01:20:25,819 --> 01:20:27,520
The ones that dance, Bud.

1069
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:31,119
Well, at least they got jobs.

1070
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:35,600
It's all getting turned upside down now.

1071
01:20:36,130 --> 01:20:38,760
What's all getting turned upside down?

1072
01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:41,560
You're ruining America!

1073
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,899
- I'm what?
- You're ruining America!

1074
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,010
- I'm ruining America?
- Yes!

1075
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:47,529
What?

1076
01:20:48,979 --> 01:20:52,779
What I finally am is having a little good luck...

1077
01:20:52,779 --> 01:20:54,539
and you're giving me shit about it!

1078
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,609
You know what all this means for someone like me?

1079
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:04,689
I had dreams once. Maybe it weren't this...

1080
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:07,750
but I was in the fifth grade, so I had them.

1081
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,819
And now...

1082
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:15,470
I pretty much been headed on a road for being a nobody and now that...

1083
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:19,770
I am a somebody, you can't stand that I'm getting a little attention.

1084
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:23,069
- A little?
- Yeah, a little.

1085
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,970
Maybe I'll tell the truth, Bud.

1086
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:27,979
- The truth?
- Yes.

1087
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:31,279
The truth about what?

1088
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,689
Maybe I'll tell everybody it was me who tried to vote while you got drunk!

1089
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,319
I don't care if they take me away from you.

1090
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:39,989
Molly... Hey, Molly!

1091
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:43,420
Leave me alone.

1092
01:21:49,869 --> 01:21:51,770
- Fine.
- Fine.

1093
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:54,930
Fine.

1094
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:48,260
Could you sign it?

1095
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,460
Sure thing, Curly.

1096
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:59,029
Hey, Bud... did you give the President's butt a kiss from us?

1097
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:05,439
You got something to say, Walt?

1098
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,750
It's not just me, Bud. No one likes what you done to this town.

1099
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:14,050
What's gonna happen after you vote?

1100
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:18,289
Everyone's gonna pack up and leave us in the same shape as they found us.

1101
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,760
Bud, you're on TV again!

1102
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:26,569
Hey, Bud, you're on TV again.

1103
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:28,699
People have to stop saying Bud Johnson is good for democracy.

1104
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:32,060
He's made us the laughing stock of the entire world.

1105
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:35,880
The news media follows him around like a bunch of paparazzi, because...

1106
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,210
we're more concerned with his fifteen minutes of fame...

1107
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,640
than we are with the choice he's about to make.

1108
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,239
Is anybody really listening to this guy?

1109
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:48,060
Wake up, America! Bud Johnson, is a dumbass!

1110
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,539
Your wife has just arrived, Mr. Greenleaf.

1111
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:10,340
Thank God! Good.

1112
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,010
Please, don't upset him.

1113
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:16,279
When did you get in? I missed you so much!

1114
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,819
You are letting this two bit hack destroy you.

1115
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,789
You are everything that the Republicans accused you of being.

1116
01:24:24,789 --> 01:24:27,760
A spineless amateur. Afraid to take a position.

1117
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,890
I am not afraid to take a position.

1118
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:33,560
Okay, sometimes I have second thoughts.

1119
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,829
But what thinking person doesn't?

1120
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:39,810
You used to stand for something. Both of you.

1121
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:41,340
Let her go.

1122
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,909
What's happened to you, Art?

1123
01:24:44,409 --> 01:24:45,710
I'm gonna win this time.

1124
01:24:46,010 --> 01:24:48,579
You used to run campaigns that meant something.

1125
01:24:48,579 --> 01:24:53,649
They would have meant something if the candidates I backed had won!

1126
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,260
You know what's like to be on the right side of every issue on the theory stage?

1127
01:24:59,659 --> 01:25:01,930
The hope that rocks with every loss?

1128
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,170
Not this time. Never again.

1129
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:21,010
Back to work! Everybody!

1130
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:28,689
Look at that!

1131
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:31,989
You burnt the hot dog, just a little bit.

1132
01:25:32,489 --> 01:25:33,760
Just the way I like them!

1133
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,729
- Bud?
- Yes?

1134
01:25:38,569 --> 01:25:43,000
I think we should ask for a Presidential debate.

1135
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:49,039
Come on! Can't we just talk about something else for one night?

1136
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:51,069
Just for a minute? Maybe?

1137
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:55,739
What did you just say to me?

1138
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,380
A Presidential debate. Where you get to ask questions.

1139
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,920
Please. Just stop.

1140
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:05,420
It's important! It could help you decide.

1141
01:26:05,489 --> 01:26:07,050
Help me decide.

1142
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:09,430
Think about what you're saying to me.

1143
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,659
I have! You should read all this mail you've been getting.

1144
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:15,029
People are writing to you for help.

1145
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,600
People are writing me letters. So what?

1146
01:26:18,109 --> 01:26:20,270
I can't help these people.

1147
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:23,439
You can speak for them.

1148
01:26:27,819 --> 01:26:28,800
Will you do it for me?

1149
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:37,819
I'm doing this all because of you!

1150
01:26:42,829 --> 01:26:46,390
Confirmed, one Presidential debate will occur this Wednesday night...

1151
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:50,000
at which Mr. Johnson will ask both candidates a set of questions.

1152
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,970
The following day, he'll cast his vote.

1153
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:59,340
Bud, what will you ask at the debate?

1154
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,850
Truth is, I don't know yet, but I'm...

1155
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,579
I'll figure it out.

1156
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:15,520
I hate debates. Where they try-to trick you.

1157
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:17,869
I know, but you'll be fine.

1158
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:20,729
We have two days to sew this thing up.

1159
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,329
I'm gonna need you to meet with Bud again.

1160
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:27,670
And, offer him a little incentive.

1161
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:31,470
What do you want me to do? Give him a bag of cash?

1162
01:27:31,609 --> 01:27:33,479
No, he's got too much attention on him for that.

1163
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:36,510
I was thinking that maybe you'd offer him a job.

1164
01:27:37,050 --> 01:27:40,079
Something with benefits. If you know what I mean.

1165
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,579
Marty, I've been meaning to talk to you.

1166
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:47,319
I'm not sure about our strategy on this whole Bud thing.

1167
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,960
You've never questioned me before. On anything.

1168
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:52,189
Ever.

1169
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:56,729
I know and I'm not saying I won't do it. I just...

1170
01:27:58,369 --> 01:27:59,840
I can't shake this feeling...

1171
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,380
The way we've been switching positions, and now offering Bud...

1172
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:08,319
We're just doing what we always do.

1173
01:28:10,449 --> 01:28:11,039
That's all.

1174
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,050
Dancing the dance, Courting the voters.

1175
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:19,489
Except this time, it's only one voter.

1176
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:22,229
It's one guy.

1177
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:25,229
This is history, Mr. President.

1178
01:28:26,569 --> 01:28:28,159
It's never happened before.

1179
01:28:28,699 --> 01:28:32,829
This is a moment the whole world will remember. Forever.

1180
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:36,329
I understand.

1181
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:44,619
What are we about?

1182
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,079
Winning.

1183
01:28:47,659 --> 01:28:51,289
Because if we don't win, you can't do what you set out to do.

1184
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,189
And what you've done, won't matter.

1185
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:57,989
If we don't win, it's all over.

1186
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,229
And you're over.

1187
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:02,390
Bud!

1188
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,600
Bud!

1189
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:11,670
What time is it?

1190
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:14,840
Late. It's late. You promised to take me in today.

1191
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:18,680
Okay! Just give me a few minutes.

1192
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,550
What's today?

1193
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:25,520
Forget it.

1194
01:29:28,829 --> 01:29:30,630
Can you take me, please?

1195
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:35,170
Yeah Ye. Let's go.

1196
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:41,470
Oh, God!

1197
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:46,340
Hey, wait a minute, Molly.

1198
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:56,449
Molly! Molly!

1199
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,460
Mr. Johnson... Mr. Johnson!

1200
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:02,159
The President would like a word with you.

1201
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,489
- The President?
- Yes, sir.

1202
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:08,630
Hey, get a life!

1203
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,970
I used to work at Gilmore before I got laid off.

1204
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:17,199
Now, I find work wherever I can.

1205
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:20,739
Mow people's lawns, fixing stuff.

1206
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,010
Hasn't been easy.

1207
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:27,010
Molly.

1208
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:34,159
I'd sure appreciate it if your Dad could put in a good word for me at the plant.

1209
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:38,590
Okay. Thank you, Michael and Mr. Everett for that...

1210
01:30:39,899 --> 01:30:40,890
presentation.

1211
01:30:42,199 --> 01:30:43,500
Who's next?

1212
01:30:44,210 --> 01:30:44,800
Molly.

1213
01:31:01,619 --> 01:31:03,949
I guess you all probably know my dad.

1214
01:31:06,789 --> 01:31:08,789
He really wanted to be here today, but...

1215
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,520
he had so many important things to do.

1216
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,229
He's doing his best, but...

1217
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:19,369
he can't be everywhere at once.

1218
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:24,270
Ever since all this stuff happened...

1219
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:29,239
he's really been under a lot of pressure.

1220
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:34,479
I just want you to know that...

1221
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:38,319
he takes his responsibilities seriously...

1222
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:43,500
and that he really cares about helping poor people...

1223
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:45,529
and sick people.

1224
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,760
And people that can't help themselves.

1225
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:55,770
My...

1226
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:02,909
my dad wants to make this country a better place.

1227
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:19,859
Do you think much about your future?

1228
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,159
What future?

1229
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:25,640
I know what you mean.

1230
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,399
We all worry about the sun down years.

1231
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:31,579
Sooner or later, all this hoopla is gonna die down.

1232
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:33,279
They're gonna build me a library.

1233
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:34,979
And you're gonna be just another face in the crowd.

1234
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:38,479
Can't wait.

1235
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,079
What you need to think about is security.

1236
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:44,420
Now I've got a friend...

1237
01:32:46,359 --> 01:32:50,520
who might have a job for you. In the lobby business.

1238
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:54,689
Like opening doors for people?

1239
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:56,670
Very astute!

1240
01:32:57,199 --> 01:33:00,170
Open doors to politicians. And their checkbooks.

1241
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:03,409
People really like you, Bud. They feel like you're one of them.

1242
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:06,810
I'm not quite following you, Andy.

1243
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,590
Sometimes you gotta figure out what you want in this life.

1244
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:19,289
Then you have to decide how much it's worth to you.

1245
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:22,289
Because they're gonna put it on your tombstone.

1246
01:33:24,270 --> 01:33:25,229
It's your legacy.

1247
01:33:26,829 --> 01:33:28,770
A measure of what you left behind.

1248
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:31,470
Are we...

1249
01:33:33,739 --> 01:33:35,500
are we still talking about the job?

1250
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,640
The lobby business?

1251
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:45,449
Right. Forget that.

1252
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,050
It's not worth it.

1253
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:01,300
And thank you.

1254
01:34:35,899 --> 01:34:36,600
Molly!

1255
01:34:37,869 --> 01:34:39,899
You said that if I ever wanted to talk, right?

1256
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:44,640
Here's some hot cocoa.

1257
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:48,409
Sorry. All I had was skim milk.

1258
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,550
It's okay.

1259
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:53,590
So... what's going on?

1260
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,689
- It's all my fault.
- What's your fault?

1261
01:34:58,029 --> 01:35:00,079
Bud was supposed to meet me after school.

1262
01:35:00,289 --> 01:35:03,199
He knew how important it was to me. But he got drunk.

1263
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,439
He never even showed up. I didn't know what else to do!

1264
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:09,630
Wait, Molly, what are you saying?

1265
01:35:11,569 --> 01:35:12,159
Molly?

1266
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:14,829
Aren't you gonna get that?

1267
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:20,579
Yeah, give me two seconds. Stay here. I'm gonna get them off the phone.

1268
01:35:30,829 --> 01:35:35,760
Can call you back? This isn't a good time. Yeah, I know.

1269
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,659
I know. You already told me that.

1270
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,680
Look, can I call you back?

1271
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:50,039
Molly?

1272
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:52,369
Molly!

1273
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:09,319
Are you okay?

1274
01:36:10,899 --> 01:36:12,890
You think your dad might be passed out tonight?

1275
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:18,859
Then, you're going to recast your vote.

1276
01:36:18,970 --> 01:36:21,600
I guess it ain't that much of a secret then, is it?

1277
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:29,210
If we are to be the exception to history, then we must break the cycle.

1278
01:36:29,819 --> 01:36:31,649
For those who do not remember the past...

1279
01:36:33,649 --> 01:36:35,590
Remind me again who's running?

1280
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:38,159
So, what you're saying is, you're keeping...

1281
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:41,859
It's all my fault. Bud was supposed to meet me after school.

1282
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,229
He knew how important this was to me. But he got drunk.

1283
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:48,970
He didn't even show up. I didn't know what else to do!

1284
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:50,539
Molly, what are you saying?

1285
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:51,529
He didn't vote!

1286
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:56,079
What do you mean, she's missing?

1287
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:57,550
I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson. It's all my fault.

1288
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,880
For crying out loud, Lewis!

1289
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,840
You guys guard Presidents.

1290
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:05,520
She's smarter!

1291
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,050
Tell me about it!

1292
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,229
What is all this?

1293
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,760
She's been answering your mail.

1294
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:26,329
For what?

1295
01:37:29,079 --> 01:37:32,600
She wanted people to think that you cared.

1296
01:37:34,180 --> 01:37:35,109
She told you that?

1297
01:37:49,329 --> 01:37:52,460
Does have any friends we should contact?

1298
01:37:52,529 --> 01:37:53,359
I don't know.

1299
01:37:58,609 --> 01:38:01,699
No, she's not the friend type.

1300
01:38:02,909 --> 01:38:03,470
Jed.

1301
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:07,479
- Jed? Who's Jed?
- It's a boy she likes.

1302
01:38:07,479 --> 01:38:09,680
She likes a boy?

1303
01:38:09,979 --> 01:38:11,979
Jed Barkley. He's in her class.

1304
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:14,550
He's a little shy, but they're friends.

1305
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:19,250
- Is she told you that?
- Yes, sir.

1306
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,529
Do you have any idea where she might be going?

1307
01:38:33,069 --> 01:38:36,010
Yeah, I'm can guess where she's going.

1308
01:38:36,539 --> 01:38:38,340
Just tell us where, we'll go pick her up, sir.

1309
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:44,880
She's my daughter. I'll get her myself.

1310
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:12,409
This is it.

1311
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,479
Sure you wanna go in?

1312
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,840
Came this far, didn't we?

1313
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:23,810
I'll wait here awhile. Just in case you want to go home.

1314
01:39:29,159 --> 01:39:30,630
I never want to go home.

1315
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:06,659
Yes?

1316
01:40:07,869 --> 01:40:09,500
I'm looking for Larissa Star.

1317
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:15,739
Well, she's gone. She's moved out a long time ago.

1318
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,010
I think you're her.

1319
01:40:31,829 --> 01:40:32,590
You Jed?

1320
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,319
- It's okay, is she in there?
- Yes, sir.

1321
01:40:39,529 --> 01:40:40,470
Wait here.

1322
01:40:49,239 --> 01:40:50,399
You're all grown up!

1323
01:40:51,810 --> 01:40:53,010
You look like your dad.

1324
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:56,239
He says I look like you.

1325
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:01,020
Does he? So, why did you come here?

1326
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:06,189
You wrote me a letter. You said I could come live with you.

1327
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:09,800
That was a long time ago, honey.

1328
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,359
Things have changed.

1329
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:17,729
I'm close to getting a record deal. Real close.

1330
01:41:18,810 --> 01:41:20,670
I did a gig a couple of months ago.

1331
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:26,380
This guy wants to put me in touch with this big time Nashville producer.

1332
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,010
So he's gonna call me. I'm not gonna be ready.

1333
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,880
I gotta get ready. There's a lot I gotta do, so I can't do this.

1334
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:37,789
I'm not well. Can't you see that?

1335
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,590
I can take care of you, Mom.

1336
01:41:41,829 --> 01:41:44,920
I don't want anybody to take care of me. I don't want you here.

1337
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,029
Dad!

1338
01:41:50,699 --> 01:41:52,369
Jesus Christ, Larissa!

1339
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:54,909
I don't want her to see me like this.

1340
01:41:54,909 --> 01:41:58,640
Molly, you gotta go outside, okay? For me. You got out there and wait.

1341
01:41:59,109 --> 01:42:01,909
- Dad!
- Just outside. Now!

1342
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:14,149
I heard you'd finally gotten cleaned up.

1343
01:42:14,529 --> 01:42:18,159
Who told you that? My God, what is going on out there?

1344
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:19,000
I can't explain.

1345
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,229
What are you, famous now? You think you can just come? I can't do this!

1346
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,500
- Wait...
- No! No! Come here.

1347
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:28,079
I'm not mad, Larissa.

1348
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:29,270
I'm trying to tell you...

1349
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:33,479
I can't be a mom right now. I can't. Stay back! I can't...

1350
01:42:33,479 --> 01:42:37,470
be a mom right now. I can't do it. I can't do it.

1351
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,590
Said no reporters, Lewis.

1352
01:43:51,789 --> 01:43:53,159
I just want to talk to you.

1353
01:43:53,159 --> 01:43:54,590
I don't have time, Kate.

1354
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:59,470
I'm moderating a Presidential debate tomorrow night in front of a zillion.

1355
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:03,130
So as much as I'd love for you to make an ass out of me again on TV...

1356
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,899
I kinda have some preparing to do.

1357
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:11,710
I have to catch up on the issues.

1358
01:44:12,779 --> 01:44:14,140
Like all of them!

1359
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:15,239
Bud.

1360
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,819
I know what happened election night.

1361
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:25,189
I'm running the story. I just want to make sure I've got my facts right.

1362
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:29,529
The bartender claims you left the Starline about 7:30.

1363
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:30,859
Is that correct?

1364
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:32,390
Yes, madam.

1365
01:44:32,829 --> 01:44:36,029
Giving you plenty of time to meet at the polling station...

1366
01:44:36,899 --> 01:44:37,960
and cast your vote...

1367
01:44:38,609 --> 01:44:39,159
right?

1368
01:44:42,279 --> 01:44:45,109
I... guess so.

1369
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:47,600
Just making sure.

1370
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,510
I'm sorry. I got something for you.

1371
01:44:56,989 --> 01:44:58,960
Kinda forgot who I was for a moment.

1372
01:44:59,829 --> 01:45:00,819
Forgive me?

1373
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:02,789
That depends.

1374
01:45:04,529 --> 01:45:07,090
Can you help me, help him tonight?

1375
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:11,270
I'd love to.

1376
01:45:12,109 --> 01:45:14,869
I work two jobs just trying to make ends meet.

1377
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:17,039
Last year my son was diagnosed with...

1378
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:22,449
Law makers renewed the primary programs for low income HIV and AIDS patients.

1379
01:45:22,779 --> 01:45:25,720
Named for Ryan White, a young AIDS activist...

1380
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:47,460
Good evening everyone.

1381
01:46:47,670 --> 01:46:51,000
We come to you live from a small American town...

1382
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:54,840
a town most of us had never heard of just a few weeks ago.

1383
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:57,180
A town you couldn't find on the map...

1384
01:46:57,180 --> 01:47:00,640
because Texico, New Mexico, wasn't on the map.

1385
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:02,710
But it's on the map now.

1386
01:47:02,779 --> 01:47:06,579
The whole world has descended on this town for an historic event.

1387
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:09,619
A political debate unlike any other.

1388
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,350
Tomorrow morning, Earnest Bud Johnson...

1389
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:15,090
will walk into a voting booth and make a choice.

1390
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:20,760
And his choice will affect our lives for generations to come.

1391
01:47:21,329 --> 01:47:25,000
The stakes could not be higher. What do you expect?

1392
01:47:25,069 --> 01:47:28,939
I wonder, Aaron, what the founding fathers would make of all this.

1393
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:32,840
Would they be mortified, or would they be jumping for joy?

1394
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:36,210
Something tells me that somewhere right now...

1395
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:40,840
Franklin and Jefferson are looking down and smiling.

1396
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,779
Smiling or laughing?

1397
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,960
I don't know if they're smiling.

1398
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,289
That's not exactly who they had in mind for picking the President of the USA.

1399
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:52,960
We're sending someone out there who really is, as far as, we can tell lost.

1400
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:56,260
Can he find himself suddenly, tonight on this stage...

1401
01:47:56,399 --> 01:47:58,770
Or is he going to look like a rodeo clown down there?

1402
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:03,069
Tonight, the whole country is watching and we watch with you.

1403
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:05,409
I'm gonna puke.

1404
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:07,539
Bud, look at me. Look at me.

1405
01:48:08,180 --> 01:48:10,909
Just be yourself. You're gonna be great.

1406
01:48:14,859 --> 01:48:17,880
Hey, remember dad. No cussing! Okay?

1407
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:19,880
- Fine.
- Fine.

1408
01:48:20,859 --> 01:48:22,800
Mr. Johnson, one minute, please.

1409
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,000
Good luck!

1410
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:32,800
And so we begin.

1411
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:36,109
The crowd has settled down and we go to the stage...

1412
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:37,640
for what promises to be...

1413
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:42,380
one of the most unique moments in American political history.

1414
01:49:25,789 --> 01:49:28,350
Mr. President, Mr. Greenleaf...

1415
01:49:29,529 --> 01:49:32,930
I'd like to thank you for your hospitality. It's been real interesting.

1416
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:36,189
I've said a lot of thing I didn't mean. And you both...

1417
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:38,710
made a lot of promises...

1418
01:49:38,710 --> 01:49:40,329
you probably won't be able to keep.

1419
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,739
To be honest, the last 10 days have felt like a weird dream.

1420
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:55,750
What was once kinda funny, isn't anymore.

1421
01:49:57,619 --> 01:49:58,819
From what I've read, I've...

1422
01:50:00,989 --> 01:50:03,390
well, I've scared the hell out of America.

1423
01:50:04,359 --> 01:50:07,770
I know that the world is watching, maybe even laughing.

1424
01:50:08,229 --> 01:50:10,329
People on my own TV, are saying...

1425
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:13,829
that America, somehow, deserves this moment.

1426
01:50:15,810 --> 01:50:17,109
Guess that means me.

1427
01:50:19,979 --> 01:50:23,939
I can't say that I've been much of anything most of my life.

1428
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:26,750
It's sorta like somewhere along the way...

1429
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:31,590
I checked out and it's not like I had big dreams to begin with.

1430
01:50:31,590 --> 01:50:34,619
But I had something once.

1431
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:37,699
I had something close to faith or hope or whatever...

1432
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,130
whatever word you want to use for how good life could be.

1433
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:49,439
But then, the years start moving quicker and all of a sudden...

1434
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:51,380
what's going good out there for every else...

1435
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:54,569
isn't going so good for you.

1436
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,779
But, tonight I feel...

1437
01:51:00,619 --> 01:51:01,520
embarrassed.

1438
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,319
I've had my chances, more than most.

1439
01:51:08,630 --> 01:51:10,220
I've grown up in a country where...

1440
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,760
if I decided to do more with my life than just drift and drink...

1441
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:16,859
that I could be standing where...

1442
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:20,130
where maybe you stand tonight.

1443
01:51:20,909 --> 01:51:24,810
Instead, I've taken freely and I've given nothing.

1444
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:27,510
I'm ashamed in front of my...

1445
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,039
daughter.

1446
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:34,409
And my country.

1447
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,729
I've never served or sacrificed.

1448
01:51:38,729 --> 01:51:43,159
The only heavy lifting I've been asked is simple stuff, like...

1449
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:46,729
pay attention. Vote...

1450
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:50,930
For America has a...

1451
01:51:52,909 --> 01:51:55,840
if America has a true enemy tonight, I guess it's me.

1452
01:51:58,409 --> 01:52:02,399
Tonight a below average man is going to choose between two exceptional men.

1453
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:05,869
Tomorrow, one man's vote is going to make a difference...

1454
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:09,079
'Cause tomorrow we're gonna have a President.

1455
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,979
And not just someone to fill a chair in Washington.

1456
01:52:13,689 --> 01:52:16,220
We need someone who's bigger than their speeches.

1457
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:20,859
The kind of President we learned about in school.

1458
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,659
America needs a big thinker.

1459
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:29,100
You know, like a giant, really.

1460
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:32,609
Someone who has the good sense to get in front of our problems.

1461
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:36,250
Somebody who has the wisdom to lead to us a place...

1462
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,619
where we're at peace with ourselves and the world.

1463
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:43,850
And just for the record, I want you both...

1464
01:52:45,090 --> 01:52:47,890
I want you both to know that I think a hella lot of you.

1465
01:52:58,739 --> 01:53:03,180
Tonight, I am going to speak for people I have never met...

1466
01:53:06,310 --> 01:53:09,210
whose letters touched me in a way I didn't think was possible.

1467
01:53:12,449 --> 01:53:14,420
My first question comes from...

1468
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,850
Peter Manthis, in Henderson, Kentucky.

1469
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:18,449
"Dear Mr. Johnson...

1470
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:21,319
"my wife and I have three little girls.

1471
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:24,960
"We both work two jobs just trying to make ends meet.

1472
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:29,189
"And some weeks, we don't make it."

1473
01:53:29,899 --> 01:53:32,770
"When you work hard and you still can't take care of your family...

1474
01:53:32,770 --> 01:53:36,399
"you start to question yourself as a provider, as a man.

1475
01:53:37,539 --> 01:53:40,739
"I know I am one. I fought for my country and I'm proud of it.

1476
01:53:42,449 --> 01:53:46,819
"But it scares me to think about what would happen if one of my kids got sick.

1477
01:53:48,449 --> 01:53:52,890
"Can you ask the candidates, if we are richest country in the world...

1478
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:57,390
"how come some many of us can barely afford to live here?"

1479
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,989
I'd like to take that one first, if I might, Mr. Greenleaf.

1480
01:54:04,069 --> 01:54:05,369
Answer, Mr. President.

1481
01:54:07,609 --> 01:54:11,510
Bud, I'd first like to say, how much I appreciate your thoughtfulness.

1482
01:55:29,609 --> 01:55:40,510
