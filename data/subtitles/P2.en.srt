1
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:30,076
Yes, sir. I redrafted the contracts
to include the new stipulations.

2
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,676
-Then where are they?
-I'm faxing the revisions now.

3
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:34,311
Did you make all the changes I asked for?

4
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,823
Yes. I included the four percent increase
and the extra 2 million.

5
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:42,124
No, no. If it's a four percent increase then
you have to add at least 3 million dollars.

6
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,594
That's not what I was told.

7
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,198
-Who told you that?
-Their lawyers.

8
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:50,169
They're all idiots! I don't understand
this total lack of communication.

9
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,502
It's okay. I just had no way of knowing, sir.

10
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,038
Look, this is what I need you to do.

11
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,509
-Sir, could I put you on hold for a second?
-Okay.

12
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,741
-Thanks. Hi, Jody.
-Mr. Harper wants to see you in his office.

13
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,417
-Great. Of course.
-Still want me to fax those?

14
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,921
You don't have to. I'm not even done yet.
You should go home.

15
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,547
-Are you sure?
-It's late.

16
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:12,592
I don't want your parents to worry.
Get out of here.

17
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,152
-Okay. Merry Christmas, Angela.
-Merry Christmas, Jody.

18
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,467
Hi, Lorraine. Of course I'm going to make it.

19
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,909
Just let me call you back. Okay?

20
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,749
In a few minutes, I promise. Okay.

21
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,447
Still on the Morgan deal?

22
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,413
What can I do for you, Jim?

23
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,453
I...

24
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,894
I don't know how to...

25
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,596
Angela, I feel terrible about what happened.

26
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:58,199
It's fine. Let's just not worry about it, okay?

27
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:02,638
No, it's not okay. I acted like a real jerk.

28
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:08,111
I had too many drinks and... You know
how these Christmas parties can be.

29
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,011
We had a baby last year, and...

30
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:14,817
It's been a hard year.

31
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,257
I'm sure that it has.

32
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:21,658
I simply want to tell you
that I'm really, really sorry. Okay?

33
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,961
Apology accepted.

34
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:29,028
Thanks. Merry Christmas, Angela.

35
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:30,799
You too, Jim.

36
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,843
You calling me from work?
Thought you were going home first.

37
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,716
-I brought everything with me. Don't worry.
Get over here, Angie.

38
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,815
God, I am
so late with this dinner.

39
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,486
Did you pick up the Santa Claus costume?
I hope you didn't forget it.

40
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,462
It's in the car.

41
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,057
I think Dad is more excited than the kids.

42
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,630
I can't wait to get out of here
and see you guys.

43
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:04,967
Jimmy, put that back.
We're having dinner soon.

44
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,269
-You want Santa to come tonight or not?
Mommy, I want Santa to come.

45
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,367
Then help me set the table.

46
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,743
-Please don't be late.
-I won't. I promise.

47
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,475
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

48
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,047
Okay.

49
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,521
-Oh, Jesus!
-My God!

50
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,062
-Sorry, Angela...
-It's okay.

51
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,830
I was just locking up the floors.
I didn't know anybody would be working

52
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,565
this late on Christmas Eve.

53
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,470
-Me neither.
-Sorry.

54
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,600
I'll come back later, all right?

55
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,440
Actually, if you wouldn't
mind waiting, I'll lock my office

56
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:20,776
-and take the elevator down with you.
-Sure.

57
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,145
Two seconds.

58
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,777
Do you work all night?

59
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:28,015
Yeah, but they're closing the building
for the next three days.

60
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,780
-Besides, I get New Year's Eve off.
-That's good.

61
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:34,123
I hope to get home in time
for the girls to open up the presents.

62
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,356
-How are they?
-Great.

63
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:40,528
-Your parents can't stand me.
-You're wrong. They love you.

64
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,060
-So, where are you going this evening?
-I'm going to my sister's house in Jersey.

65
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,472
I thought of you more as
an Upper East Side girl.

66
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,508
Upper east side of Maine, actually.
I grew up on a farm.

67
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,147
Now, I'm having trouble believing that.

68
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:59,948
Hey, don't let the fancy clothes fool you.
I keep it real.

69
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:03,548
Is that what you call it? Keeping it real?

70
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,817
-Goodnight, Karl.
-Merry Christmas, Angela.

71
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,418
You too. I'll see you soon.

72
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,172
I promise you I'm leaving right now.

73
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,439
I know. I'm sorry, but I'm in the elevator.

74
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,508
Twenty-five minutes, tops.

75
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:33,077
I can't hear you. What?
Lorraine, you're breaking up.

76
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,482
Hello?

77
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,378
You have got to be kidding.

78
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,822
Come on.

79
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,327
Oh, God. What am I gonna do?

80
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,340
I'm getting out of the car
is what I'm gonna do.

81
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,031
Oh, shit.

82
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,081
Hello?

83
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,348
Jesus!

84
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,590
Rocky, what are you doing? Heel.

85
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,630
Stay. Down.

86
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,234
-Sorry about that.
-It's okay.

87
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,503
Look, can you unlock the door
to the elevator room?

88
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,871
My car won't start, and I need to
get upstairs and get a cab.

89
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:13,038
Yeah, I can.
I've just got to find my key cards.

90
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:17,716
Sorry. Where are those darn keys?
I'm about to do my rounds anyway, so...

91
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:20,379
-Okay, great.
-What happened to your car?

92
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,651
-I have no idea.
-You probably left the lights on.

93
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,591
I don't think so. I'm usually pretty good
about that kind of thing.

94
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:31,061
People do it all the time. It's instinctive.
You drive down here, it's dark... It happens.

95
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:33,123
Here we go.

96
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,259
-Great.
-You know, actually...

97
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:39,567
I have a charger in the back, so if it is
your battery probably you could use that.

98
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:44,501
Thank you, but... I really should
just take a cab. I'm so late as it is.

99
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:48,378
No, no. It would probably take longer
to get a cab. It's Christmas Eve.

100
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:52,308
So... I don't know. Up to you.
Whatever you want.

101
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,282
-How long will it take?
-Just a few minutes.

102
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,420
Now with beautiful Metropolitan
Opera House in the background,

103
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,331
let's check out
the temperatures in the Tri-State Area.

104
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:11,104
-Which way to your car?
-Over there.

105
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,331
Okay.

106
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,344
Working late, huh? I know how you feel.

107
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,906
These are pretty reliable cars
for the most part, right?

108
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,113
They're supposed to be.

109
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,584
All right. Positive...

110
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,354
Negative.

111
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,830
-All right, try it. Turn her over.
-Okay.

112
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,196
Strange.

113
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,897
Hang on. Can you turn your headlights on?

114
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,069
Weird. Try turning the keys again.

115
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,773
-Damn it.
-All right. I guess turn the headlights off.

116
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,178
You know what?

117
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,518
That's it.
You've been a great help, but I give up.

118
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,653
Sorry. I don't know what happened.
I thought I could do something.

119
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:13,258
You've been great. Could you just
let me in the elevator room now?

120
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,990
I was just trying to help.

121
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,570
I know. And I appreciate it. Thank you.

122
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,248
Hey, I know you're upset
about your car not starting, but...

123
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,319
It's the holidays. It's time to be thankful.

124
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,312
You know what? You're right.

125
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,982
-Yeah?
-I should be thankful.

126
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,397
I, uh...

127
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,798
I prepared
a small Christmas meal for myself.

128
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:55,335
You could join me if you want.

129
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,809
-I'm just kidding.
-Oh, sorry. I'm exhausted.

130
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,845
But thanks for your help.

131
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,817
You're welcome. Maybe some other time?

132
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:10,922
Sure.

133
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,020
All right.

134
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,190
Here you go. You sure
you don't want me to call you a cab?

135
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,527
-No. I've got a number in my bag.
-Suit yourself. Merry Christmas.

136
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,792
Merry Christmas.

137
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,211
Karl?

138
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,640
Hi. Can I get a car
at 2370 Park Avenue, please?

139
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,348
Are you sure? No, that's okay.
I'll wait. Thanks.

140
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:27,490
Lorraine, you won't believe what happened.
No, my car wouldn't start.

141
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:33,566
Just start without me, and I'll be there
within the hour and I'll make it up to them.

142
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,742
Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye.

143
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:37,260
Hello? Oh, great. Thank you!

144
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,337
Okay. Okay.

145
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,772
Oh, come on.

146
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,271
What?

147
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:57,521
This is not happening. Is this a joke?
God, no, you gotta be kidding me.

148
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,954
Karl? Where are you? Is anybody here?

149
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,928
Come on, come on, come on.

150
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,871
What?

151
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:20,006
One second, okay? I'll be right back.
Just one second.

152
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,130
Hello, can you hear me?

153
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:45,295
I've got a cab waiting for me.
Can you open the front gate, please?

154
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,265
Hello?

155
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,501
No... Wait!

156
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:57,116
No! Damn it!
Why would you leave me here?

157
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,585
Wake up! The cab just left.

158
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,243
Hey! I'm still in here! Wait!

159
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,492
Great.

160
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,771
It's okay.

161
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,283
Hello?

162
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,484
Stop being paranoid.

163
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,764
Go down to the office.

164
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,034
Hello?

165
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,916
Oh, fuck!

166
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,672
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
You've been a good little girl.

167
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:56,349
Wait. It's okay. You're all right. Okay?

168
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,651
All right?

169
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:04,360
You're not looking so good. Are you okay?
Take it easy. It's okay.

170
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:13,237
-What happened to me? What time is it?
-You just fell. You'll be all right.

171
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,901
I don't feel good. I'm going to be sick.

172
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:20,506
I'll get you some water.

173
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:27,213
Be careful! You're gonna hurt yourself.
Try to stay calm.

174
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,088
Okay.

175
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:37,123
It's okay. Here. Okay?

176
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,266
I'm going to help you up, okay?

177
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,969
Here we go.

178
00:21:47,674 --> 00:21:49,869
There you go. It's okay.

179
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,713
All right. Try to relax while I clean this up.

180
00:21:56,249 --> 00:21:57,409
Okay.

181
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:08,786
Clean this up. Okay.

182
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:19,394
All right. I'll be right back.

183
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,583
Hungry? I've got turkey,

184
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:42,556
mashed potatoes, cranberries,
and I've even got some cornbread.

185
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:50,433
Oh, man. I'm sorry about this.
I was just teasing.

186
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,462
I didn't mean to scare you.

187
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,202
I hope it's still warm.

188
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:05,678
If not, I have a microwave.

189
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,455
Are you feeling any better?

190
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,388
What happened to my clothes?

191
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:20,156
Like I said, you fell
and your clothes got dirty...

192
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:28,138
Maybe you'd like some wine.

193
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,909
Help you relax a little bit, you know?

194
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:35,379
I don't know what you're doing,
but you'd better just fucking untie me.

195
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,919
This is a California wine.

196
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:45,549
It's Sonoma County. That's where I'm from.

197
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,223
It's beautiful up there.

198
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,322
Where are you from?

199
00:23:57,237 --> 00:24:00,468
-What do you want?
-I want to know where you're from.

200
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,505
I'm from Readfield.

201
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:11,245
-Readfield. Where's that?
-Please, tell me what you want.

202
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:17,414
I just want to know where Readfield is.
And I want you to relax.

203
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:35,636
Cheers.

204
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,238
I'll make a toast.
Here's to good friends and hometowns

205
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,440
and Readfield. Wherever that is.

206
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,382
-Listen...
-Tom.

207
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,653
Tom.

208
00:24:56,396 --> 00:25:00,662
I have someplace to be. I have obligations.

209
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,863
Yeah. I know. Way too many.

210
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:09,802
You need time for yourself. You don't need
to be at everyone's beck and call.

211
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,571
Then maybe we should
get a drink in the new year.

212
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:23,817
I've already prepared everything.
It's all here.

213
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:26,591
I know, and it looks really good.

214
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:30,284
Yeah? Great. Well, let's eat.

215
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,096
I'm starving.

216
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:35,100
Tom, this is really sweet of you,
and I mean that.

217
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:37,659
But my whole family is expecting me.
I have plans.

218
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:39,932
I guess some plans are made to be broken.

219
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,974
Do you want to say grace or should I?

220
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:53,414
Hell, let's skip it.
I've never been religious anyway.

221
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,284
Bon appétit.

222
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,622
What do you like to do?

223
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,969
After work and stuff? I guess, hobbies.

224
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:15,903
That's a mundane question,
but I guess people ask that

225
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,375
just to get to know each other, right?

226
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:23,381
I read. Right now I'm reading Hemingway,
The Sun Also Rises.

227
00:26:24,484 --> 00:26:29,217
And you really should eat.
It's gonna get cold.

228
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:35,421
Anyway, in the book
this guy loves this girl so much

229
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:39,993
that he's willing to forgive
everything that she does.

230
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,234
Even her infidelities.

231
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,965
That's a pretty intense story, but...

232
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,902
That's what love is supposed to be, right?

233
00:26:56,282 --> 00:27:00,116
My boyfriend is gonna get worried
and come looking for me, Tom.

234
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,598
If I don't show up,
he'll come looking for me.

235
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,132
He knows where I work.

236
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:22,139
How long have you guys been
dating or hanging out?

237
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:25,509
-Two years.
-Two years?

238
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:31,677
-Do you live together?
-That's none of your fucking business.

239
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,051
That's not very nice dinner talk.

240
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,250
Yeah, we live together, okay?

241
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:46,496
Two years...

242
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:53,201
That's more than a boyfriend.
That sounds like wedding bells.

243
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:55,331
Do you have any plans?

244
00:27:56,275 --> 00:28:00,143
-Yes.
-What does your fiancé do?

245
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,642
He's a journalist.

246
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:06,446
I knew he had to be smart.
What kind of journalist?

247
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,919
-Sports.
-What paper?

248
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,122
-Post.
-I read The Post.

249
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,420
-What's his name?
-Mark Clayton.

250
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:17,554
Clayton. I don't remember that name.

251
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:24,661
-I have one over here.
-It's The Post online.

252
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,607
It's amazing

253
00:28:36,249 --> 00:28:39,912
that you're able to keep a relationship
with the amount of hours you work.

254
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:44,354
He must get really lonely
when you have to work late, right?

255
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,558
Do you love him?

256
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:51,554
Does he love you?

257
00:28:57,003 --> 00:29:01,531
I'm only asking because I'm worried about
how quickly he's going to get here.

258
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,507
I'm sure he's already on his way.

259
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:14,152
Right. He's probably
on the Harlem River Drive as we speak.

260
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,450
-What kind of car does he drive?
-I don't know.

261
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,683
You don't know what kind of car
your fiancé drives?

262
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:23,195
-Toyota, I think.
-Toyota. That is a fast car.

263
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:26,330
He can be here a lot sooner
than I was thinking.

264
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,924
He could be coming down
this ramp right now.

265
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:42,879
You haven't been very talkative
since we met.

266
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:49,579
But now you're telling me all about

267
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:54,317
your boyfriend. Oh, sorry, your fiancé.

268
00:29:56,062 --> 00:30:01,090
So either we've become best friends
over dinner or you're lying to me.

269
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:03,999
I'm guessing

270
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,594
you're lying to me.

271
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,541
You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?

272
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,105
But you want one.

273
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:21,583
You want somebody who cares about you...

274
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,918
-Worries about you...
-Please, don't.

275
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,326
You've got a great family.

276
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,322
You've got Lorraine.

277
00:30:35,735 --> 00:30:38,727
Jimmy and Rose. They love you.

278
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,967
They're probably getting worried about you.

279
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,202
Maybe we should give them a call. Yeah?

280
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,109
Tell them you're okay.

281
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,979
What do you think?

282
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:11,398
What should we say?

283
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:17,008
I know.
We should say you made other plans.

284
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:20,205
No. You probably already said that one.

285
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:23,675
You know what?
You should think of something.

286
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,541
You're a good liar.

287
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:29,653
Go ahead.

288
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,951
Go!

289
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,819
No.

290
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:51,270
Hello? Hello?

291
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:56,041
Hey, Rosie.
Can you get your mommy on the phone?

292
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:57,773
Who's calling, please?

293
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:02,181
-It's Auntie Angie.
-Mommy, it's Aunt Angie.

294
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,349
Give me a second, okay?
Hey, where are you?

295
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,020
-Angela?
-I'm not feeling well.

296
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:12,922
What do you mean?
We're all waiting for you.

297
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,689
She says she's not feeling well.

298
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:18,828
That's what she said the last time.
Can I talk to my sister, please?

299
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,268
Where are you, Angie?

300
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,307
She's got a real job. It's not like...

301
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,335
Angela?

302
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,445
I went home.

303
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:30,640
What's wrong? Where is she?

304
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:32,707
I don't understand.
Last time I talked to you,

305
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,583
you were on your way.
What about the costume?

306
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:38,680
Let's just eat.
You should know your sister by now.

307
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,252
It would be nice if you'd try

308
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,191
and put your family
ahead of your work sometimes.

309
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,125
That's enough. Give me the phone.

310
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,258
Angie, what's wrong?

311
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:50,861
Hello? I can't hear her.

312
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,828
Sweetie? Can you hear me?

313
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:58,066
-Hi, Mom. I'm here.
-Honey, what happened? Where are you?

314
00:32:59,245 --> 00:33:00,610
I don't know.

315
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,875
I think it's the flu.

316
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:08,010
You really sound terrible.
Are you sure you're okay?

317
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:13,387
Yeah. I just need some rest.

318
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,783
Okay.

319
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:19,797
Rest up and hopefully you'll
feel better for lunch tomorrow.

320
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,798
And don't worry about the costume, okay?

321
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:27,462
-Merry Christmas, angel. I love you.
-I love you too, Mom.

322
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:42,754
That was the best Christmas present
anyone's ever given me.

323
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,284
Thank you.

324
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:50,091
And now I have a present for you.

325
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:13,713
Go ahead.

326
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,279
Open it.

327
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,989
Aren't you even curious?

328
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,758
Open it.

329
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,500
Yes.

330
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,070
Bet you're curious now.

331
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:45,744
Okay. Enough torture.

332
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,819
Watch. It's all cued up.

333
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,591
-Why are you showing this to me?
-Wait.

334
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,888
You fucked up now, asshole.

335
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,298
Sorry you had to see that.

336
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:45,300
You want to go for a stroll?

337
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,411
These guys always do whatever they want.

338
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,255
Here we go.

339
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,131
Rocky, sit down!

340
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:24,245
Why did you do that?

341
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,755
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

342
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,950
-Let me help you up.
-Don't.

343
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:38,758
-Don't touch me!
-I'm not gonna hurt you. All right?

344
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:39,855
You're hurting my arm.

345
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,457
That's because you won't
relax your arms. Okay?

346
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,470
-Come on.
-Just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

347
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,942
Yeah, I believe you.
I just need to show you something.

348
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,853
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

349
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,226
Here we go.

350
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:30,846
Uh-oh.

351
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:34,284
I think I drank too much wine.

352
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,782
I really shouldn't be driving.

353
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,758
I'm just kidding.

354
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:50,132
You know, I've seen you drive
out of here so many times.

355
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,895
Strange being in the car with you.

356
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,364
It's great, actually.

357
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,835
-I thought you said we were taking a drive.
-We are.

358
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,905
Then why are we going down, Tom?

359
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,847
It's freezing out there.

360
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:10,080
Besides, this is gonna be much better.

361
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,397
Why are we down here, Thomas?

362
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,028
Tom?

363
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,315
Oh, my God, Tom.

364
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,223
What is this?

365
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,891
This is my present to you.

366
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:07,108
I want you to take this and show him.

367
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:10,938
Show him what?

368
00:39:12,151 --> 00:39:14,244
Show him you're not a slut.

369
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:18,579
Take this and teach him he can't be
touching every woman he wants.

370
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,886
Are you talking about
what happened in the elevator?

371
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:27,830
Oh, Tom, no. You don't understand.
That was a mistake.

372
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,827
A stupid mistake.

373
00:39:29,902 --> 00:39:32,370
-What? He tried to rape you.
-No.

374
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:36,541
He got a little out of hand at a party, Tom.
He hardly tried to rape me.

375
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:40,374
Look, he was drunk. He apologized.

376
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,573
Oh, he apologized.

377
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:46,751
You think you're the first woman
he tried to do this to?

378
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,343
I've seen him try to touch
every woman in the building.

379
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,822
-He's a pervert. A degenerate.
-No.

380
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:56,193
He's a good man, Tom.

381
00:39:56,628 --> 00:40:01,395
Look at him. He has a family.
He has a wife. Tom, please don't.

382
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,663
Tom, Tom...
Stop calling out my name, all right?

383
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,294
I know what you're trying to do.

384
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,896
You're trying to humanize yourself,
like you're some poor victim.

385
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:12,774
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you!
All right?

386
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,176
Stop calling out my name!
Enough's enough!

387
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,182
Tom, Tom, Tom!
How many times can you say it?

388
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,010
Okay.

389
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,429
I know you're a person, okay?

390
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,563
I'm a person, too.

391
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:38,435
I know you have feelings.
I have feelings, too.

392
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:42,072
I care about your feelings.

393
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:47,935
He's the one you should be scared of.
He's the one who has no feelings.

394
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:51,515
So if you want to help him,

395
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,145
take this and teach him a lesson.

396
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,953
I told you, he apologized.

397
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:08,531
What? He can just apologize
and then he can do it again?

398
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,465
And then he's just gonna
apologize again and then...

399
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,867
You've got to stop letting these assholes
have their way with you!

400
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:17,807
Tom, please believe me.
It was just a misunderstanding, Tom.

401
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:22,370
Tom, Tom!
Just stop calling out my name! I told you!

402
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:26,307
-Didn't I?
-Yes! Yes.

403
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:31,446
-I'm sorry, but you're scaring me.
-Jesus! When are you gonna understand?

404
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:36,851
I'm here to help you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

405
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:51,839
Okay.

406
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:56,942
I'll do it.

407
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,118
You untie me and I'll do it.

408
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:11,262
No. Oh, no. Whoa.

409
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,956
You're a good person.

410
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:16,263
You're a good person, too.

411
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:19,099
I should have never asked
you to do this. I'm sorry.

412
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:24,131
No. It's okay because I want to.

413
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:28,942
You just have to untie me
and I'll do it for you.

414
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,682
No, no. It's my job to protect you.

415
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,628
No, Tom, listen to me. It's not.
Please don't do anything.

416
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,756
Don't try to run away, okay?

417
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,231
Can I trust you?

418
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,298
-Can I trust you?
-Yes.

419
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,135
You can trust me.

420
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:04,843
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry.

421
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,245
So...

422
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,787
You like to touch girls, do you?

423
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:16,359
No? Look at her.

424
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,856
I said look at her.

425
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,827
Does she look happy to you? Huh?

426
00:43:27,406 --> 00:43:28,498
Yeah.

427
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,769
You messed with the wrong girl.

428
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,775
What makes you think
you deserve her? Huh?

429
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,144
What gives you the right?

430
00:43:40,352 --> 00:43:42,684
You're something else, you know that?

431
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:47,350
You pretentious Ivy League piece of shit.

432
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:51,018
You don't own the world and everyone in it.

433
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:54,590
What is a guy like you thinking
when he puts his hands all over a girl

434
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:58,727
who obviously is not interested?
Who is obviously not a slut?

435
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,032
Because that's what
you think they are, right?

436
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:06,805
Yeah? I can't hear you. What did you say?

437
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,676
What? Can you speak up?

438
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:13,479
Because you can't talk your way
out of this one, can you?

439
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:18,278
-Why am I even wasting my time with you?
No!

440
00:44:18,957 --> 00:44:23,155
-What? Angela, he deserves it!
-Don't do anything, Thomas, please!

441
00:44:39,678 --> 00:44:40,736
No!

442
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:45,280
Stop it! Stop it!

443
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,530
Way to ruin Christmas, asshole.

444
00:45:22,787 --> 00:45:25,779
Well, he won't be bothering you again.

445
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:27,820
Where are we going?

446
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:31,685
We can't just leave him here.
You have to get him.

447
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,954
What? Why are you defending him?

448
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,499
I'm not. I'm not.

449
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:39,162
Do you like this?
Do you like to get touched?

450
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,262
You like it when he touches you
in the parking garage?

451
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:43,933
-Do you want to get laid here?
-You know that's not true.

452
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:47,445
So what is it? A career thing?

453
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,213
Did you fuck him to get a promotion?

454
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,343
We can't leave him here.

455
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,882
You're right. I'm sorry.

456
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:04,553
We shouldn't leave him here.

457
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:08,130
Wait! Thomas, stop!

458
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:16,164
-What are you doing?
-We're gonna just take him for a little drive.

459
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:20,807
What are you doing?
Tom, stop the car! Please!

460
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,107
Please stop! Please!

461
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:27,683
Stop it! What are you doing, Tom? No!

462
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:32,050
No! No!

463
00:46:33,592 --> 00:46:35,651
Oh, my God!

464
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:42,297
No, please! Oh, my God! Don't do this.

465
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:45,502
Please don't! No!

466
00:46:53,345 --> 00:46:54,972
Thomas, no.

467
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:58,413
You're a good person, Thomas.
Please don't do this.

468
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:05,019
No! God, no! Stop it!

469
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,222
Hey! Hey!

470
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:14,323
Where are you going?

471
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:19,836
Angela! Come back!

472
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:23,440
You fucked him, didn't you? Liar!

473
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:52,701
Hey! Down here!

474
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,166
Can you hear me? Help!

475
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,113
Down here! Can't you hear me?

476
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:35,866
Good boy.

477
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:52,618
Sit. Good boy.

478
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:57,522
Stay right there, Rocky.

479
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,582
Stay there.

480
00:50:56,521 --> 00:51:00,082
Help me! Help me, please!

481
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:08,999
Help me, please!
Someone's trying to kill me! Help me!

482
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,401
Help me!

483
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:16,972
Somebody's trying to kill me!

484
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,334
Oh, Karl. Where are you?

485
00:51:21,713 --> 00:51:22,805
Oh, my God.

486
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:25,006
Angela?

487
00:52:26,044 --> 00:52:28,478
Please.
If anyone can hear me...

488
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,341
I'm trapped in the underground parking
structure of the Arcadia Building.

489
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:34,908
It's 2370 Park Avenue.

490
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:36,513
Someone's trying to kill me.

491
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:37,884
Angela.

492
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:41,949
Angela, come out.

493
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,292
Shit.

494
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:46,360
Angela?

495
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:52,330
Can we talk about this?

496
00:52:58,076 --> 00:53:01,011
Looks like somebody's
playing games, huh, Rocky?

497
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:10,715
Angela?

498
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,513
Come on.

499
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:24,092
Come on. Lobby.
Come on. Lobby. Come on.

500
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:26,260
Why is it fucking locked?

501
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:31,494
Angela!

502
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:39,904
Hello?

503
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:44,808
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

504
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,873
Please, hello?

505
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:17,676
Answer, please?

506
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,916
Yes?
Five Brothers Security here. Hello?

507
00:55:24,856 --> 00:55:27,791
Yes. I'm here. Can you hear me?

508
00:55:28,126 --> 00:55:30,458
I can hear you fine. How can I help you?

509
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:33,986
I'm being kidnapped.
I work at Brieter, Smith and Steinberg.

510
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:35,726
It's 2370 Park Avenue

511
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,132
and I'm hiding in the elevator.
Please can you call 911?

512
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:41,433
Calm down, miss.
Is there someone with you right now?

513
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:45,867
No, he's outside in the parking lot.
He already killed someone else.

514
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,405
Did you see him do it?

515
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:50,811
Yes! His name is Thomas and he's
the parking attendant in my building.

516
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:53,112
If you'll just please hurry. I'm in danger.

517
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:56,210
Ma'am, you have got to relax
and take a deep breath.

518
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,585
How do you fucking expect me to relax?
This man is trying to kill me!

519
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,023
Can you please try to understand
and call the cops?

520
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,119
Please just call 911!

521
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,393
The police?

522
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,960
No. I'm sure he's just trying to help you.

523
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,500
Right?

524
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:19,968
Angela?

525
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:24,144
Are you still there?

526
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:29,346
Listen you fuck-face, I called the cops
and I'm gonna stay down here

527
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,356
as long as it takes until they get here,
so I suggest that you get the fuck out!

528
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,953
I just wanna talk to you.

529
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,290
That's why I pretended to be
someone else, okay? So don't be upset.

530
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:44,092
Will you come out? I was just kidding.

531
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:45,760
Just go to hell!

532
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:51,572
Don't you understand? I did it for you.
That guy showed you no respect.

533
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,439
Why won't you talk to me, Angela?

534
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,876
Just give me a chance.

535
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:05,822
If you just give us a chance,
it can work out.

536
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:08,624
You'll grow to like me.

537
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,258
That's usually what happens
when two people

538
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:14,696
are forced to be together
in a stressful situation.

539
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:19,361
They have to depend on one another.
And eventually they support each other.

540
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:23,371
They like each other.
Sometimes they even fall in love.

541
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:28,272
Angela.

542
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:32,874
Please don't do this.

543
00:57:36,087 --> 00:57:38,021
Why won't you talk to me?

544
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:45,953
You know, I wish you had just
a little bit more respect for yourself.

545
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:30,193
I'm not coming out! Do you hear me?

546
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:34,433
I'm not fucking moving, you fuck!

547
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:32,289
Karl! Oh, no, please.

548
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:57,749
Karl!

549
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,616
Come on, Karl!

550
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:34,886
Angela?

551
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:41,662
You must be freezing out here.

552
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,127
Angela.

553
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,379
What a mess.

554
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:04,814
Angela.

555
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:08,922
I think Karl is hurt.

556
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:14,727
Angela? Should we call him an ambulance?

557
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:22,570
That way he can go back to his kids
and family, and you can go to your sister's.

558
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,398
And I could stay here! In this parking lot!

559
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,704
All by myself!

560
01:02:29,013 --> 01:02:32,039
Because that's obviously
what everybody wants!

561
01:02:36,554 --> 01:02:37,748
Angela?

562
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:47,655
I just can't keep
chasing you around all night.

563
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:53,126
Besides, the whole place is locked.

564
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:58,472
Angela?

565
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:02,408
Where are you gonna go if you get away?

566
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,045
It's freezing out there.

567
01:03:07,585 --> 01:03:09,212
You can't go out.

568
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,085
Angela?

569
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,282
Angela!

570
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,159
Angela?

571
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:35,543
Way to ruin Christmas, Karl.

572
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:09,775
I'll have a blue

573
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:15,241
Christmas without you

574
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:21,214
I'll be so blue

575
01:04:21,592 --> 01:04:26,256
Just thinking about you

576
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:33,263
Decorations of red

577
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:37,797
On a green Christmas tree

578
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,507
Won't be the same, dear

579
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:47,912
If you're not here with me

580
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:51,985
And when those blue

581
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:56,920
Snowflakes start falling

582
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:01,828
That's when those blue

583
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:06,759
Memories start calling

584
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:13,704
You'll be doing all right

585
01:05:14,712 --> 01:05:18,808
With your Christmas of white

586
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:24,077
But I'll have a blue

587
01:05:24,455 --> 01:05:27,447
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

588
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,780
You'll be doing all right

589
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:58,585
With your Christmas of white

590
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:03,890
But I'll have a blue

591
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,058
Blue, blue, blue Christmas

592
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:11,657
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

593
01:06:18,776 --> 01:06:20,300
Oh, yeah.

594
01:07:07,958 --> 01:07:09,983
Do you want makeup?

595
01:07:11,628 --> 01:07:13,118
Okay.

596
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:19,362
You have the most beautiful lips

597
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,439
I have ever seen in my life.

598
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:26,735
You're beautiful.

599
01:07:28,979 --> 01:07:31,675
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

600
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,513
You have a wonderful body.

601
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:46,325
It was meant to be, babe.

602
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,164
Me and you.

603
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:54,099
Your skin...

604
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:58,807
It's soft.

605
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:02,405
Honey.

606
01:08:03,947 --> 01:08:08,213
I love you. Angela, you know that, right?

607
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:29,298
Hello?

608
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:30,762
Shit.

609
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:33,537
I'm down here. Hello? Can you hear me?

610
01:08:39,483 --> 01:08:40,643
It's okay.

611
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,303
Hello, Officer. Can I help you?

612
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:12,645
Can you open up the gate, please?

613
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:16,746
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

614
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:25,027
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

615
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:53,415
Hey.

616
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:58,256
Sorry about that.
I was on the bottom floor doing my rounds.

617
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:05,428
What's going on tonight?

618
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:09,734
We got a call about a disturbance
at this address. Know anything about that?

619
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,274
No, it's been real quiet all night.

620
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:14,636
See anything, hear anything suspicious?

621
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:19,077
Like I said, I was just doing my rounds.

622
01:10:20,017 --> 01:10:22,383
It's been really quiet.
I haven't seen anybody down here.

623
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:23,817
Any cars in there?

624
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,647
Well, it is a parking garage.

625
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:32,628
There's a few cars scattered
over here in this level.

626
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:35,392
On the second level there's a rental thing.

627
01:10:35,999 --> 01:10:39,628
Like I said, there's been no one
around tonight. Except me and Rocky.

628
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:41,603
Two of you working here tonight.

629
01:10:41,705 --> 01:10:45,801
Kind of. He's my dog.
He's down in the office right now.

630
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:49,576
We're gonna take a look around.
Get in the back. We'll give you a ride.

631
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:50,943
That's a great idea.

632
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:57,050
I've just gotta close this gate.
A lot of homeless people around here.

633
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:41,553
Thanks for the ride.

634
01:11:42,065 --> 01:11:45,398
If you guys wanna
check out the other floors,

635
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:47,130
just keep going around this way.

636
01:11:47,204 --> 01:11:50,002
But be careful on P3.
There's a broken water main, okay?

637
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:52,337
-We'll come back around.
-Okay.

638
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:03,035
What the hell's going on here, man?

639
01:13:48,325 --> 01:13:51,192
Help me! Help!

640
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,412
Help me! Help!

641
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:35,768
Help me!

642
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:40,235
Sure you haven't seen
anything weird tonight?

643
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:43,507
No. Everybody left really early tonight.

644
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,011
You having a party in here?

645
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:48,676
No, no. It's just me and Rocky, not a party.

646
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:56,789
Got anybody coming over to visit?
You know, a little action?

647
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:00,421
Me? No. The company would fire me
if I had anyone down here tonight.

648
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:03,196
Especially at this hour.

649
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:06,565
Well, we don't want to break any rules.
Right, partner?

650
01:15:07,137 --> 01:15:08,798
Not on my watch.

651
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:11,429
Come on, let's go.

652
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:16,244
Help me!

653
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:19,546
Help me!

654
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:23,116
I've got to open the gate,
so I'll just take the stairs.

655
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:24,881
Let's do it.

656
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:46,270
Open.

657
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:05,185
Wait!

658
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:16,237
You guys stay warm.

659
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:20,005
-You keep your eyes and ears open, huh?
-You bet.

660
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:27,348
-Merry Christmas.
-You too, buddy.

661
01:16:35,024 --> 01:16:37,754
Wait! Wait!

662
01:19:44,681 --> 01:19:45,909
911.

663
01:19:45,982 --> 01:19:48,382
-Yes, please, I need your help.
-All our lines are busy at the moment.

664
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:49,440
Please hold.

665
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:51,646
-Someone will be with you shortly.
-Hello?

666
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:53,052
Thank you.

667
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,814
All our lines are busy at the moment.
Please hold.

668
01:20:31,894 --> 01:20:34,920
911. All our lines are busy at the moment.

669
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:45,435
Rock? Rocky!

670
01:20:57,854 --> 01:21:01,290
Why would you do that?

671
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,090
He's just an animal.

672
01:21:09,132 --> 01:21:10,463
Angela!

673
01:21:11,401 --> 01:21:14,131
Why would you kill a defenseless animal?

674
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:29,716
After all I did for you? To help you?

675
01:21:31,521 --> 01:21:33,216
This is what I get?

676
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:36,691
You killed my dog!

677
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:39,995
Answer. Please answer.

678
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:41,523
Angela?

679
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:45,957
You're really starting to piss me off!

680
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:47,362
Angela!

681
01:22:36,853 --> 01:22:39,151
Hello? Are you there?

682
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,515
Hello? This is the police.
Is somebody there?

683
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:47,953
Is this an emergency?
If you can hear me, please say something.

684
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:51,830
Tap the phone, let me know
if you're there. Hello?

685
01:22:52,935 --> 01:22:58,305
This is the police. This is 911.
Are you okay? Are you there? Hello?

686
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,045
You're trying to get me fired, aren't you?

687
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:11,043
Bet you'd really like that.

688
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:27,328
But, honey...

689
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:31,504
What are we gonna do then?

690
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:35,270
We couldn't just live off of your salary.

691
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:14,269
Angela!

692
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:18,841
Angela!

693
01:25:23,753 --> 01:25:24,947
Angela!

694
01:25:52,949 --> 01:25:54,644
Shit!

695
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:48,695
Shit!

696
01:27:59,075 --> 01:28:02,704
Let's fucking do this.
You want to fuck with me?

697
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:07,210
Come on!

698
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:19,226
Come on, you chicken shit!

699
01:29:33,936 --> 01:29:35,130
Angela?

700
01:29:37,940 --> 01:29:39,498
Let me help you out, okay?

701
01:29:54,423 --> 01:29:56,152
Help me? You're gonna help me?

702
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:59,956
Why don't you let me help you,
for a change? Motherfucker!

703
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,051
What the fuck are you doing, Angela?

704
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:37,923
Come back here, now! Let me go!

705
01:30:39,235 --> 01:30:42,329
Come over here
and get me out of this right now!

706
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:46,371
Why are you doing this, Angela?

707
01:30:48,344 --> 01:30:49,538
Angela.

708
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:55,607
Angela? I just wanted us to be friends.

709
01:30:57,786 --> 01:30:59,549
I'm alone.

710
01:31:00,055 --> 01:31:02,615
I'm always alone.

711
01:31:05,894 --> 01:31:08,590
Why can't we just
spend more time together?

712
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:13,693
Angela? Wait.

713
01:31:14,837 --> 01:31:16,168
Why?

714
01:31:17,273 --> 01:31:19,434
Why can't we be friends?

715
01:31:19,975 --> 01:31:23,877
Why can't we just
spend Christmas together?

716
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:27,844
Do you hear me? You stupid, fucking cunt!

717
01:31:40,863 --> 01:31:42,854
Angela, wait. I didn't...

718
01:31:43,599 --> 01:31:45,328
Merry Christmas, Thomas.

719
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:52,406
No! No! No!

720
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:55,034
No! No!

721
01:33:53,162 --> 01:33:54,857
You all right, lady?
