2
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,770
Get out of the way!

3
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,436
This way!

4
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,654
Saint Luke's Hospital.
I repeat, Saint Luke's Hospital.

5
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:49,792
Does anything hurt?

6
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,690
Sweetheart, is your mommy here?

7
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,454
Do you know where she is?

8
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:06,537
Really, I'm just... No.

9
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,734
Don't come over.

10
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,979
No. No, I swear
I wasn't just seeing things.

11
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:17,047
I mean, it could have just been a prank.

12
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,322
I don't know who.

13
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:25,259
No, really, I'm just gonna see you
at school tomorrow.

14
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:28,890
Thanks, Leann.

15
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,064
Bye.

16
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,095
Luna?

17
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:12,905
Luna?

18
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:32,678
Come on.
Over here.

19
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:35,647
Beth's a little too sane for me,
but she does throw a good party.

20
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,548
Yeah, so now I'm having sex
and phone sex at the same time.

21
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,518
Oh, man. Are you serious?

22
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:47,418
I know, but he was just so handsome.

23
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,758
And I was so nervous, you know?

24
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,424
<i>And I'm trying to describe
the plot of Beloved to him...</i>

25
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,161
...and I just started crying.

26
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:58,603
It was a perfect year, wasn't it?
I loved it.

27
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:05,443
Brian, could you get your eyes off Taylor
for two seconds and help me with this?

28
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,880
Unbelievable.

29
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:14,352
And before the sheets are even cold.
No wonder why Leann moved out.

30
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:18,426
I am a man. I have needs.
Is that a problem for you?

31
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:22,395
No. But it might be a problem for Taylor.

32
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:25,056
Hot. Yes, well...

33
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,431
...we can't force Taylor
to have good taste, now can we?

34
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:31,166
Just keep chopping.

35
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,742
I'll keep chopping.

36
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:44,184
You know, I can hear you analyzing me in
your head. You might as well do it out loud.

37
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,151
Okay, I think that
you're still messed up over Leann.

38
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,121
You think if you flirt with Taylor...

39
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:53,228
...maybe Leann'll get jealous
and come back to you.

40
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:57,224
Go back to analyzing me in your head.
I think I like that better.

41
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,933
Hey, did someone lock the door?

42
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,067
- Hey, Leann. Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:35,295
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

44
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:38,668
- Me too.
- Is... Is Brian home?

45
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:41,776
Yeah, he's in the kitchen,
so we should go upstairs.

46
00:07:45,748 --> 00:07:47,648
How you doing?

47
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,982
Oh. Oh.

48
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:56,757
Hey, it's Leann.

49
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:58,257
Bye.

50
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:06,529
Okay. Just leave the alarm off. Thanks.

51
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:14,834
Hey.

52
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,909
How was it?

53
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,215
It was a funeral. It sucked.

54
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,850
From now on, I only go to parties
where no one gets cremated.

55
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,090
How are Shelley's parents?

56
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,855
Considering their 24-year-old daughter
drowned in the backyard pond...

57
00:08:35,197 --> 00:08:36,289
...they're great.

58
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,093
And you?

59
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:42,698
I knew Shelley.
We interned at Saint Luke's together.

60
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,806
I mean, she was not crazy.

61
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:48,034
I know, but the way she was
talking at the end was pretty...

62
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,269
Yeah, that doesn't mean
she killed herself.

63
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,649
That's not my ringtone.

64
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,059
It says it's from Shelley.

65
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,163
Who'd be calling from Shelley's phone?

66
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,230
That's creepy.

67
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,439
It's dated Monday, 10:17 p. m.

68
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,846
It's Friday. Maybe you just
set the date wrong.

69
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,397
Leann, what is it?

70
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:45,190
Leann?

71
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:56,008
<i>If you'd like to hear this message again...</i>

72
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,611
<i>...press one.</i>

73
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:03,883
<i>Voice call received Monday,
June 12th, 10: 17 p. m.</i>

74
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:08,012
<i>I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.</i>

75
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,320
<i>It's like every time I
turn around, they're...</i>

76
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:17,662
<i>No! Aaah!</i>

77
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,330
That's your voice.

78
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,306
That's you.

79
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:36,208
<i>Yeah?
Yeah.</i>

80
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,409
<i>Cut me a break, man.</i>

81
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:40,316
<i>No, man, you know what the price is.
You gotta hit it right.</i>

82
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:41,854
<i>All right. Give me that.</i>

83
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,651
<i>All right, slow down, homie.</i>

84
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,326
Okay?

85
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,059
Yeah. They're real nice.

86
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,071
Detective Andrews. Yeah.

87
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:02,539
<i>A group of hikers found her.</i>

88
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:07,375
We held off on the autopsy
until you got here, detective.

89
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,580
Even so, your sister was out
there for more than a week.

90
00:11:14,123 --> 00:11:17,058
There's really no need for you to do this.

91
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:47,485
Whew.

92
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,869
Oh, jeez.

93
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,839
In cases of severe and repeated
childhood abuse...

94
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:49,282
...the posttraumatic-stress model
may be valid.

95
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:52,978
Long-term effects may include
sexual dysfunction, amnesia...

96
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:58,718
...dissociation, even hallucinations
and multiple personalities.

97
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,052
The post-trauma child...

98
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,290
...faces formidable developmental tasks...

99
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:09,096
...and among these what we call
"dissociative virtuosity. "

100
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:15,801
The post-trauma child
will form primary attachments...

101
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:18,105
...to develop a sense of basic trust...

102
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,808
...and to preserve a sense
of hope and meaning in life.

103
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,220
The child will, from this experience,
attempt to...

104
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,520
...construct an explanation
of what's happened.

105
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:38,692
And these explanations may excuse
the parental negligence or abuse.

106
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:42,826
The child may blame themselves
for what has happened.

107
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,968
Look, if you come over
earlier then we can study some more.

108
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:54,581
Leann!

109
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,844
Hey. Do you wanna
go get some coffee?

110
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,420
No. No. I've...

111
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:05,091
...gotta get to the library.
Paper's due next week.

112
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:08,189
Are you okay?
You seem kind of weirded-out.

113
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,123
I haven't been sleeping too well.

114
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,135
Call me tonight.
I'll read you my paper...

115
00:14:14,303 --> 00:14:18,137
...on developmental perspectives
in abuse cases. It's better than Ambien.

116
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:23,137
Okay. Bye.

117
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,108
Bye.

118
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:35,782
<i>The library will be closing in five minutes.</i>

119
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:23,631
- Hey, Lee.
- Hey.

120
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:25,239
Hey, what's up?

121
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:28,467
Oh, I'm just finishing up this paper.
What are you doing?

122
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:35,077
I just got sprung from the stacks.
My brain was mushing out.

123
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,047
<i>Oh, God, I know what you mean.</i>

124
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,661
<i>Leann?</i>

125
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,296
<i>Leann? Hello?</i>

126
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:55,733
Listen, Beth, I didn't mean to ditch you
after class today. I...

127
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,481
<i>Leann, are you still there?</i>

128
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:12,582
I don't know how to explain it.
L... I've been...

129
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,852
<i>- I've been having some problems.
- What kind of problems?</i>

130
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,461
Ever since I...

131
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:23,893
Well, I don't know.

132
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:28,427
I mean, Shelley drowned,
and that was my voice screaming.

133
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:34,836
And then that bizarre phone call,
and it was dated today.

134
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,240
10:17 p. m.

135
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,278
- I don't...
- Where are you?

136
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:49,390
I'm at the overpass on College.

137
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,052
That's two minutes away.
I'll be right there.

138
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:57,756
I keep seeing things. I mean,
weird people looking at me.

139
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,858
<i>- Leann?
- I'm sorry.</i>

140
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,299
I didn't mean to panic. I've just...

141
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:05,372
I've been seeing
some really strange stuff.

142
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,575
I don't know,
it's the weirdest, weirdest thing.

143
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:13,442
<i>Every time I turn around, they're...</i>

144
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,317
Leann!

145
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,296
- No! No!
- Leann!

146
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:20,644
Didn't see anything?
Like I said, she threw herself off.

147
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,210
Please, can we go?
This is taking so long.

148
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:26,320
You're gonna have to stay here
until I get all the information.

149
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,319
I need you to sign this statement.

150
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,759
- Hey.
- Hey.

151
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,234
And then she got this strange phone call.

152
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,700
It's hard to believe.

153
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,534
Yeah, Leann told me the same thing
happened to Shelley before she drowned.

154
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,369
- That is so eerie.
Taylor.

155
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:53,308
What? I'm just saying what Leann said.

156
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,973
Yeah, well, maybe this isn't the time,
all right?

157
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,480
I heard Shelley got a phone call
from an old advisor of hers.

158
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:03,819
I heard that too. Only it turned out
the advisor was already dead.

159
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,721
Would you stop it?

160
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:08,929
Her parents are right in the other room.

161
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:16,702
It's like dead people call you,
but it's your own voice.

162
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,567
And then you die too.

163
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:21,100
Shit, Taylor, know what?

164
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:24,677
Don't try to think, all right?
It just makes you look ridiculous.

165
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,284
I heard it too.

166
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:34,046
That's it. Now I'm really creeped out.

167
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:37,851
It's shit, all right? It's total bullshit.

168
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,002
Brian! Brian!

169
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:55,336
What's his problem?

170
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,938
He had a thing for Leann.

171
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,606
Brian.

172
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,185
Are you okay?

173
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:38,979
What was that back there?

174
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:55,469
<i>To listen to your messages, press one.</i>

175
00:20:56,438 --> 00:20:59,874
<i>Voice call received
Wednesday, June 14th...</i>

176
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,875
<i>...12:02 p. m.</i>

177
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:05,605
<i>Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...</i>

178
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:15,954
The call came in two nights ago.
From Leann's phone.

179
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:19,958
- That was the night that she died.
- Only the call was dated Wednesday.

180
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:23,791
Today. 12:02 p. m.

181
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,900
I don't believe in magic, Beth.

182
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,003
I don't believe in anything. But ever since
I got that phone call, things have been...

183
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,310
...weird.
- Like what?

184
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:41,448
No, Brian, you have to tell me.

185
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:44,983
That's the exact same thing
that Leann told me right before she...

186
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,250
Brian?

187
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,884
What's wrong? Brian?

188
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:01,128
Look...

189
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,167
- What's...?
- Forget about it, okay?

190
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:06,203
- No, Brian, don't!
- These things work...

191
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:10,037
...because they get in your head, Beth.
You're the psych lady, you know that.

192
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,043
If you don't think about it,
it can't hurt you.

193
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,321
Like I said.

194
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:41,373
Brian, your phone!

195
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,477
You forgot your phone.

196
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,275
Damn it, I forgot. I swear if I
didn't have my head screwed on...

197
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,406
Let's go over this again.

198
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:17,978
Welder's acetylene tank exploded.
Your friend happened to be in the way.

199
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,842
Okay. And what about
Leann and the voice mails?

200
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:24,315
We checked on that. There were no
voice mails on your friends' phones.

201
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,387
- Either of them.
- But I heard them. Okay?

202
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:31,458
Leann got a phone call, and so did Brian,
right before they died.

203
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,319
Both of them did.

204
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,829
I hear it happened to Shelley too,
Shelley Baum, right before she died.

205
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,592
Well, thank you, Miss Raymond.

206
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:45,001
We'll check on that, and we'll contact you
if we need anything else.

207
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,473
What about the hard candies?

208
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:54,376
Both of these kids were eating them.
My sister too.

209
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:57,109
Three people eating hard candy
in two weeks?

210
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:00,880
The girl's right, Mickey. There's gotta be
some kind of connection here.

211
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:04,048
You know,
I'm really sorry about your sister.

212
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:06,490
But if it was my sister...

213
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:11,858
...I'd take some personal time,
just till I was thinking right again.

214
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:18,299
Excuse me, Miss Raymond?

215
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:22,205
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

216
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,073
I'm Detective Jack Andrews. I heard
what you were saying...

217
00:24:25,247 --> 00:24:27,613
...and, well, Detective Lee's a good cop...

218
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:30,216
...but she's a little short
on imagination, you know?

219
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,320
- What are you saying?
- I don't really know.

220
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:37,549
Except Shelley Baum interned
with my sister at Saint Luke's.

221
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,423
My sister Jean, she died in a fall
two days before Shelley drowned.

222
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:44,224
Oh, I'm sorry.
But then, you see what I'm saying.

223
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,095
Everybody seems to be
linked together somehow.

224
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:49,999
Something doesn't make sense here so...

225
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:53,705
...if you can think of anything else,
give me a call.

226
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:09,473
You didn't get a call, did you?

227
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:14,754
But my number was in Brian's cell.

228
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:19,557
I'm gonna be next.

229
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,887
I can feel it.

230
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:25,123
No, you don't know that, okay?

231
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,667
Because my number is in Brian's cell too.
Here.

232
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:35,205
No power, no problem.

233
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:39,476
Any dead people call...

234
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,313
...we're not home.

235
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:22,952
- Which one is it?
- Uh!

236
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:35,560
Who?

237
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:57,220
Oh, God.

238
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,289
Oh, God.

239
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,895
This can't be happening.

240
00:28:12,674 --> 00:28:15,142
There are no batteries.

241
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,576
It says 8:32 p. m. On Friday.

242
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:25,311
That's two days from now.

243
00:28:39,534 --> 00:28:41,764
Everything I'm seeing is there. It's real.

244
00:28:41,936 --> 00:28:43,631
I'm seeing it and it's happening...

245
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:49,734
I do not. Okay?

246
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,415
Okay, you wanna delete it? Do it yourself.

247
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,280
Look, I'm... I'm sure you'll be fine.

248
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,760
I wanna do mine.
- You wanna do it too? Go ahead.

249
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,424
Go on, you can all do it.

250
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:14,467
There you go.

251
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:16,836
- That's a...
- Wait.

252
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,669
Sorry, ladies.
It just doesn't work that way.

253
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,508
Right. You're telling me
that we can't cancel the service?

254
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,116
You don't have to cancel.
Just use up your minutes.

255
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:33,721
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We don't wanna use this phone at all.

256
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:37,688
Well, the phone is yours, so you
can do whatever you want with it.

257
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,518
Miss Anthony?

258
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,318
- Taylor Anthony?
- Yeah.

259
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:13,289
Ted Summers.

260
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:18,023
<i>I'm a television producer. I work
on the program American Miracles.</i>

261
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,530
Oh, I've heard of that.

262
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,232
Yeah.

263
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,495
Some students called us
about what happened...

264
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,639
...and they told us
all about your problem.

265
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:30,141
- Can we help you with something? We're...
- We were very moved by your story, Taylor.

266
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:33,769
- We think we might be able to help you.
- How?

267
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:38,612
About five years ago,
my son suffered a possession.

268
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:45,456
Yeah. It was pretty devastating
for the whole family.

269
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:49,358
So when I created my show,
I wanted to make it a point...

270
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,363
...to build an extensive resource
of people who were able...

271
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:57,061
...to deal successfully
with those evil influences like that.

272
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,570
What do you mean,
like, you do exorcisms?

273
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:03,609
- I think this is nonsense.
- Do you have the telephone on you, Taylor?

274
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:07,544
- What? No, we threw it away.
- Do you have the phone?

275
00:31:07,715 --> 00:31:11,412
Well, it would really be helpful.
Here. Here.

276
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,816
Now, you show me...

277
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:16,422
...exactly what happened
when the phone call came in.

278
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:18,218
Okay, come here. Nope, nope.

279
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:20,918
Thank you very much.
This is ridiculous. Thank you.

280
00:31:21,095 --> 00:31:23,222
- We don't need a reality show.
- I understand...

281
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,263
...you wanna protect your friend.
- I do.

282
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:26,491
- I admire that.
- Thank you.

283
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:41,607
- Come on, let's go.
- Jesus.

284
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,744
Come on, come on.

285
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,621
Wait, we could s...

286
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,082
Hey, maybe he could help me, Beth.

287
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,424
No, Taylor, you don't need an exorcism.
Okay?

288
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:59,327
That guy was so full of it.

289
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,413
Andrews.

290
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:48,168
Miss Raymond, it is not your
imagination. The phone calls happened.

291
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:51,038
The other detective said
nobody could find the voice mails.

292
00:33:51,212 --> 00:33:54,511
Because the other detective
didn't bother to check the phone records.

293
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:56,547
I did, and it's all right there.

294
00:33:56,717 --> 00:34:01,279
Brian was called by Leann, Leann
was called by Shelley, and Shelley...

295
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:03,480
...was called from my sister.

296
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,424
All right? And all the calls came in
after the caller was already dead.

297
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:09,392
Right. Who called your sister?

298
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:12,897
If we could trace it to the source
and find out who started this, then...

299
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:15,729
I was up all night tracking it.
I'm gonna go see her now.

300
00:34:15,903 --> 00:34:17,495
- I'll give you a call. Okay?
- Okay.

301
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:20,004
- I'm gonna come with you.
- That's not a good idea.

302
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:24,873
Yeah, it is, because these are my friends
and there's no way I'm gonna sit here.

303
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:30,212
The call my sister got
came from a nurse at an old-age home.

304
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:31,817
A woman named Marie Layton.

305
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,889
It's right up here on the right.

306
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,798
I wouldn't hold my breath.

307
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:55,534
Nobody's been in there for
more than two weeks now, not a soul.

308
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,701
Okay. Thank you very much.

309
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,217
You know, I'm gonna go get the super.

310
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,026
That could take hours.
Why don't you just break in?

311
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:17,825
I'm a cop.

312
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,633
I'm not.

313
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,730
All right, give it a shot.

314
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,740
Okay.

315
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,517
I was getting it.

316
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:12,645
Well, whoever Marie Layton is,
she's a hell of a housekeeper, huh?

317
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:28,696
<i>We're not... We're not...
We're not... We're not...</i>

318
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,448
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

319
00:38:33,194 --> 00:38:35,389
I found this in the living room.

320
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,463
It must be one of those nanny cams.

321
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:42,427
To keep an eye on the children.

322
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:53,240
Okay, so judging from the angle, the
camera would have been right here.

323
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,649
So where did it go?

324
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,966
Beth.

325
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:26,477
Look, if you don't talk to me,
I can't help you.

326
00:39:26,647 --> 00:39:31,516
That noise, the inhaler. I heard it
both times, before Leann and Brian...

327
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:34,245
Then when I looked behind me,
there was nobody there.

328
00:39:36,657 --> 00:39:38,989
What the hell is happening?

329
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:42,293
This is the morgue file of the dead
from the last month or so.

330
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,988
If Marie Layton died,
she did it in another city.

331
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,930
I don't know how you stand
looking at this stuff.

332
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:51,071
The dead ones don't really
bother me so much.

333
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,399
Now take a look at this. All right.

334
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:56,634
It's not a Marie Layton,
but an Ellie Layton.

335
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:59,409
That's the older daughter
from the photograph.

336
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,311
Yeah. It says she died of an asthma attack
in her apartment.

337
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,509
There's a CPS report attached too.

338
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:10,280
Child Protective Services.
Was she an abuse victim?

339
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:14,587
It says her mother was questioned
by a psychiatric nurse at...

340
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:18,126
...Saint Luke's.
- Your sister.

341
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:23,560
Wanna give me a hand with those?
Yeah, sure.

342
00:40:23,837 --> 00:40:26,601
Make sure Jesus is centered, all right?

343
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:29,436
Let's go, people! Let's go!

344
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,976
Hey, Gary, this is a great place.

345
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:34,706
I have a feeling
it's gonna be a terrific show.

346
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:38,113
- How's our girl doing, huh?
Not bad.

347
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:45,148
This is Beth. I'm calling for Taylor.

348
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:49,490
Taylor, when you get this,
will you call me, please? Thanks.

349
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:53,394
Jean's papers. I haven't had a chance
to go through them yet...

350
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,800
...but she kept records of everything
in case she had to go to court...

351
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:59,837
...so it's gotta be in here someplace.

352
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:12,513
She was the baby.
I was supposed to look out for her.

353
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:14,177
I'm sorry.

354
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,021
Is this it?

355
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:31,896
It says Marie Layton...

356
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,269
...checked her daughter Ellie
into the hospital for an asthma attack.

357
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:38,377
And here's the little one, Laurel,
stuck a needle in her hand.

358
00:41:38,545 --> 00:41:43,278
Laurel, insect bites, a burn on her leg.
Ellie, another asthma attack.

359
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:46,979
Okay, Laurel again,
pesticide in her eye.

360
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:49,588
Here's another one.
Laurel ingested detergent.

361
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,849
And there, another burn.

362
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,025
Look at that. That's nine admissions
in April and May alone.

363
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,629
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

364
00:41:58,065 --> 00:42:01,000
It's when a mother wants attention,
so she hurts her children...

365
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,499
...so they need medical help.

366
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,036
But there's no way
she could've given Ellie asthma.

367
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:08,106
No, but she could have exposed her
to something to set it off.

368
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,675
So Ellie has an asthma attack and dies.

369
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:13,369
My sister starts asking questions.

370
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:16,141
Marie gets nervous
she's gonna be found out...

371
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:18,148
...so she takes Laurel and disappears.

372
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:21,153
I'm gonna go get Missing Persons on this.

373
00:42:27,227 --> 00:42:29,957
<i>A cell phone rings
and Death is on the line.</i>

374
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,691
<i>A beautiful coed,
a ticking clock of ghostly murder.</i>

375
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:37,098
<i>Next, American Miracles takes you there
as a famed exorcist...</i>

376
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:41,037
<i>...tries to outrace the mysterious curse
that has already claimed two lives.</i>

377
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:47,046
Spiritual energy exists
in the same electromagnetic spectrum...

378
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:48,943
...as light or microwaves.

379
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,916
It's no surprise
it can travel through cellular phones.

380
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:57,590
And it grows there, like a seed...

381
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:03,722
...where it eventually manifests as
hallucinations, spiritual disturbances...

382
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:05,592
...and finally death.

383
00:43:05,766 --> 00:43:07,495
For you, darling.

384
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,136
<i>Taylor, it's Beth.
Hey, Beth.</i>

385
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:12,101
Listen, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

386
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:14,706
It's okay. Hold on.
We'll be there in a few minutes.

387
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,207
No. It's gonna work out. I know it.

388
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:20,609
- No, Taylor, listen to me.
- There's nothing else I can do.

389
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,610
- Shit.
Okay, everybody, here we go.

390
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:27,311
Quiet, please. And four, three, two...

391
00:43:28,255 --> 00:43:30,280
We cast out this unclean spirit.

392
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,052
Depart from here, Satan.

393
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,720
Depart, every demonic power...

394
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:40,458
...every infernal adversary, every legion.

395
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:42,499
I command you.

396
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:45,035
I command you in the name of God...

397
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:50,165
...in the names of all his heavenly
angels, to be gone from this cell phone.

398
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,738
I command you...

399
00:43:51,912 --> 00:43:56,372
...by the judge of the living and the
dead, you will leave my sister alone.

400
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:58,812
Come out, I say, in Jesus' name!

401
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:00,515
You serpent!

402
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:02,687
Devil!

403
00:44:03,056 --> 00:44:05,251
In the name of Jesus of Nazareth...

404
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:08,657
<i>...you will haunt this child of God
no more:</i>

405
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:13,828
Stop tormenting my sister.
You will come out now!

406
00:44:22,342 --> 00:44:24,367
I am calling you by name, Satan.

407
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:26,235
Come out. Show yourself!

408
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:35,249
Depart. Depart this place. Depart.

409
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:37,514
Hey, hey, you guys, take it easy.
I'm a cop.

410
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:57,142
Keep rolling. Keep rolling.

411
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:15,528
Taylor? Taylor.

412
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:18,194
Taylor.

413
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:42,616
Beth, hey. You okay? Yeah?

414
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:50,924
Everybody back off.

415
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:56,594
Did you get that, huh?
Please tell me you got it.

416
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,065
Huh?

417
00:45:58,805 --> 00:45:59,794
Ah...

418
00:46:21,929 --> 00:46:23,726
Tomorrow.

419
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,658
You weren't there, Mickey.
You didn't see this.

420
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:29,393
- This girl needs protection.
- From what?

421
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:33,802
The ghost in her cell phone?
Tell her to call customer service.

422
00:46:34,174 --> 00:46:36,165
Jack, Mickey's got a point.

423
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:38,868
Best use of people here
is we find the doer.

424
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:40,702
Yeah.

425
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:43,379
You're doing a great job so far.

426
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,570
<i>Voice call received...</i>

427
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:19,685
<i>Saturday, June 17th, 7:55 p. m.</i>

428
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:22,615
<i>Why?</i>

429
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:25,952
<i>Please, just tell me why.</i>

430
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:43,637
Look, are you sure you wanna stay here?
Maybe you could stay with family instead?

431
00:47:44,544 --> 00:47:47,206
- Well, my father's dead.
- Well, what about your mother?

432
00:47:51,084 --> 00:47:52,984
She and I don't talk very much.

433
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:57,686
- You don't have to stay.
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

434
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:59,587
I'm not going anywhere.

435
00:48:15,842 --> 00:48:19,039
Look, this isn't over yet.

436
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,504
All right?

437
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:26,946
- There's still time to figure this out.
- Not before 7:55 tonight.

438
00:48:34,094 --> 00:48:36,255
- Jesus. Beth, what happened here?
- Oh!

439
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,568
How old were you
when you got those?

440
00:48:43,737 --> 00:48:45,932
Seven? Eight?

441
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:50,410
Was it your mother?

442
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,275
Did your father know?

443
00:48:59,152 --> 00:49:02,986
When I call you, I expect you to come.
Do you hear me?

444
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:06,851
Do...

445
00:49:07,661 --> 00:49:08,685
<i>:::you:::</i>

446
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:10,220
...hear me?

447
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,710
My father knew.

448
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:37,954
<i>Cry, baby, cry</i>

449
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,820
You're disgusting.

450
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:43,496
Go ahead. Go cry to your father.

451
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,378
Daddy?

452
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:09,954
Daddy?

453
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:55,832
Hello.

454
00:50:57,037 --> 00:50:58,902
Yeah. Okay.

455
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,239
Where?

456
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:04,840
All right. All right, thanks.

457
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:08,673
That was Missing Persons.
They found Laurel. She's in a foster home.

458
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,278
She was at Saint Luke's
when it caught fire.

459
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:16,115
- Wait. So she was still at the hospital?
- Yes.

460
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:20,419
She'd cut her arm, and there'd been
a report to Child Protective Services.

461
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:22,994
They were holding her
until she could be examined.

462
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,358
What about her mother?
Do you know where she is?

463
00:51:25,932 --> 00:51:28,366
She hasn't been seen since the fire.

464
00:51:30,303 --> 00:51:34,137
- Well, do you think we could talk to Laurel?
- You can try.

465
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:44,580
Laurel? There are some people here
to see you.

466
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:53,622
Hi, Laurel. My name's Jack.

467
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,525
It's a cute little teddy bear you got there.

468
00:52:01,902 --> 00:52:04,496
Does your teddy bear have a name?

469
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:07,405
She hasn't spoken since the fire.

470
00:52:10,977 --> 00:52:12,467
Laurel, listen to me.

471
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:15,114
It's very important
that we find your mother.

472
00:52:15,282 --> 00:52:17,341
Do you know where she is right now?

473
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,582
Laurel, do you know
where your mother went?

474
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,117
Do you know where she is?

475
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:37,936
Do you think there's maybe
some way that you could talk to her?

476
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:40,595
L...
You wanna try talking to her?

477
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:50,177
What's wrong?
It's just the song the bear plays.

478
00:52:53,486 --> 00:52:54,851
Laurel, honey?

479
00:52:56,022 --> 00:52:58,081
Honey, do you know
where your mother is?

480
00:52:58,692 --> 00:52:59,886
Laurel?

481
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,322
Can you tell...? Look at me.

482
00:53:01,494 --> 00:53:04,520
Can you tell us? Do you know?
Can you say something?

483
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,356
Where is your mother? Goddamn it.

484
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:14,765
Oh, that was great, you know?
You really have a way with kids.

485
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,274
We have four hours left.
We're not gonna find her in time.

486
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,436
Yes, we will.
The first thing we'll do...

487
00:53:20,613 --> 00:53:23,275
...is go downtown
and hit the department computers.

488
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,941
Everybody leaves a trail,
ATM machines, credit cards.

489
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,019
- We'll track Marie that way.
- You do that.

490
00:53:28,188 --> 00:53:31,783
I'll find out about the fire at Saint
Luke's. Everything seems to start there.

491
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,620
Are you out of your mind?
Don't even think about that.

492
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,753
- I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- We'll get more done if we split up, okay?

493
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:41,457
And I'm safe until 7:55 p. m.

494
00:53:41,868 --> 00:53:43,301
All right.

495
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:46,263
- I'll meet you at the library at 7 sharp.
- Okay.

496
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:48,669
Here, take my other phone.

497
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:51,510
Call me if you need me.

498
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,348
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report to Cardiology.</i>

499
00:55:10,523 --> 00:55:12,354
<i>Dr. Nelson, please report...</i>

500
00:55:12,525 --> 00:55:15,688
- Can you ask him to hurry, please?
- I've already called him twice.

501
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,265
- Miss Raymond. Mm-hm.
- Dr. Painter? I need your help.

502
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:24,194
You were the doctor
on the children's ward...

503
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:26,565
...the day of the fire
at Saint Luke's Hospital?

504
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:27,763
- That's right.
- Okay.

505
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:30,876
Do you remember a little girl,
Laurel Layton? She was 6.

506
00:55:31,044 --> 00:55:34,411
She had cut herself and you made her
stay there so the CPS could investigate.

507
00:55:37,383 --> 00:55:38,407
Shit.

508
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,951
Sure, I remember her.
Her sister had just died...

509
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:43,180
...and one of the nurses
filled out a report.

510
00:55:43,356 --> 00:55:44,948
Right. Do you remember her mother?

511
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:48,754
Was her mother there when the fire
started? It was during visiting hours?

512
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:52,295
That wouldn't have made a difference.
The mother was there all the time.

513
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:11,615
Excuse me. I'm looking for a student,
her name is Beth.

514
00:56:11,784 --> 00:56:13,411
She was supposed to be here
earlier today.

515
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:15,912
Where are you?

516
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:19,181
I think Marie Layton was in the hospital
when it burned down.

517
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,156
I think that she might've died there.

518
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:23,352
Impossible. All the bodies were identified.

519
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:27,125
I know, but what if they didn't find her?
What if her body's still inside?

520
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,067
<i>She was a sick woman, a child abuser.
What if her body is still inside...</i>

521
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:35,002
...and her spirit's there,
moving through the phones...

522
00:56:35,175 --> 00:56:36,437
...attacking people?

523
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,072
Okay, all right. Where are you?
I'll come get you.

524
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:46,577
Well, here we are, miss, Saint Luke's.

525
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:48,653
<i>What's left of it, anyway.</i>

526
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,183
<i>Beth, no! Wait for me, all right?
I'm on my way.</i>

527
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:53,552
Hurry, there's not much time.

528
01:01:19,025 --> 01:01:20,014
Shit!

529
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,731
- It's okay, it's okay.
- She's coming for me. She's coming.

530
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,868
- Okay, come on. Let's go.
- She's coming.

531
01:02:12,578 --> 01:02:15,069
No! No!

532
01:02:22,421 --> 01:02:24,252
What the hell is that?

533
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:27,490
Come on, let's go!

534
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:34,158
- Try those doors right there.
- Uhn!

535
01:03:10,002 --> 01:03:11,902
Jack!

536
01:03:12,071 --> 01:03:13,663
Jack!

537
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:38,794
No!

538
01:05:23,636 --> 01:05:25,103
Beth!

539
01:07:26,392 --> 01:07:28,656
Please don't hurt me.

540
01:07:32,398 --> 01:07:34,025
Please.

541
01:07:37,603 --> 01:07:43,803
Forgive me.

542
01:07:45,711 --> 01:07:47,474
Why?

543
01:07:48,848 --> 01:07:50,076
Why?

544
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:25,483
She had to be the first.

545
01:08:25,784 --> 01:08:29,220
She had to have my sister's number
stored in her cell phone.

546
01:08:29,521 --> 01:08:33,423
I know what she was,
but I have this feeling that she...

547
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:36,888
...brought me here or something
to protect me.

548
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:41,831
Otherwise, why am I still alive?

549
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:58,573
Broken pile ready to go?
Yeah.

550
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,448
Do you wanna come in?

551
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:40,585
No, I've gotta go tell Laurel
that her mother's gone.

552
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,353
Besides, you look like
you could use some rest.

553
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:44,621
Yeah.

554
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:49,991
Maybe you could call me sometime.

555
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:51,764
How about tomorrow?

556
01:09:53,138 --> 01:09:54,867
Tomorrow would be nice.

557
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:16,719
It's just as well.
I'll tell her myself in the morning.

558
01:11:23,962 --> 01:11:26,829
What is it?
- That's Laurel's, isn't it?

559
01:11:27,466 --> 01:11:30,833
It looks like hers.
Yeah, that's the teddy bear.

560
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:48,177
It's a nanny cam.

561
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:51,184
Records what goes on in the kid's room.

562
01:12:02,101 --> 01:12:04,626
<i>We'll come in here...</i>

563
01:12:05,304 --> 01:12:08,239
<i>...and sit you down.</i>

564
01:12:08,874 --> 01:12:12,207
Now, be a nice little girl.

565
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,035
Oh, my God.

566
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:49,474
Now, this will only hurt a little.

567
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:53,075
Hey, guys...

568
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,788
Get away from her!

569
01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:07,894
It was you.

570
01:13:08,066 --> 01:13:10,466
It was you the whole time.

571
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,735
I should've known.

572
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,204
<i>Mama!</i>

573
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,142
<i>Please, help me! Mama!</i>

574
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:29,581
Mama!

575
01:14:40,993 --> 01:14:43,826
Hi, Laurel. It wasn't
your mother who hurt you.

576
01:14:43,996 --> 01:14:45,554
It was your sister, Ellie, wasn't it?

577
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:55,736
But she always gave me candy.

578
01:14:58,877 --> 01:15:02,074
- More stuff from the hospital?
- Yep. CSU will go through it tomorrow.

579
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:04,272
- See you later.
- Yeah. Take it easy, man.

580
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:05,004
<i>Voice call received Saturday, June 17th...</i>

581
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:07,304
<i>...11 p. m.</i>

582
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:12,749
<i>No.</i>

583
01:16:12,918 --> 01:16:14,977
<i>No, wait. Wait, no!</i>

584
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:24,022
<i>I... I just thought
you should hear this, Jack.</i>

585
01:16:24,329 --> 01:16:25,887
<i>Jack?</i>

586
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,374
Come on. Come on, pick up.

587
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:55,019
<i>Hi. No one's home, leave us a message.</i>

588
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:59,656
Beth, listen, okay?
Marie wasn't the first, it w...

589
01:17:03,902 --> 01:17:05,893
So, look, you were right.

590
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:09,199
Marie wasn't trying to kill you
at the hospital. She was trying...

591
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:10,705
<i>...to protect you, all right?</i>

592
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,606
<i>She was trying to
keep her daughter away from you.</i>

593
01:17:16,648 --> 01:17:18,013
Call me.

594
01:19:02,921 --> 01:19:05,082
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah.

595
01:19:05,257 --> 01:19:06,952
Look, it wasn't Marie, all right?

596
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:09,650
The whole time it was Ellie.
She made the very first phone call.

597
01:19:11,897 --> 01:19:13,660
What's that?

598
01:19:32,784 --> 01:19:35,048
No. No, wait. No!

599
01:19:37,222 --> 01:19:39,816
No!

600
01:20:14,326 --> 01:20:15,520
Aah!
