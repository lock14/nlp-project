Don't mind him.

272
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:27,256
He doesn't think
before he talks.

273
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,363
Just like his mother.

274
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:31,435
Sorry about that Billy.

275
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,705

Oh no brother. Fatso is mine.

apple sauce back.

295
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:48,032

297
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,083

302
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,290
These corpses do

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:29,977
He's doing just great.

304
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:05,409
You're in my light.

305
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,842
When the next time
someone kiss on your lips.

306
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:31,645
Stay the fuck away
from my little girl.

307
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,951
Mom! That's attached on.
- Go inside, Grace.

308
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:43,108
You're messing with the wrong
family on the wrong day, asshole.

309
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,189
You... You are...

310
00:36:50,398 --> 00:36:52,001
What are you doing here?

311
00:36:52,036 --> 00:36:54,342
What makes you think
you can come here?

312
00:36:54,377 --> 00:36:56,716
You scared the girl.
- Shut up.

313
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,652
Just shut your mouth.

314
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,323
I'm sorry.
- I said shut up.

315
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:07,033
What's this?

316
00:37:07,345 --> 00:37:10,443
Something to help out.
- No.

317
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:13,225
No, you don't get to do that.

318
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:16,369
You don't get to shoot my
husband in cold blood...

319
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:18,301
and did stuff with the ATM.

320
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,200
It's for your daughter.

321
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,443
This is what you deserve.

322
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:25,927
What you did to me.

323
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,972
Who punishes you?

324
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,452
He taught you how to shoot.

325
00:37:37,894 --> 00:37:40,092
Good edge to keep
his family safe.

326
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,198
He could always be here.

327
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:46,780
Took the act to the range.

328
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:49,955
Showed you what to do.

329
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,566
This... is what you do.

330
00:37:57,948 --> 00:37:59,578
Squeeze.

331
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,679
Now pull.

332
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:15,160
I can't find my red pen.

333
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:21,005
Mom? I need it.

334
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:29,225
Take it.

335
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:15,082
The Sebous.

336
00:39:16,025 --> 00:39:17,518
Nice brother.

337
00:39:18,031 --> 00:39:19,234
Is it yours?

338
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:20,404
I checked.

339
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:23,070
Old Chessarate used

340
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:26,653
Let's go inside before I
free my fucking Perosaline.

341
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,636
What's the matter?

342
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:52,819
Just when I think I'm Ok
and see my reflection...

343
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:56,598
I look horrible.

344
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:01,012
What has he done to me?

345
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:05,142
Oh no... don't cry, brother.

346
00:40:05,177 --> 00:40:08,669
Everything is
gonna be alright.

347
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,875
I promise you two things.

348
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,955
One, I will find Castle
and I will kill him.

349
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:19,261
Slowly and painfully.

350
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:26,483
And two, you will never ever have
to look at your reflection again,

351
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:28,853
as long as you're with me.

352
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:32,759
Such a delineate.

00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:38,743
9 trillion of renew
anymore crystal.

354
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,317
We don't talk them play.

355
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:44,292
It's the Russian, Mr. Volage.

356
00:41:45,932 --> 00:41:48,471
My men is concerned.

357
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,138
If Punisher can do
this to your face,

358
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,152
what might he do to our deal?

359
00:41:54,187 --> 00:41:57,890
The tongue stretches further
than most people think.

360
00:41:58,232 --> 00:42:01,639
Ask your men how he's
gonna talk that shit,

361
00:42:01,908 --> 00:42:03,881
when I pull it from his mouth.

362
00:42:03,916 --> 00:42:05,407
Or you'll what?

363
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:08,224
Enough!

364
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,364
The Punisher's my problem.

365
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,233
Rock's mine.

366
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:15,174
My look have nothing
to do with this.

367
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:17,744
Everybody.

368
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:21,223
From local security to
international custom's in my pocket.

369
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,271
Quite frankly. This job
doesn't get done without me.

370
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:29,172
What's most for the blame?

371
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:33,153
It's too precise. And
she wants you have it.

372
00:42:33,628 --> 00:42:35,359
Sure thing now.

373
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:40,979
Shit!

374
00:42:50,773 --> 00:42:52,711
I'll go inside.

375
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:10,225
My most sincere apologies.

376
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,964
My father always say
never insult your host.

377
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:16,977
Sounds like a reasonable man.

378
00:43:17,513 --> 00:43:19,347
You don't know my father.

379
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,733
Three days.

380
00:43:29,178 --> 00:43:31,376
There have to be 12 million.

381
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:37,332
Maybe when you get it
all done, we'll both know,

382
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:41,535
that this biological shit you're
bringing in is ruining the city.

383
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,672
You're selling it to
the rednecks and queens.

384
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:48,864
The porchers are crawling
in suits from homeland.

385
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:52,101
And it take a lot of
pills to keep it quiet.

386
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:05,007
I always knew you'd
be a good boss, Billy

387
00:44:49,597 --> 00:44:51,089
Latin kings.

388
00:44:51,434 --> 00:44:53,638
Let him go, Frank.

389
00:44:53,673 --> 00:44:55,792
You know this piece of shit?

390
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,913
Next piece of shit.
- Yeah.

391
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,792
The regular hard boy.

392
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,230
Fuck you, cracker.
- Language.

393
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:04,635
It's a genius racket.

394
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,508
You know how the cops
always run the guns by back?

395
00:45:06,543 --> 00:45:08,446
Except they never work.

396
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:12,355
Because work banner is
gonna trust the cops, right?

397
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:17,987
Well, these drive by whack
jobs, they just love Carlos here.

398
00:45:18,022 --> 00:45:21,945
That with one look at that Ink,
and they know he's for real.

399
00:45:22,116 --> 00:45:26,026
We can get the guns
of the streets to you

400
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:29,434
Everyone seen a banger look
to quit. Too fucking stupid.

401
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:33,341
He's straight, Frank.

402
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:38,789
Hey ma! Frank's
here. He says eat up.

403
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:42,194
How is she doing?

404
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,811
Yeah well...

405
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:48,653
As long as she got her
cooking shows, she's good.

406
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,857
It's the only
thing she notices.

407
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:54,230
But hey that's
something, right?

408
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:58,639
Listen. I-

409
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,227
I just came around to tell you
I'm going out of town for a while.

410
00:46:03,898 --> 00:46:04,421
Out of town?

411
00:46:09,479 --> 00:46:11,517
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

412
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:15,723
I never thought of the Punisher,
you know taking a long weekend.

413
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:17,833
I'm not planning
on coming back.

414
00:46:18,938 --> 00:46:20,670
So I take the things didn't go
so well at the Donatelli home.

415
00:46:23,717 --> 00:46:25,586
Did the Billy
Russoli survived?

416
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:29,024
I heard.

417
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:33,242
But the cops did caught him.

418
00:46:33,277 --> 00:46:35,782
You might know they
got nothing on him.

419
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:37,085
Their hands are tied.

420
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,857
This is when the
Punisher comes in.

421
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:41,991
This is why I believe in you. Why
I supported you all these years.

422
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,303
You want me to tell you about
somethings happened to...

423
00:46:43,338 --> 00:46:45,276
Mrs. Donatelli
and her daughter?

424
00:46:45,311 --> 00:46:47,179
Because that's
what's gonna happen.

425
00:46:47,214 --> 00:46:48,964
You don't think he's
gonna go for revenge?

426
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:50,713
It's not important it's
just a matter of when.

427
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:03,719
Pull a couple of brisk.
- For what?

428
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:09,834
3, 2, 1

429
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:16,259
Russoli is the last one.

430
00:47:16,294 --> 00:47:16,859
Then I'm done.

431
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:18,582
For your own lips to Ganzier.

432
00:47:18,617 --> 00:47:20,529
You know where I can find him.

433
00:47:20,564 --> 00:47:22,408
I don't have a fix on him.

434
00:47:22,443 --> 00:47:25,385
You worked out all the
associates that amount to me.

435
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,125
So much to the new guy.
The leader was black.

436
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,527
Dreadlocks.

437
00:47:29,562 --> 00:47:30,766
There's some kind of
acrobatic stuff over the roof.

438
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:34,141
That's the DNA
servant free for gain.

439
00:47:34,176 --> 00:47:35,978
He's a mean motherfucker.

440
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,780
He's on a constant method.

441
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,774
Welcome home.

442
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,914
You want to find
the sky or not?

443
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,160
You boys playing with us?

444
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,261
I've been looking for you.

445
00:48:06,296 --> 00:48:07,932
Sure yes. Take your load off.

446
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,104
I need to go see Castle.

447
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:13,181
Where do I find him?
- Brats, you know.

448
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:13,773
He just left.

449
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:17,151
Wait...

450
00:48:17,626 --> 00:48:18,788
You know what I like to do.

451
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:25,276
I like to sit in my car and listen
to CB Radio and follow the crime.

452
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:28,654
I don't mind just indoor.

453
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:30,659
But there's no work
for me in front of this.

454
00:48:30,694 --> 00:48:33,668
But I'm not the luckiest
guy in the planet, you know.

455
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:51,346
Let's get to the back door.

456
00:49:08,263 --> 00:49:10,963
I didn't knew these boys are gonna
hit the store of 15th in 40 seconds.

457
00:49:28,317 --> 00:49:29,084
Suspects are armed
and dangerous.

458
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,116
I repeat. Suspects are
armed and dangerous.

459
00:49:32,997 --> 00:49:35,526
Let's do this.

460
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:38,510
Really?

461
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,273
Let's try the car.

462
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,493
Come on! Run!

463
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:37,837
Don't kill me.

464
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:40,042
Russoli, where is he?

465
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:42,516
Yeah Jigsaw, I
was just with him.

466
00:50:42,618 --> 00:50:44,891
He was suppose to give
us some dope for a joke.

467
00:50:44,926 --> 00:50:46,485
But time's up.

468
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:49,735
He don't come here anymore.

469
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:53,914
He forgot he have Porch do
that or he'd be like bastard.

470
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,458
So you wanna go see him,
you need to tell him this,

471
00:50:57,493 --> 00:50:59,191
we hate you bitch.
Take your part.

472
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:05,542
Soul for soul,
Mr. Punisher, sir.

473
00:51:09,323 --> 00:51:12,733
So when did Donatelli
ordered a hunt?

474
00:51:12,768 --> 00:51:14,872
We were partners in that cart.

475
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:15,974
Unfortunately,

476
00:51:16,009 --> 00:51:18,081
most of them had
been confiscated.

477
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,345
Ended up in my mouth.

478
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:23,094
Until the traders tried
to wrap me and Nicky out.

479
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:23,226
He wouldn't.

480
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:26,931
They sent him undercover.

481
00:51:27,874 --> 00:51:30,108
He's dead because of me.

482
00:51:33,122 --> 00:51:34,921
So you still skin your lobes?

483
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:38,429
No. That's in the past.

484
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,011
Shit!

485
00:51:57,421 --> 00:52:00,122
I'm on the grab. Meet
me on the other side.

486
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:28,697
Move.

487
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:31,811
Hello, Mrs. Donatelli.

488
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,552
We will live in your
place from now on.

489
00:52:33,587 --> 00:52:35,909
What do you want from us?

490
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,196
Looking for my money.

491
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:40,203
About the rat your
husband stole from me.

492
00:52:40,238 --> 00:52:41,695
But we don't have
it. I swear to God.

493
00:52:46,387 --> 00:52:48,123
How about you, sweet cheeks?

494
00:52:48,158 --> 00:52:50,630
Would you also dare to swear
on your imaginery friend?

495
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:55,844
Make sure they don't move.

496
00:52:55,879 --> 00:52:58,078
I'll look for the money.
- Come here kid.

497
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:04,616
Freeze, asshole.

498
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:06,333
You're under arrest.

499
00:53:23,788 --> 00:53:25,691
Stay out of my way.

500
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:17,733
Listen to me.

501
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:21,403
Russoli is headed to
the Donatelli house.

502
00:54:21,677 --> 00:54:23,444
He's probably already there.

503
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,556
You'll have to let me go.

504
00:54:26,591 --> 00:54:29,257
You have the right
to shut the fuck up.

505
00:55:25,986 --> 00:55:28,308
Good evening, officers.

506
00:55:28,343 --> 00:55:30,597
Is everything Ok in there?

507
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:35,509
No. Everything is
not Ok. Follow me.

508
00:55:44,536 --> 00:55:46,734
Officer.

509
00:55:47,075 --> 00:55:49,708
No... don't!

510
00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:05,658
Well...

511
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:08,929
This day was about to come
sooner or later, wasn't it?

512
00:56:10,273 --> 00:56:13,406
Did you hear from
the patrol car?

513
00:56:15,453 --> 00:56:16,889
So...

514
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:18,188
I tried it a couple times.

515
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:20,964
There was no answer.

516
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:30,759
Listen.

517
00:56:30,794 --> 00:56:33,563
We gotta get out of here
before more pigs arrive.

518
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,876
Where the fuck is the money?

519
00:56:36,911 --> 00:56:38,213
My husband has a safe
upstairs in the bedroom.

520
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:41,590
I don't know if it's there but
I can give you the combination.

521
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,585
10-12-1965

522
00:56:43,963 --> 00:56:45,700
Oh how cute.

523
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,934
Is that your dead
husband's birthday?

524
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:01,968
Let me out of here.

525
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:10,661
Get him to the station.
- You bet.

526
00:57:28,885 --> 00:57:29,443
Let me out.

527
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:34,063
You know, Frank.

528
00:57:34,098 --> 00:57:36,264
You're throwing your tip
to no one against one thing.

529
00:57:36,439 --> 00:57:40,507
Password to the crime base is
sure but letting you go, so-

530
00:57:41,888 --> 00:57:42,286
Fine.

531
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:55,988
How you doing?

532
00:58:10,364 --> 00:58:12,768
19.

533
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:36,195
What was that?

534
00:58:37,069 --> 00:58:37,628
Go check it out.

535
00:58:40,545 --> 00:58:42,449
What the fuck you
waiting for? Christmas?

536
00:59:11,296 --> 00:59:11,695
Now.

537
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,701
Hey!
- You sit down.

538
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:23,687
I'm calling this out.

539
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:25,663
Put your hands behind you.

540
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,348
You asshole!

541
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:35,959
Where do you
think you're going?

542
00:59:36,765 --> 00:59:39,363
Hands up!

543
00:59:43,516 --> 00:59:44,610
I repeat, dispatch.
We need back up.

544
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:55,314
Billy! Go get him.

545
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:57,217
Get him the fucking out.

546
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:04,503
Stay where you fucking are.

547
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:08,816
We did it.

548
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,389
You mind explain it to me?

549
01:00:12,595 --> 01:00:16,105
How I have the criminal escaped
from the back of your lock?

550
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,638
The case was a slippery one.

551
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,213
You'll be safe here.

552
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:37,260
We can manage on our own.

553
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:38,763
Just until you know
Russoli's been arrested.

554
01:00:43,914 --> 01:00:46,284
Grace.

555
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,588
Grace, you listen, honey.

556
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,657
She's smart.

557
01:00:52,503 --> 01:00:54,441
Go ahead. Open it.

558
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:27,892
It... belongs to my daughter.

559
01:01:30,572 --> 01:01:30,902
Here.

560
01:01:37,926 --> 01:01:40,490
Wow!

561
01:01:58,148 --> 01:02:04,630
Was... This was
her favorite toy.

562
01:02:04,665 --> 01:02:08,008
She got so angry when her
brother used to hide it from her.

563
01:02:08,043 --> 01:02:11,780
Does she care to
fight with him?

564
01:02:12,153 --> 01:02:14,488
No.

565
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:35,748
You gonna file for
killing two of my officers.

566
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:38,947
I wanna warn you.
- Go get your fucking line up.

567
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:41,665
No lie is gonna get
you out of this one.

568
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,937
Like a piece of shit.

569
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:04,594
Agent Miller. What
are you doing here?

570
01:03:04,629 --> 01:03:05,695
Russoli.

571
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,501
What's he gotta
do with the bureau?

572
01:03:07,536 --> 01:03:09,371
Pierre's gonna tell you
what he's working on.

573
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:11,208
He says he got some
intel to make a deal for.

574
01:03:12,783 --> 01:03:14,353
Anyone know where
he is right now?

575
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:15,925
He's on his way
to the reservation.

576
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,289
Good.

577
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:20,235
Yeah.

578
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:22,308
Cameraz. Agent Miller
with the bureau.

579
01:03:22,343 --> 01:03:26,012
I believe you've been informed
we're taking over this.

580
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:31,800
This perk killed
all my officers.

581
01:03:31,835 --> 01:03:35,076
And terrorize a woman and
child with your agents.

582
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,306
You keep that in mind, Miller.

583
01:03:42,497 --> 01:03:45,537
You're lucky I came
to you with this.

584
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,577
But then I look
patriot just like you.

585
01:03:50,084 --> 01:03:51,787
I shit in red white and blue.

586
01:03:51,822 --> 01:03:54,345
The reason you came to me
is because you got caught.

587
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:56,869
Say that to someone without
the intelligence, Ok?

588
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:57,571
You tell me what you know.

589
01:03:57,606 --> 01:04:00,043
If it's any good,

590
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:02,916
I'll recommend
life without parole.

591
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:06,785
This deal is
going down tonight?

592
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:12,809
I know when and I know where.

593
01:04:13,213 --> 01:04:18,820
So you're gonna give me and my
brother the immunity and the money.

594
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,592
Or you're gonna have to explain
the war to fucking Witzer.

595
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:27,217
Why you had a lead on the thing
that killed half of the fucking city,

596
01:04:27,252 --> 01:04:29,452
and you didn't do a
goddamn thing about it.

597
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,276
I'll be right back.

598
01:04:36,311 --> 01:04:38,246
Oh and Miller.

599
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:40,048
Just that one
other little thing.

600
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,060
Happy?

601
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,210
Shit! You bastard.

602
01:06:06,153 --> 01:06:07,804
You're a fucking dead man.

603
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,457
My father will kill you.

604
01:06:10,497 --> 01:06:13,164
My father said you'll hear
the fucking silver plate!

605
01:06:18,553 --> 01:06:20,183
Agent Miller.

606
01:06:20,492 --> 01:06:21,994
It's agreed.

607
01:06:22,029 --> 01:06:23,932
The other conditions
of our agreement?

608
01:06:25,304 --> 01:06:27,276
Clear the air.

609
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:32,482
I hope when the guy finds you,
you'll get what you deserve.

610
01:06:52,946 --> 01:06:54,683
How long was I-

611
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:56,205
A long time.

612
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,784
You should eat.

613
01:06:57,819 --> 01:06:59,092
Yuck!
- Grace.

614
01:06:59,127 --> 01:07:00,331
What is it?

615
01:07:00,366 --> 01:07:02,238
Egg and cheese and Oris.

616
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:03,425
That's all I have.

617
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,523
What's the name Oris?

618
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:07,586
Meal. Ready to eat.

619
01:07:07,621 --> 01:07:07,919
Military food.

620
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:11,195
It's great for
people who can't cook.

621
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:14,601
Look, Grace. This is
gonna come with chuckles.

622
01:07:14,772 --> 01:07:17,175
It's the best one I get.

623
01:07:17,345 --> 01:07:18,782
Not exactly a
balanced breakfast.

624
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:21,482
Out of practise.

625
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:26,628
Not one more step.

626
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:33,521
Where's my girl?

627
01:07:33,556 --> 01:07:33,957
His mother is in
the feeding room.

628
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:35,127
He didn't want to leave her.

629
01:07:35,162 --> 01:07:35,927
Damn it.

630
01:07:35,962 --> 01:07:38,800
I need to talk to her.

631
01:07:39,338 --> 01:07:40,071
This is Carlos.

632
01:07:40,106 --> 01:07:43,046
He's... a friend of mine.

633
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:47,324
He's gonna help me take
care of some things.

634
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,231
Hi Carlos. I'm Grace.

635
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,667
Hey little darling.

636
01:07:50,702 --> 01:07:52,104
We're gonna be homies, right?

637
01:07:53,644 --> 01:07:55,414
Yeah. we're gonna be tidy.

638
01:07:55,449 --> 01:07:57,183
This all will be over soon.

639
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,327
Then you can go.

640
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:08,007
Don't go.

641
01:08:24,627 --> 01:08:26,599
I need you on alert.

642
01:08:27,869 --> 01:08:29,704
Don't make me regret this.

643
01:08:39,568 --> 01:08:41,402
That was fun.

644
01:08:41,774 --> 01:08:45,818
Now let's go kill Castle
and his miserable whore.

645
01:08:45,853 --> 01:08:47,756
No, not yet.

646
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,658
We're gonna have ourself
a little fun with this.

647
01:08:50,832 --> 01:08:53,272
Next time you guys defend
source in the fucking army.

648
01:08:53,307 --> 01:08:55,946
Where do we get the army from?

649
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:58,551
Just like golden Sam, bro.

650
01:08:58,586 --> 01:09:01,458
We recruit in
trouble blade boys.

651
01:09:01,493 --> 01:09:04,936
Offer a hundred grand towards a
college education you'll never get.

652
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:07,877
Promise nobody's gonna
be asked to go to Iraq.

653
01:09:09,014 --> 01:09:11,253
Just as long as I
get to kill Castle.

654
01:09:11,288 --> 01:09:13,392
Don't worry brother. You will.

655
01:09:13,427 --> 01:09:16,332
Just making damn sure this time
he don't come back breathing.

656
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:02,623
Hold it.

657
01:10:07,673 --> 01:10:09,736
Hello swordsman.

658
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:19,237
How are you today my friend?

659
01:10:19,272 --> 01:10:21,041
Run! Get out of here!

660
01:10:21,076 --> 01:10:25,019
Hey! I asked you a question.

661
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:29,463
Wrong answer.

662
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:33,433
Guess I'll have
to ask it again.

663
01:10:35,582 --> 01:10:36,515
Here I come.

664
01:11:18,532 --> 01:11:20,230
Good.

665
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:21,999
Bring him upstairs.

666
01:11:22,342 --> 01:11:23,242
Bring him back down here.

667
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:26,952
I'll see if we can talk these
bastards into signing up.

668
01:11:35,578 --> 01:11:36,604
Where are they?

669
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,753
I shout. I swear I shout.

670
01:11:46,788 --> 01:11:49,439
Goddamnit! Don't die on me.

671
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:52,423
What do we do now?

672
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:53,993
I see him shooting for her.

673
01:11:54,028 --> 01:11:56,466
Shut up kid. You're
gonna be fine.

674
01:11:57,304 --> 01:11:59,674
The hurt is real bad.
Hurt is real bad, Frank.

675
01:12:02,183 --> 01:12:04,556
Don't let me die on this, man.

676
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:06,150
Not like this.

677
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:18,490
See you in hell.

678
01:12:19,196 --> 01:12:22,969
I see you anywhere near
hell, I'll kick your ass up.

679
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,540
I haven't seen
you in ages, Frank.

680
01:12:51,518 --> 01:12:54,183
Whatever it is, it
must be pretty bad.

681
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,019
Maybe I'm just here
to see an old friend.

682
01:12:57,232 --> 01:12:58,804
Yeah right. I haven't
seen you since-

683
01:12:58,839 --> 01:13:00,866
A few month ago. I know.

684
01:13:03,283 --> 01:13:05,185
I've been reading about you.

685
01:13:05,454 --> 01:13:08,394
You've been a long way from
the seminary, my friend.

686
01:13:08,997 --> 01:13:12,632
I don't really remember
that part as in my life.

687
01:13:13,243 --> 01:13:13,835
Why do you do this?

688
01:13:16,217 --> 01:13:17,049
Somebody has to
punish the corrupt.

689
01:13:19,659 --> 01:13:22,232
For the same way you judge
others, you will be judge.

690
01:13:22,267 --> 01:13:26,711
And with the measure you use
here will be measured to you.

691
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:29,118
Matthew. 72.

692
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:34,090
I'm Ok with that.

693
01:13:36,205 --> 01:13:37,674
God be with you, friend.

694
01:13:42,154 --> 01:13:48,434
Sometimes I'd like to
get my hands on God.

695
01:14:02,276 --> 01:14:03,005
Interested trust
for me to place.

696
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,515
Didn't take you for a
religious man, Castle.

697
01:14:07,255 --> 01:14:10,388
Yeah well. An eye for an eye.

698
01:14:10,598 --> 01:14:13,731
If I remember then I'll call
to attend your suggestions.

699
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,775
Besides he's got
Angela and Grace.

700
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:19,019
Doesn't matter.

701
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:22,628
Or maybe if you put her in
protective custody like you should,

702
01:14:23,466 --> 01:14:24,161
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

703
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:28,010
A locking touch, Castle.

704
01:14:30,518 --> 01:14:31,613
Told you in community.

705
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:35,460
Unless you gotta take
Russoli as you take him.

706
01:14:36,835 --> 01:14:38,534
Can't even give him
a parking ticket.

707
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,273
It's a fucked up
system you're sworn to.

708
01:14:42,552 --> 01:14:43,611
I never said it was perfect.

709
01:14:44,155 --> 01:14:46,354
It was being
exchanged for that.

710
01:14:47,263 --> 01:14:50,933
I need to secure the trade.

711
01:14:51,174 --> 01:14:52,837
Ok.

712
01:14:54,015 --> 01:14:55,752
I'm on this private poke.

713
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:58,590
Where do you think
they're going by huh?

714
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:00,797
I took them host, Castle.

715
01:15:01,536 --> 01:15:03,096
We're lost.
- No official police procedure.

716
01:15:04,879 --> 01:15:05,345
You wanna come along?

717
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:07,246
Leave your badge at home.

718
01:15:12,733 --> 01:15:13,793
I have to think about it.

719
01:15:14,003 --> 01:15:14,128
Throughout this ticket.

720
01:15:38,236 --> 01:15:39,204
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

721
01:15:39,438 --> 01:15:41,103
Relax.

722
01:15:41,778 --> 01:15:44,376
We're looking for
a few good man.

723
01:15:46,591 --> 01:15:48,262
And we'd like to offer
you the opportunity...

724
01:15:48,297 --> 01:15:51,236
to be all that you can be.

725
01:15:53,142 --> 01:15:55,243
Now we've all suffered, lost,

726
01:15:55,278 --> 01:15:57,345
at the hands of the Punisher.

727
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:01,982
And because we don't
look like everybody else;

728
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:04,973
and because we don't
act like everybody else;

729
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:07,373
nobody does a goddamn
thing about it.

730
01:16:09,787 --> 01:16:14,665
Well I say, he ain't the only one who
can take the war into his own hands.

731
01:16:15,369 --> 01:16:20,750
So if you're as sick of
this cocksucker as I am,

732
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,152
raise your armies.

733
01:16:22,187 --> 01:16:23,518
You'll be well paid.

734
01:16:25,764 --> 01:16:26,892
You'll be well armed.

735
01:16:28,738 --> 01:16:32,647
And at the end of it,
the Punisher will be dead.

736
01:17:50,694 --> 01:17:52,030
Hey it's the booty ansky.

737
01:17:52,065 --> 01:17:53,366
Just in time for happy hour.

738
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:55,797
You need to come with me.

739
01:17:57,345 --> 01:17:58,006
Where to?

740
01:17:58,314 --> 01:17:58,747
Your partner, Frank Castle.

741
01:17:59,684 --> 01:18:01,417
He needs help.

742
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:05,764
Partner is a little
bit exaggeration there.

743
01:18:07,038 --> 01:18:08,098
How did you know?

744
01:18:08,608 --> 01:18:11,138
Usually I'm the
arresting indeed.

745
01:18:12,118 --> 01:18:14,181
And no one could
escape that easily.

746
01:18:14,425 --> 01:18:16,122
You know you're not
as stupid as you-

747
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,579
Who are we looking for?

748
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:23,776
Mr. Farm.

749
01:18:26,257 --> 01:18:29,060
I don't this is a good idea.

750
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,621
What?

751
01:18:41,363 --> 01:18:42,834
We're looking for
Tiberia. Cristu father.

752
01:18:47,114 --> 01:18:48,139
Who are you?

753
01:18:48,584 --> 01:18:49,384
If I were to burial,

754
01:18:49,419 --> 01:18:53,329
I'd probably wanna find the man who was
responsible for sending my son to prison,

755
01:18:54,066 --> 01:18:54,829
and I might took his life.

756
01:18:56,071 --> 01:18:56,731
And how would you do that?

757
01:18:56,907 --> 01:18:58,810
I tell you when and
where to find him.

758
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:03,450
What do you want from me?

759
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:06,690
I don't like him. I
want him taken care of.

760
01:19:09,307 --> 01:19:12,247
No worries my friend.

761
01:20:09,937 --> 01:20:11,635
Oh boy!

762
01:20:45,802 --> 01:20:47,797

764
01:20:59,873 --> 01:21:00,773
Who are you looking for?

765
01:21:00,808 --> 01:21:03,077

766
01:21:06,792 --> 01:21:09,390

Cops the only way to
push the fire work start.

771
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:37,265
We won't worry about that, I
call the name that explosive.

772
01:21:38,744 --> 01:21:41,809
Instruction, everything

774
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:47,228
