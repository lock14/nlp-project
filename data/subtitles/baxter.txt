2
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,567
Imagine that you're watching the end
of one of those old romantic movies.

3
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:55,605
It's the story of a man and a woman
who are destined to be together...

4
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:59,362
only they're divided by circumstances
beyond their control.

5
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:10,874
We're now at the part where the leading lady
has decided to marry the wrong guy.

6
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:14,272
He's nice, but he's wrong for her
and everyone knows it...

7
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:16,790
everyone except for the groom himself.

8
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,348
It's kind of tragic when you think about it...

9
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:24,145
spending the rest of your life
with someone you're not in love with.

10
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,182
Please be seated.

11
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,540
Good afternoon.

12
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,137
We are gathered here today
to bring these two people together...

13
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,456
in holy matrimony...

14
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:40,654
Just as you think she's about to make...

15
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,533
the biggest mistake of her life...

16
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:44,452
...these two people being married...

17
00:01:44,492 --> 00:01:48,129
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

18
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,328
Caroline!

19
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:51,967
...the leading man barges
through the doors.

20
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:53,366
Bradley.

21
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:56,484
I got on a plane
and I flew all the way back to Malta.

22
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:58,762
But then I realized something.

23
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:02,759
But did you ever wonder about the guy
left at the altar? The wrong guy?

24
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,677
My grandmother had a word
for those kind of guys: "nice guys. "

25
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:10,434
Old-fashioned guys.
The kind of guys who wear sock garters.

26
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:13,432
Guys who get hay fever
and like raking leaves.

27
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:17,629
The kind of guy you settle for
because you can't be with the one you love.

28
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:22,266
She called them Baxters. Well, I'm a Baxter.

29
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,465
And this is my story.

30
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,976
It all started a year and a half ago
on Monday...

31
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,095
my favorite day of the week.

32
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:41,573
That's when I met Caroline Swann.

33
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:44,611
And she was no ugly duckling, I might add.

34
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:47,170
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:53,445
So, Miss Swann...

36
00:02:53,685 --> 00:02:55,724
you know your father
was my very first client.

37
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:57,802
He has an eye for talent.

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,038
So you work for Manhattan Style magazine?

39
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:07,916
It's true, although sometimes it feels like
they work for me.

40
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,315
I don't doubt that at all.

41
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:11,513
Actually, I was just appointed
editor in chief.

42
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:12,592
Really?

43
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:15,231
You creative types are so impressive to me.

44
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,830
- Thank you.
- Un momento.

45
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,947
That's Cecil Mills, my temporary secretary.

46
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:23,425
I guess the story really started
earlier that morning, when I met her.

47
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:25,024
I was in my office chatting...

48
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:27,782
with my colleague
and fellow Baxter, Wendall Wimms.

49
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:31,180
Two tickets
to the Brooklyn String Quartet, Ell.

50
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,857
I don't know, Wendall.
Thanks for offering though.

51
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:36,856
Suit yourself, Ell.

52
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,173
- I'm just trying to help.
- I know.

53
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,011
Yes?

54
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,849
Hi, I'm the temp.

55
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:51,446
Hi. I'm Elliot.

56
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,005
Hi. Cecil.

57
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,883
This is my colleague, Wendall Wimms.

58
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:58,362
- Hello.
- Hi.

59
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:00,120
Please come in.

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,478
I'm so sorry I'm late. But I'm new to the city.
I'm just learning the trains...

61
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,076
plus the rain.

62
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:10,434
- Please don't fire me.
- No, not at all.

63
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,272
- Take off your coat. Get warm.
- Okay.

64
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:14,831
Wendall...

65
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,270
Where are you from?

66
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,828
I'm from Fergus Falls, Minnesota.
Have you heard of it?

67
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:20,986
It's in Otter Tail County?

68
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:23,145
It's the large kitchen parts capital
of the world.

69
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:24,224
Really?

70
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:27,302
I'm the first person in my family ever
to go east of the Mississippi.

71
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:31,819
- I only just got here two weeks ago.
- I have an aunt who was married in Mankato.

72
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,854
I'm going to go into my office.

73
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,530
- It was very nice to meet you, Cecil.
- Likewise.

74
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,048
I will see you later, Elliot.

75
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:52,645
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
My full time secretary Betty has the flu.

76
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:57,082
No, I should be the one thanking you.
You don't know how badly I needed this job.

77
00:04:58,361 --> 00:04:59,600
Excuse me.

78
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,359
- Thank you.
- Here.

79
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,917
Think I've caught a bit of a cold.

80
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:10,593
Anyway...

81
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:14,550
- it's a pleasure to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

82
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,588
- Here, I'll show you to your office.
- Let me just...

83
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:24,464
This is your desk.

84
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:27,302
Just let me know if you need anything.

85
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:31,459
I hope you don't mind if I just take a
moment here to personalize my work space.

86
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:36,935
If you don't mind me asking,
what's the dictionary for?

87
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:40,973
You won't believe this but it's actually
what I'm reading at the moment.

88
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,292
- I know-
- Wait!

89
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:46,409
Before you say anything else I need you to
know, that I am also reading the dictionary.

90
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:47,848
- Really?
- Yes.

91
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:51,645
- What letter are you up to?
- Right now I'm working my way through "G."

92
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,764
"G." "G" is a classic.

93
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:57,002
You know,
I particularly liked the word "gromwell. "

94
00:05:57,601 --> 00:05:59,720
A type of plant bearing yellowish flowers...

95
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,839
- and white stony nutlets.
- And white stony nutlets.

96
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:03,438
I love that word.

97
00:06:03,477 --> 00:06:06,795
Actually, I've been looking
for a real gromwell all over the city...

98
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,433
but I can't seem to find one.
So far it's just a lot of concrete.

99
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:15,429
- Though I haven't yet been to Chinatown.
- So, we both read the dictionary.

100
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,268
It's a truly bizarre coincidence.

101
00:06:18,347 --> 00:06:20,346
- Providential.
- Fortuitous!

102
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,625
Happenstancial.

103
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:23,624
- Felicitous.
- Another big word.

104
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:31,818
Miss Mills, I realize we only just met...

105
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,537
but, after work, if you're not busy...

106
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:36,615
- would you like-
- Excuse me...

107
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:39,533
- are you Elliot Sherman?
- Yes.

108
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:43,051
- How can I help you?
- Would I like to what, Mr. Sherman?

109
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:45,169
- You were going to ask me a question.
- I was?

110
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:48,087
I'm Caroline Swann,
your 10:00 appointment.

111
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,286
Yes. Miss Swann, of course.

112
00:06:50,406 --> 00:06:53,804
- I hope I wasn't interrupting.
- No, no, not at all.

113
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:58,600
I'll show you to my office. Miss Mills,
would you hold all my calls, please?

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,919
Come with me.

115
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:04,396
And, we'll need some coffee. Some coffee.

116
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:07,275
You creative types are so impressive to me.

117
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:10,792
Thank you. Then again,
when it comes to crunching numbers...

118
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:13,590
- I am all thumbs.
- Well, fear not.

119
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,268
Enter Elliot Sherman, CPA!

120
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:23,064
Elliot, Daddy said you were nice.
He didn't say you were funny, too.

121
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,098
So Daddy tells me you were a Harvard boy.

122
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:35,695
Harvard Business. I did my
undergraduate studies at Dartmouth.

123
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,174
- I went to Dartmouth.
- You didn't.

124
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,453
- I did.
- What a coincidence.

125
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,731
Next thing I know you'll be telling me
you jog for exercise.

126
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:46,768
- I actually speed walk.
- You speed walk and I jog.

127
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,766
- That is a serious coincidence.
- Yes.

128
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,324
- Sort of.
- Yeah.

129
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:57,841
Darn it. Elliot, I have a 10:30 power breakfast
with the features editor at Better Homes.

130
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,879
We haven't even started talking
about my forms.

131
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,278
Oh, well that's too bad.

132
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,876
Perhaps you would be willing to continue...

133
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,554
the discussion of my forms
later this evening?

134
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:10,512
- Say, over dinner?
- Yes. That sounds good.

135
00:08:10,552 --> 00:08:14,469
Perfect. I'll have my assistant's
intern's assistant's intern...

136
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:17,867
book a reservation
and then e-mail you to confirm.

137
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,864
Perfect.

138
00:08:23,144 --> 00:08:26,581
It seemed hard to believe
that Caroline Gwendolyn Swann...

139
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:30,898
would actually be interested in me,
Elliot Wilbur Sherman.

140
00:08:32,937 --> 00:08:34,576
Elliot Sherman.

141
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,454
Who knew?

142
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:41,451
Then again, we Baxters do move
in mysterious ways.

143
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,329
It was the happiest time of my life.

144
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:46,728
Work was going gangbusters.

145
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:50,285
I had just landed
the big Gildon's Cough Drop account.

146
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:54,323
I'd found my dream home,
the top floor of a Brooklyn brownstone.

147
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,441
And I rose every morning with the sun.

148
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:59,519
I was in the best physical
and mental shape of my life.

149
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:03,796
I exercised rigorously with my best friend
and next door neighbor, Ed.

150
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:08,633
Elliot, the feeling one gets
from the crisp, cold jet stream of air...

151
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:10,432
rushing across one's face...

152
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:13,230
as he walks down the street
at speeds in excess...

153
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,588
of two, three, or even four miles per hour.

154
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,905
Caroline and I began courting exclusively.

155
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:23,503
Our compatibility rating was off the chart.

156
00:09:23,903 --> 00:09:26,781
The relationship was spontaneous
and impulsive.

157
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,858
I showed her my beloved Brooklyn.

158
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,296
Settled by the Dutch in the 1640s...

159
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:36,974
now home to such modern marvels
as the stoop.

160
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:40,012
We were desperately in love, she and I.

161
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:44,968
Young Turks drawn together by
an undefinable force of animal magnetism.

162
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:46,847
- Good night.
- Good night.

163
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,483
The fruit was ripe for the plucking.

164
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:55,441
I asked her to marry me and she agreed.

165
00:09:56,161 --> 00:10:00,558
A few of my colleagues from the office even
got together and threw me a little shindig.

166
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:04,915
There's a little rumor going around the
office that you've upgraded your Palm Pilot.

167
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,234
Is it true?

168
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,673
Guilty as charged, Bob.

169
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,631
Guilty as charged.

170
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,309
Everything was perfect until one week ago...

171
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:15,908
when we visited Caroline's hometown
in Connecticut.

172
00:10:17,027 --> 00:10:19,945
That's when Hurricane Bradley
blew in off the coast.

173
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:22,743
A toast...

174
00:10:23,343 --> 00:10:26,501
to Caroline and Elliot
on their pending nuptials.

175
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,297
By this time next week,
Elliot, I will be proud to call you "son. "

176
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:35,015
God, I'm getting all choked up here.

177
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:36,934
- Sweetie.
- Daddy.

178
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:40,811
Anyway, cheers to Caroline and Elliot.

179
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,290
Cheers.

180
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,207
By the way, this fine crystal
we're drinking the bubbly out of...

181
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,486
was made possible by a refund...

182
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,364
Elliot got me last year for Christmas.

183
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:54,801
He said, "Alan, stop risking your money...

184
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:56,880
"and start frisking your money. "

185
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,199
Elliot.

186
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,596
It's a lot less fun for me
but it sure does pay off.

187
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,835
Well, Alan, it's like I always say:

188
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,473
"Compromise is the key to success. "

189
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:09,392
Here, here!

190
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,628
So, Elliot, tell us. Where
are you two going on your honeymoon?

191
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,027
- Have you decided yet?
- Yes, we have.

192
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:19,385
Yellowstone National Park...

193
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:25,101
for one whole week of camping,
lake fishing, and guided tours.

194
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,178
I wanted to go to Majorca for the
beautiful beaches, fine dining and nightlife.

195
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:33,735
- Elliot and I have never been dancing.
- Oh, that's too bad.

196
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,534
I have two left feet.

197
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,493
No, you don't.

198
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:39,611
I have webbed feet.

199
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:41,330
So it's Yellowstone.

200
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,207
- Watch out for bears, you two.
- Yes, good advice.

201
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:49,405
I hear bears can smell menstrual blood
from a mile away.

202
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:54,441
So, Caroline...

203
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,040
what's this thing
you all are doing after dinner?

204
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
Some of my high school friends...

205
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,917
are throwing us
a little shindig at Andy's Tavern.

206
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,836
Most of them have never met Elliot before.

207
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,994
- Oh, that should be fun.
- Yeah.

208
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:08,752
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen many of them in years, either.

209
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:10,990
I need to go upstairs and primp.

210
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:15,827
- Girls will be girls.
- I guess that means we're finished eating.

211
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:21,463
It's like I always say, communication
is the key to a great relationship.

212
00:12:21,503 --> 00:12:24,261
And if you've got something to say,
just say it.

213
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,696
Caroline! I need to talk to you!

214
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:34,734
I need to talk to you, Caroline!

215
00:12:35,534 --> 00:12:37,452
What has gotten into you, Elliot?

216
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:41,570
Caroline, I saw photographs of you
and your high school sweetheart Bradley.

217
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:43,968
Potsdamer Platz.

218
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:48,605
Here's another one.
My family loves to have their picture taken...

219
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,684
in front of famous street signs.

220
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,802
- Here we are in front of Fleet Street.
- Right.

221
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:54,921
Here we are in front of the Champs Elysees.

222
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:58,998
Now, are these photographs from that big
trip you all took to Europe back in 1987?

223
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,596
- Exactly.
- It sounded like quite an adventure.

224
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,274
Caroline's told me all about
the Russian couple...

225
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,073
you befriended in Moscow.

226
00:13:06,193 --> 00:13:08,192
Olaf and Mirabelle.

227
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,550
- She told you about them?
- Oh, yes.

228
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,308
Caroline and I share everything.
We have no secrets.

229
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:17,505
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Yes.

230
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:23,541
- And this...
- And this must be your grandparents'...

231
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:26,419
summer home in Virginia Beach.

232
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:28,938
Caroline's told me many a story...

233
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:32,096
about Nana's barn parties.

234
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:35,853
And Noonoo's all night
ping pong tournaments.

235
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:40,450
- I must say, it sounds like so much fun.
- Oh, so, so much fun.

236
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,648
And this must be...

237
00:13:46,686 --> 00:13:48,085
This must be...

238
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,042
Who's this?

239
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:54,960
It's Caroline and Bradley.

240
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,838
Caroline and who?

241
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,275
You don't know about Bradley?

242
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,554
Even I know about Bradley.

243
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,592
They were practically inseparable
all through high school.

244
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,511
He was the love of her life.

245
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,829
I mean, besides you, of course.

246
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:16,026
- That's what this is about?
- I thought we had no secrets, honey.

247
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:20,263
- We don't. That was fifteen years ago.
- Just tell me. I need to know.

248
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:23,581
- Are you still in love with him?
- No!

249
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:26,139
Bradley and I have completely lost touch.

250
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,577
Elliot, I never think of him. Ever.
He lives in Lillehammer.

251
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:31,296
- Really?
- Yes.

252
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:34,734
It would take an act of God
for us to ever cross paths again.

253
00:14:35,013 --> 00:14:37,532
- Caroline?
- Bradley?

254
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,809
- What are you doing...
- What are you doing...

255
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:44,407
- I'm here on business.
- I'm getting married.

256
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,125
Hey, hon.

257
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:52,602
Sonya, this is Caroline.
Caroline, Sonya. This is my new girlfriend.

258
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:55,639
- Hi.
- Bradley's told me so much about you.

259
00:14:57,358 --> 00:15:00,436
- You all right?
- I must be allergic to something in here.

260
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,469
Elliot. This is my fiance Bradley.

261
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:13,348
Shoot, I mean...

262
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:16,985
Bradley, this is my fiance Elliot.

263
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:22,981
Elliot, nice to meet you.
You must be a special, special guy.

264
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,258
- God, it's good to see you.
- You, too.

265
00:15:28,657 --> 00:15:32,175
As I commuted to work the next day,
I decided to focus on the positive.

266
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:36,772
I've got a good job, great health,
and a fiancee who likes me.

267
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,567
John, Juan, Jan, Jonah.

268
00:15:58,517 --> 00:15:59,756
Mr. Sherman?

269
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,034
Cecil. Mills.

270
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:06,592
- The temp.
- Yes. You remembered.

271
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:08,431
What are you doing here?

272
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,229
I'm temping for a dentist on the 7th floor.

273
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,947
Oh, yeah. Jim Dudley. Good guy.

274
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:17,624
- Here, let me help you up.
- Thank you.

275
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:25,099
- You're stepping on my toe.
- Sorry.

276
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:38,250
So Miss Mills, how have you been?

277
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,368
- It's been at least a year.
- Good. I've been good.

278
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,408
Good.

279
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:46,325
I finally figured out how the subways work.
I can go uptown, downtown, cross-town.

280
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,884
That's great.

281
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:52,121
Plus I got my own apartment
in Washington Heights.

282
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,078
Sometimes I miss the sky,
but I love the crazy people.

283
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:00,236
- How about you? How have you been?
- Me?

284
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:03,553
I'm good. Very good.
Nothing much to report.

285
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,507
My fiancee is leaving me for another man.

286
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:16,585
Oh, no. What happened?

287
00:17:16,665 --> 00:17:20,102
It's a long story, Miss Mills.
I don't want to waste your time.

288
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:21,821
Please, I don't mind.

289
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,538
Okay. Well, it all started 15 years ago
at my senior prom.

290
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,177
See, there was this girl.

291
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,655
It was the last dance of the night.

292
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:33,773
- Kimberly, would you...
- Yes?

293
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:37,131
like some more soda?

294
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:40,449
Okay. Sure.

295
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:44,726
So, while I was mixing drinks,
Max Webster, who was incredibly popular...

296
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:47,364
barges through the doors
and sweeps my date off her feet.

297
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:48,723
Kimberly.

298
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:52,481
- Max, what are you doing here?
- I realized something.

299
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,199
I realized that being cool...

300
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,877
isn't about what kind
of a spliff you can roll at a party...

301
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:00,755
or how good I look tick-tacking
on my skateboard.

302
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:04,432
Being cool is about who you are.
And I know you broke your leg.

303
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:07,510
But what I really want to know is...

304
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:10,588
will you dance with me?

305
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,826
Yes, Max. I would love to dance with you.

306
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,704
Max and Kimberly lived happily ever after.

307
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:21,061
But then, I went to college
and gave love another shot.

308
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,779
- Are you cold, Serena?
- A little.

309
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:25,858
I'll go to the car and fetch your coat.

310
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,817
But the car is so far away.

311
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,015
Well, I'd give you my coat
but it's way too big for you.

312
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:33,333
I don't mind if it's too big.

313
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,292
And I don't mind going to get the coat.

314
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:38,370
Give it up for the captain
of the lacrosse team, Tanner Bates!

315
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,247
I was gonna come up here and talk
about how tough the Big Green are...

316
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:47,483
but I've realized
that I'm not quite as tough as I think am.

317
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,961
- You see there's this girl.
- No!

318
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,839
And on Saturday afternoon
she's trying to win a scholarship to Julliard.

319
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:58,796
So, I encourage all of you
to skip the lacrosse game with me...

320
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,354
and come out to the recital hall
and root her on!

321
00:19:01,434 --> 00:19:03,793
- Oh, Tanner!
- Serena.

322
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,187
Serena, I realized that if winning
a big game means losing you...

323
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:17,184
- then I don't want to play the game.
- God, Tanner, that's beautiful.

324
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:20,701
You look cold. Here, take my sweater.

325
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,619
He skipped the lacrosse game
to watch her Julliard tryout?

326
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,737
Yeah. They lived happily ever after, too.

327
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:29,575
So after that, I went to business school.

328
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:31,654
And fell for Camryn.

329
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,692
She also had an ex-boyfriend...

330
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:35,971
Hunter.

331
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,209
He had a dog with him.

332
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,728
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

333
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:45,045
Which brings us to this morning
at Caroline's parents' house.

334
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:46,724
Caroline!

335
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:50,641
Elliot, are you all right?

336
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,439
I had this terrible dream last night...

337
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,678
that Bradley was at the bar.

338
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:58,796
- He was at the bar, honey.
- He was?

339
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:03,153
My God, it wasn't a dream.

340
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:09,588
Honey, just hear me out, okay?
I've really been thinking about this.

341
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:10,947
We should get married right away.

342
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:13,146
Tonight, tomorrow at the latest.
You know, we could elope.

343
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:16,264
- I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas.
- No! Elliot, stop it!

344
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:17,823
You're scaring me.

345
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:28,136
Now, Elliot, I'm bringing the new wedding
planner by the apartment tomorrow.

346
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:29,695
He's really bailing us out last minute.

347
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,693
I mean, Jacob was supposed to be
the best wedding planner in the city.

348
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,651
We profiled him in last year's
winter double issue.

349
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:38,889
And then he just disappeared.
How's that for loyalty?

350
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,645
Anyway, this new planner
comes highly recommended.

351
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:47,603
He gave us a questionnaire
we're supposed to fill out.

352
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:50,041
I'm putting it in your briefcase.

353
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,038
Please fill it out, Elliot.
It's really important to me.

354
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:59,275
He's coming by at 9:00 tomorrow.
So no sleeping in, silly face.

355
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:01,913
God, he's good.

356
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,468
My gosh, it's Bradley.

357
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,667
Still leaving your key under the mat.

358
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:15,224
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

359
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:19,102
So Bradley, what brings you by?

360
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,860
Well, I was hoping I could get a lift
into the Big Apple.

361
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,298
I've got some obligations to attend to.

362
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:29,175
Obligations? What sort of obligations?
What's your line of work anyway, Brad?

363
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,933
- Geodes.
- Geodes?

364
00:21:32,093 --> 00:21:33,212
Yeah.

365
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,810
It's like a hollow rock lined with crystals.

366
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:42,366
- And you sell them?
- No. My job is to discover how they form.

367
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,045
I'm a scientist.

368
00:21:44,325 --> 00:21:46,203
- That's noble.
- Noble? God, no.

369
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:47,882
Noble nothing. I made millions.

370
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:51,560
Anyway, the reason I need to get into
the city is when I'm in town I got a gig...

371
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,358
at an old folks' home out at Ditmas Park.

372
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,597
I bring my geodes
and let them pass them around.

373
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:58,715
- That's wonderful, Bradley.
- Yeah, it's nice.

374
00:21:59,794 --> 00:22:03,751
You know, old people aren't really revered
in this culture the way they should be.

375
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:08,388
Since my mom died I've just enjoyed
hanging around with the elderly.

376
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:11,746
So much wisdom there.

377
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,344
Anyway...

378
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,022
What about you, Eli? What do you do?

379
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:21,659
Elliot works for the second best
tax accounting firm in the city.

380
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,698
That's where he's headed this morning.

381
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:26,616
Yes, indeed. I have a deadline to attend to.

382
00:22:26,696 --> 00:22:30,813
An accountant. God, I could use you.
Actually, I could use seven of you.

383
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,849
Anyway, how about that ride?

384
00:22:37,928 --> 00:22:40,647
Well, I'm staying another night
with my folks...

385
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:44,164
but Elliot's going into the city.
He can drive you. Elbow?

386
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:47,002
Okay. Yes. Sure.

387
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:50,680
I'll just go out into the hallway...

388
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,438
put my driving cap on
and then we can head off.

389
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,637
Great.

390
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,189
You look great, carrot.

391
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:11,066
- How about this weather, huh?
- Yeah.

392
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:13,545
You remember that blizzard?

393
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:14,784
- Sophomore year.
- Yeah.

394
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:16,223
We got snowed in.

395
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,981
It was so cold.

396
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,738
- I remember getting naked to keep warm.
- Yeah.

397
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,216
- And I slipped you my big, fat-
- Hey! Let's...

398
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:29,134
get that load on the road, shall we, champs?

399
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:32,452
Bradley.

400
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:36,889
- And Caroline, I'll call you later, honey.
- All right.

401
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:49,480
Elliot, has this ever happened to you?

402
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,319
What's that, Bradley?

403
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:56,636
You're living your life, chugging along,
and then suddenly something...

404
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:01,192
unexpected happens.
Heartbeat. Your whole world changes.

405
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:04,790
Like what would be an example
of one of those unexpected things?

406
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,069
Well, I guess like...

407
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:12,185
seeing Caroline after so many years
would be a good example.

408
00:24:13,264 --> 00:24:16,142
What's... Give me another example.

409
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:21,099
See, that's kind of the example
that comes to mind right now.

410
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,458
Okay.

411
00:24:22,538 --> 00:24:23,897
It's, like, sometimes destiny calls...

412
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:27,175
you either answer the call or you hang up
the phone. You know what I'm saying?

413
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:29,533
- I hope not.
- Unexpected things happen, Elliot.

414
00:24:29,573 --> 00:24:31,892
- When they do you need to make a decision.
- Do you, though?

415
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,890
The question is: are you going to act?
Or are you just gonna sit there...

416
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,768
and let possibly the biggest decision
of your life just pass you by?

417
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:40,966
- You just sit there. You need the rest.
- No.

418
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:43,804
- You act. Am I right? You risk everything.
- Why?

419
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:46,722
- Why do you do that?
- Because you're a great guy...

420
00:24:46,802 --> 00:24:48,681
and you have nothing to lose.

421
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,229
Thank you.

422
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:14,703
God, it feels so good to get this stuff...

423
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:17,581
off my chest, you know.

424
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:24,217
Thank you, Elliot. You really helped me.
I don't have...

425
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:29,693
You know, I don't have a lot of guy friends
that I can talk to about this stuff.

426
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:33,810
You're welcome.

427
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,049
It's like I'm...

428
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:39,606
It's like I'm too sensitive, you know?

429
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:43,564
It's like I'm missing a layer of skin
or something. You know?

430
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:48,920
It's like I let too much in.

431
00:25:57,834 --> 00:26:02,031
So Bradley got out of my car.
He said, "Thanks for the lift, Ell train"...

432
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:03,230
and that was that.

433
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,269
And all this makes you think
that you're a Baxter?

434
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,068
Yeah. Silly, right?

435
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:10,985
Personally, I don't believe in Baxters.

436
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,062
Although did you and your prom date
dance at all that night?

437
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:17,381
No. She was on crutches.

438
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,099
What?

439
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,936
This is my floor. Mr. Sherman, I've got to go.

440
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:27,534
What were you going to say?
Dr. Dudley hates it when we're tardy.

441
00:26:27,774 --> 00:26:31,531
Please, what were you going to say?
I'd really like to know, Miss Mills.

442
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:33,130
Mr. Sherman...

443
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:46,641
I'll be at this address tonight
if you feel like finishing this conversation.

444
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,039
Wait! What is this place?

445
00:26:52,038 --> 00:26:54,276
So, Elliot, let me get this straight.

446
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:58,273
You met some temp in an elevator.
She starts to say something, doesn't say it.

447
00:26:58,353 --> 00:27:01,311
And now you want to go out
in the middle of the night to find her...

448
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:03,230
so she can, what?

449
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,789
So she can finish her sentence?

450
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:07,547
Elliot, you've got my knickers
all up in a pinch here.

451
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:08,986
I don't know, Ed.

452
00:27:09,106 --> 00:27:12,464
I don't know. I feel like maybe
she could help me or cure me.

453
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:15,861
- Will you talk to him, Stella?
- Maybe your Feng Shui is off.

454
00:27:15,941 --> 00:27:16,941
Maybe.

455
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:19,019
You know, she's got a friend
who could do your chart.

456
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:20,299
No, it's a wheel.

457
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:22,617
Ed, it's not a chart. It's a wheel.

458
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,015
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

459
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:29,612
Here, Elliot, have some more wine.

460
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:33,889
This is an Acorn Creek pinot noir 2002.

461
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:35,928
Go on.

462
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:41,125
Notice how the rich cherry
and raspberry fruit dominate the nose.

463
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:43,883
It's bold...

464
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:47,080
with a sweetly edged meaty complexity.

465
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,438
Stella's taking a wine-tasting class
at the YMCA.

466
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:53,396
"W," Ed. The YWCA.

467
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:56,474
Look, you want help? Go see a doctor.

468
00:27:56,554 --> 00:27:59,232
You want trouble, you go see this girl.
Am I right, Stella?

469
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:01,431
No. I think it sounds interesting.

470
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,388
Go with your gut, Elliot.
That's what you should do.

471
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:06,827
Excuse me.

472
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:15,341
Here's what I think you should do...

473
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,620
Can you please turn that down?

474
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,819
How's this?

475
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,015
God, I love that woman.

476
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:29,212
Here's what I think you should do.
I think you should take that address...

477
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:32,010
I think you should rip it up,
I think you should throw it away...

478
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,528
and I think you should forget this whole
thing ever happened. That's what I think.

479
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,366
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

480
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:41,044
Elliot, all you need is a good night's sleep.

481
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:44,722
Yeah. What was I thinking?

482
00:28:45,881 --> 00:28:49,359
That's what friends are for.
Come on, give your Uncle Ed a hug.

483
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:54,075
Come on, give Uncle Ed a hug.
Let's go. Chop chop.

484
00:28:57,873 --> 00:29:00,431
- You're hurting me, Ed.
- Go get some shuteye.

485
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:02,470
Good night, Elliot.

486
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,189
- Ed?
- Yeah, baby?

487
00:29:07,187 --> 00:29:10,464
In the dictionary
the word irrational is defined as:

488
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,942
"Affected by loss of usual
or normal mental clarity.

489
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:16,780
"Incoherent, as from shock. "

490
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:36,487
This is crazy. This is crazy.

491
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:08,985
I thought she sang like a beautiful bird.

492
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:13,862
Like a purple sandpiper,
or a rose-breasted grosbeak.

493
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:28,812
Cecil Mills everybody. Cecil Mills!

494
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:32,689
Guys, I think I hear the turkey phone.

495
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:36,646
That means we only have one more act
and I'm gonna go get her right now...

496
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:39,005
Mr. Sherman. You made it.

497
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:42,203
Yes. I was in the neighborhood
so I figured I'd pop my head in the door.

498
00:30:42,283 --> 00:30:44,001
I'm happy you came.

499
00:30:44,961 --> 00:30:47,959
- So, you're a singer?
- Yeah.

500
00:30:50,637 --> 00:30:53,915
That was terrible.
I'm really sorry you had to see that.

501
00:30:55,674 --> 00:30:59,551
The sound system here is unbearable.
Really I could hardly hear myself.

502
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:03,109
And I usually have a guitar player
but he's in the hospital.

503
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,508
He's very old.

504
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:07,546
He's fine and everything.
I went to go visit him, but you know...

505
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:12,063
Normally, I'm just better. I'm not saying I'm
very good, but I usually am better than...

506
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:16,180
- You say something.
- I thought you were really great.

507
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:19,178
Really? Thanks.

508
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:23,375
My boyfriend thinks I'm wasting my time.

509
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:27,972
- Oh, you have a boyfriend?
- Yeah. Dan. He's nice.

510
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:30,170
He couldn't make it.

511
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,569
- Do you wanna sit down?
- Yeah.

512
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:33,608
Okay.

513
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:46,080
So, Miss Mills, I should tell you
that I disagree with your boyfriend.

514
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,518
I don't think you're wasting your time.

515
00:31:49,477 --> 00:31:50,996
I appreciate that.

516
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:53,635
All right guys,
guess who was on the turkey phone?

517
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:56,313
I don't know. An interpretative dancer?

518
00:31:56,393 --> 00:32:00,110
That's right, we have an interpretative
dancer here tonight to end the show, guys.

519
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,548
Put your hands together.
Put your hands together for Exar.

520
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:06,666
Hi, can I get a beer?
Whatever's on tap and cheap.

521
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:09,224
Hi. I'll have a Harvey Wallbanger.

522
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:12,862
No actually,
make that a white wine spritzer. Thanks.

523
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:15,780
It's almost spring.

524
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:27,612
So, Miss Mills, tell me about your singing.

525
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,087
It's good. I mean, it's good. You know it's...

526
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,244
What?

527
00:32:41,402 --> 00:32:44,560
- It's the stage fright.
- Really?

528
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,358
- What, you didn't notice?
- No.

529
00:32:47,438 --> 00:32:48,438
Really?

530
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:52,875
Ever since I started singing
my own material in front of people...

531
00:32:52,955 --> 00:32:55,993
I feel like I've developed a problem
with stage fright.

532
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,710
I feel like I'm naked...

533
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,468
and shaking and underwater.

534
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:06,066
What about you?

535
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:09,384
Did you always know
that you wanted to be an accountant?

536
00:33:09,504 --> 00:33:13,021
Sort of. I always knew
that I wanted steady employment.

537
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:17,218
It's also got very good benefits.
Plus I get a paid vacation.

538
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:22,255
Plus I like numbers.
So I feel like I'm helping people. Gracias.

539
00:33:37,085 --> 00:33:38,484
Guys, that's the end of the show.

540
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:41,242
But listen, it only gets started
'cause we have a party!

541
00:33:41,322 --> 00:33:44,000
We have a party right here, right now!
So everybody stick around!

542
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,078
- Let's start the music!
- What do you say, Mr. Sherman?

543
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:48,797
I think I'm okay.

544
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:50,756
I should probably get going.

545
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:54,194
No. It could be fun. When was the last time
that you were at a real party?

546
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:58,031
Well, we have backwards jeans day
at my office...

547
00:33:58,111 --> 00:34:01,429
which is fun because we get to wear
our jeans on backwards.

548
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:03,148
What about if you just finish this drink...

549
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:06,265
and if you're not having fun
you can leave, I promise.

550
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:07,784
Okay.

551
00:34:09,703 --> 00:34:13,541
I'm allergic to peanuts and lint and cereal...

552
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,259
and paint, magic markers...

553
00:34:17,058 --> 00:34:19,696
sand mats, yogurt...

554
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:21,655
Because I met this girl...

555
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:26,172
who got a job whistling a jingle
for a commercial...

556
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:29,130
and she made tons of money.
She does the...

557
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:37,085
So I was thinking that I could sign up
for a class at HG Studios...

558
00:34:37,165 --> 00:34:39,483
because it's a real craft, whistling.

559
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,079
Cecil, I have to ask you a question!

560
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:51,235
What were you going to say to me
in the elevator?

561
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:54,873
It's too loud in here!

562
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:57,671
Come on.

563
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:03,667
Where are we going?

564
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:13,180
- Better?
- Much.

565
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:17,977
- Elliot?
- Yes.

566
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:22,494
I think this alcohol is going to my head.

567
00:35:23,374 --> 00:35:25,372
So, I would just like to apologize
in advance...

568
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:28,570
for anything that I may say
or do from this point forward.

569
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,609
Okay.

570
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,567
- I like your tie.
- Thank you.

571
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:36,445
It was a gift from my mother...

572
00:35:37,164 --> 00:35:38,563
for Christmas.

573
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:43,200
It's from the Fricke,
from the Dutch Masters Collection.

574
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,239
- I like it.
- Thank you.

575
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:50,595
Miss Mills, you were going to tell me what
you were going to say in the elevator.

576
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:51,635
Okay.

577
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,111
Here's what I was going to say.

578
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,747
- Elliot, I have a theory.
- Yes?

579
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,065
You were supposed to ask her to dance.

580
00:36:07,184 --> 00:36:09,702
- What are you talking about?
- At your prom.

581
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,621
You were supposed to ask her to dance.

582
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:14,699
It was the last song of the night.
All the other kids were dancing.

583
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,538
You should have asked her to dance.

584
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:20,135
- But she was on crutches.
- But it was a slow song, Elliot.

585
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:25,052
- She seemed happy to me.
- She was content, not happy.

586
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:29,209
See, Elliot, ultimately the problem is
that you're not willing to take risks.

587
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:31,648
You've got to be willing to take risks.

588
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,486
You're right.

589
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,604
I've got to take more risks.

590
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,761
It's so obvious but I couldn't see it.

591
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:46,598
My God.

592
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:49,755
What?

593
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:52,314
This is the song.

594
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:55,072
This is the song they were playing
at my prom.

595
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,507
Ask her to dance, Elliot.

596
00:37:03,826 --> 00:37:04,825
Cecil...

597
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,183
would you...

598
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,781
Other people need to use the bathroom.

599
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,819
- I should probably go.
- I should go home.

600
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,377
Yeah. We should both go.

601
00:37:18,856 --> 00:37:19,935
Okay.

602
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:23,852
I hope I was able to help you
with your problem.

603
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:26,011
Oh yes, definitely. Very much so.

604
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:29,249
Ask her to dance. Very good advice.

605
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:31,208
Listen...

606
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:33,286
here's my card.

607
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:37,923
If ever I can repay the favor just...

608
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:41,001
call anytime. Really.

609
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:44,079
I'm going to write
my home phone number on it.

610
00:37:45,118 --> 00:37:47,716
Call me anytime if you need anything.

611
00:37:49,915 --> 00:37:52,193
- Okay.
- Good night.

612
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:55,871
I'll be off then.

613
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:09,622
You've reached Elliot Sherman.
Please leave a message. Thank you.

614
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:12,660
Elliot, it's Cecil.
Can you please pick up the phone?

615
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:15,778
Cecil?

616
00:38:15,897 --> 00:38:18,296
- You said I could call you anytime?
- What happened?

617
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,494
It's just really hard, you know.

618
00:38:21,574 --> 00:38:24,771
I mean, normally, Dan and I don't fight.
We really don't.

619
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:28,209
But I just wish that he would
come to hear me sing, you know.

620
00:38:28,969 --> 00:38:32,406
It would just be nice to look out into the
audience and see a familiar face...

621
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:35,644
but he says that my stage fright
makes him uncomfortable.

622
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,961
I think I'm very supportive of him.

623
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:44,718
He wants to analyze systems,
which I think is fantastic.

624
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:48,635
And you know what he thinks
I'd be good at? Sales.

625
00:38:51,713 --> 00:38:55,311
Doesn't he understand I played Annie
in my high school production of Annie?

626
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:58,269
Not one, not two, but three times in a row.

627
00:38:59,108 --> 00:39:02,146
Miss Mills, we sort of have to keep it down
'cause of the neighbors.

628
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:03,785
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

629
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:06,064
Here let me help you with those.

630
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,060
I got it. It's okay. I got it.

631
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:24,691
Do you have something that I could
sleep in maybe, like a sweatshirt?

632
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,728
Sometimes it sticks. Thank you.

633
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:35,524
- I have pajamas.
- Yeah. Pajamas would be great.

634
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:36,683
Pajamas.

635
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,278
Do you play the piano?

636
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:51,593
I dabble.

637
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:54,111
Here, take your pick.

638
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:58,868
- I'll pick these. They look like the tape.
- Yeah. Good choice.

639
00:39:58,908 --> 00:39:59,907
Thanks.

640
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:03,305
Okay.

641
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:17,815
This really is a great apartment.

642
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:23,492
I like it. It's very practical.

643
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:24,931
Thank you.

644
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,408
- Can I put these on in there?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

645
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:39,321
Boy, I haven't been this tipsy in a long time.

646
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
And I...

647
00:40:44,637 --> 00:40:47,316
I haven't been up this late since...

648
00:40:47,595 --> 00:40:50,314
business school, final exams, probably.

649
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:01,226
These are great.

650
00:41:08,461 --> 00:41:11,060
- They suit you perfectly.
- Thank you.

651
00:41:16,736 --> 00:41:20,453
- Okay. See you in the morning, Cecil.
- See you in the morning.

652
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:32,605
- Good night, Cecil.
- Good night, Elliot.

653
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:52,032
Okay, we're here. This is it.

654
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:02,705
Ell?

655
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:06,342
It's like a railroad apartment. Choo choo.

656
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:09,460
- Hi, honey.
- There you are.

657
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,177
Elliot, hi.
This is Benson the wedding planner.

658
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:16,416
Benson Hedges, nice to meet you.

659
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:18,654
Very nice to meet you, too, Benson...

660
00:42:19,174 --> 00:42:20,173
Hedges.

661
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:22,891
Come, sit down. Sit down.

662
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,329
What's up with the cushions?

663
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:31,366
This is what my shlong free chart
says I should do.

664
00:42:31,446 --> 00:42:33,724
- What did you say?
- Feng Shui.

665
00:42:34,124 --> 00:42:35,243
Yeah. What he said.

666
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:38,201
Feng Shui.
I didn't know you were into that, Elliot.

667
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:42,638
Can I get us all something to drink?
Coffee? Tea? Milk? Apple juice?

668
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:45,356
- I'll have tea.
- I would love an apple juice.

669
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,355
Great.

670
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:56,029
I love the walls. Very mustard. Dijon.

671
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,986
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna live here
after we get married.

672
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,224
Moving into my place.

673
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:07,261
Three cups of ice cold water.

674
00:43:07,661 --> 00:43:10,140
Caroline. Mr. Hedges.

675
00:43:12,498 --> 00:43:15,536
So, Elliot, this is Benson's wedding booklet.

676
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:17,734
It is full of possibilities.

677
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:21,932
Like I always said, Mr. Sherman,
"variety is the spice of life. "

678
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:23,930
Ching ching.

679
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:27,168
I am so sorry, Mr. Sherman.

680
00:43:28,447 --> 00:43:29,886
- Oh, my.
- Wait.

681
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:33,004
The lacy pink women's panties.
I can explain that.

682
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:36,402
Well, they say Brooklyn, New York,
but I say Brooklyn, Wisconsin.

683
00:43:36,482 --> 00:43:38,840
It's out in the middle of nowhere here.

684
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,799
Elliot! Wake up!

685
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:43,677
Elliot, wake up. Your fiancee is outside
your apartment with some guy.

686
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:45,756
No! The wedding planner!

687
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:47,275
I completely forgot!

688
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:50,073
Okay, kisses. Goodbye. You hang up first.

689
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:54,750
No! Cecil.

690
00:43:56,189 --> 00:43:58,307
You have to hide that somewhere.

691
00:44:00,426 --> 00:44:01,425
Where?

692
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,783
I left the keys in the car.

693
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:04,943
- It should be right-
- Okay...

694
00:44:05,023 --> 00:44:07,101
you know what? Hold this for a second.
Hands free.

695
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:09,699
I know. Here. Under the pillow. Right here.

696
00:44:10,659 --> 00:44:11,658
Perfect.

697
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:16,055
Hello, Brooklyn.

698
00:44:18,174 --> 00:44:20,932
Could you go back to my bedroom
and get me a suit and a tie?

699
00:44:21,012 --> 00:44:22,851
I got to go to the bathroom.

700
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:27,487
- I swear...
- Here she comes.

701
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:30,406
I would lose my head
if it weren't screwed on.

702
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:34,403
Okay. Three story walkup. I know.

703
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:36,362
I don't know why anyone lives
without a doorman.

704
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:37,481
Feel the burn.

705
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:55,868
- Here!
- Thank you.

706
00:44:55,948 --> 00:44:57,987
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

707
00:44:58,147 --> 00:44:59,146
Elliot?

708
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:00,985
You have to hide.
She can't know you're here.

709
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,064
- Where?
- Here!

710
00:45:02,144 --> 00:45:04,543
- No! Where should I hide?
- Under the bed!

711
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,701
Did you hear that?

712
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:13,936
- Elliot?
- Just a sec, hon.

713
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:22,251
Honey, are you in the bathroom?

714
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,129
- Oh, my.
- What?

715
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:28,926
My God!

716
00:45:30,245 --> 00:45:32,923
Elliot, did you fill out your questionnaire?

717
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:35,442
My questionnaire?

718
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:39,279
Benson's wedding questionnaire.
I put it in your briefcase yesterday.

719
00:45:43,237 --> 00:45:46,514
That questionnaire. Yes. Of course.

720
00:45:46,634 --> 00:45:49,672
- Where is the questionnaire?
- It's in my briefcase.

721
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:51,671
I filled it out after work...

722
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:54,149
and I put it in my briefcase.

723
00:45:55,668 --> 00:45:58,786
See, look here's my questionnaire, honey,
all filled out.

724
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,745
Okay, then.

725
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:02,863
Now, let's start with the color scheme.

726
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:05,821
The color scheme is the
foundation of the entire wedding.

727
00:46:05,901 --> 00:46:08,779
You go first, Elliot. I wanna see
if we put down the same thing for this.

728
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:10,858
I put down...

729
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:14,775
- yellow and black.
- Like a bumblebee?

730
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,653
Oh! Buzz buzz.

731
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,572
Or not.

732
00:46:19,972 --> 00:46:23,370
Those were just options. I was really
curious to know what you put down.

733
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:26,447
Well, my colors were Tuscan white bean
and steamed asparagus.

734
00:46:26,527 --> 00:46:29,805
But, really, Elliot, I'm shocked.

735
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:31,684
- Yellow and black?
- Okay.

736
00:46:31,764 --> 00:46:35,521
You know what? Let's talk about what kind
of music you want at the reception.

737
00:46:36,281 --> 00:46:37,320
Okay, music.

738
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,198
Yes, that's Elliot's forte.
So I defer 100 percent to him on this.

739
00:46:41,637 --> 00:46:44,116
- Funk.
- Are you insane, Elliot?

740
00:46:44,156 --> 00:46:48,593
Or jazz. Or swing. Or rock. Or, I don't know.

741
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:52,630
It was a toss up for me between
jazz and rock and swing and funk.

742
00:46:53,189 --> 00:46:55,588
You know what?
Let's forget about the music.

743
00:46:55,668 --> 00:46:58,026
Who's hungry? I'm hungry.
Let's talk about food?

744
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,945
- That's a great idea.
- Fine.

745
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,744
Food.

746
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:03,503
Okay.

747
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:07,260
Well, Elliot, I know we put down
the same thing for this one.

748
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,259
So, here we go.

749
00:47:09,938 --> 00:47:10,938
One...

750
00:47:12,017 --> 00:47:13,736
two, shout it out...

751
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:15,055
three!

752
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,894
- Baja cuisine!
- French food.

753
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:20,731
- What did you say?
- French food is a great idea, Caroline.

754
00:47:20,811 --> 00:47:24,129
- Did you say Baja cuisine?
- Is that what I said?

755
00:47:24,169 --> 00:47:26,687
- What, may I ask, is Baja cuisine?
- Don't answer that.

756
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:29,365
- It's beer-battered fish.
- Beer-battered fish.

757
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,363
- I hate you!
- Okay.

758
00:47:32,443 --> 00:47:34,841
Let's do this later, outside of Brooklyn.

759
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:39,318
No, wait. Mr. Hedges. Mr. Hedges, please.

760
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:41,037
Baja cuisine?

761
00:47:42,316 --> 00:47:46,154
- At my wedding?
- Benson Hedges, don't leave me with her.

762
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:50,431
I'm not a marriage counselor, Mr. Sherman.

763
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:53,909
I am a marriage maker. Good day to you.

764
00:48:03,902 --> 00:48:07,380
The questionnaire was blank, Elliot!
It was blank!

765
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,738
I can explain that.

766
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:13,415
- How could you do this to me?
- Wait!

767
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:16,413
Sugar? Sweetie, are you there?

768
00:48:16,573 --> 00:48:18,732
Okay, now I have no idea where I am.

769
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:20,850
Okay, taxi!

770
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,209
Darling.

771
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:26,287
Caroline, not in the bedroom!
Not in the bedroom!

772
00:48:28,685 --> 00:48:30,964
- Oh, God!
- Oh, God is right, Elliot!

773
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:34,761
You just completely lied to me! I mean...

774
00:48:35,161 --> 00:48:38,798
- I can explain that!
- You can't explain this, Elliot!

775
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:40,717
You knew how important
that questionnaire was...

776
00:48:40,757 --> 00:48:43,835
and you clearly
didn't even bother to look at it!

777
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,593
Suck it in! Up!

778
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:49,032
Suck it up?

779
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:53,189
Like this is somehow my fault?
Like I'm being unreasonable here?

780
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:56,586
Ouch!

781
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,185
I hope this hurts, Elliot!

782
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:02,423
Because you have no idea
how badly this is hurting me!

783
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:07,179
I mean, we are getting married
and you don't even seem...

784
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:10,097
to care about the wedding anymore!

785
00:49:13,135 --> 00:49:14,534
Elliot...

786
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,531
Enough!

787
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,489
Elliot...

788
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:25,367
ever since we drove
to my parents' house for dinner...

789
00:49:25,447 --> 00:49:28,165
you have been acting like a maniac!

790
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:31,843
You're possessive. You're paranoid.
You're forgetful.

791
00:49:32,322 --> 00:49:34,081
What happened to you?

792
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:39,198
Elliot, I am seeing a side of you
that I really don't like.

793
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:42,596
Don't bother walking me out!

794
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:48,951
What did you say?

795
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:56,106
- You're not even gonna fight for me?
- Wait, Caroline!

796
00:49:56,706 --> 00:49:59,064
Caroline, wait.

797
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:02,982
Caroline, please don't go!

798
00:50:03,062 --> 00:50:04,061
Elliot...

799
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,178
- I am calling off the wedding.
- You're what?

800
00:50:08,818 --> 00:50:12,335
I hate saying this but I don't think
we're meant to be together.

801
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:15,893
It's over.

802
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:52,828
Elliot...

803
00:50:54,227 --> 00:50:56,906
- I'm so sorry that this is happening.
- Cecil...

804
00:50:57,665 --> 00:51:00,223
I think I just need to be alone right now.

805
00:51:00,743 --> 00:51:03,821
Okay. I understand.

806
00:51:09,577 --> 00:51:10,936
I'm so sorry.

807
00:51:23,368 --> 00:51:27,525
Darling, please call me
as soon as you get this.

808
00:51:32,162 --> 00:51:34,200
My God! Elliot!

809
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,278
I came as soon as I heard.

810
00:51:40,436 --> 00:51:42,515
And I brought along some cookies.

811
00:51:46,032 --> 00:51:48,551
What happened? Just tell me everything.

812
00:51:48,631 --> 00:51:51,429
She called off the wedding.
That's what happened.

813
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,947
- Who's that girl?
- That's Stella's friend, Nadine.

814
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:56,625
- Does she have a boyfriend?
- I don't think so.

815
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:03,860
Listen, Elliot, when's the next time you
and Caroline are supposed to get together?

816
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,258
Tonight. My parents are having dinner
for the two families.

817
00:52:07,898 --> 00:52:09,257
Well, there you go!

818
00:52:09,297 --> 00:52:11,735
That's, like, 10 hours from now.
That gives her time...

819
00:52:11,815 --> 00:52:15,732
to get a little space, a little perspective,
a little dose of reality.

820
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:19,330
I don't think she's even gonna be there, Ed.
I mean, she said it was over.

821
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,649
She'll be there. Quote me on that.

822
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:27,604
Elliot, dear, Caroline was a nice girl.

823
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:31,202
And we would've loved
for it to work out, but...

824
00:52:32,761 --> 00:52:36,518
Come to think of it,
we've liked all your girlfriends.

825
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:40,596
But you know what they say?

826
00:52:41,555 --> 00:52:43,794
No, Mom, tell me, what do they say?

827
00:52:44,273 --> 00:52:45,433
Oh, well...

828
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:47,591
there's other fish in the sea.

829
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:49,550
That's right, kiddo.

830
00:52:50,949 --> 00:52:54,386
I heard that
Jim and Nancy Wasserman's girl, Tina...

831
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:57,185
is on the slab again.

832
00:52:58,344 --> 00:53:00,263
She's a fresh catch!

833
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,738
So, Elliot...

834
00:53:07,897 --> 00:53:12,254
- we're really sorry about what happened.
- Yeah, sorry.

835
00:53:13,614 --> 00:53:16,172
Sorry for what? I screwed up.

836
00:53:16,332 --> 00:53:18,410
I got what I deserved.

837
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:22,528
We just thought you were our savior,
you know.

838
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,323
- But, life goes on?
- It does.

839
00:53:29,923 --> 00:53:34,480
Sometimes I think if I'd never met Cecil Mills
none of this ever would have happened.

840
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:37,677
- That's a big if.
- I don't know about that.

841
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:41,155
Excuse me, did you say Cecil Mills?

842
00:53:42,154 --> 00:53:43,673
That's my girlfriend.

843
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:45,832
- Really?
- Yeah.

844
00:53:46,391 --> 00:53:49,589
- Who are you?
- I'm Elliot Sherman.

845
00:53:50,549 --> 00:53:52,507
Nothing happened. I swear.

846
00:53:56,105 --> 00:53:58,104
Wait a minute! You're the Baxter!

847
00:53:58,184 --> 00:54:01,821
Cecil told me all about you.
It's nice to meet you!

848
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,178
- She did?
- Yeah. Cec and I share everything.

849
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:07,457
We have no secrets.

850
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:10,535
Thank you so much for letting her
crash at your place the other night.

851
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:12,454
We had a bit of a lovers' spat.

852
00:54:12,534 --> 00:54:15,532
- You know how that is, right?
- Right.

853
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,929
So what are you doing here?

854
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:22,207
Well, you know me...

855
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:26,604
guvnor, come on in for a bit
of the old lagers and...

856
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:28,603
I'm just meeting
a friend of mine from college.

857
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:30,522
- What about you?
- Dan.

858
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:33,360
Tallyho. There she is.

859
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,319
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's so weird.

860
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:37,277
I was just talking about you.

861
00:54:38,077 --> 00:54:40,235
- How long has it been since I've seen you?
- Ages!

862
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:41,634
Yeah. At least.

863
00:54:41,714 --> 00:54:43,913
- Hey.
- Hey, sweets!

864
00:54:44,992 --> 00:54:48,310
- I'm official valet.
- Bradley, this is Dan.

865
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,708
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you, too.

866
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:53,267
- College.
- Yeah.

867
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:57,224
Elliot?

868
00:54:59,183 --> 00:55:02,300
Get out of Dodge, Eeyore!
What are you doing here? I know this guy.

869
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,819
I'm just meeting up with some friends.

870
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:09,376
- Elliot is friends with my little lady.
- No way. Where's Caroline?

871
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:10,615
She-

872
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:13,853
Why don't we grab some real estate?
Maybe pull up a table?

873
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:17,051
- No, we couldn't possibly-
- Yeah! Definitely!

874
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:18,929
Yes, it's on.

875
00:55:20,128 --> 00:55:21,847
Pull up some real estate.

876
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:38,676
"Very clever, Mr. Bond. "

877
00:55:44,232 --> 00:55:45,391
James Bond.

878
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:47,390
Okay, I got one.

879
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:55,225
I'm an electric man and-

880
00:55:56,624 --> 00:55:58,143
I've got to know this.

881
00:55:58,223 --> 00:56:00,541
All you people are working overtime

882
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,099
Wait till they get a load of me.

883
00:56:08,776 --> 00:56:09,935
But...

884
00:56:10,175 --> 00:56:13,133
- But...
- Don't brag yet.

885
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,128
The policy is not like that in China.

886
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,963
- I think it's against the rules.
- I don't think so.

887
00:56:29,642 --> 00:56:32,480
I want to make a toast to my friend.

888
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,878
To Elliot and the bride-to-be.

889
00:56:35,997 --> 00:56:37,916
No. She left him.

890
00:56:39,795 --> 00:56:42,273
Just this morning. Walked out the door.

891
00:56:43,352 --> 00:56:45,111
Is that true, Elliot?

892
00:56:50,388 --> 00:56:51,707
Jesus.

893
00:56:53,186 --> 00:56:55,025
Man, I'm sorry about...

894
00:56:56,264 --> 00:56:58,382
- That's awful.
- Can you not be so...

895
00:57:03,139 --> 00:57:04,538
Hang in here, bro.

896
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:12,133
"Sweet dove, sweet dove
Never to return again"

897
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:18,889
Keats.

898
00:57:20,128 --> 00:57:21,127
That is...

899
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:25,164
so beautiful, Bradley, the way you said that.

900
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:29,162
I need to get out of here.
I need some fresh air. I'm sorry.

901
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:32,679
Elliot, don't.

902
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:39,874
- It's your go.
- Yeah.

903
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:43,872
"I get no respect at all. "

904
00:57:53,505 --> 00:57:55,664
What's the point, anyway?

905
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:01,020
I hate my life.

906
00:58:07,376 --> 00:58:09,494
I just want to die.

907
00:58:14,731 --> 00:58:16,490
Goodbye, cruel world.

908
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:19,208
Elliot! Elliot, wait!

909
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:20,767
Elliot!

910
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:23,325
Man!

911
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:28,961
Oh, boy.

912
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:31,879
- What are you doing here, Louis?
- I was looking for you.

913
00:58:31,959 --> 00:58:33,678
Caroline sent me. She's worried.

914
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,597
- Caroline worried?
- Yeah.

915
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:38,915
She's staying with us tonight.
She didn't want to be alone.

916
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,228
You know, you really
scared the crap out of me, man.

917
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:52,266
So, what'd you do? You get the...
You went for the 40?

918
00:58:53,985 --> 00:58:57,622
Yeah, don't get me started
on my college days.

919
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:01,420
Put away one of these myself.

920
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:03,218
Man.

921
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:06,616
Elliot, I know what you're going through.
I really do.

922
00:59:06,896 --> 00:59:07,855
I really do.

923
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:10,374
Being married to a Swann girl
is no easy task.

924
00:59:10,453 --> 00:59:12,572
I'm the one who knows.
I'm the only other one who knows...

925
00:59:12,652 --> 00:59:15,530
'cause I'm married
to the only other Swann girl, Kate.

926
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:16,609
I mean...

927
00:59:16,729 --> 00:59:18,008
let me tell you...

928
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:21,206
I remember what it was like when Kate
and I were first getting married.

929
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:24,564
We drove up to this dog breeder
and I don't even like dogs.

930
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:26,603
And I went anyway. And what happens?

931
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:30,440
Of course, the dog bites me,
in the leg and the face.

932
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,477
It's like, God damn it, girl.
What are you trying to do to me?

933
00:59:34,957 --> 00:59:38,674
I mean, look, Kate and I,
we've been through our ups and downs.

934
00:59:38,754 --> 00:59:40,553
I'm not talking about our trip
to Cedar Point...

935
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:43,431
when we went on the roller coaster.
But I'm kidding about that.

936
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:46,789
It's like, Johnny Carson, you know?

937
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:50,027
But one time we go to this banana factory.

938
00:59:50,267 --> 00:59:51,746
And I'm, like, sure, I'll go with her.

939
00:59:51,826 --> 00:59:54,304
And then we get there
and, of course, no, no bananas.

940
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:56,662
- Bananas aren't even manufactured-
- Louis!

941
00:59:56,982 --> 00:59:59,101
What are you talking about?

942
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:02,139
She left me, okay! It's over!

943
01:00:03,538 --> 01:00:04,777
I blew it!

944
01:00:06,256 --> 01:00:07,655
Maybe not.

945
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:11,812
She's willing to consider
a reconciliation, Elliot.

946
01:00:11,892 --> 01:00:14,450
- She is?
- But you can't screw it up.

947
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,848
You've got to take her out to a nice dinner.
Sweep her off her feet.

948
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:20,047
Go to the park. Swimming maybe.

949
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:23,245
Scrabble. Horseback riding.

950
01:00:23,324 --> 01:00:26,242
Or skinny-dipping. A rondelet.

951
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,641
You could take her
to a rondelet or an opera.

952
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:30,919
Whatever she likes, you got to do it.

953
01:00:30,999 --> 01:00:33,997
You can do it, Elliot. You can do this.

954
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:37,195
- Okay?
- Okay.

955
01:00:37,995 --> 01:00:38,954
Okay.

956
01:00:39,793 --> 01:00:41,312
I have faith in you, man.

957
01:00:41,392 --> 01:00:43,791
You're my brother,
my brother-in-law, to-be...

958
01:00:43,871 --> 01:00:46,589
in a few weeks. Or whenever it is.

959
01:00:49,547 --> 01:00:51,226
You're gonna be fine.

960
01:00:53,624 --> 01:00:56,062
- Hell of a view, huh?
- Yeah.

961
01:01:04,257 --> 01:01:06,096
So that's exactly what I did.

962
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:09,294
I went to Caroline's apartment
to sweep her off her feet.

963
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,169
Elliot.

964
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:21,046
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you, too, Caroline.

965
01:01:21,925 --> 01:01:25,762
- These are for you.
- Flowers. Elliot, how sweet.

966
01:01:26,002 --> 01:01:29,040
- And these.
- And candies.

967
01:01:30,959 --> 01:01:32,158
Come in.

968
01:01:38,754 --> 01:01:41,712
Elliot, there's something really
important I need to discuss with you.

969
01:01:41,752 --> 01:01:44,110
Caroline, I want to apologize
for what happened yesterday.

970
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:46,229
- I was totally-
- Bradley's here.

971
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:47,468
What?

972
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:51,225
Hey, buddy.

973
01:01:51,745 --> 01:01:52,904
What's he doing here?

974
01:01:52,984 --> 01:01:55,303
I know this isn't what we had planned,
and I'm really sorry.

975
01:01:55,383 --> 01:01:57,701
- But he just broke up with his girlfriend.
- Sonya?

976
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:59,340
He seemed so stranded.

977
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,498
I invited him out to dinner.
I didn't know what else to do.

978
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:06,215
- Bradley, you broke up with your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

979
01:02:07,055 --> 01:02:09,413
Just wasn't our destiny to be together.

980
01:02:10,492 --> 01:02:12,451
- But she seemed so nice.
- Yeah.

981
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:18,087
Look, Elliot, I know this isn't the
best time for me to be here right now.

982
01:02:18,127 --> 01:02:20,086
But I didn't want to be alone.

983
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,324
What do you say, Ell? Can he tag along?

984
01:02:25,123 --> 01:02:26,881
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

985
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,238
Glad that's settled.
I'll just put these in some water.

986
01:02:31,878 --> 01:02:34,956
These flowers are bulky, Elliot.

987
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:38,194
They're quite muscular, really.

988
01:02:38,234 --> 01:02:40,072
Did you buy them at the gym?

989
01:02:42,031 --> 01:02:44,230
No. I got them at-

990
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,028
I must be allergic.

991
01:02:46,468 --> 01:02:49,226
You know what?
I'm just gonna take them to work with me.

992
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,465
They'd be perfect for this
dank little storage room...

993
01:02:51,505 --> 01:02:55,582
we have in the basement where we keep
the paper clips and the toaster oven.

994
01:02:56,342 --> 01:02:58,540
What's that flower there? Is it new?

995
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,299
Bradley gave it to me.

996
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:03,537
- He... You did?
- Yeah, it's a bluebonnet.

997
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:08,653
I found it fighting its way
through a little slab of city sidewalk.

998
01:03:10,812 --> 01:03:12,730
It goes with Caroline's eyes.

999
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:16,808
- Very thoughtful of you, Bradley.
- Yeah.

1000
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,806
And these candies we can just take with us.

1001
01:03:18,886 --> 01:03:21,405
I'll give them to a homeless man
since I'm not eating chocolate.

1002
01:03:21,445 --> 01:03:23,084
Since when do you
not eat chocolate, Caroline?

1003
01:03:23,163 --> 01:03:25,802
- I'm watching my weight.
- I'm watching it, too.

1004
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:27,600
You!

1005
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,195
Well, I made us a reservation
for two at Chez Pierre.

1006
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:38,873
I should probably call ahead and see
about them adding another person.

1007
01:03:38,953 --> 01:03:40,672
If you two will excuse me.

1008
01:03:46,788 --> 01:03:50,225
Chez Pierre is a little outdated.

1009
01:03:50,425 --> 01:03:53,223
Elliot. He's not up on the trends.

1010
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:58,780
- You feeling better?
- Yeah, better now.

1011
01:04:03,616 --> 01:04:06,534
So I spoke to the maitre d'
over at Chez Pierre...

1012
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:09,652
and he informed me, unfortunately,
they could not find any extra chairs.

1013
01:04:09,732 --> 01:04:12,210
They looked everywhere. Bradley, I'm sorry.

1014
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:18,246
Elliot, I hope you don't think we're
going to allow Bradley to dine alone?

1015
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:19,805
What do you want me to do, Caroline?

1016
01:04:19,885 --> 01:04:21,844
They looked everywhere
and couldn't find any extra-

1017
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:25,002
Hey, I have an idea. I know a place nearby.

1018
01:04:25,082 --> 01:04:28,839
It's a great little burger joint.
Totally off the map, never crowded.

1019
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:30,838
And it's a real gem if you ask me.

1020
01:04:30,918 --> 01:04:32,757
- That sounds perfect.
- Great.

1021
01:04:34,196 --> 01:04:37,234
If that's okay with Elliot? What say you, Ell?

1022
01:04:37,314 --> 01:04:38,473
What say I?

1023
01:04:39,072 --> 01:04:42,270
If it's the same little burger joint
off the map that I'm thinking of...

1024
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:44,829
that's quite a gem,
then I feel like it's a very good choice.

1025
01:04:44,908 --> 01:04:46,787
- Great!
- All right!

1026
01:04:46,867 --> 01:04:48,306
I'll lead the way.

1027
01:04:51,824 --> 01:04:53,902
I'll get the door for you, honey.

1028
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:58,299
Thanks, Bradley. Grab my jacket.

1029
01:05:05,095 --> 01:05:07,613
- There she is.
- Bradley.

1030
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:10,851
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah.

1031
01:05:10,931 --> 01:05:13,010
Delores, Caroline. Caroline, Delores.

1032
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:15,208
- Hi.
- Hello. Pleased to meet you.

1033
01:05:15,488 --> 01:05:18,126
- Hi, Delores.
- What are you doing here?

1034
01:05:20,005 --> 01:05:21,004
Wow.

1035
01:05:25,002 --> 01:05:27,680
This place is perfect, Bradley.

1036
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,118
Magical, cheap.

1037
01:05:32,197 --> 01:05:34,555
Elliot, I can't believe
you never told me about this place.

1038
01:05:34,635 --> 01:05:36,953
I'm sorry, hon. I eat here all the time.

1039
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,752
I just didn't think you'd like it.

1040
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,670
- Know what you'd like to order?
- Yeah, I'm gonna have-

1041
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,228
Actually, Delores,
I'd like to take a look at the menu first.

1042
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:49,785
If you'll recall from the other times
you've eaten here...

1043
01:05:49,865 --> 01:05:51,384
we've got no menu.

1044
01:05:51,744 --> 01:05:54,981
You've got a choice of hamburger,
cheeseburger, fries or coleslaw...

1045
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:57,580
or all four if you're really hungry.

1046
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:02,536
Okay, good. I'll just take a second
to think it over. Why don't you guys order?

1047
01:06:02,616 --> 01:06:04,815
Cheeseburger, Delores. Extra, extra rare.

1048
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:06,614
That a boy, Bradley.

1049
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:09,092
Oh, what the hell, I'll have the same.

1050
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:13,089
And bring some office supplies,
because I might as well just tape it on.

1051
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:16,087
Wait, Caroline,
I thought you were watching your weight.

1052
01:06:16,167 --> 01:06:18,725
Honey, don't be such a stickler for details.

1053
01:06:19,045 --> 01:06:23,282
So that's two cheeseburgers extra rare.
Do we have enough for a quorum?

1054
01:06:23,362 --> 01:06:26,400
No, actually, Delores,
I'm gonna have just the hamburger.

1055
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,718
No cheese because I'm lactose intolerant.

1056
01:06:29,798 --> 01:06:32,076
And I'll get it cooked well done.

1057
01:06:32,276 --> 01:06:34,875
- Crispy, in fact.
- Okay.

1058
01:06:34,954 --> 01:06:37,673
And can I get you all something to drink?

1059
01:06:37,872 --> 01:06:41,710
- Yes, I'm gonna have-
- I'll order the drinks.

1060
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,788
- If that's okay with you, Brad?
- Sure.

1061
01:06:46,387 --> 01:06:50,864
Delores, we will have a bottle
of your very finest red wine.

1062
01:06:51,024 --> 01:06:55,501
An Acorn Creek pinot noir 2002
would be preferable.

1063
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:59,578
Caroline, when she brings the wine,
notice the beefy, meat...

1064
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:03,615
complexion and the fruit.

1065
01:07:03,855 --> 01:07:05,654
So, anyway, we'll have that.

1066
01:07:05,894 --> 01:07:07,732
Or if you don't mind, sir...

1067
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:11,650
perhaps you'll settle for our list of beers...

1068
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:15,687
as we are an ale house and it's all we've got.

1069
01:07:20,764 --> 01:07:23,682
Yes. That sounds good.

1070
01:07:24,361 --> 01:07:27,799
Bradley, perhaps you'd like to choose
one of the beers as I'm not...

1071
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:30,677
as particularly well-educated
in that type of...

1072
01:07:33,435 --> 01:07:37,592
While you're deciding on what to drink,
I'll just go put in your food order.

1073
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,828
You guys, I'm gonna go use the men's room.

1074
01:07:50,903 --> 01:07:54,661
Maybe he confused this place
with someplace else.

1075
01:08:34,634 --> 01:08:37,152
Hi, it's Cecil Mills. Leave a message. Bye.

1076
01:08:37,352 --> 01:08:41,150
Hi, Cecil, it's me, Elliot Sherman.

1077
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:46,386
Probably wondering why I'm calling you.

1078
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:49,584
Well, I'm just calling to say hi.

1079
01:08:50,503 --> 01:08:52,582
Just wanted to check in.

1080
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,579
I'm calling you right now from a restaurant.

1081
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:00,537
I was supposed
to be out on a big romantic date.

1082
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:05,213
My fiancee, Caroline,
she decided to bring Bradley with us.

1083
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:09,930
As you can imagine,
I'm not very happy about that.

1084
01:09:11,769 --> 01:09:15,247
I think it's fair to say
my marriage is officially off.

1085
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:19,404
Why am I telling you this?

1086
01:09:20,883 --> 01:09:25,040
You're probably out with Dan.
Anyway, Dan's a great guy.

1087
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:31,676
Yeah, so just calling to say hello.

1088
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:33,874
See how you were doing.

1089
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,512
Maybe I'll talk to you later.

1090
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,590
Okay, bye.

1091
01:10:02,975 --> 01:10:05,453
- Cecil?
- Elliot.

1092
01:10:06,612 --> 01:10:08,051
What are you doing here?

1093
01:10:08,131 --> 01:10:10,649
Betty caught the flu
and I'm your temp again.

1094
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:15,366
It's funny how things
come full circle, isn't it?

1095
01:10:15,846 --> 01:10:17,405
I got your message.

1096
01:10:17,565 --> 01:10:20,243
I'm so sorry, Elliot. It just sounded awful.

1097
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:24,800
So, I thought that maybe later
after work you and I could go to a bar...

1098
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,718
and make toasts
to how misery loves company.

1099
01:10:30,516 --> 01:10:31,755
It got better.

1100
01:10:33,114 --> 01:10:34,993
- It did?
- Yeah.

1101
01:10:35,952 --> 01:10:37,032
My night...

1102
01:10:37,871 --> 01:10:39,110
it got better.

1103
01:10:41,269 --> 01:10:44,067
What a lovely dinner.
Don't you think so, Elliot?

1104
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,863
- What should we do next?
- Let's go dancing.

1105
01:10:49,943 --> 01:10:52,061
There's a great little dance club
right around the corner.

1106
01:10:52,141 --> 01:10:54,900
- Yes! Elly, can we please?
- No!

1107
01:10:55,779 --> 01:10:57,698
Caroline, you and I really have to talk.

1108
01:10:57,778 --> 01:10:59,696
Elliot, you know how badly
I wanna go dancing.

1109
01:10:59,776 --> 01:11:02,255
- You are such a killjoy!
- That's not true!

1110
01:11:02,335 --> 01:11:04,173
Every party needs a pooper.

1111
01:11:04,253 --> 01:11:08,211
I may regret saying this, Elliot,
but you are so unromantic!

1112
01:11:08,291 --> 01:11:11,169
- What?
- I said you're unromantic, Elliot!

1113
01:11:11,488 --> 01:11:12,967
I'm unromantic?

1114
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,166
I'm unromantic?

1115
01:11:16,165 --> 01:11:18,963
That is just a very tough pill
for me to swallow right now...

1116
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:23,440
because I have been trying my absolute
hardest all night long to be romantic!

1117
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:27,478
But nothing, and I mean nothing,
is good enough for you, Caroline!

1118
01:11:27,558 --> 01:11:29,436
I bought you flowers, they were too bulky!

1119
01:11:29,516 --> 01:11:32,914
I got us a reservation at the best restaurant
in town, but it was too fancy!

1120
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:35,272
I foolishly ordered wine
with the cheeseburgers...

1121
01:11:35,352 --> 01:11:38,630
and now I'm the bad guy
because I don't want to go dancing!

1122
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:42,348
- Elliot, I'm sorry.
- No! No, I'm sorry, Caroline!

1123
01:11:42,907 --> 01:11:46,305
I'm sorry that I'm too unromantic!
And I'm sorry that I always play it safe!

1124
01:11:46,345 --> 01:11:49,743
But the fact of the matter is I'm not Bradley!
I'm Elliot!

1125
01:11:49,823 --> 01:11:52,661
I'm Elliot Sherman and I'm proud of it!

1126
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,859
And the fact of the matter is
I'm trying very hard to change...

1127
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:57,697
but, Caroline, I'm not perfect!

1128
01:11:57,777 --> 01:12:00,256
I'm not perfect
and I don't expect you to be, either!

1129
01:12:00,336 --> 01:12:03,693
So all I ask is that you just give me a break!

1130
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:06,851
Just give me a break.

1131
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:16,245
Now...

1132
01:12:16,924 --> 01:12:18,843
if you'll both excuse me...

1133
01:12:18,923 --> 01:12:22,681
I've changed my mind and I've decided
I would now like to go dancing.

1134
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,199
- Ell!
- Elliot.

1135
01:12:30,155 --> 01:12:33,393
- You're dancing, Elliot!
- Yeah!

1136
01:12:33,473 --> 01:12:37,590
- The bar mitzvah shuffle! Not bad, huh?
- Not bad at all.

1137
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:39,709
Caroline, look at me!

1138
01:12:44,306 --> 01:12:47,464
- Bradley was a breakdancer.
- Cool!

1139
01:12:48,423 --> 01:12:52,540
I used to have my own crew,
Sergeant Poppers and The Bionic Breakers!

1140
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,659
Careful, man.

1141
01:12:55,219 --> 01:12:57,057
Elliot, we should have a battle, man.

1142
01:12:57,137 --> 01:13:00,095
- That'd be so fun! Let's do it!
- No, that's okay.

1143
01:13:00,135 --> 01:13:02,214
Come on, Elliot!

1144
01:13:02,374 --> 01:13:04,173
- I'll start it off!
- All right!

1145
01:13:04,253 --> 01:13:06,291
Oh, yeah.

1146
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:12,247
- You go.
- It's your turn. Go.

1147
01:13:13,007 --> 01:13:13,966
Okay.

1148
01:13:16,724 --> 01:13:17,723
Elliot!

1149
01:13:20,642 --> 01:13:24,039
- You have so many great moves!
- Yeah, I do!

1150
01:13:25,878 --> 01:13:29,516
That was fun. I'm gonna go get
another drink. You guys want something?

1151
01:13:29,596 --> 01:13:30,875
- No, I'm good.
- All right.

1152
01:13:30,915 --> 01:13:34,152
What are you talking about, man?
The battle's not over!

1153
01:13:34,232 --> 01:13:38,110
Come on, I'm gonna do a windmill.
Difficulty level 6.0.

1154
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:40,548
Clear out, everybody. Clear out.

1155
01:13:40,748 --> 01:13:42,827
Ready? Here goes.

1156
01:13:45,225 --> 01:13:47,024
That's great!

1157
01:13:53,619 --> 01:13:56,298
Elliot!

1158
01:13:56,417 --> 01:14:01,254
- My gosh! Are you all right?
- What happened?

1159
01:14:02,174 --> 01:14:04,652
My God, Elliot, that was so stupid of me.

1160
01:14:06,771 --> 01:14:09,689
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

1161
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:11,727
I was just trying to have fun.

1162
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:14,126
Bradley, let's just talk tomorrow
or something...

1163
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:15,924
so I can get Elliot cleaned up here. Okay?

1164
01:14:16,004 --> 01:14:17,084
Yeah.

1165
01:14:18,563 --> 01:14:22,360
Except the thing is,
I didn't mention this before but...

1166
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:24,958
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

1167
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:26,837
- What?
- Yeah.

1168
01:14:26,917 --> 01:14:31,754
The team I'm working with found this
massive geode in this cave in Malta.

1169
01:14:32,353 --> 01:14:34,152
I kind of need to be there.

1170
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:37,670
Oh, that's too bad.

1171
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:43,066
Yeah, it's kind of bad timing, I know, but
Mother Nature makes up her own schedule.

1172
01:14:44,065 --> 01:14:47,823
Besides, there's nothing really
keeping me here anymore, right?

1173
01:14:50,341 --> 01:14:51,420
Right.

1174
01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:56,337
Anyway, it's probably gonna be
my last cave.

1175
01:14:56,897 --> 01:14:59,935
I mean, I wanna try something else,
try something new. I don't know what.

1176
01:15:00,015 --> 01:15:02,773
It may be medicine, it may be soccer.
I don't know.

1177
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:05,331
I haven't even got my head around it yet.

1178
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:09,049
Well, it was good seeing you again.

1179
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:12,846
Yeah. Good seeing you, too.

1180
01:15:15,324 --> 01:15:16,564
Okay.

1181
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:19,681
Okay.

1182
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,679
Right.

1183
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,438
Right.

1184
01:15:27,276 --> 01:15:28,276
Bye.

1185
01:15:31,753 --> 01:15:32,713
Bye.

1186
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:38,948
- Take care, elbow macaroni.
- Bye, Bradley.

1187
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:54,058
I guess you really swept her
off her feet, huh? Congratulations, Elliot.

1188
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:58,695
- I guess you're not a Baxter after all.
- I guess not.

1189
01:16:00,334 --> 01:16:02,133
Well, that makes one of us.

1190
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:07,689
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

1191
01:16:09,168 --> 01:16:12,006
No? Okay, well...

1192
01:16:15,764 --> 01:16:17,203
I got to go.

1193
01:16:18,762 --> 01:16:22,040
- Where you gonna go?
- I think I'd like to find Dan.

1194
01:16:22,999 --> 01:16:23,958
Why?

1195
01:16:24,718 --> 01:16:29,435
Because Dan got a job in Cincinnati, Elliot.
And he's leaving on Saturday.

1196
01:16:30,554 --> 01:16:32,832
I guess that means that I won't be
able to make your wedding.

1197
01:16:32,912 --> 01:16:34,791
But that's okay, you're registered, right?

1198
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:37,949
I'll get you a something.
I'll get you a waffle maker.

1199
01:16:38,668 --> 01:16:43,625
He wanted me to go with him,
but I was holding out for some reason.

1200
01:16:45,943 --> 01:16:47,662
You don't want Dan.

1201
01:16:47,742 --> 01:16:50,420
Well, something is better
than nothing, Elliot.

1202
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:55,577
But what about singing, Cecil?
What about that?

1203
01:16:56,616 --> 01:16:58,815
They have singing in Cincinnati, too.

1204
01:16:59,734 --> 01:17:01,453
Good luck with everything.

1205
01:17:08,888 --> 01:17:11,166
Which brings us all the way back
to the beginning...

1206
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,844
or the ending,
depending on how you look at it.

1207
01:17:15,004 --> 01:17:19,281
But it's just like Cecil said:
"It's funny how things come full circle. "

1208
01:17:19,921 --> 01:17:23,758
- Here you are, buddy. You made it.
- Yeah.

1209
01:17:25,637 --> 01:17:26,716
Yeah.

1210
01:17:30,194 --> 01:17:32,712
- He looks so handsome.
- He does, doesn't he?

1211
01:17:33,991 --> 01:17:36,749
I mean, this is what I've always
wanted my whole entire life.

1212
01:17:36,829 --> 01:17:38,828
This is what I've always wanted.

1213
01:17:39,787 --> 01:17:42,066
Now I'm actually doing it.

1214
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,383
- It's great, buddy.
- So great.

1215
01:17:46,263 --> 01:17:47,262
Yeah.

1216
01:18:17,842 --> 01:18:19,600
Please be seated.

1217
01:18:22,838 --> 01:18:24,397
Good afternoon.

1218
01:18:24,797 --> 01:18:28,115
We are gathered here today
to join these two people...

1219
01:18:28,514 --> 01:18:30,473
in holy matrimony.

1220
01:18:30,913 --> 01:18:34,111
Elliot Sherman and Caroline Swann.

1221
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:39,427
If anyone whosoever should object
to these two people being married...

1222
01:18:39,747 --> 01:18:43,864
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1223
01:18:46,063 --> 01:18:48,381
- Caroline.
- Elliot?

1224
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,739
Caroline!

1225
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:53,418
Bradley!

1226
01:18:53,498 --> 01:18:55,456
I'm going to business school.

1227
01:18:56,336 --> 01:18:57,335
Bradley!

1228
01:18:58,374 --> 01:19:00,573
I got on a plane
and I flew all the way back to Malta.

1229
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,052
But then I realized something.

1230
01:19:02,132 --> 01:19:05,450
I realized that no matter
how exciting my life is...

1231
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:08,008
it's dull if you're not a part of it.

1232
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:11,645
And I realized that it was wrong
for me to ask you to be...

1233
01:19:12,045 --> 01:19:14,044
who I wanted you to be.

1234
01:19:14,603 --> 01:19:18,001
When all along I never wanted you to be...

1235
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:22,478
the person that I wanted you to be
but me to be with you.

1236
01:19:24,037 --> 01:19:25,036
Us.

1237
01:19:25,796 --> 01:19:26,755
Me.

1238
01:19:27,155 --> 01:19:28,354
Together.

1239
01:19:28,834 --> 01:19:31,472
Caroline, I'm asking you
for another chance...

1240
01:19:32,471 --> 01:19:34,430
to be the man that I never was before.

1241
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:39,427
One who can provide a safe
and secure environment...

1242
01:19:40,386 --> 01:19:42,105
where we can settle down.

1243
01:19:46,102 --> 01:19:47,581
What do say, Carrie?

1244
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,099
Oh, Bradley!

1245
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:08,287
Bradley and Caroline
lived happily ever after.

1246
01:20:09,247 --> 01:20:12,125
But like I said, this movie isn't about them.

1247
01:20:12,804 --> 01:20:13,884
It's about me.

1248
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:22,038
Cecil! Wait!

1249
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:24,996
Cecil!

1250
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:32,950
No.

1251
01:21:44,622 --> 01:21:45,982
You're late.

1252
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,818
- Cecil.
- Elliot.

1253
01:21:52,137 --> 01:21:53,536
What are you doing here?

1254
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:56,614
Remember when I said
that they had singing in Cincinnati?

1255
01:21:56,694 --> 01:21:57,974
I lied.

1256
01:22:00,772 --> 01:22:02,490
What's your excuse?

1257
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:06,248
Cecil, I realized that Caroline
and I aren't meant to be together.

1258
01:22:06,448 --> 01:22:09,846
And I realized that I don't want you
to move to Cincinnati.

1259
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:11,444
And I...

1260
01:22:11,524 --> 01:22:14,562
know that this might
sound a little bit crazy...

1261
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:19,439
but I think I fell in love with you
the minute I first saw you.

1262
01:22:26,554 --> 01:22:27,873
Cecil?

1263
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,552
Cecil Mills?

1264
01:22:29,792 --> 01:22:32,510
It's me Jack Mechanic!
Remember from semester at sea?

1265
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:37,187
- You!
- Take it easy!

1266
01:22:41,664 --> 01:22:43,183
Sorry about that. I just...

1267
01:22:51,418 --> 01:22:54,895
- By the way I got you something.
- Is that what I think it is?

1268
01:22:55,535 --> 01:22:58,453
- It's a gromwell.
- Thank you.

1269
01:22:59,412 --> 01:23:01,091
You're welcome.

1270
01:23:13,403 --> 01:23:15,521
So that's the end of my story.

1271
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:18,999
But for every guy out there
who's been splashed by a taxi...

1272
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:22,996
dumped by a girl or who's just
a little out of step with the world...

1273
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:24,156
Hi.

1274
01:23:24,235 --> 01:23:25,235
...there's hope.

1275
01:23:25,315 --> 01:23:27,154
This is a song that I wrote.

1276
01:26:41,823 --> 01:26:44,980
Imagine you're watching
one of those old romantic movies.

1277
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:47,938
That's Cecil, the leading lady.

1278
01:26:49,657 --> 01:26:52,016
That's Elliot, the leading man.

1279
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:53,974
Cecil!

1280
01:26:54,534 --> 01:26:58,411
And that's me, Dan, the Baxter.

1281
01:30:36,025 --> 01:30:37,424
No.

1282
01:30:37,704 --> 01:30:41,261
He wasn't a medicine man.
He was more like a shaman.

1283
01:30:42,461 --> 01:30:45,139
And he asked me back to his house
which was a very sort of...

1284
01:30:45,219 --> 01:30:46,778
a holy place in the earth.

1285
01:30:47,018 --> 01:30:50,815
We traveled many miles and when
we got back there and he gave me a...

1286
01:30:51,535 --> 01:30:53,613
It was like a paste that you eat.

1287
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:56,251
And you hallucinate all through the night...

1288
01:30:56,331 --> 01:30:59,809
and when you awake you're very sort of...

1289
01:31:01,288 --> 01:31:02,687
freed or cleansed.

1290
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,062
