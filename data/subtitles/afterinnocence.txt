3
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,417
I can't see.

4
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,422
I really can't see.

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,444
I still can't see anything.

6
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,446
I can't see.

7
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,448
You're noisy.

8
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,450
I have seen it.

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,452
What did you see?

10
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,445
I see 10 years or 8 years.

11
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,460
I bring my daughter with me.

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,464
She is clever and pretty.

13
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:07,467
I see some women drinking tea.

14
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,471
The sun is bright and warm.

15
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,473
Later.

16
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:17,466
My husband opens the door and comes in.

17
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,469
He is the kind of...

18
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,485
He...

19
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,476
He is the kind of...

20
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,485
What? Which kind?

21
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,492
He is the kind of...

22
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,510
Why are you talking
under the trees in PE class?

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,501
Get up and join the class.

24
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,557
Are you mad?
Why did you run so many rounds just now?

25
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,559
Don't you want to know who's my husband?

26
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,560
Who?

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,564
I walked around him just now.

28
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,566
Who?

29
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,559
The most handsome one.

30
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,580
That one. What?

31
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,573
My husband. He is in a colorful shirt.

32
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,583
Zhang Shihao, class 975.

33
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,678
- Blue Gate Crossing -

34
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,728
Let's have a bet.

35
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,743
What?

36
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,746
3 scores ball?

37
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,748
Then 5 scores ball.

38
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,739
You are so boring.

39
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,759
Hey.

40
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,752
How about we bet which one of us
walk the dog in the night?

41
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,767
Ok. How much?

42
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,769
100.

43
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:13,773
Cheapskate!

44
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,766
Are you an idiot?
Then you do it yourself.

45
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,784
I'll bet...
You pay the class fee for me.

46
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,787
OK. How much is it?

47
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,778
1200.

48
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,827
Hey. Let's see it.

49
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,818
Someone is walking his dog.

50
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,823
Let's see it.

51
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,851
I got it.

52
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,853
You played basketball again.

53
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,845
I play sometimes.

54
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,866
Hey. What are you doing?

55
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,883
I'm reading English.

56
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,886
So neat.

57
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,888
No.

58
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,879
No.

59
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,895
I'll be the happiest man in the world.

60
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,887
I am staying with my classmate.

61
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,890
I'll go now.

62
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,905
I'm wearing shoes.

63
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,896
Where are you?

64
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,903
I'm passing the traffic lights.

65
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,906
Be quick.

66
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:42,911
Please tell me where we'll go.

67
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:58,927
Bring back some milk for me!

68
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,945
Hey.
It's getting dark.

69
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,938
Hey. Hey. Hey.

70
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,943
Ahh.. at last!

71
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,959
It's so late. Where will we go?

72
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,960
Guess.

73
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,951
I guess.

74
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,966
Let's go watch Zhang Shihao, OK?

75
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,968
I will not.

76
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,970
Let's go... Please.

77
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,972
Let's go...

78
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,974
You beg first.

79
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,977
I beg you.

80
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,979
Are you really begging?

81
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:40,980
Go.

82
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,982
Go, Go, quick.

83
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,975
Let's go. Please go with me.

84
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,988
Zhang Shihao swims everynight.

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,002
He is in the swimming team.

86
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,006
I can't see anything.

87
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:11,010
You can listen.

88
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,013
You really love him?

89
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,004
Yes.

90
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:21,020
But I don't know whether he has a girlfriend.

91
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,011
Of course he has.

92
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:27,026
I don't know whether he loves me.

93
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,017
Of course not.

94
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,032
You ask for me.

95
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,033
No.

96
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,035
No.

97
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,036
No.

98
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:41,040
Please.

99
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,033
Zhang Shihao, do you have a girlfriend?

100
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:50,049
Zhang Shihao, my friend wants to meet you!

101
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,051
Do you have a girlfriend?

102
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:56,055
Zhang Shihao, do you hear me?

103
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:00,059
My friend wants to meet you!

104
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,052
Zhang Shihao, do you have a friend?

105
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,067
My friend wants to meet you!

106
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,058
Zhang Shihao!

107
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,072
Please don't shout!

108
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,074
If the guard comes and find us here.

109
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,065
I'lll be punished.

110
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,068
Hey!

111
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,110
Were you the one shouting?

112
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,113
My friend wants to meet you.

113
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,104
Who?

114
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:31,150
Who wants to meet me?

115
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,153
She will know what you think first.

116
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,154
Who is she?

117
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,156
She will know what's on your mind first.

118
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,158
Who is she?

119
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,160
What do you think?

120
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,153
I really want to know who she is.

121
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,168
Who is she?

122
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,159
Hey.

123
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,184
Yuezhen, Yuezhen

124
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,200
Yuezhen!

125
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,203
Yuezhen please come out.

126
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,195
Yuezhen come out.

127
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:34,202
Lin Yuezhen, Lin Yuezhen

128
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,217
There isn't a Lin Yuezhen, right?

129
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,210
You want to meet me?

130
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,226
Yuezhen, come out.

131
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,218
Yuezhen, come out.

132
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,223
Lin Yuezhen

133
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,237
There isn't a Lin Yuezhen, right?

134
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:02,230
You just want to meet me, right?

135
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,249
Hey!

136
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,251
Hey!

137
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:16,244
My name is Zhang Shihao. Scorpio.
Blood type is O. I'm in the swimming team
and the guitar club.

138
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,273
Be quick.

139
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,276
Ok.

140
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,280
Let me see it.

141
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,284
Ok.

142
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,344
Zhang Shihao's basketball.

143
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,335
I picked it up that day.

144
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,360
Zhang Shihao's shoes.

145
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,362
He's got big shoes.

146
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,353
Size 26.5.

147
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,377
You have his diary?

148
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,379
His writting is bad.

149
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:24,372
He deceived me to hand in homework
and I got it without difficulty.

150
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,390
What's this?

151
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,383
It's a love heart made by myself.

152
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,391
What's this?

153
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,422
His pens.

154
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,443
I've been loving him for a long time.

155
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:28,436
But I can only take his photo secretly.

156
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:33,441
Pick up his trash.

157
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,446
Am I very timid?

158
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,464
I'll go home.

159
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,455
No.

160
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,522
I'll be your friend..

161
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,513
~ Meng Kerou

162
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,534
What?

163
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,540
Hand it over.

164
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,543
No.

165
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,548
Please.

166
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,601
I won.

167
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,621
It's for you.

168
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:26,614
A present?

169
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,624
My name is Zhang Shihao. Scorpio.
Blood type is O. I am in the swimming team
and the guitar club!

170
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,652
Zhang Shihao, hello.

171
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,654
I'm your schoolmate.

172
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,647
I can't help watching you when in school.

173
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,653
I want to see you everyday in shcool.

174
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:11,670
I think you are a good boy.

175
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,663
I hesitated for a long time
and then wrote to you.

176
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,679
Report to the Head Office.

177
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,681
Report to the Head Office.

178
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,684
Zhang Shihao, 975 class.

179
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,677
Meng Kerou, 968 class.

180
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,683
Please go to the head office now.

181
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,741
I'll wait for your reply.

182
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,734
Be sure to reply.

183
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,751
Sorry.

184
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,754
It's not me. It's Ahmian.

185
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:39,747
I didn't write this letter.
It's Lin Yuezhen.

186
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,765
There isn't a Lin Yuezhen, right?

187
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:50,758
You just want to meet me.

188
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,778
My name is Zhang Shihao. Scorpio.
Blood type is O. I am in the swimming team
and the guitar club!

189
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,769
I'm pretty good.

190
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,810
Read this, follow me: housewife.

191
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:46,825
Good. Notice this plural form's change.

192
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,818
fe tuens to ves.. and knife turns to knives.

193
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,832
Why did you write a letter with my name?

194
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,825
Good, now read follow me: ambition.

195
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:01,840
Why did you write a letter with my name?

196
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,843
Often we remember the ending of a word.

197
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,845
"ion" is an ending of a noun.

198
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:10,849
Meng Kerou, what are you doing?

199
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,853
Why did you write a letter with my name?

200
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,846
Pick up the books. What's happening to you?

201
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,891
Meng Kerou, do you want to have dinner?

202
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,955
Meng Kerou, do you want to have dinner?

203
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,963
Meng Kerou

204
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,979
20 boiled dumplings, please.

205
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,981
Ok.

206
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,985
Our boiled dumplings are big.
I think 15 is enough for you.

207
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,987
Ok.

208
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,990
Any soup?

209
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,993
We have many kinds.

210
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,984
Spicy soup

211
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,998
I think greengrocery-tofu soup is ok.

212
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,000
Boys don't like greengrocery.

213
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,991
Ok.

214
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,005
Do you study in the affiliated school

215
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,006
Yes.

216
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,008
My daughter studies there too.
Her name is Meng Kerou.

217
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,010
Do you hear about her?

218
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,013
Yes. Her name is unique.
She is quite well-known in our school.

219
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,016
Her name is not good.
She is not mild-mannered a girl should be.

220
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,952
Did you gave her, her name?

221
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,022
No. Her father.

222
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,024
Quite good.

223
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,015
"Disgusting"

224
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,042
What about today's exam?

225
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,057
Which pages will the exam cover?

226
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:42,060
58-67.

227
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,053
58-67...

228
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,069
That's a lot.

229
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,072
The teacher said that
this chapter is finished.

230
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,074
So many words.

231
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,075
Don't you remember them?

232
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,066
Many I don't.

233
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,069
How do you pronounce this word?

234
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:08,086
Deliverable, Deliverable

235
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,088
What about this?

236
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,090
Communication.

237
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,093
Communication.

238
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:19,086
Be quick. The exam is near.

239
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:15,202
What do you want to do?

240
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,216
I am in the swimming team
and the guitar club.

241
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,220
I'm pretty handsome. I'm not bad.

242
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,224
What do you want to do?

243
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,215
I'm going after you.

244
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,258
Ok. Thanks.

245
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,260
I'll cook for you sometime.

246
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,253
Ok. Thanks. Bye.

247
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,258
I'm full and I'll be going home. Hey?

248
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,273
What do you want to do?

249
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:37,295
I'm going after you.

250
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:41,288
I'm full of troubles.

251
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,291
Me too.

252
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,303
The girl that I love.

253
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,318
Come here quick.

254
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,321
Come beside me.

255
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:07,314
I'll take care of you.

256
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,329
Then sing the farewell songs.

257
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:15,322
We'll never cry again.

258
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:28,346
Do you like this music?

259
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,337
I like it too.

260
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,352
Do you know what he is singing?

261
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,354
I understand.

262
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,345
I understand too.

263
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,414
Is it boring going out with me?

264
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,434
In fact I'm not so boring usually.

265
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,427
If you are more familiar with me,
I would be very interesting.

266
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,431
You know.

267
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,444
Hey.

268
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,435
What?

269
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:14,441
Do you want to kiss me?

270
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,444
So quick?

271
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,449
Here?

272
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,465
Aren't girls shy?

273
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,456
I am, too.

274
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,493
Let's swim.

275
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,484
Ok?

276
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,497
Can you?

277
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,432
No.

278
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,501
I'll teach you.

279
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,502
No. Go.

280
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,503
No. Go.

281
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:07,505
Go.

282
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,507
No.

283
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,498
Quick.

284
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,512
Quick.

285
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,503
Quick.

286
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,543
I'm going to see Lin Yuezhen.

287
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:11,618
I run here everyday.

288
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,623
Drink and then run back.

289
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,627
Come.

290
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:45,652
Teacher, are we kissing in this way?

291
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:51,669
If we are drinking like this.

292
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:55,662
Of course it isn't kissing.

293
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:03,670
Do you want to kiss me?

294
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,686
You students are still underage.

295
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,679
Don't think about these things.

296
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,686
Do you want to kiss me?

297
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:49,787
It is not allowed holding hands in school.

298
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:53,780
Zhang Shihao,
teacher wants to speak to Meng Kerou alone.

299
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,795
He's so strange.

300
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,788
What's going on?

301
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,833
Why did you look for me that day?

302
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,835
Nothing

303
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:41,839
I know who wrote "disgusting" on your desk

304
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,830
Who?

305
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,837
That one.

306
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,886
I thought you were gonna beat her

307
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,877
Loser.

308
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,891
Do you know why she wrote that on your desk?

309
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,893
How can I know.

310
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:37,895
Because she likes Zhang Shihao

311
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,899
Then it should be her who wrote that.

312
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,901
How are you with Zhang Shao?

313
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,903
We are just friends.

314
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,905
Then all I heard are only rumors?

315
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,907
Yeah, all rumors.

316
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,900
What rumors?

317
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,903
I've gotta go.

318
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,917
Bye

319
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:02,920
Bye, ride slowly.

320
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,922
Okay.

321
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:08,915
Hey, I'm full. I have to go home now.

322
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,997
Zhang Shihao

323
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:43,009
Zhang Shihao

324
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:53,030
Zhang Shihao,
please don't follow me after school.

325
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,032
Don't go to Dumpling Shop for dinner.

326
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,034
and don't come for me anymore.

327
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,025
Okay?

328
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,044
What do you mean by this?

329
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,047
It's impossible for me to like you.

330
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,040
What's wrong with me?

331
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:42,079
Why did you want me to kiss you?

332
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,081
Don't you understand?

333
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,084
It's just impossible for me to like you.

334
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:50,087
Why did you hold my hands?

335
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,089
Why?

336
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,091
Why?  Hey?

337
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,082
No reason.

338
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,096
How is you and the PE teacher?

339
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,030
Of course it's nothing!

340
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,093
But, but why did you want me to kiss you?

341
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,097
Stop bugging me!

342
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,115
Hey, why?

343
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,106
Tell me.

344
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:28,114
Why?

345
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,129
Why did you want me to kiss you?

346
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,120
Tell me.

347
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:47,144
Why did you want me to kiss you?

348
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,147
Why did you want me to kiss you?

349
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,149
Why did you want me to kiss you?

350
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:56,153
Why did you want me to kiss you?

351
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,156
Tell me a secret.

352
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,157
What?

353
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:04,150
A secret.

354
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,154
Come on.

355
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,169
Tell me a secret.

356
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,160
A secret.

357
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:21,167
You really wanna know?

358
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,184
Actually I hate swimming.

359
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,187
You see me in the swimming pool everyday.

360
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:33,190
Actually it's boring alone in there.

361
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,193
Which sport else is for one man?

362
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:39,196
Many.

363
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:43,189
But swimming feels cool.

364
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,206
But, I want to get first place in the game,

365
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,209
and get recommended to college.

366
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,211
What are you talking about?

367
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,213
I'm talking about my secret.

368
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,215
It's crap.

369
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,217
That's not a secret.

370
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,151
It's not?

371
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,210
It's not, think of another one.

372
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,227
I'm still a virgin.

373
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,229
Many people are still virgin.

374
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,230
Who?

375
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:17,223
Those who say they are.
Think of another one.

376
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,233
I have no idea.

377
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,247
What on earth do you want me to say?

378
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,238
A secret.

379
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,241
Secret.

380
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,244
Let me tell you another one.

381
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,259
I scatter.

382
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,261
What?

383
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,263
I scatter when I piss.

384
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:49,266
Like a sprinkler.

385
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,268
Not linear.

386
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,270
I don't know why.

387
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,272
Maybe the hole is too big.

388
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:59,276
Don't tell anybody!

389
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,211
Fair.

390
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:05,272
I'll tell you a secret of mine too.

391
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,284
Where are you going?

392
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,286
Don't come here!

393
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,288
Don't come here!

394
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,290
I can only tell you like this.

395
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,283
Don't come here.

396
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,302
I think Yuezhen is very nice.

397
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,304
There is no Yuezhen, isn't it?

398
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:31,297
There is, and she likes you.

399
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,303
And?

400
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,324
I'm very kind to Yuezhen,

401
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,315
I help her a lot.

402
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:54,331
Went to swimming pool for you with her.

403
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,333
Sent the letter for her.

404
00:48:56,333 --> 00:49:00,337
Took the consequences for her.

405
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:04,330
I was always helping her.

406
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:09,335
Because I really like her..

407
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:19,356
So I think, I like girls.

408
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:23,349
It's impossible for me to like you.

409
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,359
You are a really nice person.

410
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,373
I don't want to hurt you.

411
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,375
It's the worst excuse I've ever heard.

412
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,377
What excuse?

413
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,379
To refuse someone.

414
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,381
Next time I meet Yuezhen,

415
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,383
I'll tell her I'm gay too.

416
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:47,384
Belive what you want.

417
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,375
I don't believe this.

418
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:19,416
How about you and the PE teacher?

419
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,418
He just had bad luck.

420
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:25,411
I asked him if he wants to kiss me too.

421
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,417
Yeah

422
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,422
Maybe, after you kiss a boy..

423
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:42,428
You won't feel you like girls.

424
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:51,437
Then do you want to kiss me?

425
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:34,480
How do you feel?

426
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:44,490
Want another kiss?

427
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:51,497
Do you still prefer girls?

428
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:58,504
Are we done like this?

429
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:16,522
Are we done like this?

430
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:22,528
Are we done like this?

431
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:28,534
Are we done like this?

432
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:54,560
Zhang Shihao...

433
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:03,569
Are you really not dating
with Zhang Shihao?

434
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,572
I am not, of course.

435
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:11,577
Okay, let me show you one thing.

436
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,600
What are you doing?

437
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,593
If I keep writing his name using his pen,

438
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:32,598
he'll love me until the ink runs out

439
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,601
You are so smart.

440
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:40,606
The ink is almost running out.

441
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,613
You are really not dating
with Zhang Shihao?

442
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:52,629
I've told you many times.

443
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:55,632
Then... introduce me to him.

444
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,634
No

445
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,636
You know him.

446
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,571
Just introduce me to him,
that's no big deal to you.

447
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,640
No.

448
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,642
Come on.

449
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,643
No.

450
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:10,636
Come on, you know him...

451
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,639
Okay?

452
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:19,656
Will he like me?

453
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,647
No.

454
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,661
Really?

455
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,652
Yeah.

456
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,672
Zhang Shihao

457
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:53,690
Zhang Shihao, this is Lin Yuezhen.

458
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,683
She wants to date you.

459
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,691
Come on.

460
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,711
Okay, my job is done, I've got to go.

461
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,713
Wait, what should I do now?

462
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:18,715
What do you want to do?

463
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,706
What do you mean?

464
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,720
Okay, I'll wait for a while.

465
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,713
I'll call you.

466
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,808
It's here.

467
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,799
Bye.

468
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,814
Zhang Shihao.   Um?

469
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:01,751
Can you date with me?

470
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,810
Sorry..

471
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,831
Meng Kerou

472
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,834
Meng Kerou!

473
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,849
Meng Kerou!

474
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,851
Who is there?

475
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:38,844
Are you looking for Meng Kerou?

476
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,848
You...

477
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,876
Where is Yuezhen?

478
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,893
Where is Yuezhen?

479
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,895
She is cute, isn't she?

480
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:22,888
What do you mean?

481
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:26,903
What do you really mean?

482
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,905
You walked her home, didn't you?

483
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,908
What do you really mean?

484
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,910
What?

485
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,913
Boys love girls, girls love boys.

486
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,916
What meaning?

487
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,919
What do you mean?

488
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:46,912
What do you mean?

489
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,924
What do you mean?

490
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:20,946
What do you really mean?

491
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,480
I can't love Lin Yuezhen.

492
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,480
I really can't love Lin Yuezhen.

493
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:50,480
I can't love girls.

494
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,520
It won't work, and I've even kissed.

495
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,520
Have you kissed Lin Yuezhen?

496
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,520
No.

497
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:18,560
Does Lin Yuezhen know?

498
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,520
No.

499
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:25,560
If I were you, I will tell her.

500
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,560
Tell her.

501
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,560
If I told her,
we may not be able to be friends.

502
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Not everyone in this world is like you.

503
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,560
This world is actually not fair.

504
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,520
Sorry

505
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,400
For what?

506
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,400
If you were 17, all you think about
is if you can go to college or not.

507
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,400
If losing virginity
can make it linear when you pee

508
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,400
What a happy kid you will be

509
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,600
Zhang Shihao...

510
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:34,640
That's a very expensive restaurant.

511
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,640
I've never been in there.

512
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,680
The light is dark, feels so romantic.

513
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,680
And there are piano playing.

514
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,680
And there's a kind of lavender
smell in the air.

515
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,680
And good waiters there, in black suits,

516
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,680
Walking around

517
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,680
We were there until 9 o'clock.

518
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,680
Yuezhen.

519
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,600
Zhang Shao said he wants to go to my house.

520
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,680
So he went home with me

521
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,680
He sat on my bed just after entering.

522
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,680
Yuezhen

523
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,680
What?

524
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,680
Then.. my mom came back after.

525
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,720
Yuezhen, I...

526
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,720
Yuezhen, I...

527
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,800
"I'm a girl, I should like boys"

528
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,840
Hey, don't mind my friends.

529
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,840
They are not bad.

530
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:37,840
I don't know your name yet.

531
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,880
Then what kind of boys do you like?

532
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,880
Depends on my mood.

533
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,880
Then how do you feel about me.

534
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,880
I...

535
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,800
Hey...

536
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,920
Hey! It's me

537
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:10,880
Um... It's nothing actually.

538
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,920
The swimming team will have
a game on next Wednesday.

539
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,920
I hope you can come to watch it.

540
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,920
Um... and

541
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,920
and... and I wanna say...

542
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,960
What are you doing?

543
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,960
Don't cry.

544
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,960
How about we going out together, okay?

545
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,920
Come on, don't cry.

546
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,960
Hey! Lets go! Hurry!

547
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,040
Are you crazy? Coming back so late.

548
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,080
Can I sleep beside you?

549
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,080
What's going on?

550
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,040
Nothing.

551
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,040
Come on, tell me.

552
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,080
When dad passed away,

553
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,080
How did you went through that?

554
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,080
I've told you that. Are you are lovesick?

555
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,080
Is he the boy who comes here
to have dumplings everyday?

556
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,120
It's doesn't matter,
everyone has been lovesick.

557
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,120
How did you come through?

558
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,080
I don't know, I just got over it like this.

559
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:04,040
I don't really know.

560
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:10,120
It just naturally happens you know.

561
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,120
I wish to see that day soon.

562
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,200
Zhang Shihao, come on!

563
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:30,200
Channel 3, Zhang Shihao..

564
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:38,200
Channel 4,
Liu Ziqiang from Dong Shan School.

565
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,240
Ready!

566
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,280
1, 2, 3

567
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,320
Come on, smile
A, B

568
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,320
C

569
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,320
What's so funny?

570
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,320
Give us a smile.

571
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,360
Why didn't you come?

572
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,360
How did you swim?

573
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:34,360
Sucks, but it's good for you to not come.

574
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,400
I don't wanna give up.

575
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:47,360
The summer is almost gone,
I've done nothing.

576
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,400
Yeah, just hanging around

577
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,400
and do nothing

578
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,400
Haven't won any game, nothing at all.

579
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
What are you thinking?

580
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,400
What are you thinking?

581
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,440
But at least it'll leave something.

582
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,440
What kind of adult we'll be depends
on what it'll leave us.

583
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:27,440
Where did you steal this words from?

584
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,440
I'm going home.

585
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,440
Me too.

586
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,440
I win.

587
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,400
I win again.

588
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,480
I'll still win.

589
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,480
I win.

590
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,480
You win.

591
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,480
Hey, um... actually...

592
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,480
That day on the phone,
what I wanted to say is

593
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,520
if there was one day...

594
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:31,520
maybe after 1 year, or 3...

595
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,520
maybe you start to like boys.

596
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,520
You must tell me first.

597
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,520
What the heck are you laughing at?

598
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,520
I'm serious.

599
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:15,560
Xiao Shi, look..
Your colored shirt is flying..

600
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,560
I'm thinking,
After 1 year, 3 years, 5 years

601
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,560
What will we become?

602
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,560
You are kind, unclouded and free
you'll become more handsome.

603
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,400
So, I seem to see after many years

604
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,400
You are standing at one blue gate...

605
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,400
Sunshine of 3PM...

606
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,400
You have some pimples

607
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,400
You are smiling,
I run to you to ask you if you are good.

608
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,400
You nod

609
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:47,400
After 3 years,
5 years or maybe even longer.

610
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,400
What kind of adults will we become?

611
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,400
The PE teacher? Or my mom?

612
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:59,400
Though,
I can't see myself with eyes closed.

613
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,560
I can see you.

614
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:47,480
"I'm a girl, I love boys"

615
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,480
"Zhang Shihao was here"

616
01:20:03,305 --> 01:20:09,942
