What do you mean by this?



It's impossible for me to like you.



What's wrong with me?



Why did you want me to kiss you?



Don't you understand?



It's just impossible for me to like you.



Why did you hold my hands?



Why?



Why?  Hey?



No reason.



How is you and the PE teacher?



Of course it's nothing!



But, but why did you want me to kiss you?

Which sport else is for one man?



Many.



But swimming feels cool.



But, I want to get first place in the game,



and get recommended to college.



What are you talking about?



I'm talking about my secret.



It's crap.



That's not a secret.



It's not?



It's not, think of another one.



I'm still a virgin.



Many people are still virgin.



Who?



Those who say they are.
Think of another one.



I have no idea.



What on earth do you want me to say?



A secret.



Secret.



Let me tell you another one.



I scatter.



What?



I scatter when I piss.



Like a sprinkler.



Not linear.



I don't know why.



Maybe the hole is too big.



Don't tell anybody!



Fair.



I'll tell you a secret of mine too.



Where are you going?



Don't come here!



Don't come here!



I can only tell you like this.



Don't come here.



I think Yuezhen is very nice.



There is no Yuezhen, isn't it?



There is, and she likes you.



And?



I'm very kind to Yuezhen,



I help her a lot.



Went to swimming pool for you with her.



Sent the letter for her.



Took the consequences for her.



I was always helping her.



Because I really like her..



So I think, I like girls.



It's impossible for me to like you.



You are a really nice person.



I don't want to hurt you.



It's the worst excuse I've ever heard.



What excuse?



To refuse someone.



Next time I meet Yuezhen,



I'll tell her I'm gay too.



Belive what you want.



I don't believe this.



How about you and the PE teacher?



He just had bad luck.



I asked him if he wants to kiss me too.



Yeah



Maybe, after you kiss a boy..



You won't feel you like girls.



Then do you want to kiss me?



How do you feel?



Want another kiss?



Do you still prefer girls?



Are we done like this?



Are we done like this?



Are we done like this?



Are we done like this?

Okay, let me show you one thing.



What are you doing?



If I keep writing his name using his pen,



he'll love me until the ink runs out



You are so smart.



The ink is almost running out.



You are really not dating
with Zhang Shihao?



I've told you many times.



Then... introduce me to him.



No



You know him.



Just introduce me to him,
that's no big deal to you.



No.



Come on.



No.



Come on, you know him...



Okay?



Will he like me?



No.



Really?



Yeah.

Okay, my job is done, I've got to go.



Wait, what should I do now?



What do you want to do?



What do you mean?



Okay, I'll wait for a while.



I'll call you.



It's here.



Bye.



Zhang Shihao.   Um?

Sorry..



Meng Kerou

Meng Kerou!



Who is there?



Are you looking for Meng Kerou?



You...



Where is Yuezhen?



Where is Yuezhen?



She is cute, isn't she?



What do you mean?



What do you really mean?



You walked her home, didn't you?



What do you really mean?



What?



Boys love girls, girls love boys.



What meaning?



What do you mean?



What do you mean?



What do you mean?



What do you really mean?



I can't love Lin Yuezhen.



I really can't love Lin Yuezhen.



I can't love girls.



It won't work, and I've even kissed.



Have you kissed Lin Yuezhen?



No.



Does Lin Yuezhen know?



No.



If I were you, I will tell her.



Tell her.



If I told her,
we may not be able to be friends.



Not everyone in this world is like you.



This world is actually not fair.



Sorry



For what?



If you were 17, all you think about
is if you can go to college or not.



If losing virginity
can make it linear when you pee



What a happy kid you will be



Zhang Shihao...



That's a very expensive restaurant.



I've never been in there.



The light is dark, feels so romantic.



And there are piano playing.



And there's a kind of lavender
smell in the air.



And good waiters there, in black suits,



Walking around



We were there until 9 o'clock.



Yuezhen.



Zhang Shao said he wants to go to my house.



So he went home with me



He sat on my bed just after entering.



Yuezhen



What?



Then.. my mom came back after.



Yuezhen, I...



Yuezhen, I...



"I'm a girl, I should like boys"



Hey, don't mind my friends.



They are not bad.



I don't know your name yet.



Then what kind of boys do you like?



Depends on my mood.



Then how do you feel about me.



I...



Hey...



Hey! It's me



Um... It's nothing actually.



The swimming team will have
a game on next Wednesday.



I hope you can come to watch it.



Um... and



and... and I wanna say...



What are you doing?



Don't cry.



How about we going out together, okay?



Come on, don't cry.



Hey! Lets go! Hurry!



Are you crazy? Coming back so late.



Can I sleep beside you?



What's going on?



Nothing.



Come on, tell me.



When dad passed away,



How did you went through that?



I've told you that. Are you are lovesick?



Is he the boy who comes here
to have dumplings everyday?



It's doesn't matter,
everyone has been lovesick.



How did you come through?



I don't know, I just got over it like this.



I don't really know.



It just naturally happens you know.



I wish to see that day soon.



Zhang Shihao, come on!



Channel 3, Zhang Shihao..



Channel 4,
Liu Ziqiang from Dong Shan School.



Ready!



1, 2, 3



Come on, smile
A, B



C



What's so funny?



Give us a smile.



Why didn't you come?



How did you swim?



Sucks, but it's good for you to not come.



I don't wanna give up.



The summer is almost gone,
I've done nothing.



Yeah, just hanging around



and do nothing



Haven't won any game, nothing at all.



What are you thinking?



What are you thinking?



But at least it'll leave something.



What kind of adult we'll be depends
on what it'll leave us.



Where did you steal this words from?



I'm going home.



Me too.



I win.



I win again.



I'll still win.



I win.



You win.



Hey, um... actually...



That day on the phone,
what I wanted to say is



if there was one day...



maybe after 1 year, or 3...



maybe you start to like boys.



You must tell me first.



What the heck are you laughing at?



I'm serious.



Xiao Shi, look..
Your colored shirt is flying..



I'm thinking,
After 1 year, 3 years, 5 years



What will we become?



You are kind, unclouded and free
you'll become more handsome.



So, I seem to see after many years



You are standing at one blue gate...



Sunshine of 3PM...



You have some pimples



You are smiling,
I run to you to ask you if you are good.



You nod



After 3 years,
5 years or maybe even longer.



What kind of adults will we become?



The PE teacher? Or my mom?



Though,
I can't see myself with eyes closed.



I can see you.



"I'm a girl, I love boys"



"Zhang Shihao was here"
