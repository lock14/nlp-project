# <i>Now they're planning</i>
<i>the crime of the century</i> #



# <i>Well what will it be?</i> #



# <i>Read all about their schemes</i>
<i>and adventuring</i> #



# <i>It's well worth a fee</i> ##



We are living
in a glorious time,



a time of great conflict
to be sure.



<i>Today, a nationwide crackdown</i>
<i>was underway...</i>



<i>... eight men were arrested</i>
<i>from...</i>



<i>... hardcore</i>
<i>pornographic pictures.</i>



On one side of the coin
are those in favor



of absolutely no censorship.



<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>there are those who advocate</i>



<i>the government dictating to us</i>
<i>what we should see,</i>



<i>read, and hear.</i>



<i>... they say it all started</i>
<i>with the sex film</i> Deep Throat.



I saw <i>Deep Throat</i> in New York



when it first came out.



<i>People were lined up</i>



for at least three blocks.



# <i>I was once out strolling</i>
<i>one very hot summer's day</i> #



Oh, yeah, there was
a screening in some
psychoanalyst's apartment



and everybody
watched and smoked dope.
Oh, yeah.



# <i>I dreamed I was</i>
<i>in a Hollywood movie</i> #



# <i>That I was the star</i>
<i>of the movie</i> #



# <i>This really blew my mind</i> #



<i>I thought, "Fantastic.</i>



<i>"This is going to change</i>
<i>the climate</i>



"of talking about
issues of sexuality



in these United States."



# <i>Spill the wine</i>
<i>and take that pearl</i> ##



<i>I'm one of the handful</i>
<i>of people who never saw it.</i>



I didn't intend to not see it.



Perhaps you could
arrange for me to see it.



Now.



Deep Throat <i>was</i>
<i>an epochal moment</i>



in the history
of modern sexuality.



It is the first time
that respectable
middle-class women



<i>went to porn theaters.</i>



<i>It really broke down,</i>



<i>uh, traditional codes</i>
<i>of... of decorum.</i>



<i>Linda Lovelace,</i>



<i>and conversations,</i>
<i>and jokes about</i> Deep Throat,



<i>appeared</i>
<i>on network television.</i>



If the film
became mainstream,



conversation about it
became truly mainstream.



It's kind of
a strange country, isn't it?



Judges can see <i>Deep Throat,</i>
but they can't listen
to those tapes.



<i>I think the major thing</i>
<i>that set, uh,</i>



Deep Throat <i>apart was,</i>



it had a gimmick.



Ah! Ah... ah!



Well, there it is,
you little bugger,
there it is.



What?



Your clitoris, it's deep down
in the bottom of your throat.



The clitoris
hidden in the throat



was something
you could talk about
and laugh about.



It's better than having
no clitoris at all.



That's easy
for you to say.



Suppose your balls
were in your ear.



<i>I was 19 when I saw it.</i>



<i>I don't think I had found</i>
<i>where the clitoris really was.</i>



So I think the idea



that it was misplaced



on the human body
was lost on me.



L... I was looking for
the original site.



It was a giggle.



And the worst thing
to be said about us,
as Americans,



is that we'll sell
our souls for a giggle.



Listen, uh, we have
the problem solved.



All we have to do now
is find the solution.



Like what?



Like deep throat.



Deep what?



Throat.



Have you ever taken
a penis all the way down



to the bottom
of your throat?



It was a badge of
the new freedom.



<i>Have you been</i>
<i>to the experience</i>



<i>of paying to go</i>
<i>in a porno theater</i>



<i>And see a woman</i>
<i>give a blowjob</i>



<i>in a movie theater</i>
<i>in your community?</i>



<i>That was very, very new.</i>



Something that's hard
for people today to imagine,



how liberating that was.



Or... or terrible, depending on
what you believe in.



It's a floodtide of
filth that's engulfed



the minds and
hearts and souls



of America like
nothing else ever has.



<i>We have smut all over the face</i>
<i>of this country now</i>



<i>because we are letting</i>
<i>those immoral people</i>



<i>have their way</i>
<i>in our country.</i>



<i>Deep Throat</i> succeeded
commercially at least in part



because the government
went after it.



<i>The government became</i>
<i>the driving force</i>



<i>behind the public relations.</i>



<i>I just saw it and I liked it.</i>



<i>I liked it. I wanted to see</i>
<i>a dirty picture</i>
<i>and that's what I saw.</i>



<i>But I want the right</i>
<i>to see that picture.</i>



<i>I don't want somebody</i>
<i>telling me that I can't</i>
<i>see a dirty picture.</i>



<i>Deep Throat</i> attacks
the very core of our being.



<i>Every time someone</i>
<i>watches that movie,</i>



they're watching me
being raped.



Do I belong in jail
for five years
for acting in <i>Deep Throat?</i>



<i>Deep Throat</i> now
has had a phenomenal success



going on
for two-and-a-half years,



and it's only
because it's being hassled.



Do you think
it's a good movie?



No, I don't think
it's a good movie.



I'm takin' a walk,
Mrs. Brown.



I am doing fine, dear,
thank you.



# <i>I rode my bicycle</i>
<i>past your window last night</i> #



# <i>I roller-skated</i>
<i>to your door at daylight</i> #



# <i>It almost seems</i>
<i>like you're avoiding me</i> #



These are some pictures



or posters from some
of the films I've done.



# <i>Well, I got a brand new pair</i>
<i>of roller-skates</i> #



# <i>You got a brand new key</i> #



Aren't they kind of cute?



# <i>I think that we should</i>
<i>get together</i> #



A picture of Gerard, my son,
when he was a lot younger,



and my daughter
when she was younger.



# <i>You got something for me</i> #



<i>Long before</i> Deep Throat,
<i>Damiano was a family man.</i>



<i>He and his wife</i>
<i>ran a beauty salon</i>
<i>in Queens, New York.</i>



# <i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i> ##



<i>I enjoyed being a hairdresser</i>



<i>because I always</i>
<i>could relate to women.</i>



<i>After you got to know</i>
<i>the woman,</i>



<i>especially when you</i>
<i>worked on them weekly,</i>



you start to get into history



about "we went to the movies"
and "he did this and I did..."



And realize that most...



most of the women
were very unhappy



in their relationship



with the person that
they were married to



and supposedly
in love with.



<i>After 40 years of marriage,</i>
<i>you know, you can get</i>



<i>tired of the good old</i>
<i>in and out.</i>



You... you got to be intimate.
It was almost like a priest.



I mean, I... I don't wanna say
I was a priest,



but it was almost like...
it was almost like
a confessor.



<i>The confessions Damiano heard</i>
<i>in his salon,</i>



<i>made him realize he</i>
<i>was on the frontlines</i>
<i>of a sexual revolution.</i>



<i>We grew up in a time</i>



in which sex itself
was largely taboo.



<i>When I was a kid,</i>
<i>young people didn't even know</i>
<i>where babies came from.</i>



<i>I'd love to know.</i>



If I watch
the rest of this program,
will I know the answer?



Gore Vidal would be very good
on the subject.



You must take into account
how ignorant people are.



<i>Particularly our countrymen,</i>



who have never taken
a course in biology,



never read a book.



Do you know anything
about the facts of life?



Not very much,
I'm afraid.



<i>The facts of life</i>
<i>and sexual morality in general</i>



<i>were forbidden topics.</i>



<i>But as all that changed,</i>
<i>issues about sexuality</i>



<i>began to divide society.</i>



<i>Artificial contraception</i>
<i>is wrong.</i>



<i>Evil.</i>



<i>People were experimenting.</i>



<i>They were looking</i>
<i>for new kinds of lives.</i>



They were looking to break out
of all the old molds.



<i>And we knew</i>
<i>the American public were tired</i>



<i>of words like "coitus."</i>



They wanted words,
like "fuck,"



and "suck," and "eat my cunt."



I think the more that
filth is thrown at Americans



the less favored it becomes.



They're depicting sex
in a very filthy way.



<i>Jackie Kennedy</i>
<i>went to see that.</i>



The next week,
the gross doubled.



L... I don't mind
seeing sex in a... in a movie
just for its own sake



because I think that's one
of the, you know,



more interesting
human emotions.



<i>Sex was in movies.</i>
<i>Sex was on TV.</i>



Sex came out of the closet.



<i>You had to be there.</i>
<i>You had to be there.</i>



<i>I'm thrilled</i>
<i>that I was there.</i>



And thank God
I had a camera with me.



<i>As the sexual revolution</i>
<i>swept through society,</i>



<i>people took sides</i>
<i>in a culture war</i>
<i>that was gathering steam.</i>



<i>Gerry Damiano</i>
<i>Joined the fray by swapping</i>



<i>his blow dryer</i>
<i>for a movie camera.</i>



<i>I loved film.</i>
<i>L... I always did.</i>



<i>The only thing you could make</i>
<i>was sex films.</i>



Uh, that was the only thing
you were allowed to make



and you made them
at a low budget.



Doing hardcore films
in those days, the early '70s,



<i>was very much</i>
<i>like summer stock.</i>



It was like,



"Daddy has a barn,
let's do a show."



Oh, my!



Oh!



Lt... it was the only choice
we had.



Till 24 years old
without,



you know, uh, uh,



what do you call it, uh,
a track record, you know.



And these things
were so inexpensive.



Okay, what I want now is
some of your ass,



all right?



<i>I meant business.</i>



<i>I approached those films as if</i>



I was Luc Godard
or somebody, you know.



And just wiggle it
towards us.



I want to fill up
40 feet of screen
with your ass.



You're always
after my ass.



Keep wigglin'.



That's where I met
half of the people



that I became
acquainted with.



We were all working
for nothing.



Well, one of
Gerry's motivations



was to get laid.



Really. And he did.



<i>You could make a living</i>



<i>if you were a filmmaker,</i>
<i>making these films.</i>



Quite a number of people
became legitimate
Hollywood directors



out of the porn industry.



I mean, for a while there,
it was kinda like
the entry level job



that you would do.



<i>Uh, you would</i>
<i>work on... on porn.</i>



I'm... I... I certainly
worked on them.



I'm not gonna say
which ones,
but I... I was around it.



<i>All of sudden, there was</i>
<i>a new word.</i>



<i>It was called "filmmaker."</i>



<i>You became</i>
<i>an independent filmmaker.</i>



We were actually doing it



And we couldn't believe it.



We couldn't believe it,
and thank God there was,



there was such
a thing as sex.



<i>There was sex,</i>
<i>but at the time,</i>



<i>the only way to put</i>
<i>hardcore sex</i>
<i>on the screen legally,</i>



<i>was in sex education films.</i>



My name is
Dr. Morris Rosengarden.



<i>They would show sexual scenes,</i>



but they couldn't be accused
of pornography



because it had
an educational value.



<i>Some men</i>
<i>find their wives' buttocks</i>



<i>very stimulating visually.</i>



We needed a father figure
for almost everything.



<i>This may be uncomfortable</i>



<i>for the obese</i>
<i>or older couples.</i>



<i>Why did you need a doctor</i>
<i>to tell you it was okay?</i>



<i>And I said,</i>



"Hey, instead of
discussing not doing it,



let's do it
and don't even discuss it."



<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>to be ashamed of.</i>



<i>But there was plenty</i>
<i>to be afraid of.</i>



<i>In addition to</i>
<i>running the risk of arrest</i>
<i>and incarceration,</i>



<i>the criminal underworid</i>
<i>virtually controlled</i>



<i>the production of pornography.</i>



<i>There was something exciting</i>
<i>about it.</i>



It... it lived in some,
uh, mid-worid



between crime and art



<i>and it was adventurous.</i>



Young people today
would be in it for the money



whereas in the old days,
it was for the rebellion.



<i>Frankly, everybody</i>
<i>in one way or another</i>



<i>was connected to that business</i>



because psychologically,
socially, it was happening.



<i>You know, it was part</i>
<i>of a social movement</i>



<i>at the time.</i>



Anybody who took chances



in breaking the social mores
of the time,



was considered a hero.



<i>I believed in it.</i>



I believed that it was
about time to say



that sex
is a beautiful thing,



the human body is
a beautiful thing,



and you really
shouldn't be ashamed of it.



<i>Securing financial backing</i>
<i>from partners</i>



<i>with underworid connections,</i>



<i>Damiano raised</i>
<i>enough money to shoot</i>
<i>a hardcore sex feature.</i>



<i>It was going to be called</i>
The Doctor Makes a House Call.



<i>Then Damiano met his muse,</i>



<i>Linda Lovelace,</i>
<i>and everything changed.</i>



To me, I always looked at her
as the girl next door.



<i>Before she became worid-famous</i>
<i>as Linda Lovelace,</i>



<i>Linda Boreman</i>
<i>dreamt of opening</i>
<i>a clothing boutique</i>



<i>until she met Chuck Traynor.</i>



<i>I guess he was an escape</i>
<i>for her.</i>



She was not comfortable
living in her parents' home.



And he took her away
from that.



<i>But things</i>
<i>started getting strange.</i>



<i>Linda told me</i>
<i>that she had quit smoking,</i>



and I said,
"Well, how did you do it,
how did you quit?"



She said that
Chuck had hypnotized her.



<i>She said every time</i>
<i>she tried to have a cigarette,</i>



<i>that she would hiccup.</i>



I'm like, "Oh, well, okay."



<i>Within a year,</i>
<i>they were married.</i>



I curse the day that
she ever met



Chuck Traynor.



Unfortunately, he died
before I could kill him,



so lucky for him.



Then I lost contact
and her mother told me that



uh, they're living in New York
and he's doing



documentary films,



and I thought,
"How nice, how exciting."



<i>Chuck had come to my office</i>



<i>and I needed a scene</i>
<i>for another film.</i>



He says, "Well,
Linda can do something."



You know, she...
There was no name for it.



He says,
"She gives head very well."



I said,
"Well, that's wonderful."



So we set up with her
and an actor



to do a... a bit
for another film.



And when I saw
what she could do,



I says, "Stop the cameras."



All I could think about was
what she was doing



was so unique



that I could build
a whole film around it.



Making a motion picture
specifically about
that sexual act,



l... I found very daring
and very courageous.



<i>The first thing that came</i>
<i>to my mind was... was the title</i>



of <i>Deep, Deep Throat.</i>



Because something happened
deep down in... in her throat.



What? The clitoris
is in her throat?



Gerry, you can't do this.



You can't do this.
It's absurd, it's silly.



Nobody will believe it.



I thought it was,



You know,



absurd. I did.



Believe it or not,
some people said,
"What is this, a medical film?



What are you gonna do?
With doctors?"



I said, "No. No."



Somebody said it should be
<i>The Sword Swallower.</i>



I said, "No, no. <i>Deep Throat,</i>
believe me, it'll work.
It'll work."



And, uh,



I'm glad I didn't change it
to <i>The Sword Swallower.</i>



<i>I, kind of,</i>
<i>had the whole thing</i>



<i>in... in my head driving over</i>
<i>the 59th Street Bridge.</i>



<i>That weekend,</i>
<i>I wrote the script</i>



<i>and we... we were ready</i>
<i>to do it.</i>



<i>And I spoke to</i>
<i>my production manager,</i>



<i>Ronnie Wertheim.</i>



The phone rang.
It was Gerry. All excited.



And I told him to bring
all our cast and crew



down to Florida.
We're going to make the film.



<i>I just called, uh,</i>
<i>Harry Reems.</i>



He came as
a production assistant.



He wasn't even supposed
to be in the film.



<i>When we got to Florida,</i>
<i>we all checked into</i>



<i>this, uh, motel,</i>
<i>I think it was called</i>
<i>The Voyager.</i>



<i>As we pulled in,</i>
<i>we saw Linda Lovelace</i>



lying on the lawn with her...



You know what her
pussycat's name was?



Adolf Hitler.
He had a mustache like that.



We came from New York



with the promise of
having locations.



<i>To me, it was nothing.</i>



I thought nothing of it.
I thought it was just
a... a piece of shit film.



Probably one of
the worst porno movies
ever made.



He's nuts.
Lenny Camp was nuts.



He was one of
the guys that were lining up
everything for us.



<i>And, uh, we got nothing.</i>



If it wasn't for us,



this guy would look like
a piece of shit,



which he really is.



The only thing that saved us,
I said, "Wait a minute,



"we're at The Voyager Motel,
let's go back and shoot



<i>what we were supposed to do</i>
<i>here in the pool. "</i>



From that moment on,
everybody was
location hunting.



One of the locations
that we shot at
down in Florida,



was at this, uh,
home in Coconut Grove



that was owned by a guy
who called himself a count.



He's not a count.
He's a horseshit count.



He is no count,
he's fucking Sepy Dobronyi.



And God knows
if that's his real name.



When we came,
they had this elaborate,



elaborate, elaborate
wine cellar.



Should we go
to the wine cellar?



Yes.



# <i>Yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> #



# <i>Yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> #



# <i>Yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> ##



If it was planned,
it would not have
been as exciting,



'cause we were just rushing
from one place to another.



You all right?



Yeah, I'm fine,
what makes you say that?



You,
the way you're acting.



<i>In the very beginning,</i>
<i>there were no</i>



<i>porno actors and actresses.</i>



So everybody
had to be taught.



The actors are all shit.



Not... not taught
in the sense of taught.



Taught how to be natural.



Sex,



it makes me feel sort of
tingly all over.



And then...



And then what?



Nothing.



I mean, there should be
more to sex
than a lot of little tingles.



There should be
bells ringing,



dams bursting,
bombs going off, something.



Do you want to get off
or do you want
to wreck a city?



Helen, please, be serious.



Gerry knew nothing about it.



He knew nothing about acting,
he knew nothing about, um...



He knew nothing.
He knew nothing.



But as a swinger himself,



he had a feel
for how to get people



in a sexual mood.



# <i>Do you wanna touch me?</i> #



# <i>Do you wanna touch me?</i>
<i>Do you wanna touch me? Yeah</i> ##



The really important thing
was Harry Reems.



<i>I couldn't find</i>
<i>anybody in Florida</i>



<i>that could even come close</i>
<i>to doing the role.</i>



So at one point,
I fired him off the crew,



And hired him as the lead,
and thank God he was there,



because I... I don't know
of anybody



that could have even
come close to doing



the job that he did,



as... as the wacky doctor.



I want to hear bells.



Bells?



Bombs.
Bombs?



And dams bursting.



The rockets' red glare.



No, he's not an actor,
he knows that.



Bombs bursting
in air.



# Gave proof through the night
that our flag
was still there ##



He... he would get an erection



at the sound
of the camera motor.



That explains a lot.



You know, I... I, uh,
I never had a problem



um, getting an erection.



# <i>Oh, yeah, Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i> ##



<i>Linda had the hots</i>
<i>for Harry Reems.</i>



<i>And the morning</i>
<i>we were gonna do</i>



<i>the deep throat scene,</i>



<i>she came to me</i>
<i>and she was very upset,</i>



and she says,



"Chuck is... is... is so jealous
of Harry Reems



<i>that I don't think</i>
<i>I can do a good job. "</i>



<i>Chuck was a member</i>
<i>of our crew.</i>



Production manager
sent him to...



Uh, we said
we're running out of film.



<i>So he went to Miami</i>
<i>to buy film</i>



<i>when we shot the scene,</i>



Linda was completely relaxed,
and she did a marvelous job.



Uh, when I saw her do that,
yes, it is kind of amazing.



Kind of amazing.
It really is.



Surprised?
I was flabbergasted.



I had no idea.



<i>This was the moment</i>
<i>that heterosexual film</i>



<i>became interested in blowjobs.</i>



<i>I mean, it's not that</i>
<i>fellatio didn't exist.</i>



Certainly, you see
fellatio in stag films.



Um, but you don't
get this fellatio



as figured as



the be-all and end-all,



as the absolute pleasure.



<i>The thing that</i>
<i>you have to remember</i>



<i>about fellatio is,</i>



<i>historically, it had</i>
<i>been considered illegal</i>



<i>and referred to</i>
<i>as the abominable,</i>



detestable crimes
against nature.



Deep throat was not a term



that my girlfriends and I
really knew anything about.



Most of us had never
even heard of oral sex
or how to perform it.



And people
who wouldn't have dreamed



of going near
that sort of matter



in the '40s and '50s,
and certainly in the '30s,



because that was dirty,
that was low sex,
that was dreadful,



began to see it
as an enrichment.



And I'll just mention
that ejaculate,



I've always known,
was good for the complexion.



It's full of babies,
its... it's full of protein,



it's full of, uh, plasma.



And to rub it
all over your face
and neck and chest,



a lot of women know that
that's a good thing to do,



not for him but for you.



<i>Gerry returned to New York</i>
<i>to edit his film.</i>



<i>But there was still</i>
<i>one thing he needed.</i>



<i>A mind-blowing</i>
<i>cinematic female orgasm:</i>



<i>Proof of the success</i>
<i>of Linda's quest</i>



<i>for sexual satisfaction.</i>



People didn't
understand that women,



uh, could have as much...



feel as much pleasure
as men did.



Somehow, nobody ever
acknowledged



there was such a thing
as an orgasm for a woman.



That was all male stuff.



<i>It is harder to show</i>
<i>female pleasure.</i>



It's harder to show
female pleasure,



and to believe
that it's actually happening.



That's why I wanted
to show it.



<i>I went to the film archives</i>



<i>in... in Washington</i>



<i>and got footage of a rocket</i>



and then did
subliminal cutting
with... with the rocket



and... and Linda,
back and forth.



<i>This is a male fantasy</i>
<i>that says:</i>



"I like to have
my cock sucked.



I really get off on it,
therefore she must, too."



I think that was
a hell of a shot.



Look, men want to believe



that the clitoris
is in a woman's throat.



Because if they believe
that the clitoris
is in a woman's throat,



then they can believe
that by thrusting



their penis
into a woman's mouth,



she gets as much pleasure
as they do.



Guess what? It's not true.



Uh, you know,
l... I guess, uh,



<i>Deep Throat</i> opened up
a... a, uh, a can of worms.



# <i>Get down, get down,</i>
<i>get down, get down</i> #



<i>When hardcore pornography</i>
<i>is permitted</i>



<i>to corrupt the minds</i>
<i>of children,</i>



<i>then the time has come</i>
<i>for new moral leadership</i>



<i>to make itself felt</i>
<i>in America.</i>



<i>Before</i> Deep Throat
<i>was even shot,</i>



<i>politics and pornography</i>
<i>were on a collision course.</i>



<i>In 1968,</i>
<i>the government launched</i>
<i>a scientific commission</i>



<i>to determine if pornography</i>
<i>really was harmful.</i>



# <i>Jungle Boogie</i> #



# <i>Jungle Boogie,</i>
<i>Get it on</i> #



# <i>Get it on</i> ##



<i>Well, today, the final results</i>
<i>were published.</i>



<i>The presidential commission</i>
<i>recommended doing away</i>



<i>with most of the laws</i>
<i>that cover pornography,</i>



<i>because they don't</i>
<i>seem to be doing much good,</i>



<i>and because pornography</i>
<i>doesn't seem to do much harm</i>
<i>to the adult mind.</i>



<i>For one brief shining moment,</i>
<i>it did look like</i>



society was going to become



a little more adult
about their sexuality.



<i>But committee member</i>
<i>Charles Keating,</i>



<i>appointed by President Nixon,</i>



<i>fought to dismiss</i>
<i>the findings.</i>



<i>Obscenity does indeed effect.</i>



<i>The effect it has</i>
<i>is detrimental to society.</i>



Charles Keating was
a notorious censorship bug.



Later on, of course,
we discovered he was
a good deal more.



He was a swindler
and went to prison.



<i>The president said today,</i>
<i>"So long as I am</i>
<i>in the White House,</i>



<i>"there will be no relaxation</i>
<i>of the national effort</i>



<i>to control</i>
<i>and eliminate smut. "</i>



<i>Then Nixon persuaded</i>
<i>the Senate</i>



<i>to reject the report,</i>
<i>suppressing its findings.</i>



Everybody forgot about



the President's commission
on pornography,



because they... they
didn't come out



with the answer
they were looking for.



Instead, Nixon got reelected,



after being declared
politically dead,



and the forces of repression
came in,



in a huge, huge way.



<i>He knew all the buttons</i>
<i>to press.</i>



Sodomy...



I mean, everybody starts
to vibrate like a gong.



We lie about human sexuality,
because we're taught
to lie about everything.



<i>When you have a nation</i>
<i>that totally lies,</i>



then you have
no reality.



<i>The message was clear:</i>



<i>Cleaning up porn</i>
<i>was good politics.</i>



<i>And what better place to start</i>
<i>than Times Square,</i>



<i>the nation's capital of sleaze</i>



<i>and the site</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat's <i>premiere</i>



<i>in June 1972.</i>



<i>A good many</i>
<i>of the so-called perverts</i>



<i>are attracted to 42nd Street</i>



and we've had complaints.



# <i>Superfly</i> ##



<i>Suddenly, I see a movie</i>
<i>that knocks my socks off.</i>



And here's
the wonderful thing:



This film, <i>Deep Throat,</i>
is funny.



And Linda's a wonderful,
wonderful cocksucker.



God, I wish my wives
could suck dick like that.



<i>And I give it 100 points</i>
<i>on the Peter-Meter.</i>



<i>"Peter" means</i>
<i>how many hard-ons do I get.</i>



Now it would take
5,000 Viagra



to get me hard,



but then I'm virile and young
and I get many hard-ons.



<i>New Yorkers greet it</i>
<i>with the same</i>
<i>enthusiasm as I did.</i>



It was a joy.



As we say in Israel,
it was a mitzvah.



<i>I have the privilege</i>
<i>of announcing</i>

<i>the Times Square</i>
<i>Development Council.</i>

<i>was the perfect target</i>



<i>for New York's campaign</i>
<i>to clean up porn</i>



<i>and the police moved in.</i>



<i>I first became aware</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat



when it was, uh,
it was advertised
in the papers.



It was the talk of the office,
you know, "Look at this."



<i>Being in the industry,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>



<i>we all ran out to see it.</i>



It was stunning.



<i>The cinematography,</i>
<i>for a porno movie,</i>
<i>was very good.</i>



The movie was funny.



It had the kind of lines
in it, uh, that were amusing.



Mind if I smoke
while you're eating?



No, not at all.



It was definitely
a change of pace,



definitely
a change of pace.



We knew that this was, uh,
this was something different.



# <i>Love, love is strange</i> ##



<i>I think they picked</i>
<i>on</i> Deep Throat



<i>because it was</i>
<i>the highest profile.</i>



If they could, uh,
successfully prosecute
<i>Deep Throat,</i>



uh, then they felt that



the other prosecutions
would be easier.



<i>Not once, not twice,</i>
<i>but three times</i>



<i>the police raided</i> Deep Throat,



<i>staging their final raid</i>
<i>for the cameras.</i>



<i>This was political.</i>



<i>If nobody records the arrest,</i>



<i>then nobody will know</i>



that they are doing their job
in fighting sin.



Do you... you consider
what you're running
pornographic, sir?



If it was pornographic,



they could prosecute
in a diligent, proper manner.



They wouldn't have to
come around in hoards of 50



and take signs
out of windows



and act like
the Gestapo of old.



This theater that had not done
$5,000 a week in 20 years,



was running
virtually 20 hours a day.



<i>It never stopped running.</i>



The owners really couldn't
afford to shut it down.



They didn't want
to shut it down.



And so, uh, there... there was
going to be a trial.



Deep Throat's <i>defense</i>
<i>produced expert witnesses</i>



<i>to argue that the film was</i>
<i>more enlightening</i>
<i>than merely obscene.</i>



<i>But the prosecution countered</i>



<i>that this sexual satisfaction</i>
<i>was dangerous to women</i>



<i>because</i> Deep Throat <i>emphasized</i>
<i>the wrong kind of orgasm:</i>



<i>The clitoral orgasm.</i>



<i>I remember that the judge</i>
<i>hadn't heard the term.</i>



And, uh,
so he expressed surprise



and asked the question,
"What's that?"



<i>Here, just outside and above</i>
<i>the vaginal opening</i>



<i>Is the clitoris.</i>



<i>The clitoris.</i>



He should have been
sitting in my classes



because he would have
heard me say loud and clear



that let's get away
from that idea,



which still
some people have,



that, uh,
a vaginal orgasm



is, um, more satisfying
for a woman



than a clitoral orgasm.
No such thing.



<i>At that time, a real orgasm</i>
<i>could only happen</i>



<i>if you were with a man</i>



<i>and his penis</i>
<i>was inside of you</i>



and that was total,
utter nonsense, of course.



Sex is not only for penises.



Uh, sex is something
for women.



<i>The clitoris.</i>



<i>This tiny organ,</i>



<i>about the size and shape</i>
<i>of a garden pea,</i>



<i>is the seat</i>
<i>of sexuality in women.</i>



I think the judge
learned a lot during the trial



as I... Look,
l... I certainly did myself.



<i>As the judge retired</i>
<i>to consider his verdict,</i>



<i>ticket sales almost doubled,</i>



<i>prompting a young reporter</i>
<i>from the</i> New York Times
<i>to write an article</i>



<i>that would give the film</i>
<i>mainstream legitimacy.</i>



<i>I remember</i>
<i>writing the article.</i>



<i>Uh, the... the headline</i>
<i>was "Porno chic."</i>



I wrote it on a typewriter.



<i>People look</i>
<i>at the</i> Times <i>as a validator.</i>



And they see,
if... if the <i>Times</i> can
write about <i>Deep Throat,</i>



well, then it must be safe
in some way.



<i>The week the article</i>
<i>hit the stands,</i>



<i>the film's box office soared</i>



<i>as people rushed</i>
<i>to see the film</i>
<i>in record numbers.</i>



<i>Approximately how many people</i>
<i>have seen</i> Deep Throat?



Approximately
1,700 people a day
have been in to see the film.



Are you looking forward
to this movie?



Yes, I am.



People from Central Park West
and Fifth Avenue
and Park Avenue



wanted to go down and see it
and go slumming.



<i>There was a private showing.</i>
<i>Before I knew what happened,</i>



there was, like,
group sex happening,
left, right, and center.



<i>Since this is supposed to be</i>
<i>it of its genre,</i>



and since it's had this piece
in the <i>New York Times,</i>



I might as well see it
if it's going.



What are you expecting to see?



Well, uh,



you might close me down if I
said what I was going to say.



It took porn out of the realm
of the forbidden.



Why, there's nothing wrong
with a normal man



going to
a pornographic movie.



Normal, all right,
but why were you there?



You would see
movie stars there.



<i>You would see</i>
<i>society people there.</i>



I went to see <i>Deep Throat</i>
because I'm fond
of animal pictures.



I thought it was
about giraffes.



90 percent
of the people there
are asthmatics.



What do you mean,
asthmatics?



'Cause all I could hear
was...



People weren't jerking off



when, you know, I don't know
who's sitting next
to Angela Lansbury.



Oh, I'm just picking her out,
but... but basically,



because she'd just
put a damper on things.



What did you say the name of
that movie was?



Uh, <i>Deep Threat.</i>



You'd better hurry up
before you miss the opening



'cause you don't
wanna miss the opening.



In the opening, Linda...



Deep Throat <i>was so successful</i>



<i>that it turned Linda Lovelace</i>
<i>from an unknown</i>



<i>into a celebrity</i>
<i>and poster-child</i>
<i>for the new porn chic.</i>



I made $1,200
for <i>Deep Throat.</i>



And that's all?



Yeah.



What about...



I'm, you know, now I'm known,
so it's okay.



<i>It was about 11:00 at night</i>



<i>and we were</i>
<i>watching television.</i>



And we saw this
theater and it said,



you know, Linda Lovelace,
<i>Deep Throat</i>
or whatever it was.



And, uh, I said,
"Oh, disgusting.



Absolutely disgusting."



<i>A girlfriend of mine</i>
<i>called and said,</i>



<i>"Pick up</i> Playboy Magazine.



If that's not Linda,
I'll eat the magazine."



So I stopped, I picked it up,



'cause it wasn't allowed
in my house.



<i>And I opened it up</i>
<i>and I read it</i>



and I said, "Oh, my God."



And I knew then, it was...
it was our Linda.



That was difficult for me,
to see the movie.



When we got home,
I threw myself across the bed
and started bawling.



I was crying like, I'd, um,



like I just found out
someone I loved had died.



<i>And, uh,</i>



and it wasn't, um...



It wasn't just, uh, you know,



a sleazy little film on a...
on a small screen



with a bunch of guys
in trench coats there.



I mean, there were,
society was there.



I didn't know how
Linda was going to be
able to deal with that.



<i>The next time I spoke to her,</i>
<i>she said, "I'm sorry,</i>



"I didn't want you to know,



'cause I knew you'd be upset
or you'd be angry."



I said, "I'm not angry
'cause I don't know
who Linda Lovelace is.



I only know who you are."



The pornographic film
Deep Throat



has become
one of the most popular



and profitable blue movies
of all time.



Today, a Manhattan
criminal court judge
ruled the film obscene,



and ordered it removed
from theaters
in New York City.



<i>A Sodom and Gomorrah</i>
<i>gone wild before the fire.</i>



<i>He believed he was writing</i>
<i>for posterity.</i>



<i>Now you and I know,</i>
<i>in retrospect,</i>



that he accomplished
absolutely nothing.



<i>I readily perform</i>
<i>the operation</i>



<i>by finding</i>
<i>the defendant guilty</i>
<i>as charged.</i>



I still think
what the Worid Theatre did
on its marquee



was better than what he wrote
in his opinion.



<i>"Throat cut, worid mourns."</i>



<i>It's a picture</i>
<i>that'll never die.</i>



I mean, we'll all die,
but <i>Deep Throat</i> won't die.



<i>Shutting</i> Deep Throat <i>down</i>
<i>in New York</i>



<i>only spurred</i>
<i>audiences' interest</i>
<i>across the country.</i>



<i>Wherever it opened,</i>
<i>authorities scrambled</i>
<i>to shut it down.</i>



<i>This trash that's being shown</i>
<i>on our movie screens</i>



<i>across the country.</i>



There isn't any question
in my mind that it's obscene.



<i>By the mid '70s,</i> Deep Throat
<i>had been tried</i>



<i>in more than 32 cities...</i>



<i>... and was ultimately banned</i>
<i>in 23 states.</i>



Violation of the law.
It's a simple thing.



It's obscene as hell to me.



Hmm.



<i>Ordered to stop the spread</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat,



<i>the FBI stepped in.</i>



<i>They began with the arrest</i>
<i>of Gerry Damiano.</i>



The first question
the prosecutor asked me:



Did I know what...



what affiliation
m- my partners had?



<i>And I said as far as I know,</i>
<i>he's a Roman Catholic.</i>



<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>I'm... I'm part of the mob.</i>



No. I was...
I was never a mob.



<i>There were originally</i>
<i>three partners</i>



<i>who made the movie.</i>



<i>His two partners came to him,</i>
<i>Damiano told me,</i>



and told him
they were buying him out.



And I said to him
that didn't sound
like a very good, uh, deal,



uh, when you're
a one-third partner
of a project



that is just, you know,
bringing in
bucket-loads of money



and you're suddenly
cut out of the deal.



Uh, why didn't he object?



And he rolled his eyes
and he wouldn't say anymore.



And the... the only thing
he told me was he didn't want
his legs broken.



No, it was easier for me
to... to say:



"L... I don't,
I don't want to have
anything to do with it."



It was easier.
It was a lot easier.



It was, kind of a...
it was, kind of a...



a thing I could not
have won.



That's about as far as
I could go with it.



<i>Damiano wasn't alone.</i>



<i>Across the country,</i>
<i>theater owners discovered</i>



<i>exhibiting</i> Deep Throat
<i>also meant</i>



<i>running with the mob.</i>



One day,
I pick up the <i>New York Times,</i>



and in it,
it says it is very chic



<i>to see</i> Deep Throat.



So that gave me an idea



to see if I can get
the picture for Florida.



<i>Luckily,</i>
<i>I knew one of the men</i>



<i>that was connected</i>
<i>with the picture.</i>



<i>And I didn't think</i>
<i>it could run in Florida.</i>



And so,
I was given the picture
for a very reasonable amount.



I never would have
dreamt of opening
that picture anywheres



if it wasn't for that article.



If we don't get sued,
it will be a miracle.



Terry, please, Terry.
It's almost over.



I think it's enough.
Cut. Finished.



It's almost over.
It's enough.



It's almost over.



L... I think
it's enough already.



You don't realize
how people pick up
on things.



What are they
picking up on, Terry?



They're picking up on things
in Miami Beach.



You... you just said
they do bad things.



They could
call you up on this.



Come on, Artie,
don't be stupid.



You're a grown man.



Cut.



Terry.



# <i>Making a living</i>
<i>the old, hard way</i> #



# <i>Taking and giving</i>
<i>my day by day</i> #



# <i>I dig the snow and rain</i>
<i>and bright sunshine</i> #



<i>My name is Bill Kelly.</i>



# <i>Draggin' the line</i> ##



The reason there were
so many more



obscenity cases



after 1972



<i>was because I went out</i>
<i>and looked for 'em.</i>



I knew it was a gamble



because of New York
having problems with the city,



that it was on trial.



<i>I opened the picture</i>
<i>and the next thing I knew</i>



<i>we had lines</i>
<i>around the corner.</i>



There must have been,



I'm guessing 100 or 150 people
in line when they opened.



Every fucking FBI agent
in the country
was sitting in the audience.



Kelly was there
and everything else.



<i>You walked into the theater.</i>



There's just a,
sort of a bent-nosed,



middle-aged guy
with a very rough voice.



<i>He says, "$5."</i>



So I gave him $5 and said:
"Where is the ticket?"



He said,
"No tickets, just go on in."



The movie started



and about 50 of them
got up and said:



"It's a sex picture,
get me out! Get me out!



It's a sex picture,
I can't stand it."



<i>Not only was it a violation</i>



<i>of the obscenity law</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>



<i>it was also</i>
<i>a highly organized</i>
<i>crime enterprise.</i>



<i>I didn't know</i>



<i>who the Peraino gang was</i>
<i>at that time.</i>



<i>But I soon found out</i>
<i>when I started investigating</i>



<i>that they were heavyweights</i>
<i>out of New York.</i>



<i>They were part of</i>
<i>the Colombo family operation</i>



<i>who had moved</i>
<i>to Fort Lauderdale area.</i>



I haven't seen them
since I... I left.



And I want to make sure
l... I don't get a phone call



or get a knock on the door
that they want to talk to me.



Because I've been
away from them for 30 years.



And I... I... I'd like it
to be that way.



This is... this is shit
as far as I'm concerned.



Excuse my language
but I can't stand it.



He can tell you things,
your hair would
stand up on your heads.



I didn't mention
any of those things,
Terry.



What?
I didn't mention any of them.



I don't... I don't
want you to.



I didn't.



We haven't heard
in 32 years.



Thank God.



So, how do you know?



I don't know
if they're living.



They could be dead,
Terry.



<i>In its second year of release,</i>



Deep Throat <i>was still</i>
<i>number 11 on the charts.</i>



<i>It's a dirty movie.</i>



<i>Look, try to look at it</i>
<i>as a satire of</i>
<i>contemporary sexual mores</i>



<i>with lots of</i>
<i>redeeming social values.</i>



<i>Porn chic was all the rage.</i>



<i>Films like Damiano's</i>
The Devil in Miss Jones



<i>and</i> Behind the Green Door



<i>followed on the heels</i>
<i>of</i> Deep Throat's
<i>unprecedented success,</i>



<i>giving Hollywood films</i>
<i>a run for their money.</i>



<i>The studios were in shambles</i>
<i>in the early '70s.</i>



There's this movie out there,
everyone's going to see it.



How does that affect you
and the pictures
you should be making?



<i>I've been the first one</i>
<i>to go down the path.</i>



<i>I'd like to see, uh,</i>
<i>legitimate films</i>



<i>and so-called</i>
<i>pornographic films</i>
<i>merge together.</i>



<i>I think the two industries</i>
<i>have got to merge together.</i>



<i>Thank you for making me</i>



<i>the first woman president</i>
<i>to go down in history.</i>



<i>They were shooting porn films</i>
<i>on the lot at Paramount.</i>



This is a little known fact.



So Paramount became sort of
confiscated by
the porn industry.



<i>Do you see yourself</i>
<i>as a pioneer?</i>



<i>No.</i>



<i>If it's left alone,</i>
<i>within a year,</i>



<i>sex will just blend itself</i>
<i>into film.</i>



It's inevitable.



The only thing
that's uncertain
is... is the time it will take.



<i>But the merger of hardcore</i>
<i>and movies never happened.</i>



<i>Instead, the Supreme Court,</i>
<i>packed with</i>
<i>4 Nixon appointees,</i>



<i>made a radical change</i>
<i>to the obscenity law</i>



<i>in June 1973.</i>



Yesterday, the Supreme Court
authorized wider restrictions



on the exhibition
and sale of obscenity.



<i>The recent Supreme Court</i>
<i>decision</i>



<i>gave local officials the right</i>
<i>to decide for themselves</i>
<i>what is pornographic</i>



<i>without having to be guided</i>
<i>by a national standard.</i>



<i>Here in New York City today,</i>



vice squad police
began cracking down
on pornography.



<i>Linda, as you may know,</i>
<i>the Supreme Court recently,</i>



uh, handed down
a, uh,
decision on pornography.



I don't think
anybody should
regulate anything.



I think it should be, uh,



I don't believe in censorship.
I don't believe in
anything that they are doing.



But how far can you extend
individual rights



before you hit, uh,
the state of anarchy?



Uh, I really... I don't know.



Have you ever
thought about that?



No. I don't know what's
the state of ana-anarchy.



Well, it's...
That's when everyone does
precisely what he pleases



and, uh,
society has no rules.



At that point,
you've reached anarchy.



Uh, I don't know
about that,
to be honest with you.



I just don't believe
in censorship.



I don't...
That's taking away
your freedom.



That's taking away
your individual right



to make up your own mind
for things.



The last person
that started censorship
was Adolf Hitler.



And look
what happened there.



<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>the FBI was closing in</i>



<i>on</i> Deep Throat
<i>and its distribution.</i>



<i>They pinpointed</i>
<i>the Perainos' headquarters</i>
<i>in Fort Lauderdale</i>



<i>and placed them</i>
<i>under surveillance.</i>



<i>One day,</i>
<i>I get a telephone call</i>



<i>from a confidential source</i>



who will remain anonymous.



<i>And he says to me, uh:</i>



<i>"We've got so much cash</i>
<i>that we are having trouble</i>



<i>"physically moving about</i>
<i>the office</i>



<i>because the money</i>
<i>is gettin' in the way. "</i>



I said, "How much you got?"
He said, "I don't know.



We don't even
count it anymore."



I said, "You don't count it?"
He said, "No."



I said, "What do you do?"
He said, "We weigh it."



<i>To get around the law</i>



<i>the mob set up</i>
<i>its own distribution system</i>



<i>of checkers and sweepers</i>



<i>who traveled the country</i>
<i>delivering prints</i>



<i>and collecting the money</i>
<i>from theaters.</i>



At a certain time every day,
the checker or the sweeper



would go to the manager
of the particular theater,



<i>and he would say,</i>
<i>"Our take is 50 percent.</i>



<i>"And we want it now, in cash.</i>



Give us the money now,
or else."



<i>I was on my way</i>
<i>down to Nashville.</i>



And the reason
I went to Nashville



was I wanted to buy
these Goo Goo candy bars.



# <i>Goo Goo, chew it,</i>
<i>taste it, sweet milk</i> #



<i>I was gonna buy</i>
<i>a bunch of them</i>



<i>and just, you know,</i>
<i>market them</i>



<i>and see if</i>
<i>I could get it going.</i>



<i>Well, on Saturday night,</i>
<i>I decided I'd just go out.</i>



<i>And I met a couple of guys</i>
<i>from New Jersey.</i>



They were a couple of
Italian guys.



I happen to be a Greek,



so Italians and Greeks
are like cousins.



# <i>I gotta have a Goo Goo,</i>
<i>how 'bout you?</i>
<i>Goo Goo</i> ##



They wanted me
to go to work for 'em



uh, baby-sitting
<i>Deep Throat.</i>



<i>And they sent me over to</i>
<i>the Lamar Theater in Memphis.</i>



<i>And that's where it all began.</i>



<i>And as people walked in,</i>
<i>I would count 'em in.</i>



<i>Then I would go down</i>
<i>through the theater crowd</i>



<i>and I would count the number</i>
<i>of people in the theater</i>
<i>with a little clicker.</i>



<i>You know,</i>
<i>those little things.</i>



A checker. That's what I was.



<i>L... I was just a</i>
<i>simple checker. I had no power</i>



I had no rank, nothing.
I was just an employee.



Nobody was hurt.



And, uh,
the only ones that got hurt



was, uh, one of our checkers
in New Orleans.



Uh, he had $60,000
and he disappeared.



The money disappeared
and they found his body in
the back of a pickup truck.



<i>A theater manager</i>
<i>refused to pay.</i>



<i>And the next thing I know,</i>
<i>I heard</i>
<i>the theater burned down.</i>



<i>I'm not saying</i>
<i>they would do somethin'.</i>



But I did have a Colt.45
with the hammer back



in my belt.



<i>They had people</i>
<i>that... that would do things.</i>



Was it any kind of, uh,
an organized crime?



Well,
is every Italian



A criminal?



Is every Italian a gangster?
I don't think so.



You know, some Italians
have actually opened up
Italian restaurants



And done very well with them.



<i>I've met</i>
<i>some mafia men in my life.</i>



They won't threaten you
in any way.



But if you do
something dishonest,



most of the times,



they don't give you
a second chance.



So why did you walk away
from it yourself?



Because I was told to.



Rather, my wife was told
that I should



leave.



And no money in the worid
is worth



just worrying about something.



That's my wife.



Artie, again?



Now, Terry.



Are you enjoying this?



Damn it.
You're some kind of nut.



Okay. They're finished,
Terry, all right?



<i>Finally, after three years</i>
<i>of FBI investigation,</i>



<i>the government launched one of</i>
<i>the most ambitious</i>
<i>obscenity trials ever mounted.</i>



<i>Designed to nail</i> Deep Throat
<i>and all pornographic films</i>



<i>once and for all.</i>



<i>I think this case was</i>
<i>a case of prosecution</i>



<i>that was directed,</i>
<i>orchestrated,</i>



uh, from Washington, D.C.



<i>All told, 117 people</i>
<i>were charged with conspiracy:</i>



<i>From the distributor</i>
<i>to the projectionist.</i>



<i>And one man,</i>



<i>the government intended to</i>
<i>make an example of.</i>



<i>The director had immunity.</i>



<i>The star had immunity,</i>



<i>but the actor did not.</i>



The theory was,
if you prosecuted the star



then nobody would ever
wanna make a film like this.



And you could drive
the industry out of business.



Harry Reems was paid $250
to appear in <i>Deep Throat.</i>



He had no control,



no say, no input



with what the final version
of this film was gonna be



or whether it was gonna be
distributed interstate,



intrastate, intergalactic.



<i>It's impressive,</i>
<i>for the first time</i>



<i>in the history</i>
<i>of the United States</i>



<i>an artist has ever been</i>
<i>brought to trial</i>
<i>by the government.</i>



<i>All of the trials</i>
<i>have been prosecuted</i>



<i>by a young assistant</i>
<i>US attorney</i>
<i>named Larry Parrish,</i>



<i>a lay Protestant preacher</i>
<i>who has been quoted as saying</i>



<i>he'd rather get smut off</i>
<i>the streets of Memphis</i>
<i>than dope.</i>



Larry Parrish is the...
About one of the finest people



I've ever known
in my entire life.



<i>Fine guy.</i>



<i>And on top of that</i>
<i>he's, uh,</i>
<i>he's movie star quality.</i>



<i>First of all,</i>
<i>he was very tall.</i>



And I hate tall people.



Uh...



But he was also
very arrogant.



If you're gonna dance,
you need to pay the piper.



And, uh, I'm the piper.



You've got to be accountable
under the law.



It was like
when some people know



that they have
the answer to everything



and everybody else
is... is... is... is totally wrong.



It was purely and simply
a matter of law enforcement.



And I guess if there was
any passion in it for me,



it was that, um,



these are laws
that had not been enforced.



And I knew of no reason



why they should
not be enforced.



<i>To make his case,</i>



<i>Larry Parrish invoked</i>
<i>a highly unusual use</i>



<i>of the conspiracy laws.</i>



The government explained
their conspiracy theory



in the terms of a train.



<i>That if the train starts</i>
<i>in Los Ángeles</i>



<i>and you get on in Los Ángeles,</i>



<i>and you ride to Denver</i>
<i>and get off,</i>



<i>but the train continues</i>
<i>on to Memphis,</i>



<i>you are legally responsible</i>
<i>for the entire journey.</i>



And if you're responsible
for everything
that takes place,



you have unlimited liability.



This was a very creative use
of the law of conspiracy



and prosecutors
should never be creative.



That's not their job.



If my mother
had been involved,



she would
have been indicted.



I will promise you that.
Uh, she wasn't.



When you tell artists,
bad artists or good artists,



that they cannot experiment
in certain avenues,



you are taking away
the basic freedoms
of every American.



For some reason, though,



it was as if
he is involved in art.



And so art is protected.



Well, not by the definition
of the Supreme Court.



<i>Maybe I'm disgusting</i>
<i>in some peoples' eyes.</i>



Maybe others are bored by me.



But there are no laws against
acting in these films.



<i>And the actors</i>
<i>and the actresses,</i>



<i>I really hesitate</i>
<i>to call them that.</i>



They are prostitutes
and whoremongers



On the screen.



I'm sorry,
that's just all they are.



And, uh...



Uh, they...



They don't even believe
that there is any law.



How do you communicate
to those persons



that this is against the law?



I face five years in jail.



Do I belong in jail
for five years
for acting in <i>Deep Throat,</i>



which is not
in violation of the law?



<i>If seeing this motion picture</i>



<i>as many times as</i>
<i>Larry Parrish has seen it</i>



<i>has not corrupted him,</i>
<i>or made him into a sex addict,</i>



than I think
that's, uh, proof positive



that these films do not have
a deleterious effect
on the human being.



I'm sitting here right now



trying to draw some images up
from <i>Deep Throat.</i>



To be honest about it, uh,



do I feel that I'm worse off
because of it?



Yes, I do.



Uh, I can't get images
out of my mind



that I have seen.



I have told people
I'm not a eunuch.



I- I'm a regular
red-blooded American male.



And, uh,



and those images
I wish were not there.



<i>We had a lot of eye contact</i>
<i>with the jury.</i>



<i>I think the jury</i>
<i>was very sympathetic</i>
<i>to Harry.</i>



And there was
a palpable change



in the jury's reaction



to Harry
after seeing him in the film.



<i>That was one of the amusing</i>
<i>times in the trial.</i>



He sat over in a, uh,



in a corner by himself,
sort of hoverin'



and wouldn't look at
the jurors,



and they were all
staring at him.



I felt as though
my life was being
taken away from me.



And that I was
being depicted, characterized



as something evil,
a demon.



<i>After a two-month trial,</i>



<i>the jury took just five hours</i>



<i>to return</i>
<i>a unanimously guilty verdict.</i>



The substance of what you say,



in effect,
is you were the little man
who wasn't there.



But the fact
of the matter is,



you deliberately
and knowingly



committed a long series



of immoral, revolting,
obscene acts.



You might have found it
obscene, and immoral,



and distasteful,
and disgusting.



Others don't.



The acts you performed on film
are acts that would be crimes



if they were performed
on the street
or someplace else.



No. They are wonderful
celebrations of life.



They're called sex,
Mr. Cohn.



You just can't cloak yourself
with the American flag



because you don't fit
the image.



You talk as though
the <i>Bill of Rights</i>
was created just for you.



<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in US history,</i>



<i>an actor had been convicted</i>
<i>for merely playing a part.</i>



<i>And Harry Reems</i>
<i>faced five years in jail.</i>



<i>It did not bode well</i>
<i>for the future</i>



of any kind of aesthetic
or artistic expression



in this country,
in any of the arts,



much less this poor guy



<i>who, you know,</i>
<i>suddenly finds himself</i>
<i>being made a scapegoat.</i>



<i>All in the interest of</i>



a basically moral crusade.



<i>What was behind</i>
<i>the case in Memphis</i>



<i>was the religious right.</i>



<i>This is the first</i>
<i>real incarnation</i>



<i>of trying to apply</i>
<i>their conception of morality</i>



to all of America.



<i>In response,</i>



<i>Hollywood was quick</i>
<i>to mobilize and defend</i>
<i>Harry Reems,</i>



<i>positioning itself as</i>
<i>an opposing cultural force.</i>



<i>Professionals in the arts</i>



<i>may not find</i> Deep Throat,
<i>as such,</i>



<i>a piece of art</i>
<i>worth defending.</i>



<i>But they are worried about</i>



<i>the threat of</i>
<i>being arrested later on</i>



<i>for what</i>
<i>they write or act in today.</i>



<i>It's a censorship issue.</i>



<i>My overall concern</i>
<i>is the basic, uh, infringement</i>



<i>on the rights</i>
<i>of the First Amendment.</i>



That's probably why
I came to his defense,



knowing that
Beatty and Nicholson did.



That's how
I make all my decisions.



I said,
"Alan, am... am... am I
gonna be convicted?



"Am I going to do
prison time?"



And his response was:



"If the Republicans
are reelected,



you're going to jail.



If the Democrats are elected,
you're going to be set free."



<i>While Harry fought for</i>
<i>his freedom,</i>



<i>the architect of</i>
<i>the moral crusade</i>
<i>in the first place</i>



<i>was no longer in office</i>
<i>to savor his triumph.</i>



<i>I shall resign the Presidency</i>
<i>effective at noon tomorrow.</i>



<i>And his undoing</i>
<i>had also been Deep Throat,</i>



<i>the nickname for</i>
<i>the secret Watergate source.</i>



<i>There's an expression</i>
<i>in journalism</i>



<i>called "deep background"</i>
<i>which means that</i>



<i>the information cannot be used</i>
<i>in the newspaper</i>



<i>with any kind of</i>
<i>hint of attribution.</i>



<i>Deep Throat,</i> deep background.
You know, it's sort of a...



# <i>But if you want to know</i>
<i>how I really feel</i> #



<i>Its national nightmare over,</i>
<i>the nation got down.</i>



# <i>Get the action goin'</i> #



# <i>How do you like it?</i>
<i>How do you like it?</i> #



The time was right
for a porno star
to be a pop star.



Who would have
ever thought?



# <i>How do you like it?</i> #



<i>More, more, more.</i>



<i>How do you like it,</i>
<i>how do you like it?</i>



# <i>How do you like it?</i> ##



That's it. That's all of it.



It gets repeated
and repeated and repeated.



It means nothing.



# <i>Keep it coming, love</i> #



# <i>Don't stop it now,</i>

# <i>Don't stop it now</i> #



# <i>Keep it coming, love</i> ##



<i>A year ago,</i>



a Memphis federal court
convicted actor Harry Reems



on obscenity charges
in connection with his role



in the film <i>Deep Throat.</i>



Today, a US District Judge
in Memphis overturned
that conviction,



saying that
the actor's activities
took place before



the 1973 Supreme Court
obscenity ruling.



<i>Now that my name</i>
<i>was... was pretty recognizable,</i>



<i>I moved to LA,</i>



thinking that
certainly somebody
would come along and say:



"Well,
there's a sellable name."



<i>Allan Carr had produced</i>
<i>and directed films,</i>



<i>uh, for Paramount.</i>



And he called me one day
and said,



"I'd like you
to play the role



of the high school coach
in the movie <i>Grease. "</i>



<i>I was excited that</i>
<i>I was given an opportunity.</i>



<i>Then about two</i>
<i>or three weeks</i>



<i>before principal</i>
<i>photography began,</i>



<i>Paramount Pictures</i>
<i>removed me from the cast.</i>



<i>That they didn't feel</i>
<i>as though I belonged</i>



<i>in a mainstream</i>
<i>motion picture.</i>



<i>And the lights went on</i>
<i>for me.</i>



I had branded myself



and, uh, given myself
a certain stigma.



<i>I just started</i>
<i>to drink every night,</i>



looking for an escape,



looking for a little bit
of lightheartedness.



And, you know,



it just led me into
a terrible, terrible disease



of alcoholism
and drug addiction.



What are you doin'?



An antidote.
I'm mixing an antidote.



<i>I remember</i>
<i>the last movies I was on,</i>



<i>I couldn't even walk.</i>



<i>I mean, literally,</i>
<i>they had to carry me to a seat</i>



and I'd shoot
the whole motion picture
sitting in a seat,



delivering lines, drunk.



<i>I was so drunk</i>
<i>and so drugged up at the time</i>



<i>that I couldn't do</i>
<i>sex scenes.</i>



Oh, my head.



<i>They'd carry me off the set</i>



and somebody would get me home
and I'd drink some more



and they'd pick me up
and take me back the next day.



It's all a blur.
It's all a blur.



<i>I lost my home.</i>



<i>I lost my career.</i>



<i>I lost my friends,</i>



<i>and ended up, literally,</i>



<i>panhandling in the streets</i>
<i>on Sunset Boulevard.</i>



<i>Harry's personal defeat</i>



<i>in the face of</i>
<i>his First Amendment triumph</i>



<i>reflected the way</i>
<i>society was changing.</i>



<i>Get lost!</i>



<i>Freedom! Freedom!</i>



<i>Culture took</i>
<i>a reactionary turn</i>



<i>after what seemed like</i>
<i>we were on, uh, heading</i>



toward a climax of
the sexual revolution



that we never
actually, uh, attained.



<i>In the 1970s,</i>



the worst censors
in the country



suddenly became the feminists.



<i>The so-called</i>
<i>sexual revolution</i>



<i>in this country</i>
<i>has not been liberating</i>
<i>for women.</i>



<i>It's the way that pornography</i>
<i>invades the popular culture...</i>



<i>It's becoming increasingly</i>
<i>socially acceptable.</i>



<i>The role that</i>
<i>you have selected for women</i>



is degrading to women



because you choose to see
women as sex objects



not as full human beings.



Well, obviously...
Hold on. The day that...



Obviously...
I haven't finished.



The day that you are willing
to come out here



with a cottontail
attached to your rear end...



When the women's movement
began to attack sex in general



and men in general,



I was...



I was at a loss for words



because these were
our partners



in a revolution
to really change



uh, sexual values.



I'm more in sympathy



than perhaps, uh, you know,
the giris realize...



Women.



I'm sorry.



Yes. I'm 35.



Than the ladies realize.



I use "giris" referring to
women of all ages.



You should stop.



If you want to
be called a boy.



I see. Okay. Um...



The idea was
to convince people



that there were good, sound,
feminist, humanitarian reasons



to be against pornography.



<i>Women Against Pornography</i>
<i>found a surprising ally</i>



<i>in America's most famous</i>
<i>porn star: Linda Lovelace,</i>



<i>who had retired</i>
<i>from the spotlight</i>



<i>and was now</i>
<i>a mother and housewife.</i>



<i>Linda Lovelace is, uh, here.</i>



The book is titled,
uh, <i>Ordeal.</i>



And I'll tell you,
this book is a very, uh,



explicit recounting
of what happened to you.



I felt it was important to let



everything out
that happened to me.



I literally became a prisoner
of Mr. Traynor's.



<i>I wasn't permitted to go to</i>
<i>the bathroom by myself.</i>



<i>I was never allowed</i>
<i>out of his eyesight.</i>



<i>If he took a shower,</i>
<i>I had to take a shower</i>
<i>with him.</i>



If I did have
any kind of communication
with my friends or my family,



he was on the extension
with a.45



or an M-16
semi-automatic machine gun
pointed at me.



And there are those who say
you can see the bruises
on her in the film.



You tell me if the bruises
are visible in the film.



How did Linda Lovelace and
Gloria Steinem join forces?



How did the two of you
get together?



I saw Linda
on the <i>Phil Donahue Show.</i>



And she was
being questioned by Phil,



who I think is usually
a more sensitive questioner



than he was this time,



uh, and by the audience,
with enormous disbelief.



And I still find it
very hard to believe



that you have become
a changed person.



I had always heard
that to be hypnotized,
you had to be willing.



Is there something about
the way you were raised,
in your view,



that made you
vulnerable to this?



And yet
she was still being asked,



uh, what in her background



had led her to become
essentially a hostage.



What did lead you
to become a hostage,



if we can... if we can now
ask the question?



Does it go back beyond that
to your childhood,



that you were
a susceptible person?



No.



See now what you're doing,
you're doing what... what
made me so angry.



You know,
because we don't say
to the hostages in Iran:



"What in your... what in
your background led you



to... to be in that embassy?"
Yeah.



The situations are not
nearly comparable.



They are. It's force.



<i>Linda needed somebody</i>
<i>to tell her what to do.</i>



And as long as
she had somebody
telling her what to do,



she... she was happy.



So when she
made the movie,



she was happy
making the movie.



After the movie,
somebody said,



"Hey, you shouldn't have
made that movie."



So she became unhappy
about making the movie,



which wasn't true.



She was very happy
about making the movie.



<i>Linda's new fame as</i>
<i>a crusader against pornography</i>



<i>culminated with her testimony</i>
<i>before the Meese Commission</i>
<i>in 1986.</i>



<i>My ordeal still goes on.</i>



The film <i>Deep Throat</i>
still shows



and virtually every time
someone watches that movie,



they're watching me
being raped.



<i>Once again,</i>
<i>the government had set out</i>



<i>to determine</i>
<i>the effect of pornography.</i>



<i>This time,</i>
<i>instead of relying on</i>
<i>scientific data,</i>



<i>they relied on</i>
<i>personal testimony</i>



<i>to prove that pornography</i>
<i>was a social evil.</i>



Well, the other day
my 8-year-old son said to me:



"Mommy,
if this country is so great,



how come people
are still hurting you?"



<i>It's sort of like</i>
<i>the</i> Oprah Show.



It's, um, much more anecdotal.
Much less professional.



<i>So what Nixon starts</i>
<i>in the '60s and '70s</i>



<i>by stacking the court,</i>



<i>Reagan finishes</i>
<i>with the Meese report.</i>



<i>In its most controversial</i>
<i>finding,</i>



<i>the commission concludes</i>



<i>there is a relationship</i>
<i>between violence</i>
<i>and pornography.</i>



<i>The commission conducted</i>
<i>no scientific studies.</i>



<i>Finally,</i>
<i>after decades of struggle,</i>



<i>politics triumphed over</i>
<i>pornography.</i>



<i>But the victory was hollow.</i>



<i>The success of</i> Deep Throat



<i>created enormous demand</i>
<i>for hardcore,</i>



<i>that new technology</i>
<i>could now satisfy</i>



<i>and avoid all regulation.</i>



The phenomenal sales of
home videocassette machines



have opened up a new market
for erotic films.



<i>It's a market</i>
<i>that barely existed</i>
<i>a couple of years ago.</i>



But today,
30 to 50 percent of the tapes



available for play
in these machines



are hardcore pornography.



Gerry Damiano,
I think, really thought



that porn was going to
merge into, kind of,
Hollywood films.



<i>That porn movies</i>



<i>were gonna just get</i>
<i>bigger and bigger budgets</i>



and become more like
feature films
with hardcore sex.



Looked like it was going to
burst itself into something,
into an art form.



That didn't happen.



In fact,
just the opposite happened.



Instead, it dwindled in-into
a mediocre commodity.



<i>With the advent of</i>
<i>the video camera,</i>



<i>it got to be so easy</i>
<i>to... to shoot X-rated video</i>



that ev-everybody could do it.



And then, the only ones
that did it



were the ones that could do it
cheaper and cheaper,



for less and less
and less money.



<i>They were...</i>
<i>they were nothing.</i>



<i>It was just</i>
<i>one sex scene after another.</i>



<i>And it... it sort of</i>
<i>killed itself.</i>



<i>I couldn't make</i>
<i>that kind of film.</i>



Because there was...
there was no reason to.



<i>It became a...</i>
<i>it became a factory.</i>



<i>It was over.</i>



<i>You didn't need</i>
<i>filmmakers anymore.</i>



<i>As the adult industry grew,</i>



<i>it neither needed</i>
<i>the rebel filmmaker</i>



<i>who had pioneered it</i>



<i>nor heeded</i>
<i>the feminist protest</i>
<i>against it.</i>



<i>So finding herself redundant,</i>



<i>Linda Lovelace</i>
<i>moved with her family</i>
<i>to Denver</i>



<i>to try and start a new life.</i>



Um, that's Mom at her desk.



Uh, she was the manager
of the mailroom.



She was proud of her new desk.



Um...



They fired her
when they found out about LL.



<i>It happened a lot.</i>



<i>You know, I've lost two jobs</i>



<i>because of the name</i>
<i>Linda Lovelace.</i>



<i>And, uh,</i>
<i>that-that's kind of...</i>



<i>That hurts.</i>



<i>You know,</i>
<i>I was always defending myself</i>



<i>after, what, 25 years.</i>



<i>I don't have to do that</i>
<i>too much anymore.</i>



So I've decided
it's time for me
to do what I can



to earn an income



from, uh, the abuse that
I went through from the name.



<i>Broke and out of work,</i>



<i>Linda returned to the worid</i>
<i>she had once condemned.</i>



<i>You know, I think it's kind of</i>
<i>nice looking sexy</i>



and... and still
looking attractive at 51.



So, I didn't feel
there was anything wrong
with doing it.



<i>Many feminists</i>
<i>who have written,</i>



<i>you know, books...</i>



<i>And they're always using</i>
<i>the name Linda Lovelace,</i>
<i>and what happened to me.</i>



I don't get
any royalties from that.



And it doesn't take much
to keep me happy.



You know?
I get to be with
my grandchildren,



around my children,
and that's my joy.



She died penniless.
Didn't have a dime.



Didn't have a dime.



And they all got rich.



They all got
their hands in the pocket.



<i>Fuck me harder,</i>
<i>harder, harder.</i>



<i>Sex is a force,</i>
<i>it's a force like lava.</i>



And there haven't been
too many successful
engineering projects



about diverting
the flow of lava.



Did I ever see
the movie <i>Deep Throat?</i>
No.



Should I?



No. That's with, um,
that lady who died.



What's her name?



No, I have not seen it.



<i>Deep Throat</i> forged
the sexual revolution



<i>for good or bad.</i>



<i>It led to the porno business.</i>



<i>Linda Lovelace turned it,</i>
<i>and</i> Deep Throat <i>turned it,</i>
<i>into an industry.</i>



And like it or hate it,



that's what she's gonna be
remembered for, forever.



<i>Porn really does have</i>
<i>a yucky feel to it today.</i>



<i>Part of it, I think,</i>
<i>that was lost is this,</i>
<i>a certain innocence.</i>



For that brief moment,
porn was part of



discovery, curiosity,



change.



Today it's different.



<i>What happened</i>



<i>was that a very cynical</i>
<i>pornography industry</i>



came in on the heels
of the First Amendment



and began coining money
hand over fist.



<i>So, it changed the nature</i>
<i>of... of pornographic sex,</i>



<i>from art to money.</i>



<i>Money is not interested in</i>
<i>the little alleys</i>



of endeavor...
of artistic endeavor.



<i>It wants the main highway.</i>



<i>It's a really dramatic fact</i>



<i>that we have gone</i>
<i>from people staring up</i>
<i>at a marquee</i>



<i>and thinking</i>
<i>"What can deep throat mean?</i>



<i>Surely not</i>
<i>what I'm thinking"</i>



to kids who don't
consider it sex.



<i>They perverted it</i>
<i>instead of improving it.</i>



<i>They took a beautiful thing</i>
<i>that God gave mankind,</i>



and they perverted it.
And the results are obvious.



All you have to do
is look around.



Deep Throat's
<i>legacy goes beyond</i>



<i>the sexually saturated culture</i>
<i>that surrounds us today</i>



<i>and reaches back to</i>
<i>the beginnings</i>
<i>of a culture war</i>



<i>that divides us</i>
<i>as never before.</i>



Deep Throat <i>was less about</i>
<i>the joys of oral sex</i>



<i>than it was about the freedom</i>
<i>to speak out against shame</i>



<i>and hypocrisy.</i>



<i>The FCC has fined</i>
<i>169 stations to pay...</i>



<i>Congress is also</i>
<i>cracking down...</i>



<i>Three Supreme Court justices</i>



<i>are expected to retire</i>
<i>over the next four years.</i>



<i>Each of these 169...</i>



<i>Today, there are people</i>
<i>in the Department of Justice</i>



<i>in high places,</i>
<i>sympathetic with</i>
<i>obscenity laws.</i>



I think today



the climate is
even more ripe



for vigorous enforcement
of obscenity laws.



<i>Now if we could get</i>
<i>these terrorists to go away</i>



<i>And quit taking up</i>
<i>so much time of the,</i>



<i>uh, of</i>
<i>the Department of Justice...</i>



All right?



Thank you.



You're welcome.
