1
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,690
San Francisco, California

2
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,887
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

3
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,677
- Is that what I think it is?
- I think so.

4
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:12,887
- You nervous?
- As long as they spelled my name right.

5
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:28,507
- You want a moment alone with it?
- I want you right here with me.

6
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,557
There it is.

7
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:36,387
There it is.

8
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:42,887
Your baby.

9
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,837
I'll get it.

10
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:00,967
Hello?

11
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,507
Hello?

12
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:06,727
Amirjan.

13
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:09,387
Rahim Khan?

14
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:13,387
It is kind of you to remember.

15
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:21,647
I have missed you, Amir jan.

16
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,677
It's good to hear your voice.

17
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,097
You should come home.

18
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:29,217
Home?

19
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:34,477
I don't know if now's such a good time.

20
00:04:35,227 --> 00:04:38,887
It's a very bad time,
but you should come.

21
00:04:39,517 --> 00:04:42,307
There is a way to be good again, Amir.

22
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:55,887
Kabul, Afghanistan

23
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,557
Take the spool. Hold it right.

24
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:21,547
Give me string!

25
00:05:22,517 --> 00:05:24,057
Hold the spool right.

26
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:35,307
- I cut him!
- Victory!

27
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,307
Victory!

28
00:05:39,977 --> 00:05:41,007
This way!

29
00:05:41,557 --> 00:05:42,757
Where are you going?

30
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:46,017
Catch it, it's going this way!

31
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,057
We're losing it!

32
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,307
Trust me!

33
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,517
What are you doing here?

34
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,267
Come sit, Amir.

35
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,717
You're wasting time here.

36
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,227
The kite went the other way.

37
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,017
It will come this way.

38
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,597
- How do you know?
- I know.

39
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:48,837
But how?

40
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:51,007
Have I ever lied to you?

41
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:53,347
How should I know?

42
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:56,257
I'd rather eat dirt.

43
00:06:57,187 --> 00:06:58,847
Would you really do that?

44
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:01,717
- Do what?
- Eat dirt if I told you to.

45
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,007
If you asked, I would.

46
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,227
But would you really ask me to do
such a thing?

47
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,057
Are you crazy?

48
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:13,597
You know I wouldn't.

49
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:15,767
I know.

50
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:36,057
Thank you, Agha sahib.

51
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:42,927
I want them
to start building tomorrow.

52
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:45,097
This should have happened a
long time ago.

53
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:49,017
Absolutely, Sahib!
And thank you.

54
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:52,507
The orphans of Kabul
will never forget you.

55
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:56,767
Somehow

56
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,097
I suspect they will.

57
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:03,387
You know

58
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:08,177
the bureaucrats
will steal half the money.

59
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,017
Only half?

60
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,757
They've gotten lazy.

61
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:19,587
Hey, Mister Jaylawni

62
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,007
Conjure up the winds for me

63
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,597
You could have beaten him.

64
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,767
Me? Weren't you
watching Omar back there?

65
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:29,177
He never loses.

66
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:33,307
If you have the right kite,
you'll win the tournament this year.

67
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,347
With the victory of Saur Revolution

68
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:41,097
for the first time
in the history of this country

69
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,337
the political sovereignty
and political power have been bestowed

70
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:49,677
upon the Democratic Party
of the People of Afghanistan.

71
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:54,887
This will get bloody
before it gets better.

72
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:57,087
Usually a safe bet.

73
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:03,007
They say the Communists are
starting brawls at the university.

74
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:07,597
A student was stabbed last week.

75
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:12,097
I'm glad Amir's too young
to be involved in all this.

76
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:14,137
Amir?

77
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:19,187
Trust me, he won't be
getting into any brawls.

78
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,677
Sometimes I see him playing on the
street with the neighbourhood boys.

79
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:29,847
They push him around,
take his toys from him,

80
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:31,267
but Amir,

81
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:34,187
he never fights back. Never.

82
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,227
So he's not violent.

83
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:39,087
You know what happens
when the other kids tease him?

84
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,677
Hassan steps in and fends them off.

85
00:09:43,107 --> 00:09:45,557
And when they come home,
I say to him,

86
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:47,727
"How did Hassan
get that scrape on his face?"

87
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,387
He says, "He fell down."

88
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:53,387
There's something missing in that boy.

89
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:56,387
My friend,

90
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,687
children aren't colouring books.

91
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:03,007
You don't get to fill them
with your favourite colours.

92
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:07,347
He's not like you.
He'll never be like you.

93
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:10,557
But watch. He'll turn out well.

94
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,007
A boy who won't stand up for himself,

95
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:17,057
becomes a man who
won't stand up for anything.

96
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,137
Amir jan,

97
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:38,847
may I come in?

98
00:10:43,437 --> 00:10:45,967
I wanted to say goodbye.

99
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,187
I'm going to Pakistan tomorrow.

100
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:53,967
That's a fine kite.

101
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,677
Hassan ran it down.

102
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,677
The boy's got a gift.

103
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,937
What are you working on?

104
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:07,517
A story.

105
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:08,887
May I read it?

106
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:11,347
It's not very good.

107
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:16,177
All the same, I'd love to read it.

108
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:21,177
Thank you, Amir jan.

109
00:11:21,687 --> 00:11:23,307
I'll read it tonight.

110
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:26,517
He hates me

111
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,217
because I killed her.

112
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,137
My mother.

113
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,097
Amir,

114
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,807
don't ever say such a thing.

115
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,427
Don't ever think it.

116
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,137
But it's true.

117
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:45,977
No, Amir jan.

118
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,717
It's a dangerous thing, being born.

119
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,227
Dangerous for the mother,

120
00:12:01,147 --> 00:12:03,637
dangerous for the child.

121
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:08,347
Your father would die for you.

122
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,937
You know that,

123
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,677
don't you?

124
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,217
Amir jan.

125
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:27,427
- Come on, do it.
- It's wrong, Amir agha.

126
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:31,797
Do you have to be
so holy all the time?

127
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,017
Just one?

128
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:35,807
Just one.

129
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,307
You'd think one day he'd wise up.

130
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:57,647
You got your allowance?

131
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,137
Yeah, how about we see
The Magnificent Seven again?

132
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,847
We deal in lead, friend!

133
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,547
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.

134
00:13:12,687 --> 00:13:15,387
No. I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire.

135
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:17,427
There's a job for six men

136
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:20,087
watching over a village
just south of the border.

137
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:22,887
How big's the opposition?

138
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:25,597
Thirty guns.

139
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:29,347
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

140
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:32,007
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

141
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:36,477
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds
in the Travis County War.

142
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,597
- Who's your favourite?
- Steve McQueen.

143
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,887
I like Charles Bronson.
Maybe someday we'll go to Iran.

144
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:51,137
Why?

145
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,847
Maybe we'd see him somewhere.

146
00:13:52,937 --> 00:13:54,177
I could get his autograph.

147
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,557
- Charles Bronson's not Iranian.
- He's not?

148
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:59,347
So why does he speak Farsi
with an Iranian accent?

149
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,847
Where are you going, faggots?

150
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:06,097
What do you boys think:

151
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:08,887
If I paid you to be my friends,

152
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:12,467
would you really be my friends?
Or would you be my servants?

153
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,977
Gee, Assef,
if you were paying us,

154
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,227
that would make us your servants!

155
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:20,047
So I guess Amir has no friends.

156
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,597
We're not bothering you.

157
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:23,847
Wrong.

158
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:25,547
You are bothering me.

159
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:28,547
Afghanistan is the land of the Pashtuns.

160
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:30,137
We're the real Afghans.

161
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,227
Not this flat-nose Hazara.

162
00:14:32,397 --> 00:14:35,847
His people pollute our homeland.
They dirty our blood.

163
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:38,547
If idiots like you and your father

164
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:42,717
didn't take these people in,
we'd be rid of them.

165
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,387
Please leave us alone, Agha.

166
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:51,007
Put it down, you motherless Hazara.

167
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,797
Leave us in peace.

168
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:55,977
Maybe you didn't notice,

169
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:58,307
but there are three of us,
and two of you.

170
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:02,217
And maybe you didn't notice
that I'm the one holding the slingshot.

171
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:08,637
Forget it.

172
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,047
We'll deal with these faggots later.

173
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:22,137
- What's this?
- Rahim Khan left it for you.

174
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:29,017
He liked it.

175
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,387
Liked what?

176
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,137
My story!

177
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:37,187
Well of course he liked it.
You tell great stories.

178
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,507
"Bravo," he wrote. Bravo!

179
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,177
Bravo?

180
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,717
Do you know what "bravo" means?

181
00:15:44,437 --> 00:15:46,557
It's Italian for genius.

182
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:48,887
What's the story about?

183
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:52,557
It's about a man
who finds a magic cup.

184
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:55,217
And he learns that
if he weeps into the cup,

185
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:57,017
his tears turn to pearls.

186
00:15:57,397 --> 00:15:59,677
He's very poor, you know?

187
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:02,557
And, at the end of the story,
he's sitting on a mountain of pearls

188
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:06,217
with a bloody knife in his hand
and his dead wife in his arms.

189
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,387
- So he killed her?
- Yes, Hassan.

190
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:14,217
So that he'd cry and get rich.

191
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,887
Yes, you're very quick.

192
00:16:18,647 --> 00:16:19,757
What?

193
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:21,887
Nothing, Amir agha.
Are you done with breakfast?

194
00:16:22,307 --> 00:16:23,557
What?

195
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:27,717
Well, will you permit me
to ask a question about the story?

196
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,387
Of course.

197
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,387
Why did the man have to kill his wife?

198
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:36,467
Because each of his tears
becomes a pearl.

199
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:40,887
Yes, but why couldn't he
just smell an onion?

200
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,977
The mullahs at school
say drinking is a sin.

201
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,607
They say drinkers will pay
when the Reckoning comes.

202
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:06,557
Do you want to know
what your father thinks about sin?

203
00:17:06,977 --> 00:17:08,057
Yes.

204
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:09,897
Then I'll tell you.

205
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:14,057
But first understand this
and understand it now:

206
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:16,387
You'll never learn anything of value
from those bearded idiots.

207
00:17:17,477 --> 00:17:19,057
You mean the mullahs?

208
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:21,717
I piss on the beards of those
self-righteous monkeys.

209
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:25,387
They do nothing but thumb their prayer
beads and recite a book

210
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,757
written in a tongue
they don't even understand.

211
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:32,057
There is only one sin.
And that is theft.

212
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:35,347
Every other sin is a variation of theft.
Do you understand that?

213
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,227
No, Baba jan.

214
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,977
When you kill a man,

215
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,547
you steal a life.

216
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:47,807
You steal his wife's right
to her husband,

217
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:50,647
his children's right to a father.

218
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:55,187
When you tell a lie,
you steal someone's right to the truth.

219
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,887
There is no act
more wretched than stealing.

220
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:01,927
Do you see?

221
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:05,687
Yes, Baba.

222
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:08,807
Good.

223
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:11,557
All this talk of sinning
is making me thirsty.

224
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,057
Hassan! Hassan!

225
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:23,557
Go, he's calling you.

226
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,727
Happy Birthday.

227
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:34,047
It's made in America.

228
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,387
I figured, if you're
going to be my bodyguard,

229
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:38,967
you need a proper weapon.

230
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:41,397
Thank you, Amir agha.

231
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,347
Come on, let's go.

232
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:09,427
What does it say?

233
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,087
Amir and Hassan,
the Sultans of Kabul.

234
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,597
The Sultans of Kabul!

235
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:17,927
You want a story?

236
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:20,097
Rostam and Sohrab.

237
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:24,177
Not them again.
I've read you that one fifty times.

238
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:26,267
How about Rudabeh?

239
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:29,217
It's your book, Amir agha.

240
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:32,727
All right,

241
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:36,557
Rostam and Sohrab.
It's your birthday.

242
00:20:05,937 --> 00:20:08,097
Your dad got a new car?

243
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:10,887
Isn't that the car they drive in Bullitt?

244
00:20:13,477 --> 00:20:14,587
Steve McQueen!

245
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:20,307
I heard it was someone's birthday.

246
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:23,427
It's your day, Hassan.
Why don't you sit up front?

247
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,427
Are you ready for your birthday present?

248
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:29,597
- Is it a drawing book?
- Better!

249
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,637
- A toy gun?
- Better!

250
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,057
Uncle Saifo!

251
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:13,427
My brother!
It's been too long.

252
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:15,597
Everyone good?

253
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:20,427
It's his birthday, he can have any
kite he wants.

254
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:24,097
Here they are.

255
00:21:24,437 --> 00:21:27,307
Take your pick.

256
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:44,147
I want that one.

257
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:46,387
We'll take it.

258
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,427
A good choice.

259
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:51,437
I was just lucky that time.

260
00:21:51,607 --> 00:21:54,717
It wasn't luck, Amir agha.
You're better than him.

261
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:01,797
I know you're going to win.

262
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:05,557
You have too much faith in me.

263
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,887
Ali made the cauliflower
especially for you.

264
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:11,097
Yes. Every time I come,
he makes the cauliflower.

265
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,637
I know. You come here too often.

266
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:17,597
The tournament's tomorrow?

267
00:22:17,977 --> 00:22:19,847
Are you and Hassan ready?

268
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,677
We've been practising.

269
00:22:22,147 --> 00:22:25,757
Did I ever tell you
about the year I won?

270
00:22:25,937 --> 00:22:30,057
I'm fairly sure you told everyone
in Kabul about the year you won.

271
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,097
Fourteen kites I cut down.

272
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:35,597
I think that's still a record.

273
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:37,927
Yes, yes, yes. Eat.

274
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:24,227
I think you're going to make
Agha sahib very proud today.

275
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:25,817
You think so?

276
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:26,977
Inshallah.

277
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,227
Inshallah.

278
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:53,737
It's really crowded.

279
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:57,857
I'm not sure it's
the best day to fly a kite.

280
00:23:57,947 --> 00:23:59,187
Why?

281
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:01,687
It's a beautiful day.

282
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:05,267
It's the two of us
against all of Kabul.

283
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:09,527
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.

284
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,777
Let's fly.

285
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:23,267
Put down the spool.

286
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:25,357
Take it!

287
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,647
Take it from under.

288
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:23,187
Okay, I'm under.

289
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:43,267
We cut him! We cut him!

290
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,227
Amir agha!

291
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:17,357
Go a little to your right.

292
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:42,897
We cut him! We cut him!

293
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,727
They could break your record.

294
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,227
Let's see.

295
00:26:55,817 --> 00:26:58,107
Hold the spool right.

296
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:05,477
Take him, Omar!

297
00:27:07,157 --> 00:27:10,647
Omar! Omar! Omar!

298
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,817
Omar!

299
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:34,357
I cut him!

300
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,157
Victory! Victory!

301
00:27:42,857 --> 00:27:46,057
- How many has he cut?
- I've counted twelve.

302
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,267
I think he wants Baba's record.

303
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,897
We can't let that happen.

304
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:01,777
Last one, Omar agha.

305
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:22,687
Pull your string forward.

306
00:28:23,657 --> 00:28:24,767
Cut him!

307
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:39,057
It's just the two of them now.

308
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:52,857
Bravo, Amir agha!

309
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:54,137
You cut him!

310
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:57,397
We won! We won!

311
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:09,057
Amir, I'm going to run
that blue kite for you.

312
00:29:09,317 --> 00:29:11,307
Hassan! Come back with it!

313
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,057
For you, a thousand times over!

314
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:33,847
What am I supposed to do with this?
You're the reason I got cut!

315
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:02,237
Have you seen
a Hazara boy come this way?

316
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:03,857
Wearing a red chapan.

317
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:07,897
I saw a boy running that way.
He had a kite in his hand.

318
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,527
- They've probably caught him by now.
- Who?

319
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:15,437
The big boys chasing him.

320
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:40,987
Where's your slingshot, Hazara?

321
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,687
You don't look so brave today.

322
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,937
But I'm in a mood to forgive.
What do you say to that, boys?

323
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:52,317
Very generous.

324
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:54,887
Especially after the
rude manners he showed last time.

325
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:57,897
Forgiven. It's done.

326
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:04,017
Of course, nothing is free in this world.

327
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:05,857
My pardon comes with a small price.

328
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:07,947
Nothing is free.

329
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,227
You're a lucky Hazara.

330
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:14,027
Because, today, it's only
going to cost you that kite.

331
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:17,317
Fair deal.

332
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:21,647
- What do you think, boys?
- More than fair.

333
00:31:23,027 --> 00:31:27,067
Amir agha won the tournament
and I ran this kite for him.

334
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:29,567
This is his.

335
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:31,817
Loyal Hazara.

336
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,397
Loyal dog.

337
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:38,607
Before you sacrifice yourself for him,
think about this, Hazara:

338
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,397
Would he do the same for you?

339
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,897
Have you ever wondered why

340
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,227
he only plays with you
when no one else is around?

341
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,067
I said, "Why," Hazara!

342
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:53,347
Because, to him,
you're nothing but an ugly pet.

343
00:31:53,817 --> 00:31:55,937
Something he can play with
when he's bored.

344
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:58,347
Something he can kick
when he's angry.

345
00:31:58,607 --> 00:32:00,267
Amir agha and I are friends.

346
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:01,387
Friends?

347
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,567
You fool. Enough of this.

348
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:03,817
Give us the kite.

349
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:07,267
Last chance.

350
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:11,057
As you wish.

351
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:13,687
Keep it.

352
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:18,357
So it will always remind you
of what I'm about to do to you.

353
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:19,557
Nothing is free.

354
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,897
He's just a servant's son.

355
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:37,687
I'm not sure, Assef.
My father says it's wrong.

356
00:32:37,987 --> 00:32:39,397
Your father's a Communist.

357
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:43,567
And there's nothing wrong
about teaching this donkey a lesson.

358
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:46,557
Just hold him down.

359
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:14,727
Let's get out of here.

360
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:53,767
Where were you?
I was looking for you.

361
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,357
Let's go, Agha sahib will worry.

362
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:14,027
Good job.

363
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:17,777
Come here.

364
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:29,357
Well done.

365
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:56,687
Where's Hassan?

366
00:34:56,777 --> 00:34:57,857
He went back to sleep.

367
00:34:58,157 --> 00:35:01,437
The last few weeks,
all he wants to do is sleep.

368
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:03,517
After chores he just
crawls under his blanket.

369
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:06,647
Can I ask you something?

370
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,857
Did something happen, Amir agha?

371
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:13,307
Something he's not telling me?

372
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,557
How should I know?
Maybe he's sick.

373
00:35:17,107 --> 00:35:19,097
People get sick, you know.

374
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:36,057
The mullahs want to rule our souls

375
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:40,107
and the Communists
tell us we don't have any.

376
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:44,307
More importantly, El Cid is playing.
We could go tomorrow.

377
00:35:44,407 --> 00:35:47,107
Tell Hassan to come with us?

378
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:49,777
He's not feeling well.

379
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,647
Really? What's wrong with him?

380
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:54,857
He's got a cold or something.

381
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,937
Ali says he's sleeping it off.

382
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:00,437
I haven't seen you two
playing together in weeks.

383
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:01,937
What happened?

384
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:06,187
Nothing. He's just been a little sick.

385
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,147
Hassan never gets sick.

386
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:10,907
Whatever's going on, you should
deal with it before too long.

387
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,237
Take care not to
let these things fester.

388
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:15,807
Time will only make it worse.

389
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,317
What are you reading?

390
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:41,687
It's for little kids.
I just... I'm trying to learn.

391
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:46,687
I'd rather hear one of your stories.

392
00:36:47,697 --> 00:36:49,267
I'm done making up stories.

393
00:36:49,737 --> 00:36:50,817
Why?

394
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,107
Because they're stupid.

395
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:57,067
I don't think they're stupid.
I love your stories.

396
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,727
What would you do
if I hit you with this?

397
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:06,727
What would you do?

398
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:09,697
Hit me back!

399
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:12,647
Hit me back!

400
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:14,517
Hit me back!

401
00:37:15,237 --> 00:37:16,477
Hit me back.

402
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:23,477
You're a coward.

403
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:46,397
Blood's good for the trees.

404
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:49,267
Come on, birthday boy.
Let's go inside.

405
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:52,807
Ali, is everything ready?

406
00:37:52,907 --> 00:37:55,817
Don't worry, it will be soon.

407
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:01,267
- Move it back a little.
- Yes, of course.

408
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:14,857
Have you ever thought
about getting new servants?

409
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:23,557
Why would I want to do that?

410
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:27,517
I guess you wouldn't.
It was just a question.

411
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:30,027
I grew up with Ali.

412
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:34,237
My father took him in,
loved him like his own son.

413
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:38,527
Forty years he's been with my family.
Forty goddamn years.

414
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:43,517
And you think I'm just
going to throw him out?

415
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,437
I've never laid a hand on you,

416
00:38:48,697 --> 00:38:51,397
but you ever say that again...

417
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:55,027
You bring me shame.

418
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:57,317
And, Hassan...

419
00:38:58,357 --> 00:39:00,437
Hassan's not going anywhere.

420
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:01,767
Do you understand?

421
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:07,187
I said, do you understand?

422
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:09,607
Yes, Baba.

423
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:15,887
You bring me shame.

424
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:05,687
Massoud jan, how are you?

425
00:40:05,777 --> 00:40:07,567
- Welcome.
- Happy birthday.

426
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:12,637
Welcome.

427
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:15,897
Hello, Amir jan. Happy birthday.

428
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:17,857
Hello, Amir jan. How are you?

429
00:40:22,777 --> 00:40:25,897
It is modest and not worthy of you.

430
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:27,807
Happy birthday.

431
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:32,357
Hassan said your copy was
getting old, missing some pages.

432
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,767
Thank you.

433
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:36,567
Amir.

434
00:40:36,657 --> 00:40:38,557
Happy birthday, Amir jan.

435
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:43,567
Happy birthday.

436
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:47,567
- What a splendid suit.
- Great party, Amir.

437
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:52,027
Aren't you going
to thank Assef?

438
00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:55,057
Thank you.

439
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:01,607
Please, enjoy.

440
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,687
Amir jan.

441
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:21,187
Shouldn't you be
entertaining your guests?

442
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,477
I didn't know you drank.

443
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,517
Turns out I do.

444
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,307
But only on the most
important occasions.

445
00:41:37,237 --> 00:41:43,347
You know you can tell me
anything you want. Anytime.

446
00:41:44,277 --> 00:41:45,897
I know.

447
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:50,857
Here, I almost forgot.

448
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:54,937
For your stories.

449
00:42:04,697 --> 00:42:07,777
Come. You're missing your party.

450
00:43:09,857 --> 00:43:10,967
Baba.

451
00:43:11,987 --> 00:43:13,607
Have you seen my watch anywhere?

452
00:43:14,107 --> 00:43:15,847
The one I just bought you?

453
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:17,807
Don't tell me you already lost it.

454
00:43:18,437 --> 00:43:21,437
No. I know I had it in my room.

455
00:43:21,937 --> 00:43:23,767
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.

456
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:08,597
What's wrong?

457
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:13,637
Ali.

458
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,767
When you finish your work,
come inside with Hassan.

459
00:44:15,857 --> 00:44:17,437
Yes, Agha sahib.

460
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:27,767
Did you steal Amir's watch, Hassan?

461
00:44:34,567 --> 00:44:36,227
Yes.

462
00:44:41,277 --> 00:44:42,597
I forgive you.

463
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:46,847
We're leaving, Agha sahib.

464
00:44:47,357 --> 00:44:48,517
What?

465
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:51,017
We can't live here any more.

466
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:54,267
But I forgive him.
Didn't you hear me, Ali?

467
00:44:55,937 --> 00:44:58,557
Life here is impossible
for us now, Agha sahib.

468
00:44:58,687 --> 00:44:59,937
We're leaving.

469
00:45:00,027 --> 00:45:01,597
I don't care about the watch.

470
00:45:01,687 --> 00:45:03,647
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

471
00:45:03,897 --> 00:45:07,347
I'm sorry, Agha sahib,
but our bags are already packed.

472
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:09,927
We've made our decision.

473
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:11,347
Ali.

474
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:13,097
Haven't I provided for you?

475
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:14,897
Haven't I been good
to you and Hassan?

476
00:45:15,317 --> 00:45:17,267
At least tell me why.

477
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:19,147
I forbid you to do this!

478
00:45:19,777 --> 00:45:20,857
Do you hear me?

479
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:23,097
I forbid you!

480
00:45:25,937 --> 00:45:30,647
Respectfully, you can't
forbid me anything, Agha sahib.

481
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:34,267
We don't work for you any more.

482
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:12,937
Soviet Invasion
December 1979

483
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:18,267
Pack a bag.
Only what you need.

484
00:46:18,357 --> 00:46:19,387
Hurry up!

485
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:24,607
- They'll come for me.
- We don't know that.

486
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:28,357
Read your history, my friend. By the
time we know it, it will be too late.

487
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:35,517
You know how I am.
You know how I talk.

488
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:38,597
Everyone in Kabul has
heard me cursing the Communists.

489
00:46:40,987 --> 00:46:44,847
Will you watch over the house for me?
We'll be back when the Russians leave.

490
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:47,187
What if they don't leave?

491
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:51,057
Everyone leaves.
This country is not kind to invaders.

492
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:55,937
And you, my friend?

493
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:57,767
Where will you go?

494
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,637
Pakistan, first.

495
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:02,777
After that, wherever
is safest for the boy.

496
00:47:03,107 --> 00:47:05,317
The smugglers want
five thousand a head

497
00:47:05,647 --> 00:47:07,937
for safe passage to Pakistan.

498
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:10,897
I'm fairly sure they won't take cheques.

499
00:47:12,027 --> 00:47:14,267
What about a Mustang?

500
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:30,517
He wants a half hour with
the lady in the back of the truck.

501
00:48:31,897 --> 00:48:32,927
What?

502
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:34,517
No.

503
00:48:35,397 --> 00:48:36,647
Brother.

504
00:48:37,107 --> 00:48:39,017
Please ask mister soldier sahib
to show a little mercy.

505
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:41,557
Maybe he has a wife, too.

506
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:44,267
It's his price for letting us pass.

507
00:48:46,397 --> 00:48:48,517
I want you to ask
this man something.

508
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:51,017
Ask him where his shame is.

509
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,937
He says,
there is no shame in war.

510
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:08,397
Tell him he is wrong.
War doesn't negate decency.

511
00:49:13,027 --> 00:49:14,057
What did he say?

512
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:16,437
He says he'd enjoy
putting a bullet in you,

513
00:49:16,527 --> 00:49:18,647
almost as much as he'd enjoy her.

514
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:22,607
I'll take a thousand of his bullets
before I let this indecency take place.

515
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,807
- Baba, please, he'll shoot you.
- Have I taught you nothing?

516
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:29,527
Tell him he'd better
kill me good with the first shot.

517
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:30,967
Because if I don't go down,

518
00:49:31,277 --> 00:49:33,267
I'm tearing him to pieces,
goddamn his father!

519
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:21,927
You are very kind.

520
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,227
It's not worthy of a thank you.

521
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:53,557
Get out. Come on, get out.

522
00:50:54,067 --> 00:50:56,467
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

523
00:50:57,607 --> 00:50:58,977
Why did you stop?

524
00:50:59,107 --> 00:51:01,427
We can't get you across
the border in that truck.

525
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:04,597
We don't have enough money
for all the Russians.

526
00:51:04,777 --> 00:51:07,527
- So what are we doing?
- Go climb into that vehicle.

527
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:11,897
You're joking.

528
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,147
Your choice, Agha sahib.

529
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:34,397
Climb up quickly.

530
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:42,397
Turn around and go down.

531
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,727
I'm with you. Go.

532
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:00,267
You see it?

533
00:52:00,607 --> 00:52:02,067
Yes.

534
00:52:02,437 --> 00:52:04,977
Don't be afraid.
I'm right here with you.

535
00:52:05,187 --> 00:52:07,427
I can't breathe, Baba.

536
00:52:08,107 --> 00:52:10,937
Think of something else.
Think of a poem.

537
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:12,727
Rumi?

538
00:52:13,937 --> 00:52:15,897
You've memorised some,
haven't you?

539
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:17,347
I want to hear one.

540
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:22,937
"If we come to sleep
we are His drowsy ones

541
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:26,927
"And if we come to wake
we are in His hands"

542
00:52:27,607 --> 00:52:28,637
Keep going.

543
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:32,937
"If we come to weeping
we are His cloud full of raindrops

544
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:36,227
"And if we come to laughing
we are His lightning in that moment"

545
00:52:36,777 --> 00:52:37,857
Good job.

546
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:41,437
"If we come to anger and battle
it is the reflection of His wrath

547
00:52:42,107 --> 00:52:45,137
"And if we come to peace and pardon
it is the reflection of His love

548
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:49,817
"Who are we
in this complicated world?"

549
00:53:01,457 --> 00:53:04,737
Fremont, California

550
00:53:18,707 --> 00:53:20,197
A pack of those.

551
00:53:23,497 --> 00:53:25,657
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

552
00:53:29,747 --> 00:53:31,707
- Beautiful car.
- Thanks.

553
00:53:43,877 --> 00:53:46,247
Richard Hidalgo.

554
00:53:52,287 --> 00:53:54,407
Erin Hill.

555
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,867
Denise Hawking.

556
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:08,707
Damon Hooper.

557
00:54:13,957 --> 00:54:16,277
June Kitagawa.

558
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,867
- Hi.
- Hello.

559
00:54:30,537 --> 00:54:33,457
- Tonight I'm very happy.
- Well, that's good.

560
00:54:33,877 --> 00:54:37,117
- Tonight I drink with my son.
- Hi.

561
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,037
How are you, my friend?
Let's have a drink with us.

562
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,997
- What you like to drink?
- Scotch.

563
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:44,537
- Three Scotch, please.
- I'll have a beer instead. Thanks.

564
00:54:44,627 --> 00:54:46,367
- Budweiser?
- Sure.

565
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,947
Please.

566
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:53,907
My son, the college graduate.

567
00:54:54,537 --> 00:54:57,907
- It's just community college.
- It's college.

568
00:54:59,037 --> 00:55:01,497
And someday, Dr. Amir!

569
00:55:02,877 --> 00:55:05,407
- You know I want to write.
- Write?

570
00:55:05,787 --> 00:55:07,747
I don't want to be a doctor.

571
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:10,407
Cheers.

572
00:55:15,877 --> 00:55:17,447
One more, sir.

573
00:55:18,327 --> 00:55:20,947
So instead of being doctor
and saving lives,

574
00:55:21,037 --> 00:55:22,697
he wants make up stories.

575
00:55:25,037 --> 00:55:26,697
And for money,

576
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:29,867
you can work
at the gas station with me.

577
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,777
We'll put your diploma on the wall.

578
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:35,527
Whatever you think.

579
00:55:39,497 --> 00:55:42,247
Beautiful! Beautiful shot!
You see that shot?

580
00:55:43,627 --> 00:55:46,157
A pitcher of beer for gentlemen, please.

581
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:50,037
Cheers. My son,
he graduates college today.

582
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:52,447
- Way to go, man. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

583
00:55:54,037 --> 00:55:55,697
Fuck the Russia!

584
00:55:56,377 --> 00:55:59,207
- Fuck the Russia!
- Fuck Russia.

585
00:56:06,037 --> 00:56:09,037
I wish Hassan
had been with us today.

586
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:12,287
This would make him happy.

587
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:18,697
- Four, so that's $6.
- Okay.

588
00:56:28,537 --> 00:56:29,867
Amir jan.

589
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:32,867
This is General Sahib, Mr lqbal Taheri.

590
00:56:33,497 --> 00:56:35,617
He was a decorated general in Kabul.

591
00:56:35,707 --> 00:56:37,577
Such a lofty introduction.

592
00:56:38,457 --> 00:56:40,277
- Salaam, my child.
- Salaam, General Sahib.

593
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:42,667
Amir is going to be a great writer.

594
00:56:43,877 --> 00:56:45,327
It is God's will.

595
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:47,987
Will you be writing about our country?

596
00:56:48,497 --> 00:56:49,737
History, perhaps?

597
00:56:50,827 --> 00:56:52,707
I write fiction.

598
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:55,447
A storyteller.

599
00:56:55,957 --> 00:57:00,997
Well, people do need their stories
to divert them occasionally.

600
00:57:01,497 --> 00:57:05,447
- Father, you forgot your tea.
- You are too kind, my dear.

601
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:08,867
My daughter, Soraya jan.

602
00:57:11,247 --> 00:57:13,407
Well, time to go set up.

603
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,367
Best of luck with the writing.

604
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:18,487
- Until later.
- Goodbye.

605
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:25,567
What?

606
00:57:25,997 --> 00:57:27,737
She has made an impression on you?

607
00:57:28,037 --> 00:57:29,947
Please, Baba.

608
00:57:48,957 --> 00:57:50,197
What are you writing?

609
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:52,367
A story.

610
00:57:55,957 --> 00:57:57,827
Write well.

611
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:07,577
- How much?
- $160.

612
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:09,077
Not bad.

613
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:12,577
- You want a Coke?
- Sure. Be careful.

614
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:14,487
Of what?

615
00:58:14,577 --> 00:58:18,027
The General is a Pashtun to the root.
He has honour and pride.

616
00:58:18,747 --> 00:58:20,737
I was only going to get us Cokes.

617
00:58:20,877 --> 00:58:22,417
Just don't embarrass me.

618
00:58:22,877 --> 00:58:24,577
That's all I ask.

619
00:58:25,247 --> 00:58:26,577
I won't.

620
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:37,657
- Hi.
- Hi.

621
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:41,077
- Is General Sahib here today?
- Yeah, he went that way.

622
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:45,577
Will you tell him that I stopped by
to pay my respects?

623
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:47,567
I will.

624
00:58:47,667 --> 00:58:51,077
Thank you. Oh, and my name's Amir.

625
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:55,327
In case you need to know,
so you can tell him that I stopped by.

626
00:58:55,417 --> 00:58:57,207
To pay my respects.

627
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:03,867
- I'll go now. Sorry to disturb you.
- Oh, no, no, you didn't.

628
00:59:05,497 --> 00:59:07,037
Good.

629
00:59:09,957 --> 00:59:12,027
Can I ask what you're reading?

630
00:59:13,627 --> 00:59:15,277
Have you read it?

631
00:59:15,997 --> 00:59:17,657
It's a sad story.

632
00:59:19,037 --> 00:59:20,697
I heard you write.

633
00:59:24,037 --> 00:59:26,607
Would you like to read
one of my stories?

634
00:59:29,497 --> 00:59:30,907
I'd like that.

635
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:34,947
Great.

636
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:17,077
- How much for this?
- $5.

637
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,827
- I'll give you three.
- Okay.

638
01:00:21,627 --> 01:00:23,077
Thank you.

639
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:26,657
- You're not much of a haggler.
- I know.

640
01:00:28,077 --> 01:00:30,157
I brought you something.

641
01:00:31,747 --> 01:00:34,317
- You remembered.
- Of course.

642
01:00:35,627 --> 01:00:38,617
Our aspiring storyteller.
What a pleasure.

643
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:50,567
They say it will rain this week.

644
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:52,957
Hard to believe, isn't it?

645
01:00:54,707 --> 01:00:56,117
You know, child,

646
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:58,617
I've grown rather fond of you.

647
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,747
You're a decent boy.

648
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:07,957
But, sometimes,
even decent boys need reminding.

649
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:13,997
So it's my duty to remind you
that you are among peers.

650
01:01:15,127 --> 01:01:17,957
Here, everyone is a storyteller.

651
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:21,367
Do pass my respects to your father.

652
01:01:22,037 --> 01:01:23,287
Yes, of course.

653
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:27,657
- For your granddaughter?
- My granddaughter.

654
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:30,157
- Impossible.
- Thank you very much.

655
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:32,077
Here you go. Thank You.

656
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:34,287
- Have a good day.
- You're welcome.

657
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:39,867
Amir.

658
01:01:41,127 --> 01:01:42,577
What's wrong?

659
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:44,577
Nothing.

660
01:01:45,877 --> 01:01:47,367
The General?

661
01:01:51,327 --> 01:01:52,737
You okay?

662
01:01:58,257 --> 01:01:59,457
You all right?

663
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:00,627
Have you been coughing?

664
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:02,247
Yes.

665
01:02:03,627 --> 01:02:05,167
Where are you from?

666
01:02:05,257 --> 01:02:08,787
I grew up in Michigan.
Came out here for medical school.

667
01:02:08,877 --> 01:02:11,587
Once you get used to
that California sunshine...

668
01:02:11,677 --> 01:02:13,957
- But your family?
- My family.

669
01:02:14,047 --> 01:02:16,207
We're originally from Russia.

670
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,087
I'm sorry.

671
01:02:39,627 --> 01:02:42,087
- How are you feeling?
- The same.

672
01:02:43,337 --> 01:02:45,247
We have your results back.

673
01:02:50,257 --> 01:02:51,747
Wait outside for me.

674
01:03:10,627 --> 01:03:13,717
"The citizens of Kabul
were skeletons now,

675
01:03:13,797 --> 01:03:16,467
skeletons selling naswar
in the night market,

676
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:19,167
skeletons drinking cups of strong tea,

677
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:22,407
skeletons playing cards
in the moonlight.

678
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:27,917
They greeted me as I passed,
teeth clacking together in their jaws.

679
01:03:29,627 --> 01:03:32,247
'Salaam, brother', they said.

680
01:03:34,007 --> 01:03:35,547
"Welcome home."

681
01:03:42,337 --> 01:03:44,047
It's sort of a work in progress.

682
01:03:46,127 --> 01:03:48,537
It's called The Sultans of Kabul.

683
01:03:49,677 --> 01:03:51,047
Good title.

684
01:03:52,877 --> 01:03:54,287
Keep going.

685
01:03:55,837 --> 01:03:57,297
That's the end.

686
01:03:58,507 --> 01:04:00,247
That's not an ending.

687
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:03,787
It's my story.

688
01:04:03,877 --> 01:04:05,957
I get to end it how I want.

689
01:04:10,587 --> 01:04:14,797
I'm tired of these machines.
Tomorrow I want you to take me home.

690
01:04:15,177 --> 01:04:16,547
But Dr Amani said...

691
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:18,837
It's not Dr Amani's decision.

692
01:04:35,757 --> 01:04:37,667
How are you, my friend?

693
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:44,207
You shouldn't
have burdened yourselves.

694
01:04:44,677 --> 01:04:45,747
It's no burden.

695
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:49,257
No burden at all.

696
01:04:49,337 --> 01:04:53,797
If you need anything,
ask me like you'd ask a brother.

697
01:04:55,337 --> 01:04:56,917
Your coming here

698
01:04:58,087 --> 01:05:00,077
has brightened my eyes.

699
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,537
What about you, Amir jan?

700
01:05:03,757 --> 01:05:05,707
Do you need anything?

701
01:05:06,837 --> 01:05:09,757
No, thank you, General Sahib.

702
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:13,167
Excuse me.

703
01:05:15,547 --> 01:05:16,747
Thank you.

704
01:05:17,507 --> 01:05:20,377
Those are beautiful flowers.

705
01:05:41,587 --> 01:05:43,217
I'm really sorry.

706
01:05:46,337 --> 01:05:49,997
You better go back inside
or your father will come after me.

707
01:05:53,837 --> 01:05:55,747
Your story made me cry.

708
01:05:58,507 --> 01:05:59,877
You read it?

709
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:03,497
Our secret?

710
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:06,747
Yeah.

711
01:06:08,337 --> 01:06:09,667
Our secret.

712
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:44,417
Can I do anything else for you?

713
01:06:46,257 --> 01:06:48,707
No, child. Thank you.

714
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:53,127
Then I wonder
if you'd do something for me.

715
01:06:57,427 --> 01:06:59,747
I want you to go khastegari.

716
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:03,957
I want you to ask General Taheri
for his daughter's hand.

717
01:07:06,467 --> 01:07:08,127
Are you sure?

718
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:13,127
More sure than I've
ever been about anything.

719
01:07:16,627 --> 01:07:19,167
Then give me the phone
and my address book.

720
01:07:21,257 --> 01:07:22,457
Now?

721
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:24,797
Then when?

722
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,707
Yes, much better.

723
01:07:32,297 --> 01:07:35,217
It was gracious of you to come.

724
01:07:36,127 --> 01:07:37,707
I called to ask,

725
01:07:38,297 --> 01:07:39,957
if you have time,

726
01:07:40,127 --> 01:07:41,837
if I may pay you
a visit tomorrow morning.

727
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:44,497
It's an honourable matter.

728
01:07:45,257 --> 01:07:46,287
Nine o'clock?

729
01:07:46,467 --> 01:07:47,577
That's just fine.

730
01:07:47,757 --> 01:07:48,787
Until then.

731
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:02,907
Go home.

732
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:04,747
I'll call you in an hour.

733
01:08:05,007 --> 01:08:07,407
Okay. Good luck.

734
01:08:13,467 --> 01:08:14,497
Hello?

735
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:15,667
The General accepted.

736
01:08:15,757 --> 01:08:17,797
- He accepted?
- Yes, he accepted.

737
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:20,417
But Soraya jan wants
to talk to you first.

738
01:08:20,967 --> 01:08:23,247
- About what?
- About what?

739
01:08:23,337 --> 01:08:26,457
How do I know about what?
She wants to talk to you.

740
01:08:26,627 --> 01:08:28,457
Okay. Okay. I'm on my way.

741
01:08:44,127 --> 01:08:47,627
How are you?
Come inside and have some tea.

742
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:50,787
He didn't come for tea.

743
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:53,957
It doesn't matter,
we're going out for a walk.

744
01:08:58,797 --> 01:09:00,867
You do want to get married?

745
01:09:02,127 --> 01:09:04,617
- To me, I mean.
- Of course I do.

746
01:09:06,967 --> 01:09:09,837
It's just... I want to tell you something,

747
01:09:11,007 --> 01:09:13,047
something you need to know.

748
01:09:14,377 --> 01:09:16,587
I don't want us to start with secrets.

749
01:09:20,127 --> 01:09:22,617
We lived in Virginia
before we came here.

750
01:09:22,717 --> 01:09:24,337
We left because

751
01:09:25,967 --> 01:09:28,287
I ran away with an Afghan man.

752
01:09:29,007 --> 01:09:32,127
I was 18.
I guess I thought I was being rebellious.

753
01:09:32,967 --> 01:09:35,457
We lived together for almost a month.

754
01:09:36,677 --> 01:09:39,507
All the Afghans in Virginia
were talking about it.

755
01:09:41,717 --> 01:09:42,997
My father eventually found us.

756
01:09:43,087 --> 01:09:46,957
He showed up at the door
and he made me come home.

757
01:09:47,047 --> 01:09:50,577
I was hysterical,
and I told him I hated him.

758
01:09:53,717 --> 01:09:56,417
We moved out to California
a few weeks later.

759
01:09:56,967 --> 01:10:00,497
I didn't talk to my father
for a very long time. And now...

760
01:10:01,927 --> 01:10:04,917
Now I feel like he's the reason
why I'm here.

761
01:10:07,427 --> 01:10:09,747
Does what I told you bother you?

762
01:10:11,297 --> 01:10:12,627
A little.

763
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,667
Does it bother you enough
to change your mind?

764
01:10:17,757 --> 01:10:19,087
No.

765
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:22,257
Not even close.

766
01:10:24,757 --> 01:10:26,827
I'd marry you tonight if I could.

767
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,687
What do you see?

768
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:02,317
The rest of my life.

769
01:12:57,567 --> 01:13:01,257
- They're so funny.
- They were crazy.

770
01:13:03,607 --> 01:13:05,187
That's a funny picture.

771
01:13:06,727 --> 01:13:08,057
They're so cute.

772
01:13:09,227 --> 01:13:12,017
- Amir jan?
- Right here, Baba.

773
01:13:12,107 --> 01:13:13,727
Help me to bed.

774
01:13:14,187 --> 01:13:15,437
Of course.

775
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:37,777
I'll come back with your morphine
and a glass of water.

776
01:13:38,357 --> 01:13:39,387
No.

777
01:13:39,857 --> 01:13:41,597
There is no pain tonight.

778
01:13:44,147 --> 01:13:46,187
Come here, my daughter.

779
01:14:59,857 --> 01:15:01,097
San Francisco

780
01:15:01,187 --> 01:15:02,977
It will not be easy.

781
01:15:03,857 --> 01:15:06,097
But you must come, Amir.

782
01:15:07,687 --> 01:15:08,847
All right.

783
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:09,967
You're a good man.

784
01:15:10,067 --> 01:15:11,227
God willing.

785
01:15:11,527 --> 01:15:14,007
Goodbye.

786
01:15:30,647 --> 01:15:32,017
You all right?

787
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:35,177
I have to go to Pakistan.

788
01:15:36,857 --> 01:15:38,137
Pakistan?

789
01:15:38,897 --> 01:15:40,857
Rahim Khan is very sick.

790
01:15:41,357 --> 01:15:43,677
Your father's friend?

791
01:15:43,777 --> 01:15:45,597
Is it safe right now?

792
01:15:47,897 --> 01:15:49,807
What about the book tour?

793
01:15:52,227 --> 01:15:55,187
There wouldn't be any books
if not for Rahim Khan.

794
01:16:03,857 --> 01:16:05,847
Peshawar, Pakistan

795
01:16:06,157 --> 01:16:08,197
It's terrible what's happening
in your country.

796
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:11,117
Afghani people and Pakistani people,
they are like brothers.

797
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:12,907
Muslim have to help Muslim.

798
01:16:14,247 --> 01:16:17,027
They call this area Afghan Town.

799
01:16:17,117 --> 01:16:20,447
Sometimes it feels like Peshawar
is a suburb of Kabul.

800
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:28,607
This way.

801
01:16:49,657 --> 01:16:51,197
Amir jan.

802
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,187
Amir jan.

803
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:58,067
Welcome, welcome.

804
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,347
You've become a man.

805
01:17:02,697 --> 01:17:05,017
General Taheri's daughter.

806
01:17:05,527 --> 01:17:07,647
She's a beauty.

807
01:17:09,197 --> 01:17:11,107
Any children?

808
01:17:14,407 --> 01:17:16,067
We tried, but

809
01:17:17,117 --> 01:17:19,647
it doesn't seem possible for us.

810
01:17:21,817 --> 01:17:22,987
Thank you.

811
01:17:25,737 --> 01:17:28,437
How long have you been in Pakistan?

812
01:17:28,657 --> 01:17:32,727
Less than a year.
Kabul is no longer safe for me.

813
01:17:33,527 --> 01:17:35,897
The Taliban are as bad as they say?

814
01:17:36,487 --> 01:17:37,687
Oh, worse.

815
01:17:37,777 --> 01:17:41,277
Much worse.
They don't let you be human.

816
01:17:41,617 --> 01:17:44,607
They even banned kite flying.

817
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,687
I have something for you.

818
01:17:55,867 --> 01:17:57,237
What's this?

819
01:17:58,947 --> 01:18:00,147
Look.

820
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:13,477
"For Rahim Khan,
who listened to my stories

821
01:18:14,407 --> 01:18:16,647
"before I knew how to write them."

822
01:18:24,697 --> 01:18:26,687
This is a great honour, Amir.

823
01:18:33,697 --> 01:18:35,567
Let me take you home with me.

824
01:18:36,367 --> 01:18:38,567
I can find you a good doctor.

825
01:18:39,237 --> 01:18:41,777
They're coming up with new treatments
all the time.

826
01:18:44,277 --> 01:18:45,987
Amir, Amir, Amir.

827
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:51,527
I see America has infused you
with her optimism.

828
01:18:52,737 --> 01:18:56,107
But there is such a thing as God's will.

829
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:01,817
Come, sit.

830
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:06,857
I didn't bring you here
to complain about my health.

831
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:12,817
Forgive me, Amir jan.
Forgive me for what I have to tell you.

832
01:19:18,197 --> 01:19:19,817
Hassan is dead.

833
01:19:27,407 --> 01:19:28,517
How?

834
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:33,357
You know I watched over
your father's house after you left.

835
01:19:35,157 --> 01:19:38,767
But none of the caretakers I hired
lasted more than a year.

836
01:19:39,777 --> 01:19:42,477
Some were dishonest, some lazy.

837
01:19:44,527 --> 01:19:47,937
So a few years ago I went to Hazarajat

838
01:19:49,867 --> 01:19:52,567
and brought Hassan
and his family home with me.

839
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:59,197
His wife, Farzana, and his son, Sohrab.

840
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:03,317
Rostam and Sohrab

841
01:20:05,527 --> 01:20:07,647
It was so good to have them there.

842
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:12,227
Hassan kept the house
from falling apart.

843
01:20:12,527 --> 01:20:15,197
And Farzana cooked the meals.

844
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:16,847
It was good.

845
01:20:17,197 --> 01:20:18,737
Very good.

846
01:20:20,277 --> 01:20:22,737
But when my health began to fail,

847
01:20:22,817 --> 01:20:26,897
well, there isn't a hospital in
Afghanistan that can help me,

848
01:20:26,987 --> 01:20:28,397
so I came here.

849
01:20:30,487 --> 01:20:34,267
A few weeks after I left,
the Taliban came to the house.

850
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:38,187
Hassan told them that he was looking
after the house for me, but...

851
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:43,607
They said that he was a liar and a thief
like all the other Hazaras.

852
01:20:43,697 --> 01:20:46,897
And they ordered him to leave
with his family by nightfall.

853
01:20:48,817 --> 01:20:51,277
Hassan wouldn't leave.

854
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:56,437
So they took him to the street
and ordered him to kneel

855
01:20:58,657 --> 01:21:01,407
and shot him in the back of the head.

856
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:06,897
Farzana came screaming
and attacked them and...

857
01:21:09,277 --> 01:21:10,907
They shot her, too.

858
01:21:13,157 --> 01:21:14,477
And the boy?

859
01:21:17,367 --> 01:21:18,477
Sohrab?

860
01:21:19,367 --> 01:21:22,227
He is in an orphanage

861
01:21:24,447 --> 01:21:26,187
in Karteh Seh.

862
01:21:27,657 --> 01:21:31,517
Hassan sent this to me a week
before he died.

863
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:35,317
It's for you.

864
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:42,897
He taught himself to read and write.

865
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:48,647
He didn't want to send you a letter
until he could do it properly.

866
01:21:55,657 --> 01:21:56,847
Amir,

867
01:21:59,117 --> 01:22:01,317
you need to go back to Kabul.

868
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,027
I've arranged for a driver.
He's a good man.

869
01:22:05,117 --> 01:22:06,817
I can't go back to Kabul.

870
01:22:07,567 --> 01:22:11,147
Can't you pay someone here to go?
I'll pay for it if it's a matter of money.

871
01:22:11,237 --> 01:22:12,977
It's not about money.

872
01:22:15,027 --> 01:22:16,687
You are a storyteller.

873
01:22:17,447 --> 01:22:20,017
Some part of you
has always known this story.

874
01:22:22,117 --> 01:22:24,977
Ali's first wife was from Jaghori.

875
01:22:26,367 --> 01:22:28,977
What does that
have to do with anything?

876
01:22:29,317 --> 01:22:32,607
After five years she left him childless,

877
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,897
and married a man from Khost.

878
01:22:37,987 --> 01:22:40,397
She bore that man three daughters.

879
01:22:41,987 --> 01:22:44,987
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

880
01:22:45,987 --> 01:22:48,107
Ali was sterile.

881
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:51,027
But he had Hassan.

882
01:22:51,117 --> 01:22:54,477
He raised Hassan. He didn't father him.

883
01:22:56,367 --> 01:23:01,187
Your father loved you both
because you were both his sons,

884
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,767
- and Sohrab...
- No.

885
01:23:04,157 --> 01:23:05,437
He's your nephew.

886
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:07,317
I don't believe you.

887
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:09,727
You do.

888
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:12,607
That's what frightens you.

889
01:23:13,657 --> 01:23:15,317
You're saying

890
01:23:16,657 --> 01:23:17,817
my father,

891
01:23:19,157 --> 01:23:21,477
for all those years,

892
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:23,857
lied to me.

893
01:23:24,817 --> 01:23:25,987
Please think.

894
01:23:27,157 --> 01:23:31,807
All that a man had back then
was his honour, his name,

895
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:33,727
and if people talked...

896
01:23:33,817 --> 01:23:36,567
- He lied to me.
- He lied to both of you.

897
01:23:37,407 --> 01:23:40,567
And now there is a way
to be good again.

898
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:25,067
"In the name of God,
the merciful, the compassionate,

899
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:28,487
Amir agha, with my deepest respects.

900
01:24:29,157 --> 01:24:32,187
My wife and son and I
pray this letter finds you in fine health,

901
01:24:32,277 --> 01:24:34,647
and in the light of God's good graces.

902
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:37,357
I'm hopeful that one day I will hold
one of your letters in my hands

903
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:39,937
and read of your life in America.

904
01:24:40,027 --> 01:24:43,727
I am trying to learn English.
It's such a tricky language.

905
01:24:43,817 --> 01:24:47,067
But one day, agha. I miss your stories.

906
01:24:48,197 --> 01:24:51,147
I've included a picture of me
and my son, Sohrab.

907
01:24:51,237 --> 01:24:53,027
He's a good boy.

908
01:24:53,117 --> 01:24:54,937
Rahim Khan and I
taught him how to read and write,

909
01:24:55,027 --> 01:24:57,857
so he doesn't grow up
stupid like his father.

910
01:24:57,947 --> 01:25:01,147
And can he shoot
with that slingshot you gave me!

911
01:25:03,157 --> 01:25:06,437
But I fear for him, Amir agha.

912
01:25:06,527 --> 01:25:09,097
The Afghanistan of our youth
is long dead.

913
01:25:09,197 --> 01:25:14,147
Kindness is gone from the land,
and you cannot escape the killings.

914
01:25:14,237 --> 01:25:16,307
Always the killings.

915
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:19,687
I dream that God will guide us
to a better day.

916
01:25:19,777 --> 01:25:23,357
I dream that my son will grow up
to be a good person,

917
01:25:23,447 --> 01:25:25,687
a free person,

918
01:25:25,777 --> 01:25:27,607
an important person.

919
01:25:27,697 --> 01:25:30,647
I dream that flowers will bloom
in the streets of Kabul again,

920
01:25:30,737 --> 01:25:33,737
and music will play
in the samovar houses,

921
01:25:33,817 --> 01:25:36,817
and kites will fly in the skies.

922
01:25:36,907 --> 01:25:39,607
And I dream that someday
you will return to Kabul

923
01:25:39,697 --> 01:25:42,397
to revisit the land of our childhood.

924
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:46,777
If you do, you'll find
an old faithful friend waiting for you.

925
01:25:47,617 --> 01:25:50,647
May God be with you always.

926
01:25:50,737 --> 01:25:52,317
Hassan.

927
01:26:04,657 --> 01:26:05,817
Hello?

928
01:26:06,657 --> 01:26:07,817
Hi.

929
01:26:09,277 --> 01:26:11,767
- Did I wake you up?
- No.

930
01:26:13,117 --> 01:26:14,657
You all right?

931
01:26:15,777 --> 01:26:17,737
I have to tell you a story.

932
01:26:20,817 --> 01:26:22,147
What's his name?

933
01:26:48,947 --> 01:26:50,817
Stop playing with it.

934
01:26:52,197 --> 01:26:54,107
I really have to wear it?

935
01:26:55,027 --> 01:26:59,357
You know what the Taliban will do to
you if they see you are clean-shaven?

936
01:27:55,237 --> 01:27:57,477
So what brings you back
to Afghanistan?

937
01:27:57,567 --> 01:28:00,657
Come to sell off your father's land,
pocket the money?

938
01:28:01,697 --> 01:28:03,487
I'm not here to sell anything.

939
01:28:04,407 --> 01:28:06,557
I'm going to Kabul to find a boy.

940
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:09,317
A boy?

941
01:28:17,777 --> 01:28:19,357
This boy?

942
01:28:19,447 --> 01:28:21,517
This Hazara boy?

943
01:28:21,617 --> 01:28:23,027
Yeah.

944
01:28:24,237 --> 01:28:26,197
What he means to you?

945
01:28:28,527 --> 01:28:32,357
His father meant a lot to me.
He's the man in the photo.

946
01:28:33,737 --> 01:28:35,447
He's dead now.

947
01:28:36,697 --> 01:28:38,687
It was a friend of yours?

948
01:28:40,367 --> 01:28:41,907
He was my brother.

949
01:28:50,027 --> 01:28:52,697
I feel like a tourist in my own country.

950
01:28:52,987 --> 01:28:56,517
You've always been a tourist here.
You just didn't know it.

951
01:29:01,067 --> 01:29:04,817
- What happened to the trees?
- The Russians chopped them down.

952
01:29:15,447 --> 01:29:17,437
You know what they're doing?

953
01:29:19,157 --> 01:29:20,697
He's selling his leg?

954
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:23,517
He can get good money for it.

955
01:29:23,617 --> 01:29:26,017
Feed your kids for a couple of weeks.

956
01:29:39,697 --> 01:29:41,737
- What's that smell?
- Diesel.

957
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:46,557
The power's always going off
so people use generators.

958
01:29:48,697 --> 01:29:51,857
Do you remember what this street
smelled like in the old days?

959
01:29:54,487 --> 01:29:58,857
Lamb kabob.

960
01:30:04,027 --> 01:30:06,647
Beard patrol.

961
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:13,027
What's the matter with you?

962
01:30:13,657 --> 01:30:14,687
What?

963
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:17,067
Don't you ever stare at them!

964
01:30:18,367 --> 01:30:19,737
Understand me?

965
01:30:20,367 --> 01:30:21,397
Never!

966
01:31:15,947 --> 01:31:17,687
We're looking for this boy.

967
01:31:17,777 --> 01:31:19,937
I'm sorry.
I've never seen him.

968
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:22,687
You barely looked
at the picture, my friend.

969
01:31:22,817 --> 01:31:24,857
I know all the children here

970
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,357
and that one doesn't look familiar.

971
01:31:27,867 --> 01:31:29,407
And now, if you'll permit me...

972
01:31:29,617 --> 01:31:31,237
We don't mean him any harm.

973
01:31:31,367 --> 01:31:33,067
I told you he's not here.

974
01:31:33,197 --> 01:31:35,687
- Now, please, go away.
- Friend, we are not with the Taliban.

975
01:31:35,777 --> 01:31:37,987
The man wants to
take this boy to a safe place.

976
01:31:38,277 --> 01:31:39,907
I knew Sohrab's father.

977
01:31:40,277 --> 01:31:41,437
His name was Hassan.

978
01:31:42,027 --> 01:31:44,437
There's hope for this boy, Agha.

979
01:31:44,907 --> 01:31:46,447
A way out.

980
01:31:47,117 --> 01:31:49,017
I can take him back to America with me.

981
01:31:50,487 --> 01:31:52,477
I'm his uncle.

982
01:31:57,867 --> 01:32:00,397
What I have to tell you is not pleasant.

983
01:32:01,027 --> 01:32:03,727
I tell you, because I believe you.

984
01:32:04,277 --> 01:32:06,897
You have the look of desperate men.

985
01:32:13,657 --> 01:32:16,147
There is a Talib official.

986
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:19,437
He visits every month or two.

987
01:32:20,407 --> 01:32:22,687
He brings cash with him.

988
01:32:22,867 --> 01:32:26,027
Not a lot, but better than nothing.

989
01:32:27,197 --> 01:32:29,267
Usually, he takes a girl.

990
01:32:30,367 --> 01:32:32,017
But not always.

991
01:32:33,817 --> 01:32:35,147
And you allow this?

992
01:32:35,737 --> 01:32:37,357
What choice do I have?

993
01:32:38,197 --> 01:32:39,527
You're the director here.

994
01:32:40,067 --> 01:32:41,897
Your job is to watch over these children.

995
01:32:41,987 --> 01:32:43,397
There is nothing I can do.

996
01:32:43,487 --> 01:32:45,607
- You're selling children!
- Easy.

997
01:32:45,697 --> 01:32:46,897
You're here to protect them!

998
01:32:46,987 --> 01:32:48,097
Yes,

999
01:32:48,197 --> 01:32:49,687
I am here to protect them.

1000
01:32:49,947 --> 01:32:51,057
Sit.

1001
01:32:53,157 --> 01:32:54,897
And you, brother?

1002
01:32:55,317 --> 01:32:58,107
You come here to rescue a boy,

1003
01:32:58,407 --> 01:33:01,317
take him back to America,
give him a good life.

1004
01:33:02,117 --> 01:33:04,317
It must seem heroic, huh?

1005
01:33:04,947 --> 01:33:07,267
But what of the other
two hundred children?

1006
01:33:07,657 --> 01:33:09,397
You'll never see them again.

1007
01:33:09,487 --> 01:33:11,977
You'll never hear them
howling in the night.

1008
01:33:12,947 --> 01:33:15,267
I spent my life savings
on this orphanage.

1009
01:33:15,407 --> 01:33:19,567
Everything I owned or inherited
I sold to run this godforsaken place.

1010
01:33:20,737 --> 01:33:24,687
You think I don't have family
in Pakistan or Iran?

1011
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:28,447
I could have run like everyone else.

1012
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:32,687
If I deny him one child, he takes 10.

1013
01:33:33,617 --> 01:33:36,227
So, I let him take one,

1014
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,647
and leave the judging to Allah.

1015
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:43,737
I take his filthy money,
and I go to the bazaar,

1016
01:33:44,407 --> 01:33:45,727
and I buy food for the children.

1017
01:33:47,317 --> 01:33:50,027
You think I spend it on myself?

1018
01:33:50,817 --> 01:33:52,277
Look at me.

1019
01:33:53,657 --> 01:33:54,737
Look.

1020
01:33:55,487 --> 01:33:57,357
What happens to the children he takes?

1021
01:33:58,817 --> 01:34:01,357
Sometimes, they come back,

1022
01:34:02,567 --> 01:34:04,527
more often, they don't.

1023
01:34:07,407 --> 01:34:09,227
Who is he?

1024
01:34:10,117 --> 01:34:12,397
How do I find him?

1025
01:34:16,237 --> 01:34:19,237
Go to the Ghazi Stadium tomorrow.

1026
01:34:19,407 --> 01:34:22,817
You'll see him at halftime.

1027
01:34:23,777 --> 01:34:26,447
He'll be the one making speeches.

1028
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:31,027
Now, please leave.
You've frightened the children.

1029
01:34:33,777 --> 01:34:35,407
Pull over here.

1030
01:35:21,737 --> 01:35:22,767
We should go.

1031
01:35:28,237 --> 01:35:29,697
I have to look at one more thing.

1032
01:35:29,777 --> 01:35:31,897
Nothing that you remember
has survived.

1033
01:35:31,987 --> 01:35:33,397
Better to forget.

1034
01:35:34,447 --> 01:35:36,237
I don't want to forget any more.

1035
01:37:14,817 --> 01:37:16,727
Do you want to stay here?

1036
01:37:17,567 --> 01:37:19,227
No, but we have to.

1037
01:37:30,527 --> 01:37:31,687
That's him.

1038
01:37:39,777 --> 01:37:41,187
Brothers and sisters!

1039
01:37:41,697 --> 01:37:43,987
We are here today
to carry out Shari'a.

1040
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,477
We are here today
to carry out justice.

1041
01:37:46,987 --> 01:37:49,187
We listen to what God says,
and we obey.

1042
01:37:49,567 --> 01:37:50,647
And what does God say?

1043
01:37:50,867 --> 01:37:54,647
Every sinner must be punished
in a manner befitting his sin.

1044
01:37:55,237 --> 01:37:58,437
Those are not my words,
nor the words of my brothers.

1045
01:37:58,737 --> 01:38:00,647
Those are the words of God!

1046
01:38:00,817 --> 01:38:03,687
And what manner of punishment
benefits the adulterer?

1047
01:38:03,907 --> 01:38:08,027
How shall we punish those
who dishonour the sanctity of marriage?

1048
01:38:08,907 --> 01:38:12,597
How shall we deal
with those who disobey God?

1049
01:38:13,237 --> 01:38:17,277
How shall we answer those who throw
stones at the windows of God's house?

1050
01:38:18,237 --> 01:38:20,907
We shall throw stones back!

1051
01:38:46,367 --> 01:38:47,477
My friend.

1052
01:38:47,697 --> 01:38:49,737
My friend, a word?

1053
01:38:51,067 --> 01:38:52,897
We have business with your brother.

1054
01:38:55,367 --> 01:38:57,237
Personal business.

1055
01:39:58,357 --> 01:40:02,347
I guess I'll wait in the car.
This is your business now.

1056
01:40:03,767 --> 01:40:06,057
Thank you for helping me.

1057
01:40:17,857 --> 01:40:19,647
Anyone there?

1058
01:40:23,567 --> 01:40:26,397
I was told to come here.

1059
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:31,847
Come in.

1060
01:40:33,017 --> 01:40:34,047
Thank you.

1061
01:40:46,727 --> 01:40:48,187
How soft.

1062
01:41:25,897 --> 01:41:27,057
Sit down.

1063
01:41:28,067 --> 01:41:29,227
Sit down.

1064
01:42:02,157 --> 01:42:04,487
I think there's been a mistake.

1065
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:07,317
I came to see your friend.

1066
01:42:08,907 --> 01:42:11,317
The man who made
the speech at the stadium.

1067
01:42:11,827 --> 01:42:13,657
He has other business.

1068
01:42:14,287 --> 01:42:16,157
You can do away with that now.

1069
01:42:18,997 --> 01:42:20,657
I'm not sure what you mean.

1070
01:42:21,327 --> 01:42:22,787
Take off your beard.

1071
01:42:38,787 --> 01:42:41,237
One of the better ones I've seen.

1072
01:42:42,577 --> 01:42:43,817
Take off the turban.

1073
01:42:49,957 --> 01:42:51,407
You come from America?

1074
01:42:53,747 --> 01:42:54,907
Yes.

1075
01:42:59,117 --> 01:43:00,277
I'm looking for a boy.

1076
01:43:00,787 --> 01:43:02,777
Isn't everybody?

1077
01:43:04,537 --> 01:43:07,447
I understand your friend
brought him here.

1078
01:43:08,327 --> 01:43:09,817
His name is Sohrab.

1079
01:43:10,787 --> 01:43:12,607
Let me ask you something.

1080
01:43:13,367 --> 01:43:15,607
What are you doing
with that whore America?

1081
01:43:16,287 --> 01:43:17,947
Why aren't you here

1082
01:43:18,617 --> 01:43:21,237
with your Muslim brothers,
serving your country.

1083
01:43:22,367 --> 01:43:24,827
I've been away for a long time.

1084
01:43:26,037 --> 01:43:27,367
That's an answer?

1085
01:43:28,957 --> 01:43:30,577
Not an answer, they say.

1086
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:34,817
I'm only here for the boy.

1087
01:43:35,867 --> 01:43:37,117
Do you want to see him?

1088
01:44:16,787 --> 01:44:17,987
Come, my boy.

1089
01:44:24,457 --> 01:44:26,327
Such a talented little Hazara.

1090
01:44:27,707 --> 01:44:29,197
Leave us be.

1091
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:34,617
I've been wondering,

1092
01:44:34,997 --> 01:44:37,827
whatever happened to
your great Baba, anyway?

1093
01:44:39,577 --> 01:44:40,657
What did you think?

1094
01:44:41,117 --> 01:44:43,487
That you'd put on a fake beard
and I wouldn't recognise you?

1095
01:44:44,617 --> 01:44:46,987
I knew you the second
I saw you in the stadium.

1096
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:49,867
I never forget a face. Never!

1097
01:44:51,287 --> 01:44:52,747
Assef?

1098
01:44:52,957 --> 01:44:54,147
Amir jan.

1099
01:44:56,077 --> 01:44:57,447
What are you doing here?

1100
01:44:57,657 --> 01:44:58,907
Me?

1101
01:44:59,117 --> 01:45:00,777
I'm home.

1102
01:45:01,457 --> 01:45:03,607
The question is,
what are you doing here?

1103
01:45:05,867 --> 01:45:07,777
I'm taking the boy home with me.

1104
01:45:11,497 --> 01:45:12,867
You want my advice?

1105
01:45:13,367 --> 01:45:14,647
Run away.

1106
01:45:15,037 --> 01:45:16,697
That's what you do best.

1107
01:45:18,117 --> 01:45:19,777
Not without Sohrab.

1108
01:45:21,497 --> 01:45:22,687
Why's that?

1109
01:45:22,997 --> 01:45:24,567
The boy's too good for his country?

1110
01:45:24,747 --> 01:45:26,487
What do you know about Afghanistan?

1111
01:45:27,117 --> 01:45:29,077
You weren't here when the Communists
shot our mullahs

1112
01:45:29,157 --> 01:45:30,657
and pissed in our mosques.

1113
01:45:30,747 --> 01:45:33,947
This country was like a beautiful
mansion littered with garbage.

1114
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:37,237
We took out the garbage.
We brought law. We brought justice.

1115
01:45:37,327 --> 01:45:39,237
I have seen your laws

1116
01:45:39,617 --> 01:45:41,277
and your justice.

1117
01:45:41,827 --> 01:45:43,787
And I'm taking the boy home with me.

1118
01:45:43,867 --> 01:45:45,407
All right, then.

1119
01:45:50,037 --> 01:45:52,907
Of course, I didn't say
you could take him for free.

1120
01:46:24,497 --> 01:46:25,817
No more.

1121
01:46:26,247 --> 01:46:27,947
No more, Agha.
Please, stop hurting him.

1122
01:46:28,247 --> 01:46:31,327
Put it down, Hazara.
You'll get yours next.

1123
01:46:32,457 --> 01:46:33,487
Put it down!

1124
01:46:39,327 --> 01:46:40,407
Get it out!

1125
01:46:43,367 --> 01:46:45,237
Get it out!

1126
01:47:13,207 --> 01:47:14,697
Kill him!

1127
01:48:31,707 --> 01:48:34,867
Go home to your family.

1128
01:48:48,747 --> 01:48:50,067
Are you Amir?

1129
01:48:52,207 --> 01:48:54,867
Rahim Khan left this for you.

1130
01:48:55,707 --> 01:48:57,027
Where did he go?

1131
01:48:57,707 --> 01:48:59,777
I did not ask.

1132
01:49:00,957 --> 01:49:02,447
But he'll be back?

1133
01:49:03,367 --> 01:49:06,817
He has left us, my child.

1134
01:49:23,657 --> 01:49:25,617
You're wasting your hand.

1135
01:49:43,907 --> 01:49:45,157
Sohrab?

1136
01:49:54,827 --> 01:49:56,027
Sohrab?

1137
01:50:17,827 --> 01:50:18,937
Sohrab?

1138
01:50:36,907 --> 01:50:38,077
Sohrab?

1139
01:51:17,957 --> 01:51:20,567
Take off your shoes, dear brother.

1140
01:51:21,997 --> 01:51:23,787
Forgive me.

1141
01:52:41,857 --> 01:52:44,777
I thought I lost you.

1142
01:52:52,317 --> 01:52:55,567
He used to come get me
in the morning before prayers.

1143
01:52:57,737 --> 01:53:00,397
I didn't want him
to get me any more.

1144
01:53:05,067 --> 01:53:07,467
He won't, Sohrab.

1145
01:53:08,937 --> 01:53:10,687
I swear to you,

1146
01:53:12,187 --> 01:53:14,427
he can't get you any more.

1147
01:53:16,237 --> 01:53:18,227
Are your parents dead?

1148
01:53:21,437 --> 01:53:22,717
Yes.

1149
01:53:24,737 --> 01:53:27,107
Do you remember what they look like?

1150
01:53:29,897 --> 01:53:31,527
I never met my mother.

1151
01:53:33,897 --> 01:53:36,267
I remember
what my father looked like.

1152
01:53:37,777 --> 01:53:40,607
I'm starting to forget their faces.

1153
01:53:41,987 --> 01:53:43,727
Is that bad?

1154
01:53:53,107 --> 01:53:54,897
Here.

1155
01:54:00,107 --> 01:54:03,887
Sometimes I'm glad they're dead.

1156
01:54:05,147 --> 01:54:06,227
Why?

1157
01:54:08,857 --> 01:54:09,967
Because...

1158
01:54:11,357 --> 01:54:13,727
Because I don't want them to see me.

1159
01:54:15,527 --> 01:54:17,647
I'm so dirty.

1160
01:54:19,527 --> 01:54:20,807
You're not dirty.

1161
01:54:30,147 --> 01:54:31,727
I won't hurt you.

1162
01:54:43,187 --> 01:54:44,517
That's my wife.

1163
01:54:50,557 --> 01:54:52,717
- Missed you.
- Missed you, too.

1164
01:54:55,637 --> 01:54:57,877
Sohrab jan, this is your aunt.

1165
01:55:00,637 --> 01:55:02,377
We've all been waiting for you.

1166
01:55:03,097 --> 01:55:05,667
Ready to meet your new family?

1167
01:55:07,767 --> 01:55:08,957
Let's go.

1168
01:55:18,977 --> 01:55:21,807
Do you like your room?

1169
01:55:37,807 --> 01:55:39,347
You don't look so bad.

1170
01:55:42,977 --> 01:55:44,967
I don't think he's looked at me once.

1171
01:55:47,057 --> 01:55:48,517
Give him time.

1172
01:55:50,017 --> 01:55:52,797
I'm knitting him
a turtleneck sweater for next winter.

1173
01:55:53,137 --> 01:55:55,837
The sweaters they
sell here don't last a month.

1174
01:56:01,637 --> 01:56:02,917
Amir jan.

1175
01:56:03,017 --> 01:56:06,757
You're going to tell me why
you've brought this boy back with you?

1176
01:56:08,977 --> 01:56:10,467
What sort of question is that?

1177
01:56:10,677 --> 01:56:13,297
While you're busy
knitting sweaters, my dear,

1178
01:56:13,427 --> 01:56:16,137
I have to deal with the
community perception of our family.

1179
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:20,637
People will ask why there is
a Hazara boy living with our daughter.

1180
01:56:20,727 --> 01:56:22,297
What do I tell them?

1181
01:56:23,977 --> 01:56:25,347
You can tell them...

1182
01:56:25,517 --> 01:56:26,707
It's all right.

1183
01:56:27,137 --> 01:56:28,517
The General is correct.

1184
01:56:29,017 --> 01:56:30,587
People will ask.

1185
01:56:31,017 --> 01:56:33,257
- Amir?
- It's all right.

1186
01:56:39,387 --> 01:56:41,177
You see, General Sahib,

1187
01:56:42,227 --> 01:56:44,887
my father slept with his servant's wife.

1188
01:56:46,307 --> 01:56:48,837
And she bore him a son named Hassan.

1189
01:56:50,727 --> 01:56:52,347
Hassan is dead now.

1190
01:56:53,097 --> 01:56:56,507
That boy sleeping in the other room
is Hassan's son.

1191
01:56:58,307 --> 01:56:59,797
He's my nephew.

1192
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:03,517
That's what you tell people
when they ask.

1193
01:57:05,517 --> 01:57:07,837
And one more thing, General Sahib.

1194
01:57:08,767 --> 01:57:12,887
You will never again refer to him
as "a Hazara boy" in my presence.

1195
01:57:13,517 --> 01:57:17,677
He has a name, and it's Sohrab.

1196
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:45,677
- It felt so real.
- Thank you.

1197
01:57:45,767 --> 01:57:47,557
My pleasure. Thank you.

1198
01:57:47,637 --> 01:57:49,967
Look. Look at that.

1199
01:57:54,807 --> 01:57:56,387
Excuse me a second.

1200
01:58:02,807 --> 01:58:04,627
I'd like that kite, please.

1201
01:58:05,307 --> 01:58:06,967
And I'll take this spool.

1202
01:58:26,927 --> 01:58:28,337
Do you like the kite?

1203
01:58:34,427 --> 01:58:35,807
Did I ever tell you

1204
01:58:36,977 --> 01:58:38,007
your father

1205
01:58:38,637 --> 01:58:40,797
was the best
kite runner in all Kabul?

1206
01:58:42,727 --> 01:58:45,467
He made all
the neighbourhood kids jealous.

1207
01:58:46,637 --> 01:58:47,967
He'd run the kites

1208
01:58:48,557 --> 01:58:51,387
and never look up at the sky.

1209
01:58:52,267 --> 01:58:53,887
Some claimed

1210
01:58:54,057 --> 01:58:57,087
he was just chasing the kite's shadow.

1211
01:58:57,637 --> 01:59:01,927
But they didn't know him like I did.

1212
01:59:02,767 --> 01:59:05,927
Your father wasn't chasing shadows.

1213
01:59:07,267 --> 01:59:09,087
He just knew.

1214
01:59:10,017 --> 01:59:11,557
That's all.

1215
01:59:17,017 --> 01:59:19,767
Do you want to help me fly this?

1216
01:59:21,097 --> 01:59:22,467
Okay.

1217
01:59:22,677 --> 01:59:24,887
Looks like I have to fly it solo.

1218
01:59:35,977 --> 01:59:37,597
Last chance.

1219
01:59:41,307 --> 01:59:42,547
Here I go.

1220
01:59:52,347 --> 01:59:53,887
It's a good kite, no?

1221
01:59:56,227 --> 01:59:57,717
Do you want to try?

1222
01:59:59,927 --> 02:00:01,127
Here.

1223
02:00:04,137 --> 02:00:05,597
Hold it tight, Sohrab jan.

1224
02:00:06,767 --> 02:00:08,177
Good job, Sohrab.

1225
02:00:20,767 --> 02:00:22,007
Pull, pull, pull!

1226
02:00:34,517 --> 02:00:36,387
Looks like someone wants a fight.

1227
02:00:38,177 --> 02:00:39,677
Are you sure?

1228
02:00:50,177 --> 02:00:52,137
Let's teach him a lesson, no?

1229
02:00:52,517 --> 02:00:54,007
Watch, Sohrab.

1230
02:00:54,307 --> 02:00:57,917
I'm going to show you
one of your father's favourite tricks.

1231
02:00:58,057 --> 02:00:59,597
An old technique.

1232
02:01:00,137 --> 02:01:01,387
Lift and Dive.

1233
02:01:06,347 --> 02:01:07,837
Come.

1234
02:01:12,637 --> 02:01:14,137
Come closer.

1235
02:01:21,977 --> 02:01:23,517
Here he comes!

1236
02:01:24,387 --> 02:01:25,887
We're going to catch him now, right?

1237
02:01:38,807 --> 02:01:40,547
Look, I cut him!

1238
02:01:43,557 --> 02:01:45,297
What are you doing,
you can't hold it right?

1239
02:01:45,387 --> 02:01:46,637
I'm sorry!

1240
02:01:47,057 --> 02:01:48,767
Do you want me to run that kite for you?

1241
02:01:51,347 --> 02:01:53,587
For you, a thousand times over.
