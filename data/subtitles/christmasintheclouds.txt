00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:47,881
Man: You've probably heard

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,550
lots of stories about Indians

5
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,018
riding the plains

6
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,019
in the old days

7
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,487
wearing next to nothing

8
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:54,822
and shooting off arrows.

9
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:56,557
But this story's about

10
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:59,160
nowaday Indians.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,028
(Tires screech)

12
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,896
It happened a few years back.

13
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,232
I had retired as chief

14
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,433
but was still busy

15
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,567
setting a good example

16
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,203
on the res.

17
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,805
(Laughs)

18
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,175
How you doin', boy?

19
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,009
(Chuckles)

20
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,178
**

21
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,179
It was almost Christmas,

22
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:19,947
but it could have been

23
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,014
any time of year

24
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,150
as far as I was concerned,

25
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,018
because my focus was on someone

26
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,787
who lived thousands of Miles

27
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:31,392
away.

28
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,393
We had a penpal exchange

29
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,394
the year before

30
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,562
with our sister bingo

31
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:35,729
on the mohawk res,

32
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,798
and I'd picked a woman...

33
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,467
Christina little hawk...

34
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,169
She'd just been widowed,

35
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,170
poor thing,

36
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,637
and was down in the dumps.

37
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,906
But I found that sending her

38
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,276
two or three wildly flirtatious

39
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:50,344
letters each week did a lot

40
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,345
to cheer her up.

41
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,013
Soon, she was sending

42
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,582
just as many back to me,

43
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,684
with each one better

44
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,653
than the one before.

45
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,955
By then, she was also

46
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,824
dropping hints like crazy about

47
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,958
wanting to come and visit,

48
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,760
but I'd been stallin'.

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,362
Not that I'd stretched

50
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,597
the truth that much

51
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:10,598
with what I'd told her

52
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,599
about myself,

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,933
but she might be expecting

54
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,535
something a bit more impressive

55
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,204
at the airport than some

56
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,638
beat-up old apache.

57
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,374
And so, for the first time

58
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,375
in my life,

59
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,344
I was lusting after luxury.

60
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:25,379
Visions of heated leather

61
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,380
seats,

62
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,381
rear-window defoggers,

63
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,416
and cup holders...

64
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,451
These were the things that

65
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,685
were keeping me up at night.

66
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,622
But this story isn't

67
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:35,623
just about me.

68
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:37,625
No, my son Raymond is the big

69
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,427
success around here.

70
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:41,695
And he went off to one of them

71
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,331
big shot schools back east

72
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,765
and he got a big shot job

73
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,234
with some big shot company

74
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,835
and he married a big shot woman

75
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:48,836
too.

76
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:49,970
But then she ran off

77
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,004
with some other big shot.

78
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,241
So, ray came back here to be

79
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,642
the big shot general manager

80
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,877
of our tribe's new big shot

81
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,547
resort.

82
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,114
Which, if you ask me,

83
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,616
is really how things got

84
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,485
so discombobulated.

85
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,254
Because it wasn't just me

86
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,255
dropping my letter

87
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:08,556
from Christina on his floor

88
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,557
that day.

89
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,025
It was also ray getting that

90
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,261
letter from that other bunch

91
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,262
of big shots.

92
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,530
"Dear sir, this is"

93
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,765
to inform you that some time

94
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:18,899
between December 22nd

95
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,268
"and December 29th..."

96
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:22,403
December 29th.

97
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,837
"A representative from our"

98
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:24,872
organization will be staying

99
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:25,906
at the sky Mountain resort

100
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,675
so that we may review

101
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:28,709
your standards of service

102
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,910
and publish a rating for your

103
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,911
property in the new edition

104
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,179
of the worthington travel guide,

105
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,180
which is published

106
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,181
"every two years."

107
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:35,283
But that's like no warning.

108
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,284
Great, you know,

109
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,285
another cold winter morning.

110
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,286
Hide the women and children

111
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,287
and they're on their way.

112
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,288
Look, Phil,

113
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,656
I understand how you feel,

114
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,158
but you gotta understand, man,

115
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,159
it is very difficult

116
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,194
to get in this book.

117
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,062
Hoo-boy, you're not kidding.

118
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,431
We've been calling

119
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,432
and writing them letters

120
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:52,666
for almost two years now.

121
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,667
So, who's coming?

122
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,668
They don't tell you that.

123
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,069
Why not?

124
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,070
Because if we knew,

125
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,071
then we could... you know...

126
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,072
Put on the dog for them.

127
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,108
And Betty...

128
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,512
How's your staff?

129
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:07,981
Okay.

130
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,182
(Sighs)

131
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,384
Okay, well, good.

132
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,385
Time's a-wastin'.

133
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,554
Let's, uh... let's get to it.

134
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,356
No, I got one other place

135
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,357
to review.

136
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,691
Yeah, that Indian place.

137
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,627
No, no, no, the Indian,

138
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:20,894
like in teepee.

139
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,696
Yeah, well, they say Jane Fonda

140
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:23,697
stayed there all the time,

141
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,566
so I guess that gives them

142
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,600
at least one star.

143
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,835
Like in the commie flag.

144
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,637
(Chuckles) Yeah.

145
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:32,340
Yeah, the day after tomorrow.

146
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,341
Laguardia.

147
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:35,042
Oh, no, you fathead,

148
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,445
I got that bash at the ritz.

149
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,479
Yeah.

150
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,213
No, I... I gotta go to my house

151
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,214
in Denver,

152
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,249
then I'll leave the car there

153
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,451
first and I'll fly out.

154
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:46,554
No, I... I'm not gonna be able

155
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:47,688
to see my daughter this time.

156
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,122
I... yeah, I'll catch up with her

157
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,123
some other time.

158
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,158
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,393
Okay, okay.

160
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,428
Oh! Oh, blow it out your ear!

161
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,664
(Chuckles)

162
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,865
What?

163
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,200
You want a tip?

164
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,369
Here.

165
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,436
Go call the hotline

166
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:03,504
for the half-witted

167
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,805
and report yourself.

168
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,206
Geez.

169
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:09,209
Tip, tip, tip, tip, tip.

170
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:10,578
Woman: "Dear Christina",

171
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,080
your letter came today.

172
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,082
It's been cold here, too,

173
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,384
and I've barely had any

174
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:17,485
time off,

175
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:19,219
but I did get away for a walk

176
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,388
in the mountains last week,

177
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,189
and as I stopped

178
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,391
to admire the view,

179
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,992
and searched for the right words

180
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,259
"to describe it to you..."

181
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,896
I became aware of a bird

182
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:29,930
circling overhead.

183
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,166
A hawk... not a big one,

184
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,267
a smaller one.

185
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,669
"A little hawk."

186
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,037
"Just like you."

187
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:40,641
He knows you're coming.

188
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:41,742
Hey.

189
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,411
Hey.

190
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,412
What's with you, ma?

191
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:46,279
He knows she's coming.

192
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,280
Who?

193
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,281
Her penpal,

194
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,282
that clouds on fire man.

195
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,918
He saw a hawk circling.

196
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,285
A little hawk, like her.

197
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,286
I thought you returned

198
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,422
that ticket, Tina.

199
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,556
I tried, but it was

200
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,557
non-refundable.

201
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,558
Oh, that's just

202
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,559
what they say.

203
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,860
You just need a doctor's excuse.

204
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,028
No, it's okay.

205
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,663
I kinda wanna go anyway.

206
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,764
I thought you were

207
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:04,732
saving your money.

208
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:05,966
He's got a red shirt

209
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,568
and a little warrior animal

210
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,802
that protects him.

211
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,003
A little turtle.

212
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,440
No... a hamster.

213
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,908
He could be a total nutcase.

214
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,109
I don't think so.

215
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,646
Honey, he hasn't even

216
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:19,713
invited you.

217
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,714
Look, I'm gonna be using

218
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,715
my address from Manhattan

219
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,716
and dad's last name.

220
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,717
He's gonna think I'm Italian

221
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,718
and from New York.

222
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,719
He's not even gonna know

223
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,754
it's me.

224
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,755
Oh, yes, he will.

225
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:28,756
He's got the gift.

226
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:29,757
He'll think you're

227
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:30,758
throwing yourself at him.

228
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:31,759
No, he won't.

229
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,760
You don't even know

230
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,761
what he does for a living.

231
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:34,762
Oh, he's in charge

232
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:35,929
of something, that one.

233
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:36,930
(Chuckles)

234
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,931
And how do you know that?

235
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,232
He's got a laser.

236
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,834
Laser printer, grammy.

237
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,470
And he's probably got a wife

238
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,771
and four kids, too.

239
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,972
Well, then I'll find that

240
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:45,973
out.

241
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:46,974
I don't know why you wanna

242
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,108
go out there and make a fool

243
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,109
of yourself.

244
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,110
I'm not gonna make a fool

245
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,111
of myself.

246
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,746
Honey, men usually like

247
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,482
to do the chasing.

248
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:55,483
They're not all like Henry.

249
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,284
Henry was a good man.

250
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:58,652
Yeah, he was a good man,

251
00:06:58,652 --> 00:06:59,653
but he should have carried

252
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,354
life insurance.

253
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,355
I'm sorry, grammy,

254
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,356
I gotta go.

255
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,259
I gotta get back to work.

256
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,400
Welcome.

257
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,504
Hi.

258
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,571
Ray...

259
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,572
(Scoffs)

260
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,674
(Whispers) Be sensitive.

261
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,911
(Inhales deeply)

262
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,245
Ray: He's already dead,

263
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,147
you know.

264
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,148
You're just...

265
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,351
Reorganizing the remains.

266
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,286
I'm perpetuating the cycle.

267
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,855
Earl, you're a chef.

268
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,657
Part of your job is cutting up

269
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,658
and cooking dead animals.

270
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,560
They have dreams, you know.

271
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,561
Just like us.

272
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:41,795
Yeah, I know, I know.

273
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,930
I do, but...

274
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,965
But, you know, that guide book,

275
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,600
if they show up,

276
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,835
and the menu's just vegetarian,

277
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:48,836
well...

278
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,837
You know, then we're gonna lose

279
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:50,871
all the skiers

280
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,939
and the fly fisherman.

281
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,274
I mean, all we're gonna

282
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,275
have left is the people

283
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,276
running around with their copies

284
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,277
of black elk speaks,

285
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,278
having, you know,

286
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,279
four or five visions

287
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,280
every couple of hours.

288
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,650
(Chuckles)

289
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:05,886
Come on, Earl,

290
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,287
you're the only chef we've got.

291
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,157
Look, I don't like this

292
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,158
any more than you do.

293
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,292
We could feed the planet

294
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,293
with all the grain

295
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,294
we feed the cattle.

296
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,295
And people are beginning

297
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,398
to realize that.

298
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,733
But you know what it's like?

299
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,670
It-it's like cappuccino, right?

300
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,737
And espresso.

301
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,405
I mean, they didn't catch on

302
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,406
overnight.

303
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,742
There was, uh... an education

304
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:32,345
process.

305
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,781
It's a consciousness thing,

306
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,148
Earl.

307
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:38,652
It just takes time.

308
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,255
And education.

309
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,225
So...

310
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,663
They're just way too thick.

311
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,664
Well, they're Lenin

312
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:51,665
table cloths.

313
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,666
They're supposed to be thick.

314
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,667
Well, I got two women

315
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:54,668
working on them night and day

316
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,669
and they're still full

317
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,670
of wrinkles.

318
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,671
Well, did you try wettin'

319
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:58,672
'em down?

320
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,673
Well, yeah.

321
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,741
How 'bout that stuff

322
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:01,742
you put in your hair?

323
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,344
(Laughs)

324
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,312
It's a joke.

325
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,313
No, seriously, put 'em

326
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,314
in the freezer.

327
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,315
My grandmother used to do that.

328
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,316
It works like a charm.

329
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,317
What about the kids...

330
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,318
the kids?

331
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,319
I heard that. What kids?

332
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,320
Well, all my girls

333
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,321
have kids, ray,

334
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,322
and school's on break...

335
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,323
no.

336
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,324
And the daycare's...

337
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,325
no.

338
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:19,326
No. I'm sorry, no.

339
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,327
Oh, come on, ray.

340
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,328
We'll keep 'em outta the way.

341
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,329
You won't even see 'em.

342
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,330
Girls, look,

343
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,331
you know I love the kids.

344
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,332
I love 'em with all my heart,

345
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,333
but we cannot do this this week,

346
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,334
and I'm sorry.

347
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,335
Then who's gonna watch 'em?

348
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,336
I can't leave my two little ones

349
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,337
alone all day.

350
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,639
(Sighs)

351
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,973
Well, what about the seniors?

352
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,507
Are you kidding?

353
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,009
They have the Christmas bingo,

354
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,377
they have the bus trip

355
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,378
to the ice rink...

356
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,379
yeah, and they're all

357
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,380
booked up.

358
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,381
Come on, ray.

359
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,382
We'll keep 'em outside

360
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,383
most of the time.

361
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,252
Please?

362
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,253
All right, look...

363
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,855
I'll think about it, all right?

364
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,122
Here's your credit card back.

365
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,523
Thank you.

366
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,093
We have a Christmas Eve party

367
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,094
with Billy trees

368
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,095
and his big band.

369
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,096
Dancing?

370
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,097
Yes.

371
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,098
Excellent.

372
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,099
I would recommend

373
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,100
that you make reservations.

374
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,101
Would you do that for me?

375
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,102
Yes, I will.

376
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,303
Now, you're in room 140.

377
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:04,304
It's a standard suite

378
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,305
with a view of the mountains.

379
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,306
Lovely.

380
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,307
Thank you so much.

381
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:08,341
You're welcome.

382
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,509
(Rings bell)

383
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,644
Nicholas?

384
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,479
140, please.

385
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,816
Can you manage those?

386
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:16,817
Woman on phone: Sky Mountain

387
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:17,818
resort. May I help you?

388
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,286
I'll ring that room.

389
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,255
One moment please.

390
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,731
Oh, my God,

391
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,265
it is so beautiful.

392
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,333
It is amazing.

393
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,635
Thank you so much.

394
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,938
Oh, no, thank you.

395
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,742
Oh, my... oh, my.

396
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:45,078
(Groans)

397
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:47,781
Wonder if there's more

398
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:48,849
like him.

399
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,451
(Strains)

400
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,452
Let's go.

401
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,989
Okay.

402
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,341
Boy: Hey.

403
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,944
(Laughs)

404
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:20,080
Move that side down.

405
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:24,752
No, the other one.

406
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,021
Lindsay fortune

407
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,089
and Buffy love.

408
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,324
I smell a couple of ski bunnies.

409
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:35,062
Brian wescott from Fairbanks,

410
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:38,031
Alaska.

411
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:40,934
The vacuum cleaner salesman.

412
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,837
That's right.

413
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:44,838
I think you're doing

414
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:45,839
the right thing, Tina.

415
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,141
I think Joe clouds on fire

416
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,209
is a good man.

417
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,510
And don't worry about

418
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,511
looking foolish.

419
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,848
When I decided I wanted to be

420
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,849
with your grandfather,

421
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,550
I took the first step, too.

422
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,052
I made him a pair

423
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,053
of moccasins

424
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,255
and put them by his door.

425
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,657
He could've said no,

426
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,894
but that's the chance I took.

427
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,796
And you know he wore

428
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,330
those moccasins until

429
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,832
he wore them out.

430
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,301
(Laughs)

431
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,969
And, every night,

432
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,705
he thanked me

433
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,275
for the courage I had

434
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,813
to make them.

435
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,817
These are the beads

436
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:32,820
from those moccasins.

437
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:38,225
(Speaks native language)

438
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,138
Try to get some sleep

439
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,139
on the plane,

440
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,107
and will you call us

441
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,077
when you get there?

442
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,553
(Turns engine off)

443
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,859
**

444
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,872
Woman: Hey, ed, come on.

445
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:25,906
Boy: What did you make

446
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,876
for dinner?

447
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,779
(Gasps)

448
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,915
But, buffalo thunder,

449
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,782
what will everyone say?

450
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,784
I don't care, Vanessa.

451
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,820
All I want is you.

452
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,156
All that matters is that

453
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,257
we be together...

454
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,227
Forever.

455
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,165
Hey!

456
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,166
Nope, nope, nope, nope!

457
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,167
Give it!

458
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,168
Reading time. It's reading...

459
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,169
Patience.

460
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,971
It's reading time.

461
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,406
"He held her in his arms,"

462
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,542
the cold rain beating

463
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,609
relentlessly down upon

464
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,710
the teepee.

465
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,979
She tried to pull away.

466
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:42,215
'No, please, ' she whispered.

467
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,750
'We can't.'

468
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,452
but his eyes were piercing

469
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,453
through her,

470
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,988
and his desire was as hot and

471
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,422
plain as the fire beside them.

472
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,424
Vanessa knew it was no use.

473
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,193
Buffalo thunder would have

474
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,695
"his way... again."

475
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,397
No, no! No! No!

476
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,431
Gimme that!

477
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,566
You're not getting the book.

478
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,602
Hey.

479
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:16,016
Yep, uh-huh.

480
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:19,052
Yep. That'll work.

481
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,291
(Sighs)

482
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,194
(Children giggle)

483
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,295
Hey!

484
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,296
Hey, hey!

485
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,863
Hey, hey! Hey, no!

486
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,864
What are you doing?

487
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,166
Computer: You've got mail.

488
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,136
Ray: Am I crazy? Hmm?

489
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,005
Is this just some silly idea

490
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,006
that I've come up with?

491
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,073
Because if it is,

492
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,074
please, let's just forget

493
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,075
the whole thing and we can

494
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,076
save ourselves a lot of trouble.

495
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,377
Ray, the hanford's

496
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,378
in this stupid book.

497
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,280
It got two stars, ray.

498
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,281
Two stars.

499
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,282
Geez.

500
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,283
Yeah.

501
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,284
Yeah, the hanford.

502
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,285
I know all about the hanford,

503
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,286
Phil... the big hanford.

504
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,287
Who cares, okay?

505
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,288
You know what?

506
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,289
Let's take our cue

507
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,324
from the hanford.

508
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,325
Okay?

509
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,326
They wouldn't even let us

510
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,327
in there until a couple

511
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:01,394
of years ago.

512
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,395
And so what?

513
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:03,396
So they're big

514
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,397
and they're famous.

515
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,398
Who cares?

516
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,333
I mean, who owns these guys,

517
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,334
anyway?

518
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:10,637
Some multinational corporation?

519
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,506
Our people... our nation

520
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,175
built this place, okay?

521
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,044
We own it and we run it

522
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,746
and I am damn proud of that.

523
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:21,048
But you wanna know something?

524
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,083
There aren't a lot

525
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,084
of paying customers who even

526
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,053
know we exist, you know?

527
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,887
And I am sick and I am tired

528
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:28,921
of watching these tourists

529
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:29,922
just drive by here.

530
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,625
Now, we need this guide book,

531
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,063
like it or not.

532
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,497
And... I dunno.

533
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,831
I dunno, maybe you all think

534
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,832
it's a waste of time

535
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,833
to even try.

536
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,834
I don't know anymore.

537
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,835
But I'm gonna tell you

538
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,836
something.

539
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,972
If we try, if we really

540
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:46,973
put our hearts into it,

541
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,208
I think we can get four stars

542
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,209
in this thing,

543
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,210
and I think we can show

544
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,211
those idiots up at the hanford

545
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,080
that we know something!

546
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,081
Now, come on!

547
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:57,084
Who's with me on this?

548
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,591
I am!

549
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,294
Woman on phone: I'll ring

550
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,295
that room for you.

551
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,097
Please hold.

552
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:13,100
(Whispers)

553
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,271
Hey, ray.

554
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,672
When's that meetin'?

555
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,673
If we botch this job,

556
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,808
the chief is gonna transfer us

557
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:22,809
from the raiding body

558
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:23,810
to the skinning and tanning

559
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,811
pen.

560
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,279
I'm not so sure I wouldn't

561
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,280
like that better.

562
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,381
Never mind.

563
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,382
To capture that wagonload

564
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,383
of guns is gonna take

565
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,684
some real brainpower.

566
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,687
(Mouse squeaks)

567
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:37,990
If you need anything,

568
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,991
you know, just ask any

569
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,992
of the maids, you know...

570
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,229
maybe help to take care

571
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,230
of my kids sometime.

572
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,798
Yeah.

573
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,135
Yee-hee!

574
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,703
Oh... well...

575
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,172
It's down to this one guy.

576
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,406
Stuart O'Malley.

577
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,741
He checks in tomorrow.

578
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,143
Otherwise, that's it.

579
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,510
I mean, all we got are

580
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,011
family and groups this week.

581
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,280
Unless they're gonna chance it

582
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,348
without a reservation.

583
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,150
Yeah, you never know.

584
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,685
(Sighs)

585
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,619
Sorry about that thing

586
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,620
with Phil today.

587
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,590
I wasn't actually reading that

588
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,560
stupid old romance novel.

589
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,429
It was Betty.

590
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,430
She left it at my house,

591
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,431
so I was gonna bring it

592
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,432
back to her,

593
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,433
so naturally, I brought it...

594
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,403
Into work with me...

595
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,174
And I thought I'd give it to her

596
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,241
after I had my sex change

597
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,409
operation.

598
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,677
What do you think?

599
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:31,878
Yeah. Yeah, no,

600
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:33,846
that's a great idea.

601
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,248
(Sighs)

602
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,917
Ray.

603
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:39,452
We're gonna be just fine.

604
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,288
We're gonna be okay.

605
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,223
You gave a great speech,

606
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:46,259
and I think it's gonna snow.

607
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,062
Hey, a bunch of us

608
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,063
are gonna go bowling tonight

609
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,064
over in emerson.

610
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,065
You wanna come along?

611
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,668
Yeah, thanks, but, uh...

612
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,537
I got some work I can do

613
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,538
tonight,

614
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,539
and, uh... you know,

615
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,540
a big day tomorrow, so...

616
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,511
Some other time, all right?

617
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,946
Okay.

618
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:07,980
Hey, mar?

619
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,981
Hmm?

620
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,982
Maybe I can get

621
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,983
the tribal council to help you

622
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,953
out with that operation.

623
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,124
Devil.

624
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:21,093
**

625
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,258
News on TV: Our top story...

626
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,559
The winter of no snow.

627
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,294
It still looks like some other

628
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,495
time of the year out there,

629
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,663
so folks are starting to wonder

630
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,664
if they should trade in

631
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,665
their skis and snowboards

632
00:19:58,665 --> 00:19:59,899
for Mountain bikes.

633
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,401
We haven't had a winter

634
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,469
this late since...

635
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,438
(clicks off)

636
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,378
Mary: Can you take a look

637
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,013
at these?

638
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,047
Sure.

639
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,215
Hey, mar, have you seen

640
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,216
my father yet today?

641
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,451
I think he might

642
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,452
be downstairs.

643
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,422
All right, thanks.

644
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,637
Do you have a reservation?

645
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,339
O'Malley.

646
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,340
Well, I'll have to check

647
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,341
that file.

648
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,342
Just a moment, please.

649
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,376
I'll check.

650
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:46,346
Yeah.

651
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:01,861
(Rings bell)

652
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,566
(Rings bell again)

653
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,469
(Rings bell several times)

654
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:14,240
(Loudly) Oh!

655
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,848
I don't think so.

656
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:23,082
Hey, look.

657
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,985
It's warrior mouse.

658
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:29,956
**

659
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:14,300
(squeaks)

660
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,142
Oh, no.

661
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,011
It got away.

662
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,413
Here, mousey, mousey, mousey.

663
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,416
Here. Here, mousey.

664
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,488
Boy: Aw, let him go.

665
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,424
You probably poisoned him anyway

666
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,525
by putting all that paint

667
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,694
on him.

668
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,069
Mary on phone: I'll ring

669
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,070
that room for you.

670
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,974
Please hold.

671
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,643
Thank you.

672
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,310
Hi, I have a reservation

673
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,114
under the name of Tina pisati.

674
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,051
Fred, uh, isn't it time

675
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,052
for your break?

676
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:06,986
Look at that.

677
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:07,987
What are you doin' here?

678
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:08,988
Get, get, get, get.

679
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:09,989
Hi.

680
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:10,990
Hi. Um, I have a reservation

681
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,459
under Tina pisati.

682
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,461
Pisati. P-i-z?

683
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,463
S... a-t-i.

684
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:19,466
Okay. Mm-hmm.

685
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,270
Hmm.

686
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,972
And you're from?

687
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:27,073
New York.

688
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,042
Really?

689
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,380
I'll just check for manual,

690
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,381
here.

691
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,483
Um, I made the reservation

692
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:37,484
about two weeks ago.

693
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,818
Yeah?

694
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,019
Are you here on, uh,

695
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,756
business, or, uh...

696
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,892
Just vacationing?

697
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:48,628
Um, I'm just vacationing.

698
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:53,900
Well... ooh!

699
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,067
Well, aren't you in luck.

700
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,068
We've just had a cancellation,

701
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,604
and the west Mountain suite

702
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,605
is available.

703
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,839
(Chuckles)

704
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,708
It sounds great,

705
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,075
but I'm on a bit of a limited

706
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,076
budget,

707
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:05,077
and I don't think I can

708
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,078
afford that.

709
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,514
Oh, it's no extra charge.

710
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:08,648
We do it all the time.

711
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,282
Oh. Oh, well, thank you.

712
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,283
You're welcome.

713
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,319
Ben.

714
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,554
Thank you very much.

715
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:18,324
Mm-hmm.

716
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,293
In here.

717
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:45,918
Ray!

718
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,887
It's a woman! It's a woman!

719
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:48,888
She's a woman!

720
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:49,889
The guide book...

721
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:52,058
They sent a woman.

722
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,260
Tina pisan?

723
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,261
Who wants this?

724
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,295
You did.

725
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,830
Tina pisati from New York.

726
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,599
(Sighs)

727
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,967
I asked her if she was here

728
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,034
on business.

729
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,035
She said no.

730
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,036
I know a professional

731
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:05,037
when I see one.

732
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,338
Ooh, and she's good.

733
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,273
How old is she?

734
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,274
I don't know.

735
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,275
Where'd you put her?

736
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,276
West Mountain suite.

737
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,277
Well, she's gonna know

738
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,278
we're on to her.

739
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:13,279
No, no, no. No.

740
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,280
It's okay, really.

741
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,281
I told her we just had

742
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,282
a cancellation.

743
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:17,283
I told her it was normal.

744
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:18,284
Oh... and I'm gonna ask Earl

745
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,285
to make at least two pasta

746
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,286
dishes. How 'bout that?

747
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,287
Why?

748
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,288
Oh, ray.

749
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:24,591
Tina pisati?

750
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,693
From New York?

751
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:27,694
Oh, my God.

752
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:28,728
What?

753
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:32,231
Quick, come on, come on,

754
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:33,232
come on. Come on!

755
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:34,233
What?

756
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,301
It's her.

757
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,603
Are you sure about this?

758
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,104
Bet you 20 bucks.

759
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:40,773
Dark hair. Nice coat.

760
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,274
Wow.

761
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,510
It's a woman.

762
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,645
(Phil chuckles)

763
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:46,846
I wonder if she skis.

764
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,314
No, Phil, she's not

765
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:49,315
a ski bunny.

766
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,316
Oh, come on, ray.

767
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,484
There's a little ski bunny in...

768
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,454
Well, almost every woman.

769
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,391
Hey, Louise.

770
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,426
Hey.

771
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,427
Gonna be ready to turn off

772
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:02,494
the hot water for about

773
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,495
ten minutes,

774
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,496
and I was wondering if there's

775
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,497
anybody in the rooms.

776
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,498
No, they're all out

777
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,433
and about.

778
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,170
(Scoffs) Dog.

779
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,006
Hot water.

780
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:17,243
(Chuckles)

781
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:18,277
We haven't had a winter

782
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,046
this late since 1945.

783
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,148
Meanwhile, the northeast part

784
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,482
of the country is digging out

785
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:24,751
from record high levels

786
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:25,752
of snow.

787
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:26,753
Airports and highways

788
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:27,987
are closed from Chicago

789
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:29,021
to Philadelphia.

790
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,990
In one day, a surprise storm

791
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,058
has dumped as much as

792
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:33,259
three feet of snow across

793
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,260
the eastern seaboard,

794
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,395
closing most major highways

795
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,730
and virtually every airport...

796
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,731
oh, no.

797
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:39,732
Between Boston

798
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:40,733
and Philadelphia.

799
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:41,734
Oh, no.

800
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:42,735
No, come on.

801
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:43,803
Oh, shoot.

802
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:44,804
And laguardia airports

803
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:45,872
are all closed.

804
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,206
Amtrak is even shutting down

805
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:48,207
rail operations...

806
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,208
oh!

807
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,209
Nothing is moving.

808
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,210
All of this has left thousands

809
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,180
of holiday travelers stranded.

810
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,772
Aah! Aah! Aaahh!

811
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,441
What happened to the hot water?!

812
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:24,076
There's no freakin' hot water!

813
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,477
Oh, goodness gracious!

814
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,478
I'm right in the middle

815
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,479
of the shower

816
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,449
and the water turned off!

817
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,188
You don't call this

818
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,456
hot water?

819
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,258
I don't appreciate people

820
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,492
yelling like that

821
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,761
around my daughter.

822
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,930
Do you have kids? Grandkids?

823
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,965
Do you yell at them like that?

824
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:48,868
You got a problem, mister.

825
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,838
A serious problem.

826
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,407
Mary: Tell her we get

827
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:56,408
about a third of our business

828
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,744
from overseas.

829
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:58,745
We'll get into the international

830
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:00,246
edition.

831
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:01,580
Just work it in.

832
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,648
It's 32%.

833
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:03,649
Look, she's not supposed

834
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:06,652
to know we know, okay?

835
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,425
Maybe I should talk to her.

836
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,627
No.

837
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,665
I'll handle this.

838
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,634
Mara: 32%!

839
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,874
Hi.

840
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,876
Hi.

841
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,010
That's a lomahaftewa.

842
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,444
It's incredible.

843
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,413
Yeah, isn't it?

844
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,917
I'm ray clouds on fire.

845
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,887
I'm the general manager here.

846
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,390
You just check in?

847
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,893
Um... yeah.

848
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,095
Yeah, I did... I just checked in.

849
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:50,096
Well, hi.

850
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,097
Hi.

851
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,098
Welcome.

852
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:53,099
Thank you.

853
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,100
(Chuckles)

854
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,101
I'm Tina... pisati.

855
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,668
Oh. (Chuckles)

856
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,669
It's nice to meet you.

857
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,670
Nice meeting you.

858
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,006
So, where are you from?

859
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:01,040
New York.

860
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,108
Wow, you know, we're gettin'

861
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:03,109
a lot of people from

862
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,110
the east coast these days.

863
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,512
And, um... and Europe,

864
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:10,216
and Asia, too, as it turns out.

865
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:11,217
So, you're, uh...

866
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:12,618
You're an art lover.

867
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,153
Yeah. It's a passion of mine.

868
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,555
Yeah, me too.

869
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:18,257
This one's pretty, isn't it?

870
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,826
It's beautiful.

871
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,327
Actually, we have, uh...

872
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:22,929
We have a gallery down the hall,

873
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,096
there.

874
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,364
Oh, you know what?

875
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,365
Listen, I need to take care

876
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,366
of something,

877
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,534
but, uh, let me know if I can

878
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:29,535
do anything for you, okay?

879
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,837
Okay.

880
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:31,838
All right.

881
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:33,505
It was nice to meet you.

882
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,740
Nice to meet you.

883
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,642
Enjoy your stay.

884
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:39,611
I will. Thanks.

885
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,451
TV: Environmental protection

886
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,253
was the order of the day in

887
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,387
emerson with a groundbreaking

888
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,555
ceremony in a new...

889
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:50,556
yeah, we're here to talk

890
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,557
about booze, I guess,

891
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,625
and, uh, I'm an expert,

892
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,626
let me tell you.

893
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,462
I was drinkin' about two quarts

894
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,030
a day when I started seeing

895
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,031
things...

896
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,166
Things that just weren't there,

897
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,800
like this one time,

898
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,602
I thought a family of chipmunks

899
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:04,603
was living with me, man.

900
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,205
I mean, it was crazy.

901
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,206
That's what the alcohol

902
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,207
was doing to me.

903
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,109
And I became friends with 'em.

904
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,277
I was puttin' out food,

905
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:12,344
I was puttin' out water.

906
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,780
Then they started wearing

907
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,882
clothes,

908
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,249
like little suits and dresses.

909
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,151
Halloween costumes.

910
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,220
I mean, these guys rocked,

911
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,221
you know?

912
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,455
And we'd be partying together

913
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,623
and drinkin' and stuff.

914
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:25,724
You know, they were mostly

915
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,959
into beer, but that was cool.

916
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,727
And, um, I mean,

917
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,029
it was fantastic, man.

918
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:33,032
But anyway, um, I knew

919
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,766
chipmunks never wore clothes,

920
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,335
so I had to be seeing things,

921
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,336
right?

922
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,138
But that's when I knew

923
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,973
I had to get help.

924
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,009
I had to stop drinking.

925
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,844
(Applause)

926
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,614
Yeah, and I know there's

927
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:49,648
a lot of you out there

928
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:50,682
who are in denial,

929
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,118
and you all know who you are,

930
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,119
man.

931
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,120
You know who you are.

932
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,321
I'm not gonna mention

933
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,355
any names, you know,

934
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,389
but you know who you are, man,

935
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,390
so you should all clean

936
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,391
yourselves up, man.

937
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,328
Take my advice, all right?

938
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,164
Well, maybe his name is Joe.

939
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,232
Yeah, but it's not like

940
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:09,135
anybody calls me Christina.

941
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,640
No, it wasn't red.

942
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,110
It was a blue shirt.

943
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,111
Yeah, but he actually...

944
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,746
Yeah?

945
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:22,048
No, but he had my letter

946
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,249
in his pocket.

947
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,951
He was a code writer

948
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,285
in world war ii.

949
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,286
Really?

950
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:28,354
Mm-hmm.

951
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:29,588
Transcribed all the messages

952
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:30,656
into our language.

953
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,491
The enemy couldn't break

954
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:33,492
the code.

955
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,294
Oh.

956
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,463
Hello.

957
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,731
I don't mean to stop you,

958
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,100
I'm just admiring how fast

959
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,168
you type.

960
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,169
It's wonderful.

961
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:46,505
And you speak your own language,

962
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,674
too, I hear.

963
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,176
(Sighs) Yeah.

964
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:53,045
I hear okay, too.

965
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,981
My name's mabel,

966
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,782
and I'd love to learn

967
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:57,783
a few native words.

968
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:01,053
How do you say hello?

969
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,788
(Stops typing)

970
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:05,524
(Sighs)

971
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:09,195
(Speaks native language)

972
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:24,710
And how do you say thank you?

973
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,880
(Speaks native language)

974
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,016
(Clears throat)

975
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:32,018
Excuse me.

976
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:34,186
Could you say that again...

977
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,156
Slowly?

978
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,581
(Chuckles)

979
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,551
Yeah.

980
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,227
Three nights of freezing,

981
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,362
and the snow will stick.

982
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:17,663
I've used this machinery before.

983
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,065
Yes, I have.

984
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:20,366
No, this is used machinery,

985
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:21,433
and this price is ridiculous.

986
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,434
I have the invoice

987
00:33:22,434 --> 00:33:23,435
right in front of me.

988
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:24,470
'Scuse me.

989
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,471
'Scuse me just for a second.

990
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:26,472
What are you doing?

991
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:27,706
I need the wrench.

992
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,974
What wrench, dad?

993
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,209
There is no wrench in there.

994
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,210
Yeah, there's a wrench

995
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,211
in there.

996
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:33,212
No, there's not.

997
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,880
Ah!

998
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,583
(Chuckles)

999
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,752
I'll... I'll call you back.

1000
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,753
You ever gonna spring

1001
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,921
for postage there, Romeo?

1002
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,191
Oh, yeah.

1003
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,192
Oh, no, no, no...

1004
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,193
It's... it's complimentary.

1005
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,194
But even normally,

1006
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,195
the package includes everything.

1007
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,229
There's no extra charge.

1008
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:51,263
That's incredible.

1009
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:52,264
Thank you so much.

1010
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:53,265
You're welcome.

1011
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,266
You'll have a great time.

1012
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,367
Uh, listen, Mary,

1013
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,404
I need you to... oh, hi.

1014
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,372
Hi.

1015
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,440
How are you?

1016
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,109
I'm great. How are you?

1017
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,110
I'm fine,

1018
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,278
thank you very much.

1019
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,279
Oh. Mary, I...

1020
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,214
I'm sorry, I was looking

1021
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:09,215
for the, uh...

1022
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:10,216
Mary: Dobson.

1023
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:11,217
Exactly.

1024
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,218
I'm still adding it up.

1025
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,219
I'll get it.

1026
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,220
Okay. Thank you.

1027
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,488
So, are you, uh...

1028
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,489
Are you settling in nicely?

1029
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,490
Yes, thank you.

1030
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,491
I was just being briefed

1031
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,492
on the activities

1032
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,493
that you have here.

1033
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:22,494
Well, there's a lot to do.

1034
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,495
It's a fun place.

1035
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:24,496
Mary: I still need this,

1036
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,497
though.

1037
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,498
Oh, okay.

1038
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:27,533
Thanks very much.

1039
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,534
Mm-hmm.

1040
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,535
Well, listen.

1041
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:30,536
I hope you're enjoying yourself.

1042
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,537
Thanks.

1043
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:32,538
And you let me know if I can

1044
00:34:32,538 --> 00:34:33,672
do anything at all for you.

1045
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,006
I will. Thanks.

1046
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,342
All right.

1047
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,343
It's good to see you.

1048
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:40,312
Good to see you.

1049
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,861
Can I borrow a pen?

1050
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,337
All right.

1051
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:08,707
Give her some gas.

1052
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,677
(Engine sputters)

1053
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,952
(Coughs)

1054
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,388
That's the last damn time

1055
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:23,489
I ever buy an apache!

1056
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,490
Oh, come on, Joe,

1057
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,491
what do you want?

1058
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:26,492
It lasted 30 years.

1059
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,460
Or that cherokee!

1060
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,461
Oh, don't get me started

1061
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,462
with that stupid bingo,

1062
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,198
giving away a cherokee.

1063
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,299
Are you okay?

1064
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,800
Yeah, I'm fine.

1065
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,801
What happened?

1066
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,269
Oh, clouds on fire's

1067
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,471
old truck's... on fire.

1068
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,872
(Explosion)

1069
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,209
So, uh... how was shopping?

1070
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:44,410
It was great.

1071
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,744
How was your day?

1072
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:46,745
Eh, you know.

1073
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,215
Can't complain.

1074
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,283
(Speaks native language)

1075
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:52,484
Oh, yeah.

1076
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,654
Thank you for sharing.

1077
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,922
(Explosion)

1078
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,424
(Chuckles)

1079
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:00,025
So, uh, what nation are you?

1080
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:01,026
I'm a mix.

1081
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,594
Blackfoot, salish,

1082
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,929
ute, and cree.

1083
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,132
Sounds like a law firm.

1084
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,575
What's your name, little girl?

1085
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:25,351
**

1086
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:48,907
I'm just dropping off

1087
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:49,908
some information.

1088
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:51,643
Uh, sure.

1089
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:52,678
Hi.

1090
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:53,745
Hi.

1091
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,347
Thanks, I'd love to.

1092
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:56,848
Oh.

1093
00:36:56,848 --> 00:37:00,319
Oh, great.

1094
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,639
So, what do you recommend?

1095
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,807
You know, the Turkey

1096
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:24,876
is always good.

1097
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,818
This Turkey is so good.

1098
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,487
Is it range-grown?

1099
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,556
Old Edgar here?

1100
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,758
No, no.

1101
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:43,629
He was a pet.

1102
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,232
Or, you know what?

1103
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:48,667
You could try the buffalo.

1104
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:49,668
You know, it's kind of

1105
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:53,238
a local favorite.

1106
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,440
I think it's best probably

1107
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,441
served like, uh, medium...

1108
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:58,043
Medium-rare... "mmr" kind of...

1109
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,546
That's the way we put it down

1110
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:01,547
on our tickets, at least,

1111
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,681
you know, kind of a short...

1112
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:06,251
Short version.

1113
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,419
This particular buffalo

1114
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:08,820
had an onscreen performance

1115
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,357
in the movie dances with wolves.

1116
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:12,758
I don't think he ever

1117
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:13,759
got over it,

1118
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,961
'cause he used to take pictures

1119
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:16,962
with the tourists,

1120
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,764
and let the little kids

1121
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:21,232
ride him.

1122
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,503
We called him... Kevin.

1123
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:33,912
(Sniffs)

1124
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:34,913
Actually, you know what?

1125
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:35,947
The rabbit is actually excellent

1126
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:36,948
as well.

1127
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,149
I mean, really tender.

1128
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,186
I think you'd like that.

1129
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,388
This little bunny wasn't a pet.

1130
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,556
He grew up in the wild.

1131
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,392
I imagine he was quite tame.

1132
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:47,626
It's usually the friendly ones

1133
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:50,696
that get hunted down first.

1134
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,069
No, I don't want it.

1135
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,070
Thank you.

1136
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,040
I don't want it.

1137
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,045
(Laughs)

1138
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,614
So, when the animal has

1139
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:09,881
completely bled to death,

1140
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,617
we rip the flesh from its bones

1141
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:12,918
and marinate it

1142
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:13,985
in a herb seasoning.

1143
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,086
Then it's roasted

1144
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:18,056
in our special ovens.

1145
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,535
Excuse me just for one

1146
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:30,702
moment.

1147
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,672
Sorry.

1148
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,479
You all right, sir?

1149
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:43,449
(Vomits)

1150
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:02,400
Hey, where you been?

1151
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,636
I thought we said 7:30.

1152
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,705
We did?

1153
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,640
Ray, you gotta practice

1154
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,641
a little if you're gonna

1155
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,642
win anything at all.

1156
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:11,810
Oh, man, dad, I'm sorry.

1157
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,911
I totally forgot.

1158
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,912
It's okay.

1159
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:14,913
I got it all set up.

1160
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,682
Listen, I'll call it,

1161
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:17,949
and we'll see how many cards

1162
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:18,950
you can play at once.

1163
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,919
No, no... what I mean is,

1164
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,220
I'm having dinner downstairs,

1165
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,889
and, uh, it's business...

1166
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:26,091
well, when's it over?

1167
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,125
Well, I don't know, exactly.

1168
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,660
Look, it doesn't matter.

1169
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,661
I'm not any good at bingo

1170
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,662
anyway.

1171
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,663
Listen, you just gotta

1172
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,465
practice a little.

1173
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,967
Ray, there are families of ten

1174
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,469
playin' for that jeep,

1175
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,137
and each of 'em is playing

1176
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,872
ten or more cards at a time.

1177
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,474
Well, we can't compete

1178
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:43,975
with that.

1179
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:45,410
Look, if you want a new truck,

1180
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,479
we'll get you one, okay?

1181
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:49,314
I want this one.

1182
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:50,448
Man, I gotta get some

1183
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,819
new clothes.

1184
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:56,722
God...

1185
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:57,989
I'm so sorry.

1186
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:58,990
I'm really embarrassed.

1187
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,458
Took a lot longer

1188
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,459
than I thought it would, and...

1189
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,529
you changed your shirt.

1190
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:06,297
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I did.

1191
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,200
It's red.

1192
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:11,770
Yeah.

1193
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,605
Yeah, it is.

1194
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,575
Are you okay?

1195
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:20,145
Yeah.

1196
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,146
How was your dinner?

1197
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,881
Oh, it was great, thank you.

1198
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,115
Earl, this is Tina.

1199
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:28,286
Au chaunte.

1200
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,320
Oh, you didn't have the Turkey,

1201
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,388
did you?

1202
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,690
No, it was the eggplant.

1203
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,959
I'm... a vegetarian.

1204
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,928
Oh...

1205
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:42,433
Earl, um, don't you have

1206
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,434
a soufflé in the oven

1207
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,337
or something?

1208
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,340
Oh, yes, I do.

1209
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,341
You know,

1210
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,342
before he came back,

1211
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,377
he actually studied in France

1212
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:53,378
for a couple of years.

1213
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:54,379
Oh, did he?

1214
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:55,380
Yeah.

1215
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,381
Well, it was an incredible

1216
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,382
meal.

1217
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:58,383
Thank you.

1218
00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,384
Really? You liked it?

1219
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:00,385
Really. Really.

1220
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,787
I'd give it five stars.

1221
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:03,622
Really?

1222
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:07,458
Wow.

1223
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,594
Puts out a lot of heat,

1224
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:09,661
doesn't it?

1225
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,730
Yeah, that's about 35,000 btus

1226
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,731
you're lookin' at, there.

1227
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,499
We're pretty proud of it.

1228
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,835
We just had it replaced

1229
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,805
back in June, so, uh...

1230
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,009
It must be really difficult

1231
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:25,076
for you when there's not

1232
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:28,279
a lot of snow here.

1233
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,781
Yeah, well...

1234
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,783
You know, technically,

1235
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:34,185
it's the lightest amount of

1236
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:35,520
recorded snowfall by this time

1237
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,823
in about 55 years, but, uh,

1238
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:39,390
what are you gonna do?

1239
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,391
That's life, right?

1240
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,361
Yeah.

1241
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,397
Hey, thanks for dinner.

1242
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,099
I had a really good time.

1243
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,368
So did I.

1244
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:52,237
I appreciate you joining me.

1245
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:54,072
Thank you.

1246
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,306
You're welcome.

1247
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,307
Have a good night.

1248
00:42:56,307 --> 00:43:00,145
Thanks.

1249
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:01,312
Ray?

1250
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,682
Yeah?

1251
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:06,351
So... what do people do

1252
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:09,287
around here on weekends?

1253
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,488
Weekends, weekends...

1254
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:13,792
Well, um, I work... normally.

1255
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,393
Every weekend?

1256
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:16,862
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

1257
00:43:16,862 --> 00:43:18,830
Exciting life, huh?

1258
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,066
Hmm.

1259
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:22,668
Why?

1260
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:25,671
You have something in mind?

1261
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,679
92 degrees year-round.

1262
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,680
What do you think?

1263
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,681
It's lovely.

1264
00:43:35,681 --> 00:43:36,682
(Chuckles)

1265
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:39,685
So... what exactly do you do

1266
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,452
in New York?

1267
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,487
What do you mean, "do"?

1268
00:43:42,487 --> 00:43:43,689
You know, for a living.

1269
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:45,691
Oh, God, don't ask me that.

1270
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:46,858
Why not?

1271
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:49,695
Because I hate my job.

1272
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,697
Oh, come on,

1273
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:52,698
it can't be that bad.

1274
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:55,466
It is.

1275
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,935
(Laughs)

1276
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,469
It most certainly is.

1277
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,571
I just took it because it was

1278
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,707
the only job I could find

1279
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:03,041
and I really needed one.

1280
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,575
But it has absolutely nothing

1281
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,576
to do with what I really

1282
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:09,214
want to do.

1283
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:10,148
What do you really

1284
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,516
want to do?

1285
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:13,584
I wanna teach.

1286
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:14,585
Really?

1287
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:15,620
Yeah.

1288
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,188
I did some subbing last winter.

1289
00:44:17,188 --> 00:44:18,857
I try to do it as often

1290
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:19,858
as I can, but...

1291
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:21,727
It's kinda hard to call in sick.

1292
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:23,228
But I decided that I was gonna

1293
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:24,229
go back to school and get

1294
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:25,731
my teaching credential.

1295
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:26,732
You know, my mom

1296
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:29,500
was a teacher.

1297
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,502
She, uh... she loved it, too.

1298
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,503
She really did.

1299
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,040
She taught third grade.

1300
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,542
Is she retired?

1301
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:38,576
No.

1302
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:39,577
No, actually, uh,

1303
00:44:39,577 --> 00:44:42,180
she passed away a while ago.

1304
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,614
Oh, my God.

1305
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,084
I'm sorry.

1306
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:49,054
It's okay.

1307
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,191
Christina: I'm serious.

1308
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,192
Ray: You are powerless

1309
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,193
against me.

1310
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,194
I'm telling you right now, okay?

1311
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,195
I really can't.

1312
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,196
Try it. Try it.

1313
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,197
I can't.

1314
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,198
Here it comes.

1315
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,033
Into the... ah, psyche.

1316
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,035
(Chuckles)

1317
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,036
My grandfather was legendary

1318
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:06,772
among our people as being

1319
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:07,773
a great hunter and tracker.

1320
00:45:07,773 --> 00:45:09,941
He was called

1321
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:11,376
standing elk shadow

1322
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,779
because he crept up so close

1323
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:14,780
to an elk once

1324
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,681
he was inside its shadow before

1325
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:18,549
it even knew he was there.

1326
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,319
But, uh, one winter,

1327
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:23,221
everyone got sick,

1328
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,623
and he had to go off alone

1329
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:26,624
and hunt.

1330
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:28,026
And he was gone for a really

1331
00:45:28,026 --> 00:45:29,460
long time.

1332
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,461
In fact, everyone thought

1333
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,462
that he was dead,

1334
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,264
and, you know, that they would

1335
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:35,100
die too because he had been

1336
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,201
their only hope.

1337
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,069
But, one night, when the sky

1338
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,470
was lit up kind of like

1339
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,606
it is tonight...

1340
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:43,308
He came back.

1341
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:44,509
He came back with an enormous

1342
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,577
bear that he had killed.

1343
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,279
And everyone ate and they

1344
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,515
got well again.

1345
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:52,650
So, after that, he was called

1346
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,719
the man who came back

1347
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:55,720
with the bear

1348
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,123
when the clouds were on fire.

1349
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:01,392
That's a great story.

1350
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:02,894
Thanks.

1351
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:06,164
I haven't told it in a while.

1352
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:14,105
So, you're the one

1353
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,140
from Greenland, huh?

1354
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,507
Yes, I am.

1355
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,377
Your aunt's Ruth hepaburtz.

1356
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:20,445
Mm-hmm.

1357
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:21,512
She and my mom

1358
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,848
are really good friends.

1359
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:26,551
Good.

1360
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:27,986
Bunny.

1361
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:31,189
Come here.

1362
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,159
Uh-oh.

1363
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:45,670
You're a good artist.

1364
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,974
Well, thank you.

1365
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,508
Is there poison in paint?

1366
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:54,179
That depends on the paint.

1367
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:55,680
You didn't eat paint, did you?

1368
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,015
No.

1369
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,349
Did somebody else?

1370
00:46:58,349 --> 00:46:59,985
No.

1371
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:01,786
Good.

1372
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:03,354
What's your name?

1373
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:04,789
Katie.

1374
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,892
Hello. I'm mabel.

1375
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:08,059
Hello, mabel.

1376
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,660
Do you like to paint, Katie?

1377
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,696
I'm not very good at it.

1378
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:12,898
Well, neither am I,

1379
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:14,900
but you can't let that stop you.

1380
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,134
Would you like to have a go?

1381
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:19,704
Yes.

1382
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,006
Look...

1383
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,440
Here's a nice, clean piece

1384
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,441
of paper.

1385
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,510
And there we've got

1386
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,511
some nice brushes.

1387
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:29,580
You choose one.

1388
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,585
(Phone beeps, dial tone)

1389
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:37,555
(Dialing)

1390
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:43,128
(Phone rings)

1391
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:45,130
(Phone rings)

1392
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,566
Hello?

1393
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:52,170
Hello?

1394
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,140
Hello?

1395
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,049
**

1396
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:07,518
(crying softly)

1397
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:20,966
(Birds chirping)

1398
00:48:20,966 --> 00:48:22,467
I can always tell

1399
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,235
when a big storm is comin'.

1400
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,237
I get real sleepy

1401
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,073
before it hits.

1402
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:30,575
That day was no exception.

1403
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,577
This was the big night.

1404
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,079
That cherokee would be won

1405
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,081
by somebody, and I'd

1406
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:39,050
seen myself driving it.

1407
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,051
But the same event

1408
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,052
that made my getting there

1409
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:42,720
more crucial had also

1410
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,989
made my getting there

1411
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,790
more difficult.

1412
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,293
I had no wheels.

1413
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:50,295
And by the time I woke up,

1414
00:48:50,295 --> 00:48:51,296
I had missed my ride

1415
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:53,198
to the bingo.

1416
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:56,001
It's snowing, it's snowing!

1417
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:57,502
It's here, it's here!

1418
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:58,503
It's here!

1419
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:00,038
Yes! Thank you. It's here.

1420
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:03,074
**

1421
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,044
The big shot

1422
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:09,880
was totally preoccupied.

1423
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,149
Mary had just bought

1424
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:12,483
a new used car

1425
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,818
and didn't want it driven

1426
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:15,320
in the weather.

1427
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,188
And, Phil, he was working up

1428
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,356
to another big date

1429
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:21,192
with the ski bunnies.

1430
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:25,030
**

1431
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:47,585
So, things were looking

1432
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:50,088
kind of grim...

1433
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:52,590
(Door closes)

1434
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,092
Until I caught sight

1435
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:58,563
of stu O'Malley.

1436
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:00,231
Now, after the night before,

1437
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:01,399
he'd been nicknamed

1438
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:02,733
"spew O'Malley."

1439
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,169
(Laughs)

1440
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:06,171
But I'd seen the guy arrive,

1441
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,938
and I knew he was driving

1442
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,107
a big ol' buick

1443
00:50:09,107 --> 00:50:10,275
with some pretty good

1444
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,943
snow tires on it.

1445
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,613
I made my move.

1446
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:19,484
(Exhales)

1447
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:20,485
People who drink

1448
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:21,819
often enjoy gambling,

1449
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:22,987
as well.

1450
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:23,988
I told him

1451
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,491
it was high stakes.

1452
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:27,492
I didn't tell him

1453
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:28,893
it was bingo.

1454
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:32,363
(People chattering)

1455
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,073
Woman: Ante up.

1456
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:47,078
(Chattering continues)

1457
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:48,213
Listen, you sit over here,

1458
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,347
and they'll tell ya what to do.

1459
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:53,017
Okay? I'll be right back.

1460
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:55,186
Woman: Ante up.

1461
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,689
(Chattering continues)

1462
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:01,759
All right.

1463
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,760
Okay, can I have

1464
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,229
your attention?

1465
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:05,230
Thank you.

1466
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,397
How're you all doing?

1467
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,133
Tonight we have a special treat.

1468
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:09,134
He's visiting relatives

1469
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:10,135
not far from here,

1470
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:11,502
and he's kindly agreed

1471
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,503
to join us.

1472
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:13,804
Calling our holiday bingo,

1473
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,340
we have the one,

1474
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,575
the only, wes studi!

1475
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:21,479
(Crowd cheers, applauds)

1476
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:23,914
(Crowd roars, whistles)

1477
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,918
(Chanting)

1478
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,161
It's great to be here!

1479
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:37,162
On my way here, you know,

1480
00:51:37,162 --> 00:51:38,163
I had to stop at a couple

1481
00:51:38,163 --> 00:51:39,597
of places, and everybody

1482
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:41,266
wants to know what it is

1483
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,268
about my outfit here.

1484
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:44,435
(Man laughs)

1485
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,903
It's simple...

1486
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:47,305
My wife dresses me.

1487
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,806
(All laugh)

1488
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:49,807
Any of you guys

1489
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,609
have that problem?

1490
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,877
No? In my case,

1491
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:53,878
it's a little bit

1492
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:54,945
more complicated,

1493
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,814
because my wife is Scottish.

1494
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:58,283
(All laugh)

1495
00:51:58,283 --> 00:51:59,484
But, in any case,

1496
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,651
I think maybe we ought

1497
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,786
to play some bingo.

1498
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:02,920
Are you guys any good

1499
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,021
at bingo?

1500
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,356
(All cheer)

1501
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:06,357
Yeah? Well, then

1502
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,926
let's play some bingo!

1503
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:10,695
Shake those balls!

1504
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:13,198
I'll see you later, spike.

1505
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:15,733
Whoo! Whoo!

1506
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,902
(Woman whistles)

1507
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,905
And...

1508
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:22,407
The first number is...

1509
00:52:22,407 --> 00:52:25,676
N37!

1510
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:28,713
N37!

1511
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:31,549
The second winning number is...

1512
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:36,020
N39!

1513
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,656
N39!

1514
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:44,229
(Exhales)

1515
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,696
Why don't I call room service

1516
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:46,697
and ask them to

1517
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:48,233
send some tea up?

1518
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,700
Great.

1519
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,670
Thank you.

1520
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,375
Are you all right?

1521
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,910
Um... yeah, yeah.

1522
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,413
Um... but there's something

1523
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,482
I have to tell you.

1524
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:06,484
Okay.

1525
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,953
(Sighs softly)

1526
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:12,890
Look, I'm really sorry, but...

1527
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:17,628
But I... I know who you are.

1528
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:19,630
You do?

1529
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,131
(Chuckles)

1530
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,134
Why would you be sorry?

1531
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:26,136
Well... I mean,

1532
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,137
I... I wasn't supposed to know

1533
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,973
who you were, right?

1534
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,007
Right, yeah.

1535
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,008
I was gonna keep it

1536
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:32,009
a secret from you

1537
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:34,111
for about another ten seconds.

1538
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:35,580
(Both chuckle)

1539
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,581
What, you mean

1540
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:37,615
you were gonna tell me?

1541
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:41,586
Of course!

1542
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:44,622
That is strange, isn't it?

1543
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:45,723
Mm-hmm.

1544
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,292
I really...

1545
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:48,559
Really wasn't expecting

1546
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,961
anything like this to happen.

1547
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,930
You know?

1548
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,434
Yeah, me neither.

1549
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,436
I mean...

1550
00:53:58,436 --> 00:54:01,972
I guess I just didn't know...

1551
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,642
What I was supposed to think.

1552
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:08,145
You wanna know what I think?

1553
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:11,048
Yeah.

1554
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:51,789
Yeah, it's lookin'

1555
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,258
pretty bad here, too.

1556
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:56,594
Okay.

1557
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,028
Okay, I understand.

1558
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:02,032
Will be g52!

1559
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,102
G52!

1560
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:07,372
(People chattering)

1561
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:12,977
And the next one is...

1562
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,645
I'm sorry, people.

1563
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,813
That storm's gettin'

1564
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:17,214
really bad out there.

1565
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:18,549
I'm afraid of the roads closing.

1566
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:19,550
This is it.

1567
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:24,154
This is for the cherokee!

1568
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,391
Are we ready...

1569
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:29,093
To play for the cherokee?

1570
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:30,861
Yes?

1571
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,398
And now the first number is...

1572
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:39,036
N42! N42!

1573
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:41,839
And now we have...

1574
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,475
B04!

1575
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:47,445
B04!

1576
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:50,147
G50!

1577
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:51,749
Like I keep telling

1578
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:53,150
my sister-in-law,

1579
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:56,854
"gee, you don't look 50!"

1580
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:57,888
And your next

1581
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,424
big number is...

1582
00:55:59,424 --> 00:56:02,427
G55!

1583
00:56:02,427 --> 00:56:03,928
B? What?

1584
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:07,131
G55!

1585
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:12,637
Now we have o69!

1586
00:56:12,637 --> 00:56:15,440
I18!

1587
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,907
Man: Bingo!

1588
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:18,042
All: Aw!

1589
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,109
We have a bingo over here!

1590
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:21,111
We have a bingo over here.

1591
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,613
Let's verify the card.

1592
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:24,114
Let's verify the card.

1593
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,617
(People cheer, applaud)

1594
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:29,587
**

1595
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:38,128
(people cheering loudly)

1596
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,597
Golly, I never

1597
00:56:39,597 --> 00:56:42,467
even played before!

1598
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:45,870
(Cheering continues)

1599
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:52,643
(Chuckles)

1600
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:55,646
(All laugh)

1601
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:58,115
(All applauding)

1602
00:57:01,486 --> 00:57:04,121
(Camera shutter clicks)

1603
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:06,090
(Engine starts up)

1604
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:20,004
You ever win anything,

1605
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:22,973
I mean, big like this?

1606
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,545
No.

1607
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,046
But I only had one more to go

1608
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:31,549
on at least ten of those cards.

1609
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:33,050
Yeah, me neither.

1610
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,552
I never won a damn thing

1611
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:35,553
before.

1612
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:37,688
(Laughing)

1613
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,990
High stakes.

1614
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,991
(Continues laughing)

1615
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:41,992
You really had me going

1616
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:46,030
on that one.

1617
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,032
What?

1618
00:57:48,032 --> 00:57:49,534
You mad at me?

1619
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:52,537
For winning?

1620
00:57:52,537 --> 00:57:54,539
Huh! Gee.

1621
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:57,141
Talk about a poor sport.

1622
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,142
Yeah, well, just take

1623
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:59,143
the next left up there.

1624
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:02,112
It's a shortcut.

1625
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:09,053
**

1626
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:10,555
(inhales)

1627
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:12,990
So how long can you stay?

1628
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,560
I have to leave on Sunday.

1629
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,027
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1630
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:19,564
That's way too soon.

1631
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:20,565
Don't you have some

1632
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:21,566
vacation time coming

1633
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:22,700
or something like that?

1634
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,703
Mm-mm, no.

1635
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:26,704
I don't think

1636
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:28,706
I can change my ticket.

1637
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:31,208
Why not?

1638
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:34,211
It's a supersaver.

1639
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,212
(Chuckles)

1640
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:37,214
(Chuckles)

1641
00:58:37,214 --> 00:58:41,218
Oh, really...

1642
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:42,219
Of course, I don't know.

1643
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,220
It looks like

1644
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,056
I may be snowed in.

1645
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:48,058
Oh... you're...

1646
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,060
You're definitely snowed in.

1647
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,598
(Chuckles)

1648
00:58:53,598 --> 00:58:55,065
You are very,

1649
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,067
very snowed in.

1650
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,037
**

1651
00:59:12,783 --> 00:59:16,286
(sighs loudly)

1652
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:19,790
**

1653
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,819
(snoring softly)

1654
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:56,393
What?

1655
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,395
Hi.

1656
00:59:58,395 --> 00:59:59,897
Oh...

1657
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:00,898
Hey, there.

1658
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,867
How are you?

1659
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:14,912
I'm good now.

1660
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,381
(Both chuckle)

1661
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,454
(Knock on door)

1662
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,957
That must be breakfast.

1663
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:27,958
Oh!

1664
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,960
(Yawning) Great.

1665
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,930
I'm starving.

1666
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,466
(Gasps)

1667
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,968
No, don't open the door!

1668
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:40,237
Don't open...

1669
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:42,039
what are you doing?

1670
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:43,040
Just don't open it.

1671
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,010
Hold on one sec.

1672
01:00:47,177 --> 01:00:48,178
Okay, open the door.

1673
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:51,148
Open it.

1674
01:00:55,753 --> 01:00:58,756
Hi.

1675
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,725
Thank you.

1676
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,567
Thanks very much.

1677
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,311
Uh, so, uh, what did she do,

1678
01:01:21,311 --> 01:01:22,813
go home for the holidays?

1679
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:23,814
Who?

1680
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:25,850
Your girlfriend.

1681
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,352
What girlfriend?

1682
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,854
What was all this, uh,

1683
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,823
hoopty-doo for?

1684
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:34,859
You don't want anyone

1685
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:35,860
to know you were here

1686
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,861
last night.

1687
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,864
Well, no, I don't.

1688
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:40,865
I mean, really, Tina,

1689
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:42,366
I... I think we should at least

1690
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:43,367
try and keep this separate,

1691
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:44,869
don't you?

1692
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:46,871
What do you mean, separate?

1693
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:48,372
Well, I mean,

1694
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:49,373
you know, otherwise,

1695
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:50,374
it'll look like this

1696
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:53,878
influenced you.

1697
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:55,645
Look...

1698
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:56,646
I've worked really hard

1699
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,648
on this, and I...

1700
01:01:58,648 --> 01:01:59,817
I think that what we have here

1701
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:00,885
is very special.

1702
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:02,787
Well, so do I.

1703
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:04,822
Well, good.

1704
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:06,323
So, uh, you know, just,

1705
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:07,792
uh, make your assessments

1706
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:08,793
based on all the other things,

1707
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,127
and, uh...

1708
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:11,628
And don't be influenced

1709
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,063
by this, okay?

1710
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:16,066
By what?

1711
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:20,404
By this!

1712
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,407
By last night!

1713
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:25,375
(Quietly) I can't...

1714
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,387
Made it alive.

1715
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:40,825
You do have a girlfriend.

1716
01:02:40,825 --> 01:02:42,292
No.

1717
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:44,128
No, I don't.

1718
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:45,129
Then why can't this

1719
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:47,631
influence me?

1720
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:51,969
I mean, come on, Tina.

1721
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,971
Would it normally?

1722
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,140
Well...

1723
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,641
(Chuckles)

1724
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:58,642
God, ray, come on.

1725
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:01,178
This isn't the 19th century.

1726
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:02,179
Yeah, I do think chemistry

1727
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,680
should count for something.

1728
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,249
Well, yeah, so do I,

1729
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:08,252
but, you know, in this case...

1730
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:10,254
What... what is this?

1731
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:11,255
Is this like

1732
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:12,689
a regular thing for you?

1733
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:14,691
Well, no, but...

1734
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:16,693
but it's happened before?

1735
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:20,030
Huh?

1736
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:24,001
It has... hasn't it?

1737
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,637
What is this?

1738
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,139
I don't know.

1739
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,240
Maybe you should tell me.

1740
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,241
Ray, it's not like

1741
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,776
it's gonna count against you.

1742
01:03:32,776 --> 01:03:34,278
But that's just the point.

1743
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:35,279
I mean, it shouldn't

1744
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:36,780
count at all.

1745
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,282
What?

1746
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,449
Look, I think the standards

1747
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:40,617
that I've set here should speak

1748
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:41,618
for themselves.

1749
01:03:41,618 --> 01:03:44,121
What standards?

1750
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:45,622
(Fumbles for words)

1751
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:47,291
This is a first-class resort.

1752
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,126
Yeah, so?

1753
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:50,294
So?

1754
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:51,328
Look, I just want you

1755
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:52,362
to be objective.

1756
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,331
That's all I'm saying, geez.

1757
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,332
(Sighs)

1758
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:57,301
Why?

1759
01:03:57,301 --> 01:04:00,270
(Sighs)

1760
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,241
(Sighs)

1761
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:06,243
Think about my staff here

1762
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,244
for a second, okay?

1763
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:08,245
All right? Now think...

1764
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:09,980
Think about their morale.

1765
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:10,981
Your staff?

1766
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,917
Yeah. (Sighs)

1767
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:13,918
Look, they know

1768
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:15,085
who you are, okay?

1769
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:16,086
You told your staff

1770
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,087
about me?

1771
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:18,088
Well, Mary

1772
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,090
figured it out first.

1773
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,158
Who's Mary?

1774
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:22,559
Oh... I'm sorry.

1775
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,560
She's the woman

1776
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,062
at the front desk.

1777
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:26,230
Oh.

1778
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,432
Well, how'd she know who I was?

1779
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:29,433
Well, you said you were

1780
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:30,667
from New York and all,

1781
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:32,169
so she just put two and two

1782
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:34,338
together, and...

1783
01:04:34,338 --> 01:04:35,339
(Chuckles)

1784
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:36,373
Look, she's my assistant.

1785
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,375
She's really helpful to me.

1786
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,944
Well, how very nice

1787
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:42,947
for ya.

1788
01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:44,381
What'd she do, help you

1789
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,384
write the letters, too?

1790
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,385
Yeah, yeah,

1791
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,653
she wrote some of 'em.

1792
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:51,221
What?

1793
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,222
(Sighs)

1794
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,557
Look, she handles all

1795
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,293
of my correspondence.

1796
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:58,295
Besides, it's...

1797
01:04:58,295 --> 01:05:00,998
It's good for training.

1798
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,832
For what?

1799
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:03,968
Oh, I don't know.

1800
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:08,005
Um... marketing?

1801
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,506
Tina, I can't do everything

1802
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:11,008
around here, okay?

1803
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:12,009
I mean, I have to

1804
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:15,179
delegate some things.

1805
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:23,453
(Scoffs)

1806
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:27,191
Ow!

1807
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,659
(Phone ringing)

1808
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:46,010
Your dad's missin'.

1809
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:47,011
He never made it home

1810
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:49,913
from the bingo last night.

1811
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:55,119

1812

(Groans loudly)

1815
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:21,778
(Snoring continues)

1816
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:22,912
Get off me!

1817
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,414
Get off me, God dammit!

1818
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:27,417
Oh! What...

1819
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,918
What's on my leg?

1820
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,421
On my leg hair...

1821
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:33,923
On the hair! Oh...

1822
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:34,924
I put a splint on it.

1823
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,427
You broke it.

1824
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:38,928
(Sighs)

1825
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,431
Shh. Shh.

1826
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,967
Where are we?

1827
01:06:43,967 --> 01:06:46,636
Oh, now you got to

1828
01:06:46,636 --> 01:06:49,206
the really good news, huh.

1829
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:53,177

1830
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:58,815
(officer sighs)

1831
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:00,317
Well, he hasn't seen him,

1832
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:04,654
but we're gonna keep lookin'.

1833
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:07,624
**

1834
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,102
Officer: He's fine, ray.

1835
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:19,103
They're just snowed in

1836
01:07:19,103 --> 01:07:22,372
somewhere.

1837
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:30,247
God, I can't believe

1838
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:31,281
he treated you like that.

1839
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:32,616
What a jerk.

1840
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,118
Yeah, and I thought he was

1841
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:35,119
writing business letters.

1842
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,120
Yeah.

1843
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,754
He really has a problem.

1844
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:38,755
He doesn't trust women.

1845
01:07:38,755 --> 01:07:39,756
Who could blame him after

1846
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:40,957
what happened with his wife?

1847
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,126
Oh, yeah...

1848
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:43,593
What happened with his wife?

1849
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:44,594
Well, she cheated on him,

1850
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,363
and he caught her red-handed.

1851
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,364
Ugh...

1852
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:48,498
Yeah, you don't know that.

1853
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:49,499
Oh, come on!

1854
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:50,834
Everybody knows that.

1855
01:07:50,834 --> 01:07:52,336
Well, something happened.

1856
01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:53,803
Yeah, something bad.

1857
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:54,804
He's never dated anyone

1858
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:55,805
ever since,

1859
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:57,040
till you came around.

1860
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,041
Yeah, not even that model

1861
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,042
last summer.

1862
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:00,210
Oh, yeah!

1863
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,211
I forgot about her.

1864
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:05,582
I mean, she was really pretty.

1865
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,384

Dad!

1869
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:24,033
They're not in here!

1870
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,034
Okay, ray,

1871
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,035
this is a good sign.

1872
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,036
This means they're well enough

1873
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,037
to go get help.

1874
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,173
Dad!

1875
01:08:29,173 --> 01:08:30,940
Dad!

1878
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,348
You got any kids?

1879
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:41,851
Yeah... one.

1880
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:42,852
How about you?

1881
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,621
Yeah, same here.

1882
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,956
A daughter.

1883
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,958
Any grandkids?

1884
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,494
Two.

1885
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:51,895
I never met 'em yet.

1886
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:52,896
Why not?

1887
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:54,764
Oh... my daughter

1888
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:57,767
married an idiot.

1889
01:08:57,767 --> 01:09:00,770
Seems happy enough with him.

1890
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:03,207
Oh, I... I don't know.

1891
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:05,709
So, she has two kids, huh?

1892
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,977
Yeah, two boys.

1893
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:08,978
(Chuckles)

1894
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,214
I saw 'em the other day,

1895
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:12,216
running around.

1896
01:09:12,216 --> 01:09:14,218
They're pretty cute.

1897
01:09:14,218 --> 01:09:15,685
You saw 'em the other day?

1898
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:17,321
You know, I was thinking,

1899
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,822
my daughter went

1900
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,324
to an Indian camp

1901
01:09:20,324 --> 01:09:21,858
when she was a kid,

1902
01:09:21,858 --> 01:09:23,860
in the summer.

1903
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,362
"Eagle's nest."

1904
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,864
On lake Michigan.

1905
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:31,368
She won a big award one summer.

1906
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:34,871
They gave her a blue feather.

1907
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,874
It was quite an honor.

1908
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:39,376
And only one kid got it

1909
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,545
every summer.

1910
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:42,546
(Chuckles)

1911
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:43,713
Probably sounds like

1912
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:47,717
a bunch of bullshit to you.

1913
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:51,255
(Sighs)

1914
01:09:51,255 --> 01:09:53,257
My son went to camp wakaneeka

1915
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:57,261
at lake Paul.

1916
01:09:57,261 --> 01:10:00,464
He won the white feather.

1917
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,537
It was a pretty big deal, too.

1918
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,038
(Chuckles)

1919
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:13,042
Listen, Katie, I know mice.

1920
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,043
If he didn't like that feather,

1921
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,044
he'd have found a way

1922
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,045
to get rid of it.

1923
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,046
And that glue

1924
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,548
was not poisonous.

1925
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:22,986
Your warrior mouse is just fine.

1926
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,488
Excuse me!

1927
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:25,522
Have you seen a mouse

1928
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:27,190
that looks just like this,

1929
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,758
but it's alive?

1930
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:29,759
No, I haven't.

1931
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:32,529
Did you lose your mouse?

1932
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,030
He's probably in a little

1933
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,532
mouse house somewhere,

1934
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,501
all snuggled in for the night.

1935
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:38,502
Oh, I'm sure he's

1936
01:10:38,502 --> 01:10:39,503
having a little adventure.

1937
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:42,005
Mice are very adventurous.

1938
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:43,507
Why do you look so sad?

1939
01:10:43,507 --> 01:10:45,108
It's Christmas Eve!

1940
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:46,109
We're not gonna get

1941
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:47,977
anything this year.

1942
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:49,479
There's a big party

1943
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:50,847
in the hotel tonight.

1944
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,349
There's gonna be lots of candy

1945
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:55,852
and cookies and hot chocolate.

1946
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:57,387
Would you like to come with me?

1947
01:10:57,387 --> 01:10:58,588
Mmm?

1948
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,589
We'll find you something

1949
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,724
pretty to wear.

1950
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:01,725
Okay.

1951
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:05,729
It's a deal.

1952
01:11:05,729 --> 01:11:06,730
Bye.

1953
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:07,731
Bye-bye.

1954
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:10,700
Bye.

1955
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,509
Ray...

1956
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:20,510
Can I talk to you

1957
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,511
for a minute?

1958
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:23,513
No. No.

1959
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:24,514
Ray, I need to talk...

1960
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,016
look, I said no.

1961
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,051
I'm dealing with something

1962
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,052
that's just a little bit

1963
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:32,021
more important right now, okay?

1964
01:11:35,058 --> 01:11:38,027
All right.

Chelsea, have you seen this?

1983
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,206
Question... how does it work?

1984
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,408
What did you get?

1990

ready for your gifts?

get his gift, please?

aren't we.

Yup.

in a little while.

2027

Why don't you do it now?

2028
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:47,236
Because it's better

2029
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:48,237
to stay warm as long

2030
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:50,573
as you can, cowboy.

stay with the vehicle?

2038
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:03,419
you're supposed to do?

Till it ran out of gas.

2041

2042

a couple gallons, you know.

I-it's okay. You just get

2058
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:03,546
a little more rest, huh.

2059
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:05,614

some help.

01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,062

2072
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,468
I... I want you to do

2073
01:18:25,468 --> 01:18:26,970
something for me.

2074
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,237
I mean, if...

2075
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:30,239
If help doesn't come

2076
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:33,676
in time... I...

2077
01:18:33,676 --> 01:18:35,478
Look...

2078
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,480
You're gonna be fine.

2079
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,982
You know, I think

2080
01:18:38,982 --> 01:18:40,483
you're gonna be fine.

2081
01:18:40,483 --> 01:18:41,484
But, you know, if you have

2082
01:18:41,484 --> 01:18:42,986
some kind of fit a- and die

2083
01:18:42,986 --> 01:18:44,487
before I get back, well,

2084
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:45,989
then I... I promise I'll tell

2085
01:18:45,989 --> 01:18:46,990
your daughter that you

2086
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:48,491
loved her, and the kids, too,

2087
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:50,493
and, uh, that your last regret

2088
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:51,494
was that you didn't

2089
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:52,528
go on in there and visit them

2090
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:53,529
the other day, okay?

2091
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:54,530

No, no.

2093

But that's just exactly

2094
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:58,201
what I'll tell her.

2095
01:18:58,201 --> 01:18:59,202

2096
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:00,203
happens to me, then I

2097
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:01,204
want you to tell my son

2098
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:04,808
that I, uh... I'm real sorry

2099
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:05,809
that I never got to meet

2100
01:19:05,809 --> 01:19:07,811
my grandkids, okay?

2101
01:19:07,811 --> 01:19:08,812
I thought you

2102
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:10,546
didn't have any.

2103
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:12,248
I don't.

2104
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:15,151

2105
01:19:23,726 --> 01:19:26,262
(walela sings the warrior)

2106
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:30,366
* oh, I've been searching

2107
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:34,403
* for my warrior

2108
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:37,406
* I've been walking

2109
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:41,044
* down tracks of time

2110
01:19:41,044 --> 01:19:45,048
* it's such a struggle

2111
01:19:45,048 --> 01:19:48,551
* to seek forgiveness

2112
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:52,355
* like chains and shackles

2113
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:57,660
* these ghosts of mine

2114
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:01,865
* oh, oh, oh

2115
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:08,337
* crossing over heaven's sea

2116
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:10,840
* where my warrior

2117
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:16,112
* is waiting for me

2118
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:23,119
* crossing over heaven's sea

2119
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,355
* where my warrior

2120
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:32,395
* is waiting for me

2121
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:35,364
* LA, LA, LA, LA

2122
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:42,005
* LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA

2123
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:46,876
* feels like I'm dancing...

2124
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:47,877
God!

2125
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:49,913
* truth and wisdom

2126
01:20:49,913 --> 01:20:52,415
* precious rhythm...

2127
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:53,883
Dad.

2128
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:57,020
Yeah. You okay?

2129
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:58,021
(Sighs)

2130
01:20:58,021 --> 01:20:59,555
Can you help me up?

2131
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:01,724
Yeah, uh-huh.

2132
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:04,727
* my heart is humble

2133
01:21:04,727 --> 01:21:09,298
* oh, warrior, show me...

2134
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:12,568
(Both breathing heavily)

2135
01:21:12,568 --> 01:21:15,471
Woman: I see somebody.

2136
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,981
(Groaning)

2137
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:37,060
Are you a doctor?

2138
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,561
Well, yes. I only practice

2139
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,563
part-time these days.

2140
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,565
Oh. Well, he's...

2141
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:43,566
He's been in and out.

2142
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,068
It's really been bad.

2143
01:21:45,068 --> 01:21:46,569
Um, I... I kept him hydrated,

2144
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,071
and I kept the leg still.

2145
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:50,573
You did a really good job.

2146
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:51,574
Mr. O'Malley,

2147
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:53,076
can I call anyone for you?

2148
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:54,577
Any family nearby?

2149
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:55,578
Any friends?

2150
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:56,980
No, just get me

2151
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,247
to the hospital!

2152
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,582
M- my insurance stuff

2153
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:01,084
is in my pocket.

2154
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:03,619
(Groaning)

2155
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:06,189
(Mumbles)

2156
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:07,190
Really?

2157
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:09,192
Leave it with me.

2158
01:22:09,192 --> 01:22:12,861
Psst. You should talk

2159
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,297
to this guy sometime.

2160
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:15,298
He's with some kind

2161
01:22:15,298 --> 01:22:17,800
of a travel agency.

2162
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:21,804
"A worthington guide"?

2163
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:25,308
(Sighs)

2164
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:26,609
What?

2165
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,077
You have to do it again.

2166
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:29,545
Oh, please?

2167
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:31,280
Please, just one more time?

2168
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,781
(Sighs)

2169
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,817
Okay, but this is it.

2170
01:22:34,817 --> 01:22:35,818
(In a deep voice)

2171
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:37,820
It's a good day...

2172
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,822
(chuckles)

2173
01:22:39,822 --> 01:22:42,125
It's a good day to dine.

2174
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:46,629
(Both laugh, applaud)

2175
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,131
I see you had

2176
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:50,133
the tofu tackle.

2177
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:51,600
Lovely choice.

2178
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,102
And may I recommend for dessert

2179
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:55,104
the pine nut pancake with papaya

2180
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,473
and apricot sorbet.

2181
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:02,045
(Chattering)

2182
01:23:02,045 --> 01:23:03,046
Uh, may I recommend

2183
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:04,847
the tahini tamale

2184
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:07,450
or the zucchini cannelloni

2185
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:12,155
or... the Swiss chard lasagna.

2186
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:13,156
Mmm.

2187
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:15,091
Phil, have you seen Tina?

2188
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:16,092
Joe!

2189
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:17,093
Hi, Phil. Hi.

2190
01:23:17,093 --> 01:23:18,094
Hey, Joe.

2191
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:19,095
We've been worried about you.

2192
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:21,597
Hi. I'm okay, I'm okay.

2193
01:23:21,597 --> 01:23:22,598
Mary, have you seen Tina?

2194
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:25,601
Where were you? Huh?

2195
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:26,602
Come here.

2196
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,104
Oh, it's a long story.

2197
01:23:28,104 --> 01:23:29,605
Listen, have you seen Tina?

2198
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:30,606
Why, you wanna break

2199
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:31,940
her heart again?

2200
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,142
(Chuckling) Gee.

2201
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:36,112
(Vacuum hums)

2202
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,186
Betty, have you seen Tina?

2203
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:46,155
No.

2204
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:52,528
Hey!

2205
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,097
That's one of my letters!

2206
01:23:54,097 --> 01:23:55,531
She's your penpal?

2207
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,100
The guidebook woman?

2208
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,101
She's with that

2209
01:23:58,101 --> 01:24:01,003
guidebook, too?

2210
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:07,276
Tina! Tina, listen.

2211
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:08,277
No, wait, really. Listen.

2212
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:09,278
There's been a really,

2213
01:24:09,278 --> 01:24:10,313
really big mix-up.

2214
01:24:10,313 --> 01:24:11,314
I thought... I thought

2215
01:24:11,314 --> 01:24:12,315
that you were somebody else

2216
01:24:12,315 --> 01:24:13,316
and that you were here

2217
01:24:13,316 --> 01:24:14,317
on business.

2218
01:24:14,317 --> 01:24:15,251
It doesn't matter.

2219
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:16,252
Look, the point is...

2220
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,253
The point is that...

2221
01:24:17,253 --> 01:24:19,255
That I didn't write these.

2222
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:22,758
I didn't.

2223
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,760
Then who did?

2224
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,762
(Pants)

2225
01:24:26,762 --> 01:24:29,398
Christina?

2226
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,368
Joe?

2227
01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:34,370
(Chuckles)

2228
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,871
I thought you were

2229
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:38,541
a little older.

2230
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:39,542
I thought you were

2231
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:40,909
a little younger.

2232
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:41,944
It's nice to meet you

2233
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:43,446
anyway.

2234
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:45,448
(Sighs)

2235
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:46,949
(Laughs)

2236
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:48,451
Uh, would you like

2237
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:49,552
a cup of cocoa?

2238
01:24:49,552 --> 01:24:50,553
Yeah.

2239
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:53,722
Yeah? Come on.

2240
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:58,194
Listen...

2241
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:01,164
W-wait... wait a second.

2242
01:25:05,234 --> 01:25:08,704
**

2243
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:35,964
Daddy?

2244
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:45,374
Hi!

2245
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:48,043
Oh, it's good to see you.

2246
01:25:48,043 --> 01:25:50,045
Oh...

2247
01:25:50,045 --> 01:25:51,547
You, too.

2248
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:52,548
I'm glad you had

2249
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:55,050
that old chief call me.

2250
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,552
Oh, yeah.

2251
01:25:56,552 --> 01:25:59,388
He's a good man.

2252
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:02,925
I have missed you.

2253
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:06,262
Me, too. Me, too.

2254
01:26:06,262 --> 01:26:08,764
**

2255
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:11,267
Huh. Your dad

2256
01:26:11,267 --> 01:26:13,269
sure can pick 'em, huh?

2257
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:14,703
(Chuckles)

2258
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:15,704
Strange, though.

2259
01:26:15,704 --> 01:26:16,739
When he used to talk about her,

2260
01:26:16,739 --> 01:26:17,740
I always pictured

2261
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,742
this wrinkled old lady.

2262
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:20,743
I guess that's because

2263
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:22,245
she was a widow.

2264
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:23,246
Mm-hmm.

2265
01:26:23,246 --> 01:26:26,249
Want a chip?

2266
01:26:26,249 --> 01:26:28,251
(Chuckles)

2267
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:31,254
I got work to do.

2268
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:36,759
(Tina laughs)

2269
01:26:36,759 --> 01:26:39,728
**

2270
01:27:03,386 --> 01:27:04,387
Why don't you just

2271
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:05,454
write her another one

2272
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:06,455
of those love letters?

2273
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:07,456
Why don't you

2274
01:27:07,456 --> 01:27:08,457
just go back to work?

2275
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:11,794
(Chuckles)

2276
01:27:11,794 --> 01:27:13,296

2277
01:27:13,296 --> 01:27:15,298
(Conversing quietly)

2278
01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:18,200
Hey, what is this?

2279
01:27:25,608 --> 01:27:28,577
Here. It's yours,

2280
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:32,615
for saving my life.

2281
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:33,616
Uh...

2282
01:27:33,616 --> 01:27:37,920
(Attempts to speak

2283
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:42,525
(native language)

01:27:49,865 --> 01:27:52,901
(Sighs)

2286
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:57,606
(Chuckles)

2287
01:27:57,606 --> 01:28:00,676
Thank you.

2288
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:10,018
(Phone rings in distance)

2289
01:28:14,523 --> 01:28:15,458
(Bell dings)

2290
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:16,459
Mary: Oh, no,

2291
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:17,460
she's leaving.

2292
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,462
(Whispering)

2293
01:28:19,462 --> 01:28:22,431
**

2294
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,622
(clears throat)

2295
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,156
"The pain from his wound"

2296
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,658
was enormous.

2297
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,159
And the dust from the plains

2298
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,160
had kicked up

2299
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,662
to sting his face

2300
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,431
and obscure all vision.

2301
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:56,432
But buffalo thunder

2302
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:57,933
rode like the wind

2303
01:28:57,933 --> 01:28:59,735
after that wagon train.

2304
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:01,236
And soon the pounding

2305
01:29:01,236 --> 01:29:02,738
of his horse's hooves

2306
01:29:02,738 --> 01:29:03,739
became the beating of.

2307
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:04,907
Vanessa's heart,

2308
01:29:04,907 --> 01:29:06,475
willing him closer

2309
01:29:06,475 --> 01:29:08,977
and closer.

2310
01:29:08,977 --> 01:29:10,979
And all her denials were

2311
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:12,981
"but the dust in his eyes."

2312
01:29:12,981 --> 01:29:15,584
(Sniffles)

2313
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:18,587
(Scoffs)

2314
01:29:18,587 --> 01:29:20,088
What is this?

2315
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:21,089
The Indian chapter of

2316
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:24,159
the romance book club?

2317
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,761
Look, I'm busy here, okay?

2318
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:28,797
I got things to do.

2319
01:29:28,797 --> 01:29:29,798
And it's not really

2320
01:29:29,798 --> 01:29:30,799
any of your business,

2321
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:33,436
all right?

2322
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:34,437
(Sighs)

2323
01:29:34,437 --> 01:29:36,004
Just one of those things.

2324
01:29:36,004 --> 01:29:37,005
(Sniffles)

2325
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:39,508
She wants to forget about it...

2326
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:43,479
So do I.

2327
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:44,980
Look, I don't even

2328
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,549
have a car, okay?

2329
01:29:46,549 --> 01:29:51,019
(Keys jingling)

2330
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:52,488
And so he chased her

2331
01:29:52,488 --> 01:29:56,659
to the airport.

2332
01:29:56,659 --> 01:29:57,660
And though he racked

2333
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:58,694
his brain and he searched

2334
01:29:58,694 --> 01:30:00,496
his soul the whole way there,

2335
01:30:00,496 --> 01:30:02,264
ray still didn't know what

2336
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:05,901
he'd say when he saw her...

2337
01:30:05,901 --> 01:30:06,902
Or how she'd react

2338
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,537
when she saw him.

2339
01:30:08,537 --> 01:30:10,405
But as it turned out,

2340
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,406
he didn't have to have

2341
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,407
any kind of speech

2342
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:13,609
rehearsed at all.

2343
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:16,579
**

2344
01:30:22,618 --> 01:30:24,119
Because ray was still

2345
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,454
searching for a space

2346
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:26,455
in that parking lot

2347
01:30:26,455 --> 01:30:28,957
when her flight took off.

2348
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:33,428
(Airplane engine hums)

2349
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:34,930
And so it was not until

2350
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,933
28 letters and 79 phone calls

2351
01:30:37,933 --> 01:30:39,434
and 94 e-mails that

2352
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:40,936
passed between them

2353
01:30:40,936 --> 01:30:45,240
that Tina finally came back.

2354
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,711
**

2355
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:17,072
Of course, stu O'Malley

2356
01:31:17,072 --> 01:31:18,574
only gave us three stars

2357
01:31:18,574 --> 01:31:20,576
in that dumb guidebook,

2358
01:31:20,576 --> 01:31:22,077
which I suspect is more

2359
01:31:22,077 --> 01:31:23,078
to keep the prices down

2360
01:31:23,078 --> 01:31:24,580
and the tourists away,

2361
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,081
because so far,

2362
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,082
he's been back here

2363
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:30,085
four times with his family.

2364
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:34,623
**

2365
01:31:34,623 --> 01:31:36,124
So, anyway,

2366
01:31:36,124 --> 01:31:41,029
that's the story.

2367
01:31:41,029 --> 01:31:43,566
That's how I met mabel.

2368
01:31:43,566 --> 01:31:47,035
