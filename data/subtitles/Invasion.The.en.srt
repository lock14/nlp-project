1
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:27,618
For my daughter MingXia

2
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,961
London, 2:30 PM

3
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,935
Hi, Mom.

4
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:50,434
Hi, dear. I have bad news.
Your dad's prognosis isn't good.

5
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:54,315
You have to come.
-Did he ask you to call?

6
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:56,989
Not in so many words.

7
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,577
We saw each other for
15 minutes last summer.

8
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,165
With his flat, bank account,
insurance, the university...

9
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,458
Your sister's in Australia.
It's too much for me.

10
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:13,288
I'll see if Gaelle can come.

11
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,018
Hi, love.

12
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,774
He's worse?
-I have to be there.

13
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:40,362
I'll come.

14
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:04,677
THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS

15
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,334
The body of Christ.

16
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,025
The body of Christ.

17
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:51,403
The communion's over here.

18
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,284
The body of Christ.

19
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:04,047
How's Mr Desmarais?
-I don't know. I'm not Mr Desmarais.

20
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:07,794
Sorry,
the computer system is a mess.

21
00:04:08,012 --> 00:04:10,505
Constance Lazure.
- My wife Louise.

22
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:12,551
Must be hard having him here.

23
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,520
I threw him out 15 years ago.

24
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:19,056
So whether he's here
or humping co-eds in his condo...

25
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:23,437
Gimme a break. You know it's been
years since I humped a co-ed

26
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:28,813
And Raphaelle Metellus?
-She was Dominique's student.

27
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:33,661
You were her personal tutor?
"Kneel down, open wide."

28
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:40,415
I'd best continue my rounds. Have a good day!
-You too, Sister.

29
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:44,423
I called Sebastien to let him know.

30
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:48,090
You did?
-Aren't you glad?

31
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:51,796
Lovely, we can play his video games.
-He's still young.

32
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:57,305
Ok, but couldn't he have read
one book in his life?

33
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,437
Any  book? Is that asking too much?

34
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:04,309
He may not read, but he earns
more in a month than you in a year.

35
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:15,246
Thanks a lot.
-That's ok, we had room.

36
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:18,872
It's flying to Belfast Monday...
-I'll probably have to stay longer.

37
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,956
My darling!

38
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:29,463
You must be exhausted.
What time is it for you? 2 a.m.?

39
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:33,296
Gaelle, how are you, dear?
-Fine, thank you.

40
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,392
Hello, sir.
-Young man.

41
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:47,525
Do you remember Gaelle?
-Gaelle is unforgettable.

42
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:53,526
How are you?

43
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,704
No private rooms?
-I'm lucky I'm not in the hall.

44
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:08,497
I tried, all I got was voice mail.

45
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:12,874
<i>Dad's very sick.
Please get in touch.</i>

46
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:26,477
What I see isn't encouraging.

47
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:31,232
But to be sure I need a PET scan.

48
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:38,405
See if they can do it.
They can send it by satellite.

49
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:42,914
It stands for
Positron Emission Tomography.

50
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,083
Sherbrooke has one, but
there's a 6-12 month waiting list.

51
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:51,874
Isn't he going to Burlington today?
They have one, -

52
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:56,006
but it's expensive.
$2000 U.S.

53
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,015
Money's no problem.
-You're lucky.

54
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:03,807
You never listened to my body.

55
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:07,930
But I'm not laying a guilt.
-Look, I have to get dressed.

56
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:13,654
An ambulance is taking me to Burlington in 10 minutes.
-No more excuses!

57
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:16,319
For my radiation therapy.
-No!

58
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:21,735
The machines here are too old.
-Stop avoiding me.

59
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,788
This is my son, Sebastien,
he's going with me.

60
00:07:36,135 --> 00:07:40,217
She's a woman I used to know, long ago.

61
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:48,728
I couldn't face coming alone.

62
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:51,396
You've never been here?
-Never.

63
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:54,987
But you see each other regularly.

64
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:59,735
Always on neutral ground.
Usually in restaurants.

65
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:04,163
Did he come to your place?
-Occasionally.

66
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:07,782
But you never came here.

67
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:12,497
No. This was where he
brought his mistresses.

68
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:16,252
With luck, we'll find some panties.

69
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:23,514
I'm glad Sebastien's going with him today.

70
00:08:23,726 --> 00:08:25,802
It's important they talk.

71
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:25,237
"Christmas in the scanner,
Easter 6 feet under."

72
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,581
I have the scan.

73
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,803
IT doesen't look good.
Not good at all.

74
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:53,723
We can't be certain,
but the margin of error is almost nil.

75
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,686
<i>Is he in a lot of pain?</i>

76
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,901
Why don't you bring him here?
At least he wouldn't suffer.

77
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:11,744
<i>We'll make sure of it.</i>

78
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:15,659
I'm sorry, buddy.

79
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:31,843
Baltimore's not far.
7 hours by car, an hour by plane.

80
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:36,557
I won't go into EXiLE.
-Wouldn't you like your own room-

81
00:10:36,856 --> 00:10:41,270
with a bathroom, CDs?
-What CDs?

82
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:45,989
So you can listen to music.
They have that in civilized countries.

83
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:49,070
Know what that costs?
-Nothing. I'll look after it.

84
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,240
I won't know a soul.
-We'll all go tomorrow.

85
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:58,417
No we won't.
I'm not going to the States,

86
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:04,503
I voted for Medicare, I'll accept the consequences.
-Only idiots refuse to change.

87
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:08,301
I want to be with my friends.
-Your friends? Where are they?

88
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:10,138
Dominique's away, but Pierre...

89
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:14,090
You've no one.
Apart from that lunatic this morning.

90
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:16,310
Which lunatic?
-It's irrelevant.

91
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:19,143
The tears, rolling eyes: My Remy!

92
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:22,145
Who's he talking about?
-Marlene Dupire.

93
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:27,231
You didn't sleep with Marlene Dupire?
She's a certified nut, everyone knows!

94
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:31,660
You wrecked your family for her kind?
-I wrecked nothing!

95
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,155
You ruined Mom's life,
my adolescence, Sylvaine's...

96
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:37,331
Blaming me for her failure?

97
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:44,707
She loves the sea, she sails the world,
delivering yachts. Beats a 3rd-rate university.

98
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:48,217
You may be a millionaire,
but you know nothing!

99
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:52,635
I know I won't end up like you!
She's the reason I'm here.

100
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,057
She raised me, not you!

101
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:59,804
Don't you have a plane
to catch to Hong Kong?

102
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:03,684
I don't need you, not for one second!
Go to hell!

103
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:06,897
Fuck you!
-Go to hell!

104
00:13:19,935 --> 00:13:23,186
We're returning to London.
-You can't.

105
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:26,144
We offer him the finest hospital,
he refuses.

106
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:28,814
You heard him. He'll never change.

107
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:33,437
You plan to have kids?
-Definitely.

108
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:37,242
Until you're a parent
you'll never understand.

109
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:40,698
He changed your diapers.

110
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:44,040
He called your teachers every month
all through school.

111
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:47,370
He so wanted you to do well.

112
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:51,376
When you had meningitis at age 3,

113
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:56,379
he rocked you in his arms
for 48 hours non-stop,

114
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,885
without sleep,
to keep death at bay.

115
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,427
You can't remember that.

116
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,351
What should I do?

117
00:14:10,862 --> 00:14:14,989
Find his friends.
Find him a comfortable room.

118
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,525
That shouldn't be hard.

119
00:14:20,955 --> 00:14:26,743
The Ministry forbids changing hospitals.
Anyway, they'd park him in the hall in Emergency.

120
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:30,208
The floor below is empty?
-2 years, now.

121
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:33,542
Could he move there?
-Ice cream with your pie?

122
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,210
You can always ask at Administration.
Good luck!

123
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,095
I'll leave you now.

124
00:14:44,311 --> 00:14:47,976
You're lucky to have such a caring son.
-You think so?

125
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:51,980
How many children come here?

126
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:56,311
Look around! See many children
at their parent's bedside?

127
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,987
I'm here every day, so I know.

128
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:03,401
Was your dad hospitalized?
Did he die there?

129
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:06,417
In the end.
-Did you visit him?

130
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:09,621
He lived in Chicoutimi,
I was in Montreal.

131
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,166
You came from England?

132
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:16,544
London, Chicoutimi, for you...
same thing? Are you becoming confused?

133
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,510
When it's over, press End.
That stops it.

134
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:27,894
It's hard, but if you concentrate,
you'll manage.

135
00:15:29,982 --> 00:15:33,766
<i>Hi, Dad!
See, the Pacific Ocean.</i>

136
00:15:34,403 --> 00:15:37,771
<i>We sail from Sydney
to New Caledonia,</i>

137
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,697
<i>on to Easter Island
and finally Valparaiso.</i>

138
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:48,452
<i>I'm sending you lots of sea air.
They say it's good for your health.</i>

139
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:54,461
<i>I have to go. Satellite connections
cost a fortune.</i>

140
00:15:56,049 --> 00:16:00,129
<i>I'm sending you lots and lots of kisses.
Bye for now!</i>

141
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:53,062
Security badge?
-Ms Pelletier? Lloyd's of London.

142
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:56,150
Didn't they give you one?
-No.

143
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:07,485
Last door on the right.
But next time you need a badge.

144
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:16,292
Hello.
Pauline Joncas-Pelletier.

145
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:18,455
Please have a seat.

146
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:25,173
So you're with Lloyd's of London?

147
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,254
Not at all, I said that to get in.

148
00:17:28,475 --> 00:17:32,720
My father's here.
I'd like to move him to the empty floor.

149
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:36,058
Set up something more comfortable.

150
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,064
That's wonderful!

151
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:45,989
It complies with our awareness
programs involving family members.

152
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:51,112
But unfortunately our allocation
of infrastructure is determined

153
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,696
by the Ministry's ambulatory thrust.

154
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:58,952
It's absolutely impossible to target our
responses in terms of individual beneficiaries.

155
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:03,622
I'm sure our staff...
-I prepared this file.

156
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,800
You must understand, our resource allocation
aims at prioritizing responses

157
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:16,094
according to diagnostic parameters
defined by the Region 02 consultations.

158
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,696
This is silly.
We're not in the Third World.

159
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,654
Think it over.

160
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:36,952
Even if we close our eyes,
we'd require union integration.

161
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:40,121
And that is problematic!
-I'll handle them.

162
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:45,083
This file will be updated weekly.
I'll come back tomorrow. Thank you!

163
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:52,344
There's a room on the empty floor.
It'll take 5 minutes. I just want to show you.

164
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,223
I'll be back in 5.

165
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:02,938
Sorry, take the next one.

166
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,066
I want to set up a room on this floor.
We could...

167
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:15,993
Look, nothing happens
without the union.

168
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:22,913
It starts and ends with the union. Understand?
-I came to you, right?

169
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:30,506
You'd have to paint it,
scrub the floor...

170
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:37,681
Just a sec, man.

171
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:41,105
You're talking overtime, you realize.
And my guys don't. -Paid in cash.

172
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:44,766
Cash?
-Cash. One painter.

173
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:46,777
Two.

174
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,152
Six hours.

175
00:19:49,365 --> 00:19:51,108
Eight.

176
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,401
What's the rate?

177
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,530
$40.
-$35.

178
00:19:56,746 --> 00:20:01,870
I want a bed, curtains, chairs...
-Look, man, we don't do that.

179
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:07,756
You hire a crew, supervise the work.
And charge me a reasonable fee.

180
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:11,168
Reasonable?
-Let's say 25%.

181
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:15,390
Here's $2500 for starters.
We'll settle up every 2 days.

182
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,608
Where's my laptop?

183
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,527
What?
-My computer.

184
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,022
On the floor.
-It's not there.

185
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:35,199
It must be.
-Nothing there.

186
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:39,992
The floor, not the locker.
I'm not crazy. -It's not there.

187
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:42,199
Someone must have taken it.

188
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,042
Who?
-I don't know.

189
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:47,667
I've had 50 emails.
How'll I recover them?

190
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,795
My entire deal with Norway.
There's no backup.

191
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,384
Do you know what I do?
-No. You never told me.

192
00:20:55,597 --> 00:20:58,217
Why bother? You never listen!

193
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,148
<i>There were, what, 3000 dead.
Historically, that's insignificant.</i>

194
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:12,354
<i>As a U.S. example,</i>

195
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:15,027
<i>50,000 died
at the Battle of Gettysburg.</i>

196
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:23,948
<i>What is significant,
as my old prof said,</i>

197
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,706
<i>is they struck at
the heart of the Empire.</i>

198
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:30,708
<i>In previous conflicts- Korea,
Vietnam, the Gulf War</i>

199
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:36,844
<i>the Empire managed to keep the barbarians
outside its gates, its borders</i>

200
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:44,635
<i>In that sense, people may look back on 9/11,
and I stress may,</i>

201
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:49,183
<i>as the beginning
of the great barbarian invasions.</i>

202
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,023
<i>Alain Lussier, thank you.
-My pleasure.</i>

203
00:21:55,906 --> 00:22:02,277
Excuse me, my computer was just stolen.
-Oh yeah? Fill out this form.

204
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,373
What for?
-It's for the police.

205
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,378
Look, I've had all these
since Monday.

206
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:16,257
The police ever investigate?
-No, only when there's physical violence.

207
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:21,510
Last week a woman was raped in the
old laundry room, so they came.

208
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:24,517
Otherwise they'd be here 24/7.

209
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,893
It's easy to rob patients.
They're asleep half the time.

210
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:32,435
And the union protects the employees.

211
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,771
There's not much we can do.

212
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,067
Ronald?

213
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,450
What can I do for you, pal?
-I lost or misplaced my computer.

214
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:55,920
Maybe in my dad's room. So, on the off-chance
someone should find a laptop somewhere...

215
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,547
We'll ask around,
but I can't guarantee anything.

216
00:23:01,806 --> 00:23:05,139
In case.
-Right, in case. We'll check.

217
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:08,009
Thanks, I appreciate it.

218
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:18,436
Hello? Speaking.

219
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:23,815
Of course I remember you, Sebastien.

220
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,324
How are you?

221
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:29,248
Yes, it's been a long time.

222
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,752
He's very sick.

223
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:41,134
And he's all alone,
except for my mother.

224
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:45,462
I knew he was in hospital,
but I didn't realize...

225
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:50,512
I almost never come to Montreal, so...

226
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:56,981
Is he still in hospital?

227
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,941
Pierre, I need you, now.

228
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:04,946
School's starting, we haven't found
a daycare, the kids are sick...

229
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,283
That's life. Always the same.

230
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,789
I'll try to get a flight.

231
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,922
You say that because times
are so terrible.

232
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:22,176
Not especially terrible. Not at all.

233
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,473
Contrary to belief,
the 20th centaury wasn't that bloody.

234
00:24:27,142 --> 00:24:30,224
It's agreed that wars
caused 100 million deaths.

235
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:33,554
Add 10 million
for the Russian gulags.

236
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:37,773
The Chinese camps, we'll never know,
but say 20 million.

237
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,902
So 130, 135 million dead.
Not all that impressive.

238
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:45,234
In the 16th centuary,
the Spanish and the Portuguese managed,

239
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:51,488
without gas chambers or bombs, to slaughter
150 million Indians in Latin America.

240
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,789
With axes!
That's a lot of work, Sister.

241
00:24:56,211 --> 00:25:00,041
Even if they had Church support,
it was an achievement

242
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:04,088
So much so that the Dutch, English,
French and later Americans

243
00:25:04,301 --> 00:25:08,762
followed their lead
and butchered another 50 million.

244
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:11,422
200 million dead in all!

245
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,809
The greatest massacre in history
took place right here.

246
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:18,356
And not the tiniest
Holocaust museum.

247
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:22,853
The history of mankind
is a history of horrors!

248
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,227
They had a trial program with heroin.

249
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:59,934
See if it still exists.

250
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:03,394
Heroin's 800% more effective
than morphine.

251
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,397
It makes a huge difference.
-Ok, thanks.

252
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,068
Get some rest.
-I will, good night.

253
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:59,448
Are you pals with the Premier,
or a hockey star?

254
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:04,787
His son takes care of him.
-I know. And dumbo won't thank him.

255
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,837
My son is an ambitious
and puritanical capitalist.

256
00:27:09,052 --> 00:27:14,555
Whereas I was always a sensual socialist.
-Sensual isn't half of it, Sister.

257
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:18,214
Lewd!- Debauched! -Bestial!
-Lascivious! -Perverse!

258
00:27:18,476 --> 00:27:21,727
How are you, you lusty sinner?
-Better!

259
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:24,857
Give me a kiss, you randy snake!

260
00:27:25,191 --> 00:27:26,815
You're back?
-Yesterday?

261
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:30,193
And Alaska?
-Lovely and cold, like me!

262
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:36,859
You see, Sister? My exquisite daughter-in-law, my
heroic wife, and two most charming mistresses.

263
00:27:37,328 --> 00:27:41,706
I can die in peace.
-You'll burn in the flames of hell.

264
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:49,040
And I won't be alone. They're safe, but given the
depravity of these two, they'll roast alongside me.

265
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:56,597
Whereas you'll play the harp on a cloud

266
00:27:56,807 --> 00:28:00,507
for eternity, seated between John Paul II,
a surly Pole, and Mother Theresa, a slimy Albanian

267
00:28:00,727 --> 00:28:03,598
His illness has affected his brain.

268
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:06,098
No, it's an ethnological truth,
Louise.

269
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:10,313
Albanians are often slimy
and Poles are always surly.

270
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:15,438
"for the misfortunes of Poland
are proof of God's existence!"

271
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:27,498
Hello. I'd like to meet someone, a police
officer or detective in the narcotics squad.

272
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:29,914
Have a seat.

273
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:44,677
<i>Come stai, you big pig?
-What are you doing here, old queer?</i>

274
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:52,227
This is Alessandro.

275
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:54,859
We've heard all about you.

276
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:12,211
Gilles Levac.
My partner, Kim Delgado.

277
00:29:19,263 --> 00:29:21,470
Have a seat.
-Thanks.

278
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:25,394
My father's hospitalized here
in Montreal.

279
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:29,514
He gets rotten care, of course,
and he's in pain.

280
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:33,350
A doctor friend suggested
I get him some heroin.

281
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:39,406
I know little about drugs.
As a student I smoked pot.

282
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:43,193
Drugs are sold in every city,
and the police know where.

283
00:29:43,412 --> 00:29:49,700
I hoped, perhaps naively, you could recommend some
spots where I can find high-quality heroin.

284
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:56,084
That's fascinating, except that...

285
00:29:57,218 --> 00:30:03,967
our job is to arrest dealers,
not help prospective buyers.

286
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:07,224
think of me as a smart guy
trying to save time.

287
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:12,181
Think of me as someone not too dumb
who doesen't want to read a headline:

288
00:30:12,442 --> 00:30:17,601
"Police Help Our Journalist
to Buy Narcotics."

289
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:25,239
I'm no... -She and I don't want to end
our days directing traffic in Chibougamau.

290
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:29,238
I swear I'm not a reporter.
-Why should I believe you?

291
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:34,289
I'm a market operator with MacDougall Deutsch.
It's easy to check.

292
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:38,543
It's easy to print phony cards.

293
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,126
Sorry to disturb you.

294
00:30:41,802 --> 00:30:44,176
I'll have to try the discos.

295
00:30:51,188 --> 00:30:53,514
Look, the Citrouillard family!

296
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:58,069
Claude, I don't believe it!
How are you?

297
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:21,344
Heroin used to be for the rich.
Now prices have dropped and that's changed.

298
00:31:21,594 --> 00:31:27,097
But traditionally it's the
drug of musicians and poets...

299
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:31,643
You mean, ask my friends?
-I don't mean anything.

300
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:36,811
I'm repeating rumors circulated in the media.
-Ok.

301
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,977
What exactly do you do?

302
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:51,279
My dear, I'm the director of the
Canadian University Institute of Rome.

303
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:58,793
What exactly does it do,
the Canadian University Institute of Rome?

304
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:07,678
In fact we're a leading cultural agency that
assists Canadian university students in Rome.

305
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,302
And how many Canadian university
students are there in Rome?

306
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:15,682
In fact, a few.

307
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,440
Why do you ask?

308
00:32:20,694 --> 00:32:24,027
We like to know how our taxes
are being squandered.

309
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:30,158
We're a very modest operation. Naturally
the director requires paid housing...

310
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:34,621
...where you're always welcome,
of course.

311
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:38,877
You haven't been hit by cutbacks?
-Quite impossible.

312
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:44,549
The Institute is buried in the budgetary
quagmire of Foreign Affairs.

313
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:47,428
The Minister himself
has no inkling we exist.

314
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:50,756
Who should I have slept with
to get that job?

315
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:55,967
I'm afraid that people I slept with
would've been blind to your charms,

316
00:32:56,228 --> 00:32:58,600
however abundant they are.

317
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:04,022
Abundance has it fans, dearie.
-Not in Foreign Affairs.

318
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:27,131
This it?

319
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:31,679
Someone found it somewhere?
-That's it.

320
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,439
I have to get heroin for him.
I need someone with contacts.

321
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,725
I've been away too long.

322
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:48,442
The only poweder I sniff now
is Baby's Own.

323
00:33:48,948 --> 00:33:52,399
I could try to ask my daughter.
Remember Nathalie? -Yes, a little.

324
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:56,371
I can't promise anything.
I rarely hear from her.

325
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:12,256
Hi, sweetheart.
It's mom. It's Diane.

326
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:15,297
I miss you, sweetheart.

327
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:21,553
Look,
remember Sebastien, Remy's son?

328
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:24,393
You often played together as kids.

329
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,443
He wants to meet.
He needs some information.

330
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:33,569
So call whenever you like,
at any time.

331
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,075
If you prefer not to talk to me,
I'll leave you his number.

332
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:43,453
We have to hit Costco before 6.
We need a shitload of diapers.

333
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:45,579
Children cost so much.

334
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:48,370
Why do people in the Third World
have so many?

335
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,382
What a dumb thing to say.
-Your poor students, if you teach such crap!

336
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:57,297
Did you get that book I mentioned?
-Which one?

337
00:34:57,515 --> 00:35:00,054
<i>Inner Healing by Swami Rapudanthra.</i>

338
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:05,310
No, unfortunately not.
-I'll bring it. Your body's in your head.

339
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:10,067
Illness starts and ends in the head.
I keep telling Pierre that.

340
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:14,063
Well, we'll be going.
-See you soon.

341
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:26,413
How old is she? It's not about age.
Her breasts outweigh her brain.

342
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,460
Cut it out.
-It's true! The quantity of blood they require

343
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:36,917
drains the brain. It's physiological.
-No wisecracks.

344
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:39,885
She's given me two girls
who've transformed my life.

345
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,887
And a mere brush of her hand
makes me as hard as a bull.

346
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:47,813
Which you'll agree
is a godsend at our age.

347
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,145
Nathalie?

348
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:40,741
I didn't recognize you. Come.

349
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:58,172
Do you work full-time?

350
00:37:00,013 --> 00:37:03,713
What do you do?
-Proofreader.

351
00:37:04,517 --> 00:37:06,760
For a publishing company?

352
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:11,439
Boreal Press.
-So your hours are flexible.

353
00:37:11,774 --> 00:37:16,982
My proposal is that
I pay for your supplies,

354
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:20,357
as well as my father's.

355
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,318
Want brown or white?
-I've no idea.

356
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:31,748
To smoke or shoot up?
-I trust you.

357
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:36,623
You shouldn't.
-Why not?

358
00:37:37,967 --> 00:37:40,256
You should never trust a junkie.

359
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:45,680
They make a habit of lying.

360
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,356
It's right there.

361
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,604
How much?
-$500.

362
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:52,706
It's pretty chilly, huh?

363
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:59,455
That girl's innocent.
She's doing me a favor.

364
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:04,000
Arrest me, but forget her.
-Arrest you?

365
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,676
Think I'm a fool?
-Not at all.

366
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:09,805
You located Olivier in two days.
Nice going.

367
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,466
Olivier?
-The dealer.

368
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:16,636
Why not arrest him?
-Want me to arrest everyone?

369
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:25,114
Recognize him?
-He's Michel Richer, the biologist.

370
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,363
You never bust suppliers?

371
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:32,700
All the time. We work 2,3 years,
bust an Iranian gang.

372
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:36,707
And then Iraqis took their place.

373
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,412
Or the Lebanese, Turks, Italians.

374
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:46,171
There's too much demand.
It's an invasion.

375
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:49,758
What are you doing here?
I mean, now?

376
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:54,761
My job.
-I see.

377
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:57,054
Keeping the peace.

378
00:40:00,691 --> 00:40:03,942
The fish are biting
in Zampino's pond.

379
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:10,325
Time to go fishing.

380
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,484
What did you study?

381
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:16,700
Why do you ask?
-Curious.

382
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,795
criminology, minor in psych.
You?

383
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:25,083
Mathematics, minor in economics.

384
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:30,631
Take care.
-You too.

385
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,923
You don't remember me?
-No.

386
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:38,551
I was close to your mom.

387
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:42,515
You mean you slept with her?
-Not just that.

388
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,188
Were you married?
-Yes.

389
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:50,066
The married ones
never stayed till morning.

390
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:53,236
I'd see them if I woke up at night.

391
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:58,619
From a child's perspective,
it must seem sordid.

392
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:03,914
We called it
sexual liberation.

393
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:08,081
What's that?
-Heroin.

394
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,590
It comes from opium, right?

395
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:13,806
It's morphine mixed with chemicals.

396
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:20,805
Will you inject it?
-We'll start inhaling and then see.

397
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:25,646
It's incredible to...

398
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:30,196
Be quiet now. Try to concentrate.

399
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:35,446
The first time is the best.
It's the one you long for.

400
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:53,172
<i>It's called riding the dragon.</i>

401
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:16,573
Morning.
-Good morning.

402
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:23,529
It smells. Have you been smoking?
-Not on your life. I light a candle and meditate.

403
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:28,501
Where's your IV?
-Dr Levesque had it removed.

404
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,959
Good morning, my doctresses.

405
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:38,507
Take a deep breath.

406
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:41,967
Does it hurt here?
-Oh, yes.

407
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:44,844
And here too?
-There too, yes.

408
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,023
Is it unbearable?
-Goodness, no!

409
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:53,147
You're in high spirits.
-Couldn't be higher!

410
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:56,192
How do you sleep?
-Like a baby.

411
00:42:56,742 --> 00:43:00,028
Then I won't prescribe painkillers.

412
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:03,491
Forget it!
-That's wonderful.

413
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:08,074
I always say, the longer
they stay lucid, the better.

414
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:11,082
I plan to remain lucid till I die.

415
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:15,550
Wonderful, Mr Paranteau.
-Thanks so much, Dr. Dube.

416
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:20,387
I'm not Dr. Dube.
-How fitting, because I'm not Mr. Parenteau.

417
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:28,937
Who's he?

418
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,485
So it all started
with Maria Goretti.

419
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,942
Exactly. The girl who said, No!
-Which one was Maria Goretti?

420
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:40,361
A Portuguese peasant.
-Portuguese? Santa Maria Goretti!

421
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,902
She was Italian?
-From Nettuno.

422
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:47,534
Portugal, that's Fatima, the apparitions,
the Virgin, the shepherds.

423
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:51,706
The secret of Fatima.
-Which only the Pobe could hear.

424
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:56,251
Poor Canada, in 1960.
-Look, we believed it.

425
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,878
So they filmed the edifying life
of Maria Goretti.

426
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,879
Starring?
-I've racked my brains.

427
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,973
Ines Orsini.

428
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:10,227
Of course! The Immortal Ines Orisini!
How could I forget?

429
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,481
I saw it at school in Padua with the Jesuits.
-Me, the Jesuits at Brebeuf.

430
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,687
Me, at the Chicoutimi seminary.

431
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:21,571
For the whole film the
immortal Ines Orsini

432
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,821
is covered from head to toe.

433
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:31,786
But at some point they had to at least suggest
the abject nature of the bestial desire

434
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:34,371
<i>of the vile rapist.</i>

435
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:37,673
<i>So the exquisite Maria dips
her adorable toes into the ocean.</i>

436
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:42,129
<i>With a regal but modest gesture,
she lifts her skirt...</i>

437
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:49,472
The thighs of Ines Orsini!
-Even I remember!

438
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:57,399
Oh, the rivers of sperm I spilled
dreaming of her thighs.

439
00:44:57,654 --> 00:45:02,031
So that explains the rise in the level
of the St. Lawrence River.

440
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:10,905
For years I'd fall asleep with
a hard-on, dreaming of Ines Orsini,

441
00:45:11,124 --> 00:45:14,956
<i>until the day I saw Francoise Hardy
on TV singing All the Boys and Girls.</i>

442
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,419
<i>I was suddenly indifferent to Ines's holy airs.
-Maria Goretti, alone,</i>

443
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:24,008
<i>abandoned - the fate of womanhood</i>

444
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,640
<i>For a long time I slept with
Francoise Hardy. We were very happy.</i>

445
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:35,179
<i>Alas, I discovered Julie Christie in a film.
Our mad affair lasted six months,</i>

446
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,434
<i>till I met Chris Evert,
the tennis champ,</i>

447
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:42,069
<i>whom I left for the sublime Karen Kain</i>

448
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,032
<i>dancing carmen in Marseille.</i>

449
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:01,502
All my life I went to bed
with the world's most gorgeous women.

450
00:46:01,716 --> 00:46:07,505
Then one morning I awoke realizing
I'd fallen asleep dreaming of the Caribbean.

451
00:46:08,681 --> 00:46:12,265
I'd grown old.
Women had deserted my dreams.

452
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,600
It's been so long
since I dreamed of a man.

453
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:34,873
Just what is it you do?

454
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,659
You're president of a Norwegian oil firm.

455
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:44,501
You've bought a North Sea oil field
from a failing U.S. company.

456
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:48,628
You can produce oil for $7 per barrel,
and you sell for $25.

457
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:53,885
But you want to limit your exposure
to fluctuating oil prices. How?

458
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:58,888
No idea.
-You see me, we do a swap.

459
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:03,650
What's that?
-A deal where my bank pays you

460
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:06,020
a set price
and you pay the floating price.

461
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,738
You contract to sell your oil at a set
price for a set period. In short,

462
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:13,404
I manage financial risk.

463
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,704
Are you good at what you do?

464
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,743
Pretty good.

465
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:29,381
Could you get the driver
to stop at the lake?

466
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:34,724
Probably.

467
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:38,642
I'd like to see it again.

468
00:48:19,437 --> 00:48:25,557
At Berkley I did my PhD alongside Locken and
Donaldson, two future Pulitzers.

469
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:30,480
They were no better than me,
but they were American.

470
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:36,244
Me, I came back here, I started
to teach, got married,

471
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,453
And then... then nothing.

472
00:48:38,623 --> 00:48:42,786
Your women kept you too busy.
-That was small time, like you said.

473
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,963
No, what I lacked was extravagance.

474
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:52,792
I went in for pathetic trysts
in poorly heated East End flats.

475
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:59,054
I was replaced by a TA within 48 hours.
The dean neglected to say goodbye.

476
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:03,564
The lowliest secretary
gets a cake for maternity leave.

477
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:17,108
Ladies and gentlemen, for health reasons
I'll be unable to complete this term.

478
00:49:17,451 --> 00:49:20,287
Ms Raphaelle Metellus
will replace me.

479
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:24,870
Does this affect our deadlines?

480
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:28,872
No, deadlines and exam dates
remain unchanged.

481
00:49:29,882 --> 00:49:31,791
Any other questions?

482
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:41,383
Good luck.
-Thanks.

483
00:49:46,314 --> 00:49:52,602
So, as you saw last week, the 1840
election was particularly stormy.

484
00:49:53,029 --> 00:49:55,403
The Whig party,

485
00:49:57,035 --> 00:50:02,455
then newly formed, united four
distinct constituencies

486
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:07,126
First, the National Republicans, followers of
Adams and Clay, the party founders.

487
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:16,816
Irina's home, I have to go out.

488
00:51:34,088 --> 00:51:36,495
Is Nathalie buying for you?

489
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:38,834
She's a friend.

490
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:43,429
If you're a regular,
maybe we should deal directly.

491
00:51:43,849 --> 00:51:46,007
It's only temporary.

492
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,103
Everything in life is temporary.

493
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:54,231
"you can never swim
in the same river twice," said...

494
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:59,568
what's his face? You know...

495
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,576
You can't count on Nathalie.
She'll pull a fast one on you.

496
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:08,911
We'll see.

497
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:12,077
You know where I live.
-Sure.

498
00:52:24,222 --> 00:52:27,638
What are you doing?
-I was waiting for you.

499
00:52:30,311 --> 00:52:34,059
You're always on my mind.
-I know, you've told me.

500
00:52:36,025 --> 00:52:41,446
At night I picture you bleeding
in an alley, in shooting galleries.

501
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:44,906
I'm always so scared.
It's unbearable.

502
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:48,444
You imagine too much.

503
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:52,784
You know this can't go on.

504
00:52:53,126 --> 00:52:58,630
Of course I know.
I know it better than you.

505
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:04,592
I know it's my fault,
that's what's killing me.

506
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,889
That doesn't change anything.
I don't need this.

507
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:25,948
You don't care much
about living, do you?

508
00:53:26,743 --> 00:53:28,698
Not really.

509
00:53:28,911 --> 00:53:33,619
I was like you at your age. Ready to
die at any time. I didn't care.

510
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:37,040
That's why the young people
make the best martyrs.

511
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:40,082
It's paradoxical,
but living grows on you,

512
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:42,967
when you begin to subtract:
I've got 20 years left, 15, 10.

513
00:53:43,176 --> 00:53:47,126
When you realize it's for the last time.

514
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:49,504
I'm buying my last car.

515
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:53,057
This is my last trip
to Genoa, Barcelona...

516
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,265
I won't live that long.
-How do you know?

517
00:53:58,774 --> 00:54:01,525
Overdoses are pretty frequent.

518
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:07,282
But you can never tell. Maybe you'll
kick it and reach a ripe old age.

519
00:54:08,034 --> 00:54:11,866
We can't decipher the past,
how can we know the future?

520
00:54:12,078 --> 00:54:14,950
No one ever knows what'll happen to them.

521
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:17,917
Except me, now. I know.

522
00:54:18,377 --> 00:54:24,546
Are you scared? -Sure am. I don't want to
stop living. I loved life so much.

523
00:54:25,091 --> 00:54:28,257
What was it you loved?
-Everything.

524
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:34,351
Wine, books, music, women,
above all women.

525
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:39,513
Their smell, their mouths,
the feel of their skin.

526
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:42,391
Were there many of them?
-Yes.

527
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:46,738
Don't they begin to seem the same?
-A bit, yes.

528
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:49,610
But I never get tired of them.

529
00:54:49,782 --> 00:54:56,118
Still the great seducer? -No, not anymore.
With age, it's not the same thing.

530
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:59,990
Do you still enjoy wine?

531
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:03,752
Unfortunately  not.
Not with my liver.

532
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,799
The trips you dreamed of,
did you make them?

533
00:55:07,009 --> 00:55:09,679
Nowadays there are tourists everywhere.

534
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:17,635
It's not the present you cling on,
It's your past life.

535
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:22,808
That life is already dead.
-Perhaps.

536
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:24,206
I expected a musty antique dealer,
not a ravishing young lady.

537
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:31,671
I warn you, I'm no specialist.

538
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:36,304
At one time
everyone here was Catholic.

539
00:56:36,597 --> 00:56:39,433
Like in Spain or Ireland.

540
00:56:39,892 --> 00:56:49,691
At a very precise moment in 1966, in fact the
churches suddenly emptied out, in a few months.

541
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,112
A very strange phenomenon
that has yet to be explained.

542
00:56:56,576 --> 00:56:59,910
So now we don't know
what to do with this.

543
00:57:01,205 --> 00:57:07,041
The authorities would like to find
out if it has any value.

544
00:57:10,882 --> 00:57:13,454
Commercial value?
-Yes.

545
00:57:34,196 --> 00:57:38,360
Do you have any 18th-centuary
French cahlices?

546
00:57:38,617 --> 00:57:43,574
The Americans snapped them up.
There are a few examples in the museums.

547
00:57:47,877 --> 00:57:53,749
I'm sure this has great value
for people here, the collective memory.

548
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:02,180
But is there anything that we could sell?
-On the world market?

549
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:09,142
Honestly, I can't imagine it.

550
00:58:09,439 --> 00:58:13,982
In other words,
this is all absolutely worthless.

551
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:19,239
I'll show you out.

552
00:58:27,748 --> 00:58:31,201
Pius XII sitting on his ass
in his gilded Vatican

553
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,500
while Primo Levi was taken
to Auschwitz... That's not sad!

554
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:38,883
It's despicable! Hideous!

555
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:52,813
If what you say true, and history
is a series of abominable crimes,

556
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:57,565
then someone has to exist
who can forgive us.

557
00:58:59,531 --> 00:59:01,405
That's my belief.

558
00:59:02,617 --> 00:59:04,493
I envy you.

559
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,250
If at least I'd written.

560
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:15,583
You wrote nothing?
-A few papers here and there, nothing serious.

561
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,499
What are you doing?

562
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:20,713
What are you doing?
-It bugs me.

563
00:59:22,178 --> 00:59:24,302
What would you have written?

564
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:28,422
<i>The Gulag Archipelago,
The Periodic Table.</i>

565
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:34,555
Really, in that class?
-Never. -So?

566
00:59:35,065 --> 00:59:41,104
At least I'd have left a mark. We need to
succeed, even on our own terms.

567
00:59:41,323 --> 00:59:46,115
To be a able to say we did our best.
It allows us to die at peace.

568
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,576
I'm a total failure.
-At least you realize it.

569
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,286
So many professors are smug,
unbearable.

570
00:59:56,797 --> 01:00:01,920
I don't know your daughter,
but Sebastien's not exactly a failure.

571
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,264
Not thanks to me.
-You don't know that.

572
01:00:10,684 --> 01:00:14,350
We thought we'd pay a visit.
-Everyone wonders how you are.

573
01:00:14,647 --> 01:00:18,311
Not everyone, surely.
-You'd be surprised.

574
01:00:18,693 --> 01:00:22,311
That last day in class
no one seemed very moved.

575
01:00:22,572 --> 01:00:28,077
We had no idea at the time.
-Exactly. Now that you're gone...

576
01:00:28,245 --> 01:00:30,320
We see what we're missing.

577
01:00:30,871 --> 01:00:33,279
I'm touched to hear that. Sincerely.

578
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:40,962
We should be going.

579
01:00:41,174 --> 01:00:45,550
We have a lecture by Mr Roby at 4.
-Off you go.

580
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:49,302
Good luck.
-Thanks.

581
01:00:58,273 --> 01:01:00,480
-Don't give up.
-I won't.

582
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,984
Well I never.
-Surprising.

583
01:01:06,157 --> 01:01:08,528
For illiterates, they're sweet.

584
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,994
It's not their fault.
No one taught them.

585
01:01:23,634 --> 01:01:27,332
At this price we'll come anytime.
-We'll see.

586
01:01:28,261 --> 01:01:29,921
I don't want it.

587
01:01:30,097 --> 01:01:32,339
We agreed.
-No, thanks.

588
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:39,601
Do you want to split hers?

589
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:53,242
We're getting married next summer,
at my parents' in France.

590
01:01:53,453 --> 01:01:56,074
You'll see, the chapel's lovely.

591
01:01:56,916 --> 01:01:58,908
Louise and I married on

592
01:01:59,168 --> 01:02:02,169
a grey February day in a dismal suburb.

593
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:06,168
So we could sleep together
without our families hassling us.

594
01:02:06,382 --> 01:02:09,088
I want a wedding on the Loire.

595
01:02:09,303 --> 01:02:12,173
6 months later I cheated on her.

596
01:02:12,389 --> 01:02:14,430
That was fast.
-Indeed.

597
01:02:20,898 --> 01:02:26,651
When I met Sebastien, I said: With him
it's forever, there'll be no one else.

598
01:02:27,154 --> 01:02:29,776
I hope it lasts, for your sake.

599
01:02:29,989 --> 01:02:34,202
Because, you know, love...
-No, no, no! Not "love."

600
01:02:36,956 --> 01:02:39,791
Mom and Dad
talked like that. "Love."

601
01:02:39,999 --> 01:02:44,046
I love you. I love you too much.
I don't love you.

602
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:48,337
You can't build a life
on pop-song philosophy.

603
01:02:48,551 --> 01:02:52,547
<i>Love Me Tender. Love, Love Me Not.
It's ridiculous.</i>

604
01:02:53,053 --> 01:02:55,806
My parents divorced when I was 3.

605
01:02:56,016 --> 01:03:01,092
For several years Dad continued
to come over for Sunday lunch.

606
01:03:01,688 --> 01:03:05,437
Half an hour before he left,
I'd vanish.

607
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:10,691
I'd be lying on the ground in front
of his car so he couldn't leave.

608
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,450
My kids won't go through that.

609
01:03:19,803 --> 01:03:26,801
So now my nocturnal pleasures are provided by
my giant-screen Toshiba at the foot of my bed.

610
01:03:27,143 --> 01:03:29,220
No more curled-up toes?

611
01:03:29,437 --> 01:03:33,352
That's over. I've seen enough ceilings.
Ei. Olen katsellut kattoa
-For ever?

612
01:03:33,566 --> 01:03:38,477
I've closed the store, laid down my arms,
hung up my skates.

613
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:42,609
Things are much quieter between us too.
-Well, well.

614
01:03:44,078 --> 01:03:47,576
He's in Bologna all week
and I'm in Rome.

615
01:03:47,914 --> 01:03:49,953
There's the weekend, but...

616
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:53,162
My wife falls asleep in bed
with the kids.

617
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:56,379
Great, you can reread Tocqueville.

618
01:03:56,589 --> 01:03:59,591
That's what I did.
2000 pages on bible paper.

619
01:03:59,758 --> 01:04:04,137
He's increasingly cultivated,
and his prostate increasingly swollen.

620
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:07,927
Sorry, I still enjoy it a lot.

621
01:04:08,894 --> 01:04:11,265
In the country
there's an old cowboy I...

622
01:04:18,362 --> 01:04:20,816
Cowboy? You're with a cowboy now?

623
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:25,027
Yes. There's an old cowboy
I invite over to shake my bush.

624
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:29,988
To shae your bush!
-Yes, but we had a fight.

625
01:04:30,332 --> 01:04:35,243
I'll never understand men.
All my life I date cads

626
01:04:35,462 --> 01:04:39,376
who thought only of escaping
after satisfying their base needs.

627
01:04:39,592 --> 01:04:43,540
The other day, as a compliment,
I said to my cowboy:

628
01:04:43,886 --> 01:04:50,505
To think we can still have sexual flings at our age.
He was incensed. He doesn't want to be a sex object,

629
01:04:50,726 --> 01:04:54,558
talks about his masculinity.
-We love that!

630
01:04:54,771 --> 01:05:00,443
Invokes father hunger goes on about exploring
his feminine side, his inner me.

631
01:05:00,695 --> 01:05:03,103
It was unbearable.

632
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:07,065
The last thing I want is
a limp-dicked sentimentalist.

633
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,362
I want to be screwed forcefully.
That's all.

634
01:05:10,537 --> 01:05:14,406
I'm sensitive
and smart enough for two.

635
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:16,332
A rub-down?

636
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:20,872
Would he like a rub-down? Does the
Muslim need to bow towards Mecca?

637
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:24,086
Does the Carmelite
long for the Holy Species?

638
01:05:25,386 --> 01:05:29,466
Is this your first time here?
-Yes...

639
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:33,549
I don't know if you believe
in random acts of kindness,

640
01:05:33,853 --> 01:05:37,850
but if you do,
render this sick man happy.

641
01:05:38,065 --> 01:05:40,308
Give him the mother
of all rub-downs.

642
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:45,608
You will be repaid a hundredfold
in this life or another.

643
01:06:08,929 --> 01:06:11,219
Am I in heaven already?

644
01:06:11,682 --> 01:06:15,051
Are you my Valkyrie, my houri?

645
01:06:20,357 --> 01:06:22,018
Oh joy!

646
01:06:48,969 --> 01:06:51,008
Nathalie didn't show.

647
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:56,051
It's bad.
Your father's in withdrawal.

648
01:07:07,612 --> 01:07:10,482
Know where Nathalie is?
-No idea.

649
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:13,859
She's disappeared.
-I warned you.

650
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,906
I may come back.
-Before 11.

651
01:07:27,675 --> 01:07:30,212
I'm not supposed to do this.

652
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,949
You were right.
You said not to trust you.

653
01:07:57,455 --> 01:07:59,825
Your dealer said that too.

654
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,411
Wake up. We've a contract.

655
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:07,244
What contract?
-I buy the dope, you look after Dad.

656
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:11,256
What's with him?
-He's waiting.

657
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:13,548
We're coming.

658
01:08:14,053 --> 01:08:16,260
You honor a contract!

659
01:08:16,473 --> 01:08:22,262
That's heavy, man.
-We had a deal. I'm counting on you.

660
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:26,851
At the market... my dad...
Y'know, my dad...

661
01:08:27,567 --> 01:08:32,987
Want to trade dads?
Me, I made my life.

662
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:39,162
Perfect young man.

663
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:42,071
Perfect career.

664
01:08:42,498 --> 01:08:45,582
Perfect fiancee.

665
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:53,043
I'm imperfect. It's sad.
It's very sad.

666
01:08:53,301 --> 01:08:57,249
Where have you been?
I didn't know what to do.

667
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:59,510
Get a spoon.
-What?

668
01:08:59,972 --> 01:09:01,848
A spoon.

669
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:06,312
Fill it to thirty.

670
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:13,980
I can't manage.

671
01:09:19,744 --> 01:09:22,661
What is this?
-Don't ask, we don't have time.

672
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:30,082
You have to help. I beg you. Give him this.
He needs it. Please, I'll explain later.

673
01:09:31,004 --> 01:09:33,377
What's in it?
-Heroin.

674
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:35,751
I beg you.

675
01:09:40,348 --> 01:09:43,349
Shut the door, at least.
-I'm going.

676
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:58,560
Just this once.
-It'll soon be over.

677
01:10:00,826 --> 01:10:02,819
Better?

678
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,041
We sat on your pier. He was never
happier than at the lake.

679
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:17,333
So could we borrow the cottage?
-Of course, I'll get the key.

680
01:10:20,427 --> 01:10:22,967
What is it?
-The keys to the cottage.

681
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:28,675
What for? -I'm letting Sebastien use it.
He wants to take Remy.

682
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:33,476
Without asking me?
-I'm truly sorry.

683
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:36,480
I'm the one who decorated it.
-That's true.

684
01:10:36,738 --> 01:10:39,866
The hours at Ikea,
don't they count.

685
01:10:39,866 --> 01:10:45,205
Or the curtains I sewed? You lend our
house to strangers without asking!

686
01:10:45,414 --> 01:10:47,653
Remy's not a stranger.

687
01:10:48,206 --> 01:10:50,875
That's why Nicole
divorced Tom Cruise!

688
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:53,996
He'd lend their Colorado home
to anybody.

689
01:10:54,212 --> 01:10:59,456
I'm lending my house
to my friend Reamy, and you shut up.

690
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:05,764
If that's how it is, I won't stay another
second. I'm taking the girls and moving out.

691
01:11:07,852 --> 01:11:10,010
I'm sorry. Forget it, we'll manage.

692
01:11:10,188 --> 01:11:13,473
No way. Use it whenever you like.

693
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:20,817
Don't worry. It's always this way.
That's life. -Thanks.

694
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:29,696
No news from Sylvaine?

695
01:11:29,956 --> 01:11:33,326
No, I even called
the boat's owned in Chile.

696
01:11:33,627 --> 01:11:37,791
I hope she's ok.
-She is, it's just the Net uplink.

697
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:40,087
The Pacific's big.

698
01:11:47,514 --> 01:11:49,590
Goodbye.

699
01:11:55,023 --> 01:12:00,147
Embrace the mystery
and you'll be saved.

700
01:12:15,543 --> 01:12:18,035
Say you love him.

701
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:23,754
Tell him, and touch him.

702
01:12:25,929 --> 01:12:29,429
Drink this one.
-Right now?

703
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:32,809
Here. Methadone's serious.

704
01:12:44,405 --> 01:12:49,399
Now I trust you.
-Drink one a day.

705
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:52,781
Only one. No more, no less.
Come back on Monday.

706
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,159
If you screw up,
you're out of the program.

707
01:13:11,432 --> 01:13:15,975
I still can't come to terms with it.
-You know you have to.

708
01:13:17,646 --> 01:13:19,971
I can't accept it.

709
01:13:23,152 --> 01:13:25,359
That's how it is. It's a law.

710
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:27,982
The very instant you shut your eyes,

711
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:31,034
millions more will also die.

712
01:13:31,244 --> 01:13:36,237
<i>But I won't be here anymore. Me.
I'll be gone for good.</i>

713
01:13:44,547 --> 01:13:47,299
If at least I'd learned something.

714
01:13:53,432 --> 01:13:56,517
I feel as helpless
as the day I was born.

715
01:13:57,479 --> 01:14:00,349
I haven't found a meaning. It's

716
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:03,145
I have to search.

717
01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:10,112
I have to keep searching.

718
01:14:22,586 --> 01:14:24,627
We've been everything.

719
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:29,791
Separatists, independantists,
sovereignists, sovereignty-associationists.

720
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:32,761
At first we were existentialists.

721
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:35,261
We read Sartre and Camus.

722
01:14:35,474 --> 01:14:38,225
Then Fanon,
we became anti-colonialists.

723
01:14:38,477 --> 01:14:42,141
We read Marcuse and became Marxists.
-Marxist-Leninists.

724
01:14:42,356 --> 01:14:44,229
Trotskyists.
-Maoists.

725
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:48,107
After Solzhenitsyn we changed.
We were structuralists.

726
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:50,728
Situationists.
-Feminists.

727
01:14:50,948 --> 01:14:54,779
Demonstructionists.
-Is there an "ism" we haven't worshipped.

728
01:14:54,952 --> 01:14:58,900
Cretinism.
-God no. Think of Guo Jing.

729
01:14:59,121 --> 01:15:03,451
Who was he? -An archeologist
with a skirt slit to the crotch.

730
01:15:03,668 --> 01:15:08,829
Even you remember. -In the 70s,
China opens up to the West.

731
01:15:09,217 --> 01:15:16,346
She comes on a cultural exchange. The
university sends its trusty radical, me...

732
01:15:17,016 --> 01:15:22,638
I enter the dining room of her hotel.
I spot her, and die.

733
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:31,611
<i>Beauty that could melt Emperor Qin's
7000 terra cotta warriors.</i>

734
01:15:31,822 --> 01:15:33,945
<i>I order tea, we make small talk.</i>

735
01:15:34,616 --> 01:15:39,158
I can see us doing Pekinese lotus.
-The Szechuan dragon.

736
01:15:39,955 --> 01:15:43,122
<i>To make myself appear intresting,</i>

737
01:15:43,376 --> 01:15:46,709
I dive in: "Your country has achieved so much.

738
01:15:47,046 --> 01:15:51,588
We're so envious. Your
Cultural Revolution is wonderful!"

739
01:15:54,135 --> 01:15:58,429
Her lovely black eyes glaze over.

740
01:15:58,931 --> 01:16:02,976
I'm mortified to realize
that she's thinking,

741
01:16:03,144 --> 01:16:07,771
"He's either a CIA agent
or the worst cretin in the West."

742
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:10,521
So much for the lotus and dragon.

743
01:16:11,278 --> 01:16:14,978
For two years she'd cleaned pigsties
on a re-education farm.

744
01:16:15,532 --> 01:16:18,023
Father murdered,
mother committed suicide.

745
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:24,363
And some dumb French-Canadian who's
seen the films of Jean-Luc Godard

746
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:27,037
and read Philippe Sollers

747
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:32,882
says that the Chinese
Cultural Revolution, is wonderful!

748
01:16:33,925 --> 01:16:38,421
Cretinism doesnt  sink any lower.

749
01:16:48,273 --> 01:16:50,762
Voluntary simplicity.

750
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:55,521
Scrambled eggs with ossetra caviar
and fresh truffles. -From Tuscany.

751
01:16:59,367 --> 01:17:05,037
And to stay in Italy, Castello Banfi Excelsus,
a modest vintage.

752
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:10,118
Why were we so dumb?
-Are we to infer congenital stupidity?

753
01:17:10,378 --> 01:17:14,920
Not at all.
-Intelligence isn't an individual trait.

754
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:18,964
It's collective,
national, intermittent.

755
01:17:19,178 --> 01:17:21,585
Oh, a new theory!

756
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:24,717
<i>Athens, 416BC
Euripides premieres his Electra</i>

757
01:17:24,933 --> 01:17:28,101
Two rivals attend,
Sophocles and Aristophanes.

758
01:17:28,312 --> 01:17:32,808
And two friends, Socrates and Plato.
Intelligence was there.

759
01:17:33,025 --> 01:17:37,153
Firenze, 1504, Palazzo Vecchio,

760
01:17:37,404 --> 01:17:42,529
on facing walls, two painters:
Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.

761
01:17:42,911 --> 01:17:47,654
An apprentice: Rafaello.
A manager: Niccolo Machiavelli.

762
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:53,742
Philadelphia, USA, 1776 - 1787.

763
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:57,337
Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution.

764
01:18:01,722 --> 01:18:07,306
Adams, Franklin, Jefferson,
Washington, Hamilton and Madison.

765
01:18:08,102 --> 01:18:10,937
No other country
has been so blessed.

766
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:14,724
I was born in Chicoutimi,
Canada, in 1950.

767
01:18:14,942 --> 01:18:17,433
It's a miracle you're not dumber.

768
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:20,986
in 1950, everyone was dumb,
in Athens and Chicoutimi.

769
01:18:21,365 --> 01:18:24,532
In Italy you'd have supported
the Red Brigades.

770
01:18:24,744 --> 01:18:28,871
Now it's Berlusconi.
-Philadelphia voted George Bush.

771
01:18:29,123 --> 01:18:31,530
You see, you're not that dumb.

772
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:36,086
Intelligence has disappeared,
and it can take eons to come back.

773
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:39,998
From Tacitus to Dante was what,
11 centuries?

774
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,135
The Arabs kept intelligence alive.
-True.

775
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,882
You're not hungry?

776
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:49,634
It won't go down.
-And you? -No thanks.

777
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:57,937
I never thought I'd see the day
you'd turn down fresh truffles.

778
01:19:00,029 --> 01:19:02,484
Alas, that day is here.

779
01:19:05,325 --> 01:19:07,152
A sip of wine?

780
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:11,657
Drink to my health
and tell me how good it is.

781
01:19:44,197 --> 01:19:48,326
I'd like to bow out
just like Felix Faure.

782
01:19:48,952 --> 01:19:51,359
Why am I not surprised?

783
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:55,124
I can dream.
-Who was he? Why?

784
01:19:55,333 --> 01:20:00,541
Oh blessed Felix Faure, the
President of the French Republic.

785
01:20:01,006 --> 01:20:03,164
His heart stopped beating,

786
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:07,332
while his mistress the admirable
Madame Steinheil, kneeling before him,

787
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:12,975
bestowed on him the most
glorious blowjob of all time.

788
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:17,895
My god!
-His enemies gloated:

789
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:22,151
"She seized him, the would-be
Caesar and he had a seizure!"

790
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:30,527
Henceforth Madame Steinheil
was known as the kiss of death.

791
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:35,153
I should be so lucky!

792
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:39,329
It's not our fault
if your heart is unstoppable.

793
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:45,748
I'd like to remind you that at a certain time,
I and several others here

794
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:49,129
blew you most heartily,
with enough force to capsize a schooner.

795
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:53,722
What do you know
about blowing buoys?

796
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:57,634
Well, sir, our efforts
earned gushing praise.

797
01:20:58,646 --> 01:21:01,849
Heavens, that's hard to swallow.

798
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:19,834
I'm beat.
-Go to bed.

799
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,247
Aren't you coming?
-Not tonight.

800
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:18,090
The Middle Ages, the manuscripts...

801
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:22,351
The barbarians,
everywhere, tomorrow...

802
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:28,765
Their prince approaches.

803
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,496
Are you trying to be funny?

804
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:03,319
I'm scared.

805
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:09,250
We'll do what you want.
It's your decision.

806
01:24:19,552 --> 01:24:21,879
Know what I want for you?

807
01:24:23,933 --> 01:24:26,886
To have as fine a son as you.

808
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:46,030
Heard from Sylvaine?
-No.

809
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,745
Tell her I thought of her.

810
01:24:52,336 --> 01:24:54,330
I love you.

811
01:25:30,916 --> 01:25:35,293
Not so long ago
I'd have jumped you without asking.

812
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:40,048
I might have let you.
-I suspected as much.

813
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,807
I wasn't here today. You didn't see me.
-Of course.

814
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,995
This just came in.

815
01:26:16,836 --> 01:26:24,464
<i>On a ship,
you call it the evil eye...</i>

816
01:26:26,597 --> 01:26:33,311
<i>Striking a growler - an iceberg -</i>

817
01:26:34,813 --> 01:26:38,515
<i>at night,
or a fire from an oil leak...</i>

818
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,946
<i>It's been too long
since I've seen you.</i>

819
01:26:47,325 --> 01:26:50,243
<i>My Daddy, my Papuschka,</i>

820
01:26:52,956 --> 01:26:56,159
<i>I've have missed you all my life.</i>

821
01:26:58,419 --> 01:27:03,000
<i>Tell yourself I'm a happy woman,
I've found my place.</i>

822
01:27:03,884 --> 01:27:10,218
<i>I don't know how you did it, but
you managed to pass on your lust for life</i>

823
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:18,562
<i>You and Mom raised incredibly strong
children. It's a miracle really</i>

824
01:27:24,905 --> 01:27:29,900
<i>You know, the first man in a
woman's life is her father.</i>

825
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:37,364
<i>You'll always be with me.</i>

826
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:06,068
Friends, sharing this modest life
with you has been a delight.

827
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,606
I take your smiles with me.

828
01:29:08,966 --> 01:29:10,958
Remy, Remy...

829
01:29:28,610 --> 01:29:30,485
The man of my life.

830
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,474
My guardian angel.

831
01:30:05,939 --> 01:30:08,098
It's a privilege to know you.

832
01:30:09,652 --> 01:30:12,142
The privilege was all mine, Miss.

833
01:32:11,357 --> 01:32:13,563
Mom doesn't want to live here.

834
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:18,767
I don't need to sell it.
You can move in for now.

835
01:32:33,670 --> 01:32:37,620
IF THIS BE A MAN

836
01:32:44,304 --> 01:32:46,427
HISTORIA AND UTOPIA

837
01:34:22,277 --> 01:34:24,234
I love you.
