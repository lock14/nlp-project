00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,872
l think everybody likes the idea

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,037
of taking something that
you're familiar with

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,028
and turning it into something that
you're not as familiar with,

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,954
like a 1 8- wheeler semi
into Optimus Prime,

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,349
and so that was the beginning.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,556
l joined Hasbro in 2000,

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,235
and the company was in
some degree of difficulty.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,835
So we were focusing back
on our core brands

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,070
and Transformers was
one of those brands

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,991
that we began to really
rethink about.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,038
And how do we reignite this
brand or future generations?

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,433
l was aware of the TV show.
l used to watch it with the kids,

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,432
and l thought, ''This is
a movie waiting to come out

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,911
''and be dusted off, and to be
reinvented as a live- action experience.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,918
l'm going to end your hunger
once and for all!

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,639
We were initially really resistant to
the idea of doing it,

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,234
because it's something that
we had cared about as kids

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,355
and that's always kind of a...

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,670
lt's on the one hand, really exciting
to take that challenge

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,149
and, on the other hand, you go,
''l don't want to screw this up.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,755
The first thing that l sat down
with the writers was an idea

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,593
to make this a story
about a boy and his car,

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,910
because that's something
everybody can relate to.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,117
Bumblebee, head for the underground
parking entrance.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,078
Transformers were always
about robots in disguise

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,156
and ''more than meets the eye.

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,391
And that ''more than meets the eye'' could
mean more than just the robots.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,756
''More than meets the eye'' could mean
something about the human characters.

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,115
But there were very few humans that
we could draw from,

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,670
so it meant coming up with characters
that didn't exist before.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,672
ln the original cartoon
there was a mechanic character

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,990
who was kind of the basis for Sam.

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,710
We looked to movies like E. T. for
the way that Elliott became the audience

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,394
and how we were experiencing
the wonder and the magic

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,629
of E. T. coming to Earth.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,154
Our first draft, actually,
was just focused on the kids.

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,753
That's awesome!

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,673
Steven Spielberg called me right
when l was finishing The lsland,

40
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,716
and he said,
''Like to do Transformers?

41
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,597
and l'm like, ''Okay. All right,
l'll think about it,

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,830
hung up. ''l'm not doing that movie.

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,870
That's what l said to myself.
''l'm not doing a toy movie.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,158
l thought about it, and
l went to Hasbro in Rhode lsland,

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,390
and they put me through
Transformers school.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,035
This is the classic G1 Optimus Prime,

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,796
very much like it was made in the '80s.
He had a very simple transformation.

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,949
Very easy to get from vehicle to robot.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,077
We did the full pitch.
Robots are not all equal.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,838
They're alive,
they're sentient men.

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,115
They have feelings,
they have allegiances.

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,635
You know, there's back- story,
there's a conflict.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,597
You know, that they are
fleshed- out characters,

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,238
and that we've had so many eras,

55
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,788
and there's so much potential
that they could pull from

56
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,950
to make whatever kind of movie
they wanted to make.

57
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,511
Something in Transformers just struck me
when l was sitting there.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,639
l said to myself, ''lf you can make
this really real and edgy.

59
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,598
And l saw a couple of images
that were towards the direction

60
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,309
they would like to take this, and
l'm like, ''That's really interesting.

61
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,834
So, l think, right then and there
l was kind of sold on

62
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,273
trying to make this idea work.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,874
Michael Bay was born to
direct Transformers.

64
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,111
He was the perfect fit for
this concept.

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,237
l hired a team of probably
about 25 artists,

66
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,675
different people from
different kinds of expertise

67
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,830
and we were starting to design robots.

68
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,919
There was apparently a script,
l hear it was way too kiddie.

69
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,238
No one wanted me to read it 'cause
they thought l would quit

70
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,309
right then and there.

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,830
Michael has incredible instincts
about what will please an audience,

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,592
and so as we were
developing the script,

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,715
we would run ideas by him.

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,915
We'd say,
''What do you think about this?

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,468
l knew l wanted to make it
very credible and serious,

76
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,075
and l told these guys l wanted to
broaden it out and make it

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,469
so that it had
a little more global impact.

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,915
Much like Close Encounters
of the Third Kind,

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,468
Richard Dreyfuss's story is
clearly the centrepiece

80
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,233
as Shia LaBeouf's story is
the centrepiece of our movie.

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,676
But then we have two other groups
of humans that we follow quite closely.

82
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,196
l kept putting in things of different
action stuff that l saw,

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,477
and what we'd do is that we'd
sit down, we'd bat it around,

84
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,275
and they see what l'm
really liking and not liking.

85
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,429
Once he got into the rhythm of it,

86
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,636
he started imagining
these incredible sequences

87
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,871
and a lot of what we ended up
doing action- wise was very collaborative.

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,477
He is the sickest action director
on the planet.

89
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,269
That is something that he is.

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,471
He's not Elia Kazan,

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,835
and Mike'll tell you that.

92
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,159
Oh, that's funny. Wasn't that funny?

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,356
Robots there with
a missile coming right down

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,271
that street down there.

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,397
lt's gonna hit that truck right there,
the robots are holding it up.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,193
- Okay, roll cameras!
- Roll them out! Okay, speed!

97
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,315
- Ready?
- Ready?

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,594
- And...
- And...

99
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,798
Four, three, two, one!

100
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,071
Michael staged huge,
logistically complicated scenes

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,233
of massive destruction and explosions
and even when l was watching

102
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,596
those dailies without
the actual Transformers there,

103
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,511
it was just eye candy.

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,995
ln this movie, Michael is the star,

105
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,357
and Michael is so much fun.

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,391
We line everything up with the football.
Ready and hike!

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,950
And three, two, one, bam!

108
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,632
- Does that work?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,869
That's perfect.

110
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,670
Three, two, one, and bam!

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,999
Action!

112
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,389
l think ''Bayhem's'' a good word
if you're working with Michael.

113
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,916
l mean, we have to be prepared
to go in any direction.

114
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,279
Fifteen over.

115
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,189
Cut!

116
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,953
Might show up and say,
''Today, l want to flip a car.

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,751
You have to be three steps
ahead of Michael.

118
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,029
Smells good.

119
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,030
You hear on the walkie
when l'm walking in, ''Bay's coming in.

120
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,519
''He's coming in hot,
he's coming in hot.

121
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,874
Here we go, ready?

122
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,996
You know it's all wired 'cause
l'm ready to go.

123
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,196
When l come in to the set,
l want to start shooting.

124
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,271
Come on, on cameras! Let's go!

125
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,920
He's got a tireless kind of energy,

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,833
and l understood that that's
how he gets into it,

127
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,718
and then he's into it just like
an actor getting into character.

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,677
Jim, lift him up again.
Do it again, do it again!

129
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,795
Keep rolling. Ready?

130
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,799
Oh, God! Oh, God!

131
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,917
Oh, God!
Please don't kill me! Please!

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,718
Keep moving up, moving up,
moving up, moving up!

133
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,189
Okay, okay, okay!

134
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,998
Jim, lift him up again.
Do it again, do it again!

135
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,354
Keep rolling. Ready?

136
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,510
Mike needs people
who can accommodate his needs,

137
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,635
and you need to be able to adapt.

138
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,109
You can't be the guy
who's got the script notes

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,078
and the ledger and...''No, l can't do
that 'cause in the next scene l...

140
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,196
You can't be that guy.
Michael will eat you alive.

141
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,269
This ain't gonna...

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,035
lt ain't gonna...Trust me,
l saw it. l'd sit under it.

143
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,632
''Trust me, l said.

144
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,111
- Ready?
- Three, two, one, action!

145
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,635
Cut!

146
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,790
What he is, is he's very honest.

147
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,440
He's very blunt, he's very direct,

148
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,512
- he's very opinionated.
- Give me a shot, Dave.

149
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,070
And he has an amazing
visual sense of film.

150
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,635
Yeah!

151
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,836
He likes to use the megaphone
once in a while.

152
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,478
Ready and rolling cameras!

153
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,198
Three...Two...One...

154
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,395
Stay there!

155
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,711
Behind the car! No, you're going the
wrong way! The other way, other way!

156
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,995
God, he doesn't pay attention to
what we're shooting.

157
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,957
The thing about it is,
it's never personal.

158
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,474
- Yeah, buddy.
- Really?

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,549
Here, Randy.

160
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,835
Watch.

161
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,549
l've worked with a crew,
many of the same people,

162
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,279
for 1 0, 1 5 years.

163
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,351
So they know my style,
they know my pace.

164
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,158
- Hey, Mike!
- Michael!

165
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,350
You guys pulled that well.

166
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,590
l was, like, over here distracted.

167
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,993
There's a lot of success
attached to what Michael does

168
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,471
and a lot of careers have prospered
by being part of the films with him,

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,597
so he attracts a lot of actors.

170
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,751
How do you know
you're getting a good shot?

171
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,512
l've been doing
this for a long time.

172
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,033
One of my producers,
lan Bryce, said to me,

173
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,350
''You should get this kid Shia.''

174
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,675
And l said,
''l thought he was older.''

175
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,593
So he came in and he actually
looked like a 1 6- year- old.

176
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,234
- Now, tell me what happened.
- No, no,

177
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,151
you said you'd pick me up,
no questions asked.

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,594
l know that was the deal.

179
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,238
Pop, remember how Great- gramps

180
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,231
pretty much flew over
the cuckoo's nest?

181
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,676
Do you think it could have been passed
on to me like a mutant Witwicky gene?

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,274
First, l was like,
''Wow, l'm making a Transformers movie.''

183
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,713
lt's insane, you know.

184
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,316
They're gonna mess that up completely.
Screw that up so bad.

185
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,678
But when l first sat there with Mike,
it was never the discussion of,

186
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,239
''Let's talk about the robots.''

187
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,276
The first thing
he wanted to talk about was,

188
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,634
''How do we make this real?''

189
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,314
''How do we make these characters
come across as honest?''

190
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,628
Gentlemen.

191
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,395
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the Hershey squirts.

192
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,549
How can l help you?

193
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,598
My son here is looking to
buy his first car.

194
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,592
What l like about Shia is
he's the everyday dude

195
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,196
but he's great at improve
and he's got a great comic wit.

196
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,039
Nice, right? lt fits me.

197
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,396
Shia's one of the funniest people,
just naturally.

198
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,357
lt's hard to get through
scenes with him sometimes

199
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,396
because he's so good at improv

200
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,278
and he gets funnier and funnier
as he goes.

201
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,588
l just didn't recognise you.

202
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,272
Yeah, well, l mean,
that's understandable.

203
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,477
You know, l just got back from fat camp.
l lost, like, 80 pounds.

204
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,710
Oh, you know what?
Good for you.

205
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,915
- Yeah.
- That's good for you.

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,231
- Yeah, yeah, l learned a lot.
- lt makes you a stronger person.

207
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,675
- Yeah, physically and mentally.
- Yeah.

208
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,988
- And so...
- Did you make friends?

209
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,914
Yeah, l mean some of them died
'cause diabetes is really chronic there,

210
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,595
but l mean, like, there's three or four
that l kept in contact with

211
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,557
and they're really good people.

212
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,393
You know, 'cause fat people
aren't bad people,

213
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,675
and that's one of the main things
they teach you there.

214
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,558
lt's hard for me to try to not laugh
'cause l get in trouble

215
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,312
'cause we won't ever
make it through a scene.

216
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,156
l just put the light in.

217
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,674
Most importantly, l think
he can keep up with Bay.

218
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,350
Bay is constantly
evolving the characters,

219
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,635
is constantly throwing
something different at you.

220
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,989
My first scene actually
was with the dogs.

221
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,675
lt was like, ''Welcome to Michael Bay's set.
Release the hounds.''

222
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,830
You need to stay hidden
until l tell you, okay?

223
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,035
Yes, yes.

224
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,872
The trainer is worried about your ass.

225
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,997
But we are insured.
DreamWorks, through Paramount.

226
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,593
You know, it's your first day.
''Hey, welcome.''

227
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,511
And the whole crew's like,
''Hey, nice to meet you,''

228
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,431
and ''Action,'' and you're running.

229
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,714
Dogs sort of get smart
after a while.

230
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,837
And instead of stopping at camera,
the dogs kept chasing Shia.

231
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,359
Don't chase him!
Don't chase him!

232
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,113
Fortunately, Shia ran past me
about 30 miles an hour,

233
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,794
and l was able to grab the long
chain that was attached to the dog.

234
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,790
Thank God, Shia's a fast runner,
all right?

235
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,995
Because that thing wasn't stopping.

236
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,878
lt was gonna clamp down on
that poor kid's ankle, l'm telling you.

237
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,235
That would have been
the end of me in this film.

238
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,548
lt would have been the first day.

239
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,152
No, no, no, no!

240
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,750
Bay talked about
how hot Mikaela was gonna be.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,116
We talked about finding, literally,

242
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,749
the most gorgeous 1 8- year- old there is
out there, which l think we did.

243
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,717
- l think we did.
- l think we did.

244
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,869
And action.

245
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,633
Oh, God, if Trent could just
see me right now.

246
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,951
Yeah. Wait, what?
lf Trent could...

247
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,874
Trent. Yeah, if Trent could see
me right now. This is crazy.

248
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,236
We interviewed a lot of different
young women for this,

249
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,038
and Megan, l don't know,
l just liked her look,

250
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,350
l liked that no one really
knew about her.

251
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,714
l think Shia helped her out.

252
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,394
l think that energy between them,
l think it kind of works.

253
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,357
l hope l didn't get you stranded
or anything like that.

254
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,429
No, it's fine.

255
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,476
So, l was wondering
if l could ride you home.

256
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,232
l mean, listen,
l was headed this way,

257
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,629
l figured, you know,
l'd ask if you want a ride or not.

258
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,676
- l'm just putting it out there.
- All right, let's go again.

259
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,911
Yeah, don't say, ''lt's fine.''
Just kind of a nod.

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,357
The only thing Mike asked me when l was
reading with him and auditioning,

261
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,512
he just asked me if l could run.
He's like, ''Can you run?''

262
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,635
l was like,
''Yeah, l think so.''

263
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,392
And the other thing
he asked me,

264
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,993
he goes, ''Do you have
a nice stomach?''

265
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,992
And l said, ''Well,
in my opinion, yes, l do.''

266
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,516
So l figured l'm gonna be running,
hopefully not naked,

267
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,795
but l'll be running in
a belly shirt maybe.

268
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,429
Go!

269
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,037
Megan did good.
With all the running and jumping

270
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,236
and car skidding and
everything else going on,

271
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,799
l think Megan
really hung in there.

272
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,154
And drop!

273
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,793
Just from filming, l've put on, like,
almost 1 0 pounds of muscle.

274
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,190
Hey, guys, give me
a 30 pad right here.

275
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,032
Coming at 'em.

276
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,035
All right, we're off,
and roll camera.

277
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,317
All right, here we go.
Look back...Here we go.

278
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,394
And cut! That's good.

279
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,357
That's good.
Let's go to lunch.

280
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,599
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.

281
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,272
- We needed a leading man.
- Yeah.

282
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,273
We needed a leading man.
There were lots of great actors out there,

283
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,954
but a leading man is
very different from just a good actor,

284
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,837
and Josh encompasses that.

285
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,559
l'm thinking l might win
an Academy Award for this role.

286
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,472
No, l don't want
a premium package!

287
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,471
Come on! Go on!
Fall back!

288
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,352
''Best Screaming in a Movie.''

289
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,153
Lennox!

290
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,994
- Oh, water, thank you.
- Give me chocolate.

291
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,559
''You got chocolate?''
Say, ''Give me chocolate.''

292
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,073
You got chocolate?

293
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,235
l liked him as a person 'cause he was,
like, very American, kind of no BS,

294
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,709
kind of just a nice guy.

295
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,550
Colonel Moore offered me the opportunity
to go up in a T- 38 today.

296
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,480
A lot of these military guys
were very much like Josh,

297
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,471
so l thought
it worked really well.

298
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,313
Yeah, l'm with the top dog.

299
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,309
You'll be fine.

300
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,188
l had to go through about
four or five hours of training

301
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,599
and, you know,
they basically tell you,

302
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,638
''Okay, this is what's gonna happen
if you have to eject from a seat.''

303
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,076
l had to change shorts
after l left training.

304
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,036
l get to fly in a T- 38 today

305
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,269
- Not too snug, but not too loose.
- Okay.

306
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,998
Pull them tight.

307
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,275
And that snap rolls
from bottom to top.

308
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,310
Take a breath and
hold it, please.

309
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,189
- There you go.
- And that's how it sits.

310
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,989
l am happy if l get a chance to show

311
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,680
what we in the Air Force can do

312
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,355
and what great airmen we have.

313
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,796
lt was one of the most exciting things
l've ever done,

314
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,791
and he let me actually
fly it a little bit.

315
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,192
He was, like, ''Okay, turn to 1 0 degrees,
and we'll go down to 1 ,500 feet.''

316
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,996
l didn't throw up once.

317
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,595
Starneisha, Taneisha and Keisha.

318
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,312
You all laughing at
my daughters' names?

319
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,435
Yeah.

320
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,033
Damn, get me home.

321
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,558
All right, cut. All right.
All right, good.

322
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,394
Tyrese, he paid me to be
in this picture, so l took his money.

323
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,757
Michael Bay keeps everybody on edge,

324
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,638
so we can all stay sharp
and on top of our game.

325
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,877
'Cause he's on top of his game.

326
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,953
And, you know, if you don't step up,
you get left by the wayside.

327
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,349
Ready? Action!

328
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,396
Hello? Do you hear me?

329
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,159
You hear me now?

330
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,708
Hello? Hello? Hello?

331
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,836
Hello? Hello?

332
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,434
No, l got no bar! l got no bar!

333
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,512
l had a little situation right
before l started filming.

334
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,431
l just got sick, really sick,

335
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,318
and l ended up missing, like,
the first three days of filming.

336
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,549
So to get back on the set

337
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,837
after all of the warnings and precautions
my doctor hit me with

338
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,309
and to be in Alamogordo
was just crazy.

339
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,350
Hundred and twenty- some degrees,
white sand bouncing the sun.

340
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,591
Bam, can't even look at the sand
'cause it was so bright.

341
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,513
Just hot. Hot for
no damn reason at all.

342
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,871
- Cut. All done?
- Mark it.

343
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,195
- ls that good?
- Good.

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,550
l've always wanted to
work with John Turturro

345
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,358
and l'm really glad l did.

346
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,396
And l was intimidated
the first day of working with him

347
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,993
and l got on
with him very well.

348
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,399
Rolling!

349
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,357
Ready? And action.

350
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,159
Your son's the great- grandson of
Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

351
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,753
lt's Witwicky.

352
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,599
- Witwicky?
- Witwicky.

353
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,910
May l enter the premises, sir?

354
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,278
Don't laugh!

355
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,918
l've definitely been enjoying myself.

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,152
l feel like l've been able to
be a little creative and imaginative.

357
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,277
Sometimes you don't
get a chance in a really big film.

358
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,354
Get that thing to stop, huh?

359
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,038
Looking at us. Looking at us.

360
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,270
Get that thing to stop!

361
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,793
l love working with Turturro.
He's a funny guy.

362
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,156
And he does phenomenal impressions
of people in the business.

363
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,276
And he knows everyone.

364
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,511
He does a Scorsese imitation
that'll just bring the house down.

365
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,955
''Every film he ever made was
flashing through my mind.

366
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,917
''Silver Chalice,
The Hustler, this, this or this.

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,433
''So, l'm out of my mind.
He's Paul Newman,'' he goes.

368
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,317
''How am l going to direct him?''

369
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,190
She did it! She did it!

370
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,714
She's the one you want!
She's the criminal, okay?

371
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,554
Okay, look, l'll wear a wire.
l'll turn state's evidence.

372
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,312
- l'll do whatever you need me to do.
- What? Glen!

373
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,836
Hey! No, no, look, l'm not going
to jail for you or for anybody!

374
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,115
Michael will come in
and tell us what he likes

375
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,077
and what he wants
conveyed and that.

376
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,559
Let's just try to
have some fun with it.

377
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,631
Come on, come on, focus, Glen!

378
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,156
Then the thing's going to whiz by.
Ready? And...

379
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,833
What was that?

380
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,878
Oh, l got a family history
of heart trouble.

381
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,959
He gives us the freedom,
and we have fun.

382
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,519
And Steven Spielberg was on set

383
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,194
and said that he had
been watching dailies.

384
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,474
Hello.

385
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,194
''Who wrote that?'' l did.

386
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,912
l did, Steven.

387
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,236
You know. l didn't even
charge you for it.

388
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,719
l'm gonna charge you
on the next one though.

389
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,394
- l'm Sam Witwicky.
- Maggie. Hi.

390
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,597
- Did you say ''Witwicky''?
- Yeah.

391
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,955
Both girls needed to
be drop- dead gorgeous.

392
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,112
And there's gorgeous
with the right persona, too.

393
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,270
ln this film, l wear, like,
six- inch stilettos.

394
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,635
And l have been
running away from aliens,

395
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,474
keeping up with John Turturro,
Jon Voight, Anthony, the whole gang.

396
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,471
ln heels, l might add.

397
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,314
l challenge Michael Bay to
direct for one hour in those things.

398
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,197
Point it away
from her just a little.

399
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,633
- Rotate the gun.
- Rotate the gun.

400
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,869
There you go.

401
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,757
Just, like, not too far.

402
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,553
Okay, ready?

403
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,073
l'm kind of a pacifist,
you know.

404
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,550
Like, l don't really like
the whole action- movie- gun thing,

405
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,995
l'm kind of very anti- weapon.

406
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,829
But, God, it was fun.

407
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,112
- l'm a signals analyst!
- Then send a signal then!

408
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,592
Come on, you punk!

409
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,073
l love Jon Voight
'cause he's a great actor

410
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,673
and he's a great guy
to hang around with.

411
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,230
And he's just a passionate guy.
l like working with passionate people.

412
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,550
- Okay, so l'm gonna do this here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,915
l'm gonna come in here, and
then l'm gonna come in here.

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,878
- Then l'll jump in and...
- Sure.

415
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,713
l'm a little old to be playing
this kind of game with the kids,

416
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,678
but l love the physicality.

417
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,196
There you go, and action!

418
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,756
- Get down!
- Down! Down!

419
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,398
l do a roll and tuck,
with a gun in my hand

420
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,111
and, it's funny, everybody says,
''Did you see what Jon did?''

421
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,149
And l say, ''Hey, fellows, l'm not gone yet,
l'm still in the game here.''

422
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,397
Take that moment
and make it a moment!

423
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,471
NBE One chamber now!

424
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,719
Jon Voight's fast!

425
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,997
He outran me and he was in,
like, penny loafer shoes.

426
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,274
l don't know how he did that.

427
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,313
l'm doing this documentary
about Jon Voight.

428
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,709
There he is in all his glory.

429
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,756
There's the creature
in his natural habitat.

430
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,319
The man's a legend.

431
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,311
Do a little wave, Jon?
A little wave?

432
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,231
- Little wave.
- Little wave for the camera?

433
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,833
Would you be so kind?

434
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,035
Both Johns.

435
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,873
You talk to both of them and...
Geniuses, you know?

436
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,753
The guys know how to do this.

437
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,559
Cut, cut, cut. Thank you.

438
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,117
l've had a good relationship
with the US military for many years,

439
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,510
and l was dead set on
getting the military to cooperate.

440
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,429
We went through basic training
for three days

441
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,228
at Fort lrwin just outside of Barstow.

442
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,670
Good morning, gentlemen!

443
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,549
You have a set call
with the Army.

444
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,948
Sweet.

445
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,197
ls everybody happy?

446
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,793
We took the guys out to
the .50 calibre machine gun range,

447
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,633
and some of the guys, l don't think,
had ever even seen a weapon fire,

448
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,513
and certainly had never fired one.

449
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,913
We were fortunate enough
to let them observe the firing

450
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,070
and we put them through
a safety course.

451
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,310
Your round will get into place,
you let it forward,

452
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,072
and one shot at a time.

453
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,195
Gotcha.

454
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,998
- Put the first link in like that.
- Right.

455
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,433
Close the feature.

456
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,750
Yeah, pull it to the rear,
then let go.

457
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,149
Let it go.
And then do it again.

458
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,390
All right, you're ready to rock
and roll right now.

459
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,032
- Good shot.
- Nice.

460
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,635
All right.

461
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,917
ln Vietnam,
Carlos Hathcock once made a kill

462
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,197
from just under two miles away
with one of these.

463
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,790
He had a scope mounted on top.
He was a Marine Corps sniper.

464
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,598
Just under two miles,
he made a shot.

465
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,240
- Two miles away?
- Two miles away? Dead on.

466
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,359
The bullet will travel a maximum
effective range of about 7,000...

467
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,874
- 200.
- 7,200 yards.

468
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,115
They used to shoot down aeroplanes
with these in World War ll.

469
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,159
Check this out.

470
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,516
This is my first one.
Two, three, four and then five.

471
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,794
- All right.
- l got better.

472
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,279
Of course,
they were fed in the field.

473
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,433
They got to eat the MREs
and they got real food, too,

474
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,988
but they got a little taste of
what the military's all about.

475
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,957
- Heat up.
- Gourmet.

476
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,191
MRE is a meal ready to eat.

477
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,839
- The entree is the main meal.
- l can't tell which one's the main meal.

478
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,110
- Probably the one in the cardboard box.
- Okay.

479
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,318
We're cooking and this is the MREs,
which are surprisingly hot.

480
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,279
What the colonel explained to me is
that it's basically like Drano.

481
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,588
But you don't eat the Drano.

482
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,753
And then if you get the opportunity to
ever do this, it smells like garlic farts.

483
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,036
The chemical reaction
smells like garlic farts.

484
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,032
And at first when l walked over there,
l thought it was Tyrese.

485
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,599
So l'm really glad it's not

486
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,240
'cause we're gonna be working together
for a long time.

487
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,749
lt's all right.

488
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,628
l'll trade you my jalapeno cheese
for your crackers and jelly.

489
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,199
Now, that's a good deal.
l'll take that deal.

490
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,236
Look at this, Chicken Cavatelli.

491
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,113
Tastes like Spago.

492
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,832
- What we call PPE...
- Yeah.

493
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,310
PPE is our
Personal Protective Equipment.

494
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,949
This right here is called lBA,
the lndividual Body Armour.

495
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,951
This is the standard weapon
that we use right here.

496
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,712
lt's called a standard M4.

497
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,240
We're gonna be going over
a formation you use

498
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,992
before you enter a room.

499
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,833
So could we play any Rolling Stones?
Paint it Black?

500
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,990
We don't have any music in here.

501
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,915
We went to
a mock lraqi village.

502
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,589
A unit was getting ready
to deploy to lraq,

503
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,436
and we spent the afternoon with them
seeing what they do to prepare.

504
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,389
They teach you how to stack
and go into a room

505
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,912
and clear the whole room.

506
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,389
Gotta get into some of this.

507
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,079
You know, that's what...say.

508
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,469
You're looking out this way,
you're looking out this way.

509
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,309
And until they start to move,
since you're the last man of the stack,

510
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,039
you turn around. All right. Contact.

511
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,229
You want to meet them, all right?

512
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,198
That way everybody knows
they're all touched up.

513
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,793
Here.

514
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,598
All right, hold on. Stop.

515
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,514
When you're coming in,
just like this, all right?

516
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,716
- You're trying to jump.
- Did l do this?

517
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,553
- Yeah, you did it. You did a little hop.
- l did, didn't l?

518
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,949
All right?
You come in. Clear.

519
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,792
l did a little hop.

520
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,792
Does that feel
more smooth for you, guys?

521
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,995
- Yeah, it does.
- Better.

522
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,072
- All right, l mean, 'cause that...
- Felt sexy.

523
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,755
Bullets travel down the wall
six to eight inches, all right?

524
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,308
lf a bullet hits right here
and it's travelling down the wall,

525
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,550
due to the spiral of the round,

526
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,438
it will travel down
that wall six to eight inches.

527
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,479
So you wanna keep your ass off
the wall six to eight inches, all right?

528
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,719
Mother...l wish you would! Try me!

529
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,553
All right, you scan the windows here,
you scan the door.

530
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,790
Windows, door, windows, door.

531
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,278
Scan. Scan.

532
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,509
Freeze!

533
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,229
Nobody move!

534
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,034
- Status! One up!
- Two up!

535
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,109
Three up!

536
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,758
- Four up!
- All clear!

537
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,751
We worked our ass off,

538
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,230
and sometimes between breaks,
we would go, ''Where's Tyrese?''

539
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,717
He was in the van.
Air- conditioning.

540
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,239
Hurry up!

541
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,673
Everybody is leaving you!

542
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,796
People are dying!

543
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,310
You are killing them!

544
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,119
You really walked away with a respect

545
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,872
for the amount of preparation

546
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,554
that goes into being
a soldier in the military.

547
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,918
Right over here.

548
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,633
Great. Awesome.

549
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,191
Today is gonna be all about
an insertion into this village, okay?

550
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,352
l get involved in the training phase
of the actors

551
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,352
and making sure those guys at least
are comfortable- looking.

552
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,668
Move!

553
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,348
SAW gunner,
you are no good to us back here!

554
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,793
You must be up front!

555
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,111
We wound up recruiting
a bunch of active- duty SEALs.

556
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,033
So, they're current
in their tactical capabilities.

557
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,314
- See how my weapon is up here...
- Yeah.

558
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,755
...in front of my face?
lt's what we call ''the bubble.'' Okay?

559
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,271
l'm gonna have control of my weapon.
l can see my magazine well.

560
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,349
- Okay?
- Yeah.

561
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,113
My weapon up here like this.
l can still track my targets, whatever.

562
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,272
lt also acts as a bit of
a shield, too, you know.

563
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,112
Shut up.

564
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,830
Michael really wants to
bring as much military realism

565
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,273
into the movie as possible.

566
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,229
A big part of that is to use
military people to play military people.

567
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,029
Yeah.

568
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,917
The entire crew got speaking roles.

569
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,798
Michael liked them and wanted
to change the scene on the spot.

570
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,553
We approved it, and
they got speaking roles out of it.

571
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,949
Okay, let's send the AA- 1 0s.
Danger close situation,

572
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,349
and make sure there's friendlies
in the area within one kilometre.

573
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,795
Checking Switch One- One to
Hawk One- One to strike.

574
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,317
The extras that we used from
Holloman Air Base were off- duty,

575
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,960
and they were paid extra's salaries.

576
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,353
The United States Air Force
and Marines and Army. Everybody.

577
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,559
l love you all dearly.
l'm so proud of what you're doing for us.

578
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,713
lt's unbelievable. Okay?
Both here and over there.

579
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,469
So just keep it up

580
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,869
'cause you're well- loved
and you gotta know that.

581
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,316
Typically, an extra would not
have any experience with a weapon.

582
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,391
These guys are very
experienced with weapons.

583
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,629
Mark.

584
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,711
Cut that! Cut that!

585
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,074
l think l'm gonna open you up more.
Just go to your right.

586
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,752
Go to your right,
right over there.

587
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,308
Probably had, like, 200 military

588
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,312
and about 50 stunt people
running and scattering,

589
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,234
firing and being chased by
tumbling vehicles that were on cables.

590
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:43,234
Ultimately, zero is
our key sweet spot. Zero.

591
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,915
When l give you a ''five, four,''
my guys will start firing and moving.

592
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,069
Right, l got you.

593
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,549
Five, four, three...

594
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,193
Four, three...

595
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,799
That was good.

596
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,995
Good job, guys!

597
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,599
Even though
it wasn't a real explosion,

598
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,797
it certainly created the effect.

599
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,792
And, trust me, as a professional

600
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,111
who knows all about
blowing things up for real,

601
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,270
we appreciate anything like this.

602
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,351
l like shooting stuff real on set.

603
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,670
lt seems to be a dying art.

604
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
We put actors in situations
where we know it's so safe,

605
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,595
but it looks very dangerous.

606
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,553
We're good?

607
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,715
Okay.

608
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,078
Weapon is hot! Full loads.

609
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,593
Everybody, here we go now!

610
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,955
Take two. Fire in the hole.

611
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,076
Guys, lock it up,
clear it out!

612
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,869
Ready and let's roll camera.

613
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,234
Rolling!

614
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,357
Ready?
And three, two, one, action!

615
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,788
Action!

616
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,439
lt was good.
l think we can do better.

617
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,070
We try to put the audience
inside the action,

618
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,993
and the closer we get to it and
the more movies we've done together,

619
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,117
the more that we capture
that for the audience.

620
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,028
l told Shia, ''You know,
you better get in shape for this.''

621
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,917
l was at 1 30
when l got the role,

622
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,070
and it wasn't like
l pulled a Christian Bale

623
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,993
and completely transformed,
but l put on 25 pounds of muscle

624
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,594
and then slimmed down
throughout the filming.

625
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,310
So, it's not reassuring that
they put bulletproof safety on the camera

626
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,512
when you're gonna
be right in front of it.

627
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,397
And right there also,
you see?

628
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,118
Stop right there!

629
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,872
They make sure
they protect the cameras,

630
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,996
but actors, expendable.

631
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,029
We had this scene
where he's facing off against Megatron.

632
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,280
ls it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?

633
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,718
And the producer, lan Bryce,
he knows how l like physical stuff,

634
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,756
and he says, ''So we're gonna
do that blue screen, right?''

635
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,149
l said, ''No,
we're doing that real.''

636
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,391
He said, ''Really? Really?'' l said, ''Yeah,
we're gonna put him out there.''

637
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,792
They can build Optimus Prime,
they can blow up the Pentagon,

638
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,270
but they can't find a way to
keep Shia off the ledge.

639
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,157
Right, Michael Bay?

640
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,709
All right, ready?

641
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,599
Yeah, well, since we locate.

642
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,071
l gotta tell you,
it's scary going out there,

643
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,037
'cause you literally have no safety net

644
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,430
and you just have these silly wires
hanging on your hip.

645
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,080
And, mind you, l would never
do this myself ever, okay?

646
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,951
You're locked in,
you can't fall. See that?

647
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,077
You're bolted to a steel l- beam
and another pole.

648
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,913
What l could is l could fall
and scrape off the side,

649
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,594
then you'd have to pull me up.
That could happen.

650
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,399
l'm not gonna die, obviously,
but l could get scraped.

651
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,916
You know, this is Fear Factor.
That's all it is. lt's Fear Factor.

652
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,353
lt's Fear Factor.

653
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,873
People don't die on Fear Factor.

654
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,109
lt's another episode of Fear Factor.

655
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,156
They do more hairier stuff
on Fear Factor than this.

656
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,549
- You're right, you're right,
you're right.
- All right, let's do it.

657
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,996
Oh, mother...

658
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,229
Got it?

659
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,958
Jenny, bring him around this way, too.

660
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,396
Come way out towards the other way,
towards us, towards us.

661
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,472
Get the crane. The crane.
Ready? Roll camera.

662
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,074
Ready? And action shot.
Wide movements.

663
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,310
You're not gonna get it!

664
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,437
You're never gonna get this AllSpark,
you know that!

665
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,911
l'm never gonna
give you the AllSpark!

666
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,039
l feel like a fruitcake saying that,
Mike. lt's a...line.

667
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,439
Now you can see the robot in the sight.
Get the robot in the background.

668
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,070
Oh, no, no, no, no.

669
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,354
Okay.

670
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,115
- Mike?
- Yeah?

671
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,952
Are these just close- ups?

672
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,349
No, they're wide.
We see your face.

673
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,715
We see your face
and we're showing that it's you.

674
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,030
And we're showing
that it's not a platform.

675
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,111
lf it was just close- ups,
we could do that anywhere.

676
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,349
That's lame.

677
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,193
Oh, no, no, no, no.

678
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,115
Okay.

679
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,480
- l'm done, Mike. My voice is going.
- Okay, that's good.

680
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,199
- Shia's good. He's a good kid.
- He's great, got a lot of heart.

681
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,119
Are you gonna back up?

682
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,031
90% of the actors in this business

683
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,159
could not do what we did on this film.
They just wouldn't do it, you know?

684
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,028
There's action stars who don't get up
on the roof and do what we do.

685
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,235
Oh, no, no, no, no.

686
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,069
Now!

687
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,673
Transformers!

688
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,751
l fight giant robots.

689
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,398
- Way high, way too high.
- Okay, a little high.

690
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,596
...deep breath of this toxic smoke.
l'll be right there.

691
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,072
The location department on this movie
has really excelled.

692
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,869
l'm gonna say, ''And fire.'' Okay, guys?
You can hear me, right?

693
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,396
And it required pretty extraordinary sized
things, whether it's White Sands...

694
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,629
Fire!

695
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,714
Orange smoke, orange smoke,
orange smoke!

696
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,994
...or the Hoover Dam...

697
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,116
We're gonna shoot something quick,
then we're gonna go to lunch,

698
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,031
and then
we are going to go downstairs.

699
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,314
...or downtown L.A.

700
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,713
We finally saw what a 32- foot robot
looked against a two- storey house.

701
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,315
Suddenly, you realise you've gotta
find places that are enormous

702
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,312
to make these things
feel part of the environment.

703
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,952
Look, l escaped!

704
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,275
We can't leave the trucks on the road.
That's what l'm led to believe.

705
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,394
- What?
- On the side of the road.

706
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,028
- Make room.
- Because...

707
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,076
Behind the dunes,
so we can't see him,

708
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,673
there's gonna be a mini base camp
down there.

709
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,875
Yeah, we're working on that
right now

710
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,032
just to find out how we can
make it firm enough.

711
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,473
lt's a work in progress.

712
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,676
Every day is a rollercoaster
for me.

713
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,796
l don't know if it's the same
for every department,

714
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,589
but, you know, l find myself
on the verge of tears one minute

715
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,148
and then hysterical laughter the next.

716
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,152
llt, a new guy l worked with. l thought l was
gonna give the guy a heart attack.

717
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,389
- l have a question.
- Yeah?

718
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,552
He says,
''l can't get the observatory.

719
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,234
''lt hasn't been shot in five years.''
And l said, ''lt's a big movie.

720
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,393
''You can do it. Go to the Mayor's office.
You can do it.''

721
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,034
This is the path. See right in there?
This is where he's running,

722
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,078
and the Black Hawk's gonna come right up
on that edge there.

723
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,391
Leaving...Can we leave the helicopter
running there?

724
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,869
- Like at Playa?
- Yeah, it should be okay.

725
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,713
''l can't get the bridge with
four helicopters underneath.''

726
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,030
l said, ''You could do it.
Go to the Mayor's office.

727
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,032
''lt's a big movie. We're keeping
this film down in California.''

728
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,953
We structured the budget in order to
keep it in the United States,

729
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,349
which is not to say that the movie
couldn't be made elsewhere.

730
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,000
lt's just, l think, easier
and more comfortable

731
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,989
for Michael to have, you know,
a crew around that he's used to.

732
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,069
- Hey, Dave!
- Yeah.

733
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,311
l think we'll let them fire this way
so you can whip...You guys, hand- held,

734
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,470
you're gonna be kind of like
in here,

735
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,949
lift it like...You know
what l'm saying?

736
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,471
l actually cut my fee so that l can
shoot here with my crew

737
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,348
that knows how to shoot fast
and is good on the fly.

738
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,674
As soon as the plane
hits the ground

739
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,796
and it stops, we should
pull the vehicles forward.

740
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,159
Michael likes to go hard and fast.
He has the shock and awe approach

741
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,879
to scouting,
which is supposed to be...

742
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,717
Oh, no, that's not Michael,
that's a Stealth Bomber.

743
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,835
- Morning, Michael.
- Hi, Jack.

744
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,434
So, Holloman Air Force Base is
an extremely secure base

745
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,149
with a great deal of secret
goings on.

746
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,755
Yeah, yeah, l mean, this morning,
you know, we had a guy with an M1 6

747
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,990
protecting the AWACS
because even though they know

748
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,436
that they're here for us,
they're still very protective of their aircraft.

749
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,431
Slow- mo three to one, okay?

750
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,398
lf the American military is called on,
they will fight

751
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,632
enemies abroad or even alien robots,
if need be.

752
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,355
You don't want scrub brush by it,
you know,

753
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,396
tumbleweed, whatever, okay?

754
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,311
l can show you how to
get some better shots.

755
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,470
What's that little...

756
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,270
Driving into the centre of White Sands,
which is 300 miles...

757
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,909
lt's not literally sand, it's a crystal.
To see that for miles and miles...

758
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,468
There's no other place like that
on Earth.

759
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,513
White Sands missile range was created
for the atomic missile tests in the '40s,

760
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,272
and we had to make sure
that there was no chance

761
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,318
of somebody literally
stepping on a landmine.

762
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,708
So we had to engage the services
of a unexploded ordnance company

763
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,360
to mine- sweep to a depth of four feet

764
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,839
so that we could
build our Bedouin village

765
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,797
and then, ironically, blow it up.

766
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,474
When we got here
and laid out the buildings,

767
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,994
we realised that
the dunes were moving.

768
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,470
So the valley was actually
significantly smaller, up to 30 feet,

769
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,155
because of the wind.

770
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,990
Very hot. We had days,
1 1 5, 1 1 8 degrees.

771
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,310
That's the max so far.
lt could get hotter.

772
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,992
That's compounded by the fact that

773
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,154
the sand there is really just white quartz
that's washed off

774
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,312
of the surrounding mountains
and it just reflected like glass.

775
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,631
God! Hot!

776
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,711
l'm from Puerto Rico,
so when l was told,

777
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,597
''Careful, New Mexico is pretty hot''...

778
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,911
Oh, yeah!

779
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,793
...l go, ''l'm from Puerto Rico.
How hot can it get?''

780
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,919
lt's hot. Almost had heat stroke yesterday.
That's kind of wild.

781
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,513
lt was hard,
'cause they had a lot of gear.

782
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,749
Go! Go! Go! Go!

783
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,717
And running and yelling and shooting.

784
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,114
'Cause on my sets it's like...

785
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,270
Especially if you're doing military stuff,
it's tough.

786
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,079
l'm not, like, a very cushy
director in terms of

787
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,879
if we're here, we're here,
'cause l shoot really fast.

788
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,278
Men did huge work here,

789
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,033
bigger than anything l ever seen Hollywood
ever do or ever will.

790
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,394
Look at these cranes up here.

791
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,191
We're heading from the top of
Hoover Dam down into the turbine area

792
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,679
where it's very, very cool.

793
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,431
When you see it
you have no idea how big it is.

794
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,238
Hoover Dam is just massive.

795
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,356
We had to do some sort
of remedial work

796
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,752
because a film that shot there last year
didn't endear themselves

797
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,910
to the Hoover Dam by buzzing the dam.

798
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,673
lt's a grave situation, gentlemen.
Thank you for being with us.

799
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,910
Cut. Good. Do it again.

800
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,592
- That's okay, leave it.
- Ready?

801
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,750
Shoot it like that, huh, Mitch?

802
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,073
Off camera!

803
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,358
They really weren't into it at all,
especially, you know,

804
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,150
given Michael's penchant
for blowing things up.

805
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,196
So we, you know, worked out
with the Hoover Dam.

806
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,032
We'd get certain hours
early in the morning

807
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,997
where we could be up
on the top of the dam.

808
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,348
- Got to use the cam roller.
- Okay.

809
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,149
Okay, here we go.

810
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,192
Okay, we're going down to time it.
Take those ramps down with us.

811
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,317
- Push. Push.
- Come on, you and me right here.

812
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,517
And then as soon as the crowds came,
around 1 0:00,

813
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,795
we had to then go
inside or down below.

814
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,872
So we just scheduled our way around it,
and it actually worked out fine.

815
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,512
- Both of you guys go on this side.
- Give me 20.

816
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,590
- Where's John?
- You're not puking, are you?

817
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,030
The scale of the Hoover Dam was
a tall order.

818
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,599
There's not many places
you could do that

819
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,148
because everything there is so gigantic.

820
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,910
l think we became very familiar
with the architecture,

821
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,594
which allowed us to
build a set that tied in to it.

822
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,872
And action!

823
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,239
What is this?

824
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,835
When l looked at this Megatron hangar,
this illustration,

825
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,229
l'm like,
''That's the vibe of the movie right there.''

826
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,630
And it's amazing if one or two illustrations
can just set the vibe.

827
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,149
We used the Playa hangars where
Howard Hughes built the Spruce Goose,

828
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,629
and it's this great wood structure.
lt's kind of narrow,

829
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,312
but it's very tall ceilings.

830
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,031
You're able to build a lot of different sets
so you can go back and forth,

831
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,556
you know, in this kind of huge space,
but it's kind of separated,

832
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,392
and it's a great place to film.

833
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,116
Basically, we were sort of using
the structure as it was

834
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,270
and then embellishing
and sort of making it look

835
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,035
like a vintage facility again
in a subterranean setting

836
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,715
under Hoover Dam where Megatron
was frozen in ice.

837
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,713
Even though Megatron had bee
encapsulated in this space

838
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,075
for many, many years,
he's still being maintained,

839
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,718
so it was a little bit of, like,

840
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,109
new technology
mixed with old technology,

841
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,468
very much like Hoover Dam is.

842
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,358
When you go in, there are things
that have never changed in there.

843
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,911
The first time l walked onto the
Megatron set, l said, ''Wow.''

844
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,429
- Megatron.
- l had my son with me that day.

845
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,233
When he saw Megatron up there,
his jaw just dropped.

846
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,032
l was so impressed with it

847
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,839
that on my weekends
l would sneak onto the set

848
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,478
with my friends just to see it.

849
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,950
You know, he was 30, 35 feet
and he was only half built.

850
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,632
Like, l'd bring three or four friends,
and be like,

851
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,233
''You're never gonna believe
what they just built.''

852
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,629
l never do that. l mean,
l never do that.

853
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,280
This baby is the first we found!

854
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,509
And good, cut!

855
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,672
You want just to lay
that so you can watch?

856
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,318
- No, no, no, no. Right.
- Okay.

857
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,233
So l just do it
but just louder and more off the cuff.

858
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,754
''This baby is the first we found.''
Boom and get out of here.

859
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,112
Okay, ready.
Here we go, guys.

860
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:24,594
Ready and five, four, three, two...

861
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,394
The day that l saw that set,
l suddenly went,

862
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,392
''Oh, Lord,
this film is gonna be everywhere.''

863
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,471
That was the first day
that it dawned on me

864
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,677
that l was shooting
a really big American film.

865
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,519
l had to shoot in Los Angeles.

866
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,195
Now, Los Angeles,
they'd give us four blocks one Saturday,

867
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,430
they'd give us three blocks
this Sunday,

868
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,159
they'd give us those other four
next weekend from there.

869
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,832
And then we shot
at Universal backlot,

870
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,111
and then l shot in Detroit,

871
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,755
and l had to all make it feel
like it's one place.

872
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,353
So you had to keep the scene
in your head.

873
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,556
l mean, you just had to
wrap your head around it.

874
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,514
Downtown L.A. is a venue
for this kind of action stuff.

875
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,433
We'll go on five, four, three,
two, one. Blow up.

876
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,748
Go hot, please.

877
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,114
Go hot. Here we go!

878
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,430
He's right up by this building right here.

879
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,999
Ready, and he's right on top of you.
Go in three, two, one, action!

880
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,038
Here we go. Here we go.

881
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,828
Piece of crap.

882
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,872
Ready and roll cameras.

883
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,155
- Rolling.
- Hey, Rick, fire in the hole.

884
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,992
Let's go, guys.

885
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,278
Don't move too soon. Ready?
And three, two, one and action.

886
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,269
Not yet.

887
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,149
Up, up, up.

888
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,990
Hey, can you take
that light right out there

889
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,514
and light that thing up there?

890
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,512
The toughest bit was flying
the helicopters under the bridges,

891
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,439
for lots of reasons, not least of
which is the Homeland Security thing.

892
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,590
lf you fly helicopters under 500 feet,

893
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,275
then the FAA makes you jump
through a lot of hoops

894
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,591
because of the, you know,
the potential for crashing into neighbours.

895
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,036
What are you doing?

896
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,989
We are...We're getting pissed on
for the next three days.

897
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,279
You know, the helicopters flying low
kick up all the water from the L.A. River.

898
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,318
Nobody knows exactly
where that water is coming from.

899
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,073
You see all this water
right here on the floor?

900
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,799
lt's all man piss, okay?

901
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,155
And what happens is a science thing.

902
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,676
When you put helicopters
over a puddle of man piss,

903
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,320
man piss gets
all over your man body.

904
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,354
Please, stop!

905
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,353
So we all had goggles
and face masks on

906
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,795
so you don't breathe it or taste it.

907
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,633
Just piss all on my face,
on all my features,

908
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,350
piss on my arms, piss all over
my own piss. lt's just nasty.

909
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,959
- Right, Beaver?
- Oh, yeah.

910
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,508
lt's been a location- heavy movie.
lt's been a great challenge,

911
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,479
and it's funny how, you know,
the rose- tinted glasses effect applies.

912
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,994
l remember, l've been on
other shows where l finished,

913
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,513
l thought, ''God!
Thank God that's over.''

914
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,478
But as time goes by, you sort of

915
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,109
somehow mentally edit out the bad bits
and you remember the times

916
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,839
when there were bombers flying over
your head or just being out

917
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,959
in the sand dunes late in the afternoon
in the beautiful, sort of, evening light.

918
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:42,456
Well, the appeal of this movie,

919
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:45,451
you know, goes back to
my children's childhoods.

920
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:47,928
Because they would ask for
these things on their birthdays

921
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:51,807
and l would get them Transformer toys
and then we would play on the floor.

922
00:49:51,899 --> 00:49:54,129
And l remember my own experience
with Transformer toys,

923
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:57,928
how much fun it was for me. And
so this was a shared experience.

924
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:04,011
Transformers really gets its start in
Japan with Takara.

925
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:08,175
And it was a series of robot toys
that transformed

926
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:09,408
and that's all they really were.

927
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:12,969
A couple of Hasbro executives
went to Japan and saw this great idea

928
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:15,254
and thought that
there was something there.

929
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:17,978
And decided that this would be
a really cool concept if we could

930
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,651
wrap a story around it.

931
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:23,778
ln Japan there was no good guy, bad guy.
They didn't have home planet,

932
00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:28,375
they didn't have personalities or stories.
So that came from those meetings

933
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:31,849
in Hasbro. And the characters
that are weapons, or gear,

934
00:50:31,939 --> 00:50:35,329
let's make them the bad guys.
All the rolling characters,

935
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:36,977
let's make them the good guys.

936
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:40,449
The name Autobots, Decepticons,
came out of that.

937
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:43,292
After that, we started with
the animation company.

938
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:48,010
Transformers came out in '84.

939
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:49,817
And we weren't quite into girls yet,
l don't think.

940
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:54,217
So it was get home from school,
Transformers, glass of milk, brownie,

941
00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:56,494
whatever, you know, your snack...
l don't know what your snack was.

942
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:57,932
Not a glass of milk and a brownie.

943
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:00,817
But we saw it right
when it came out.

944
00:51:00,899 --> 00:51:06,292
Many millions of years ago,
on the planet Cybertron, life existed.

945
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:11,090
But not life as we know it today.
lntelligent robots that could think

946
00:51:11,179 --> 00:51:13,488
and feel inhabited the cities.

947
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:17,015
They were called Autobots
and Decepticons.

948
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:19,055
At the time,
there had been new legislation

949
00:51:19,139 --> 00:51:21,937
that kind of opened up
toy- related animation.

950
00:51:22,539 --> 00:51:25,531
Decepticon rule, forever!

951
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:31,528
So it was one of the first shows that
what you saw as a toy was in the show.

952
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:42,170
Transformers has a passionate fan base.

953
00:51:42,259 --> 00:51:44,978
- Who is the biggest Transformer fan?
- Me.

954
00:51:49,219 --> 00:51:51,130
- Transformers...
- More than meets...

955
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:52,254
...the eye

956
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:54,614
A lot of people remember
Transformers from the '80s

957
00:51:54,699 --> 00:51:58,135
which was when it was in its heyday,
but it's actually been around ever since.

958
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,417
And since 1 984,

959
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:04,777
Transformers has generated
over $3 billion in retail sales

960
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:09,137
and that's, you know, one of
the top franchises in history.

961
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:13,212
l have more than 1 ,000 Transformer
at my house, fan since l was a kid.

962
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,297
l think it's just the mythos,
l think that's what really got me into it

963
00:52:16,379 --> 00:52:18,495
after l was a kid
watching the cartoon.

964
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:21,935
Strong characters and just
a very cool toy line to support it.

965
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,738
l'm a pretty big fan. l got my first toy
when l was two years old.

966
00:52:24,819 --> 00:52:27,128
The first Transformer toy, l still have it.

967
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,655
About 75% of all adult men had had

968
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:33,048
a major Transformers experience
in their lives.

969
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:34,731
And that's true almost the world over.

970
00:52:35,659 --> 00:52:37,297
So we've got this great group of people

971
00:52:37,379 --> 00:52:39,495
who all grew up with the brand and
are now working

972
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:42,616
on the creation of Transformers, the movie.

973
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:44,291
lf it meant something to you as a kid

974
00:52:44,379 --> 00:52:45,607
and you had an emotional
response to it,

975
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:48,133
that's valuable and that needs to be
heard, period.

976
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,290
So we kind of come at it
from that place.

977
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:51,648
l was a fan,

978
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:55,288
l mean, from...My childhood was Yogi Bear
and the Transformers movie.

979
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:00,692
lt's over, Prime.

980
00:53:00,779 --> 00:53:04,294
Was l die- hard, like ''G1 all the way,''
and...like these people

981
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:07,371
on Ain't lt Cool News? No.
Do l have a Transformers tattoo

982
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:11,577
on my body, somewhere? Probably not.
Was l a fan? Extremely.

983
00:53:11,659 --> 00:53:15,618
l did a lot of research, a lot of studying on it
in the past year and a half.

984
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:20,375
So that would make me definitely
a Transformer head geek somehow.

985
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:24,414
From the very beginning,
we knew we had fans following this.

986
00:53:24,499 --> 00:53:27,252
From the first time that
a piece of art got out to the fact

987
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:31,730
that Michael Bay's computer was hacked
and the script got up online.

988
00:53:31,819 --> 00:53:35,289
So, l must say, so in fear of
one of you guys stealing

989
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,654
my computer to find out
the real robot names.

990
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:42,938
l decided that it'd be better to tell you,
this week or next week,

991
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,213
the true names. Okay?

992
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:48,850
Because l like my computer.
lt's got a lot of other secret...on it as well.

993
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:51,649
You could keep nothing secret
on this movie.

994
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:56,017
And the designs started getting out
on the lnternet. And people were saying,

995
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,375
''Oh, Michael Bay, you wrecked my childhood.
Damn you, Michael Bay.''

996
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:01,211
Like most Transformers fans,

997
00:54:01,299 --> 00:54:02,618
when l first saw the designs
in the movie,

998
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:04,815
l was, like, ''What?
They changed everything!

999
00:54:04,899 --> 00:54:06,696
''lt's completely different.
What's going on here?''

1000
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:09,247
l think a lot of the fans
hated me for it at first.

1001
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:13,491
After l read some of the posts that said
they wanted to protest out of my office.

1002
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:15,729
They actually picked the wrong office
because l had moved.

1003
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,937
They didn't know my real address, so...
And then the few little talk- backs

1004
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:21,896
where they said they want to hunt me
down and kill me.

1005
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:25,813
l had, you know, l had a couple of those.
But generally, you know, l would take

1006
00:54:25,899 --> 00:54:28,572
some of the constructive
criticism of stuff they saw.

1007
00:54:28,659 --> 00:54:31,696
l actually changed Megatron's face
when they opposed to it that much.

1008
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:34,934
lt was very important to
get our teaser out there.

1009
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:39,809
That was, like, more of a badass teaser
to show that it's real, not a cartoon.

1010
00:54:41,299 --> 00:54:44,609
That teaser on Yahoo was
the most downloaded teaser ever.

1011
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:50,048
That's crazy. So all of a sudden
they see the head piece.

1012
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:55,133
They're all like ''Oh, wow...okay.
That's starting to look really cool.''

1013
00:54:59,259 --> 00:55:04,014
You have to totally respect
what's been created and you can't deviate.

1014
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,818
And l knew, if l were to put these
characters in the real world,

1015
00:55:06,899 --> 00:55:08,571
they'd have to fit in the real world

1016
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:10,212
and they'd have to be
much more intricate.

1017
00:55:10,419 --> 00:55:12,535
We had kind of come to terms
with the fact

1018
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:15,975
that we respectfully acknowledged
what had come before.

1019
00:55:16,899 --> 00:55:20,687
But, you know, there was a lot of logic
that l had a problem with.

1020
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:23,529
On Cybertron, l mean,
they all walked around

1021
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:25,496
like, with truck parts,
you know, transform.

1022
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:27,934
And that just doesn't fly
when you're trying to

1023
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,091
at least make it credible for someone
who's never seen Transformers.

1024
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:34,171
So, on Cybertron, they have to have, well,
l created all of them

1025
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:37,057
having this endoskeleton, this underskin.

1026
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:40,176
Their technology, that is
beyond our understanding,

1027
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:44,013
based on kind of a
nano- molecular process, you know.

1028
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,614
Each molecule, each cell,
is a machine unto itself.

1029
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:54,094
So when they come to Earth,
they come in these weird pods.

1030
00:55:54,179 --> 00:55:58,377
lt's the endoskeleton wrapped up.
They land, they unfurl.

1031
00:55:58,459 --> 00:56:00,734
And the notion is that
when they arrive here,

1032
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:04,653
in order to truly just to exist
on this planet in disguise,

1033
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:07,458
that they have the capacity to
basically find a vehicle

1034
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:11,214
and replicate that vehicle
based on their mass.

1035
00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:14,689
Alex and l decided we were going to try to
avoid mass shifting, as we call it

1036
00:56:14,779 --> 00:56:18,454
in the fandom. When Optimus Prime
transforms from a truck into a robot,

1037
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:21,099
you want it to feel like
the same- sized truck

1038
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:24,251
is pulling into that same- sized robot.
And that there's no cheating going on.

1039
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,012
Hasbro helped us select
some of the robots.

1040
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:29,294
And clearly we wanted that
core cast of characters

1041
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:31,893
that people had known and loved.
And that's why we kept talking

1042
00:56:31,979 --> 00:56:34,732
about it as a G1 - inspired story.

1043
00:56:34,819 --> 00:56:39,847
G1 is a fan term for generation one.
So when people think back fondly

1044
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:43,773
on the '80s nostalgia,
gen one is what comes to mind.

1045
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:47,295
The characters that we knew had to be
in the movie without a doubt were,

1046
00:56:47,379 --> 00:56:50,451
on the Autobot side,
Optimus, Bumblebee...

1047
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:53,690
- Jazz.
- Jazz and lronhide.

1048
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:57,852
And on the Decepticon side
it had to be Megatron, Starscream.

1049
00:56:57,939 --> 00:57:00,533
And we knew we had to have someone
kind of related to Soundwave.

1050
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:03,133
Frenzy's in there as kind of
a representative of that.

1051
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,574
l actually wanted more robots
than we had,

1052
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:08,093
but it just ultimately got too expensive.

1053
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:40,049
Actually, a few characters that
we had contemplated

1054
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:41,697
that we'd design product for.

1055
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:43,690
We had a character here, Arcee,

1056
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:47,692
who is one of the only female robots
in the Transformers lore.

1057
00:57:47,979 --> 00:57:52,416
And she actually almost made it
into the movie but for some reason,

1058
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:54,296
they couldn't quite get the plotline correct.

1059
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:57,337
So maybe we'll see her
in future movies to come.

1060
00:57:57,419 --> 00:57:59,649
Hasbro wanted to see
what we came up with.

1061
00:57:59,739 --> 00:58:04,574
You know, they kind of left us completely
alone for a long time.

1062
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:09,528
They were really kind of, you know,
let me do my thing.

1063
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,849
You know, and where l veered off,

1064
00:58:11,939 --> 00:58:14,009
like with Optimus
we had to make the ears

1065
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,977
just a little bit bigger to get a little
more of the samurai look.

1066
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:20,088
lf you think about
where Transformers came from,

1067
00:58:20,179 --> 00:58:23,649
the robot culture of Japan
is in part based on

1068
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:25,775
the tradition of samurai armour.

1069
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:30,296
We had some serious,
l guess, Transformer...

1070
00:58:30,379 --> 00:58:33,291
Just total head geeks that have been,
you know,

1071
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:36,815
know the lore backwards and forwards
that we would vet this stuff through.

1072
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:40,131
Early on, the art department was
working on for Optimus,

1073
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:42,016
you can see that
he was a lot more blue.

1074
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:46,217
And even the vehicle parts
were kind of disappearing,

1075
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:49,735
particularly the tyres were uncoiling.

1076
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:52,208
And those were just things that were
gonna become issues

1077
00:58:52,299 --> 00:58:53,812
for us to make product of.

1078
00:58:53,899 --> 00:58:58,051
One of the things that
Transformers is not, is morphing.

1079
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:01,575
They are transforming.
So pieces have to go somewhere.

1080
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:08,814
On the product side, with real plastic,
my team has physics to contend with.

1081
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:11,094
That did present kind of
a design challenge

1082
00:59:11,179 --> 00:59:13,568
that we threw back to
the production team.

1083
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:17,174
And they realised that and l think we got to
a happy place for everybody.

1084
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:21,616
Autobots, transform. Roll out.

1085
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:26,172
Peter Cullen did the original voice
and still has a great voice.

1086
00:59:26,259 --> 00:59:29,695
And then this one,
give it a little bit more of a...You know.

1087
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,178
- ''Take it easy, lronhide.''
- Okay.

1088
00:59:31,259 --> 00:59:34,012
When Peter Cullen was announced
as the voice of Optimus

1089
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:35,578
l thought it was fantastic.
l thought it was awesome.

1090
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:39,174
And l thought it was the most
unexpected nod to the fans.

1091
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:43,616
And l think it showed a respect for how
much that voice defined the character.

1092
00:59:43,699 --> 00:59:46,532
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1093
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,053
Then you will die with them!

1094
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:53,895
When l was looking
at faces, l said,

1095
00:59:53,979 --> 00:59:57,654
l want Megatron to have an attitude
like a Hugo Weaving.

1096
00:59:57,739 --> 01:00:00,412
You still fight for the weak.

1097
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:07,168
Frank Welker, l kept putting his voice,
cartoon voice to our gigantic Megatron

1098
01:00:07,259 --> 01:00:08,294
and it just didn't fit.

1099
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:15,098
You fool, Starscream.
You fool, Starscream.

1100
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:18,452
You fail me yet again, Starscream.

1101
01:00:18,899 --> 01:00:21,015
- Okay.
- Thanks a lot, you did a great job.

1102
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:22,657
- Thank you, Michael.
- l appreciate you doing this.

1103
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:24,252
That was a pleasure. Enjoy yourself.

1104
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:26,530
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1105
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:31,133
The life- scale Bumblebee
was only meant to be

1106
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:34,529
just kind of a see it for pieces,
you know.

1107
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,168
lt really can't hold up to the detail
of going up close.

1108
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:42,570
What they'll do is they make that robot
in the computer.

1109
01:00:42,659 --> 01:00:47,255
Then they give us that computer file
and we'll make that part.

1110
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:51,298
This piece is called the Bumblebee.
lt supposedly transforms

1111
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:55,088
from a 2008 Camaro into this robot here.

1112
01:00:55,259 --> 01:00:58,535
How it's gonna do that,
l have no idea.

1113
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:02,248
There's 1 50 single parts on that robot.

1114
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:05,137
The whole robot was
sculptured out of foam.

1115
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:08,052
We took moulds off of them,
made fibreglass parts.

1116
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:11,654
And when it stands up,
it's actually about 1 8 feet tall.

1117
01:01:13,659 --> 01:01:15,615
That's too far, huh?

1118
01:01:15,699 --> 01:01:16,688
- Too far?
- So we'll cut.

1119
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:18,657
Put this away and get it done.

1120
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:25,299
A clincher will probably hold that.

1121
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,458
This thing cost $75,000 to paint.

1122
01:01:40,539 --> 01:01:44,896
He required a special four- layer paint
'cause it matches the car.

1123
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:48,894
Me and Bumblebee are starting to
get to be real close.

1124
01:01:48,979 --> 01:01:52,255
When we got near the robot
it was just like, ''No way!''

1125
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:54,455
And you start walking,
you're getting closer and closer

1126
01:01:54,539 --> 01:01:56,052
and you start seeing the body

1127
01:01:56,139 --> 01:02:00,530
and the torso and the head
and it's just nuts. lt was nuts. Silence.

1128
01:02:05,779 --> 01:02:09,374
The robot can't move on camera,
but we can position it in any position

1129
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,371
that Michael needs them and
so it's a really good guide for them.

1130
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:15,735
l'll bring you your
Bumblebee airbags for movie.

1131
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:23,615
- A camera, marker.
- Scene one.

1132
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,451
- And action.
- Action!

1133
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,892
No, no, no. Stop, stop!

1134
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,618
My favourite Transformer is Bumblebee.

1135
01:02:33,819 --> 01:02:35,696
Always been Bumblebee.

1136
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:39,935
My favourite Transformer now,
l think, is Starscream.

1137
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:41,452
Megatron is dead.

1138
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:43,649
The humans have taken it.

1139
01:02:44,859 --> 01:02:46,815
l think lronhide
is probably my favourite.

1140
01:02:46,899 --> 01:02:48,252
Stand back.

1141
01:02:48,339 --> 01:02:49,692
You feeling lucky?

1142
01:02:49,779 --> 01:02:51,610
l like Optimus Prime.

1143
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:04,929
What do we got here?
What is it?

1144
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:06,577
We got a truck.

1145
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:07,887
What character?

1146
01:03:07,979 --> 01:03:10,015
This is Optimus Prime here, baby.

1147
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:14,531
Good- looking truck.

1148
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:19,056
As a kid growing up, l was into fixing
my own cars and taking them apart.

1149
01:03:19,659 --> 01:03:22,378
So from cars and just being
an automotive head,

1150
01:03:22,459 --> 01:03:26,372
Transformers, it just struck me
as something fun to work on.

1151
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:28,848
Watch out, get out of the way,
l'm rolling cameras.

1152
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:33,729
Ready and ammo guy, go.
Ready and seven, Tammy.

1153
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,297
Michael Bay does know his cars.

1154
01:03:37,379 --> 01:03:40,337
He's pretty particular about
the cars he wants.

1155
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:44,417
He knows a lot more
about cars than l do.

1156
01:03:44,939 --> 01:03:46,736
Not too fast.

1157
01:03:51,779 --> 01:03:56,216
We started last September, October,
having meetings with Michael,

1158
01:03:56,299 --> 01:04:00,338
trying to figure out what the Autobots
would be, what vehicles we would use.

1159
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:04,697
And we downloaded every picture
of every car that was available.

1160
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:11,848
We started addressing
the major car companies.

1161
01:04:12,819 --> 01:04:15,174
When you're making
a movie for 1 45 million,

1162
01:04:15,419 --> 01:04:20,493
which sounds like a lot of money,
it was tough to fit this movie in that box.

1163
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:23,047
And you couldn't afford to do
this movie without a sponsorship,

1164
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:26,017
and nobody can come up
with what GM has.

1165
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:29,933
For us, it is about the sexiness
of their cars.

1166
01:04:30,699 --> 01:04:33,657
l went to GM and l got into
their Skunkworks there.

1167
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:35,570
lt's a place,
l can't tell you where it is

1168
01:04:35,659 --> 01:04:39,208
but that's where they make
their stealthy concept cars.

1169
01:04:39,299 --> 01:04:42,257
But l saw this car, and they didn't know
what kind of car it was going to be.

1170
01:04:42,339 --> 01:04:45,012
But now it's a Camaro.
And what l liked about it,

1171
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:48,136
it kind of had a retro look,
it was a muscle car

1172
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:50,494
and just, right then and there
l knew it was Bumblebee.

1173
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:54,848
Bumblebee was, in the '80s,
a Volkswagen Bug.

1174
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:59,937
And his role has always been
the younger of the Autobots.

1175
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:03,978
We knew that he was originally
a Volkswagen and a Beetle.

1176
01:05:04,059 --> 01:05:05,731
But it was not really
an option for Michael

1177
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,537
because it wasn't badass enough.

1178
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:10,736
l just was never going to use
the Volkswagen Bug for Bumblebee.

1179
01:05:10,819 --> 01:05:14,892
lt just wasn't going to be in my cars.
lt reminded me of Herbie The Love Bug.

1180
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:16,492
But we do make
nod to it in the movie

1181
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,288
because if you notice, in the parking lot,
the Camaro's parked next to a Bug.

1182
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:22,536
This is a classic engine
right here.

1183
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,610
l sold a car the other day...

1184
01:05:25,779 --> 01:05:26,973
Oh, my God.

1185
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:31,972
Bumblebee, we said,
''As long as he's yellow

1186
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:37,213
''let's find some cues that will hearken
back to what people remember,

1187
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:40,928
''but let's not have that
be as far as you can go.''

1188
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:46,088
l think the old Camaro
was really cool

1189
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:49,057
and, you know,
it's a nice beater car.

1190
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:51,209
The quintessential Camaro is the '69.

1191
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:54,097
There's been a million of them
hot- rodded.

1192
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:59,572
So l wanted to find the cheesiest version of
the Camaro that'd be perfect

1193
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:02,412
for this kid's first car.
He didn't have any money.

1194
01:06:02,499 --> 01:06:05,172
He would never go out
and be able to afford a '69.

1195
01:06:05,259 --> 01:06:09,889
This is a Camaro, a 1 977 Camaro.
Nobody wanted them,

1196
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:12,368
nobody needs them,
they're hard to find.

1197
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:14,654
This one was pulled out
of Palmdale,

1198
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:17,572
the other two were pulled out
of Oklahoma.

1199
01:06:17,659 --> 01:06:21,368
We're gonna redo them, repaint them,
new engines, everything redone,

1200
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:25,611
so that Kenny Bates can drive the heck out
of them through his stunts.

1201
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:32,331
So this was the perfect dichotomy for
the new Camaro when he re- scans.

1202
01:06:32,419 --> 01:06:35,570
Why does he transform back into
this piece- of- crap Camaro?

1203
01:06:45,819 --> 01:06:48,731
That Camaro is really spectacular.

1204
01:06:48,819 --> 01:06:51,811
l wish they would bring it out
earlier than they are.

1205
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:55,491
There were only two Camaros
that were hand- built by GM.

1206
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:58,696
To fix that car is a big deal.
lf you smash a fender,

1207
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:01,771
you just don't get another Bumblebee fender
'cause there aren't any.

1208
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:03,815
All the parts were individually made.

1209
01:07:03,899 --> 01:07:05,048
lt's a three- stage paint.

1210
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:07,528
lf you get a ding in the door
you have to paint the whole door.

1211
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:09,496
Pretty trick door latch.

1212
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:18,132
No indent, no recessed area.
Everything's slick.

1213
01:07:19,699 --> 01:07:22,259
l mean, it's a $500,000 car.

1214
01:07:22,339 --> 01:07:25,775
So it's not like,
''Hey, have...Go around the...'' You know.

1215
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:27,053
Didn't happen like that.

1216
01:07:27,139 --> 01:07:29,937
lt's, ''Wipe your feet off
before you get into the car.''

1217
01:07:30,019 --> 01:07:32,328
''Keep your hands
on the steering wheel.''

1218
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:33,488
You push down at a certain rate.

1219
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:34,853
You want me to go faster?

1220
01:07:34,939 --> 01:07:38,215
l'm just nervous about the car.
l can go faster if you want.

1221
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:43,778
You are not a stunt driver, okay?

1222
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,009
This is where we were parked,
originally.

1223
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:50,331
- You can say everything you want.
- Michael, oh, my goodness gracious!

1224
01:07:50,419 --> 01:07:53,252
- Let's go, come on.
- All right, right here, in the centre.

1225
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:57,332
lf l crash into the wall, it's not my fault,
because l'm an actor.

1226
01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:03,177
lt should be like this,
the transformation, one, two, three. Okay?

1227
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:09,494
Hey, guys, transforming on three.
l'm gonna go, ''One, two, three.'' Okay?

1228
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:13,489
- Ready?
- Yeah, Michael.

1229
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:15,012
Ready.

1230
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:18,171
Three, two, one, go!

1231
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:29,734
Jazz is a character
that was always a sports car.

1232
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:33,653
Now he's not a Porsche 91 1 any more,
he's a Pontiac Solstice,

1233
01:08:33,739 --> 01:08:35,889
but he's still a cool sport car.

1234
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:43,409
We had a little company
do some aftermarket.

1235
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:50,858
We made a hard top for it.
We put the little ground effects, fairings.

1236
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:54,011
We put a little spoiler on the back
and some louvers on the hood.

1237
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:56,055
And we kind of just jazzed it up
a little bit.

1238
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:06,098
Ratchet, in the '80s,
was an ambulance.

1239
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:09,489
But it was more of
a van- shaped ambulance.

1240
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:12,810
lt was more of a Japanese version
of what an ambulance is.

1241
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:22,013
Ratchet was the H2- based ambulance
which doesn't exist.

1242
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,818
So we designed and
built it from scratch.

1243
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:32,051
We started with a stock GM H2 Hummer
which we gutted

1244
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:37,088
and took all of the existing components
from the rear apart.

1245
01:09:37,179 --> 01:09:40,615
And then we're building the cages
that will be sheeted

1246
01:09:40,699 --> 01:09:45,375
to look as the search- and- rescue
vehicle should.

1247
01:09:45,459 --> 01:09:48,610
Also applying all of the roll bars,
roll cages,

1248
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:52,169
the heavy- duty bumpers to give it
that beefy look,

1249
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:55,615
wheel and tyre packages,
and the accessories

1250
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:59,578
that will fall in line with
a search- and- rescue vehicle.

1251
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:17,452
lronhide was this big 4500 Series GMC.

1252
01:10:18,579 --> 01:10:23,050
They're brand new, they just came out,
and they gave us three of them.

1253
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:25,653
We got them from the factory, black.
l made that tailgate

1254
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:29,334
that had that Autobot logo embossed
into it, added the stacks,

1255
01:10:29,419 --> 01:10:33,378
and all the running board, and
modified the bumpers and stuff.

1256
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:35,973
That truck, unless you're standing
next to it, you have no idea.

1257
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:40,098
lt's so big, it's crazy. lt's like
the biggest thing you ever saw.

1258
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:43,412
There's Optimus.

1259
01:10:47,379 --> 01:10:52,248
l saw a picture of a truck and
it was lowered and it was blue

1260
01:10:52,339 --> 01:10:56,173
and it had flames on it. And l'm like,
''That's Optimus Prime.''

1261
01:11:01,339 --> 01:11:05,127
With Optimus, literally, we got
every car book, every car picture,

1262
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:07,858
l mean,
it was just all over the walls.

1263
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:13,697
We looked at the cartoon,
thank you very much.

1264
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:17,215
And then we just started pulling
references of different big rigs.

1265
01:11:17,299 --> 01:11:19,733
Because this is what we were always...
Everybody in this department

1266
01:11:19,819 --> 01:11:22,287
was conceptualising
how Optimus is masked,

1267
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,813
what he came out of.
This is the main dude.

1268
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:26,969
- We should go look at it.
- Okay.

1269
01:11:27,059 --> 01:11:29,857
lnstead of buying a new truck
that's a $1 50,000 truck,

1270
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:33,249
we bought some older trucks,
and they were pretty beat up

1271
01:11:33,339 --> 01:11:34,533
and they were pretty ugly- looking.

1272
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:37,418
l mean, this is like a redo.

1273
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:39,569
- You know what l mean, lan?
- Yeah.

1274
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:42,974
How are they ever going to
make this thing look like that?

1275
01:11:43,059 --> 01:11:46,369
l said, ''Just trust me. This is the truck
that should be Optimus Prime.

1276
01:11:46,459 --> 01:11:48,689
''Not a new truck. This is the one.''

1277
01:11:48,779 --> 01:11:53,330
So we're gonna completely
strip it, paint it, flame job.

1278
01:11:53,419 --> 01:11:57,731
New fenders, new sleeper,
new bumpers, lights...

1279
01:11:57,819 --> 01:12:00,379
And when it comes out,
it will be beautiful.

1280
01:12:28,539 --> 01:12:31,337
There's been some debate about
some of the changes that were made.

1281
01:12:31,419 --> 01:12:33,694
The flames on the side of the car
and the fact that it's a long- nosed

1282
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:36,771
- instead of a flat- nosed truck.
- l like the flames.

1283
01:12:36,859 --> 01:12:41,410
And what the flames did
when he was transformed,

1284
01:12:41,499 --> 01:12:45,651
it kind of looked like ribs
and to me it looked cool.

1285
01:12:48,339 --> 01:12:51,251
One of the things l've learnt is red
doesn't photograph well

1286
01:12:51,339 --> 01:12:55,571
for the feature films, the light being
what it is, and it's a nightmare.

1287
01:12:55,659 --> 01:12:57,934
Michael Bay was nice enough to
explain that to me.

1288
01:12:58,019 --> 01:13:02,410
So we made this compromise
where we wanted a red chest,

1289
01:13:02,499 --> 01:13:06,731
and we did that by the flames, so that
we could still retain the essence

1290
01:13:06,819 --> 01:13:10,858
of Optimus being a red truck
while still making it easy to shoot.

1291
01:13:14,659 --> 01:13:18,652
Just a much more aggressive- looking truck,
it's more Duel,

1292
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:21,890
more of an homage to Steven,
looks better on a wide angle

1293
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:26,018
when it extends back. lt's just more
of a badass- looking thing

1294
01:13:26,099 --> 01:13:29,091
than a flat- fronted trash truck.

1295
01:13:32,299 --> 01:13:35,769
And again, it goes back to that thing of
when you actually see it,

1296
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:37,531
and you see what's required of
the transformations

1297
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:40,656
and the level of detail,
we weren't going to be able to have

1298
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:42,969
as exciting a transformation with
the flat nose.

1299
01:13:43,059 --> 01:13:46,847
Okay guys, let's stop admiring
the truck. Let's shoot, shall we?

1300
01:13:50,299 --> 01:13:52,654
Let's set up for this,
please, back to one, Jerry.

1301
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:57,494
This movie, l had more cooperation from GM
than any movie l've ever made.

1302
01:13:57,579 --> 01:14:01,254
They promised us they'd give us
the flood- damaged cars,

1303
01:14:01,339 --> 01:14:03,978
the non- saleable cars,
the cars that Michael Bay

1304
01:14:04,059 --> 01:14:07,938
needs to wreck every day
on a daily basis for his food chain.

1305
01:14:08,379 --> 01:14:11,212
...four, three, two, one.

1306
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:38,173
We burnt, crashed,

1307
01:14:42,379 --> 01:14:43,494
flipped...

1308
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:47,254
Three, two, one, fire!

1309
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,496
...probably close to 200 cars.

1310
01:14:58,259 --> 01:15:01,092
We had 30 or 40 cars sent to
the shop

1311
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:03,818
and stripped the engines
and transmissions out

1312
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:08,450
and put the pick points on them and
the plates on them for us to flip and throw.

1313
01:15:08,779 --> 01:15:13,216
And we'd do that all on the day
wherever X marks the spot.

1314
01:15:13,779 --> 01:15:16,737
We have this catapult
and we'd just run a cable off,

1315
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:21,609
hook it up to the car and then with
the use of high- pressure nitrogen

1316
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:23,894
we can fire...
lt's the same way,

1317
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:25,731
a plane is launched from
an aircraft carrier.

1318
01:15:26,059 --> 01:15:29,210
We do the exact same thing,
only on a smaller scale.

1319
01:15:29,419 --> 01:15:32,172
And it's all portable.
We'll take that anywhere on the set

1320
01:15:32,259 --> 01:15:35,535
Michael wants to go
and we'll launch cars.

1321
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:38,372
lt's screaming everywhere,
it's screaming. Ready,

1322
01:15:38,459 --> 01:15:40,097
and roll cameras.

1323
01:15:44,659 --> 01:15:47,127
Ready and three,

1324
01:15:47,219 --> 01:15:49,369
two, one, action!

1325
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:51,012
Screaming!

1326
01:16:13,459 --> 01:16:14,858
Don't go in the building!

1327
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:25,378
Thank you very much.

1328
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:30,731
No one does car chases
better than Michael.

1329
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:34,129
l mean, they're incredible.
They're at Mach three

1330
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:36,494
and you feel like you're right
in the middle of them.

1331
01:16:37,779 --> 01:16:40,976
One of my shooting styles is
using this little go- cart thing.

1332
01:16:41,059 --> 01:16:43,368
Where it goes very fast,
like 1 00 miles an hour

1333
01:16:43,459 --> 01:16:47,372
and it's a very small vibrating camera
that's real low to the ground.

1334
01:16:48,899 --> 01:16:51,049
Looks like a suicide vehicle.

1335
01:16:54,379 --> 01:16:58,816
And we use that for anything from running
down the street to chasing cars.

1336
01:17:00,379 --> 01:17:03,815
lt's a very powerful tool for getting in
and around and close to the action.

1337
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:04,934
We use it quite a bit.

1338
01:17:13,739 --> 01:17:17,049
- l'm scared.
- Fun, huh?

1339
01:17:17,139 --> 01:17:20,814
- All right, let's not clip it, now.
- Thank you.

1340
01:17:20,899 --> 01:17:22,571
Play that back again.

1341
01:17:22,659 --> 01:17:26,129
lt's pretty crazy being in the go- cart
because you're responding quick.

1342
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:29,529
And any mistake and you could
be in a lot of trouble.

1343
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:40,694
Five, four,

1344
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:45,409
three, two, one.

1345
01:17:47,819 --> 01:17:50,253
l'll tell you, l'm never gonna be doing
another highway chase again,

1346
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:54,810
because l've now done highway chases
till the cows come home.

1347
01:17:54,899 --> 01:17:58,892
l want it to transform right
under the on ramp. All right?

1348
01:17:58,979 --> 01:18:01,129
So the next on ramp is where
we're gonna start the transformation.

1349
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:02,937
- Okay.
- The highway chase is huge.

1350
01:18:03,019 --> 01:18:05,613
l mean, we have tumbling cars,
we have crashing cars,

1351
01:18:05,699 --> 01:18:09,374
we've got cars upside down
hitting cars, we've got scraping cars.

1352
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:11,973
But this one will top most of
the ones l've ever done.

1353
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:15,017
Because now, you've got robots
transforming at 80 miles an hour

1354
01:18:15,099 --> 01:18:19,012
on a freeway, and l don't know
how you can top anything like that.

1355
01:18:20,099 --> 01:18:22,249
- All right, let's go and try one, shall we?
- Yeah.

1356
01:18:22,339 --> 01:18:24,489
We tried to put the audience
inside the action.

1357
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:28,538
So they're actually eating cars,
they're actually in the crash.

1358
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:33,338
Come on, let's go.
Bay Buster follow me. Watch out.

1359
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:40,209
We used the Bay Buster,
that crazy triangle car

1360
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:43,974
that can actually
take direct hits from cars.

1361
01:18:44,059 --> 01:18:48,098
The Bay Buster is a pickup truck
with the cage on the outside of it.

1362
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:50,932
They mount anywhere
from 2 to 4 cameras on the front.

1363
01:18:51,019 --> 01:18:56,093
And if we have flipping cars or cars
being thrown off the top of car carriers,

1364
01:18:56,179 --> 01:18:58,977
we normally drive the Bay Buster
right into them.

1365
01:19:01,179 --> 01:19:03,773
That's great for the audience.
That's part of that ''eat the action''

1366
01:19:03,859 --> 01:19:06,248
that the audience gets to see,
that's not CGl.

1367
01:19:06,339 --> 01:19:09,854
lt's like most directors would have
chose when we ripped that bus,

1368
01:19:09,939 --> 01:19:12,931
which is an extremely dangerous stunt,
l mean really dangerous.

1369
01:19:13,019 --> 01:19:14,498
Most would have just done it

1370
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:19,130
either miniature or CG.
And it just wouldn't look as good.

1371
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:25,047
The bus sequence is something
that we've never done before.

1372
01:19:25,139 --> 01:19:28,609
And l really had to push to
get that to happen.

1373
01:19:28,699 --> 01:19:34,729
That bus, we have six exploding bolts
holding the cab together in the centre,

1374
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:38,778
at the centre of the bus, and
then we have big cables underneath

1375
01:19:38,859 --> 01:19:43,330
pulling it together, holding it together.
We cut the cables, we blow the bolts,

1376
01:19:43,419 --> 01:19:48,254
and the actual bus cracks in half
like an egg in two pieces.

1377
01:19:48,339 --> 01:19:50,728
There's a stunt driver
who drives the front away.

1378
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:53,253
Because it's going to drop down
on another set of wheels

1379
01:19:53,339 --> 01:19:55,136
so he can still control it.
And then the back half

1380
01:19:55,219 --> 01:20:00,009
has those same cannons in it
that we're gonna fire at 1 ,1 00 PSl,

1381
01:20:00,099 --> 01:20:03,887
three cannons and the back half of
the bus is gonna flip away.

1382
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:05,537
- Wow.
- lt's gonna be really cool.

1383
01:20:05,619 --> 01:20:08,417
We're gonna pop the cable,
which is the first cable pulling it.

1384
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:10,171
Then there's another cable
wrapped around him,

1385
01:20:10,259 --> 01:20:14,047
and it's gonna take about three seconds
for that bus to pull like that.

1386
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:15,970
And then we blow the thing.

1387
01:20:16,059 --> 01:20:18,209
Once we pop the cable
it's all automatic.

1388
01:20:18,299 --> 01:20:19,891
Richard, you have
the bomb in your hand?

1389
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:21,697
l have the button on the floor, yes.

1390
01:20:21,779 --> 01:20:23,531
- Okay, so Richard...
- Who else will be there?

1391
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:28,488
Releasing the first cable when the bus
comes out from under the bridge

1392
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:30,376
and gets into the sun.

1393
01:20:43,699 --> 01:20:45,929
Come on, Dan, let's start
your vehicle and have it started,

1394
01:20:46,019 --> 01:20:48,135
'cause we're moving into position,
right now.

1395
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:52,094
Move those cars forward,
gang, please.

1396
01:20:53,259 --> 01:20:58,094
So we put Richard Epper in the bus
and l drove the Bay Bomber

1397
01:20:58,179 --> 01:21:00,409
and chased it with four cameras
on the front end.

1398
01:21:00,499 --> 01:21:02,615
But no one really knew
what the bus was gonna do.

1399
01:21:54,339 --> 01:21:57,092
Hey, Kenny, how'd it go, man?

1400
01:21:57,179 --> 01:21:59,568
l think it went pretty good.
Cut in half, right, Nick?

1401
01:21:59,659 --> 01:22:01,058
- Yeah, l know.
- You've got half the bus here

1402
01:22:01,139 --> 01:22:03,050
and half of it is over there.

1403
01:22:03,139 --> 01:22:04,288
l think it worked out really well.

1404
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:07,018
And l think it's because Effects did
an excellent job

1405
01:22:07,099 --> 01:22:11,490
on prepping that bus for us.
So it's like, those guys are the guys

1406
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:12,728
that made us look good
on that one.

1407
01:22:12,819 --> 01:22:15,936
The main thing is, my good friend
Richard Epper is safe

1408
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:19,489
and that's all l think about
going down there.

1409
01:22:20,099 --> 01:22:21,248
ln the end, it's just a movie.

1410
01:22:21,339 --> 01:22:24,490
But it's a Michael Bay movie
and that's what we do.

1411
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:27,571
You get the bang for the buck
when you're with Michael.

1412
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:37,936
Actually, no one was hurt on this movie.
We've had a really spotless track record

1413
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,214
for such a long time.

1414
01:22:40,299 --> 01:22:43,291
And knock on wood, because,
by the way,

1415
01:22:43,379 --> 01:22:44,653
it's just a dangerous business.

1416
01:22:44,739 --> 01:22:47,651
What we do,
what they're doing is dangerous.

1417
01:23:03,919 --> 01:23:06,433
Which one of those do you
think was a Decepticon?

1418
01:23:08,519 --> 01:23:09,998
Maybe one, maybe none.

1419
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,874
Decepticons are actually very fun
'cause they're just wicked.

1420
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:21,437
lt seemed to serve the story
better to have military vehicles

1421
01:23:21,559 --> 01:23:24,392
being the real theme of
the Decepticons as opposed to

1422
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,710
too many tape decks,
or a gun, or things that were

1423
01:23:27,799 --> 01:23:29,915
clever and great in the cartoon

1424
01:23:29,999 --> 01:23:31,955
but a little bit unfocused
for our purposes.

1425
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,432
Michael has a pretty
good relationship with the DOD,

1426
01:23:36,519 --> 01:23:38,316
and so it was kind of interesting
that we were using...

1427
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,869
All the military in this movie
in the robot form are bad guys.

1428
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:50,758
l'll be honest. l had to sort of pitch
this to my chain of command

1429
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:54,190
in that there's
Air Force aircraft as bad guys.

1430
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,952
All right, ready?
And the first two, go!

1431
01:23:57,039 --> 01:23:58,392
Go, go, go!

1432
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:01,277
Because of Michael's relationships
in the past and, you know,

1433
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:03,475
Armageddon and other films he's done,

1434
01:24:03,559 --> 01:24:07,711
the thought was that ideally we'd get
the help of the Armed Forces in the end.

1435
01:24:07,799 --> 01:24:10,233
You see, the Air Force cameraman,
l keep trying to tell him...

1436
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:13,675
Turn, turn, let me show it to you.
We're trying to change the style.

1437
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,596
See, he's a little rigid.
Everything is like this.

1438
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,876
He looks like that, walks
like that. lt's rigid.

1439
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:21,519
Look, now we got a little
MTV style going.

1440
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:24,113
See, by lunch he's got
a little MTV style going.

1441
01:24:24,199 --> 01:24:27,316
And he loves the military.
He knows how to portray the military

1442
01:24:27,399 --> 01:24:30,835
to make us look good and
so it seemed like a win- win.

1443
01:24:30,919 --> 01:24:33,956
And people love bad guys.
The fact is, l mean,

1444
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:36,109
what's cooler than Darth Vader?

1445
01:24:36,199 --> 01:24:39,555
l've always been, like, some of
the first to shoot military hardware.

1446
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:42,233
And in Armageddon, l was
the first to shoot the B- 2 bomber.

1447
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:44,628
Then this movie was the F- 22s,

1448
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,837
which are the new $1 30 million,
amazing stealth fighters.

1449
01:24:51,959 --> 01:24:56,555
Starscream was an F- 1 5 Air Force jet
back in the early cartoon days.

1450
01:24:56,919 --> 01:24:59,114
And back then,
the F- 1 5 in the '80s

1451
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,588
was the quickest and the fastest
and the baddest thing around.

1452
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:05,718
Well, fast- forward 25 years,
the F- 22 is now that aircraft.

1453
01:25:05,799 --> 01:25:09,553
- Rolling. Ready?
- And roll cameras. Roll cameras.

1454
01:25:09,639 --> 01:25:12,949
Ready and action.

1455
01:25:18,799 --> 01:25:21,916
There you go. Look at that.
Let's do that again.

1456
01:25:21,999 --> 01:25:24,035
Reset. Very good work,
everybody. Reset.

1457
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,234
Let's do that one more time.

1458
01:25:25,319 --> 01:25:27,037
What the Air Force
has done in this

1459
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:29,917
show is shown us
all of the good toys.

1460
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:33,674
Brandy new stuff that really hasn't
even been put into the field yet.

1461
01:25:35,559 --> 01:25:38,198
ls there any hand signals that
the crew guys in the front give?

1462
01:25:38,279 --> 01:25:40,110
Anything you give at all?
Any hand signals?

1463
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:41,188
Yeah.

1464
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:42,678
All right. l want to do
some hand signals.

1465
01:25:42,759 --> 01:25:45,990
We're gonna come right by you.
Guys, go back to the crew.

1466
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:48,149
What kind of signals
do you guys give?

1467
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:51,515
That aircraft is just...
lt's just phenomenal what it can do.

1468
01:25:51,599 --> 01:25:53,317
There's war games they play
where they'll send,

1469
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:57,597
you know, three or four of
those things out against 20 or so

1470
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:01,911
current F- 1 5, F- 1 6s, and
it's not even a contest.

1471
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:03,352
Target lD.

1472
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:06,758
And they can fire at enemies that
are beyond the curvature of the Earth.

1473
01:26:06,839 --> 01:26:10,468
They can track and fire on things
that are 270 miles away.

1474
01:26:10,559 --> 01:26:12,948
So they can...Those guys are dead
before they're even within

1475
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:14,950
visual contact of that plane.

1476
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:18,827
So it's just very fitting that Starscream,
who is the Air Commander

1477
01:26:18,919 --> 01:26:21,717
and second- in- command,
takes that form of, literally,

1478
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:24,597
the baddest weapon system
in the world right now.

1479
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:32,637
We have Blackout,
which is a MH- 53 helicopter.

1480
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,473
lt's a gigantic troop transport.
lt's a mean- looking helicopter.

1481
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:40,837
Just looks bad ass, you know.
The Cobras are kind of slight.

1482
01:26:40,919 --> 01:26:43,274
You know, yeah,
they carry a lot of firepower,

1483
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:45,554
but as far as just looking
big and menacing,

1484
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:48,836
the Sea Stallion was,
like, the logical choice.

1485
01:26:55,079 --> 01:26:57,718
Yeah, l got my fire suit on,
baby. l'm directing.

1486
01:26:57,799 --> 01:26:59,710
Ready! And...

1487
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:03,712
- Seven, six, five, four...
- Seven, six, five, four...

1488
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:13,192
l can't think of anything remotely
this huge that the Air Force

1489
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:16,589
has been involved with,
not only in, you know, screen time,

1490
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:19,068
but just the amount of
aircraft and people

1491
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:21,434
and shooting on bases and
everything that we've done.

1492
01:27:21,519 --> 01:27:24,352
What we're gonna wanna do is,
we wanna stack you guys up,

1493
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:26,634
so, with a long lens,
it'll make you look very close.

1494
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:29,153
You know what l'm saying?
We'll put you kind of like this

1495
01:27:29,239 --> 01:27:33,118
to each other. A little over
there and add a little bit.

1496
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,518
We're stacked up with the sun.

1497
01:27:34,599 --> 01:27:36,271
All right?

1498
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:38,589
- Coming over the tower.
- ...three, zero, zero.

1499
01:27:38,679 --> 01:27:40,829
The tower is actually
a good place to come.

1500
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:42,068
Air Boss, Osprey 1 , sir.

1501
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,627
Do you want aeroplane mode
or conversion mode on this?

1502
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:47,958
Left. Correction, right. Right. To me.

1503
01:27:48,039 --> 01:27:51,156
Come on. Right, right, right.
To me. Right, right.

1504
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:53,514
- Oh, yeah, baby.
- That is the golden glow.

1505
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:54,992
Lower, lower, lower.

1506
01:27:59,799 --> 01:28:01,517
- Bring them down lower.
- Send them away. Turn them around.

1507
01:28:01,599 --> 01:28:03,430
- Turn them around.
- Bring them down. Another pass.

1508
01:28:03,519 --> 01:28:05,350
Another pass. Take it around.

1509
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:09,069
All right, we don't know
where you are, so...

1510
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:13,873
l was also the first to
use the Ospreys,

1511
01:28:13,959 --> 01:28:17,634
which are for extracting soldiers.
lt's kind of like a helicopter plane.

1512
01:28:17,719 --> 01:28:22,793
lt's like these gigantic helicopter blades.
Looks very dangerous, if you ask me.

1513
01:28:22,879 --> 01:28:25,757
And they actually rotate down
and become gigantic propellers

1514
01:28:25,839 --> 01:28:29,275
and go forward and go
about 300- something miles an hour.

1515
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:31,668
- Move back, please.
- That was awesome.

1516
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:39,348
Warthogs were a very
interesting kind of plane

1517
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,873
'cause it's kind of eerie,
'cause they get very low

1518
01:28:41,959 --> 01:28:45,110
and they've just
got this whine to it.

1519
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:47,759
- Are they coming, Josh?
- They are.

1520
01:28:58,439 --> 01:28:59,428
Good.

1521
01:28:59,519 --> 01:29:01,396
Okay, come higher up.
Come higher up.

1522
01:29:01,519 --> 01:29:04,716
Right now, right now, guys.

1523
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:08,189
And it's got a lethal cannon on it.
You know, it's a creepy plane.

1524
01:29:08,279 --> 01:29:09,917
lf you're on the ground,
you don't want to be there

1525
01:29:09,999 --> 01:29:11,671
if it's shooting at you.

1526
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:18,351
The military gave us
the use of the Spooky,

1527
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:21,033
which is a C- 1 30,
specially equipped.

1528
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:22,632
lt's got, like, 1 8 guns.

1529
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,835
lt's the thing they use to
shoot Taliban in Afghanistan.

1530
01:29:24,919 --> 01:29:27,911
lt's a vicious old plane,
but it's very lethal.

1531
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:34,071
The 49th Fighter Wing at
Holloman is the home

1532
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,912
of the stealth fighter,
the F- 1 1 7 Nighthawk.

1533
01:29:36,999 --> 01:29:40,708
Well, they scrambled the stealth fighter.
Like 50 of them staged there,

1534
01:29:40,799 --> 01:29:44,553
so we had them all rolling around,
and it was crazy.

1535
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:48,075
lt's still a very sensitive aircraft,
the technology

1536
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:50,548
that is involved with it
is still very top secret.

1537
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:53,199
l don't want you
filming from that angle, please.

1538
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:55,839
We had to just, basically,
make sure that

1539
01:29:55,919 --> 01:29:58,149
certain protocols were kept in mind.

1540
01:29:58,239 --> 01:29:59,718
That you couldn't film it
that way,

1541
01:29:59,799 --> 01:30:01,790
you couldn't get close to it
this way.

1542
01:30:01,879 --> 01:30:04,518
And once again,
their production bent over backwards

1543
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:06,271
to make sure that
they followed all the rules.

1544
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:09,556
Our tax dollars happily at work.

1545
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:12,597
One of the things that
a lot of people don't understand

1546
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:15,477
that all military support is
on a cost basis.

1547
01:30:15,559 --> 01:30:18,312
This cost the taxpayer
absolutely nothing.

1548
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:19,912
The movie pays for

1549
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:23,429
any costs of the aircraft
and personnel

1550
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:26,875
that cannot otherwise be
used in training missions.

1551
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:31,948
lf a helicopter is flying and it costs
X number of dollars per hour to fly

1552
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:35,076
that helicopter,
the production company reimburses it.

1553
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,710
The technology that
the government allowed us to be around

1554
01:30:44,799 --> 01:30:46,027
and some of the tools
they allowed us to use,

1555
01:30:46,119 --> 01:30:48,792
you wouldn't be able to get
anywhere else in the world.

1556
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:53,276
These are target practise tanks.

1557
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:57,511
What they do is, this one is
a mock- up of a fake foreign tank,

1558
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:01,069
so that targeting systems
could pick out friend or foe

1559
01:31:01,639 --> 01:31:05,552
when they shoot them
in the missile test range.

1560
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:08,472
At Holloman they have
what is known as a tank graveyard.

1561
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:12,154
And there's probably 1 ,000 tanks and
self- propelled artillery pieces

1562
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:13,718
and stuff like that.

1563
01:31:13,799 --> 01:31:16,916
And the first time l took Michael in there,
he was like a kid at Christmas.

1564
01:31:16,999 --> 01:31:18,318
lt was like, ''Can l have that?
Can l have that?

1565
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:20,788
''Can l burn that?
Can l blow that up?''

1566
01:31:20,879 --> 01:31:22,437
Absolutely, anything you want.

1567
01:31:39,759 --> 01:31:41,158
Set! Fire!

1568
01:31:49,799 --> 01:31:51,471
- Anything?
- Yeah, it was all right.

1569
01:31:51,559 --> 01:31:52,628
- Peace?
- Peace.

1570
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,232
- Violent.
- Yeah.

1571
01:32:00,919 --> 01:32:04,355
The tank was something that had already
been modified by another show.

1572
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:07,158
Somebody owned it,
all right, so we modified it

1573
01:32:07,239 --> 01:32:08,831
and came up with
a cool paint job.

1574
01:32:08,919 --> 01:32:12,548
lt was a cool,
kind of non- radar detectible

1575
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,756
paint job that was based on some
camo that we saw on this

1576
01:32:15,839 --> 01:32:17,989
futuristic battleship image.

1577
01:32:31,919 --> 01:32:33,750
We found on the lnternet

1578
01:32:33,839 --> 01:32:36,911
this minesweeper that the military uses,
they send to lraq.

1579
01:32:36,999 --> 01:32:39,069
lt's very cool.
lt's called a Buffalo.

1580
01:32:39,159 --> 01:32:40,308
But we call it Bonecrusher.

1581
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:43,072
How fast does that Bonecrusher go,
by the way?

1582
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:46,231
- Fifty.
- lt must take forever to get there, right?

1583
01:32:46,919 --> 01:32:49,877
The image that they used to promote
this vehicle had this shot

1584
01:32:49,959 --> 01:32:53,508
of this arm extended and
this big multi- tined fork

1585
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:57,672
foreground in the shot. And
we finally get the data on this machine

1586
01:32:57,759 --> 01:33:00,273
and it turns out that this fork

1587
01:33:00,359 --> 01:33:02,395
is, like, 1 4- inches wide.

1588
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:04,549
And they totally cheated
the whole thing in Photoshop.

1589
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,834
This giant thing coming at you,
you know,

1590
01:33:06,919 --> 01:33:09,558
that looks like it
could lift up a bus,

1591
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:11,711
is, like, this big.

1592
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:16,714
We were, like, what the...You know,
so we basically made this appliance

1593
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:18,915
that goes over the existing one

1594
01:33:18,999 --> 01:33:21,832
that more replicates
the version of the machine

1595
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:24,877
that we had been reacting to.

1596
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:31,959
Originally,
the police car was an Autobot.

1597
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:34,951
lt seemed like to keep it
with our theme of...

1598
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,475
All the Decepticons seem to take on
the disguises of authoritarian vehicles,

1599
01:33:38,559 --> 01:33:42,677
military jet, tank, police car.

1600
01:33:42,759 --> 01:33:44,829
lt seemed like a good change.

1601
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:46,955
So Barricade's in there as a police car.

1602
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:49,475
Slide the headlight forward and
then bring the other arm over.

1603
01:33:49,559 --> 01:33:50,878
Overtake the headlight.

1604
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:53,154
- The idea being to start...
- Spin its little eye a little.

1605
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:59,834
Barricade is a really fun character.
He's wicked and mean.

1606
01:33:59,919 --> 01:34:02,228
Okay! All right!
Okay! Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1607
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:06,107
l'm sorry. Oh, God! Oh, God! Okay!
All right! Okay! Look! Look! Look!

1608
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:07,791
Stop! Stop!

1609
01:34:14,839 --> 01:34:17,433
One of the first thoughts we had, of course,
was to include Soundwave

1610
01:34:17,519 --> 01:34:18,634
in the Decepticons.

1611
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:21,233
And in our first draft,
we actually did have Soundwave.

1612
01:34:21,319 --> 01:34:23,879
We started to realise that we were
not really servicing that character

1613
01:34:23,959 --> 01:34:26,348
in a way that was gonna
make us or fans happy.

1614
01:34:26,439 --> 01:34:28,589
So we said, ''
Rather than doing it wrong,

1615
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:32,194
''let's actually create a character
who is a distant cousin of Soundwave's.''

1616
01:34:32,359 --> 01:34:34,156
And that's how Frenzy was born.

1617
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:37,957
Frenzy, which is a boom box

1618
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:42,669
that transforms into this wicked little,
three- foot- tall, vicious- looking robot.

1619
01:34:42,879 --> 01:34:44,870
This was something that l invented.

1620
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,195
We did an animated Frenzy.

1621
01:34:48,279 --> 01:34:51,316
We wanted to see...l did facial studies
on how its eye stalks moved

1622
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:53,708
and how his mouth moved and
how his mask came out

1623
01:34:53,799 --> 01:34:58,077
of this little boom box, you know,
so we did some exploration with that.

1624
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:02,277
We started
with the computer- designed puppet

1625
01:35:02,359 --> 01:35:04,827
and we had to go back
and retrofit

1626
01:35:04,919 --> 01:35:07,433
and make those things that
look mechanical in design

1627
01:35:07,519 --> 01:35:08,998
actually be mechanical.

1628
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:11,912
Take it apart and kind
of work backwards.

1629
01:35:13,079 --> 01:35:15,798
What they'll do with
the full- sized mechanical version of this

1630
01:35:15,879 --> 01:35:18,313
is that when you bring it to
the set under the lighting conditions

1631
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:20,788
it's also gonna help out
with the CGl guys,

1632
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:24,155
so they could see how
an actual, real item would react

1633
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,274
in that environment.

1634
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:28,431
One, two, three.

1635
01:35:28,519 --> 01:35:30,430
Mostly, it's something to
interact with the actors,

1636
01:35:30,519 --> 01:35:33,955
'cause they would have to be
fighting against nothing.

1637
01:35:36,999 --> 01:35:41,038
lt's from the Robot Spring Collection.
lt's real nice.

1638
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:44,395
lt's a new scarf
DreamWorks bought me.

1639
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:46,549
l just put it on
when l get cold outside.

1640
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:47,867
That's all that this is.

1641
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:06,039
l am Megatron.

1642
01:36:09,759 --> 01:36:12,557
There's more
where that came from.

1643
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:15,551
Megatron
was represented as a pistol,

1644
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:19,509
a very realistic- looking pistol

1645
01:36:19,599 --> 01:36:22,067
that, in Japan,
actually shot little pellets.

1646
01:36:22,599 --> 01:36:24,237
That mechanism
didn't work in the U.S.,

1647
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:27,231
but that worked well for a villain
in the '80s.

1648
01:36:27,319 --> 01:36:29,549
For us, A,
we didn't want anyone shrinking,

1649
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:32,107
particularly the bad guy.
We realised that for him to do that

1650
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:34,713
would be the equivalent of Darth Vader
turning into his own lightsaber

1651
01:36:34,799 --> 01:36:37,632
and having someone else
swing him around.

1652
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:40,155
lt's a movie. You have to update.

1653
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:43,595
To keep it in the '80s would
be great for the 25 of you on the lnternet.

1654
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:47,515
But for the world, it's like,
you cannot have Megatron as a gun.

1655
01:36:47,759 --> 01:36:50,148
Join them in extinction!

1656
01:36:50,439 --> 01:36:53,795
Megatron transforms into kind of
an alien plane.

1657
01:36:54,799 --> 01:36:57,518
And because he's the most arrogant
and vain of the whole thing

1658
01:36:57,599 --> 01:36:58,998
and because he doesn't have to
really hide,

1659
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:02,037
he's one of the only Decepticons
who actually goes from his protoform

1660
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:04,633
right into his alien jet protoform.

1661
01:37:07,879 --> 01:37:10,598
What came up was just
designing this kind of alien craft.

1662
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:14,194
lt would hearken to
what is happening on Cybertron.

1663
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:18,477
So this was a way to show
how truly foreign these guys are.

1664
01:37:33,219 --> 01:37:36,609
l want these robots to look
like they fit in the real world

1665
01:37:36,699 --> 01:37:39,736
and look like
it's photo- real right now.

1666
01:37:39,819 --> 01:37:43,334
The only thing that looks a little winky
is that thing. lt just looks like a...

1667
01:37:43,419 --> 01:37:44,408
Too thin?

1668
01:37:44,499 --> 01:37:46,410
Yeah, it just looks
like surgery equipment.

1669
01:37:46,499 --> 01:37:47,488
All right, cool.

1670
01:37:47,579 --> 01:37:49,012
Okay, guys, that's about all
the time. lt's 1 2:00.

1671
01:37:49,099 --> 01:37:50,771
lt's time to go.
Time to go. Time to go.

1672
01:37:50,859 --> 01:37:52,417
- One more thing, right here.
- l got a lot more...to do.

1673
01:37:52,499 --> 01:37:54,649
You can't abuse me. You're abusing me.
That's abusing my time.

1674
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:56,331
- That was the plan.
- You're taking advantage.

1675
01:37:56,419 --> 01:37:59,456
ln terms of our effects,
we had lndustrial Light and Magic

1676
01:37:59,539 --> 01:38:02,690
that were heading up Transformers,
and we had Digital Domain,

1677
01:38:02,779 --> 01:38:05,293
which is an effects company
that l recently purchased.

1678
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:07,893
Both companies did the work
for this movie.

1679
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:19,612
lt's a bad dream.

1680
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:27,654
lLM did three quarters, and
Digital Domain did the last quarter.

1681
01:38:29,379 --> 01:38:33,975
For us in the visual effects world,
having giant robots to animate

1682
01:38:34,859 --> 01:38:38,374
had a lot of really great potential.
Something to really look forward to.

1683
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:41,617
They assembled
a great team up there.

1684
01:38:41,699 --> 01:38:43,929
l heard we were the show that
everyone wanted to be on because...

1685
01:38:44,019 --> 01:38:46,055
There were just tons
of Transformer geeks,

1686
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:48,414
so it was like a mob session
to get onto the show.

1687
01:38:48,499 --> 01:38:51,218
l thought l was a huge fan. But
some of the people l've met here

1688
01:38:51,299 --> 01:38:54,211
since we got the project just
blow me away.

1689
01:38:54,299 --> 01:38:57,769
You know, compared to some people
out there, my collection is nothing.

1690
01:38:57,859 --> 01:39:00,134
There's people who have 1 0 times
what l have.

1691
01:39:00,259 --> 01:39:03,376
l'd estimate l have
about six or seven hundred, l think.

1692
01:39:03,539 --> 01:39:07,532
Working on this movie has been this
great full- circle experience for me,

1693
01:39:07,619 --> 01:39:10,053
going from playing
with the toys as a kid

1694
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:13,051
to getting to be a part
of the movie version.

1695
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:16,974
Once we were awarded the job,

1696
01:39:17,139 --> 01:39:20,495
we started developing what the robots
really will look like,

1697
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:22,774
what are all the pieces
gonna look like,

1698
01:39:22,859 --> 01:39:25,248
and we start having modelers,
here at our place,

1699
01:39:25,339 --> 01:39:26,772
start modeling those things,

1700
01:39:26,859 --> 01:39:31,728
because it takes a good four,
five, six months to build one robot.

1701
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:36,973
Michael wanted a level of realism that
required us to go much, much, further

1702
01:39:37,059 --> 01:39:39,414
with the complexity of the robots.

1703
01:39:39,499 --> 01:39:42,536
For instance, l've got a little
Transformer that's on my desk.

1704
01:39:42,619 --> 01:39:44,416
He has 51 pieces in him.

1705
01:39:44,499 --> 01:39:49,971
Our Optimus in the movie has 1 0,1 08 parts
that all have to be hand- made.

1706
01:39:50,059 --> 01:39:53,972
lt's in the computer, but it gives you
some idea of the level of complexity.

1707
01:39:54,059 --> 01:39:56,573
They take photographs
of real automotive parts

1708
01:39:56,659 --> 01:39:58,138
and they kind of scale things in.

1709
01:39:58,219 --> 01:40:03,213
All the Decepticons and Autobots, together,
were about 60,000 pieces

1710
01:40:03,299 --> 01:40:04,573
that all had to move.

1711
01:40:04,939 --> 01:40:06,497
lf the frame has
three robots in it,

1712
01:40:06,579 --> 01:40:09,651
it takes 38 hours to
render one frame of film.

1713
01:40:26,019 --> 01:40:28,294
Nowadays l'm doing
less and less storyboards.

1714
01:40:28,379 --> 01:40:30,893
Animatics are just
becoming a better tool.

1715
01:40:30,979 --> 01:40:33,857
lt is basically a Saturday- morning
cartoon of the movie.

1716
01:40:33,939 --> 01:40:35,975
From that, they'll show
us what's gonna happen.

1717
01:40:36,059 --> 01:40:38,653
You can work out some
very complicated camera moves.

1718
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:42,129
Especially when you're working with
a height difference of 28 feet, 40 feet.

1719
01:40:42,219 --> 01:40:46,849
So you automatically start embracing
ideas of animation and physics,

1720
01:40:46,939 --> 01:40:49,612
and trying to incorporate that
in your little mini- movies.

1721
01:40:49,739 --> 01:40:51,855
lt's a different process of filmmaking.

1722
01:40:51,939 --> 01:40:54,089
This is the first film with Michael Bay
that l've actually worked on

1723
01:40:54,179 --> 01:40:56,329
where the animatics carry
as much weight as the script.

1724
01:40:58,339 --> 01:40:59,328
Watch out!

1725
01:40:59,419 --> 01:41:01,250
Michael is a genius
at making these movies,

1726
01:41:01,339 --> 01:41:03,057
and he knows when
it's gonna be live,

1727
01:41:03,139 --> 01:41:04,891
and he knows when it's gonna
be visual effects.

1728
01:41:04,979 --> 01:41:08,972
He likes to split it up, where it's
partially visual and a lot of live action.

1729
01:41:09,259 --> 01:41:10,408
Action!

1730
01:41:13,939 --> 01:41:15,691
A lot of directors
don't like to go that way

1731
01:41:15,779 --> 01:41:18,418
because it's easier to
go the visual- effects route.

1732
01:41:18,499 --> 01:41:21,809
The great thing about Michael is
he tries to get so much in camera.

1733
01:41:22,259 --> 01:41:24,819
Five, four, three...

1734
01:41:24,899 --> 01:41:27,049
Because what we like to do
is take our visual effects

1735
01:41:27,139 --> 01:41:30,449
and really supplement
what's possible to film.

1736
01:41:30,699 --> 01:41:32,974
But the more real stuff that
he has in each shot,

1737
01:41:33,059 --> 01:41:34,811
the more believable it's gonna be.

1738
01:41:34,899 --> 01:41:38,050
And ready in three,
two, one, jump.

1739
01:41:38,579 --> 01:41:39,853
The big challenge with Transformers

1740
01:41:39,939 --> 01:41:42,658
is that we were working a lot
with robots that weren't really there.

1741
01:41:42,739 --> 01:41:46,891
The robot's got 1 5- foot- long feet,
you know, and 8 feet wide.

1742
01:41:46,979 --> 01:41:51,018
So you have these huge things that you
have to tell the camera people about,

1743
01:41:51,259 --> 01:41:53,090
tell the set people about.

1744
01:41:53,179 --> 01:41:55,852
''You can't have it that close.
He's filling this whole volume.''

1745
01:41:56,139 --> 01:41:58,858
You know, you try telling that to
the guys when they arrive on set,

1746
01:41:58,939 --> 01:42:00,008
and it's like, ''What?''

1747
01:42:00,099 --> 01:42:02,772
At first, everybody kind of in shock.
''What? He's that big?''

1748
01:42:02,859 --> 01:42:05,419
But we had simple tools on set.

1749
01:42:05,499 --> 01:42:07,455
We have our blueprint,
the animatic.

1750
01:42:07,539 --> 01:42:11,168
We have our cheat sheets,
all the sizes of the robots.

1751
01:42:12,299 --> 01:42:14,859
They would bring these poles in,
and everything else is acting

1752
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:18,614
and working around this pole
that will soon be a robot.

1753
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:22,248
We're literally using window- washer
poles to act with, you know?

1754
01:42:22,339 --> 01:42:24,250
And it's a tough thing.

1755
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:26,456
You gotta be in love
with the pole.

1756
01:42:28,139 --> 01:42:31,370
That's been the stretch for me.
lt's a different form of acting.

1757
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:34,047
- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio.

1758
01:42:34,139 --> 01:42:37,051
1 30 digital channels of non- stop,
commercial- free music,

1759
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:39,448
news and entertainment.

1760
01:42:39,539 --> 01:42:42,611
So you talk through the radio,
then, right?

1761
01:42:43,579 --> 01:42:47,891
And a mighty voice will send a message
summoning forth visitors from heaven.

1762
01:42:47,979 --> 01:42:50,812
We all became immediate
fans of Shia LaBeouf,

1763
01:42:50,899 --> 01:42:52,537
because our robots are worth nothing

1764
01:42:52,619 --> 01:42:54,257
if the actors don't interact
with them properly.

1765
01:42:54,619 --> 01:42:58,817
Every day, all day long, my dialogue
was with the A- camera operator.

1766
01:42:58,899 --> 01:43:03,256
Okay, roll on them. Go to profile.

1767
01:43:03,339 --> 01:43:06,058
And our dialogue is with Michael
all the time, ''Let's plan this,''

1768
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:08,209
and you work out
what the move will be.

1769
01:43:08,619 --> 01:43:11,258
- Yeah, you're right where Shia was.
- So you're backing up,

1770
01:43:11,339 --> 01:43:13,455
and we're gonna go,
''Three, two, one,'' you're going,

1771
01:43:13,539 --> 01:43:16,258
and the thing is that you're
backing up like this on the ground

1772
01:43:16,339 --> 01:43:19,809
because you're seeing it kind
of go up in front you, all right?

1773
01:43:19,899 --> 01:43:23,096
lt was a learning curve, l must say.
And he got much better at it.

1774
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:26,731
The surprising thing with the crew is
how quickly they learn.

1775
01:43:26,819 --> 01:43:29,970
l'm trying to help them
imagine the unimaginable.

1776
01:43:30,059 --> 01:43:32,368
Pretty soon everybody starts
to believe that they're there.

1777
01:43:32,459 --> 01:43:35,257
And then you guys are gonna
crawl back that way, 'cause...

1778
01:43:35,579 --> 01:43:36,648
We wanna get out of the way.

1779
01:43:36,739 --> 01:43:38,172
Yeah, you don't wanna get squished.

1780
01:43:53,299 --> 01:43:56,257
Michael was very insistent about
the robots being energetic

1781
01:43:56,339 --> 01:43:59,456
and being able to do
all these acrobatic stunts.

1782
01:44:01,139 --> 01:44:03,050
We wanted to have fighters

1783
01:44:03,139 --> 01:44:06,176
and guys that could manoeuvre in ways
that you'd never seen before.

1784
01:44:06,259 --> 01:44:08,090
We went into this development phase

1785
01:44:08,179 --> 01:44:10,977
of showing how agile
we could make the robots

1786
01:44:11,059 --> 01:44:12,572
and still convey a sense of weight.

1787
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:16,447
And we found that the closer things got to
camera, the faster they could move.

1788
01:44:16,539 --> 01:44:19,007
But when you see the entire robot
at a further distance,

1789
01:44:19,099 --> 01:44:21,408
we had to really slow things
down to help sell their weight.

1790
01:44:21,499 --> 01:44:25,287
l used real stunt fighters.
We'd do fight choreography

1791
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:30,175
with Kenny's guys,
that were great fighters,

1792
01:44:30,259 --> 01:44:32,056
a different type of ninja- type move.

1793
01:44:32,139 --> 01:44:33,288
What we did was
create a fighting style

1794
01:44:33,379 --> 01:44:35,973
that represented the characters
of each robot.

1795
01:44:37,259 --> 01:44:39,329
We would video these fights,
not mo- cap,

1796
01:44:39,419 --> 01:44:42,491
and it would help the animators
get their movements down

1797
01:44:42,579 --> 01:44:45,139
and how we wanted to
execute certain fighting scenes.

1798
01:44:53,939 --> 01:44:57,136
More than anyone,
the animators are so involved

1799
01:44:57,219 --> 01:44:58,538
in bringing these characters to life.

1800
01:44:58,619 --> 01:45:00,928
And the nice thing is, you know,
Michael is open to feedback.

1801
01:45:01,019 --> 01:45:02,452
l'd give them a lot of freedom.

1802
01:45:02,539 --> 01:45:04,530
''So what do you think? What do you
think Optimus would do?''

1803
01:45:04,619 --> 01:45:07,611
And they all know Transformers,
you know, forward and backwards,

1804
01:45:07,699 --> 01:45:09,894
and, you know,
you'll see things in the movie

1805
01:45:09,979 --> 01:45:13,369
that reference the old cartoon,
because they were such big fans of it.

1806
01:45:18,659 --> 01:45:20,570
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1807
01:45:21,179 --> 01:45:24,774
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

1808
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:28,215
We had to get into Michael's head
about who these characters were.

1809
01:45:28,499 --> 01:45:29,773
And believe it or not,

1810
01:45:29,859 --> 01:45:32,453
it's very hard to animate any type
of emotion from a robot

1811
01:45:32,539 --> 01:45:34,097
if you don't have things that move.

1812
01:45:34,179 --> 01:45:35,897
Michael stressed to us
how important it was

1813
01:45:35,979 --> 01:45:38,891
to get the performance
to read in the eyes.

1814
01:45:38,979 --> 01:45:40,810
The majority of the performance
is sold in the eyes.

1815
01:45:40,899 --> 01:45:43,254
The more we added,
it just made it more real

1816
01:45:43,339 --> 01:45:45,250
and felt like
there's a soul in there.

1817
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,728
My name is Optimus Prime.

1818
01:45:47,819 --> 01:45:51,732
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

1819
01:45:57,379 --> 01:45:59,097
We have a lot of
transforming robots.

1820
01:45:59,179 --> 01:46:01,852
l think originally
we started with 1 5 transformations.

1821
01:46:01,939 --> 01:46:04,976
We have over 40 now
in the film.

1822
01:46:05,139 --> 01:46:08,097
ln the original cartoon, you could
have robots kind of transform midair

1823
01:46:08,179 --> 01:46:10,010
and you really wouldn't
care about laws of physics.

1824
01:46:10,259 --> 01:46:12,409
This was almost too easy!

1825
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:15,377
Every single transformation
in this movie is done

1826
01:46:15,459 --> 01:46:18,690
as if these transformations
were actually taking place

1827
01:46:18,779 --> 01:46:20,417
in real space and in real time.

1828
01:46:20,699 --> 01:46:22,098
There's not too many people
in the world

1829
01:46:22,179 --> 01:46:25,012
that could've figured this out.
You know, it takes a real genius

1830
01:46:25,099 --> 01:46:27,738
to be able to disassemble
these things

1831
01:46:27,819 --> 01:46:29,650
and put them back together
in a different shape.

1832
01:46:29,739 --> 01:46:33,288
Yeah, we didn't want to have
metal actually change shape.

1833
01:46:33,379 --> 01:46:35,415
We wanted to find a place
for it on the vehicle,

1834
01:46:35,499 --> 01:46:37,854
and find a place for it that
corresponded with the robot.

1835
01:46:38,139 --> 01:46:41,734
We would really play to camera, like
have all the important pieces show up,

1836
01:46:41,819 --> 01:46:43,889
move, rotate and go back,

1837
01:46:43,979 --> 01:46:47,449
while we were shuffling a bunch
of cards behind the scenes.

1838
01:46:47,779 --> 01:46:50,088
ln the Optimus transformation,
this is the camera move.

1839
01:46:50,179 --> 01:46:53,410
And what we would do on set
is we would put a pole

1840
01:46:53,499 --> 01:46:56,889
representing Optimus's height.
And that's what we start with.

1841
01:46:56,979 --> 01:47:01,211
The next thing we do is we match
the camera move on the computer.

1842
01:47:01,299 --> 01:47:05,338
So this is what Optimus would look like
if he were just standing in the shot,

1843
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:06,772
on the ground.

1844
01:47:06,899 --> 01:47:08,935
So this is the transformation take.

1845
01:47:09,019 --> 01:47:11,852
So it's all happening right
in front of camera,

1846
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:16,012
in front of the audience's eyes.
And you can see the detail.

1847
01:47:16,099 --> 01:47:18,010
We go to the final rendered take,

1848
01:47:20,899 --> 01:47:24,733
you know, there's cast, car parts,
there's engine pieces, there's gears,

1849
01:47:24,819 --> 01:47:28,175
there's headlights, the trailer hitch,
his tyres...

1850
01:47:28,579 --> 01:47:30,774
They could do whatever they
wanted to each individual part.

1851
01:47:37,419 --> 01:47:41,332
Friends of mine that are not in this business
are always kind of nonplussed

1852
01:47:41,419 --> 01:47:43,774
when l tell them that we have to,
in a computer,

1853
01:47:43,859 --> 01:47:47,898
completely recreate every single situation
that we're shooting in.

1854
01:47:47,979 --> 01:47:52,530
What that means is our match- mover,
he's got to be able to come back here,

1855
01:47:53,059 --> 01:47:56,017
and completely reconstruct
that in the computer,

1856
01:47:56,099 --> 01:47:57,373
because the computer doesn't know
where anything is.

1857
01:47:57,659 --> 01:48:00,617
We have spatial marks
out on this area,

1858
01:48:00,699 --> 01:48:02,690
and Duncan, of course,
measures each one.

1859
01:48:03,179 --> 01:48:06,489
Later on, we know exactly
where these spots were,

1860
01:48:06,579 --> 01:48:09,377
'cause we have to rebuild it
wherever he makes contact

1861
01:48:09,459 --> 01:48:11,290
with either the ground
or the objects around.

1862
01:48:11,779 --> 01:48:15,533
So when you see these guys stand
on things and sit on things,

1863
01:48:15,619 --> 01:48:17,257
and bang against things,

1864
01:48:17,339 --> 01:48:20,536
even the buildings that are,
you know, 1 0 story's tall,

1865
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:24,373
all have to be mapped
and measured on set.

1866
01:48:25,579 --> 01:48:29,094
There's a lot involved in making
these vehicles and robots look real.

1867
01:48:29,579 --> 01:48:31,695
We would go out and
take pictures of the tyre tread.

1868
01:48:31,779 --> 01:48:32,928
The treads on our Optimus

1869
01:48:33,019 --> 01:48:35,408
are the same as the treads
on the real truck, you know.

1870
01:48:35,499 --> 01:48:37,410
And the detail,
down to the smallest bolt,

1871
01:48:37,499 --> 01:48:40,650
or the engine block, all that stuff,
we were very meticulous.

1872
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:43,572
You want to see a car driving down
the road, and see it transform,

1873
01:48:43,659 --> 01:48:46,969
and watch it and say,
''Well, those are real car parts.''

1874
01:48:47,059 --> 01:48:50,495
And to me, that's always the most fun
and the most challenging thing,

1875
01:48:50,579 --> 01:48:51,932
is, ''Can we make this stuff look real?''

1876
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:55,376
We did huge packages of,
like, texture reference.

1877
01:48:55,459 --> 01:48:59,896
An abrasion reference for even
the robots internally.

1878
01:48:59,979 --> 01:49:01,776
'Cause we didn't want them
to be so squeaky- clean

1879
01:49:01,859 --> 01:49:03,178
that they were uninteresting.

1880
01:49:03,259 --> 01:49:06,535
So on his hand,
the surface was perfectly smooth,

1881
01:49:06,979 --> 01:49:10,176
and then we add in these scratches
and nicks and dings.

1882
01:49:10,379 --> 01:49:12,449
The hardest part about this film
is we don't have real robots,

1883
01:49:12,539 --> 01:49:13,733
we have real cars.

1884
01:49:13,819 --> 01:49:15,775
And the real cars, they're buffing.

1885
01:49:16,019 --> 01:49:19,489
You look at a real car that's just been
washed and polished and shined up,

1886
01:49:19,579 --> 01:49:21,809
and it almost looks like a CG car.

1887
01:49:21,899 --> 01:49:25,892
So the hard part was trying to
find a balance of dirt and ageing

1888
01:49:25,979 --> 01:49:29,449
to add to the robots that didn't
make it look implausible

1889
01:49:29,539 --> 01:49:32,337
that they could've come
from this very clean car.

1890
01:49:32,419 --> 01:49:34,410
So all the car paints,
l have multiple layers.

1891
01:49:34,499 --> 01:49:37,172
They have a colourful layer,
which is right here,

1892
01:49:37,259 --> 01:49:39,409
you see yellow reflections in here,

1893
01:49:39,499 --> 01:49:42,411
but there's also a clear coat on top of
it, which is supposed to protect it,

1894
01:49:42,499 --> 01:49:45,650
but it also gives you a really
white reflection,

1895
01:49:45,739 --> 01:49:49,095
so you always see a colorful
reflection next to a white reflection.

1896
01:49:52,899 --> 01:49:55,094
Probably two years ago
we couldn't do this movie

1897
01:49:55,179 --> 01:49:56,976
because of lighting
and ray tracing,

1898
01:49:57,299 --> 01:49:58,368
which is a way
you light things.

1899
01:49:58,619 --> 01:50:01,611
We've spent a lot of time
getting the lighting right.

1900
01:50:01,699 --> 01:50:04,452
lt's very complicated to
get all the specularity.

1901
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:06,935
'Cause l'm a lighting buff,
you know,

1902
01:50:07,019 --> 01:50:08,896
and especially shooting
so many car commercials,

1903
01:50:08,979 --> 01:50:11,174
l would give dissertations at lLM

1904
01:50:11,259 --> 01:50:13,568
of, like, ''Okay, if you see a car,
it's gonna have a hot spot,

1905
01:50:13,659 --> 01:50:15,615
''it's got flat here,
it's got more hot spots,

1906
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:17,371
''it's got a long highlight there...''

1907
01:50:17,459 --> 01:50:20,212
And it's very confusing
when you look at it.

1908
01:50:20,299 --> 01:50:22,017
lt's not like just one
soft light on the car.

1909
01:50:22,259 --> 01:50:26,377
So they had to really invent how to
light these things so complicated

1910
01:50:26,459 --> 01:50:27,812
to make them look like
they're moving

1911
01:50:27,899 --> 01:50:30,208
and it's like reflecting
car parts in a real world.

1912
01:50:30,499 --> 01:50:32,569
And so we're always
trying to add that in,

1913
01:50:32,739 --> 01:50:34,889
and we're trying to give
that sort of look to our robots,

1914
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:38,767
and adding glints, and
what he calls pings,

1915
01:50:38,859 --> 01:50:41,532
you know, where you
highlight certain areas.

1916
01:50:41,699 --> 01:50:45,931
These tiny little lights that are
being reflected in the surfaces

1917
01:50:46,019 --> 01:50:47,213
is what he's after.

1918
01:50:47,619 --> 01:50:49,257
That was so interesting for us

1919
01:50:49,339 --> 01:50:53,252
that l think most of us lighting
people became road hazards,

1920
01:50:53,339 --> 01:50:55,250
because we were driving
around looking at other cars.

1921
01:50:55,619 --> 01:50:56,654
The robots are shiny.

1922
01:50:56,739 --> 01:50:59,207
They have glass. They have metal.
They have painted surfaces.

1923
01:50:59,299 --> 01:51:00,778
The entire environment
has to reflect.

1924
01:51:00,859 --> 01:51:04,295
So every single shot has
an environment recorded for it

1925
01:51:04,539 --> 01:51:07,099
that gets now projected
onto the robot.

1926
01:51:07,179 --> 01:51:09,010
Otherwise it will look
phoney- baloney.

1927
01:51:09,259 --> 01:51:11,454
We apply everything
that we've gathered from set,

1928
01:51:11,539 --> 01:51:13,894
which is really high- resolution
environments,

1929
01:51:13,979 --> 01:51:16,937
and everything is being
reflected in the car panels.

1930
01:51:17,019 --> 01:51:19,613
And obviously these robots
are moving around a lot.

1931
01:51:19,699 --> 01:51:22,054
So we're getting a lot of
reflective play on the surfaces,

1932
01:51:22,139 --> 01:51:24,733
since there are major,
major light sources in here,

1933
01:51:24,819 --> 01:51:27,936
from the headlights,
there's the overhead balloon,

1934
01:51:28,019 --> 01:51:30,692
there are the eyeballs in there,
which have to be glowing,

1935
01:51:30,779 --> 01:51:35,295
the blinking lights, we have the blinker
right here, and then the face,

1936
01:51:35,379 --> 01:51:39,088
and his mouth talking is being
reflected in the hood of the car.

1937
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:41,295
And that is what really
sells it at the end.

1938
01:51:41,379 --> 01:51:43,176
That's sort of the icing
on the cake for us.

1939
01:51:44,259 --> 01:51:45,487
Go, fire!

1940
01:51:47,379 --> 01:51:49,847
Our job, and our task,
to create the illusion

1941
01:51:49,939 --> 01:51:52,055
that everything was
just shot on the same day,

1942
01:51:52,139 --> 01:51:54,573
and that these robots,
who aren't even real, were there.

1943
01:51:55,499 --> 01:51:59,811
lLM is known for its really
fabulous level of compositing.

1944
01:52:01,859 --> 01:52:06,649
And these guys just look at
the shot as artists, all day long,

1945
01:52:06,819 --> 01:52:09,413
judging whether or not that thing
looks like it's really in there.

1946
01:52:09,499 --> 01:52:12,411
We start with a background plate,
obviously, the shot in production,

1947
01:52:12,499 --> 01:52:16,174
and then we take computer- generated
elements and we add them to the shot.

1948
01:52:16,259 --> 01:52:19,888
Michael is the type of guy that wants
to shoot things messy, which l love,

1949
01:52:19,979 --> 01:52:21,128
'cause you shoot the explosions,

1950
01:52:21,219 --> 01:52:23,574
or all the debris or anything,
on set.

1951
01:52:23,659 --> 01:52:25,889
lt makes it harder for us,
but it's real.

1952
01:52:26,419 --> 01:52:29,058
Let's say the bomb goes off
next to the robot.

1953
01:52:29,139 --> 01:52:30,936
We have to model the robot,

1954
01:52:31,019 --> 01:52:34,170
but then we have topull out
that debris out of the plate

1955
01:52:34,259 --> 01:52:35,533
and put him in there behind it,

1956
01:52:35,619 --> 01:52:37,450
'cause he's got to
fit into the background,

1957
01:52:37,539 --> 01:52:40,292
but behind that debris
that might be gone.

1958
01:52:40,419 --> 01:52:42,011
lt's very much a process
for the compositor

1959
01:52:42,099 --> 01:52:44,294
to get in there and make everything
feel real again.

1960
01:52:44,379 --> 01:52:46,051
And that's what those guys do.

1961
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:49,176
They attack the shot and take it
to the point where it's finished.

1962
01:52:49,539 --> 01:52:50,528
Fire!

1963
01:52:52,379 --> 01:52:54,335
We shot a plate of
the real helicopter.

1964
01:52:54,419 --> 01:52:57,809
But in this case it ended up being
easier just to remove that helicopter.

1965
01:52:57,899 --> 01:52:59,651
This is what the background plate was.

1966
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:02,333
We essentially removed
the real helicopter,

1967
01:53:02,419 --> 01:53:04,296
and then replaced
it with our own.

1968
01:53:04,379 --> 01:53:08,258
So here the compositor has
actually added in the helicopter,

1969
01:53:08,339 --> 01:53:10,694
layered the soldiers
back over the top,

1970
01:53:12,179 --> 01:53:13,851
added in some bullet hits

1971
01:53:13,939 --> 01:53:17,932
for when the soldiers actually
fire and hit Blackout,

1972
01:53:18,339 --> 01:53:20,489
and then enhanced muzzle
flashes in some cases

1973
01:53:20,579 --> 01:53:24,413
to try to just bring out
the visual excitement of the scene.

1974
01:53:24,619 --> 01:53:25,847
And then in the background here,

1975
01:53:25,939 --> 01:53:28,578
where we had, you know,
previously a blank tarmac,

1976
01:53:28,659 --> 01:53:31,127
we've added more soldiers
and just more firing

1977
01:53:31,219 --> 01:53:33,016
as a texture of excitement,

1978
01:53:33,099 --> 01:53:37,251
just to make it look like they're hitting
them with everything they've got.

1979
01:53:37,899 --> 01:53:39,093
My God.

1980
01:53:54,259 --> 01:53:57,410
Everyone is just amazed at
what they've done with the robots,

1981
01:53:57,499 --> 01:54:00,571
in terms of just how real it looks,
how complicated it is.

1982
01:54:00,819 --> 01:54:04,653
When you finally achieve a look
where it really looks real,

1983
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:06,855
that's it. That's
the biggest excitement of the day.

1984
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:10,017
There are definitely days when
we go in and we review the shots,

1985
01:54:10,099 --> 01:54:13,808
and one comes up and you just think,
''Whoa! That's incredible.

1986
01:54:13,899 --> 01:54:15,890
''lt looks like a real Transformer.''

1987
01:54:16,179 --> 01:54:19,933
That takes a high degree of artistry
and technical support

1988
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:22,135
to make these things look that way.

1989
01:54:41,535 --> 01:54:45,130
There's this Decepticon called
Skorponok that's tracking them,

1990
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:46,933
and he's tracking them under the sand.

1991
01:54:47,015 --> 01:54:48,767
lt's Jaws,
but it's in the desert.

1992
01:54:48,895 --> 01:54:53,047
And we were actually looking through
one of the books of all the characters,

1993
01:54:53,135 --> 01:54:56,730
and we kind of went through,
''Hey, there's a scorpion in the desert.''

1994
01:54:56,815 --> 01:54:58,168
And Skorponok is perfect, too,

1995
01:54:58,255 --> 01:55:02,533
because he's also sort of different
than the other Decepticons.

1996
01:55:02,615 --> 01:55:04,571
He doesn't particularly turn into
a vehicle, or whatever.

1997
01:55:04,655 --> 01:55:06,805
His form is very much about
the environment.

1998
01:55:06,895 --> 01:55:08,294
The scorpion is great for the desert,

1999
01:55:08,375 --> 01:55:12,493
and it's sort of a good shout out to
the fans of, like, Beast Wars.

2000
01:55:12,575 --> 01:55:14,008
And some of the incarnations
of Transformers

2001
01:55:14,295 --> 01:55:16,855
that are a little bit more animal- based
than vehicle- based.

2002
01:55:19,655 --> 01:55:21,805
ln pre- production,
they built all these animatics

2003
01:55:21,895 --> 01:55:24,693
so they know anything
that has a lot of actiony stuff

2004
01:55:24,775 --> 01:55:26,845
or there's Transformers
coming through,

2005
01:55:26,935 --> 01:55:28,926
or, you know, you're being chased
by one, or whatever it is.

2006
01:55:29,015 --> 01:55:30,130
They have these animatics built,

2007
01:55:30,215 --> 01:55:34,606
the computerised sort of animation of
the scene, before they even shoot it.

2008
01:55:35,175 --> 01:55:39,134
Skorponok was one of the ones that
we, in the department,

2009
01:55:39,215 --> 01:55:43,254
animated completely in 3D, you know,
like, l wanted to have

2010
01:55:43,655 --> 01:55:47,694
the notion of these components from
the Sea Stallion helicopter,

2011
01:55:47,775 --> 01:55:49,572
which is basically
what he is birthed from.

2012
01:55:52,095 --> 01:55:55,644
So he has these kind of Sea Stallion
helicopter components to him

2013
01:55:55,735 --> 01:55:57,009
and the turbines for his hands.

2014
01:55:57,095 --> 01:55:59,655
And l wanted to see how
these things could turn

2015
01:55:59,735 --> 01:56:03,091
and how he could dig in and then shoot
the sand out the exhaust.

2016
01:56:03,175 --> 01:56:05,484
All those things that
we developed in the department,

2017
01:56:05,575 --> 01:56:08,567
'cause we thought it was just
a bitching- looking scorpion.

2018
01:56:19,255 --> 01:56:21,246
lt's more like these, but there was some
that it didn't look...

2019
01:56:21,335 --> 01:56:22,927
They were taller than that.

2020
01:56:23,015 --> 01:56:24,926
These are his target practice?

2021
01:56:26,615 --> 01:56:28,333
Right now we're at
Holloman Air Force Base

2022
01:56:28,415 --> 01:56:29,814
in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

2023
01:56:29,895 --> 01:56:31,487
This is actually
a very active military base

2024
01:56:31,575 --> 01:56:36,046
because they do a lot of support work
for the war effort in lraq right now.

2025
01:56:37,975 --> 01:56:40,011
Since it's a missile range,

2026
01:56:40,095 --> 01:56:43,929
everywhere you go there's a chance
of live ordnance.

2027
01:56:44,015 --> 01:56:47,610
We go to this fence on the scout
and it says, ''Don't walk in,

2028
01:56:47,695 --> 01:56:51,370
''live ordnance could be possible,
unexploded bombs, blah, blah, blah.''

2029
01:56:51,455 --> 01:56:52,490
And l'm like, ''Okay.''

2030
01:56:52,575 --> 01:56:57,126
So we step over the fence,
and it was weird walking.

2031
01:56:57,215 --> 01:57:00,924
And l kept walking, you know,
but looking down...

2032
01:57:01,015 --> 01:57:03,324
So we actually had
a minesweeper clear,

2033
01:57:03,415 --> 01:57:06,407
when we shot there,
for a good five acres.

2034
01:57:06,495 --> 01:57:08,486
You see a little bit of go...

2035
01:57:08,575 --> 01:57:11,806
And then the two mandibles...
Kenny, move over this way.

2036
01:57:12,215 --> 01:57:13,204
Put it where he tells you.

2037
01:57:13,295 --> 01:57:17,652
But the idea that they bust through and
then have the wire pull them away.

2038
01:57:17,735 --> 01:57:18,884
You know?

2039
01:57:18,975 --> 01:57:21,614
Probably, no matter what,
you want them on either side...

2040
01:57:21,695 --> 01:57:23,731
- Yeah.
- Let's...You know, it would be nice,

2041
01:57:23,815 --> 01:57:25,373
whatever he does...
Whatever he does,

2042
01:57:25,455 --> 01:57:27,525
it should be small and build,
like a crescendo.

2043
01:57:31,215 --> 01:57:35,413
We are in Holloman missile range.
Don't pick up anything with a red tip...

2044
01:57:35,495 --> 01:57:37,690
- Yeah.
- ...or that looks like a bomb.

2045
01:57:50,295 --> 01:57:52,525
l'm gonna light this town up, baby.

2046
01:57:52,615 --> 01:57:53,604
Ready!

2047
01:57:56,295 --> 01:57:58,729
ln New Mexico
we all had a really good time.

2048
01:57:58,815 --> 01:58:02,774
We blew up hundreds and hundreds of
pounds of black powder

2049
01:58:02,855 --> 01:58:04,447
and thousands of feet of primer cord.

2050
01:58:06,655 --> 01:58:08,327
See, that is right where
l told you about wetting it down.

2051
01:58:08,415 --> 01:58:10,007
The chunk. You seen the chunks
in there, Michael?

2052
01:58:10,095 --> 01:58:14,452
We had primer cord, which can take down
a tree or destroy a car.

2053
01:58:14,535 --> 01:58:17,003
lt's a little, like,
rope- like explosive.

2054
01:58:17,095 --> 01:58:20,053
l had them lay out
like 200 of these strands

2055
01:58:20,135 --> 01:58:23,093
so that they can fire it on
a millisecond thing where it's like...

2056
01:58:24,255 --> 01:58:26,928
lt makes it look kind of
like a wave coming at you.

2057
01:58:27,015 --> 01:58:31,645
They put the high explosives on,
then they put just carpet on top of it.

2058
01:58:31,975 --> 01:58:34,205
And then they put sand
on top of the carpet.

2059
01:58:34,295 --> 01:58:37,014
And when this was ignited
in a sequential order,

2060
01:58:38,135 --> 01:58:41,286
the carpet just lifted up and
it bounced the sand high enough

2061
01:58:41,375 --> 01:58:44,412
and it gave Michael the exact look
that he wanted.

2062
01:58:44,495 --> 01:58:45,769
Heads up!

2063
01:58:48,055 --> 01:58:49,044
Cut.

2064
01:58:49,575 --> 01:58:51,645
- How was that, Dave?
- Cut! Cut!

2065
01:58:51,735 --> 01:58:53,293
- Huh?
- Good.

2066
01:58:53,375 --> 01:58:56,333
- Were you still on it when it was falling?
- Yes, sir.

2067
01:58:56,615 --> 01:59:00,164
There were a lot of bombs,
a lot of explosions, a lot of strafe hits.

2068
01:59:02,895 --> 01:59:05,489
There were people flying through the air.
We had guys on ratchets.

2069
01:59:05,575 --> 01:59:06,564
Now!

2070
01:59:11,335 --> 01:59:15,567
So what happens in this shot, besides me
squinting like crazy, is Skorponok

2071
01:59:15,775 --> 01:59:17,208
is running through the ground.

2072
01:59:18,575 --> 01:59:21,726
Of course, l'm not the smartest ranger,
so l'm...

2073
01:59:21,815 --> 01:59:24,852
l'm looking around, he's right behind me...

2074
01:59:25,815 --> 01:59:30,764
Right through the chest. And then...
Takes me back and eats me.

2075
01:59:30,855 --> 01:59:33,289
Apparently Decepticons eat children.

2076
01:59:33,375 --> 01:59:34,569
Ta- da.

2077
01:59:35,655 --> 01:59:36,804
That was good.

2078
01:59:36,895 --> 01:59:38,613
The idea is we're trying to time the sand

2079
01:59:38,695 --> 01:59:41,289
so the burst- out happens with Skorponok.

2080
01:59:41,375 --> 01:59:44,731
We're imagining where his entrance point
would be in the sand.

2081
01:59:44,815 --> 01:59:50,572
At some point we might change our actor
into a CG replicate of this guy

2082
01:59:51,255 --> 01:59:54,088
to be able to manipulate him.

2083
01:59:59,815 --> 02:00:01,089
That was cool.

2084
02:00:01,855 --> 02:00:03,129
That was cool.

2085
02:00:07,975 --> 02:00:10,489
All right, let's go to the tail, please.

2086
02:00:10,575 --> 02:00:12,088
And action.

2087
02:00:12,895 --> 02:00:14,408
Go. Follow it.

2088
02:00:15,495 --> 02:00:19,170
Michael wanted a Skorponok's tail
slithering through the sand.

2089
02:00:19,255 --> 02:00:22,088
We just made a whole track right
out of plywood,

2090
02:00:22,175 --> 02:00:23,688
which actually had a groove in it.

2091
02:00:23,775 --> 02:00:25,493
They put a lightweight plastic down

2092
02:00:25,575 --> 02:00:27,770
and then you put a razor blade in front of it

2093
02:00:27,855 --> 02:00:31,165
and as the scorpion is going through it,
it just cuts that path.

2094
02:00:31,255 --> 02:00:32,688
Get anything, anybody?

2095
02:00:32,775 --> 02:00:34,208
You know, some. A little piece.

2096
02:00:34,295 --> 02:00:36,809
All right, guys, l'm gonna show you
an animatic of what we're doing.

2097
02:00:36,895 --> 02:00:38,328
lt's a pretty cool shot.

2098
02:00:38,415 --> 02:00:40,007
lt's a trailer shot we're doing right now.

2099
02:00:40,095 --> 02:00:41,448
Hey, watch this.

2100
02:00:41,535 --> 02:00:43,969
lt's the one where he jumps out.
So l need you to run...

2101
02:00:45,215 --> 02:00:46,887
He's right on you.
You know what l'm saying?

2102
02:00:46,975 --> 02:00:50,126
So you got to have
that on your faces, all right?

2103
02:00:50,215 --> 02:00:51,648
All right.

2104
02:00:51,735 --> 02:00:53,851
Trailer shot, see? Trailer shot.

2105
02:00:54,175 --> 02:00:55,528
Which camera am
l running towards, Mike?

2106
02:00:55,615 --> 02:00:58,687
You're running towards
that umbrella, guys.

2107
02:00:58,775 --> 02:01:00,493
That umbrella's where
we're running, all right?

2108
02:01:00,575 --> 02:01:04,409
The actors, they had to run, and
l'm like, ''Tyrese, don't trip.

2109
02:01:04,495 --> 02:01:07,965
'''Cause that's a real explosive.
lf it goes off, you better run.''

2110
02:01:08,055 --> 02:01:12,890
All right, y'all. This is it,
Jack, the trailer. Full throttle.

2111
02:01:13,735 --> 02:01:16,090
l mean, this is more heroic.

2112
02:01:19,295 --> 02:01:20,569
Action!

2113
02:01:23,495 --> 02:01:25,963
That fear on their face
was them being real.

2114
02:01:26,295 --> 02:01:28,570
What the...is that?

2115
02:01:29,935 --> 02:01:33,814
l said, ''Just remember at one point to
look back and look up.''

2116
02:01:37,815 --> 02:01:41,364
- Were you still screaming?
- Oh, yeah. You better believe it.

2117
02:01:42,695 --> 02:01:43,810
That was great.

2118
02:01:43,895 --> 02:01:45,123
l think l broke my back.

2119
02:01:45,215 --> 02:01:47,524
- Did you get anything?
- That's how we do it, baby.

2120
02:01:55,895 --> 02:01:58,455
ln each of the shots
that we set up

2121
02:01:58,535 --> 02:02:03,211
we have to have a representative
size for Skorponok.

2122
02:02:03,295 --> 02:02:07,493
We want to mark where this is,
where the trench is?

2123
02:02:07,975 --> 02:02:09,408
This is an lLM sphere.

2124
02:02:09,495 --> 02:02:12,009
lt's a lighting reference for
every environment that we're in.

2125
02:02:12,095 --> 02:02:14,370
lt helps the artists back at lLM

2126
02:02:14,455 --> 02:02:18,130
to correctly place all
the reference lights and shadows

2127
02:02:18,215 --> 02:02:21,048
and kind of match everything and
make it look like it sits back in the plate.

2128
02:02:21,135 --> 02:02:24,093
Three, two, one, action!

2129
02:02:24,175 --> 02:02:25,767
You can see in the plate,

2130
02:02:25,855 --> 02:02:28,164
we had really good elements to
start with, in this case.

2131
02:02:28,255 --> 02:02:30,246
And anybody that works in CG knows

2132
02:02:30,335 --> 02:02:32,895
that sand is one of those things
that you just...

2133
02:02:32,975 --> 02:02:34,727
The minute you hear that,
you start to think...

2134
02:02:34,815 --> 02:02:39,172
You know, the particle work that's
involved with sand can really drag out.

2135
02:02:39,255 --> 02:02:43,043
You can see in this plate right here,
as these primer cord elements go off,

2136
02:02:43,135 --> 02:02:45,251
we get this nice plume of sand here.

2137
02:02:45,335 --> 02:02:48,452
And what we've done is taken that
same thing, left it in the plate,

2138
02:02:48,535 --> 02:02:52,972
and added our robot inside there
and sort of buried him in depth.

2139
02:02:53,455 --> 02:02:56,413
And as he comes forward,
we reveal more and more of him.

2140
02:03:01,255 --> 02:03:03,610
Run! Run!

2141
02:03:10,255 --> 02:03:11,688
Oh, what is that?

2142
02:03:12,215 --> 02:03:14,445
You know, it's not a bad job.

2143
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,094
