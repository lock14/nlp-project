Fuck it.
One or two?
I beg your pardon?
One or two?
What am I supposed to say?
-Home win or away win?
Let's say... away win.
-Really?
OK. I'll listen to you.
Let's see if you bring me any luck.
Experience?
-I worked two years at Pita's.
Until the cafe was closed.
-And the owner!!!
Night shifts?
-I can. No problem.
You have a husband,
child... that stuff? -No.
Only fools have children at this
time and day. What's your name?
Esma.
Mom.
Mom.
No, mom!
I'll wet my pants!
That's it. -Stop it.
-I have won.
Sara. Stop it.
Do you hear me?
Stop it!
Go and get ready.
You 'll be late to school.
What's your problem?!
Hit her!
Now!
Enough! Stop it!
What happened?
Stop it!
She hit me first!
-He started it!
Why do you play a men's sport?
You kick me because I am a better
player. -Enough. Come on, a kiss.
What? -Kiss each other.
No way! -He's gay!
-What?!
I want your parents to come
tomorrow! Yours too!
My mom is sick.
-Your father can come then.
Sara does not have a dad.
My dad is a shaheed (martyr).
Your mom can come.
When she feels better.
Come on now. Hurry up.
Go to your classrooms!
I've waited for somebody
just like you
to have you wrapped
around my finger.
I wont't be sorry,
no, not at all
if I make you cry.
-All these years you would give
for just one night
but you can not have me
I'm going to the other one...
Do you have anything... ?
-No really, I don't. -Nothing?
I need 200 EUR for Sara's school
trip. By the end of this week.
We'll get the money somehow.
Make it a bit tighter here.
You know how many of us
will come to the school reunion?
Eleven! Only 11 people out of 41.
Those who were not wasted
left the country. -I won't go.
Yes, you will, I tell you.
-No. I have to work.
You always have an excuse!
You must come! -Be quiet!
You want me to narrow it more?
Or make it loose... Sabina! Hey.
Fine, I'll come.
-You'll lie! -No.
I give you my young pioneer's
word. -Swear on Tito's name.
Come on, turn around.
So, do you want it looser
or tighter? -Make it looser.
You can see the love handles.
Hey!
What do you want?
Come here.
No, you come here.
My dad is a shaheed (martyr) too.
Sometimes I dream
that same voice
I don't see the face, but I
can hear the voice saying
"You have five minutes
to leave the house!"
I try to cram a plastic bag
with my mom's photographs
but they just fell through
and fall to the floor.
I look down and I see my mom
smiling at me. God forbid.
When I sleep,
I dream our house...
the way it used to be.
Beige walls,
hardwood woodwork
doors, windows...
My Ismet made it all himself.
And when I'm awake,
I can't see our house.
I can't remember
Ismet's face...
not even my child's face.
And now, as you speak, Vasvija?
-Come on, cut the crap!
Give us some money
or work if there's any.
Not everybody shares your opinion
about the centre.
Some women have the need
to talk about their feelings.
Being reticent is the worst
thing we can do.
Some of you have never spoken
about what happened to them.
But my experience tells that there
can be no healing without talking.
And... there's no work
at the moment.
There's work for you!
You are taken care of!
It's OK Dzemilla!
Continue!
Esma Halilovic.
-Esma!
It is eighty now.
Less than before.
It's better than nothing.
Can I ask you...
Is there any way for me to
get an advance payment?
Sara is going on a school-trip...
-No, please don't !
I get monthly grants for all of you.
There's no way to pay in advance.
OK. Thank you.
-Esma.
You should come to the Center more
often, not only when money is given.
Why? You have enough
nutcases without me around.
One trout.
A bigger one.
Trout is Sara's favorite.
Yummy!
Something smells nice.
Hi.
-Go wash your hands.
How was school?
-Fine.
What about Geography?
-The teacher didn't call my name.
The teacher wanted us to talk
about book assignments.
He wanted Keno
to answer a lesson.
Keno just kept silent.
Oh... -Yes.
Suddenly, he fell to the floor.
We all stood up.
So, Keno was on the floor,
saliva coming out of his mouth.
The teacher sent Amer to call an
ambulance but Keno just stood up.
You understand?
-No.
He was pretending. -Come on,
eat. It will get cold.
It's good, isn't it?
-It's great.
I don't know if they'll let
Keno go on the school trip.
It has to be paid by
the end of the week.
Keno said that he would go even
if they don't let him go with us.
What's with your nails?
Go cut your nails.
-The meal will get cold...
Now!
I don't know how to cut
the nails on my right hand.
Oh, mom!
It's got cold.
-Eat it!
No. It's cold now.
-I told you to eat!
No, I will not!
You are late!
There is your work wear.
Change your clothes.
If you listen to me,
show your tits.
You'll get more tips.
You see... God gave women their
bodies so they rule the world.
But they don't use it.
Help me.
Jabolka.
Esma? -Esma from Bosnia?
Yes. -It's as bad as being
a Ukrainian!
Thanks.
Go to sleep! Turn the light
off. Do you hear me?
Out of my room! -If only you
were my, I would show you.
You spinster!
That poor woman,
why did God punished her so?
You stupid cow!
Are you OK?
-Yes.
Are you sure?
-I am.
You need a ride?
-No, thank you.
Come on. Get in.
Don't shilly-shally.
How did you bet on Valencia vs. Real?
-One, home win.
You?
-Bloody two.
Only a fool can bet on an
away win with Real.
How many double picks
do you have? -Six.
What about Saran?
-He's got 12.
He'll miss them all again.
Where to? - Grbavica.
-I live at Grbavica too.
We'll drive Cenga home first.
I could have won big time with
Real's away win. -You didn't.
Fuck them all!
Stupid phonies.
We are at Grbavica.
Sorry. I just...
Thank you. Good night.
-See you.
I think I know you from
somewhere. -I don't know.
You are. -We've seen
each other in 'America'.
I know. But that's when
I realized I know you.
Where do you go out?
-I don't go out. Nowhere.
Do you come to identifications?
I used to come.
-That's where I know you from!
Who are you looking for?
I already found... my father.
And you?
I'm looking for my old man too.
You haven't found him yet?
-No.
I was once sure I had found him.
A hundred corpses were excavated.
I saw on one corpse the same watch
as my father used to have.
I looked at his feet and
saw the same black shoes
that he was wearing
when he left the house.
I was sure it was him.
I started crying and talking to him.
Suddenly a woman jumped in
and said: "Father, my father!"
I said: "Hey, how do you know
this is your father?" She said:
"I recognized his watch, the shoes
and the golden tooth."
She opened his mouth
to look at the teeth.
I forgot to do that.
I liked the man as if
he had been my dad.
I even went to his funeral.
Two more mass graves will be
excavated here around Grbavica.
I hope my dad
will be among them.
Why am I bothering you with his?
-You are not bothering me. No.
You want us to cruise
around the city?
I am tired.
I need to go.
Come on, we won't be long.
-Some other time.
I did bore you.
No, really. I'm just tired.
I have to get some sleep.
Good night.
-See you.
Writing poetry is very hard,
not everybody can write.
I will recite a poem grand
because school trip is around.
If your parent is a shaheed, bring
cerfiticate, money you don't need.
If your parent was disabled in war,
a discount is what you should aim for.
We wish our kids to travel safely
and enjoy school-trip greatly!
Tell me a city and a number.
Paris. Seven.
Sara! How is your mom?
Oh, what's wrong with her?
Cancer.
-Cancer?!
Come on, don't cry.
Be brave!
My aunt died of cancer.
I don't give a damn!
Where are my yellow socks?
-In the bathroom.
Get the laundry out of the
washing machine please.
Those who bring certificates
pay just some of the price.
For what?
-For the school trip.
What certificate?
That my dad is shaheed (martyr).
But they still have not find the body.
You can give me a certificate
that he was a soldier.
All right
I will find it!
I have to take it to the school
now.
I have to find it first.
-Well, find it now.
Come on, Sara.
It's not burning!
Esma! -Aunt!
Dear girl. I just come from Mula's
tehvid. You know Jusuf's wife?
Good day. -Hello, dear. -You go.
I'll be with you in a minute.
She's the spitting image
of your late mother.
That's life. Your mom thought you
would be a doctor and get married.
She wanted a grandchild so much.
Maybe it's good she didn't live
to see this one.
Sorry, Esma.
Sorry, I give you hard time.
-It's OK.
Sara goes on a school-trip.
-Really? That's great!
I haven't got my salary yet.
Can you lend me some...
I would pay you back quickly.
-Yes.
You know how small pensions are.
If it weren't for Harun,
who rarely sends some money from
America, I would starve to death.
Before, pensioners
were appreciated!
They even went to
the seaside for free.
I can't remember when
I last saw the sea.
What can you do? That's life.
Here, give it to the girl.
How do I resemble my dad?
What do you mean?
Do I look like him?
No, you look like me.
And what I have from my dad?
-From your dad?
Hair.
Really?
-It's the same color.
Who is that Esma who
started working with us? -Dunno.
But I don't think she'll stay
long. -Why? -She is clumsy.
Why do you ask?
-No particular reason.
What's up, boys? You have
forgotten your war commander?
What's up, Puska?
-Come on. Follow me.
Where is this world
going to, Chenga?
Young hotties fuck their brains
out. I can't satisfy them all.
Well, it's no wonder with your
looks... -Don't fuck me.
How is your mom? -She's fine.
-Don't let me hear that your mom.
lacks something! She has to have
everything she needs.
You still work with
that dickhead? -Yeah.
While we fought against Chetniks,
he sold coffee at 150 DEM a kilo.
You forgot that? -If I remembered
everything, I'd kill myself.
Tell me, is this Pelda stupid?
-A bit. -No, tell me, really.
He is an expert. He knows
the business. -I say that, too.
How come that you two
intellectuals work for an idiot?
Explain it to me, please.
-That's just the way it is.
Cenga, I want to help you
settle down. For your sake.
I want you to earn some money.
Saran won't dare do anything.
When I screwed him in
jail he just kept whistling
and looking at me like this.
I fuck him and he just goes...
The proposal is still
on the table.
I'll give you ten grand
and you'll get the car.
Make it look as if he was killed
by Serbs, Talibans...
I don't give a shit.
I just want him gone.
It's OK, Puska.
-What do you mean? -Let's go!
Think about it!
Fuck it, people loved each
other more during the war.
Stop talking bullshit.
You want me to show you
something?
Are you crazy? -Just pass.
I put this ribbon here.
Do you ever see dead people?
I am not insane! Come on down.
The first kiss, long forgotten
The first party not remembered.
Come on, shut up!
Hug me and hold me tight...
-Don't sing folk songs, please.
The first kiss... -Stop it!
-Let's skip classes today!
You are an eager-beaver?
No, but my mom will
go berserk, if she fins out.
She won't find out.
It passes, everything passes...
-Will you stop singing?
It disappears, everything
disappears. Years go by...
Sabina will be here in an hour.
I don't want her to come.
-Sara!
Sabina is stupid!
-Don't speak like that!
She just wants to get married.
What is wrong with wanting
to get married?
Promise me you will
never get married.
Promise.
-Sara, please.
Promise. -Stop it.
Promise. -Enough!
No more nonsense!
You will abandon me!
Come here.
Come here!
I will never ever
abandon you. Understand?
Sara open the door!
I know you are in there.
You are nerving me.
Open, you stupid girl,
I'm freezing.
Esma, the boss
wants to see you.
You are my lucky girl!
It was an away-win. From now
on you will always buy my bet-tickets.
Mister Saran, can I ask you...
I have... a problem... -Yes?
Can I have my salary earlier?
Some advance maybe?
We'll talk about that tomorrow.
Look!
I can make you the same.
-You will?
I could.
Stand up.
You said 'some other time.
I really feel sorry about Brazilians.
I can not stand
to see them suffer.
I saw a documentary the other day
about a poor Brazilian.
He had been killed and no one
wanted to come to his funeral.
He was left utterly alone.
You're nuts.
What do you do for Saran?
Different things.
You are like his bodyguard?
You know, I studied economics
before the war. -Really? -Yes.
When the war ended I didn't
have the nerve to continue.
I smoke three packs
of cigarettes a day
and I am supposed to listen to
lectures with some kids? No way.
I would be embarrassed.
What would I do if I graduated
anyway? Where would I find a job?
Well, people find jobs.
I don't know.
I'll be here some time.
Then I'll go join my sister
in Austria. Knittelfeld.
She is trying to get me
the papers.
Can you feel it?
The smell.
Just it used to be.
Please, I need to sleep.
Do you hear me?
What's the matter with you?
I work like a dog whole night.
How can you behave like that?
I came home completely exhausted.
At least you didn't have to walk.
Go to your room!
Come on, eat.
When did we get humanitarian
aid? -This is not huma...
Yesterday.
We got it yesterday.
How much sugar?
-256 grams.
Per person?! -Yeah.
It's better than nothing.
And butter? -Well,
butter is short these days.
Don't tell me there
is no butter again.
They will send butter.
It's important. They promised
to give some butter.
Eat. Come on.
Take some bread.
Where are you going? -Out.
-Take care, please.
I'll come tomorrow.
Don't say that. Only God knows
when something will happen.
Stop kissing me! -I won't.
-Find yourself a wife.
Your father had two of you
when he was your age!
Get out! You bloody bastard!
-I love you, mom.
You didn't get laid
for a long time?
OK! Calm down!
Have you got a barbecue?
A what?
-A barbecue!
You need it for some business?
-Fuck business.
It figures! That's it?
-What are you talking about?
Forget nature. Fuck her in
a hotel. -Go fuck yourself!
Puska called me.
-Fuck Puska.
What he says does not
sound crazy to me.
No, because you are crazy,
you fucking idiot.
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?
Where did you get it?
-It's from my late dad.
Chetniks killed him in Zuc.
They slaughtered him.
His friend told me. My dad
did not want to escape
from the trench.
They caught him alive.
How did your dad get killed?
-I don't know.
You have to know that!
You know how to shoot?
I'll teach you.
Are those real bullets?
Of course! You'll see on
the school trip when I shoot!
You'll carry the gun
on the school trip?!
Give it to me!
I won't more!
Give me more!
Maybe somebody
should examine Sara?
What do you mean 'examine'?
-Not exactly 'examine'.
Maybe somebody should talk
to her. -About what?
She didn't act normally
the other night.
She threw my bag through
the window and called me names.
She even tried to hit
me with an ashtray.
She is still a child.
She plays her little games.
Come on, she is not just a child.
She doesn't act normally.
She is a bit touched
in the head.
Maybe she needs some
professional help.
What do you know about children?!
You don't know anything!
Nor will you ever know!
Bosnia is my bloodied soil,
The land of ancestors,
Bosnia is love,
and a flower in my hair...
And the land of my dreams.
What a stupid poem.
Why don't you write
a better one?
Whoever meddles
with Bosnia...
What happened with
you and Sabina?
Nothing.
Why do you ask?
She complained about you.
I didn't do anything to her.
I really didn't.
I didn't want to eat and
she started insulting me.
She said you didn't raise me
properly, she kept yelling at me.
I threw her purse
throw the window.
Sara, you shouldn't
have done that!
And she can do
whatever she wants.
You are grounded
for the next 5 days.
Mom, please don't.
It's Ena's birthday tomorrow.
Don't argue with me.
-Mom, please.
Sara, come on...
-Mom.
Yes?
I am. Hi. I can't now...
Call me later.
Right. Bye.
Who was that?
Sabina.
Listen, I decided that you
should stay alone tonight.
What do you say about that?
-What?
I want to see if you can
take care of yourself.
Alone?
Without Sabina around?
Absolutely alone!
Really?
-Yes.
You don't mind me...
-No.
You are some nice girl.
We used to inhale glue
in our student days.
Students of medicine. Once,
we were standing in front of the
classroom and the professor
appeared from somewhere,
but I did not notice him.
my eyelashes were
closed with glue. The professor.
asked me something and
I was just twinkling like this.
God knows what crossed
his mind at this moment.
I said you're nuts.
What?
You're really nuts.
Hey, let's eat.
-OK.
Mom, have you
found the certificate?
I have to go to the
municipality office to get it
and then stamp it in the court.
You will go on your school trip.
You know what I really
would like? To have my people
and my own company. They would
work for me, I would deal with
interest rates, buy Mercedes C
class with darkened windows,
wide tires. I would have
my own bodyguards.
So you don't get beaten
up again.
I was looking for him today.
With the gun.
When I get hold of him,
I will stick it in his ass.
You have it here?
Yes, why? -Give it to me.
It will stay with me till
you calm down.
Give me the gun! -No!
Give it back! -If you think
that I am your friend you
will leave it here. -Ok,
but take good care of it.
Excuse me, Mr. Saran.
Here is my lucky girl. Come in!
Remember when I asked you,
If I can get some advance payment?
Come in! -It'll be on Tuesday,
I guarantee. -Cut the crap!
How much? -Two hundred.
-Of what? -Euros.
Thank you.
Screw you guys and him too!
Give me the bet-ticket.
Third Tuesday.
Fucking Tuesday.
Give me the bet-ticket.
I'm sorry.
I could have won 300 marks.
You fucking clumsy bitch!
Come on, fuck 300 marks.
Yeah, fuck 300 marks.
So, why didn't you pay
for the bet-ticket?
Hey, let her go!
Hey, stop it!
Let him go!
What's your problem?
Are you crazy!
He'll kill us unless we kill him.
-Why didn't you let me kill him?
Get in the car!
You are all animals!
I told you everything
was going to be OK.
Crypussy!
You look like shit.
Cry more,
you'll piss less.
Your mom is here!
Have you brought it?
-It's all paid for.
With certificate?
-No, I got my salery.
You'll go to the school-trip.
And certificate?
-We don't need it.
Good afternoon.
I'm teacher Muharem.
It's good to see
that you feel better.
Sara told me about...
What can I say? Fight for it.
I know a woman who cured
it with herbal teas.
Where is the certificate?
-What illness?
Where is the certificate?
-You brat!
Mom, give me the certificate!
Give it to me! Mom!
How come that you shaheed's child
still have to pay the school-trip?
She lies, she is not on the list!
You stupid cow, come here!
My father is shaheed!
Cetniks slaughtered him in Zuc.
He did not want to leave
the trench. Memorize this!
Esma. -What?
I am leaving.
I got the papers.
Who will identify your
father if you leave?
He will be alone on
those plastic sheets.
Who will identify the body?
How come you are not at school?
How come you did not
bring the certificate?
Fuck off!
I am the only one
that is not on the list.
Where is the certificate?
Shut up, or I will show you
as never before.
Do you know who my father is?
-How dare you?
You don't know! You don't
even know who fucked you.
Where did he die?
-Sara, give me the gun.
Where did he die?
-Give me the gun.
Tell me, where did he die?
-On the line. -What line?
First. -Where is that line?
-Sara, please!
You don't know! You are
lying to me my whole life!
I want to know the truth!
Tell me the truth!
You want the truth!?!
You want the truth!?!
They raped me!
They raped me in the war-camp!
You were born in that camp!
You are Chetnik's bastard!
Chetnik's bastard!
I am not!
My father is a shaheed!
When flowers are in full bloom
When the whole world is perfumed
The soul cries in desire
We parted a long time ago
These red roses
Are crimsoned with blood
Blood and tears remain
For the killed heart
The sky above us
Is nothing but a shadow of curtain
Seven floors of heaven
tear our chest apart
Spring is in us
When soaked with tears
Even the desert blossoms
And turns to paradise
I wanted to kill her.
I hit as hard as I could
but nothing happened.
My belly grew bigger.
With her inside.
They were coming even then.
Every day.
Two or three of them.
Every day.
In the hospital,
when I gave birth,
I told them not to
bring her to me.
She was crying.
I heard her through the walls.
Next day, milk started
to flow from my breasts.
I said that I would feed
her just once. Just once.
When they brought her to me,
when I held her in my arms,
she was so tiny.
She was so beautiful.
I had forgotten that there was
anything beautiful in this world.
We grew up together,
my city nand I.
The same blue sky
dedicated a verse to us.
Below Trebevic we dreamed
our dreams.
Who will grow
faster, grow prettier.
You were big when I was born.
Smiling from Igman
you sent me sleep.
The boy who grows up fell
in love with you,
and stayed here,
together with his city.
Where ever I go I only
dream of you,
all my roads
are leading back to you,
I longingly wait to see
your lights
Sarajevo my love.
You have your songs,
and I sing them
want to share my dreams
with you.
My joys and your happiness,
Sarajevo my love.
YugoManijak
