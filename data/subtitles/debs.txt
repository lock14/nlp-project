00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>There is a secret test
hidden within the SA T.</i>

3
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,910
<i>This test does not measure
a student's aptitude...</i>

4
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:36,029
<i>...at reading, writing
and arithmetic.</i>

5
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:38,868
<i>It measures
a student's innate ability...</i>

6
00:00:39,068 --> 00:00:42,987
<i>...to lie, cheat, fight and kill.</i>

7
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:49,346
<i>Those who score well are recruited
into a secret paramilitary academy.</i>

8
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:55,985
<i>Some call them seductresses.
Some call them spies.</i>

9
00:00:56,144 --> 00:01:00,703
<i>Fools call them innocent.
They call themselves D.E.B.S.</i>

10
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:36,161
<i>Good morning, D.E.B.S.
Attention, D.E.B.S.!</i>

11
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:41,160
<i>Attention! Emergency alert!
That means report right now!</i>

12
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,279
<i>Right this second!
You have no time to sleep, ladies!</i>

13
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,199
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

14
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,398
<i>-And I mean now, ladies!
-Dominique.</i>

15
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:51,237
<i>The world might be destroyed
while you nap!</i>

16
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,077
Come on.
Phipps is freaking out.

17
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:55,716
<i>-I need you guys up!
-Five minutes.</i>

18
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:00,155
And no boys allowed upstairs.

19
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:01,915
Out.

20
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,474
<i>-What?
-Let's go! I want everybody up!</i>

21
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:08,714
-Janet. Five minutes.
-Have you seen my gun?

22
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:11,513
<i>Move it, move it!
Everybody in the house!</i>

23
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:13,673
What did I do with it?

24
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:16,232
D.E.B.S. Max here.

25
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,351
Amy, it's for you.

26
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:22,830
Hello. No. No! I'm not--

27
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,990
I'm not talking about this anymore.

28
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,830
Get out.

29
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:29,868
And take your clothes with you.
I don't do laundry.

30
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:31,988
<i>Let's go! Let's go, let's go!</i>

31
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:35,227
<i>Move it, move it, move it!
I don't have all day, D.E.B.S.</i>

32
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:38,386
<i>I do not have all day!</i>

33
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:39,666
<i>Ten!</i>

34
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:43,386
<i>-Bobby, seriously, it's not a good time.
-Nine.</i>

35
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,225
<i>-Eight.
-When? When is a good time?</i>

36
00:03:46,385 --> 00:03:48,704
-Stop calling.
-Amy!

37
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,703
<i>-Five. Four. Three.
-I'm coming.</i>

38
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,463
<i>After all we've been through?</i>

39
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,822
<i>-Two, one.
-Goodbye, Bobby.</i>

40
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,341
I broke up with Bobby.

41
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:06,980
-What?
-I broke up with Bobby.

42
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,499
-Oh, my God! Why?
-He was just so boring.

43
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,658
He's an ass.

44
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,018
What?

45
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:17,857
I like him. I think he's sweet.

46
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:21,337
-I'm just not in love.
-What?

47
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:23,656
I said, I want to be in love!

48
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,695
Why are you yelling?

49
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,851
-Hi, Amy.
-Hi.

50
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,650
-Hey, Mr. P.
-Don't call me that.

51
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,489
-Hey, Mr. P.
-What's up, Mr. P?

52
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,609
"Bonjour", Mr. P.

53
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:57,568
Hey, can I get a farmer's daughter
short stack and bacon, well done.

54
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,928
Tofu scramble, peach smoothie,
non-dairy.

55
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:03,207
-Cheeseburger, extra pickles.
-Coffee, black.

56
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:06,726
We have a special guest with us
this morning.

57
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:07,806
-Ms. Petrie.
-Ms. Petrie?

58
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:08,806
-Ms. Petrie.
-Ms. Petrie?

59
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,605
She never comes down here!

60
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:14,885
Ladies.

61
00:05:15,084 --> 00:05:17,923
I just want to say what
a pleasure it is to meet you.

62
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,043
No time for pleasantries.

63
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:23,482
Phipps, a matter of some urgency
has come to my attention.

64
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:25,802
Lucy Diamond is back in the States.

65
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,081
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

66
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm writing my thesis on her.

67
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:33,360
I expect to be kept
in the loop on this one.

68
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,919
Let's show some hustle.

69
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,717
-I can't believe she's back.
-Who's Lucy Diamond?

70
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,117
Lucy Diamond.

71
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:50,356
She's the last surviving member
of the Reynolds crime syndicate.

72
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,876
Her family did battle
with the Schaffers...

73
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:56,155
...in a vicious blood feud
that lasted a decade.

74
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:59,714
After her father's death, she inherited
the keys to his kingdom:

75
00:06:00,154 --> 00:06:03,073
Illegal arms-running,
smuggling, gambling...

76
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,633
...and her specialty, diamond theft.

77
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:10,071
She's protected by a loyal band
of mercenaries, led by this man...

78
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:11,511
...Scud.

79
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:16,230
It is believed Lucy Diamond was
behind the plot to sink Australia in '99.

80
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,789
Three attempts have been made
to apprehend her. All failed.

81
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,988
In 2003 she went underground...

82
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,028
...and has not been seen
or heard from since.

83
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:28,627
-Yikes.
-That's not even the bad part.

84
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,427
What's the bad part?

85
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:32,986
No one has ever fought her...

86
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,825
...and lived to tell about it.

87
00:06:36,305 --> 00:06:42,584
Peach smoothie, farmer's daughter,
tofu scramble and cheeseburger.

88
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,024
Coffee.

89
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,423
So why do you think
she's back in town?

90
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:52,342
Our intel suggests she's in town to
meet this woman. Ninotchka Kaprova.

91
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:55,381
Ex-KGB, now freelance assassin.

92
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,260
They're scheduled to meet tonight,
2000 hours.

93
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,140
Find out what Lucy is up to.
Strictly surveillance.

94
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,539
Do not try to apprehend her
yourselves. Max, you're in charge.

95
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:09,137
Amy, you're second.
And, D.E.B.S., be careful.

96
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,736
What does a reclusive
criminal mastermind want...

97
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,455
...with a Russian trained killer?

98
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:53,447
Your scheduled meet,
2000 hours.

99
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,127
-Where'd you find her?
-Zeda tipped us.

100
00:07:56,326 --> 00:08:00,326
Said she's available. She's in
from Prague. Relocating stateside.

101
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,245
-Assassin?
-Check.

102
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,804
-Where's the meet?
-Les Deux Amours.

103
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,483
Trendy, yet discreet.

104
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:17,242
Cancel it.

105
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:19,841
Why? It's all set up.

106
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:23,200
-I don't do blind dates.
-Well, it's not a blind date...

107
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,520
-...if you know what they look like.
-Tell her I'm not coming.

108
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,559
-Say I came down with something.
-Lucy, it's been two years.

109
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,759
-You have to get out there.
-I am out there.

110
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:34,598
I went out with that drummer,
the girl that talked loud.

111
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:37,278
You didn't go out with her.
We all went out together.

112
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:40,837
Then you lied and said you had food
poisoning, and you went home early.

113
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:45,076
Yeah, well, she talked really loud,
even when you were right next to her.

114
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,434
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to drown yourself...

115
00:08:48,635 --> 00:08:52,354
...in your little schemes to destroy
the world, but you need to get over it.

116
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,274
-You were dumped.
-I was not dumped.

117
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,072
Oh, you were dumped hard.
And that sucks.

118
00:08:57,273 --> 00:08:59,632
You took time off
to go to Antarctica or whatever.

119
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:01,191
Reykjavik. It's in Iceland.

120
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:04,551
But now it's time to get back
in the game, Lucy.

121
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:08,030
You've got a date tonight with
a beautiful Russian assassin...

122
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,310
...and you're gonna show up.

123
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,589
-Lucy.
-Fine.

124
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:16,509
Okay, I'll go. I'll be there.

125
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:19,747
Just promise me you'll be open.

126
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:23,146
-Open to what?
-Open to love.

127
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,578
Hey, look. Look. Check this out.

128
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:03,657
Ms. Petrie is handpicking girls
for the International Bureau.

129
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:05,737
I'm gonna see if
I can get an interview.

130
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:09,096
Think Mr. Phipps would let me
take time off after endgame?

131
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,135
What are you talking about?

132
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:14,814
I don't know. There's this
art school in Barcelona.

133
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,774
Art school?

134
00:10:16,975 --> 00:10:19,574
You're the perfect score.
You could have your choice...

135
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:22,293
...of any assignment you want
after endgame.

136
00:10:23,293 --> 00:10:26,172
-Who's your best friend?
-You are my best friend.

137
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:28,811
What did I say to you
the very first day of academy?

138
00:10:29,012 --> 00:10:31,011
"That's my bunk, bitch."

139
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:34,131
-Okay, after I said that.
-"D.E.B.S. stick together."

140
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,690
Exactly.

141
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,969
We've been through four years
of hell, and now we're top squad.

142
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,489
We're just getting to the good stuff.

143
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,527
So you're not gonna ruin it all
by going to art school.

144
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:51,286
-Am I right?
-Yes. You are always right.

145
00:10:51,606 --> 00:10:55,325
You need to put it here.
Don't be an idiot for once.

146
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:57,165
You need to speak
English or French.

147
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,724
"Fringlish" is not a language.

148
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:05,043
<i>-D.E.B.S. Janet speaking. Over.
-Janet, put her on.</i>

149
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:07,843
-It's Bobby.
-I don't wanna talk to him.

150
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:12,242
<i>-She doesn't want to talk to you. Over.
-Bullshit! I need to talk to her.</i>

151
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:15,201
Copy that.
He really needs to see you.

152
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:18,160
He should not call her.
It is embarrassing.

153
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,040
Bobby, I told you, it's over.

154
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,879
<i>-Over.
-We've gotta talk.</i>

155
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,038
I'm serious. No.

156
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:27,478
Amy, we need to talk.

157
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:29,877
Jesus, Bobby,
what are you doing here?

158
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:33,077
Think you guys are the only ones
onto Diamond? Everyone's here:

159
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:34,877
The feds, the CIA.

160
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:37,596
-Can't believe it.
-This is our stakeout.

161
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:41,395
Always sticking their heads
in our business. It's unbelievable.

162
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:44,194
Could you guys excuse us
for a minute?

163
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:48,033
Why do you have to be
such a jerk about everything?

164
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:51,392
When my girlfriend breaks
up with me for no reason...

165
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,032
-...l'm a little hostile.
-It's not for no reason.

166
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,151
-Then give me one.
-I just want more.

167
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:57,551
-More what?
-I don't know.

168
00:11:57,711 --> 00:12:01,110
-What are they saying?
-I'm not gonna spy on them.

169
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,110
You are a spy, dipshit.

170
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,029
-Is there somebody else?
-No. Nobody.

171
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:08,108
-Because if there's somebody else--
-Look, I just--

172
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:11,188
-Speak.
-I'm not in love with you.

173
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,346
Well.

174
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:21,906
I guess nobody's good enough
for Little Miss Perfect Score.

175
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:24,225
Shut up!

176
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:27,344
Oh, yeah, you'll be back.

177
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:38,301
You can do this.

178
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:40,781
Why is it I can hold the whole world
hostage...

179
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:43,060
...l'm scared of going on
one blind date?

180
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,619
Because love is harder
than crime.

181
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:50,178
Okay, now, knock them dead.

182
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,458
But not really.

183
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:55,178
Sure.

184
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:08,574
-Are you okay?
-Hey, she's arrived.

185
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:13,133
Okay, we've got visual.

186
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,812
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got lost.

187
00:13:20,052 --> 00:13:23,411
It is no problem. I was early.

188
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:25,050
-I have that sweater.
-What?

189
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,450
I have the sweater
she's wearing, but in taupe.

190
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,569
Really? Where did you get it?

191
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:30,890
-Target.
-No way.

192
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:32,489
Silence!

193
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:35,129
I'll have the Cobb.

194
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,768
And some wine.

195
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:39,567
-Do you--? Do you want wine?
-Vodka.

196
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:42,326
Vodka. Please.

197
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:48,365
Lucy Diamond, she's....

198
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,645
-What?
-Real.

199
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:53,604
-I never thought I'd see her in person.
-Yeah.

200
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:56,084
They also have it in teal.

201
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,042
So you're an assassin?

202
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,601
How's that work?

203
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,961
It's mostly freelance.

204
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,479
So you basically, what,
you kill, like, whoever?

205
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,718
Sometimes maim.

206
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:19,158
-Maiming's more.
-What are they saying?

207
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:24,197
They are talking about killing
and how to kill and who to kill.

208
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:27,196
-Oh, God.
-But I do it just to pay bills.

209
00:14:27,836 --> 00:14:30,475
-Really?
-Mostly...

210
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:32,754
...I want to be dancer.

211
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:41,313
-Yeah. Can I have my bracelet back?
-What are you doing?

212
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,512
My dad got that
when he graduated Quantico.

213
00:14:43,713 --> 00:14:49,391
Greatest dance instructor in Russia,
but I can't afford to pay, so he say:

214
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:54,550
"My wife is cheating on me. You kill
her lover, I give you free lessons."

215
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,349
Fine, okay. Oh, my gosh.

216
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:02,308
First man was goat farmer,
so I use goat shears.

217
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:07,667
Second man, he likes chickens, so I
took six chickens and put in thro--

218
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:10,746
-What's wrong?
-Oh, you know, I just--

219
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:13,866
I'm feeling really ill.
It's my stomach. l--

220
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:16,545
-I think I have food poisoning.
-Are you blowing me?

221
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:18,304
-What?
-Off.

222
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:21,863
-Are you blowing me off?
-No, no, no.

223
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:46,498
Let's do this.

224
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:08,772
-Was it something I said?
-No. No. Look, I just--

225
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,852
I just got back into town,
you know? And-- And--

226
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:15,771
-And I just got out of this relationship--
-I'm not asking for relationship!

227
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,610
It's not you. You seem really nice,
you do. It's me.

228
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,649
Baby, I can change.

229
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:30,488
Guys....

230
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:31,927
I'm just not interested.

231
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:39,406
Then only you will die alone.

232
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:35,113
Head Lucy off.
Me and Dom will take the back.

233
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:38,632
Mr. Phipps specifically ordered us
not to engage her.

234
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,472
Janet....

235
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,271
-Who here isn't gonna graduate?
-Me.

236
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,510
-Why?
-I haven't earned my stripes.

237
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,629
Oh, would that be this thing here?

238
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:53,948
And why is that?

239
00:17:54,108 --> 00:17:55,828
You need to give me
a recommendation.

240
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,347
I don't see why you just won't--

241
00:17:58,507 --> 00:17:59,987
Not what I asked.

242
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,546
I need to show courage in the face
of unspeakable danger.

243
00:18:03,706 --> 00:18:05,706
Exactly.

244
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,985
So quit your whining
and follow my orders.

245
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:12,464
Let's go!

246
00:18:15,984 --> 00:18:18,463
Okay. I'll check the parking lot.
You go that way.

247
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,542
-Stay in communication range.
-But Mr.--

248
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,982
You can do this, Janet.

249
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:45,457
Janet, are you there?

250
00:19:02,372 --> 00:19:03,853
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, my God.

251
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,972
-I am so sorry.
-I'm so sorry.

252
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:10,531
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

253
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,849
-You're Lucy Diamond.
-You're a D.E.B.

254
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,729
You have the right to remain silent.

255
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,489
-You're reading me my rights?
-Anything you say can...

256
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:21,888
...and will be used against you.

257
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:31,926
-Okay, here's the thing.
-Yeah?

258
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,925
-I am really not up for dying today.
-Me neither.

259
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:39,964
So I was thinking that....

260
00:19:40,124 --> 00:19:42,524
-Why don't you put your gun down.
-Put yours down.

261
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,442
You're the criminal, and I'm the cop,
so I think I'm more trustworthy.

262
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,962
I was minding my own business
on a blind date...

263
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,521
...when you guys decided
to rain shit all over me.

264
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,280
Wait.

265
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,520
-You were on a blind date?
-Whatever.

266
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,598
-With that Russian girl?
-What?

267
00:20:02,758 --> 00:20:06,318
Nothing. I just--
I didn't know you were a--

268
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:08,397
Why would you know?

269
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:13,396
-That really torpedoes my thesis.
-Your thesis?

270
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:16,715
I'm writing a term paper on you.

271
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,635
-You're kidding me.
-No, it's for Capes and Capers:

272
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:22,154
Gender Reconstruction
and the Criminal Mastermind.

273
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:24,433
-It's a really popular class.
-Oh, come on.

274
00:20:24,633 --> 00:20:27,753
But it's hard because there's
only anecdotal evidence about you.

275
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:32,712
I mean, nobody's actually
ever spoken to you.

276
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,591
Until now.

277
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,590
Right. Until now.

278
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,308
I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

279
00:20:47,468 --> 00:20:50,747
Amy. Bradshaw.
D.E.B.S. Sector 1.

280
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:52,987
Lucy Diamond.

281
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,426
It's really nice to meet you.

282
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:03,105
You're still, you know,
under arrest.

283
00:21:03,864 --> 00:21:05,944
-Am I?
-Amy!

284
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,742
Or you could
just let me go.

285
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,822
-I really couldn't.
-Come on.

286
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:16,142
Haven't you ever done anything
you're not supposed to?

287
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:19,421
-Amy, where are you?
-I'm over here.

288
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,580
Son of a bitch!

289
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,619
Are you okay?
We couldn't reach you.

290
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,418
-I'm fine.
-Well, what happened?

291
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,658
She was here.

292
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,977
-Lucy Diamond was here.
-That's impossible.

293
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,977
If she was here,
you'd be dead right now.

294
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:43,895
You guys....

295
00:21:49,373 --> 00:21:51,613
Sweet Jesus.

296
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:56,332
Do you know what this means?

297
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:02,051
You are the only one ever
to fight Lucy Diamond...

298
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:04,690
...and live to tell about it.

299
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:13,848
What a disaster!

300
00:22:14,008 --> 00:22:16,248
I am so sorry.
Leave it to the D.E.B.S.

301
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:20,246
You're in town a week, and
they're all over you, just grabbing--

302
00:22:21,846 --> 00:22:23,646
What?

303
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,324
-Really, what?
-I met somebody.

304
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:34,204
It was weird,
the thing about the dance...

305
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:36,323
...but I had a feeling
you and Ninotchka--

306
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:39,042
No, no, no. Scud,
Ninotchka was a train wreck.

307
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:41,002
I'm not following you.

308
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:44,361
Okay, first, swear to me you are
not gonna freak out about this.

309
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:46,600
-Freak out about what?
-You know, sometimes--

310
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,840
Oh, my God! Who is it?

311
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,079
Okay, what do you know
about an Amy Bradshaw?

312
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:55,078
Amy Bradshaw. The girl
from the smuggling op.

313
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:58,718
-No.
-No.

314
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:06,036
Oh, my God.

315
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:09,195
Amy Bradshaw?

316
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,995
Blond hair.

317
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:14,194
Plaid skirt.

318
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:17,114
She's a D.E.B.
Okay, not only is she a D.E.B...

319
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:20,073
...she is the D.E.B.
She is the perfect score.

320
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,672
What is that supposed to mean?

321
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,311
Amy Bradshaw is
the only person ever...

322
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:31,190
...to get a perfect score
on the secret test in the SAT.

323
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,430
-Give me the keys.
-Are you listening?

324
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,549
Perfect score means perfect spy.

325
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:38,789
She is their pride and joy,
she is literally their poster child.

326
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:42,188
Well, their poster child doesn't
know it yet, but she's into me.

327
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:43,947
You can't be serious.

328
00:23:44,107 --> 00:23:47,106
Would you say back on the horse?

329
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,705
Where are you going?

330
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,625
Back.

331
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,142
P.S. She's straight!

332
00:24:29,097 --> 00:24:31,016
You stay here.

333
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:34,975
Lucy, I beg of you--

334
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:45,093
All right, D.E.B.S.
Show me what you're made of.

335
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:33,962
-Amy.
-Oh, my God!

336
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:37,161
Jesus!

337
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:38,881
Okay, just hold on.

338
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,519
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

339
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:49,158
Why?

340
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:55,077
Well, I was thinking about what
you said about your paper.

341
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:57,396
My thesis?

342
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,396
I think it's stupid for you
to do outdated research...

343
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:02,795
...when you could come
straight to the source.

344
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:04,515
You?

345
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:07,714
Come out with me.
I'll let you ask me anything.

346
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:11,513
-I can't go out with you.
-Why not?

347
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:14,832
Like, a zillion reasons.

348
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,511
Well, now you have
to come out with me.

349
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,586
Janet, what are you doing here?

350
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:47,345
I don't know who that is,
but he ruined my sweater!

351
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:50,224
-I don't know who you think you are.
-Janet, no!

352
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:58,183
Did you go to Dalton?

353
00:26:58,382 --> 00:26:59,942
Yeah.

354
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:16,577
-Where are you taking us?
-Where do you want to go?

355
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:18,697
Home!

356
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,097
What are you doing?

357
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,730
Come on.

358
00:27:57,289 --> 00:27:59,088
Look, these tunnels
go on for miles...

359
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:02,447
...so you guys could be lost
in there for days, even weeks.

360
00:28:06,126 --> 00:28:07,926
Okay. Suit yourself.

361
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,680
I have to pee.

362
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:34,826
-Want a beer?
-No.

363
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:38,305
Come on.

364
00:29:52,342 --> 00:29:54,061
Sit down.

365
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:11,017
So how long you been a D.E.B.?

366
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:15,057
You're gonna have to talk to me
sooner or later.

367
00:30:15,256 --> 00:30:18,256
I don't know what you expect
to accomplish by bringing me here.

368
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:23,175
Lighten up. I know there are a load of
questions you're just dying to ask me.

369
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:26,334
Come on, tell me about your thesis.

370
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:32,253
-It's stupid.
-Well, try me.

371
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:37,891
I guess my central hypothesis...

372
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:41,450
...is that as a woman operating
in a male-dominated field...

373
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,810
...you felt the need
to overcompensate...

374
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,769
...by being exponentially
more ruthless and diabolical...

375
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,769
...than your established
male counterparts.

376
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:51,088
I am not more ruthless.

377
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:55,927
I think an argument could be made
that you are, i.e. we're here.

378
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,326
That's interesting.

379
00:31:00,646 --> 00:31:02,605
Continue.

380
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:05,965
And I think that these
psychological forces combine...

381
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,364
...to create a kind of emotional void...

382
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:12,284
...in which you're incapable
of loving or being loved.

383
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:14,802
-See, that is so not true.
-What?

384
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:18,602
-I'm open to love. I am!
-I'm sorry. It's just a theory.

385
00:31:18,802 --> 00:31:21,081
Well, what the hell do you know
about it anyway?

386
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,041
Nothing.

387
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,719
I just broke up with my boyfriend,
like, five hours ago.

388
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:35,318
I'm sorry, that sucks.

389
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:37,758
Thanks.

390
00:31:41,597 --> 00:31:43,516
Why did you break up with him?

391
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:46,955
I don't know, it just, it wasn't....

392
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,914
I think love should be irresistible,
like a drug.

393
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:53,954
I think when it happens you should
just not be able to help yourself.

394
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:56,633
I just-- I wanted...

395
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,473
...more.

396
00:32:00,472 --> 00:32:03,351
-Babbling.
-No.

397
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,991
You're not at all.

398
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:07,870
This is so weird. I....

399
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,989
-Why aren't you killing me?
-Not into that.

400
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:14,789
But you killed those agents
in Antarctica.

401
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:17,868
They died of frostbite or something.
I never even met them.

402
00:32:18,068 --> 00:32:20,428
-And those ATF guys in Peru?
-Ebola.

403
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:27,386
You're so not what I expected.

404
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:29,825
Well, I think that's a good thing.

405
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:42,103
-So, what's up with Ninotchka?
-Oh, God, she was such a headcase.

406
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:44,782
-Where do you meet someone like that?
-Jesus Christ!

407
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:57,819
Yes!

408
00:33:01,658 --> 00:33:03,577
Correct me if I'm wrong...

409
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:06,457
...but your friend appears
to be hitting on my friend.

410
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,496
-You're not wrong.
-Yeah, but my friend's not into that.

411
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,694
So Bobby's just, like, all over me,
and I just--

412
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,094
I just feel like he doesn't get me,
you know?

413
00:33:19,254 --> 00:33:21,493
Do you ever feel like
nobody understands you?

414
00:33:21,653 --> 00:33:23,173
Yes, all the time.

415
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,652
I am really glad I met you.

416
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,371
I'm really glad I met you too.

417
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:44,608
I should go.

418
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:46,648
Okay.

419
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,646
Am I gonna see you again?

420
00:33:55,645 --> 00:33:58,165
Do you wanna see me again?

421
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:02,804
I mean, I'm breaking,
like, eight federal statutes...

422
00:34:02,964 --> 00:34:05,843
-...being here with you right now.
-Yes, I know.

423
00:34:07,363 --> 00:34:10,362
I could get kicked out
of the D.E.B.S. for this.

424
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,041
For what?

425
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,879
Oh, my God!
She almost kissed you.

426
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:26,918
You almost let her!

427
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:35,116
You owe me 50 bucks.

428
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:37,195
-Amy.
-Take me home.

429
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:39,795
-It's okay.
-Take me home.

430
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,153
-Amy.
-What?

431
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:53,073
-Well, when can I see you again?
-You can't.

432
00:34:53,472 --> 00:34:56,431
-Come on.
-I'm serious. We cannot do this again.

433
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:58,271
Amy.

434
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:00,550
I have to go.

435
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,750
I'm gonna come find you.

436
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:14,227
-What just happened?
-Nothing happened.

437
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:18,346
She was totally going to kiss you.
You're so into her.

438
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:19,946
I am not!

439
00:35:20,105 --> 00:35:24,825
You violated a prime directive.
Plus, hello, it's a girl.

440
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:27,144
-You're so busted.
-No, I'm not.

441
00:35:27,304 --> 00:35:29,463
You violated the section codes
as much as me.

442
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,423
D.E.B.S. Code Section 1, Article 2:

443
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:34,982
"D.E.B.S. will not consort with a known
enemy, under penalty of treason."

444
00:35:35,143 --> 00:35:36,462
I was not consorting.

445
00:35:36,622 --> 00:35:39,341
-You exchanged e-mails with Scud.
-That's not the same.

446
00:35:39,501 --> 00:35:42,580
You got drunk and nearly got
the chancellor of Bulgaria killed.

447
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,420
-That wasn't my fault.
-Remember how I covered for you?

448
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,499
I never told anybody.
If Max found about that...

449
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:52,618
...you would never ever get
your stripes and never graduate.

450
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:56,857
-I can't believe you.
-Not a word. Nothing happened.

451
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,772
Where have you been?

452
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:20,892
I couldn't sleep, so I took a walk.

453
00:36:21,052 --> 00:36:23,531
I was really upset...

454
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,530
...about Bobby.

455
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:28,810
Yeah, Bobby.

456
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,249
Oh, yeah. I forgot, I'm sorry.

457
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:37,448
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

458
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:39,687
Good.

459
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:43,167
You know, I can't stop thinking
about Lucy Diamond.

460
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:46,365
-You too?
-Yeah, I feel like she's playing...

461
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:50,525
...some type of sick game
of cat and mouse with us.

462
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:52,964
I don't know.

463
00:36:53,164 --> 00:36:55,724
Hey, but you guys
be careful, okay?

464
00:36:57,164 --> 00:36:59,003
Good night.

465
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,239
Yeah. Be careful.

466
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,716
Oh, my God, is it true?
Did you fight Lucy Diamond?

467
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:29,116
I heard you cut off her hand.
Does she have her hand?

468
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:33,235
Yes, she still has both of her hands.
God.

469
00:37:33,435 --> 00:37:35,594
-Everybody's talking about it.
-About what?

470
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:37,874
How you met Lucy
and lived to tell about it.

471
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:40,793
They're calling you a hero,
when, really, you're a slut.

472
00:37:40,953 --> 00:37:43,193
-You shut up.
-A gay slut.

473
00:37:43,353 --> 00:37:46,432
-I'm not gay!
-Ms. Petrie wants to see you.

474
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:48,751
What? Janet!

475
00:38:04,387 --> 00:38:06,548
-What's going on?
-Madam Petrie.

476
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:09,626
-She's coming down.
-Here? Why?

477
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:11,626
She never comes here.

478
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:18,384
-Ms. Petrie, I would just like to say--
-Who are you?

479
00:38:18,984 --> 00:38:21,784
-Max Brewer.
-Max Brewer, my time is precious.

480
00:38:21,943 --> 00:38:26,703
-You're wasting it. Where's the girl?
-Bradshaw comma Amy?

481
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:33,741
You.

482
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,220
Excellent. Well, take one over here.

483
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,778
Right there.

484
00:38:43,939 --> 00:38:45,738
Excellent. Sit.

485
00:38:51,257 --> 00:38:52,976
Chill.

486
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:59,055
First....

487
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:00,415
-Amy.
-Amy.

488
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,934
Let me just say how delighted
I am to meet you.

489
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,334
When I heard that one
of our own girls...

490
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:10,013
...had actually engaged Lucy Diamond
and lived to tell the tale....

491
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:12,332
I mean, Fred, over at
Central Intelligence...

492
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:15,372
...nearly peed his pants,
he was so jealous.

493
00:39:15,532 --> 00:39:19,690
This stunt is really going to
put the academy on the map.

494
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,170
Lisa from Interpol called
to extend her congratulations.

495
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,449
I'll bet.

496
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:27,849
This is just too much fun!

497
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:29,528
Now, Alice--

498
00:39:29,688 --> 00:39:30,767
-Amy.
-Amy.

499
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:34,127
We are going to need a description
of the encounter.

500
00:39:34,327 --> 00:39:36,446
-The encounter?
-Everything that happened...

501
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:39,166
...no matter how small
or seemingly irrelevant.

502
00:39:39,646 --> 00:39:42,006
-Why?
-To develop a profile, of course.

503
00:39:42,165 --> 00:39:45,724
Nobody's ever been this close
to Lucy Diamond before.

504
00:39:45,964 --> 00:39:50,203
You, for all intents and purposes,
are our leading expert.

505
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:53,602
I don't think I'm an expert at all.

506
00:39:54,483 --> 00:39:56,561
You underestimate yourself.

507
00:39:57,841 --> 00:40:01,401
I took the liberty of accessing
your private files.

508
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:04,040
-What?
-"It's a Man's World:

509
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,038
Lucy Diamond and the Psychology
of Cultural Criminality."

510
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:10,998
-Oh, God.
-"Lucy Diamond...

511
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:15,637
...is at once a narcissistic sociopath
and a victimized girl-child...

512
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:18,516
...eternally searching for
the love of her father.

513
00:40:18,676 --> 00:40:22,475
Her crimes could be viewed
as a desperate cry for help.

514
00:40:22,635 --> 00:40:28,154
The more she steals,
the deeper her feeling of emptiness."

515
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,593
-Annie--
-Amy.

516
00:40:34,753 --> 00:40:38,233
I think you identify
with Lucy Diamond.

517
00:40:38,472 --> 00:40:42,231
I think she sees your pathos.

518
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:46,190
You've got some dangerous
union symbiosis going on.

519
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:50,430
What's that movie with Jodie and the
dog falls in the well with the lotion?

520
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:53,269
<i>-Silence of the Lambs.
-You're the lamb, Amy.</i>

521
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:56,588
We can use that to our advantage.

522
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:02,227
I'm putting you in charge
of this investigation.

523
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:04,466
What?

524
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:08,545
You are hereby promoted
to squad captain.

525
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:10,744
No.

526
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:13,104
Is there a problem?

527
00:41:14,984 --> 00:41:17,503
Excuse me, ma'am, but I am
the captain of this squad.

528
00:41:17,703 --> 00:41:19,422
-Miss...?
-Brewer.

529
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:24,302
Brewer. There is a killer on the loose.
There is no time for egos.

530
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:27,981
This is not the Girl Scouts,
this is espionage!

531
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,100
We have a chance
to do something here.

532
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:36,619
You have a chance
to do something.

533
00:41:36,818 --> 00:41:39,098
Don't let us down.

534
00:41:42,057 --> 00:41:43,977
Ready your troops.

535
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:46,616
You head out at 1400.

536
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,495
That's all.

537
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,613
Max!

538
00:42:02,973 --> 00:42:05,772
-Max. Max.
-What?

539
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:09,771
I didn't mean for this to happen,
I swear. I don't even wanna be captain.

540
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:12,930
That's just it.
You don't even want it.

541
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,570
Boys fall at your feet, the school
kisses your ass...

542
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:19,448
...and Mrs. Petrie makes you
squad captain.

543
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:24,088
You'd be just as happy drawing
in your stupid little book.

544
00:42:24,567 --> 00:42:26,807
I don't understand why you have
to take away...

545
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,966
...the only thing I have going for me.

546
00:42:30,166 --> 00:42:32,286
-Oh, Max--
-Just--

547
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,644
Whatever.

548
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:41,084
It's fine.

549
00:42:41,683 --> 00:42:45,163
-Just promise me one thing.
-What?

550
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:48,442
You catch the bitch.

551
00:42:50,122 --> 00:42:55,840
Lucy Diamond's on the move!
Robbery in progress! Code 99!

552
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:15,316
<i>The bank employees
are being held hostage.</i>

553
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:17,795
<i>Lucy and her cohorts
are still inside.</i>

554
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:20,474
<i>Apprehend the suspect,
recover the money.</i>

555
00:43:20,634 --> 00:43:22,474
<i>The bank is coming up
on your left.</i>

556
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:24,794
<i>D.E.B.S., be careful.</i>

557
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:33,631
<i>D.E.B.S. spotted en route.
E TA two minutes.</i>

558
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:35,671
Copy that.

559
00:43:43,149 --> 00:43:45,549
D.E.B.S. en route, two minutes.

560
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:48,348
Do I look okay?

561
00:43:49,108 --> 00:43:51,308
This is retarded.

562
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:04,344
-Bradshaw?
-What?

563
00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:07,184
The plan?

564
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,943
Oh, okay. Formation
Alpha Kappa Gamma.

565
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,662
Let's do this!

566
00:44:52,173 --> 00:44:54,292
What was that?

567
00:44:54,852 --> 00:44:56,732
She's here.

568
00:44:57,052 --> 00:44:59,211
She's watching us.

569
00:44:59,412 --> 00:45:01,411
Jesus.

570
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,250
<i>Come here.</i>

571
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,009
<i>I can't.</i>

572
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,848
<i>-Come here.
-I can't.</i>

573
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,048
What are you doing?

574
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:17,447
Nothing. Let's go.

575
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,203
We'll be right back.

576
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:42,322
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

577
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:45,801
-What?
-It's a trap.

578
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,680
-Whatever.
-Wait!

579
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,319
Why are you giving me
such a hard time?

580
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:54,399
This is great.

581
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,438
If you're gonna do the job,
do the job right.

582
00:45:57,598 --> 00:46:01,597
Creepy shadows, no bad guys,
enclosed space. Trap.

583
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:06,356
-You think I can't handle it?
-No.

584
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,995
I know that you can't handle it.

585
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:11,874
I don't care if you are
the perfect score.

586
00:46:12,034 --> 00:46:13,954
Perfect whore.

587
00:46:14,394 --> 00:46:19,313
You wouldn't know Alpha Gamma
if it was tattooed on your forehead.

588
00:46:19,473 --> 00:46:22,632
-Guys.
-This is stupid. We are going to die.

589
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:25,552
No, it's okay.

590
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:27,911
As your senior officer...

591
00:46:28,191 --> 00:46:32,350
...I order you
to secure the vault, soldier.

592
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,149
-You order me?
-You heard me.

593
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:41,787
Fine.

594
00:46:52,665 --> 00:46:54,185
See, that wasn't so hard.

595
00:46:54,384 --> 00:46:56,624
I think you guys owe me an ap--

596
00:47:02,383 --> 00:47:03,462
Trap.

597
00:47:07,782 --> 00:47:11,301
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to apologize for last night.

598
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:13,660
I was-- I was out of line.

599
00:47:13,821 --> 00:47:16,660
-You have to release them.
-Who?

600
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:20,179
The hostages.
And put back the money.

601
00:47:20,419 --> 00:47:22,938
This thing has gotten
way out of hand.

602
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:26,698
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

603
00:47:30,697 --> 00:47:32,856
Please don't smoke.

604
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:35,015
Please?

605
00:47:38,175 --> 00:47:40,974
Oh, my God,
tell her not to smoke.

606
00:47:41,174 --> 00:47:43,893
There's not enough oxygen.
We're gonna run out of air...

607
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:45,733
...and we're gonna be all faint...

608
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:49,132
...and the air that's gonna be left
is gonna be toxic.

609
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,169
This is bullshit.

610
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:06,568
This cannot get any worse.

611
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:09,727
Trap.

612
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:12,327
Don't you understand?
I can't be here.

613
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,806
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stress you out.

614
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:16,206
I'm not stressed out!

615
00:48:17,446 --> 00:48:19,965
-No. No!
-This is not possible.

616
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:22,245
I'm such a freak.
You must think I'm a freak.

617
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,804
-I don't.
-I'm sorry I wigged out last night.

618
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:26,204
-It's okay.
-It's just...

619
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,203
...I don't want you to get
the wrong idea.

620
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:33,602
-Yeah, okay.
-I mean....

621
00:48:33,762 --> 00:48:36,081
-I mean, I really like you.
-Right.

622
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:41,560
But I don't, like, like you.

623
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,239
Yeah. Yeah, I gathered.

624
00:48:47,398 --> 00:48:50,677
That's why I brought you here,
so we could clear the air between us.

625
00:48:50,838 --> 00:48:53,917
It's really sweet of you
to go to all this trouble...

626
00:48:54,117 --> 00:48:58,556
...the chute and all. But my friends
are gonna wonder where I am.

627
00:48:58,756 --> 00:49:00,676
-No, they're not.
-Why?

628
00:49:00,835 --> 00:49:02,675
No reason.

629
00:49:03,915 --> 00:49:05,555
Lucy!

630
00:49:06,034 --> 00:49:08,913
-Going to be squashed!
-Oh, no! Oh, no!

631
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,713
-Oh, my God. Lucy!
-Come on.

632
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:13,233
It's not like they're gonna die
or anything.

633
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:17,192
No! No! Oh, no!

634
00:49:17,352 --> 00:49:19,192
Let them out. I'm serious.

635
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:23,271
Okay. Jesus. Booby trap
deactivated. Happy?

636
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,189
That wasn't funny.

637
00:49:32,388 --> 00:49:33,908
It was kind of funny.

638
00:49:35,628 --> 00:49:37,387
I can't.

639
00:49:39,307 --> 00:49:42,266
-I gotta go.
-No, no, I'll go.

640
00:49:44,146 --> 00:49:47,225
I understand this whole thing
isn't gonna work out between us...

641
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:51,584
...because, obviously, I misinterpreted
the whole situation. But....

642
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:58,142
I just want you to know that last night
was the most alive I've felt in a while.

643
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:03,021
So I guess I'll see you around.
Same Bat-time or whatever.

644
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:20,817
Come with me.

645
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:24,177
Come on.
What do you have to lose?

646
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,296
Everything.

647
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,009
Oh, my gosh.
Lucy Diamond has Amy.

648
00:50:53,169 --> 00:50:55,769
You guys, she's been kidnapped.

649
00:50:59,168 --> 00:51:00,967
A D.E.B. is down.

650
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:03,887
We will spare no expense.

651
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:06,287
We will leave no rock unturned.

652
00:51:06,486 --> 00:51:11,565
We will not rest until we see
that she comes back safely.

653
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:20,803
No, no!

654
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,679
<i>No way! Are you... ?</i>

655
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,359
<i>I know.</i>

656
00:51:52,596 --> 00:51:54,355
Amy, where are you?

657
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:56,555
I know you're out playing hooky
with Lucy...

658
00:51:56,755 --> 00:52:00,354
...but they have the whole school
looking for you. Bobby, everybody.

659
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:01,754
Call me.

660
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:05,353
You know where she is?
Do you know where she is?

661
00:52:05,513 --> 00:52:07,872
How about this?
Do you wanna answer me?

662
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:18,550
Amy, oh, my God, if you don't
come back, I'm telling.

663
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:22,149
I am telling your mother. I'm calling
her and telling her right now.

664
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:56,461
Seriously, Amy, I'm sorry I left
such a mean message. Just....

665
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,219
Please, come home.

666
00:53:13,697 --> 00:53:16,776
So then this mysterious man
shows up at my high school...

667
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:19,216
...and hands me this letter
which is, like:

668
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:22,815
"Congratulations, you've just been
accepted into Jameson University."

669
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:26,774
And I'm like, "I didn't apply
to Jameson University."

670
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:30,134
The government's
freaky that way.

671
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:31,893
Yeah.

672
00:53:34,172 --> 00:53:38,331
So, what does it measure,
this secret test in the SAT?

673
00:53:38,492 --> 00:53:40,491
I don't know.

674
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:46,450
-You never asked?
-No. It measures spy stuff.

675
00:53:49,569 --> 00:53:51,928
-What?
-It's just weird that you let...

676
00:53:52,088 --> 00:53:56,087
...this test decide what you're gonna
be, and you don't even know what it is.

677
00:53:56,647 --> 00:54:01,126
It doesn't decide what I'm gonna be.
It's an aptitude test.

678
00:54:01,646 --> 00:54:04,965
It measures aptitude, I guess.

679
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:06,845
Okay.

680
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:10,364
-You should do what you're good at.
-No, you should do what you love.

681
00:54:10,524 --> 00:54:12,323
I am doing what I love.

682
00:54:12,484 --> 00:54:15,483
-Why are you psychoanalyzing me?
-I'm not psychoanalyzing you.

683
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:19,082
I mean, just because I'm not
some badass master criminal...

684
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:21,682
...doesn't mean that
what I do is not important.

685
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,040
-I didn't say it wasn't important.
-Do you love a life of crime?

686
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:28,039
-Yeah, I do.
-So you get a kick out of...

687
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,039
...taking money from hard-working,
honest people.

688
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,718
-What is your problem?
-I just--

689
00:54:32,879 --> 00:54:35,798
-I don't think you should judge me.
-I'm not.

690
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:38,797
I'm not the one that got picked
out of a gajillion people...

691
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:42,117
...to be Miss Super-Duper
Crime-Fighting Goody-Two-Shoes.

692
00:54:42,397 --> 00:54:45,155
I've never been perfect at anything.

693
00:54:49,475 --> 00:54:51,114
Look...

694
00:54:51,634 --> 00:54:55,593
...I didn't even wanna be a criminal.
I wanted to be a pirate.

695
00:54:57,673 --> 00:55:00,233
Pirates are criminals.

696
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:03,632
Whoops.

697
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:07,351
I wanted to go to art school.

698
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,710
-Art school?
-In Barcelona.

699
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,710
-You should go, you should do it.
-Maybe.

700
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:17,148
After I make the world safe
from people like you.

701
00:55:21,827 --> 00:55:23,826
I don't know what the test saw in me.

702
00:55:24,027 --> 00:55:28,826
Everybody thinks I am gonna
make this perfect spy but me.

703
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:32,785
I guess I'm proving them
all wrong now.

704
00:55:36,144 --> 00:55:38,543
Is that what you're doing with me?

705
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:40,063
Sabotaging your spy career?

706
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:44,302
I'm here because I feel more
like me when I'm with you...

707
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,781
...than I do when I'm with me.

708
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,901
Look, let's just...

709
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:54,180
...forget we're here, okay?

710
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,059
Let's pretend we're in Barcelona,
you're in art school...

711
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:59,579
...and I'm renting sailboats
to tourists.

712
00:56:00,658 --> 00:56:05,177
And nobody is a superhero,
nobody is a villain, we're just us.

713
00:56:31,371 --> 00:56:33,611
Max here.
This better be really good.

714
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:38,530
<i>-You are the D.E.B.S. ?
-Who is this?</i>

715
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:41,769
I know where your friend is.

716
00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:44,608
We've got a lead on Amy. Let's go.

717
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,326
Oh, no, no, no....

718
00:56:57,365 --> 00:56:59,485
Get your ass over here.

719
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:02,124
We got a lead on Amy.

720
00:57:03,644 --> 00:57:06,723
And no boys upstairs
after curfew.

721
00:57:07,763 --> 00:57:09,762
Out.

722
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:14,121
Pick up, pick up, pick up....

723
00:57:34,676 --> 00:57:37,156
-My God. I'm so sorry.
-Did you just snap my bra?

724
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:38,635
-No.
-Yeah, you did.

725
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:54,232
-That hasn't happened since 6th grade.
-I was trying to be smooth.

726
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:57,871
-What? You did it first.
-You're dead.

727
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:05,669
And bingo!
I am the god of Bingo.

728
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,749
Breach.

729
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:21,346
Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

730
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:23,466
Bingo!

731
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:31,023
Damn it!

732
00:58:31,223 --> 00:58:34,663
-Say mercy. Come on. Say mercy.
-No. No. No.

733
00:58:36,702 --> 00:58:38,342
-Do you give? Do you gi--?
-No.

734
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:46,140
Do you love me?

735
00:58:47,499 --> 00:58:48,779
Yes.

736
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,137
Come on.

737
00:59:01,256 --> 00:59:03,935
What the hell?

738
00:59:04,136 --> 00:59:06,255
I couldn't stop them.

739
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:09,055
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

740
00:59:09,255 --> 00:59:10,414
What?

741
00:59:10,574 --> 00:59:13,054
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

742
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:16,373
Let's go.

743
00:59:16,573 --> 00:59:18,092
Sorry.

744
00:59:51,165 --> 00:59:53,285
Oh, God.

745
00:59:55,364 --> 00:59:57,883
It is not what you think.

746
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:09,640
I hope it was worth it.

747
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:15,239
You really should
check your messages.

748
01:00:23,038 --> 01:00:25,197
Look, it'll be okay.

749
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,556
No, it won't.

750
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,550
This is a nightmare.

751
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:57,590
This is--
This is not happening.

752
01:01:09,826 --> 01:01:11,626
Are you kidding me?

753
01:01:11,826 --> 01:01:14,306
We conduct a nationwide
manhunt for you...

754
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,225
...and you're boning the suspect?

755
01:01:16,665 --> 01:01:19,505
What did you think this was,
a joke?

756
01:01:19,665 --> 01:01:23,624
"Let's divert federal resources
and man-hours...

757
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:26,583
...so I can have my collegiate
lesbian fling in style."

758
01:01:26,743 --> 01:01:29,102
I was doing research.

759
01:01:29,262 --> 01:01:31,262
I'll bet.

760
01:01:32,982 --> 01:01:36,781
Treason. Consorting
with the enemy.

761
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,260
Aiding and abetting.

762
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:43,259
I'm going to be the laughingstock
of the entire intelligence community.

763
01:01:43,418 --> 01:01:47,018
I am going to send you
so far away...

764
01:01:47,218 --> 01:01:50,258
...that luxuries like
toilet paper and Diet Coke...

765
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,016
...will be as a distant dream to you.

766
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:54,936
Ms. Petrie.

767
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:57,855
Is somebody talking to me?

768
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,535
Because that would be extremely
ill-advised right now.

769
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:03,695
Ms. Petrie, this infraction is
a considerable embarrassment...

770
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:07,613
-...to you and the academy, right?
-Have I not been speaking in English?

771
01:02:07,773 --> 01:02:10,813
Well, there is a way that
we can turn it all around.

772
01:02:11,653 --> 01:02:13,332
Explain.

773
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:16,811
Make Amy D.E.B. of the year
next week at endgame.

774
01:02:18,011 --> 01:02:20,210
Nobody knows
what happened tonight but us.

775
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:25,409
What good would it do to send
Amy to Siberia? Nothing.

776
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:30,848
Your pride and joy will be disgraced,
and for what?

777
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:34,127
Exactly.
So here's what we're gonna do.

778
01:02:34,287 --> 01:02:36,206
Tomorrow we're gonna go
to class...

779
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:38,966
...and we're gonna report
that we rescued Amy...

780
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:40,966
...just in the nick of time.

781
01:02:41,126 --> 01:02:44,205
And Amy is gonna act
traumatized but cool.

782
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:47,924
And she will go to endgame
on Saturday with Bobby.

783
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,043
And she'll give a speech
about how she battled Lucy...

784
01:02:51,203 --> 01:02:53,762
...and lived to fight another day.

785
01:02:53,922 --> 01:02:58,841
And you, Ms. Petrie, will get
another feather in your cap.

786
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:02,400
And we don't lose a valued member
of our team.

787
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,440
But she's obviously in love
with our nemesis.

788
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,079
How can I make sure
she won't run off again?

789
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:11,559
Well, let's ask her.

790
01:03:16,517 --> 01:03:18,677
The Amy that I know...

791
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:23,916
...wouldn't sell out her friends
and her country for some supervillain.

792
01:03:24,556 --> 01:03:26,515
The Amy that I know...

793
01:03:26,674 --> 01:03:28,874
...she must have been
brainwashed or something.

794
01:03:29,034 --> 01:03:34,233
Maybe Lucy was doing some type
of experiments with mind control.

795
01:03:34,633 --> 01:03:38,432
Because the Amy that I know
would never...

796
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:41,432
...ever betray us like that.

797
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:46,951
You didn't know
what you were doing, right?

798
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,510
Right.

799
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:50,949
And there's no way
that you're in love with her?

800
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:53,868
No. No way.

801
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,148
Good.

802
01:03:57,308 --> 01:03:59,347
-You'll keep her secret?
-Are you kidding?

803
01:03:59,787 --> 01:04:01,387
No way I'm telling.

804
01:04:04,186 --> 01:04:08,466
Perhaps we can chalk this up
to the indiscretions of youth.

805
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:15,144
I underestimated you, Brewer.
Good work.

806
01:04:15,304 --> 01:04:17,663
I'll remember this
when I review applications...

807
01:04:17,823 --> 01:04:19,383
...for the International Bureau.

808
01:04:19,543 --> 01:04:22,262
Have Miss Bradshaw vetted
for information she may have...

809
01:04:22,422 --> 01:04:23,902
...on Diamond's whereabouts.

810
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:27,621
She is to be placed on
round-the-clock lockdown...

811
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,180
...only out for missions and class.

812
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,899
Be grateful you have friends
who care for you.

813
01:04:36,058 --> 01:04:38,779
Too bad it's more
than they can say for you.

814
01:04:44,057 --> 01:04:45,497
-Max--
-No.

815
01:04:45,696 --> 01:04:47,417
D.E.B.S. stick together.

816
01:04:47,616 --> 01:04:50,455
But do not misunderstand me,
I do not forgive you.

817
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:53,735
-Max.
-And you.

818
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:55,414
I don't even wanna look at you.

819
01:04:55,574 --> 01:04:59,133
You let me go on this whole time
believing that she was in trouble.

820
01:04:59,334 --> 01:05:02,493
You can forget about
that recommendation.

821
01:05:06,132 --> 01:05:09,411
Well, you're not
as boring as I thought...

822
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:13,490
...but you are not as bright either.

823
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:17,529
-Bobby--
-Don't.

824
01:05:19,808 --> 01:05:23,087
Janet, I am so sorry.

825
01:05:23,288 --> 01:05:26,687
All I ever wanted
was to earn my stripes.

826
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:31,326
Because I believe in it, you know?
I believe in what we do.

827
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:34,525
And now....

828
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:48,162
-Where is Lucy now?
-I don't know.

829
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:50,642
Are you gonna see her again?

830
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:38,031
Hey.

831
01:06:38,191 --> 01:06:39,670
Hey.

832
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:45,189
So you and me going
to endgame together?

833
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:47,428
Yeah. I guess.

834
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:52,307
I still love you.

835
01:06:52,507 --> 01:06:54,747
I know you still love me too.

836
01:07:00,426 --> 01:07:02,065
Yeah.

837
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:11,823
My dad got this on a drug bust
in Malaysia.

838
01:07:14,102 --> 01:07:15,382
Listen...

839
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:17,542
...l've been thinking.

840
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:20,421
That whole lezzy thing...

841
01:07:20,581 --> 01:07:23,020
...it's kind of hot.

842
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,340
See you tonight, babe.

843
01:07:36,337 --> 01:07:38,616
You did the right thing.

844
01:07:47,214 --> 01:07:48,734
Hey.

845
01:07:49,934 --> 01:07:51,574
How do you do that?

846
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,973
For a top-secret installation,
your security really is for shit.

847
01:07:55,213 --> 01:07:58,172
-You can't be here.
-Oh, I know.

848
01:07:58,372 --> 01:08:00,811
You say you can't see me,
and then I see you anyway.

849
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:04,211
-It's kind of this little game we play.
-Get out.

850
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,610
Is this about your friends?
Because if it is...

851
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:08,609
...I can just talk to them, you know.

852
01:08:08,809 --> 01:08:10,489
We can work out some sort
of dtente.

853
01:08:10,649 --> 01:08:12,728
-I said, get out. I'm warning you.
-Amy.

854
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:19,007
You have to go now.

855
01:08:21,966 --> 01:08:26,286
It's your stupid friends. Why don't you
just think for yourself for a change.

856
01:08:37,003 --> 01:08:38,563
She's gone.

857
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:41,002
Are you okay?

858
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:47,000
I thought you were different!

859
01:09:01,398 --> 01:09:05,757
She thinks I'm bad news?
Oh, I'll give her bad news.

860
01:09:11,315 --> 01:09:14,354
-What are you doing?
-Australia's toast.

861
01:09:14,514 --> 01:09:17,593
-What's wrong with Australians?
-I don't like their attitude.

862
01:09:17,794 --> 01:09:20,633
Okay. Hey, come on.

863
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:35,950
Scud, I don't know how this
happened to me, but...

864
01:09:37,069 --> 01:09:39,509
...being bad doesn't
feel good anymore.

865
01:09:41,068 --> 01:09:43,068
Do you love her?

866
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:51,386
You're willing to give up all this...

867
01:09:51,586 --> 01:09:55,065
...the life of crime,
the whole nine yards?

868
01:09:56,385 --> 01:09:58,424
Whatever it takes.

869
01:10:01,144 --> 01:10:03,023
All right, then.

870
01:10:03,183 --> 01:10:04,902
We're going in.

871
01:10:05,103 --> 01:10:06,822
What?

872
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:09,741
We gots to get her back.

873
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:27,577
<i>In a remarkable twist,
sums of stolen money...</i>

874
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:29,737
<i>...have been reappearing
in bank accounts.</i>

875
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:33,496
<i>Authorities are trying to determine
the location of these wire transfers...</i>

876
01:10:33,656 --> 01:10:36,016
<i>...however, have been unsuccessful
at this time.</i>

877
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:39,321
<i>The Louvre received a surprise
package this morning...</i>

878
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,720
<i>...a shipment of stolen paintings
estimated to be worth $ 15 million.</i>

879
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,279
<i>Insider sources say that the artwork
was originally taken...</i>

880
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:50,438
<i>...by notorious supervillain
Lucy Diamond.</i>

881
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:25,110
She's out there somewhere.

882
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,629
It's time for plan B.

883
01:12:28,789 --> 01:12:31,829
-There's a plan B?
-Yeah.

884
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:41,347
-Getting ready for tonight?
-Hey, Mr. P.

885
01:12:44,586 --> 01:12:47,585
Tell me, Amy,
how are you getting along?

886
01:12:47,985 --> 01:12:50,105
Okay, I guess.

887
01:12:51,464 --> 01:12:53,623
You know, I've found
that in this business...

888
01:12:53,784 --> 01:12:56,503
...there isn't much room for love.

889
01:12:56,703 --> 01:12:59,862
Love requires trust,
and trust requires honesty.

890
01:13:03,581 --> 01:13:06,541
-Mr. P., can I ask you a question?
-Of course.

891
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,780
I got a perfect score
on the secret test in the SAT.

892
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,939
-Yes, you did.
-But...

893
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:14,659
-...what does that test measure?
-I'm sorry?

894
01:13:14,818 --> 01:13:17,618
I mean, Dominique
is a sex addict.

895
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:21,537
Janet, she has a couple
of shoplifting convictions.

896
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:24,016
Max? Well, she's
borderline psychotic.

897
01:13:24,216 --> 01:13:28,656
But nothing in my past indicated
that I'd be good at being a spy.

898
01:13:29,896 --> 01:13:31,055
So...

899
01:13:31,255 --> 01:13:33,735
...why did I get a perfect score?

900
01:13:36,894 --> 01:13:40,052
The test measures
your ability to lie.

901
01:13:41,332 --> 01:13:43,692
You are a perfect liar.

902
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:48,731
Don't get me wrong.
Perfect liars make perfect spies.

903
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:52,170
The rest we can teach,
but subterfuge...

904
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:54,249
...that comes naturally.

905
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,808
Look, have fun tonight.

906
01:14:00,488 --> 01:14:03,407
Endgame only happens
once a year.

907
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:06,447
Enjoy yourself.

908
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:43,878
-Okay, what's the plan?
-There's security here, here and here.

909
01:14:44,038 --> 01:14:47,277
We'll infiltrate through the rooftop
and take out the guards here.

910
01:14:47,477 --> 01:14:50,077
Through the vents,
rappel down the elevator shaft...

911
01:14:50,237 --> 01:14:52,956
...and then bungee-jump
down to the dance floor.

912
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,156
Okay, check. What next?

913
01:14:59,114 --> 01:15:02,034
"Tell her that you love her."
Scud, that's your plan?

914
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:06,032
-That's not a plan!
-War is easy. Love is hard.

915
01:15:07,312 --> 01:15:08,712
Okay, so how's this?

916
01:15:08,872 --> 01:15:10,752
"My tour of duty
behind enemy lines...

917
01:15:10,912 --> 01:15:13,631
...has taught me to remain
vigilant to my core values:

918
01:15:13,831 --> 01:15:16,991
Bravery, loyalty and justice.

919
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:20,270
And so it is a great honor
for me to accept this award...."

920
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:21,709
Blah, blah, blah.

921
01:15:22,908 --> 01:15:25,308
What if she really loves her?

922
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:28,947
I mean, what if Lucy
makes her happy?

923
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:34,946
If you were really her best friend,
you'd probably let her go.

924
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,185
You can't decide
matters of the heart.

925
01:15:39,705 --> 01:15:41,505
It is madness to try.

926
01:15:43,344 --> 01:15:45,384
It's time.

927
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,260
Okay, so I just wrote down
a couple words...

928
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,499
...explaining our version
of what happened...

929
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:06,779
...and expressing your gratitude
at being honored.

930
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,539
And...

931
01:16:08,858 --> 01:16:11,337
...l'm sorry that we've been fighting.

932
01:16:11,498 --> 01:16:13,657
It's just I really want
what's best for you.

933
01:16:14,217 --> 01:16:15,856
I know.

934
01:16:18,376 --> 01:16:20,535
All right. Your speech.

935
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:39,051
Attention, D.E.B.S.!

936
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:40,851
Dudes!

937
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,689
Once in a blue moon...

938
01:16:47,129 --> 01:16:49,289
...an exceptional young lady
comes along...

939
01:16:49,489 --> 01:16:55,048
...who truly exemplifies
what it means to be a D.E.B.

940
01:16:55,247 --> 01:16:59,127
Discipline. Energy. Beauty.

941
01:17:00,006 --> 01:17:03,165
Lucy Diamond's been spotted
infiltrating the--

942
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,404
Secure every entrance
to this place, every floor.

943
01:17:11,564 --> 01:17:15,123
Nobody gets in or out
without my say-so.

944
01:17:15,323 --> 01:17:17,002
Game over, Diamond.

945
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:20,242
I have spent my life defending
this great country of ours...

946
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:22,961
...and I have learned one thing:

947
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:26,560
That sometimes
it's not on the battlefield...

948
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:28,600
...where true courage is shown.

949
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:43,356
Amy Bradshaw survived
one of the worst tragedies...

950
01:17:43,557 --> 01:17:46,276
...that could happen to a young lady.

951
01:17:46,436 --> 01:17:48,595
Kidnapped...

952
01:17:48,795 --> 01:17:51,554
...held hostage...

953
01:17:51,714 --> 01:17:53,674
...for seven terrible days.

954
01:17:53,874 --> 01:17:56,073
-Matthews here.
-We're not seeing her.

955
01:17:57,033 --> 01:17:58,552
Look again!

956
01:17:58,713 --> 01:18:03,911
What fears she may have known,
none of us can fully appreciate.

957
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:07,791
But she has agreed to tell us
part of what she learned...

958
01:18:07,951 --> 01:18:10,030
...on her journey.

959
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:16,548
It gives me great pleasure tonight
to give our greatest honor...

960
01:18:16,749 --> 01:18:18,908
...the Mary Jane...

961
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:21,948
...to our very own perfect score...

962
01:18:23,147 --> 01:18:24,947
...Amy Bradshaw!

963
01:18:41,462 --> 01:18:43,462
Courage.

964
01:18:43,942 --> 01:18:46,141
"Courage" is a big word.

965
01:18:46,582 --> 01:18:48,582
I did not know what courage
meant to me...

966
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:52,780
...until I endured
seven agonizing days...

967
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,100
...in captivity...

968
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:56,940
Go.

969
01:18:58,459 --> 01:19:02,978
...captured and held hostage
by a madwoman.

970
01:19:03,178 --> 01:19:05,897
<i>-Report.
-We've got nothing here.</i>

971
01:19:17,775 --> 01:19:19,974
It was a routine mission
gone terribly wrong.

972
01:19:27,772 --> 01:19:31,251
I was separated from my squad
and knocked unconscious.

973
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,809
I awoke in the arms of the enemy.

974
01:20:15,161 --> 01:20:18,720
Just the sound of my own desperate
thoughts to keep me company.

975
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,919
If there is corruption in this city,
Lucy Diamond is behind it.

976
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:31,717
If there is indecency to be found,
she is the root.

977
01:20:31,997 --> 01:20:36,237
If there is evil in this world,
its name is Lucy Diamond.

978
01:20:41,715 --> 01:20:43,954
It's not until moments like this...

979
01:20:44,155 --> 01:20:46,754
...when you are forced
to take stock of yourself...

980
01:20:46,953 --> 01:20:50,433
...that you see what you are made of.

981
01:20:51,433 --> 01:20:53,392
It's not until moments like this...

982
01:20:53,552 --> 01:20:56,472
...when you have to remember
what's right and true...

983
01:20:56,672 --> 01:21:00,830
...because it's moments like this
when you discover...

984
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,190
...what it truly means
to be a D.E.B.

985
01:21:14,348 --> 01:21:17,266
Which is why I can't accept
this award from you tonight.

986
01:21:17,467 --> 01:21:19,386
Because the truth is...

987
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:24,745
...the time I spent with Lucy Diamond
were the happiest days of my life.

988
01:21:25,865 --> 01:21:29,624
And the only brave thing
I've done this whole time...

989
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:31,504
...is what I'm doing now.

990
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:36,342
So if you'll excuse me...

991
01:21:37,302 --> 01:21:39,702
...I have a date with the devil.

992
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:47,220
-Oh, my God!
-Was that in the speech?

993
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,699
No, that's not in the speech.

994
01:22:02,136 --> 01:22:04,096
Son of a--

995
01:22:04,456 --> 01:22:08,135
Hostile has escaped and is on the run
heading towards sector 12.

996
01:22:23,771 --> 01:22:25,531
It's Lucy Diamond! She's here!

997
01:22:25,731 --> 01:22:27,770
Everybody, run for your lives!

998
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:39,208
Let's do this.

999
01:22:53,804 --> 01:22:55,524
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1000
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:59,709
-We've gotta stop meeting like this.
-I'm so sorry. I didn't even know what--

1001
01:24:01,988 --> 01:24:03,788
Get a room.

1002
01:24:04,948 --> 01:24:07,867
-You are AWOL, soldier.
-Max, please.

1003
01:24:08,027 --> 01:24:09,067
-Freeze!
-Scud!

1004
01:24:09,227 --> 01:24:10,387
-Yeah?
-Not helping!

1005
01:24:10,586 --> 01:24:12,347
-My bad.
-Can't you see...

1006
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:14,186
...she's breaking up the D.E.B.S.?

1007
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:16,785
What did I tell you
the first time I met you?

1008
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:20,064
High-protein diets were overrated.

1009
01:24:20,224 --> 01:24:22,544
After that.

1010
01:24:23,544 --> 01:24:27,143
-That we'd always be friends.
-I meant it.

1011
01:24:29,262 --> 01:24:31,062
Max!

1012
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:45,539
If you break her heart, I will
hunt you down and kill you.

1013
01:24:48,577 --> 01:24:50,377
Deal.

1014
01:24:56,496 --> 01:24:58,376
I'm counting on you
to keep her honest.

1015
01:24:58,936 --> 01:25:00,495
I will.

1016
01:25:06,054 --> 01:25:08,053
You guys better get going.

1017
01:25:11,293 --> 01:25:13,532
I never really liked you...

1018
01:25:13,732 --> 01:25:16,532
...but I'm sad to see you go.

1019
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:25,209
-So where are you going to?
-I think, Barcelona.

1020
01:25:26,169 --> 01:25:28,009
I'll miss you.

1021
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:31,168
-Can I have your room?
-Sure.

1022
01:25:32,568 --> 01:25:34,047
Okay.

1023
01:25:37,686 --> 01:25:39,606
Rule the school.

1024
01:25:39,766 --> 01:25:41,606
I always do.

1025
01:25:47,884 --> 01:25:50,483
There's a service exit that way.

1026
01:25:50,723 --> 01:25:52,363
Good luck.

1027
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,722
And, Amy...

1028
01:25:56,762 --> 01:25:58,681
...be careful.

1029
01:26:08,799 --> 01:26:11,799
-Which way did they go?
-They went that way.

1030
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:31,674
-Don't say I never gave you nothing.
-My stripes?

1031
01:26:31,833 --> 01:26:34,393
-Really?
-Really.

1032
01:26:35,113 --> 01:26:36,953
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

1033
01:26:37,113 --> 01:26:39,432
Okay, okay. That's enough,
that's enough.

1034
01:26:39,632 --> 01:26:41,192
Okay.

1035
01:26:42,472 --> 01:26:44,311
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted--

1036
01:26:44,471 --> 01:26:46,151
Yes!

1037
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:48,070
I didn't ask you anything yet.

1038
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:50,509
Whatever it is, yes.

1039
01:26:50,749 --> 01:26:52,789
Awesome.

1040
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:59,480
