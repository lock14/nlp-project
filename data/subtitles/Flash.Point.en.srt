1
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,707
Still hiding, Fatso?

2
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:35,564
I'm busting you no matter what.

3
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,399
Have I ever busted the wrong guy?

4
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,208
I'll leave the answer to the judge.

5
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,168
My duty as a cop...

6
00:00:58,106 --> 00:00:59,073
is to catch thieves.

7
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:52,434
Before Hong Kong's Handover
to China in 1997

8
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,163
- Four fives. - Open!

9
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:13,067
- Yeah! Drink! - I gotta win.

10
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:14,798
Let's guess again. One bottle.

11
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,605
Seven sixes? All of a kind again?

12
00:02:17,774 --> 00:02:18,399
You know how to play or not?

13
00:02:18,574 --> 00:02:20,405
Waiter, show her the instruction book.

14
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,199
Let me introduce my brother. Tiger. Sam.

15
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:53,536
- Nice to meet you, Sam!
- Nice to meet you!

16
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,608
You sweat a lot.

17
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,336
That's my real brother, Archer.

18
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:11,670
I got lots of inventory.

19
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,935
I have men everywhere but you want it all.

20
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,302
You're going to Vietnam.

21
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:18,935
The three of us can take care of this.

22
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,333
Who knows better than us?

23
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,040
We're from Vietnam.

24
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:24,037
Your splitting ratio

25
00:03:24,408 --> 00:03:25,602
is fine by me.

26
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:33,869
Lost again.

27
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:36,406
No, No. One more time.

28
00:03:38,308 --> 00:03:39,605
Four aces. One bottle.

29
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,571
Four aces?

30
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,899
- You sure you got them?
- I'm bloody sure I do.

31
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,638
Police inspection. Lights on.

32
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,532
Stand over there!

33
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,567
You! Step forward!

34
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:08,075
I drew the bottle.

35
00:04:10,675 --> 00:04:11,607
So what?

36
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:14,769
Excuse me... I'm sorry...

37
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:41,033
On Jan 2, 1996,

38
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:43,536
you intentionally injured

39
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,836
a suspect in Mongkok,

40
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,972
fracturing his hipbone

41
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:49,167
and 3 ribs.

42
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,401
Do you admit it?

43
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,172
On Feb 17, 1996,

44
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,934
during an anti-Triad operation
on Temple Street,

45
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,806
you injured another suspect intentionally,

46
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:01,103
causing a serious head concussion

47
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,403
and permanent anosmia.

48
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:05,941
Do you admit it?

49
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,838
- In 1996...
- Enough! I admit to it all.

50
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,170
During the first part of this year alone,

51
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,411
you had an average of 14 operations a month

52
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:17,635
and you insured an average of
2.8 people every time.

53
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,711
This year you allready  broke last year,
record in less then 6 months.

54
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,170
What's wrong with cops busting thieves?

55
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:25,400
It's my turn to complain.

56
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,577
Are you guys busting thieves or cops?

57
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:32,804
I know you're an excellent officer,
Inspector Ma.

58
00:05:33,043 --> 00:05:35,034
You also have the highest rate
of solving crime.

59
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:36,735
But your attitude is the problem,

60
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,674
That needs to change.

61
00:05:40,177 --> 00:05:41,144
I don't see any problem with that!

62
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,410
OK, you can go.

63
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:51,307
I've been here

64
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,910
for over an hour.

65
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:55,937
Could have cracked already a case outside.

66
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:56,906
You better evaluate

67
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:58,510
your law enforcement standards.

68
00:05:58,777 --> 00:06:00,369
Don't waste everybody's time.

69
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:11,908
Good!

70
00:06:12,277 --> 00:06:14,711
Give me 50 grand.

71
00:06:14,944 --> 00:06:16,969
Such a high stake! You'll lose.

72
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:22,303
Tiger.

73
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:24,569
That's not the way to play golf.

74
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:26,905
It's not kung fu. Stand firm.

75
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:28,067
I'll teach you, ok?

76
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,776
It's very simple. Grab the club.

77
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:34,503
Keep your feet and shoulders
in a straight line.

78
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:38,271
Keep your eyes on the ball.

79
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:39,569
Follow through with your Swing.

80
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:47,240
That's just for an example.

81
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,669
O.K. Next time! Next time!

82
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:57,212
Something seems wrong, Archer.

83
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:06,878
Don't say anything.

84
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,909
My friends here are clean.

85
00:07:10,278 --> 00:07:11,336
Go now!

86
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:18,170
I asked you to transport some goods to Vietnam.

87
00:07:18,545 --> 00:07:20,410
But it's always either to windy or to rainy.

88
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:24,208
It's been 2 months already!
Planning a trip to the moon?

89
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,403
Are you trying to fuck with me?

90
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,604
No man, but bad weather is quite natural.

91
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:29,867
I didn't even blame you

92
00:07:30,044 --> 00:07:32,410
for the bad luck.

93
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:36,307
I have 80M there.
Get it back and we call it quits.

94
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:40,678
Should've told me earlier.
I'll send it by express for you.

95
00:07:40,845 --> 00:07:42,005
It only takes a couple of days by plane.

96
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:44,510
Why would you use a boat?
It would take weeks.

97
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:45,804
You better wait quietly at home!

98
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:47,707
What did you say?

99
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:54,771
Be cool or I'll knock the hell of you.

100
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,579
Are you threatening me? Who the fuck you think you are?

101
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:00,537
I know you're the boss
but you can't tell me what to do

102
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:03,237
You need your henchman.
Ask Tony to come out.

103
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:06,742
Shit!

104
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,680
That's how we run things here.

105
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,214
Is it really necessary
to do this in public?

106
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,337
Just putting on sun block!

107
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:00,678
You trying to get even or what?

108
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,039
Wait for me first.

109
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:04,079
You always end up arguing.

110
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,135
Later!

111
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,679
Ask him to cut the crap.
He could've busted me.

112
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:11,074
Why does he always have to fight?

113
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:12,472
Even though I know you're good at it.

114
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:15,204
You called me for help

115
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:17,271
and I gave you a hand.

116
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:18,378
Now things got out of hand

117
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:19,774
and you're blaming me.

118
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:21,208
Stop yelling! You jerkoff,

119
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:22,977
lousy piece of meat!

120
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:24,813
And you hurt my wrist so badly.

121
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:26,512
The doctor said
there might be complications.

122
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:29,046
Last time you threw a bottle of wine at me.

123
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:29,872
I would've blown your cover

124
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:31,343
if I hadn't reacted.

125
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:32,809
And you fought back. Remember?

126
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,308
I would've lost face

127
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,446
if I hadn't fought back.

128
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,409
Lost face? You're a fucking cop! Lost face?

129
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,376
You want a loudspeaker, you dumbo?

130
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,447
You're partners.
You shouldn't have hit him so hard.

131
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,971
Knowing his temper,
you shouldn't have provoked him.

132
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:46,135
Why make such a mess?

133
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:48,474
When I'm duped, you said we're partners.

134
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,237
But he can play the model every day.

135
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:52,741
You two want me to be a snitch till when?

136
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,510
Let Bygones be bygones.

137
00:09:56,313 --> 00:09:57,678
Who's leading whom anyway?

138
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,211
- Not this again! - Not what?

139
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:01,773
Cops have regulations.

140
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:04,676
Stop arguing.
You might not be partners anymore.

141
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,443
Really?

142
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:08,577
The verdict is out.

143
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,576
You still lead.

144
00:10:09,747 --> 00:10:10,873
Report to the Police Band next week.

145
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:13,372
No way! They've gone too far!

146
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,538
As you just said, cops have regulations.

147
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,878
I'm appealing!

148
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:30,780
Keep it up!

149
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,278
Ditto!

150
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:36,507
We can't think too much. Just go ahead!

151
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,108
If we're destined to die, so be it!

152
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,573
What's wrong with you?
You got it wrong 4 times!

153
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,107
How so?

154
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:25,971
The E-flat

155
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:27,774
after the sextuplet on the 12th bar.

156
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:29,005
We heard nothing.

157
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:30,373
Just you yelling.

158
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:33,343
Be serious! We are cops.

159
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:35,946
If you wanna play, form your own band.

160
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:38,245
You can't expect everyone to be like you.

161
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:40,109
- You dare to talk back...
- You are definitely wrong!

162
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:44,179
When a cop errs, he either hurts others

163
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:48,680
or he hurts himself. Do yourjob well.

164
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:50,103
Mom, I'm busy.

165
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:51,776
I won't bother you.

166
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,882
I'm going back to my hometown.

167
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:57,909
I'll go with you when I have time.

168
00:11:58,082 --> 00:11:59,447
I did wait.

169
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,713
I waited till my friend there died.

170
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:07,118
If I'm happy there,

171
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:08,577
I probably won't come back.

172
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:10,241
Mom, don't!

173
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:12,875
I'll be bored here all by myself.

174
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:16,815
You worry about me,
yet you have no time for me.

175
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:19,613
Be careful.

176
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:22,148
Don't risk your life catching thieves.

177
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:24,171
What's most important to a man?

178
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:29,011
Preserving life. Without life,
how can you be a man?

179
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:33,315
Be careful. I gotta go.

180
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,911
We're all trying to make a living here.

181
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:07,079
You swiped Sam's goods.

182
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,179
He came here to talk
but you wanted him dead.

183
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:13,207
Now you ask us to stay out of the way?

184
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:15,877
Sam has to go.

185
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,948
You don't wanna get hurt by accident,
do you?

186
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,210
If you back off, nothing will happen.

187
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,242
Without you three, nothing will happen.

188
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,514
You better not mess up my place.

189
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:31,213
We took you in when you were refugees.

190
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,850
We were stuck in the refugee camp

191
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,214
like prisoners.

192
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,177
Why did we riot?

193
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:45,113
Because we wanted our own home.

194
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:49,207
If anyone wants us to leave today,

195
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:51,613
they have to fight us.

196
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,750
- Brother! - How's the talk?

197
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,178
Didn't work?

198
00:14:06,683 --> 00:14:10,414
No, we're still talking.

199
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:14,113
Don't move yet,
or there's no point talking anymore.

200
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:17,449
Don't play games, you three.

201
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,581
- Forget it. Let's move. - Wait.

202
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,578
I'll let you talk to him.

203
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,045
Your wife took your son

204
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,308
to school so early.

205
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,814
It would be a pity if he's dead.

206
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,147
You're buffing me.

207
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:35,180
Of course. Thought I'd buy you breakfast?

208
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:39,578
I don't wanna hurt
each other's feelings either.

209
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,213
If you can talk,
we can cooperate in the future.

210
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,512
The woman in red with the child,

211
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:51,843
both wearing glasses.

212
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,848
He looks kind of dumb.

213
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:55,750
When I ask you to dash toward them,

214
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:57,817
you go ahead.

215
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,073
OK!

216
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,640
Hurry up. Made up your mind yet?

217
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:06,017
Your son is almost near the door.

218
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:12,251
I didn't hear an answer.

219
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,551
I'll stay out of Sam's business.

220
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,718
Louder, or he can't hear.

221
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:27,973
I'll stay out of Sam's business.

222
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:31,778
You stand down, I stand down.

223
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,212
Archer... Hero.

224
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,415
Let's get together and have fun some time.
We're buddies.

225
00:15:40,718 --> 00:15:42,345
Glad that you said that.

226
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,349
Let's have breakfast. Don't waste it.

227
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:02,086
- Dash forward. - OK.

228
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:08,514
Take a turn.

229
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:16,142
Are you a dog? So obedient.

230
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,843
He asked you to dash and you did.
It's dangerous.

231
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:20,450
So cruel.

232
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,183
I rented a place tonight
to celebrate your birthday.

233
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:29,248
I'm meeting a friend.

234
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:33,419
- What? You have friends? - Sure!

235
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:40,186
- Have fun! - Thanks, Archer.

236
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:04,047
Lynn.

237
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:08,519
Of course it's me. You free? Come over.

238
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:13,851
Why are you cursing me?

239
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:17,050
Auntie May, can I talk to your daughter?

240
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:18,948
What?

241
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:19,980
She's dead?

242
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:22,817
I'm so sorry!

243
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,352
Vivien, it's Wilson.

244
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:27,114
What?

245
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:28,912
Nothing, it's my birthday today.

246
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,913
Don't say it's none of your business.

247
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,477
Actually I won

248
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:36,449
the lottery today...

249
00:17:41,785 --> 00:17:43,912
- Judy, please. - Happy Birthday!

250
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:49,283
Thank you...

251
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:52,447
Are you off work already?

252
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,682
Not yet. I'll drop by your place later.

253
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:57,117
OK, bye!

254
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:58,344
Bye.

255
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:32,416
Long time no see.

256
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:37,051
Not that long. Only half a year!

257
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,944
Been to Vietnam lately?

258
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,484
Be careful if you're going there.

259
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:44,384
Don't be caught by the cops.

260
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,414
They put people away for eating Pho?

261
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,353
You said you wouldn't sell liquor
but you are now.

262
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,178
You think I like selling liquor?

263
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:57,347
What else can I do?

264
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:00,853
A whore?

265
00:19:03,886 --> 00:19:07,287
Don't say that. There're many ways to fame.

266
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,017
You know this Blue Girl.

267
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:14,186
She also sold liquor.
Now she has her own brand.

268
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:15,784
How about Carlsberg?

269
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:19,079
Carl used to sell burgers

270
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,613
before he sold beer.

271
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,911
That's why his brand is called Carlsberg.

272
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,084
How about mine?

273
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,884
So don't say we have no future.

274
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,052
Johnny Walker used to walk here,

275
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,212
there, everywhere.

276
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:42,153
I'll take a shower.
I'll leave on my own later.

277
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:28,055
- Something's up, Tiger? - You bet!

278
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:47,285
Where we going later?

279
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:49,519
- Picnic in the suburbs! - OK!

280
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:54,713
Take my daughter first!

281
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:36,248
- Cops! Get into the car! - Shit!

282
00:21:58,621 --> 00:21:59,815
You can be discharged any time.

283
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:02,222
If you wanna fight, I won't cut you slack.

284
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,346
If you wanna die, don't get me involved.

285
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:06,719
I wanna testify.

286
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:21,284
Come in!

287
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:24,415
Inspector Wong, we brought a perp in.

288
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,783
It hurts, Inspector Wong.

289
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:39,880
Get me something to drink. It's so hot.

290
00:22:40,723 --> 00:22:41,917
Sam has squealed on Tony.

291
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:45,819
That's great. Take him in!

292
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,350
We need to plan our deployment.

293
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:49,012
Those guys are fierce.

294
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,623
You'll die if they find out.

295
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:52,780
I know that. I'm more scared than you.

296
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,820
Don't tell me you're leading the operation!

297
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,820
Relax.

298
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,150
Those Viets are not my turf.

299
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:01,450
Call back the most ferocious officer.

300
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:03,054
The Force needs him urgently.

301
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,482
It's you who need him the most.

302
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:11,517
Inspector Wong!

303
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:13,550
Shut the door!

304
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:14,747
What's with you?

305
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:16,986
Why you kept the door open for so long?

306
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:18,715
It's OK.

307
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:20,988
Let me know if anything goes wrong.

308
00:23:21,457 --> 00:23:23,584
It's fine,
or I wouldn't have called you back.

309
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:24,586
Get this over with quickly

310
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:25,780
and we'll go for a dip. All right?

311
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,184
- Sure. - Yes, officer.

312
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,185
Put on your helmet.

313
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:33,257
- Let me finish my cig first.
- Drop your cig...

314
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,484
or you won't find a gal.

315
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,518
Put on your helmet first!

316
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:38,823
Bastard!

317
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:41,825
Inspector Wong, look at him!

318
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,184
Beat him up!

319
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:44,820
It's almost 1997.

320
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,924
Stop horsing around.

321
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:49,581
It's their mom's birthday tonight.

322
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:51,522
They'll show up.

323
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,484
Help me clear the scene first.

324
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,382
We need you to assist

325
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:02,024
in the Viets' case.

326
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:06,180
OK!

327
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:07,617
Wilson!

328
00:24:08,957 --> 00:24:10,948
Wilson...

329
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,425
Have a bite. It's very yummy.

330
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,023
- Try it! - Auntie.

331
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,723
Many happy returns!

332
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:23,049
May you be younger and prettier!

333
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:24,713
Thank you!

334
00:24:24,957 --> 00:24:26,083
No appetite?

335
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:29,622
Don't talk to her. She won't eat.

336
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,916
- Gotta go! - OK.

337
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:32,422
Enjoy your meal, Auntie.

338
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:35,789
Call again if you don't get a reply.

339
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,885
What time is it? Still not a soul.

340
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:40,858
- Have a bite! - Shit! Let's go!

341
00:24:45,057 --> 00:24:45,955
Have a bite!

342
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:48,951
Tiger!

343
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,552
Come over!

344
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,187
You're too loud! You scared Mom.

345
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,386
Kneel down!

346
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,186
Say sorry to Mom.

347
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,558
Mom! Please eat something.

348
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:12,386
Everybody is here.

349
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:14,755
So nobody's

350
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,020
going to Archer's Mom's birthday?

351
00:25:18,925 --> 00:25:20,893
Have a bite.

352
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:21,981
Come on.

353
00:25:22,157 --> 00:25:23,124
Have a bite.

354
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,691
It's very yummy.

355
00:25:36,725 --> 00:25:37,623
I'll order

356
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:39,218
something else for you.

357
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:40,422
Sea cucumber?

358
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,257
Abalone?

359
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:46,293
You don't like this? How about bird's nest?

360
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:48,348
Shark fin!

361
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,358
Brother, we have a situation!

362
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,857
What situation can be worse
than Mom not eating?

363
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,250
Please eat.

364
00:25:58,425 --> 00:25:59,858
Tiger, feed Mom.

365
00:26:01,725 --> 00:26:03,056
Let's start working!

366
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,253
Stay here tonight.
Someone will take care of you.

367
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,758
Good luck with the bust, Inspector Ma.

368
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:17,391
Come on.

369
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:22,122
Please eat.

370
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,754
You don't like the food in this restaurant.

371
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:28,220
I can take you to another one. OK?

372
00:26:28,392 --> 00:26:29,154
Tiger!

373
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,255
- Wilson! Come here. - Coming.

374
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,251
- Hurry up! - OK!

375
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:38,117
Captain!

376
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:48,962
You have a car? What make?
Where's it parked?

377
00:26:59,026 --> 00:26:59,754
So?

378
00:27:00,126 --> 00:27:01,491
Take the cash.

379
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,620
I drive Mom first. See you at the pier.

380
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:04,889
Got it!

381
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,321
Where we going?

382
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:09,790
To the warehouse.

383
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:12,293
What's wrong?

384
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:20,820
I saw nobody.

385
00:27:20,993 --> 00:27:21,925
How do I know when he left?

386
00:27:22,093 --> 00:27:23,492
Saw anyone suspicious?

387
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:24,784
- Inspector Ma!
- How's his situation?

388
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:25,948
Still breathing.
The ambulance is on its way.

389
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:31,658
- Cindy... - Yes!

390
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:32,888
Check his license plate number.

391
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,083
Yang, you stay behind and wrap things up.

392
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:35,021
Yes, sir.

393
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:39,187
Hello.

394
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:42,051
Where are you? I'm at your door.

395
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:44,325
I'm busy. I'll call you back.

396
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:49,191
Should I wait for you
at your place tonight?

397
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:50,856
Not tonight.

398
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,191
I'll cut you a key... next time. Bye.

399
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,719
- Stop talking on the phone! - Sorry.

400
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:14,459
The target is

401
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,059
a dark green Mazda MPV.

402
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,627
License plate JL2933.

403
00:28:18,793 --> 00:28:20,124
The other is a crimson Acura.

404
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:22,194
DE3654.

405
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,593
Give me a hand.

406
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:36,519
Did you lock the door, Tiger?

407
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:38,156
You're right!

408
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:40,255
I'll go lock it. You get in first.

409
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,796
They are packing to flee. Talk later.

410
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:15,792
Let's go, Tony

411
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:17,559
- Is it locked? - Yes!

412
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:29,662
Sit at the back!

413
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:31,956
OK!

414
00:30:49,729 --> 00:30:50,593
That one looks like it.

415
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:02,661
Wilson, hand me your phone.

416
00:31:11,462 --> 00:31:12,451
Tony!

417
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:32,957
Sit tight, Mom

418
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:36,653
Slow down!

419
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:07,698
Pull over! I say pull over!

420
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,427
Mom, sit tight!

421
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:20,394
It's headed towards Chai Wan.

422
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:23,597
- Hang in there. - I wanna puke.

423
00:32:23,763 --> 00:32:26,926
Puke there.

424
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:29,755
It's OK. Just puke.

425
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,630
It's made a turn towards
an industrial building.

426
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:16,494
Get off!

427
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:51,631
We're headed toward the pier.

428
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:43,422
Go see what happened.

429
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:52,862
Are you all right, buddy?

430
00:34:57,698 --> 00:34:58,926
- How's Wilson? - Inspector Wong!

431
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:00,462
Dunno yet. Doctors are operating on him.

432
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:02,989
That means he will be OK. Stay calm.

433
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:07,830
What's with you? Are you crazy?

434
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:08,693
If anything happens to Wilson,

435
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:09,729
you have to pay.

436
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:11,525
- What's with you?
- None of your business.

437
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:13,329
You must be Judy.

438
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:14,926
I can arrest you for hitting a cop.

439
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:17,391
- So what if you're a cop?
- Wilson is my partner.

440
00:35:23,032 --> 00:35:23,828
He's also a cop.

441
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,089
What you in for? Triad?

442
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:07,228
No, I'm no Triad.

443
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,093
Then follow me...

444
00:36:11,933 --> 00:36:15,266
Call me Archer.

445
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:16,563
Archer.

446
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,859
Did you see your three sons beat people up?

447
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:23,931
I have three sons?

448
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,490
He has disappeared.

449
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:34,901
Sir, can you call the police for me?

450
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,133
I need to call the police.

451
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,131
My son has disappeared.

452
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,228
No one will take care of her,

453
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:54,664
now or ever.

454
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,096
Watch over her. She might go astray.

455
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:11,162
It's my birthday.
I'm 80 today. Come earlier.

456
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,765
I'm 80. I'm 80.

457
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:21,067
Archer Sin, there's enough evidence that

458
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,929
from 1992 to Feb 1997,
you've been involved in

459
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,564
smuggling, infliction of injury

460
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:28,099
and Triad activities.

461
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,761
You're hereby thus charged. Do you confess?

462
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:32,827
No, sir.

463
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,258
The court is

464
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,659
adjourned till May.

465
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:42,537
Meanwhile, turn over your travel documents.

466
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,701
No travel outside Hong Kong. No bail.

467
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,160
All your assets will be frozen

468
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:49,198
till the case is closed.

469
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:53,402
You're blaming all this on me.
Sure you can do it?

470
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,194
Go!

471
00:37:55,401 --> 00:37:57,392
Hands off!

472
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:00,262
- Or I'll sue you for sexual harassment.
- Go!

473
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,228
Three Months Later

474
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,660
I almost can't catch up with you!

475
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:17,361
I'll slow down a bit for you, ok?

476
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:20,465
Slowly. You'll get used to it slowly.

477
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:26,035
Of course slowly.
One of my feet is crippled.

478
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,898
Everything has been well arranged.

479
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:32,169
You're transferred to Admin.
Effective next week.

480
00:38:33,634 --> 00:38:34,498
Admin?

481
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:37,125
The government should compensate me.

482
00:38:37,668 --> 00:38:38,657
But they won't.

483
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:40,763
I even need to pay for court fees.

484
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:43,161
Isn't it ridiculous?

485
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:45,094
You call this well arranged?

486
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,135
I've done so much for the Force
and for the citizens.

487
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:49,366
What do I get in return?

488
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:51,435
If I go out now...

489
00:38:52,035 --> 00:38:52,558
I dunno which roads

490
00:38:52,735 --> 00:38:54,168
are good for the crippled.

491
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,026
All your buddies are waiting for you.

492
00:38:58,234 --> 00:38:59,064
Hang tough.

493
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,829
I'm hanging tough.

494
00:39:02,301 --> 00:39:03,700
If they're waiting for me,
they'll pick me up here.

495
00:39:04,168 --> 00:39:04,930
But you're the only one.

496
00:39:07,002 --> 00:39:08,993
I've left something. Don't wait for me.

497
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:15,698
How are you?

498
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:37,131
Tiger and I will be back before your trial.

499
00:39:38,701 --> 00:39:42,068
I won't let Wilson and Sam testify.

500
00:39:58,369 --> 00:39:59,199
Tiger.

501
00:40:13,302 --> 00:40:14,064
Mom.

502
00:40:18,202 --> 00:40:21,660
Three sons...

503
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:23,925
I'll take you home.

504
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,860
Mom, you remember here?

505
00:40:30,435 --> 00:40:31,902
We used to live here.

506
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:36,063
After I pick up Archer,
we'll leave Hong Kong.

507
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,529
Give it to me.

508
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:28,100
- What so funny? - Nothing.

509
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:30,400
I rather like your foot injury.

510
00:41:30,703 --> 00:41:32,295
You won't be horsing around all day.

511
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,732
You can stay with me at home from now on.

512
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:36,194
You took great care of me.

513
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:37,792
You must love me deeply.

514
00:41:39,037 --> 00:41:40,470
Don't you know that inside a woman's DNA,

515
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:42,263
there's a gene for taking care of others?

516
00:41:44,436 --> 00:41:47,064
For this gene,

517
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,798
I'd rather stay like that forever.

518
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:51,534
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

519
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,495
They're here.

520
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:11,067
Let me change my pants first.
Be right there. - Be careful.

521
00:42:13,703 --> 00:42:16,866
Hello! Delivery!

522
00:42:17,604 --> 00:42:19,538
Hurry up!

523
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,328
Hurry up! Come have a look. Great stuff!

524
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:30,398
- What a heavy gift!
- Definitely heavier than Inspector Wong.

525
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:33,135
Why you live on the top floor?
It's so heavy.

526
00:42:33,304 --> 00:42:34,362
We're only giving a hand.

527
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:36,402
Ma is the greatest.
He bought it and delivered it.

528
00:42:37,204 --> 00:42:37,966
Where should we put it?

529
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:40,966
Put it here.

530
00:42:41,437 --> 00:42:43,132
Give me a hand!

531
00:42:43,304 --> 00:42:45,272
- Stay out of the way!
- Stay out of the way!

532
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,631
Hurry up!

533
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:51,137
Slowly. Don't scratch it.

534
00:42:51,304 --> 00:42:53,363
This chair costs 30 grand.
Paid by one person only.

535
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,630
Sincere enough? That goes without saying.

536
00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:57,095
- Got an extension socket? - Yes.

537
00:42:58,237 --> 00:43:01,104
Let me do it. You guys are so clumsy.

538
00:43:01,738 --> 00:43:03,171
Hurry up. Where's the extension socket?

539
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:10,332
I know you're poor in English.
It's also in Chinese.

540
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:13,036
Automatic. Just like driving a car.

541
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:14,503
Press this button.

542
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:18,396
You say your foot hurts all the time.

543
00:43:18,571 --> 00:43:19,094
This machine

544
00:43:19,271 --> 00:43:21,034
circulates the blood in your foot.

545
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:24,630
My blood is fine.
I just can't walk with this foot.

546
00:43:27,904 --> 00:43:29,895
Walking shouldn't be that difficult.
Given your intelligence and wisdom.

547
00:43:30,071 --> 00:43:32,232
Train your left foot to be
as dexterous as your right one.

548
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:38,969
- You know what you're talking about?
- Just kidding.

549
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:46,268
But I guess the joke is dead.
I'll stop laughing.

550
00:43:52,572 --> 00:43:53,368
Let me open the door.

551
00:43:56,839 --> 00:43:57,601
Delivery!

552
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,399
- Smells good! - It's food.

553
00:44:03,138 --> 00:44:05,834
- What is it? - Good stuff.

554
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:22,597
This family is most important to you.

555
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:23,703
I envy you.

556
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:26,566
What's more important than family?

557
00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:28,963
If you can be like me, you're blessed.

558
00:44:31,072 --> 00:44:31,936
Food is ready.

559
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:42,631
Wait... Let's have a group pic first.

560
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,737
Sure, we can take the pic while we eat.

561
00:44:43,905 --> 00:44:45,372
No, let's have the pic before we eat.

562
00:44:45,572 --> 00:44:46,869
I cooked this chicken for you.

563
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:48,398
- Have a pic with the chicken.
- With the chicken?

564
00:44:48,572 --> 00:44:51,473
Go ahead. As a memento mori.

565
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:03,898
Good. Done!

566
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:05,266
Let's plunge in.

567
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:08,271
- But the chicken is very cold.
- Let's eat right away.

568
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,337
Wait a minute.

569
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:10,970
Heat it up.

570
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:13,039
We have our standards.

571
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:15,037
- Doesn't matter. We can still eat it.
- Inspector Wong!

572
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:18,537
Just put it in the oven. Very simple.

573
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:29,897
Chicken... 200 degrees...

574
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:31,070
You shouldn't eat...

575
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:32,206
I'll give Inspector Wong a hand.

576
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,229
Is Judy all right?

577
00:47:11,941 --> 00:47:12,908
She's still in the observation ward.

578
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,342
Are you guys OK?

579
00:47:28,108 --> 00:47:29,598
I'm officially taking over
Inspector Wong's duties.

580
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,639
To play safe,
the whole team will take a vacation.

581
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:42,407
They're trying to kill a cop and a witness.

582
00:47:43,274 --> 00:47:44,798
It has to be the Viets.

583
00:47:44,974 --> 00:47:45,998
Why a vacation?

584
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:47,969
I'm concerned about your safety.

585
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,338
Everyone is risking his life.

586
00:47:50,874 --> 00:47:52,034
You want us to lay off?

587
00:47:54,575 --> 00:47:56,736
You're in Admin now. Go first.

588
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:02,308
When I was a snitch,
I was scared every day.

589
00:48:03,108 --> 00:48:04,837
Now that I'm crippled,
I should be better off.

590
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,470
Even my house was bombed.

591
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:08,206
You want me to go?

592
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:11,639
Madam, the uniform is not for showing off.

593
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:14,102
I'll bust them if we have enough evidence.

594
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:15,373
Do we?

595
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,703
Look what the Madam is doing!

596
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,565
Where is Tony?

597
00:49:39,442 --> 00:49:40,602
I dunno.

598
00:49:45,043 --> 00:49:46,533
Enough. You're killing him.

599
00:49:50,143 --> 00:49:53,169
Give me the gun... Give me the gun!

600
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:55,339
Give me the gun!

601
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:01,442
- Give the gun! - He dunno.

602
00:50:02,243 --> 00:50:03,369
You're going to court tomorrow.

603
00:51:35,244 --> 00:51:37,474
Madam, what should we do now?

604
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:43,178
It's most important to find out
where Tony is.

605
00:51:44,378 --> 00:51:46,778
It's most important to protect Wilson
in the hospital.

606
00:51:47,177 --> 00:51:48,644
He's the only witness left.

607
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:52,407
Let's go, Cindy.

608
00:51:52,611 --> 00:51:54,078
Let's go, Yang. Still writing!

609
00:51:57,277 --> 00:52:01,543
I prefer the old you. Don't be a cop.

610
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:10,170
You're crazy...

611
00:52:15,244 --> 00:52:16,871
Mom has a house back home.

612
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:20,675
Let's live with her.

613
00:52:26,945 --> 00:52:27,969
You hate it here?

614
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:34,139
I've been here for long,

615
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:36,801
but it never feels like home.

616
00:52:42,611 --> 00:52:44,238
Mom wants the three...

617
00:52:46,245 --> 00:52:47,906
of us to go back.

618
00:52:54,544 --> 00:52:55,841
Already two months.

619
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:06,311
You don't like it?

620
00:53:22,846 --> 00:53:24,313
Frisk everyone in and out of the hospital.

621
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:26,310
Every entrance and exit, back door,

622
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:27,844
stairwell, toilet...

623
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:29,377
Everywhere. Is that clear?

624
00:53:29,545 --> 00:53:30,512
Yes, sir.

625
00:53:30,879 --> 00:53:32,813
The trial is about to start.
Wilson has to be OK.

626
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:36,545
He's hungry.

627
00:53:37,579 --> 00:53:39,069
Should we buy him some food?

628
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:41,907
I'll buy you something to eat!

629
00:53:48,245 --> 00:53:49,177
Don't run around.

630
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:41,046
Wait, Inspector Ma.

631
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:43,908
Wilson, Inspector Ma asked you
not to run around.

632
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:44,941
Thanks!

633
00:54:58,313 --> 00:55:00,440
Police! Stay away!

634
00:55:13,114 --> 00:55:13,705
There're gunshots at the elevator hallway.

635
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,939
The suspect is in the elevator.
Get help! Fast!

636
00:56:55,981 --> 00:56:56,709
I have her...

637
00:56:57,215 --> 00:56:58,307
OK...

638
00:56:58,614 --> 00:57:00,741
What do you want? Just say it! I'll do it.

639
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:02,446
Are you scared?

640
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:04,476
Yes... Yes...

641
00:57:04,647 --> 00:57:05,705
What do you want?

642
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,280
Just say it! I'll do it.

643
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:20,842
Watch out! Wanna die?

644
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:52,310
Go!

645
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:01,747
Mommy!

646
00:58:04,316 --> 00:58:05,146
Toss me your weapon.

647
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:08,109
Put the girl down!

648
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:10,611
I said toss me your weapon!

649
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:11,749
Give me back my daughter!

650
00:58:13,282 --> 00:58:14,442
I'll blow her head off!

651
00:58:15,149 --> 00:58:17,845
- Put the girl down!
- You want her dead?

652
00:58:35,683 --> 00:58:38,618
How are you, darling?

653
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:45,741
Answer me!

654
01:01:13,984 --> 01:01:15,474
Inspector Ma? What's the situation?

655
01:01:17,651 --> 01:01:18,618
Inspector Ma!

656
01:01:55,585 --> 01:01:56,711
Gotta go to court!

657
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:38,081
Hello...

658
01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:39,317
Wilson, where are you?

659
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:41,214
Off to the court!

660
01:02:42,019 --> 01:02:43,145
Something happened to Judy?

661
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:47,515
Yes!

662
01:02:48,952 --> 01:02:51,785
Don't believe him. He won't let her go.

663
01:02:54,952 --> 01:02:55,646
I got no choice!

664
01:02:56,952 --> 01:02:58,214
Why not?

665
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:00,880
You're choosing to help the bastards.

666
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:03,486
I don't want anything to happen to her.

667
01:03:03,886 --> 01:03:05,353
I don't want anything to happen
to either of you.

668
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:07,313
You wanna die with her?!

669
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,153
I need a statement from you.

670
01:03:46,652 --> 01:03:47,914
You killed the suspect.

671
01:03:49,153 --> 01:03:50,051
Arrest me then.

672
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,784
Witness, you can testify now.

673
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:30,921
I don't remember anything.

674
01:04:38,787 --> 01:04:42,450
Because the witness failed to testify

675
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,744
for loss of memory,

676
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,489
the court rules that
all charges against Archer Sin

677
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:50,220
shall be dismissed for lack of evidence.

678
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:26,879
Tony, I'm out.

679
01:05:48,621 --> 01:05:50,816
Speak! Where?

680
01:05:52,221 --> 01:05:53,017
Nan Shang Wei.

681
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,518
Hurry up. I'll wait for you.

682
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:02,249
Stop fighting. Stop it!

683
01:06:03,454 --> 01:06:04,546
Stop fighting...

684
01:06:05,354 --> 01:06:06,378
Wilson...

685
01:06:07,955 --> 01:06:09,183
<i>Wilson...</i>

686
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:14,016
I never thought I would leave...

687
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:17,146
I just want her to be OK...

688
01:06:17,821 --> 01:06:19,448
Wilson...

689
01:08:45,356 --> 01:08:47,017
Shoot! Shoot, Tony!

690
01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:51,658
Go ahead! Scared?

691
01:08:52,224 --> 01:08:53,054
Drop your piece!

692
01:08:54,057 --> 01:08:55,820
- Drop your piece!
- Drop your motherfucker!

693
01:08:56,224 --> 01:08:57,213
- Asshole!
- Shoot! What you waiting for?

694
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,379
Don't curse my mom!

695
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:22,251
Bro!

696
01:09:52,524 --> 01:09:53,422
Shoot the asshole!

697
01:09:57,991 --> 01:09:58,753
Shit!

698
01:11:50,992 --> 01:11:51,788
Let me drive.

699
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:09,385
Open the door, what do you want?

700
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,857
Open the door, what's the matter?

701
01:12:13,059 --> 01:12:15,118
Come with me. Don't go back.

702
01:12:15,992 --> 01:12:18,927
Don't go. You promised me you wouldn't go.

703
01:12:36,993 --> 01:12:38,187
Ma, come out and fight me.

704
01:12:59,526 --> 01:13:00,220
Shit!

705
01:13:03,559 --> 01:13:04,287
Kenji

706
01:21:30,066 --> 01:21:31,192
You're over, Tony.

707
01:24:43,002 --> 01:24:44,867
Have I ever busted the wrong guy?

708
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:48,394
I'll leave the answer to the judge.

709
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,594
My duty as a cop...

710
01:24:53,668 --> 01:24:54,692
is to catch thieves.
