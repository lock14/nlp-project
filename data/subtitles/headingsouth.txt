00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,800
Sir, can we talk?

3
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
I don't have much time now.

4
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Let me tell you this.

5
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,700
To make it short.

6
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,700
My husband worked in the
Red Cross as a sanitary inspector..

7
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
Then one day...

8
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,700
I don't know why, but...

9
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,700
someone intruded into his office.

10
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,700
Since that day, I did not
see him any further.

11
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,700
Now I don't cry.

12
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
I'm broke. I can't pay for my daughter's college.

13
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Sir, my daughter

14
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
is my big help.

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,700
My daughter is a heavenly creature.

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,700
She is 15 years old and very polite.

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
She likes to be a nurse.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,700
I believe that she will succeed.

19
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,700
Sir, it's a great assumption.

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,700
To believe in it, like you do.

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,600
Execuse me, madam, perhaps I didn't understand.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,700
I want to hand my daughter over to you.

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,600
Madame...

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Look at her.

25
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,700
She came with me, look right there.

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,700
She's wearing yellow.

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,700
You can see she's poor like everybody in this country.- 

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,600
She doesn't have much chance to escape from it.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,700
I take her everywhere I go.

30
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,700t
They would kill me to get her,

31
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,600
I don't want to die, but

32
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
I can't leave her.

33
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Can't leave her.

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,700
I'm begging you, Sir

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,600
Take her with you.

36
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,700
I can't do so.

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Reconsider.

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Look, Sir.

39
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,700
The good and the bad are mingled.

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,600
But each wears a mask.

41
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
wszystko w porz¹dku?

42
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Doskonale.

43
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Don't hesitate to ask for anything.

44
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,600
It's our cook, Denise.

45
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,700
- Good morning, Denise.
- Good morning, Madam.

46
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,700
We serve cold beverages.

47
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,600
Good, thanks.

48
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,600
Denise, help the lady.

49
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,700
Do you need anything, Madam?

50
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,600
No, thank you.

51
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,600
Hey.

52
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,600
Do you still remember me?

53
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,600
Certainly.

54
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,700
How long are you here?

55
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,600
I've just arrived.

56
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,600
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

57
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,700
So you use your Visa a little, don't you?

58
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,600
Yes, I do.

59
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,700
Sorry, I must go.

60
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,600
Later.

61
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Ellen, how about dinner tonight?

62
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,700
- OK.
- See you later. Thanks.

63
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
- Did you eat?
- I'm hungry.

64
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
A sandwich?

65
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
- Two.
- Two sandwiches.

66
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
What beverages?

67
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,700
- Do you want Coke or soda?
- Soda.

68
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Coke and soda, please.

69
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,600
We'll take Coke, soda and two sandwiches.

70
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Hello, Sue, do you like the weather today?

71
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Very much.

72
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,600
- Verry sunny.
- That's why I encamp.

73
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Sure she's got tough skin.

74
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Sue is a lumber jack.

75
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,700
A good strapping girl from the north.

76
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
How can you be so mean. She's a really nice girl.

77
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Sure she is 

78
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,600
Did I ever say on the contrary?

79
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,700
You are really taking care of her.

80
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,700
Unfortunately, I have to.

81
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
It's flattering for me, I guess.

82
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
Do you find me fat?

83
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,700
I'm not guilty. I like women who pay me.

84
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Next man talking about women...

85
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Don't start.

86
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,700
As always, you now how to flatter.

87
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
Did you believe me?

88
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Hope is opium for the people.

89
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,700
A ritch woman is interested in certain men. 

90
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
You are very polite and ritch.

91
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,700
I didn't mean that. I don't want to be fat.

92
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,700
- You are jelous.
- Jelous? It's funny.

93
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,700
I don't want to catch myself on thinking about fatness.

94
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,700
I assure you that, before Rubens,

95
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,700
fat was a sign of sickness. He ended up in museums.

96
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Before what?

97
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Rubens, a Flemish painter.

98
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,600
He painted fat belly, fat thighs...

99
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I would like it.

100
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Take a look around, my dear. You've got everything you want right here.

101
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,600
- Sue?
- Yes?

102
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Do you want to hear something?

103
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,700
No, no, nothing.

104
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,700
Stop, I don't fancy her.

105
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
I know, I'm terribly unfair.

106
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,600
I just can't imagine you in bed with her.

107
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
When does she leave?

108
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,600
I think Saturday.

109
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,600
Ah, our meal.

110
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,600
Thanks.

111
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,600
Take it.

112
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
What is this?

113
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
A German woman gave it to me.

114
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I don't care.

115
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Do you think it's nice?

116
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Certainly, very nice.

117
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,600
You're the one here who's nice.

118
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,600
Hello.

119
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,600
- Hi.
- You're a new guest?

120
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,600
Come and sit down.

121
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
You just got here?

122
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
About two hours ago.

123
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Where are you from?

124
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Savannah, Georgia. And my name is Brenda.

125
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,700
- Oh, hello, Brenda, I'm Ellen. Nice to know you.
- You too.

126
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
Let me introduce you...

127
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,700
- Jessica from London...
- Hi.

128
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,600
and our young friends Chico, Eddie and Ekbar.

129
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,700
- Did you come alone?
- Yes.

130
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,600
Well, welcome to paradise. You're gonna have a ball.

131
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Actually, I already know the place. I was here before.

132
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
Really?

133
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
Yeah, but three years ago.

134
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Three years ago? I don't remember.

135
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,700
It was in September.

136
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,600
Ah, that's why.

137
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,300
BRENDA

138
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,600
The first time I came it was with Mark, my husband.

139
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,600
It all started when Mark took pity on this young boy

140
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
who hadn't eaten two days.

141
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Invited him to eat at our table.

142
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,700
I bet he wasn't too happy about it.

143
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
The boy didn't look a day over 15.

144
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I especially noticed his pretty smile.

145
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Mark told him he could order anything he wanted.

146
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,700
You should have seen him. I never saw anyone eat so much in my life.

147
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,600
When he left, Mark said: "he's a nice young fellow".

148
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Day after day, we started having all our meals with him.

149
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
At that time, he was very shy.

150
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,700
We spent hours with him, discussing his life, his family, his future.

151
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,600
He was in school then.

152
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
We kind of adopted him.

153
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,600
And he seemed to have taken that for granted too.

154
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
One day I...

155
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
It's like just he comes swimming with me.

156
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,700
He took me to a secluded beach.

157
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,700
We were both lying in our bathing suits on a big rock,

158
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,700
basking in the sun.

159
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,700
His body fascinated me.

160
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Long, light, musclar.

161
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Skin glistened.

162
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,700
I couldn't take my eyes off him.

163
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,700
And the later I got the more I was losing my mind

164
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,700
he was lying there beside me, his eyes were shut.

165
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,700
I remember every move

166
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
as if it was yesterday.

167
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,600
I edged my hand over and placed it on his chest.

168
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,700
The boy opened his eyes

169
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
and immediately closed them again. That encouraged me.

170
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,700
And I moved my hand down his body.

171
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Such soft, young skin...

172
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,600
He was motionless.

173
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Then, I...

174
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,700
slipped two fingers into his bathing suit

175
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
and touched his cock.

176
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Almost immediately it starded getting hard,

177
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,600
growing in the palm of my hand until it just poped out.

178
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,700
The his arms were beside his body. He breathed faitly,

179
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,600
but very regurarly.

180
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,700
I looked around to see if no one was coming.

181
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,700
And I threw myself on him.

182
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,700
I literarly threw myself on him.

183
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,700
It was so violent, I couldn't help but scream.

184
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,600
I think I never stopped screaming.

185
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,700
It was my first orgasm.

186
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,600
I was 45.

187
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
He opened his eyes.

188
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
He was exhausted too.

189
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Shy and afraid.

190
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,700
I kissed him all over.

191
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,600
I was crying.

192
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
No, no.

193
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,600
No, Jeremy.

194
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Take care of my horse if you want to do something.

195
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,600
I will take care of Jeremy.

196
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,700
Let me take it, I tied it.

197
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,600
OK, I know how to do it.

198
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
If you're tired let me know.

199
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,600
No.

200
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,700
You go all the way when you invite us.

201
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,600
All the way.

202
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Come on, take it.

203
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,700
No, I'm afraid that I'll get sick.

204
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,600
Give it to me.

205
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,600
- It's strong.
- Ah, OK.

206
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,700
But it was courageous.

207
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,600
Another one. Go for it.

208
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,700
- Do you want it? 
- No.

209
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,700
I will smoke.

210
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,600
No, you? You're much too young. No, no, no. Here.

211
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,600
We were having fun. Why is it over now?

212
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,600
Devil's nature.

213
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Are you going for a swim?

214
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I don't know what I was thinking. I was a child.

215
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Oh, come with others. Nothing to worry about.

216
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,600
Here everything is different.

217
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,600
- We don't know you were yet, my dear.
- You will see.

218
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,700
C'mon, Ellen. I'm sure in this room there are lots of men

219
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
that attracted to you.

220
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,700
No, I'm telling you. They aren't the least bit of horny.

221
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
When I see them on the beach,

222
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
they remind me of the big white whales wallowing in the sand..

223
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
More red than white, in fact.

224
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,700
The red whales can't be horny, don't they?

225
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,700
If you're over 40 and not as dumb as a fashion model,

226
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,700
the only guys who pay interest are natural born losers

227
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
or husbands whose wifes are cheating on them.

228
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
So thanks a lot.

229
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Not every kind of guy. You know very well that you're beautiful.

230
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,700
I'm 55 years old, kiddo.

231
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,600
I think you're very beautiful.

232
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,700
Well, thank you, Brenda.

233
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,700
But at the same time, let's be honest. Here, I don't even notice whites.

234
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,700
We're too busy sitting beside blacks, no?

235
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,700
If blacks turn you on so much, you must've been born in Montreal.

236
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,700
- There's new shortage of blacks up there.
- Well, that's for sure.

237
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,700
At the plant in my workshop the act is stand.

238
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,700
And you never dated any of them?

239
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,700
No way.

240
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
At home black guys don't interest me.

241
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
Here, they are very different.

242
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
It's true.

243
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,700
You're right, I don't know why.

244
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,600
Is it because they're closer to nature? Is it the sun?

245
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Anyway, they're more

246
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,600
gracious.

247
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,700
The big differece, sweetheart, is that here you see them stripped to the waist.

248
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,700
I don't know if it's just that.

249
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,700
I know you don't know it, but I'm sure of it.

250
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,600
And I'm also sure it's precisely why you came back here.

251
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,700
So stop pretending.

252
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,700
You didn't come here just to get a nice tan.

253
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,700
I mean think of those cute guys. They're a dime in dozen.

254
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Take your pick.

255
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
- Ellen.
- Am I shocking you?

256
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Why am I shocking you?

257
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Have a little...

258
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
- Well, it's a bit...
- Listen.

259
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,700
I will let you in in something.

260
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm crazy about love.

261
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Sex or love. I'm not sure anymore.

262
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,600
I was told myself that when I'm old I'd pay a young man to love me.

263
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,700
I just didn't think it would happen so fast.

264
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
Other than that, I have no problem with it.

265
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,600
And, Brenda, listen to me. You shouldn't either.

266
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,600
What you're shy to pay them are certain gifts.

267
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
I know you aren't asleep. Hello, do you remember me?

268
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,700
Ellen.

269
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,600
- It's difficult to forget.
- Cheater.

270
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
You are very beautiful, like a doe.

271
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Beautiful doe.

272
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Me? Beautiful doe?

273
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,700
I look at you and I think you're a doe.

274
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,700
And what about you?

275
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
I suppose you're a tiger?

276
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
Exactly.

277
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
Tiger.

278
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,600
No, stop, I don't like you like this.

279
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,600
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,700
I don't want to disappoint you.

281
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
What do you want?

282
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,600
You think it's about you.

283
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,700
It looks good.

284
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Do you want me to kiss you?

285
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
No.

286
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,700
It's OK with me.

287
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
Don't people need tenderness?

288
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,700
Yes, but I'm not in a hurry, I don't have the need.

289
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,700
A little Saló.

290
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,600
Come on, lay on the stomach.

291
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,600
Wait, don't move.

292
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,700
What do you do?

293
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Don't move.

294
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Are you charmed?

295
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,700
Or do you hold me up to ridicule?

296
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,700
I want to see your sleeping face and your neck.

297
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,600
Whatever you like.

298
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,700
What do you want to do later?

299
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
I don't know.

300
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
Let's go to the beach at 5.

301
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,600
It's OK with me.

302
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,600
- Later.
- OK.

303
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,700
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Ebgar.

304
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,600
!Personal privacy.

305
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,700
OK, prepare the food and I'll take care of the tables.

306
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,600
Don't interrupt us.

307
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:51,800
I am 55.

308
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,600
Let me tell you there's nothing in Boston for a woman after 40.

309
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,700
Don't tell me it's otherwise.

310
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,700
I was in all those bars of that damn snobbish city.

311
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:11,700
But neither from near nor from far there's nothing resembling to that in here.

312
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,700
I do not hope that the
affair develops thus

313
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,600
A boy born in NY is the same goat as that born here.

314
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm on a pile of shit.

315
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,600
I was always drawn by the South.

316
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,700
But I've never thought about Port-au-Prince.

317
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,700
I don't believe it really exists.

318
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,700
It's like a cattle farm.

319
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Yet it's the 6th time

320
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,700
I arrive here annually.

321
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,700
And I spend the whole summer here.

322
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
Each time I stay in this hotel.

323
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,600
It's calm, neat...

324
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,600
The beach is beautiful.

325
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,600
And I feel like coming home.

326
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,700
I have the opportunity to have a good holiday.

327
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
I am a professor at Wesley.

328
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,700
I teach French literature.

329
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,600
I'm trying to delay catching my husband red-handed.

330
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,700
Sometimes, in the process of grizzling in the hallway we discover

331
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,700
that the guy left us.

332
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,600
I cry my story of a fat cat.

333
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,600
We descend during the number two and the next day it's forgotten.

334
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,600
We come back to be exposed like a small dove of peace.

335
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,700
I don't ever see my little companion like this.

336
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
I guess he resembles everybody.

337
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,600
I don't know.

338
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,60
When they cry you see they're those martyred teenyboppers.

339
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Perhaps they like to see a woman cry.

340
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,600
I don't.

341
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
You never go to the city?

342
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,700
I like the market. It's cheap there.

343
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,600
I buy sculptures, paintigs...

344
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,700
I take it all home. It's cluttered.

345
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,700
As for me, the less I move the better it is.

346
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,600
I prefer staying in calmness right here.

347
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
I want to go.

348
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,600
Just to see it.

349
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,700
Anna and Andrea are invited to the Presidential Palace this evening.

350
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,600
It's a party.

351
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,700
I'm talking about that minister of something...

352
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,700
There'll be about a hundred of people.

353
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,700
And after the meal they'll talk about how to feed the city.

354
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,700
And besides

355
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,700
All the money, all the waste...

356
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,700
I don't know for sure.

357
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,700
I don't know why you say this.

358
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,600
You said it.

359
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Do you know the name of this drink?

360
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,600
Tequila Sunrise.

361
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,700
You know why?

362
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Sunrise means the Sun in English.

363
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Like the Sun rising on the horizon.

364
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I don't care for the name.

365
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,700
It's good. I got to go now.

366
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,700
Mabye take Brenda to the city.

367
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,600
Another time. Bye.

368
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

369
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,700
I have no money to pay for the beverage.

370
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
I can't find it here.

371
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,600
I have it.

372
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Take it. Bye.

373
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,600
Have a nice evening.

374
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:24,600
Is it so bad? A night with girls alone?

375
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,600
Did you see? It was for you. 

376
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,700
You have a fan here!

377
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,700
I don't look at the boys, I am watching the game.

378
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,700
You are not interested in football now?

379
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,700
You would think it's boyswho are interested in football.

380
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Be careful.

381
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,700
I like the boy over there.

382
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,600
You mean me?

383
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Not, I mean Edie.

384
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,700
Tell me how come they all fall for you?

385
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
I will explain later.

386
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,600
I still have a game to win.

387
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Help him, give him a piece of advice.

388
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,700
He's pitiful, help him.

389
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,700
Your problem is what you speak about a lot.

390
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Than what should I do? Take my clothes off?

391
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,700
No, wear good clothes.

392
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,700
But if I come, they all walk away.

393
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Perhaps you are right.

394
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,700
Yes.

395
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Is it all?

396
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Everybody's characteristics is different.

397
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,700
You are just a friend, not a lover.

398
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,600
This is also quite good.

399
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
Sir, 10 gourdes.

400
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
You know who you talk to?

401
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,700
You can't talk like that.

402
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Show me your licence! Show your papers!

403
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,600
You always take 10 gourdes?

404
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,600
He did nothing to you!

405
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,600
Do you have a problem?

406
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,600
Not, all right.

407
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,600
Execuse me, madam, we can't serve him.

408
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Why not?

409
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,700
These are the rules.

410
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,700
But I want to eat with him.

411
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,700
He is my guest guest, that's all.

412
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:15,700
Invited or not, this is impossible.

413
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,700
This is unbelievable!

414
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,700
He eats with us on the beach all day.

415
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,700
You can eat there with whoever you want.

416
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,700
But this is a restaurant.

417
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I'm asking for the second time, give him the menu.

418
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,700
Anyway, Madam, the kitchen is closed.

419
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,600
But I believe it's at least warm.

420
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,700
We've got chicken, Madam.

421
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Do you want chicken?

422
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,700
Yes, I like chicken.

423
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,600
And give him a drink, please.

424
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,700
It's incredible how racist they can be!

425
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,600
There are idiots everywhere.

426
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,700
I was born in Cap-Haitien before moving here.

427
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,700
My family is nationalist.

428
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,700
They all fought Americans

429
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,700
during the occupation since 1915. 

430
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,600
My father died not having seen a white lady.

431
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,700
It was his distress.

432
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,700
He used to say that if I see a white

433
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,700
I have to run away.

434
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,700
My grandfather didn't experience that danger.

435
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,600
Whites were just animals for him.

436
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,700
When he thought about whites,

437
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,700
it was equivalent to Americans.

438
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,700
What's sad,

439
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,600
the invaders desired the land.

440
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,700
If he only had known Americans are here,

441
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,700
he would have come from dead.

442
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,700
Those follies are not to love them.

443
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,600
They are a bit more than just a status we gain.

444
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,600
Dollar

445
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,700
Result? Everybody, who had contact with it, is corrupted.

446
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,600
All paid for it.

447
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,700
And that's when Brenda discovered she's a bitch in need.

448
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Ellen, please.

449
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,600
Like us all, darling!

450
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Hello, big boy, is it a feast today

451
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,700
going to the restaurant?

452
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,700
Brenda invited me.

453
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,700
Yes, I saw it.

454
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,700
Do you want to take a walk if you finished?

455
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,600
I'm hungry but we can go.

456
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,700
Eventually, she takes all that she wants.

457
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,600
It's about time.

458
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,700
Everything resembles what Ellen left in Boston.

459
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,700
That's what life is.

460
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,600
SUE

461
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,600
A discreet woman feeling different 'cause of her British accent.

462
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,700
But here, like the Sun, it's a part of the picture.

463
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,700
So everybody is sunburnt or dead, we must go uphill.

464
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:30,700
But the boys are crazy about her.

465
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,700
Only she achieved this.

466
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,700
I work in a company

467
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
that sells food processors.

468
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
I work in a warehouse,

469
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,700
only with men.

470
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,700
I'm good with it.

471
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,700
We sometimes make each other laugh

472
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,600
after the work. But I don't find them too attracitve.

473
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,700
I slept with one of co-workers.

474
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,700
And then I thought of what I'd done.

475
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,700
However now he didn't work with me.

476
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,700
He took my interest when I saw him.

477
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,700
But it's not like I wanted him all to myself.

478
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,700
Imbecil.

479
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,600
He thought that mabye I consider getting married or something.

480
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:21,600
But I wasn't.

481
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,700
We had good sex. But that's all.

482
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,600
It ended like I could've never imagined.

483
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,700
I know that I am a lonely person.

484
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,700
However, when I arrive here, I feel like a butterfly.

485
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,600
I have no obligations here.

486
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,700
And Neptun.

487
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,700
It's not complicated with him.

488
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,600
I think that I love him.

489
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,700
I really love him.

490
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,700
I know that it functions only here, but

491
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,700
here, it is like that.

492
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,700
Everything is different.

493
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,600
It's better.

494
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,700
So...

495
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,700
What will you give me?

496
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,700
I give you...

497
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,700
I give you my heart.

498
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,500
I don't care about your heart.

499
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,600
What have you got for me?

500
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
That you want what?

501
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
What do you want?

502
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Let me think.

503
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,500
What does make you feel happy?

504
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,600
A passport.

505
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Why do you think that I this?

506
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Miss Savannah already suggested it?

507
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,600
- Who is Miss Savannah?
- Brenda.

508
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,600
- You are here alone.
- But did she suggest it?

509
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
But...

510
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
I don't want to have a passport.

511
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:26,500
That's your answer.

512
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,500
So...

513
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
I don't like this.

514
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,500
- Really?
- I don't like how you behave around me. You're too playful.

515
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,600
You're too old for that.

516
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,500
Thanks.

517
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,600
Look at me.

518
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,600
You're very beautiful.

519
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,600
You have beautiful hair.

520
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,500
And now you act like a juvenile flapper.

521
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
What's the matter?

522
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,600
- I have enough.
- You're already having no fun?

523
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Can't you swim?

524
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,600
- I can teach you.
- If you want...

525
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,600
OK.

526
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,600
Relax, lay on the water.

527
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,500
Relax.

528
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,500
Get on the car!

529
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
What are you doing here?

530
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,600
Where are we going?

531
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,600
Execuse me, you don't have to be afraid.

532
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,500
However this is only way I could talk to you.

533
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,600
What do you want?

534
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,600
A little bit trust.

535
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,500
You're in a deep shit.

536
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Ekbar, please, it's not a nice thing to say.

537
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,600
I have nothing to say.

538
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,500
So listen.

539
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,600
One evening,

540
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,600
2 month ago,

541
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,600
I went on a wake.

542
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,600
Colonel Beauvais was also there

543
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,600
with his the wife and his daughter.

544
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,600
He looked so seriously,

545
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,600
I didn't think that he noticed me.

546
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
The day after,

547
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,600
Frank appeared looking for me.

548
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,600
I don't know how he found me.

549
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,500
These persons will get what they want.

550
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,600
He didn't give ma any choice.

551
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
Did he hurt you?

552
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,600
No, it's not like that.

553
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,600
It's about jewellery, smile,

554
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,600
gifts, roses.

555
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,500
But when you already know who gives you

556
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:03,600
jewellery, smile,

557
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
just for trying to please him,

558
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,600
he can beat every imbecil who crosses your way.

559
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,600
You should understand that all of it

560
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,500
is as cold as a machine gun on your neck.

561
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,600
But you like it.

562
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,600
No, Ekbar.

563
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Don't blame me if you're to blame too.

564
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,600
It's not a moral lesson for you.

565
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,600
Take a look around, look at my younger sister.

566
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,600
Mary is nice for everyone.

567
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,600
She's still sleeping with him, cleaning after him.

568
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,500
What about your cousin Makenson, who repairs tires?

569
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,500
He humiliates himself everyday?

570
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,500
Tell me... You and me.

571
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,600
Are we made for that?

572
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,500
No.

573
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,600
Do you agree?

574
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,600
It doesn't explain why I'm in the car.

575
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,600
What are you trying to say?

576
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,500
Do you want me to kill colonel?

577
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,600
No. Listen...

578
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,600
I am alone.

579
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,600
I need a friend, a friend who I can talk to.

580
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,500
Without controlling what I said.

581
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,600
I need someone trustworthy, a true friend.

582
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,600
It's the first time I feel so freely.

583
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,600
I had many lovers but no friends.

584
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,500
Can you hold me in your arms?

585
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,600
Frank...

586
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,600
Did you see this boy? He is my friend.

587
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,500
Take a good look.

588
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Do you hear me?

589
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,500
I tell you that this is my only friend.

590
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,600
Frank is my guardian angel.

591
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:12,600
He can also be yours.

592
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,500
Now, when he accepted you, no one can hurt you.

593
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
It's late, Mademoiselle.

594
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,600
2 minutes, Frank.

595
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,600
I have to go,

596
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,600
but promise me something.

597
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Promise me we'll see each other again.

598
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,600
We can meet at my mother's house, or at your mother's.

599
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
She would be happy.

600
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,600
She loves stories about you, when I come see her.

601
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,600
She would like us to see each other.

602
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,600
She would be very happy.

603
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,500
Do you agree?

604
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,600
Who is she?

605
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,600
She can't be staying at the hotel, I've never seen her.

606
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,600
Go and ask him if you're so interested.

607
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,500
All I can say she was escorted tonight by a charming little brut of a guy.

608
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,600
Brenda, if I were to advice,

609
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,500
give him a free rain.

610
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
Look who's talking!

611
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,600
If you are here for a husband,
you've come to the wrong adress.

612
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,600
Ekbar belongs to everyone.

613
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
He makes the decisions.

614
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,500
So, madams,

615
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,600
What do you think about?

616
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,600
What's the matter?

617
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,600
You look tense.

618
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,500
Come, relax.

619
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Are they yours?

620
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,500
It looks good, doesn't it.

621
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,600
You don't like them?

622
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,600
You bought it for him.

623
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,600
Yes, I did. Did I need your permission?

624
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,600
When will we stop discuising him?

625
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,600
It's not for him.

626
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,600
He looks like a black guy from Harlem.

627
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,600
Don't come to Haiti if that's what you're looking for.

628
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,600
What did you say?

629
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,600
I said that you look like a guy from Harlem now.

630
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,600
You don't like guys from Harlem?

631
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,500
No, I don't.

632
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,600
Would you like to dance?

633
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,500
Yes.

634
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,600
It's that.

635
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,500
Take her dancing, it'll make you feel good, but have courage.

636
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,600
For three years you were all I could think of.

637
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,500
I missed you. I missed you so much.

638
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,600
It's like an addiction. My whole body ached.

639
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,600
My head, my belly...

640
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,500
It's just agony, every day, every night...

641
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,500
Especially every night.

642
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,600
Do you feel sad?

643
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,600
A little. Can I accompany you?

644
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,500
I you want...

645
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,500
What's the matter, young gentleman?

646
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,500
I will be gentle like this.

647
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,500
No, my dear, I prefer to be alone.

648
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,500
- Will we go there?
- If you want...

649
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,500
Madam, can I take a picture of you?

650
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,500
Thanks.

651
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,600
- What is it?
- Herbs.

652
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:59,600
What's the prics?

653
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,500
OK.

654
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:54,500
What do you want to eat?

655
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,600
You can't be sure.

656
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:20,600
He wasn't born yesterday and he knows his way around the city better than anyone.

657
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,600
I'm telling you. The guy shot at him!

658
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,600
The cops would have told you if they found anyone.

659
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,600
No way! The guy was a cop if I've ever saw one.

660
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,600
Don't exaggerate.

661
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,600
Did they treat you OK?

662
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,600
They don't like a white woman worrying about a black guy.

663
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,600
They almost knocked me down, that's what they did.

664
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,600
You'll be OK, you'll be fine.

665
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,500
Today you spent all day together.

666
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
Yeah...

667
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,600
Today things were fine.

668
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,600
I bought him a lot of presents.

669
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,600
He was happy.

670
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,600
I even think he was in love with me.

671
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,500
He looked at me in a way he never did before.

672
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,600
Brenda, c'mon, Brenda.

673
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,600
Calm down.

674
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,600
Or you want some tranquilizers?

675
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,600
Want me to get you some?

676
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,500
In my purse... There must be some left.

677
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,600
Valium?

678
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,500
Do you take a lot of it?

679
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Are you crazy? Three?

680
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,600
In this heat and with what you drank, it's enough to knock down a mule.

681
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,500
It won't do anything for me anymore.

682
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,500
Come in.

683
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,600
Madam, he is there.

684
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,600
Is he OK?

685
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,500
- I think yes.
- Thank you.

686
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,500
Can I talk to you?

687
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,500
Come.

688
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
Go out, go out.

689
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,600
- What do you want?
- She thought you were dead.

690
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,600
What did you think?

691
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,600
Who is that guy?

692
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,500
Answer me now. What happened?

693
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,500
Your silence won't make me help you.

694
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,600
Think about it tomorrow.

695
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,600
Mabye you will forget about it.

696
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,600
If you need anything, you ask me for it.

697
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,600
We will find a solution for everything.

698
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,600
- Listen, you're not my mother.
- What?

699
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,600
You are not my mother.

700
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,600
It's not the right moment to take offence.

701
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,500
Don't you understand?

702
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,500
I am really frightened.

703
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,600
Can't you see that I want to help you?

704
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,600
If you need money, you can ask for it.

705
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,600
This is not a problem, you should know.

706
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,600
However you have to stay with me in the hotel.

707
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,600
Don't go anywhere.

708
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,500
Now go with me to my room.

709
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,500
Ekbar.

710
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,600
Ekbar.

711
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,600
If you're in danger

712
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,600
I can protect you.

713
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,600
I am rich and respected here.

714
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:51,600
I can take you abroad, arrange a passport for you.

715
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,600
Tomorrow, if you want.

716
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
You wold be stupid.

717
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,600
You can go stay with me.

718
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,600
We can always be together.

719
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,600
You can do nothing.

720
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,600
Only thoroughly enjoy your life.

721
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,500
You could walk the streets without fear. Ask yourself.

722
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,500
Ekbar, Ekbar.

723
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,600
Where are you going?

724
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,500
Brenda?

725
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,600
I see you've found the path. It's been 15 days. Where have you been?

726
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
You look tired.

727
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,600
I was worried.

728
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,600
I don't know where you go.

729
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,500
You are very tired.

730
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,600
Didn't you sleep?

731
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,600
Tell me where you slept.

732
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,500
- I slept.
- Where?

733
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,500
Do you want anything? Food?

734
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Do you want a coffee?

735
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,500
Yes, thanks.

736
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,600
I am very tired.

737
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,600
I seeked in the hospital, in the prison...

738
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,600
I asked your friends

739
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,600
if they know where Mister could be.

740
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,600
Mister is bad, he brings havoc to the streets.

741
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,500
I'm tired of him.

742
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,600
I have little to give you

743
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,600
but you can return to living here.

744
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,600
You should live together with your mum.

745
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,600
Mum, don't say it again!

746
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,600
I worry about you!

747
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,500
You worry me.

748
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,600
I'll give you this.

749
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,600
Where did you earn the money?

750
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,500
I worked.

751
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:32,500
Thank you.

752
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,500
Gotta go, mum.

753
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,600
Poor Brenda!

754
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,600
She's in pain...

755
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,600
Such pain!

756
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,600
Ellen, please.

757
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,600
What were you thinking of, Brenda?

758
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,500
Marrying  him? Taking him to Savannah, Georgia?

759
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,500
Mrs. Ekbar.

760
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,600
Everything was fine 'till you got here.

761
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,600
We led a simple life.

762
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,600
Then you arrived.

763
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,600
Dragging along your romantic love,

764
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,600
Your goddamn syropy love.

765
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,600
You convinced yourself Ekbar was a love of your life.

766
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,600
You wanted him all to yourself.

767
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,600
Let me tell you something. You're not better than the rest of us.

768
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,600
We're all here for a good time, that's all.

769
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,600
But we don't kid ourselves, we don't cheat.

770
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,600
You don't think you can just show up and upset everyone 

771
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,500
just because some kid gave you an orgasm.

772
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,500
He's dead now. Your stupidity kill him.

773
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,600
Romance is over. Welcome to Haiti!

774
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,600
Didn't you realize no one is allowed to grow too tall in this country?

775
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,600
That's enough, Ellen.

776
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,600
Who are you to talk like that?

777
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,600
Everyone here knows you're suffering too.

778
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,600
Everyone knows you were madly in love with Ekbar.

779
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,500
Mabye.

780
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,500
But I respected him.

781
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,600
Don't you want to wait a few days before leaving?

782
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:48,500
You shouldn't take off in a hurry.

783
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:54,600
I'm sure Ellen is already sorry for what she said.

784
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,500
Like you, she's still in a state of shock.

785
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:03,500
Can you hear me, Brenda?

786
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,600
Of course I can hear you.

787
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,500
Are you all right?

788
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,500
I'm fine.

789
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,600
I know it's tough for you, but

790
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,500
you should go talk to her.

791
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,600
It doesn't matter anymore.

792
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,500
What was that?

793
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:38,600
I said it didn't matter anymore.

794
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,600
In what way?

795
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,600
I don't give a damn what Ellen thinks.

796
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,500
That's a step forward.

797
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,500
The most important thing is that you should go home at peace with your heart.

798
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,500
At peace with my heart...

799
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,600
What is it?

800
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,600
Nothing.

801
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,600
Stop looking at me that way.

802
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:11,600
What have I done to you?

803
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,600
The way you look at me is more than enough.

804
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,600
I'm sick of those looks that say "poor Brenda, crazy as ever".

805
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:18,600
I never think anything like that.

806
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,600
Your look thinks for you, sweetheart.

807
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,600
I hate the way people look at me, I've always hated that.

808
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,500
I mean my husband looked at me, the way my family or my friends did.

809
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,600
Maybe Ellen's right.

810
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,600
Mabye I didn't love Ekbar.

811
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,500
All I know is I loved the way he looked at me.

812
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:54,500
I certainly loved that.

813
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,800
When did he leave the hotel?

814
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,600
I don't know.

815
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,600
At 10?

816
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,600
Write down 10:30.

817
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,500
OK, I won't bother you anymore.

818
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:28,600
- Is it all?
- Excuse me?

819
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,600
Don't you want to know why we quarreled?

820
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:36,500
I don't feel that your quarrel would bring anything up.

821
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,600
What do you know about that?

822
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,600
Execuse me madam, but Ekbar wasn't a saint.

823
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:49,500
A boy like him had million reasons to end up like that.

824
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:52,600
I think you didn't know him.

825
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,600
You know nothing about Ekbar.

826
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,600
I'm sorry, madam.

827
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,500
I can't understand.

828
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:04,600
It's all so simple for you.

829
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,600
But there was a murder.

830
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,600
There, on that beach, two persons died.

831
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,600
Don't you feel that this is a very dangerous affair?

832
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:14,600
Tell her from me that

833
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,500
it wasn't a tourist who died.

834
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:20,500
Goodbye, madam.

835
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,600
What did he say, Albert?

836
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,600
What did he say?

837
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:30,500
He said that...

838
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:35,500
He is said that tourists don't die.

839
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:51,600
Did you know her?

840
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,600
Who?

841
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,600
That young woman on the beach, did you know her?

842
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:00,500
No, I've never seen her.

843
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,600
It interests me who started a quarrel which ended like that.

844
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,600
Since I have nothing to say I will go back to my life.

845
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,500
He wanted to stay overnight with Brenda.

846
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,600
And that young girl...

847
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,600
Mabye he truly loved her.

848
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,600
Do you think so? Perhaps someone killed them when they were making love.

849
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,500
Stop, you torture yourself.

850
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,600
What do I do here?

851
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,600
I already don't know.

852
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,500
I want to go home, to my husband.

853
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,500
Mabye he's waiting there.

854
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,500
He was so beautiful.

855
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:58,500
I wanted to look at him for hours.

856
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,600
I could almost touch him.

857
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,500
Two times, I...

858
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:10,600
wanted to die but he didn't stay in my body.

859
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,500
If not for this I would have done everything without a fear.

860
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:20,500
I wanted to be ready for him.

861
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,600
Sometimes I imagined myself with my friend,

862
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,600
a trifle of me,

863
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:31,500
like all the others.

864
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,500
But now it's all the same,

865
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,500
I've never suffered so much.

866
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,600
Goodbye, Albert.

867
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,600
Goodbye, madam.

868
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,500
Have the courage.

869
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,600
Of course I won't go back home.

870
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,500
Besides, I don't have a house anymore. Or husband.

871
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,600
I want nothing to do with men from the north.

872
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,600
I want to visit other island on the Caribbean.

873
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:18,600
Cuba,

874
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,600
Guadelupe,

875
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,600
Barbados,

876
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,600
Martinique,

877
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:25,600
Trinidad,

878
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,600
Bahamas.

879
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:31,600
They have such lovely names.

880
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,500
I want to know them all.

881
01:40:35,305 --> 01:40:41,314
Better than Tinder on
