I need to speak with him.
- Excuse me. Do you remember me?
- Can I help you?
I bought some tickets
from you last September.
On the 12th.
Clifton.
I was with my daughter.
She was abducted downstairs,
on the lower level.
She was 6 at the time.
She has red hair
and she came up to about here.
She's wearing jeans and a...
a purple jacket and...
she has a dark blue backpack.
And the jacket has a hood.
No, I haven't seen her.
I'm sorry.
We sell hundreds of tickets a day.
I just thought she might
have shown up.
Or someone
might have seen her.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me, sir.
- Have you seen this girl?
- No.
She's my daughter.
She's 7 years old, she--
Excuse me.
I'm looking for my daughter.
This is her picture.
She was abducted last September.
She's wearing jeans,
and a purple coat.
- It has a hood.
- I'm sorry, I haven't seen her.
Excuse me.
Have you seen this girl?
Please,
this is my daughter.
Can you help me, please?
Please, I need your help...
She wanted some candy.
Someone took her right here.
God, they took her right
in front of me!
How long was it?
It couldn't be that long!
How long did we talk?
10 minutes.
10 minutes.
10 minutes, no way.
Think! How long?
How long?
"Hi, we're at the station,
we're gonna get on the bus".
40 seconds.
"Yes, I'll bring her back by 6 o'clock".
"I know, I know".
"No, I won't bring her back late".
A minute and a half.
Maybe two.
"Yeah, I'll make sure
she does her homework".
We talked about her homework.
3 and a half minutes.
4 minutes tops.
4 minutes.
"You wanna speak with her?
Yeah, hang on".
Yeah, 4 minutes.
4 minutes, that's all.
4 minutes,
look around.
There must be something.
How did they get her out of here?
4:30 to Carlstadt.
She wouldn't have gone with anyone.
Get tickets ready.
Where did they go?
They've got on that bus.
They left on another bus.
Go, go.
Go, just go.
No cash accepted.
No cash accepted.
It's too late.
It's too late.
Get on the bus, just go.
Don't look around.
Just go.
Can I pass, please?
There it is!
Was it purple?
Get off. Now.
Get off.
Can you stop the bus!
Can you stop the bus!
I have to get off.
Can you stop the bus?
- You got to sit down!
- Stop the fucking bus!
Sophie!
Where are you, Sophie?
Where are you?
Sophie, where are you?
You did it.
It was your fault.
You let her go.
You stink!
It's OK.
Everything's OK.
Everything's gonna be OK.
Hey, I can't get in my room.
There's a lock on the handle.
- What number?
- 301.
You owe a day on the room.
$40.
I'll take it for another week.
320 plus tax.
It's 364.80.
How much?
364 dollars and 80 cents.
Well, I haven't got enough.
Can you cash a check?
It's a federal check.
- You're on disability?
- Yes.
It's 5% service charge.
I'll need to see some ID.
I got to get some sleep.
Get some rest.
Lie down.
It'll pass.
It'll pass. Lay down.
Get some sleep.
Get some rest.
Excuse me.
I wanna get this for my daughter.
She's about the same size as your girl.
- How old is she?
- 7.
- Angie?
- Do you think it'll fit?
Angela, come here.
Yeah, I think so.
It's her size.
How about this?
Oh, this is too big.
Yes, this size is 12.
She's her size?
She takes the size 8.
Thanks.
You have to be presentable
when you get her back.
You're her father.
You need to set a good example.
Hi! Is this Ray?
It's William.
William Keane.
Is Ann there?
Hey, hang on!
Hang on a second!
Is she there?
Look, I just wanna talk to her.
Well, when will she be back?
Will you tell her I called
and I'll try again?
Thanks.
A vodka.
Keep going.
Another.
Hey, how do I hear the music?
Can I hear the music!
Louder.
Can you make it louder?
I can barely hear it!
It's loud enough.
Come on, man! I paid for it!
Turn it up!
You turn up the music!
If you don't like it,
get the fuck out!
Will you turn up the music?
Get off the chair.
Get off the the fucking chair!
What's up?
I need some coke.
How many?
Two.
I see you.
I see all of you.
4:26.
It's a sign.
4:30 to Carlstadt.
He took her on the 4:30.
He's here.
He's right here.
4:28.
OK, just wait.
Tell me why
the stars do shine
Tell me why
the ivy twines
Tell me why
the skies are blue
And I will tell you
just why I love you
Because God made
the stars to shine
Because God made
the ivy twine
Because God made
the sky so blue
Because God made you
that's why I love you...
What time is it?
There's still a minute.
One more minute.
He's here.
I can feel it.
He's coming.
Look at the gate,
keep looking at the gate.
Just look at the gate.
Watch the gate.
It's not him.
It's still too early.
It's still too early.
Just wait.
He's gonna come.
He's here.
I know it.
Think!
Think!
4:30 to Carlstadt, gate 8.
They took the 4:30, gate 8.
Why isn't he using it?
Why isn't he using the gate?
Because he knows you're watching.
Oh my God, he knows who you are.
He's seen you.
He's looking at you right now.
Where is he?
He's looking at you right now.
Move! Move!
You got to move! Move!
Wait! You have to go after him.
You have to turn the tables.
He's not coming after you.
You have to get him.
He's here. He's right here.
Come on!
He knows you know.
Wait.
He's going to leave.
He's on his way out.
Hurry, you have to go.
Now!
Look.
There he is.
That's him.
That's him.
Just keep going.
Go, go.
Where is she?
What did you do to her?
Where is she?
Someone get the cops!
Walk, walk.
Stay calm.
Nobody's looking at you.
Breathe.
Your boss,
what did he say?
He says until Wednesday morning.
This Wednesday?
There's no way,
I won't have it by then.
What can I do?
It's out of my hands.
It's out of your hands?
So what's gonna happen?
Oh, so long as it's not
your problem, right?
What should I tell her, huh?
She's 7.
Tell her whatever you want.
You're her mother.
That's right, I am her mother.
Fucking asshole!
Fuck you!
What's gonna happen on Wednesday?
I don't wanna talk about it.
- Kira, give me the bag.
- It's all right, I got it.
Kira, give me the bag!
Hold on.
Could you please pick up your feet?
Thank you.
Who is it?
Hi, my name is William Keane,
I'm staying down the hall.
- Can I help you?
- Who is it?
Kira, get ready for bed! Now.
Now!
What do you want? -I overheard
your conversation in the lobby.
Yeah, is there a problem?
No, no,
there's no problem.
I just wanted to give you something
to help you out, and your little girl.
No, no... that's not necessary.
Thanks.
It's a $100. It'll help you
pay for the next couple of nights.
No, we're fine.
Really.
OK.
It's not what you think, it's--
Yeah, I know you don't know me...
But look... Please,
I want you to have it.
Why?
I just want to help out.
That's all you want?
Yeah, that's all.
Look, I've been in
your position before...
and I know what is like and, um...
Please, please take it.
Thanks, I really appreciate it.
It's William.
- And what's your name?
- Lynn.
It's really nice of you.
Thank you.
Well, maybe I'll see you
around... some time.
OK, see you around.
It's really late, I got to go.
You're so fucking hot!
It's taken!
Hang on,
just hang on.
I want one more.
- Come here.
- Just hang on a second!
One for you.
God, you're so beautiful.
Really?
Think I am?
I wanna be inside of you.
It's my shoe.
God, you're so good!
Be careful!
I'm not using anything.
Is it good?
Keep going.
Yeah, that's it.
Go on.
Come on!
What are you doing?
Did you just come inside me?
What the fuck, did you hear me!
Jesus Christ!
Fuck!
Get the fuck out of here!
Fucking asshole!
Hey, I'm looking for work.
Are you the manager?
Over there.
Where? In the garage?
Thanks.
Hey, is the manager in?
What do you want?
I'm looking for a job.
Omar!
- Can I help you?
- Hey, you've got any work?
I don't have anything right now.
Any part-time?
Pump-gas, whatever...
Sorry, I don't have anything.
Hey, I'm looking for a job.
Do you need any help?
Is this a bad time?
No, not at all.
Have you eaten yet?
I got a bunch of take-out.
Do you wanna join me
and my daughter?
Sure. When?
Whenever you're ready.
There's no rush.
OK. Give me a minute.
- OK. 314.
- OK, great.
- Come on in.
- Thanks.
- Come in. Do you want a beer?
- Sure.
Kira, can you say hi to William?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Have a seat.
Do you like Cuban food?
- It's chicken, rice and beans.
- Sure. Great.
What are you doing?
Your homework?
You're learning how to tell time?
Kira, go wash your hands,
we're gonna eat.
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Kira?
- I'm going.
How long have you been here?
Here in the hotel?
8 or 9 days.
Since...
the Sunday before last.
Just came from Clifton to try
and find some work in the city.
What do you do?
I'm a painter.
Houses,
I paint houses.
I do some construction sometimes,
and that stuff.
Have you had any luck?
Not yet, but you know,
I got some leads.
It takes time,
something will show up.
Kira, here.
Give this to William.
Go on.
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.
You're welcome.
- She's sleeping?
- Yeah.
- Do you want another beer?
- Sure.
Thanks.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
It's nice of you to help us out.
I'm gonna pay you back
as soon as I can.
You don't have to.
No, I want to.
Where's Kira's father?
He's up in Albany.
He got a job in a new water
treatment plant they opened.
We're just waiting for him
to find us a place
and then we're gonna go join him.
When do you think
you're gonna go?
I've been here
7 weeks already.
I need to go up there and work things out
one way or the other.
What about you?
Do you have any family?
No.
Not really.
I have a brother in San Diego.
But, you know,
we don't really keep in touch.
He's 15 years older than me, and he
left home when I was very young.
He sells insurance.
Have you ever married?
Yeah...
Once.
It didn't work out.
I'm sorry.
Do you wanna dance?
Now?
You should go.
I have to be up early for work.
I didn't mean to make you
feel uncomfortable.
No, you didn't.
It's just a long day.
- I'm tired. Can we leave it at that?
- Sure.
- Thanks for dinner.
- You're welcome.
Good night.
Good night.
Ron, is Eric there?
Do you know where he is?
This is his wife.
Do you know if he's at work?
Tell him I'll call back at 6.
Tonight.
Will you make sure
he gets the message?
Tell him I have to speak to him.
It's urgent.
Tell him I have to speak to him.
At 6. Tonight.
Tell him Kira misses him.
Kira!
Thanks.
MISSING NEW JERSEY GIRL
REUNITED WITH FAMILY
Her father says her street smart's got
her through.
She shouldn't talk to strangers.
She got distracted.
She's not the kind of girl
to go off like that.
She shouldn't have done that.
They got her back.
They found her.
They got their girl back.
After time, they got her back.
They got her back.
"Thank you, all the volunteers and friends
who helped looking for my little girl".
Mother said: "Thank you".
"Thank you to everybody for
helping me find my little girl".
She came back.
They got their girl back.
- Who is it?
- It's Lynn.
I woke you up.
I'll come back.
What time is it? -It's nearly 11.
I'll come back another time.
No, no, it's OK.
Come in.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
Here.
Sit down.
No, I have to go back.
I left Kira sleeping on her own.
Listen, I need to ask you a favor.
I was wondering if you could pick
Kira from school tomorrow.
And take care of her,
just from 4 to 7.
There's some things I have to do.
But I'll be back here by 7 at the latest.
Yeah, OK.
If it's a problem, I'll understand.
No, no.
It's not a problem.
I'd like to.
Thanks.
The school's on Hudson,
just off High Point Avenue.
You take the 88 bus here
in tunnel A to the 23rd street,
then you change for the 85.
Just ask the driver to let you off.
The stop's just 3 blocks from the school.
Kira knows.
At 4 o'clock?
Yeah. Is it clear?
Yeah. It's fine.
If there's an emergency
or anything else,
just leave a message
at the front desk,
and I'll just keep checking in.
Here's the key to our room.
I can't thank you enough.
We'll have fun,
we'll have a good time.
Thanks.
I should be getting back.
Do you wanna stay for a few minutes?
I can't.
I gotta go.
Good night.
Thank you.
Sorry I'm late.
How are you doing?
Are you ready?
Your mom talked to you, right?
So you know that I'm picking you up.
What?
Nothing.
OK, here we go.
Put it in here.
How was at school?
It was OK.
Your mom told me you've only been
going here a couple of weeks.
Do you like it?
It's OK.
Have you made any friends yet?
I made friends with
this girl named Alyssa.
She was nice at first.
But now she's become
a kind of mean.
So I don't really like her
any more.
What happened?
She kept saying that I was stupid,
and then she said she was only kidding.
But she kept doing this,
she's not really sorry.
Do you believe her when she
says you're stupid?
Sometimes.
Well, don't.
You're very smart, I can tell.
Don't listen to people when
they're mean or put you down.
Try to ignore 'em.
Can you do that?
Yeah, I'll try.
Good.
Those people aren't your friends.
Are you gonna be my mommy's
new boyfriend?
I don't know.
Do you want me to?
I don't know.
Do you miss your father?
I guess so.
When was the last time
you spoke to him?
I don't know,
a while ago.
Can I have an ice-cream?
When you're finished.
I finished.
Eat your food. Here.
We'll buy you an ice-cream
when you're done. Deal?
What do you say?
Deal.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.
Will you be all right by yourself?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
It'll just be a couple
of minutes. OK?
How many seconds
in a minute?
Sixty.
How many minutes
in an hour?
Sixty.
And how many minutes
is this one hour fifteen?
You have 60 minutes in an hour.
60 minutes in an hour, so...
I don't know.
60 plus 10 is what?
60 plus 10...
70?
Add 5.
75?
Good.
There you go.
Put it down.
Make sure
you do a good job.
I am.
Look at my veins.
Look here, can you see them?
They're water veins.
Look at this one.
It's a really big one.
Here. Let's put some conditioner.
Give me your hand.
Here.
There you go.
Make sure you get the back.
You got enough?
Yeah, I think so.
You got a message.
- Hey, when did she call?
- A half an hour ago.
- She didn't leave a number.
- Just what I wrote there.
What is it?
It's from your mom.
Ah, she can't come back
until tomorrow.
Why not?
She doesn't say.
She just says she needs
more time.
- Is mommy coming back?
- Of course she is.
How do you know?
Because she loves you.
And you know how you love her
and you wanna be with her?
Well, she feels the same way
about you.
Don't worry.
Here. It's time to go to sleep.
Get in the bed.
Right now?
Did you brushed your teeth?
There.
Are you comfy?
What is it?
I miss my daddy.
Why did he have to go?
I don't know.
Sometimes, things don't work out.
Things will be better soon.
Try to get some sleep.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
Come on.
Here. Close your eyes.
Try to sleep.
I'm sitting right here beside you.
Go to sleep.
Close your eyes.
Hey, come on. Close your eyes.
Roll over on your side.
Try to get some sleep.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Are you excited?
Yeah, me too.
I haven't scated
in a long time.
Are you nervous?
A little bit.
You just hang on to me, OK?
Are you having fun?
A lot.
I think you're a natural.
False!
- You've done this before, right?
- No.
I can tell
you've done this before.
You're too good.
Is this for the first time?
Want to try your own?
That's good.
You're on your own.
I'm doing it!
You're doing it!
It's true, you are.
Roll.
A little harder.
Good, good. 10!
10 is good.
Like bowling,
remember?
Roll it up.
- OK, keep playing.
- OK.
What?
What are you looking at?
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me!
Stop it.
Please.
Are you OK?
I'm not feeling well.
It's OK.
I'm sorry.
Are you gonna be OK?
I think so.
I'll be fine.
Come on, give me your arm, sweetie.
Lie down.
Sorry I couldn't get back
last night.
Where were you?
How long she'd been sleeping?
About an hour or so.
Did everything go OK?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Mommy, you're back.
Go back to sleep.
Where were you?
I went to see Kira's father.
You want some water?
I'm gonna get some.
You didn't have
to do the dishes.
I'm exhausted.
What's going on?
We're gonna move.
Eric found us a place.
When are you going?
Soon as I get my paycheck.
Sunday, Monday at the latest.
I'll pay you back as much as I can and
I'll send you the rest in a couple of weeks.
Thanks for taking
care of Kira.
So that's it?
I'd like to see you
before you leave.
Come by tomorrow, after school.
My name is William Keane.
Keane.
K-E-A-N-E.
I was born February 6, 1970,
at Yonkers General Hospital,
Yonkers, New York.
My father's name
is Henry Keane.
My mother was born Mary Conlan.
She's dead.
I have one brother,
a half-brother, Robert Keane.
I was married to Ann Etkin
on August 16th, 1996,
and divorced 2 years later,
August 17th, 1998.
We had one child.
A girl.
You've got to get out of here!
There's nothing good here.
Hey, Kira!
Come here!
What are you doing here?
I came to get you.
You're leaving, you're going up to Albany.
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.
Really? Where's Mommy?
Mommy had to go by work
and get her paycheck.
She's gonna meet us
at the station.
So let's go and try
to find a cab, huh?
I'm taking you.
Where are your things?
Over there.
I'll go get 'em.
I'll meet you over at the front entrance.
You hear me?
Keep the change.
Here, put this on.
Here, take my hand.
I want you to stay right beside me.
Do you understand?
Ticket counters...
Are you excited?
Stand right here.
We're gonna take a bus to Clifton. We got
to change, take the second one to Albany.
They don't have a bus that goes
all the way through.
One adult and a child to Clifton.
- One way or round trip?
- One way.
5.20.
Out of 20.
Did you get one for mommy?
- She already has her ticket.
- When did she get it?
Kira, let me handle this, OK? Don't worry,
your mom's gonna have her ticket.
14.80 to change.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
The bus leaves at 4:45?
Yeah.
4:45, gate 21.
Your mom and I agreed to get
our own ticket
in case she got here before us.
That way we don't have too many tickets.
I wasn't forgetting your mom.
We still have some time.
You wanna go look around?
- Yeah, you mean look at the stores?
- Sure.
- Really?
- Yeah, c'mon, c'mon.
I like that one,
can you see it?
Which one?
The one with brown eyes
and the Dalmatian.
They're both cute.
We gotta go.
We should go, come on.
We got to get going.
It's just over here,
this way.
You're a good girl,
you know that?
- I am?
- Yeah.
Wait here.
Wait, wait.
Is my mom here?
I don't see her.
Wanna get a candy bar for the ride?
Here, get two.
Two?
I'm gonna call your mom
to see if she's left.
Come back here
when you're done. OK?
Right back here,
gate 21.
I know.
I'm sorry, Sophs.
I'm so sorry.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Here, come here.
Is my mommy coming?
No, she hasn't left yet.
4:45 to Clifton.
Have your tickets out please.
Let's go and sit down.
We're gonna go back and meet
your mom at the restaurant.
- We are?
- Yeah.
Why are you crying?
Don't cry.
It's OK.
I love you.
I love you too.
