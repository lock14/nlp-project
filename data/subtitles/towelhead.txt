1
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:39,212
<i>You're beautiful
just the way you are, Jasira.</i>

2
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,490
<i>Those other girls are just jealous...</i>

3
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:44,991
...because you're growing up faster
than they are...

4
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:47,891
...and you're prettier than they are.

5
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:53,229
Listen, don't let it get you down,
those stupid names they're calling you.

6
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,327
This year...

7
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:59,808
Just give me a second.

8
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,379
This year, we'll shut them up.

9
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:07,675
Oh, and we probably
shouldn't tell your mom about this.

10
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,850
Cool?

11
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,546
Don't be nervous.

12
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:20,886
<i>Are you alive?</i>

13
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:30,865
<i>No, I've died and gone to Switzerland.</i>

14
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,910
<i>I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.</i>

15
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:36,568
<i>No need to ask.
- What is this?</i>

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,706
Huh?

17
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,775
Look at this, do you believe it?

18
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:44,186
Did I say that you could shave?

19
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,385
Oh, my God.
You did what? You shaved her?

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,688
I just helped her shave, okay?
No, Barry, it is not okay.

21
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,423
Gail, I would never do anything
to hurt her. I love her.

22
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,534
I can't believe this is happening to me.
Nothing is happening.

23
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,938
Stop crying, okay?

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,141
Shh. I know. I know, honey.

25
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,804
Listen to me, okay?

26
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:15,208
This whole thing is your fault.

27
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,286
All right? The way you walk around
with your boobs stuck out...

28
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:21,048
...it's impossible for him not to notice.

29
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,419
And you're always talking
about your pubic hair.

30
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:28,292
Once. And only because the girls at the pool
called me Chewbacca.

31
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,659
I don't know what that is.

32
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:32,767
Barry does.

33
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,728
Bottom line is, Jasira...

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,602
...there are right ways to act around men
and wrong ways...

35
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,438
...and for you to learn which is which,
you should go live with one.

36
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
This is for your own good.

37
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,486
I'm telling you,
you're gonna thank me for this later.

38
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:54,020
Shh. People are looking at us, honey.

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,453
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the Houston Intercontinental Airport.

40
00:02:57,627 --> 00:03:01,791
If you'd like to set your watch,
the local time is 4:38 p. m.

41
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:16,544
<i>Attention, Passenger Assistance.
Two wheelchairs are needed at Gate B2.</i>

42
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:22,481
<i>Repeat, two wheelchairs for two passengers
needed at Gate B2.</i>

43
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,281
Hi, Daddy.

44
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,386
Your plane
was an hour and 22 minutes late.

45
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,329
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:39,991
Why are you sorry? Did you fly it?

47
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:49,536
Let's go get your luggage.
I don't want to hit traffic.

48
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,938
Let's go.

49
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,432
What is this music?

50
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:17,232
You're half-Lebanese
and you don't know what this music is?

51
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:21,533
Your mother is an idiot.

52
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,680
You live in a house now?
Of course.

53
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,509
What, you think I cannot afford a house
for my daughter?

54
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,745
I make a very good salary at NASA.
Besides, I don't want you...

55
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,287
...going to a city school.
- Why not?

56
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:38,655
Because the schools in the suburbs
are better. Everybody knows that.

57
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,693
Watch the lawn.

58
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,295
Thank you for making dinner.

59
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:54,474
I had to learn how to cook
when I married your mother.

60
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:58,080
Yeah, she never cooks. Barry does.

61
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,796
- Good morning.
- Morning.

62
00:05:19,335 --> 00:05:21,326
Go and put some proper clothes on.

63
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:24,029
You're not in Syracuse anymore.

64
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:26,503
Go!

65
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,720
Okay, I forgive you.

66
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:46,492
<i>And smile.</i>

67
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,961
Next.

68
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:52,592
"Jasira Maroun"?

69
00:05:57,206 --> 00:05:58,969
Okay, Jasira.

70
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:01,371
It's Jasira.

71
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:03,702
Next.

72
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,845
<i>President Bush made gains in his efforts...</i>

73
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,279
<i>...to isolate
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</i>

74
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,941
Fucking Saddam.

75
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,611
<i>Mikhail Gorbachev warned Baghdad
he would back additional UN measures.</i>

76
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,084
Now what?

77
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,020
Move.

78
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:29,295
Hi, we're the Vuosos,
from two doors down.

79
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,906
- I'm Evelyn, this is my husband, Travis.
- Travis.

80
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:35,306
And this little boy is Zack.

81
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:40,814
I am Rifat Maroun,
and this is my daughter, Jasira.

82
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:47,815
Well, we're glad we finally caught y'all
at home. We tried several times.

83
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,058
I brought a pie.

84
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,228
Keep things pretty chilly in here,
don't you?

85
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,629
Well, I keep the thermostat at 68.

86
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:01,065
And everybody thinks I'm crazy,
but I don't care.

87
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:05,333
I love walking into my home
and saying, ah.

88
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,845
- What tiny coffee cups.
Madame.

89
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:16,050
Monsieur.

90
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,847
And no handles.

91
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,613
How unusual.

92
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,351
Unusual? No.
Not in my part of the world.

93
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,518
Where exactly are you from, Maroun?

94
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,096
East Beirut, Lebanon, Vuoso.

95
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:33,531
You must have some interesting opinions
on the situation over there.

96
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,864
I certainly do.

97
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,871
I'd like to hear about them sometime.

98
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:41,007
Not today.

99
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:44,112
I'm just asking...
No politics today.

100
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:48,714
Hey, Dad.
Is it okay if I go play badminton with her?

101
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:53,353
Yeah, yeah. Go on. Get out of here.

102
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,250
Hey, wanna play badminton?

103
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:10,131
What? I can't help where it lands.

104
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,511
That was stupid.

105
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,514
- We'll just go knock on their door.
- They're on their honeymoon, moron.

106
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:24,118
Then I guess the game's over.

107
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,319
Thank you so much for the pie.

108
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:30,925
<i>Next time,
I will make kenefe bejeben for you.</i>

109
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,824
Oh, Rifat, that's not necessary.
We were just being good neighbors.

110
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,693
And being a working parent myself...

111
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:41,325
...I know just how little time there is
in the day.

112
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,705
All right.

113
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,642
- Zack, we're gonna get.
- Jasira.

114
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:53,707
Who won?
- I did. She quit.

115
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:57,046
We don't say "she"
when the person's right in front of us.

116
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,780
I can't remember her name.
It's too weird.

117
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,151
Hey, her name is Jasira.

118
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,486
- Jasira.
Whatever.

119
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,753
It's a very pretty name.

120
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:10,063
For a very pretty girl.

121
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:14,729
Bye.

122
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:16,769
Goodbye, now.

123
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,906
This guy is something.
He's an Army Reservist...

124
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,844
...and he thinks I love Saddam.
It's an insult.

125
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:28,415
I'm an American citizen.

126
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,178
Did you tell him you don't love Saddam?

127
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:34,619
I told him nothing. Who is he to me?

128
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,156
By the way, I found you a job.

129
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,187
I don't need a babysitter.

130
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,195
I'm just keeping you company.

131
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:46,824
You're only three years older
than I am, towelhead.

132
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:54,304
Zack?

133
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,010
Zack, come on.

134
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:14,423
Zack?

135
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,833
Zack?

136
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:27,041
What are you doing?

137
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:16,287
And smile.

138
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:24,622
You can't look at these anymore.

139
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,665
I can do whatever I want, towelhead.

140
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,394
I'm not a towelhead!

141
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,472
Your dad is, so you are too.

142
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:34,172
Stupid, my daddy doesn't wear a towel
on his head.

143
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:37,176
He's a Christian,
just like everybody else in Texas.

144
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:50,454
Would you describe your situation
as light, medium or heavy?

145
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,560
Can't I pick them out?

146
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:55,424
You're not wearing tampons,
if that's what you're thinking.

147
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:58,226
Tampons are for married ladies.

148
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:01,226
- Do y'all need any help?
- No, thanks. We're fine.

149
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:04,505
These for you?

150
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:08,507
Well, this is the kind my daughter likes.

151
00:12:08,677 --> 00:12:12,113
- Why? What's wrong with these?
- Well, they're thicker, not as comfortable.

152
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,511
Right, but those are twice as expensive.

153
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:18,380
Well, that's probably the comfort issue
I was referring to earlier.

154
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,314
Thank you.

155
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,224
Hey, Jizz-ira.

156
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,700
You ignoring me?
Are you ignoring me, girl?

157
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:34,734
Hey, give it back!
What do we got here?

158
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,896
What do we got here? Oh, jackpot. Yeah.

159
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:41,065
- All right.
- What...? All right. What are you doing?

160
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,187
Are you okay?

161
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:24,184
Your parents don't speak Spanish
at home?

162
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:36,121
Why did you use so much toilet
paper? No wonder the toilet overflowed.

163
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,732
Finally.

164
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,985
What's this?

165
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,322
<i>What the hell is going on?
Your father called and said you ran away.</i>

166
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:10,260
He locked me out.
I came to the payphone to call you.

167
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,491
You should be calling him.
He's worried sick.

168
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:13,862
He locked me out.

169
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:17,938
<i>Jasira, you and I both know
your father overreacts.</i>

170
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,440
That means you have to adjust
your behavior. If your father tells you...

171
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,135
...you shouldn't be wearing a tampon,
you shouldn't be.

172
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:26,110
What's so wrong with wearing tampons?

173
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,273
<i>That's not really the question, is it?</i>

174
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,214
<i>The question is,
what's wrong with wearing a tampon...</i>

175
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,912
...when your father
explicitly tells you not to?

176
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:36,557
Because there is definitely
something wrong with that.

177
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,886
Like there is something wrong
with shaving...

178
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:42,656
...when your mother tells you not to
or asking someone else to, in your case.

179
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,163
I never asked. He volunteered.

180
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,070
You know what?
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

181
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,901
<i>Hang up now, and call your father.</i>

182
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,164
Hi.

183
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,522
Don't be nervous.

184
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,902
Why were you jumping around like that?

185
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,040
I just couldn't get comfortable.

186
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:14,415
What the hell?

187
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,819
Jasira, why are you looking
at these magazines?

188
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,392
Zack, give me that magazine.

189
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,867
Go wait for me in your room.

190
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:51,390
And you messed them all up too.

191
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,927
I would've expected more
from you than this, Jasira.

192
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:09,040
Don't you know you're not supposed to
look at stuff like that? You're too young.

193
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,340
Plus, it's for men.

194
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:16,184
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:18,910
Look...

196
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,052
Do you like looking at those magazines?

197
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,631
- No.
- No?

198
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:38,131
I have to go home.

199
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,467
All right.

200
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:42,572
Fine. You go home.

201
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:48,146
Are you gonna tell my daddy?

202
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,953
No, I'm not gonna tell your daddy.

203
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:54,680
Come here.

204
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,750
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

205
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,224
Come here.

206
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:27,380
You still wanna go home?

207
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:34,023
All right.

208
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,425
Go home.

209
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:47,632
Wait. You gotta pay a toll.

210
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:51,212
That's right.
You gotta pay a toll of $5.

211
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:53,745
All right, you go.

212
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,080
I'll get it later.

213
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,785
<i>Finally, a woman I actually like.</i>

214
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:02,481
Normally, I wouldn't care for a woman
to invite a man to dinner...

215
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:05,786
...but Thena's different. Thena is Greek.

216
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:10,330
Sophisticated, you know?
Not a peasant like American women.

217
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,262
- She sounds nice.
- Nice?

218
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:18,736
Jasira, we're celebrating here.
Here, have a sip of my beer.

219
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,772
Come on.

220
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,170
You like it?

221
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:28,047
I want you to do me a favor.

222
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,880
I want you to write a letter
to your grandmother in Beirut.

223
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:33,419
I don't even know her.

224
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,817
She loves you very much.

225
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,116
"Dear Grandma.

226
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,856
I miss you a lot. I live with Daddy now.

227
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,862
And we live in a very, very nice house.

228
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:47,365
Daddy's engaged to a woman from NASA.

229
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,833
And he is a... " What?

230
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:54,836
I may very well
get married to this woman.

231
00:19:55,677 --> 00:19:57,838
She likes me very much.

232
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,132
Tricky one.

233
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,346
Excellent. That was very good.

234
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,861
Your mustache tickles.

235
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,541
Oh, Jasira.

236
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,307
Bonjour.

237
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:12,344
This is Thena Panos.

238
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,746
Jasira.

239
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,115
Hi.

240
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:21,112
It's so nice to finally meet you.

241
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:40,300
- Thena, Jasira's a wonderful babysitter.
- Really?

242
00:22:40,642 --> 00:22:43,702
You should see how this kid next door
loves her.

243
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:45,904
Although his dad is an Army Reservist.

244
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:49,915
He found out I'm Lebanese,
and now he thinks I'm in love with Saddam.

245
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:52,986
Oh, God. That's so typical.

246
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,523
I only let Jasira work for him
so she can save for college. Right?

247
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:04,062
Mm-hm.
- And what do you want to do, Jasira?

248
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:08,059
You know, you could be a model.
You're so beautiful.

249
00:23:08,236 --> 00:23:09,828
Yeah, she wants to be an engineer.

250
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:13,202
Oh, no. You don't be an engineer.

251
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,535
You be a model...

252
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,506
...and then you make a lot of money...

253
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:19,044
...and then you spend your life traveling.

254
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:22,513
No, Thena. Don't put ideas in her head.

255
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:25,785
We're just having a conversation.

256
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:36,119
That way.

257
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,203
This way.

258
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,499
Rifat, we're ready.

259
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,739
That's the Reservist.

260
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:57,843
I guess he didn't have duty this weekend.

261
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,988
Rifat, doesn't Jasira look beautiful?
She really could be a model.

262
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:04,125
Yeah, she looks great.

263
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:10,090
What is he doing? Digging for oil?

264
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:21,738
You're so sweet. And you look beautiful.

265
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,537
- Bye, Jasira.
- Bye.

266
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,842
- I hope I see you again soon.
- Well, I hope so too.

267
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:38,620
Wash your face.
I don't want you wearing makeup.

268
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,102
Are you digging for oil?

269
00:24:57,145 --> 00:25:00,308
No. No.

270
00:25:01,883 --> 00:25:03,851
It's for a flagpole.

271
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,745
Your father let you wear makeup?

272
00:25:12,394 --> 00:25:13,418
How old are you?

273
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,322
Thirteen.

274
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,429
Wow.

275
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,597
Wow, you look older.

276
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:27,106
I miss looking at your magazines.

277
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:31,769
Why?

278
00:25:33,582 --> 00:25:35,812
They make me have orgasms.

279
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,251
Get out of here.

280
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:15,056
You have to do this
if you're gonna fly the flag at all times.

281
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,418
Otherwise,
you have to take it down at sunset...

282
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:21,187
...then put it back up at sunrise.
Like that idiot next door.

283
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:25,265
What is he trying to prove,
that he's more patriotic?

284
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,158
Well, he's not.

285
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:32,067
It's more patriotic to fly the flag
all the time.

286
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:43,211
- She got fat on her honeymoon.
- She's pregnant, stupid.

287
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,587
Hi.

288
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,418
I'm Jasira, and this is Zack.

289
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:55,122
- We came to get our birdies back.
- Birdies?

290
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:58,289
We knocked them into your yard
while you were gone.

291
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,035
Oh, you mean shuttlecocks.
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

292
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,768
Shuttlecocks.

293
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:07,737
I'm Melina, by the way.

294
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,250
So, what grades are y'all in?

295
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:20,320
I'm in eighth. He's in fifth.

296
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,623
What is this?

297
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,826
That's my husband Gil's old house
in Yemen.

298
00:27:26,995 --> 00:27:29,486
He dug toilets for the Peace Corps.

299
00:27:30,865 --> 00:27:32,127
Bend your legs and squat.

300
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:37,696
Even more. As far as you can,
without your butt touching the floor.

301
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,938
That's how they go to the bathroom.
They just dig a hole in the floor.

302
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,772
Can you imagine doing that
when you're pregnant?

303
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:47,171
All right, Jasira, let's...

304
00:27:47,816 --> 00:27:49,579
Let's go.

305
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:53,017
Jasira? What kind of name is that?

306
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:56,646
- It's a towelhead name.
- Don't you use that word in my house.

307
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,866
Bye.

308
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,666
<i>People next door came back
from their honeymoon.</i>

309
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:14,039
I know. That woman
needs to cover her stomach.

310
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:17,201
Her name is Melina.
Her husband used to live in Yemen.

311
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:19,438
We do not call adults by their first name.

312
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,139
- She told me to.
- I don't care what she said.

313
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:26,253
Just find out what her last name is
and call her that.

314
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,622
This is for you.

315
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:33,457
- Who's Nathalie Maroun?
- She's your grandmother.

316
00:28:36,998 --> 00:28:39,193
It's in French. I can't read it.

317
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,461
What do you mean?
Aren't they teaching you French at school?

318
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,829
I just started.

319
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,065
Jasira.

320
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,304
Ask your teacher for help.

321
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:55,211
"Dearest Jasira.
I am crying as I write you this.

322
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:58,079
I want to hold you
and squeeze your cheeks...

323
00:28:58,253 --> 00:29:02,986
...and tell you how beautiful you are,
but I have never even seen you. "

324
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,525
- Hey.
- "This is not how things should be.

325
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:10,152
Please tell your father
to bring you to Beirut very soon.

326
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,095
It is important for you to know
your Lebanese family. "

327
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,133
She's Lebanese.
"I love you very much. "

328
00:29:15,303 --> 00:29:17,294
I thought she was a Mexican.
"Grandma. "

329
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:24,004
<i>And I think we should all
say merci to Jasira...</i>

330
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,841
...for letting us translate her letter.

331
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,547
Nice letter, raghead.

332
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:37,952
Yeah, Jizz-ira.

333
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,890
How come you never told us
you were a diaperhead?

334
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,030
Sand nigger.

335
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:04,142
Hey, I'm Thomas.

336
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,083
I'm sorry I called you that name.

337
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:10,451
It's okay.

338
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:15,892
No, it's not. You should never let anybody
call you names like that.

339
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:26,032
Long time no see, towelhead.

340
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:27,697
Don't call me that.

341
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:30,504
Okay. Camel jockey.

342
00:30:30,678 --> 00:30:35,115
- Shut up.
- Okay. Sand nigger.

343
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:37,985
Ow!

344
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:40,848
You're in big trouble, towelhead.

345
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:44,355
I'm gonna tell my dad,
and he's gonna tell your dad.

346
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,756
And you're gonna get fired!

347
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:08,771
Jasira, what are you thinking? Huh?

348
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,850
Don't you know enough
not to hit a small child?

349
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:17,622
I'm sorry.

350
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,485
I want to speak to your father.

351
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,232
- Where is he?
- He's at his girlfriend's.

352
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:28,828
I want my magazine back.

353
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,534
Go on, get my magazine.

354
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,536
Go on.

355
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:45,042
Go and get my fucking magazine.

356
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,221
Please. I'll get the magazine.

357
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:15,165
Don't.

358
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,612
Ah. You're hurting me.

359
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,248
Ah!

360
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,511
You're hurting me.

361
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,967
Oh, my God.

362
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,703
Oh, my... I'm sorr...

363
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,101
I'm sorry.

364
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:51,372
I didn't mean it, I'm sorry. I swear to God,
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

365
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,041
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't go.

366
00:33:56,217 --> 00:33:57,309
- No!
- Please!

367
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:58,975
Sorry.

368
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:37,887
Thena's moussaka was delicious.
But the baklava?

369
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,720
Terrible.

370
00:34:39,894 --> 00:34:43,352
She might call you to go shopping with her.
Just say you have homework.

371
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:46,295
She needs to find friends her own age.

372
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:50,701
You know, even when you're not there,
you hog all the attention.

373
00:34:50,872 --> 00:34:53,500
I don't know how you do it, but you do.

374
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,405
Now what?

375
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:03,974
Hello, Rifat.

376
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:07,280
- May we have a moment of your time?
Certainly.

377
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:10,515
We've come to give Jasira
her last paycheck.

378
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,751
It won't be possible for her
to babysit Zack any longer.

379
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:18,524
- Yeah, she hit me really hard in the arm.
Is that true? Did you really hit him?

380
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:21,291
Why would you do such a thing?

381
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:25,735
I don't think there are any circumstances
under which hitting would be appropriate.

382
00:35:25,907 --> 00:35:28,899
He called me a towelhead.

383
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:36,413
Well, did you know that your son
called my daughter a towelhead?

384
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,484
And a camel jockey and a sand nigger!

385
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,052
Jesus Christ!

386
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:45,056
Look, if Zack used inappropriate language,
I'm sorry. But violence...

387
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,284
Where is the check?

388
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:50,326
Where is the check?

389
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:56,803
You can show yourself out.

390
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:59,166
Well, all right, then!

391
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,543
Zack, I really wish
you would've told me the whole story...

392
00:36:22,663 --> 00:36:25,257
Her redneck of a husband
will soon get called up...

393
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:29,301
...and then Saddam will gas him,
and that will serve all of them right.

394
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,805
<i>So, what's Lebanon like?</i>

395
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,503
She's never been. She has a grandmother
she's never even met.

396
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,274
Oh, no, that would never fly in my family.

397
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:45,212
This wine is delicious.

398
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:46,785
Daddy picked it out.

399
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:51,323
Seriously? He didn't even
want you to come. I had to talk him into it.

400
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:13,008
- Your mother and I are gonna go upstairs.
Good night, Jasira.

401
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,579
Good night.

402
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,150
The wine you brought them
made them horny.

403
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,394
What happened? Did I hurt you?

404
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:47,271
No. I had an orgasm.

405
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,808
Wow, was that your first time?

406
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:55,946
No.

407
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:59,475
I've had them before, with myself.

408
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,746
But I don't want to anymore.

409
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,152
Why not?

410
00:39:06,027 --> 00:39:08,120
I wish I could have one right now.

411
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:12,756
You can if you want.

412
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:21,271
- Will you watch?
- I don't know.

413
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:59,072
Hello, Bradley residence.

414
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,113
<i>This is Rifat Maroun.
I would like to speak to my daughter.</i>

415
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:05,047
Oh, yes, sir, Mr. Maroun.
She's right here.

416
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,785
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, I'm coming to pick you up.</i>

417
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:11,618
<i>- Wait for me outside.
- But it's not even 9:00 yet.</i>

418
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:16,286
<i>I'm tired of waiting up. I want to go to bed.
Some of us work, you know?</i>

419
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:17,488
Okay.

420
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,001
Does your mom have any tampons?

421
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:27,404
Sure.

422
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,770
Could you bring them to school for me
on Monday?

423
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,071
I'll go get them.
You could take them home.

424
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:35,374
No. Daddy won't let me wear them.

425
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:50,628
Does your mom have any razors?
Because I need those too.

426
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,238
Night, Mr. Maroun.

427
00:41:17,658 --> 00:41:20,183
You're not to see that boy again.

428
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:24,964
You did not give me the full information
so I could make a proper decision.

429
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:27,731
Do you understand what I'm referring to?

430
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,704
- I think so.
- Good.

431
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:39,777
Because if you continue to visit
that boy's house, no one will respect you.

432
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:04,432
Thank you.

433
00:42:07,508 --> 00:42:09,169
How far up are you going to shave?

434
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,043
I don't know.

435
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,906
I think you should shave everything.

436
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:23,248
I could do it for you.
I'd be very careful, I promise.

437
00:42:29,563 --> 00:42:32,225
Here's my dad's shaving cream.

438
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,433
Should I put on my bathing suit?

439
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:41,200
How am I supposed to shave you
if you're wearing a bathing suit?

440
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:51,010
Come here.

441
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:00,085
You look nice.

442
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,451
Thanks.

443
00:44:05,993 --> 00:44:08,257
Do you wanna stand or sit?

444
00:44:08,962 --> 00:44:10,589
Usually I stand.

445
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:13,890
Okay.

446
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:25,574
So let me know when it grows back.
I can shave it for you again.

447
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:28,076
Okay.

448
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:56,000
I can't believe your idiot of a mother
is gonna be here for Christmas...

449
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:59,145
...but I want the place to look good
when she gets here.

450
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:02,407
If she thinks she's the only one
who could plant a decent garden...

451
00:45:02,583 --> 00:45:05,108
...she's about to experience
a rude awakening.

452
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:06,676
Hand me another one.

453
00:45:07,855 --> 00:45:09,345
Howdy.

454
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,956
Zack and I were wondering
if we could talk to you and Jasira...

455
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,652
...for a moment.

456
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:17,792
Well, aren't you talking to us now?

457
00:45:18,766 --> 00:45:21,326
- We came here to apologize.
Really?

458
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,464
Right, Zack?

459
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:28,538
I'm sorry I called you a towelhead.

460
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:31,371
Will you be my babysitter again?

461
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,049
I wanna apologize, too,
for things that I said that I shouldn't have.

462
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:41,210
- Maybe Zack overheard me...
- Maybe Zack overheard you?

463
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,818
Did anyone ever tell you
how to accept an apology, Maroun?

464
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,119
Because you ain't very good at it.

465
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:51,419
And why should I be good at it, Vuoso?
Why?

466
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,225
I don't want to be Zack's babysitter.

467
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,604
I have things to do after school.

468
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:07,107
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

469
00:46:07,281 --> 00:46:08,771
Good day.

470
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,945
I'm so proud of you, Jasira.

471
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:19,853
Ha!

472
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,061
Hey. Well, no... Hold on, Jasira.

473
00:46:31,572 --> 00:46:34,040
I'm not gonna come in.
I'm just gonna stay right here.

474
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:36,241
Hi.

475
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:41,312
Zack and his mom went to his grandma's.

476
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:44,144
Her cat just had kittens.

477
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:46,786
I guess they're pretty cute.

478
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:51,550
Your dad staying at his girlfriend's?

479
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:55,392
Yeah? I figured.

480
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,965
Well, I was thinking maybe you and I
could go do something together.

481
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:02,465
What would we do?

482
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:05,070
I don't know. We could...

483
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,797
We could go get Mexican food.

484
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,572
Margarita for you, senor.

485
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,386
And a virgin margarita for your daughter.

486
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:24,353
Thank you.

487
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,718
I'm not your daughter.

488
00:47:29,062 --> 00:47:30,359
I'm your girlfriend.

489
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,129
You're too young to be my girlfriend.

490
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:37,793
No, I'm not.

491
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:41,839
You did that thing to me.
I'm your girlfriend.

492
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:49,081
Um...

493
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:51,979
Jesus. Jasira, that thing...

494
00:47:58,025 --> 00:48:01,461
God, this whole setup's
gonna have me pissing all night.

495
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,938
Just in time.

496
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:55,111
How come it took so long to get here?
It's so far away from where we live.

497
00:48:55,983 --> 00:48:58,543
Well, I just didn't want to run into
anybody we knew.

498
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:06,290
Jasira.

499
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:10,662
I'm drunk.

500
00:49:11,765 --> 00:49:13,892
How would you know?

501
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:18,263
Because I feel so happy.

502
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,673
You think being drunk makes you happy?

503
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:29,043
I guess it does sometimes.

504
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,019
Why do you like me?

505
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,287
I know.

506
00:49:41,662 --> 00:49:43,027
My boobs.

507
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,705
Maybe.

508
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,246
It's more than that.

509
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:10,986
When I grow up,
I wanna be in your magazines.

510
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:13,058
No, you don't.

511
00:50:13,627 --> 00:50:15,094
Are you a slut?

512
00:50:15,896 --> 00:50:17,193
Huh?

513
00:50:17,364 --> 00:50:20,424
- I don't think so.
- No, you're not a slut.

514
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:24,966
You're not gonna be
in those magazines.

515
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:28,365
I'll tell you something, though.

516
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:31,010
Keep hanging around that black kid,
you'll be a slut.

517
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:34,071
I saw him leaving your house.

518
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,842
He's better than you.

519
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,440
Oh, yeah?

520
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,553
He only touches me when I say he can.

521
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:05,510
Thank you.

522
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:09,640
I'm not a bad man.

523
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:12,646
I'm really not.

524
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:19,221
I never would've
done that thing to you if I'd...

525
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,592
If I'd known you were still a virgin.

526
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:43,082
The only reason I married Evelyn
is because she got pregnant.

527
00:51:45,085 --> 00:51:46,746
I mean, she's...

528
00:51:47,988 --> 00:51:51,151
She's not the kind of person
that I thought I would...

529
00:52:03,003 --> 00:52:04,834
You know, sometimes...

530
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:08,771
...I actually hope that I will get called up.

531
00:52:15,148 --> 00:52:16,706
Will you write me letters?

532
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:23,221
I'd like that.

533
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,183
Good night.

534
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,958
- Good night.
- Good night.

535
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:08,794
Jasira?

536
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,698
Gil said he saw you
in Mr. Vuoso's car last night.

537
00:53:12,873 --> 00:53:14,272
I wasn't in his car.

538
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,308
Any man who wants to be friends
with a girl your age is a pig.

539
00:53:17,477 --> 00:53:20,002
I wasn't in his car!

540
00:53:22,382 --> 00:53:25,943
If he asks you to be his friend,
I want you to tell me, okay?

541
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,445
- I mean it, Jasira.
- You're not my mother.

542
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:42,228
Jasira?

543
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:43,733
Mommy!

544
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:47,670
- Hi, baby. Hi!
- I missed you!

545
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:49,672
I missed you so much.

546
00:53:49,843 --> 00:53:53,210
Gail, you really are ridiculous.

547
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:57,473
Shut up, Rifat. Hi.

548
00:53:59,753 --> 00:54:01,687
Hi, sweetie.

549
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:06,053
Well, just so you know, we've decided
not to exchange gifts this year. Right?

550
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:10,356
We are protesting the fact Bush is
waiting until after the holiday to wage war.

551
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,555
Whatever you want. Whatever you want.

552
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:15,200
So glad to see you.

553
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,415
Wow, very nice.

554
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:36,813
Thank you.

555
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:47,532
Hey, what's with the flag?

556
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:51,465
Oh. I'm supporting the war.

557
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,101
I thought you were protesting it.

558
00:54:56,977 --> 00:55:01,004
I'm protesting one aspect of the war
and supporting another aspect.

559
00:55:01,181 --> 00:55:04,309
See, the mark of intelligence, Gail,
is having the capacity...

560
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:07,749
...of holding two conflicting ideas
in your head at one time.

561
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:11,348
Is that right? Okay.

562
00:55:11,524 --> 00:55:13,424
Honey, show me your room.

563
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,417
Hon?

564
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:18,253
How about I go drop your dad off
tomorrow...

565
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:20,023
...and we go get a Christmas tree?

566
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,565
Would you like that?

567
00:55:22,802 --> 00:55:25,600
Yeah? I can't wait to give you your
Christmas presents.

568
00:55:25,772 --> 00:55:27,296
You're gonna love them.

569
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:29,669
I spent a fortune on them.

570
00:55:32,545 --> 00:55:36,106
I hope you didn't get me anything.
I don't want anything, you know.

571
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,880
You're so pretty.

572
00:55:46,826 --> 00:55:48,521
You are.

573
00:55:48,695 --> 00:55:50,663
So pretty.

574
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:55,930
Barry and I broke up.

575
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,930
He moved out.

576
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,570
That's too bad.

577
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,176
No, it's not.

578
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,139
He was an asshole.

579
00:56:12,052 --> 00:56:14,350
I, um...

580
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:22,824
I feel terrible about last summer
when I took his side over yours.

581
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:34,433
Do you like living here? With your father?

582
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,732
I guess.

583
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,174
I should finish out the school year here.

584
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,839
I like the school.

585
00:56:43,716 --> 00:56:46,412
But I thought you said you didn't like it.

586
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,478
I thought you didn't like your daddy.

587
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,727
I don't have anyone.

588
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:10,008
I'm so lonely, Jasira.

589
00:57:14,948 --> 00:57:16,779
I'll come back next summer.

590
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,555
I guess I misunderstood. Good night.

591
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:27,117
- Mom?
- What?

592
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,123
Can I kiss you?

593
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,260
Sure.

594
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:47,143
- It's pretty. Thank you, Mom.
- You're welcome, baby. You like it?

595
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,608
Well, I guess that's it.

596
00:57:51,784 --> 00:57:53,649
Well, I guess so.

597
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:05,931
I thought you were kidding
about not buying me any presents.

598
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:08,795
Why would I be kidding you, Gail?

599
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:13,606
You could've at least
made me something in art class.

600
00:58:13,773 --> 00:58:15,365
Just great.

601
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,048
Your mother can be very hard
to live with, you know?

602
00:58:25,385 --> 00:58:28,411
Cheap, cheap. You cheap bastard!

603
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,955
I put you through graduate school
so you could make this kind of money...

604
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,423
...and you can't even buy me
a bottle of perfume?

605
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,188
You've made copies of my paychecks?
How'd you get these?

606
00:58:37,363 --> 00:58:39,797
- My salary's not your business.
- Of course it is!

607
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:43,800
- We have a child and she costs money.
- Did you give her the key to my desk?

608
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:46,530
- I don't know where it is.
- I don't believe you, Jasira.

609
00:58:46,706 --> 00:58:48,799
I used a nail file, so lay off her.

610
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:51,603
Know what? It's not the first time
she's broken my rules.

611
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:55,214
She keeps taking phone calls from that
black boy and thinks I don't know!

612
00:58:55,381 --> 00:58:58,441
- You're not supposed to see him anymore.
- She does what she wants!

613
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,483
She can live with me. How about that?

614
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:01,950
Fine.

615
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,782
I have to finish the school year.

616
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,120
What is this "school year" bullshit?
You hate your father!

617
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,854
- That's what you told me on the phone.
I didn't!

618
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:12,861
- I don't hate you.
Oh, my God.

619
00:59:15,868 --> 00:59:18,302
- I'm going to Thena's.
- Fine. Go.

620
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,904
Yeah, I am going.

621
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:27,410
You ruined our Christmas.
- And you have invaded our privacy!

622
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,209
- You got your girlfriend a present.
- Yes, I did.

623
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:36,820
I can't believe I spent six years
married to you, you fucking asshole!

624
00:59:37,924 --> 00:59:42,020
And I can't believe
you want to spend another minute with him.

625
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:45,993
You're all idiots.

626
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:47,257
Idiots.

627
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,663
<i>I just don't feel
like going anywhere today.</i>

628
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,672
Well, then I'll just come visit you.

629
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:59,275
You can't come over. You're black.

630
00:59:59,445 --> 01:00:01,174
<i>Ha-ha.</i>

631
01:00:04,117 --> 01:00:06,085
I really hope you're kidding.

632
01:00:06,252 --> 01:00:07,549
<i>I'm serious.</i>

633
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,553
My parents don't want me
being friends with a black boy.

634
01:00:10,723 --> 01:00:13,248
Why would you listen
if they said something like that?

635
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:16,793
Because they're my parents.

636
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,361
<i>Come on in.</i>

637
01:00:27,507 --> 01:00:29,839
- Hey.
Hey.

638
01:00:31,277 --> 01:00:34,906
Excuse the mess. I promised Gil
I'd take that tree down today...

639
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:37,777
...but I just got too tired.

640
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:39,781
I can't stay long.

641
01:00:39,952 --> 01:00:41,317
I like your tree.

642
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:46,018
Oh, hey. I got you something for Christmas.
That there, that's for you.

643
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,820
I meant to bring it over earlier...

644
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:53,295
...but Gil's parents were here,
and my mother and stepfather.

645
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:54,933
It was exhausting.

646
01:00:58,671 --> 01:01:01,071
I'll have to hide it from Daddy.

647
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,978
Well, just keep it here.
You can come read it anytime you want.

648
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:11,116
<i>The first assault began
at 2 a. m., Baghdad time.</i>

649
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:14,776
<i>- Finally. Saddam will get killed before long.
- Laser-guided smart bombs.</i>

650
01:01:14,954 --> 01:01:17,855
<i>In Washington, at the request
of Defense Secretary Cheney...</i>

651
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:20,049
<i>...President Bush authorized the call-up...</i>

652
01:01:20,226 --> 01:01:22,421
<i>...of as many as
1 million National Guardsmen...</i>

653
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,620
<i>...and other Reservists
for up to two years.</i>

654
01:01:24,797 --> 01:01:28,096
<i>But the president denied
that a ground war was imminent.</i>

655
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,100
I'm interested in war reporting.

656
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:38,699
What kind of war reporting?

657
01:01:40,844 --> 01:01:43,005
Well, I guess I'm interested
in Reservists...

658
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:45,613
...and what it's like to get called up.

659
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:49,782
My next door neighbor is one.
Maybe I could interview him.

660
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:52,749
That's a good angle.

661
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:59,558
Want to come to my house this weekend
to work on our articles?

662
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:03,256
I can't. That's when I want to try
and interview the man next door.

663
01:02:03,433 --> 01:02:06,766
Then I'll come to your house.
After the interview.

664
01:02:06,937 --> 01:02:08,962
We could have a sleepover. Wanna?

665
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:11,403
I'd have to ask Daddy.

666
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:15,973
Want to know why I joined the paper?
You can't tell anyone.

667
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:18,940
I'm in love with Mr. Joffrey.

668
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:21,481
I wanna have sex with him.

669
01:02:25,889 --> 01:02:27,481
Daddy?

670
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:30,555
Can I have a friend sleep over?

671
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:32,887
She's a girl.

672
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:35,021
A white girl.

673
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:43,197
It doesn't matter what color she is
if she's a girl.

674
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:49,401
Don't make me out to be a racist,
when I have your best interest at heart.

675
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:53,208
What's this?

676
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:57,918
Questions for Mr. Vuoso.

677
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:02,452
I'm going to interview him
for the school paper about the war.

678
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:06,189
Here you are, living with somebody
from the Middle East...

679
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:10,823
...and all you care about is interviewing
that scumbag next door.

680
01:03:11,001 --> 01:03:12,832
Who are you?

681
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,991
- Hey.
- Hi.

682
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:51,470
Is it okay if I interview you
for our school paper about the war?

683
01:03:54,477 --> 01:03:56,468
Since you're a Reservist.

684
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:05,344
Are you scared to go to war?

685
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:11,085
No. No. Well, I'm not in a fighting unit.
I do humanitarian stuff like...

686
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:14,662
I do humanitarian stuff,
like passing out food.

687
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:21,260
But Daddy says
Saddam's gonna gas all the troops.

688
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:25,902
Well, I would expect that
from someone who loves Saddam.

689
01:04:26,543 --> 01:04:28,534
That's racist.

690
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:34,347
You're making an assumption about him
just because of where he's from.

691
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:37,812
Daddy probably wants Saddam
dead more than you.

692
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:39,318
Is that so?

693
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:41,320
Is that so?

694
01:04:41,825 --> 01:04:43,622
Next question.

695
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:53,498
Why did you pack rubbers in your duffle bag
if you're married?

696
01:05:03,613 --> 01:05:06,741
Now, who said
you could go through my personal things?

697
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:13,321
Why did you pack them?

698
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,725
Why do you think I packed them?

699
01:05:36,713 --> 01:05:39,614
Goddamn it.
- What is going on over here?

700
01:05:40,216 --> 01:05:41,774
- Nothing.
I'm interviewing him...

701
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:43,543
...for the school paper.

702
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,450
- The interview's over. You're going home.
- Wait a second...

703
01:05:46,623 --> 01:05:48,386
You want me to call somebody?

704
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:53,453
All right.

705
01:05:56,332 --> 01:05:57,890
Hold on.

706
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:02,134
I'll be right back.

707
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:04,467
Did you tell her anything?

708
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:07,433
No, I swear.

709
01:06:08,912 --> 01:06:11,540
So, what's her fucking problem?

710
01:06:12,515 --> 01:06:15,143
Damn it. I hardly get to spend
any time alone with you...

711
01:06:15,318 --> 01:06:17,445
...and I get this one chance...

712
01:06:17,954 --> 01:06:19,819
...that bitch ruins it.

713
01:06:25,161 --> 01:06:27,356
Hey, I'll walk you home.

714
01:06:28,264 --> 01:06:32,394
I want to give you something.
It's a key to our house.

715
01:06:32,835 --> 01:06:36,896
If you ever need to come over at any time,
for any reason, just let yourself in, and...

716
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:38,802
Jasira.

717
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:41,306
You don't even have to tell me why.

718
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:43,502
Okay? Just come on over.

719
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,013
You can watch TV or read your book.

720
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:49,083
Why are you doing this?

721
01:06:49,252 --> 01:06:52,016
If anything ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.

722
01:06:53,456 --> 01:06:55,321
Nothing will happen to me.

723
01:07:13,643 --> 01:07:16,043
Give me the tape.
I wanna know what he told you.

724
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:17,770
It's private.

725
01:07:18,214 --> 01:07:21,308
Nothing you have is private.
Give me the tape.

726
01:07:22,986 --> 01:07:24,010
Now what?

727
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:32,350
Hi.
Hello.

728
01:07:32,528 --> 01:07:35,326
Is Jasira here?
- Yes, she is.

729
01:07:35,498 --> 01:07:36,988
Come on in.

730
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:38,858
Hi.

731
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:41,494
Hi.

732
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:45,573
I'm early. My mom had some errands
to run, so she just dropped me off.

733
01:07:45,742 --> 01:07:47,073
Daddy, this is Denise.

734
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:50,076
- Hi.
- Hello, Denise. How are you?

735
01:07:50,246 --> 01:07:51,338
- Good.
- Good.

736
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:55,610
May I offer you something?
A snack or a cold soda?

737
01:07:57,287 --> 01:07:58,948
Your dad seems nice.

738
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:00,646
He's not that nice.

739
01:08:00,823 --> 01:08:02,723
He's a racist.

740
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:07,393
He won't let me see Thomas anymore
because he's afraid it'll ruin my reputation.

741
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:11,565
And now Thomas is mad at me
just for following my dad's rules.

742
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:14,202
I'd be mad at you too.

743
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:19,205
If you do what a racist tells you to,
that makes you a racist.

744
01:08:21,177 --> 01:08:23,873
Bye!
- Goodbye, now.

745
01:08:26,049 --> 01:08:27,277
Go get the tape.

746
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:29,645
<i>I do humanitarian stuff like...</i>

747
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,782
<i>I do humanitarian stuff,
like passing out food.</i>

748
01:08:33,956 --> 01:08:37,915
<i>But Daddy says
Saddam is gonna gas all the troops.</i>

749
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:42,023
<i>Well, I would expect that
from someone who loves Saddam.</i>

750
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:44,291
<i>- Idiot.
That's racist.</i>

751
01:08:46,369 --> 01:08:49,600
<i>You're making an assumption about him
just because of where he's from.</i>

752
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:52,002
<i>Daddy probably wants Saddam dead
more than you.</i>

753
01:08:52,175 --> 01:08:53,904
<i>Is that so?</i>

754
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:56,071
<i>Next question.</i>

755
01:08:59,282 --> 01:09:03,048
<i>Why did you pack rubbers
in your duffle bag if you're married?</i>

756
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:07,612
What happened?

757
01:09:08,257 --> 01:09:12,023
Mr. Vuoso got mad
that I asked him that question.

758
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:13,787
He hit stop.

759
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:16,090
And then what happened?

760
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:20,726
- He asked how I knew about his condoms.
- And how did you?

761
01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:23,463
I found them in his duffle bag.

762
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:26,802
What kind of person
goes through another man's things?

763
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,500
Do you go through my things too?

764
01:09:29,045 --> 01:09:31,946
- No.
- Oh, my God, Jasira!

765
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:35,551
Condoms? You're just a child!

766
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:37,948
You have a foul mouth and a foul mind!

767
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:40,282
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!

768
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:43,857
You do! You do! You do!

769
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:19,157
I did an interview with the guy next door
for the school paper.

770
01:10:22,732 --> 01:10:26,224
- I had to make most of it up because...
- So you interviewed a redneck.

771
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:29,200
So what? I'm not impressed.

772
01:10:31,374 --> 01:10:34,502
- What would impress you?
- Nothing.

773
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:36,003
It's too late.

774
01:10:37,914 --> 01:10:39,711
Wait, I know.

775
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:42,574
Have sex with me.

776
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,812
Okay.

777
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:50,883
But not at my house.

778
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,585
We could do it at my house.
My parents work late.

779
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:55,697
Can we do it today?

780
01:10:56,265 --> 01:10:58,130
Do you have a condom?

781
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:03,265
Then we'll have to wait until tomorrow.

782
01:11:03,606 --> 01:11:06,097
I have one at home I could bring.

783
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:19,078
Lt'll only hurt for a few seconds.

784
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:21,746
Just tell me when you want me to stop
and I will.

785
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:23,892
Okay?

786
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:30,928
Oh.

787
01:11:32,602 --> 01:11:34,092
Oh, my God.

788
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:37,501
- What?
- Oh, no, it just feels so good.

789
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:45,777
I'm sorry if it hurts.
The first time is always painful for girls.

790
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:47,540
I know.

791
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:06,029
The cab will be here in 15 minutes.

792
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:08,500
Who'd you do it with before me?

793
01:12:09,005 --> 01:12:10,495
No one.

794
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:13,498
But nothing popped.

795
01:12:13,676 --> 01:12:14,973
It was supposed to.

796
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,009
I don't know, Thomas.

797
01:12:20,016 --> 01:12:23,076
I'm not gonna be mad if you tell me
you had sex with somebody else.

798
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:25,243
I'm just curious.

799
01:12:25,955 --> 01:12:28,150
Was it back in Syracuse?

800
01:12:29,158 --> 01:12:31,023
It was nowhere.

801
01:12:33,863 --> 01:12:35,854
Do you feel like a woman?

802
01:12:37,433 --> 01:12:39,367
Uh-huh.

803
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:43,805
I feel like a man.

804
01:12:53,416 --> 01:12:55,043
What you reading about?

805
01:12:55,217 --> 01:12:57,481
About kissing.

806
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:10,996
- What do you want?
- Is your daddy home?

807
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,728
No. And if he was,
he wouldn't want to talk with you.

808
01:13:16,038 --> 01:13:17,903
Now look what you did!

809
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:20,872
Snowball! Come here, Snowball.
Come on.

810
01:13:29,619 --> 01:13:31,883
God-fucking-damn it.

811
01:13:35,257 --> 01:13:38,249
First, your idiot of a president
declares a ceasefire...

812
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:42,022
...even though Saddam isn't dead yet,
or even captured.

813
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:46,591
And then, I ran over a cat,
about a block away.

814
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:49,203
Was it little and white?

815
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,869
Yes.

816
01:14:05,054 --> 01:14:07,079
Put it in here.

817
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:10,120
Don't you want me to take her back
to the Vuosos'?

818
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:14,729
Are you kidding?
So that asshole can call me a murderer?

819
01:14:16,065 --> 01:14:18,863
We'll stick it in the freezer...

820
01:14:19,035 --> 01:14:22,732
...and then we'll take it out on Wednesday
with the trash.

821
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:28,369
Then they'll never know
what happened to her.

822
01:14:28,544 --> 01:14:31,513
Well, you should have thought of that
before you got her killed.

823
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:36,342
Wow.

824
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:40,681
Your mother's dating Colin Powell now.

825
01:14:41,357 --> 01:14:42,915
Good.

826
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:45,522
I hope he marries her.

827
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:47,591
What a hypocrite.

828
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:50,755
How are you
supposed to learn anything anyhow?

829
01:14:54,370 --> 01:14:56,702
I have to go to Thena's.

830
01:15:07,283 --> 01:15:10,184
Are you gonna come?
The girl has to come first.

831
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:14,413
I'm not sure I even know how to.
I'm not by myself.

832
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:20,353
Can you come like this?

833
01:15:55,731 --> 01:15:57,858
I'm gonna go look for Snowball.

834
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:14,306
Hi.

835
01:16:16,252 --> 01:16:17,810
Can I come in?

836
01:16:18,754 --> 01:16:20,722
Can't we just talk like this?

837
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,424
Sure.

838
01:16:27,463 --> 01:16:29,158
I got called up.

839
01:16:32,368 --> 01:16:35,735
- But the war is over.
- Well, the fighting part is over...

840
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:38,874
...but they still need plenty of help.

841
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:41,667
Could you get killed?

842
01:16:41,844 --> 01:16:44,244
No, I don't think so.

843
01:16:44,413 --> 01:16:47,211
Course, it's still dangerous, but...

844
01:16:52,288 --> 01:16:54,051
I leave tomorrow...

845
01:16:54,223 --> 01:16:56,521
...4 a. m.

846
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,734
I just come to say goodbye.

847
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:15,576
It was nice knowing you.

848
01:17:25,588 --> 01:17:27,886
Take care of yourself, all right?

849
01:17:32,428 --> 01:17:33,986
Wait.

850
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:37,565
You can come in.

851
01:18:03,993 --> 01:18:06,359
Can't you come closer than that?

852
01:18:11,066 --> 01:18:13,000
Come on over here.

853
01:18:40,396 --> 01:18:43,229
You know, you act like you're so young.

854
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:46,765
You don't know what you're doing.

855
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:51,664
You know what you're doing.

856
01:18:53,676 --> 01:18:56,201
You know what you do to men.

857
01:19:24,073 --> 01:19:26,633
You are so beautiful.

858
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:34,007
You are so beautiful.

859
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:44,150
Would you stand up?

860
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:47,591
- Why?
- I want you to strip for me.

861
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:51,464
- Why?
- Because it's sexy.

862
01:20:04,446 --> 01:20:06,641
Go on.

863
01:21:06,608 --> 01:21:08,701
Just stand there.

864
01:21:13,248 --> 01:21:16,342
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

865
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:29,587
Get on the floor.

866
01:21:51,854 --> 01:21:54,254
I'll think about you in Iraq.

867
01:22:18,614 --> 01:22:19,706
Morning, kids.

868
01:22:19,882 --> 01:22:21,315
Hi, morning.
Hi, Mr. Vuoso.

869
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:23,246
Hey, Mr. Vuoso.

870
01:22:42,037 --> 01:22:44,767
Hi, I'm Gil, Gil Hines.

871
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:47,101
Melina's husband. Hi.

872
01:22:48,143 --> 01:22:50,703
Hello. Rifat Maroun.

873
01:22:50,879 --> 01:22:53,404
Listen, would you guys
like to come over for dinner?

874
01:22:53,582 --> 01:22:55,482
We could celebrate the end of the war.

875
01:22:55,651 --> 01:22:57,642
Celebrate? What's to celebrate?

876
01:22:59,821 --> 01:23:03,154
Well, we don't have to celebrate.
We can just eat.

877
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:05,987
We're thinking Monday night,
around 7:30.

878
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:08,823
- Do we have to?
- Jasira.

879
01:23:11,867 --> 01:23:13,198
Sure.

880
01:23:13,368 --> 01:23:15,165
- We'd be happy to come.
Great.

881
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,307
Oh, my God.

882
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:24,468
We can make our own glamour photos.
Come on, we have to.

883
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:31,085
Well, I got to say, you girls look great.

884
01:23:31,954 --> 01:23:33,854
How about we start out
with a nice smile?

885
01:23:34,022 --> 01:23:35,785
Come on, smile.

886
01:23:36,692 --> 01:23:38,626
Nice. Very good.

887
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:40,523
You wanna give me a nice little kiss?

888
01:23:40,696 --> 01:23:45,599
Come on. Pucker up. Pucker up.
Be having fun, come on.

889
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:49,134
There you go. That didn't hurt, did it?
Another one just like that.

890
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:51,829
Smile. You're so beautiful.

891
01:23:52,007 --> 01:23:55,408
<i>- Good. There you go.
Don't be nervous. You look nice.</i>

892
01:23:55,577 --> 01:23:58,512
<i>You know, you could be a model.
You're prettier than they are.</i>

893
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,672
There you go, darling. Can we get
one more of those? Like that.

894
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,478
Pucker up real good. Oh, that's sweet.

895
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,412
<i>- You're very, very sexy.
You're so sexy.</i>

896
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:11,753
Let me see as much of your throat
as possible. Little bit more.

897
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:15,920
Come on, stick out your chest. Good.
That is sweet, honey.

898
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:17,429
<i>Very pretty name.</i>

899
01:24:17,599 --> 01:24:19,931
<i>- Very nice.
For a very pretty girl.</i>

900
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:22,696
I want you to look like
you just woke up. Sleepy. Good.

901
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:26,307
I'll tell you something, little girl.
You are very, very good at this.

902
01:24:26,475 --> 01:24:29,342
<i>That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.</i>

903
01:24:30,012 --> 01:24:33,243
Why don't you let that strap come down?
Let me see your shoulder.

904
01:24:33,415 --> 01:24:34,643
<i>You have a foul mouth...</i>

905
01:24:34,816 --> 01:24:36,113
<i>...and a foul mind.
- Like that.</i>

906
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:38,515
<i>You know what you do to men.
Are you a slut?</i>

907
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:43,623
Strap down, let me see your shoulder.
- No, I'm only 13.

908
01:24:50,165 --> 01:24:52,929
I used to think
that purple was my favorite color...

909
01:24:53,101 --> 01:24:55,069
...but now I don't think I like it as much.

910
01:24:57,372 --> 01:25:01,001
- How was the mall?
- Great, Mr. Maroun.

911
01:25:06,982 --> 01:25:08,381
Bye.

912
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:10,876
Get in the car.

913
01:25:12,954 --> 01:25:14,751
Now.

914
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:21,796
Buckle up.

915
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:26,726
Where'd you get that filthy magazine?

916
01:25:30,505 --> 01:25:32,439
Answer me!

917
01:25:39,314 --> 01:25:42,147
You don't live in the moral universe!

918
01:25:42,317 --> 01:25:44,911
The things you do are not normal!

919
01:25:45,487 --> 01:25:48,354
You look at pictures of whores,
and you like them so much...

920
01:25:48,523 --> 01:25:50,514
...that you keep the magazine!

921
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:53,786
You don't obey me
and you don't obey your mother!

922
01:25:55,197 --> 01:25:58,189
One day,
you're gonna run out of places to live.

923
01:26:16,685 --> 01:26:18,209
Hurry.

924
01:26:34,136 --> 01:26:37,867
Jasira! Where are you going? Come here!

925
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:44,606
Hey, Mel.

926
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,543
Oh. Hey. Come on in.

927
01:26:47,983 --> 01:26:50,474
Open the door. Jasira!

928
01:26:50,652 --> 01:26:54,053
Jasira. Open the door, now.

929
01:26:54,723 --> 01:26:56,554
Why don't you go wait in the study?

930
01:26:56,725 --> 01:27:00,456
- Down the hall, second door on the right.
Open the fucking door!

931
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:26,285
Jasira? I just wanted to let you know
your father went home, okay?

932
01:27:34,262 --> 01:27:35,559
When do I have to go home?

933
01:27:38,099 --> 01:27:39,191
You wanna go home?

934
01:27:41,002 --> 01:27:44,563
- So don't worry about it.
- Don't tell her not to worry. She's worried.

935
01:27:44,739 --> 01:27:47,731
Nobody's gonna make her do anything
she doesn't want to do.

936
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:56,375
Go hide.

937
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:20,630
- Hello. I'm here to take Jasira home.
- Jasira doesn't want to go home with you.

938
01:28:20,809 --> 01:28:25,041
This is kidnapping!
And I will call the police.

939
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:35,856
I don't see the harm
in her staying with us for a couple of days.

940
01:28:36,992 --> 01:28:39,222
She'll be home when she's ready.

941
01:28:51,172 --> 01:28:53,663
He'll probably be back.

942
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:09,647
Sorry. This is all that I have.

943
01:29:09,824 --> 01:29:11,917
I've got something you can wear.

944
01:29:12,093 --> 01:29:16,826
We'll go over and get some of your stuff
tomorrow. I'll pick you up right after school.

945
01:29:17,365 --> 01:29:20,061
We'll go before your father
comes home from work.

946
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:26,233
What happened to your leg?

947
01:29:27,275 --> 01:29:30,301
Daddy was mad about the magazine.

948
01:29:33,315 --> 01:29:35,647
Mind if I get a couple of pictures?

949
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:58,134
Is there anything else
I should take a picture of?

950
01:30:07,349 --> 01:30:11,513
You know, I wouldn't even mind this stuff,
if it wasn't for all the airbrushing.

951
01:30:11,686 --> 01:30:16,817
See how smooth her skin is?
She probably has cottage-cheese thighs.

952
01:30:17,258 --> 01:30:18,953
They just paint over it.

953
01:30:19,127 --> 01:30:22,563
And now men look at these pictures
and think that's how women should look.

954
01:30:22,731 --> 01:30:25,996
And women look at these pictures
and think that's how they should look.

955
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,634
Women look at these pictures?

956
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:31,033
Yeah. They look at them
and feel like crap.

957
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:35,068
Do women ever look at them
and feel good?

958
01:30:36,011 --> 01:30:37,808
Well, maybe.

959
01:30:40,215 --> 01:30:42,149
Is that how you feel?

960
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:45,013
I mean, they're sexy pictures.

961
01:30:45,186 --> 01:30:49,646
How anyone feels when they look at them
doesn't really matter. It's private.

962
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:54,924
But how a kid your age
got a magazine like this, that isn't private.

963
01:30:56,665 --> 01:30:58,633
Who gave you this?

964
01:31:02,037 --> 01:31:05,063
Jasira, did an adult give you this?

965
01:31:21,222 --> 01:31:23,656
Try and get some sleep, okay?

966
01:31:40,008 --> 01:31:41,873
<i>When they enter the job market.</i>

967
01:31:42,043 --> 01:31:43,237
<i>Can you give me an example?</i>

968
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:46,005
<i>Well, anytime a teenage
fashion doll is presented in a...</i>

969
01:31:46,181 --> 01:31:48,581
- Hi.
Hi, Melina.

970
01:31:50,251 --> 01:31:52,651
- This is my friend Thomas.
Hey, Thomas.

971
01:31:52,821 --> 01:31:55,949
Hey, can I come over
and hang out with Jasira for a while?

972
01:31:56,324 --> 01:31:58,155
Is that what you want to do?

973
01:31:58,326 --> 01:31:59,725
Yes.

974
01:31:59,894 --> 01:32:02,192
Okay. Get in.

975
01:32:02,731 --> 01:32:05,700
We have to drop by Jasira's place
to pick up some clothes first.

976
01:32:05,867 --> 01:32:10,770
There's something else
I need to get from there. It's kind of gross.

977
01:32:13,475 --> 01:32:15,943
Her name's Snowball.

978
01:32:19,614 --> 01:32:22,378
Well, I'm gonna take a nap.

979
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:26,179
Last couple of days have been maybe
more exciting than I'm used to.

980
01:32:26,955 --> 01:32:29,685
- You two will be okay?
Yes.

981
01:32:36,531 --> 01:32:37,623
Psst.

982
01:32:37,799 --> 01:32:39,061
I have a surprise for you.

983
01:32:56,451 --> 01:32:58,646
- Jasira?
- Oh, shit!

984
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:05,319
Oh, I still have the condom on.

985
01:33:12,534 --> 01:33:14,593
Why was this door closed?

986
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:16,396
I don't know.

987
01:33:18,206 --> 01:33:21,437
Okay, well, you guys
need to go back to the kitchen.

988
01:33:21,609 --> 01:33:24,009
I just have to go to the bathroom.

989
01:33:34,489 --> 01:33:36,354
Hey, baby, I'm home.

990
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:38,586
Hi!

991
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:41,318
You and I will talk about this later.

992
01:33:50,505 --> 01:33:52,598
Emphasis on the:

993
01:33:53,908 --> 01:33:55,341
Hey, Jasira.

994
01:33:57,512 --> 01:34:00,037
Gil told me how to say "hi" in Arabic.

995
01:34:00,215 --> 01:34:02,376
Dinner's almost ready, Mel.

996
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:04,916
Hey, Thomas.
Don't you want to call your mother?

997
01:34:05,086 --> 01:34:06,485
Yeah, I guess I'd better.

998
01:34:06,654 --> 01:34:09,384
Yeah, just use the phone in the study.

999
01:34:34,015 --> 01:34:37,507
Good evening.
We're here to celebrate the end of the war.

1000
01:34:42,257 --> 01:34:43,315
It's okay.

1001
01:34:47,428 --> 01:34:49,020
Come in.

1002
01:34:51,866 --> 01:34:53,629
This is Thena, my girlfriend.

1003
01:34:53,801 --> 01:34:55,291
- Hi. Gil.
- Hi.

1004
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:57,199
Nice to meet you.

1005
01:34:57,372 --> 01:34:59,966
And this is for you, I prepared it myself.

1006
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:02,268
It's baklava, and it's delicious.

1007
01:35:02,443 --> 01:35:05,879
And this is for you.

1008
01:35:06,614 --> 01:35:10,277
It's sparkling cider.

1009
01:35:12,453 --> 01:35:14,318
Good evening, Melina.

1010
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,190
This is my girlfriend, Thena.

1011
01:35:19,727 --> 01:35:21,160
Hi.

1012
01:35:22,597 --> 01:35:24,030
Hello, Jasira.

1013
01:35:27,936 --> 01:35:29,460
Hi.

1014
01:35:30,138 --> 01:35:31,537
Hi.

1015
01:35:33,574 --> 01:35:35,474
Say hello to Thena.

1016
01:35:40,515 --> 01:35:43,678
- Hi, Thena.
- Hi, Jasira.

1017
01:35:45,853 --> 01:35:48,447
It's so good to see you again.

1018
01:35:49,123 --> 01:35:50,590
Melina.
Yeah?

1019
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:52,953
- My mother says I can stay.
- All right.

1020
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:56,062
I just have to make sure
that I'm home by 10:00.

1021
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:57,663
This is Thomas.

1022
01:35:58,266 --> 01:36:02,396
- Hi, Thomas. I'm Thena.
- Hi.

1023
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:05,198
- It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

1024
01:36:06,474 --> 01:36:08,169
Where's Gil?

1025
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:15,872
Hello.

1026
01:36:18,619 --> 01:36:21,053
- It's Thomas.
- I know.

1027
01:36:21,889 --> 01:36:25,052
Well, obviously you forgot
about our dinner tonight.

1028
01:36:25,226 --> 01:36:28,389
Well, I mean, the circumstances
have changed, don't you think?

1029
01:36:28,563 --> 01:36:31,794
- The war is still over.
- We didn't mean to intrude.

1030
01:36:31,966 --> 01:36:37,427
We just thought that maybe this
was a good time for Rifat to see Jasira...

1031
01:36:38,006 --> 01:36:40,873
...and let her know
how much he misses her.

1032
01:36:41,042 --> 01:36:42,873
Yes.

1033
01:36:43,044 --> 01:36:45,638
I would like that very much.

1034
01:36:50,818 --> 01:36:52,786
Okay. Sure.

1035
01:36:52,954 --> 01:36:57,584
Well, why don't you just come on in
and sit down for a few minutes?

1036
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,518
Thank you.

1037
01:37:30,191 --> 01:37:32,921
Excuse me, but may I ask
what he's doing here?

1038
01:37:33,094 --> 01:37:36,359
- I'm a friend of Jasira's.
- Uh-huh.

1039
01:37:36,531 --> 01:37:39,022
Except that Jasira's
not supposed to be seeing you.

1040
01:37:40,034 --> 01:37:41,092
Why not?

1041
01:37:41,836 --> 01:37:44,464
- Because I'm black.
- Ha! Is that the reason?

1042
01:37:48,576 --> 01:37:49,634
Oh, my God.

1043
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:52,439
That's ridiculous.

1044
01:37:54,148 --> 01:37:57,345
I did not make the world the way it is.

1045
01:37:58,286 --> 01:38:01,255
I'm just trying
to spare my daughter shame.

1046
01:38:01,722 --> 01:38:04,350
And now these people
decided to butt into our lives.

1047
01:38:04,525 --> 01:38:06,117
We are just trying to help her.

1048
01:38:06,294 --> 01:38:08,785
Who are you, exactly?
Why should you help?

1049
01:38:08,963 --> 01:38:10,658
Who asked you to help?

1050
01:38:10,832 --> 01:38:12,527
GIL

1051
01:38:34,355 --> 01:38:36,721
I'd like to see where Jasira's sleeping.

1052
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:41,123
I have the right to know
where my daughter's sleeping.

1053
01:38:43,731 --> 01:38:45,858
Okay. Sure.

1054
01:38:46,033 --> 01:38:48,558
It's down the hall,
second door on the right.

1055
01:38:50,138 --> 01:38:51,696
Thank you.

1056
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:03,912
- Great, Gil. I can't believe you let him in.
- Well, he has a right, Mel.

1057
01:39:04,085 --> 01:39:07,748
Not in our house.
She's still his daughter.

1058
01:39:20,434 --> 01:39:23,528
I'm going to take the baklava
to the kitchen.

1059
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:25,262
Thank you.

1060
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:46,891
So...

1061
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:50,529
...mind if I ask when your baby is due?

1062
01:39:50,998 --> 01:39:54,126
Officially, March 10th. But she's already
dropped, so it could be...

1063
01:39:54,302 --> 01:39:55,326
- She?
... any day.

1064
01:39:55,503 --> 01:39:57,334
You already know it's a girl?

1065
01:39:57,505 --> 01:40:00,497
Girls are so much more fun than boys.

1066
01:40:00,675 --> 01:40:03,303
That is so exciting. Congratulations.

1067
01:40:03,477 --> 01:40:04,808
Thomas!

1068
01:40:05,646 --> 01:40:07,978
- Get up.
What?

1069
01:40:08,749 --> 01:40:11,843
- Stop it!
- Rifat! Stop it!

1070
01:40:14,388 --> 01:40:16,015
What the hell? That's disgusting!

1071
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:18,420
I found a condom in your toilet.

1072
01:40:18,593 --> 01:40:21,289
- You're snooping in our toilet?
His jacket's on her bed...

1073
01:40:21,462 --> 01:40:23,953
...and his condom is in your toilet.

1074
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:26,656
He's the only one here
who needs one, right?

1075
01:40:26,834 --> 01:40:27,994
Oh, my God.

1076
01:40:28,169 --> 01:40:30,603
You think I'm terrible,
but you let my daughter...

1077
01:40:30,771 --> 01:40:32,830
...take boys in her room?
- We don't.

1078
01:40:33,007 --> 01:40:36,465
- Jasira, get your things. We're going home.
Just hold on a second. Hold...

1079
01:40:36,644 --> 01:40:40,512
Go ahead, call the police.
You have her leg, but I have the rubber.

1080
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:44,276
- You both are terrible too. Terrible people.
- It's my fault. Blame me.

1081
01:40:44,452 --> 01:40:47,319
- Of course I blame you, Thomas!
- It's not his fault!

1082
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:51,117
And you, Mrs. Hines. For letting
my daughter lose her virginity in your house!

1083
01:40:51,292 --> 01:40:54,159
- I didn't lose it here.
- She lost it at my house.

1084
01:40:54,328 --> 01:40:55,852
No!

1085
01:41:00,001 --> 01:41:01,628
I lost it at your house, Daddy.

1086
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:10,374
Mr. Vuoso did it with his fingers.

1087
01:41:15,316 --> 01:41:17,716
I didn't want him to...

1088
01:41:18,953 --> 01:41:20,614
...but he did.

1089
01:41:40,841 --> 01:41:43,776
Someone from the DA's office...

1090
01:41:45,246 --> 01:41:46,713
In the meantime, here's my card.

1091
01:41:46,881 --> 01:41:50,817
If you need anything, or if she just feels
she needs to talk, you can give me a call.

1092
01:41:50,985 --> 01:41:53,681
So I can get ahold of you directly?
Yes.

1093
01:41:53,854 --> 01:41:57,221
We'll call you if anything else
comes up, but thank you for your help.

1094
01:41:57,391 --> 01:41:59,689
All right? Take care, now.

1095
01:42:00,261 --> 01:42:01,956
Jasira?

1096
01:42:07,935 --> 01:42:11,393
I can't understand
why you never told me about this before.

1097
01:42:15,042 --> 01:42:16,873
I thought you would be mad.

1098
01:42:17,912 --> 01:42:20,779
Why would I be mad
if somebody's hurting you?

1099
01:42:20,948 --> 01:42:23,576
Okay. Let's call it a night.

1100
01:42:24,385 --> 01:42:27,183
What if I want to spend some time
with my daughter?

1101
01:42:27,755 --> 01:42:29,780
Come on, Rifat.

1102
01:42:33,394 --> 01:42:35,862
You can't come home with me?

1103
01:42:37,131 --> 01:42:38,598
Not even for one night?

1104
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:46,631
I'm talking to you, Jasira, not to her.

1105
01:42:52,747 --> 01:42:54,214
No.

1106
01:42:55,383 --> 01:42:56,782
I can't.

1107
01:43:03,324 --> 01:43:06,384
I didn't tell the policewoman this...

1108
01:43:07,061 --> 01:43:10,622
...but the other time
that I did it with Mr. Vuoso...

1109
01:43:11,732 --> 01:43:15,190
...I acted like I wanted to,
even though I didn't.

1110
01:43:19,006 --> 01:43:20,473
Why?

1111
01:43:20,808 --> 01:43:22,776
I don't know.

1112
01:43:22,943 --> 01:43:25,503
I thought I was supposed to.

1113
01:43:27,415 --> 01:43:30,873
Jasira, you never have to have sex
if you don't want to.

1114
01:43:31,051 --> 01:43:32,575
Never.

1115
01:43:32,953 --> 01:43:35,183
And a grown man knows that.

1116
01:43:35,756 --> 01:43:39,590
If he has sex with anybody
under the age of 16, it's rape.

1117
01:43:40,628 --> 01:43:42,755
Even if she wants to do it.

1118
01:43:43,597 --> 01:43:45,963
But I feel sorry for him.

1119
01:43:48,869 --> 01:43:51,429
Don't you feel sorry for him.

1120
01:43:52,606 --> 01:43:54,233
Ever.

1121
01:44:17,231 --> 01:44:19,324
You should have told me.

1122
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:21,930
I didn't want to tell you.

1123
01:44:25,506 --> 01:44:27,531
Was there a lot of blood?

1124
01:44:28,976 --> 01:44:30,944
Mm-hm.

1125
01:44:35,049 --> 01:44:37,210
That was my blood, not his.

1126
01:44:38,419 --> 01:44:42,150
No, it wasn't. It was my blood.

1127
01:44:47,094 --> 01:44:49,927
I don't think
we should have sex anymore.

1128
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:55,535
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

1129
01:44:56,170 --> 01:45:00,072
No, I just don't think it'll be right.

1130
01:45:00,608 --> 01:45:02,735
Not after what that asshole did to you.

1131
01:45:10,684 --> 01:45:12,709
I don't want to stop.

1132
01:45:15,222 --> 01:45:17,747
I like having sex with you.

1133
01:45:22,296 --> 01:45:26,494
I don't want to lose that
because of what Mr. Vuoso did.

1134
01:45:52,326 --> 01:45:56,888
I've already mailed you a copy of
the canceled check as well as faxed it twice.

1135
01:45:57,064 --> 01:46:00,363
And you're saying for us
to complete the claim form as well.

1136
01:46:01,468 --> 01:46:03,095
All right, yeah, I'll fax it again.

1137
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:06,603
But tell me exactly who
I should send it to the attention of?

1138
01:46:07,508 --> 01:46:09,476
I've already faxed it to her.

1139
01:46:20,254 --> 01:46:21,278
Hi.

1140
01:46:22,156 --> 01:46:26,593
- What are you doing here? Get away.
- I just need to give you something.

1141
01:46:29,797 --> 01:46:33,824
- They let you go?
- I'm out on bail.

1142
01:46:36,370 --> 01:46:41,000
Daddy ran over Snowball,
so we froze her.

1143
01:46:43,444 --> 01:46:46,072
She ran out while I was talking to Zack.

1144
01:47:06,567 --> 01:47:08,558
It ain't your fault.

1145
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:13,934
You stop! Get away from her.

1146
01:47:18,812 --> 01:47:22,111
- Daddy! Daddy, help!
Jasira!

1147
01:47:22,282 --> 01:47:25,683
- She fell! Melina! She fell!
- What's wrong? Who fell?

1148
01:47:25,853 --> 01:47:28,321
There's blood in between her legs!
She won't wake up!

1149
01:47:28,489 --> 01:47:30,787
It's all right, sweetheart. Just call 911...

1150
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:33,222
...and tell them we need an ambulance,
all right?

1151
01:47:33,394 --> 01:47:35,157
Jesus Christ!

1152
01:47:35,329 --> 01:47:36,956
Oh, never mind. It's already here!

1153
01:47:47,274 --> 01:47:50,437
All right, I got the stretcher.
All right, I got the kit.

1154
01:47:52,279 --> 01:47:54,304
Hey, hurry, please. She's not responding.

1155
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:56,449
Yes, sir. We're coming. We got it.

1156
01:47:57,117 --> 01:47:59,813
Daddy, she wants us to be there.

1157
01:47:59,987 --> 01:48:02,820
I'm not watching her have a baby.
That's none of my business.

1158
01:48:02,990 --> 01:48:06,323
But she doesn't think her husband
will make it here in time. Please.

1159
01:48:09,730 --> 01:48:12,927
Well, I'm just gonna bring it in.
It'll be okay. One more swab.

1160
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:16,228
Sir, if you're gonna stay,
you'll need to put on a gown.

1161
01:48:19,073 --> 01:48:21,906
- I'm just saying hello.
Okay, honey, rest while you can.

1162
01:48:22,076 --> 01:48:23,976
You're really not staying?

1163
01:48:24,578 --> 01:48:29,015
- I'd rather not, Mrs. Hines.
- Didn't you see Jasira's birth?

1164
01:48:31,485 --> 01:48:33,783
Those were different times.

1165
01:48:45,265 --> 01:48:47,165
Jasira will stay with you.

1166
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:51,001
That will be much better.

1167
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,273
Yeah.

1168
01:48:57,978 --> 01:48:59,969
She's a good girl.

1169
01:49:02,916 --> 01:49:04,941
Yeah. She is.

1170
01:49:15,429 --> 01:49:16,987
Thank you.

1171
01:49:26,006 --> 01:49:28,167
Got the smaller cl...? Yeah, that's it.

1172
01:49:28,342 --> 01:49:31,209
Daddy doesn't like bodies.
