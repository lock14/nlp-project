1
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,807
<i>I put a spell on you</i>

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,088
<i>Because you're mine</i>

3
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,963
<i>You better stop
the thing that you do</i>

4
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,889
<i>I said watch out</i>

5
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,609
<i>I ain't lyin.</i>

6
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,284
<i>Yeah</i>

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,686
<i>I ain't gonna take
none of your</i>

8
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,448
<i>Foolin' around</i>

9
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,609
<i>I ain't gonna take
none of your</i>

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,686
<i>Puttin' me down</i>

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,648
<i>I put a spell on you</i>

12
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,936
- I see a rabbit.
- Where?

13
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,897
Up there. One that's got big,
droopy ears.

14
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,899
That's a shoe.
That's a shoe.

15
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:23,420
- It's more of a... It's a boot. A lace-up
boot. - It's a boot, like your boot.

16
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,819
Now what is it?

17
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:42,067
<i>I put a spell on you</i>

18
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,546
<i>Cos you're mine</i>

19
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,424
<i>You better stop the
thing that you're doin'</i>

20
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,507
<i>I said watch out</i>

21
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:01,822
<i>I ain't lyin.</i>

22
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,187
<i>Yeah</i>

23
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,550
<i>I ain't gonna take
none of your</i>

24
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:12,586
<i>Foolin' around</i>

25
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:16,788
<i>Ain't gonna take
none of your</i>

26
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:19,670
<i>Puttin' me down</i>

27
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,871
<i>I put a spell on you</i>

28
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:27,950
<i>Cos you're mine</i>

29
00:03:28,424 --> 00:03:31,429
<i>Oh, you're mine</i>

30
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,675
They're all moving into
these houses, Rosie.

31
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:27,913
A whole nation.
A whole fucking world of plastic houses.

32
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:32,278
It's like a rash. It's eating up
this island like a case of bad acne.

33
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,672
In 30 years, there won't be
anything left that isn't suburbia...

34
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,156
...or the ghettos.

35
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,834
Cos they all want to live in places
with people exactly like themselves.

36
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,031
They have their own police forces,
some of them,

37
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,353
to keep their greedy
little children safe.

38
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,036
And they have the vanity to call this
place a community. Look at this crap!

39
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:07,637
That's not a house.
It's a thing to keep the TV dry.

40
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:10,033
I wish we had a TV.

41
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:11,478
No, you don't.

42
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:16,141
I swear, I solemnly believe
that humanity is now

43
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:19,009
officially descending
the ladder of evolution.

44
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,245
In a thousand years,
human beings will be the size of gerbils

45
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:23,476
and they'll have one
thought a year...

46
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:26,043
...in December.

47
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:29,521
They'll think about what
they want for Christmas.

48
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,918
Decline and rot, my angel,
that's the way of the world...

49
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:37,518
...except for you.

50
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:39,564
You're exempt.

51
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,485
Remember that.

52
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:10,327
Jack Slavin for Marty Rance.

53
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,242
Hey, Marty.
Me again.

54
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,365
That's government land
that you're eating into.

55
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,608
50 yards of nature preserve.
That is a wetland, as I'm sure you know.

56
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,411
You can call the cops if you want to.
I'll call them myself.

57
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,644
I look forward to
seeing the outcome.

58
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,052
We needed a doorstop.

59
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,649
What are you thinking about?

60
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:12,045
I'm going to plant the bell flowers
in front of the house today.

61
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,932
At least leave me
a place to walk.

62
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,173
- You're getting freckles.
- I always had those.

63
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:31,774
<i>No, there's nothin'
you can send me</i>

64
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:33,975
<i>My own true love</i>

65
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,737
<i>There's nothing I'm
wishin' to be ownin'</i>

66
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:46,896
<i>Just carry yourself
back to me unspoiled</i>

67
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,411
<i>From across that
lonesome ocean</i>

68
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,973
<i>Oh, but I just thought
you might want something fine</i>

69
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,016
<i>Made of silver
or of golden</i>

70
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:16,536
<i>Either from the
mountains of Madrid</i>

71
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:22,302
<i>Or from the
coast of Barcelona</i>

72
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:31,300
<i>If I had the stars
of the darkest night</i>

73
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:37,020
<i>And the diamonds from
the deepest ocean</i>

74
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:43,777
<i>I'd forsake them all
for your sweet kiss</i>

75
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:49,774
<i>For that's all I'm
wishin' to be ownin'</i>

76
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,504
Rosie, Rosie.

77
00:08:58,735 --> 00:09:02,104
That's a sweet little bridge,
but I wouldn't want to drive across it.

78
00:09:02,176 --> 00:09:04,621
Well, seeing as we
never go anywhere...

79
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:07,195
You still don't understand
weight-stress ratios.

80
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:09,450
I understand them enough.

81
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:12,825
- Enough for what?
- Everyday needs.

82
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:16,508
The Latin name for "buttercup"
will only get you so far.

83
00:09:16,577 --> 00:09:18,546
Let me write that again.

84
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,147
One more time...

85
00:09:22,217 --> 00:09:23,708
...with feeling!

86
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,984
What is the Latin
name for "buttercup"?

87
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,061
Ranunculus Bulbosus.

88
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:43,868
What?

89
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,341
I'm glad I got to know
you for such a long time.

90
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,548
Don't say stuff like that.

91
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,989
- I have to face up to it.
- Shut up, OK?

92
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,302
Do you not think we should
get somebody in to help?

93
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,349
Who, a maid?

94
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:02,905
Don't go off, Rosie.

95
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:28,273
Go away.

96
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:41,990
What is it?

97
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:44,834
You're going to leave me soon.

98
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:48,793
You're the one that's
going to leave soon.

99
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,355
You're getting too big for me.

100
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:56,515
Look at the size
of that hand.

101
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,552
No, you're going to die.

102
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:04,316
It's just the way it is.

103
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,269
I mean, this thing may be...

104
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:09,429
pumping away for
some while to come.

105
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,356
When you die,
I'm going to die.

106
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:19,235
- What on earth are you
talking about? - I am.

107
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,596
What are you going to die of?

108
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,678
When you go, I'm going.

109
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,751
If you die,
there's no point to my life.

110
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,759
Tough luck.

111
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,720
Don't you ever say that again.

112
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:50,399
Do you hear me?
You never say that again.

113
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,640
Tell me a story.

114
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:00,160
Come on.

115
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:10,077
Once...
there was a girl...

116
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:16,000
and she lived in
a little tiny house.

117
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:21,639
And one day an ox came by.

118
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:24,322
And the girl was so polite,

119
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:28,003
she said,
"Ox, would you care to join me for tea?"

120
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:33,643
The ox wasn't used to being spoken to
very much. He was flattered.

121
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:36,196
He said,
"Thank you, yes. "

122
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,841
And he proceeded to put
his nose through the door.

123
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:46,086
His nose had a big ring in it.

124
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:50,201
The girl pulled as hard
as she could on the ring

125
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,246
to try to get the
ox through the door.

126
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,885
The ox pushed and pushed.

127
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,927
The girl pulled and pulled.

128
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,042
Cracks started to appear
around the walls.

129
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,520
Then the ox gave one
great almighty push.

130
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,048
The whole house
collapsed around them.

131
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,361
So she climbed up
on the ox's back

132
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:16,602
and they rode away together.

133
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,009
In the course of time,
they were married.

134
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,971
Let me look at you.

135
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,691
I'm never going to leave you,
you know.

136
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:10,368
I have to go to
town tonight, Rosie.

137
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:14,370
There's some stuff I've got to do there.
I may not be back until the morning.

138
00:14:14,446 --> 00:14:16,413
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

139
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,615
- I'll see you later, Rosie.
- OK.

140
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,577
<i>Seen a shooting star tonight</i>

141
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,341
<i>And I thought of you</i>

142
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,096
<i>You were trying to
break into another world</i>

143
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:01,139
<i>A world I never knew</i>

144
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,139
<i>I always kind of wondered</i>

145
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,380
<i>If you ever made it through</i>

146
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,100
<i>Seen a shooting star tonight</i>

147
00:15:12,532 --> 00:15:14,102
<i>And I thought of you</i>

148
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,095
<i>Seen a shooting star tonight</i>

149
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,864
<i>And I thought of me</i>

150
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:31,465
<i>If I was still the same</i>

151
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,984
<i>If I ever became what
you wanted me to be</i>

152
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,418
<i>Did I miss the mark</i>

153
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:40,825
<i>Or overstep the line</i>

154
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,577
<i>That only you could see?</i>

155
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,504
<i>Seen a shooting star tonight</i>

156
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:48,500
<i>And I thought of me</i>

157
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:58,417
- Is she here?
- She's downstairs.

158
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:33,820
You got thinner.

159
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,388
Hi, by the way.

160
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,912
I was thinking maybe
you'd come live with me.

161
00:17:09,983 --> 00:17:13,031
- What?
- You heard.

162
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:16,074
You've never even
invited me out there.

163
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,025
- You like me that much, huh?
- Yep.

164
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:27,032
What about my kids?

165
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:29,669
Well, that goes without saying.

166
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,947
What about Rose?

167
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,717
- Have you thought this through?
- Through?

168
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:42,919
I've thought about it,
but I'm not clairvoyant.

169
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:46,022
- You know what I mean, Jack.
- Come live with me.

170
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:48,792
Quit your job.
Quit your jobs.

171
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:52,276
I can make life easier for you.

172
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:56,035
Just to prove that...
I'm in earnest...

173
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:14,271
Call that an early-retirement
package.

174
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,436
Er...

175
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,953
It's not coming out right, is it?

176
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:23,519
No.

177
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,278
I'm sorry.

178
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:30,672
Look, come live with me.
Give it a try.

179
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,280
I'll take care of you or you
take care of me. Whatever.

180
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,599
My kid needs a woman
around the place and... so do I.

181
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,721
I need you.

182
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,400
How's that?

183
00:18:49,313 --> 00:18:51,519
What are you thinking?

184
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:53,595
I'm wondering if you're
crazy or not.

185
00:18:54,673 --> 00:18:58,041
That's a waste of time, honey.

186
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,486
My poor tree house.

187
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,445
We can rebuild it. That's not a problem.
Do you really use it any more?

188
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,487
It's my house.

189
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,641
- Rose...
- Yes?

190
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,803
There's some people coming
that I've invited. Guests.

191
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,086
- Guests?
- People...

192
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,128
just come to stay for a while.

193
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,209
It's an experiment.

194
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,248
OK?

195
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,009
New chapter.

196
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:27,765
Hey!

197
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:30,005
Welcome, strangers.

198
00:20:31,843 --> 00:20:35,483
- I see you er...
- Yeah. A couple of things.

199
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,693
So glad to finally meet you, Rose.

200
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:46,172
- I'm Jack.
- Yeah, I'm Thaddius.

201
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:49,964
Thaddius. Right.
You must be Rodney. Welcome.

202
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:52,173
These are my boys.
That's Thaddius...

203
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:54,373
Rodney...
This is Rose.

204
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:57,412
Oh, I'm Kathleen.

205
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:59,965
Wow!
Does anybody else live out here?

206
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:03,367
Er... used to be a commune.

207
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:07,609
There was 60 people living here,
give or take, at one time.

208
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:12,248
Engineers, farmers, carpenters,
a couple of scientists...

209
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:16,855
We were trying to...
Well, it wasn't what you see in the movies.

210
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:19,977
We weren't painting ourselves
orange and shaking tambourines

211
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:22,049
and whatever else
they got up to then.

212
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:25,654
We were trying to...
rebuild society on a small scale.

213
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:31,574
We were trying to figure out a way people
could live without destroying the planet,

214
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:35,413
with virtually no waste
or private property and...

215
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:41,652
I'll take that.
It was an experiment.

216
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,096
It looks like it didn't go too well.

217
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,851
- No, we learnt some stuff.
- Watch it.

218
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:53,897
- This is it.
- Oh, Jack...

219
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,862
Just put all your stuff down there for now.
Bring the rest in later on.

220
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,615
Where do you really live?

221
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:05,979
In my aunt's basement.

222
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:08,019
How long are you
going to stay here?

223
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,824
Not very long, personally,

224
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:16,296
but I have a feeling that my mother will
be embedded here for quite some time.

225
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:19,421
You get a lot of postcards.

226
00:22:19,492 --> 00:22:21,461
My mother used to send them.

227
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:24,693
- Uh-huh.
- She left when I was five.

228
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,260
She might be coming back.

229
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:31,301
- Oh, dear.
- Rose?

230
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:35,982
Would you like to help me set the table? I'm
just going to make some cheese sandwiches.

231
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:39,662
- No, no... - Oh, that's cooked
food for the chickens

232
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:44,740
and that's raw food for the compost and
the big one... metal and plastic, paper.

233
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:47,786
- You'll get the hang of it.
- Yeah. OK.

234
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:50,540
Any questions about
the house, ask Rose.

235
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:54,019
One of you can sleep in
here for the time being,

236
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:58,500
and the other one's on the couch until
we get one of the outbuildings fixed up.

237
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:02,423
- That's fine.
- Is that all right with you?

238
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,703
- Mm-hm.
- It's so quiet in here.

239
00:23:04,777 --> 00:23:06,744
It's like the inside of a can.

240
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:09,946
Hey, where's the TV?

241
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,941
No TV.

242
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:16,820
Are you working at
the moment, Rodney?

243
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:20,789
I've been studying to be
a women's hairdresser.

244
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,059
What brought you to that?

245
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:26,300
Erm...
I always wanted to be a barber,

246
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:29,509
but men don't get enough
pleasure out of their hair.

247
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,705
Did you do er...?

248
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,111
Kathleen.

249
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,105
- Yeah. Her hair?
- No, I didn't do Kathy's hair.

250
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,268
My mother likes to think of
herself as being 16 years old.

251
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,027
- Oh, Rodney!
- I'm sure if I cut her hair off,

252
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:45,830
she would have a
breakdown of some kind.

253
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,989
How do you make your money?

254
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,186
I inherited the family business
when my father died, so I sold it.

255
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:57,824
- Oh. So you're loaded? - I don't think
you need to worry about that.

256
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,826
- Mom said you were an engineer.
- That's what I studied.

257
00:24:00,903 --> 00:24:04,875
- Er... alternative energy.
- You got your degree in England?

258
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:09,074
Scotland, but I've been
an American since 1972.

259
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:11,270
Naturalised citizen,
God help me.

260
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,994
Why did you do it, then?

261
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:19,355
Because I fell in love with this country,
or... what I thought it was going to become.

262
00:24:21,305 --> 00:24:24,387
You've got one more year
of school left, is that right?

263
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:29,153
- Yeah, I guess so. - I was expelled
in the last year of high school.

264
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:30,590
Why?

265
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:33,829
For defecating in the thirteenth
hole of the school golf course.

266
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:37,797
- Your school had a golf course?
- He's doing real well in school.

267
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:42,069
- Is that for me?
- Yeah, sweetie. It's a cheese sandwich.

268
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:45,753
I haven't seen one
like that since 1953.

269
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:51,556
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

270
00:24:51,627 --> 00:24:53,073
Sorry.

271
00:24:59,188 --> 00:25:01,155
Rose...

272
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:05,440
Don't make me bloody
well chase after you!

273
00:25:08,788 --> 00:25:11,838
They're not guests.
They're moving in!

274
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,834
They're guests, until we see.

275
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,117
Just see how it works out.

276
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:19,318
- They brought everything!
- Everything?

277
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:21,363
They brought their lamps!

278
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,578
I've got to admit,
those lamps were shocking.

279
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:28,346
Look, it's just an
experiment, Rosie.

280
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,073
Let's just try it for a while
to see how it works out.

281
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:34,996
God forbid, you might even
end up wanting them to stay!

282
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:38,361
- You tricked me!
- It was a spur-of-the-moment decision.

283
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,079
She's so regular.

284
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:46,519
Kathleen, her name is,
by the way.

285
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:50,038
That's the whole point.
She'll take care of things.

286
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:53,481
- I took care of things!
- We took care of things. Now I'm sick.

287
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:02,195
How long have you
been lying to me?

288
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,362
How could you
not have told me?

289
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:15,758
I didn't think you'd understand.

290
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,443
I don't.

291
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,487
Hey, little freak.

292
00:26:49,598 --> 00:26:50,964
Ever eaten a snake before?

293
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,404
No.

294
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,202
I know these kind of woods.

295
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,008
You got copperheads in there,
don't you?

296
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,412
There's a few that live under
a dead tree in the woods.

297
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,087
Show me where the tree is.
I used to trap snakes for this evangelist.

298
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:11,371
- What did he do with them?
- Put on a show.

299
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:15,325
Said he had the power of God
cos he didn't get bitten.

300
00:27:16,082 --> 00:27:17,923
Did he have the power of God?

301
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:21,769
He died of a snakebite.

302
00:27:37,884 --> 00:27:39,853
There.

303
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:43,965
So does your dad know
about this place?

304
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,804
Maybe.

305
00:27:46,884 --> 00:27:49,536
Does he know
everything about you?

306
00:27:57,806 --> 00:27:59,330
Wild thing.

307
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,455
I'll give you a bedtime story
you won't forget.

308
00:29:37,894 --> 00:29:40,865
- What are you doing?
- I want you to do it to me.

309
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:44,979
- Huh! Oh, my God.
- I never did it before.

310
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:47,023
Not even partly.

311
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:51,546
And erm... what made you select
tonight for your initiation?

312
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:54,301
Cos I have to do it right away.

313
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,859
Er, my brother is out
at the moment...

314
00:29:57,938 --> 00:30:00,258
probably doing something
along these lines,

315
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:04,104
so if you want to take a seat in his
room I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige.

316
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,942
I don't like him.

317
00:30:06,018 --> 00:30:08,419
That's funny.
I don't like him, either.

318
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:14,666
Look, it's not funny.

319
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,307
OK?
This is tragic.

320
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,907
It's...

321
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,950
It's not exactly tragic.
It's er... it's ridiculous.

322
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,107
OK?

323
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,308
No.

324
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,384
OK, no, look.
Look, wait.

325
00:30:43,461 --> 00:30:45,544
I wasn't aware that,

326
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:50,150
on top of being trapped in retro world
due to my mother's saviour complex,

327
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:55,262
I myself was to become
a sort of sex toy...

328
00:30:56,383 --> 00:30:59,990
...for my angelic,
possibly disturbed,

329
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,066
certainly odd new sister.

330
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,748
OK?
Let's...

331
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:05,791
Let's not forget that part.

332
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:09,265
Huh!
Who are you people?

333
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:12,665
- But I like you.
- Christ...

334
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:22,516
Just...
Just...

335
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:28,113
I'm just er...
I'm not ready to unpeel my nylon

336
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,587
at this particular point in time.

337
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:32,907
Not for anybody.
It's nothing personal.

338
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:42,673
Hey...
I got an idea.

339
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:47,148
It's...
It's kind of a compromise.

340
00:31:50,387 --> 00:31:52,356
Do you mind if it's radical?

341
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:06,397
<i>I put a spell on you</i>

342
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,439
<i>Cos you're mine</i>

343
00:32:20,631 --> 00:32:22,598
<i>You'd better stop
the things you do</i>

344
00:32:27,152 --> 00:32:29,119
<i>I ain't lyin.</i>

345
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,519
<i>No I ain't lyin.</i>

346
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:37,480
<i>You know I can't stand it</i>

347
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:40,280
<i>Your running around</i>

348
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:42,762
<i>You know better, Daddy</i>

349
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,002
<i>I can't stand it cos
you put me down</i>

350
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,281
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

351
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:53,001
<i>I put a spell on you</i>

352
00:32:56,994 --> 00:32:59,281
<i>Because you're mine</i>

353
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:04,560
<i>You're mine</i>

354
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,720
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

355
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:41,447
<i>I love you, I love you</i>

356
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,009
<i>I love you</i>

357
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:45,810
<i>I love you anyhow</i>

358
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,962
<i>And I don't care if
you don't want me</i>

359
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,247
<i>I'm yours right now</i>

360
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,086
Jesus Christ!

361
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:05,846
Come on.

362
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:20,849
Oh, God...

363
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:24,891
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

364
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,010
Rodney did it for me.

365
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:30,851
I was referring to
the loaded gun.

366
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:38,253
You're a bloody little hooligan.

367
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:43,893
What are you doing?

368
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:06,974
Look what he did to you.

369
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:16,735
Do you love me?

370
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:25,855
Is she all right?

371
00:35:41,411 --> 00:35:43,014
Good night, my little dove.

372
00:35:59,211 --> 00:36:01,179
What was Rose's mother like?

373
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,340
What was your wife like?

374
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:10,342
Just about the opposite of you.

375
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:15,498
- What does that mean?
- Well, you know. You.

376
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,541
Imagine the opposite of you.

377
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:22,065
Thin hair, dark eyes, big tits?

378
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:25,105
- Go a little deeper.
- Rich?

379
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,023
She was inscrutable,

380
00:36:33,335 --> 00:36:37,021
dreamy, capricious,

381
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,418
deceitful and totally selfish.

382
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:44,418
Oh.
So it was a compliment.

383
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,978
Everything from me to you is a compliment,
no matter what it sounds like.

384
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:51,947
- That's a mean game.
- Come here and I'll show you a mean game.

385
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:58,027
- Has Rose ever talked to a psychologist?
- Like your son, maybe?

386
00:36:58,097 --> 00:37:00,065
The psychology of hair?
Jesus!

387
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:02,378
No, I'm just...
I'm wondering.

388
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:06,827
- Is she still in school?
- I took her out when she was 11.

389
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:10,106
How could you not
send her to school?

390
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:11,940
Don't believe in factory farming.
I teach her here.

391
00:37:12,166 --> 00:37:14,885
Well, Rose is the
way you made her.

392
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,021
What are you getting at,
Kathleen?

393
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:21,150
Well, you raised her,
so she couldn't love anybody else.

394
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,268
She's not used to having
anybody around.

395
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,581
We come along and she
gets a little upset.

396
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:31,344
What are you going to do when
it's time for her to get a job?

397
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,623
Listen, there are wonderful schools for
children with problems. My cousin Vera...

398
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,465
Shut your bloody mouth!

399
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:42,590
Did you hear that?

400
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:50,791
There's nothing wrong with Rose.

401
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:59,030
- If you don't think things will work
out here, fine. - I don't. I...

402
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,429
Jack, I didn't mean it that way.
I'm just...

403
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:07,871
Look, it's not, you know,
that easy for me.

404
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:11,505
I mean, I just, you know, I...
I'm sorry, OK? I'm not judging you.

405
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:15,556
It's just like, you know, we see
each other... I'm not, you know.

406
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,436
We see each other for four months,
you don't tell her about me

407
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,476
and I'm supposed to move in here.
I don't...

408
00:38:22,626 --> 00:38:25,597
- What?
- I don't... I don't understand.

409
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:30,115
Understanding, whatever the hell that means,
doesn't make a blind bit of difference.

410
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:32,235
Look, believe me, Kathleen,
I've...

411
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:36,590
...I've made a mess of a lot
of things in my life.

412
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:38,635
I don't have time
to pay for them.

413
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:48,588
So I'm just trying to live
a different way now.

414
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:55,230
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

415
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,916
That's what I need you for.

416
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,760
Are you equal to it or not?

417
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:08,070
- Yeah.
- Good.

418
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,119
OK.

419
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,670
I'm going to take really
good care of you. OK?

420
00:39:14,751 --> 00:39:16,719
I believe it.

421
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:26,679
Careful.
I'm a sick man.

422
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,041
Good morning, Rose.

423
00:39:39,114 --> 00:39:41,081
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine.

424
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:44,963
Breakfast in a minute, Rodney.
Don't look so droopy.

425
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:49,315
Thaddius!
Thaddius!

426
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:54,715
Morning, Rodney.

427
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:56,762
Interesting job
on Rose last night.

428
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:59,077
- Thank you.
- I think it looks great, honey.

429
00:39:59,155 --> 00:40:01,237
I didn't mean for it
to be so explosive.

430
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,478
You sure scared
us last night, Rose.

431
00:40:04,556 --> 00:40:08,447
You know, you shouldn't walk around
with guns, even when you're kidding.

432
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:11,041
- I wasn't kidding.
- Excuse me?

433
00:40:23,038 --> 00:40:26,166
What are you wearing?
Huh?

434
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:34,123
Well, that's half the
day's electricity gone!

435
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:41,927
Oh, no food again.
Thank God!

436
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,003
You've already lost 16lb, honey.
Let's just keep it up.

437
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:49,771
- Thaddius! Breakfast.
- Hey...

438
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,001
Now!

439
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:53,286
I love my life.

440
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,889
Excuse me.

441
00:41:08,922 --> 00:41:11,289
- What are you doing today?
- I don't know.

442
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:14,333
Maybe I'll go find a job mowing
some other rich people's lawns.

443
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:17,246
Are there any other people
on this island, or what?

444
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:21,452
Soon you won't be able to take
a piss without 15 people clapping.

445
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:23,490
May I be excused?

446
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:30,489
Turn the light on, at least. You'll ruin
your eyes always reading in the dark.

447
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:33,454
You know, Thaddius used
to work in a garage.

448
00:41:34,373 --> 00:41:36,570
I was just thinking, you know,

449
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,242
it's amazing your skin stayed so clear
after working in that grime for so long.

450
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:44,653
- Pancake, Rose?
- Sure.

451
00:41:44,724 --> 00:41:47,047
- What are you on about?
- He's gorgeous.

452
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:50,447
He probably already has a date
lined up for tonight. Right, Thaddius?

453
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:54,452
He has been known to date farm
animals under extreme duress.

454
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:57,530
Rodney, are you ever going to take
that jacket off so I can wash it?

455
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:00,291
- Yeah, Linus, maybe you'd
get a date too. - Hey...

456
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:04,293
Can I come with you
to look for your job?

457
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:09,692
You're not going anywhere.
You've got work to do.

458
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:14,494
And you can start by
putting some clothes on.

459
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,217
I see that I'm on toilet duty again today.

460
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:57,177
- It's a rotating schedule.
- Mm.

461
00:42:57,251 --> 00:43:01,143
- Another man, another programme.
- Would you please shut your mouth?

462
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:08,983
If this one ever gives you anything,
I'd like a commission.

463
00:43:32,056 --> 00:43:35,538
Well, what do you know?
You're interested in make-up.

464
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:37,583
Oh, don't worry about it.

465
00:43:38,456 --> 00:43:40,538
Let me help you.
Do you want to sit down?

466
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:45,702
You're such a pretty girl,
you should learn how to use it.

467
00:43:45,777 --> 00:43:48,179
I was only a couple of
years older than you...

468
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,385
...when I had Rodney.

469
00:43:53,018 --> 00:43:55,704
It's hard to believe.
You seem like a little girl.

470
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:02,586
Do you want to
be my dad's wife?

471
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:08,940
Er...
Well, one step at a time.

472
00:44:09,659 --> 00:44:13,106
With your dad's heart as weak as it is,
I'm just trying to keep him alive.

473
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,186
It would help if he ate
a little meat occasionally.

474
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:21,543
This... you need to learn
to do without a mirror.

475
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,228
Mm.

476
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,548
Do you ever want to
have kids some day?

477
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:34,550
Do you want to work?
Have a career?

478
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,110
Do you ever want
to leave the island?

479
00:44:49,902 --> 00:44:53,510
- Aah! - Why do you
always wear that jacket?

480
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:58,590
- Just scrub your tub, Miss Muffet. - You
know what? It's too hot, so take it off.

481
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:02,192
- You're all sweaty. I'm going to
get that off you! - Help, help!

482
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:05,074
No! That's not funny!
You're a sadist.

483
00:45:05,144 --> 00:45:08,672
- You're a sadist! Stop it!
- Jesse?

484
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,552
Jesse!
Come here, boy!

485
00:45:13,065 --> 00:45:15,114
Hey!
What happened to you?

486
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:18,226
Mom's got me
cleaning the latrines.

487
00:45:18,306 --> 00:45:20,273
- Who's Mom?
- Ask Jack.

488
00:45:22,427 --> 00:45:24,634
- You've brought everything?
- Yep.

489
00:45:24,706 --> 00:45:26,835
That's great.
Thanks.

490
00:45:26,907 --> 00:45:28,989
Hi.

491
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:31,715
- Hi.
- I'm Kathleen.

492
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:36,469
- I deliver flowers for Rose
every now and then. - Oh.

493
00:45:36,547 --> 00:45:38,630
- Well, you must have a name.
- Gray.

494
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:42,268
That's a nice name.
Rose certainly is a passionate gardener.

495
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:44,750
Er, yes, she's... got the touch.

496
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,150
Yeah. It's probably
good for her, too.

497
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:51,800
All right. Well, go on with your day.
It's nice to meet you.

498
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:54,349
If you want any lemonade,
I've got some in the kitchen.

499
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,271
OK.

500
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,641
Hi.
I didn't see you there.

501
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,797
- Could you do me a favour?
- Sure, what?

502
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:11,351
Could you teach me how to kiss?

503
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,317
- What?
- Please.

504
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:18,681
What happened to you?
You used to be so shy.

505
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:22,717
I just have to.

506
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,760
You don't want to
do that with me.

507
00:46:25,873 --> 00:46:26,954
Why?

508
00:46:27,032 --> 00:46:30,400
Well, because your first kiss
is supposed to be romantic...

509
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:33,722
...and, like, an accident.

510
00:46:34,634 --> 00:46:36,601
It's not like learning to swim.

511
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:40,000
Well, can't we be romantic?

512
00:46:40,074 --> 00:46:43,715
I just... I don't think
of you that way.

513
00:46:48,074 --> 00:46:49,485
Bye.

514
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,842
Jesse!
Come here, boy!

515
00:47:00,115 --> 00:47:02,882
I hope you don't think I'll
be frying that up for supper!

516
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:14,007
We're not really in
much of a rush.

517
00:47:14,077 --> 00:47:15,521
It's OK.

518
00:47:19,717 --> 00:47:22,483
- Have you ever thought of suicide?
- Yeah.

519
00:47:22,557 --> 00:47:25,563
But I'd like to do it myself,
if you don't mind.

520
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:29,039
I'm going to,
when my dad dies.

521
00:47:30,038 --> 00:47:32,041
Is that a definite plan?

522
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,086
Yeah.

523
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:40,885
- Rodney!
- Oh, she's with child.

524
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,411
What's up?
Ooh, watch the baby!

525
00:47:45,481 --> 00:47:47,882
This is... my friend Rose.
Rose, Red Berry.

526
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,123
Hello.
It's nice to meet you.

527
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,168
- Shall we?
- Shall we, indeed.

528
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,963
So I'm totally excited
about seeing this commune.

529
00:47:56,041 --> 00:48:00,331
- How's the baby? - Heavy.
It's going to be a big boy, just like you.

530
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:07,411
- Hey, Gray.
- Picked up your mail on the way in.

531
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:10,327
- That old Ferenzie working you pretty hard?
- Oh, not too bad.

532
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:14,690
When is he going to
make you manager?

533
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:17,686
Er... I don't know.
Maybe this summer.

534
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:20,653
You must have been working there, what?
Five years?

535
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:22,692
Seven.

536
00:48:22,764 --> 00:48:25,369
That's too long to work by the hour.
He's exploiting you.

537
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:27,731
You know more about his
business than he does.

538
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,614
Well, he... owns the place.

539
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:34,969
Thanks for the cheque.

540
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,492
Could have used you here
when it was up and running.

541
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:41,648
Let me know when you're ready
to build something of your own.

542
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:44,891
We'll talk about a loan.

543
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:52,128
Thanks, Jack, but...
I... I wouldn't be able to do that.

544
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:55,847
If you don't like your situation, change it.
If you can't change it, leave it.

545
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:57,896
It's your fucking life, man!

546
00:49:06,887 --> 00:49:08,856
I appreciate it.

547
00:49:11,009 --> 00:49:13,090
So see you on Saturday.
Saturday, was it?

548
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:15,536
- Yeah, thanks.
- All right. Thanks, Gray.

549
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,217
- On.
- Yeah.

550
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,458
Oh, my God!

551
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:37,172
- This is awesome! What is this place?
- It used to be an acid pad.

552
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:39,619
Aha! I bet you guys
do a lot of drugs.

553
00:49:41,972 --> 00:49:46,739
Hey, Rose, I wanna show you something, OK?
Just stand back for a second.

554
00:49:46,813 --> 00:49:48,940
All right, are you ready?

555
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:56,097
Oh, you had the baby.
Fantastic.

556
00:49:59,893 --> 00:50:02,340
Hey, Rose, do you think
I could see your palm?

557
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:08,896
Wow! There is, like, hardly
any lines in your hand.

558
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:12,614
Oh, well. I guess some people just
make themselves up as they go.

559
00:50:13,853 --> 00:50:15,822
I made up my name
when I ran away.

560
00:50:15,894 --> 00:50:18,501
- You did?
- Yeah, it just came to me. I was, like...

561
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:22,295
I was standing outside of my mom's
house and it was snowing

562
00:50:22,376 --> 00:50:24,344
and I just saw this little bush

563
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:27,021
with these hard,
shiny red berries on it

564
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:29,382
just growing out of the snow,
you know?

565
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:32,996
Next time someone asked me what
my name was, I just sort of said

566
00:50:33,137 --> 00:50:37,092
- "Red Berry" and it just kind of stuck.
- Why did you run away?

567
00:50:37,657 --> 00:50:41,547
The important thing is,
you have to forgive everybody.

568
00:50:42,536 --> 00:50:45,746
I forgave everybody after I left,
even my mom and my brother.

569
00:50:46,938 --> 00:50:50,260
Oh, my goodness!
That's perfect.

570
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:57,101
We have a genuine and authentic, I'm sure,
wedding-and-engagement-ring set.

571
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,146
And I think you
shall have them.

572
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:01,786
Thank you.

573
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,338
Red Berry, you don't seem
the marrying type. Sorry.

574
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:06,706
What? I'm definitely
going to get married...

575
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,228
...to a big, fat man

576
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,746
with a tiny wiener
I can barely find.

577
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:17,431
- Not you, Rodney.
- Oh, thank God.

578
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:20,903
He has to be really old,
though, you know?

579
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,550
So do you think that Kathleen
is going to marry your dad?

580
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:27,023
- She wants to.
- Yeah.

581
00:51:27,101 --> 00:51:29,992
Yeah, Mom is a sucker
for a sick man.

582
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:32,630
My father was a diabetic.

583
00:51:33,942 --> 00:51:35,911
What was Thaddius's father like?

584
00:51:35,983 --> 00:51:38,384
He's er...
He was just an idiot.

585
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:42,789
I got a bee sting.

586
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:45,469
Hey, Rosie.

587
00:51:46,222 --> 00:51:49,387
I didn't squash him.
I was just out by the compost.

588
00:51:51,503 --> 00:51:54,507
Rodney,
come here for a second.

589
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:59,230
Let's have a look.
Hold still.

590
00:52:05,985 --> 00:52:08,306
The only person you're
hurting is yourself.

591
00:52:08,693 --> 00:52:12,268
I have a feeling I'll be living off
guilt-burgers for a couple of weeks.

592
00:52:12,367 --> 00:52:16,597
- They're quite thinning. - All I want is
to help you get down to a normal size.

593
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:18,554
Ow! Shit!
Easy.

594
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,715
Bloody fuss.

595
00:52:26,427 --> 00:52:30,148
Why am I always the monster? Huh?
Will you please tell me that?

596
00:52:30,228 --> 00:52:32,628
- It's a question only you can answer.
- Oh, OK!

597
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,916
I give up.
Just eat, eat.

598
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:39,755
Be disgusting.
I'm signing off!

599
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:43,510
What was that?

600
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:50,963
Which God are you praying to?

601
00:54:58,922 --> 00:55:01,003
- Where have you been?
- Up in the dome.

602
00:55:01,722 --> 00:55:03,690
What were you hiding
in there for?

603
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,971
Nothing.

604
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:12,172
Are you OK?

605
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,050
I'm fine.

606
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:22,690
That was quite a fit
that Kathleen had today.

607
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:29,086
Sort of... surprising aspect
to her personality.

608
00:55:29,925 --> 00:55:31,974
OK.

609
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:37,527
Are you sure you're all right?
You're acting a wee bit strangely.

610
00:55:37,606 --> 00:55:39,574
Tired.

611
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,934
Who's the lucky guy?

612
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,416
Well, sleep well.

613
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:08,449
If there's something bothering you,
we can just, you know, talk about it.

614
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:11,291
OK.

615
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:32,938
I'll be back, OK?

616
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,123
Ow.

617
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:15,382
Go ahead.

618
00:57:41,297 --> 00:57:43,619
- Ow...
- Shh!

619
00:58:30,503 --> 00:58:32,471
Thanks.

620
01:00:19,793 --> 01:00:22,682
I'm just hoping that's
your idea of a joke.

621
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:26,523
New chapter.

622
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:29,722
What's that?

623
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,605
You've been ruined by
that fucking scumbag!

624
01:00:32,675 --> 01:00:36,235
- Jack! Jack!
- What?

625
01:00:36,315 --> 01:00:38,317
Oh, my God!

626
01:00:38,394 --> 01:00:41,682
I'll deal with this later on.

627
01:00:41,755 --> 01:00:43,722
Oh, God!
Jack!

628
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:46,523
- What?
- Oh, my God!

629
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:49,523
I just saw a copperhead.

630
01:00:49,596 --> 01:00:52,166
It went behind that
dresser and disappeared.

631
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:54,762
Probably wasn't a copperhead.
Don't get hysterical.

632
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:57,568
I know a fucking copperhead
when I see one!

633
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:02,398
- Oh, shit. Oh, God!
- Right, everybody out of the room.

634
01:01:07,476 --> 01:01:09,445
Did I invite you to stay?

635
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:19,126
Oh, God...

636
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,487
Who were you planning on killing?

637
01:01:36,561 --> 01:01:38,528
I just wanted to scare her.

638
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:45,963
Fuck...

639
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:52,601
What are you hanging around
the door for, faggot?

640
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:20,329
- Hi!
- Hi.

641
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:26,335
- I'm Marty Rance.
- Oh, hi. I'm Kathleen.

642
01:02:26,405 --> 01:02:29,376
- I'm looking for Jack Slavin.
- Oh, he's in the house.

643
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,414
There's a snake in there.

644
01:02:31,485 --> 01:02:33,454
Copperhead.

645
01:02:34,487 --> 01:02:36,137
That's why I'm...

646
01:02:38,806 --> 01:02:41,047
Er...
Well, thanks.

647
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:50,257
Hello.
I'm Marty Rance.

648
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:53,411
I'm developing that land over
on the other side of the field.

649
01:02:53,487 --> 01:02:57,414
I'm just... making the rounds with
the neighbours, trying to get acquainted.

650
01:02:57,489 --> 01:02:59,536
Looking for Jack Slavin.

651
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:02,896
- I'm Jack Slavin.
- Jack Slavin?

652
01:03:03,648 --> 01:03:05,617
Marty Rance.

653
01:03:06,969 --> 01:03:08,936
Great timing, Marty.

654
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:11,860
How's your day so far?

655
01:03:12,929 --> 01:03:15,137
Oh, I'm just spending
the afternoon

656
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,340
kinda making the acquaintance,
you know, just saying hi.

657
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:22,153
- I know that. You just said that.
- So, I did.

658
01:03:23,724 --> 01:03:26,338
How are thing going
down at the site?

659
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:29,778
You know how it is when you try
to build something. You get setbacks.

660
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:32,856
Trespassers, vandalism...
It's hard to keep things tidy.

661
01:03:32,931 --> 01:03:36,038
I agree with you on that one.
Trespassing and vandalism,

662
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,061
- I can't abide by. Never could.
- It's nice to hear you say that.

663
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:43,054
The reason you can't build
on a wetland, see, Marty,

664
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:48,813
is that all that shite that goes
into your sewer system over there

665
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:51,543
will end up running into
the island's water supply.

666
01:03:51,612 --> 01:03:55,744
The grounds too soft, quite apart
from the wildlife that you're poisoning.

667
01:03:55,813 --> 01:03:57,896
That may not be a
wetland any more.

668
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:00,983
How did you work that out?

669
01:04:01,054 --> 01:04:03,864
I'm making an appeal.
We have excellent sewers.

670
01:04:03,934 --> 01:04:07,418
- I'm sure you do.
- Yeah. Er...

671
01:04:09,335 --> 01:04:12,338
You're bribing someone on
the Corps of Engineers, is that it?

672
01:04:13,574 --> 01:04:16,579
I know you've got the Housing Board
in your pocket already.

673
01:04:16,655 --> 01:04:19,262
You know, I really came here
to try and make peace,

674
01:04:19,335 --> 01:04:22,978
to forget about anything either one of
us might have done to upset the other,

675
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:26,697
but by the same token, one of my men
gave a pretty accurate description

676
01:04:26,777 --> 01:04:29,463
of a person who shot up our
work site a little while ago.

677
01:04:29,538 --> 01:04:33,144
- Yeah, that was me.
- Mm! Mm-hm.

678
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:37,539
If you don't tell on me, I don't
tell on you. Is that how it works?

679
01:04:38,617 --> 01:04:42,338
Here's the thing. You're slinging
up houses on a wetland, right?

680
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:46,467
I just want you to...
take down one of them.

681
01:04:47,659 --> 01:04:49,422
Pick a house.
I'll leave it up to you.

682
01:04:49,498 --> 01:04:52,106
- Of course, that's out of the question.
- See you, Marty,

683
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,380
if you don't destroy
one of those houses,

684
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,628
I'm going to have to kill you.

685
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,106
I hope you're kidding,
for your sake.

686
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,907
You know, I tell you,
from top to toe,

687
01:05:11,021 --> 01:05:13,753
I couldn't make any improvements.
You're perfect.

688
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:16,503
You too, my friend.

689
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:27,268
I stuffed down most of the holes
in the house, so we should be all right.

690
01:05:28,222 --> 01:05:30,873
I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke
near the house, please.

691
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:34,867
- Since when? - Since I fucking told you,
you little rodent.

692
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,876
- You're the boss.
- That's right. I am the boss,

693
01:05:42,945 --> 01:05:44,514
and you're moving out.

694
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:46,585
I don't want you sleeping
in my house any more.

695
01:05:46,664 --> 01:05:49,396
You've got one more night...
for your mother's sake.

696
01:05:49,465 --> 01:05:52,469
If it weren't for her,
you'd be out on your arse tonight.

697
01:06:19,068 --> 01:06:20,512
I got you back.

698
01:06:22,307 --> 01:06:24,356
- Got me back for what?
- For Kathleen.

699
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:27,516
Now we're even.

700
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:29,751
That's insane.

701
01:06:30,869 --> 01:06:32,996
You think I'm crazy too, now?

702
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:15,322
We're tripping!

703
01:07:16,393 --> 01:07:19,875
- Who is?
- Thaddius and I. Isn't that perfect?

704
01:07:38,115 --> 01:07:40,925
You all came.
I was hoping.

705
01:07:42,034 --> 01:07:45,085
OK, let's learn a little
American history.

706
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:50,679
This is a genuine imitation acid
pad that was built in 1971.

707
01:07:50,757 --> 01:07:53,442
- This is so cool!
- It was built as a meeting house.

708
01:07:53,516 --> 01:07:55,485
Right.

709
01:07:55,556 --> 01:07:56,764
Sorry.

710
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:00,603
See, there was an
idea that all this stuff,

711
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,684
all these images and sounds
you'll be hearing, with a little luck,

712
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:08,887
would break down the psyche
of the people that were tripping.

713
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:13,963
A person could smash past themselves and
become part of the other people in the room.

714
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:16,484
Am I getting this right, Jack?

715
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,962
I'm just here as an observer.

716
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,688
See, acid was just
a tiny part of it.

717
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:28,565
Jack wanted this commune
to be a pure place...

718
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,284
full of people who
re-invented themselves,

719
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,595
hardworking people who
weren't greedy or petty or selfish,

720
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,560
people who could actually share
property because they weren't

721
01:08:40,595 --> 01:08:44,634
enslaved by the patterns they
inherited from their moms and dads.

722
01:08:46,257 --> 01:08:48,770
It was going to
be total freedom.

723
01:08:48,842 --> 01:08:50,810
Total freedom.

724
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:56,762
See, Jack forgot how to believe
in communal life a long time ago.

725
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,766
How the hell would you know
what I believed in, sweetheart?

726
01:09:04,363 --> 01:09:07,368
But anyway,
seeing as we have guests,

727
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:09,939
I thought we'd have a little...

728
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:15,216
educational/nostalgic
experience.

729
01:10:46,972 --> 01:10:49,658
Give up, boy!
You want to kiss me?

730
01:10:58,615 --> 01:11:00,386
You rich fuck!

731
01:11:00,502 --> 01:11:03,572
You think you can buy yourself an
instant family? Well, you can't buy me!

732
01:11:06,456 --> 01:11:08,265
Oh, my God!

733
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,823
Shit!

734
01:11:17,537 --> 01:11:19,460
Oh, my God!
What happened?

735
01:11:19,537 --> 01:11:21,505
Call an ambulance!

736
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:24,618
Thaddius?
Baby?

737
01:11:27,018 --> 01:11:28,429
Thaddius...

738
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,148
What happened?

739
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:32,462
Rose...

740
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,381
Rose planted...
Rose planted the snake to kill you.

741
01:11:41,618 --> 01:11:43,462
You crazy little bitch!

742
01:11:44,738 --> 01:11:47,630
Get out of here!
Jack!

743
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,141
I was bad.
I'm sorry.

744
01:12:00,421 --> 01:12:02,992
You're not bad.
You're innocent.

745
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:10,625
Innocent people are just er...
dangerous, I guess.

746
01:12:11,742 --> 01:12:14,188
I don't think I've even
really met one before.

747
01:12:15,903 --> 01:12:17,871
You have to get out of here.

748
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:22,188
OK? I'm going to stay with Red Berry.
Please come with us.

749
01:12:32,703 --> 01:12:35,354
I just can't leave him.

750
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:43,475
Well, if I'm not going
to see you again, erm...

751
01:12:45,425 --> 01:12:48,827
...you might as well know
that you're pretty spectacular.

752
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:56,913
Are you getting on or not?

753
01:13:02,827 --> 01:13:04,796
Here we go.
Make secure, guys.

754
01:13:30,429 --> 01:13:32,716
Was that you who put
the snake in the house?

755
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:43,913
Look, I'm about that far away
from my next heart attack,

756
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,391
so, I mean, what the
hell's going on with you?

757
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,712
Have you nothing to
say about all of this?

758
01:14:00,471 --> 01:14:02,440
Your problem is,
you're scared.

759
01:14:03,153 --> 01:14:05,884
If you had any courage,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

760
01:14:06,632 --> 01:14:10,844
- Who gives a shit what other people think?
- What are you talking about?

761
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,481
You know what
I'm talking about.

762
01:14:18,634 --> 01:14:19,965
No.

763
01:14:21,474 --> 01:14:23,876
Don't go off like this,
for Christ's sake, Rosie!

764
01:14:24,914 --> 01:14:26,519
Rosie!

765
01:14:30,595 --> 01:14:31,926
Rose!

766
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:54,769
<i>Somebody broke your wings</i>

767
01:14:56,797 --> 01:15:00,564
<i>Little bird you can't fly</i>

768
01:15:08,798 --> 01:15:12,167
<i>Somebody hurt you bad</i>

769
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:14,765
<i>Feeling down</i>

770
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,932
<i>And the price
you have to pay</i>

771
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,670
<i>You'll be paying,</i>

772
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:34,604
<i>years of your life</i>

773
01:15:36,962 --> 01:15:38,930
Yeah?

774
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:41,368
Both legs and one
arm are broken.

775
01:15:43,882 --> 01:15:45,850
Oh, Christ.

776
01:15:45,922 --> 01:15:48,368
He has to stay in hospital
for a couple of days.

777
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,411
What are you going to do?

778
01:15:51,331 --> 01:15:53,521
I guess I'll have to go back
and forth for a while.

779
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:57,600
My sister will stay with him when
I'm not here. I'll be home tomorrow.

780
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:01,198
Are you all right?

781
01:16:01,381 --> 01:16:03,581
Yeah, I'll be fine.

782
01:16:03,832 --> 01:16:06,412
OK.
Bye.

783
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:18,087
<i>And the price
you have to pay</i>

784
01:16:18,164 --> 01:16:20,167
<i>You'll be paying</i>

785
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:23,454
<i>Years of your life</i>

786
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:29,734
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- What for?

787
01:16:29,806 --> 01:16:31,935
Well, sit down.
Breakfast is ready.

788
01:16:32,686 --> 01:16:34,655
I'm taking good
care of my guy.

789
01:16:36,966 --> 01:16:38,935
She's got to come back
on her own, Jack.

790
01:16:39,006 --> 01:16:40,975
She will.
I know kids.

791
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:44,016
Could you get
an ashtray, please?

792
01:16:46,927 --> 01:16:48,090
Sure.

793
01:16:48,969 --> 01:16:51,893
You just need to let her cool
off for a while, you know?

794
01:17:21,811 --> 01:17:24,417
<i>Somebody gotta help you</i>

795
01:17:26,572 --> 01:17:30,054
<i>I believe I love you so</i>

796
01:17:38,694 --> 01:17:41,140
<i>Somebody's gonna
touch you</i>

797
01:17:42,974 --> 01:17:45,978
<i>I don't believe
I'll let you go</i>

798
01:17:46,054 --> 01:17:48,021
Rosie, open the door!

799
01:18:16,976 --> 01:18:18,944
I'm sorry.

800
01:18:25,257 --> 01:18:27,225
You were right.

801
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:34,743
I was scared.

802
01:18:38,378 --> 01:18:40,426
We should never
have let the world in.

803
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,586
I wish it could just be us,
like it was before.

804
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,065
The happiest man in
the whole wide world.

805
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:02,502
I was the happiest man, Rosie.
I was.

806
01:19:05,902 --> 01:19:07,869
I can't go back.

807
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,266
I can't see her again.

808
01:19:27,104 --> 01:19:31,074
- Where are you going? - I'm going
to go try and make a transaction.

809
01:20:03,908 --> 01:20:05,875
Can you move out for that?

810
01:20:13,868 --> 01:20:15,837
What about fifteen?

811
01:20:19,349 --> 01:20:21,317
Twenty.

812
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,478
Tomorrow night, OK?

813
01:20:55,471 --> 01:20:57,439
Thank you.

814
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:36,918
She's leaving by
tomorrow night.

815
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:38,963
Really?

816
01:21:42,877 --> 01:21:46,518
We'll have to stay in this
godforsaken place for tonight.

817
01:21:48,197 --> 01:21:51,918
- Take off your shoes.
- You've got to be kidding me.

818
01:21:51,997 --> 01:21:53,726
Off.

819
01:22:01,238 --> 01:22:03,207
Yeah.

820
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:08,958
- Lie down.
- I don't want to lie down in here.

821
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:12,362
This place gives
me the creeps.

822
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:15,046
I like it.
It's going to be fun.

823
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:17,043
Remember how we
used to camp out?

824
01:22:17,801 --> 01:22:19,326
Yeah, but...

825
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,006
...not in housing developments.

826
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,766
What are you
feeding me here?

827
01:22:30,961 --> 01:22:32,725
Beans.

828
01:23:10,006 --> 01:23:12,484
I want you to
promise me something.

829
01:23:14,525 --> 01:23:16,573
That thing that you
said a while back,

830
01:23:20,405 --> 01:23:22,375
that when I die,
you were going to die,

831
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:26,534
I want you to
take that back.

832
01:23:31,528 --> 01:23:33,496
Take it back.

833
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,336
I promise I'll try.

834
01:23:52,055 --> 01:23:53,989
Little flower.

835
01:23:58,382 --> 01:24:00,295
I'm so happy.

836
01:24:33,052 --> 01:24:35,216
Oh, God.
Oh, God, forgive me.

837
01:24:40,694 --> 01:24:42,662
No, no...

838
01:24:42,734 --> 01:24:44,623
Oh, God...

839
01:24:48,494 --> 01:24:50,462
Oh, my God...

840
01:26:34,385 --> 01:26:37,787
We've got a whole day to kill.
We may as well go to the mainland.

841
01:26:47,786 --> 01:26:50,154
Why do people want
everything to be so ugly?

842
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:56,275
I was thinking of paying Marty Rance
a visit. You can ask him yourself.

843
01:27:04,029 --> 01:27:05,996
Got it.

844
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:26,679
That's it.

845
01:27:53,032 --> 01:27:54,956
Hello.

846
01:27:55,672 --> 01:27:57,640
Where did you say
that you lived?

847
01:27:57,712 --> 01:28:00,921
We're on the south side
of Marsh island, by the tip.

848
01:28:00,993 --> 01:28:04,600
- I didn't think that was developed yet.
- There's an old commune out there.

849
01:28:04,673 --> 01:28:06,278
We live on that.

850
01:28:07,594 --> 01:28:09,643
Oh, yes.

851
01:28:09,715 --> 01:28:12,479
- Jack Slavin. Of course.
- Jack Slavin!

852
01:28:13,435 --> 01:28:16,199
- Marty, man!
- This is a surprise.

853
01:28:16,274 --> 01:28:18,881
I'm making the rounds,
getting to know my neighbours.

854
01:28:18,954 --> 01:28:21,117
I'm glad you came by.

855
01:28:21,194 --> 01:28:23,323
This is Rose.

856
01:28:23,395 --> 01:28:25,603
- Rose.
- Would you like some coffee?

857
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:27,757
Er...
I'll take some coffee, sure.

858
01:28:27,836 --> 01:28:29,485
- Rose?
- No, thanks.

859
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:33,845
Well, nice!

860
01:28:35,157 --> 01:28:37,319
How's that appeal coming?

861
01:28:37,398 --> 01:28:40,685
As a matter of fact,
I was going to give you a call.

862
01:28:40,756 --> 01:28:42,759
That isn't a wetland any more.

863
01:28:43,756 --> 01:28:46,761
As a matter of fact, that isn't
a house any more. Mind if I er...

864
01:28:46,837 --> 01:28:50,159
- What do you mean?
- Go see for yourself.

865
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:53,444
I'm just going to build it again,
you know.

866
01:28:53,519 --> 01:28:57,364
If you build it again,
I'll have to knock it down again.

867
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:01,081
- I don't want to have to call the police.
- Call them. I don't mind.

868
01:29:02,118 --> 01:29:04,929
Listen, Jack...

869
01:29:04,998 --> 01:29:07,445
I realise you and I have
had our differences,

870
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,806
but by the same token,
you can't stop progress.

871
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,167
You can't stop the
future from happening.

872
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,608
People have a right to build.

873
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,086
Laws change all the time
pertaining to the environment,

874
01:29:18,161 --> 01:29:19,925
as the community's
needs change.

875
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:22,528
I believe in putting people first.

876
01:29:22,601 --> 01:29:24,569
That's just my personal belief.

877
01:29:24,641 --> 01:29:27,725
But I want you to feel
comfortable with the situation,

878
01:29:27,801 --> 01:29:30,088
so you need to tell me
how that can happen.

879
01:29:30,162 --> 01:29:32,210
What the hell do you mean,
"comfortable"?

880
01:29:32,282 --> 01:29:35,844
Well, it occurs to me that
I haven't ever expressed...

881
01:29:35,922 --> 01:29:38,005
my interest in
your land to you.

882
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:39,493
There you are.

883
01:29:40,483 --> 01:29:42,407
You didn't have to.

884
01:29:42,484 --> 01:29:46,045
I want you to know that if the day
comes where you want to move on...

885
01:29:46,123 --> 01:29:52,006
to, say, a less-developed
part of the world...

886
01:29:53,604 --> 01:29:57,814
We all have our dreams
of how we want to retire.

887
01:29:57,885 --> 01:30:00,934
Anyhow, if that day
ever comes, call me.

888
01:30:02,045 --> 01:30:05,448
I think you'd be surprised at how
much your place is worth now.

889
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:07,493
When did you purchase
the property?

890
01:30:09,126 --> 01:30:10,697
1967.

891
01:30:10,766 --> 01:30:13,167
Oh, you're looking...

892
01:30:13,246 --> 01:30:15,613
I'd guesstimate
you're looking at...

893
01:30:15,685 --> 01:30:18,657
a 200% profit on
your investment,

894
01:30:18,726 --> 01:30:21,094
and that's conservative.

895
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:23,135
- Is that so?
- Think about it.

896
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:30,015
You know,
I have to say, er...

897
01:30:31,729 --> 01:30:33,730
...with our history, Jack,

898
01:30:33,809 --> 01:30:35,775
I would never
have dreamed...

899
01:30:36,528 --> 01:30:38,975
that you'd end up at
my breakfast table.

900
01:30:42,889 --> 01:30:43,890
Why?

901
01:30:43,969 --> 01:30:46,016
Mm?

902
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:49,572
We're not so... We're not so very different
from each other, you and me.

903
01:30:49,649 --> 01:30:52,016
Well, I gotta hear this.

904
01:30:55,171 --> 01:30:58,855
Well, we both do whatever
the fuck we want. Right?

905
01:31:00,090 --> 01:31:05,654
And we... We both turn a blind
eye to the consequences, us.

906
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:07,699
That's the way
of the future, right?

907
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:10,457
I'm a businessman.
I'm not... I'm not a...

908
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:12,738
I know what you are.

909
01:31:21,891 --> 01:31:25,783
I'm just seeing it now for
the first time, right now.

910
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:28,461
This minute, I'm seeing it.

911
01:31:30,054 --> 01:31:32,101
You have a vision, too.
Right?

912
01:31:33,094 --> 01:31:35,061
My land is like a blot...

913
01:31:36,134 --> 01:31:38,103
...on your perfect universe.

914
01:31:39,654 --> 01:31:44,344
When you see all these...
these box houses,

915
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:46,542
these imitation colonial homes,

916
01:31:46,614 --> 01:31:49,663
you get... you get
a feeling of what?

917
01:31:49,734 --> 01:31:53,217
Of everything being in its place,
of accomplishment.

918
01:31:53,296 --> 01:31:55,617
Right, well,
when I see them...

919
01:31:55,695 --> 01:32:00,863
When I see them, I want to punch a hole
through the walls and set fire to them.

920
01:32:02,216 --> 01:32:05,108
So...
So...

921
01:32:07,578 --> 01:32:10,739
...the main difference between
you and me, really, is that...

922
01:32:10,817 --> 01:32:15,028
is that you, you...
love those little houses,

923
01:32:16,217 --> 01:32:18,948
and I hate those
little houses and...

924
01:32:21,738 --> 01:32:25,585
...it all boils down to...
to taste.

925
01:32:30,939 --> 01:32:36,787
And I ruined her out of
some kind of snobbery.

926
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:42,344
- Ruined whom?
- Dad, let's go home.

927
01:32:43,461 --> 01:32:46,112
It was about something different.
I...

928
01:32:50,061 --> 01:32:52,905
I know it was, but I can't remember,
God forgive me.

929
01:32:52,981 --> 01:32:55,302
- I can't remember.
- I remember.

930
01:32:56,662 --> 01:32:59,824
Do you need a doctor?
Does he need a doctor?

931
01:33:00,582 --> 01:33:01,947
Oh, God...

932
01:33:04,582 --> 01:33:07,109
All right, Marty, you win.
I'll sell.

933
01:33:07,372 --> 01:33:11,671
- It's my land still. I want to sell it.
- Great, but... just think about it.

934
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:15,505
- I'll come by tomorrow. - I don't need to.
I just want to get rid of it.

935
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:18,234
- No! - We'll talk about it in
the morning. I'll come by...

936
01:33:18,304 --> 01:33:19,793
No!

937
01:33:19,863 --> 01:33:22,707
Write me out a fucking check,
you imbecile.

938
01:33:22,783 --> 01:33:25,788
- Let me drive you. Let me help you.
- Please, don't. Don't.

939
01:33:28,064 --> 01:33:30,033
Turns out Marty's
a decent guy.

940
01:33:31,985 --> 01:33:33,953
Didn't want to take
advantage of me.

941
01:33:38,186 --> 01:33:40,154
What are you doing?

942
01:33:40,907 --> 01:33:42,873
You know what I'm doing.

943
01:33:45,627 --> 01:33:48,358
You'll be free of this whole...
thing.

944
01:33:50,506 --> 01:33:53,033
Get an education,
you know, try and...

945
01:33:53,108 --> 01:33:55,270
You've got to make
a life for yourself.

946
01:33:55,347 --> 01:33:57,315
I have a life!

947
01:33:58,908 --> 01:34:01,752
I mean, you can't just
give up like this.

948
01:34:01,828 --> 01:34:05,037
Sweetheart, I gave up a long time ago.
I just didn't realise it.

949
01:34:07,868 --> 01:34:11,510
I mean, how can he tell you,
"You can't stop the future from happening"?

950
01:34:11,588 --> 01:34:14,957
- Who made him the future?
- It's not his fault. It's just...

951
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:20,076
That's...
That's the way things are. He's...

952
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:29,358
Everything's for sale.

953
01:34:30,430 --> 01:34:31,636
Everything.

954
01:34:31,711 --> 01:34:33,679
Please don't sell it.

955
01:34:38,311 --> 01:34:40,076
Please don't give up.

956
01:34:40,992 --> 01:34:43,644
<i>Your daddy he's an outlaw</i>

957
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:46,154
<i>And a wanderer by trade</i>

958
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:50,524
<i>He'll teach you how
to pick and choose</i>

959
01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:52,880
<i>And how to throw the blade</i>

960
01:34:54,033 --> 01:34:57,243
<i>He oversees his kingdom</i>

961
01:34:57,314 --> 01:34:59,840
<i>So no stranger does intrude</i>

962
01:35:00,753 --> 01:35:03,597
<i>His voice it trembles
as he calls out</i>

963
01:35:03,673 --> 01:35:06,359
<i>For another plate of food</i>

964
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:11,159
<i>One more cup of
coffee for the road</i>

965
01:35:13,756 --> 01:35:17,555
<i>One more cup of
coffee 'fore I go</i>

966
01:35:19,155 --> 01:35:21,443
<i>To the valley below</i>

967
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:36,319
I'm chilly.

968
01:35:39,077 --> 01:35:40,728
Thanks.

969
01:36:20,601 --> 01:36:23,447
I... I think I'll just
go up for a while.

970
01:36:23,523 --> 01:36:25,489
I'll be up in a minute, OK?

971
01:36:42,484 --> 01:36:44,452
Thanks, sweetheart.

972
01:36:52,685 --> 01:36:54,653
That's better.

973
01:36:57,765 --> 01:36:59,734
We've got work to do.

974
01:37:57,011 --> 01:37:58,979
Forgive me.

975
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:04,939
Go to sleep.

976
01:39:13,377 --> 01:39:15,346
Dad?

977
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:20,269
Dad?

978
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:55,280
<i>Looking back,</i>

979
01:39:55,538 --> 01:39:59,037
