00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,550
GIRL: There used to be horses in that barn

3
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,995
At least that's what my grandfather says

4
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,918
We're probably the only horse farm
in Lexington Kentucky

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,353
that doesn 't have one horse

6
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,436
- Not one
- (Thunder rumbles)

7
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,236
MAN: It might rain.

8
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,109
Pat said it'd be a good day
for me to er... come down to the diner.

9
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,679
M A N Yeah, we

10
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,672
WOMAN: Just be breakfast and lunch
three days a week

11
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,469
MAN: If you 're working at the diner
she comes home from school to nobody or?

12
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,472
Well, Pop lives right next door.

13
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,992
I know you two don 't talk much,
but he and Cale get along real well.

14
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,636
- And er...
- And er... what?

15
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,311
You've been promising her for months
you would take her to work with you.

16
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,392
And I will. I will, Lil. But not today, honey.
I got a big race.

17
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,913
WOMAN: What do I tell her?

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,151
MAN: Tell her I was running late
and I didn 't have time to wait

19
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,113
- You tell her.
- Honey, I'm going to work.

20
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,432
(Engine starts)

21
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,876
All right, get in. I don 't wanna be late.

22
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,312
There you go

23
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,116
(Thunder rumbles)

24
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,438
- 58 and one.
- (Muffled reply from walkie-talkie)

25
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,076
All right, send Sonya. Don 't let her out.
I just wanna... I just wanna watch her action.

26
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,996
(Horse whinnies in distance)

27
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,357
I like him.

28
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,832
Her.

29
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,758
I like her, too.

30
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,156
(Chatter)

31
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,194
MAN: Can I get a bucket of multigrain
in stall number three please?

32
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,955
- Good morning sir
- Good morning.

33
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,951
Balon, you remember Cale?

34
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,076
Sure. She doesn 't come around any more.

35
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,720
Wow, honey, you've gotten so big.

36
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,916
Senorita, buenos dias.

37
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,831
Eddie let's take a look at Goliath 's Boy

38
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,956
- That means good morning.
- Good morning.

39
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,076
He's got legs like steel. Take him in.

40
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,351
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,070
BALON: What have you got there? Candy?
Hey, Sonya. There you go, Sonya.

42
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,630
Ooh, yeah. That's Sonya. She likes candy.

43
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,040
- Sonya likes Twizzlers.
- Yeah?

44
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,429
Well... who's this?

45
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,559
Got a new jockey?

46
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,949
Manny, this is my daughter Cale.

47
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,110
Oh, hey.

48
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,988
Manolin Vallarta.
The greatest jockey in the world.

49
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,958
- Fattest jockey in the world.
- Fat?

50
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,235
Chacho, I'm too tall to race.

51
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,278
Look at you. Look at these clothes.
This is a barn, not a disco.

52
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,432
- Cambiate la ropa!
- Ooh!

53
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,029
He likes the way I dress. (Chuckles)

54
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,190
Now, yo u soo yo u r daddy?

55
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,033
You see how he's feeling the legs?
You see that?

56
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,072
Yeah well we just wanna make sure
the horse is sound and healthy

57
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,358
Your daddy always say you listen to a horse,
he'll tell you how he feels.

58
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,470
- OK. Thanks, Mark.
- (Horse whinnies)

59
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,550
(Tannoy announcement in background)

60
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,910
I don 't know, boy. I'll tell you, I don 't know.

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,470
The leg feels fine,
but she keeps... she keeps jumping at that.

62
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,312
She wants to get back in her stall.

63
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,595
Vamos, Sonya. Vamos.

64
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,955
Venga, venga!

65
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,792
She gonna race today?

66
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,030
Of course she's gonna race today.

67
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,473
Hello, Mr Palmer.

68
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,109
Nice to see you.
Wasn 't sure you were coming today.

69
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,077
I er... I don 't believe I've ever met...

70
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,277
Prince Tariq Abal.

71
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,195
PALMER:
Well, well, Sonya is just as pretty as she is fast.

72
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,068
Sir, I'll meet you at our box
after I talk with my staff.

73
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,108
- What's the story here?
- She's acting funny.

74
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,431
Some heat in that right front this morning

75
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,670
llm not sure if she wants to run today

76
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,196
I don 't feel any heat in that leg.
What did the vet say?

77
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,794
The vet and paddock judge
both passed her as fine, but...

78
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,836
Well, good. That's all that matters.

79
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,151
Sir, I'm just saying
I don 't... I don 't think she should go today.

80
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,357
Prince Tariq flew his personal Tr3Tr
8,000 miles...

81
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,396
for what?

82
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,790
I don 't know,
to win the Jansen Handicap, I guess.

83
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,518
To beat his brother Sadir.

84
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,594
Tariq only flies in if he can see one of his horses
run against one of his brother's horses.

85
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,468
We're messing with a champion two-year-old
who's won her first two races this year.

86
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,629
This'll make three.

87
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,154
She's a little star, no doubt about it.

88
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,800
She's a lot more than a star, Everett.

89
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,350
I'm listening to the horse.
She's telling me she could do better with rest.

90
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,158
You'd do better by listening to me.

91
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,037
Look, she's a nice horse.

92
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,715
But I've spent millions
developing a stable of horses for Prince Tariq

93
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,119
so he can beat his brother.

94
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,636
Now, I know you got big plans...
but just do your job.

95
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,238
OK?

96
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,357
Daily maintenance,
overseeing the workouts - your job.

97
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,908
Picking her races - my job

98
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,477
Are we good?

99
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,913
- Yeah, we're good.
- Good.

100
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,956
She's morning-line favourite.

101
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,438
(Claps) Let's go.

102
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,239
Have one of the Mexicans walk her round
to settle her.

103
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,836
OK, Mark.

104
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,438
You heard the boss. Let's go.

105
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,476
(Fanfare in background)

106
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,635
TANNO Y: Now the big race
the Jansen Handicap starting on the track

107
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,030
No 2 Ocean Blend
carrying two pounds over weight

108
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,556
You own a horse, sweetie?
This is just for owners.

109
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,039
Cale

110
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,951
Cale.

111
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,110
Huh.

112
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,156
BALON: Hey-hey.
- Hey.

113
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,390
See her, honey? Look at that. No.5, right there.

114
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,835
- That's our girl
CALE: Think she'll win?

115
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,117
- I got $10 that says she's gonna win.
- (Laughs)

116
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,076
TANNO Y: From the Wishman Stables
here's Rapid Cat

117
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,196

119
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,032
Here we go, baby.

(Race bell rings)

122
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,030
TANNO Y: And away they go!

123
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,556
Easy. Nice and easy now.

124
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,792
(Shouts of encouragement)

125
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,270
MANNY:
She's fourth Come on sweetheart

126
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,918

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,074
Bring it home, baby.

130
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,631
Come on, Sonya.

131
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,835

Oh, Manny.

137
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,553
- We gotta put her down, Ben.
- It's OK. I got it here.

138
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,874
Cannon bone.

139
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,997
- Look llm sorry Ben We gotta put her down
- She all right?

140
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,512
- Whoa!
- Hey, easy, girl. Easy.

141
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,272
Come on, it's OK.

142
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,716
Not here. Not here.
Take her back to her stall, but not here.

143
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,556

(Heavy rain)

146
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,550
- Ben, I can 't put her down until you sign this.
- I want some X-rays taken.

147
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,438
Cale, come here. Come on.
Stay out of the way.

148
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,158
What's the point? She's finished.

149
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,798
B N do not be e ve th s

150
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,154
I told him.

151
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,755
- What? What'd you tell me?
- I warned you she wasn 't right.

152
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,115
- You put the saddle on her.
- What? Wait a minute!

153
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,919
Lunderstand, it's sad when these things happen.

154
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,468
- Sad?
- Yes, sad. This is an athlete.

155
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,996
Well, then, you just knowingly killed
a $ Tr50,000 athlete.

156
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,832
- We need to make a move here.
- Tell me

157
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,353
It's her cannon bone

158
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,718
You pushed her. She'd have run
in the Breeders' Cup. She was special.

You don 't care about anybody, do you?
Horses or people.

161
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,876
Well, in fact, I do, Ben. That's why I'm giving you
the opportunity to find a new job.

162
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,474
- You firing me?
- And take your Mexicans with you.

163
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,719
They're men, Palmer. They got names.

164
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,358
(Sonya whinnies)

165
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,637
- You owe me money.
- You'll get your cheque, first of the month.

166
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,950
You pay me now
9000 for the last three months

167
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,759
Here's six.

168
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,558
Six. Take it or leave it.

169
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,995
I'll leave it. We agreed on nine.
You're three short.

170
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,957
- Wait for a cheque.
- I'm not waiting!

171
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,110
For God's sake, please put that horse down!

172
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,792
Dan, Dan, Dan, wait.

173
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,959
I'll take the 6,000 and the horse.

174
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,669
$6,000 and a dead horse
and I never have to hear from you again?

175
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,512
- That's right.
- Take the money

176
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,715
(Sonya whinnies)

177
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,030
Sedate her, Dan.
Put her down heavy for the night.

178
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,713
It'll cost you 400 just to dispose of her body.

179
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,199
Balon hook up a trailer

180
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,113
- You got a hard head, like your old man.
- Cale, go to the truck.

181
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,919
Living in that horse farm with no horses.

182
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,275
Balon, just...
Manny, take her out to the truck.

183
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,672
Delusional. It's a disease with you Cranes.
Get out before it rubs off on you.

184
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,636
BEN: Manny?
- Yeah?

185
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,156
Go get the old man.
Tell him it's an emergency.

186
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,314
Hi, Balon. I need the heavy winch,
the tow and easy sling to get her in this stall.

187
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,631
- OK where's that?
- It 's in the back stall there

188
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,029
- Oh OK I got it
LIL: Where have you been?

189
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,350
God, I've been so worried. Honey.

190
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,510
- What's going on?
- I had a horse go down.

191
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,555
Oh, my God.

192
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,995
- Anything else, boss?
- Give Balon a hand, will you?

193
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,435
- Manny?
- Hello.

194
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,479
MAN: What can you geniuses
be calling an emergency at night in the rain?

195
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,718
This about a horse?

196
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,469
Good night.

197
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,310
Inever ask you for anything.

198
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,868
That's right.
I haven 't heard from you in months.

199
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,837
That's why your business is so great.

200
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,037
I got a filly in there
with a broken cannon bone, Pop.

201
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,235
Thoroughbred?

202
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,868
Raco r?

203
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,793
Put her down.

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,719
You had a horse
with a shattered cannon bone once.

205
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,475
You harnessed it up somehow,
the leg healed and that horse was fine.

206
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,394
That was a long time ago.
You were just a little boy, Benjamin.

207
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,159
But I remember it. It worked.

208
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,519
He was an old lead pony.

209
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,230
Healed just enough to walk around for
a few more years before I finally put him down.

210
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,590
Which is what you'd do
if you had any sense at all.

211
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,598
Let's get her in the stall.

212
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,551
LIL: Cale.
- I'm going to need to help them, Mom.

213
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,315
Cale, I'm gonna spend the night with her.
You go on inside with Mom.

214
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,432
BEN: All right.
BALON: Right up there?

215
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,238
- Yeah.
- Right, Manny?

216
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,595
BEN: Can you get up to the big winch Manny?

217
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,035
Let's hook it up. Come on.

218
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,752
(Exhales)

219
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,629
- Was it a hard fall?
- Hard enough.

220
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,598
She didn 't get bumped or anything.
She... she just went down.

221
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,468
That's the one from the track
And my X -rays confirm it

222
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,915
It's a spiral fracture of the cannon bone.

223
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,639
BEN: But it is nondisplaced
- She'll never race again?

224
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,593
No, honey.

225
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,797
- But she might walk again
- There's a chance. It's up to her.

226
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,279
Try and keep her calm.

227
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,588
Stable rest.

228
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,750
That cast I put on her should hold.

229
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,353
We'll go really easy on her, Doc.

230
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,158
- Let's stay close on this
- You got it

231
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,350
All right, let's pull all the harness stuff.

232
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,795
Put the straps and the pulley in the tack room.

233
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,714
Ben, when Mr Palmer fired you,
us yesterday, well...

234
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,109
We all don 't have no jobs.

235
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,156
I'm sorry, guys. I forgot. Here.

236
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,036
There's a thousand each.

237
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,396
What's wrong?

238
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,630
Well, we train racehorses, right?

239
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,393
And... she's not going to race no more, so...

240
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,631
So why hang around to help you
get a broken racehorse to walk?

241
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,994
(Manny and Balon whisper)

242
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,036
You know who this horse was sired by?

243
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,229
Dreamcatcher.

244
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,037
You know who that was?

245
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,434
Pop, w h o was Droa m catc h o r?

246
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,396
Won the Dubai World Cup in '96.

247
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,279
Won seven of 11 graded stakes
and over $3,000,000.

248
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,158
We get her healed enough
to breed her to a decent stud,

249
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,879
sell that yearling for... I don 't know, maybe...

250
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,431
If it's a colt with good confirmation, maybe 300.

251
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,351
B N $300,000

252
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,477
You two be interested in a piece of $300,000?

253
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,270
(Bot h c h u ck o)
M A N N Y Yeah

254
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,999
How about it, Pop?

255
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,036
BALON: OK. Looks good to me.

256
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,876
We're all done.

257
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,318
BEN: Take it up.

258
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,356
Got it?

259
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,790
(Whinnies)

260
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,749
Good girl.

261
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,796
Good Sonya

262
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,716
Easy. Easy, girl. Easy, girl.

263
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,549
(Sonya whinnies)

264
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,392
One, two, three...

265
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,636
CHILD: Bye, Cale.
- Bye.

266
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,635
One, two, three.

267
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,831
OK, that's good. That's good.

268
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,036
She's doing great

269
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,839
- She OK?
- She's OK

270
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,352
(Whinnies)

271
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,552
- Whoa, whoa. You all right?
- Fine.

272
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,756
- You OK? She kick you?
BALON: Easy.

273
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,432
Come on. It's OK, honey.

274
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,637
- How is she?
- She's OK.

275
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,632
What were you doing?
She's... she's not a pet, Cale.

276
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,554
She's what I do for work now
so you 'll have to leave her be all right?

277
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,911
Llm sorry

278
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,915
- You sure you're all right?
- Fine.

279
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,717
(Slurps)

280
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,236
(Chomps)

281
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,476
(Sonya snorts)

282
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,868
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

283
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,389
You make all that money
and eat as much pie as you want?

284
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,040
(Chuckles) Yeah, I can 't find a better job.

285
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,075
Manny's gonna take me
to watch him ride a racehorse.

286
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,151
And tonight I'm gonna muck out Sonya's stall.

287
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,471
- I'm thinking about painting it.
- Nice to have a horse, huh?

288
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,797
Especially after Dad said,

289
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,509
"There will never be another horse
in this farm as long as I live."

290
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,393
Did Pop tell you that?

291
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,832
Don 't you listen to everything Pop says.
There's two sides to every story.

292
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,798
Pop said Dad's the best horseman.
Says he has a gift.

293
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,436
Well, that's true.

294
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,356
We all know that's true.

295
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,036
- Hey.
- Hello.

296
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,076
Whoa, Zephyr. Whoa, boy.

297
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,632
Thanks, Mike.

298
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,074
- What'd you think about that?
- That was fast.

299
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,116
- Nice boots.
- Ah, Thank you.

300
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,471
Oxo rc so a co u p o o f h o rsos fo r a fow ow h o rs

301
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,436
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

302
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,276
You ever ride in races?

303
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,596
Couple of times I did.

304
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,676
- But no more.
- Why?

305
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,556
Er...

306
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,471
I have bad dreams.

307
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,790
Three years ago I got my first real race.

308
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,189
I ran fifth.

309
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,236
What was the name of the horse?

310
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,269
Downtown Swing.

311
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,789
- It was amazing.
- Did you ever ride him again?

312
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,668
Yeah. In our second race,
I was flying into that first turn.

313
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,752
And then I looked under my arm
to see if I was clear on the rail.

314
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,559
When I looked back up,
there was a horse swerving into me.

315
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,791
My left foot came out of the iron,
I fell to the ground...

316
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,118
and I got run over by three horses.

317
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,518
Broke both shoulders, sternum...

318
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,959
four ribs

319
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,792
punctured a lung.

320
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,152
You never raced again.

321
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,477
(Sighs heavily)

322
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,791
You know, at night, when I fall asleep...

323
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,148
...I dream I'm in a big race on a very fast horse.

324
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,794
And I look to my left foot,
it slips out of the iron and I begin to fall.

325
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,758
But... before I hit the ground, I wake up.

326
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,832
- But you still exercise racehorses.
- Yeah.

327
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,918
Just...

328
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,788
It's just me and the horse alone on the track,

329
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,909
free.

330
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
No-one to bother us. It's much better that way.

331
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,958
- I'm sorry about your nightmares, Manny.
- It 's OK

332
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,235
It's God's way of telling me no more racing.

333
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,476
(Slurping)

334
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,796
Good night.

335
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,631
From Mom.

336
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,870
I'm good, honey. Just put it down there.

337
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,558
Cale?

338
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,995
Will you grab that roll of wire
underneath the fence?

339
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,911
Yeah.

340
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,956
You can just hang on to it there.

341
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,390
Pop said this farm used to be beautiful.

342
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,876
This farm was beautiful.

343
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,598
200 acres. One of the nicest in Versailles.

344
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,676
- See all that over there?
- Yeah.

345
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,796
Well, that was ours.

346
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,310
Pop: S ow h od so m o roa y h co raco m a ros

347
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,559
Big, beautiful female horses.

348
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,278
Waveland, Blue Jezebel and Miss Moffett.

349
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,189
That's right.

350
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,675
Pop said he built those stalls
and filled them with horses.

351
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
Yeah, he made a good living selling yearlings.

352
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,994
But you wanted to keep the yearlings
and race 'em, right?

353
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,189
Well, it got kind of hard,

354
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,432
watching horses born on this farm
go on to win big races for somebody else.

355
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,354
So you got Pop to keep some yearlings
so you could train 'em, race 'em.

356
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,908
You don 't just keep 'em, Cale. They're not free.

357
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,756
I'm going to brush down Sonya.

358
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,154
Cale Crane.

359
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,149
Yes, ma'am?

360
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,038
- Working on your creative writing assignment?
- Yes, ma'am.

361
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,513
What's your story about?

362
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,436
It's about a king...

363
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,071
...and his castle...

364
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,310
and a magic horse.

365
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,988
Bye.

366
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,955
She can stand on it.
Not for long. But she can stand on it.

367
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,558
I'll run a couple more tests but I don 't see
any reason she can 't breed. She looks good.

368
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,517
You helped her, Cale.

369
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,192
She's gonna have a baby. Yeah!

370
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,191
I'll see you Friday.

371
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,716
Well, I'm gonna call in a favour.

372
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,512
(Whispers) Go, Cale.

373
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,079
- Go.
- Go.

374
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,875
So where are you going?

375
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,916
I'm gonna go see an old friend.

376
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,199
About a stud for Sonya?

377
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,355
Yeah.

378
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,078
About a stud.

379
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,119
You wanna come?

380
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,514
Yeah. I'll come.

381
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,952
Fusaichi Pegasus.

382
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,270
He won the Kentucky Derby.

383
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,271
Do you see him? That's Fusaichi.

384
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,193
Giant's Causeway.

385
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,788
Johannesburg.

386
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,713
He won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile.

387
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,756
You learn all that from Pop, too?

388
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,678
He's a beautiful horse.

389
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,954
Hey, Bill.

390
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,598
It's good to see you.

391
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,829
Good to see you.

392
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,558
- This is my daughter Cale.
CALE: Hi

393
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,313
- Nice to meet you, Cale.
- Nice to meet you, too.

394
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,918
So, you call two months ago telling me you got
a race mare needs to be covered, then nothing.

395
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,471
Well, it's been a pretty long road with that filly,
Bill, but she's ready to go now.

396
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,997
- So, you still going to be able to help me out?
- Right over here.

397
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,355
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready for the world's greatest stud?

398
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,396
Come on, Todd. Bring him on out.

399
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,468
That's not...

400
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,148
- What is that?
BILL: This here is Thunder Pants

401
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,038
Honey, Thunder Pants is a teaser pony.

402
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,595
He's gonna help Sonya get ready
to go into the breeding shed with a stallion.

403
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,752
- Thanks, Bill.
- Hey, Cale,

404
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,513
want to meet the stallion I picked for you?

405
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,109
Cale, meet Grand Slam.

406
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,316
Grand Slam?

407
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,638
Unbelievable.

408
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,115
So, what do you think?

409
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,192
Well,

410
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,236
I think it's Grand Slam.

411
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,637
Everyone at Ashford
has a lot of respect for your family.

412
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,076
I explained your situation
and they want to do you the favour of a lifetime.

413
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,718
I just... I don 't know what to say.

414
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,553
- Say you'll have the filly here first week in May.
- You got it.

415
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,232
That week's the only shot you get.

416
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,753
He's booked till next year.

417
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,673
And you got to send me half of the 15,000
by the end of the week.

418
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,039
That's er... 15,000?

419
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,589
Well, Grand Slam's
normal stud fees are 200,000.

420
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,477
- We're waiving that.
- Yeah, I know.

421
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,790
The 15 doesn 't even cover
our costs in insurance.

422
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,917
No no Bill it 's an amazing offer I just didn 't

423
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,596
I'm wondering, though,
if maybe I couldn 't give you a share in the foal,

424
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,079
maypo to covo r a t h o oxpo h sos,

425
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,718
whatever they are

426
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,473
BILL: We just don 't do that

427
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,073
Not in a case like this

428
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,112
Are you saying you want to call it off?

429
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,679
No, Bill, I just...

430
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,315
Bill, I don 't have the money.

431
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,039
I am sorry, Ben.

432
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,839
- I didn 't fully know your situation
- That's OK Bill

433
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,876
Listen, I... I really appreciate the try.

434
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,109
I'm gonna call. All right? Thanks.

435
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,156
Let's go, honey.

436
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,914
POP: Llve never seen Grand Slam up close

437
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,230
CALE: He's got muscles everywhere

438
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,639
POP: What'd he say?

439
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,188
He's a horse.

440
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,313
I know. What'd he say?

441
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,032
"I am a great champion."

442
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,676
"When I ran, the ground shook.

443
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,320
The sky opened and mere mortals parted."

444
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,755
"The way to victory.

445
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,990
And I met my owner in the winner's circle."

446
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,878
"Where he put a blanket of flowers on my back."

447
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,315
You remembered that?

448
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,868
Sport of kings, you know that?

449
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,554
They call horse racing the sport of kings.

450
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,715
- So when you gonna take me to the races?
- I don 't go any more.

451
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,438
Haven 't been in years.

452
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,517
So I can take the Racing Form
and The Blood-Horse, right?

453
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,115
Your dad doesn 't want me
teaching you about horses.

454
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,474
So I should leave 'em?

455
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,596
You should stuff 'em under your shirt.

456
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,795
OK.

457
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,595
Cale, in that cabinet above the sink...

458
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,228
Yeah.

459
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,958
Is there a coffee can?

460
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,439
Mm-hm.

461
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,909
- Bring it to your dad, would you?
- Sure

462
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,228
- Good night.
- Good night

463
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,595
- Pop wanted me to give this to you.
- Thanks, hon.

464
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,513
- I'm gonna eat my dessert in the barn.
- All righty.

465
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,198
- What the hell is this?
- Coffee can

466
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,396
- You expect me to use it?
- Only flavour I got.

467
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,472
You're unbelievable.
There's almost $20,000 there.

468
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,711
You watched me sell this farm off bit by bit
till there was nothing left.

469
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,119
Why are you doing this?

470
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,116
Damned if I know.

471
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,559
Breed the horse, Ben.

472
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,597
Picking up that filly was the gutsiest thing
I've seen you do in years.

473
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,911
Guts?
I took the biggest swing I could and I struck out.

474
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,560
- And you gave up.
- I'm broke, Pop!

475
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,914
What do you expect me to do?

476
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,790
I expect you to take the money,
trust your instincts and breed the horse.

477
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,110
- You told me to put her down
- But you didn 't.

478
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,555
- Cos you're a horseman.
- Oh, don 't blow smoke...

479
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,598
Are you gonna spend your life
shovelling horse squat for sheiks

480
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,636
or are you gonna get back in the game?

481
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,113
Don 't think I don 't know
what's going on here with you and Cale.

482
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,634
It's in her blood, Ben.

483
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,358
Cale's a beautiful kid.

484
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,829
Stop filling her head with horse stories.

485
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,876
Horse stories are all I got.

486
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,713
Keep 'em to yourself.
I'll pay you back when the foal sells.

487
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,719
Any chance you'll keep the foal?

488
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,392
Race him or her?

489
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,675
No, we're going to sell the foal.

490
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,955
But we still have Sonador.

491
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,190
Sonador?

492
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,599
Yeah It 's her full name

493
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,432
Sonador.

494
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,837
(Whispers) Sonador.

495
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,831
I think it's Spanish.

496
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,150
Spanish for "Dreamer".

497
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,918
Good night, Dreamer.

498
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,796
- OK, I got it.
- I'm going to Pop's.

499
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,669
Lil, how many days they give you
down at the diner?

500
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,750
I got Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

501
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,149
But I could take more.

502
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,470
Palmer called around. Shut me out everywhere.

503
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,199
I can 't find any work

504
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,355
I'm gonna have to take down the sign.

505
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,510
The real estate sign?

506
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,158
It's all been sold.

507
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,708
The only land we got left to sell, we're sitting on.

508
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,950
Here's the first letter of foreclosure.

509
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,877
- Morning.
- Hello Cale

510
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,951
- Hey Doc
- Balon. Manny.

511
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,996
Sonya's gonna make us some money huh?

512
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,594
This horse,
she gonna make a special baby, huh?

513
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,716
- Is Ben around?
- Yeah. I'm right here.

514
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,030
All right. Just got off the phone with Bill.

515
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,076
We're back on.

516
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,673
Going to breed her to Grand Slam.

517
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,230
Ben, I've completed my tests
and I've got some bad news for you.

518
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,112
What?

519
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,475
She's infertile.

520
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,272
She's not gonna have a baby now?

521
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,874
No, h o h oy, s h o: S h ovo r go h h a h avo pap os

522
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,556
I'm sorry, guys.

523
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,915
I'm sorry, Sonya.

524
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,956
T: S O K

525
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,713
It's almost dawn.

526
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,675
You 've been up all night

527
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,318
What was I thinking, Lil?

528
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,799
Trying to breed that horse?

529
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,239
Cale loves that horse.

530
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,675
That's good, cos that little filly just ruined us.

531
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,595
That little filly is the best thing
that's ever happened around here.

532
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,874
Come on, Lil.

533
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,270
Since she's been in that barn,
we have a family.

534
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,112
For the first time in years.

535
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,757
Look, I'll work seven days a week at the diner
if it means you'll spend time with your daughter.

536
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,718
Can 't you see how much
she wants to be with you?

537
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,634
And I know that your dad disappointed you,

538
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,917
but that does not mean
that you have to disappoint her

539
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,672
This has nothing to do with my father.

540
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,194
- No, it has everything to do with him.
- You're wrong.

541
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,273
The truth is, if Cale hadn 't been with me
that night, I'd have left that horse on the track

542
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,194
and let 'em put the horse down -
and I'd still have my job.

543
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,639
Cale...

544
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,477
Cale?

545
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,516
Come on. Cale?

546
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,756
Honey, can I come in?

547
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,238
Come on, let's just give her some time.

548
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,679
Cale?

549
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,910
Come on honey Open the door

550
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,989
Please?

551
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,355
She'll come downstairs when she's ready.

552
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,716
We're going to run away.

553
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,390
We're going to run far away.

554
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,389
There you go.

555
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,994
We're going for a walk.

556
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:24,756
Cale...

557
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,668
(Door bangs)

558
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,719
Stop, Sonya!

559
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,597
Sonya, stop!

560
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,472
Hang on, Cale.

561
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,869
Cale!

562
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,079
Dad she won 't stop!

563
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,439
I can 't make her stop!

564
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,869
Cale, hang on!

565
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,397
Please...

566
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,470
Cale...

567
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,913
Cale!

568
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,115
Jump.

569
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,315
Jump!

570
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,910
I got you. I got you.

571
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,115
I got you.

572
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,679
Are you all right? You OK?

573
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,229
I got you sweetie

574
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,276
I got you.

575
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,559
- Is she OK?
- She's all right.

576
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,833
It's all right, baby.

577
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,876
T: S O K

578
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,237
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yeah.

579
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,231
- Huh?
- Yes, I'm OK.

580
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,916
Hey, Ben?

581
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,073
How's Cale doing?

582
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,354
- She's all right?
- She OK?

583
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,032
Yeah. She's fine.

584
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,030
OK.

585
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,078
- Could we talk to you for a minute, boss?
- All right. How's Sonya?

586
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,312
She was running back and forth
along the fence and...

587
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,914
- We were following her...
- Balon, did she break down?

588
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,592
How bad is she?

589
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,911
Well, in the truck it said that she's about,
I don 't know, a quarter mile.

590
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,228
And, well, she...

591
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,629
She was getting faster and faster.

592
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,591
Yeah

593
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,069
She's looking pretty strong sir

594
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,194
What are you?

595
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,599
Well...

596
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,318
You saying she should race?

597
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,390
You can load her up, Joe.

598
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,313
M a r a h: S Sto r m p roko h o r og
th o sa m o way as So h ya

599
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,992
Same fracture, same location.

600
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,071
Who's Mariah's Storm?

601
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,151
- She was a great racehorse.
- She sure was.

602
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,550
- Made a big comeback, too.
- Beat Serena's Song in the graded stakes.

603
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,110
When I saw Sonya's X-rays,
I thought I ought to show 'em to you.

604
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,555
- That bone is healed.
- Oh, yeah. That leg's good.

605
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,598
Now, getting her back into racing shape,
that's up to you.

606
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,874
Good luck.

607
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,712
Thanks a lot, Doc.

608
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,756
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

609
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,276
Well, she's not favouring that leg.

610
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,513
Ow: S s h o ook?

611
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,238
She looks big.

612
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,311
- Big as in strong?
- No, big as in fat.

613
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,355
That's mean. That's mean.
You shouldn 't say that.

614
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,197
She's been eating too many Popsicles.

615
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,873
- What?
- What?

616
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,191
You didn 't know I knew about that, did you?
(Laughs)

617
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,878
- 3Tr and two.
- 3Tr two.

618
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,439
36.

619
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,431
(Clicks stopwatch)

620
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,798
What do you think?

621
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,194
Well, in five weeks,
best she's done is three furlongs in 3Tr seconds.

622
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,240
Not fast enough to win much, is it?

623
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,595
Maybe a cheap claimer at Bluegrass Downs.

624
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,076
She was a graded stakes horse.

625
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,956
Now she's a claimer.

626
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,150
It might be a good idea to run her in one.

627
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,794
See if she perks up in a real race.

628
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,916
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

629
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,915
You don 't think anybody would claim her,
do you?

630
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,630
Would you buy a horse that broke its leg?

631
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,072
You Know, she might win.

632
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,918
Could be easy money.

633
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,790
COMMENTATOR: And away they go.
Away to a beautiful start.

634
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,235
And Super from the extreme outside.

635
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,356
Coming from behind is Sonador.

636
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,032
- Her leg looks pretty good.
- Y eah.

637
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,830
COMMENTATOR: They make their way around
the first turn and head onto the back stretch.

638
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,673
- Come on, Sonador! Come on.
- Can you see her?

639
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,830
COMMENTATOR: Running in fourth is Sonador.

640
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,876
And Sonador's now on the move on the outside.

641
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,155
Then we have back in fifth. All For Nothing.

642
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,912
Come on, baby.

643
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,752
Come on, Mike, change your lead now.

644
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,479
COMMENTATOR:
They make their way around the far turn.

645
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,357
- Go!
- Come on, girl.

646
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,556
On the inside comes Obvious Favourite.

647
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,074
Come on, Sonya, only three furlongs to go now.

648
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,475
She's coming up!

649
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,755
Major Easy and Obvious Favourite...

650
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,752
Show her the stick.... now. Get her out of there.

651
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,873
Come on, girl!

652
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,392
(Neighing)

653
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,636
Third!

654
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,278
- Third.
- Yeah.

655
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,873
That's great.

656
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,669
A minute 1 3 seconds. A little slow.

657
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,352
but it's the beginning.

658
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,672
You Know, if Mike wouldn't have been boxed in,
I think.she would've won, sir.
