00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,800
Most 16, 17-year-old kids,
they make a bad choice,

3
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
something gets broken,

4
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,900
they screw up in class,

5
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,000
hurt somebody's feelings,

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,200
show up at the prom drunk,

7
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,800
they get sent to the principal's office,

8
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,000
have their car keys taken away

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,600
or get grounded.

10
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,800
Then there's kids, they make a bad choice,

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,700
somebody ends up shot dead
in a parkin' lot.

12
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,000
Those kids get sent here.

13
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,900
- Get off me, homey!
- Hey, man!

14
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,300
I'll shut your mouth, punk!

15
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,200
- Weathers! Get off of 'im! Get off-a him!
- You don't know me! Shut your mouth!

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,100
- Get off me! Don't you ever diss my hood.
- I got him! Just get the door!

17
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,600
Goddamn 88.

18
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,700
Let's go, Weathers!

19
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Go back to sleep, guys. Lay down.

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
What is wrong with you?

21
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
Shit!

22
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,800
G'night, Weathers.

23
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,000
Back to bed, gentlemen.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Mr. Porter?

25
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,300
Gettin' beat in the middle of the night,
how do you like it, Roger? You like that?

26
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,400
Whatchu hitting me for?

27
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,700
What'd you hit Kelvin Owens for?

28
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,000
He dissed my hood.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
And now he's up there asleep
and you're stuck in here.

30
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,300
So what does that make you?

31
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Hey, man. Can you do dat?

32
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,600
- Can I do what?
- Be smackin' me and shit.

33
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,700
I guess I can.

34
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,100
Shit, man!

35
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,000
Roger, you're 1 7 years old.
Where you gonna be in four years, huh?

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,700
I don't know.

37
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,600
Answer me.
Where you gonna be when you're 21?

38
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,900
Probably in jail.

39
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,000
What?

40
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,200
Look at me!

41
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
What'd you say?

42
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
In jail.

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,300
No. You're not gonna be in jail.
You're gonna be dead.

44
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,000
You're a good kid, Roger.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
But you're gonna be
back out on the streets tomorrow.

46
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,700
Back in your hood with your homeys.

47
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,100
You wanna stay alive, you gotta make a life
for yourself outside of your set.

48
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,800
If you don't do that,
if you don't find an alternative,

49
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
you're gonna die.

50
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,300
If you want any kinda help,
if you want to talk, I'm here for you.

51
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
Think about it.

52
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,800
Man, the moon be playin' with me, dawg.

53
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Locked up at camp, used to look up
and see it all white and clean.

54
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,400
And think how it's the same o'er here
in the hood, only it's all dirty and shit.

55
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Look, man, you back in the hood now, man.
You best forget that moon.

56
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,300
Keep your eyes on this here street, man.
You're back, baby.

57
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,400
Yo, I remember this poem said once,

58
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,600
"The moon is a friend
for the Ionesome to talk to."

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,200
Damn, girl.

60
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,300
You got a poem for everything that come up.

61
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,000
Didn't I tell you she was smart?

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Yeah, she so smart

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,200

64
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,300
There they go. There they go.

I saw the whole damn thing, officer.
Destroying the community.

98
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
Get all them damn gangs.

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,100
Drac.

100
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,900
Who did this?

101
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,400
95s, man.

102
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,400
One they call Klick.

Yeah, all right.

104
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,800
I know how it hurts. You and Raja
like lil' brothers to me, all right?

105
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,000
We gotta do right by him.

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,100
Me, I'll deal with Klick.

107
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,700
You put in work on his brother.

108
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,600
His name's Anthony.
Works nights, Parkside Market.

109

Free, let me go wit 'im.
I want to smoke some 95s too, man.

C-Co, this here is Drac's work. Right?

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,300
For Raja.

112
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,900
Oh, God!

113
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,400
Oh, God!

114
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,700
All right, put all reading and writing material
and games away.

115
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, come on, homes.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
If I see it, it's confiscated.

117
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,300
- Sean.
- What's goin' on?

118
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Back up a little bit.

119
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Roger Weathers got killed
in a drive-by today.

120
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,700
I said don't rush me, bitch!

121
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,300
See what happens?

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,900
What?

123
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
- Wassup?
- Get back! Enough! Come on!

124
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,800
Wassup?

125
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
Junior. Hey!

126
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,300
To the box.

127
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,800
I know the way.

128
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,300
You get your hands
behind your back, mister.

129
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
We got your back, homey.

130
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,400
That's the third time in the box
this week for Junior.

131
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Back in your bunks.

132
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,300
Anyone else wanna laugh and joke
with him in the box? Is that it?

133
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,100
I'll send somebody's ass back to the box.

134
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,700
Christ, Malcolm, what are we doin' here?

135
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
We're like goddamn sheepherders.

136
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
We fatten 'em up and put 'em right back
on the street where they get slaughtered.

137
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,200
Tell me about it.

138
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,700
We're not even makin' a dent.

139
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Willie!

140
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,100
Willie!

141
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,300
Where's Anthony at?

142
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,700
In the back.

143
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,700
Go, baby! Go!

144
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,200
Don't do this, please.

145
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,000
I got two little boys at home.

146
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,300
For my dead homey!

147
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,500
No, don't do this.

148
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,800
Oh, my God, what are you do...

149
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh, shit!

150
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,700
Damn!

151
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,000
Where you been?
I thought somethin' happened to you.

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,700
Naw, I'm a'ight.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,100

154
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,500

Just shut up.

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,800

156
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,600
Come here.

157
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,100
- Wassup, Ma?
- Here.

158
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,000
What's this?

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,700
- It was an accident.
- "Accident."

160
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,500
Accident? Why you keep lettin' him
do this to you, Ma?

161
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,600
Why you keep lettin' him back in here?

162
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Hey, hey, hey,

163
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,300
- Stay outta this?
- That's right. She know why she got it.

164
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,200
- This my mother. This is my mother.
- Who you talking to?

165
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Naw, Mama, I'm sick of it!

166
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
- You better calm him down.
- He come and go whenever he please,

167
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,800
take your money and disappear
till he need more? I'm tired of this lowlife!

168
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
- Stop!
- Get off, lowlife woman!

169
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,100
I'm tired of this...

170
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
Show me some respect, you little punk.

171
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Don't hit my son! Are you crazy?

172
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,000
- You better show me my respect!
- Don't you put your hands on him!

173
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Get off!

174
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I told you, you hurt her again...

175
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,500
You ain't got the balls to shoot me, boy.

176
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,900
Just leave!

177
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,400
Oh, God, no. No, no. No, no, no, no. No.
No, baby. No. No.

178
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,000
He's dead.

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,400
Listen, Paul, we convince a kid to stop
gangbanging, all we do is create a void.

180
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,700
And unless we fill that void
with somethin' better, we're gonna lose 'em.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,200
According to the teaching staff,
the kids here have trouble being punctual,

182
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,900
responding to authority, being a member
of a team, and accepting criticism.

183
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,700
What one activity can improve 'em
on all these areas?

184
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,300
- You wanna start a football team?
- Exactly.

185
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,600
Sean, look at them.

186
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,900
Our whole system's designed
to prevent them from making contact.

187
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,600
Our whole system right now is a joke.

188
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,200
Malcolm, you're not buying into this,
are you?

189
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,400
Seventy-five percent of our kids
end up back in jail.

190
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,600
How much worse could it be?

191
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,900
Well, who are they gonna play against?

192
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,600
I'll find 'em high school teams to play.

193
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,500
Wait a minute,
you wanna take 'em out of the camp?

194
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,300
You really think you can trust these kids?

195
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,000
Not now, no.
But if they were a football team...

196
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
Oh, come on, Sean. It's impossible.

197
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,700
Then let's try the impossible,
because the possible just ain't workin'.

198
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,900
Paul, we've got to give these kids a target
and we've gotta fill that void.

199
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,700
You played football, didn't you?

200
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Defensive end. Second Team All League.

201
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,400
All right, we'll give it a try.

202
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,100
But your neck is way out on this.

203
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,300
Mom, they have wheelchairs, ya know.

204
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,100
- I'm okay.
- Thank you.

205
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Now, see, I've been tellin' you for years
you should coach.

206
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,800
I know. I know, Mom, but I just think
with you sick, maybe it's not a good time.

207
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
I completely agree.

208
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Why should you do something you love

209
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,500
when you could be sittin' around
watchin' me fade away?

210
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,800
So, what kinda offense you gonna run?

211
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,700
I don't even know
if enough kids'll wanna play.

212
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,200
Are you kiddin'?
Teenage boys'll kill to play football.

213
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,200
That's what everybody's afraid of.

214
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,100
Throw it in. Over here. Down low.

215
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,500
Hey, yo, fetch me that ball, man.

216
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,200
Yo, nigga, you deaf? I said gimme the ball.

217
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,000
What, you can't talk neither?

218
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Yo, Junior.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,900
Take that ball, dawg.

220
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,500
This cat think he king of Samoa 'cause
he killed some Mexican with a baseball bat.

221
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
Yo, Junior, come on, man.

222
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Catch you on the fly, homey.

223
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Ball in, man.

224
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,100
Whatchu looking at me foul like that for?

225
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
I know you.

226
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,700
You a goddamn 88.

227
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,100
Yeah, that's right.

228
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,300
You lucky we up in here.

229
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,000
'Cause on the outs

230
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,200
you'd be dead.

231
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,800
I'll kill you right here, right now.

232
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,700
All right, gentlemen, let's line it up.

233
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,400
Owens, that's you too.
Come on, hurry up. Everybody.

234
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,200
Hurry up. Move it.

235
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
You wanna play football with this team,

236
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
you're gonna live with the team,
eat with the team and work with the team.

237
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,900
Is practice gonna be hard?

238
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,700
It's a lot harder than five homeboys
beatin' up a security guard, Perez.

239
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,200
Then I'm in.

240
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
How 'bout you, Bates?

241
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,600
I don't know.

242
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,200
- Don't be scared.
- I'm not scared.

243
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,800
You're on the team.

244
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,100
Yo. I'll play quarterback.

245
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,500
You got any experience, Leon?

246
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,100
Man, I got so much experience

247
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,900
I could give some away
and still have more than I could use.

248
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,600
All right.

249
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,100
I'll play.

250
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
- I can't use you, Junior.
- Why not?

251
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,500
'Cause you got no discipline. You'll be tryin'
to start fights every time I turn my back.

252
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,800
You ain't even gonna give me a chance?

253
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,300
You've had plenty of chances.

254
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,600
Who else?

255
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,700
How 'bout you, Owens?

256
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,200
You played defensive back, didn't you?
For Washington?

257
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,900
You wanna check your calendar
and get back to me?

258
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,500
Or maybe you got
another liquor store to rob.

259
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,100
Yeah, I'll play.

260
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,900
How 'bout you, Evans?

261
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,000
I mean, I played Pop Warner when
I was younger but that's about it, though.

262
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,100
You're on the team.

263
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,500
I got experience.
I played for, like, three years.

264
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,400
- What position'd you play?
- Out to the side.

265
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,300
Was that out to the side on offense
or defense?

266
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,000
If the ball's thrown from...

267
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,200
Man, I don't know what I'm talkin'.

268
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,800
All right, Bug. How 'bout you be water boy?

269
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,400
- Cool.
- All right.

270
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,700
Yo, Mr. Porter. Can I play?

271
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
You're getting out in a week, Madlock.

272
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,900
I wanna stay in.

273
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,500
You wanna stay in jail?

274
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,300
Yeah, man.
South Central in summertime gets hot.

275
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,100
Gets crazy.
People start shootin' each other and stuff.

276
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,800
I'll talk to your case worker.

277
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,100
- All right?
- All right.

278
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,200
New booty? What's your name?

279
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,500
Willie Weathers.

280
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,000
Get vertical when you talk to me.

281
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
You any relation to Roger Weathers?

282
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
He was my cousin, man.

283
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,500
I want you to play on this team, Willie.

284
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,900
Naw, man, it's a'ight.

285
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,700
You're playin'.

286
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,000
Why?

287
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,200
'Cause I want you to live longer
than your cousin.

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,300
Hey. Who we gonna play against?

289
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,800
We'll let ya know.

290
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,100
All right.

291
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,400
I'm gonna do my stuff, boy.

292
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,600
Well, it's not a jail.
It's a juvenile detention center.

293
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,500
But they're criminals?

294
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,700
Yeah. Technically.

295
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,100
Sorry, I can't.

296
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,500
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Coach.

297
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,100
Our players will be closely supervised,
no problems.

298
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,200
Sounds fine,
as long as there's no gang members.

299
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,600
See, that's the thing.
We don't have our own home field.

300
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,400
So you expect to bring 'em here.

301
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,800
Yeah, that's a great idea. We love your field.

302
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,600
I'll come tomorrow.

303
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,800
Sorry, guys, I don't think it's gonna work.

304
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,900
Most of our starters
have been in this program for three years.

305
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,600
You have four weeks to prepare your team.

306
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,100
Do you really wanna go up
against those kinda odds?

307
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,300
I'll bet ya $100 we win.

308
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,100
We're a Christian school,
we don't gamble. I...

309
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,600
Look, I have to be honest with ya.

310
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't think it's in the best interest
of my kids to play you.

311
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,100
Well, what about our players?
Don't they deserve a chance to play?

312
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
Well, frankly, no. They lost that chance
when they broke the law.

313
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,200
Well, maybe we shouldn't let 'em eat, either.
How 'bout that?

314
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,300
Sean.

315
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,000
Mr. Torrance, let me ask you.
You a Christian, right?

316
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
Yeah.

317
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,800
Now, I'm not that familiar
with the exact words,

318
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,200
but didn't Jesus say somethin' like,

319
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,800
"Be merciful, just as your Father's merciful,

320
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,100
"don't pass judgment
and you won't be judged"?

321
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,800
It's the book of Luke.

322
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,700
"Give and it'll be given in good measure.

323
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,700
"For whatever measure
you deal out to others,

324
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,200
"it'll be dealt to you in return."

325
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,000
You're not too familiar with it, huh?

326
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,500
No, look, Bob and Mel said it's fine
with them if it's fine with you.

327
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,600
I didn't know you were religious.

328
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,000
I ain't religious, but we need
all the help we can get for this program.

329
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Wouldn't hurt for you to pray some yourself.

330
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,300
Well, scheduling games
on Saturday afternoon,

331
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,800
it isn't easy,

332
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,900
but I think I just got you a full schedule.

333
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,100
- Thank you.
- Welcome to the Camino Real League.

334
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,300
Hey, thanks a lot.

335
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,100
Take a knee, half-circle.

336
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,300
Everybody take a knee.

337
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,700
Gentlemen, we ain't got all day.

338
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,100
Bring it in.

339
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,900
All right, everybody, listen up.

340
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,300
Whatever neighborhood you came from,

341
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,200
whatever gang you claim,

342
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
whatever hood you're from,

343
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,600
this is your hood now.

344
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
You're no longer a Blood, no longer a Crip,

345
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,100
no longer an esé.

346
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,600
You're Mustang.

347
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,400
This football program will be three-pronged.

348
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,300
Number one, the dorm.

349
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,100
You're gonna have to learn to get along
with people from other neighborhoods.

350
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,600
Different backgrounds.

351
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,400
Number two, school.

352
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
You're gonna have to apply yourself.
Become a better student.

353
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,500
And number three, the gridiron.

354
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,100
Hey, Coach. What's the gridiron?

355
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,500
You're standin' on the gridiron.

356
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,000
The gridiron is a football field.

357
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,300
On the gridiron, we play football.

358
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,700
On the gridiron, we do it my way.

359
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,500
Not your way, my way.

360
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,800
Your way got you here.

361
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,500
And you're here 'cause ya lost.

362
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Right now, you're losers.

363
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,400
Mustangs are winners.

364
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,000
And if you accept this challenge,

365
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,400
when it's all over come December,

366
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,600
you're gonna be winners.

367
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
All right, let's go. Let's have
a good first day of practice. Jumpin' jacks.

368
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,800
Everybody ready? Get set!

369
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,700
Begin.

370
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,300
M-U-S-T-A...

371
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,100
- T!
- A!

372
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,000
A-N-G-S!

373
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,800
You've got to be shittin' me.
You don't know how to spell "Mustangs"?

374
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,200
This is gonna be a long-ass day.

375
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,000
Evans, what in the blue hell is that?

376
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,700
Get up, Evans!

377
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,400
I bet ya there's a piece-a chicken down there
you'd go for it, wouldn't ya?

378
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,600
Hell, yeah, Coach. I love chicken.

379
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,000
Then get your ass down there
on my whistle.

380
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,300
On my whistle, get that chicken.

381
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,800
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it.
Get your feet pumpin'.

382
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,900
Feet pumpin'. You got pride.

383
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,100
Bend your knees.

384
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,600
Damn.

385
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,500
Concentrate. Focus.

386
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,000
- Little lower, Bates.
- Bend your knees.

387
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,300
You up for the challenge, Bates?

388
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,900
Good job. Thatta boy.

389
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,900
All right, Bug, let's get a water break. Bug.

390
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,300
All right, good job. Bring it in.

391
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,800
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

392
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,400
Y'all don't behave, y'all gonna die of thirst.
Y'all got that?

393
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,000
All right?
Hey, hey, I gotta do it, I gotta do it.

394
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,300
Here y'all go, here y'all go. All right, now.

395
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,200
Y'all doin' good out there,
that's what I like to see.

396
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,100
M-U-S-T-A-N-G-S!

397
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,900
Mustangs! Mustangs! Mustangs!

398
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,200
Come on, bring it! Hustle.
Touch that line and get back!

399
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,500
Way to go, Leon! Think you got that!

400
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,800
You ain't cheatin' me,
you're cheatin' yourself. Behind the line.

401
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,200
- Let's go!
- All the way through.

402
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,000
Come on, Weathers! Hustle!
Get down here, Weathers! Good job!

403
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,600
Good job. Now, get back!
Good hustle, come on!

404
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Come on, Weathers. Come on.
All the way through, Willie!

405
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,800
Come on, Kelvin. Get 'im!

406
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,500
Look at you go, Evans! I like that! I like it!

407
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,300
Touch the line!

408
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,900
Evans, this is wind sprints, not wind walks.

409
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,600
All the way through, Evans.
Come on, come on. Come on.

410
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,000
- I'm too tired.
- You're too tired, my ass. You're too lazy.

411
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,300
But that's gonna change. I promise you
that's gonna change, come on.

412
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,500
Come on, back in line.
Through the line, Evans.

413
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,000
Man, I quit, dawg.
I had enough of this shit, man.

414
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,700
Y'all niggas is trippin'.

415
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,800
Five hundred degrees
and y'all doin' wind sprints?

416
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,500
If you can't accept the challenge,

417
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,000
then you're not good enough to call
yourself a Mustang, Evans. You hear me?

418
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,300
You wanna come back out here,
we'll be out here workin' our asses off.

419
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,700
You wanna come back out, make sure you
bring a heart with you next time.

420
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,900
What's everybody lookin' at?
Who else wants to quit?

421
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,700
Come on, Bates. We're almost done, Bates.
Don't quit on me.

422
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Hand on the line. On my whistle.

423
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,500
All the way through,
touch the line and get back.

424
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Come on, Bates. This is where we
win the game, in the fourth quarter.

425
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,400
You will be mentally tough
when this is done.

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,900
All right, bring it in.

427
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,700
Great practice, great practice.

428
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Way to work, way to work.

429
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Everybody in close. Get in close.
Take a knee.

430
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,600
You guys worked really hard this week.
You should be proud.

431
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,900
You haven't heard that a whole lot,
have you?

432
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,600
You've earned it.

433
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,200
Boys, it's a whole new world out there
when you earn things.

434
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,100
All right, bring it in.

435
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,200
Everybody in. Everybody in.

436
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

437
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,700
Mustangs!

438
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,400
Jog it off the field. Jog it off!
You want water? It's on the sidelines. Jog!

439
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,400
Three weeks from this Saturday, we open
our season against Barrington High School.

440
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
They any good?

441
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,500
They've only lost five games in three years.

442
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
We about to make it six.

443
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,700
All right, all right, listen up.

444
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,500
Madlock, look up here. I want you to tell me
what the offense is tryin' to do.

445
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,400
Which is the offense?

446
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,000
The O's.

447
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Man, I don't know what all this shit mean.

448
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,200
It means, "Have a nice day"
in Japanese, Madlock.

449
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,900
Naw, man, Japanese for "Nissan Sentra,"
right, Bates?

450
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,500
What does that mean, Bates?

451
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,200
Bates jacked a Nissan Sentra.
That's why he's here.

452
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,700
It's sad. If you gonna jack a car,
jack a Mercedes or a BMW.

453
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,300
If you jack a Sentra, you gotta drive
backwards so nobody can see your face.

454
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,300
All right, listen up.

455
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,000
You got a pass, Junior?

456
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,200
I had a phone call.

457
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,400
From who?

458
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,500
It's my boy's birthday, man.

459
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,300
He's two years old.

460
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,600
He's two years old and I missed it.

461
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,300
I wanna be a Mustang, Coach.

462
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,800
Why should I trust you?

463
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,600
'Cause I ain't gonna mess up.

464
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,400
That's what you told the judge
the last time you got out.

465
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,700
No more.

466
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,300
I'm tired of bein' a loser, man.

467
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,100
Makin' a mess of everything.

468
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,300
Coach, I wanna show people I can play.
I can do somethin' with my life.

469
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,100
I just wanna make my son proud.

470
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,600
Take it half speed till we get it right.

471
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,600
Set.

472
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,900
Hut!

473
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,500
Junior. Junior. Junior. Junior!

474
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,200
Hey, get back. Madlock, get back.

475
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,500
Just 'cause we call it a run-through

476
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,100
doesn't mean you run through
your own men.

477
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,800
No contact till we get equipment.

478
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,300
- Look out for Junior.
- Wait till you get some pads.

479
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,700
Bug, give 'em water.

480
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,800
I'll be down with it, Coach!
Come on, guys, let's go!

481
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,700
Coach, how 'bout you have that water boy
go fill up the swimmin' pool?

482
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,900
Let us do a little backstroke
before we get heatstroke.

483
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,100
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll put a quart of water in that pool

484
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,200
for every pass you complete.

485
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,000
- How 'bout that?
- Okay, that's what's up.

486
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,600
Drink it up, drink it up, drink it up.

487
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
You want some water, 88?

488
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,700
My dead homeys drink water before you do.

489
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all doing good out there.
What I like to see!

490
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,000
Keep it up, I'll provide some extra water.

491
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,100
Now that's a funny kid. He always smilin'.

492
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,500
It's all about the water, man.

493
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,800
I wonder if he was smilin'
when he stabbed that old lady for her purse.

494
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,900
Here ya go.

495
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,200
Junior, Willie, is that your positions?

496
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,300
Let's go. Leon, let's see what you got.

497
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,800
Green 18!

498
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,300
Green 18! Hut!

499
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,300
What was that about?

500
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Man, just send me to the box!

501
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,500
No, you start trouble on a football field,
we finish it on a football field!

502
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,000
- I ain't doin' shit wit 'im!
- Why not?

503
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,300
Was his set smoked Raja!

504
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,400
- 88s killed my best friend!
- Shut up!

505
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
How long your sets been at war?

506
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,000
Ancient times, dude.

507
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,700
How'd it get started? You even know?

508
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,100
They started that shit, dawg!

509
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,500
- Man, that's a goddamn lie!
- Shut up!

510
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,600
Willie, lemme ask you something.

511
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,800
How'd you feel when Roger died?

512
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,200
Did you cry?

513
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,600
How 'bout you, Kelvin?

514
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,000
How did you feel
when your friend was killed? Did you cry?

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,500
Yes, sir, I did.

516
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,200
Yeah. So it's just gonna
go on like this forever?

517
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,500
Killin' each other 'cause ya live
five blocks in the wrong direction?

518
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,300
How 'bout we call a peace right here?

519
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,000
God damn it, why not?

520
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,700
I mean, we just, like, little gangsters.
It wouldn't even mean nothin'.

521
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:25,100
It'd mean somethin' here. Right here,
right now, it would mean somethin'.

522
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,200
Paul, a delay in funding?

523
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,700
Well, there's a lot of red tape
and paperwork we gotta...

524
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,500
How are we supposed
to play without equipment?

525
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,900
I just read Willie Weathers' file.
Have you seen it?

526
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah, what about it?

527
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,700
We had an agreement.
No killers on the football team, right?

528
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,300
Dexter, if there's more than five kids
on that team that aren't killers,

529
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,400
it's because they have lousy aim.

530
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
- They're not in here for that.
- 'Cause they didn't get caught.

531
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,500
But Weathers did.

532
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,400
And I'm workin' my ass off to make sure
he doesn't kill anybody again!

533
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,900
You sure that's it?

534
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,100
What?

535
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,200
Well, you were a college football star.
Maybe this team is...

536
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Dexter, your degree was in social work,
not psychology.

537
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,100
We need that equipment.

538
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,000
Guy's outta control.

539
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Not now I'm not. But soon, very soon!

540
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,800
Come on, show us what you got!

541
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,300
Come on, buddy! Throw it!
No, no, no, no, no!

542
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,400
Evade!

543
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
Come on, man!

544
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
You gotta be kiddin' me! Hold on, hold on!

545
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,200
Cut it out.

546
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,600
For three days, we been runnin' this play.
You still don't know where you're goin'!

547
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,300
Get your asses on the line and do it again,
and do it right! Line it up!

548
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,000
Coach, you said we'd have a water break.

549
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,800
Not until you do it right. Line it up!

550
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,400
Line it up! Move!

551
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
Weathers, get up.

552
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,900
Not till we get some water.

553
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,000
Bug, give 'em some water.

554
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,300
- Here you go, boys!
- Finally did something as a team.

555
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,300
The water man's back in town.
Here you guys go.

556
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,800
These kids have never worked hard
for anything in their life.

557
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,600
And teamwork. Teamwork to them
is four homeboys robbin' a liquor store.

558
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,500
So I gotta push 'em. But I know
if I push 'em too hard I'll lose 'em.

559
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,000
You couldn't expect 'em to work as hard
as you did. Not right off the bat.

560
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,200
Now, see, you had a God-given talent.

561
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,300
The minute you put on a helmet,
you were a star.

562
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,500
I always had faith in you.

563
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,100
You're my mom. That's your job.

564
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,400
I'm your mom, that's my job.

565
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Well, here we are.

566
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,000
Home sweet home.

567
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,700
Junior?

568
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,900
Who needs helmets?

569
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Bug, give this to somebody who can use it.

570
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Now, that's more like it.

571
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,000
Damn, J-dawg,
that's destruction of state property.

572
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,100
What the hell is this?

573
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,600
A nose guard.

574
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,100
It's for your balls, dawg.

575
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Man, that's for pussies.

576
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,300
Let's get it on!

577
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,600
Five tight, 32 dive. Run it.

578
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,400
Set.

579
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,600
Green 18!

580
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Hut!

581
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Madlock, what happened?

582
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,100
He broke my biscuits, man.

583
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,900
Broke your biscuits.
Are you wearin' your cup?

584
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,400
No.

585
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,700
Naw, he ain't wearin' his cup.
Because cups are for pussies!

586
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Hey, yo, Coach.
I think I need to go back to the gym.

587
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,900
- You gotta go back to the gym?
- Yes, sir.

588
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,800
Put your cup on, maybe?

589
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,000
Yeah, me too.

590
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,900
Get goin', Willie.
Anybody else forget to put their cups on?

591
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,700
Yeah. Half the team.

592
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,600
Come on, Madlock, walk it off.

593
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,300
Walk it off, Madlock.

594
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,600
Yeah, limp it off, Madlock.

595
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,900
Hey, Coach.

596
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,700
I got mine on but it ain't nowhere
near big enough to hold me.

597
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,600
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I need the extra-large, Coach.

598
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,800
Well, come here, tiny. Let me talk to you
for a second. Y'all get back to work.

599
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,200
All right, line it up, gentlemen.

600
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,800
What's up, Coach?

601
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,700
Last year, when you were dealing crack,

602
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,400
I heard that you made five times my salary.

603
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
And I ain't paid no taxes.

604
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,600
- No taxes?
- No taxes.

605
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,800
Means you're pretty good
at math, memorization.

606
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,400
Yeah, I'm pretty friendly wit it.

607
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Here's the problem.

608
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,700
I'm worried about Madlock
not being able to learn our playbook.

609
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,100
What's that got to do wit me?

610
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,200
If he can't learn it, he doesn't play,
which means he doesn't block for you,

611
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,200
which then means I'm gonna have
to put in Aguilar to protect you.

612
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,500
I see, Coach.

613
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,800
- You understand?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand.

614
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
Get back to work. Come on.

615
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,600
Let's go!

616
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,100
Mr. Porter, can I talk to you?

617
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,800
I tried to tell ya.

618
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,100
Hey, Dexter.

619
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,300
You signed for $10,000 worth of equipment?

620
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,600
We got a helluva deal.

621
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,400
You're not authorized to do that.

622
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
Really? I thought I was.

623
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
You're gonna get suspended,
you know that, right?

624
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,200
Yeah, I know, but first you're gonna
have to write up a 784,

625
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,700
and then they're gonna schedule a hearing,

626
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,000
which I'm gonna have to postpone
due to a family illness,

627
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,300
then I'm gonna appeal that ruling, and
by that time, the season's gonna be over.

628
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,400
Look, Dexter, the equipment's used already,
we can't give it back.

629
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,200
Let's just give the kids what they worked
really, really hard for, huh?

630
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,400
I got a Mustang football T-shirt
for you, Dexter.

631
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,100
Get 'em goin', Coach.

632
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,100
Madlock, I'm gonna work witchu
'cause you got what it takes.

633
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,600
I'mma just, you know what I'm sayin',
get you together.

634
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,000
Hey, watch out, man! We workin' here!

635
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Come on, Madlock, just stand in front of me,
don't let nobody hit me.

636
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,800
You gonna come see me play?
See Daddy play football?

637
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,300
Hey, Weathers.

638
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,800
You got a visitor.

639
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,900
- Danyelle!
- Willie.

640
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,100
Damn, girl.

641
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,200
How'd you get here?

642
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,300
Bus.

643
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,600
Bus? It's musta taken you
like two days, huh?

644
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,900
Seemed like it.

645
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,000
Seemed... Seemed like it.

646
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,600
Well, I'm really glad you here.

647
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,100
Why don't you move your fat ass to another
table with your McDonald's and shit?

648
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,200
I know you not gonna disrespect me
in front of my family!

649
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Jermaine, let it go!

650
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,800
Get off me!

651
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Settle down!

652
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
You want your family to go home?

653
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,600
Man, settle down!

654
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,400
What's up, mija?
You wanna swing low on this or what?

655
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Hey, yo, shut your ass up, Peavy!

656
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,800
Willie, Willie, Willie, don't do that!

657
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,900
- Nah, you ain't nothin' but a bluff, nigga!
- No! Come on!

658
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,000
Man, you a bluff.
See you when you get out the box.

659
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,900
Don't even worry about him.
I'll take care of him later on, all right?

660
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,300
Come on, let's go sit down.

661
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,700
I wanna go.

662
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,800
You wanna go?

663
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,800
How you gonna take care of him, Willie?

664
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,600
You gonna kill him?

665
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,200
Danyelle.

666
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,400
Come on, girl.

667
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,400
Mom, you can't just get up and leave.

668
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Just don't look at me like that, all right?
Whaddya want me to do about it?

669
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm not the one who put you here, all right?
You put yourself here.

670
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,100
Damn it.

671
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,800
What's goin' on, buddy?

672
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,300
It's my mom.

673
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,900
Things are just so messed up.

674
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Gets so I just hate her.

675
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,600
No, you don't.

676
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,100
Just want my mom to love me, you know?

677
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,000
I know.

678
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,200
I know.

679
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,200
You know what I was thinkin'?

680
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,900
'Bout we try you out at receiver?

681
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,200
You mean, like, I'd be catchin' the ball?

682
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,500
Sometimes. Mostly blockin'.

683
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,300
That'd be cool.

684
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,600
Why don't you get your playbook.

685
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
I'll meet ya up here.
We'll go over some plays.

686
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,600
- All right. Right now?
- Right now.

687
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,400
You guys got any letters to go out before
the weekend, I gotta screen 'em tonight.

688
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,500
Dear Danyelle.

689
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,200
Look, I'm sorry you felt bad here.

690
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,500
I don't like it either but I'm tryin' to change.

691
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,600
My mama moved to Oakland.

692
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,400
She don't want my little brother
havin' nothin' to do with me.

693
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,500
Danyelle, you're the only one
who cares anything about me.

694
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,600
The only really good person I know.

695
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,300
Please write me back.

696
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,500
Let's go. It's that 28 toss, Leon.
Get 'em goin'. It's a big play for us.

697
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,700
Come on, Weathers, show me your wheels.

698
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,000
Let's see what you got, defense.
Kelvin, lemme see.

699
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,400
Kelvin, good job, good job.
Way to get in there.

700
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,900
Come on, Weathers, you're better than that!

701
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,200
Don't worry 'bout it, man. Hey, you'll get it.

702
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,500
All right, let's go! Run that same play.
Let's go!

703
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,900
I'm so tired, man.

704
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,100
Rather fight five angry niggas
than mess with this football shit.

705
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,300
Quit bitchin', quit moanin'!
We've got five days till we play Barrington.

706
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,600
If you don't get this stuff down,
if you don't get it right,

707
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,000
they're gonna kick your asses.

708
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,500
Can't nobody kick our ass, Coach.

709
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,300
Yeah, no, clearly, Junior. Yeah.

710
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,000
After what I just saw from Weathers,
you guys are gonna run over everybody.

711
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,200
Run the play!

712
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,500
Ten hut!

713
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,800
They all pussies, Coach.

714
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,000
You better let me play
or else we ain't gonna win.

715
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,800
Shut up, Bug.

716
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
All right, we're runnin' this play to Junior.
L-five toss, Junior.

717
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,200
Run it, Leon.

718
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,400
Gray 10. Gray 10. Hut!

719
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,600
Come on, Junior. Let's see
what you got, Junior. Go! Go, Junior! Go!

720
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,000
Hey, come on, man.

721
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,300
Hey, Coach! He down, man, come on!

722
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,600
Back up. Junior.

723
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,800
Junior, talk to me. You okay?

724
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,400
Talk to me, Junior.

725
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,200
I don't know what's wrong
if you don't talk to me.

726
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,000
We're gonna get you to a hospital,
get you all taken care of,

727
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,500
everything'll be okay, you hear me?

728
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,000
He gonna be a'ight.

729
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,900
See you tonight.

730
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,400
Listen up.

731
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,500
We just got back from the hospital.

732
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,000
The good news is Junior's gonna
walk outta there, he's gonna be okay.

733
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,700
The bad news,

734
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,400
he has a concussion and a slipped disk.

735
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,800
Without Junior we gonna suck, man.

736
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,200
Well, that's up to you, Leon. And you, Bates.

737
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,400
And you, Willie. Madlock, Perez, Kelvin.

738
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,900
It's up to all of you. Then we'll find out
what this team is made of.

739
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,600
You gotta imagine there's a goal post
right there to the right and to the left.

740
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,500
Good job!

741
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,100
Everybody in. Take your helmets off.

742
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,600
Circle it up. Circle up the wagons.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

743
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,100
Great practice, great practice.

744
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,500
Take a knee.

745
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,800
Next time you put those helmets on,
it'll be for real.

746
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,300
Learn your assignments, get ready.

747
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,000
- Madlock.
- That's my homey, man.

748
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
These are your homeys. You're not gonna
do 'em any good in the box! Sit down!

749
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,400
Chill, man.

750
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,000
Yo, whatch'all niggas lookin' at?

751
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,200
Y'all a buncha busters and shit!
Doin' everything they tell you.

752
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,500
Run, jump, roll over. Like little pets.
Little pussy pets.

753
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,100
Man, shut the hell up, Peavy!
Yeah, you the pussy.

754
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,500
Man, you ain't got half-a what it takes
to play football.

755
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,900
Keep walkin', Peavy.

756
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,600
What's up, Mustangs?

757
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, yo.
I got injuries.

758
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,800
Hey, Junior, what's up, man?

759
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,300
That's enough, though.

760
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,000
When I was in the hospital,

761
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,400
I thought a lot about you guys, man.

762
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,300
The team.

763
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,500
How you guys are like my family.

764
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
And I wanted to show my family
what I could do.

765
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,700
I just wish I could play witchu guys
on Saturday, man.

766
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,700
But I'll be there.

767
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,500
I know you guys are gonna kick ass, right?

768
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,900
Bring it in, y'all, come on.

769
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

770
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,000
I want it loud and clear.

771
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,500
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

772
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,800
Mustangs!

773
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,300
Come on, guys! Let's do this!

774
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,900
That's what I'm talkin' about! Let's do it.

775
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,000
We got a ass-kickin' for Barrington
waitin' for 'em.

776
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,700
We're gonna see
what you're made of, Weathers. On the bus.

777
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,900
Y'all ready, baby?

778
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,200
Evans.

779
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,100
Still wanna be a Mustang?

780
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,500
Of course I do. But I can't fulfill
the physical requirements, Coach.

781
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,800
Evans, you don't have to be an athlete
to be a Mustang.

782
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,200
Look at me.

783
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,600
You just gotta have heart.
I know you have heart.

784
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,100
We could use an equipment manager.
You interested?

785
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,300
Hell, yeah, I'm interested!

786
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,700
Come on.

787
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,300
Can I get
one of these Mustang shirts, though?

788
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,000
Oh, it's a lot of fabric, but yes.
Gimme some time to find your size.

789
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,400
Hey, Mustangs.
Meet the new equipment manager, Evans.

790
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,600
I'm tellin' you, Barrington about to get their
ass whooped when we step on the field.

791
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,600
'Ey. Don't forget,
you work for me now, Jermaine.

792
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,500
Shit, man, long as I don't gotta run,
I'll call you "boss," homey.

793
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,800
You know what I'm sayin'?

794
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,500
Hey! Look at the girl in the Mustang.

795
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,900
Where?

796
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,500
Damn!

797
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,100
Hey, I'd like to run a quarterback sneak
right into your end zone!

798
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,300
Hey, she wavin' at me! She wavin' at me!
She want me bad!

799
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,600
Jesus Christ, man.
You got this all messed up.

800
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,200
How many times we do this in practice?

801
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,400
All right, bring it in. Let's go.

802
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,000
This is it. The day you been waitin' for.

803
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,400
I know you're nervous. So am I.

804
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,700
My first game too.

805
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,200
Now it's time to go out there
and put it on the scoreboard.

806
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,300
Now it's time to see who has the heart.

807
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:36,700
Now is the time to prove to yourselves
and prove to everyone out there

808
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,100
that even though you're locked up,

809
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,700
you are somebody.

810
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,900
And you are worthy of something!

811
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,000
And you're able to do something special
that no one else in the world can do,

812
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,600
which you can walk through those doors,
hold your heads up high

813
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,000
and call yourselves Mustangs!

814
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,300
Are you ready to go out there
and take what's yours?

815
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,700
Yeah!

816
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,200
What you've worked hard for?

817
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,700
Yeah!

818
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,000
Are you ready to accept
the Mustang challenge?

819
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,600
Lead us!

820
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,300
Lead us!

821
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:55,800
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the undefeated Barrington Panthers.

822
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,400
Let's go, Mustangs.

823
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,600
Let's go, let's go.

824
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,100
Now, gather in. Hands in.
Hands in. Hands in.

825
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,700
I wanna see everybody's eyes.
Everybody's eyes.

826
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,700
You get out there on that field
and you earn their respect.

827
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,500
Mustangs on three. One, two, three!

828
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,100
Mustangs!

829
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,100
Kickoff team. Kickoff team.

830
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,900
Let's go, Mustangs.

831
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,400
Let's go! Let's go!

832
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,000
Nail that son of a bitch. Let's go, Kelvin.

833
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,700
Kelvin! Great hit! Great hit!

834
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:41,400
Madlock! Madlock!
Set the tone! You set the tone!

835
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,600
Set hut!

836
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,500
Fumble! Fumble!

837
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,000
First down!

838
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,800
Fumble recovery, number 31, Kelvin Owens.

839
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,500
That's what I'm talkin' about, Madlock.
Great job, Kelvin.

840
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,000
We bad, we bad, we bad.

841
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,400
Offense, get out there.

842
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,500
Ace, right cross! Let's go.

843
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,000
Leon, come here.

844
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,100
C'mon, listen. Pro right 25, toss.

845
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,400
C'mon. C'mon, damn it! Let's go!

846
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,800
Oh, shit!

847
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,400
- Hustle up!
- Go!

848
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,900
Pro right 25 and stuff.

849
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,300
Willie, run their asses over.
Run their asses over. It's all you.

850
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,200
Show 'em what you're made of.

851
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,700
Green 18!

852
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,300
Hut!

853
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,100
Yeah! Go Panthers!

854
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Good run. Good run. Right, let's get up.
Walk it off.

855
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,600
Tackled by number 55, John Stevens.

856
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
Welcome to my world, boy!

857
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,700
- Coach said to throw a 97 pass.
- Pass?

858
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,200
Yeah, man, 97 pass.

859
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,800
Yeah, man, what the hell is wrong with you?

860
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,000
You ain't never thrown a pass
in a real game, have you?

861
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,600
Naw, I played games. I played Madden.

862
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,100
What? This ain't EA, homey.

863
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:10,900
- A video game?
- I controlled the quarterback. What?

864
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,700
- Man, come on. 97 what?
- 97 pass.

865
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,500
97 pass right now is what we about to do
and I'mma throw it.

866
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,600
- 97 pass. On one. Ready?
- Break.

867
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,800
Green 18!

868
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,500
Hut!

869
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,000
Throw the ball! Throw the ball!

870
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,100
Son of a bitch!

871
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,700
First down, Barrington Panthers.

872
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,500
Leon! That's okay! Get it behind you!

873
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,700
What happened, dawg?

874
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,300
Let's go!

875
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,700
Coach, I suck, man. Just take me out.

876
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,300
Hey. No. Not gonna take you anywhere,
do ya understand?

877
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,000
I ain't takin' you out
and you ain't quitin' on me. Ya hear me?

878
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,200
You can do it. Now, come on.
Get your head in the game.

879
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,400
Come on. Come on.

880
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,800
Defense! Just get the ball back!
Get the ball back!

881
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,000
Set! White 20!

882
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,200
Hut!

883
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,300
Trouble, he's open! He's open!

884
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:22,200
Whose man is that? Number three!
Number three! Kelvin!

885
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
Touchdown, Panthers.

886
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,900
Hey! I wanna see some hittin' out there!

887
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,500
Set!

888
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,300
Black 20!

889
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,800
Hut!

890
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,300
Perez, you can't catch?

891
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,000
What's up?
You can't hit me in my chest, dawg?

892
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,900
- You coulda dove for that.
- That was too low, man.

893
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,100
- You coulda caught the ball.
- Just gonna push me like that?

894
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,300
Hey! Stop fightin' amongst yourselves.
Take it out on the enemy, for chrissake.

895
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,500
Catch the ball.

896
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,500
Down, set! Hut!

897
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,600
He's open! He's open!

898
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,800
Come on, Mustangs!

899
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,200
Touchdown, Barrington.

900
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,600
That was a 50-yard completion
by number 18, Michael Hays.

901
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,300
Damn, man.

902
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,000
Bates, you supposed to cut
when you see that dude cut, man.

903
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,700
We gettin' worked, man.

904
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,400
And that's halftime

905
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,600
with the Barrington Panthers leading 21
and the Mustangs 0.

906
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,600
Told you guys they wanted
to kick your asses.

907
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,100
That's exactly what they're doin'.

908
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,400
I've seen only two or three hits out there!

909
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:35,100
Linebackers, defensive backs,
they're runnin' right over you!

910
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,600
You're titty dancin' with 'em!

911
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,900
Defensive line! You're standin' up,
that's why they're takin' your legs out!

912
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,400
Madlock, come here!
You're standin' straight up!

913
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,000
If ya jam on him, you get your hands
on him, use upper body violence,

914
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,200
throw their ass to the dirt
and make the tackle!

915
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,300
And if you get your hands on the ball,
hang on to it.

916
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,800
Don't give it back!

917
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,800
Come on, baby! Let's go!

918
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,100
Let's go, Leon,
let's get 'em back in the game.

919
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,200
Get 'em back in the game, Leon!

920
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,100
Set!

921
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,000
Let's do it! Eyes on the prize!

922
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,700
Black 20!

923
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,000
Black 20!

924
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,900
Hut!

925
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,700
Bates is open!

926
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,200
Throw the ball!

927
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,400
God! I can't believe that.
Right through his hand.

928
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,700
You gotta catch the ball, Kenny!
Catch the ball.

929
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,800
Interception, Barrington.

930
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,200
Barrington's ball on the Mustangs'
32-yard line.

931
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:49,100
Unbelievable how we're playin'.
Absolutely ridiculous.

932
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:51,000
Let's go. Lemme see.

933
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,900
Tackle him! Tackle him! Tackle him!
Tackle him!

934
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,200
Damn it!

935
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,300
Another touchdown, Barrington Panthers.

936
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,300
Listen, we may not win this game,
but on the next kickoff,

937
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,200
let's salvage some pride. All right?

938
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,800
Ya get out there,
you run their asses over and don't quit.

939
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:26,500
Go! Go! Go!

940
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,400
Come on!

941
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,400
Afraid to get hit, boy? Don't like it, do ya?

942
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,700
Willie. Willie. What are you doin'?
You're waitin' for them to hit you.

943
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,400
Put your shoulder down
and run their asses over!

944
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,000
Grow some balls! Get out there and hit 'em!

945
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,900
Willie, shoulder down!
Run their asses over!

946
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,700
Comin' for you, boy.

947
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,400
Black 20!

948
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,500
Hut!

949
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,300
You better stay down, boy.
You better stay down.

950
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,200
- Hey, get off me, bitch!
- Oh, you the bitch.

951
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,000
Willie, get off the field!
Choi, get in there for Weathers.

952
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,200
Dead ball.

953
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,200
Unsportsmanlike conduct on white.
Fifteen yards.

954
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,200
C'mere. What was that?

955
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,300
This ain't no street fight out there.

956
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,900
- You gotta have discipline and self-control.
- Tell me about it, Coach.

957
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,400
That's the final score.

958
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,900
Barrington Panthers 38,
Kilpatrick Mustangs 0.

959
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,100
Get off the field. Off the field.

960
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,700
Madlock, what're you doin'?
A six-year-old girl could...

961
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:06,200
All right, come on. Bring it in.
Off the bench, come on. C'mere.

962
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,900
Everybody. Off the benches.
Come take a knee.

963
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,600
Let's gather 'round. Let's go. Take a knee.

964
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,300
C'mon.

965
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
First one is always the toughest.

966
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,300
We made a lotta mistakes out there today.
All of us.

967
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,200
Me too.

968
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,500
No shit.

969
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,800
They were ready.

970
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,200
They've been playin' together
for three years.

971
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,100
We've been together for three weeks.
Lemme tell you somethin' else,

972
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,900
I still don't believe
that they're 38 points better than you.

973
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,600
I still don't believe
that they're the better team.

974
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,500
I would not trade you for them.

975
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,700
I want you to hold your heads up high.

976
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,800
We got nine games left.
We're just gonna have to work harder.

977
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,900
Shit, not me.

978
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,800
I don't need this shit.

979
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,000
I didn't just let 'em down.
I brought 'em down.

980
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:37,400
- I completely lost it.
- It's a long season, Seany.

981
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,600
I don't even know if I'll have enough
kids to field a team next week.

982
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:46,700
	Oh, they'll come back.

983
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:51,800
Do you remember how low
you used to get after a big loss?

984
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,400
You always took everything so personally.

985
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,400
Well, that's 'cause there was someone
on the other end of the dinner table

986
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,800
tellin' me how much I sucked.

987
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,400
Mom, that was the worst part about it.

988
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:12,400
yesterday,, when I was chewin'
those kids out, I sounded just like him.

989
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:35,200
All right, shut it down, gentlemen.
Shut it down!
