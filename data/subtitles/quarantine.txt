1
00:00:02,702 --> 00:00:04,727
- Come on, life sounds. Let's go.
- Okay.

2
00:00:04,727 --> 00:00:07,201
Mike down, mike down.
There you go, now go.

3
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:09,239
You'd think I'd never done this.
Ready?

4
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:11,843
Hey, wait a second. Ready.

5
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:13,877
Five, four, three...

6
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:15,811
Hi, I am Angela Vidal.

7
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:19,007
Come with us tonight as
we travel along with...

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,312
- Sorry.
- Okay.

9
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:24,047
- Ready?
- Yeah, wait a second.

10
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,021
You got a little hair thing. Hold on.

11
00:00:26,021 --> 00:00:28,182
Let me get that.

12
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:30,021
That right there.

13
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:32,993
- Okay, there we go.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,655
Okay.

15
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:38,904
Hold on.

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,770
Okay. Ready.

17
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,273
Hi, I am Angela Vidal.

18
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:48,573
Come with us tonight as we paint
the town red on The Night Shift.

19
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,009
Sorry, a little off my A-game.
I will get there.

20
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,518
That wasn't bad. The second part
just seemed a little pushed, though.

21
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,689
On tonight's Night Shift,
we're in Los Angeles...

22
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:02,692
...traveling along with that special
breed of hero we like to call...

23
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,055
...the fire department.

24
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:25,384
We should have come earlier.
We could be going with them.

25
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,721
Well, that's cool. You got it?

26
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:33,381
- Yeah, that's great. That was perfect.
- We will wait for them to get back.

27
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,561
- You prefer Bob or Robert...?
- Bob's good.

28
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,593
- Bob, okay, sorry. Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:40,164
Three, two, one.

30
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:43,597
Tell us, Bob, what's a normal night
here at the station?

31
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:45,498
This might surprise most people...

32
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:48,402
...but 85 percent of the calls
we go out on are medical.

33
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:51,509
It can be anything from chest pain
to more serious things.

34
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,475
How do you handle that
with ambulances and hospitals?

35
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:57,081
Most ambulances you see
are fire department.

36
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:59,081
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

37
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:01,811
And most firefighters
are also paramedics.

38
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:04,456
At least,
that's the direction it's going.

39
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:07,525
One more question, something
I am sure we're all wondering:

40
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:11,425
Do firefighters still slide down
those fabulous poles?

41
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:13,326
We sure do.

42
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:14,794
No turning back.

43
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:17,492
Tell my mom I loved her.

44
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:21,836
- See?
- That's not so bad.

45
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:25,135
I am glad I didn't wear a skirt.
That could really hurt your legs.

46
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:28,802
Tell me, Bob, how do you get down
when you're wearing a skirt?

47
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,046
Pantyhose help.

48
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,709
Pantyhose.

49
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:35,546
That's what they wear under their,
what, their turnouts.

50
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:36,813
- Exactly.
- Pantyhose.

51
00:02:36,813 --> 00:02:40,448
- Fire-retardant pantyhose.
- You heard it here.

52
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,218
- Can I do it one more time?
- Sure.

53
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:43,985
I will be right back, okay?

54
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,324
- We're going to the dining hall.
- All right.

55
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:49,662
- Couple of guys I want you to meet.
- Cool.

56
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:57,808
Hey.

57
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,473
- This is Jake.
- Hey.

58
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,706
- And Fletcher.
- Hi.

59
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:04,974
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:08,211
These are the men you will be
shadowing. Wherever they go, you go.

61
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:11,379
Cool. Please, oh, please, finish eating.
We will talk after.

62
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,185
- Well, would you like some?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:14,689
- Did you make it?
- We got...

64
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:16,259
I didn't make it.

65
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:17,895
Firemen are really good cooks.

66
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:19,724
- Yeah, that's what I hear.
- Exactly.

67
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:22,332
- You should try some of the food.
- Yeah, I am game.

68
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:24,901
- Please finish eating.
- We will get you a plate.

69
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,198
Great. Sounds great.

70
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,431
Just maybe un-tuck your shirt
and stick it up here.

71
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:33,043
- Okay. Okay.
- Clip it on your collar.

72
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,209
- You filming this?
- Yeah.

73
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,180
Elliot's been telling me
I never give him enough B-roll...

74
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,115
...so I am just going to shoot it all.

75
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,748
- Jake? Jake?
- Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:47,551
If you could keep
from rubbing into the mike too much...

77
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:49,786
- Sorry, yeah.
- Don't worry about the camera.

78
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,622
- Pretend it's not even there.
- Okay.

79
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,925
Can you say something?
Give me a level?

80
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,965
Yeah. Mike check, one...

81
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,626
You can just pretend it's not there.
Just talk free.

82
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,239
Can you say something
more compelling?

83
00:04:02,574 --> 00:04:04,042
I don't know what to say...

84
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,770
I mean, am I going to have
this thing on all the time?

85
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,039
Yeah, just watch what you say.
We will hear everything.

86
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,649
Shit.

87
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:14,609
You're probably not allowed
to swear on your station.

88
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:16,584
No. We can cut most of it out.

89
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:18,814
But it helps
if you're not dropping F-bombs.

90
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,653
Point noted. Filed right here.

91
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,788
So if I was to call this guy
an ass-monkey...

92
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:28,024
...that would be considered
a swear too, right?

93
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:31,235
It's going to be a long night.

94
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,495
- So this thing?
- Yeah?

95
00:04:32,495 --> 00:04:36,334
Is this some sort of torture device
when you don't get in your turnouts?

96
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,271
- That's what it is.
- Can you get it?

97
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,105
Yes. This is called a hook ladder.

98
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:42,747
We use this in the...
The firemen would use this...

99
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,473
- We should bring it down?
- Yes.

100
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:45,742
- Okay.
- All right.

101
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,975
Can you grab the hook?

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,144
So this was used
in the '20s and the '30s.

103
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:51,415
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:53,182
And as you can see...

105
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:56,192
...these are the rungs,
and the hook at the end...

106
00:04:56,192 --> 00:05:01,163
...they would grasp onto one window
and then pull themselves up.

107
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:05,168
And then when they got to that
windowsill, they would hook it again.

108
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:07,033
- And then pull themselves up.
- Okay.

109
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:09,197
Did you get the hook, Scott?
You see this?

110
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:12,105
Used in the '20s and '30s.
They stopped using it around...

111
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,211
- Hold it up higher.
- Replaced it...

112
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:15,641
- That's good, right?
- Good.

113
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,045
Replaced it
with a regular ladder that extends?

114
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:19,706
Yeah, and rope.

115
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,319
They must have tiny feet.
Those are little rungs.

116
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,821
Yeah. Firemen
were a lot smaller back then.

117
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,858
The fires were bigger
and they were smaller.

118
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:33,932
- Don't tell captain we took this down.
- I am not going to tell him I touched it.

119
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,965
I want to introduce you to somebody.
This is Wilshire. Mark.

120
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,329
- Good boy.
- Hey, Wilshire.

121
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,369
- Say hi.
- Dog right out of the cartoons.

122
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,509
Well, there's a reason
why the Dalmatians were in cartoons.

123
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,144
The fire department
has a great sense of tradition.

124
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:47,370
Yeah, we do.

125
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,343
Dalmatians
got along well with horses.

126
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:51,915
Important when the fire trucks
were horse-drawn.

127
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,516
Now they're used as mascots.

128
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:56,848
But what they're trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic.

129
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:58,923
- Kind of like Fletch.
- Yeah.

130
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,583
That's what I do, I run out there.
Sort of like what a siren does today.

131
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:06,697
Okay, well, Wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire.

132
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:08,389
- Stop, drop and roll.
- Yeah.

133
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,059
So let's just pretend
you're 5 years old and on fire.

134
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,329
- I am on fire.
- Wilshire's going to teach you.

135
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,064
Tell me what to do.

136
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:17,231
Okay. Wilshire.

137
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,036
Wilshire, mark. Stay.

138
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:22,511
Wilshire, drop.

139
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,706
Drop. Drop.

140
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:26,875
Wilshire, roll.

141
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,110
Wilshire, roll.

142
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,617
- Good.
- Look at that.

143
00:06:29,617 --> 00:06:32,120
Good boy. Good boy.

144
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,656
- I am going to live.
- Report.

145
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:36,584
You're not going to be on fire.

146
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:40,528
So it's stop, drop and roll,
in case you catch on fire. Wilshire.

147
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,896
- Yeah, you know, have some fun.
- You all hang out a lot?

148
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:45,697
- Yeah.
- You kind of live together.

149
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,237
Yeah, we definitely live together.
Close quarters.

150
00:06:48,237 --> 00:06:49,636
- Okay, good.
- Oh, ready?

151
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:52,471
So yeah, we have 48-hour shifts...

152
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,975
...so we have everything
we need in this place...

153
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,240
...from, you know,
a small gym to this handball court.

154
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,283
I will show it to you.

155
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,822
- It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,420
Sir, you got a call on the office line.

157
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,620
Can you pick up a call
on the office line?

158
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,992
Non-responder.

159
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,290
- Oh, shoot.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,230
- I was hoping we'd get a call.
- Yeah.

161
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,893
Not a big one, a little call
so we can see action.

162
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:20,264
- Exciting, I guess.
- Yeah.

163
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:22,670
Got to be annoying
when trying to finish a game.

164
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,934
Not if you're losing.

165
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,475
Every time, you know,
we go respond to a call...

166
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:28,136
...the points reset.

167
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:30,838
Depending on which side you're on,
it's sort of nice.

168
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,917
Works in your favor
from time to time?

169
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,245
Not in my favor.
What are you talking about?

170
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,752
I never lose.

171
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,447
I think I'd roller-skate
if I had access to this.

172
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:42,923
I can see you doing that. Yeah.

173
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,120
Okay, so this is where the men
store their boots and turnouts.

174
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,199
The pole hole is over here.

175
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:52,764
- The pole hole.
- Yeah, interesting name, I know.

176
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,701
- You got the locker room here.
- Yep.

177
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:56,000
You got the dorms here.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,165
Our viewers
always like to see action...

179
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:00,538
...so maybe we should go
into the locker room.

180
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:02,872
- Let's go in the locker room.
- You got it.

181
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,682
- Right this way.
- I was kidding, I was kidding.

182
00:08:06,682 --> 00:08:09,014
Okay, towel up, guys.
We got a female on deck.

183
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,884
- Female on the deck.
- Oh, my God.

184
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:14,048
That's Griffin.
He can't sing very well.

185
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,319
He's got one major talent,
so come this way.

186
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,896
- He's got a huge talent.
- We're not using this.

187
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:22,728
Here. We have different hoses at
the station, and this is the Griffin hose.

188
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,199
- Griffin hose.
- What the hell?

189
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,362
You know,
I hope that's a wide-angle lens.

190
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:29,235
Oh, my God.

191
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:30,500
Stay in there.

192
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,667
Hey, put that thing away.

193
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:35,836
This is adding a whole new meaning
to the term fireman's hose.

194
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:37,413
- Hey, hit the floor.
- Oh, my...

195
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,551
I understand
why there are no women here.

196
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:42,051
- Plenty of female firefighters.
- In this station?

197
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:43,482
No, not currently.

198
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,216
Okay, I think I can be a firefighter.

199
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:49,519
- Yeah, it's a lot harder than it seems.
- Keep the door closed.

200
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,855
You know what?
Pick something you're good at.

201
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,023
I bet you $10 I can do it better.
You all can be my witnesses.

202
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:56,861
- That's too easy. Ten bucks?
- Yeah.

203
00:08:56,861 --> 00:08:58,594
How about my place?

204
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:01,238
I think we're done here.
We got everything we need.

205
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,907
Here we go. Listen up.

206
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,043
Did you know
you were going to be on camera?

207
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,006
- Behind the line. Ready?
- Yeah.

208
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,908
- Ten bucks.
- You can't be in the way.

209
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:10,605
- I know.
- Get on that side.

210
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,544
I am just saying. You guys ready?

211
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,379
- You know what you're doing?
- Yes.

212
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:15,918
And go.

213
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,585
- Get in there.
- That's not nice.

214
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,692
That's not fair. She pushed.

215
00:09:21,692 --> 00:09:24,852
- She pushed.
- Haven't got that much time.

216
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,900
- Yes. You owe her 10 bucks, man.
- Ten dollars.

217
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,128
Pay up. Oh, that's embarrassing.

218
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:35,135
- Oh, this is embarrassing.
- That's really embarrassing.

219
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,731
Okay, rolling.

220
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:42,212
Just waiting
on something to happen.

221
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,442
You want to go back outside?
See what they're up to?

222
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,143
Why not?

223
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,889
- Careful.
- Thank you.

224
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,120
We're good.

225
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,427
You good?

226
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,730
I think they're talking about you.

227
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,395
Will you turn up his mike?

228
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:11,509
You didn't catch no eye.
Here, give me some of that.

229
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:14,309
I will tell you, all right?

230
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,408
A hundred bucks
says I can bang her by the morning.

231
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:21,075
- Oh, come on.
- I will take that bet.

232
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,514
You're so busted.

233
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:24,780
Nice mike.

234
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,826
Missed a spot.

235
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,989
- Sorry, what?
- I said you missed a spot.

236
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,100
Oh, I know how to hit the spot.
Don't you worry about that.

237
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,674
I will hold your camera.
You go kick his ass, okay?

238
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,975
That's how you do pick and roll.

239
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:55,677
Oh, yeah? Is that how you do it?

240
00:10:55,677 --> 00:10:58,119
He will show you how to do it later.

241
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:00,981
It's nighttime here...

242
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:04,322
...and the firefighters take turns
sleeping in these rooms here.

243
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:08,660
But if the alarm rings, they can be up
and on the truck in under one minute.

244
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,028
Let's check out the room.

245
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:15,130
Can you get in here?

246
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:19,876
It's like my college dorm
without the pink.

247
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,883
Attention, 222 Truck 16.

248
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,076
- Watch your back.
- Hey.

249
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:30,380
Looks like you got your call.

250
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,817
- Just try to keep up.
- You okay?

251
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,756
- We're going to the pole hole.
- Come on, come on.

252
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,095
- Got it?
- What you want to do?

253
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,893
I can't slide down there.

254
00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:44,229
Come here, come here,
come this way.

255
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,532
Careful, okay?
We have to get on that truck.

256
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,572
- There are like 15 stairs.
- I got it.

257
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:51,767
- You be careful.
- Keep going, keep going.

258
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:53,841
- It's this way?
- Yeah. Yeah, keep going.

259
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,707
- Be careful.
- Make a quick right.

260
00:11:55,707 --> 00:11:58,110
Make a quick right, baby.

261
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,988
Just jump in the back.

262
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,793
- Jump in.
- Buckle up.

263
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:13,429
- We're almost in.
- You guys in?

264
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:15,692
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Yep?

265
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,495
Nice job.

266
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:27,876
What kind of call is this?

267
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:29,378
Probably just a medical.

268
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,640
- Okay.
- We will find out when we get there.

269
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,909
You seem to have kept shooting.

270
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,588
Ready?

271
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,386
Ready, set. Ready, set.

272
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,886
Okay, good.

273
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:48,158
Most little girls want to be ballerinas
or princesses when they grow up.

274
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:51,735
I used to tell my mom, "Someday,
I am going to grow up and be a fireman."

275
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:54,668
Tonight, I am truly living the dream.

276
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:57,399
It's so loud,
I don't think we can use any of it.

277
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,272
Scott, I am still living the dream.

278
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:06,110
Thirty-seventeen, go ahead.

279
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,990
All right, we got a eight at 3 o'clock.

280
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,029
Keep calling out numbers.
What are you doing?

281
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:21,688
Well, Jake's the engineer.

282
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:24,301
He's actually
a third-generation engineer...

283
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:26,596
...but I have the most important job.

284
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:27,830
Navigating?

285
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,668
No,
I am in charge of the chick-o-meter.

286
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:32,470
When I see a girl, I rate them.

287
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,636
So if I say
there's a eight at 3 o'clock...

288
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:38,613
...the guys know
they better look to the right.

289
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,779
You know, it's really funny. I always
thought firemen were so dignified.

290
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,515
Oh, no, no.
I signed up for brave and courageous.

291
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:50,822
- I don't do dignified.
- Yeah, I think we get that by now.

292
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,225
I see a nine at 2.

293
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,698
- Oh, we got a nine at 2.
- Yeah.

294
00:13:57,698 --> 00:14:00,861
Whoa, that's a dude.

295
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,674
It's called a chick-o-meter,
not a dick-o-meter.

296
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,034
I think we're good.

297
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:11,250
You're fired. You can't talk anymore.

298
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,152
So where do you think
the problem is?

299
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:22,088
Do you think it's over there,
around the corner?

300
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:23,659
Or maybe around there?

301
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,227
You're rotten, you know that?

302
00:14:25,227 --> 00:14:28,365
To the core, baby. To the core.

303
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:41,635
What are you taking with you?

304
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,413
Tools.

305
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:47,677
Really anything we might need
to break a lock or open a door.

306
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,120
- You're the one who called this in?
- Yeah.

307
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,414
Come, follow me.

308
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:53,216
Look at Probie's new turnouts.

309
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:55,655
I didn't know
they made them that new.

310
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,595
We're almost to the building.

311
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:01,392
Police are here. Might be more
serious than we thought.

312
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,158
Probably not.

313
00:15:13,711 --> 00:15:15,873
A woman was screaming
bloody murder up there.

314
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,312
- It's Mrs. Espinoza.
- Two cops are up there.

315
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,543
- When did they get here?
- Five minutes ago.

316
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:22,982
- What's that sound?
- Sound of the building.

317
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,245
It's very old.

318
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:27,085
- He insists on fixing everything.
- Wanda, please.

319
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,056
- What apartment number?
- It's up here.

320
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,594
- Go back to your apartments.
- We heard screams.

321
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:34,062
Well, at least get out of the way.

322
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:36,496
- Are they with you?
- Yeah. They're shadowing us.

323
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,328
Then they're your responsibility.

324
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:40,802
I tell you not to film something,
don't film it.

325
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:43,498
- I tell you to get lost, you get lost.
- No problem.

326
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,337
Here on the second floor on the right.
It's an old woman, lives alone.

327
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:50,311
Probably fell.
Neighbors heard screams, called it in.

328
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,812
What are those people doing?

329
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:54,645
You wouldn't believe
the way she screamed. It was crazy.

330
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:57,311
Neighbors say she's weird.
Doesn't talk to anybody.

331
00:15:57,311 --> 00:15:58,649
She hasn't made a sound.

332
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,451
- Who are they?
- They're with Fire.

333
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:03,618
- I told them not to get in the way.
- Great. That's all we need.

334
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,099
Hello, ma'am, can you hear me?
It's L.A.P.D.

335
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,534
Ma'am, open up the door.

336
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,767
I am here with paramedics.
We're going to come in to help you.

337
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:22,140
If you're near the door,
I need you to move away from it.

338
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,874
- Hey, I got the keys.
- Then get in here, sir. Come on.

339
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:26,278
- 2A.
- Help us out here.

340
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,750
Just a second. Yeah, here we are.

341
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,822
She must have added locks.

342
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:38,293
- I am going to do an intro.
- Yeah, you're good.

343
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:42,024
Okay. We're standing
outside an elderly woman's apartment.

344
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:44,293
Neighbors heard screams
and called 911.

345
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:46,734
The fire department's
about to begin the rescue.

346
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:50,533
Police say that she lives alone,
she's not very social...

347
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,673
I need you to get back,
brother, please, this time.

348
00:16:55,673 --> 00:16:57,975
Ma'am, we're the police.

349
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,575
We're here to help you.

350
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:03,083
Ma'am? Ma'am?

351
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,346
Ma'am, can you hear us?

352
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,025
- What's her name?
- Mrs. Espinoza.

353
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:12,560
There's no need to worry,
Mrs. Espinoza. We're here to help you.

354
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,425
Okay, ma'am.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,365
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

356
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:19,867
Everything's going to be fine.

357
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,667
Ma'am? We're right here, ma'am.

358
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,900
- It's okay.
- Ma'am.

359
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,846
- Jesus.
- Are you okay?

360
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,538
You okay? Come here.

361
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,207
Ma'am, it's... We're the police.

362
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,818
- Ma'am.
- We're here to help you.

363
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:41,250
It's all right, is there anybody else
in the apartment? Any more animals?

364
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,794
- It's going to be okay, ma'am.
- All right.

365
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:45,952
It's okay, all right?

366
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,597
It's all right.

367
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,692
Ma'am, ma'am.

368
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,893
It's all right. It's all right.

369
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,128
All right. Okay, okay.

370
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,430
Okay, all right.

371
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,596
All right. Are you hurt?

372
00:17:56,596 --> 00:17:58,742
All right, are you hurt?

373
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:00,640
- No.
- Okay, okay.

374
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,746
We're going to get you
some medical help.

375
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,440
No, no, no. Please, don't.

376
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,413
No, are you okay?
Are you okay, ma'am?

377
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:10,749
No, no, no.

378
00:18:10,749 --> 00:18:13,084
Okay, okay, okay.

379
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:16,250
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay, all right?

380
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,759
- Okay, just relax.
- Just relax.

381
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,728
- Just calm down.
- Just calm down.

382
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:23,891
- Turn that thing off.
- Turn that off.

383
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:26,230
Give us some room.

384
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,261
- Come on, man.
- Gloves on, Danny.

385
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:29,930
Where's that blood coming from?

386
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,976
Hey, chief,
we're going to need an ambulance here.

387
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:34,305
Copy. On our way.

388
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:37,449
Mrs. Espinoza,
it's all going to be all right.

389
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,949
All right,
I just need you to calm down, okay?

390
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,011
It's all right.
Nobody's here to hurt you.

391
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:47,282
We can't help you
unless you calm down.

392
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:50,826
- An ambulance is on its way right now.
- All right.

393
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:53,329
Let's just clear a space.

394
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:57,127
Danny, get everybody out of here
until the ambulance gets here.

395
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:06,805
Get her off. Get off. Get her off.

396
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,112
Get him on the floor.
Get him on the floor.

397
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:14,444
No. We are not moving him.

398
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,487
- We are waiting for the ambulance.
- Do you see an ambulance?

399
00:19:17,487 --> 00:19:19,123
We have to get him downstairs.

400
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:22,782
- All right. Come on, come on. Okay.
- Grab the arm.

401
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:24,484
Come on. Come on, I got it.

402
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:26,824
Come on, lean down.

403
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:28,625
I got her. I got her.

404
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,232
Let's go.

405
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,368
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Go, Scott.

406
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:34,335
Move that camera.

407
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:35,972
Come on, let's go, let's go.

408
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:38,973
- Did we get that?
- Move, move, move.

409
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:41,407
- Let's go, open that door.
- Let's go.

410
00:19:41,407 --> 00:19:44,208
- Be careful down the stairs.
- Hang in there, buddy.

411
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,577
Tape everything, you hear me?
Tape everything.

412
00:19:46,577 --> 00:19:49,016
Move. Move. Move.

413
00:19:49,016 --> 00:19:50,848
- Open the door.
- It's locked.

414
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:53,388
How can that be?

415
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,160
- Open it, open it.
- Open.

416
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,318
- What do you mean?
- They won't let us out.

417
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,362
- Who locked those doors?
- It's not us.

418
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:03,228
Something is closing it from outside.

419
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,932
We need an ambulance.

420
00:20:05,932 --> 00:20:09,403
Open the door. Open the door.

421
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:12,202
Is there a doctor in the house?

422
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:13,844
- You're a doctor?
- I am a vet.

423
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,240
- Come on.
- Get over here.

424
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,041
- Put some pressure on that wound.
- Give me that rag.

425
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,275
Get something.

426
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,417
- Back up, back up.
- Cover him up.

427
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,520
Why are they locking
if there's a fire?

428
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,384
There's no fire, Wanda.
There is no fire.

429
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,890
We have an officer down.
We have an officer down.

430
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,359
I need an ambulance immediately.
I need backup.

431
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,395
Does anybody copy?

432
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,560
I have a fucking hurt officer here.

433
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,202
What's going on?
Hey, what's happening?

434
00:20:39,637 --> 00:20:40,763
Why can't we leave?

435
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:42,701
I know no more
than you do right now.

436
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,932
Back up.

437
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,770
My partner's on the floor bleeding.

438
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,242
- Quiet.
- Please remain calm.

439
00:20:49,242 --> 00:20:51,882
We are working hard
to get you out of the building.

440
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:54,040
Please follow
the officers' instructions.

441
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,709
This will all be over shortly.

442
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:58,116
- What will all be over?
- What's going on?

443
00:20:58,116 --> 00:20:59,951
Why are we locked in our building?

444
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:01,648
Be calm. That's what that means.

445
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,954
Please remain calm and everything's...
Get the camera out of here.

446
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,621
Don't touch the camera.
We have every right to shoot.

447
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:10,825
- I am tired of the camera.
- People need to see what's going on.

448
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,627
I am in charge here. Turn it off...

449
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:15,636
If you were, you'd be worried
about getting your partner out.

450
00:21:15,636 --> 00:21:17,137
Not whether we're shooting.

451
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:20,403
You are two steps
from being arrested, okay?

452
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,068
This man will bleed to death.

453
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:26,012
Everybody stop fighting, okay?
Stop fighting.

454
00:21:26,012 --> 00:21:28,674
We need to get this man out of here.

455
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,778
- What's behind that door?
- That's a fabric workshop.

456
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:34,186
- What is it?
- Fabric, fabric.

457
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:37,920
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yeah, through the back. Come, come.

458
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:43,195
- Keep them back.
- Please, please.

459
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:45,927
You're not helping the situation.
Okay?

460
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,095
My husband's outside.
Said there are cops.

461
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:50,707
Blocked off the street.
He was getting antibiotics.

462
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:52,866
We got to do something...

463
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,477
What the fuck.

464
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,045
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus.

465
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:59,307
- Oh, Jesus, Fletch.
- Oh, my God.

466
00:21:59,307 --> 00:22:00,973
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay, come on.

467
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,314
- Don't move him.
- No, we have to, we have to.

468
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:05,854
- Don't move him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

469
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,621
All right, he's still got a pulse.

470
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:09,852
Shit.

471
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:12,189
Get the vet over here.
Get the vet now.

472
00:22:12,189 --> 00:22:14,958
- Vet, here, now.
- Get over here.

473
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,724
- Come here.
- Keep an eye on him.

474
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,869
He's still got a pulse.
Take care of him.

475
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,163
Okay, back away.

476
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,739
All right. Come with me, let's go.

477
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,172
Come on, come on.
You two stay here, all right?

478
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:26,402
Stay here.

479
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,238
Keep an eye on my partner, please.

480
00:22:28,238 --> 00:22:29,903
Come on.

481
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,184
Let's get upstairs.

482
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,153
Come on, let's get upstairs.

483
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:39,118
I am coming.

484
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,997
The sound's coming from in there.

485
00:22:49,997 --> 00:22:51,726
Okay.

486
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,471
Move over.

487
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,825
Oh, Scott, don't.

488
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:53,220
Don't go in there, Scott.

489
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,923
Scott.

490
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:09,843
- Watch out.
- Oh, my God.

491
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:19,623
She's dead.

492
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:21,759
She's dead.

493
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,587
- She's dead.
- What?

494
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,195
What are you two doing here?
Get the camera back.

495
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:28,490
We need to get you guys out of here.

496
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,295
Ma'am. Ma'am? Ma'am? Ma'am?

497
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:34,336
Ma'am, listen to me.
Can you hear me, Miss Espinoza?

498
00:24:34,336 --> 00:24:37,030
I need you to stay
right where you are, okay?

499
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:38,971
All right?
We want to help you here.

500
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:42,010
Put your hands in the air for me,
Mrs. Espinoza.

501
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,273
Okay? Put your hands in the air.

502
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,881
Oh, my God.

503
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:01,955
Let's go.

504
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,530
Put the gun down. Let's go.

505
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,968
- She was coming right at us.
- Yeah.

506
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:10,198
- You saw that, right?
- Yeah, I saw it.

507
00:25:10,198 --> 00:25:13,037
Shit. Okay.

508
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:15,873
Okay, you saw that, right?

509
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,741
Okay. All right.

510
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:21,352
Let's just get downstairs.
Let's get downstairs.

511
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,211
Hey, hey, hey.

512
00:25:24,211 --> 00:25:27,551
Easy, easy, easy.

513
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,200
Did you get that?

514
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,740
Yeah.

515
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,119
Show it to me.

516
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,779
- Look, don't worry. I got it.
- I said show it to me.

517
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,826
Okay. Okay, okay.

518
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,223
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I think...

519
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:43,366
Is everything okay?

520
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:47,236
We should probably
just get down the stairs, okay?

521
00:26:48,405 --> 00:26:50,965
I know, I know, I know.

522
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:53,633
- Oh, my God.
- We just have to get downstairs.

523
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,246
Fire department.

524
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,644
I need you to open up the door.

525
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,513
Fire department.

526
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:13,693
Fire department. We need everyone
to gather downstairs in the atrium.

527
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:15,593
Yes, we need you to go downstairs.

528
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:19,430
- Was there a fire?
- No, it's just a precaution.

529
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:21,868
Just a precaution for what?

530
00:27:21,868 --> 00:27:24,667
Look,
we just need you to get downstairs.

531
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:31,808
Does this have anything to do
with the cable being out?

532
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:35,145
- Come on, let's go.
- What? Wait, wait, wait.

533
00:27:35,145 --> 00:27:38,982
- What if I don't want to go?
- Then I'd be forced to force you.

534
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,152
Hi. I am with the fire department.

535
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:44,659
We need everyone
to gather in the atrium.

536
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,998
Do you speak English?

537
00:27:49,998 --> 00:27:51,567
Do you speak English?

538
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:53,703
English? No.

539
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:56,901
Okay,
we need everybody downstairs, so...

540
00:27:56,901 --> 00:28:02,137
All right, there's people down there,
and we need you two to go there.

541
00:28:02,137 --> 00:28:04,644
You understand?

542
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,580
Fire department.

543
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,061
Fire department.

544
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:22,957
Ma'am?

545
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,229
Hello, ma'am?

546
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,240
Ma'am, I am with the fire department.

547
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,848
We need you to quickly and calmly
walk down to the lobby, please.

548
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,680
Excuse me, ma'am.

549
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,425
Ma'am.

550
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,125
Ma'am,
we need you to get downstairs, okay?

551
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,624
What's wrong with her?

552
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:57,392
I don't know.

553
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,567
- You want to give me a hand?
- Yeah.

554
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,403
- I don't know that that's a good idea.
- She needs help.

555
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:06,976
Just grab her.

556
00:29:06,976 --> 00:29:09,739
Okay. Now lift her up.

557
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:11,705
Okay.

558
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:14,607
We're just taking you downstairs,
okay, ma'am?

559
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:16,376
All right?

560
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,720
Oh, Jesus.

561
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:24,785
Okay? Okay?

562
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:26,105
Okay? Yeah.

563
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,734
Oh, she's really sick.

564
00:29:43,347 --> 00:29:46,784
Holy shit. Did you see that?

565
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:51,911
That rat just totally came after me.
Hey, did you see that?

566
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,951
Come on.

567
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,828
Un-fucking-believable.

568
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:03,128
- Oh, my God, look at Elise.
- Somebody grab that chair.

569
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:07,261
- What's wrong with her?
- Set her down, set her down.

570
00:30:07,261 --> 00:30:10,463
Can't stop the bleeding.
Get him to a hospital. He's going to die.

571
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:12,371
Stay here.
I am going to check the exit.

572
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:14,545
No, no, wait.
We are under strict orders...

573
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:17,009
We're under orders
to stay in the hall. Help me.

574
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:19,980
Fuck your orders, all right?
My friend's dying.

575
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:22,983
- I am coming out.
- Do not...

576
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:26,281
- Didn't catch that. You're breaking up.
- Two people have died.

577
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:30,051
Two others are in need of medical
care. Police have blocked off the exit.

578
00:30:30,051 --> 00:30:33,720
They have given us no explanation.
We're trying to find a way out.

579
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,990
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

580
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,997
- Get away from the window.
- Go, go.

581
00:30:36,997 --> 00:30:39,397
You need to remain in the building.

582
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,638
We have civilians in here.

583
00:30:58,222 --> 00:30:59,383
Briana, don't.

584
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:03,323
Attention, please.
Do not try to leave the building.

585
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:06,894
All exits have been sealed.
Just stay calm.

586
00:31:06,894 --> 00:31:10,261
We will send someone in there
shortly to assess the situation.

587
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:13,268
Thank you for your cooperation.

588
00:31:13,268 --> 00:31:15,769
What are we supposed to do?

589
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:18,932
- What are we supposed to do?
- Just wait.

590
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:34,781
There's five there. What happened?

591
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,970
Sir, sir, sir.

592
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,198
Give me your headphones.

593
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:58,108
No, you're not getting my question.

594
00:31:58,108 --> 00:31:59,579
Not getting my question.

595
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:01,877
I am asking
why they're calling this a BNC.

596
00:32:01,877 --> 00:32:03,713
- What's a BNC?
- I don't know.

597
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,412
Hello?

598
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:06,886
Hello?

599
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:08,423
Hello?

600
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:09,787
- Hello?
- Hello?

601
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:12,451
- Is somebody there?
- Hello?

602
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,724
Honey, hello?

603
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,000
Why is the phone breaking?
Why is it not working?

604
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:23,934
- What's a BNC?
- Who said anything about...?

605
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:25,597
- You. You're still miked.
- Wait.

606
00:32:25,597 --> 00:32:26,835
- What?
- Don't jump to...

607
00:32:26,835 --> 00:32:28,672
What's a BNC? What is it?

608
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,246
They're calling this a BNC?

609
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,342
A biological,
nuclear or chemical threat.

610
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:35,951
- Oh, my God.
- Nuclear?

611
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:37,609
- What?
- No, don't worry, okay?

612
00:32:37,609 --> 00:32:40,780
- It's more common than you think.
- Supposed to be reassuring?

613
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,258
Our cell phones don't work.
Neither do the TVs or our radios.

614
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:46,420
- Why are they isolating us?
- I don't know.

615
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,996
My daughter has a fever.

616
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:50,292
- What does she have?
- They're pointing guns.

617
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:51,958
You can't keep us trapped here.

618
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,762
- We're all trapped.
- That's right.

619
00:32:53,762 --> 00:32:56,498
We are all trapped in here.
Step over here.

620
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:58,038
- Here.
- What will they do?

621
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,710
- Step over here, please.
- Jake, Jake.

622
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,679
There might be... From the office on
the second floor, there is an overhang.

623
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,148
Maybe we can use
to jump down to the patio.

624
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,053
- Let's go.
- I show you.

625
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,890
I am going with you.

626
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:20,457
Don't turn the light on.

627
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,962
I don't want anyone knowing
we're in here.

628
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,766
Careful.

629
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,347
- When I open the window...
- Yeah?

630
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:50,221
- go to the right side and jump.

631
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,989
It's only two and a half meters.

632
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,864
Get away from the window.

633
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,369
- For your own safety.
- No.

634
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,234
- Step away.
- Wait, wait, wait.

635
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:05,842
- Step away.
- Wait, listen.

636
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:08,342
Can you see me? Can you see me?

637
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:12,005
- What are you doing?
- We have a film crew in here.

638
00:34:12,005 --> 00:34:14,878
Tell your boss
we have a TV crew in here.

639
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,853
We are filming this. Please, wait.

640
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:21,184
People are going to see
what you're doing to us.

641
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,318
- Why can't we go out?
- People are going to see this.

642
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,797
Please. Wait.

643
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:33,936
What are you doing in here?

644
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,266
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- Knew what?

645
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:38,534
That they're sealing us in here.

646
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,074
What the fuck is this?

647
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,039
- What is going on?
- You tell us.

648
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,617
I don't know anything and don't you
fucking put your hands on me again.

649
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:51,721
I don't know anything, okay?

650
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:53,621
Get this fucking camera out.

651
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:55,782
- Don't touch me.
- Don't touch that camera.

652
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:58,121
We need to show people
what's going on here.

653
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:00,126
- Only proof we have.
- Don't you get it?

654
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:03,597
You're locked in here like us.
You think they give a shit about you?

655
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:05,998
- Step back.
- Hey, hey, hey.

656
00:35:05,998 --> 00:35:08,570
- Let's all just calm down, all right?
- Shut up.

657
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,469
- Put the gun down.
- Shut up.

658
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:14,336
Go back downstairs now, okay?

659
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:15,978
Yeah, okay, okay, but...

660
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,739
Shut up.

661
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:20,610
Damn. Go back downstairs.

662
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,684
This thing is getting to all of us.

663
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,081
No one here
is going to hurt you, okay?

664
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,849
We're trying to get out.
That's all we're trying to do.

665
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,425
Just put the gun down.

666
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,621
I am sorry, man.

667
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:39,293
- I am sorry, all right?
- Yeah.

668
00:35:39,293 --> 00:35:41,097
I was just freaked out. Let's go.

669
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,967
- We all are.
- Go downstairs, okay?

670
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:46,201
- All right?
- Yeah, let's get downstairs, man.

671
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,668
Shit.

672
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:50,936
Fuck.

673
00:36:07,998 --> 00:36:10,228
Grab his legs, okay?
Come on, let's go.

674
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,492
What we will do
is we will roll him on his side.

675
00:36:12,492 --> 00:36:16,197
We just have to be really careful.

676
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:20,367
- What time is it?
- One-thirty-seven.

677
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:24,346
Five, four, three...

678
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,648
It's 1:37 in the morning,
and everyone is scared.

679
00:36:27,648 --> 00:36:30,581
They have given us no information,
cut off communication...

680
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:34,418
...from walkie-talkies and cell phones
to the building's cable and Internet.

681
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:37,652
The people trapped here,
myself included...

682
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:40,318
...can't help but ask why.

683
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:08,358
How's he doing?

684
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,289
Well, he's not good.

685
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,425
Yeah.

686
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:23,900
Yeah.

687
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,976
Excuse me. It's Terrence, right?

688
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:30,112
- No, Lawrence.
- Lawrence, right.

689
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:34,081
Listen, I have got a ton of Vicodin
in my apartment, if that will help.

690
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:35,650
Yeah, that's going to help.

691
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,719
I will just...
I will grab a bunch of stuff.

692
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,221
I basically got a pharmacy up there.

693
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:45,594
You can't arrest me for that,
because of self-incrimination...

694
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:49,324
Sir, you are the least
of my worries right now, okay?

695
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:51,797
- All right, I was just asking.
- Go.

696
00:37:51,797 --> 00:37:53,994
Do what you're going to do, please.

697
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:57,538
I am going. I am going.

698
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,005
You ever seen
anything like this before?

699
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:08,014
No, I have never
seen anything like this.

700
00:38:08,014 --> 00:38:10,483
Mostly because I am a vet.

701
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:14,250
I don't usually treat people.
Dogs and cats, mostly.

702
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,860
All I can really do is I can dress
their wounds and try to comfort them.

703
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:19,824
How are the injured men doing?

704
00:38:19,824 --> 00:38:22,829
They both lost a lot of blood,
and the fireman over here...

705
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:27,369
...he's got a bunch of broken bones
and probable internal bleeding.

706
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:34,335
Apparently, Mrs. Espinoza attacked
and bit them in some kind of a fit.

707
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:38,141
But honestly,
I find that a little hard to believe...

708
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:43,309
...that an old lady could do
something like this to two grown men.

709
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,885
Ready? Ready to film?

710
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,123
Okay.

711
00:38:49,123 --> 00:38:51,818
- What's your name?
- Briana.

712
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:55,454
Briana, that's a very pretty name.
How old are you, Briana?

713
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:59,159
- Five.
- And who do you live with?

714
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:02,898
With my mom
and my dad and my dog, Max.

715
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,735
Max. I haven't met Max. Where is he?

716
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:08,878
My dad took him to the vet
because he's sick.

717
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:11,742
- You sound a little sick yourself.
- Yeah.

718
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:15,646
- She's had it for weeks, it's not like...
- You know what?

719
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:19,221
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep
you quiet while I interview Briana.

720
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:22,188
It confuses the audience
when people talk from off-camera.

721
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:24,487
- Oh, God, I am sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

722
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,994
- I will interview you afterwards.
- No, that's fine.

723
00:39:26,994 --> 00:39:28,494
- Okay.
- We don't need that.

724
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:30,657
Okay, thank you.

725
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:33,201
I don't like being sick.

726
00:39:33,201 --> 00:39:35,931
Yeah, I don't like being sick either.

727
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,005
Briana, you're a very brave girl...

728
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:40,574
...and I am really happy
we got a chance to meet.

729
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:41,836
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

730
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:43,945
She's been fearless
since she was little.

731
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,282
She's an incredibly strong child.

732
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:48,012
Okay? Okay.

733
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:50,619
Why don't you just start
by introducing yourselves?

734
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:53,916
Well, I am Ber... I am Bernard.
This is my roommate, Sadie.

735
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:55,284
And this is Martini.

736
00:39:55,284 --> 00:39:57,552
And how long
have you lived in the building?

737
00:39:57,552 --> 00:39:59,195
I have lived here six years.

738
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:01,092
I have been here two and a half years.

739
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:03,391
And what do you do for a living?

740
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:04,760
I am an opera teacher.

741
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,063
Sadie's my best student, my protégé.

742
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:13,976
- Oh, my God.
- Fletcher.

743
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,940
Where's the vet?

744
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,239
Oh, my God.

745
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,713
Where the hell is the doctor?

746
00:40:19,713 --> 00:40:22,045
I got him, got him, got him.

747
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,820
Hold him, hold him.
Hold his neck, hold his neck.

748
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,081
What is that?

749
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:29,954
- Hold it over, hold his neck.
- Go, go, go.

750
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:32,152
Oh, my God, is he still alive?

751
00:40:32,152 --> 00:40:35,126
Hold him still, hold him still.
He's going to go down.

752
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,666
Martini.

753
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,827
Sadie, stay here. Stay.

754
00:40:41,827 --> 00:40:44,838
No, no, stay here, stay here.
No, the dog will come back.

755
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:46,806
Martini.

756
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:48,568
Hold him.

757
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,018
- Okay, I have to show you something.
- What?

758
00:41:01,224 --> 00:41:03,021
Have to show you something.
Just a sec.

759
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:04,853
I think I know what this is.

760
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:10,295
- Come, come look, look, look.
- Oh, Jesus.

761
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:13,266
Her tear ducts and salivary glands
are constantly flowing.

762
00:41:13,266 --> 00:41:15,836
She seems
to be unable to swallow or speak.

763
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:17,597
She has a fever, she's confused.

764
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:20,266
She has some degree
of paralysis and delirium.

765
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:24,005
These are all rabies symptoms.

766
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:25,614
- Are you sure?
- I am a vet.

767
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:28,547
Never seen it in humans,
but I know what rabies look like.

768
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:31,186
Are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies?

769
00:41:31,186 --> 00:41:32,981
Tears, saliva, fever.

770
00:41:32,981 --> 00:41:36,523
Tears, saliva, fever.
They have what she has.

771
00:41:36,523 --> 00:41:39,891
But here's the thing. Rabies
takes months for symptoms to show.

772
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:43,362
This is taking minutes.
I mean, rabies never acts this fast.

773
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:45,331
How does rabies spread?
Through bites?

774
00:41:45,331 --> 00:41:48,994
No, it's passed through anything wet.
Blood, saliva, any mucous membrane.

775
00:41:48,994 --> 00:41:52,233
So if you get their blood on you,
you're okay.

776
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,137
But if you get their blood on you...

777
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:56,643
...and it gets into a cut,
into your mouth, eyes...

778
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:59,077
...then you're not okay.

779
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,012
How's it cured?

780
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:03,677
No, there's no cure.

781
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:05,844
People get shots in their stomach.

782
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,512
Before symptoms starts showing.

783
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:11,684
Once symptoms show,
rabies is 100 percent fatal.

784
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:14,556
Shit.

785
00:42:14,556 --> 00:42:17,496
Yeah, shit.

786
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:22,528
- Where are you going? Where?
- I am going up to my apartment.

787
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:24,400
- What?
- I am going upstairs.

788
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,701
You can't do that.

789
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,036
- Why?
- Come down.

790
00:42:27,036 --> 00:42:28,336
- Why?
- What do you mean?

791
00:42:28,336 --> 00:42:30,672
- Why can't I go?
- We going to do this all night?

792
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:32,907
- You know why?
- Because it's not safe there.

793
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:35,710
Oh, yeah,
because it's really safe down here.

794
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,409
- You're drunk.
- You know what?

795
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:40,715
It seems to me, if this is spreading,
maybe we should separate...

796
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:42,882
...instead of sitting here
in a big group.

797
00:42:42,882 --> 00:42:45,960
You done? You finished?

798
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,391
- You done?
- You know what?

799
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:52,264
I have a God-given right to protect
myself as I see fit, so you know what?

800
00:42:52,264 --> 00:42:54,300
- I am going to go upstairs...
- Step back.

801
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,371
I am going to go and I am
going to barricade the shit out of it.

802
00:42:57,371 --> 00:43:00,942
- Where do you think they're going?
- You can all sit here and rot.

803
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:02,942
Oh, you are so close to going to jail.

804
00:43:02,942 --> 00:43:06,605
- Are you some kind of affirmative...?
- You are so close to going to jail.

805
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:08,114
- Hey.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

806
00:43:08,114 --> 00:43:09,911
- What?
- Where are you going?

807
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:12,487
Look, this lets out
right next to our apartment.

808
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:15,318
We want to see if there's anything
on the news about this.

809
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:16,822
- But the cable's out.
- Cable?

810
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:19,393
We still use rabbit ears on our TV.

811
00:43:19,393 --> 00:43:23,157
We're going with you.
Wait, wait, wait, we're going with you.

812
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,934
It's just up here to the right.

813
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,309
You're good?

814
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:37,811
- Stop. Just stop.
- What?

815
00:43:37,811 --> 00:43:39,278
Go back downstairs.

816
00:43:39,278 --> 00:43:41,940
The door locked behind me.

817
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:44,614
Just stay there.

818
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,978
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

819
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:48,885
Hey, look out.

820
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,851
- Oh, my God.
- Look out.

821
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:54,155
No, no, no.

822
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,327
We can't just open the door. We need
something to hold the dog back with.

823
00:44:01,327 --> 00:44:05,407
- Find something.
- There's a fire extinguisher.

824
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:08,641
Oh, my God.

825
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,012
Stop, stop.

826
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:13,842
Listen.

827
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:19,422
Turn it off, Scott. Turn it off.

828
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,190
Oh, I forgot something.

829
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,692
- Shouldn't we shut the door?
- Close the door.

830
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:29,329
- Okay.
- I left the music on.

831
00:44:29,329 --> 00:44:30,967
Folk music.

832
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:33,126
The TV's back here.

833
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:35,032
All right.

834
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,068
Okay.

835
00:44:38,474 --> 00:44:41,034
It usually takes
a couple of seconds to...

836
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:43,371
There we go, all right.

837
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:45,811
- Fiddle with this...
- Make sure that...

838
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:47,472
No, I know what I am doing.

839
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:49,516
- No, I am...
- Yeah, I know, all right?

840
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:51,847
...third hour of our coverage.
There.

841
00:44:51,847 --> 00:44:54,820
There it is.
...receiving conflicting reports.

842
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,094
- hind me was comp... Evacuated...

843
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:03,996
- that the CDC...

844
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:06,693
Chief.

845
00:45:06,693 --> 00:45:10,327
Tell us why the CDC
is entering the building.

846
00:45:10,606 --> 00:45:14,338
Precaution.
Everyone's been evacuated.

847
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:17,005
What?

848
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,280
Why would he broadcast that?

849
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,074
Why would he say that?

850
00:45:21,074 --> 00:45:23,878
What the fuck is going on here?

851
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:28,121
- What happened?
- Power's out.

852
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:30,726
Oh, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

853
00:45:30,726 --> 00:45:34,420
- What was that?
- Quiet.

854
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,202
Sadie, stay with me.
Sadie, come here.

855
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,028
Sadie, come over here.

856
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:47,202
Stay with me. It cannot be.

857
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,367
- Stay with me.
- You got to close that door.

858
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:51,514
Sadie, look out.

859
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,206
- Get off me.
- Oh, my God.

860
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:58,148
Get off of me.

861
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,222
Bernard, stay with me.

862
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:14,469
Hit her again.

863
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,940
Oh, my God.

864
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,922
Angela, you have blood
all over your shirt.

865
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:09,213
- Scott.
- What?

866
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,322
Scott.

867
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:18,233
What do you want?

868
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:21,838
You okay?

869
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,068
Yeah, I am just fine.

870
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:27,675
I mean, I just killed something
with my camera...

871
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:30,335
...and, you know, I am just fine.

872
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:32,242
Yeah.

873
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,246
Scott.

874
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:38,655
What, Angela? What you?

875
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:41,416
I need a moment now.

876
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,358
I am with you.

877
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:57,737
- I am with you, you're with me, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay, we're here.

878
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:00,735
We're here together, all right?

879
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:03,936
We get out of here as fast
as we fucking can, you hear me?

880
00:48:04,146 --> 00:48:06,342
- Okay, okay.
- Together?

881
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,184
- That everybody?
- Getting the last one.

882
00:48:11,184 --> 00:48:13,447
All right, keep going.

883
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,092
All right, it's been a long,
exhausting night for all of us...

884
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:19,525
...but we just got word from outside.

885
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:22,096
Well, it's about bloody fucking time,
isn't it?

886
00:48:22,096 --> 00:48:24,427
Yes, they told me
they're sending in the CDC.

887
00:48:24,427 --> 00:48:25,862
- CDC?
- What's...?

888
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,697
- Center for Disease Control.
- Why?

889
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:30,237
Yes, but relax, it's fine.
They're going to come in.

890
00:48:30,237 --> 00:48:33,307
They're going to run blood tests
on residents to clarify things.

891
00:48:33,307 --> 00:48:36,275
- Just the residents?
- No, everybody.

892
00:48:36,275 --> 00:48:38,277
Everybody,
so once they check it out...

893
00:48:38,277 --> 00:48:41,382
...make sure everything's okay,
we should be able to get out.

894
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:43,108
- Oh, thank God.
- That won't work.

895
00:48:43,108 --> 00:48:46,619
- What are you talking about?
- That doesn't work, not for rabies.

896
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:50,385
- Nobody said anything about rabies.
- I did, I told you it was rabies.

897
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,152
How do you test for rabies?

898
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:54,820
There's only one way.
You got to get a brain sample.

899
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,329
- Come on.
- Man, just shut up.

900
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:59,128
- What you have to do.
- Let's make sure everyone's here.

901
00:48:59,128 --> 00:49:00,769
A simple "here" will be fine.

902
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:03,304
So let's get started.

903
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,771
- How many units per floor?
- Three.

904
00:49:05,771 --> 00:49:07,068
- There are three.
- Okay.

905
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:09,838
Second floor, Unit A,
that's where Mrs. Espinoza lives?

906
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:11,344
- Yes.
- Who's in B?

907
00:49:11,344 --> 00:49:13,005
- Me and Sadie.
- Here.

908
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,115
Who's in Unit C?

909
00:49:15,115 --> 00:49:16,445
Unit C.

910
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:18,280
The lawyer.

911
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,512
- Randy.
- Elevat...

912
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:21,987
All right, third floor, Unit A.
Who's up there?

913
00:49:21,987 --> 00:49:25,025
That's me, my daughter
and my husband, who's been outside...

914
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,990
Yes, yes, yes, we know. Thank you.

915
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,688
- Unit B, please.
- Us.

916
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:30,798
- My wife and me.
- Who's in Unit C?

917
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:32,298
- Vacant.
- Why we doing this?

918
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:34,130
- Vacant.
- Nobody's been there...

919
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:37,831
- Fourth floor, Unit A, who's up there?
- That was Elise. She's dead.

920
00:49:37,831 --> 00:49:39,804
- What?
- She's dead?

921
00:49:39,804 --> 00:49:43,378
- 4B, who's in B?
- It's me, me, here.

922
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,615
- Who's in C?
- It's them.

923
00:49:47,615 --> 00:49:48,842
You two?

924
00:49:48,842 --> 00:49:51,715
They don't understand you.
Them and her father.

925
00:49:51,715 --> 00:49:55,186
- And her father's upstairs?
- Sick, he's paralytic.

926
00:49:55,186 --> 00:49:57,623
Maybe this is all his fault.

927
00:49:57,623 --> 00:50:01,355
- How do you know? You don't know...
- Listen up, all right, let's finish up.

928
00:50:01,355 --> 00:50:03,862
- Okay.
- Somebody knows.

929
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:06,730
What was I even going to say?
Who lives in the attic?

930
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:11,465
A man from Boston. He rents it,
but I haven't seen him in months.

931
00:50:11,465 --> 00:50:14,336
Wait, if her father's upstairs,
should we bring him down?

932
00:50:14,336 --> 00:50:17,172
What if he's the cause?
We can't bring sick people here.

933
00:50:17,172 --> 00:50:20,510
- Your daughter's sick, isn't she?
- She has fever. Hardly the same.

934
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,914
Yeah, so we should bring
her father downstairs.

935
00:50:22,914 --> 00:50:24,677
- Hey, hey.
- Stop, stop it.

936
00:50:24,677 --> 00:50:26,413
- Hey.
- Stop fighting.

937
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:28,648
- Listen.
- How many times you going to do this?

938
00:50:28,648 --> 00:50:30,588
Nobody's going.
We're going to stay here.

939
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:33,762
They will let us know
when they want to move us, period.

940
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:35,521
Can we finish?

941
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:36,824
- Fine.
- Thank you.

942
00:50:36,824 --> 00:50:38,557
The cleaning lady.

943
00:50:38,557 --> 00:50:39,894
Yeah, the cleaning lady.

944
00:50:39,894 --> 00:50:42,697
- The cleaning lady was here.
- I saw her this morning.

945
00:50:42,697 --> 00:50:44,534
She's deceased.

946
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:46,005
- What?
- What did he say?

947
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:47,871
- What?
- She's gone.

948
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,250
Stand back from the door.

949
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,925
Open the door.

950
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,525
- Show me your hands.
- L.A.P.D.

951
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,036
CDC's now making their way
into the building.

952
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,007
There are security measures in place.

953
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,148
We still have no idea
what's happening.

954
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:28,077
From the look of the precaution
that they're taking...

955
00:51:28,077 --> 00:51:30,583
...it's something very serious.

956
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,485
I want you
to just keep this area clear.

957
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,650
This is...

958
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:10,690
This is blood from my partner here.

959
00:52:10,893 --> 00:52:15,092
He's in the back. This blood
is from the second firefighter.

960
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,864
You, turn it off. Turn it off now.

961
00:52:21,864 --> 00:52:23,130
Now. Turn it off.

962
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,967
Okay, okay, it's off.

963
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:25,686
Jesus.

964
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,670
Okay, everyone here.
Everybody here is good.

965
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,543
The two guys are in the back.
That's all we can tell you.

966
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:36,208
- I don't know anything else right now.
- Okay.

967
00:52:36,418 --> 00:52:39,114
Just take me to the injured.
Everyone else stays here.

968
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,280
You heard him. Stay here.

969
00:52:43,492 --> 00:52:45,427
Clear this area.

970
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:53,231
They tell us to stay calm,
and they come dressed like that?

971
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:57,702
- It's going to be all right.
- What? You honestly believe that?

972
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,507
I am going to open it.

973
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:17,193
Can you see?

974
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,657
That's good. That's good.

975
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:21,887
I am going to take samples
from both men.

976
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:38,710
Up here. Up here.

977
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,213
- Okay.
- Can you get up there?

978
00:53:40,213 --> 00:53:42,112
Yeah, okay, cool.

979
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:45,344
Hey, hold this, hold this.

980
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:49,922
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

981
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,617
You got it?

982
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:55,228
Okay, give it to me.

983
00:53:55,228 --> 00:53:57,422
Give me the camera, come on.

984
00:53:57,422 --> 00:54:00,068
Give me the camera.

985
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,469
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

986
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:07,507
What's happening?

987
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,402
- They're handcuffing him.
- Who?

988
00:54:10,402 --> 00:54:12,309
Fletcher.

989
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,751
The other one's got a syringe.

990
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:40,264
He just gave Fletcher a shot.

991
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:07,268
- Oh, shit.
- What?

992
00:55:07,268 --> 00:55:09,563
He's got a drill.

993
00:55:14,643 --> 00:55:17,840
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

994
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,505
I think the vet was right.

995
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,650
I think he's taking a brain sample.

996
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,117
- Holy shit.
- Scott?

997
00:55:57,152 --> 00:55:58,983
Hey, look out.

998
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,659
Angela, run. Run.

999
00:56:14,536 --> 00:56:16,402
The vet's in there.
He's still in there.

1000
00:56:16,402 --> 00:56:18,666
- Open the door.
- We can't, he's been bitten.

1001
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:21,572
- Come on, let him out.
- I am not infected, you're wrong.

1002
00:56:21,572 --> 00:56:23,268
I am not infected. I am all right.

1003
00:56:23,268 --> 00:56:25,744
- They didn't get me.
- What are you talking about?

1004
00:56:25,744 --> 00:56:29,248
- Are you sure he's been bitten?
- Yes, and I am not taking any chances.

1005
00:56:29,248 --> 00:56:32,114
Back away till the infected people
have been handcuffed.

1006
00:56:32,114 --> 00:56:34,085
Infected with what?

1007
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:37,590
- Would you get that out of my face?
- What happens happens in the open.

1008
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:40,525
They have a right to shoot this,
okay?

1009
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,625
- You okay?
- Lawrence.

1010
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,291
Lawrence, you okay?

1011
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,630
God, this isn't right.

1012
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,273
Calm down, calm down. No.

1013
00:56:51,273 --> 00:56:55,536
- It's not right.
- It would not be right to let him out...

1014
00:57:02,284 --> 00:57:03,615
You tell us what's going on.

1015
00:57:03,615 --> 00:57:05,652
- I am not authorized to tell...
- Bullshit.

1016
00:57:05,652 --> 00:57:08,222
You left my friend
because he tried to kill you.

1017
00:57:08,222 --> 00:57:09,449
Tell us what you know.

1018
00:57:09,449 --> 00:57:12,423
- Tell us what you know.
- Yeah, okay, goddamn, okay.

1019
00:57:12,423 --> 00:57:15,496
We got a call from a vet
who had a sick dog brought in.

1020
00:57:15,697 --> 00:57:19,065
They ran the routine tests,
it was nothing they'd ever seen before.

1021
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:21,396
Then it started
attacking the other animals.

1022
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,731
And within an hour,
all the injured animals...

1023
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,670
...showed the same kind
of aggression.

1024
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:30,574
Yeah. The dog's collar
led us to this building.

1025
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,943
Was the dog's name Max?

1026
00:57:33,943 --> 00:57:35,606
Yes.

1027
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:42,782
- She only has bronchitis.
- Bullshit, bronchitis.

1028
00:57:42,782 --> 00:57:45,586
- No, don't you dare.
- Kathy.

1029
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:47,353
- Bronchitis.
- We need to find out.

1030
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:49,429
Relax, ma'am. Relax.
We have to be sure.

1031
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:50,860
No, get away from me.

1032
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,126
Dog spread the infection
through his saliva.

1033
00:57:53,126 --> 00:57:54,429
We just got to check.

1034
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,094
- Let him do a check, ma'am.
- No.

1035
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:57,364
That's all we got to do.

1036
00:57:57,364 --> 00:57:59,974
That's all she has, just bronchitis.

1037
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:02,304
- No.
- Go, go.

1038
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:04,606
Get back. Get back.

1039
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,942
Get back. Watch out.

1040
00:58:07,483 --> 00:58:10,282
Run, Briana. Run, sweetheart.

1041
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:12,387
- Get the girl.
- No, get away from her.

1042
00:58:12,387 --> 00:58:14,523
- Hold her. Hold her.
- Run.

1043
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:16,681
- Run, sweetie, please.
- Get the handcuffs.

1044
00:58:16,681 --> 00:58:19,521
- Come on, come on.
- No, let me go.

1045
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:21,356
Don't hurt her. Please.

1046
00:58:21,356 --> 00:58:23,362
Please,
you need to get us out of here.

1047
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:26,023
Stop it. Stop it.

1048
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:27,827
- Cuff her.
- No.

1049
00:58:27,827 --> 00:58:29,061
Come here. Come.

1050
00:58:29,271 --> 00:58:30,670
- Honey.
- She's cuffed.

1051
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,068
- Honey.
- Back away.

1052
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,675
Back away.
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

1053
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:37,570
- No.
- Father.

1054
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,838
- Father.
- What father?

1055
00:58:38,838 --> 00:58:41,313
- Her father's sick in bed.
- Nobody told me that.

1056
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:43,144
We thought everyone was down here.

1057
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:45,548
All right, here. Take this.

1058
00:58:45,548 --> 00:58:47,485
Get the girl and inject her with it.

1059
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:49,851
- No, no.
- And you, bring everybody down here.

1060
00:58:49,851 --> 00:58:51,755
Bring Briana. Okay.

1061
00:58:51,755 --> 00:58:54,556
Kathy, we're going to get her.
We're going to bring her down.

1062
00:58:54,556 --> 00:58:56,391
- Run, honey.
- Going up.

1063
00:58:56,391 --> 00:58:58,329
- We're not going to hurt you.
- Get away.

1064
00:58:58,329 --> 00:59:02,597
Get away from her. Honey.

1065
00:59:02,804 --> 00:59:04,900
Briana.

1066
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,371
Run.

1067
00:59:06,371 --> 00:59:07,090
Honey.

1068
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:09,784
Briana.

1069
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,940
Get away from her.

1070
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,583
Oh, God.

1071
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,016
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

1072
00:59:21,456 --> 00:59:24,824
Okay, okay. All right.

1073
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:28,592
Briana?

1074
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,960
Oh, God.

1075
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,903
- Where the hell's the old lady?
- The old lady's gone.

1076
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,103
Briana?

1077
00:59:43,103 --> 00:59:45,974
Okay. Just take it easy, okay?

1078
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:47,911
Briana?

1079
00:59:55,724 --> 00:59:57,351
Briana?

1080
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,797
Oh, Briana.

1081
01:00:07,797 --> 01:00:10,735
- Briana?
- Briana?

1082
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,806
Shit.

1083
01:00:13,675 --> 01:00:15,405
Shit, I am sorry.

1084
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,472
Briana?

1085
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,251
Oh, shit.

1086
01:00:32,894 --> 01:00:34,623
Briana?

1087
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:39,393
Oh, I think she's in here, Jake.

1088
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,327
Hell.

1089
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,438
She's over there. She's over there.

1090
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,309
You all right?

1091
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:52,208
Now, I need you
to give me your hand, okay?

1092
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:54,206
Okay?

1093
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:56,641
What happened to her eyes?

1094
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,221
Please don't stop. Please, don't.

1095
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:07,157
Get her off me.

1096
01:01:08,063 --> 01:01:09,463
Go, go.

1097
01:01:09,463 --> 01:01:12,065
She bit me. Go, Jake.

1098
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:18,532
- Get out of here.
- Go, go, go.

1099
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:20,699
Come on, go. Let's go.

1100
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:22,673
- Go, go, go.
- They're getting out.

1101
01:01:22,673 --> 01:01:24,574
They're getting out.

1102
01:01:24,574 --> 01:01:26,510
No, no, no.

1103
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,309
- Go back.
- They're getting out.

1104
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:32,351
Oh, they're getting out. Run, run.

1105
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:47,992
Don't go. Wait.

1106
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:54,932
They're getting close. Run.

1107
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:57,775
Okay. Run. Run.

1108
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,971
Don't leave me.

1109
01:02:00,615 --> 01:02:03,050
- Don't leave me.
- I am not going to leave her.

1110
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:05,550
- Don't leave me.
- We have to get out of here.

1111
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:09,213
It's not right. It's not right.

1112
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,697
- Come on.
- No, no, not that way. This way.

1113
01:02:24,139 --> 01:02:26,074
Hurry up, come on.
Where are the others?

1114
01:02:26,074 --> 01:02:27,300
Come on, let's go.

1115
01:02:29,411 --> 01:02:31,141
Hurry up.

1116
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:34,010
- Lock it, lock it, lock it.
- Hurry up.

1117
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:52,797
Help me, help me.

1118
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:11,311
- Were you bitten?
- No.

1119
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:13,148
- You?
- No.

1120
01:03:13,148 --> 01:03:15,449
- You?
- No.

1121
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:17,182
Scott?

1122
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,184
Scott?

1123
01:03:20,184 --> 01:03:22,956
- Were you bitten?
- No.

1124
01:03:24,065 --> 01:03:25,623
Angie?

1125
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,219
No.

1126
01:03:28,804 --> 01:03:32,570
- Hey, what about you?
- No, no.

1127
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:35,768
Hey, you.

1128
01:03:35,768 --> 01:03:37,206
On the floor.

1129
01:03:37,206 --> 01:03:40,644
- Hey, you been bitten?
- No, no.

1130
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,778
Jake, did you find the little girl?

1131
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,978
Who gives a shit about the little girl?

1132
01:03:45,978 --> 01:03:48,487
All right.
We have lost control of the building.

1133
01:03:48,487 --> 01:03:50,353
We're fucked.

1134
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:52,492
Damn it.

1135
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:55,358
I don't understand.

1136
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,860
I don't understand.
They were biting her face off.

1137
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:01,900
I don't know
what the fuck is happening.

1138
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:03,731
- Damn it.
- I don't understand.

1139
01:04:03,731 --> 01:04:06,739
We could all be infected by now.
We got to get out of here.

1140
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:08,170
I am not moving. I am done.

1141
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,710
- I am not moving.
- Hey, we wait here, we wait here.

1142
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:12,643
- We have to get out of here.
- Listen.

1143
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:16,751
We have to stay here and wait
till somebody come and get us.

1144
01:04:16,751 --> 01:04:18,579
They're not going to come and get us.

1145
01:04:18,579 --> 01:04:20,914
- Oh, yes, they will.
- They are not going to come.

1146
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,887
They don't give a shit about us.
They're going to let us die.

1147
01:04:23,887 --> 01:04:26,653
They don't care about us.

1148
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:30,260
Scott, we're going to die.

1149
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:33,226
- Oh, fuck.
- She's right.

1150
01:04:33,226 --> 01:04:35,028
- Who was that?
- It was the doctor.

1151
01:04:35,028 --> 01:04:36,398
What?

1152
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:38,567
- I am going to kill you.
- I have been bit.

1153
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:39,900
You left us down there.

1154
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,668
Piece of shit.

1155
01:04:41,668 --> 01:04:43,777
I have been bitten.

1156
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,744
He's been bitten.

1157
01:04:45,744 --> 01:04:47,940
He's been bitten. Get back.

1158
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,411
Close those doors.

1159
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:52,349
Somebody close
those fucking doors.

1160
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:58,222
It won't hold him.

1161
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:01,762
It's not going to hold him for long.

1162
01:05:01,762 --> 01:05:03,693
- Get back.
- She's bleeding.

1163
01:05:03,693 --> 01:05:05,757
She's bleeding.

1164
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:12,273
Sadie.

1165
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:13,858
No.

1166
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,244
We have to kill her.

1167
01:05:16,244 --> 01:05:17,083
No, no.

1168
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,581
Hey, hey, hey,
you're not going to fucking touch her.

1169
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:26,277
We got to get out. Got to get out.

1170
01:05:26,277 --> 01:05:29,048
Got to get out of here.
Got to get out of here. Come on.

1171
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,420
Help me get out of here.

1172
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,789
Let me get out of here, please.

1173
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:36,056
Hey, hey.

1174
01:05:36,056 --> 01:05:38,563
Please. Hey.

1175
01:05:38,563 --> 01:05:40,929
Hey. Hey.

1176
01:05:40,929 --> 01:05:42,797
Please, get me...

1177
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:44,336
Oh, my God.

1178
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:45,177
Sniper.

1179
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:13,996
Scott.

1180
01:06:15,737 --> 01:06:19,173
They're not going to let us out
of here alive, are they?

1181
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:19,923
No.

1182
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,835
I don't think so.

1183
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,782
- There might be a way out.
- What?

1184
01:06:29,782 --> 01:06:33,318
Jake, there might be a way out.

1185
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,358
How? How do we get out of here?

1186
01:06:47,402 --> 01:06:49,336
Listen, Jake.

1187
01:06:49,336 --> 01:06:53,338
There is a drain cover in the basement
that joins up with the sewers.

1188
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:57,467
- We need the key, we need the key.
- The keys are in our apartment.

1189
01:07:08,023 --> 01:07:09,320
Come with us.

1190
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,085
Come with us.
You have to come with us.

1191
01:07:12,293 --> 01:07:14,523
I won't leave him. I can't leave him.

1192
01:07:14,523 --> 01:07:16,824
Leave him alone.

1193
01:07:19,501 --> 01:07:22,164
Oh, my God.

1194
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,771
We have to get out of here.
We have to get the key.

1195
01:07:24,771 --> 01:07:27,237
Key's in Yuri's apartment.
Know where he lives?

1196
01:07:27,237 --> 01:07:30,072
You made the list of residents.
Where does he live?

1197
01:07:30,072 --> 01:07:31,735
I can't remember where it's at.

1198
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:34,211
You have to think about it.
Think, think, think.

1199
01:07:34,211 --> 01:07:36,179
- I don't know, I don't know.
- Think.

1200
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:39,617
I don't know which apartment.
I don't know which apartment it is.

1201
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,389
Mailboxes, mailboxes.

1202
01:07:42,389 --> 01:07:44,320
Mailboxes.

1203
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,432
Yeah, get the hammer.

1204
01:07:58,432 --> 01:08:00,403
- Grab the hammer.
- I got it, I got it.

1205
01:08:00,403 --> 01:08:02,771
- Go.
- Keep moving.

1206
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:06,108
Oh, keep moving, man.
Keep moving.

1207
01:08:06,108 --> 01:08:08,045
I am coming.

1208
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:22,956
Where is it? Which one is it?

1209
01:08:23,364 --> 01:08:24,422
Hurry.

1210
01:08:24,422 --> 01:08:25,998
Yuri Ivanov, 3B.

1211
01:08:25,998 --> 01:08:27,498
Three. Get to the elevator.

1212
01:08:27,498 --> 01:08:30,161
- Three. Oh, God.
- Oh, shit.

1213
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:32,131
Get to the elevator.

1214
01:08:32,131 --> 01:08:33,774
But the electricity?

1215
01:08:33,774 --> 01:08:36,672
It should run on auxiliary power.
We're good.

1216
01:08:36,878 --> 01:08:39,404
She's cuffed. We can get by.

1217
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:50,591
Come on. Come on.

1218
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,387
Come on.

1219
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:56,962
- Oh, God.
- Get in.

1220
01:08:56,962 --> 01:08:58,292
Get in.

1221
01:08:58,292 --> 01:09:01,800
Get in. Get in.

1222
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:04,867
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

1223
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:07,474
Close the fucking door.

1224
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:13,210
Easy, easy.

1225
01:09:13,414 --> 01:09:16,042
But it's going to stop at two.
We're going to stop at two.

1226
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:18,015
- The light, the light.
- I will get it.

1227
01:09:18,015 --> 01:09:20,484
- I am fixing it, come on.
- The light.

1228
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:25,989
Come on. Come on,
you should get that hammer, Jake.

1229
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,637
They won't close. They won't close.

1230
01:09:46,181 --> 01:09:47,706
It's go... It's going to go.

1231
01:09:47,706 --> 01:09:49,850
Oh, it's going to go.

1232
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,893
- Oh, shit.
- Scott.

1233
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:01,613
Scott.

1234
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,695
Scott.

1235
01:10:05,695 --> 01:10:07,391
Get off me.

1236
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:12,256
No.

1237
01:10:35,096 --> 01:10:37,497
Get up. Come on.

1238
01:10:42,704 --> 01:10:44,262
Get up.

1239
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,434
Get up.

1240
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:00,050
Scott, I have been bitten.

1241
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:01,951
- I have been bitten.
- No, you haven't.

1242
01:11:01,951 --> 01:11:03,386
No, you haven't. I saw it.

1243
01:11:03,386 --> 01:11:04,992
I was bitten.

1244
01:11:04,992 --> 01:11:08,095
Angie, Angie, they didn't get you.
You didn't get bitten.

1245
01:11:08,095 --> 01:11:10,128
- Come on, Angie. Angie.
- I was bitten.

1246
01:11:10,128 --> 01:11:12,460
- Look at me, Angie. Come on, baby.
- No.

1247
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,159
- Baby, come on, look at me.
- Man, let's go.

1248
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:16,997
- Get off me. Look at me.
- No.

1249
01:11:16,997 --> 01:11:18,264
Let's get out of here.

1250
01:11:18,264 --> 01:11:19,997
You did not get bit.

1251
01:11:19,997 --> 01:11:21,733
You did not get bit. Look at me.

1252
01:11:21,733 --> 01:11:23,002
You did not get bit.

1253
01:11:23,002 --> 01:11:24,439
Trust me. You did not.

1254
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:26,274
- I saw it, I saw it.
- We have to go.

1255
01:11:26,274 --> 01:11:28,006
- Let's go.
- No. Let's go, baby.

1256
01:11:28,006 --> 01:11:31,153
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

1257
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:46,967
This is 3B right here. Right here.

1258
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,974
All clear.

1259
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,537
- Keep the light on my hands, Scott.
- Okay.

1260
01:11:59,537 --> 01:12:01,774
- Find them.
- I don't see it, I don't see.

1261
01:12:01,774 --> 01:12:05,943
- The light, the light, the light.
- I am bringing it back to you.

1262
01:12:05,943 --> 01:12:07,452
Nothing.

1263
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:08,953
I don't...

1264
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:10,954
No, no, he wouldn't
leave them in there.

1265
01:12:10,954 --> 01:12:12,854
Hey, he wouldn't leave them in there.

1266
01:12:12,854 --> 01:12:14,154
Come on.

1267
01:12:14,154 --> 01:12:15,796
Hurry.

1268
01:12:15,796 --> 01:12:17,021
Find the keys.

1269
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:18,962
He's the one that...
Who's...?

1270
01:12:18,962 --> 01:12:21,226
Go back to the desk.

1271
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,099
- Yeah.
- Find them keys, baby.

1272
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:31,869
Come on.

1273
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,641
I got them,
but I don't know which one it is.

1274
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,216
- I don't know.
- Take them all.

1275
01:12:36,216 --> 01:12:38,250
- Which one is it, Scott?
- Take them all.

1276
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,819
Come on.

1277
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:45,653
Angela, Angela,
I need you to be quiet.

1278
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:49,194
We need to get three flights of stairs
down to the basement, okay?

1279
01:12:49,194 --> 01:12:51,332
I need you to stay tight.

1280
01:12:51,332 --> 01:12:54,060
I need you to stay close
and stay fast, okay?

1281
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,898
- Are you ready? All right, all right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1282
01:12:56,898 --> 01:12:58,333
- Ready, Scott?
- Yeah, yeah.

1283
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,407
All right, all right.

1284
01:13:02,176 --> 01:13:03,576
Okay. All right.

1285
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:05,509
- All right, we can do this.
- Got it.

1286
01:13:05,509 --> 01:13:07,444
- We can do this, right, Angela?
- Yeah.

1287
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:09,207
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

1288
01:13:09,207 --> 01:13:10,851
Come on.

1289
01:13:11,386 --> 01:13:13,252
Ready. Come on.

1290
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:15,652
Scott, come on. Come on, Scott.

1291
01:13:23,798 --> 01:13:25,789
Angela, Angela, stop.

1292
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:27,798
Hey, we got to go up. Come on.

1293
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:30,939
Come on, run, run.

1294
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,171
Get up there. Come on.

1295
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,019
Up. Go.

1296
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,248
- Going to be an old one. Oh, God.
- Go.

1297
01:13:44,248 --> 01:13:47,479
- It's got to be an old one, Scott.
- I know, pick the key.

1298
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:49,315
- Get in there.
- Light, light, light.

1299
01:13:49,315 --> 01:13:51,481
- I am finding it, I am finding it.
- Come on.

1300
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,387
- Go, go, go.
- Scott, I got it.

1301
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:57,430
- Go, go, go.
- I got it.

1302
01:14:04,405 --> 01:14:06,305
- Lock it.
- I can't get it.

1303
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,907
- Come on.
- I can't get it.

1304
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,082
Scott, I can't.

1305
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:16,841
Just turn the light on.

1306
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:19,283
- Turn the light on.
- It will come back on.

1307
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:21,514
- I need the light on.
- It will come back on.

1308
01:14:21,722 --> 01:14:22,747
Oh, please.

1309
01:14:22,747 --> 01:14:27,088
There we go, there we go,
there we go. Okay? Okay, listen.

1310
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,485
Listen, listen. They went away.

1311
01:14:29,485 --> 01:14:33,157
I think they went away.
Oh, damn, damn.

1312
01:14:33,157 --> 01:14:35,131
Okay, so this place was locked up.

1313
01:14:35,131 --> 01:14:38,761
What that means, probably,
is there ain't nobody in here. No one.

1314
01:14:38,761 --> 01:14:41,306
Yeah, let's find a way out.

1315
01:14:41,306 --> 01:14:44,344
Oh, God. Come on.

1316
01:14:44,344 --> 01:14:47,948
Oh, what is this place, Scott?

1317
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:04,895
- Oh, please, keep the light on.
- I got you, I got you.

1318
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,034
What is this?

1319
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,243
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1320
01:15:18,243 --> 01:15:19,710
Come on.

1321
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:22,407
Come on. Come on, now.

1322
01:15:23,851 --> 01:15:25,819
- What is this?
- Oh, please.

1323
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,551
- What is this?
- I don't know, man.

1324
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:31,818
What is it?

1325
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:33,221
- Oh, what is that?
- Please.

1326
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:34,885
What is it?

1327
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,658
What the hell?

1328
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:46,498
Oh, shit.

1329
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:49,006
Oh, God.
Oh, it's all the same kind of stuff.

1330
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:50,734
I don't understand it.

1331
01:15:50,734 --> 01:15:52,676
Just stop.

1332
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,375
Wait.

1333
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:56,949
Oh, God,
let's get out of here, please.

1334
01:15:56,949 --> 01:15:58,881
Okay, come on.
Come on, grab my hand.

1335
01:15:58,881 --> 01:16:01,681
Grab my hand, it's me, it's me.
Look at it, look at it.

1336
01:16:01,681 --> 01:16:03,721
Just come around this pole.
Let me lead.

1337
01:16:03,721 --> 01:16:05,416
Let me lead. I am right with you.

1338
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:07,255
That's the way, okay?
Okay, come on.

1339
01:16:07,255 --> 01:16:09,453
Oh, God, I don't...

1340
01:16:09,453 --> 01:16:12,532
Hey, hey, my bad, my bad.

1341
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,197
Okay.

1342
01:16:14,197 --> 01:16:15,961
Angela?

1343
01:16:17,104 --> 01:16:19,630
We're going to have to go
through that door.

1344
01:16:25,713 --> 01:16:27,648
I just need you to open it.

1345
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,475
You're going to let me look in first.

1346
01:16:29,475 --> 01:16:31,914
- You just open it, okay?
- Yeah.

1347
01:16:31,914 --> 01:16:33,952
Just push it and stand back.

1348
01:16:33,952 --> 01:16:36,886
Stand back. Okay, okay.

1349
01:16:36,886 --> 01:16:39,823
Come on, come on, Angie.
Angie, let's go in there.

1350
01:16:39,823 --> 01:16:42,759
- Please, get the light on me, okay?
- Come on.

1351
01:16:44,131 --> 01:16:46,327
Oh, this is so fucked. I don't know.

1352
01:16:46,327 --> 01:16:48,365
Oh, damn.

1353
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:54,007
Oh, shit, stick with me, stick with me.
Come on.

1354
01:16:56,811 --> 01:16:58,143
Okay?

1355
01:16:58,143 --> 01:17:02,078
- Keep the light on, keep the light on.
- What is it?

1356
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:04,475
Okay.

1357
01:17:04,475 --> 01:17:08,282
Okay, good? You got to...

1358
01:17:08,282 --> 01:17:10,015
Shit.

1359
01:17:10,658 --> 01:17:12,251
- What is this?
- What?

1360
01:17:12,251 --> 01:17:15,453
What is it? What the hell?

1361
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:17,992
What are you doing?

1362
01:17:17,992 --> 01:17:21,158
- Oh, Scott, what is this stuff?
- Okay.

1363
01:17:23,404 --> 01:17:24,895
Okay.

1364
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:27,938
Who is this? Who is this?

1365
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:29,440
Oh, what is that?

1366
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,704
Is that a fucking?

1367
01:17:32,913 --> 01:17:34,609
Hey, play it.

1368
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,945
I don't know what to do with it.

1369
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,610
That's it, come on.

1370
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:52,631
Hey, what is that?

1371
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:23,658
What was that?

1372
01:18:28,869 --> 01:18:30,097
I will come to you.

1373
01:18:30,097 --> 01:18:31,932
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

1374
01:18:31,932 --> 01:18:34,006
Hey, hey, hey.

1375
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:37,036
Come on.
We don't know what's up there.

1376
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,884
- Grab my hand, grab my hand.
- Okay.

1377
01:18:46,387 --> 01:18:47,979
Okay.

1378
01:18:50,257 --> 01:18:52,020
Okay, I am going to take the camera.

1379
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:55,060
Listen to me, listen to me.
I am going to take the camera.

1380
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,198
- I am going to take a look up there.
- No, no.

1381
01:18:57,198 --> 01:18:58,764
- Get up the door.
- No, no, no.

1382
01:18:58,764 --> 01:19:01,630
We can't stay the fuck down here.
We can't stay here.

1383
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:04,067
I won't have a light
if you go up there.

1384
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:06,707
- Angie, Angie, stay with me.
- I will be in the dark.

1385
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:08,604
Angie, stay with me.

1386
01:19:08,604 --> 01:19:10,438
Angie, stay with me.

1387
01:19:10,438 --> 01:19:13,706
Look, I am going to have
to take this light off you.

1388
01:19:13,706 --> 01:19:16,783
Here, grab my waist.
Okay, just grab my waist.

1389
01:19:16,783 --> 01:19:18,510
Good.

1390
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,676
Scott, what happened?
What happened?

1391
01:19:45,676 --> 01:19:48,645
- Oh, something hit the camera.
- Don't turn it off, fix it.

1392
01:19:48,645 --> 01:19:51,081
- I am trying. Damn it, I am trying.
- Please.

1393
01:19:51,081 --> 01:19:52,310
I am trying.

1394
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:54,648
Look, I am going to put
the night vision on.

1395
01:19:54,648 --> 01:19:57,552
I will put the night vision on.
Hold on.

1396
01:19:58,292 --> 01:19:59,623
Just stay there, okay?

1397
01:19:59,623 --> 01:20:01,921
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

1398
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:03,988
Okay.

1399
01:20:03,988 --> 01:20:06,360
Okay. Okay, I can
see you now, okay?

1400
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:07,966
Okay.

1401
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,297
All right? Okay.

1402
01:20:11,297 --> 01:20:15,101
Yeah, yeah. Okay,
I am going to stick my hand out, okay?

1403
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:17,141
Okay, okay. Hey.

1404
01:20:17,141 --> 01:20:18,972
Relax, relax, it's me.

1405
01:20:18,972 --> 01:20:21,114
Hey, it's me, it's me, it's me, okay?

1406
01:20:21,114 --> 01:20:23,614
Okay, good. Come on, come on.

1407
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:25,445
Hey, you're doing good.
Come around.

1408
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:27,349
Come around my back. Hold on.

1409
01:20:27,349 --> 01:20:28,954
Hold on. We will be okay, okay?

1410
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:32,115
I just got to find us a way out of here.

1411
01:20:32,115 --> 01:20:33,783
Okay? Okay.

1412
01:20:33,783 --> 01:20:36,395
I will find a way out, I promise.

1413
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,900
Just give me a minute.

1414
01:20:43,838 --> 01:20:45,898
What's that? Stay still, stay still.

1415
01:20:46,106 --> 01:20:47,404
Why? Why? Why?

1416
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,542
Get down. Get down.

1417
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:52,509
Don't make a sound.
Don't make a sound.

1418
01:22:16,297 --> 01:22:18,265
It can't see us.

1419
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:22,493
If it can't hear us, it won't find us.

1420
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:36,649
Okay, get ready.
We're going to try to get by it.

1421
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:49,930
Run.

1422
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,800
Run.

1423
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:14,912
Scott.
