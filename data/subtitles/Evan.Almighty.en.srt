1
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,610
And that's the news.

2
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:14,698
But before we sign off, we'd like to
congratulate our very own Evan Baxter,

3
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,577
who has just been elected
Buffalo's representative to Congress.

4
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,080
- And, now, we have a surprise for Evan.
- No, you don't.

5
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,541
- We do.
- Oh, no. I really didn't expect this.

6
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,169
Here's a look back at his run for office.

7
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,257
- What are we gonna do?
Change the world!

8
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,342
That's right!

9
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,559
Baxter! Baxter! Baxter!

10
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,526
Hi.

11
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,944
Baxter! Baxter!

12
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,487
That's right!

13
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:02,204
I feel like that old Indian
in front of all the garbage.

14
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:08,710
So, for the last time, this is Evan Baxter
for Eyewitness News. Good night.

15
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,480
Huntsville, Virginia.
Prestige Crest, four miles.

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,191
- What did we do before GPS?
- Nothing.

17
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,485
Guys, Dad's very proud of his new car.

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,157
Hey, I am proud of my new car.
Look, I'm a politician now.

19
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,160
I'm in the public eye, and as you know,
when you are in the public eye,

20
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,911
image is everything, isn't it?

21
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,294
Here it is! Welcome to the good life.

22
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,590
Hey, guys, why the long faces?
We're off on a new adventure!

23
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,342
It's just we're going to miss our friends.

24
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,261
You'll make new friends, better friends.

25
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,512
Yeah, richer friends.

26
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,349
Do not mouth off to me, sir.
I am the boss of you.

27
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,768
And let me tell you something,
you guys are gonna love this place.

28
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,647
And you know what? I think there's
something for our fishermen up there.

29
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,943
Baxter family,
this is what's called a scenic vista.

30
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,031
And I don't think the big man himself
could do a betterjob. Pretty cool, huh?

31
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,741
Hey, Dad, an iguana can stay underwater

32
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,909
- for 28 minutes.
- What's that?

33
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,869
- And a shrimp's heart is in its head.
- Really?

34
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,205
Okay, someone's had enough Animal Planet
for one lifetime.

35
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,207
Yeah, let's head out! Come on.
The best is yet to come!

36
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,711
Gentlemen,
I have saved the best for last.

37
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,340
Look over to the right.
That is your new home.

38
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,890
That's our house?

39
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,059
I don't remember it being this big
in the brochure.

40
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,393
Was it this big in the brochure?

41
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,728
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

42
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,396
There they are!

43
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,067
Is this curb appeal or what?

44
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,652
Here we go!

45
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,363
- Honey, I think you're blocking my photo.
- Sorry.

46
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,406
All right, everybody! Say "escrow"!

47
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,326
- Escrow!
- Escrow!

48
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,162
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Go. Go. Go.

49
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,706
Guys, easy.

50
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,002
This is our house?

51
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,463
Careful!

52
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,423
Honey, be careful!
Watch it!

53
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,633
Are you kidding me?

54
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,926
- Mom, can we go upstairs?
Yep.

55
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,427
- And I get my own room, right?
- Yep.

56
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,515
Mr. Baxter, could you give us some
direction on these kitchen cabinets?

57
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,599
Sure.

58
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:32,020
Okay, it's between your maple
and your old-growth Brazilian cherry.

59
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,147
That is nice! Which is best?

60
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,276
Well, if you're not sensitive to that
"save the rainforest" stuff,

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,860
you can't beat the Brazilian cherry.

62
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,070
It's 200, 300 years old.

63
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,655
- Three hundred years.
- Three hundred.

64
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,282
Wow. That is old.

65
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,617
And now you are going to hold my dishes.

66
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,452
- That's right. You going with the cherry?
- Cheery cherry!

67
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,912
- Yeah. Definitely.
- He's going with the cherry!

68
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,499
Dad, look!
- No, no, no!

69
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,876
Ryan, do not touch him, please!

70
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,837
Oh, no, no, no, no, get him away!

71
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,172
No. He might have lice, fleas, maggots
or something.

72
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,009
You do not play with stray dogs
because they are very...

73
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,428
No, no! Get away, get away! Go!

74
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,596
Okay. Oh, no, no, no.

75
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,098
- He's thirsty.
- No, no, no.

76
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,059
No, you don't! There we go.

77
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,602
Well, Ryan, he's a stray.

78
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,313
If we give him water,
he's just going to come back.

79
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,774
Come on, Dad, why can't we keep him?
I mean, we've got a new house.

80
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,818
Okay, Ryan, this is why we can't keep him.

81
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,529
They are stinky. They are smelly.
They get hair all over the place.

82
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,739
They get a little thing called the mange.

83
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,867
In a nutshell, he is disgusting.
Case in point.

84
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:36,835
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes
day one of the Baxters' new and exciting life.

85
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,212
I have to do the new house dance.

86
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,840
Wow! That dance?

87
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,760
- That's a good new house dance.
- Thank you.

88
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,012
You know, those boys were having
so much fun tonight,

89
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,930
I thought I would never get them to bed.

90
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,685
And then Ryan did the cutest thing.
He asked if we could all pray together.

91
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,855
Really? What did you pray about?

92
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,024
He met a dog.
What do you think he prayed for?

93
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,820
Just a walking petri dish, that dog.

94
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,073
And Jordan was very precise.

95
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,951
He prayed for good visibility, good weather
on the hiking trip tomorrow.

96
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,288
The hiking trip? Oh, right. Yeah.
The hiking trip. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,248
You wanna know what I prayed for?

98
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,209
Yeah. What did you pray for?

99
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,420
I prayed we would become closer
as a family.

100
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:26,009
Honey, you don't need to pray for that
to happen. I will make that happen.

101
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:31,932
- What would you pray for?
- Me? I don't know. Praying just...

102
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,646
Honey, you're the one who said
you wanted to change the world.

103
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,065
It's a pretty big job.

104
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,151
If it were me,
I would take all the help I could get.

105
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,201
Former Buffalo News
anchor, Evan Baxter, takes office tomorrow

106
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,703
to make good on a lofty campaign promise.

107
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,248
- What are we going to do?
Change the world!

108
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,793
Good luck, Congressman.
Many have tried, many have failed.

109
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,046
- Hello!
- This is Regina Sparks reporting for...

110
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,315
Hello, there. Hi.

111
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,735
This is Evan Baxter.

112
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,781
Just wanted to say thank you for everything.

113
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,660
Thank you for the new car
and for the house.

114
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,705
The house is great. I love it.

115
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:41,793
I mean, I picked it out,
but you created matter and everything, so...

116
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,092
I just wanted to say that I think Joan
makes a good point,

117
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,597
and that I am now in a position
of great power,

118
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,642
and I know that with great power
comes great responsibility.

119
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,771
So, God,

120
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,236
please help me change the world.

121
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,991
Okay. That's it. I'm hanging up now.

122
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,411
God bless... Well, you. Okay.

123
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,646
- What? That's weird.
- What?

124
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,731
I set the alarm for 7:00.

125
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,517
I am successful. I am powerful.
I am handsome.

126
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,812
I am happy, successful, powerful,
handsome, happy.

127
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:29,401
All right, everyone, wish me luck.
The Congressman has left the building.

128
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:34,531
All right, Baxter brood, I will see you
later on this afternoon for the big hike. Yes?

129
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,908
You psyched? Are you ready?
Yeah.

130
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,243
- Bye. See you.
- Good luck, honey.

131
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,452
- Bye, guys!
- See you later.

132
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,537
Later, gator.

133
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,873
Oh, gosh.

134
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,668
Wow. Honey, did you order anything?

135
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,170
"Alpha and Omega Hardware"?

136
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,673
Never heard of them.
- Me either.

137
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,842
What do we have?

138
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,053
What is this stuff?

139
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,307
Must have the wrong address.

140
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,726
Yup. The wrong address.

141
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,563
Congressman Baxter.
Good morning.

142
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,606
Good morning.

143
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,024
Good morning, Congressman Baxter.
- Hello.

144
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,526
Good morning, Congressman Baxter.
- Good morning.

145
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,613
Oh, this is so cool.

146
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,618
Yeah. This'll work.

147
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,538
There he is! The head honcho.
The big kahuna.

148
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,624
Rita, I think I have to do the dance.

149
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,875
Do the dance.

150
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,796
That's enough of the dance.

151
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,965
Oh, this is nice! This is really nice!

152
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,718
This is too nice.
There's something crooked going on.

153
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,011
Do you smell anthrax?

154
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,971
- Congressman!
- Hey, Marty!

155
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,473
- Nice sound to that.
- I like it.

156
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,557
Here they are!

157
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,809
All right.

158
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,645
You remember Sarah, Allen, Michael.

159
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,397
I don't think you know the new kid
Eugene Tennanbaum. I found him at G.W.

160
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,149
Sort of a walking search engine. Watch this.

161
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,485
- How many stars on the flag in 1818?
-15.

162
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,487
And Congressman Baxter's coffee habits?

163
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,823
He likes a morning latte with a cruller,
a decaf espresso after lunch,

164
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,492
served sans pastry of any kind.

165
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,244
Very impressive.
A little freaky, but I like this kid.

166
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,913
I love you.

167
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,752
I mean, we should hang out socially.
I just got a ping-pong table.

168
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,504
Not going to happen.

169
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,840
Go find out where his license plates are.
Everybody else, back to your holes.

170
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,802
He was actually right.
- I'm doing a background check on that kid.

171
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:23,556
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office,
to remind you of the mission!

172
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,058
"Change the world!"

173
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,851
- Okay, Evan, who do you know?
- What do you mean?

174
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,853
Oh, come on.
Yesterday we're in the basement.

175
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,855
Today, look at this place.
It's like the Emerald City!

176
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,192
"Enjoy your office.
Your neighbor, Congressman Long. "

177
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,361
Congressman Long did this?
Did you say "neighbor"?

178
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,280
That's right. He lives in Prestige Crest,
right up the street.

179
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,326
Evan, you got to tell me these things.
Think of the publicity angle on this!

180
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,704
You and Congressman Long having
a barbecue.

181
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,664
Congressman Long eating your hot dog.

182
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,457
Hate to break up
your little weenie roast.

183
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,210
Congressman Long's assistant
just dropped this off.

184
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,670
The Congressman would like for you

185
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,922
to junior cosponsor this bill
that he's introducing.

186
00:11:56,006 --> 00:12:00,218
Hold on. Congressman Long asked us to
junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?

187
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,971
The Citizens' Integration
of Public Lands Act.

188
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,056
Never heard of it. Gene, here, now.

189
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,392
- Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?
- I just did.

190
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,310
You need to tell me about it
before I need to know about it.

191
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,521
- Marty, you are not the vice congressman.
- I am the legislative...

192
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,233
Nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot
in the head, you do not automatically...

193
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,318
If Evan got shot in the head,
you're the first suspect.

194
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,445
Play nice. Play nice.

195
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,613
All right, Eugene, Congressman Long's bill.
What is it?

196
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,575
HR7124, better known as CINPLAN.

197
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,327
The bill would open up fringe areas
of the national parks for development.

198
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,912
Long's been sitting on it for ages...

199
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,956
Got it. Pause. Come on, Evan, this is huge.

200
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,541
You hitch your wagon to the right star,

201
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,752
you could ride all the way down
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

202
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,170
This is day one.

203
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,422
You got your name on a major piece
of legislation!

204
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,341
And another thing,
he wants you to read it today.

205
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,135
Well, I can't do it today.

206
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,303
- I promised my kids...
- Eugene.

207
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,430
Well, sir, there's a time clock on the bill.

208
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,599
If Congressman Long wants to pass it
this quarter,

209
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,809
he's going to have to introduce it
to the committee immediately.

210
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,395
I'm personally going with
whatever Congressman Baxter decides,

211
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,440
because if I could be like one man,
it'd be him.

212
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,858
Either him or Kareem.

213
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,194
- Can I tase him?
- Gene! Heel!

214
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,695
It'd probably be you.

215
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,449
Come on, Evan, this is it!
This is why we came here!

216
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,493
It's world-changing time!

217
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,705
Hey, anybody home?

218
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,917
- Hey, Dad. Come on. We're in here!
- Hey, guys.

219
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,796
Dad, guess what? I got all your stuff
packed up so that we can...

220
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,256
What's wrong?

221
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,842
We're not going, are we?

222
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,806
First things first.
I have been asked to junior cosponsor a bill.

223
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,557
Yeah.

224
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,060
See? I told you.
And you owe me five bucks.

225
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,561
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.

226
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,481
Hey. Hey, we said we would have
to make sacrifices, right?

227
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,733
Yeah. Whatever.
New house, same old dad.

228
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,944
Hey, I'm the one who has to read this thing!

229
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:45,114
Hey. Did you hear?
Junior cosponsor of a bill.

230
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:51,412
Okay, Ry, let's clean all this stuff up.
Dad's got work to do.

231
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,974
No. It's 6:14.

232
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,936
Of course. Voodoo clock speaks again.

233
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,528
What the...

234
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:28,867
Hey! Hey! Hey! No. Okay.

235
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,911
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! What's going on?

236
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,289
I got a delivery for Evan Baxter!

237
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,207
Yeah, that's not mine. I didn't order that!

238
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,836
I just deliver, guy, huh?
You got a complaint, call the number!

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,048
No! Hey! Listen! We are 416, not 614!

240
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:48,469
You've got the wrong house!
You can't leave that there!

241
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,014
Listen! Listen!

242
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,641
That's going to leave a brown patch!

243
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,144
I am a U.S. congressman!

244
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,158
Dad, what are you doing? I'm watching this.

245
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,743
Genesis 6:14.

246
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,165
Gen 6:14.

247
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,667
Joan! Do we have a Bible anywhere?

248
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,928
Genesis 6:14.

249
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,513
"Make thee an ark of gopherwood... "

250
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,474
Gopherwood.

251
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,530
"Go-four-wood. " Get it?

252
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,996
Well, it's not really gopherwood.
I just like the wordplay.

253
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,456
No, it's pine and maple.

254
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,001
It was clear-cut from this valley
to make room for all those houses.

255
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,795
Excuse me. Do I know you?

256
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,713
Not as well as I'd like.

257
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,759
I see you got my housewarming gift.

258
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,345
That was you? You sent those?

259
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,014
What are they for? Hey! Hey.

260
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,725
Genesis, chapter six, verse fourteen.

261
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,769
I want you to build an ark.

262
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,146
You want me to build an ark.

263
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,398
Yes.

264
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:28,569
So that's why the tools.
And you are responsible for the wood?

265
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,990
All right. Well, let's just start over.

266
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,826
Hello, I am Evan...

267
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,454
Evan Baxter. Born June 15, 1962.

268
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,872
Eight pounds, 11 ounces.

269
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,501
Mother's Carroll Ann Parker.
Father, Eugene Evan Baxter.

270
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,338
You have internet access. Very impressive.
Do you also have cable?

271
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,842
You're a clean freak. You care much
too much about your outward appearance.

272
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,511
Your left nipple is a quarter inch higher
than your right nipple.

273
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,639
And when you were a little boy,
you were afraid of Gumby.

274
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,308
Who are you?

275
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,853
I'm God.

276
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,147
- You're God?
- Yes.

277
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,776
And I want you, Evan Baxter, to build an ark.

278
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:14,991
Okay. You know what? This conversation
is a little thing I like to call over!

279
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:19,912
But I got to get going,
because, frankly, I have an ark to build.

280
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,083
Busy, busy, busy, busy. Nice meeting you.
Take care. Oh, and...

281
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,798
All right, see you later!

282
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,554
Shake it off, Evan. It's over.
The nutcase is gone.

283
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,807
I am successful, I'm powerful,
I'm handsome, I'm happy.

284
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,143
Successful, powerful, handsome, happy.

285
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,563
Get it out, son.
It's the beginning of wisdom.

286
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,732
How did you get in here?
I'm calling the cops.

287
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,902
Oh, no. No need! Look! Look.
There's one right there. Right there.

288
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:56,282
Officer! Officer! Officer! Carjacker!
Carjacker in the car! Carjacker in the car!

289
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,498
Careful pulling out.
Pedestrian in the crosswalk.

290
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,906
Shake it off, shake it off!
Shake it off, shake it off!

291
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,286
Good morning, chief!

292
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,622
Good morning, Rita.

293
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,125
You almost scared me to death!
What's wrong with you?

294
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,460
Nothing. Just sort of a weird ride in.

295
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,130
- Weird how?
- It was just a weird ride in.

296
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,632
Okay, well, thanks for clarifying.

297
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,468
- Here's your mail and your schedule.
- Okay.

298
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,139
And they finally fixed the phones.
My new extension is 614.

299
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,476
-614.
- Yeah. 614?

300
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,727
Right.

301
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,022
You want me to write that down?

302
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,941
I'd rather you didn't.

303
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,277
Good morning.

304
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,737
Hey, Long came through with that seat
on the House Resource Committee.

305
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,448
You stuck in your thumb
and pulled out a plum, my friend.

306
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,367
Also, the new Congressional plates
just came in.

307
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,871
Gene, plates, now.
And Alex at the Buffalo office had her baby.

308
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,873
- Boy or girl?
- A little boy. And here he is.

309
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,001
Just as cute as a button. Not bad
for such an ugly woman. Weighed in at...

310
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,752
Six pounds, 14 ounces.

311
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,839
- How'd you know that?
- Lucky guess.

312
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:40,970
Hot, hot, hot! Hot off the press!
It's a joke. Here are your plates, sir.

313
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,390
Those are rock-star plates, man.
You can park anywhere.

314
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,516
You can't be sitting in a chair.

315
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,101
You've got a committee meeting
in five minutes.

316
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,937
Come on, BMIC, Big Man in Congress.

317
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,106
Evan Baxter, the shark on the move.

318
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,616
House Resources Committee
is now in order.

319
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,868
The Chair recognizes the congresswoman
from Tennessee

320
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,412
to lead the Pledge ofAllegiance.

321
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,040
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...

322
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,834
- ... of the United States ofAmerica...
- ... of the United States ofAmerica...

323
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,588
- ... and to the Republic, for which it stands...
- ... and to the Republic, for which it stands...

324
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,506
- ... one nation, under me...
- ... one nation, under God...

325
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:21,802
- ... indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
- ... indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

326
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,974
How long do you want to do this, son?
I've got all eternity.

327
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,820
Hey. You okay, young man?

328
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,823
- What happened?
- You fainted.

329
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,742
Dropped like a leaf
during the Pledge ofAllegiance.

330
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,245
Chuck Long,
Resources Committee Chairman.

331
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:51,040
Oh. Oh. Congressman Long. Yes.
Oh, I'm so sorry about...

332
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:55,211
Forget it! Many a man's been humbled
by his first day in Congress.

333
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,671
So, how'd you like that office?

334
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,631
Oh, it was great. Yes. Thank you, sir.

335
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,133
Not bad for a freshman dorm room, huh?

336
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,927
So here's the skinny.

337
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,054
I'm bringing you into my land use bill

338
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,224
because you strike me as the type of guy
who knows how to hit the ground running.

339
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,894
Yes, sir. I read the bill, and it's great.
I just had a few questions.

340
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,105
Hey, I wrote the thing
and I have a few questions.

341
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,358
We'll get to the questions later.
So, you with us?

342
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,943
- Yes, sir. I'm in.
- Wonderful!

343
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,987
I'll need you to put that into
a letter of intent,

344
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,447
as soon as you're feeling up to it,
of course. You get yourself better.

345
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,949
Enjoy that office.

346
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,450
Thank you, sir.

347
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:31,080
He's exhausted from reading that bill.
I got woozy from just carrying it.

348
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,498
Evan, sit down.

349
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,582
Evan, what happened to you?

350
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,960
You can't faint during the Pledge
ofAllegiance. It's un-American.

351
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,295
Oh, good. The doctor's here.

352
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,379
Say "ah. "

353
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,926
Just go home, get some rest
and start on that ark. You hear me?

354
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,183
Evan?

355
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,895
Okay. "God warned Noah that
a great flood was coming.

356
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,982
"Noah built the ark
with his wife and three sons. "

357
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,443
I want strawberries!
I want strawberries!

358
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,112
Why don't you have some strawberries?

359
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,491
"The ark was 300 cubits long
and 50 cubits high. "

360
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,285
Oh, this is insane!

361
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,412
What's insane?

362
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,205
Congressman Long's bill?

363
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,961
Yeah. The bill. That's what I was looking at.
Oh, man, there's a lot of research to do.

364
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,215
You know, baby, you have every right
to be freaked out.

365
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,676
Freaked out. I'm not freaked out.
Why would I be freaked out?

366
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,679
I'm freaking out.
This house alone is a huge adjustment

367
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,808
and you've got a newjob,
and new land act bill you're working on.

368
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,186
We're in a new town.
I mean, that's a lot of new.

369
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,562
So, you think I'm just stressed?

370
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:40,983
Evan, honey, I've known you 20 years.
I know you're stressed.

371
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,364
Oh, my gosh! Dylan! Stop it!

372
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,200
- Well, that's the sugar kicking in.
- Yes, it is.

373
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,951
Thank you, hon.

374
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,579
- Eat your ice cream.
- I will. Thanks.

375
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:59,001
She's right. This is crazy.
I'm just stressed and you are gone.

376
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,966
Good morning, troops!

377
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,552
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?

378
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,637
Wow.

379
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,306
- Somebody's in a good mood.
- I am.

380
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,141
I thought about what you said
and you are right.

381
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,893
I need to get my head on straight.

382
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,938
Guess what? This weekend,
we are going on that hiking trip.

383
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,106
Yeah.

384
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,691
- Right here! High five me!
Righteous!

385
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,152
Righteous. We are going to have
a righteous hiking trip!

386
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,656
Hey, Dad, look, two doves.
That's supposed to be good luck.

387
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,533
Well, today must be my lucky day.

388
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,243
- Bye, guys! Bye.
Bye.

389
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,834
Good morning, kitties, keep moving.
It's not your house.

390
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,643
Hey, when you're on my lawn,
keep it in your butt!

391
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,445
Hey, thanks for sharing.

392
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,272
You're right on time.

393
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,734
Long just called. He's on his way with the
powers that be. Who are they, Gene? Talk.

394
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,861
Congressman Jim Dodd,
head of Ways and Means.

395
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,239
But don't worry, sir,
he's definitely not "way mean. "

396
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,907
That's speculation.
I don't know him personally...

397
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,075
That's too much, Gene. Who else?

398
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,244
Congressman Richard Stamp,
head of Commerce,

399
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,662
and Bob Hughes is Transportation.

400
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,080
I have a draft of your support letter.

401
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,040
- Sounds like a plan.
- Are you all right?

402
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,168
- I'm good.
- You sure you're good? Okay.

403
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,213
- Good morning, chief.
- Good morning, Rita.

404
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,506
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

405
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,383
- You don't look so good.
- That's what I said.

406
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,260
You're all jumpy. Are you on that Fen-Phen?

407
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,679
Guys, I'm fine. I'll be inside.

408
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,943
No, no, no, no.

409
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:16,657
No. Okay. No, no. No. No, no. No.

410
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,494
No, no, no. Oh, my gosh!

411
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,958
Guys! No, no! Get out! Get out! Oh, my hair!

412
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,502
Gentlemen, welcome.
What an honor to have you here.

413
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,879
I'm Marty Stringer.
I'm Congressman Baxter's chief of staff.

414
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,090
This is Rita Daniels, his executive assistant.

415
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,217
Are you ready, sir?

416
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:39,388
Just a minute. No, no, no, no.
Dirty, dirty, dirty! Big one!

417
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,891
Baxter's only a freshman, sir, but I think
you'll find he is locked and loaded.

418
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,853
Good. Maybe this young stud can help me
get these old mares on board.

419
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,438
Oh, you'll be impressed.

420
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,944
Gentlemen, good to see you.

421
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,700
Do you want to explain yourself,
Congressman? What is going on?

422
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,910
Oh, these

423
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,331
are birds.

424
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,958
What are they doing here?
How did they get in here?

425
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,836
Well, that is an excellent question.

426
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,173
And my response to said question is,

427
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,175
they are trained

428
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,178
aviaries, sir.

429
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,682
Let me make you see
what I'm talking about.

430
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:30,481
I can make any sort of movement,
and they will not get off!

431
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,858
Do you have a point, Congressman?

432
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,069
Hey, guys, what's the point?

433
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,238
What's my point?

434
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,033
I'll tell you.

435
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,285
The point is

436
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,748
that man

437
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,419
needs to dominate creatures

438
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,756
and, ultimately, man must

439
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:00,094
dictate what happens in this country.

440
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,891
God bless America.

441
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,812
I couldn't agree more.

442
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,648
- You have got to be kidding me.
No, of course not.

443
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:16,485
We lost a huge project last year
because of the red-headed woodpecker.

444
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,529
Those environmentalists got so up in arms

445
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,365
over the potential disappearance
of one stupid bird...

446
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,908
Yeah, birds are stupid sometimes.

447
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,703
...we lost over $25 million in business.

448
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,706
I see where you're going with this,
Congressman. Good work!

449
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,793
Your little display has obviously hit a chord.
Gentlemen.

450
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:41,677
From now on, let's keep the surprises
to a maximum of, say, none. Understood?

451
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,762
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

452
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,859
Evan, that was brilliant. Risky, but brilliant.

453
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,571
What the...

454
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:05,659
I'll tell you one thing, these birds had
a nice big meal before they flew in here.

455
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,119
You want me to get my BB gun?

456
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,288
You know what I want you to do?
I want you to open the door.

457
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,582
- Open the door?
- Just open the door!

458
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,084
Close the door after I leave! Just do it!

459
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,169
Okay.

460
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,172
One, two, three!

461
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,514
Man, if I get the bird flu,
he is paying for my medical bills!

462
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,651
Sheep!

463
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,370
Oh, no.

464
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,337
Oh, gosh.

465
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,382
Go, go, go! Get out!

466
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,701
Okay. No.

467
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,581
No. No.

468
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,127
I'm not doing this. It's insane!

469
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,380
No!

470
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,007
Enough already!

471
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,552
See, if you had an ark,
you'd have a place to put them all.

472
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,387
Why are you doing this? Why me?

473
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,976
It's not time yet. Go on. Go on.

474
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,894
Yeah, go on.

475
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,189
So how about it?
Feel like living on the edge?

476
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,494
Beautiful, isn't it?
I remember creating this valley.

477
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,039
Notice how the mountains line up east
to west.

478
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,458
That's so there'd be lots of sunshine.

479
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,002
Where are we?

480
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,213
Don't recognize it, eh?

481
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,423
No.

482
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,719
This is where you live, son.
This is Prestige Crest.

483
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,973
I wanted you to see the original design.

484
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,741
So, you're really him, aren't you?

485
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,077
You want more proof? I haven't done
the pillar of salt thing in a while.

486
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,915
That's all right. I believe you. I just...
I don't understand why you chose me.

487
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,459
You want to change the world, son.

488
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,461
So do I.

489
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,426
What? Well, why an ark?
I mean, that's like flood territory.

490
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,805
You wouldn't do that again.
You wouldn't do that. Would you do that?

491
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,642
Let's just say that whatever I do,

492
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,353
I do because I love you.

493
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:24,483
Well, then you have to understand
that this whole building-an-ark thing

494
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,068
is really not part of my plans here.

495
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,029
I need to settle into my house.
I need to make a good impression at work.

496
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,823
What?

497
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,242
Your plans. That's just...

498
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,913
What are you talking...

499
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,457
We're talking about an ark, right?
I mean, an ark?

500
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:44,044
An ark is huge!
I don't even know where I would begin!

501
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,921
Well, I hear that a lot.

502
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,633
People want to change the world,
don't know how to begin.

503
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,056
You want to know
how to change the world, son?

504
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,767
One act of random kindness at a time.

505
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,860
Build the ark.

506
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:12,030
I'll tell you what. You build it, I'll fill it.

507
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:17,452
And if anybody asks, tell them
a flood's coming.

508
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,748
Oh, and you might need this.

509
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,923
Well, okay. Okay, so what do I do?
I grab the wood and...

510
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,508
Well, okay.

511
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,928
You know, that's just cruel.

512
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,973
Do you see him?

513
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,600
I don't see him.

514
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,105
"Building an Ark the Old-Fashioned Way. "

515
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,694
"God is the creator of the Heavens
and the Earth.

516
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:55,657
"He lives in all things and has over
six billion seven hundred million children. "

517
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,390
Honey? You okay?
You need something?

518
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,729
No, nothing. Just dropped something.

519
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,391
Okay. Okay.

520
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,775
Yeah.

521
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,861
There we go. Okay.

522
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,413
Come on. I mean, a beard?
A beard's so dirty.

523
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,291
Gross!

524
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,544
...packing, so it would
really help me out if you would...

525
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,838
- Good morning.
- Hey, hey, hey, good morning.

526
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,090
Wow.

527
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,801
What's with the scruffle, mountain man?

528
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:43,306
Oh, well, you know, I figured it was
a weekend, and I thought...

529
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,474
What?

530
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,230
Honey, did I miss something?
How long have you been growing that?

531
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,066
I'll get the door!

532
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,653
- Congratulations!
- What are you talking about?

533
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,614
The lots. You bought the lots next door!

534
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,366
Hello!

535
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:12,085
And pulling the down payment out of
your home equity? Very gutsy move.

536
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,296
I didn't do that, did I?

537
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,923
You sure did. So what's your plan?
What are you gonna do?

538
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,801
Turn them for a quick profit?
Build them out on spec?

539
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:24,723
Who wants champagne? Hip, hip hooray!

540
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,352
You bought eight lots?

541
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,897
Yup. I was going to surprise you.

542
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,568
"Surprise, surprise, surprise. " Gomer Pyle.

543
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,156
What are you doing? We can't afford that.

544
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,617
Hey, Mom.
John Lennon, good to see you again.

545
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,285
Good to see you.

546
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,207
And eight lots?
What are you going to do with eight lots?

547
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,877
I don't know. Maybe I'll build a boat.

548
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,754
Did you say "build a boat"?

549
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,672
It might be something fun for the family.

550
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,800
We could take the boat,
go sailing on the lake.

551
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,970
It'd be great in case it floods or something.

552
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,056
What is going on with you?

553
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,268
You bought all those lots
and you're talking about building a boat.

554
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,229
- Yeah.
- And you grow this crazy beard!

555
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,897
Is this, like, a midlife crisis?

556
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,315
It's not that bad!

557
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,399
- It's not?
- No.

558
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,318
Why do you think they call it a crisis?

559
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,155
Hey, keep it down, you guys! Okay?

560
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,741
Oh, my God.

561
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,744
- Honey?
- Oh, my God.

562
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,996
Honey?

563
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,084
I know this sounds crazy.

564
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,587
I really think I need to do this.

565
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,384
Okay.

566
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,803
Build your boat.

567
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,265
Just don't take too long, okay?

568
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:53,603
Because we didn't leave our lives in Buffalo
so you could sail the S.S. Depression.

569
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,416
Here we go.

570
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,836
Gentlemen, I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've assembled you here today.

571
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,672
An Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

572
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,757
Wow, that's huge. He must be proud.

573
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:27,429
So, I have come up with a little
construction project for us this weekend.

574
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,056
- The whole weekend?
- The whole weekend. Yes!

575
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,891
And maybe a couple weekends after that.

576
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,060
I can do this. Help!

577
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,648
How do I stand up with a piece of wood?
Here we go.

578
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,526
Oh, man. Okay, that's good.

579
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,823
Mother! Father! Sister! Brother! Wow!

580
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,533
Keep it straight.

581
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,580
Hey, Dad, he's back!

582
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,457
Ryan, no, don't do...

583
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,337
Leverage it up! Leverage. Okay.

584
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,005
Just put some leverage.
You got to put some body weight.

585
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,174
Ready? One, two, three. Come on.

586
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,763
Oh, I'm an idiot.

587
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,266
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Congressman.
Why do you have raw beef hands?"

588
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,393
"Well, I'm building an ark. "

589
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,232
I got a boo-boo! I got a boo-boo!
I got a boo-boo!

590
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:31,910
You ever hear of Home Depot?
Here we go! Here we go! Oh, yeah!

591
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:46,132
All right. So our little Marlboro Man moment
didn't work out so well.

592
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,927
It's a disaster. I don't know
how to build something like this.

593
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,762
That's easy. Just don't.

594
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,226
Wow.

595
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,145
Hello.

596
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,315
Yes, Marty.
Your fearless leader is right here.

597
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,651
Hey, Marty, what's up?

598
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,663
Yes, I'll tell him. Thank you.

599
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,627
I might need security. Thank you.

600
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,507
- Can I help you?
- Rita, it's me.

601
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,594
Why do you sound like Evan Baxter,
but look like a Bee Gee?

602
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,346
Okay. All right.

603
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,474
Okay, that's great. It's longer.

604
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,519
Oh, my God. It is you.

605
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,272
Evan, what happened?

606
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,399
- Did you fall in a mine shaft?
- No.

607
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,568
- Did you just come out of a coma?
- No.

608
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,862
Were you attacked by a werewolf?

609
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,113
No, I wasn't.

610
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,158
Well, if you were going for that rugged look,
you overshot it.

611
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,784
You look like a bum in a suit.

612
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,870
You need Supercuts and a shave.

613
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,623
Right! Yeah. But I can't. It doesn't work.

614
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,751
- What do you mean, it doesn't work?
- It doesn't work!

615
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,462
What? Are you shooting up Rogaine?

616
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:09,924
Rita, if Evan shows up... I'm sorry, sir.
I'll be with you in just one...

617
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,801
- Evan?
- Take it in. Take it in.

618
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,636
Okay, yeah, to answer any questions
you may have,

619
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,805
I am going through adult puberty!

620
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,308
This is all temporary.
Why did you bring me down here?

621
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,269
- What was so important?
- What is so important?

622
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,938
I've got a letter of intent here
about Congressman Long's bill.

623
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,023
You remember that, don't you?

624
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,151
Well, you haven't been here and now
he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!

625
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,487
No, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope.
Not gonna happen.

626
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,531
No. You can't do that.
Not looking like that. You have to go shave!

627
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,825
I can't shave, Marty.
When I shave, it grows back out.

628
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,870
That happens when you shave!
But then you shave again!

629
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,538
You have no idea.

630
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,625
Evan, what is going on?

631
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,876
I'm...

632
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,174
Building something.

633
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,385
You're building something?

634
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,179
Well, I hope it's a barber shop.

635
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:59,140
Guys, I can't let Long see me
this way, okay?

636
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,936
You're gonna have to tell him I'm sick.
Just cover for me. Just help me out!

637
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,608
Come on, Evan, be reasonable.
You got to get rid of that beard.

638
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,527
I need your face back. I need you back.

639
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,195
Can you at least tell me
what you're building?

640
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:14,239
- I'm building a boat.
- You're building a boat?

641
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,200
Look, you got to cover for me.
I don't want anybody to see...

642
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,494
Congressman! There you are!

643
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,538
Congressman Long, I, I, I, I...

644
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,499
Stop stammering, son.
We all play hooky from time to time.

645
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,419
I'm not gonna turn you in to the principal.
Mostly because I am the principal.

646
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,922
Very good.

647
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,299
What's with the veil?
Did you get your new set of braces?

648
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,761
No, no. No. That's hilarious, though.

649
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:40,515
Would you drop that thing, son?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

650
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,067
It's a wife thing, sir.

651
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,778
Just trying to spice up the love life.

652
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,239
She's a big Loggins and Messina fan.

653
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,616
Keeping it fresh. Keeping it real.

654
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,369
Would you excuse us for a moment?

655
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,539
The Congressman and I are going
to have a little chat.

656
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,002
Come on.

657
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,254
Nice, isn't it? Politics is dog-eat-dog,

658
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,965
but if you survive, they give you
a bigger den. Have a seat.

659
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:18,094
So, tell me, Congressman,
are you freaking out on me or what?

660
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,137
No, sir.

661
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,515
Oh, come on, son. I hand you
your first cosponsorship of a bill,

662
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,892
and when you finally show up
you look like the fifth Beatle.

663
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,186
Now, you expect me to believe
everything is hunky dory?

664
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,148
Well, sir, actually, things have been
a little more dory.

665
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:34,402
Of course they are. I get it.
You know anything about animals, son?

666
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,198
The Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

667
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:44,537
Although you probably already know that.
Or have heard it. Not experienced it.

668
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,749
- You ever heard of the Arctic white wolf?
- No, sir.

669
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,958
Top of the food chain.

670
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,669
It's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself,
but it chooses not to.

671
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,338
It chooses to run with a pack.

672
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,548
- And do you know why?
- No.

673
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,176
The Arctic white wolf,
Congressman, realizes

674
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,011
that it is stronger as part of a group.

675
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:03,014
Do you know what happens when one of
these wolves decides to fend for itself?

676
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,892
The pack kills the loner
for the greater good of the community.

677
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,644
Ouch, that hurts.

678
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,980
Are you familiar with Jim Jenkins,
the junior congressman from Tennessee?

679
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,484
When I met Congressman Jenkins,
he was fresh off the turnip truck,

680
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,486
but now he's sitting on his own committee.

681
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,906
Congressman Jenkins, Congressman
Whitehall, Congressman Freeman,

682
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,534
they all have committee chairs
because they all run with the pack.

683
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,870
Now, you have to come to a decision.

684
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,164
Are you gonna run with the pack
or are you gonna lone wolf it?

685
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,416
I am a pack man, sir.

686
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:34,587
Good. I'm introducing the CINPLAN bill
in 2 weeks. C-SPAN is covering it live.

687
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,798
I want your full support and nothing else.

688
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,383
Yes, sir.

689
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,844
Those fish are on you like bait on a hook.

690
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,806
Birds follow you.

691
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,350
Fish follow you.

692
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,232
Let's see if we can get some congressmen
to follow you.

693
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,359
Let's get this bill passed,
shall we, Congressman?

694
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,777
Yes, sir.

695
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,364
Hey, fleabag, out of the way.

696
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,449
Hey, Dad, I think there are more animals
than yesterday.

697
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,910
Well, let's not keep our audience waiting,
shall we?

698
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:13,126
Up, up. Push it up. Push it.
We got it. We got it. Oh, yeah, yeah.

699
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,629
Come on. Just let it go, just let it go.

700
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,468
Dad, we can do this,
but we're gonna need some help.

701
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,805
I know. We just need something
to lift those beams.

702
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,559
Like that?

703
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,227
Holy moly!

704
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,939
This is so totally awesome!

705
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,566
This is perfect.

706
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,443
Dad, there's a note.

707
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,992
Let me see that.

708
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,204
How does it work?

709
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,630
Dad, this is really weird.

710
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,008
Repeat after me, "We are hamsters!"

711
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,718
- We are hamsters!
- We are hamsters!

712
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,428
Leg power!

713
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,971
- Leg power!
- Leg power!

714
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,765
And it's in!

715
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,184
That's it.

716
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,022
Hey, who has opposable thumbs? Anybody?

717
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,946
You want to try this one?
Make sure it's straight.

718
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,615
This is awesome!
This is so cool.

719
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,700
Here we go.
Oh, my God!

720
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:31,370
Yeah. Gotta do the dance.
Come on, let's do the dance.

721
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,540
- We're doing the dance.
Dylan, come on. Do the dance.

722
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,376
Come on, do the dance.
I'm not doing the dance.

723
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,716
- Don't scratch!
- Stop it. Come here.

724
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,303
Insult to injury! My!

725
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,430
- Good boy.
- Okay, guys. A little bit more.

726
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,517
Here we go. I got it. Keep it... That's it!

727
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,811
Beautiful!

728
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,485
You guys all right?
Yup.

729
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:20,920
"G."

730
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,192
Well, I hope this isn't our last supper.

731
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,153
There's no sign
of our heat wave breaking,

732
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:48,030
so this dry, hot weather will continue.

733
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,033
Until September 22, midday.

734
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,245
If the ark isn't finished by then, you will be.

735
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,957
Is that when it's going to happen?
September 22, midday?

736
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,376
High temperatures
tomorrow back into the 90s everywhere,

737
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,627
right on through Tuesday

738
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,214
and the next seven days,
no showers, no storms.

739
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:09,468
That would be a good day to have chicken.
How about Mom's chicken?

740
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:13,222
Hon, could we have some more chicken
September 22, midday?

741
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,268
Boys, will you excuse us, please?
Your father and I need to have a little talk.

742
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,895
Busted.

743
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,647
Dad, you're busted.
- Yeah, I know.

744
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,943
- What are you doing?
- Do we have anything unleavened?

745
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:29,572
Yeah, we do, it's in the back,
next to the frankincense and myrrh.

746
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,825
We have a fancy name for it in this century,
it's called pita.

747
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,705
- Got it.
- Evan, what is happening to you?

748
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:41,125
Don't! No! Just put it down! Look at you.

749
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:46,631
The hair. Are you on something?
Is it a mega-growth hormone? What?

750
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,884
Evan, talk to me.

751
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,144
I'm building an ark.

752
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,689
What does that mean?

753
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:09,070
God appeared to me
and told me to build an ark.

754
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:13,074
He said there was going to be a flood
and that I should be prepared.

755
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,618
Whenever I shave,
my beard grows right back out.

756
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:20,748
My hair grows longer every day.
This robe... God sent me the robe.

757
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:23,125
He thought it would be funny.

758
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,964
I actually think it's really comfortable.
That's why I'm wearing it.

759
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,218
The beard, the robe.

760
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,720
You're Noah?

761
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,265
Yeah, kind of.

762
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,685
- Mom!
- Not now, Noah!

763
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,230
- Dylan.
- Okay.

764
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,278
We left everything behind to come here.

765
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:55,116
Maybe that's put too much pressure on you.
I don't know.

766
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,662
But this has got to stop. Please.
You're scaring me.

767
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:04,417
The boys need their father back,
and I need my husband back.

768
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,603
Yes. Successful. Powerful.
Handsome. Happy.

769
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,523
Successful. Powerful. Handsome. Happy.

770
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,576
Good morning!

771
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,082
Cold today, huh?

772
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,720
"Back to work"?

773
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:06,979
Okay. All right. You want me
to wear the robe? I'll wear the robe.

774
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,317
Two can play this game.

775
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,996
Pice de rsistance.

776
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,459
The student has become the teacher.

777
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,256
This meeting will come to order.

778
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,591
Rita, any sign of him?

779
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,968
Marty, I told you,
I will let you know as soon as...

780
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,347
You know what? You got me. He's here.
We're in the middle of a yoga class.

781
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,265
Rita, this is no time forjokes.
I'm not kidding.

782
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,726
If he's not in that meeting,
we're all out of a job.

783
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,479
Wait a minute.
Let me finish my sun salutation.

784
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:58,864
- Marty! Sorry I'm late. Come on, let's go.
- What is that?

785
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,576
Making lemonade out of lemons.
Pick up your phone! Come on!

786
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,955
At its heart,
this bill gives private citizens access

787
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:08,082
to lands they technically already own.

788
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,792
Will the Chairman yield?

789
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:12,128
- Oh, look, there he is.
- Yup, yup, I see him.

790
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:16,132
Access is just a word you're using
to hide what's really going on here.

791
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,759
This is about development,
short and simple.

792
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:23,973
Evan, what are you doing?
You have a pony tail on your face!

793
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,433
What you gonna do next?
Cornrow your eyebrows?

794
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,145
Development means
the advancement ofjobs,

795
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:32,857
an increase in domestic commerce.
If you happen to like those things,

796
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:37,319
I invite you to join myself and
my cosponsors, Congressman Dodd,

797
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,448
Congressman Hughes

798
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,493
and Congressman Baxter.

799
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,808
Did you just do a wardrobe change?

800
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:10,895
What do you think this is, the Oscars?
You are not Whoopi.

801
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,481
Ladies and gentlemen! Please!

802
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,695
Please! Congressman Baxter has a tendency
to embrace the theatrical

803
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,448
in his support of this bill.
Congressman, let me warn you,

804
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:26,035
you are approximately 10 seconds away
from committee censure.

805
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,663
Oh, no. Hey, would anyone mind
if I close the window?

806
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:03,072
Ladies and gentlemen! Please!
These animals are trained!

807
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,907
I've seen this circus act before!

808
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,910
Congressman, I'm sure St. Francis
would be envious.

809
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:11,622
We, however, are not.
You have five seconds.

810
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,541
You march yourself and your
little animal troupe out of here now

811
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,502
or you will be forcibly removed.

812
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,005
- I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
- Congressman!

813
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,425
- These animals are not trained.
- Congressman!

814
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,722
- I think they want me to save them!
- Save them from what, Congressman?

815
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:32,184
Saving the animals, okay.
I can roll with that. That's a good idea.

816
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:40,985
The flood.

817
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,862
A flood? Rolling out.

818
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,698
The flood.

819
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,908
This has been the hottest, driest summer
on record

820
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,618
and you say we're going to have a flood?

821
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,205
- When might we expect this?
- September 22, midday.

822
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,713
- That's what I was told.
- Might I ask who told you?

823
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:11,181
Not in front of all those people.
Don't say it. Don't say it.

824
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,813
God.

825
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,323
- God? You talk to God?
- Yes.

826
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:32,077
And God is talking back?
- Yeah. We hung out a little.

827
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,747
Well, time to update the rsum.

828
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,207
Congressman, your name is being removed
from this bill.

829
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,711
Obviously, the stresses of this office
have proven too much for you.

830
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,089
- Please have the congressman removed.
- No. Please! You don't understand!

831
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,967
God commanded me to build an ark!

832
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,636
It's going to rain!
There's going to be a flood!

833
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:55,059
- Remove him now!
- We have to prepare ourselves!

834
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,853
I need to finish the ark!

835
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:01,398
Remove him now!

836
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,282
Does this mean we're moving back home?

837
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,327
Home, Canada. One or the other.

838
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:28,675
Joan? I know you probably saw
what happened, but I can explain.

839
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:36,308
Take the stuff to the car, guys.
I'll be there in a minute.

840
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,686
Guys?

841
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:48,320
I'm gonna take them to my mother's.
Evan, I think you need help.

842
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:53,700
Joan, please. I'm not doing this.
It's not me. It's him.

843
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,079
I went to that meeting in a suit,
and he took it off of me.

844
00:56:57,163 --> 00:57:00,916
Those animals are following me
because of him.

845
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,628
God?
Does God know he's destroying our lives?

846
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:07,256
Does God know
he's going to get you fired?

847
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,842
Yeah! He's trying to get me fired!

848
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,053
He is trying to get me fired!

849
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,305
That way I'll have more time
to work on the ark!

850
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,891
Because the rain
and the floods are coming.

851
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,395
No, I heard you, Evan.
The whole world heard you.

852
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,106
Joan, please, you gotta believe me.

853
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:31,363
There it is! It's happening!
It's happening! It's raining!

854
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:50,382
Goodbye, Evan.

855
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,845
Joan!

856
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:08,192
I know! I know. Whatever you do,
you do because you love me!

857
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,785
Do me a favor. Love me less.

858
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,205
Congressman!

859
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:24,249
Are you concerned at all
about Congressman Baxter's tirade

860
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,001
and the adverse effects it may have
on your bill?

861
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:29,838
The day it rains and floods and
Congressman Baxter takes a ride on his ark,

862
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,924
that'll be the day I'll be concerned.
Thank you.

863
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:41,350
His name is Evan Baxter,
but now he goes by "New York's Noah,"

864
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:45,103
"Heaven's Evan,"
"The Weirdo with a Beardo. "

865
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:53,779
Okay, guys. Watch it. Watch it.
Coming through. Watch your back.

866
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:59,117
Marty, will you comment on Congressman
Baxter's change of appearance?

867
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,205
Yes, his hair is long.
Yes, his beard is unshaven.

868
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,499
Are you equally stunned
by this man's appearance?

869
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,090
The way things go around here,

870
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,968
if he gets any crazier,
we may end up in the White House.

871
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,977
Hey! No, no, no! That's my cup!

872
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,854
Whatever.

873
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,129
He's filling the boat
with two of every kind of animal.

874
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,507
Still to be collected,
two giraffes, two elephants

875
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,468
and one more jackass.

876
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,141
- What an idiot.
- He's a mook.

877
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:05,642
Jerks.

878
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,021
Don't worry about it, you guys.
Come on, eat up.

879
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,356
- Not hungry.
- Yeah, me neither.

880
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,734
You guys can't eat. I can't stop.

881
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,736
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- Me, too?

882
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,698
- Okay. Dylan, go with them. Please?
- Fine.

883
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,038
- Excuse me. Can I get a refill, please?
- Coming right up.

884
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,123
Thank you.

885
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,335
- Excuse me. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

886
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,049
- No. It's a long story.
- Well, I like stories.

887
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,011
I'm considered a bit of a storyteller myself.

888
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,182
My husband...
Have you heard of "New York's Noah"?

889
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,853
- The guy who's building the ark.
- That's him.

890
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:53,065
I love that story, Noah and the Ark.

891
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,733
You know, a lot of people miss the point
of that story.

892
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:57,402
They think it's about God's wrath and anger.

893
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:02,032
- They love it when God gets angry.
- What is the story about, then? The ark?

894
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:07,496
Well, I think it's a love story
about believing in each other.

895
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:13,293
You know, the animals showed up in pairs.
They stood by each other, side by side,

896
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:17,673
just like Noah and his family.
Everybody entered the ark side by side.

897
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:21,635
But my husband says God told him to do it.

898
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,932
- What do you do with that?
- Sounds like an opportunity.

899
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,187
Let me ask you something.

900
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:36,024
If someone prays for patience,
you think God gives them patience?

901
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,403
Or does he give them
the opportunity to be patient?

902
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:43,115
If they pray for courage,
does God give them courage,

903
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,535
or does he give them opportunities
to be courageous?

904
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,540
If someone prayed
for their family to be closer,

905
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:55,335
you think God zaps them
with warm, fuzzy feelings?

906
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,880
Or does he give them opportunities
to love each other?

907
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:05,137
Well, I got to run.
A lot of people to serve. Enjoy.

908
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:15,188
Guess this comes as no surprise to
those who remember his campaign promise,

909
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,023
"I will lower taxes,

910
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,651
"go crazy and build a gigantic ark. "

911
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,703
Oh, my gosh.

912
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,585
Evan!
- Dad?

913
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,795
- Honey!
- Dad?

914
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,047
You guys, I'm up here.

915
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,816
- Rough week?
You look really funny.

916
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:03,236
- You look really old.
- Yeah, well, he is really old.

917
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,532
- Why'd you come back?
- It was the kids.

918
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,619
- Tell him, guys.
- We like you better as the crazy guy.

919
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:13,038
You spend time with us
and you're home a lot more.

920
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:16,249
Just, please don't make us do
the dance anymore.

921
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:41,817
I don't know what's going on,
or what you're going through,

922
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:48,240
but we got into this as a family
and we're gonna get out of it as a family,

923
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,826
side by side.

924
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:01,670
But, Evan, we have to talk about the ark.
It has to come down.

925
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,631
- I can't do that.
- You don't have a choice.

926
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,426
Congressman Long went to the city.
There's a laundry list of code violations.

927
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,012
You have until September 22
to take it down,

928
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,014
or they'll take it down and arrest you.

929
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,601
- September 22. That's the day of the flood.
- Mom! Dad! Come here!

930
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,212
Don't you dare take that ark down.

931
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,675
How are we gonna do this?

932
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,011
There's no way the five
of us can finish on time.

933
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:53,138
We don't have money to hire anybody else.

934
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,228
Is that a llama with a hammer?

935
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:04,399
An alpaca. They rarely spit at people
unless frightened or abused.

936
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:08,194
Let's finish this sucker.

937
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:13,909
Come on, let's go.

938
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,410
No one knows where they came from

939
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,287
or how the congressman is getting them
to do it,

940
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:23,251
but, two by two, animals of all kinds
are working with Godspeed to build this ark.

941
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,836
Thank you.

942
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:28,131
If this flood really does happen,
"Evan help us. "

943
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,509
Hey! A little help?

944
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,306
Thanks.

945
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:38,683
Here it is, hon.

946
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,854
Perfect. Thanks.

947
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,234
Hold it right there.

948
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,905
This is Ed Carson coming to you live
from New York Noah's construction site,

949
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:57,077
where we are unable to leave the news van
due to hazardous conditions outside.

950
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,206
- High five.
- High five.

951
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,290
Good job.

952
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,668
Hey, putty tat.

953
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,549
Go, go, go! He tried to eat me!

954
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:14,552
Dylan! Jordan! Check it out!
Your mom's building an ark!

955
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,971
Let's do the dance.

956
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,056
No, please, no.

957
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,644
Well, where did
the animals come from, then?

958
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:25,313
Please. It's a trick.
It's a circus is what it is.

959
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,483
Wild animals running amok
in suburban Virginia.

960
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:32,404
With all these species,
what's being done about the feces?

961
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:43,665
Evan Baxter! You have gone from newsman
to congressman to caveman.

962
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,543
What makes you so sure God chose you?

963
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,254
He chose all of us.

964
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,557
Time to wash up, you guys.

965
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,356
Thanks.

966
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,278
You want some?

967
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,634
Why couldn't
the man just buy a Corvette?

968
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,930
Well, well, well. There they are.
It is good to see you guys.

969
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:46,061
It's good to see you! Your hair looks great.
It's very regal. Man, I love your hair!

970
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,729
And you're still sucking up.

971
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,856
- So, why are you here?
- Long locked us out.

972
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,940
He can't do that.

973
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,234
I mean, I've been suspended,
but I'm still a congressman.

974
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,570
- Rita, tell him what you know.
- Tell me what?

975
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:58,406
I smelled a rat
the second we got that office.

976
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,575
You don't get an office like that
for nothing.

977
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:04,954
- So I had the stalker here do some research.
- Okay, Eugene, talk.

978
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,290
Prestige Crest used to be federal lands,

979
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,001
but what's interesting is
how it got into private hands.

980
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:12,629
Congressman Long got the approval
to build a dam

981
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:15,632
and then passed out the surrounding lands
to a group of private investors.

982
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,050
Now, the locals fought this thing for years.

983
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,385
They said Long and his developer buddies
were cutting corners,

984
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,721
like skipping important building code
checkpoints.

985
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:24,891
And with the land use bill, he's gonna do
the same thing with the national parks.

986
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:28,645
So, you stand by and shake your pom-poms
while Long and his buddies get rich.

987
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:30,855
What can we do? I'm suspended.

988
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,359
Go back to the Hill and show them
that you can and will fight this bill.

989
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:37,403
You guys, I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I have to get back to the ark.

990
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:39,155
The ark? All right. Okay.

991
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,157
- God told you to build an ark?
- Yes.

992
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,285
But did he tell you to make your friends
believe in you and follow you here

993
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:48,581
so you can make us look stupid?
'Cause I go to church every Sunday.

994
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,917
Okay, every other Sunday.

995
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:54,462
I've been to church!
And that does not sound like God to me.

996
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,923
Rita, I know
that this doesn't make any sense.

997
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:59,676
I just want you to trust me.
You just have to have faith.

998
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,389
Evan, faith will not fight this bill.
The CINPLAN vote is today!

999
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:08,184
If we're going to stop this thing,
you need to get down to Capitol Hill now!

1000
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:12,564
- Otherwise, it's impossible!
- Dad, Dad, I think it's done.

1001
01:10:11,123 --> 01:10:15,376
What in the world?
I can't even get my cat to use the litter box.

1002
01:10:56,794 --> 01:11:01,214
It's September 22, and we're all still here.

1003
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:02,799
Awkward!

1004
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:06,261
People! The flood is imminent!

1005
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:11,474
- Board the ark! Save yourselves!
Get down, you fool!

1006
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,937
Listen to me! The time has come!

1007
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:20,108
No, Captain Ahab! Your time has come!

1008
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:26,114
Yeah, Baxter! The weather's 70 and sunny
with a chance of crazy!

1009
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:37,583
- Do you hear that? The rains are upon us!
- Dad, I don't think that's the rains.

1010
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,632
Hey, Baxter! Kiss your ark goodbye!

1011
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,564
- Where is he?
- On the boat, sir.

1012
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,358
Give me a minute.
Lets see if I can convince "Noah"

1013
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,610
that the world doesn't have to end today.

1014
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,326
I gotta hand it to you,
this is quite the show.

1015
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,454
According to my source,
the show hasn't even started yet.

1016
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,205
Still expecting the big flood.

1017
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,541
You know, voters don't respond
to the gloom and doom stuff.

1018
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:21,794
- They like a more positive message.
- Like the one you're sending with your bill?

1019
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,838
How much did you make off of all this land?

1020
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:27,175
You are destroying
our national parks for profit.

1021
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:29,135
You have a problem
with somebody taking a little profit?

1022
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,762
It's called business, son.

1023
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,348
So if I need to get a message out there,
or get a congressman elected

1024
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:37,477
there are people who pay for it, and yes,
those people want this bill to happen

1025
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:41,647
and, by God, it's gonna happen.
Now you look down there.

1026
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,025
Those are the wolves, son.

1027
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:47,195
I'm gonna give you one last chance.
Take down this boat.

1028
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,032
I'm giving you one last chance. Repent.

1029
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:56,204
Such a shame. You had possibilities.

1030
01:12:56,288 --> 01:13:00,166
But you want to stop progress
to save the Earth. Go for it.

1031
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:03,211
Good luck getting a tree
to come to the polls.

1032
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:09,634
Take it down.

1033
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:20,144
This is a court order
approving the demolition of this boat!

1034
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,231
Evacuate immediately!
You have three minutes!

1035
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:30,113
Honey. We have to go.
They're going to destroy the boat.

1036
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,031
No.

1037
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:34,992
It can't end this way.

1038
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:40,331
Is it too much to ask
for a little precipitation?

1039
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:45,253
Honey, maybe God didn't mean
a literal flood.

1040
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:50,633
Maybe he meant a flood of knowledge
or emotion or awareness.

1041
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,301
If that's true,

1042
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,431
I am going to be so pissed.

1043
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:57,765
Two minutes!

1044
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:01,269
Get off the boat now
or you will be removed by force.

1045
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,897
Evan, you did it. You built the ark.

1046
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,942
- That's all you were asked to do, right?
- No.

1047
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:12,238
There's something else.
Something's going to happen. I can feel it.

1048
01:14:12,322 --> 01:14:15,116
Yeah, what's gonna happen is
tear gas and a wrecking ball.

1049
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,201
Evan, think of the kids.

1050
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,704
One minute!

1051
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:25,501
- Dad, whatever you say, I'm with you.
- Yeah, me, too.

1052
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,670
Me, too.
But can we keep some of the animals?

1053
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:30,006
I like the alpaca. He spits.

1054
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,847
You're right. We did it. We built the boat.

1055
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:39,223
Yeah.

1056
01:14:40,225 --> 01:14:42,643
Let's go. Let's go, guys. Come on.

1057
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,450
Well, I guess they don't want to go.

1058
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:00,620
- It's their instinct.
- What do you mean, hon?

1059
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:05,458
Some animals know when weather's coming.
When they feel it coming, they sit.

1060
01:15:13,592 --> 01:15:14,717
Joan!

1061
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:26,646
Okay. Time's up! We're coming in!

1062
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:29,941
Get that ball in position!
We're clearing them out!

1063
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:44,163
Is that rain? It's raining.

1064
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:46,791
Lucky guess, Baxter. Lucky guess.

1065
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:07,562
Looks like the drought's finally over.
Good news, eh, Congressman?

1066
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,814
Yeah. Good news.

1067
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:17,822
Everybody! Please! Get on the ark!

1068
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,325
Go to the car!

1069
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,496
Please! Everyone! On the ark!

1070
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,916
Cover me up! Keep me dry!
Cover me up! Keep me dry!

1071
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:33,004
Who's crazy now, huh?
Look at us all squishing!

1072
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,973
- It kind of stopped raining.
- Is that it?

1073
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:46,475
What did I tell you? It's fine. It's over.

1074
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,644
Hey, Ahab! This is it?

1075
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,814
Your God experiencing
a little water shortage?

1076
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:56,652
It would appear Evan Baxter
was right about the rain,

1077
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:00,239
with a slight miscalculation
as to the quantity.

1078
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:07,538
- Something's wrong.
- Honey, the clouds are moving away.

1079
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,625
No, no. No, this isn't right.

1080
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,837
Evan, even if it kept raining,
it's not like it could cause a flood in a day.

1081
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:20,176
But today is the day! It has to be.
This just doesn't make any sense!

1082
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:24,347
- Wait a second.
- What is it?

1083
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:28,100
Marty said that Long cut corners,
violated building codes.

1084
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,728
- What are you talking about?
- The lake, Long Lake.

1085
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:34,732
It's named after him.
It's the lake! It's the lake!

1086
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,246
Oh, no.

1087
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:55,795
Get on the ark! Everyone, on the ark now!

1088
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:57,713
I think we should get on the ark.

1089
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,633
I agree.
I think we should get on the ark also.

1090
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:04,345
I'm cold. I'm wet. I'm going home.

1091
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,437
Ladies first! Move!

1092
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:24,949
Oh, my God. This is happening.
This is really happening.

1093
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:29,370
Holy... Get everyone on the ark now!

1094
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:32,081
Get on the ark now! Let's go!
Get on the ark! Let's go!

1095
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:35,042
Go, go, go! Get on the ark!

1096
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:40,840
Go, go, go! On the ark! Go, go, go!

1097
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:43,384
All right, boys! Let's go! Let's go!

1098
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:47,012
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
Stay here with the kids.

1099
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,982
Come on, Rita!

1100
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:02,236
Everyone, up the ramp! Onto the deck!
Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

1101
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,157
- Dylan, get back inside! It's too dangerous.
- No, Dad. I told you, I'm with you.

1102
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:13,330
Careful, everyone.
In the ark! In the ark!

1103
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,499
Watch your step! Up the ramp, everybody!

1104
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:25,718
- Guys, help me with the door!
- Get the door! Get the door!

1105
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,429
Guys! Guys!

1106
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,172
Everybody hang on!

1107
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,769
You guys all right? You okay?

1108
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:00,938
There's been a flood at Prestige Crest

1109
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,190
and you're seeing live images
of New York Noah's ark

1110
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,485
caught in the storm surge
and heading towards Memorial Bridge!

1111
01:21:14,327 --> 01:21:16,871
We're going to crash!
Turn this thing around!

1112
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,790
We're not gonna make it!
Save us, Baxter!

1113
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:36,098
I command thee halt! Stop! Whoa!

1114
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:37,850
It's not working!

1115
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:41,395
How about a little help here?

1116
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,735
What do you mean there was water damage?
It rained for ten minutes.

1117
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:31,612
That is not possible.

1118
01:22:41,247 --> 01:22:43,123
- I love you guys.
- All right.

1119
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,458
- Seriously.
- Okay, I got it.

1120
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:45,668
- I love you.
- Thank you.

1121
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:07,731
All those in favor of the Public
Land Act, please signify by saying, "Aye. "

1122
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,115
Good God!

1123
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,860
I think we can walk from here.

1124
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:15,758
Hello, Congressman.
Mind if I park my boat here for a little while?

1125
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:18,927
- But how...
- The dam, Congressman.

1126
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:22,556
Your reservoir ruptured.
Prestige Crest, it's all gone.

1127
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,184
No. They said that couldn't happen.

1128
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:27,936
I never thought this...

1129
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:33,692
You. You did this to me.
You set me up, you crazy son of a...

1130
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,364
Wow. That is disgusting.

1131
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,241
If that comes out your front,

1132
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:44,745
I don't even want to know
what's coming out the back.

1133
01:24:47,999 --> 01:24:50,542
Don't look down, Congressman,
but the wolves are here,

1134
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:54,546
although I wouldn't worry so much
about these wolves as those.

1135
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,223
Gesundheit.

1136
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,947
As you can see behind me,
New York Noah's prediction came true.

1137
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,533
The vote of the Land Act Bill
has been suspended,

1138
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:25,452
pending investigation of Congressman Long
for profiteering...

1139
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,497
Of course now, the question is,
how will these animals be returned

1140
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,124
to their natural habitats?

1141
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:34,086
Something tells me, if God got them here,
he can probably get them home.

1142
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:37,214
The House will undoubtedly
reinstate Congressman Baxter

1143
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,049
when it reconvenes in the morning.

1144
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:42,970
Until then, there is a lot to be done here
on Capitol Hill.

1145
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:45,139
How's Buster doing?
Come on, Buster.

1146
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:47,599
No, come on. Come on!
Come on!

1147
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:49,476
These too heavy? It's all right?
No, it's fine.

1148
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,979
He can't keep up.
- I know, sweetie!

1149
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:55,274
All right.
What do you say we take a little break?

1150
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:56,984
We've only been walking
for, like, five minutes, Dad.

1151
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,279
Well, five on, five off.
Life is about balance, right?

1152
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:01,655
- How about some sandwiches?
- Okay.

1153
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,616
- Who wants sandwiches? Let's do it!
I get first dibs!

1154
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,994
Everyone but Buster
is going to get a sandwich.

1155
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:11,456
You do not get a sandwich! You're a dog
and you do not get a sandwich!

1156
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:14,751
Buster is part of the family now.
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

1157
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:16,670
Poor Buster!

1158
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:20,507
Honey, come here.
Sweetheart, be careful. Come here.

1159
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,509
- Hey, hon, save me one, okay?
- Okay.

1160
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,344
I'll be right back.

1161
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,729
- Hey.
- Hey.

1162
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,566
What are you doing here?

1163
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,277
Just hanging out with some old friends.

1164
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,655
You knew all along, didn't you?
You knew the dam was unstable.

1165
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,576
If it hadn't been for the ark,
my family, the neighbors...

1166
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:51,455
- I fought you every step of the way.
- Yes, but you did it.

1167
01:26:52,457 --> 01:26:57,002
So, you had nothing to do with the flood?
Like where the ark landed exactly?

1168
01:26:57,086 --> 01:27:00,547
I gave you a little shove at the end. Sue me.

1169
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:06,845
You did good, son. You changed the world.

1170
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,598
- No, no, I didn't.
- Well, let's see.

1171
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:13,769
Spending time with your family,
making them very happy.

1172
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:17,147
- Gave that dog a home.
- Right. So?

1173
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:19,524
So?

1174
01:27:19,609 --> 01:27:21,735
How do we change the world?

1175
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:26,740
One act of random kindness at a time.

1176
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:31,370
One act of random kindness.

1177
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:37,834
It's time.

1178
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:41,380
Do the dance.

1179
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,508
Care to join me?

1180
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:45,736
I now issue a new commandment,
"Thou shalt do the dance. "

1181
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:51,176
Stop it! This is stupid!

1182
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:54,471
That's awful dancing! You better stop!

1183
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,886
Ladies and gentlemen,
you don't have to go home.

1184
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:37,597
You just have to go. We are wrapped.

1185
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:40,392
We're wrapped.
We love you. Thank you.
