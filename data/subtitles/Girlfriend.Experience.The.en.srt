<i>Previously on
The Girlfriend Experience...</i>

2
00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:04,807
But I actually enjoy it.

3
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:07,852
I- I like meeting new
people, I like having sex,

4
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:10,189
And I only do it a few times a month.

5
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:11,648
This woman, Jacqueline, vets them for me

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,317
and takes care of the bookings.

7
00:00:13,317 --> 00:00:14,359
Why? Do you want to meet her?

8
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:15,569
I can introduce you, if you want.

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,321
You just have to want to do it.

10
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:18,571
I'm aware of that.

11
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:19,948
My big question is...

12
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:22,660
Why would I go with you
when I can do this myself?

13
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:26,371
The hours that you would spend
finding and then vetting clients

14
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:28,373
could be spent with
clients, making money.

15
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,500
I'm the infrastructure.

16
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,751
You don't work for me, you work with me.

17
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:33,920
And if you're unhappy,

18
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,673
you leave.

19
00:00:35,673 --> 00:00:37,383
There's no contract.

20
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:39,884
Don't worry. No one will
ever see your eyes.

21
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:42,720
Maybe his wife's coming to town,

22
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:45,390
or maybe he's just not
that into me anymore.

23
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:47,866
Either way, I have to pack
up my shit and leave.

24
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,332
Just stay with me until
you figure it out.

25
00:00:58,343 --> 00:01:00,363
Jacqueline won't call me back.

26
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:01,865
She won't tell me why.

28
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:30,769
Hi.

29
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:31,936
Hey, I don't have much time,

30
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:33,668
I have back-to-back
meetings all day so...

31
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,901
I hear it went very well with Michael.

32
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:40,403
I hope the whole widower
thing wasn't too intense.

33
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:41,947
It's fine. I know what the deal is.

34
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,573
Okay.

35
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,908
I'm worried about Avery.

36
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:48,328
Why won't you talk with her?

37
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,456
Because she is erratic and unreliable.

38
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,956
She needs some help.

39
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:52,957
She's staying with me.

40
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,502
She's not in school. She's broke.

41
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:57,003
How is that my problem?

42
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:59,923
She said you're taking
clients away from her.

43
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:01,424
'Course she did.

44
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:03,289
She loves to play the victim.

45
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:06,430
I have a business to run.

46
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,014
I have to judge pretty quickly

47
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:09,974
whether I should work with someone.

48
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:11,058
Because the difference between

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,728
being basically able to trust someone

50
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:15,855
and really being able to
trust someone is huge.

51
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:17,775
What are you getting at?

52
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:19,860
Christine, she booked
clients that I gave her

53
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,067
on the side without telling me.

54
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:24,747
Is that something you condone?

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,826
Look, if you want to help her, help her.

56
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,704
But if you're smart,
you'll keep your distance.

57
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:32,185
Don't let her seduce you.

58
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:35,463
Sorry, I really do have to go.

59
00:02:36,418 --> 00:02:37,662
Just...

60
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,195
Be careful with Avery.

61
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:41,819
Okay?

62
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:01,443
Hi.

63
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:02,527
Hi.

64
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,694
- How are you?
- How's it goin'? Good.

65
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:04,695
Good to see you.

66
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:05,967
It's good to see you.

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,037
Do you understand how
much I'm trusting you

68
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:13,997
by telling you this?

69
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:16,264
And why it took me a
while to call you back?

70
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:19,074
It's really interesting.

71
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,816
You think I'm fucked up.

72
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,550
Not at all. You seem very clear.

73
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:26,740
I am.

74
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,158
So how's business school?

75
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,933
Hi.

76
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:17,247
Hi.

77
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,064
Akers is out.

78
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:04,733
Really?

79
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,297
Barr confirmed it this morning.

80
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,865
- Hey, Neil.
- Come on in.

81
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,141
I hear you're leaving.

82
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:39,183
Who told you?

83
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,769
Carson?

84
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:43,355
Yeah, it was a tough decision,
but you know how it is, David.

85
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,856
I have my family to think of.

86
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:47,858
But who knows, maybe I'll hate
it and come crawling back

87
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,966
in a few weeks, begging
for another chance.

88
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,867
Oh, I'm giving you LSI and Polycom.

89
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:58,036
And XHP?

90
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,704
I'm taking them with me.

91
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,163
I don't know what else to say.

92
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:02,833
They came to me, David.

93
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:05,752
Fair game.

94
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:08,922
How long have you known you
were leaving Kirkland?

95
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:10,860
Your ten o'clock with Novak.

96
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:16,762
Hey, XHP are yours.

97
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,848
If they're unhappy with the work I did,

98
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,307
not much I can do about it now.

99
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:23,060
I just wanted you to know,
in case you need any help...

100
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:24,146
transitioning.

101
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,336
Oh, I appreciate you offering.

102
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:30,235
You and Carla still coming on the 14th?

103
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,360
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

104
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:32,737
It's Carla's favorite.

105
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:33,697
Great.

106
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,093
We'll have a few in your honor.

107
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,084
Akers is a snake.

108
00:06:46,084 --> 00:06:47,127
I don't give a shit.

109
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:49,086
He won. You got lazy and lost XHP.

110
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,088
Understand?

111
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:51,338
I completely understand.

112
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,425
I have no fucking idea
how to absorb this loss.

113
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,884
They accounted for 5% of our billing.

114
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:55,720
I understand.

115
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,430
Please stop saying that.

116
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,430
Let me fix this.

117
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:00,682
How?

118
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:01,891
Trust me.

119
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:03,142
I can get them back.

120
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,769
Wright is being unreasonable.

121
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:06,771
These kinds of cases, they take time.

122
00:07:06,773 --> 00:07:08,899
He knew there were gonna be mistrials.

123
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,192
I can turn him around.

124
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:12,276
I got this.

125
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:13,819
I'd really like to think I was right

126
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,884
considering you for Managing Partner.

127
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:25,790
Christine...

128
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,542
Call accounting,

129
00:07:27,543 --> 00:07:29,752
and get a record of all the hours
we billed for XHP last quarter.

130
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:31,129
Got it.

131
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,860
Get it for the entire year.

132
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:41,973
Fuck!

133
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,423
Hi.

134
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,076
Have you seen Jacqueline lately?

135
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:02,786
We had coffee last week.

136
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,079
Did she talk about me?

137
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,079
No.

138
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:07,331
Really?

139
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,209
Are you sure my name didn't come up?

140
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,709
Not even once?

141
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:12,504
Yes. You didn't come up.

142
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:14,047
'Cause she's still not
returning my phone calls.

143
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:15,757
And I know she got to Garrett.

144
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,466
I know she did. There's no other way.

145
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,281
He was obsessed with me.

146
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,848
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:23,889
Do you want some?

148
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,120
No.

149
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,855
I dropped out.

150
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:30,855
Officially.

151
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:31,856
You withdrew?

152
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:33,107
Yeah.

153
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:36,193
I hate it. I wanna do something else.

154
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:38,446
How's your coveted internship going?

155
00:08:38,447 --> 00:08:40,240
What are you gonna do?

156
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,200
Blackmail her.

157
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,827
Fuck up her life.

158
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:47,518
I'm so glad not to be in
fucking law school anymore.

159
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,918
Who knows, maybe I'll go on vacation.

160
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:53,399
I love vacations.

161
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,360
Kevin?

162
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Chelsea?

163
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:20,134
- Hi.
- Hi.

164
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:24,993
Jacqueline wasn't kidding.

165
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:26,577
You're stunning.

166
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:28,370
Thanks.

167
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:30,831
So, did she get the transfer?

168
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,250
I assume so.

169
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,688
Yeah, thanks.

170
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:38,923
So you're here 'till Friday?

171
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:39,966
Yeah...

172
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:41,426
Yeah.

173
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,928
And do you come to town often or...?

174
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:45,596
No, not very often.

175
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:49,225
Ah, about once every
other month or so...

176
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:52,081
Although that could change.

177
00:09:53,628 --> 00:09:55,211
Why is that?

178
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,652
- Because of you.
- Whoa...

179
00:09:58,653 --> 00:10:00,611
Kevin, slow down.

180
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:03,365
For your own sake.

181
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,366
I can tell already.

182
00:10:05,368 --> 00:10:08,119
Sorry.

183
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,121
I guess I'm just a little nervous.

184
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:14,208
It's been a while for me and...

185
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,168
I'm married...

186
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:18,296
And you're just...

187
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:20,548
spectacular.

188
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,571
I'm glad you think so.

189
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,409
We have time. There's no need to rush.

190
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:42,883
Relax.

191
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,599
Touch me.

192
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,188
<i>Hello?</i>

193
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,190
Avery?

194
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,232
<i>She cleaned out my accounts.</i>

195
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:04,235
<i>She took all my money.</i>

196
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:05,736
What? Who?

197
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:08,197
<i>Jacqueline.</i>

198
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,240
What are you talking about?

199
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,368
She had access to your bank accounts?

200
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:12,369
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

201
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,245
<i>It was stupid of me.</i>

202
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:16,663
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

203
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,360
Avery?

204
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,280
Avery?

205
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:13,721
Hi! What a surprise.

206
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,639
Cleaned out her accounts?

207
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,110
You know what? You know,
now's not a good time.

208
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:17,975
You fucking used Avery!

209
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,561
Avery used us both.

210
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,793
You're a fucking leech!

211
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,325
Fuck!

212
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:38,245
Got a minute?

213
00:13:38,246 --> 00:13:39,518
Close the door.

214
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,751
What were you gonna do?

215
00:13:44,753 --> 00:13:46,796
Make a deal. Reduce our rates.

216
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:48,338
I'm not convinced that'll be enough.

217
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,341
Everyone's got their price tag.

218
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:52,969
Yeah, that much I know.

219
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,013
You look tired.

220
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:58,600
You have a way of avoiding the point.

221
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,371
I don't wanna bring you into this.

222
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:05,335
Office, can you hold please?

223
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,326
You're late.

224
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:17,409
I know, I-

225
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,913
I had a doctor's appointment. Sorry.

226
00:14:19,913 --> 00:14:22,749
Erase "sorry" from your vocabulary.

227
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,395
Just be on time.

228
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,460
Hey...

229
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,634
What is it?

230
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,450
Um...

231
00:14:57,451 --> 00:15:00,410
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

232
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:01,557
Okay.

233
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:08,919
I'm thinking of leaving Jacqueline...

234
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,964
Breaking out on my own.

235
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:12,590
Ahhh...

236
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,841
Well, she called me.

237
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,802
I was wondering about that.

238
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,888
I don't want to put you
in the middle of this.

239
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,889
And you know I love
spending time with you,

240
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,934
and I'd hate to do anything
to jeopardize that.

241
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,352
I just...

242
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:28,565
hope you'll still consider seeing me.

243
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:31,129
And if you're not comfortable
with that, I can wait.

244
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:36,905
Come here.

245
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:40,868
Come on.

246
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:44,621
Now how long have we
been seeing each other?

247
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:47,542
- Nearly two months.
- Yeah, that's right.

248
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:50,128
And I'm here with you.

249
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,692
You're the one I want to
be with, not Jacqueline.

250
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:56,196
Oh, come here.

251
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:02,849
Just let me know how
you want to handle it.

252
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:04,975
It's all good.

253
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:06,163
Thank you.

254
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:04,201
Susan, you didn't happen to see
who put this on my desk, did you?

255
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:05,411
What is it?

256
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:08,038
Just a copy of an XHP affidavit.

257
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,644
I'll take care of it.

258
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:19,174
Did you see who dropped this off for me?

259
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:21,219
- No.
- Was it a messenger?

260
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,180
Check the log.

261
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:26,932
Kirkland and Allen.

262
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,976
<i>Sure, and how can I direct your call?</i>

263
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:30,603
<i>Okay, please hold.</i>

264
00:17:31,689 --> 00:17:33,167
<i>Kirkland and Allen.</i>

265
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,681
It's already been scanned.

266
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,082
How's your dad?

267
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,313
Oh, you know, it is what it is.

268
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,797
I tried that sushi place you
showed me on North Broadway.

269
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:40,923
Mmm.

270
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:42,174
There's Wright.

271
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:45,595
The fact that he's here
is 50% of our battle.

272
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:46,971
Glad you could make it.

273
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:49,015
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

274
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:50,406
What are you drinking?

275
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:51,738
Scotch.

276
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,885
Same as me.

277
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,998
I'm sure you know why we asked you here.

278
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,750
We would very much like to
continue our relationship

279
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,961
with both yourself and XHP.

280
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:08,131
Well, can we talk results?

281
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:09,965
'Cause we're in legal
limbo and I just can't...

282
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:11,509
I love to talk results.

283
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:14,971
I can't justify what you
call "a series of mistrials"

284
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,597
with a deal I'm pretty
sure I could pull off

285
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:17,932
with my eyes closed.

286
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:19,601
I understand.

287
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:21,978
But these cases take time, Emery.

288
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:24,105
Mistrials are a hazard of our trade.

289
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,940
It may happen 10 or 15 more times

290
00:19:25,941 --> 00:19:27,442
before we get the verdict we want.

291
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:30,153
I know it feels like you're
being put through the wringer.

292
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:33,114
I am being put through
the fucking wringer!

293
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,032
I can't believe I'm having
to explain this to you,

294
00:19:35,034 --> 00:19:36,826
the lawyers we pay to solve this!

295
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:40,997
XHP is now projecting negative
$300 million for this year.

296
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,958
Look, if you're gonna do a sales
pitch, tell me how XHP wins.

297
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,919
It's clear you guys get paid
whether we profit or not.

298
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,503
What is Akers offering you?

299
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:49,756
You know I can't discuss that.

300
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,048
Of course.

301
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:52,674
What if we could commit
to three months for free,

302
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,676
to get you back on our team?

303
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,136
I'd have to send it upstairs.

304
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:58,181
Six months.

305
00:19:58,182 --> 00:19:59,723
Work with us.

306
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:02,184
Neil Akers is an excellent litigator,

307
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:04,645
but moving your business to a new firm

308
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:07,105
will cause a whole new
series of setbacks.

309
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,837
How much will it cost you
to get them up to speed?

310
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:33,883
Real sweet couple.

311
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:35,718
Can't thank them enough.

312
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:37,845
They own a chain of liquor stores

313
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:40,890
and keep coming back to me to broker.

314
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,267
And now with this hotel
they want to buy,

315
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:45,560
it would really put me...

316
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,605
on the next level.

317
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:49,231
And it would mean

318
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:51,192
that you and I...

319
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:52,463
What would it mean?

320
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm just so happy to see you!

321
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,201
I'm happy to see you, too.

322
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:03,037
There are things I want to tell you.

323
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:04,622
I- I shouldn't...

324
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:05,894
You can tell me.

325
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:11,170
I'm not crazy.

326
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,756
I know I don't know you well,

327
00:21:13,757 --> 00:21:17,300
but I feel like I do.

328
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:19,095
Your eyes...

329
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:20,951
are so honest.

330
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:28,165
I know-I-I know that sounded
like a-like a line but...

331
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,025
I can't get you out of my head.

332
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:36,237
And I don't want to.

333
00:21:36,238 --> 00:21:37,884
That's sweet.

334
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:42,993
You don't have to say that.

335
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,891
I know I don't have to say that.

336
00:21:47,186 --> 00:21:50,917
So many things I wanna tell you.

337
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:52,898
Just tell me.

338
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:19,989
Hey Abby, I'm late for class.
Can I call you back?

339
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,865
<i>Yeah, I just wanted to let
you know I'm coming to town.</i>

340
00:22:21,866 --> 00:22:22,866
When?

341
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:23,867
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

342
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:25,411
Tomorrow? What time?

343
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:26,496
<i>I'm not sure yet,</i>

344
00:22:26,497 --> 00:22:27,704
<i>I'll probably get in around three.</i>

345
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:29,207
Okay, okay...

346
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,791
okay, I love you, bye.

347
00:22:39,364 --> 00:22:40,947
Shit!

348
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,939
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

349
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,066
Is there any way I can make up the test?

350
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,777
I'm afraid not.

351
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,382
You have ten minutes.

352
00:23:27,913 --> 00:23:29,412
What are you talking about?

353
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:33,311
Now I'm paying you to get
me proprietary information.

354
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,064
What part of that isn't fucking clear?

355
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:38,442
Get me some useful information.

356
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:41,069
Hi.

357
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,238
You alright?

358
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:43,239
Yeah...

359
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,824
I got screwed.

360
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:46,784
I need to shake it off.

361
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:48,326
Wanna get drunk?

362
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,829
Sure.

363
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,082
He got fed the wrong information.

364
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,416
His source fucked him.

365
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:55,876
I told him not to bite.

366
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,296
Twenty million gone
'cause he got sloppy.

367
00:23:58,297 --> 00:24:00,423
How long have you been partners?

368
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:03,342
Too fucking long!

369
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,343
Promise...

370
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,429
I won't talk about it anymore.

371
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,096
I like hearing you talk about it.

372
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:10,266
It's good for you to talk about it.

373
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:11,913
I like talking to you about it.

374
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,938
I like you, Chelsea.

375
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:18,607
I like you, too, Ryan.

376
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:22,278
Where're you really from?

377
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:23,988
Just outside of Philly.

378
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:27,115
Both my parents are teachers.

379
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:29,535
My mom teaches 5th grade English,

380
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:32,454
and my dad teaches math in high school.

381
00:24:32,455 --> 00:24:33,977
What do you like to do?

382
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:37,835
Be alone.

383
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:41,047
You want to get married?

384
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:44,090
I don't believe in marriage.

385
00:24:44,092 --> 00:24:45,384
Do you want kids?

386
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,384
No...

387
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,365
Hands down, no.

388
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:52,933
What do you want?

389
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:55,353
I'm studying law.

390
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:56,645
I believe that.

391
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,230
I won't ask what kind.

392
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,544
Patent.

393
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:03,318
Are your siblings as smart as you?

394
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,195
No.

395
00:25:05,196 --> 00:25:07,323
My brother's great, though.

396
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:08,531
Just the two of you?

397
00:25:08,532 --> 00:25:12,327
Yep, just one brother.

398
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,579
You're so smart...

399
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,269
and I'm so selfish.

400
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:38,980
I'm leaving Jacqueline.

401
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,710
Just tell me where to send the money.

402
00:25:44,465 --> 00:25:46,298
Take off your clothes.

403
00:25:55,734 --> 00:26:01,734
