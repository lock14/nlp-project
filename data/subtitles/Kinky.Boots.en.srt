{1}{1}25.000
{2526}{2550}Come on.
{2899}{2952}Come on, you stupid boy.
{3375}{3439}OK now, Charlie.
{3441}{3531}I'm going to show you the most|beautiful thing in the world.
{3534}{3599}- Do you know what it is?|- A shoe.
{3601}{3699}A lot of people would say|it'd be an oak tree in spring.
{3701}{3737}It's a shoe.
{3739}{3825}Lot of people would say|it'd be a field of flowers.
{3828}{3873}Do you know what I think it is?
{3875}{3901}A shoe.
{3904}{3946}I think it's a shoe.
{4754}{4867}Every machine. You'll learn how|to work every machine, Charlie.
{4869}{4943}And by the time you're old enough,|and married probably,
{4945}{5022}taking over the factory from me,|believe me,
{5024}{5145}first thing you'll notice|about a person is their shoes.
{5193}{5219}Come on.
{6027}{6092}You know, it's funny.|It's always struck me
{6094}{6225}that in terms of love, strength|and attention to detail,
{6227}{6295}marriage is pretty much like...
{6297}{6333}A pair of shoes.
{6383}{6465}And today again, I'm not wrong...
{6468}{6585}They take you to places,|perhaps, you weren't expecting.
{6631}{6690}My son. Off to London.
{6693}{6816}His fiancée been transferred|to an even bigger estate agents.
{6819}{6876}Young Charlie,|what have you decided
{6879}{6928}to try your hand at down there?
{6967}{6993}Marketing.
{7040}{7066}Marketing.
{7151}{7202}To my future daughter-in-law.
{7274}{7319}And to my wonderful son.
{7432}{7495}- Charlie.|- Charlie.
{7783}{7821}Ah, Mr Price.
{7823}{7870}Do let me show you around.
{7872}{7970}This is the new layout designed|with the young couple in mind.
{7972}{8016}As you see,|one good size bedroom,
{8018}{8073}with en-suite shower room.
{8076}{8178}And through here,|a fully-furnished lounge.
{8180}{8289}Oh, and best of all, Mr Price,|best of all...
{8372}{8413}The view.
{8486}{8525}It's not Northampton.
{8527}{8555}It's not Northampton.
{8558}{8584}No.
{8586}{8614}Not Northampton
{8617}{8656}Not Northampton
{8658}{8721}We're not in Northampton anymore
{8803}{8897}- We're going where...|- Hello?
{8899}{8960}...sky is blue
{8962}{9044}Coœ the best thing|about London is
{9046}{9118}No more bloody shoe...
{9120}{9192}Yeah, this is his son.
{11765}{11824}Mr Price.
{11827}{11915}He'd have been proud of you|coming back, Mr Price.
{11917}{11945}Charlie.
{11948}{12065}Price factory has to have a Mr Price,|Mr Price.
{12140}{12166}George...
{12750}{12788}Bugger.
{13177}{13226}Dad always used to say that...
{13307}{13385}And in a sense...
{13483}{13532}He ain't pressed the button.
{13557}{13645}- My heart is...|- Press the red button.
{13866}{13911}That's a good start.
{13961}{14010}Right.
{14251}{14349}I'm not my dad. OK.|You shouldn't expect that.
{14351}{14429}But I've spent my life with|each one of you at some point,
{14431}{14523}training on these machines.
{14568}{14637}- I was bloody useless.|- Too right.
{14639}{14684}Thanks, Don.
{14735}{14799}Listen. Dad believed
{14801}{14916}there would always be a place|for craftsmanship.
{14919}{15013}And whether you realise it or not,|that is what you all are.
{15015}{15070}Craftsmen.
{15115}{15164}So let's make shoes.
{15226}{15277}Let's make shoes?
{15465}{15543}Don't worry, love.|Don't get it on your jacket.
{15545}{15606}I'll get some roll.
{16518}{16624}Pat, what order is the company|working on at the moment?
{16626}{16735}It's a big one, love.|Chambers Wholesale. Why?
{17004}{17068}What the hell was he playing at?
{17070}{17146}I mean, why didn't he...
{17148}{17199}Why did he carry on making 'em?
{17201}{17289}This happened before. 1992.
{17291}{17336}Customer went into receivership
{17339}{17421}and your dad got stuck|with 600 Oxfords.
{17423}{17449}And?
{17451}{17486}Bill Sampson in London
{17488}{17525}took 'em at cost.
{17662}{17738}Right. Pat, I'm going to London.
{18027}{18068}I just happen to find myself
{18070}{18144}with 1,200 pairs of brogues,|and I know, a few years back,
{18146}{18214}your dad took some at cost|off my dad and I thought...
{18216}{18304}That was a few years back, Charlie.|Things have changed a bit.
{18329}{18386}But look, I'll tell you what.
{18388}{18460}I'll take 200 pairs off your hands.|For old time's sake.
{18463}{18520}Hey, and this hurts.
{18522}{18602}Being a Forest fan giving|charity to a Northampton...
{18604}{18725}I mean, when I say charity|I'm not... you know.
{18765}{18847}Imported from Slovakia.|Wanna know how much?
{18920}{19008}Harry. A Price's shoe|will last a man a lifetime.
{19011}{19093}Poor sod that buys these will be back|in ten months for new ones.
{19095}{19179}I know. And isn't that great?
{19390}{19439}Spare some change, guv?
{19488}{19597}Here. This is a Price's shoe.
{19599}{19724}And it'll last a man a lifetime.
{19727}{19774}You got it in a size ten?
{19824}{19893}- Slow yourself down a bit.|- Wanna come to a party?
{19895}{19944}All right, gorgeous?
{20166}{20221}Come here.
{20247}{20296}Covering something, princess?
{20362}{20411}Where do you think you're going?
{20414}{20490}Don't worry, I'm not gonna harm you.|Just want a chat.
{20493}{20517}All right, lads?
{20740}{20832}I think you should just leave|her alone now, don't you think?
{20834}{20897}- Yeah? Come on then.|- Don't you?
{22564}{22671}Very sweet.|You riding to my rescue.
{22673}{22755}Very Prince Charming.
{22758}{22807}Pass me my boobs, will ya?
{22888}{22947}Here.
{22949}{23010}Didn't look like you|needed much rescuing.
{23013}{23120}Well, a girl has to know|how to look after herself these days.
{23122}{23198}There are some|very funny people out there.
{23262}{23334}How's that wound?|Let's have a look.
{23387}{23432}Don't flatter yourself.
{23460}{23540}Vodka. Helps you forget pain.
{23573}{23645}Well, it does me.
{23922}{24052}God. Clean off, again.|Like most things in life,
{24054}{24101}it cannot stand|the weight of a man.
{24157}{24226}Here we go. Oh. God love us.
{24228}{24275}Hold on.
{24524}{24566}Thank you again, Mr...
{24568}{24656}Sorry to be presumptive.|Are you a Mr?
{24659}{24718}I'm a Charlie. From Northampton.
{24720}{24773}Well, I rather thought you might be.
{25691}{25767}...my unspoiled gender
{25770}{25834}Prim and proper
{25836}{25926}The girl who's never been cased
{25929}{26054}I'm tired of being pure and not chased
{26056}{26192}Like something that|seeks its level
{26194}{26220}I wanna go to the devil
{26223}{26264}I wanna be evil
{26267}{26324}I wanna spit tacks
{26327}{26366}I wanna be evil
{26368}{26415}And cheat at jacks
{26418}{26473}I wanna be wicked
{26475}{26514}I wanna tell lies
{26517}{26634}I wanna be mean|and throw mud pies
{26636}{26691}I want to wake up|in the morning
{26694}{26743}With that dark brown taste
{26745}{26844}I wanna see some dissipation|in my face
{26846}{26895}I wanna be evil
{26897}{26948}I wanna be mad
{26950}{26991}But more than that
{26993}{27058}I wanna be bad
{27060}{27152}I wanna be evil|and trump an ace
{27154}{27263}Just to see my partner's face
{27265}{27322}I wanna be nasty
{27324}{27361}I wanna be cruel
{27363}{27412}I wanna be daring
{27415}{27462}I wanna shoot pool
{27465}{27535}And in the theatre
{27537}{27588}I want to change my seat
{27591}{27721}Just so I can step on|everybody's feet
{28143}{28184}- Oh, no.|- Trish.
{28186}{28219}Thing is...
{28221}{28278}No, love, please. Please.
{28280}{28325}They've just started school.
{28328}{28393}They just started school|this month, Charlie.
{28395}{28481}This is their uniforms, love.|This is their dinners.
{28484}{28551}We lost the contract|with Chambers, Trish.
{28553}{28619}Thing is, we lost the|contract with Chambers...
{28621}{28674}Actually, don't.
{28677}{28745}This is like apologies|for your train running late.
{28747}{28806}- It means nothing...|- It's not like that...
{28808}{28863}...so I'd rather not hear it.
{28901}{28936}I do mean it.
{29283}{29352}Bernie Taylor to the office.
{29354}{29380}Please.
{29382}{29452}This is not what I want, Bernie.
{29454}{29589}I don't want to be sitting here|doing this, but you know...
{29591}{29716}Nine out of ten shoe factories|have shut down...
{29718}{29767}What can I do?
{29988}{30056}I am sorry it's come to this, Anthony.
{30058}{30082}Daphne.
{30085}{30111}Janice.
{30113}{30152}- Derek?|- Eric.
{30154}{30184}Yes, Eric.
{30330}{30385}What can I do?
{30387}{30425}Change the product.
{30427}{30488}- Sorry?|- Like Liptons.
{30491}{30540}Start making equestrian boots.
{30543}{30654}Browns. They're making...|Whatever, climbing boots.
{30656}{30746}All them other sods, they went out|looking for their niche markets.
{30749}{30856}They just didn't sit back|in their offices going, "What can I do?"
{30969}{30995}Sorry.
{31074}{31170}I was just really, really|looking forward to a Chinese tonight.
{31219}{31264}Now I'm not sure if I can afford it.
{31697}{31806}In a sense it was lucky, they hadn't|got round to advertising your job.
{31825}{31878}Yeah, lucky.
{31880}{31929}Listen, Nic.
{31984}{32053}That's the kind of shoe, isn't it?|Don't you think?
{32055}{32132}- What?|- The wedding. At the altar.
{32134}{32195}Is that the kind of thing|you were thinking of?
{32197}{32238}On my foot.
{32241}{32325}Well, it needs to be a Jimmy Choo,|doesn't it? To work.
{32328}{32385}We might have to think|about the wedding.
{32428}{32487}Not the wedding, wedding, but...
{32489}{32641}It doesn't have to be all live band|and shoes at the altar, does it?
{32659}{32741}I mean, at the end of the day|it's about the two of us, isn't it?
{32813}{32914}I've made 15 people redundant today.
{34182}{34249}Lauren.
{34251}{34315}Lauren, you haven't heard|what I was gonna say.
{34317}{34380}Well, does it involve the words,|"job back"?
{34399}{34435}Potentially.
{34589}{34646}OK, brace yourself.
{34649}{34812}Ladies, gentlemen and those|who are yet to make up your mind.
{34947}{35041}Whatever Lola wants
{35043}{35104}Lola gets
{35107}{35146}And little man
{35149}{35222}Little Lola wants you
{35267}{35363}Make up your mind to have
{35365}{35432}No regrets
{35434}{35474}Recline yourself
{35476}{35514}Resign yourself
{35516}{35548}You're through
{35591}{35671}I always gain
{35674}{35754}What I aim for
{35756}{35813}And your heart and soul
{35815}{35914}Is what I came for
{35916}{36010}Whatever Lola wants
{36012}{36067}Lola gets
{36070}{36117}Take off your coat
{36119}{36196}Don't you know you can't win
{36245}{36320}You're no exception to the rule
{36322}{36406}I'm irresistible you fool
{36408}{36463}Give in
{36648}{36683}Lola.
{37013}{37097}All me, sweetheart.|I design everything in that club.
{37099}{37251}It's my costumes, my lighting,|my dancers, my show, love.
{37254}{37303}I mean, it's me.
{37305}{37373}Bit of a dark horse, your boyfriend.
{37375}{37411}He's my boss.
{37413}{37484}Well, he was my boss.|I got laid off.
{37486}{37574}But now he seems to think|I'm his business analyst or...
{37577}{37628}Look, you'll have to excuse Charlie.
{37630}{37698}We don't have many transvestites|in Northampton.
{37700}{37759}I'm not merely a transvestite,|sweetheart.
{37761}{37827}I'm also a drag queen.|It's a simple equation.
{37829}{37911}A drag queen puts on a frock,|looks like Kylie.
{37913}{37993}A transvestite puts on a frock,|looks like...
{37996}{38055}Boris Yeltsin in lipstick.|There, I said it.
{38078}{38175}Ta. Whatever. Don't kid yourself.
{38177}{38263}You're never more than ten feet away|from a transvestite.
{38301}{38367}You made her redundant?|You miserable sod.
{38414}{38467}Things aren't very good|in men's shoes.
{38469}{38518}Well, I'm not, certainly.
{38520}{38584}Yes. Precisely.
{38586}{38635}How much do you weigh?
{38690}{38745}The right amount.|How much do you drink?
{38748}{38913}I mean... They're women's boots,|are they, that you buy?
{38915}{39009}You have to buy women's boots|because you...
{39043}{39133}You see, the distribution of pressure|on a conventional female heel
{39135}{39203}cannot be expected|to support a man's weight.
{39205}{39324}And if trans... you know, whatevers,
{39326}{39445}drag queens are everywhere,|like you said, then, not in a...
{39486}{39555}Living Dead kind of way but...
{39584}{39719}Then, do you think there is|a niche market for proper, good,
{39721}{39794}decent, built-to-last boots
{39796}{39900}for women... that are men?
{39974}{40037}All this way for my advice.|I feel like Oprah.
{40039}{40119}I'd like to measure you for it,|go home, make a pair.
{40887}{40959}Who gets to keep the boots?
{40961}{41080}A little warning.|The answer is, "You do, Lola."
{41082}{41148}You do, Lola.
{41150}{41234}Where do I come to pick it up?|What, Prices of Northampton, is it?
{41237}{41296}Yeah, but I'll come to you.
{41299}{41397}Oh, no. As they say, a good|pair of boots is worth walking for.
{41399}{41491}No, you see,|I come here all the time, and so...
{41515}{41568}I'll come to you.
{41571}{41601}Right.
{41684}{41735}Look behind you.
{41738}{41775}What? What is it?
{41777}{41828}It's your niche market, Charlie.
{41948}{41986}Big niche.
{42690}{42753}Ladies, gentlemen
{42755}{42830}and those of you|who are yet to make up your mind,
{42832}{42906}our very own Lola.
{43118}{43177}He walked into my life
{43228}{43300}And now he's taking over
{43353}{43400}And it's beautiful
{43446}{43488}Yes it's beautiful
{43533}{43608}I've gone with better looking guys
{43634}{43732}He's gone with prettier looking girls
{43758}{43817}But now we're beautiful
{43860}{43917}I think we're beautiful
{43961}{44089}I don't need love affairs anymore
{44171}{44302}I don't need love affairs anymore
{44362}{44403}Can't you see
{44405}{44462}It's the chemistry
{44464}{44597}You really must agree|together we are beautiful
{44636}{44703}We are beautiful...
{45544}{45576}Well?
{45621}{45651}Cool.
{45749}{45833}I was thinking, we should...
{45835}{45899}If you haven't got anything else on
{45901}{45974}then maybe you could come back to...
{46022}{46079}To your house?
{46115}{46164}The factory.
{46241}{46329}I'm gonna need someone on|the web to research markets and...
{46331}{46409}If Pat got on those websites|she'd have a heart attack.
{46411}{46454}Yeah.
{46456}{46522}Besides, you started it,|being in that strop.
{46524}{46630}Oh, well.|I mean, I just had the strop, Charlie.
{46632}{46687}You saw the idea.
{46689}{46802}And that is why some of us end up|with our names above the factories
{46804}{46869}and others just on|the clocking-in cards.
{46913}{46937}Right.
{46984}{47064}Well, as someone|with their name on a factory,
{47067}{47153}can I invite you to have your name|on one of my clocking-in cards?
{47362}{47438}They say, calm down,|they say whatever life throws at you,
{47441}{47488}whatever emotions you feel,
{47491}{47555}somebody somewhere|has written a song about it.
{47557}{47616}Now, I hope that'll be true.
{47618}{47665}Until somebody writes a song called
{47668}{47735}No One Stays Young Forever And|One Day I Hope You Get Dumped
{47737}{47798}For A Younger Model,|You Whiny Little Welsh Bastard,
{47800}{47855}I'm just gonna have|to sing your memory.
{47858}{47897}Show us your tits.
{47960}{48026}Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen,|there they are.
{48028}{48073}Give 'em a round of applause.
{48166}{48223}Are they as wrinkly|as your arms, love?
{48267}{48338}- Is there a man in there?|- Good one.
{48340}{48461}I have to tell you, sweetheart,|my breasts are as smooth and beautiful
{48463}{48508}as the day that I bought them.
{48990}{49016}Bastard.
{50423}{50472}Hey.
{50494}{50539}Forget it, Don. Out of your league.
{50542}{50593}Nah. You seem to forget,
{50596}{50670}women get turned on|by the sight of the working man.
{50907}{50935}Morning, Charlie.
{50937}{50963}Lola.
{51043}{51067}Come in.
{51104}{51153}Sorry it's a bit messy. We...
{51180}{51237}I thought we agreed|that I'd come to London.
{51240}{51289}I warn you, Charlie from Northampton,
{51292}{51390}I have a terrible habit of doing|the opposite of what people want.
{51392}{51453}Some might say|that attempts of certain people
{51456}{51548}to make a man out of me as a child|is the reason that I now wear a frock.
{51551}{51643}If I get the feeling somebody|didn't want me to come to Northampton...
{51646}{51691}- No.|- Also, I can tell
{51694}{51796}from years of experience when I'm|being smuggled in through a rear door.
{51798}{51851}- That's the rough-stuff room.|- Is it?
{51853}{51929}It's where we dump|all the offcuts and misshapes.
{51931}{51988}There you go.|I wondered why I was drawn to it.
{51991}{52021}- Pardon?|- Nothing.
{52024}{52069}I'll raise.
{52369}{52418}That's George.
{52421}{52513}Listen, Mel, all I say is,|when it comes to attracting women
{52515}{52564}some men don't have to speak.
{52691}{52740}This is cosy.
{53112}{53167}All right.
{53170}{53219}Here we are.
{53471}{53495}Well?
{53728}{53777}What do you think?
{54001}{54027}Burgundy.
{54092}{54197}Please, God, tell me|I've not inspired something burgundy.
{54278}{54345}Red.
{54383}{54442}Red.
{54468}{54504}Red.
{54547}{54602}Red. Charlie boy.
{54605}{54656}Rule one. Red...
{54658}{54692}...is the colour of sex.
{54694}{54774}Burgundy is the colour|of hot water bottles.
{54776}{54858}Red is the colour|of sex and fear and danger
{54861}{54974}and signs that say, "Do Not Enter."
{54977}{55043}All of my favourite things in life.
{55045}{55133}- Who's that?|- He's got your new girlfriend in there.
{55135}{55194}- But they're comfy.|- Comfy?
{55221}{55274}Sex shouldn't be comfy.
{55276}{55350}Thank God.|I thought it was just me.
{55353}{55456}I don't know what you're used to makin',|but now you're making sex.
{55459}{55551}Two-and-a-half feet|of irresistible tubular sex.
{55554}{55611}I mean, that heel. For God's sake.
{55614}{55669}It won't break.|That's what you wanted.
{55671}{55736}Not if it means looking like|a Ukrainian peasant.
{55738}{55797}It's better than flouncing around|like a...
{55799}{55885}You wanna show your niche market|a little more respect, Charlie.
{55887}{55928}- Let's ask your girls.|- No.
{55931}{55999}Girls. Would you wear|something like this to go out?
{56001}{56050}No.
{56053}{56108}You'd look all right in 'em, sweetheart.
{56188}{56225}You've pulled.
{56349}{56429}Oh, yeah.
{56467}{56502}Ladies.
{56905}{56948}Well, I'm very flattered.
{56951}{57050}But frankly,|if you can't get women to wear 'em,
{57052}{57107}you'll never get blokes like me|to wear 'em.
{57479}{57534}Do we still have a workforce?
{57536}{57572}Don'll come around.
{57574}{57621}Once he's stopped...
{57663}{57712}...walking up and down, swearing.
{57714}{57794}- Well, that's his problem.|- No, it's our problem, Lola.
{57797}{57889}This is Northampton.|You have no idea what it's like, OK?
{57892}{57953}- It's not Soho.|- Amen.
{58014}{58084}Look to the heel, young man.
{58181}{58259}The sex is in the heel.
{58521}{58586}What's that supposed to mean?
{58588}{58643}Sex is in the heel.
{58646}{58753}Stilettos require constant balance|from the upper leg
{58755}{58818}causing the muscles|of the backside to tense
{58820}{58891}and appear pert and ready for mating.
{58963}{59055}It's physically impossible.|I mean, am I missing something?
{59057}{59184}To make a stiletto, something that thin,|bear the weight of a man is just...
{59186}{59247}Steel shank.
{59250}{59283}What?
{59285}{59367}A steel shank, cut thinly,
{59369}{59457}then moulded in a continuous section,
{59460}{59519}from toe to heel without pinning.
{59521}{59582}Not even Don would crush that.
{59689}{59715}Lola.
{59771}{59826}Lola, we might be able to do it.
{59829}{59890}Steel shanks without underpinning.
{59893}{59946}We might be able|to make those boots.
{59948}{60007}If you could just...|If you're willing to...
{60009}{60077}I think Don would have|something to say about that.
{60079}{60165}I gave up the provinces years ago,|and I've just been reminded why.
{60168}{60219}Lola doesn't do North.
{60221}{60282}- Northampton's the Midlands.|- No, Charlie.
{60284}{60337}Tottenham Court Road is the Midlands.
{60339}{60408}If you'll excuse me,|I have a show tonight.
{60410}{60506}Look, I'm stood here, trying|to save a factory of four generations.
{60508}{60565}Of my father,|and his father's father...
{60567}{60655}- Tell me when it applies to me.|- And how it applies to you.
{60658}{60721}I'm about to take|an almighty fucking gamble.
{60723}{60778}And in one afternoon, in one drawing,
{60781}{60840}you've said more about|these boots than...
{60843}{60873}I mean, I just...
{60876}{60991}Five weeks, Lola. That's it. I mean,|if I don't have a new collection ready
{60993}{61091}for the Milan shoe fair in five weeks,|I've blown it. I'll have to sell up.
{61161}{61234}All right, I'll tell you what.|Don't hang around.
{61236}{61303}It's never gonna apply to you.
{61338}{61468}What you don't realise, Lola,|is this is not my world either.
{61600}{61665}Where you going, darling?
{61667}{61716}By the sound of it...
{61773}{61810}Milan.
{62309}{62373}I see this as a very positive step|for a company,
{62375}{62453}who spent the last century|making a range of shoes for men,
{62455}{62605}to start the next century|making shoes for a range of men.
{62647}{62684}Any questions?
{63006}{63100}Sorry, love. I thought you were|going in to work at nine.
{63103}{63162}No, I did, Mrs Cobb, I was.
{63165}{63234}- I am.|- Sorry.
{63625}{63649}Don.
{64017}{64074}Have you got|any toilets down here?
{64076}{64137}I'm afraid we've only got|men's and women's.
{64260}{64331}Charlie.|She's locked herself in the loo.
{64333}{64376}- What?|- Come on.
{64419}{64464}Right. Go in there. Tell her...
{64466}{64536}- No, the gent's loo.|- Right.
{64616}{64665}What's up, Mel?
{64885}{64951}Lola, it's Charlie. Are you OK?
{65071}{65106}Are you ill?
{65108}{65155}Yeah, I'm sick.
{65158}{65234}- Ask your boys.|- Oh, God. Is this Don?
{65308}{65355}Has he nicked your dress?
{65399}{65448}I came like this.
{65477}{65565}God. Put on a frock,
{65567}{65667}and I can sing Stand By Your Man|in front of 500 strangers.
{65669}{65757}Put on a pair of jeans, and I can't even|sodding well say hello.
{65811}{65926}I have to say,|I was going to suggest dressing down.
{66026}{66075}Well, thank you for your concern.
{66249}{66308}Come on, tell me.
{66338}{66385}- Boxer.|- Get out of here.
{66388}{66466}I'm serious.|He had me doing training.
{66469}{66568}Weights. I could bench-press 93 kilos.
{66570}{66674}I owe all my spectacular|muscle definition to my father.
{66676}{66747}What, he never...|The whole wearing frocks thing...
{66749}{66788}Well, he wasn't stupid.
{66791}{66890}He knew there'd be few cross-dressing|heavyweight champions of the world.
{66892}{66937}Yeah.
{66985}{67036}No, he disowned me.
{67112}{67165}Wouldn't see me.
{67268}{67339}Even when he got lung cancer,|he wouldn't.
{67447}{67529}So, it's ironic really.
{67621}{67672}Fags got him in the end.
{67822}{67875}I mean, that's what it was all about.
{67906}{67957}Fitting in.
{67959}{68033}Melding in. Not standing out.
{68076}{68207}As far as he was concerned, if you're|big, black and a boxer you are sorted.
{68234}{68306}If you're big and you're black|and you're in a...
{68308}{68405}you know... strapless cocktail dress,|that's not so good.
{68407}{68468}That's what my dad wanted, an' all.
{68470}{68519}A strapless cocktail dress?
{68521}{68624}No. For me to fit in.|To this place.
{68651}{68726}You know, it should be me|that's hiding in here, not you.
{68728}{68808}I'm the one who doesn't know|what he's doing.
{68811}{68895}God, it'd kill him|to hear me say that, too.
{68897}{68977}Although he probably knew,|and that's probably what did.
{69076}{69104}Well.
{69168}{69246}Perhaps we just have to pretend|we do know what we're doing.
{69303}{69439}Charlie from Northampton,|Simon from Clacton.
{69598}{69647}Come on, let's make boots.
{70988}{71049}Cover me, girls. I'm going in.
{71513}{71543}For...
{73943}{74029}While tearing off
{74032}{74091}A game of golf
{74094}{74203}I might make a play|for the caddie
{74206}{74259}But when I do
{74261}{74325}I don't follow through
{74327}{74460}Coœ my heart belongs to Daddy
{74462}{74519}If I invite
{74522}{74579}A boy some night
{74582}{74681}To dine on my fine finnan haddie
{74683}{74748}Though I just adore
{74750}{74822}His asking for more
{74825}{74950}But my heart belongs to Daddy
{74999}{75052}That's where you applaud, Charlie.
{75356}{75425}Don't you have a show tonight?
{75453}{75508}Sore throat.
{75511}{75558}But my heart...
{75665}{75772}You know you don't have to work|in the rough-stuff room.
{75775}{75822}But I feel at home here.
{75858}{75915}They're my friends.
{75948}{76059}Besides, one never knows what joy|one might find amongst the unwanted.
{76153}{76210}And abandoned.
{76522}{76558}Charlie boy.
{76807}{76854}Morning, stranger.
{76894}{76968}Nic, look, about last night.
{76992}{77051}Things got a little bit crazy|at work and...
{77054}{77122}It won't always be like that.|I promise.
{77124}{77235}- No, really, it won't be.|- OK.
{77238}{77318}See, I think I've found|a solution for the factory.
{77321}{77434}Well, that makes two of us.|Come on.
{77436}{77491}One second, Mrs Cobb.
{77630}{77656}God.
{77659}{77689}Come in.
{77767}{77835}- There we go.|- Thank you.
{77837}{77905}And the room's all right|for you then, love, is it?
{77907}{78006}Absolutely lovely, Mrs Cobb, yes.|Lots of...
{78008}{78047}Lots of trinkets.
{78049}{78146}Now, the little pottery shoes,|they're good luck, you see?
{78148}{78232}You know, like Whitby|has lucky glass ducks,
{78235}{78296}Northampton has lucky pottery shoes.
{78298}{78357}Can I just ask, are you a man?
{78448}{78476}I am, love, yes.
{78479}{78571}That's fine. Just so's I know|how to leave the toilet seat.
{78574}{78629}I'll get some biscuits.
{79308}{79338}Mr Price.
{79341}{79384}Charlie, this is Richard Bailey
{79387}{79450}I was sorry to hear about your dad.
{79452}{79494}Shall we?
{79496}{79549}The beauty is the building.
{79551}{79637}For us developers,|it's more a case of what we don't do.
{79640}{79710}- Isn't it?|- And if you look in here,
{79712}{79788}you will see the bedroom.
{80090}{80153}So, what do you think?
{80155}{80228}We... I mean, one day, Nic,
{80230}{80365}if this is what you want, but isn't it|slightly out of our price range?
{80502}{80569}Not all buildings deserve|a second life, Mr Price,
{80571}{80713}but factories like this,|like yours, they're special.
{80804}{80853}Sorry?
{80855}{80933}Are you under the illusion|that Prices is for sale?
{80985}{81062}I know you're trying to help|but if you hang in there a bit,
{81064}{81097}I make you this promise.
{81099}{81152}A promise like the Jimmy Choo shoes?
{81155}{81229}Hang on. You're talking about|the history of my family.
{81231}{81290}But isn't this the future of it|right here?
{81293}{81336}I don't know, Nicola. Is it?
{81338}{81404}I mean, if I can't get you|to summon up some faith...
{81406}{81523}OK, give me it, Charlie. Come on.|What have I got to have faith in?
{81526}{81581}Now, I've suggested selling the factory
{81583}{81644}to a brilliant developer|who's interested.
{81646}{81709}And who's done all that.|You know?
{81711}{81805}Made all that happen.|What's your plan?
{81807}{81840}Charlie boy.
{81842}{81903}I've found Soho.
{81905}{81980}A little corner of Soho in Northampton,|that brasserie.
{81982}{82039}We're not talking Hoxton,|but never mind.
{82042}{82151}Sorry, I'm Lola. I'm the one designing|his range of transvestite boots.
{82299}{82437}There's a slight chill in the air.
{82439}{82488}Isn't there?
{82802}{82830}That is the...
{82832}{82883}- Plan.|- Yeah.
{82886}{82951}Listen, Nic,|I have not gone into this lightly.
{82953}{82994}And there is a market...
{82997}{83079}Can I just say|before you make a fool of yourself
{83082}{83174}trying to save the factory because,|"It's the history of my family",
{83176}{83270}the reason Richard came to see me,|OK, not you,
{83273}{83342}was because your dad approached him|about selling.
{83413}{83491}You see, you owe your father nothing,|Charlie Price.
{83525}{83584}You are free.
{83586}{83628}To walk.
{85288}{85331}Right. That's it.
{85333}{85421}We've terminated production|on all Derbys, brogues and Oxfords.
{85423}{85501}From now on, the factory|is 100 percent on the new range.
{85504}{85539}Or we will not hit Milan.
{85541}{85621}So, we need at least|fifteen new designs from Lola.
{85624}{85677}And at least six samples of each.
{85679}{85718}And remember.
{85720}{85787}You are not making footwear.
{85789}{85846}You are not making boots.
{85849}{86007}You are making two-and-a-half feet|of irresistible, tubular sex.
{86083}{86161}None of the major firms|just take a stand.
{86163}{86255}All the big boys hire the main runway,|so we will need that.
{86258}{86342}I mean, we need Milan to go like, pow.
{86344}{86409}Like the two of did|that night at The Angel, yeah?
{86411}{86478}I mean we need to take|The Angel Club to Milan.
{86480}{86544}We will take|The Angel Club to Milan.
{86654}{86703}Well, you wouldn't put a frock on.
{86705}{86785}If you don't want to get off|with blokes, why put a frock on?
{86787}{86871}Thing is, Mike, ask any woman|what she likes most in a man.
{86873}{87007}Compassion, tenderness, sensitivity.|Traditionally the female virtues.
{87009}{87143}Perhaps what women secretly desire|is a man who is fundamentally a woman.
{87773}{87824}- He's coming.|- Right.
{88256}{88328}Hello, Don. Tell me,|what do you think I could do
{88330}{88387}that would make me more of a man?
{88390}{88437}Look, a piece of paper down here.
{88439}{88519}Why not write down what you think|would make me more of a man
{88521}{88607}and I'll write down what I think|would make you more of a man?
{88610}{88681}If I do what's on yours,|you do what's on mine, right?
{88740}{88776}Piss off.
{88890}{88916}Fine.
{88984}{89050}So, is our Don a man, do you think?
{89052}{89103}Well, he dresses like one.
{89162}{89215}- Good answer.|- I was pleased with it.
{89218}{89267}Great, love. Go home.
{89324}{89375}Come on, Don. Be a man.
{89552}{89611}- You don't have to do this.|- I do. You know why?
{89614}{89700}Coœ what Don's written on my paper|is a bloody walk in the park
{89702}{89743}compared to what I've written.
{89745}{89817}We've 24 hours.|I could do without industrial unrest.
{89819}{89870}Calm down, it's not boxing.
{90063}{90100}Sorry.
{91615}{91649}Play.
{94717}{94784}So, the...
{94786}{94835}Yeah, well...
{94926}{94965}Why'd you stop?
{94998}{95055}I wouldn't want you|to walk into the factory
{95057}{95133}and feel that people|didn't respect you, Don.
{95135}{95215}I wouldn't want anyone else|to know what that feels like.
{95523}{95582}Change your mind about someone.
{95700}{95747}Nice one, champ.|Get the beers in?
{95750}{95790}Yeah, yeah, yeah.
{96484}{96533}Oh, Christ.
{96583}{96659}How much does that buy us?
{96661}{96737}The main runway,|from between 4.30 to 5.00.
{96739}{96798}After Closerie and before Tricker's.
{96960}{97096}OK. Hi. Listen, I'm sorry.|We can't afford it.
{97148}{97199}Just...
{97202}{97307}- How much for the dancers?|- Well all this is Lola's estimate
{97309}{97358}for the Blue Angel boys and expenses.
{97361}{97408}Could you get it for under 20,000?
{97410}{97465}- Well, why 20?|- Could you?
{97467}{97526}- Why 20?|- Because that is what the bank
{97529}{97580}will give me against my house.
{97582}{97612}Hello?
{97640}{97664}What?
{97705}{97782}- Take it.|- Pronto.
{97784}{97897}At least one Mr Price didn't sit around|saying, "What can I do?"
{97900}{97924}Take it.
{98033}{98092}Come on.|Tea break finished five minutes ago.
{98095}{98144}Come on, you know where that goes.
{98219}{98260}How are you getting on, George?
{98262}{98404}Why, it's surprisingly easy|if I just imagine Pat wearing 'em.
{98424}{98463}Is it?
{98465}{98607}George. There's an indentation|in the leather. Bin it. Do it again.
{98610}{98663}I don't care, redo it.
{98665}{98730}- What if they're not assembled?|- They will be.
{98732}{98774}It's four o'clock.
{98776}{98844}They'll have to work over.|This is bloody Milan.
{98846}{98895}You don't get marks for effort.
{98993}{99061}Caffeine. Give us a hand, would you?
{99111}{99166}I needed a break|from Mr Shouty back there.
{99169}{99212}He's just tense, all right?
{99254}{99280}What?
{99283}{99330}Are you aware that you do that?
{99332}{99387}That you instinctively defend him?
{99465}{99514}Look at those puppies.
{99543}{99615}You know,|Charlie's dad used to have this theory
{99617}{99699}that you could tell everything|about a person from their shoes.
{99759}{99800}- Right. Come on, then.|- Oh, no.
{99882}{99941}Cheap but happy.
{100012}{100086}Very eager to please.
{100088}{100149}All right, all right.|Those, those, look.
{100152}{100232}Shiny but dull.
{100252}{100282}Oh, my God.
{100314}{100375}- Hello, Lauren.|- Hello, Nicola.
{100377}{100426}I love those shoes.
{100465}{100526}- Charlie's treat?|- Yeah, once upon a time.
{100528}{100561}What?
{100563}{100627}A girl can live with so many|once-upon-a-times
{100629}{100686}before she finally|has to buy them herself.
{100688}{100743}It's not like that with the factory,|is it?
{100745}{100781}- Sorry?|- Well, Charlie.
{100783}{100859}He said he was gonna save it.|Most guys would have gone,
{100861}{100910}"Hey, what can I do?"
{100912}{100996}Fallen at the first hurdle,|let alone remortgage their house.
{100998}{101047}You should see him in that factory.
{101049}{101106}It's like it's made him|twice as determined.
{101109}{101193}I'm sorry. Remortgaged the... what?
{101414}{101465}How are we?
{101502}{101544}No.
{101546}{101618}For God's sake, Melanie.|This is Milan.
{101621}{101696}These seams aren't straight.|You're rushing it.
{101732}{101758}Pardon?
{101760}{101831}You're gonna have to unpick|all this and start again.
{101833}{101910}Thought that might...|This is Saturday.
{101912}{101986}- You've got enough completed.|- No, I haven't.
{101989}{102050}Some of us have got|a life outside this factory.
{102053}{102120}You're gonna have|a bloody lot more of it in a bit.
{102157}{102259}Mel, you don't understand.|This is Milan.
{102261}{102374}It's Mil...|How do you know what Milan is?
{102377}{102450}You don't know. You're guessing.
{102452}{102503}Perhaps you'd have it finished by now
{102506}{102640}if you hadn't made us|undo every single bloody stitch.
{102642}{102691}But, Mel, they weren't good enough.
{102693}{102771}- They were good enough for your dad.|- But I'm not my dad.
{102773}{102839}Hey. I'll tell you what, Charlie Price.
{102841}{102914}Never a bloody truer word.
{102916}{103015}Mel. We have to leave|at six in the morning. Please.
{103017}{103066}A word, Charlie.
{103097}{103175}I'm actually in a bit of a crisis here.
{103197}{103232}I think so.
{103317}{103385}Is it not bad enough|you're making this kind of crap
{103387}{103432}thinking you'll save the factory?
{103435}{103490}But the fact|you remortgaged the house...
{103492}{103560}- What?|- Charlie, Lauren didn't realise.
{103578}{103699}Our house. No one will ever say|I didn't stand by my man, Charlie.
{103701}{103826}I've done it. I'll stand by you now.|Just... a reason.
{103829}{103900}- Nicola.|- Give me a reason.
{103902}{103972}- Down there.|- Looking at you, Charlie Price.
{103974}{104025}Give me a reason. Standing here.
{104028}{104114}Making porn-wear for hermaphrodites.
{104117}{104195}Hermaphrodites have both sets|of reproductive organs.
{104197}{104233}Get out.
{104449}{104543}Where was it for London?|All this money?
{104638}{104755}Don't. Flat the size of a postage stamp,|because we have to be careful, Nic,
{104757}{104847}- but hey bloody presto...|- London was for you.
{104878}{104919}London was for us.
{104922}{104992}You wouldn't spend|another five grand on us,
{104994}{105096}but you'll bloody remortgage the house|to keep people we don't know in a job.
{105098}{105161}I do know them.|It's you that doesn't know them.
{105163}{105218}Because you never come in here.
{105220}{105366}I've already had to fire 15 of them and|they were the 15 worst times of my life.
{105369}{105408}- So sell it.|- Nicola.
{105411}{105466}I don't...
{105468}{105538}Do they know|your dad was gonna sell up?
{105540}{105634}You know? Even your dad.|Have you told them that?
{105636}{105685}I don't care what he was gonna do.
{105688}{105752}I don't care|that he was gonna sell the place.
{105754}{105803}OK. I, here, me, now. Charlie Price,
{105805}{105876}doesn't actually enjoy|making people redundant.
{105878}{105968}And if you can't hear a reason yet,|then maybe you won't ever get it.
{105970}{106027}Maybe you won't ever get me.
{106029}{106128}Maybe Nicola Marsden|will never ever quite get Charlie Price.
{106263}{106310}Maybe I won't.
{107730}{107785}Oh, sod it.
{107862}{107981}It's probably my fault. Putting Dad up,|making some hero out of him.
{107983}{108042}You shouldn't do that.
{108045}{108160}I suppose I just didn't wanna be|the last photo in the line, you know?
{108163}{108229}The Price who left nothing.
{108231}{108309}Maybe you shouldn't|judge it in bricks, Charlie.
{108311}{108376}Maybe you judge|what you leave behind
{108378}{108431}by what you inspire in other people.
{108772}{108798}Charlie?
{108946}{109034}'Scuse me. 'Scuse me please.
{109036}{109085}Coming through.
{109124}{109173}Coffee? Cup of tea?
{109262}{109296}Charlie.
{109298}{109359}Did you get them to do this?
{109362}{109456}Rather rose to the challenge|of changing his mind about someone.
{109458}{109484}You?
{109487}{109554}No, Charlie. You.
{110715}{110764}Here we go.
{111443}{111494}My God.
{111496}{111634}Hey, everyone.|The man from Milan, he say yes.
{112126}{112179}Cheers.
{113196}{113292}- Come on, Lauren.|- No.
{114262}{114326}He's had quite an impact|on us girls, hasn't he?
{114397}{114446}Charlie Price.
{115424}{115469}I saw a documentary once.
{115472}{115564}Potholers. They'd have a celebration|the night before they went down
{115566}{115613}in case they never came out.
{115616}{115683}Of course, now Northampton|is the perfect venue.
{115685}{115761}- I...|- A little warning.
{115763}{115812}The answer is, "I'd love to, Lola."
{116054}{116092}Stop it.
{116154}{116195}- Table for one?|- For two.
{116197}{116265}- Two. Right here.|- I'll just use your toilet.
{116267}{116332}Toilets, yes,|just down the stairs on the left.
{116535}{116592}Richard.
{116594}{116620}Oh, Christ.
{116623}{116658}It's Charlie Price.
{116660}{116730}Oh, no. Absolutely. From Prices, yeah.
{116797}{116848}Didn't expect to see you at La Conceria.
{116850}{116911}Not one of your normal haunts this,|is it?
{116913}{116972}We're having a meeting.|It's about business.
{116975}{117061}Business? God.|Never lets up, does it? Same with me.
{117364}{117417}They're running away.
{118322}{118375}Charlie boy.
{118454}{118501}Sorry I'm late.|You know how it is.
{118504}{118574}I'm sitting with all my dresses|on my bed, thinking,
{118576}{118673}"Is it hot in Milan? Is it cool?|Does it get cold at night?"
{118711}{118762}Thank you.
{118765}{118834}You couldn't get me a Bloody Mary,|could you?
{118836}{118870}Bloody Mary for the lady.
{118872}{118929}The whole potholing thing,|I didn't mean it.
{118932}{119012}I don't think it will go tits up.|I mean, the show. The routine.
{119014}{119084}Wait till you see what|I have planned for the catwalk.
{119086}{119131}- If we market it...|- Lola.
{119134}{119222}It's not just us who'll go for 'em.|There's a whole club scene...
{119224}{119295}- Stop.|- What?
{119297}{119365}People are staring.|Come on, what do you want?
{119367}{119418}I don't think anybody's staring.
{119421}{119495}You are a man in a frock in Northampton.|They're staring.
{119497}{119562}Even if they're not looking,|they're staring.
{119633}{119698}I'm a Northampton shoe designer,|Charlie.
{119700}{119798}Yeah, You're that as well.|You're also a man in a dress.
{119800}{119871}You make it sound as if I put this on
{119873}{119965}because of the lack|of a pair of trousers.
{119968}{120050}Is there a part of you|that actually believes that, Charlie?
{120052}{120144}I don't know why you wear dresses|and I don't think you do either.
{120263}{120322}I didn't realise|I was causing you trouble.
{120325}{120400}Forget it. All right.|You are a very good designer.
{120402}{120478}You'd like me to come and design|then disappear when I'm me.
{120480}{120591}You is the designer. This is not you.|This is you in a dress, looking daft.
{120593}{120652}You don't have to.|I don't know what you think.
{120655}{120718}If this is about dodging|what sex you get off on...
{120720}{120781}If you think you are|somehow being mystical,
{120783}{120883}being the best of either sex,|I have to tell you, Simon...
{120950}{120999}Simon.
{121002}{121125}Stood there in a frock right now|you look like the worst bits of both.
{121450}{121580}Stop hiding. Be brave.|Decide one way or the other.
{121608}{121657}For my sake, tomorrow, please,
{121660}{121730}turn up looking like|the picture on your passport.
{122877}{122938}I can't change what I want, Charlie.
{122977}{123065}I cannot change what I want.
{123117}{123156}I can't do that.
{123326}{123356}George.
{123358}{123417}Hey. No Lola.
{123437}{123476}- George.|- Mr Price.
{123479}{123517}Are we all set?
{123519}{123564}Did she say she was gonna be late?
{123567}{123690}No, actually she said|she was gonna fly out with the girls.
{123693}{123767}- What, from London?|- Lola.
{126785}{126867}Funny, isn't it?|They look quite dead like this.
{126870}{126954}Don't worry, George.|It'll be a different story tomorrow.
{126997}{127136}Look. That's us.|The Milan main catwalk.
{127183}{127248}The Angel girls|wearing our boys, eh, Charlie?
{127751}{127853}You know, as Lola would say, there's|a slight chill in the air, Charlie.
{127919}{128028}- And I'm getting worried...|- I had an argument with her.
{128031}{128084}- What?|- With Lola.
{128087}{128157}Last night in the restaurant. See...
{128159}{128266}She turned up in a dress and I just...
{128435}{128478}She didn't go to London, did she?
{128515}{128564}She didn't get on a plane at all.
{128623}{128707}Lauren. There was a bloke|that wanted to buy the factory.
{128710}{128798}Richard Bailey. He was with Nicola|at the restaurant and I just...
{128800}{128842}All that does not apply to me.
{128844}{128920}What applies is that there is|nobody here to wear our boots
{128922}{128998}that we have worked our arses off|to get here, Charlie.
{129000}{129053}OK. I... Yes, I am sorry,
{129056}{129132}but it's just I felt|somehow useless as a man.
{129228}{129382}Sitting there in the restaurant,|I felt somehow useless as a man.
{129467}{129535}So here we are again.
{129537}{129635}Charlie Price, standing in front of me,
{129667}{129778}saying, "It's not my fault.|What can I do?"
{130216}{130263}- Hello, this is Lola.|- Lola.
{130266}{130350}I'm not here now. Well, I am|here, but you know what to do.
{130400}{130550}Lola, when you pick this up,|this is a Charlie from Northampton.
{131578}{131703}OK, we have the exhibitors, please?|For Prices?
{131750}{131780}That's me.
{131782}{131835}And the dressers?
{131837}{131863}That's me.
{131865}{131903}The models?
{131981}{132045}That's you as well, isn't it?
{132169}{132276}George. OK, he's all set.|He looks fantastic.
{132312}{132371}...Prices.|- Go.
{132373}{132476}Ladies and Gentlemen, please take|your seats for the Prices collection.
{132479}{132530}Does he look sexy?
{132573}{132612}He does to me, George.
{132855}{132984}Ladies and Gentlemen, please take|your seats for the Prices collection.
{133140}{133212}OK? OK.
{133276}{133331}This is it, it's you, Mr Price.
{133760}{133790}Shit.
{136231}{136259}You keep lying
{136262}{136319}When you oughta be truthin'
{136352}{136475}And you keep losin'|when you oughta not bet
{136478}{136593}You keep samin'|when you oughta be changin'
{136595}{136628}Now what's right is right
{136630}{136691}But you ain't been right yet
{136721}{136785}These boots are made for walking
{136787}{136854}And that's just what they'll do
{136856}{136967}One of these days these boots|are gonna walk all over you
{137119}{137196}I once met a man|with a sense of adventure
{137198}{137236}He was dressed to thrill
{137238}{137279}Wherever he went
{137281}{137381}He said,|"Let's make love on a mountain top"
{137383}{137448}"Under the stars, on a big hard rock"
{137450}{137490}I said, "In these shoes?"
{137517}{137556}"I don't think so"
{137558}{137595}Here I am looking for crime
{137597}{137636}I'm looking for some action
{137639}{137688}What I have a million times
{137690}{137741}Will give you satisfaction
{137743}{137786}So don't you mess around with me
{137788}{137827}You won't know what to do
{137829}{137868}Coœ I'll put on my cha cha heels
{137871}{137916}And walk all over you
{137919}{137999}Gimme gimme cha cha heels
{138002}{138103}All I want is cha cha heels
{138105}{138195}Gimme gimme cha cha heels
{138197}{138304}If I don't get my cha cha heels|I'll walk all over you
{138384}{138418}Zippin' up my boots
{138467}{138543}Goin' back to my roots, yeah
{138563}{138614}To the place of my birth
{138661}{138710}Back down to earth
{138771}{138912}I'm homeward bound|Got my head turned around
{138914}{138955}Zippin' up my boots
{138995}{139050}Goin' back to my roots
{139672}{139717}Come on, Lauren.
{139846}{139889}Stand by your man, Lauren.
{139933}{139978}Thank you.
{140970}{141087}Lola, this is a Charlie|from Northampton.
{141089}{141202}I'm looking at a shoe fair programme|with a big gap where you should be.
{141205}{141254}But I have to say,|unlike most people,
{141256}{141309}wherever you leave,|you leave a gap, Lola.
{141312}{141425}You will in Northampton.|You have in Milan.
{141427}{141498}Listen, if people ever tell you,|you look half a man,
{141500}{141551}you gotta remember, that's fine.
{141553}{141602}I mean,|I don't know what half a man is.
{141605}{141674}I don't know what the hell a man is.
{141676}{141756}But I know that|if it involves being brave,
{141759}{141884}you are more of a man than|I will ever be. Goodbye, Lola.
{142157}{142227}Don't think that's why I came.
{142229}{142276}I came for the adulation.
{142739}{142788}Why am I leaving you?
{142831}{142886}I'm afraid in life,
{142889}{142981}Lola has always been drawn|to the most exciting,
{142983}{143046}the most daring,
{143048}{143136}the most sexy.
{143188}{143282}There is tell of a mystical place,|far north of here,
{143285}{143349}called Northampton.
{143373}{143465}Exciting, because|it contains a shoe factory
{143468}{143552}struggling to survive|against all the odds.
{143554}{143677}Daring, because it's run|by a man brave enough to recognise
{143680}{143784}that a factory is its people,|not its bricks.
{143786}{143914}And sexy,|well, because now I work there.
{143950}{144011}And the craftsmen of fantasy,
{144014}{144139}for ladies, gentlemen,|and those of you who are yet...
{144142}{144191}...to make up your minds.
{144194}{144321}Tonight I give you,|the Kinky Boot Factory.
{144691}{144769}Yes sir I can boogie
{144772}{144860}If you stay you can't go wrong
{144863}{144910}I can boogie
{144912}{144957}Boogie woogie
{144960}{145069}All night long
{145071}{145237}No sir, I don't feel|very much like talking
{145239}{145314}No neither walking
{145316}{145394}You want to know if I can dance
{145449}{145610}Yes sir,|already told you in the first verse
{145612}{145688}And in the chorus
{145690}{145772}But I will give you|one more chance
{145828}{145908}Yes sir I can boogie
{145910}{145998}But I need a certain song
{146001}{146046}I can boogie
{146048}{146093}Boogie woogie
{146095}{146206}All night long
{146209}{146279}Yes sir I can boogie
{146281}{146373}If you stay you can't go wrong
{146376}{146425}I can boogie
{146428}{146468}Boogie woogie
{146470}{146581}All night long
{146584}{146660}Yes sir I can boogie
{146662}{146756}But I need a certain song
{146759}{146800}I can boogie
{146803}{146848}Boogie woogie
{146850}{146955}All night long
