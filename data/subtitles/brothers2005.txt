1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,270
- Doggerel?
- Yep. It means bad poetry.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,440
I know what it means.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,080
You just turned my dog into doggerel.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,970
And it's what, 13 points?

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,320
Nope, 26.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,490
Double word score.

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,020
I am forfeiting this game.

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,010
Oh, come on, Robert. You can't forfeit.

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,480
Sure I can. I've gotfive I's and an O.

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,290
Besides, you look too beautiful.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,640
Focus. You have to focus.

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,580
I didn't come all the way up
here just to play board games.

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,160
You're not trying.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,720
Now come on. You said you had an O.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,670
Do you... do you havean... an r?

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,960
You could spell rumor.

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,240
Okay, let me see your letters.

18
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,490
- Oh, look at that. You have a T.
- So?

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,030
So you can spell tumor.

20
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,510
I don't want you staring at the word tumor.

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,760
Robert... do you think that I
have forgotten that I have cancer?

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,100
I had Kevin reschedule tomorrow's
press conference

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,020
in case the chemo takes
longer than they say.

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,340
Oh, no, no, no.You don't... you don't have
to do that, because, uh, I'm gonna be fine.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,060
No, it's your first time. I should be there.

26
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,620
No, sorry. I've already decided that
you are not gonna be my chemo buddy.

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,310
W-w-well, who
is?

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,730
I don't know. I have a whole gaggle of
family members just waiting in line.

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,240
But you, my friend, you are gonna
be concentrating on the campaign.

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,960
What has happened to you?

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,570
I mean, you didn't even want me in this race, 

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,300
- and now I want to be there for you...
- You're gonna be there for me.

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
You're running for Governor.
You're not going to the moon.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,700
And besides, the last thing I
need is you quitting on my account.

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,970
Okay.

36
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,570
Can I at least quit this game?

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,780
Yes.

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,630
You can.

39
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,420
Excuse me, Dr. Condon?

40
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,470
Yes?

41
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,810
I'm, uh, Justin.

42
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,880
Justin Walker.

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm sorry. Office hours don't start until 1:00.

44
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,820
You know what? This will only take a second.

45
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,070
I've been reading upon the
cancer research you've been doing, 

46
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,610
and I know it's a bit late, but I was
wondering if I could possibly join your team?

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,480
My assistant positions
were filled a month ago.

48
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,010
I know. And I know this
would be making an exception.

49
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,590
Well, even if I could, my grant funding
only allows a certain number of students.

50
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,450
Okay, you know what ?I'd, uh, I'd volunteer.

51
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,490
I'd, uh, I'd work for free.

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
- Uh, what year are you?
- First.

53
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,380
You know, in my experience, it's
better not to rush into specializing.

54
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,070
You might want to take a year or two, 

55
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,310
make sure oncology's what
you really want to do.

56
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,020
No, its.

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,310
Look, I'll, uh, I'll do anything.

58
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,550
I'll, uh, empty your trash.

59
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,610
I'll sweep the floors.

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,280
I can, uh, offer you a pen that works.

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,750
Here you go.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,010
What was your name again?

63
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,610
Justin Walker.

64
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,300
I'll think about it, Justin.

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,370
Thank you. Thank you.

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,120
Um, I won't disappoint you.

67
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,450
- Sorry I'm late.
- Where are we?

68
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,130
- We?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,680
- You mean me.
- Okay. That's all right. We'll catch up.

70
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,650
I was trying to getan internship with Dr. Condon.

71
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,380
But you barely got this under control.

72
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,800
- Look, I can handle this.
- Look, I told you.

73
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,990
I'm not gonna get dragged down

74
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,610
but your unfocused, naive
approach to medical school.

75
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,220
Look, I told you I can handle this.

76
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,640
All right, Carter?

77
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,720
- Unbelievable.
- Carter.

78
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,190
I know this is probably not
what you're in the mood for, 

79
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,580
but, uh, Rebecca and I are
gonna look at wedding venues today.

80
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,530
I would so love to, but I can't today.

81
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,870
It's, um, Kitty's first chemo
treatment, and I have to be there.

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,230
She hates hospitals, and she hates needles, 

83
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,770
and it's... it's gonna be a very rough day.

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,820
- She needs me.
- Of course.

85
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,960
Besides that, I really don't want to

86
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,910
intrude on your mother-daughter time.

87
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,450
Please, we're going to be in-laws soon enough.

88
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,970
We would love to have you with us.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,910
Thank you, Holly. I really appreciate that.

90
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,040
Okay, bye.

91
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,640
Holly, you wanted to see me.

92
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,740
Uh, yeah.

93
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,250
I want you to follow up a
line on a juice broker.

94
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,230
I think I have finally located
a supply of cheap wine

95
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,970
that we can use to make our blend.

96
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,550
I would do this myself, but
I have promised Rebecca

97
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,510
that we would look at wedding venues today.

98
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,310
Okay, but don't you think we should
wait until Sarah gets back to work?

99
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,440
I mean, she needs to weigh in on the possibility of

100
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,350
a low-budget or a second line plan.

101
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,960
And who knows? She might
have found something in France.

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,750
Well, we need the revenue now.

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,390
We need to put this deal into
motion with the broker today.

104
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,190
Okay, well, how do you know people
are gonna buy this $2.99 swill, Holly?

105
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,990
In this economy, people will
buy it if we market it correctly.

106
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,130
And if you give them a lottery
ticket to distract them from the taste.

107
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,520
You know what, Saul?

108
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,210
Forget that I even asked.

109
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,570
If that's the way you want
to leave it, that's fine with me.

110
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,540
No, what I want is to
generate new revenue now.

111
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,410
We have no idea how long it's gonna be

112
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,040
before people are willing to
buy high-end products again.

113
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,990
And quite frankly, we can't afford to wait.

114
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,900
- What, are we having company?
- No.

115
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,760
No. I just want to be prepared.

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,240
We don't know how you'll
feel after this first treatment.

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,680
So I made all your favorites.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,060
I made tapioca pudding.

119
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,560
I made fresh banana bread, lots
of p... no, no, don't, don't.

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,650
Don't... don't drink that.

121
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,860
You don't want any of that. No, no, no,
look, I made you a protein drink, 

122
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,330
because they say you shouldn't go
there on an empty stomach.

123
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,690
Yes, so I made you a great protein drink.

124
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,530
And it has almond milk and protein powder and... 

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,150
It's thick.

126
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,130
- A little thick.
- Well, let me just thin it out for you.

127
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,850
And then I'll put it in a travel
mug, because we can take it with us.

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,080
And I am all ready to go.

129
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,890
Oh, mom. Oh, God, mom. I'm so sorry.

130
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,680
I totally forgot to tell you that... 

131
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,110
that Sarah is actually going
to come here and pick me up, 

132
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,800
and... and she's gonna be my
chemo buddy for today.

133
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,140
Oh, great. Good.

134
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,420
I mean, I, you know, I've hardly seen
her since she got back from France, 

135
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,150
and I thought that it would be a
nice opportunity for us to catch up.

136
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,130
So, you know, it doesn't
all have to fall on you, okay?

137
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,610
I mean, look at... look at all you've done
so far, and it's only 10:00 in the morning.

138
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,170
I mean, I think you should take the day.

139
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,400
Take the day and just enjoy
yourself, because guess what.

140
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,470
- What?
- I am gonna be fine.

141
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,470
Yes, yes.

142
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,570
I know that. I know that.

143
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,860
Yeah.

144
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,170
Absolutely.

145
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,770
The truth is, Kitty and I spent a great
deal of time weighing this decision, 

146
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,120
and the choice was clear... we could
suspend our campaign and let the cancer win, 

147
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,120
or we could continue to live our own
lives and stand up for what we believe in.

148
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,290
And so that's why I'm staying in the race, 

149
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,990
because Kitty and I believe
that's what's best for our family

150
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,150
as well as the state of California.

151
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,460
Okay, I'll take a few questions now.

152
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,780
Uh, one at a time. Steve.

153
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,100
- Senator, I think I speak for everyone in wishing Kitty well.
- Thank you.

154
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,450
But to focus on your decision
to keep campaigning... 

155
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,440
do you risk losing donors who may
fear you might drop out down the road?

156
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,250
Well, uh, I think that my donors
appreciate that I'm stead fast in my decisions.

157
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
So, no, I... I don't think that's gonna be an issue.

158
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,840
Yes, Lynda.

159
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,070
If Mrs. McCallister does support
your decision to stay in the race, 

160
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,300
why isn't she here today?

161
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,920
She's at home recuperating.

162
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,760
Of course, but, Senator, are you concerned

163
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,680
that continuing your gubernatorial run

164
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,620
in the face of your
wife'sconditions will appear callous?

165
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,650
Well, I think most Californians would
appreciate that this is a private, family matter, 

166
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,100
and I think that they'll judge it as such.

167
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,490
Next question.

168
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,730
Now, Kitty, you may feel a little
cold as it reaches your vein.

169
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay.

170
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,600
Here, let's warm you up. Come on.

171
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,650
Get you nice and warm.

172
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,850
Sarah... can you, uh, can you talk please?

173
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,300
What do you want me to talk about?

174
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,450
I don't know. I don't know. Anything.

175
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,960
You can talk about your trip.

176
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,850
Okay.

177
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,230
there it is.

178
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,870
it's okay.

179
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,670
You're okay.

180
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,850
So... we were running late, 

181
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,690
sat on the tarmac for, like, two hours.

182
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,460
I don't know how the airlines get away with that.

183
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,630
We circled Paris for at least an hour... 

184
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,590
Sarah, tell me a good story.

185
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,590
I don't want to have
to fire my chemo buddy.

186
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,090
I met a guy.

187
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,670
You did?

188
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,170
- Really?
- Really.

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,420
Well, you didn't... you didn't tell me that.

190
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, I'm telling you now.

191
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,560
Oh, my God. Okay.

192
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,400
Okay, I want youto tell me every
detail, and don't skimp on anything.

193
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,100
Okay.

194
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,260
I was running late.

195
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,200
I'd been driving all morning.

196
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,630
I was lost looking for this little vineyard

197
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,130
outside a place called Bergerac...

198
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,340
Driving through these beautiful
fields peppered with sunflowers.

199
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,550
And there was this little farmlet, I
guess... beautiful, big, old barn.

200
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,230
Bonjour.

201
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,930
Je peux vous aider?

202
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,990
Bonjour.

206
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,770
Ca dit ici, uh, il faut tourner

207
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,740
à droite sur, uh, rue de Chollet.

208
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,040
Oh, no. Uh, no.

209
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,430
Tourner à gauche. Il faut tourner à

210
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,550
gauche on rue de... de, uh, Chollet.

211
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:13,310
Avez-vous entendu parler
de Chateau de, uh, Chollet?

212
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,600
Vin?

213
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,060
Vin?

214
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,380
You know... non.

215
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,090
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

216
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,920
Okay, look, I... I have an appointment.

217
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,010
Uh, j'ai rendez-vous... business.

218
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,350
It's a winery.

219
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,770
De Chollet.

220
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,610
Nothing?

221
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,850
Chateau Chollet.

222
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,210
Si. Oui, oui, oui. Chateau Chollet.

223
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,610
Of course. It's not so far.

224
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,710
You speak English?

225
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,840
Oui, bien sûr!

226
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,950
Of course.

227
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,150
Well, I'm very glad to have amused you.

228
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,480
It was cute.

229
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,210
Could you please give me some directions?

230
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,160
- I'm... I'm running late for this appointment.
- I take you.

231
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,310
I take you.

232
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,770
You'll take me?

233
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,370
Are... are
you sure?

234
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,770
Let's eat, and then we go.

235
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,640
Oh, uh, no.

236
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,030
I'm sorry I didn't explain myself.

237
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,070
I'm running late.

238
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,890
- I have to...
- You don't want me to take you?

239
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,970
Uh... no, no.

240
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,870
Uh... I just... I have to go now.

241
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,610
What do you think?

242
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,030
Kitty?

243
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,830
Kitty?

244
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,990
- How are you feeling? Everything okay?
- Yeah.

245
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,250
Any shortness of breath?

246
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,370
No, no. I... I feel great.

247
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,220
I... I feel like I could run a mile.

248
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,160
Good. How about chills, any of those?

249
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,070
- No, no, not at... not at all.
- Okay.

250
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,990
This is Sarah, my sister.

251
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,200
She just met a guy in France.

252
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,410
- Congratulations.
- Merci beaucoup.

253
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,410
She does seem to be shivering a little bit.

254
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,260
- Is that normal?
- Totally.

255
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,950
We'll just, uh, slow down the drip and
give you an extra dose of hydrocortisone, 

256
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,950
- see if that calms things down.
- Okay.

257
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,980
I wanted to go over, with both
of you, the post-care information.

258
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,740
Okay, okay, can you just please,
um, maybe give us one second?

259
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,300
Sure.

260
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,270
Did you... did you stay?

261
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,380
- Kitty.
- No, no, no, just tell me.

262
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,810
Of course I stayed.

263
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,160
You know, Jean Harlow once lived here.

264
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

265
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,900
I'm so glad I found you. Did I miss anything?

266
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,070
- Hi, I'm Nora. I'm... I'm the groom's mother.
- Oh, welcome.

267
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,570
- What... what are you doing here?
- Hi, honey.

268
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,930
I asked her.

269
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,100
I thought Kitty was getting a treatment.

270
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,610
Well, yes, she did. We were halfway
out the door, and Sarah showed up.

271
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,510
They haven't had any time to
be together since Sarah got back.

272
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,420
And then I got to come help you here.

273
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,860
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- Oh, this is so exciting.

274
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,310
I can use all the help I can get.

275
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,040
Well, I'm... I'm... I'm thrilled, and look at this!

276
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,840
Look at... this is an impressive place.

277
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,490
Jean Harlow once lived here.

278
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,190
Did she live here?

279
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
- Oh, that must be Sarah.
- Oh, no, no, it's mine.

280
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,770
I'm sorry, Rebecca. This will just be one minute.

281
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,280
Yeah, what is it?

282
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,250
Yeah, I... I just need the price of the juice.

283
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,710
Fine, fine. Put me through to the broker.

284
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,880
Uh, now most of our couples do a
cocktail hour right out here.

285
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,080
- We fill the pool with floating candles.
- It's beautiful.

286
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,080
I mean, what do you think, Nora?

287
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,270
Well, I... I think... I think you
have to, you know, feel it.

288
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,250
Feel what?

289
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,840
Well, feel that it's right.

290
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,180
Feel that it's like you and Justin.

291
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,820
Well, I mean, Justin likes water.

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,300
Uh, I'm so sorry.

293
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,870
So where were we?

294
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,350
Uh, why don't we go upstairs?

295
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,520
We have a fantastic area for the bridal suite.

296
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,310
Are they shooting a movie?

297
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,250
Are you shooting a movie here?

298
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,080
Uh, yes. Well, you know, we rent the
space out for a variety of events.

299
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,980
I thought they'd be done by now.

300
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,750
Must be a period piece.

301
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,240
I... I think it is.

302
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,570
What period?

303
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,240
Olden times.

304
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,730
Yes. I can't keep up.

305
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,670
But why don't we go look at the bridal suite?

306
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,020
Shall we?

307
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,640
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,220
Are they shooting porn?

309
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,280
Really?

310
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,480
Here, now?

311
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,990
Well, now... now we don't rent out the
space for filming on the weekends.

312
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,700
And I would be happy to throw in free valet.

313
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,630
Free valet.

314
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,380
Oh, no. I don't think so, no.

315
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,650
Go, go.

316
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,710
We can get to the street this way, can't we?

317
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,380
Go right down these stairs.

318
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,090
This wasn't supposed to happen.

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,590
We need to discuss the Kitty issue.

320
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,140
Ternal polls are showing a drop.

321
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,250
First of all, can we please not refer

322
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,320
to my wife's illness as the Kitty issue?

323
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,670
Okay, sorry.

324
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,280
But if we don't get Kitty out there and
show the public she's behind you, 

325
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,490
this is just gonna get worse.

326
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,430
No, it'll be worse if we do.

327
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,760
They'll think we're using her.

328
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,560
It's a risk, I agree, but we can't do nothing.

329
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,380
Look, Kevin... a... and jot
this down if you have to, 

330
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,680
because I'm... I'm not gonna say it again... 

331
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,170
Kitty's well-being has nothing
to do with the state of California

332
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,750
or my integrity or my job performance.

333
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,490
- Why can't we say that?
- We did say that.

334
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,730
We... we said that explicitly.

335
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,770
Yeah, and they didn't hear you.

336
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,970
You know why?

337
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,600
It came from the wrong mouth.

338
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,130
A statement at the least.

339
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,850
- No, I'm not gonna use her.
- I will help her draft it myself.

340
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,130
No, do not... Kevin, back o... 

341
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,060
there is too much in play for
you to see this clearly.

342
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,110
Leave Kitty alone.

343
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,650
She and I have made a decision.

344
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,560
And that should be good
enough for everybody!

345
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,500
Including you.

346
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,100
Spend the most important day of your
life in the opulent astin ballroom.

347
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,440
Details include fine linens with
buttercup or eggshell, 

348
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,940
silver, gold or black Chiavari chairs... 

349
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,180
What's Chiavari?

350
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,370
Well, it's that. That's a Chiavari chair.

351
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,010
Okay, wait. W... what else is in this...
this love in the afternoon package?

352
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,660
A love in the after... it includes
a chocolate fountain.

353
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,050
Yeah, the idea of the Walkers in the
same room with five tiers of hot, 

354
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,630
molten chocolate is pretty terrifying.

355
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,470
all of these packages... they're
like... the'yre like...

356
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,360
a slightly different version of
the same generic wedding.

357
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,830
Oh, well, maybe your mom has some
ideas how to personalize it.

358
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,330
Yeah, if she would ever get off the phone.

359
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,080
Sweetie, you know what? If you don't
like this venue, then we should just go.

360
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,110
There are plenty of others to look at.

361
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,720
Yeah, maybe we should.

362
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,340
So what do you think?

363
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,860
Does this place have potential?

364
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,270
- Uh, no. We're moving on.
- We just got here.

365
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,340
Well, maybe it seems that way because
you've been on the phone the entire time, 

366
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,890
Rebecca, I was only on
the phone for five minutes.

367
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,210
Look, why don't we not make any
decision until we tour the grounds?

368
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,500
Why, so we can just sign a check
and get the search over with?

369
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,620
I mean, I know that this is an
inconvenience for you, clearly, but... 

370
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,960
- You know, I... I don't think that...
- That's not what I'm saying.

371
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,060
I'm saying how can you
make an informed decision

372
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,940
without checking out the entire venue.

373
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,080
Because I've seen enough to
know that it's not right.

374
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,780
I mean, ask Nora. You either feel it or you don't.

375
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,730
Okay, I... I think there is something to that.

376
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,230
- But... but still, you... but...
- What, mom? You've never done this before.

377
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,890
Nora has, multiple times.

378
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,340
I mean, Kevin and Scotty'swedding was
perfect, and it was... it was so them.

379
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,010
I want that for Justin and me.

380
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,060
Oh, so what you're saying is that you
want to have your wedding at Nora's?

381
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
Well, she's sitting right here.

382
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,650
- So why don't you just ask her?
- You know, that... 

383
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,490
If you would just listen
for once, you would know

384
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,020
that's not what I'm saying at all.

385
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,530
- I'll tell them I'll call them right back.
- Take it. Take it.

386
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,040
That's what you'd rather be doing anyways.

387
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,140
- Rebecca, please.
- Take the call.

388
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,380
- I don't have to take it.
- Nora, I'm sorry we wasted your time.

389
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,310
To think that we could actually do this together?

390
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,160
- It's unbelievable.
- Rebecca, don't be this... 

391
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,130
Careful.

392
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,430
You'll sever the radial artery.

393
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,470
Hey, can you back up?

394
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,830
It's pretty hard to focus when
you're breathing down my neck.

395
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,530
Not bad.

396
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,890
- Uh, thanks.
- Thank you.

397
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,570
Justin, can you come by and see
me tomorrow during office hours?

398
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,060
Uh, yeah.

399
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,230
Everything... all right?

400
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,980
Just want to discuss a few things.

401
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,110
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

402
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,550
Great.

403
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,010
This is about last week's quiz.

404
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,200
Damn it.

405
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,830
I thought I nailed it. We studied
that for, like, six straight hours.

406
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,560
God, why does he want to talk to me?

407
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,250
I told him I wanted to switch lab partners.

408
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,770
- What?
- Sorry, nothing personal.

409
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,940
But I just need someone
who's 100% committed.

410
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,540
Wait a second. You told
Madsen I wasn't committed?

411
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,990
You show up late.

412
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,710
Yeah, and you freaked
out when you saw a cadaver.

413
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,900
I didn't go running to Madsen.

414
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,490
That was once, this is a pattern.

415
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,300
You know what? Screw you.

416
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,860
Back up, Carter.

417
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,140
Here we go.

418
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,780
P.B, mini marshmallows, oven-fried
chicken, mac and cheese and pudding.

419
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,960
God, how do I get your diet?

420
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,830
Oh, sorry. That was insensitive.

421
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,990
It's okay.

422
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,950
I... I guess mom is trying
to spark my appetite

423
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,670
by bringing out all my
old childhood favorites.

424
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,540
But... oh, no way.

425
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,770
I'm not hungry.

426
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,130
I don't care.

427
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,630
You are going to eat.

428
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,950
All right, I'll eat...

429
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,000
if you tell me more about Mr. Frenchy.

430
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,320
It's a deal.

431
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,980
You never made it to that winery
you were looking for, did you?

432
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,430
Not that week, no.

433
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,640
Week?

434
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,880
It was amazing.

435
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,900
Stop blocking your face.

436
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,100
You're making me self-conscious.

437
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,030
Your face, it is powerful and soft... like you.

438
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,770
What do you know about me, except
for my inability to read a map?

439
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,050
Your expressions... it tells me many things.

440
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,290
For example... your brow, your jaw...

441
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,500
Sarah, you're a woman who's in control.

442
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,030
You like control.

443
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,220
Your eyes and your smile...

444
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,010
they say something different.

445
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,770
You want to be wild, give in to your impulses.

446
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,260
Did they teach you that at art school?

447
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,980
No. It's something I simply see.

448
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,950
What else do you simply see?

449
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,150
That you're slow to trust.

450
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,600
Maybe a little.

451
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,890
But you want to let go.

452
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,650
Hello.

453
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,610
Hello. Should I come back?

454
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,670
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no, yeah. No, no, no.

455
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,250
- Uh, you'll stay, I'll go.
- No, no, no.

456
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,490
- We'll, uh, continue this tomorrow.
- Oh, tomorrow?

457
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,250
- Keep her hydrated, will you?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks.

458
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,430
No problem. I'll call you tomorrow.

459
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,060
When I'm better, we're going to France.

460
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,850
Wherever you want.

461
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,620
- How's Evan?
- Oh, his... his cold's getting better.

462
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,690
The doctor says he's almost well
enough to be around you.

463
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,390
Oh, good, good. 'Cause I... I really miss him.

464
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:45,390
Tommy. He sent a very nice note.

465
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,630
So how was it?

466
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,410
Uh, it wasn't, uh... it wasn't as
scary as I thought it would be.

467
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,090
And I... I'm definitely nauseated, though.

468
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,820
Here.

469
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,690
- At's that?
- Acupressure.

470
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,650
If I put pressure right on
your palm, it reduces nausea.

471
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,620
How come I never knew about this skill before?

472
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,420
'Cause I just looked it up online.

473
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,010
I'm just... happy to be
able to do something to help.

474
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,530
Are you gonna make me
ask about the press conference?

475
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,650
It went fine.

476
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,080
- Fine?
- Yeah.

477
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,660
That's it?

478
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,480
But you... but you always tell me everything, 

479
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,290
right down to the distracting sheen

480
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,820
on the loaf of some Ted from the Times.

481
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,960
Usually, my wife isn't just
finishing her first round of chemo.

482
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,520
What were the numbers? I bet you're
down with women. What... what are they?

483
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,450
We took a hit.

484
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,930
- But I'm not worried.
- You always worry. That's why you win.

485
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,530
All right, well, this time, I'm gonna win

486
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,170
and I'm not gonna worry. How's that sound?

487
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,060
- Like a lie.
- Come here.

488
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,610
Just leave... California out there.

489
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,490
In here, it's just you and me.

490
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,620
Hey.

491
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,910
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh, what?

492
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,380
You're folding socks.

493
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,890
You only fold socks when you're upset.

494
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,410
Well, we don't have a wedding
venue and my mother and I fought today.

495
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,210
- Oh, well, that sucks.
- Yeah. How was your day?

496
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,780
Remember that oncology
internship I applied for?

497
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,150
Oh, no. You didn't get it?

498
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,130
Oh, that's up in the air, but check this out.

499
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,250
So Carter decides to tell Professor
Madsen that he wants a new lab partner.

500
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,020
- What?
- Yeah. He says I can't handle the workload that I already got.

501
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,960
Doogie thinks you can't hack it?

502
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,760
What a tool.

503
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,140
All right, so what's going
on with the venue things?

504
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,930
I mean, I had no idea that
wedding stuff is so cookie cutter.

505
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,570
- It's just not us.
- All right. So what would make it personal?

506
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,220
Becca, I sure when you were a little girl, you
know, you had plans about your wedding.

507
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,750
Kitty and Sarah used to play bride all the time.

508
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,350
So did Kevin.

509
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,400
Well, I didn't. I mean... I... I mean, it's not like

510
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,730
I had some wedding album of my
mother's to look through, you know?

511
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,220
I... I think you have a defective bride.

512
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,770
Rebecca, I don't have a defective bride... at all.

513
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,040
Well, I don't know. I don't know.

514
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,900
I... I think maybe you should plan the wedding.

515
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,620
Yeah. Well, unless you want
chili dogs and chicken wings

516
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
at a Dodger game, that's probably a bad idea.

517
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,270
How's Kitty?

518
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,330
She's asleep.

519
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,650
Great.

520
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,210
God, she's tough.

521
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,890
According to Sarah, they had fun today.

522
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,250
Good.

523
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,180
I'm glad Sarah's back.

524
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,360
Kitty needs you guys.

525
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,660
How are you holding up?

526
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,070
Good.

527
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,750
So I assume you don't want an update
on the polls, which are still down.

528
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,460
Correct assumption.

529
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,730
Uh, well, let's see, in other important
state matters... oh, yeah, 

530
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,140
Madera county would like your support

531
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,210
in their campaign to change the state bird.

532
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,230
How about the ostrich? They're so cute.

533
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,870
You know, they do that whole
head-burying-in-the-sand thing.

534
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,360
I'm not burying my head in the sand.

535
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,240
Yes, you are. Come on, Robert.

536
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,670
You march into that office and
act like you're working.

537
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,990
- We all know what's going on...
- What do you want from me?

538
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,880
- You do realize, Kitty will not let you quit this campaign?
- I haven't quit.

539
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,400
No, you've stopped running, because
you know if you do nothing, 

540
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,630
your whole campaign will
fall apart on its own, 

541
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,880
and you can tell Kitty you tried your best.

542
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,740
Reality is, you're sabotaging
your chances, and you know it.

543
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,040
Kevin, stay out of it.

544
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,720
Hey, how are you feeling?

545
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,720
Oh, I feel like I want to vomit, and
the deep breaths are not cutting it, 

546
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,030
so please, you need to tell me the end.

547
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,230
It was a vacation romance.

548
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,300
And... like vacations...it ended.

549
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,270
Oh, I know. But just tell me... tell me how.

550
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,740
- Sarah? Are you there?
- Yeah.

551
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,370
You know... he... he wasn't
who I thought he was.

552
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,730
The last day I was there, I went for a walk.

553
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,360
- Sarah...
- Who was that?

554
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,870
- I must explain.
- Don't bother.

555
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,310
I'm so sorry.

556
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,160
You wonder why I don't trust.

557
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,260
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

558
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,110
No, no, wait a... wait a second.

559
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,850
I know this.

560
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,580
You go back to your
car, and it doesn't start.

561
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,750
and then you go back to the farmhouse with
the both of them. It's the movie.

562
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,640
What movie?

563
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
This whole time, you've been telling me

564
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,150
the plot of that French movie

565
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,510
that mom used to love when we were kids.

566
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,050
Okay, you're right. You busted me.

567
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,310
I'm sorry.

568
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,170
You mad at me?

569
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,950
No, I'm not mad.

570
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,870
I'm... you took my mind off of everything.

571
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,560
I'm... I'm just very sad that you didn't get to

572
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,470
have a love affair with a hunky French man.

573
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:59,060
Yeah... me, too.

574
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,760
Hey, where'd you go? I thought
you were next to me the whole time?

575
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,760
Oh. You're not Robert.

576
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,310
He's at the drug store filling a prescription.

577
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,590
But I can sit with you if you
want. That's why I'm here.

578
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,500
Are you allowed to have that?

579
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,000
That blog waright.

580
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,490
Chemo definitely makes the beer taste better.

581
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,740
- Could I?
- Get your own. I have cancer.

582
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,490
So, um... Robert's been getting really beat up

583
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,190
for not suspending his campaign, right?

584
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,160
He told you?

585
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,370
Nope. He didn't have to.

586
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,650
- How bad is it?
- You know what? I wouldn't say that bad.

587
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,120
Well, that's because he won't let you.

588
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,010
But what's the plan?
What's the counter strategy?

589
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,050
Oh, great. You don't have one.

590
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,330
You know what? I'm kinda caught
here between a rock and his wife, 

591
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,490
- so can we just... 
- Oh, you know what? Come on, Kevin.

592
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,240
He's not doing anything.

593
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,570
It's... it's like the rope-a-dope with no plan of

594
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,600
coming off the ropes and
actually throwing any punches.

595
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,470
All right. So what are we gonna do?

596
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,820
Let him suspend... a clean, dignified break.

597
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,650
Why let him limp through a campaign he
doesn't even want to be a part?

598
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,740
All he wants is to be here with you.

599
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,010
Well, too bad. He can't.

600
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,240
Why not? You know, you keep asking
us to keep on living normally.

601
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,980
Well, you know what? People put
things on hold when people are sick.

602
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,010
- No, no, no, we're not gonna put anything on hold...
- Yes, they do. Take care of your wife.

603
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,200
- That's acting normally!
- Because if he quits, and I don't survive this, then what?

604
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,320
Don't... please do not go there, okay?

605
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,210
Well, I have to go there, Kevin.
I don't have a choice.

606
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,650
Now you are either in
denial of who Robert is or

607
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,470
you're in denial of how things
may turn out for me, okay?

608
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,580
If he quits, and I die, then what?

609
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,910
And we're not gonna let that happen.

610
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,180
And you are gonna help me, Kevin,
because Robert needs this, 

611
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,470
- especially if... 
- Please, one condition.

612
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,880
- What?
- No more if... 

613
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,760
You're getting better. That's that.

614
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,150
Okay, fine. I'm getting better.

615
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,080
So how do we help him?

616
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,890
I think I have an idea.

617
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,080
Look, sir, I... I know that going for an internship
right now may not be the best idea, but...

618
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,420
Has someone in your family
been diagnosed with cancer?

619
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,500
Yeah. Um... my sister Kitty.

620
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,010
It's lymphoma, stage III.

621
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,530
- How did... how did you know that...
- Because I've seen this before... 

622
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,000
a... a sudden academic fire, new
found interest in oncology.

623
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,390
I'm sorry.

624
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,900
I... you know, I... I... that's... I'm...
I just want to help somehow.

625
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,120
And there's nothing wrong with that, 

626
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,710
and many of the greatest advances in medicine, 

627
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,890
in every branch of science, has been made

628
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,630
by people who have very personal motives.

629
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:50,260
Then... then why is going for
an internship a bad idea?

630
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,900
Justin, because there is a right way

631
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,140
and a wrong way to go about things.

632
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,700
Taking on so much in your first year, 

633
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,730
and then, God forbid, you fail?

634
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,310
How does that help anybody?

635
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,110
Yeah, you're... you're right. I... I... I get it.

636
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,880
And now... about Carter.

637
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,800
Carter, yeah. He, uh, he
wants a new lab partner.

638
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,270
Well, he is brilliant.

639
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,410
So he tells me.

640
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,310
But he's so afraid of failure that
he can't think straight.

641
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,530
Yeah, well, me, too.

642
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,160
But you have more practical life experience

643
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,630
than any student I've had in years.

644
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,010
And he's had less life than
anyone I've ever met.

645
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,370
So what, you... you want me to get him laid or... 

646
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,460
No, Mr. Walker. I want you
to teach him by example

647
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,370
how to get along with people in the real world.

648
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,310
Yeah, I... yeah, I c... I can do that.

649
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:46,140
Good. And look, someday you may
become an extraordinary oncologist, 

650
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,990
able to help people like your sister.

651
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:50,210
But every journey starts with the first step.

652
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,350
And in this case, the first step is the hand.

653
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,960
Start with the hand.

654
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,630
I left my cell phone in the car.

655
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,550
I'm surprised that you
wanted to meet me here.

656
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,600
- No, I... I asked you because I wanted your opinion.
- Yeah.

657
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,030
But, uh, I also really need to
apologize. I'm... I'm sorry.

658
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,540
I... I was frustrated, and
I took it out on you, 

659
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,360
and I shouldn't have.

660
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,900
I promise I won't be all bridezilla

661
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,460
for the rest of the wedding planning.

662
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,030
You weren't that bad.

663
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,820
And I'm sure it was really annoying, 

664
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,660
me picking up the phone all the time.

665
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,440
No, no. Is everything okay?

666
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,750
Yeah. Everything is great now.

667
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,090
I got enough juice that

668
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,640
we can start production on our new blend.

669
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,150
- That's great.
- It's great.

670
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,820
But today is about you and your wedding.

671
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,160
So what do you think about this place?

672
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,480
Mom.

673
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,450
Is it me, or do all of these places suck?

674
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,450
No, you're right.

675
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,410
None of these places have
been right for you and Justin.

676
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,620
So let's just take a step back, all right?

677
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,060
Okay, so now when you
think about your wedding, 

678
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,340
what do you picture?

679
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,860
I don't have a picture.

680
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,500
I mean, where was I when
all of these little girls

681
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,000
were staging fake weddings in their bedrooms?

682
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,510
Outside in the backyard
splashing in the mud and

683
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,540
- begging meto let you stay outfor five more minutes, please, mommy.
- I remember.

684
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,430
You would stay out as long as I would let you.

685
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,990
You and that stuffed dolphin that I got
you at Sea World, running through the ferns.

686
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,130
- Awoka-woka.
- Awoka-what?

687
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,480
- Awoka-woka. That's it.
- What?

688
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,120
Mom, I... I think I know where
we should get married.

689
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,620
Great.

690
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,410
Thank you.

691
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,060
If you're not up for company,
I could come back.

692
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,140
No, no, I am. Come on in.

693
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,360
How are you feeling?

694
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,720
I'm tired, but, you know, 
I'm actually not that bad.

695
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,410
Good. Or not good.

696
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,810
No, I... it's good.

697
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,970
Mom, are you... are you
angry about yesterday?

698
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,120
No. I am... over it.

699
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,270
Whatever it was, I'm over it.

700
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,650
You're the one that knows what's best for you, 

701
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,730
and whatever you want or don't want... 

702
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,470
just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

703
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,370
Mom, you're already doing it.

704
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,760
I feel like I'm not doing enough.

705
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,990
Well, you can't cure me.

706
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,490
I wish I could pull every bit of that cancer

707
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,760
out of you and put it in me instead.

708
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,180
I wish it were me.

709
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,900
I know. That's why I couldn't have
you with me yesterday.

710
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,890
I didn't want to put you through that, 

711
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,900
and... and besides, if you cry, I cry.

712
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,970
Did Sarah do okay?

713
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, Sarah... Sarah did great.

714
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,370
- Just... aah.
- What?

715
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,560
No, it's just this... this, uh, injection
site is just pretty sore.

716
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,000
I don't know. Dr. Avadon said they're
gonna maybe put in a chest catheter.

717
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,910
It makes it easier.

718
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,240
I don't want to cry.

719
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,760
It's okay.

720
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,590
You can cry.

721
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,610
Are you at a good place to take a break?

722
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,080
Sure, if you can help me remember
the erector spinae muscles.

723
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,110
There's iliocostalis, uh, longissimus, spinalis.

724
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,910
I'm just trying to get a head
start on next week's work.

725
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,420
I.L.S. I love sex.

726
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,060
Erector. Sex.

727
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah. I'm into that.

728
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,410
I got it. I.L.S.

729
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,290
What... what's
going on?

730
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,960
Okay, um, so you know how you said that, 

731
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,330
you know, little girls play bride?

732
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,540
Well, I... I didn't.

733
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,110
But I did play the isle of awoka-woka.

734
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,230
I would go outside with
my little stuffed animal... 

735
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,550
bradmore... this little dolphin, 

736
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,740
and we'd great strand... on a deserted island.

737
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,270
But instead of... instead of
being sad, we would be happy, 

738
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,440
because, you know, there were palm trees

739
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,720
and tiki torches and... and coconut desserts, 

740
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,970
and it was just... it was perfect.

741
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,360
And it was everything that I ever wanted

742
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,790
on this... this little island.

743
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,190
Please tell me this means a wedding in Hawaii.

744
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,360
- Oh, I love that.
- Yeah?

745
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,770
- I love that.
- Yeah? I mean, you can surf.

746
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,980
Uh-oh. Maybe a little bit of this?

747
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,290
- Yeah.
- A little of that.

748
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,700
- A little hula dancing.
- Yeah.

749
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,570
- A little bit of this.
- Look at your spinalis!

750
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,820
What do you say to people that think

751
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,900
that Robert should suspend his campaign?

752
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,990
Well, I would say that that would be

753
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,390
a real tragedy for the people of California.

754
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,100
California needs Robert McCallister.

755
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,190
And he will be there for us.

756
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,960
He'll be there for all of us.

757
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,970
You know, Robert needs
to continue to fight his battle

758
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,140
just like I need to continue to fight mine.

759
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,800
And I don't think you'll find either
one of us cowering in the corner.

760
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,540
- What is this?
- Your polls going up. Her idea.

761
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,990
I also truly believe that Robert has

762
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:36,590
this uncanny ability to stay focused...

763
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,230
even when he needs to
make hard judgments.

764
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,910
You seem well, Kitty, and I mean
you sound incredibly positive in

765
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,410
light of this difficult situation.

766
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,440
How do you achieve that?

767
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,180
With a lot of help.

768
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:55,550
I am surrounded by... by
so much love and support.

769
00:37:55,550 --> 00:38:00,230
Ever since my diagnosis, my
husband, my mother, my siblings... 

770
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:05,320
everybody has really...
really rallied around me.

771
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,260
Hey, mom. It's so funny you called.

772
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,130
I was just in this gorgeous patisserie.

773
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,480
They had those little pastries you love.

774
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,450
She's got what?

775
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,360
Oh, my...

776
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:07,160
I'll be home tomorrow. Okay.

777
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,910
Sarah. What's wrong?

778
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,620
It's my sister. I've gotta go home.

779
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,130
I've gotta go. I'm sorry.

780
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,570
Sarah.

781
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,310
Thank you for speaking
with us today, Kitty.

782
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:22,130
Well, thank you. It's my pleasure.

783
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:25,730
that was pundit and blogger Kitty McCallister, 

784
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:29,370
the wife of Senator Robert McCallister, talking...

785
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,710
I thought we had an arrangement.

786
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,110
Which one was that?

787
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,000
That you we gonna concentrate on getting
well and leave the campaigning to me.

788
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,320
Right, right. But you weren't
holding up your end of the bargain.

789
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,930
It's not healthy for you.

790
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,640
You need to ignore it.

791
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,760
Well, then you need
to allow me to ignore it.

792
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,350
Stop throwing the game.

793
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:52,270
That's your... your plan, right?

794
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,240
I'd still be a senator.

795
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,140
I just wouldn't be in the
middle of this campaign.

796
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,530
No, I know what this is about.

797
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:04,700
This is about us. This is
about... this about us... before.

798
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,150
What if I'm not that guy anymore?

799
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,590
What if I don't want it at any cost?

800
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,300
Because I know that you are the
most important thing to me.

801
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,920
And I didn't know that before.

802
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,390
And I... I'm ashamed of that.

803
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,300
Honey... you don't owe me anything.

804
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,280
Yes, I do.

805
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,870
Well, then you can't stop being an example.

806
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,760
What do you mean?

807
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,180
You never give up.

808
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,960
I don't want you to give up now.

809
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,320
Please.

810
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,230
All right.

811
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,340
Just a second.

812
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,990
Pardon me. I lost.

813
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,970
I was wondering if you could help me.

814
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,580
Oh, my God.
