1
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,000
Get ready for yard.

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,167
Get ready for yard.

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,709
- Fuck you!
- What's his name again?

4
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,335
Fabrizio.

5
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,606
He's some
kind of tough guy, man.

6
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,613
Ready for yard, gentlemen.

7
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,576
Gangway!

8
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,121
Yard line.

9
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,326
- Come on, let's bail out.
- Gangway! Move it!

10
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:03,328
Move out!

11
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,183
Go in and out, man! In and out!

12
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:35,956
I ain't even sweating you, man!

13
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:40,864
Fuck 'em up, man!
Come on, feed me, man!

14
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,094
Fuck you!

15
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,713
Always good!

16
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,676
You're just a little punk, baby.

17
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,921
The morning it all began,

18
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,356
began like any other morning.

19
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,764
Oh! Oh, Bernie.

20
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,167
Dad, I need lunch money
and a note for gym.

21
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,610
And you promised to help me
with my book report, remember?

22
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,658
The author devotes a lot of time
to developing the characters,

23
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,921
and he seduces the reader by...

24
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,692
- Seduces?
- Yeah. He, uh, draws you in, you know?

25
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:22,735
- You wanna know how it ends.
- But I already knew how it ended.

26
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:25,134
OK, so write it was predictable.

27
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,174
- No, Dad, I mean I've seen the movie.
- Oh. Right.

28
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,538
Come on. You got to eat.

29
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,668
Can't you think of another word?

30
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,542
"Intrigues."

31
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,048
"Intrigues." Thanks, Mom.

32
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:39,050
You're smarter than Dad, you know that?

33
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:40,710
Yes, God help us if he finds out.

34
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,984
If Mom's so smart, maybe she
should help you with your book report.

35
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,045
See what I mean?

36
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:48,287
- I have a meeting, Dee.
- Yeah, I have meetings too.

37
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,555
Amy, your book report, your call.
Me or him?

38
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:53,860
I choose option C
where you two get me a tutor.

39
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:57,265
- Yep. We've been through this.

40
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,634
Oh, jeez.

41
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,401
- Where is it?
- It's over there.

42
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,876
It's the hospital.

43
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,414
- Yep?
- Is this Mr. Schine?

44
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,472
Speaking.

45
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,781
I need to know
if Amy's levels have changed.

46
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,754
- No. No, the levels are the same.
- We need the latest results.

47
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,257
Yep.

48
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:21,519
I'll fax it over when I get to work.

49
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:22,959
Thanks.

50
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:25,988
You going to the ATM?

51
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,271
- Who wants to live forever, right?
- You have to stay positive.

52
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,637
- At least it's not going up.
- It's not going down, either, though.

53
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:36,766
Positive.

54
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,377
Amy, your bus'll be here soon.

55
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,110
Bye.

56
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,651
Bernie, you stay here.

57
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:49,346
You used to kiss each other
goodbye in the mornings.

58
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,350
Shut up.

59
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,586
Come on.

60
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:58,495
The author intrigues the reader

61
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,326
by twisting the narrative

62
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:03,098
so you never know what's coming next.

63
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,000
How's that?

64
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,629
It's all right.

65
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:16,814
The train on platform two
is the 7:50 Red Line service

66
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,281
to Chicago Central.

67
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,947
Calling at Central Street, Davis Street,
Main Street, Rogers Park,

68
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:26,822
Ravenswood, Clybourn
and Chicago Central.

69
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,047
Ticket.

70
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,711
Oh, shit.

71
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:57,449
- I meant to get one at the station.
- Nine dollars.

72
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:02,851
- Oh, gee. This is embarrassing.
- And it's only Monday.

73
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:06,420
My wife, she, uh, emptied my wallet
when she left for work this morning.

74
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,228
Oh, so it's the wife's fault, is it?

75
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,791
- Yeah. I'm trying to explain.
- It's nine dollars.

76
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,531
Pay up or get off at the next stop.

77
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:15,204
It's that simple.

78
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,468
- I'll pay for him.
- What?

79
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,408
No, no. You don't have to do that.

80
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,038
Don't worry about it.

81
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,514
One lucky guy.

82
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:32,319
No, really. It's my fault.

83
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,382
It's all right. I paid, didn't I?

84
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,619
Here you go. Thank you very much.

85
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,238
Thank you.

86
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:51,742
Just so you know,
it wasrt an act or anything.

87
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,870
It was a shameless act,
and I'm a born sucker.

88
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:57,437
Just drop it.

89
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:00,644
- I don't want you to think...
- OK. I don't.

90
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:10,526
I mean, there's an ATM
at Union if you're getting off there.

91
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,257
Tomorrow is fine.

92
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:22,264
Of course, there is a ten percent
interest charge overnight.

93
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,975
- Interest charge.
- Plus the handling fee.

94
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,637
Ouch.

95
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,839
Never met a woman loan shark before.

96
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:32,713
- You break legs too?
- Just balls.

97
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,946
Oh. You're a lawyer.

98
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,182
I'm a financial advisor.

99
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:38,449
I cheat clients.

100
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,288
I'm a commercial executive.

101
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,555
I con housewives.

102
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,617
Where do you work?

103
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,762
JMD/March. It's a midsize place.

104
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,064
We've got some
semi-decent accounts. You?

105
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,970
Avery Price. It's a big place.

106
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,564
We don't do semi-decent accounts.

107
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,951
- This your usual train?
- Why?

108
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:10,011
- So I'll know how to pay you back.
- Nine dollars. I think I'll survive.

109
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,454
No, I gotta give it back.

110
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,788
I'd feel ethically impugned if I didn't.

111
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:17,252
Impugned?

112
00:08:19,464 --> 00:08:21,797
Well, I wouldn't want you
to feel impugned.

113
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:52,227
So... if you take the same train
tomorrow, I'll pay you back.

114
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,158
It's a date.

115
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,808
Morning.

116
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:13,078
- Hey.
- What up, Chaz?

117
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,144
Ooh, yo, I got a good one for you.

118
00:09:16,221 --> 00:09:18,918
Seven players, 40-plus home runs,

119
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,721
with 11 letters in their last names.

120
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:25,024
- Yastrzemski.
- Yastrzemski.

121
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,360
- You got to spell that for me.
- Morning, Charles.

122
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:32,495
Y- A-S-T-R-Z-E-M-S-K-I.

123
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,630
Barry, I need a cash check.

124
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:35,900
How much and what for?

125
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,568
12,000. Location fee
for the Amerispend One shoot.

126
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,134
Don't forget to sign
the receipt this time.

127
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:44,182
- For you, Barry, I'll sign it in blood.
- Heard that.

128
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,480
OK, that's one. I need six more.

129
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,042
Um...

130
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,451
- Petrocelli.
- Petrocelli?

131
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,720
- Oh, Charles. Eliot's looking for you.
- P-E-T-R-O...

132
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:57,625
Oh, come on, yo.
That's only ten letters.

133
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,028
What else you got?

134
00:09:59,097 --> 00:10:02,192
Come on, Chaz,
you got 'em all last week. I need this.

135
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,599
Oh, gee.

136
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,899
All right, Winston,
any of these guys National Leaguers?

137
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:10,431
I thought it was Major League or Minor
League. What's the National League?

138
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,341
- You don't follow baseball?
- No. Hockey's my game.

139
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,176
- More gore, less bore.
- Where'd you get the questions from?

140
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,772
This cop I know gives 'em to me.

141
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,317
Actually, he's like my uncle.

142
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,409
He's obsessed. Loves challenging me.

143
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:23,716
Said if I get it right, I get 100 bucks,

144
00:10:23,788 --> 00:10:25,688
and you know I gots
to make that money.

145
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,692
Wait. You don't know the answers?

146
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,990
No. Duh.
That's why I come to you, Chaz.

147
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,053
Where you been? You're late.

148
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,894
- Come on.
- Sorry.

149
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:38,163
This is not a lady
who likes to wait, you know.

150
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:40,837
Susan.

151
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,270
- Charles.
- Hi.

152
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:47,071
I guess you're here
to raise our commission, eh?

153
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,703
We have some issues.

154
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,272
We feel like no matter
how much we talk to you,

155
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,318
we just don't get heard by you people.

156
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,548
This last commercial
is a case in point.

157
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:59,591
We agreed on a strategy.
We signed off on it.

158
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,057
Then what happened?

159
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,729
You went off
in all these other directions.

160
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,961
The cut you sent us, it's nothing
like how we said it should be.

161
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,663
Look, Susan, the directions
I took were, you know...

162
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:14,899
I've been doing this for ten years, OK?

163
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:21,701
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,679
I'll do it however it is
you want it done.

165
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,947
The time for apologies is over.

166
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,284
What we need now is change.

167
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,889
You don't want me on the account?

168
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:41,260
Uh, Susan appreciates all you've done.

169
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,129
You have different visions.

170
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,408
You might have backed me up in there.

171
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:03,455
Backed you up!
Susan Davis is a $130 million client.

172
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,785
- She's a bitch.
- She's the worst kind of bitch.

173
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,985
She has a point. You're in a rut,
my friend, and you know it.

174
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,821
Forget Susan Davis.

175
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,163
Get a new account, get back
on your feet, back to what you do best.

176
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:19,661
Goddamn it.

177
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,936
Talk to me, tell me what's going on,
maybe I can help.

178
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,804
Impugned.

179
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:26,936
That's a word, isn't it?

180
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,488
Shut up, Bernie.
I live here. Amy, please!

181
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:39,023
Bernie, cut it out.

182
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,293
- You're late.
- Sorry.

183
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:45,192
How was work?

184
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,994
Work was...

185
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,626
...fine. You?

186
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,938
Guess who's decided
to monitor me this week?

187
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:57,874
- Ethan Jeffries.
- Oh. The asshole.

188
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:01,207
He always throws a fit
when I stray from the lesson plan.

189
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,975
There's a lot of that going around.

190
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,207
So, what did I do?

191
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,081
Handed out an English composition
in the math hour today.

192
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,916
He chew you out in front of the kids?

193
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,719
The title for the composition
was "Why We Like Principal Jeffries."

194
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,817
Uh, Jerry called.
There's a message on the machine.

195
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,158
Where you going?

196
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,666
I have a PTA meeting.
It's been on the calendar for six weeks.

197
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,963
Right.

198
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,299
Amy needs to be quizzed
for her history test,

199
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,340
and Bernie needs to pee.

200
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,903
Name the act that banned alcohol.

201
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,846
Volstead Act.

202
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,043
- What year?
- 1919.

203
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,610
- Huh?
- 1919.

204
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:46,817
Yeah. Do you think we can turn
this down a notch below deafening?

205
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,254
Amy!

206
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:52,053
OK.

207
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,405
How long...?

208
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,453
- How long did Prohibition last?
- Fourteen years.

209
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,414
Pay up, buster.

210
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:29,919
Hey.

211
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,683
I looked for you.

212
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,246
Yeah, right. Gimme my money.

213
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,985
Really. I did.

214
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,527
- Is that your daughter?
- Yeah.

215
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:42,158
- Amy.
- Oh.

216
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,099
Mine's a few years younger.

217
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:47,036
- What's her name?
- Amber.

218
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,705
- Oh, she's adorable.
- Yeah.

219
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,405
They make it all won'th it, don't they?

220
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,294
Nice briefcase.

221
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,853
It was a gift... from my wife.

222
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:16,923
Oh, jeez. Guess I should
get one for my husband, huh?

223
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:24,001
"If lost, please return
to Charles Christopher Schine."

224
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,909
Charles Christopher Schine.
Isn't Schine a Jewish name?

225
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,449
- Rabbinically.
- Christopher Schine.

226
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,509
My mom was Catholic.
I got all kinds of guilt.

227
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,554
Oh. How's that working out for you?

228
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,613
Fine. I had a lot of therapy
when I was a kid.

229
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,853
- You're kinda funny, aren't you?
- You're an easy crowd.

230
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:46,558
- What's your name?
- Lucinda.

231
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,429
Lucinda Harris.

232
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,236
So we came here when I was little,
just me and my mom.

233
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,569
- We were only gonna stay a year.
- Mm-hm.

234
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,738
- How about you?
- Oh, all over.

235
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:03,474
I was an Army brat.
I grew up everywhere and nowhere.

236
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:05,413
My address changed every six months,

237
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:07,179
and so did my best friend.

238
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,618
But, then again, I got to change too.

239
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,682
If I screwed up in Fort Hood, Texas,

240
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:17,354
they didn't have to know about it
in Saratoga, New York.

241
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,624
I could just be this whole other person.

242
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,189
That happen a lot? You screwing up?

243
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,961
Mm-hm. Yep.

244
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,435
I was the consummate rebel
against authority.

245
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,837
- Oh, is that what you called it?
- No, that's what my parents called it.

246
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:31,204
I called it getting lit.

247
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:36,681
But then I got my act together
when I got out of school,

248
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,342
and Dad really wanted a lawyer.

249
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,045
He settled for a banker.

250
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,317
The next stop
is Chicago Union Station.

251
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,357
This is the end of the Red Line.

252
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:50,223
All passengers,
please disembark at this time.

253
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,522
Thank you.

254
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,155
Busy day?

255
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:56,792
Oh, in finance, every day is a busy day.

256
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:00,236
Oh, I bet you're getting a lot of angry
calls with an economy like this.

257
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,240
Well, if you consider
death threats angry.

258
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:04,400
Tell me about it.

259
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,740
Clients, they love you
when times are good...

260
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:10,144
No, no, no, when times are good,
you never make them enough money.

261
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,183
There's always some cousin
or brother or grandmother

262
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:16,688
whose stock split 64 ways,
and why can't you sell 'em one of those,

263
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,814
like I got some
crystal ball or something.

264
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,358
Tell me about it.
I got fired off my biggest account.

265
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:24,554
My boss didn't even warn me.
Supposed to be a good friend of mine.

266
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,792
That bastard.
Do you want me to yell at him for you?

267
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:30,163
Give me his number,
I'll crank-call him.

268
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:38,201
Some people just don't know how
to appreciate what they've got.

269
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,065
Morning, Charles.

270
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,480
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,416
- What up, Chaz?
- Hey.

272
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,891
You all right?
You look a little sick in the face,

273
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,553
- like you got the bug.
- No.

274
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:33,461
- It ain't contagious, is it?
- It's nothing.

275
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,160
- That's what Dick Lembergh said.
- Who's Dick Lembergh?

276
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,395
Ain't nobody now.
That motherfucker dead.

277
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,266
Winston.

278
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,568
Come here. Let me ask you something.

279
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,472
- This about the computers?
- No, no.

280
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,174
I appreciate what you did for me.

281
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,276
Forget about it. Buy me a beer sometime.
This is something else.

282
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,819
Go ahead. Shoot for it.

283
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,525
Say you went to the movies,
but you forgot your money,

284
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,857
and someone offered
to buy your ticket for you.

285
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,830
- In Chicago?
- I'm just saying, hypothetically.

286
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:11,096
It's only right
to talk to them, isn't it?

287
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,934
I mean, thank them.
Show you appreciate it somehow, right?

288
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,237
This full price or matinee?

289
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:20,142
That's the difference
between five or ten bucks, man.

290
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,337
You know what?

291
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,674
Never mind.

292
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,142
Hey, yo. I asked that cop
about those questions,

293
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,481
and three other players
were National League.

294
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,884
I'm still working on that.

295
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:33,117
I need those answers
by tomorrow to get that moola, baby.

296
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,718
- We're cool about the computers, right?
- Yes, Winston. We're cool.

297
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,784
Chaz.

298
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,763
We're cool about the computers, right?

299
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,445
Avery Price.

300
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,454
- Lucinda.
- You mean Lucinda Harris?

301
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:06,787
Yeah. Could you tell her
it's Charles Schine?

302
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:09,155
I'll put you through to her office.

303
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,828
- Charles.
- Hey.

304
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:19,559
We have this beautiful house
in Lake Forest,

305
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:22,231
just the kind of house
I dreamed about as a kid.

306
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,865
What's your husband do?

307
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,909
- He golfs.
- For a living?

308
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,172
He wishes.

309
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:31,078
No, he's a broker. We met at Stanford.

310
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:35,278
He's up at 3am so he can be
in the offices when London opens.

311
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,116
We also have an apartment in the city.

312
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,713
He stays there during the week
to avoid the commute,

313
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,759
and of course,
the weekends are for golf.

314
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,351
So when do you see each other?

315
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,028
The usuals.

316
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:48,895
Birthdays, Christmases.

317
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,697
We communicate mainly via Hallmark.

318
00:22:52,403 --> 00:22:56,807
But hey, I have a beautiful,
wonderful baby girl, so there.

319
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:19,028
Deanna!

320
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,565
Amy. Amy!

321
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,656
Can you hear me?

322
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,166
Can you hear me, sweetheart?

323
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,964
Breathe. Breathe, Amy.

324
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,368
Breathe. There you go.

325
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,505
Daddy's here. It's OK.

326
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,143
Everything's OK. Daddy's here.

327
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:38,010
There you go.

328
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,380
There you go, sweetheart.

329
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:41,749
Stay with me.

330
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,650
There you go. There you go.

331
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:50,623
It's OK, sweetheart. It's OK.

332
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:52,184
Shh.

333
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:55,164
Amy. There you go.

334
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,064
- It's all right, baby.
- There you go.

335
00:24:00,404 --> 00:24:03,169
- Diabetes?
- Type 1. Worst kind.

336
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,299
We took out
a second mortgage on the house

337
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,709
to get her one of those
mobile dialysis machines

338
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:10,576
so she doesn't have to go
to the hospital every day.

339
00:24:10,648 --> 00:24:13,584
Can't they, um...?
Can't they give her a new kidney?

340
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,619
They have. Three times.

341
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:18,154
Her body keeps rejecting them.

342
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:22,922
There's this new anti-rejection drug
coming out, supposed to be amazing.

343
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:25,690
Has to be approved,
but they say it's got a 99 percent rate

344
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:27,959
- of success in the tests so far.
- Expensive?

345
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:30,398
Like you wouldn't believe.

346
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,993
And, of course,
insurance won't cover it.

347
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,335
Sure. Probably cheaper
to let her suffer, right?

348
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,340
We're OK.

349
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,969
We've been saving for years.

350
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,537
So now we just sit around
and wait for the call.

351
00:24:49,753 --> 00:24:52,382
Hi. Amy, don't let Bernie out.

352
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,684
Hey. You home?

353
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,588
Yeah, just now. What's wrong?

354
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,355
I just got out of Eliot's office.

355
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,364
He slammed me
with some big new account.

356
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:04,367
I'm gonna be home late,
so, uh, don't wait up.

357
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:08,372
All right. How come you're
calling from your cell phone?

358
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,873
Amy, your bag's in the back.

359
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,703
I don't know.

360
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,644
I'm just down the hall and wanted
to let you know as soon as possible.

361
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,704
Thanks.

362
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:20,114
I'm sorry.
It's been kind of hectic lately.

363
00:25:20,184 --> 00:25:22,278
Um, I gotta go.

364
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,321
All right. See ya.

365
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:25,913
Bye.

366
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,821
Yeah. All right, honey.

367
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:50,872
Excuse me.

368
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,075
Same again?

369
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,049
I'm drinking you under the bar, mister.

370
00:25:54,118 --> 00:25:55,643
- Really?
- Yeah.

371
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,654
- I bet I can do it in three drinks.
- You like to gamble?

372
00:25:58,722 --> 00:26:01,351
It's not really gambling
when you never lose.

373
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:03,326
- I got a bet.
- Really?

374
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,453
I'll bet you $20

375
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,227
that I can kiss you
without ever touching your lips.

376
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,894
- Kiss me?
- Without touching.

377
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:13,496
How?

378
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,506
What do you mean, how?
That's the bet.

379
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,439
OK. Let me see the 20.

380
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:47,767
Worth every penny.

381
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,667
What are we doing?

382
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:55,709
I've never done this before.

383
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,372
Me neither.

384
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,008
All the years I've been married,
never lied to my husband.

385
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,314
Not once.

386
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:04,979
Bartender! Johnny Walker Black Label,
no ice, please.

387
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,115
- Excuse us, please.
- Oh, there she is. Hello, beautiful.

388
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:09,955
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I have a drink.

389
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,518
Can I buy you the bar then?

390
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,654
Do yourself a favor, buy a better line.

391
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:15,722
Excuse me, we're talking here.

392
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,961
No, buddy, we were talking,
you were just...

393
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,833
You were standing looking like a fag.

394
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:22,236
- OK, Charles...
- Charles, you run along.

395
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,365
The lady and I are gonna get acquainted.

396
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,410
- Where you going?
- Get your hands off me.

397
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,571
Fine. Relax. You stupid whore.

398
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:33,614
Take it easy, buddy.

399
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,853
Can we get some ice, please?

400
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,096
Taxi!

401
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,602
Taxi!

402
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:32,075
- That one?
- No. My husband meets clients there.

403
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,212
Hey, how about that one?

404
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,050
- You OK?
- Yeah.

405
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:53,426
- Stop the cab, please.
- Sure, lady.

406
00:28:56,934 --> 00:29:00,028
I can't, Charles. I'm sorry.

407
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,233
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, buddy.

408
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,667
Good luck with her.

409
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,281
I know, I know.

410
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,016
- How much for a room?
- Forty-six dollars.

411
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,188
You want to use the hotel safe?
It's an extra ten.

412
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:01,356
No, just the room, please.

413
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,634
It's that way.

414
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:23,011
...45 minutes waiting
for you to come upstairs.

415
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:24,884
I was stressed. I had a drink.

416
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,355
What do you mean,
stressed, a drink?

417
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,923
What about me? What about me?

418
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,057
Just shut the fuck up!
What is wrong with you?

419
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:40,298
I won't shut the fuck up.
It is 3:00 in the morning.

420
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,371
Beautiful.

421
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,384
So, what do you think?

422
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,999
You wanna stay, or you wanna go?

423
00:32:29,212 --> 00:32:31,203
I don't know.

424
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:40,846
I think, um...

425
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:45,924
I think I wanna fuck you.

426
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:35,003
You make one sound,
I'll blow your fucking heads apart.

427
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,306
Shh!

428
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:42,338
Always...

429
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,213
...chain your door in a place like this.

430
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,411
But, hey, thanks for the invite.

431
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,918
I'll give you all my money.

432
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:54,181
"No sound" means you shut the fuck up.

433
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,726
- Please don't hurt him.
- You get that?

434
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,954
Give me your fucking wallets now.

435
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,391
Come on, give me your wallet.
Come on, come on.

436
00:35:12,742 --> 00:35:15,233
This doesn't look like her...

437
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,677
...Charlie.

438
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,608
Hmm.

439
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:29,458
That stupid fuck
doesn't look like you, neither.

440
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:34,755
Lucinda.
You two fucking around, huh?

441
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,458
Slumming it, ain't ya?

442
00:35:39,202 --> 00:35:41,467
You're fucking slumming it,
you piece of shit.

443
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,097
Isn't that exciting?

444
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:45,505
Please, just take the money.

445
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,110
Chuck, I already took your money.

446
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:52,876
You see this? This was your money,
and I took it. Now it's mine.

447
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:55,543
- I promise we won't go to the police.
- I know you won't

448
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,248
'cause you look like a nice guy.
Ain't you a nice guy?

449
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,914
You look nice to me.

450
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,516
She looks kinda nice. Are you nice?

451
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,063
Lucinda.

452
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,759
Oh! No!

453
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,269
- Let her go, please.
- Come on, come on.

454
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,199
- Please.
- How can I let her go,

455
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:18,036
such a fine piece of ass like that?

456
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,465
Look at that.

457
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:24,842
Me and fucking Lucinda,
we gotta do a lot of things together.

458
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,213
All kinds of shit.

459
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,483
Oh, man.

460
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,487
I could make you scream, you know?

461
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:32,750
Is she better than
your wife at home? Ha.

462
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,356
Look at that.

463
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:42,565
Aah!

464
00:36:42,632 --> 00:36:44,190
What'd you say, Charlie?

465
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:48,161
I can fuck her? Well, thanks... Charlie.

466
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,206
I knew you were a nice guy.

467
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:56,072
Whoa! Where you going, Lucinda?

468
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:59,081
You gonna take it from him,
or you gonna go for a whole lot more?

469
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,963
Shh!

470
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,556
Check this out, Charlie.

471
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,431
Championship fucking, right here.

472
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,527
- Twelve rounder.
- No.

473
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,608
Aah!

474
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,541
- Oh, please.
- Shut up!

475
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:33,744
- Yeah, you don't wanna miss this.
- No!

476
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:48,596
Please. No, please. Please.

477
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,264
Hey, Chuck, fuck her like that.

478
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,371
Come on, Chuck. Don't fail me, man.

479
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:02,605
Round four coming up.

480
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,452
No, stop, please!

481
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,773
I'll take you to a hospital.

482
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,822
I'm so sorry.

483
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,972
I'll call the police.

484
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:40,833
No. No.

485
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,603
We... We gotta give a description.

486
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,273
Stop. Stop it.

487
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,389
No.

488
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:00,088
The police are gonna wanna know
what we were doing here.

489
00:40:01,865 --> 00:40:04,164
So we tell them.

490
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,793
We have to.

491
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,262
Can't.

492
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,237
Oh, my God, my family.

493
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,780
Well, what do you want me to do?

494
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,715
Tell me what to do.

495
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,422
I just want you to get me out of here.

496
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:00,717
55 East Erie, please.

497
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,784
Holy shit, Chaz.

498
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:37,487
- Oh, my God!
- Looks like you got hit by a train.

499
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:43,065
I'm OK. I'm fine.

500
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:46,329
- I just had a little accident.
- What the hell happened?

501
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:50,163
- I got mugged.
- Jesus.

502
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,777
I've just been to the hospital. Doctor
said I'm good. No permanent damage.

503
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:57,507
- You get a look at this guy, Chaz?
- No.

504
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,213
You call the police?

505
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,719
They're gonna call me
if my wallet turns up.

506
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,847
Maybe you oughta go home.
Did you call Deanna?

507
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,393
Yeah.

508
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,929
There's just, um,
a couple of things I gotta do.

509
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:16,454
Um... cancel my credit cards.

510
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,398
- Call the DMV.
- Charles.

511
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,527
Don't be stupid.

512
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,536
Go home. OK?

513
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,307
Goddamn city.

514
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:37,353
I hate it.

515
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,914
I work in the city, Dee.

516
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,221
I can'tjust quit my job.
What would I do?

517
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,760
You could teach again.

518
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,853
You used to be a great teacher.

519
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,661
My job is what allows us
to save for Amy's drugs.

520
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:53,293
How do we do that
on a pair of teachers' salaries?

521
00:42:53,369 --> 00:42:54,701
We could sell the house.

522
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:57,900
We've already got
two mortgages on the house.

523
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:00,000
Selling it doesn't do us any good.

524
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:03,175
Mom?

525
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,010
Yeah. Hi, sweetie.

526
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:18,824
Deanna, can you get that?

527
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:23,630
- Dee!
- Excuse me.

528
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,168
Just give me a minute.

529
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:34,969
Yeah.

530
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,807
Hey, Charlie.

531
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,317
Charlie? Can you hear me?

532
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,684
- What do you want? How did...?
- Well, how's your busted nose?

533
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:47,882
- Still hurting?
- Why are you calling me?

534
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:52,054
Just checking out if you were keeping
your promise about the police and all.

535
00:43:52,128 --> 00:43:55,097
'Cause after all,
a promise is a promise, huh?

536
00:43:55,164 --> 00:43:57,291
- Hello?
- I got it. It's business.

537
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:00,530
A business call. Honey, for God's sake.

538
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:01,764
Excuse me. Who's this?

539
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:03,568
Well, this is Mr. LaRoche.

540
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,666
Mr. LaRoche,
my husband's had a rough day.

541
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:07,835
- Can this wait?
- What happened?

542
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,971
- He was mugged.
- Charles, I had no idea.

543
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:13,675
Please, I'm sorry.
Why didn't you tell me so?

544
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:17,083
Honey, can you hang up, please?

545
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:18,643
OK, hon.

546
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:22,920
So you haven't told her. Huh? Have you?

547
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:26,429
You haven't told your wife
you're fucking Lucinda.

548
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:28,829
You listen to me, you fucking asshole!

549
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:31,059
You go near her again,
I swear to God...

550
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,864
I need a loan, Charlie.

551
00:44:33,936 --> 00:44:36,268
I really hate to ask,
but I'm a little short,

552
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,706
and since you canceled
your credit cards, well,

553
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,766
you know what? I need 20,000.

554
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,778
That's ridiculous. I don't have 20,000.

555
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,873
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
you're a big fucking executive.

556
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:49,282
I don't have that kind
of cash just lying around.

557
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,844
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, man, I just
don't give a shit about your cash flow.

558
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:55,721
I want 20,000 now, you hear me?

559
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,353
OK, OK. I'll get it.

560
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,487
What'll you get?

561
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:01,291
I want to hear it because, you know,

562
00:45:01,364 --> 00:45:04,231
my English is not very good.

563
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,235
I'll get you the 20,000.

564
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:08,635
OK.
Well, thank you, Charlie.

565
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,367
Corner of Western
and Parkway, noon, Friday.

566
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,244
- Don't ever call me at home again...
- Au revoir, Charlie.

567
00:45:26,155 --> 00:45:28,021
Hey.

568
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,855
You OK?

569
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,920
I haven't seen you
on the train all week.

570
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:39,527
I've called in sick the whole week.

571
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:42,163
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

572
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:45,599
- So he called you.
- I think we should go to the police.

573
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:50,510
No! No, Charles.
You're not understanding me.

574
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,708
If my husband finds out
that I had an affair,

575
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:56,115
he will file for divorce.
He will do anything.

576
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,210
What do you mean?

577
00:45:57,286 --> 00:45:58,844
He'll take my daughter.

578
00:45:58,922 --> 00:45:59,945
- Really?
- Yes.

579
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,547
You don't know him. He's not like you.

580
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,623
Now this is all I can spare
without my husband noticing.

581
00:46:07,697 --> 00:46:09,666
No. No way. No. I'll take care of it.

582
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:14,360
I just wanted to make sure you're OK.

583
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,036
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

584
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:22,907
I'm sorry.

585
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:28,510
Hey.

586
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,847
I want to see you.

587
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,411
I can't, Charles. I'm sorry. I can't.

588
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:40,853
What?

589
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,706
Where you going?

590
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:27,710
Come on, we're talking to you.

591
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,614
Goddamn dog.

592
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,476
- Fuck you don't watch where you going?
- Sorry.

593
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,987
Sorry don't pay the bills, white boy.

594
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:42,719
Sorry don't stop
world wars or feed the poor.

595
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,851
As far as I'm concerned,
sorry's for shit.

596
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:47,054
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

597
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,393
Charlie, is it?

598
00:47:49,465 --> 00:47:50,659
Your name Charlie?

599
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:53,831
- Yeah.
- Call you Chuck?

600
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,740
- Where's LaRoche?
- I'll take you to him.

601
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:01,902
Fuck you think I'm here for,
conversation?

602
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,146
Look, why don't I
just give you the money?

603
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,842
Hey, you're not giving me shit,
you understand?

604
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,385
You gotta see Frenchie.

605
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,382
Up against the wall,
and don't fucking move!

606
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,192
So you write commercials, huh?

607
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:25,632
Yeah.

608
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:29,865
I made this demo for this
coffee commercial this one time.

609
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,840
It was a fine piece of music.

610
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,034
- Really?
- Yeah.

611
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,509
What'd they say?

612
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:37,603
They said people
who drink coffee don't like rap.

613
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,878
- That's ridiculous.
- That's what I said.

614
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:44,250
So, uh, if I get somethir to you,

615
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,188
you give it a listen,
uh, see what you can do with it?

616
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,782
- Yeah. Sure.
- Huh.

617
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:55,389
Hey.

618
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,699
Charlie.

619
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,943
Man, you look like shit.

620
00:49:11,914 --> 00:49:13,940
Nice briefcase, though.

621
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,858
Well...

622
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:36,704
Thanks, Charlie.

623
00:49:38,307 --> 00:49:41,208
That's for canceling your credit cards.

624
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:46,277
- It is a nice briefcase.
- It is a nice briefcase.

625
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:48,545
Keep your head up, homey.

626
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,248
I don't often go into the city.

627
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,012
But when I do,

628
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:27,181
I find comfort
in the knowledge that my

629
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:31,215
Amerispend One card...

630
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,831
Ameris... Amerispend One...

631
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,889
Shit.

632
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,992
I... I... What's...

633
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,333
Susan Davis calls this
retro avant-garde.

634
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:44,737
I think it's more retro avant-crap.

635
00:50:45,574 --> 00:50:47,668
Eliot, I'm in trouble.

636
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,871
What kind of trouble?

637
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:52,380
I cheated on Deanna.

638
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,141
- You never cheated before?
- No.

639
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:58,085
Everybody cheats.
You know what? Everybody gets over it.

640
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,679
- No, this is different.
- Everybody says that too.

641
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,418
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.
- There's this man...

642
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,552
I don't want to know who it was with.

643
00:51:05,628 --> 00:51:08,860
Look, buy Deanna some flowers.
Talk it over with her.

644
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:10,922
Try not to get caught next time.

645
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,061
Now, for God's sake,
will you help me fix this piece of crap?

646
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,731
I don't often go into the city.

647
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:25,007
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

648
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,442
Chaz.

649
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:32,585
- What up, yo?
- Hey.

650
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:34,146
Ah, man, welcome back.

651
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,315
How long has it been?

652
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:38,557
High school.

653
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,152
Man, the best three years
of my life, man.

654
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,358
All the pussy you could imagine,

655
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:45,161
4.0 GPA,

656
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,760
everything good
till they locked my ass away.

657
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,702
What were you in for?

658
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,402
Me? I was what they call
a recreational drug user.

659
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:55,467
And that's it?

660
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:58,742
I was also
a recreational drug distributor.

661
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:02,443
You know, a little H, some dope, digi.

662
00:52:02,518 --> 00:52:04,213
So how was it?

663
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:06,050
Man, nothir but the best.

664
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,023
I sold a pure commodity
at a fair market price.

665
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,581
No. Prison.

666
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:15,797
Prisors like walkir a tightrope.

667
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:17,697
You try not to get involved.

668
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:20,429
Actir like you're blind 24 hours a day.

669
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:23,701
This shit takes
a shitload of concentration.

670
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:27,606
I mean, when I first got in thatjoint,
man, I was prime meat.

671
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,338
I was what they call unaffiliated.

672
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:31,811
So, what'd you do?

673
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,976
I got affiliated.

674
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:38,713
I had to stick a shank up in some kid.

675
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,518
What, you killed him?

676
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,820
Your back is up against the wall,

677
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:46,260
and it's you or him,

678
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,422
you gotta do what you gotta do.

679
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:10,583
Yeah. This is Charles.

680
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:14,054
You ever get
a little sidetracked, Charlie?

681
00:53:14,123 --> 00:53:16,182
I need another loan, Charlie.

682
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,557
Now listen. Listen to me.

683
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:21,927
I've got no more money for you.

684
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,125
OK. OK, man. You win.

685
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,635
You want me
to leave you alone,

686
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:28,364
I'll leave you alone.

687
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,871
No problemo.

688
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:34,068
For $100,000, though.

689
00:53:34,143 --> 00:53:35,610
Fuck you.

690
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,978
Tsk. You ain't that smart.

691
00:53:39,048 --> 00:53:40,539
Anybody ever told you that?

692
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:41,947
How'd you get this number?

693
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:45,146
That's it. Keep thinking like that.

694
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,849
How did I get your cell number?

695
00:53:47,923 --> 00:53:49,289
It isn't listed, is it?

696
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:51,054
You called my wife.

697
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:53,755
Ah, no. Guess again.

698
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:57,163
OK, I'll give you a clue.

699
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:01,101
On this phone,
it's speed dial number eight.

700
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,436
Hospital one, doctor two.

701
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:06,668
You're number eight.

702
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:09,371
You don't even rate in the top five.

703
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:11,471
How does that feel, Charlie?

704
00:54:14,117 --> 00:54:15,583
Oh, Jesus!

705
00:54:41,543 --> 00:54:43,443
Oh, yeah.

706
00:54:43,512 --> 00:54:45,639
Hey! Here's my man.

707
00:54:46,382 --> 00:54:48,442
You OK? You look
like you ran a marathon.

708
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,507
What?

709
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,219
What did you say
to him on the phone?

710
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,054
Well, in our business one has to know
how to light a fire under people.

711
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,322
It's the best way to get things done.
Do you not agree, Charles?

712
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,659
- What's going on here?
- Mr. LaRoche needs you

713
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,960
to sign off on that thing
he called about.

714
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,097
Oh, gosh.

715
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,867
- Did you think I would not come?
- No, I thought you got the message.

716
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,434
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

717
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,445
But you look so out of shape, Charles.

718
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,539
Sit down and catch
your breath for a second.

719
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:22,641
- I'll pour coffee.
- You don't know how many times

720
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,619
- I told him to join my tennis club.
- What?

721
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,215
You know Charles. He prefers
to follow sports, not play them.

722
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,452
But one has
to keep fit in today's world

723
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,791
'cause you never know when you'll
need to be at your fighting best.

724
00:55:33,862 --> 00:55:35,797
Please.

725
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:38,594
He's right. You might have
been able to outrun that mugger.

726
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,501
Oh. Well, from what Charles told me,

727
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,630
that thug had a jump on him
from the very start.

728
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,302
This is crazy.
You never had a chance, did you?

729
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:48,536
I'm gonna get him back.

730
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,670
You're not getting anyone back.
You have a family.

731
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,476
You're so right, Deanna, so right.

732
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,179
You wanna protect your family
'cause at the end of the day,

733
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,847
this is the most important thing
in the whole world.

734
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:04,320
- Mom, have you seen my sketchbook?
- Get back upstairs.

735
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:06,054
- Go do your homework.
- Charles.

736
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:09,393
Amy, this is Mr. LaRoche.
He works with your father.

737
00:56:10,032 --> 00:56:13,434
Come here, beauty.

738
00:56:19,675 --> 00:56:23,702
It means, "like a little stone
that's rolling down the river."

739
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,440
So cute.

740
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:27,608
- May I kiss you?
- Mm-hm.

741
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,552
You know,
we were looking at your drawings.

742
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,521
They're lovely. Truly beautiful.

743
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,251
Thank you.

744
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:37,088
Such a talent.

745
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:39,822
You know, when I first came
to this beautiful country,

746
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,728
I spent quite a lot
of time in New York.

747
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:44,425
And if you allow me, of course,

748
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,664
I could show these
to some very prominent art dealers.

749
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,965
That sounds great.

750
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,028
How about we go sign off
on this contract?

751
00:56:51,106 --> 00:56:53,405
Oh, yes, business is business,
of course.

752
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,840
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

753
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:58,445
Whoop!

754
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,248
She's so cute.

755
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:02,579
I'll be up soon, honey.

756
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:04,347
How old is she?

757
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:10,157
- You get the fuck out of my house.
- What did you say?

758
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,751
- Get out.
- I beg your pardon.

759
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:16,157
What'd you say?

760
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,632
Ooh.

761
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,760
You don't like that, huh?

762
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:25,938
You upper-crust motherfucker. Huh?

763
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:31,007
You got it all, and yet you're ready
to fuck it up forjust a bit of pussy?

764
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:32,547
- Fuck...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

765
00:57:33,976 --> 00:57:35,306
A hundred...

766
00:57:35,376 --> 00:57:37,844
A hundred thousand dollars,

767
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:41,405
and I just might
give you back your balls, bitch.

768
00:57:41,483 --> 00:57:42,882
You hear me?

769
00:57:42,951 --> 00:57:45,612
Say it. OK? OK?

770
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:47,847
Yeah, nice boy.

771
00:57:49,824 --> 00:57:52,793
OK... OK.

772
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:56,626
Well... au revoir. Thanks for having me.

773
00:57:56,697 --> 00:58:00,134
- Au revoir.
- I'll see you soon. Bye.

774
00:58:02,403 --> 00:58:03,961
He seems like a lovely guy.

775
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:07,768
Why didn't you call me
when this whole thing began?

776
00:58:07,842 --> 00:58:10,003
I'm supposed
to be your first call, Charles.

777
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:12,342
I don't need a lecture,
I need to know my options.

778
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:14,041
Look, she's gotta come forward.

779
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,742
I told you, she can't do that.

780
00:58:15,818 --> 00:58:19,117
- We need a statement on the record.
- Jerry, he was in my house.

781
00:58:19,188 --> 00:58:20,677
With my family.

782
00:58:20,755 --> 00:58:22,724
He didn't break in.
He didn't touch them.

783
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:25,657
- He didn't threaten them.
- Jerry. He broke my nose.

784
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:27,284
OK, show me the police report.

785
00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:29,795
Did you go to the police
when you got beat?

786
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,327
So...

787
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,891
So you've done nothing
about this for six weeks,

788
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,302
and now suddenly you want me
to file a complaint?

789
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:39,340
You've got to get her to come forward.

790
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:42,639
Anything else is just...
pissing in the wind.

791
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,043
- What are you doing here?
- I spoke to my lawyer.

792
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:47,876
- We have to go to the police.
- We can't go to the police.

793
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,177
Listen to me.

794
00:58:49,251 --> 00:58:52,242
- We didn't sleep together.
- It's the same thing.

795
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,255
Because we didn't fuck
doesn't mean we didn't cross the line.

796
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:57,291
We went to the hotel.
We started to do it.

797
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:00,293
And we didn't stop
out of the conscience of our hearts.

798
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:02,193
Exactly. We were attacked.

799
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:09,570
I had an abortion, Charles.

800
00:59:10,137 --> 00:59:11,195
What?

801
00:59:14,775 --> 00:59:16,606
Why didn't you tell me?

802
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,809
I... I could have helped.
I could have done something.

803
00:59:21,884 --> 00:59:23,851
Done what, Charles?

804
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,514
What could you have done?

805
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:33,686
Oh! Snap his back, man!

806
00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:36,025
Smack him!
Referee, that's a penalty!

807
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:41,625
Sorry, you know I get zoned
to this hockey shit, Chaz, man.

808
00:59:41,702 --> 00:59:43,260
OK, I'm listening.

809
00:59:43,338 --> 00:59:45,498
So, what do you think I should do?

810
00:59:45,574 --> 00:59:48,804
Shit, I don't know, man.
But you see how it works, though, right?

811
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:53,336
He lures you in with 20 grand. Folks
like you could pull together 20 grand

812
00:59:53,414 --> 00:59:54,746
if you had to, right?

813
00:59:54,815 --> 00:59:58,047
You think, 20 grand,
bong, and he's gone, right?

814
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:00,179
Nah. It's not about that.

815
01:00:00,255 --> 01:00:02,688
He wanna see if you're
the kind of asshole who pays.

816
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:05,021
Then after that...

817
01:00:05,092 --> 01:00:08,824
...slap the big dick on you, hit you
for the real cheese, the big bucks.

818
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:11,092
That's what this game
is all about, Chaz.

819
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,065
Thanks, Winston,
I feel much better now.

820
01:00:13,135 --> 01:00:15,501
You're a wild cowboy, yo.

821
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:19,300
Well, can you pay him?

822
01:00:19,974 --> 01:00:22,306
Technically, yeah, I have the money.

823
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:24,641
Shit, yo, so pay him,
man, be done with this.

824
01:00:24,713 --> 01:00:26,806
I can't. It's put away
for something else.

825
01:00:26,882 --> 01:00:28,907
It's years of savings. Can't touch it.

826
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:31,885
I don't know what to do.
I'm going out of my fuckir mind here.

827
01:00:31,954 --> 01:00:34,581
- It's there everywhere I turn.
- Calm down, Chaz.

828
01:00:34,655 --> 01:00:36,590
Look, man, drink your beer.

829
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:40,494
Shit, that ain't even
strong enough right now.

830
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:43,621
O'Malley, let us get
a double Scotch and hold the rocks.

831
01:00:45,233 --> 01:00:46,530
Let me tell you something.

832
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,969
I spent five years in the joint
with motherfuckers like this.

833
01:00:50,038 --> 01:00:53,632
The first thing you must understand
about a rapist is that they pussies.

834
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,574
They weak. They prey on the weak.

835
01:00:55,643 --> 01:00:57,271
So, what do you think I should do?

836
01:00:57,346 --> 01:01:01,338
Listen, man, I like you,

837
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:03,679
'cause you're different
than the rest of them.

838
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:06,152
I don't like to see you
in no position like this.

839
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:07,688
So I'm gonna do you a solid.

840
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:10,224
I'm gonna scare this pussy
off your back for you.

841
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,817
- No. No, no, no.
- Listen, I owe you.

842
01:01:12,893 --> 01:01:15,054
You caught me stealir those computers,

843
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,597
you coulda dropped a dime on me,

844
01:01:16,664 --> 01:01:18,791
I'd have been locked up
for three more years.

845
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:22,268
- Winston, you owe me nothing.
- Look at it this way then.

846
01:01:22,336 --> 01:01:24,134
Let's make it a business proposition.

847
01:01:24,206 --> 01:01:26,673
Instead of you giving
this motherfucker 100K,

848
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:29,539
you could pay me, say, ten percent?

849
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:32,204
Yeah, $10,000 in cash,

850
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,806
and I'll scare that Pepé Le Pew
motherfucker all the way back to France.

851
01:01:39,954 --> 01:01:42,355
Hurry up.

852
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:46,155
- Thank you!
- Happy birthday.

853
01:01:48,797 --> 01:01:50,320
Look at this one.

854
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:54,199
- That's nail polish.
- Nail polish? Is it?

855
01:01:54,268 --> 01:01:55,963
Yeah.

856
01:01:56,038 --> 01:01:58,268
- What's that one?
- Here.

857
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,541
Oh, it's beautiful.

858
01:02:09,784 --> 01:02:10,842
Oh, thank you.

859
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,324
Thank you. Goodbye.

860
01:02:27,835 --> 01:02:30,737
Charles, this just came in for you.

861
01:02:39,313 --> 01:02:41,304
Does it involve fast cars?

862
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,782
Yeah,
fast cars, all the good things.

863
01:02:43,851 --> 01:02:47,686
- We'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Bye-bye, pretty girls.

864
01:02:48,989 --> 01:02:51,753
Good morning, JMD/March.

865
01:02:51,827 --> 01:02:53,885
No, I'm sorry. That's OK.

866
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:56,931
OK, no problem. Goodbye.

867
01:02:56,998 --> 01:02:58,590
- Yeah?
- Barry. It's me.

868
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:01,362
I need a cash check
for this aspirin spot.

869
01:03:01,436 --> 01:03:02,630
Another one?

870
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:05,434
- How much you want this time?
- Ten thousand.

871
01:03:05,507 --> 01:03:08,442
You come down here,
and you sign for it yourself, yeah?

872
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:09,534
Thanks.

873
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:10,942
Hey, yo, Chaz.

874
01:03:11,012 --> 01:03:13,775
You know what my favorite song is?

875
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:17,614
"Get Money." B.I.G. and Lil' Kim.

876
01:03:17,686 --> 01:03:18,947
My favorite artists?

877
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:21,887
Eddie Money, Al Green

878
01:03:21,956 --> 01:03:24,925
and Johnny motherfuckir Cash, baby.

879
01:03:24,992 --> 01:03:27,119
Oh, let me tell you
my favorite reverends.

880
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:32,427
- Frederick Price and Creflo Dollar.
- Yes, Winston, I have your money.

881
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:34,492
Who's talkir money here, Chaz?

882
01:03:34,568 --> 01:03:36,594
Just tryir to make conversation, man.

883
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:39,003
- You OK, Chaz?
- Yeah.

884
01:03:39,074 --> 01:03:43,601
Let me turn this up for you, baby,
get a crack on this motherfucker.

885
01:04:01,695 --> 01:04:03,960
Uh-oh. Ching-ching.

886
01:04:06,568 --> 01:04:08,626
Love the smell of fresh money, yo.

887
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:13,239
Jesus.

888
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,775
You're gonna shoot him?

889
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:18,175
I ain't gonna shoot him. I'm gonna
scare his monkey-ass off your back.

890
01:04:18,246 --> 01:04:19,735
It's not even loaded.

891
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:22,840
But it's like
an old gangsta proverb, yo.

892
01:04:22,918 --> 01:04:26,376
You ain't gotta use force,
but you gotta project strength.

893
01:04:26,454 --> 01:04:29,047
Project strength. Right.

894
01:04:29,123 --> 01:04:32,184
- Got it.
- Chaz, my good buddy,

895
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,353
it's time you got affiliated, man.
Come on, take that.

896
01:04:36,463 --> 01:04:37,896
Is this the one you used...?

897
01:04:37,965 --> 01:04:40,365
That's the one, yo.
That's for good luck.

898
01:04:40,434 --> 01:04:43,871
I'm gonna run inside this joint first,
scope it out.

899
01:04:43,938 --> 01:04:46,271
When you feel comfortable,
you come on in.

900
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,105
We got maybe a hour
before this bastard shows up.

901
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,077
You're gonna be close, though, right?

902
01:04:51,146 --> 01:04:53,545
I'm gonna be close.
Don't worry. I got your back.

903
01:04:53,614 --> 01:04:55,242
It's like in the movies and shit,

904
01:04:55,317 --> 01:04:57,784
the bad guy
is always one step ahead, right?

905
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:01,219
So we gotta be two steps ahead
of this crazy motherfucker...

906
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:08,485
Charlie...

907
01:05:09,731 --> 01:05:10,719
Charlie.

908
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,864
This doesn't look like 100 to me.

909
01:05:13,934 --> 01:05:16,664
God almighty. You killed him.

910
01:05:16,737 --> 01:05:18,728
You brought him,
you fuckir piece of shit,

911
01:05:18,806 --> 01:05:21,297
and this isn't good
for our relationship.

912
01:05:35,155 --> 01:05:36,248
Oh, Jesus.

913
01:05:43,597 --> 01:05:45,759
- Asshole!
- Fuck you!

914
01:05:45,833 --> 01:05:48,632
You coulda been coming
instead of going!

915
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,266
Want a date, hon?

916
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:55,570
Hey, you. You by the car.

917
01:05:55,643 --> 01:05:57,043
You lookir?

918
01:05:57,112 --> 01:05:59,637
No. No, I-I'm fine.

919
01:05:59,713 --> 01:06:01,306
What about him?

920
01:06:01,382 --> 01:06:03,373
Maybe he wants a date.

921
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:05,385
I don't think so.

922
01:06:06,221 --> 01:06:09,213
What's wrong with him? He drunk?

923
01:06:09,291 --> 01:06:12,088
Yeah. Yeah, he's... he's drunk, OK.

924
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:14,128
You got a light?

925
01:06:14,195 --> 01:06:15,253
I... I don't smoke.

926
01:06:15,329 --> 01:06:18,298
You don't smoke, you don't drink,

927
01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:21,960
you don't fuck. What do you do?

928
01:06:23,672 --> 01:06:26,505
- Get outta here.
- What? Hey, screw you!

929
01:06:26,574 --> 01:06:28,905
Don't tell me to get outta nowhere.

930
01:06:28,976 --> 01:06:31,411
- What's up, Candy?
- Hey, Joe.

931
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:32,639
Hey, Candy.

932
01:06:32,713 --> 01:06:35,978
- Keepir safe?
- You know me.

933
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:39,144
I'm careful these days.

934
01:06:39,219 --> 01:06:43,054
Hey, you! Conducting
a transaction with Candy here?

935
01:06:43,123 --> 01:06:45,114
- No, officer...
- No?

936
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:47,626
What? Something wrong with her?

937
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:50,688
- No, she's great.
- Great, huh?

938
01:06:53,835 --> 01:06:55,927
- You married?
- Yes.

939
01:06:56,003 --> 01:06:58,335
Your old lady know
you're trolling for hookers?

940
01:06:58,405 --> 01:07:02,172
- I-I'm not. Look...
- How 'bout your buddy? He married?

941
01:07:02,844 --> 01:07:03,833
He's drunk.

942
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,771
If he's drunk,
what's he doing behind the wheel?

943
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:09,817
Hey, buddy! Hey, you there!

944
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:11,181
He's sleeping it off, sir.

945
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:17,353
The two of you were out trolling
for hookers on a Wednesday,

946
01:07:17,425 --> 01:07:20,052
and neither of you were
doing business with Candy here.

947
01:07:20,996 --> 01:07:23,123
- I'm sorry, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

948
01:07:23,197 --> 01:07:25,132
Don't apologize to me.

949
01:07:25,199 --> 01:07:26,530
Tell her you're sorry.

950
01:07:26,601 --> 01:07:28,159
Freezir her ass off out here,

951
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:31,432
and you two jokers
don't even give her the time of day.

952
01:07:41,115 --> 01:07:43,208
I'm sorry, ma'am.

953
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:46,349
We'll call it a deposit. Huh?

954
01:07:47,822 --> 01:07:49,152
Believe this guy?

955
01:07:49,224 --> 01:07:52,193
- We're on the clock.
- We're gonna circle the block.

956
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,851
I come back and you're still here,

957
01:07:53,927 --> 01:07:56,088
I'm gonna take you and your buddy in.

958
01:07:56,164 --> 01:07:58,860
- See ya, Candy.
- Take it easy, Candy.

959
01:07:58,932 --> 01:08:00,331
See ya, Joe.

960
01:10:18,372 --> 01:10:22,240
I'm tired of you, Charles. I
need that receipt for the aspirin spot.

961
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,436
- I said you'll get it today, you will.
- Today?

962
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,739
Yes. Lunchtime.

963
01:10:25,813 --> 01:10:27,439
- Well, you better...
- Oh, shit!

964
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:30,975
You OK?

965
01:10:31,051 --> 01:10:34,248
Folks in the mailroom
asked me to bring this up to you.

966
01:10:34,322 --> 01:10:36,085
Franklin Church. Chicago P.D.

967
01:10:36,157 --> 01:10:37,886
- Where is...?
- Winston?

968
01:10:39,661 --> 01:10:41,560
He was murdered last night.

969
01:10:41,628 --> 01:10:43,220
- What'd you say?
- That's right.

970
01:10:43,297 --> 01:10:44,765
Midnight, under the highway.

971
01:10:44,832 --> 01:10:46,890
Killer tried to dump him in the river.

972
01:10:46,967 --> 01:10:47,992
Jesus.

973
01:10:50,738 --> 01:10:51,966
I...

974
01:10:53,173 --> 01:10:54,640
Jesu...

975
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:59,809
- I liked Winston. We were friends.
- Yeah. I liked him too.

976
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,939
We were like brothers.

977
01:11:02,015 --> 01:11:05,109
He's... Well, he was
sort of a relative of mine.

978
01:11:05,185 --> 01:11:07,518
- Are you the baseball stats guy?
- Yeah.

979
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:10,079
Yeah, that's me. Baseball freak.

980
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:13,024
Even played in the minors '79 to '82.

981
01:11:14,695 --> 01:11:18,029
You know,
I see these losers every day.

982
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:22,725
Dopers. Crooks. Gangbangers.

983
01:11:22,804 --> 01:11:25,101
Law doesn't care much
for losers like that.

984
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:29,777
Winston was different.
He coulda got out.

985
01:11:29,844 --> 01:11:31,402
The brother was no loser.

986
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:33,269
I'm sorry.

987
01:11:35,483 --> 01:11:37,814
- You own a gun, Mr. Schine?
- No.

988
01:11:37,885 --> 01:11:39,944
Smith & Wesson 5906?

989
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,113
What, you think I did this?

990
01:11:42,189 --> 01:11:44,715
Oh, no, of course not.

991
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:48,125
But we have to ask everybody.
I mean, you know how it is.

992
01:11:48,195 --> 01:11:49,787
So where were you last night?

993
01:11:49,863 --> 01:11:52,332
Here. Work. I was at work.

994
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:55,891
Anyone... with you corroborate that?

995
01:11:59,172 --> 01:12:02,073
- Do you mind?
- No. No, no, I'll wait.

996
01:12:03,176 --> 01:12:04,166
Yeah.

997
01:12:04,244 --> 01:12:07,145
What did you think?
You could fuck with me,

998
01:12:07,215 --> 01:12:10,207
- you miserable piece of shit? Huh?
- No.

999
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,548
I've got your girl here.

1000
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:15,588
Do you understand me?
I've got your little whore right here.

1001
01:12:15,657 --> 01:12:20,320
- Oh, God. Stop, please...
- Where are you?

1002
01:12:20,395 --> 01:12:22,386
Shut the fuck up Dex, take care of her.

1003
01:12:22,462 --> 01:12:23,520
No problem.

1004
01:12:23,597 --> 01:12:26,896
I don't like killing,
but if you're not here in 20 minutes,

1005
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:29,095
- I'm gonna put a bullet in her brain.
- Don't.

1006
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:32,229
And then one in Deanna.
And sweet little Amy too.

1007
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,867
I'm gonna kill all your women,
do you understand?

1008
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:38,240
It was a mistake, a big mistake.
I'm ready to do what you ask now.

1009
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:39,837
Do you have my 100,000?

1010
01:12:39,913 --> 01:12:41,881
Yeah, yeah, I do.
I mean, I will. Just...

1011
01:12:41,948 --> 01:12:43,609
Just tell me how to get there.

1012
01:12:43,685 --> 01:12:47,121
- Uh-huh, 55 East Erie, apartment 4010.
- Got it.

1013
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:49,679
Twenty minutes, Charlie.
Next time I visit your wife

1014
01:12:49,756 --> 01:12:51,622
it ain't gonna be for a cup of coffee.

1015
01:12:51,693 --> 01:12:53,091
Thank you very much.

1016
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:59,823
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry. I have... I gotta go.

1017
01:13:01,536 --> 01:13:04,801
I have a meeting. I'll call you.

1018
01:13:05,872 --> 01:13:10,502
10, 20, 30, 40, 50,

1019
01:13:10,578 --> 01:13:16,311
60, 70, 80, 90, 100,000.

1020
01:13:16,384 --> 01:13:20,149
Are you sure you want to carry
all this out with you, Mr. Schine?

1021
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,448
Yeah.

1022
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,737
What's up, Charles? Come on.

1023
01:13:58,658 --> 01:14:01,650
Come on in. Don't be scared.

1024
01:14:08,202 --> 01:14:09,225
Way!

1025
01:14:10,371 --> 01:14:13,898
Dex. You think I should count this,
or... just trust him?

1026
01:14:13,975 --> 01:14:16,033
Sure. Why not?

1027
01:14:16,109 --> 01:14:18,408
He looks like a trustable guy.

1028
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:20,572
You fucking move, I'll kill you, bitch!

1029
01:14:24,786 --> 01:14:26,150
One motherfucking.

1030
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,618
Two motherfucking.

1031
01:14:27,688 --> 01:14:28,916
Three.

1032
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:31,082
- I gave you the money!
- What?

1033
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:34,525
No, you didn't give me the money.
You fucking made me kill for it.

1034
01:14:36,863 --> 01:14:39,162
Keep something in mind, Charles.

1035
01:14:39,233 --> 01:14:41,827
I'll always be one step ahead of you.

1036
01:14:41,903 --> 01:14:43,336
Always.

1037
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,208
Well, my dear Dexter,

1038
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:51,676
I think it's time to relocate.

1039
01:14:51,746 --> 01:14:54,475
Yeah. Relocate.

1040
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:57,614
- Au revoir.
- Mm-hm.

1041
01:14:59,386 --> 01:15:01,514
Congratulations, Charlie.

1042
01:15:01,588 --> 01:15:04,023
You just bought your life back.

1043
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:20,103
Are you OK?

1044
01:15:21,742 --> 01:15:23,971
I don't even...

1045
01:15:24,045 --> 01:15:25,603
They must have just followed me.

1046
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:28,979
I didn't even... I don't know...
They just... pushed their way in.

1047
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,483
It's OK now.

1048
01:15:35,789 --> 01:15:39,350
- Are you sure that they're gone?
- He's gone.

1049
01:15:39,426 --> 01:15:40,654
I paid him.

1050
01:15:43,764 --> 01:15:45,355
I paid him everything.

1051
01:15:48,435 --> 01:15:49,698
But your daughter...

1052
01:15:54,809 --> 01:15:56,002
I'm sorry.

1053
01:15:57,144 --> 01:15:58,509
I'm so sorry.

1054
01:15:59,212 --> 01:16:01,806
- I should have...
- I think it's over now.

1055
01:16:05,418 --> 01:16:06,680
You're safe.

1056
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,655
My family's safe.

1057
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,350
Hello?

1058
01:16:48,762 --> 01:16:50,993
Charles, is that you? Hello?

1059
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,641
- See you, Sean.
- See ya.

1060
01:17:10,717 --> 01:17:12,185
Take care, guys.

1061
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:23,756
You're a hard man to track down.

1062
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:28,363
You're not at work,
you're not at home...

1063
01:17:30,003 --> 01:17:33,234
This is where all you bored executive
types go to drown your sorrows.

1064
01:17:33,306 --> 01:17:35,434
I've been meaning to call you.

1065
01:17:35,509 --> 01:17:37,443
I'm sure.

1066
01:17:37,511 --> 01:17:39,444
You know, ever since he was a kid,

1067
01:17:39,512 --> 01:17:41,572
Winston never could
seem to catch a break.

1068
01:17:41,649 --> 01:17:43,514
You know who
he always reminded me of?

1069
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:45,847
Bobby Bonds.

1070
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,684
Unluckiest player
to ever step up to the plate.

1071
01:17:48,756 --> 01:17:52,521
Bobby Bonds struck out
187 times in 1969,

1072
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:55,390
more than any other player
in a single season,

1073
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,056
except one.

1074
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:59,497
You know who?

1075
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:04,768
- Bobby Bonds.
- Bobby Bonds.

1076
01:18:04,838 --> 01:18:07,706
Following year. 189 strikeouts.

1077
01:18:08,341 --> 01:18:09,399
Now, that's unlucky.

1078
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:14,804
This is my new buddy.
Sean owns this place.

1079
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:18,113
- Hey, Sean, Scotch. Drop the rocks.
- Coming up, Frank.

1080
01:18:18,185 --> 01:18:20,948
Sean says you and Winston
had a drink here recently.

1081
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:23,216
Mind telling me
what you were talking about?

1082
01:18:24,291 --> 01:18:27,521
- Hockey.
- Hockey. That's it?

1083
01:18:27,595 --> 01:18:29,391
There was a game on.

1084
01:18:29,462 --> 01:18:32,431
Now, I still need to know
where you were last night.

1085
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,467
I told ya. I was working.

1086
01:18:34,534 --> 01:18:37,698
- No one at your office can confirm.
- I was alone.

1087
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:40,570
OK, Mr. Schine.

1088
01:18:41,242 --> 01:18:44,643
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
talking to me with your lawyer.

1089
01:18:44,712 --> 01:18:47,646
Why don't the two of you
come by my office tomorrow morning?

1090
01:18:47,715 --> 01:18:49,181
And just so you know,

1091
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:54,610
I'm gonna crucify
the son of a bitch who killed Winston.

1092
01:19:03,596 --> 01:19:06,064
- See ya, Sean.
- Detective.

1093
01:19:19,546 --> 01:19:20,536
Charles?

1094
01:19:28,055 --> 01:19:29,180
Amy sleeping?

1095
01:19:29,256 --> 01:19:30,779
Yeah.

1096
01:19:35,863 --> 01:19:39,025
I've made a horrible mistake, Dee.

1097
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,610
The money we put away for Amy...

1098
01:19:55,949 --> 01:19:57,507
...it's gone.

1099
01:19:58,886 --> 01:20:01,854
- Gone?
- All of it.

1100
01:20:02,823 --> 01:20:04,289
What are you talking about?

1101
01:20:04,358 --> 01:20:07,417
- I'm so sorry.
- Well, where is it? Where is the money?

1102
01:20:07,494 --> 01:20:10,430
- I'll figure it out.
- Figure out what? What's going on?

1103
01:20:10,497 --> 01:20:13,023
- I'll find a way.
- What have you done?

1104
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,296
Tell me what you've done.

1105
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:24,676
Seven years of savings.

1106
01:20:24,744 --> 01:20:28,613
- You fucking explain yourself!
- I'll tell you, Dee.

1107
01:20:28,681 --> 01:20:30,649
I'll tell you everything.

1108
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:35,052
And it's notjust about the money.

1109
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:42,694
Ah. Come on, we're late.

1110
01:20:42,762 --> 01:20:44,492
I have to tell Lucinda first, Jerry.

1111
01:20:44,564 --> 01:20:47,431
No. I've called this detective
twice already this morning.

1112
01:20:47,501 --> 01:20:49,092
- He's a real hard-ass.
- I have to.

1113
01:20:49,936 --> 01:20:53,235
- You think this guy is fuckir around?
- I'll meet you down there.

1114
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,502
- So, what am I supposed to tell them?
- Help me.

1115
01:20:55,576 --> 01:20:56,564
Charles!

1116
01:20:57,845 --> 01:21:00,712
- Lucinda Harris, please.
- She's not in her office.

1117
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,078
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, wait. Here she comes now.

1118
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:08,777
- No. No, no, no. Lucinda Harris.
- Yeah?

1119
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:12,849
No, you saw us here. Together.

1120
01:21:12,926 --> 01:21:15,225
- Twice. Remember?
- I saw you with her temp.

1121
01:21:15,296 --> 01:21:17,195
- Temp?
- Sure. You know,

1122
01:21:17,264 --> 01:21:19,425
answered her phones occasionally,

1123
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,162
took long lunches, always late. A temp.

1124
01:21:23,237 --> 01:21:25,636
Jane something. She quit last week.

1125
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:36,311
I'm a financial advisor.

1126
01:21:36,382 --> 01:21:38,543
I cheat clients.

1127
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:51,626
And it comes fully furnished,
just like you see.

1128
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,132
What we call our lived-in look.

1129
01:21:55,301 --> 01:21:57,667
- May I help you, sir?
- Is this place for rent?

1130
01:21:57,738 --> 01:21:59,864
Yes, would you like a brochure?

1131
01:21:59,939 --> 01:22:01,532
It was rented. I was here.

1132
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:04,168
Well, it's available again now.
Are you interested?

1133
01:22:04,244 --> 01:22:05,576
You rented it to a woman.

1134
01:22:05,645 --> 01:22:08,206
No, no, it was a couple.
A woman and her boyfriend.

1135
01:22:08,282 --> 01:22:10,750
They left unexpectedly.
Very nice couple.

1136
01:22:10,818 --> 01:22:12,649
You know them?

1137
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,244
They make it
all won'th it, don't they?

1138
01:22:15,322 --> 01:22:17,186
Yes.

1139
01:22:17,257 --> 01:22:18,815
I do.

1140
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:31,430
This is the end of the Red Line.

1141
01:22:31,505 --> 01:22:34,405
All passengers please
disembark at this time.

1142
01:22:34,475 --> 01:22:36,101
Thank you.

1143
01:22:36,176 --> 01:22:38,701
The train on platform two

1144
01:22:38,779 --> 01:22:42,840
is the Blue Line from Cottage Gate.
This is our final destination.

1145
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:46,181
All passengers please
disembark at this time.

1146
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:48,516
Thank you.

1147
01:22:58,966 --> 01:23:02,833
- Hey. I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- Yes. Good.

1148
01:23:02,903 --> 01:23:05,167
I have to run,
I have a breakfast meeting.

1149
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:07,069
- You do.
- Will you call me?

1150
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:09,234
I will. I'll call you very soon.

1151
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,210
- You promise?
- I promise.

1152
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:14,838
- I gotta go. See you later.
- OK. See you.

1153
01:23:14,914 --> 01:23:16,246
Bye-bye!

1154
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,934
- What?
- I'd like to get into the car.

1155
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:45,877
- Half an hour!
- Oh! Half an hour?

1156
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:48,743
- You're sorry?
- I promise.

1157
01:23:56,422 --> 01:23:58,356
May I?

1158
01:23:58,425 --> 01:24:00,324
Thank you.

1159
01:24:01,127 --> 01:24:03,460
- Hey, Dex!
- Yo, Frenchie!

1160
01:24:03,529 --> 01:24:05,190
We outta here.

1161
01:24:16,076 --> 01:24:18,373
I want a room.

1162
01:24:18,444 --> 01:24:20,173
Top floor.

1163
01:24:34,261 --> 01:24:35,626
- Charles.
- Jerry.

1164
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:38,823
Good. So I talked with this detective.
He's got nothing on you.

1165
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:40,422
- He's just fishing.
- Thanks.

1166
01:24:40,501 --> 01:24:43,993
Tell him everything.
It's the only way out of this.

1167
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:47,006
What happens
to Amy's money if they find him?

1168
01:24:47,073 --> 01:24:49,940
- It's gonna be state's evidence.
- And I never see it again?

1169
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:52,877
No, I have to take care of this myself.
It's the only way.

1170
01:24:52,945 --> 01:24:54,606
What are you talking about?

1171
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:57,012
Jerry,
I have to get Amy's money back.

1172
01:24:57,083 --> 01:25:00,349
Charles, wait. Charles...

1173
01:25:23,844 --> 01:25:27,609
- Uh, hi. I-I'd like a room, please.
- Forty-six dollars a night.

1174
01:25:32,485 --> 01:25:33,975
You wanna use the hotel safe?

1175
01:25:34,054 --> 01:25:35,453
Uh, no, thank you.

1176
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:13,618
Um...

1177
01:26:13,694 --> 01:26:15,685
I think it's this way.

1178
01:28:22,122 --> 01:28:23,783
Hey!

1179
01:28:23,856 --> 01:28:25,085
Hey, what's going on?

1180
01:28:26,326 --> 01:28:28,920
You can have my money.
My wallet's on the table. Take it.

1181
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:33,091
I don't want your money. They do.

1182
01:28:33,899 --> 01:28:36,333
They want it all. You're in a scam.

1183
01:28:36,403 --> 01:28:38,962
- What?
- A con.

1184
01:28:39,038 --> 01:28:41,701
These two were gonna take you
for everything you've got.

1185
01:28:43,676 --> 01:28:46,440
I don't know what you're talking about.

1186
01:28:46,512 --> 01:28:48,140
Who are you, and what do you want?

1187
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:53,643
You met on the train, did you?

1188
01:28:55,389 --> 01:28:57,618
By accident. Just happened somehow.

1189
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,990
And she was fuckir sweet...

1190
01:29:02,762 --> 01:29:03,787
...and smart...

1191
01:29:05,698 --> 01:29:08,667
...and you couldn't believe
how attracted she was to you.

1192
01:29:09,935 --> 01:29:12,666
She was just too good to be true.

1193
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:17,175
She showed you this picture
of her daughter.

1194
01:29:18,712 --> 01:29:22,704
Everything this bitch
told you was a lie.

1195
01:29:22,783 --> 01:29:25,274
Not everything was a lie, Charles.

1196
01:29:25,351 --> 01:29:29,082
He was just about to rob you,
and then rape her.

1197
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:32,386
Only it wouldn't have been rape,
would it?

1198
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,085
I don't understand.
Why would he rape her?

1199
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:40,859
Because it makes you feel guilty
you didn't stop it...

1200
01:29:42,269 --> 01:29:43,997
...that you didn't protect her.

1201
01:29:45,905 --> 01:29:49,432
Later on, she may even be as sick
as to tell you she had an abortion.

1202
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:52,306
- So you don't go to the police.
- I don't want any part of this.

1203
01:29:52,378 --> 01:29:54,506
- There's a man waiting.
- I have to leave...

1204
01:29:54,581 --> 01:29:55,774
No!

1205
01:30:01,822 --> 01:30:04,551
Boy, you're getting better, Charles.

1206
01:30:09,729 --> 01:30:12,698
I'm kind of proud of you.

1207
01:30:12,765 --> 01:30:16,395
I want... my fucking money back!

1208
01:30:17,304 --> 01:30:19,067
I want everything you took from me.

1209
01:30:23,443 --> 01:30:25,411
Well...

1210
01:30:25,479 --> 01:30:27,878
I don't think that's
gonna be possible, Charlie.

1211
01:30:27,948 --> 01:30:31,610
Just give him his money, and let's go.

1212
01:30:31,685 --> 01:30:34,518
He's a fuckir mark, for chrissake.

1213
01:30:35,622 --> 01:30:38,386
That sweetie pie is worried
about that little girl of yours.

1214
01:30:38,457 --> 01:30:41,393
- Oh, stop it!
- She didn't look that sick to me.

1215
01:30:41,461 --> 01:30:42,859
Just stop it!

1216
01:30:50,703 --> 01:30:53,399
Let me outta here!
I'm gonna get outta here now!

1217
01:30:53,472 --> 01:30:56,203
I'm telling you,
move away from the fucking door!

1218
01:30:56,275 --> 01:30:59,676
I'm gonna shoot!
Get outta my way! I'm leaving

1219
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,608
Ah!

1220
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:07,284
Frenchie!

1221
01:31:21,734 --> 01:31:22,895
Ah!

1222
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:29,301
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

1223
01:32:29,101 --> 01:32:31,092
Step by step,
what did you hear?

1224
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:34,970
Sir, there's no ID on the white male.
Prints people are on it.

1225
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:38,408
All right. See if he's on the register.
Check what's in the hotel safe.

1226
01:32:38,478 --> 01:32:39,809
Yes, sir.

1227
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,676
Sorry about that. You were saying?

1228
01:32:42,882 --> 01:32:44,213
I heard the shots,

1229
01:32:44,283 --> 01:32:46,582
I saw the security guy run past,

1230
01:32:46,653 --> 01:32:48,882
so I just... closed the door.

1231
01:32:48,954 --> 01:32:50,319
You did the right thing.

1232
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:54,326
You don't know how may wannabe heroes
I ship off to the morgue each week.

1233
01:32:54,394 --> 01:32:57,328
- OK, Mr... Sheen? Schine?
- Schine.

1234
01:32:57,396 --> 01:32:58,488
Schine.

1235
01:32:58,564 --> 01:33:02,261
All right, if we need anything more,
we'll contact you.

1236
01:33:06,273 --> 01:33:08,434
Hey.
You seen Jones from Homicide?

1237
01:33:08,507 --> 01:33:10,237
Yes, sir. Yes, the, uh...

1238
01:33:11,944 --> 01:33:14,708
Vince, can we get the
happy snappers out of here today?

1239
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:17,180
I'm losir the will to live.

1240
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:22,753
Frank. What are you doing here, Frank?

1241
01:33:22,822 --> 01:33:24,448
- Where is it?
- I'll show you.

1242
01:33:24,524 --> 01:33:27,686
Heard you found a Smith & Wesson 5906.

1243
01:33:27,761 --> 01:33:30,729
- Yeah, Ballistics has it.
- What a mess.

1244
01:33:31,765 --> 01:33:33,595
Yeah, pretty straightforward.

1245
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,532
A woman and the suit
are having a thing.

1246
01:33:35,601 --> 01:33:36,694
They get mugged,

1247
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:40,069
security tries to help them...
everybody gets shot.

1248
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,970
I'm interested in that gun,

1249
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:44,771
so please call me
when you get the ballistics report.

1250
01:33:44,844 --> 01:33:46,368
Sure.

1251
01:33:46,445 --> 01:33:49,210
- Thanks.
- OK, take care.

1252
01:33:52,284 --> 01:33:55,515
Vince,
can we get everybody out of here?

1253
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:58,149
- I need a statement.
- Gonna take long?

1254
01:33:58,224 --> 01:34:00,658
- Couple minutes.
- I don't got much time.

1255
01:34:00,726 --> 01:34:02,024
Keep it coming.

1256
01:34:02,095 --> 01:34:03,994
I was standing here.

1257
01:34:06,198 --> 01:34:08,064
You got a lot in that safe.

1258
01:34:14,673 --> 01:34:16,664
I, uh...

1259
01:34:16,743 --> 01:34:19,268
I believe that's mine.

1260
01:34:27,753 --> 01:34:29,051
Nice briefcase.

1261
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:32,421
OK, what else you got?

1262
01:34:42,502 --> 01:34:44,731
Back it up there, back it up.

1263
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:09,894
No sign of it here, either.

1264
01:35:09,962 --> 01:35:11,953
All right, thanks.

1265
01:35:19,706 --> 01:35:22,435
What the hell is this?

1266
01:35:23,643 --> 01:35:25,975
All the years I've known you,

1267
01:35:26,945 --> 01:35:29,210
I never figured you
for a thief, Charles.

1268
01:35:30,483 --> 01:35:34,475
You want to tell me
about the $10,000 for the aspirin spot?

1269
01:35:34,554 --> 01:35:37,886
It was an emergency.
I was gonna pay it back.

1270
01:35:37,957 --> 01:35:39,685
Pay it back?

1271
01:35:39,759 --> 01:35:41,386
What am I, a bank?

1272
01:35:41,461 --> 01:35:43,792
And now you're stealing from it.

1273
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:47,264
If I were to write a bill for what you
owe me, what should I make it for?

1274
01:35:47,332 --> 01:35:48,890
It was just the once, I swear.

1275
01:35:48,967 --> 01:35:51,698
Well, Barry'll be the judge of that.

1276
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:53,636
So...

1277
01:35:53,707 --> 01:35:57,234
...tell me what was so important
that you had to do this.

1278
01:35:57,310 --> 01:35:58,936
Can't.

1279
01:35:59,011 --> 01:36:01,878
I can't tell you.

1280
01:36:01,948 --> 01:36:04,507
I want to, but I can't. I'm sorry.

1281
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:08,542
Fine. You wanna play it that way,
I'll start proceedings.

1282
01:36:09,622 --> 01:36:11,088
Proceedings?

1283
01:36:11,157 --> 01:36:14,149
He suspends you
while we conduct an investigation.

1284
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,561
Just pay it back.

1285
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:20,564
The most you'll get
is community service.

1286
01:36:23,536 --> 01:36:26,936
Keep stonewalling us, pal,
you go to jail.

1287
01:36:42,889 --> 01:36:44,583
Hi there.

1288
01:36:48,228 --> 01:36:51,493
- Heya, teach.
- Hank, isn't it?

1289
01:36:51,564 --> 01:36:52,929
That's good.

1290
01:36:52,998 --> 01:36:55,466
I hate it when people
don't remember your name.

1291
01:36:55,534 --> 01:36:57,002
Go on through.

1292
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:03,699
- It's Charles, by the way.
- Right. Charles.

1293
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:08,403
- Did I ask you what you're in for yet?
- Embezzlement.

1294
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,880
That's not a bad deal.

1295
01:37:09,948 --> 01:37:13,645
Six months teaching cons
for ripping off your boss.

1296
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,619
You're Puerto Rican, right?

1297
01:37:15,688 --> 01:37:17,780
What the fuck is that?

1298
01:37:17,856 --> 01:37:19,414
Puerto Rico, how do you spell it?

1299
01:37:19,492 --> 01:37:21,756
OK, guys.

1300
01:37:23,762 --> 01:37:25,229
Guys!

1301
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:28,759
There's a quiz on your desks.

1302
01:37:28,835 --> 01:37:32,395
It'll probably take you as long as it
takes me to read your homework, so...

1303
01:37:33,907 --> 01:37:35,498
Let's go.

1304
01:37:50,355 --> 01:37:51,788
How do you spell that?

1305
01:38:08,574 --> 01:38:11,135
"The morning it all began,

1306
01:38:11,211 --> 01:38:13,440
began like any other morning.

1307
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:16,003
Charles was running late,

1308
01:38:16,082 --> 01:38:19,051
and as a result,
he missed his regular train.

1309
01:38:29,162 --> 01:38:31,061
Championship fucking.

1310
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:32,994
Twelve rounder.

1311
01:38:33,065 --> 01:38:35,533
I need a loan, Charlie.

1312
01:38:37,904 --> 01:38:40,235
Charles had made him kill.

1313
01:38:40,305 --> 01:38:42,796
Charles was to blame.

1314
01:38:42,876 --> 01:38:45,367
He was a murder suspect.

1315
01:38:45,444 --> 01:38:48,436
Lucinda turned out to be
this whole other person.

1316
01:38:48,514 --> 01:38:50,105
Charles wiped his prints

1317
01:38:50,182 --> 01:38:53,550
and ran away like he was never there,

1318
01:38:53,619 --> 01:38:56,612
back to his shitty little life.

1319
01:38:56,689 --> 01:38:59,213
But when he finished reading the story,

1320
01:38:59,292 --> 01:39:01,988
he went to the laundry room."

1321
01:39:26,551 --> 01:39:29,247
- Yeah?
- I need to use the bathroom.

1322
01:39:29,322 --> 01:39:31,688
I'll alert the media.

1323
01:39:53,479 --> 01:39:55,810
You looking for a daddy?

1324
01:40:04,189 --> 01:40:06,283
What the fuck
you looking at, homey?

1325
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:09,260
Oooh...

1326
01:40:43,261 --> 01:40:46,230
I hope you liked my story.

1327
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:52,134
You never checked if I made it out
of that hotel alive, did you?

1328
01:40:52,204 --> 01:40:55,697
You're so
predictable, Charles.

1329
01:40:55,774 --> 01:40:57,902
It takes more
than one bullet to kill me.

1330
01:40:57,976 --> 01:41:00,309
Much more.

1331
01:41:05,784 --> 01:41:08,878
But you took something from me, Charlie,

1332
01:41:08,954 --> 01:41:10,889
and that ain't right.

1333
01:41:13,493 --> 01:41:15,393
It's my money.

1334
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:18,628
Fuck the money.

1335
01:41:18,698 --> 01:41:22,064
- You killed her.
- You're insane.

1336
01:41:25,837 --> 01:41:28,238
I loved her, Charlie...

1337
01:41:28,306 --> 01:41:30,570
...when you just wanted to fuck her.

1338
01:41:32,145 --> 01:41:34,078
What do you want?

1339
01:41:36,015 --> 01:41:37,845
I want you, Charlie.

1340
01:41:45,257 --> 01:41:48,158
I'm gonna fuck
with your life because I can.

1341
01:41:51,229 --> 01:41:52,355
By the way...

1342
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,060
...is your daughter still a virgin?

1343
01:42:00,338 --> 01:42:04,240
You don't know how happy I was
to see your name on those notebooks.

1344
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:06,778
It's like if you begged me to find you.

1345
01:42:06,845 --> 01:42:10,179
Man, you ended up
in the wrong prison, Charlie.

1346
01:42:10,248 --> 01:42:11,738
- LaRoche.
- Yeah?

1347
01:42:11,818 --> 01:42:13,842
I chose this prison.

1348
01:42:16,221 --> 01:42:17,552
Oh!

1349
01:42:56,996 --> 01:42:59,828
OK, Mr. Schine. You're free to go.

1350
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,867
You take it easy now.

1351
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:24,386
I met him
a few times a while ago.

1352
01:43:26,024 --> 01:43:28,118
Here he comes.
All right, thank you.

1353
01:43:37,336 --> 01:43:40,567
- What did you tell them?
- The truth.

1354
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:44,097
I went to use the bathroom,
and this guy jumped me with a shank.

1355
01:43:45,377 --> 01:43:49,144
Well, that guy
was the asshole who killed Winston.

1356
01:43:52,551 --> 01:43:55,543
He killed two people in Paris,

1357
01:43:55,621 --> 01:43:57,782
one in New York.

1358
01:43:57,856 --> 01:44:00,587
You expect me to believe
that you overpowered him?

1359
01:44:01,226 --> 01:44:02,716
I guess I got lucky.

1360
01:44:11,503 --> 01:44:14,496
You brought that shank in with you,
it's premeditated murder.

1361
01:44:16,274 --> 01:44:18,037
Law don't care who you kill.

1362
01:44:23,481 --> 01:44:25,972
I guess the law didn't care much
for Winston, either.

1363
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:27,207
Bye. See you guys later.

1364
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,577
OK, sweetheart.
