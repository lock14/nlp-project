00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,890
Way to hustle, Toby!
Wait! Look to pass!

5
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:37,207
Look to pass.. look...
Melissa's there.

6
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:38,338
Pass to your teammate!

7
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,258
In Del Rio, Texas,
saturdays were all about soccer.

8
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:44,246
Fresh cut oranges,

9
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:46,123
- screaming parents,
- Defense.

10
00:01:46,263 --> 00:01:47,768
cheecy uniforms...

11
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,210
- teamwork and winning.
- Good goal, nice goal.

12
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:55,259
I used to live for those games...
and then one day,

13
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,188
I just stopped caring.

14
00:01:58,194 --> 00:02:00,783
That's alright. Good game.
Good game, girls.

15
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:12,570
- It's okay Toby.
- No, it's not.

16
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,024
It's just a game.

17
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,199
You can't always believe
everything my dad says.

18
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:22,001
He might pretend it's...
all about how you play the game,

19
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:24,842
but trust me
he likes to win.

20
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,381
Hey, get your gringo hands
off my cousin.

21
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:32,229
Casper. Oh girls, this weeks practice
the sheriff's gonna bring pizza.

22
00:02:34,057 --> 00:02:36,145
Shh.
Acting sheriff.

23
00:03:03,872 --> 00:03:05,181
Hey, good game today, hombre.

24
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:06,959
Yeah, they...
they played well.

25
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,150
But you know,
we'll get them next time.

26
00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:13,032
What do I owe you?
Hot dogs are ready!

27
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,055
Oh, coach, this is on me.

28
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:17,306
Oh.

29
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:18,996
Thank you.

30
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:21,350
You're a good man, Hector.

31
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:32,206
Here we go.
Hot dogs all around.

32
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:38,909
- Where's Toby?
- Uh... I don't know...

33
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:41,299
I don't know,
she's around here somewhere.

34
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:43,643
- You want me to find...
- No, I'll find her.

35
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:59,444
Oh! Sorry.
Sorry about that.

36
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,766
Girls are gonna go
all the way, coach.

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,582
Regionals, nationals,
mundial.

38
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:10,751
Well, we, uh... just gotta get...
we just gotta get through the season.

39
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,391
Toby, get away from there.

40
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:12,514
You will never ever
come back here again, okay?

41
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,310
Dad, this stuff
is kinda cool.

42
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:18,334
Trust me, that stuff
is anything but cool.

43
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:20,886
But Melissa says you can pray
for anything there,

44
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:22,913
even for things you'd
never ask the Virgin for.

45
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,213
Hey!

46
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,839
Anything you wanna talk about?

47
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,798
You are a young woman.

48
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:36,105
Your mother in heaven
would be so proud of you.

49
00:06:44,231 --> 00:06:45,826
Toby, you in there?

50
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:48,858
- Y... yeah, Dad.
- Okay.

51
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,110
After today,

52
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,170
nothing in your life
will ever be the same again.

53
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:55,441
- You both in there?
- Yes.

54
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,329
What are you guys doing?

55
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:00,574
Jack, sweetie,
give us a minute, okay?

56
00:07:00,574 --> 00:07:02,678
- Alright, alright.
- God, dad.

57
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:08,314
Period.

58
00:07:09,754 --> 00:07:11,999
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

59
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:17,754
Well, at least
you still play video games.

60
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,365
Dad, no.

61
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,165
Okay, I'm sorry.

62
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,084
No.

63
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:26,129
Okay, fine.
Go.

64
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:29,987
The witch is coming.

65
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,947
On nights like this,
my father used to say...

66
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,608
Which means?

67
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:56,286
It's so foggy
that even the ghosts...

68
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,747
need candles.

69
00:08:02,435 --> 00:08:04,745
I hope Toby
remembers me that way.

70
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,937
She will.

71
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,497
Some things
you never forget.

72
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,480
Yeah.

73
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,134
That's not what I meant.

74
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,160
That's what I meant.

75
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,360
I love you, mommy.

76
00:09:13,822 --> 00:09:15,072
Good night.

77
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,786
Eye on the prize, baby.
Eye on the prize.

78
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,907
So as we look at
this years budget,

79
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,544
I'm reminded
of a little credo...

80
00:09:55,546 --> 00:09:58,048
we follow here at
Del Rio Savings & Loan.

81
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:02,085
As Yogi Bear used to say,
A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore".

82
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:08,062
- It's Yogi Berra.
- Oh, dad, same thing.

83
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,158
It's okay, honey,
it sounded really good.

84
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:12,616
- It did?
- Yeah.

85
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,903
It sounded really good
at breakfast.

86
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:16,885
It sounded really good,
last night.

87
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,647
Dad!

88
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:43,211
- Take it off.
- No no. No, dad, it's just lipstick.

89
00:10:43,248 --> 00:10:45,346
Yeah, and the next thing you know,
it's just a nose ring.

90
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,495
Jack!

91
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:51,900
Sorry dear, you're gonna
have to stick to lip gloss... for now.

92
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,721
- See? That's better.
- For you, maybe.

93
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,951
I'll see you at practice.

94
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:26,312
Anyway, as Yogi Berra used to say,
"A nickel ain't worth a dime anymore".

95
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,698
Yeah, well,
I think that's it, so...

96
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,995
let's, uh... stop yapping
and start mingling.

97
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,143
Thank you.

98
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,484
Thank you.

99
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,096
Thank you.
Thank you.

100
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,349
Come see me at the bank.

101
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:08,960
Hey!

102
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,508
Sorry I'm late.

103
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:11,551
Hey, coach.

104
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:18,067
What's going on?

105
00:12:19,548 --> 00:12:21,530
- It's Toby... we can't find her.
- What?

106
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,162
We were kicking some balls around
and she lost hers over there somewhere.

107
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,837
When she didn't come back,
we looked for her a long time.

108
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,359
Jesus, I told you, you gotta keep
an eye on the girls, when I'm not here.

109
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,365
- I know, I know.
- There must be some explanation, Jack.

110
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,024
She's probably gone home,
because she doesn't feel well.

111
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,405
Yeah, well, we've been looking.

112
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:36,110
- We went all the way down to the river...
- Where's Melissa?

113
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,082
- Melissa's right over there.
- Okay.

114
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,418
Well, she might have
gone to Heather's place..

115
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,230
- Look, Jack...
- Hang on, hang on.

116
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,768
There's no answer at home.

117
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,642
Hey, Jack listen,
look, we found the ball...

118
00:12:45,644 --> 00:12:47,625
Where exactly
did the ball go over the fence?

119
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,250
- Right over there.
- Okay, thank you.

120
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:53,072
- Now look, maybe we...
- She's gonna be fine, Hector, okay?

121
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:54,299
We had a little spat this morning,

122
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:56,577
she's probably just hiding down here
to pay me back.

123
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,749
Yeah, my Carmen's the same way.

124
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,587
Alright, just keep going down!

125
00:13:07,613 --> 00:13:09,802
I'm going back to the parking lot.

126
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:15,847
Toby! Toby!

127
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,958
Wade across to the other side!

128
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:26,427
Hey, look at this!

129
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,471
Gracias.

130
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:21,104
If somebody's taken her, I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just don't know.

131
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:22,911
- Sweetie...
- She wouldn't just disappear like this.

132
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,072
- Not for this long.
- It's only been a couple of hours.

133
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:27,355
Toby will be okay.

134
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:30,554
That's easy for you to say,
she's not your daughter.

135
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,908
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

136
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,994
- I just...
- I know.

137
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:43,219
- I just, uh...
- I know.

138
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,923
Any... any footprints?

139
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,114
Two sets.
Dogs tracked them up...

140
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:48,575
to the parking lot,
then they disappear.

141
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:51,703
- Forensics is checking it out now.
- Okay.

142
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:54,245
Right, uh...
um... keep me posted.

143
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:57,134
Sheriff, Department of Public Safety
returning on line two.

144
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,107
- Sex offenders.
- Oh.

145
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:04,106
Hey, uh... Navarro here,
I was wondering if you all could...

146
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:07,861
fax over an updated list
of the registered sex offenders in, uh...

147
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,505
in like a 100 mile radius?

148
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,163
How about I send a file.

149
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,326
- Great, thanks.
- No problems.

150
00:15:15,537 --> 00:15:18,184
What... what is all this?
What am I signing?

151
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,534
This is the department's
press release,

152
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:24,688
And this next one... is an official
request for additional deputies.

153
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,749
Sir, they're here.

154
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:33,631
Hey, Mindy.

155
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,644
what would, uh... Sheriff Fernandez do
in a situation like this?

156
00:15:39,884 --> 00:15:41,360
You're doing fine, sir.

157
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,177
- How old is Toby?
- Eleven.

158
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,866
- How old is Toby?
- She'll be twelve in April.

159
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,290
Gray sweatpants
and a T-shirt.

160
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,626
- What?
- I think it was pink.

161
00:15:50,686 --> 00:15:52,284
Why would she run away?

162
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,393
Any history of drug
or alcohol abuse?

163
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:56,062
- Toby? No, never.
- Are you sure?

164
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:58,592
- What about her friends?
- Toby doesn't do drugs.

165
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,534
- How do you know?
- How do I know? She's my daughter.

166
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:02,061
- That's how I know?
- What about Toby's mother.

167
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,860
- Does she have a family?
- She's an orphan..

168
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:07,302
When she was a baby.
Toby's biological mother died of cancer.

169
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:09,756
- She's dead.
- Casper introduced us.

170
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:12,245
- We've been married three years.
- Toby was our flower girl.

171
00:16:12,245 --> 00:16:15,086
She was born at Saint Margaret's.
It's in Oklahoma City.

172
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,447
Do you have a criminal record?

173
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,407
- No.
- Bar fights?

174
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:21,863
- Anyone you might have pissed off?
- No, Not... no no. Nothing.

175
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,625
- Ever fight in front of your child?
- Do you ever hit your wife?

176
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:25,789
What the fuck?

177
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:28,321
- What about Toby? You ever hit her?
- Do you ever cheat on your wife?

178
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:31,106
- Ever cheat on your husband?
- No, I don't cheat on my wife.

179
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:33,974
This is Karen De La Rosa
from the Victims' Assistance Unit.

180
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:35,432
Hello.

181
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:38,131
Now, before we head up there,
you should know...

182
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,322
that if somebody did take Toby,

183
00:16:40,357 --> 00:16:43,446
whoever that is
may be watching this broadcast.

184
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,331
It's important to be clear
and mention specifics.

185
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:48,671
<i>- Mr. and Mrs. Bishop, did she run away,
- Now I know this is...</i>

186
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,445
<i>- hard to face.
- or do you think somebody took her?</i>

187
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:08,605
Toby, if...

188
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:13,659
Toby, if you are watching this
right now...

189
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:17,186
we love you,

190
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,836
come on home.

191
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:29,105
Please, uh... whoever you are,
if you have our Toby, just...

192
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,528
just please
send her home to us.

193
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:38,829
Please, God, find Toby...

194
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,811
and lead her
back home safely...

195
00:17:40,813 --> 00:17:42,064
to her loving family.

196
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:46,191
- In the name of the Father...
- Honey, you there?

197
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,548
Sorry.

198
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:58,270
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

199
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,045
- Amen.
- Amen.

200
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,183
- Thank you all for coming.
- Thank you.

201
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:04,644
- God bless you.
- Thank you, father.

202
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,940
Gracias, Padre, and thank you
for organizing the prayer chain.

203
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:11,505
It means a lot to us.

204
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:14,420
I want you both to know
the church is here for you.

205
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:18,886
Padre, I...

206
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:20,749
we feel so helpless.

207
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:23,355
Is there anything else
we should be doing?

208
00:18:24,493 --> 00:18:26,076
Trust in the Lord.

209
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,266
Whatever happens,

210
00:18:29,134 --> 00:18:30,744
its Gods will.

211
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:54,615
Yikes!

212
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,924
What is that?
Jess Lien's work?

213
00:18:58,067 --> 00:19:02,049
No sir... Jess was strictly boys,
if you know what I mean.

214
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,656
What about old Fred Walker.

215
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:09,712
No, he's still
serving time upstate.

216
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:13,529
These girls here are victims
of Redd Holden.

217
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,404
He's registered
in Lone Eagle.

218
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,994
Should we visit him?

219
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,347
That's him.

220
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:04,951
- Hey, Redd.
- Oh, Jesus.

221
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,351
- Long night?
- What I that now?

222
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,681
Yeah, just top it off.

223
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:17,933
That's good.

224
00:21:18,663 --> 00:21:20,434
Hey, Mary Alice,
what's going on in there?

225
00:21:20,784 --> 00:21:23,471
Now, Roy, you know, you're not
gonna get anything out of me.

226
00:21:23,593 --> 00:21:24,740
Come on.

227
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:27,558
Rooted in Tupeto
a slum of Mexico City,

228
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:31,688
Santa Muerte is a centuries-old mix
of pagan rituals and Catholicism.

229
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:35,142
Mexican police say it is popular
with prostitutes and drug dealers.

230
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,785
Several recent revenge killings
have been connected to the sect.

231
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:42,444
The Catholic Church condemns
Santa Muerte as devil worship.

232
00:21:42,445 --> 00:21:45,144
But despite the Church's best efforts,
the cult is growing.

233
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:48,682
So, what do you think?

234
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,819
No alibi,
a rap sheet a mile long...

235
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:58,201
what do you think I think?

236
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,213
24-hour surveillance?

237
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:02,509
Right.

238
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:05,534
We have to know

239
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:32,176
Any news?

240
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,223
No.

241
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:50,192
There's this old woman
just across the border in Mexico.

242
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:55,198
My grandma used to take me
to see her when I was little.

243
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,183
She sees things.

244
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,564
- Come on, Amaya.
- Come on what?

245
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:06,489
These... these people,
they just... they just...

246
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,262
they just tell you
what you wanna hear.

247
00:23:08,362 --> 00:23:09,490
How do you know?

248
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:12,515
Have you ever actually
gone to someone like that?

249
00:23:14,943 --> 00:23:19,257
- No.
- Well... what if she can help?

250
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,532
I mean...

251
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,929
What have we got to lose?

252
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:28,821
I'm just... You know, I'm just gonna
leave this conversation right here.

253
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:29,949
Hey, wait, wait.

254
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,635
Let me get this straight.

255
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:35,925
You want to leave this to God's will,
like Father Salinas said?

256
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:45,525
Or do you want
to do something about it?

257
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,752
Oh, no no!

258
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:30,411
Madre will see you now.

259
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,662
She said that
I'm not Toby mother.

260
00:26:29,699 --> 00:26:33,397
What?
That's it?

261
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,512
She wants your hand, sweetie.

262
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:22,278
Gracias, Dońa.
Gracias.

263
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:34,285
- That was a waste of time.
- Honey, she saw something.

264
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:37,030
Whatever she saw,
she didn't see Toby.

265
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:44,545
God damn it,
I can't even park in my own place...

266
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:47,883
As long as I've got
two men coming in...

267
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:54,973
Come on!

268
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,079
- Casper.
- Jack, um...

269
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,422
this is the special agent Wilson,
special agent Nakamura.

270
00:29:18,913 --> 00:29:20,752
They're gonna take over
from here on in.

271
00:29:20,788 --> 00:29:22,336
- What about you?
- We're still on the case,

272
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:25,769
it's just that the FBI is gonna be
spearheading the investigation.

273
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,761
Sir, uh... what can you do
what the sheriff can't?

274
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:31,663
Well, ma'am,
agent Nakamura and myself...

275
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:34,270
have over 20 years combined
experience in these type of cases.

276
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:37,143
Now...
we have a few questions.

277
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:47,372
To look at her, you never would've known
Toby's mother was even sick.

278
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,028
She was very pretty.

279
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:54,443
We understand that
the last time you saw Toby...

280
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,799
you were arguing.

281
00:29:57,219 --> 00:30:01,038
- I mean, she's... she's 11.
- But she left angry?

282
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,104
Yes, but that's not unusual.

283
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,083
I mean, you guys have kids, right?

284
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,894
Then you know what it's like.

285
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:23,542
What about work? Anyone that you
may have denied a loan to?

286
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:25,424
You can't approve every loan,

287
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:27,406
but I think the system's
more then fair.

288
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:31,707
I mean, I can't...
I can't imagine anyone, no.

289
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:36,874
So there's... no one you can think of
who might have a vendetta against you?

290
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:39,980
Well, if they do,
it's news to me.

291
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:48,978
Hello?

292
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,300
They found something.

293
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,027
We just got this in this morning,
one of the parents had a video camera.

294
00:35:48,168 --> 00:35:50,197
Does anything look unusual to you?

295
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,659
No.

296
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,588
No, that's Heather's dad
and Peggy's mom.

297
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,661
What about that big guy
in the back there?

298
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:02,603
No, he's fine...
Melissa's uncle.

299
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:05,650
Could you back it up,
um... please, sir?

300
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:10,199
There...

301
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:13,710
that white van
in the parking lot.

302
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:18,916
Didn't Redd Holden drive a white van?

303
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,235
- No sign of the girl!
- Who's Gomez?

304
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:25,697
You are?

305
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,809
You were told to have this place
under 24-hour surveillance.

306
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:33,128
Serously, I was only gone,
or like 5 minutes.

307
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:35,318
That's all it takes, asshole!

308
00:36:35,353 --> 00:36:36,501
- Wilson!
- What?

309
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,067
You gotta see this.

310
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:51,726
Great, check it.

311
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,735
I... I don't understand,
how could this happen?

312
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:07,717
- Jack.
- No, no, no.

313
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,878
How... how could you just
let him go like that?

314
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,173
He was supposed to be
under 24-hour surveillance.

315
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,385
Unfortunately, mistakes
were made on the local level...

316
00:37:14,387 --> 00:37:16,681
- before we got here.
- Oh, you can say that again.

317
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:18,360
A real sheriff
wouldn't let that happen.

318
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:20,103
That's not fair.

319
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,958
Casper inherited those deputies
when Hernandez died.

320
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:27,829
Besides... we don't even know
if this guy has Toby.

321
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,376
Oh, this is the guy
that took her.

322
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:31,775
This is the guy that has Toby,
I know it.

323
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,275
Look, I can assure you both, we have
everything we need on the suspect.

324
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:37,371
He won't slip through
our fingers again.

325
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:40,465
I have one more question.

326
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:44,554
We're having a hard time finding your
first wife Katie's death certificate.

327
00:37:44,592 --> 00:37:46,481
Do you happen to have a copy?

328
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:47,942
No.

329
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,753
Do you remember the name
of the hospital where she died?

330
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,916
- Saint Margaret's.
- What about the funeral home?

331
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,172
Uh... give me a sec, um...

332
00:37:58,112 --> 00:37:59,989
Do you remember
where she was buried?

333
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:03,516
No, uh... no.

334
00:38:05,081 --> 00:38:08,313
You don't remember where
your first wife was buried?

335
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:10,856
No, I... can't...
can't you just look it up?

336
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:11,934
We tried.

337
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,548
Well, I don't know what to say,
um... try harder.

338
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:56,987
Bueno.

339
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:03,347
Josefina, telefono!

340
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:08,250
Josefina!

341
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,157
Bueno.
Si, Josefina.

342
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:50,077
Come on!
Go!

343
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,259
You know this guy?

344
00:40:57,817 --> 00:40:59,315
No, why?

345
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,148
We missed it the first time,
I took a second this morning.

346
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:06,045
Nobody seems to know who he is.

347
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:11,742
You know,
I have seen this guy before.

348
00:41:12,056 --> 00:41:14,454
He was at the town aqoare
a couple of days back...

349
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:16,891
playing loteria
with some friends.

350
00:41:17,135 --> 00:41:18,161
- You saw him?
- Yeah,

351
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:21,010
he made some joke about the girls
going to the World Cup or something.

352
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:26,018
He talked real fast,
sounded like a Yaqui.

353
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:28,686
- Yaqui?
- From Sonora, Yaqui Indian.

354
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:31,324
Yeah, I know who they are.

355
00:41:35,414 --> 00:41:36,822
I'll get this printed up.

356
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:39,327
I'll fax it down
to a buddy of mine in Mexico,

357
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:41,753
see what he can dig up.

358
00:41:48,902 --> 00:41:50,835
10 dollars on number 12.

359
00:41:52,601 --> 00:41:55,356
Ho-ho! Awesome ride
you got there, dude.

360
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:57,427
My old man used to have one
just like it.

361
00:41:57,427 --> 00:41:59,409
What's that,
a Tradesman 200?

362
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,456
Ernesto Huerta...
better known as Calvo.

363
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,572
Our guy's got quite a record.

364
00:42:24,664 --> 00:42:28,005
I may need to cross the border,
you wanna come with?

365
00:42:30,135 --> 00:42:31,735
Just the two of us?

366
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:33,934
Yeah, well, the FBI's got a lot
on their plate right now.

367
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:37,231
Besides... they don't have
any pull where we're going.

368
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:40,342
You know, that was
a good call back there...

369
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,221
you know,
the Yaqui thing.

370
00:42:43,106 --> 00:42:45,489
Especially for a guy
who doesn't speak any Spanish.

371
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:49,382
Anita from the bank,
her, uh... husband's Yaqui.

372
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:50,920
Yeah?

373
00:42:51,963 --> 00:42:53,318
I thought he was Guatemalan?

374
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:55,317
Nope, Yaqui.

375
00:43:45,427 --> 00:43:46,782
Alright, alright, Lumi.

376
00:43:46,782 --> 00:43:49,675
You gotta go before
I write you another citation.

377
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,748
Adios, Chief Detective.

378
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,215
Hey, oh, this is my, uh...
cousin's husband, Jack.

379
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:06,677
Ah, si, si, I'm sorry
to hear about your daughter.

380
00:44:06,922 --> 00:44:10,150
Casper tells me that you're looking
-for a Yaqui from Calvo.

381
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:11,856
You've come to the right place.

382
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:15,617
Can't toss a dwarf in Acuna
without hitting a Yaqui.

383
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,456
Come on, follow me.

384
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:32,092
Roberto?

385
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,177
Ha sido un tiempo.
żComo estas?

386
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:36,884
- No, yo no hablo Espańol.
- Yo estoy Carolina,

387
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,052
- from the house in Tempe...
- I'm sorry, I... I don't know you.

388
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:41,342
I'm sorry.

389
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:49,764
I'm gonna need two
for like, later on, alright?

390
00:44:49,974 --> 00:44:51,224
They're ready.

391
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:55,878
- Ah, Detective Sanchez.
- Canta.

392
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:59,445
My American friends here
are looking for a girl.

393
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:01,713
Uh, uh, uh, you know
we don't sell girls here.

394
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:03,847
- Not that kind of girl.
- His daughter.

395
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:06,568
She was kidnapped
a couple days ago in Del Rio.

396
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:10,094
Oh, kidnapped.
She's pretty.

397
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:11,706
And this...

398
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:16,608
this is our suspect,
Calvo Huerta.

399
00:45:18,364 --> 00:45:20,293
Doesn't ring any bells.

400
00:45:22,402 --> 00:45:23,949
Well, I'm gonna leave it here...

401
00:45:24,994 --> 00:45:27,079
in case any bells
start to ring.

402
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:32,626
Hey!
Does anybody work here?

403
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:35,130
Hello!

404
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:42,163
<i>Suspect in the apduction
earlier this week...</i>

405
00:46:42,164 --> 00:46:44,144
<i>of the 11-year-old Toby Bishop.</i>

406
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:47,318
<i>The suspect is a
convicted sex offender...</i>

407
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,572
Be right there, bud.

408
00:46:49,753 --> 00:46:53,090
<i>He was last seen
driving a white van,</i>

409
00:46:53,126 --> 00:46:56,394
<i>- licence plate number 6-7-0...

410
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,438

- Here you go.

414
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:21,088
You want any, uh...
ketchup or hot sauce with that?

415
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:23,072
No.

419
00:47:34,429 --> 00:47:36,903
You all have so many
cute pictures of Toby,

420
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,521
but I haven't seen a picture
of Jack when he was little.

421
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,237
Or even you
for that matter.

422
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:45,789
Don't you get a day off?

423
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:47,639
Usually Mondays,

424
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,514
but the county does let me stay
with the families, as long as I'm needed.

425
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,045
And I also wanna make sure that I'm doing
everything that's necessary, just...

426
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:55,846
Karen, give us a minute, please?

427
00:47:55,847 --> 00:47:57,827
- Oh, yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

428
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,121
What the hell is this?

429
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:09,110
I picked it up in front
of the place downtown.

430
00:48:09,565 --> 00:48:11,807
- You know, that old bakery?
- Yeah.

431
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,675
What were you doing down there?

432
00:48:13,677 --> 00:48:16,074
Everybody at the rosary
was talking about it.

433
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,644
And I just... wanted to see
what it was all about.

434
00:48:20,657 --> 00:48:24,543
So much of this suff...
is about revenge.

435
00:48:26,126 --> 00:48:27,168
Hey...

436
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,619
you don't wanna get
mixed up with that stuff.

437
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:36,318
Have you ever thought
what you'd do...

438
00:48:36,356 --> 00:48:39,682
if you were face to face
with the people who took Toby?

439
00:48:42,108 --> 00:48:43,655
Face to face?

440
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:48,255
I'd kill them.

441
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:04,224
Where is she?

442
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:06,552
Who?
Where's who?

443
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,210
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah,

444
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,985
how'd you get those fuckin'
scratches on your face?

445
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:11,340
Cover me.

446
00:49:18,387 --> 00:49:20,288
Does...
does this look familier?

447
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:24,637
No.
No, I don't think so.

448
00:49:24,672 --> 00:49:28,141
But Toby's always
trading things with Heather.

449
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:30,867
It could be hers.

450
00:49:32,356 --> 00:49:34,018
Is that... is that blood?

451
00:49:34,474 --> 00:49:38,666
We do not know, I'm gonna send it out
to the state lab and get it tested.

452
00:49:39,016 --> 00:49:40,143
They're pretty fast.

453
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:44,003
We should know someting
by to... by tomorrow.

454
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:47,757
Keep moving.

455
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:49,947
Jack!

456
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:51,722
Right this way.

457
00:52:02,983 --> 00:52:04,567
Wrong answer.

458
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:09,005
I told you, I ain't never seen
that girl before in my life.

459
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:14,989
- I told you...
- You remember these?

460
00:52:16,835 --> 00:52:19,398
The last time you were
a guest of the state, your, uh...

461
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:21,664
your buddies beat you so bad,

462
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:24,152
you spent 6 months
in the infirmary.

463
00:52:24,657 --> 00:52:27,530
You know that one call from me
will put you right back there, right?

464
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:30,760
When the DNA comes back,
we're gonna know everything.

465
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:34,818
So if I were you,
I'd, uh... come clean now...

466
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:36,295
and safe youself...

467
00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:39,318
another serious beating down the road,
you know what I mean?

468
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,217
Alright...

469
00:52:44,992 --> 00:52:48,451
I picked up a girl...
at a rest stop.

470
00:52:49,351 --> 00:52:50,677
She was a runaway.

471
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:53,806
She was...
pretty high on sometin'.

472
00:52:54,398 --> 00:52:55,742
And we had some fun.

473
00:52:56,994 --> 00:52:58,349
Then things got outta hand.

474
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:01,655
She scrached me,
then she run off.

475
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:03,932
But I didn't fuckin' kill her!

476
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:07,065
We need to talk.

477
00:53:07,065 --> 00:53:08,943
And I sure as hell
never seen this girl here.

478
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:37,304
Carolina?

479
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:15,001
Carolina.

480
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,032
Come on.
Come in here.

481
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,681
Tell mamma everything.

482
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:53,373
Hey! Quero.

483
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:55,420
This won't take long.

484
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:13,307
Thank you all for coming.

485
00:55:13,657 --> 00:55:15,996
As you know, we are here tonight
as a community...

486
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:18,708
to send a message of hope
to our...

487
00:55:18,744 --> 00:55:22,382
Isn't it funny
how people get all religious...

488
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,315
when things go wrong?

489
00:55:24,315 --> 00:55:26,715
guide our beloved Toby
back home...

490
00:55:26,777 --> 00:55:30,653
A vigil... with candles
and prayers was a nice idea...

491
00:55:33,074 --> 00:55:34,692
but what they didn't know...

492
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:38,655
was that there really are some things
you can't ask the Virgin for.

493
00:55:44,501 --> 00:55:48,358
Thank you.
Um... uh...

494
00:55:51,384 --> 00:55:56,623
First... I'd like to say that my
husband and I... are very grateful,

495
00:55:56,766 --> 00:56:03,032
for the huge... outpouring
of love... and support...

496
00:56:04,423 --> 00:56:06,717
- we've received these last few days.
- Guys...

497
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,675
please, we're in the middle
of a vigil.

498
00:56:08,711 --> 00:56:09,882
This won't take long.

499
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:14,103
The hospital you told us about,
Saint Margaret's,

500
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:16,103
burned to the ground
five years ago.

501
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:18,038
Not a sigle record left.

502
00:56:18,873 --> 00:56:21,793
Never could find that death certificate
of Toby's mother either.

503
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:23,847
You must have spelled
the name wrong.

504
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:25,777
Well, then we must have spelled
your name wrong too...

505
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,175
because couldn't find
your birth certificate.

506
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:31,824
No high school records,
college, bar taps, gas bills,

507
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,242
- not even a library card.
- We moved around a lot.

508
00:56:34,246 --> 00:56:37,108
Well, according to our research,
Jack Bishop didn't even exist...

509
00:56:37,108 --> 00:56:38,360
until about 10 years ago.

510
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,052
- I don't know what to say...
- Am I under arrest?

511
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,780
- No.
- Not yet.

512
00:56:47,025 --> 00:56:48,454
Then if you'll excuse me.

513
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:52,916
I think my husband
should say some words.

514
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:54,795
Jack?

515
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:01,710
- What was that all about?
- Just more questions.

516
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,114
Hey everyone.
I know Amaya... said it before,

517
00:57:11,115 --> 00:57:15,114
but, uh... thank you so much
for coming out.

518
00:57:15,114 --> 00:57:17,199
It... it means
so much to me...

519
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:21,108
that my family is in your hearts
and in your thoughts...

520
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:23,378
and in their prayers.

521
00:57:24,773 --> 00:57:26,695
Toby says I talk too much, so...

522
00:57:26,731 --> 00:57:29,840
tonight, uh... Toby's
gonna do the talking.

523
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,744
This is a little something
she wrote in 3rd grade.

524
00:57:36,893 --> 00:57:39,862
"Life is like a soccer ball"
by Toby Bishop.

525
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:45,086
Life is like a soccer ball.

526
00:57:45,643 --> 00:57:47,778
It sometimes gets scuffs...

527
00:57:49,067 --> 00:57:53,161
- You can't play to rough...
- Navarro here.

528
00:57:53,197 --> 00:57:56,014
- Casper.
- Oh, hey, what's up?

529
00:57:56,052 --> 00:57:57,016
Listen, amigo.

530
00:57:57,016 --> 00:57:59,032
I have a lead your gringo cousin
should check out.

531
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:00,393
You want me to come down?

532
00:58:00,429 --> 00:58:02,748
No, it'd be great if you, uh...
both could come down.

533
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:07,331
I'm kinda tied up right now,
we'll get there as soon as we can.

534
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,583
- Mm-hmm.
- You know,

535
00:58:08,603 --> 00:58:10,963
- in a couple hours.
- Well, the sooner the better.

536
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,643
Ah. Come on, come on.

537
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:45,112
Sorry about that.

538
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,686
Hey, Jack, do you remember...

539
00:58:48,686 --> 00:58:52,023
the youg lady that approached you
at La Paloma Blanca the other night?

540
00:58:52,268 --> 00:58:55,155
- No.
- A working girl.

541
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:58,119
I'm sorry.

542
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,414
No, she said she knew you
from somewhere.

543
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:06,253
Well, anyway,
she's dead.

544
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:10,985
Earlier this evening,
Carolina Sandoval was stabbed to death...

545
00:59:11,021 --> 00:59:12,766
in an abandoned church
on the edge of town.

546
00:59:12,766 --> 00:59:13,677
What are you saying?

547
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:15,746
Well, were you in that church tonight?

548
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:18,704
No.

549
00:59:19,018 --> 00:59:21,000
No, no, no, my husband...

550
00:59:21,034 --> 00:59:22,661
was with me in Del Rio...

551
00:59:22,697 --> 00:59:24,521
at the vigil for Toby.

552
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:27,500
I have a witness who says
she saw a gringo...

553
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:29,253
matching your husband description...

554
00:59:29,253 --> 00:59:32,172
inside Saint Dismas Cathedral tonight.

555
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,076
No, no, no,
it wasn't him.

556
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:37,934
Okay?

557
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,949
She's in the other room,
Why don't we just ask her?

558
00:59:51,865 --> 00:59:53,221
Hey, Quero.

559
00:59:54,474 --> 00:59:55,860
Do you know that woman?

560
00:59:56,686 --> 00:59:59,344
Amaya, I have never
seen her before in my life.

561
00:59:59,382 --> 01:00:01,947
You see? You see?
He doesn't know her.

562
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:05,059
Oh, no, no, you so sure about that, Jack?
What about this, huh?

563
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,637
You ever seen that before?

564
01:00:19,427 --> 01:00:22,373
Alright, I was there.

565
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,313
But I...
I don't know no Carolina.

566
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:26,440
What?

567
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:30,150
- Can I go now?
- Si, Lourdes, gracias.

568
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:32,195
Sorry, Papi.

569
01:00:36,056 --> 01:00:38,141
You didn't meet Carolina
for the first time the other night.

570
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:44,579
You knew her and I think you came
down here... wanting to see her.

571
01:00:44,983 --> 01:00:48,233
And then... something happened
and you killed her.

572
01:00:48,233 --> 01:00:49,695
- No, that's not true.
- Isn't that right, Jack?

573
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,101
- That is not the truth.
- Oh?

574
01:00:51,103 --> 01:00:53,396
That is not what happend.
I did not kill her, okay?

575
01:00:53,398 --> 01:00:56,342
I did come down to meet her,
but I did not kill her.

576
01:00:56,344 --> 01:00:58,813
I... I swear... I swear to you,
Detective Sanchez, I didn't...

577
01:00:58,813 --> 01:01:00,380
- Amaya, please listen... Listen...
- Don't touch me.

578
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:01,733
- Please, listen...
- Don't touch me.

579
01:01:03,612 --> 01:01:04,987
You gotta listen to me, Casper.

580
01:01:05,025 --> 01:01:07,108
Listen, my ass,
that's my cousin, Jack.

581
01:01:11,523 --> 01:01:13,735
Why don't you just start
from the beginning, Jack?

582
01:02:29,536 --> 01:02:31,170
Arrested?

583
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:36,443
He didn't do it, it's one of those...
wrong place, wrong time kinda things.

584
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:40,378
Guess the Mexicans
beat you to the punch.

585
01:03:08,373 --> 01:03:10,887
Oh hey, gringo!
Do you want some soup?

586
01:03:49,509 --> 01:03:52,190
Hey...
pretty lady...

587
01:04:18,742 --> 01:04:20,235
Hey, no touchy.

588
01:04:22,702 --> 01:04:24,128
He left early.

589
01:04:24,268 --> 01:04:25,358
You sure?

590
01:04:25,985 --> 01:04:27,967
Yes. He has to do books
in the morning.

591
01:04:28,373 --> 01:04:30,150
You want to give him
a message?

592
01:04:30,152 --> 01:04:33,778
Give him this. Tell him
I'll be at La Pantera Hotel.

593
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:41,634
No, this is not my husband.

594
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,952
I'm afraid it is, ma'am.

595
01:04:47,239 --> 01:04:48,699
Navarro.

596
01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:52,451
You're telling me
this Robert Wyley person...

597
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:55,342
- Wyler.
- Whatever.

598
01:04:55,855 --> 01:05:01,550
This Roberto person...
was born in Oklahoma,

599
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:05,355
but grew up in a casa
de putas in Tepito?

600
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,893
- A debt collecter?
- Yes.

601
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,110
No!

602
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:13,420
And a contract killer
for the Mexican mob.

603
01:05:13,507 --> 01:05:17,340
I don't care what your
Mexican informants say.

604
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:22,420
This man is not my husband,
I know Jack Bishop.

605
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:25,599
Jack Bishop doesn't exist.

606
01:05:25,612 --> 01:05:27,773
Looks like you guys are gonna
have to wait a little longer.

607
01:05:29,052 --> 01:05:31,413
Jack just escaped from jail
30 minutes ago.

608
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:53,471
Excuse me, ma'am.

609
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:55,076
Can I get a room?

610
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:00,641
Ma'am, I need a room.

611
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:04,809
10 dollars an hour.

612
01:06:04,943 --> 01:06:06,291
I'm gonna need it for the whole night.

613
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,442
Twenty.

614
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:02,895
Hey, Coach, I hear
you're looking for me.

615
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,675
Where's my daughter?

616
01:09:37,545 --> 01:09:39,150
Who do you work for?

617
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:47,676
I said...
who do you work for?

618
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:50,162
No one.

619
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:53,488
It's just another contract, gringo.

620
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,601
Where is she?

621
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:58,252
Fuck you!

622
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:03,168
I said where is she?

623
01:10:05,016 --> 01:10:06,072
Okay...

624
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:10,243
I'll tell...
I'll tell you, okay?

625
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:14,113
Your little daughter's
gonna be a slut.

626
01:10:19,596 --> 01:10:22,326
I was gonna safe her
for myself.

627
01:10:24,911 --> 01:10:27,037
She's... she's right here.

628
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:30,895
The lighthouse...
at the top of the hill.

629
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:35,997
You know what they do up there?

630
01:10:37,354 --> 01:10:39,662
It's a whorehouse.

631
01:15:42,596 --> 01:15:43,743
Roberto...

632
01:15:44,996 --> 01:15:46,332
where's Lorena?

633
01:15:48,314 --> 01:15:51,880
- You tell me, Katie.
- What're you talking about?

634
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:54,134
You kidnapped her.

635
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:58,305
The only kidnapper here is you.

636
01:15:58,461 --> 01:16:00,166
Don't fucking lie to me.

637
01:16:03,045 --> 01:16:06,393
Nobody gets to speak to me
like that in my own house.

638
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,502
- I know you have her.
- Stop saying that.

639
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:22,569
I woke up one morning
with no husband, no daughter,

640
01:16:23,023 --> 01:16:24,846
not even a fucking note.

641
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:26,484
I did what I had to.

642
01:16:27,354 --> 01:16:29,542
Yeah, you're a real saint.

643
01:16:31,539 --> 01:16:33,662
I didn't want her
to see the things I'd seen.

644
01:16:34,326 --> 01:16:39,470
Poor Roberto... you're still
that whiny little gringo...

645
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:42,958
who's junky whore of a mother
abandoned you in Mexico.

646
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:52,353
Just give me my daughter
and I'll go.

647
01:16:57,527 --> 01:17:00,381
- You're serious?
- I spoke to Calvo.

648
01:17:01,668 --> 01:17:02,672
Calvo?

649
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:04,655
Calvo told me you hired him.

650
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:07,590
- I don't know any Calvo.
- You're lying.

651
01:17:07,813 --> 01:17:09,960
Oh, that's good
coming from you.

652
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:16,947
Santa Muerte.

653
01:17:17,989 --> 01:17:19,762
You're not...
get out.

654
01:17:20,131 --> 01:17:21,993
I mean it,
please just go.

655
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:23,212
Just go.

656
01:17:23,212 --> 01:17:25,298
- Give her back to me.
- I don't know where she is.

657
01:17:25,543 --> 01:17:27,333
- I don't have her.
- Where is my daughter?

658
01:17:27,335 --> 01:17:29,573
Check every room in the house,
she's not here.

659
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:34,882
You don't have to do this.
No, please.

660
01:17:35,301 --> 01:17:38,011
You don't...
have to do...

661
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:39,577
this.

662
01:17:39,996 --> 01:17:41,037
Don't...

663
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:45,418
Seńora!
żEstás bien?

664
01:17:51,363 --> 01:17:54,073
You're bieng played, mi amor.

665
01:18:04,207 --> 01:18:06,292
żPuede abrir la puerta,
por favor?

666
01:18:10,463 --> 01:18:13,384
Seńora!
żestán bien allí?

667
01:18:27,356 --> 01:18:30,479
Amaya said that...
on my wedding day,

668
01:18:30,932 --> 01:18:33,555
my mother's spirit
would be right there beside me,

669
01:18:33,905 --> 01:18:35,724
as I walk down the aisle.

670
01:18:36,853 --> 01:18:39,057
I wasn't actually getting married.

671
01:18:39,899 --> 01:18:43,786
But that night...
I knew in my heart...

672
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:48,858
that my mother was with me...
every step of the way.

673
01:20:56,591 --> 01:20:59,921
Oh, death,
glorious death,

674
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:03,559
do not let me be
without your protection.

675
01:21:03,595 --> 01:21:06,314
Santa Muerte is one of us.

676
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:09,684
She walks with us,
she protects us.

677
01:21:10,367 --> 01:21:12,610
She will vanquish my enemies.

678
01:21:36,873 --> 01:21:38,997
I'm so proud of you, Toby.

679
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:44,774
And now it's the time you know
the truth about your mother.

680
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:56,872
Dońa.

681
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:06,569
Dońa.

682
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:52,122
Oh, God.

683
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:55,355
Forgive me.

684
01:23:55,356 --> 01:23:57,443
Oh, God.

685
01:23:59,421 --> 01:24:00,577
Show me.

686
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,270
Please show me the way.

687
01:24:09,618 --> 01:24:13,377
I don't think the ghosts...
will need candles tonight.

688
01:24:15,564 --> 01:24:16,506
Amaya.

689
01:24:18,385 --> 01:24:19,774
What're you doing here?

690
01:24:19,775 --> 01:24:24,931
Taking the light...
Fire in his eyes,

691
01:24:25,802 --> 01:24:27,668
darkness in your heart...

692
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:31,796
a crucifix falling.

693
01:24:32,422 --> 01:24:35,342
- The red curtains.
- This is Dońa story.

694
01:24:35,891 --> 01:24:36,877
The cord...

695
01:24:37,817 --> 01:24:40,841
strangling the lifeblood
from his body.

696
01:24:43,117 --> 01:24:44,899
Why are you telling me this?

697
01:24:45,743 --> 01:24:48,012
There was someone else
there that night...

698
01:24:50,884 --> 01:24:52,293
a little girl.

699
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:06,180
Look at the darkness in the eyes,
face to face and tell me what you see.

700
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:11,338
I see nothing.

701
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:21,500
He was a gambler...
but he was all she had.

702
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:26,274
And the girl...
was forced to watch...

703
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:28,935
while you and your bitch Katie...

704
01:25:29,599 --> 01:25:31,912
collected his debt in blood.

705
01:25:31,912 --> 01:25:33,060
No.

706
01:25:36,104 --> 01:25:38,206
I was there, Roberto.

707
01:25:46,712 --> 01:25:48,069
No.

708
01:25:48,382 --> 01:25:50,560
That's not me,
I am not that man.

709
01:25:51,203 --> 01:25:54,409
Pues...
I am that girl.

710
01:25:57,453 --> 01:25:59,726
You messed with
the wrong family, hermano.

711
01:26:05,694 --> 01:26:07,362
You're being played.

712
01:26:09,136 --> 01:26:11,475
You hired Calvo.

713
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:15,021
You took Toby.

714
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:20,783
You took my father...
the only man I ever loved.

715
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:22,378
What did you do to her?

716
01:26:22,623 --> 01:26:26,020
And now... I'm taking
the one you love.

717
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:54,811
No.

718
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:40,617
Eye on the prize, baby.
Eye on the prize.

719
01:28:49,351 --> 01:28:52,063
- Hey.
- Hmm.

720
01:28:58,945 --> 01:29:01,644
My dad thought
we were lucky to escape the fire.

721
01:29:03,033 --> 01:29:07,246
But Amaya had told me that...
neither of us was gonna die that night...

722
01:29:08,345 --> 01:29:11,841
and that one day,
when it was too late,

723
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:15,279
he would know everything.

724
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:33,061
Some people spend their
whole lives starting over...

725
01:29:34,045 --> 01:29:36,757
new towns, new jobs,
new friends.

726
01:29:38,563 --> 01:29:42,373
But no matter where you go...
or what you do,

727
01:29:43,537 --> 01:29:45,890
some things
you can never forget.

728
01:29:47,556 --> 01:29:51,015
And some things...
you can never forgive.

729
01:30:08,801 --> 01:30:11,609
Santa Muerte
will vanquish my enemies...

730
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:15,234
help me find
my mother's killer...

731
01:30:15,270 --> 01:30:17,636
and avenge her senseless death,

732
01:30:21,628 --> 01:30:23,833
however long it takes,

733
01:30:24,287 --> 01:30:26,503
however...
hard it may be,

734
01:30:26,644 --> 01:30:29,260
conquer him
who is conquering me...

735
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,590
like Jesus conquered
on the cross.
