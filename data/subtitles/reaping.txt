CONCEPCIÓN, CHILE

3
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:05,130
- No, thanks, buddy.
- Americans?

4
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,232
Yes.

5
00:03:57,118 --> 00:03:59,551
They're out of it.
It could be something in the air.

6
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,051
- Maybe now's a good time.
- Yeah.

7
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:26,806
Father Bonilla...

8
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:31,448
I am blind... help bring light to my eyes.

9
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,108
The guy has been dead 40 years.

10
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:38,420
A month ago,
the earthquake broke open his tomb.

11
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:59,973
No. Don't put that in her mouth.
You'll only make her more sick.

12
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:02,471
Tell her.

13
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,140
There is no cure here.

14
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:09,914
Your girl will not get well this way.

15
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,018
Only the Devil...

16
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:14,888
...would try and stop God's miracle.

17
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:16,721
What did she say?

18
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:18,727
She thinks you're the devil.

19
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,495
Tell her I don't believe in him either.

20
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:32,511
Ben, check this out.

21
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:35,814
What do you think's under here?

22
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,124
What is that?

23
00:06:39,947 --> 00:06:42,676
Yeah, well...

24
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,976
All right.

25
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:21,620
Katherine.

26
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:27,851
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:29,250
- Hey.
- It's okay.

28
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,226
Hey, hey, hey.

29
00:07:31,398 --> 00:07:35,595
Hey. Hey. Relax.
Hey. Buddy, buddy, relax.

30
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:37,736
Hey. All right. All right, relax.

31
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:42,840
Deep well injection.

32
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,742
That's what it's called when a factory
drops hazardous waste down a dry oil well.

33
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:51,213
This kind of illegal
underground disposal...

34
00:07:51,385 --> 00:07:55,480
...has been common practice
in Third World countries for years.

35
00:07:55,656 --> 00:07:58,954
In this case, ethanol and methanol...

36
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:03,721
...mixed with the aromatic compound
DMSO and benzene...

37
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,728
...seeped out after an earthquake...

38
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,266
...running off into the sewer system
below the monastery...

39
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:13,963
...the fumes of which has the dual effect
of preserving human tissue...

40
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:19,100
...and, if inhaled,
creating intense hallucinatory effects.

41
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,081
Throw in a population economically deprived
enough to believe in almost anything...

42
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:31,354
...and you've got yourself a miracle.

43
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:36,562
A miracle created by a greedy,
cost-cutting corporation.

44
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,822
Instead of providing cures
for the faithful...

45
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:42,695
...it provided them
with lungfuls of toxic waste.

46
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:48,900
This puts me at 48 miraculous
occurrences I've investigated...

47
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:52,806
...with 48 scientific explanations.

48
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,211
I'm sorry to say, the only miracle
is that people keep believing.

49
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,544
Have a great weekend.

50
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,812
- Go, Tigers.
- They need a miracle.

51
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:07,185
LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY

52
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:16,800
Professor, don't you have a TA
to help you carry that stuff?

53
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:20,531
I did, but once he got his master's,
they gave him an office next to mine.

54
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,072
Sounds like a bright guy.

55
00:09:22,243 --> 00:09:26,042
And forgetful. My class was looking
forward to their guest speaker.

56
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,146
Sorry about that. I had a thing.

57
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:29,542
What was her name?

58
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:34,309
Her name was Theresa
and we met in church.

59
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:38,520
For old time's sake.

60
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:39,885
Professor Winter's office.

61
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,655
Father Costigan.

62
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,024
- Yeah, hold on.
- No. No.

63
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,233
Michael. It's been a long time.

64
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,272
It's nice to hear your voice.

65
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,932
What's going on?

66
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:01,672
<i>I know how hard it is for you
to talk to me.</i>

67
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,948
To remember.

68
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:08,745
I want you to know that
that's why I stopped calling.

69
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:13,416
I thought you stopped calling me
because you hate what I've become.

70
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,060
<i>I could never hate you.</i>

71
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:17,788
Katherine, you're going to think
I'm crazy.

72
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,694
I have all these photos of you in Africa...

73
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:22,961
<i>...but...</i>

74
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:25,832
<i>But what?</i>

75
00:10:26,006 --> 00:10:29,304
In every photo I have of you,
your face is burnt.

76
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:31,443
It happened in front of my eyes.

77
00:10:31,612 --> 00:10:33,977
Wait. What happened?

78
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:37,514
I think God has sent me a message.

79
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:39,675
He wants me to warn you.

80
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:43,481
If God was gonna send me a warning,
he should have done it a long time ago.

81
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:47,786
I understand why you stopped believing.

82
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:51,054
You've lost so much.

83
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:54,893
But, listen, Katherine,
the burns in the photos...

84
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:57,559
Put together, they formed a pattern.

85
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:58,761
<i>- A pattern.
- Yes.</i>

86
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:02,135
An ancient symbol.
I believe you're in danger.

87
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:05,471
I am not in any danger and I'm
really sorry, but I have to go now.

88
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:10,139
They formed the shape of a sickle.
An upside-down sickle.

89
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:13,285
- I'm sorry, I can't do this. I have to go.
- Please, wait.

90
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:15,717
<i>- Bye, Michael.
- Don't hang up.</i>

91
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:38,306
Katherine, why don't you go find Sarah?

92
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,097
Katherine, this is Doug Blackwell.

93
00:12:07,274 --> 00:12:08,262
- Professor.
- Hi.

94
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,068
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- No.

95
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,302
Doug has a problem
you might help with.

96
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:15,242
- Could Doug explain on the way to class?
- Sure.

97
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,907
- Thank you.
- All right, buddy.

98
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,848
You've got three bike paths
and a quad to make your case.

99
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:22,009
Well, I'll try.

100
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:25,851
I'm from a place called Haven. A few miles
past Fausse Pointe in the bayou?

101
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,083
Sounds nice.

102
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,889
Yeah. Up until three days ago, yeah.

103
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:33,896
Some of the fellas were out fishing
on the river.

104
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:37,593
Water kind of went red on them.
Dark red.

105
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:39,704
- Like blood.
- That's what it looked like.

106
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:41,737
Still does, in fact.

107
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,138
And nobody knows what's causing it?

108
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,244
They put me in charge of finding out.

109
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:49,711
I teach science and math,
grade three through 12.

110
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:51,577
Kind of makes me the town brainiac.

111
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:54,686
Well, when I'm called in,
there's usually a religious angle.

112
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:56,879
Well, that's why I'm here.

113
00:12:57,057 --> 00:13:02,358
Some of the folks in town are worried
that this is a sort of plague.

114
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:04,120
As in Old Testament plague?

115
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:06,595
As in God, Moses, the whole deal.

116
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:09,132
They think there might be
more plagues on the way.

117
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:11,395
Heard a lot of Exodus
the last couple of days.

118
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,971
I could give 100 reasons
why your river's turned red.

119
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,402
Great. All I need is one.

120
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:19,534
Call TV stations. They'll round up 10
scientists begging to solve your problem.

121
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:22,010
No. Thank you.

122
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:24,240
Our town's the best secret
in the Bible belt.

123
00:13:24,418 --> 00:13:26,408
I'm not interested
in becoming a punch line.

124
00:13:26,587 --> 00:13:30,113
- I'm sorry. I wish that I could help...
- Professor.

125
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,280
They're blaming it on a little girl.

126
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,291
She found her brother dead on the river
the day it turned red.

127
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:37,622
Have they considered
the thing in the river?

128
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:40,197
They think she killed him.

129
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,561
They think she turned
the water into blood.

130
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,802
Girl's only 12 years old, Miss Winter.

131
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:18,859
Morning.

132
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:22,503
Did you sleep last night?

133
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,575
Yeah. Where are we?

134
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,837
Far enough that all I'm getting is this guy.

135
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:31,074
<i>Jesus is the food on your table
and the gas in your car.</i>

136
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:35,983
<i>He is the beer in your bottle
and the bullets in your gun.</i>

137
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:39,682
- You gonna be all right with this?
- I grew up in a place like this.

138
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,327
Every bump in the night's
a devil at the door.

139
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:47,626
Turn on the light, speak in a soft voice,
and they'll come right around.

140
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,565
Yeah, I meant because of the girl.

141
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,795
I'll be fine.

142
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:56,941
Thanks for asking, though.

143
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:01,804
Hi.

144
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:06,742
Yeah. Still no service?

145
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,719
All he wrote down
was 17 miles to the turnoff.

146
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,559
I'd rather talk to you anyway, over.

147
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:22,429
Well, ain't that sweet?

148
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:24,769
Copy.

149
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:00,471
Well, we're deep in it now.

150
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,934
I think it's kind of cute.

151
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:08,439
Sort of.

152
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,982
Hi. You must be the folks
from the college.

153
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:18,419
I'm Isabelle. They told me y'all would
start showing up right on about now.

154
00:16:18,592 --> 00:16:22,254
All right, well, come on, then.
Let's park this thing out of the sun.

155
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:32,059
I kind of have the catbird seat
from over there inside the store.

156
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:34,138
- Thanks for meeting us.
- Don't thank me.

157
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,797
You are doing us a big old favor.

158
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:39,444
I tell you, this town
ain't seen nothing like this.

159
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,273
The McConnell boy, then the river.

160
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:45,475
Well, we all swim in it. Hank.

161
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:48,779
Look, he's my eldest.
That's him over there with his daddy.

162
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:49,943
Hey, baby.

163
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:51,453
- Hey, how you doing?
- Fine.

164
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:56,425
He just bought himself a Ski-Doo.
Hadn't even got it wet yet.

165
00:16:57,731 --> 00:16:59,698
- How y'all doing?
- Good.

166
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:09,472
Don't y'all just love that sound?

167
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:12,133
- What is that it's made of?
- Fulgurite.

168
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:16,272
It's what happens to sand
when lightning strikes the ground.

169
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,110
You all must get a lot of lightning.

170
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:19,717
Most in three parishes.

171
00:17:19,886 --> 00:17:21,580
We've been selling chimes all over.

172
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:24,018
Soon there'll be a piece
of Haven everywhere.

173
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:26,181
You know, we're even thinking website.

174
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,050
Hey, Janet. How you holding up?

175
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:30,217
Hey, pud.

176
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,660
Hey, little man.

177
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,993
Church is this way. Come on.

178
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:36,957
See you.

179
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:40,902
We were only a week apart.
It's number two for the both of us.

180
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:42,631
Know what you're having?

181
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:44,207
Heck, doesn't matter to me.

182
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:46,367
- Morning.
- Morning.

183
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:48,012
You got kids?

184
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:51,415
No, I don't.

185
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,313
They must be upstairs.

186
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:54,475
They?

187
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:59,249
The town council. Doug, the mayor, and
whoever else ain't doing their real job.

188
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,222
Boys sure do love to act important.

189
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:03,156
We certainly do, ma'am.

190
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,321
- Can't have a field trip in a damn gym.
- Then we'll postpone.

191
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,727
Gonna get real suspicious...

192
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:11,097
They'll get suspicious if every kid
comes down with a staph infection.

193
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,259
Oh, hi.

194
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,427
- Mayor Brooks.
- Hi.

195
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,370
These are the folks
I was telling you about.

196
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:19,102
I'm hoping Katherine here
can help us with our problem.

197
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,212
I understand you're not
a Bible reader.

198
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:23,942
Well, I've read it.

199
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:26,814
Just don't put much stock in it.

200
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:28,283
Yeah.

201
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:33,515
Some folks just don't
wanna go to heaven.

202
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,426
Maybe it's time to look at your river.

203
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,266
It ain't getting any better.

204
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:16,225
When did the fish start?

205
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:19,428
This morning.
Bubbled up like farts in a bathtub.

206
00:19:19,606 --> 00:19:21,072
How far does it go?

207
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:24,266
That way, up to the channel.
And then down this way...

208
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:26,138
...almost half a mile to the dam.

209
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,473
- That could be your problem.
- How do you mean?

210
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,639
A dam gives pollutants
a place to build up.

211
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:34,877
Longer they're there,
the more toxic they get.

212
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:46,454
Is it blood?

213
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:49,926
You know, I wish I could tell you.

214
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:53,027
Never seen that before.

215
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,605
- Black's not even on the chart.
- Bad phenolphthalein?

216
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,504
- I hope not. It's the only we've got.
- Get more samples.

217
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:00,941
We'll overnight to the lab.
I'll get the waders.

218
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:47,285
Can't take it in any further. Too shallow.

219
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:51,795
Okay. We'll walk.

220
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:31,466
You gonna be all right
if I leave you alone?

221
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:34,128
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm loving life right now.

222
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:14,435
Katherine?

223
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:17,575
Easy there. You all right?

224
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:20,673
I'm fine. I just hit my head.

225
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:23,780
I saw a girl.

226
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,041
- What? Blond?
- Yeah.

227
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:27,378
Kind of thin?

228
00:23:28,521 --> 00:23:31,580
It's not how I figured
on you two meeting.

229
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:34,055
That's the girl everyone's worried about?

230
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:36,194
Loren McConnell.

231
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:41,128
We're not far from where her brother,
Brody, died.

232
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:43,793
They live out here?

233
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,666
And that's pretty much
how the rest of the town likes it.

234
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:53,010
- What's everyone have against these people?
- A single mom letting her kids run wild?

235
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,080
- Doesn't exactly fit the town's
self-image. - Where's the father?

236
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:00,707
Brody's dad drove his truck
off the causeway.

237
00:24:00,887 --> 00:24:02,751
Loren's father was a traveling preacher.

238
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:05,446
Really? Covered wagon or a tent?

239
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:08,991
No, I think it was a Pontiac.

240
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:12,096
He only stayed around long enough
to leave her mom in a fix.

241
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,698
Folks been looking at her cross-eyed
ever since.

242
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:17,836
I haven't been out this way in a while.

243
00:24:18,004 --> 00:24:21,029
- Nobody has.
- What did this place used to be?

244
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:23,731
A haven. About a hundred years ago.

245
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:29,879
Until three hurricanes in three years
pretty much wiped it off the map.

246
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:33,213
They buried all their dead
in that mausoleum.

247
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:38,721
- Then they started over on higher ground.
- Thought you said no one came here.

248
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,129
Katherine?

249
00:25:58,304 --> 00:26:02,000
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah...</i>

250
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,142
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm close. Be right there.</i>

251
00:26:37,477 --> 00:26:39,944
I know I tend to jump to conclusions
on these things...

252
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:42,444
- Don't say it.
- Lf this town is thinking plagues...

253
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:45,777
...they got one closer.
- Don't you think it's early to go biblical?

254
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:48,681
Seeing I was waist-high in blood,
dodging dead frogs, no.

255
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:51,982
They died because the pH level
of the water was off the charts.

256
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:56,926
- We're gonna need to see the body.
- I'll call, see if I can arrange it.

257
00:26:57,096 --> 00:26:59,222
Is there any way
I can overnight these samples?

258
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:03,596
Sure. We got a post office in town.
I'll point it out on the way to my place.

259
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,758
Your place?

260
00:27:04,937 --> 00:27:06,665
Well, I hope you don't mind...

261
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:10,569
...but we don't have a motel here,
but I got two extra rooms all ready to go.

262
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:13,233
- I wasn't sure if you two were...
- No, we're not.

263
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:15,312
No accounting for taste.

264
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,539
- So that's okay?
- It's fine.

265
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:20,981
You wanna ride with me?
I can clean off the seat.

266
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:22,245
Sure.

267
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:26,187
Hey, Katherine, if you need me to
disappear so you can get acquainted...

268
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,952
...I can find a Stuckey's...
- Get those samples in...

269
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:30,560
...before it's too late.

270
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:33,289
- Your hair looks nice.
- Shut it.

271
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,933
What do you think?

272
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:47,910
It's probably Pfiesteria.

273
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:51,177
- Excuse me?
- Oh, it's a micro-organism...

274
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:53,910
...which gets lethal
under the right conditions.

275
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:57,954
Toxins bloom. Fish die.
Your river turns red.

276
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,787
Right.

277
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:05,129
You meant the scenery.

278
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:09,329
No, that's good. Very efficient.

279
00:28:09,502 --> 00:28:13,733
I have a tendency to miss the forest for...

280
00:28:13,906 --> 00:28:16,032
Literally.

281
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:23,738
It's beautiful.

282
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,507
From a ways off, maybe.

283
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:28,653
I've been trying to restore it
since my granddad gave it to me.

284
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:30,412
You must have been a good grandson.

285
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,454
Well, he didn't have a lot of choice.

286
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:36,355
I come from a long line of only children.

287
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:42,832
- I got it.
- Thanks.

288
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,499
This is a pretty big job for just one guy.

289
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:50,038
Yes, it is. Kind of.

290
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:55,003
I got it.

291
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,568
Katherine?

292
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:21,031
I got a bed set up in here.

293
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:23,470
- Thank you.
- It's not much.

294
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:26,133
No, it's great. Thanks.

295
00:29:26,312 --> 00:29:29,508
And I got a couch in the other room.
I thought Ben could use it.

296
00:29:29,682 --> 00:29:33,014
I hope he doesn't mind.

297
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,952
You folks really like these things. These.

298
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:46,162
Damn.

299
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:47,821
What?

300
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,796
My bracelet.

301
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:52,232
I must've lost it at the swamp.

302
00:29:52,405 --> 00:29:55,168
Was it valuable?

303
00:29:55,341 --> 00:29:56,534
Only to me, I guess.

304
00:29:58,411 --> 00:30:03,541
- It might be a little hard to find in the dark.
- It's okay, really. I'll live.

305
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:10,685
Maybe I'll look in the truck.

306
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:13,120
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

307
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:21,296
Well, I hope you like fish.

308
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:26,770
Well, where exactly
did you get the fish?

309
00:30:27,373 --> 00:30:29,772
Grocery store. Seafood section.

310
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:32,239
- Great.
- Oh, well, then, grill on.

311
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:36,278
- Oh, shit. I forgot the Tabasco.
- I'll get it. Ben needs a refill anyway.

312
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:40,078
Cupboard above the sink.

313
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:43,278
So I guess it's safe to say
you're a church-going man.

314
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,891
Oh, yeah. Ten years, every Sunday.

315
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:51,222
How's that fit with disproving miracles?

316
00:30:51,397 --> 00:30:54,092
You know, it's easy to lose faith.

317
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:58,131
Look at Katherine. If an ordained minister
can turn her back on God...

318
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,238
...then what hope is there
for the rest of us, right?

319
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:04,000
Plus, I think people
need to believe in miracles.

320
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:05,642
Find any real ones yet?

321
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:10,213
Yeah. Yeah.
Two semi-automatics, at 10 feet.

322
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:14,148
Punctured my liver, my kidneys, both arms.
Shattered my hip.

323
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,844
18th Street, when I was young,
doing dumb stuff.

324
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,887
Hell, I was still hooked to the IV
when they rolled me into court.

325
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:23,652
Yeah, I knew I was supposed to die.

326
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:25,989
I guess Katherine doesn't have
the same tattoos.

327
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:30,123
No, I keep telling her to get
a question mark right here, but no.

328
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:37,238
- Weren't you getting me a beer?
- Guess you didn't pray hard enough.

329
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:41,310
Well, the first wave's done.
I hope everybody's hungry.

330
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,880
Amen to that because I'm starving.

331
00:31:55,027 --> 00:31:56,823
Hey.

332
00:31:58,064 --> 00:32:00,759
Yeah, sure. I'll ask.

333
00:32:01,701 --> 00:32:03,759
We'll be right over.

334
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:05,903
That was Cade.

335
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:08,596
Jim Wakeman says his cattle
are acting strange.

336
00:32:08,774 --> 00:32:11,333
- Well, did he call the vet?
- Can't until tomorrow.

337
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,568
Is their place close to the river?

338
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:15,303
About half a mile.

339
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:19,143
- Might be worth a look.
- Yeah. I'll go get the stuff.

340
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:22,086
I don't know.
I mean, the maggots and the flies.

341
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:23,845
Where did they come from so fast?

342
00:32:24,023 --> 00:32:26,855
Katherine, do you still think this is?
What do you call it?

343
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:30,586
Pfiesteria. It makes the most sense.

344
00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:33,993
- Are we here yet?
- Yeah, farm's just up here.

345
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:38,798
- How many head of cattle do they...?
- Oh, God.

346
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:47,706
What the fuck was that?

347
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,516
Doug?

348
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,694
Shit.

349
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:44,834
Shit.

350
00:33:51,911 --> 00:33:54,606
Goddamn bull tore right through
my holding pen.

351
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:00,274
- Nearly gutted my boy before I got him clear.
- When did the cows start getting sick?

352
00:34:01,921 --> 00:34:04,821
At milking this morning
some didn't wanna give.

353
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,822
Now most of them can't even stand.

354
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:10,825
Seems like they're shriveling up.

355
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:15,329
Have you changed their food?
Give them any new supplements, hormones?

356
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:17,491
Ain't nothing like that.

357
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,261
All my cattle's corn- and hay-fed.

358
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:22,634
What about pesticides?
Could they have gotten into another field?

359
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:24,297
I did a line walk.

360
00:34:24,477 --> 00:34:25,841
Fences are all good.

361
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:28,604
Anyhow, there ain't any
growing farms around here.

362
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:30,042
Cows drink up to...

363
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:33,547
...12 gallons of water a day.

364
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,414
If whatever's contaminating the river
got into the water...

365
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:40,957
My animals get their water from a well.
Same as we do.

366
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:49,663
We're gonna go in.

367
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:04,245
This is getting a little hard
to ignore, Katherine.

368
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:09,710
We're four for four, chapter and
the verse. And I mean actual verse.

369
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:14,188
- Blood, frogs, flies, dead livestock.
- These cows aren't dead.

370
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:18,451
No, not yet. But from where I'm standing,
it looks pretty damn serious.

371
00:35:18,631 --> 00:35:21,997
God sent the plagues as warnings
to the Pharaoh to let his people go.

372
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:23,930
What is he supposed to be saying here?

373
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:25,763
Yeah, well, maybe it's not from him.

374
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:28,997
The Pharaoh's sorcerers used magic
to match God, plague for plague.

375
00:35:29,175 --> 00:35:32,473
- Evil against good.
- Who is responsible? Satan?

376
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:36,269
I didn't say that.

377
00:35:36,448 --> 00:35:40,076
I don't know, but what I do know
is that we are witnessing biblical events.

378
00:35:40,252 --> 00:35:41,616
All right.

379
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:43,151
- You wanna talk plagues?
- Yeah.

380
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:45,221
- Let's talk plagues.
- Okay.

381
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,791
In 1400 B.C., a group of nervous Egyptians
saw the Nile turn red.

382
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:50,222
Oh, God. Come on.

383
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:53,523
But what they thought was blood
was actually an algae bloom...

384
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:57,566
...which killed the fish, which prior to
that had been living off the eggs of frogs.

385
00:35:57,736 --> 00:36:01,000
Those uneaten eggs turned into
record numbers of baby frogs...

386
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:03,800
...who subsequently fled to land and died.
- Right.

387
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:06,876
Their little rotting frog bodies
attracted lice and flies.

388
00:36:07,046 --> 00:36:11,607
The lice carried the bluetongue virus,
which killed 70 percent of Egypt's livestock.

389
00:36:11,784 --> 00:36:16,345
The flies carried glanders, a bacterial
infection which in humans causes boils.

390
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:19,581
After, the Nile River Valley
was hit with a three-day sandstorm...

391
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:21,850
...otherwise known
as the plague of darkness.

392
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:24,494
- Katherine.
- During the sandstorm, heat can combine...

393
00:36:24,663 --> 00:36:28,530
...with an approaching cold front to create
not only hail, but electrical storms...

394
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:31,999
...which would have looked to the
Egyptians like fire from the sky.

395
00:36:32,171 --> 00:36:35,606
The wind would've blown the Ethiopian
locust population off course...

396
00:36:35,774 --> 00:36:37,400
...and right into downtown Cairo.

397
00:36:37,576 --> 00:36:39,440
Hail is wet, locusts leave droppings...

398
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,977
...spread both on grain,
and you've got mycotoxins.

399
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:45,513
Dinnertime in Egypt meant
the first-born got the biggest portion...

400
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:48,550
...which meant he ate the most toxins,
so he died.

401
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:51,518
Ten plagues. Ten scientific explanations.

402
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:55,452
Gotta wash up.

403
00:37:19,852 --> 00:37:20,840
Late night, huh?

404
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,214
Can't sleep.

405
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:25,549
I bet.

406
00:37:29,361 --> 00:37:31,487
Are those your cows?
The ones out there?

407
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:33,654
Of course.

408
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,759
Who's that with them?

409
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:39,198
Girl from before.

410
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:41,429
Before?

411
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:44,131
When she made the cows lie down.

412
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,869
Did you see her?

413
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:52,815
Hey, you know,
that's a really pretty picture.

414
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:54,952
Do you think maybe I could have it?

415
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,111
Okay. I'm drawing a fire truck now.

416
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,553
Thank you.

417
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:12,225
I let you handle things when
the McConnell boy died. Didn't I, Cade?

418
00:38:12,404 --> 00:38:14,598
- Yeah.
- And, Doug...

419
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:17,332
When that river turned to blood
where Loren found him...

420
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:19,703
...I let you handle it, didn't I?
- You did.

421
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:21,506
No one's done a damn thing.

422
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,739
Now this town's living in fear
waiting for the next plague to come.

423
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:27,976
If you're doing your job,
why am I looking at a man's livelihood...

424
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:32,179
...lying dead on the ground not two miles
from where the McConnells live?

425
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:36,521
Now, do I have to bring
this family in myself?

426
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:41,331
How did Brody McConnell die, sheriff?

427
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,093
- I don't know.
- What do you know?

428
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,964
Well, I got the call about 2.

429
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:50,039
The girl found Brody by the river
and he wasn't moving.

430
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:52,676
Which is where and how he was
when I got there.

431
00:38:52,845 --> 00:38:55,142
And there wasn't a mark on him.

432
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:58,441
Somebody just snuck up
and stole the life right out of him.

433
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:00,208
That doesn't mean Loren did it.

434
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:03,650
Loren, her mother...

435
00:39:03,822 --> 00:39:05,789
...or one of their degenerate friends.

436
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,551
There's something unnatural.
I want it stopped. Hear me?

437
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:11,786
Stopped before God ups and makes
an example out of this whole town.

438
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:14,090
What do you mean by "unnatural"?

439
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,964
It was Wake's wife what saw it.

440
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:22,797
Last Christmas...

441
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:27,439
...Brynn and some of the other ladies
brought cookies out to the McConnells.

442
00:39:27,613 --> 00:39:30,479
Community outreach or something.

443
00:39:31,316 --> 00:39:35,718
Brynn said when she got there, there
was a bunch of motorcycles out front.

444
00:39:35,888 --> 00:39:37,616
Then she heard some singing.

445
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,689
More like chanting.

446
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:42,018
Then she stuck her head in the window.

447
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:46,027
She saw something big
butchered in the sink.

448
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:48,795
It wasn't dead yet.

449
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:52,566
You didn't think to tell me?

450
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,864
It's a rumor.

451
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,939
The worst kind.

452
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:06,342
Brynn don't got the imagination
for it not to be true.

453
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:44,721
Father?

454
00:40:46,058 --> 00:40:47,718
Are you all right?

455
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:52,853
Yes. Thank you, Sister. I'm fine.

456
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:29,633
Come here.

457
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:42,312
There you go.

458
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,043
Katherine.

459
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,074
Doug?

460
00:44:04,923 --> 00:44:07,083
Hello?

461
00:44:12,631 --> 00:44:14,257
Doug?

462
00:45:44,689 --> 00:45:47,179
She seems like a good person.

463
00:45:48,393 --> 00:45:50,383
Katherine.

464
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:56,060
The power is out.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

465
00:45:56,234 --> 00:45:58,724
It's probably the breaker. I'll flip it.

466
00:45:58,904 --> 00:46:01,929
It's okay, really.

467
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,300
Take your time.

468
00:46:03,475 --> 00:46:05,237
At least let me buy you a drink.

469
00:46:10,148 --> 00:46:12,047
What is it?

470
00:46:12,217 --> 00:46:13,877
It's local.

471
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:16,952
Some folks think it tastes like bourbon.

472
00:46:22,194 --> 00:46:23,524
Have they ever had bourbon?

473
00:46:24,796 --> 00:46:26,558
Yeah.

474
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:30,233
Sam used to clean
her paintbrushes with it.

475
00:46:30,902 --> 00:46:34,530
- How long were you married?
- Seven years.

476
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,704
Six of them cancer-free.

477
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:43,369
We wanted a big family and were
trying for our first kid, you know?

478
00:46:43,548 --> 00:46:44,946
She started feeling sick.

479
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:48,710
Went to the doctor thinking we were
having a boy and came out...

480
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:54,948
I'm sorry.

481
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:03,730
Still hear her in the kitchen sometimes.

482
00:47:07,138 --> 00:47:11,096
- That goes away after a while.
- I'm not sure I want it to.

483
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:15,306
When did you?

484
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,610
Five years ago. David and Sarah.

485
00:47:26,157 --> 00:47:28,454
So how'd you pick the Sudan?

486
00:47:28,627 --> 00:47:32,494
I had a friend, Michael Costigan,
a priest who ran a camp there.

487
00:47:32,664 --> 00:47:34,153
He asked me to come.

488
00:47:34,332 --> 00:47:37,767
David, my husband, didn't wanna go,
not with Sarah being so young...

489
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:41,132
...but I was the one with a calling.

490
00:47:41,306 --> 00:47:45,969
I'd just been ordained
and I knew what was best.

491
00:47:46,144 --> 00:47:49,874
- You were doing a good thing.
- So I thought.

492
00:47:50,048 --> 00:47:54,416
We showed up with our crate of Bibles
and our clean T-shirts...

493
00:47:54,586 --> 00:47:58,146
...and our very good intentions.

494
00:47:58,323 --> 00:48:03,453
And then it didn't rain a drop
for a full year.

495
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:09,622
The crops died, the animals died,
the people died.

496
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:11,199
And they blamed us.

497
00:48:11,369 --> 00:48:16,271
My family was murdered
as a sacrifice to God.

498
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:29,008
The first night I stopped praying
was the first night I slept.

499
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:41,893
I have a lot of work tomorrow.

500
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,763
Loren.

501
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:15,638
Wait.

502
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:36,185
Katherine, why don't you see
if you can find Sarah?

503
00:50:52,611 --> 00:50:53,975
Haman.

504
00:50:54,145 --> 00:50:56,169
Sacrificing that animal
won't help your crop.

505
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,253
- Hey. I'm so lucky.
- How come?

506
00:51:11,429 --> 00:51:14,556
Because, silly, God gave me you.

507
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:55,897
He's right behind you.

508
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:08,083
Katherine. Katherine, wake up.
Katherine, Katherine, Katherine.

509
00:52:08,653 --> 00:52:10,119
Katherine, Katherine.

510
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:13,920
It's Ben, it's Ben, it's Ben.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

511
00:52:17,195 --> 00:52:18,320
I saw her.

512
00:52:18,863 --> 00:52:19,954
Sarah?

513
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:24,665
Yeah.

514
00:52:24,836 --> 00:52:26,928
Hey, if you wanna get out of here,
we're gone.

515
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,863
I'm fine. I just...

516
00:52:30,976 --> 00:52:32,966
I just thought I was...

517
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:35,236
...through with some of this stuff.

518
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:39,109
Come here, Katherine. Come here.

519
00:52:41,987 --> 00:52:43,385
It's all right.

520
00:52:46,024 --> 00:52:48,685
I'm sorry...

521
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,690
...about before, in the pasture.
- No.

522
00:52:51,863 --> 00:52:53,762
You know...

523
00:52:53,932 --> 00:52:58,595
...God protects his children
even if they don't know it yet.

524
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:02,694
Get some sleep.

525
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,308
Caught me snooping.

526
00:54:23,488 --> 00:54:26,285
Yeah. Kind of hard to snoop
in your own house.

527
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,446
What is that?

528
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:31,651
That is a healthy bovine cell.
Strong walls. Good color.

529
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,456
And then...

530
00:54:33,998 --> 00:54:37,262
...comes Pfiesteria.
- And that's from the Wakemans' cattle?

531
00:54:37,902 --> 00:54:40,426
Nope. That's just it.

532
00:54:40,605 --> 00:54:41,935
But this...

533
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:45,404
- This is.
- Well, that looks fine to me.

534
00:54:46,211 --> 00:54:47,871
Yeah, it is.

535
00:54:48,046 --> 00:54:50,605
Biologically, there's nothing wrong
with those cows...

536
00:54:50,782 --> 00:54:53,807
...or the flies, or the frogs, or the fish.

537
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:57,681
Sheriff said pretty much the same thing
about Brody McConnell.

538
00:54:57,856 --> 00:54:59,755
- There been an autopsy?
- Not yet.

539
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:03,586
- We've been told to wait on the coroner.
- Yeah, well, maybe we shouldn't.

540
00:55:04,229 --> 00:55:06,389
- I'll get Katherine.
- No. She left this morning.

541
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:09,657
- She went to the McConnells' house.
- You let her go alone?

542
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:13,132
I don't let her do anything.
I'm lucky I get the computer.

543
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:00,578
Mrs. McConnell?

544
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:02,514
Loren?

545
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:05,951
Hello? Anyone home?

546
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:31,773
Hello?

547
00:57:53,464 --> 00:57:55,431
Loren.

548
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,191
You scared me.

549
00:57:57,669 --> 00:58:01,035
Remember me, from the woods?

550
00:58:01,205 --> 00:58:02,933
My name's Katherine.

551
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:07,198
Is your mother here?

552
00:58:13,084 --> 00:58:15,313
You found it.

553
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:18,254
It's okay.

554
00:58:18,423 --> 00:58:19,411
Really.

555
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:23,685
It was my daughter's.
But you can have it.

556
00:58:31,269 --> 00:58:33,964
Hey, Loren. How old are you?

557
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:38,704
Let's get you cleaned up.

558
00:58:38,876 --> 00:58:41,173
It's okay. Come on.

559
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:03,458
That's your body's way
of telling you that...

560
00:59:04,202 --> 00:59:08,069
Well, that you're becoming a woman.

561
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:15,205
Yeah, it kind of freaked me out too.

562
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:33,057
Hey, Loren...

563
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:38,267
...do you know what's wrong
with the river?

564
00:59:38,436 --> 00:59:39,561
Loren!

565
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:25,247
Loren?

566
01:01:13,698 --> 01:01:16,495
You here for my girl?

567
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:20,968
Are you going to kill...

568
01:01:21,138 --> 01:01:22,365
...my baby girl?

569
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:26,641
What? No.

570
01:01:27,845 --> 01:01:28,833
Why not?

571
01:01:33,684 --> 01:01:35,378
I'm only trying to help her.

572
01:01:35,553 --> 01:01:38,544
She don't need any help.

573
01:01:40,725 --> 01:01:41,918
Don't you get that?

574
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:49,624
What? Mrs. McConnell.

575
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:52,498
What happened to your son?

576
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:57,562
How did he die?

577
01:01:57,742 --> 01:02:00,676
He didn't know any better.

578
01:02:02,213 --> 01:02:04,373
I couldn't get there in time.

579
01:02:05,816 --> 01:02:08,784
Brody was so fast...

580
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,058
- You see?
- I was just trying...

581
01:02:21,232 --> 01:02:24,428
Get out. Just get out.

582
01:02:34,979 --> 01:02:36,878
Wait.

583
01:02:37,615 --> 01:02:38,603
Doug?

584
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:22,583
There, there, now. It's gonna
be all right. It'll grow back.

585
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,752
Doug. The whole time you been here,
have we ever had a lice outbreak?

586
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:28,295
Not as far as I can remember.

587
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:32,561
Don't you think it's getting kind of old to
keep chalking everything up to coincidence?

588
01:03:32,737 --> 01:03:37,696
And you. We were told we were gonna get
some definite answers out of you by now.

589
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,434
Trying to work it out.
Trying to tie this to one source.

590
01:03:40,611 --> 01:03:41,599
Let me save some time.

591
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:44,542
She's 5 foot tall, blond,
and she lives out in the swamp...

592
01:03:44,715 --> 01:03:46,841
...with them devil worshippers.
- Yes, she is.

593
01:03:47,018 --> 01:03:49,815
- That's right. You tell them.
- Messing this town up.

594
01:03:49,987 --> 01:03:52,955
- Let's go see the McConnell boy?
- Yeah.

595
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:54,988
Later.

596
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:56,682
- What?
- It's okay.

597
01:03:56,861 --> 01:03:58,327
Hey.

598
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:00,963
Where exactly is lice on the list?

599
01:04:01,132 --> 01:04:02,223
Five.

600
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:42,666
<i>Katherine, you copy?</i>

601
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,364
- Hey. Are you there?
- You find the girl?

602
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:47,806
I found her.

603
01:04:47,978 --> 01:04:50,309
<i>And?</i>

604
01:04:50,481 --> 01:04:52,914
<i>Where are you?</i>

605
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:55,415
We're about to meet her brother.

606
01:05:00,424 --> 01:05:03,256
Katherine, you are gonna wanna see this.

607
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:13,596
You shouldn't have gone out there alone.
You all right?

608
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:16,463
I don't know.

609
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,231
Listen.

610
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:21,434
I know logically and rationally
you and I agree.

611
01:05:21,612 --> 01:05:23,806
- Okay.
- But there's things going on now.

612
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:26,107
Things in there.

613
01:05:26,717 --> 01:05:28,274
You just better prepare yourself.

614
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,114
This is Brody McConnell?

615
01:05:37,628 --> 01:05:41,586
Funeral home backs up Cade. Three
days ago he was in perfect condition.

616
01:05:41,766 --> 01:05:44,632
- Cause of death unknown.
- Yeah, and it's gonna stay that way.

617
01:05:44,802 --> 01:05:47,326
I mean, we're already
in the dry stages of decomp here.

618
01:05:47,505 --> 01:05:51,964
You don't see this on a body until they're
like one or two years in the grave.

619
01:05:56,413 --> 01:05:58,004
What the hell is that?

620
01:06:03,954 --> 01:06:06,979
- Call the FBI. Shut them down.
- No. We're past the police here.

621
01:06:07,158 --> 01:06:10,558
- This is a cult, plain and simple.
- Well, what about the plagues?

622
01:06:10,728 --> 01:06:14,060
They killed one child. Do we wanna
stand around while they kill another?

623
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:16,289
- Sheriff, we need to talk.
- We sure do.

624
01:06:16,467 --> 01:06:17,694
- This just came.
- I need...

625
01:06:17,868 --> 01:06:20,165
Just read it.

626
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:23,227
What is it?

627
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:24,771
It's a lab result.

628
01:06:24,942 --> 01:06:28,001
Yeah, from the water samples we sent in.

629
01:06:40,257 --> 01:06:42,486
It's human blood.

630
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:44,684
The whole damn river.

631
01:06:44,862 --> 01:06:46,692
That's a two-mile stretch of river.

632
01:06:46,864 --> 01:06:50,492
That's damn near 2,
300,000 bodies' worth of blood.

633
01:06:50,668 --> 01:06:53,830
- Could these reports be wrong?
- No.

634
01:06:54,004 --> 01:06:55,402
I need to make a call.

635
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:58,863
Hello?

636
01:07:02,546 --> 01:07:03,603
Where you headed, Cade?

637
01:07:03,781 --> 01:07:06,613
- The McConnells'. Where do you think?
- We need to evacuate.

638
01:07:06,784 --> 01:07:08,717
Loren McConnell isn't going anywhere.

639
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:10,284
These people are in danger.

640
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,219
- Only the mayor can authorize evacuation.
- Where is he?

641
01:07:19,396 --> 01:07:22,558
I need to know what to do
before this little girl is murdered.

642
01:07:22,733 --> 01:07:26,862
<i>The symbol you're seeing is part
of a prophecy that predates Christ...</i>

643
01:07:27,037 --> 01:07:29,527
...which tells of an ancient satanic sect.

644
01:07:29,707 --> 01:07:34,973
Their first-born are branded and left
unharmed to carry on the genetic line.

645
01:07:35,145 --> 01:07:38,113
<i>But all of the second-born thereafter
are to be sacrificed.</i>

646
01:07:40,284 --> 01:07:44,049
- Sacrificed to please Satan?
- It happens when the child reaches puberty.

647
01:07:44,221 --> 01:07:46,154
Puberty? But that can't be right.

648
01:07:46,323 --> 01:07:50,122
This little girl, Loren, she's a second-born,
and if she is a part of this cult...

649
01:07:50,294 --> 01:07:52,158
...why hasn't she been sacrificed yet?

650
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:55,092
Wait. Yes, it says here:

651
01:07:55,266 --> 01:07:59,326
"For all their sacrifice,
they shall reap a perfect child...

652
01:07:59,503 --> 01:08:03,268
<i>...a second-born,
who upon coming into adulthood...</i>

653
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,306
...shall be reborn with the eyes of Satan. "

654
01:08:06,477 --> 01:08:09,604
So you're saying this girl is the one
they've been trying to create?

655
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,748
Yes. A child in Satan's image.

656
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:15,009
But what does this
have to do with plagues?

657
01:08:15,185 --> 01:08:18,051
<i>Lucifer has often turned God's
weapons against the righteous.</i>

658
01:08:18,222 --> 01:08:19,620
He's protecting the girl.

659
01:08:20,591 --> 01:08:22,490
If you'd seen this girl,
you couldn't be...

660
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:26,993
I understand your compassion.
But this girl...

661
01:08:27,164 --> 01:08:29,825
You've already seen the evil
she's capable of.

662
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,833
<i>You're in great danger, Katherine.
Everyone is.</i>

663
01:08:34,004 --> 01:08:35,994
This girl could be the beginning.

664
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:40,366
<i>Haven could be the start of it all.</i>

665
01:08:40,544 --> 01:08:42,443
Hello?

666
01:08:55,326 --> 01:08:56,314
Brooks?

667
01:09:00,998 --> 01:09:05,900
And there shall be boils breaking forth
upon man and upon beast.

668
01:09:13,277 --> 01:09:15,141
<i>"At the height of their power...</i>

669
01:09:15,312 --> 01:09:18,678
...God shall send forth an angel
to destroy them. "

670
01:09:18,849 --> 01:09:20,406
Perhaps this angel is you.

671
01:09:20,584 --> 01:09:22,881
<i>- I don't think so, Michael.
- You don't understand.</i>

672
01:09:23,053 --> 01:09:27,421
"Angel" can sometimes be a metaphor
for people of the cloth, the ordained.

673
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:31,890
The cult will be powerless against you.
You could stop them.

674
01:09:32,062 --> 01:09:36,862
No. It's a convoluted, contradictory,
nonsensical legend. It's not a prophecy.

675
01:09:37,034 --> 01:09:40,662
You're telling me to join a bloodthirsty
crowd and lynch a 12-year-old girl.

676
01:09:40,838 --> 01:09:42,395
What if God has chosen you...

677
01:09:42,573 --> 01:09:45,871
...and the girl is in fact a channel
for the Fallen One?

678
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:49,011
<i>- You must destroy her.
- Lf you're wrong, an innocent child dies.</i>

679
01:09:49,179 --> 01:09:52,579
And if I'm right, many more will die.
The symbol is your proof.

680
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:56,412
<i>Branded on their first-born,
protecting their places of worship...</i>

681
01:09:56,587 --> 01:09:58,554
...marked on their sacrificial chambers.

682
01:09:58,722 --> 01:10:02,623
You've seen it. Open the door, Katherine,
and you'll believe it.

683
01:10:02,793 --> 01:10:04,384
You'll know.

684
01:10:08,098 --> 01:10:10,622
You've gotta destroy her, Katherine!

685
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,397
Michael. Michael?

686
01:10:22,413 --> 01:10:23,777
Help!

687
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,987
Help! Help!

688
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:45,361
Help!

689
01:10:50,607 --> 01:10:52,130
Guns can't solve this, Gordon.

690
01:10:52,309 --> 01:10:53,639
Is that right?

691
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:55,141
Don't forget the shells.

692
01:10:55,312 --> 01:10:57,745
- I'm not going without.
- Shouldn't be going at all.

693
01:10:57,915 --> 01:11:00,314
- Let me tell you...
- Just leave him out of this.

694
01:11:00,484 --> 01:11:03,452
- The car's gone and so is Katherine.
- Shit.

695
01:11:04,621 --> 01:11:07,589
You're gonna do this?
You really think you can kill that girl?

696
01:11:07,758 --> 01:11:10,282
I'm gonna do what needs to be done.

697
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:13,486
Gordon, you watch him out there,
all right?

698
01:12:59,736 --> 01:13:02,226
Loren?

699
01:13:08,078 --> 01:13:10,443
Where's your daughter?

700
01:13:11,982 --> 01:13:15,314
- I didn't understand what would happen.
- Tell me where she is.

701
01:13:17,854 --> 01:13:19,218
She's gone over.

702
01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:22,581
What?

703
01:13:23,227 --> 01:13:25,820
He controls her now.

704
01:13:27,197 --> 01:13:30,632
Whatever he wants...

705
01:13:32,669 --> 01:13:35,068
...she does.

706
01:13:37,374 --> 01:13:40,274
My part's done.

707
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:47,404
No.

708
01:13:48,385 --> 01:13:50,909
- I failed.
- I failed too.

709
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:01,452
No.

710
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:09,904
I imagine there's...

711
01:14:10,073 --> 01:14:11,198
...something after.

712
01:14:16,513 --> 01:14:17,501
Wait.

713
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:23,071
<i>Katherine? Do you copy?</i>

714
01:15:23,647 --> 01:15:25,079
Katherine.

715
01:15:25,248 --> 01:15:26,475
Nothing.

716
01:17:21,965 --> 01:17:24,330
What are we gonna do, Dad?

717
01:17:27,003 --> 01:17:29,971
We're gonna do
what we come out here to do, boy.

718
01:17:31,107 --> 01:17:32,232
Gordon.

719
01:18:01,171 --> 01:18:02,159
Katherine!

720
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:07,832
Katherine! Get inside! Get inside!

721
01:18:12,883 --> 01:18:15,680
Dad!

722
01:18:19,322 --> 01:18:20,913
Doug!

723
01:19:47,844 --> 01:19:49,003
Ben?

724
01:19:50,714 --> 01:19:52,044
Katherine.

725
01:19:52,215 --> 01:19:55,479
<i>Are you okay? Where are you?</i>

726
01:19:55,652 --> 01:19:57,881
I'm in some sort of a crypt.

727
01:19:58,054 --> 01:20:00,817
By the ruins? Where's Doug?

728
01:20:01,524 --> 01:20:02,888
He's still out there.

729
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:05,993
I'm so sorry. I was so wrong.

730
01:20:06,162 --> 01:20:08,561
Katherine, look, forget about it.

731
01:20:08,732 --> 01:20:12,189
Let's just get out of here
before the final three plagues.

732
01:20:41,164 --> 01:20:42,152
<i>Ben?</i>

733
01:20:44,234 --> 01:20:47,828
Katherine. There are bodies of children
hanging down here.

734
01:20:55,078 --> 01:20:57,204
Wait a second.

735
01:20:58,581 --> 01:21:03,449
They're all children. They're all children.

736
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:09,721
Get out of there now. Meet me at
the truck. And please be careful.

737
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,367
<i>Katherine.</i>

738
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:54,668
Ben.

739
01:21:54,838 --> 01:21:57,738
<i>She's outside. I'm trapped.</i>

740
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:06,605
Okay. Okay. I gotta find...

741
01:22:06,783 --> 01:22:08,272
I gotta find another way out.

742
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:11,515
Ben?

743
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,633
Ben?

744
01:22:26,669 --> 01:22:28,363
No, no, no. No.

745
01:22:29,739 --> 01:22:30,762
Ben?

746
01:22:44,287 --> 01:22:47,949
It's me. I didn't mean to scare you.

747
01:22:53,296 --> 01:22:54,523
I saw her out there.

748
01:22:56,499 --> 01:22:58,989
I had to hide in the swamp.

749
01:23:00,136 --> 01:23:01,693
What are we gonna do, huh?

750
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:06,999
You stay here.

751
01:23:07,177 --> 01:23:09,940
She trusts me.

752
01:23:10,113 --> 01:23:12,546
I have to end this.

753
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:06,828
Hi.

754
01:25:10,466 --> 01:25:15,164
I used to have a little girl
who looked just like you.

755
01:25:15,538 --> 01:25:19,633
I wanna take you away from here. Okay?

756
01:25:26,316 --> 01:25:27,373
Just be still.

757
01:25:32,622 --> 01:25:33,986
I'm so lucky.

758
01:25:35,024 --> 01:25:36,490
Why?

759
01:25:36,659 --> 01:25:38,023
Because, silly...

760
01:25:38,194 --> 01:25:39,353
God gave me you.

761
01:25:40,997 --> 01:25:42,293
God gave me you.

762
01:25:44,367 --> 01:25:47,164
How do I know?

763
01:25:47,337 --> 01:25:49,531
How do we know what's real?

764
01:25:55,278 --> 01:25:56,642
Faith.

765
01:25:57,413 --> 01:25:59,039
Mama, stop!

766
01:26:02,318 --> 01:26:03,545
Hold still.

767
01:26:06,689 --> 01:26:09,020
Brody, go!

768
01:26:13,129 --> 01:26:14,823
Loren!

769
01:27:02,078 --> 01:27:04,045
<i>"At the height of their power...</i>

770
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:09,309
<i>...God shall send forth an angel
to destroy them. "</i>

771
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,899
She's tricked you, hasn't she?

772
01:27:30,073 --> 01:27:33,530
She's perverting your faith
through lies now.

773
01:27:33,709 --> 01:27:36,836
That's how Satan works, you know?

774
01:27:37,013 --> 01:27:38,309
Now, please, you kill her.

775
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:42,314
I'm a first-born.
And you know what plague comes next.

776
01:27:42,485 --> 01:27:47,285
<i>Their first-born are branded and left
unharmed to carry on the genetic line.</i>

777
01:27:47,457 --> 01:27:50,653
I come from a long line of only children.

778
01:27:52,028 --> 01:27:54,689
- It's number two for both of us.
- Know what you're having?

779
01:27:54,864 --> 01:27:56,421
Heck, doesn't matter to me.

780
01:27:56,599 --> 01:27:59,931
Are you gonna kill my baby girl?

781
01:28:00,103 --> 01:28:01,364
<i>No.</i>

782
01:28:01,537 --> 01:28:03,003
Why not?

783
01:28:03,706 --> 01:28:06,538
Katherine, please kill her
before it's too late.

784
01:28:11,814 --> 01:28:13,644
You do it.

785
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,018
You can't do it, can you?

786
01:28:19,188 --> 01:28:21,280
Because you already tried
and she survived.

787
01:28:21,457 --> 01:28:22,445
No, that's not true.

788
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,525
You deceived me so I would murder her.

789
01:28:28,164 --> 01:28:30,563
This innocent child.

790
01:28:30,733 --> 01:28:32,359
She's not innocent, Katherine.

791
01:28:33,669 --> 01:28:35,795
Look what she's done already.

792
01:28:35,972 --> 01:28:37,802
You're seeing with your own eyes.

793
01:28:40,076 --> 01:28:41,906
You killed Ben...

794
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:47,480
...so I would blame her.

795
01:28:49,385 --> 01:28:50,976
<i>She's outside.</i>

796
01:28:51,154 --> 01:28:55,021
Okay. Okay. I gotta find...

797
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:58,648
I gotta find another way out of here.

798
01:29:03,499 --> 01:29:04,487
Come on.

799
01:29:16,812 --> 01:29:19,371
The whole of Haven
used to pray to God on this spot.

800
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:24,508
You know how he answered their prayers?
With floods and devastation.

801
01:29:24,687 --> 01:29:28,178
He abandoned them,
so they abandoned God.

802
01:29:28,357 --> 01:29:33,020
My family introduced them
to the true Lord.

803
01:29:33,196 --> 01:29:36,130
A powerful Lord,
who hears his people's prayers.

804
01:29:37,934 --> 01:29:43,030
You were ordained and you turned
your back on God just like we did.

805
01:29:43,206 --> 01:29:44,365
That's why we chose you.

806
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:47,906
Only a servant of God can kill his angel.

807
01:29:48,711 --> 01:29:52,908
You remember what your God
did to you in the Sudan?

808
01:29:53,082 --> 01:29:56,244
What about your daughter, huh?

809
01:29:56,419 --> 01:29:58,682
Now that...

810
01:30:00,223 --> 01:30:01,951
...that is your God.

811
01:30:04,594 --> 01:30:06,720
Katherine.

812
01:30:08,664 --> 01:30:10,893
That's not God.

813
01:30:11,067 --> 01:30:13,193
God didn't kill my family.

814
01:30:13,369 --> 01:30:17,566
A weak, godless man
filled with fear and hatred...

815
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:19,798
...a man like you.

816
01:30:19,976 --> 01:30:23,502
There's still that last plague, Doug.

817
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,145
The death of the first-born.

818
01:30:29,085 --> 01:30:32,850
And you come from a long line
of only children.

819
01:30:35,024 --> 01:30:36,149
You all do.

820
01:30:45,668 --> 01:30:47,225
No!

821
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:01,511
- Now you tell her to stop or you die too.
- Loren.

822
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:07,749
Don't be scared. It's God's will.

823
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:38,470
It's okay. It's all right. Don't be scared.

824
01:32:38,647 --> 01:32:39,704
It's okay.

825
01:32:41,751 --> 01:32:45,242
Everything's gonna be okay. I promise.

826
01:32:46,288 --> 01:32:48,482
It's just the two of us now.

827
01:32:48,657 --> 01:32:51,318
And we're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

828
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:56,597
What about the boy?

829
01:32:57,967 --> 01:32:59,456
What boy?

830
01:33:00,069 --> 01:33:03,401
The boy inside you. Your baby.

831
01:33:03,572 --> 01:33:05,300
I can hear him.

832
01:33:05,474 --> 01:33:08,670
We'll have to take care of him too.

833
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:16,346
<i>"For all their sacrifice,
they shall reap a perfect child... "</i>

834
01:33:16,519 --> 01:33:17,917
Let me buy you a drink.

835
01:33:18,087 --> 01:33:21,681
<i>"... a second-born,
who upon coming into adulthood...</i>

836
01:33:21,858 --> 01:33:25,554
<i>...shall be reborn with the eyes of Satan. "</i>

837
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,084
