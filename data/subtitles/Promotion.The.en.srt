00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>Hi. I'm Doug Stauber.</i>

2
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:23,766
<i>I'm an assistant manager
at Donaldson's Grocery...</i>

3
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:26,738
<i>where customers come first-
even customers who are nuts.</i>

4
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:30,072
- Mr. Stauber.
- Can I help you?

5
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,171
<i>This guy had some complaint
about the cracker Teddy Grahams...</i>

6
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,182
<i>a honey graham snack.</i>

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,775
<i>- Okay.
- He spoke some other kind of language.</i>

8
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,685
<i>"Lerhman torsh. "</i>

9
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:46,255
That's not Spanish, bro.
I don't know what that is.

10
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,364
Okay, "Lerhman. "
Let's go. Sorry.

11
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:03,742
Oh, no.

12
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,641
Lerhman, man,
I don't know, Lerhman. I don't-

13
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:08,681
<i>- Holy shit!
- At Donaldson's...</i>

14
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:11,877
<i>the assistant manager
deals with customer complaints.</i>

15
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,088
<i>What the hell?</i>

16
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:18,624
<i>It's my job to keep a lid on this place.</i>

17
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:22,492
<i>It's kind of hard.
I mean, it's not like I have a crack staff.</i>

18
00:01:25,732 --> 00:01:29,759
<i>Outside, we have a gang problem. And we
have two 14-year-old security guards...</i>

19
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:33,636
<i>who stand as far away from the store
as they possibly can.</i>

20
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:36,574
<i>And at the end of the day,
I get reviews from customers...</i>

21
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:38,736
<i>whose feedback is important to us.</i>

22
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:41,804
<i>I returned to the lot from the
grocery and found three black guys...</i>

23
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:44,009
<i>sitting on my car eating snacks.</i>

24
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:47,986
<i>They finally left, but called me
names and words like "tasty"...</i>

25
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,683
<i>and "lick"and "titties. "</i>

26
00:01:50,757 --> 00:01:54,523
<i>I have to turn these cards
over to our actual manager...</i>

27
00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:57,359
<i>who's usually on his way back
from a movie.</i>

28
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:59,160
- What's up?
- Hey.

29
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:01,064
- New cards?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,125
Good ones?

31
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:08,801
That's good.
"Lick. " "Titties. "

32
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:11,207
I'm gonna take off.

33
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:14,475
<i>So my job has challenges.</i>

34
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,539
<i>So I'm not smiling here
because I'm actually happy.</i>

35
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:18,551
<i>I'm smiling because
I'm pretty sure my manager-</i>

36
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:21,144
<i>who probably is actually happy-
expected me to...</i>

37
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,655
<i>and I want to advance
and have a good career.</i>

38
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,056
I'm supporting the orbital bone
with my right hand...

39
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:28,754
and the other hand
is right in her chest cavity, you know?

40
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,390
I'm manually massaging her heart now.
I thought she was going to die.

41
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:35,162
- How'd you get her back?
- Instinct.

42
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:38,830
- Hey, Jen.
- Hey, Doug. You remember Mark Timms.

43
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:40,338
<i>- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.</i>

44
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:44,309
We were just talking about how Mark
saved a two-year-old girl's life.

45
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,312
Good job.

46
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,110
- Oh. Tell Mark about "Teddy Grahams. "
- That's all right.

47
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,672
<i>- It's hilarious.
- What?</i>

48
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:53,914
- This Teddy Grahams "snack slap" thing.
- Oh, snack slap?

49
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,717
- He got in this little slap fight.
- What happened? Tell me.

50
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,758
- Tell him.
- That's ok- No.

51
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:01,919
No, come on, man.
I want to know. Come on, guy.

52
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:05,487
<i>And I'm asked to share my graham cracker
slap stories with my wife's boss...</i>

53
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:08,625
<i>- who never remembers my name.
- All right.</i>

54
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,364
<i>And my name's on my shirt. Right side.</i>

55
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:15,534
<i>Just the first name though. I tried to put
"Mr. Stauber" on it, but I got reprimanded.</i>

56
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:21,141
Big deal. He saved an infant.
That's great.

57
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:23,842
- If I had infant-saving training,
I could probably do it. - Okay.

58
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:28,513
<i>Some days, I didn't think
anyone would call me "mister. "</i>

59
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:32,388
<i>I'd just be "Doug"... for good.</i>

60
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:55,877
You're a shoo-in, dude.

61
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,383
<i>- Seriously?
- Seriously.</i>

62
00:03:58,452 --> 00:04:01,751
Hey, do you know where the expression
"shoo-in" comes from?

63
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:03,915
No.

64
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,118
<i>The Romans used to-</i>

65
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,161
I'm the shoo-in- the leading shoo-in.
Totally.

66
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,324
<i>- Oh, you're the leading shoo-in.
- Yeah, totally.</i>

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,267
Come here, you sweaty bastard.
You sweaty shoo-in.

68
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:19,396
- I'm really sweaty.
- I don't care. Come here.

69
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:22,169
Oh, Jesus! You stink.

70
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,234
- I'll take a shower.
- It's okay.

71
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:42,958
<i>- Hey, guy, can you just give us a break?
One night?</i>

72
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:45,224
<i>My partner's coming over.</i>

73
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:48,665
<i>- I'm supposed to have this piece prepared.
- Man, we're trying to...</i>

74
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:50,999
have dinner.

75
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,301
<i>I thought you were makin' out. "All sweaty. "</i>

76
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:58,100
<i>Compromise. I'll do scales.</i>

77
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,849
- Is it still for sale?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,979
<i>We should go get that house. This week.</i>

79
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:11,853
Because I'm gonna get that job,
and I feel really good about things.

80
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:15,554
Me too.
Maybe we should wait though.

81
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,692
I'm a shoo-in. And someone's
gonna snag that house. Let's do it.

82
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,531
- Shoo-in?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:27,232
All right. Let's do it.

84
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:30,674
<i>It was right there, what we worked for.</i>

85
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,947
<i>Then this guy
comes down from Canada.</i>

86
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:37,742
<i>#Every day I'm gonna strut that stuff #</i>

87
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:40,810
<i># When the music's loud
I can't get enough #</i>

88
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:43,856
<i>#Singin' hi, singin' hi #</i>

89
00:05:43,924 --> 00:05:46,825
<i># Come on, feet
Teach yourself to move #</i>

90
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:48,884
<i>#Hey #</i>

91
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,325
<i>#People shufflin'

92
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:58,064
<i># Unhappy faces

93
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:00,129
<i>#Singin' hi, singin' hi #</i>

94
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:03,176
<i># Come on, people

95
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:06,178
<i>#Hey, yeah #</i>

96
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,874
<i>#Hey, all right #</i>

97
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:39,801
<i>#Spread the news
We're gonna have some fun #</i>

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,610
<i>#Let it go
Movin'son of a gun #</i>

99
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:45,446
<i>#Singin' hi, singin' hi #</i>

100
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,250
<i># Come on, feet
We was born to move #</i>

101
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:52,052
<i>- #Hey, yeah ##
Got the loading dock right over there.</i>

102
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,218
<i>- That's for blue stock only.
- Okay.</i>

103
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,762
<i>- That gets logged in right away.
- Blue stock.</i>

104
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,924
And if it's before 8:15 in the morning,
you've got to do it.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,264
- Move it over right up there to that first pallet.
- Right.

106
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:05,668
This way, as soon as it goes back,
it's rotated back to the first-

107
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:13,574
<i>We just moved.
My wife was transferred, so now I'm here.</i>

108
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:17,083
Richard Wehlner, from Quebec.

109
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,141
<i>And that's pretty much where it all started-</i>

110
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:21,813
<i>some joker blowing down
from Canada...</i>

111
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:24,857
<i>from a sister company
I didn't even know we had.</i>

112
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,761
Nice location.

113
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:43,708
Yeah.

114
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,938
<i>- It's a Plus?
- What's that?</i>

115
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,879
<i>- It's gonna be full size?
- Full size.</i>

116
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,248
This place will draw too.
There's not another grocery till Western.

117
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,288
I'm gonna put in for it,
full manager.

118
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,550
Yeah, me too.

119
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:05,120
- So, okay. See you later.
- Yep. See you later.

120
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,292
Eh, gimme five.

121
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:25,710
<i>Erickson's is our sister company.</i>

122
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:27,685
Okay.

123
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:31,246
Yeah, they're all over Canada.
Wehlner's got, like, six years in up there.

124
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,258
But I'm still the shoo-in, right?

125
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:37,126
I don't know.
Wehlner's kind of a wild card.

126
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:40,291
His work history transfers clean, so-

127
00:08:41,368 --> 00:08:43,700
I don't know about
this shoo-in business.

128
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,228
So there's a microchip on the right
anterior wheel that has a sensor in it...

129
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:51,038
<i>and if it detects an obstacle,
it will engage the self-braking mechanism.</i>

130
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:54,376
<i>So no more scratched
door small claims, right?</i>

131
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,438
All right, here we go.

132
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,425
<i>I had to tell her I wasn't a shoo-in...</i>

133
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:10,019
<i>- and that maybe the house was out for now.
- Whoa!</i>

134
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:12,030
<i>That's no way to play the banjo.</i>

135
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,896
<i>- I'm doing the best I can.
- No, you're not. Because you don't love me.</i>

136
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,368
<i>- I love you intensely.
- Then show me...</i>

137
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:19,962
<i>- by playing better banjo.
- Okay.</i>

138
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,009
<i>Then show me... sexually.</i>

139
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,169
Dream or real?

140
00:09:26,246 --> 00:09:29,738
- Real.
- Oh, my God.

141
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:31,750
<i>Chapter Two.</i>

142
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,286
<i>We'll learn the importance
of recognizing opportunities...</i>

143
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:37,949
<i>to stand out at work
and to steer clear of trouble.</i>

144
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,822
We'll also learn that success
does not come to the timid...

145
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,988
<i>but to those like-
Richard Wehlner-</i>

146
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,998
<i>Who go out and make things happen.</i>

147
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:48,967
<i>It's nice when
you bring your daughter's Brownie troupe...</i>

148
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:51,902
<i>in for cupcakes
and they learn the word "cock. "</i>

149
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:55,771
<i>- Thanks, Donaldson's.
- Fuck.</i>

150
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:04,950
- Hey. Any good?
- No.

151
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:09,045
- Well, what's the problem? We'll work on it as a team.
- The box is on the lot.

152
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:13,320
- The lot's so fuckin' nuts.
- Well, what's so f'ing nuts about it?

153
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:18,092
- It's just crazy. Lot detail means bad cards.
- Oh.

154
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,598
Scott, why is the board here?

155
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:24,865
Oh, they wanna run stock for the new Plus
store in Augusta. They want a stock list.

156
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,031
Great. I'm eager to meet them.

157
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:29,974

161
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,649

- Yeah, well, I'd go, but I gotta get my car washed.

00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,991
- Well, who's on lot?
- Richard.

163
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:53,521
- Ask Richard.
- Yeah, h-he's with Kev from Pepsi.

164
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,229
They're putting a new product up.
He asked for Richard.

165
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,294
- He asked for him?
- Yeah.

166
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:03,035
Been working together last couple of weeks.
They got friendly, so-

167
00:11:03,109 --> 00:11:05,043
Can you get out there? Just, uh-

168
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:08,410
Listen, I have bad cards stacking up
from the lot. The board's here.

169
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,779
I'll get you inside tomorrow.

170
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:18,424
<i>...from Donaldson's, the
champion of excellence.</i>

171
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:23,428
<i>Donaldson's is committed to
offering the widest selection-</i>

172
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,726
<i>- You can pretty much do what you want.
- Anything?</i>

173
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,236
<i>Yeah, man.
That wasn't what I meant. Come on.</i>

174
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:33,033
<i>No, seriously.
If you want this whole section...</i>

175
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,472
it's Pepsi's world, right?

176
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:39,876
Um, no, we got a lot of room. I mean,
if you need to expand a little bit...

177
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:43,211
if you need more, I can-

178
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:47,049
She got a fat pussy too. I'm talkin'
about a fuckin' milk truck pussy, nigga.

179
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,556
- Hey, guys. - Yo, and a big-ass house
made from a chub pussy and her ass?

180
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,853
<i>- It's, like, damn!
- Come on, guys.</i>

181
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:55,087
You gotta walk around.
Uh, no cut-throughs.

182
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,152
Whatever the fuck.

183
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,892
- Hey, you can't cut through, dawg.
- Ah, fuck you, whopper.

184
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,935
- What the fuck you callin' me "whopper. "
- Whoa! Cool down.

185
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:05,766
I bought a Charleston Chew.
Man, fuck you. Ask him.

186
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,798
<i>- Well, where is it?
- I ate it. Ain't I buy a Charleston Chew, asshole?</i>

187
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:13,243
<i>Your name's Stauber, right? Doug?</i>

188
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:15,110
Yep.

189
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:19,811
- Did he buy a Charleston Chew?
- Like, at 2:00.

190
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:23,481
Did he buy a Charleston Chew this afternoon?
Come on, Stauber.

191
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:26,658
<i>- Yeah.
- All right.</i>

192
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:31,288
- Then he's a customer, Stauber.
- I'm a customer every day buyin' Chews.

193
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:34,458
Welcome, all you guys.

194
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:38,163
You played this the wrong way, Stauber.

195
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:44,608
What the frig are you doing?

196
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:47,145
Here's how we're gonna fix this.
Come on.

197
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:54,509
Go.

198
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:59,657
<i>Excuse me, young sir?</i>

199
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,023
I want to offer you-

200
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:10,365
I'd like to offer you a complimentary
strawberry Charleston Chew.

201
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:14,167
<i>I indicated the flavor: Strawberry.</i>

202
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,970
Thanks, strawberry faggot.

203
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:20,206
<i>I'm little Mr. Strawberries.</i>

204
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,841
<i>And I was supposed to be inside that day,
not comping the Chews.</i>

205
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:28,513
<i>Kev, I think you're all set. I'm gonna give you the end cap, and
- It was good to see you.</i>

206
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:31,148
- It's great to see you. I'm proud of you.
- You too, man.

207
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:34,557
Um, like I said, if you need
more space on the shelves...

208
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:37,027
I can always squeeze
Green River a little bit.

209
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:41,563
Hey, uh, were you a male gymnastics?

210
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:44,535
Was I a male gymnastics?

211
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:49,064
Were you a male gymnastics
in the junior Olympics? Ruiz Googled you.

212
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:52,373
He says you were a male gymnastic
in Junior Olympics.

213
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:57,007
No. I wasn't... male gymnastics
in Junior Olympics.

214
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:03,052
Octavio- Come on, man.

215
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:06,523
It's a joke, for morale purposes.

216
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,153
<i>Wehlner didn't say
nothing. He's inside today.</i>

217
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:13,323
<i>- You're lot.
- I'm just gonna take it down.</i>

218
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:19,334
<i>We should eat.
You guys want something from the rotisserie?</i>

219
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,033
Let's snag somethin' from Deli.

220
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,774
<i>You're gonna love this deli.</i>

221
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,647
<i>Their selection is out of this world.</i>

222
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,751
We're gonna place four lunch orders.

223
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,154
<i>He stole my Pepsi rep detail.</i>

224
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:12,214
<i>No matter how you slice it,
that's a dick move.</i>

225
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,455
<i>You deal with the poster.
Dick move, man. Deal.</i>

226
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,057
Rotating convention,
full benefits...

227
00:15:21,134 --> 00:15:23,068
69,000, a spot on the board.

228
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:25,070
That's great.

229
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:30,098
<i>- It is.
- Hey, Doug. Doug Stauber!</i>

230
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:34,236
<i>- Hey.
- It's my wife, Lori.</i>

231
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:36,474
I was just tellin' her
about this new place.

232
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:40,417
Hey, come on over and meet Christine Wehlner.

233
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:42,511
<i>- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Jen.</i>

234
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:44,488
Lori. Pleased to meet you.

235
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:46,991
- Hi. Doug.
- What kind of accent is that? It's really pretty.

236
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,756
Scotland.
We met on a mission to Scotland.

237
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:54,960
- On an army mission?
- Christian, man. Christian mission.

238
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:57,502
Oh. Okay.

239
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,767
<i>Man, when I cheese postered him,
I didn't know he was a family man.</i>

240
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,504
<i>Also, he's Canadian. They're not
the same as Americans. They're nicer.</i>

241
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,069
- Oh. Hey, Paul.
- Hi. How are you? Nice to see you.

242
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,547
- Good to see you too. It's been a while.
- You're lookin' great.

243
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,709
- Thank you very much.
- Hot enough for ya?

244
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:16,243
I like it like this. Opens up the pores,
makes me feel really good.

245
00:16:16,322 --> 00:16:18,313
- Listen, I gotta run, but you're lookin' great.
- Okay. Thanks.

246
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:20,484
- See you later.
- You too. Say hello to the wife.

247
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,791
<i>He was nice. And he actually had
a pretty good little explanation...</i>

248
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:25,797
<i>for stealing my Pepsi rep, Kevin.</i>

249
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,127
So, yeah, I'm glad I saw ya...

250
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:33,502
'cause I w-wanted to talk
to you off to the side about Kev.

251
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:37,532
- Pepsi rep Kev?
- Yeah, about that stuff. Yeah.

252
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,943
Uh, when we were
puttin' up the jazz?

253
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,038
I wanted to tell you-

254
00:16:43,116 --> 00:16:46,517
you know, off to the side- um...

255
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:51,751
I'm a drug addict- recovering-
and an alcoholic.

256
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:56,056
And, uh, Kevin's my program sponsor.

257
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,757
Yeah, um, sponsor.

258
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:03,097
Yeah. So, Wednesday,
I was havin' a-

259
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,196
Well, I just really
needed to talk to him.

260
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,969
- So I'm sorry if- I didn't mean to-
- Don't worry about it.

261
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,603
- Come on.
- Okay. Thanks, Doug. That's awesome.

262
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:17,378
- Oh, hey.
- No, I got it.

263
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,715
- It's okay.
- I got it, Doug. Get outta here.

264
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:24,745
<i>Get on outta here.</i>

265
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,429
<i>Who else is interviewing anyway?</i>

266
00:17:30,496 --> 00:17:32,657
It's really mine, as the shoo-in.

267
00:17:32,732 --> 00:17:36,361
But, uh, I think they're going to sit down
with a couple of other guys as a formality.

268
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,699
They don't stand a chance really.

269
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:42,172
Not with you in this suit,
they don't.

270
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:46,405
- Is that guy still standing on his balcony staring at us?
- Yeah.

271
00:17:49,015 --> 00:17:51,006
That's nice.

272
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:10,894
Hey, do you mind if I listen on my
headphones? 'Cause Canadian news is on at 1:30.

273
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,961
That's cool.

274
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:18,176
<i>Chapter Four.</i>

275
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,804
Chances are,
you live in a metro environment...

276
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,747
full of men trying their best
to get ahead.

277
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:28,082
Millions. So how do you separate yourself
from the guy next to you...

278
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:31,146
who may be younger
and also wants what you want?

279
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:34,352
Through the quality of your work,
by flying higher.

280
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:37,487
This chapter's entitled,
"Taking Off. "

281
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:40,794
Let's let this classic rock song
remind you what direction-

282
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:44,563
Richard Wehlner-
is headed: Up.

283
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,127
Let's rock!

00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:49,299
<i># Ticktock, tick, doo, doo, doo-doo #</i>

285
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,743

295
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:40,357
Our grocery-
We have Martin's projects right there.

296
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:43,259
And we're trying to draw
from pretty high-end neighborhoods.

297
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:48,460
We get a lot of cut-throughs, but, uh, keeping
the lot safe is our number one obstacle.

298
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:51,094
And I don't shy away
from the lot. It's critical.

299
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,628
<i>That's good. It's critical
at the Augusta Plus store too.</i>

300
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,834
We have public housing right there.

301
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:01,437
Yeah, it's a balancing act. You need safety,
but you also need good community relations.

302
00:20:01,514 --> 00:20:03,914
I'm glad you mentioned
community relations.

303
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:08,716
The housing- those are our neighbors,
our customers too.

304
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:11,450
It's important to get along.

305
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:15,619
Doug, what's this?

306
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:20,862
<i>- I grabbed this on the 19th.
- That's out of line.</i>

307
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:22,764
Yeah.

308
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:28,535
- When did you get that?
- June 19th, at your deli, on the refrigeration unit.

309
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:33,772
<i>- I think this is B.S.
- It is B.S.</i>

310
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:37,111
I was probably on lot that day.
I like it out there.

311
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:39,743
Who was inside?

312
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:45,052
Maybe... Richard?

313
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:51,425
- Richard Wehlner.
- Yeah. Mmm.

314
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:55,558
I think so. Yep.

315
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:59,798
<i>You think he was on Deli,
or he was on Deli?</i>

316
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,441
Was on Deli.

317
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:07,912
Send him in.

318
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:15,818
<i>Doug, these aren't great.</i>

319
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:20,985
Bear down. We'll get some fresh cards.
We'll take it from there.

320
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,153
I like what you're saying.

321
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:26,289
I need to like what you're doing
a little more.

322
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,299
Thank you.

323
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,168
- How'd it go?
- Good.

324
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:41,311
<i>Hello, gentlemen.</i>

325
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,213
<i>I'm Richard Wehlner.
Thank you for your valuable time.</i>

326
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,581
Nice to meet you, sir.
Richard Wehlner.

327
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:50,213
Hi. How do you do?
Thank you for your valuable time.

328
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:05,359
In Canada, we don't say-

329
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:14,745
"Cutting the cheese" simply means
cutting the actual cheese.

330
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:18,978
It doesn't have a double thing,
so I just missed it.

331
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,221
Because in Canada, it's "cracking. "

332
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:29,660
- The expression.
- It's "cracking" in Canada. Yeah.

333
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:33,220
We "crack the cheese. "

334
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,266
"Cracking it"?

335
00:22:49,582 --> 00:22:51,550
"Cracking the cheese"?

336
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:55,779
So I simply really believed
that Rogelio...

337
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:58,449
had been given
an intra-Deli award...

338
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,924
for cutting the actual cheese.

339
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,188
I'm sorry.

340
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:23,040
I simply believed Rogelio
had been given an intra-Deli-

341
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:27,074
I heard you the first time.
Listen. We have permit delays.

342
00:23:27,152 --> 00:23:31,088
We're on hold this month.
We won't be deciding for a few weeks.

343
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,818
Make up the ground.

344
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:36,157
<i>- Okay?
- Okay.</i>

345
00:23:36,228 --> 00:23:38,093
Then that's all.

346
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:40,461
Well, thank you for gimme-

347
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:44,435
for giving me your valuable time.

348
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:52,571
Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.
Thank you, sir, for your time.

349
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:54,909
Thank you for this- for this moment.

350
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,416
Thank you very much, Mr. Cranston.
Appreciate it.

351
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:02,614
Thank you very much, sir, for your time
today. You are a valuable person to me.

352
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:06,317
And I am sorry
about this cutting business.

353
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:08,326
That's the end of that.

354
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:10,919
No more cheese business.

355
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:18,035
<i>Last stop, financial district.</i>

356
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:27,544
<i>So I never got to go over my cool
bullet points because of the fart gag joke.</i>

357
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:30,480
The whole board saw it.
It was uncool.

358
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:32,949
Why don't you
forget about it for now?

359
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:36,454
I want you to blow off some steam.
I have an idea.

360
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:39,514
I signed us up for dance lessons.

361
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,992
- Oh, I don't know.
- Let's go for it.

362
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:45,656
- Let's do salsa. It's so beautiful.
- Not when I do it.

363
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:48,791
It's gonna be,
because you're a beautiful guy.

364
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:57,072
I don't know if I can do it.
Here, sweetie. Ready?

365
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:02,805
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna backslide.

366
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:08,151
All right. Let's go dancin'.

367
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,087
Ready? Whoo!

368
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:29,865
- How many pages is that?
- Eight pages.

369
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:36,607
It's so quiet.

370
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:07,908
Okay. Now we just need that $12,000 check-
the earnest money check.

371
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,076
If I can't make the big 10% down payment
in August, I can get this back, right?

372
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:17,487
Like, uh, if I don't get this job
that I thought I was gonna get?

373
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:21,925
Um, you forfeit that.
It will be a forfeiture in that amount.

374
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:24,121
- Is that bad?
- Yes.

375
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:28,428
"Forfeit," as in, you don't
get the money back.

376
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,594
The seller keeps the money.
It's so they're not hung out to dry...

377
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,298
and it's also a way
of preventing schmucks...

378
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,398
from trying to purchase
houses they can't afford.

379
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:38,670
Yeah. Schmucks.

380
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,508
- What are you talking about?
- Schmucks who buy houses they can't afford.

381
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,140
- Are there really schmucks like that?
- Well, every once in a while...

382
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:46,343
we'll encounter a schmuck like that-
not often.

383
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:52,851
<i>- Hey! Man, what the hell?
- Ah!</i>

384
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,588
Holy shit.

385
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:59,290
- That was "Teddy"?
- Yeah.

386
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:02,663
- He's smaller than I imagined.
- Yeah, well, he's got a lot of stamina.

387
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:08,906
<i>It took us five years to save $ 12,000...</i>

388
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,204
<i>and I might have
just schmucked it away.</i>

389
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,744
<i>So Richard might be
a nice recovering drug guy...</i>

390
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:17,509
<i>but if I could slide ahead of him at the
company retreat, I was going to do it.</i>

391
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:22,145
Hey, leaders in quality foods,
the Donaldson's difference- it's people.

392
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:25,987
<i>And all of you-
here's the great news- are people.</i>

393
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:29,391
<i>Now concentration allows you
to shut out distraction.</i>

394
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:32,453
Shutting out distraction, gang,
allows you...

395
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:36,661
to accomplish your goals
and achieve new heights!

396
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,006
Get it in here, Chicagoland Donaldson's.
Come on.

397
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:46,044
<i>Tout de suite it in here, make a stack
of hands. Right here in the middle.</i>

398
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,477
<i>Let's go.
Bunch of hands, here we go. Ready?</i>

399
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:52,244
Now let's make it happen on "one. "
Ready on "one"? One!

400
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:56,083
Let's make it happen!

401
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,153
<i>Here we go. Let's go.
You can do this, Mitch. Concentration.</i>

402
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:03,592
And... block out distraction. Easy.

403
00:28:03,662 --> 00:28:06,825
Here we go, Aaron.
That's it. That's it. That's it!

404
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:09,629
Doug, you can do it.
Block out distraction.

405
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:12,499
Block out distraction.
Very good.

406
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:17,031
<i>What do you think, Richard?
Here we go. And-</i>

407
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:20,601
It's not hot! It's not hot!

408
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:24,046
You've essentially attained your goal.
Blockin' out distractions!

409
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:26,050
Who's next?
Who's next?

410
00:28:26,118 --> 00:28:28,678
Let's do it, Steve. You've got it.
You've got it. You've got it!

411
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:32,986
This guy's done this before, right?
You did this before on some weird island?

412
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:35,492
Here we go.
Hey, burgundy jumpsuit!

413
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:38,553
<i>Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.</i>

414
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:46,031
Scott, you just concentrate,
concentrate, concentrate.

415
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:52,601
He didn't block out the distractions.

416
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,771
<i>- Just get in the pool. You can try it again.
- Stop!</i>

417
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:59,079
That's all right.
This is why we sign waivers, everybody.

418
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:02,951
All right. Put the bags
on over your head. Everyone.

419
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:06,718
Right over the top.
Perfect. Okay.

420
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:12,628
Now, I want you to take off one thing
that you don't need... quickly! Come on!

421
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:27,572
Let's take something else off
that you really don't need... right away!

422
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:36,120
<i>Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Something else you
don't need. Let's make it happen. Come on!</i>

423
00:29:36,188 --> 00:29:40,420
<i>- Something else you don't need.
Come on. Let's go.</i>

424
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:43,120
<i>Something completely unnecessary.</i>

425
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:48,659
Doug, can we take our sack off?

426
00:29:48,734 --> 00:29:50,759
What?

427
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:54,272
- Did you take your sack off?
- I can't really hear you.

428
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:59,038
People, take off one more thing that you
simply do... not... need.

429
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:03,344
- Do it.
- Fuck.

430
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:17,695
<i>Okay, um-</i>

431
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:23,561
All right, everybody that still has a bag
on top of their heads, scream...

432
00:30:23,635 --> 00:30:26,798
"My concentration skills
need improvement. "

433
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:30,672
<i>- One, two, three.
- My concentration skills need improvement!</i>

434
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:35,880
<i>Easy with the laughter.</i>

435
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,939
Easy with that.

436
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:46,183
<i>That's enough. All right.</i>

437
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,886
<i>- Who's up for some team building, huh?
Let's do it!</i>

438
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:51,794
<i>Let's head over
to the productivity obstacle course.</i>

439
00:30:51,863 --> 00:30:53,797
Guy, slap the clothes back on.

440
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:56,663
Let's just watch the assumptions.
That's all it is.

441
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,268
Yeah, is this Chicagoland Pepsi?

442
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,774
Connect to Kevin Conoway, please?

443
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:06,810
Richard Wehlner.

444
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:13,208
<i>Brighten the week with a
sweet from Donaldson's...</i>

445
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,776
<i>the champion of excellence.</i>

446
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:45,674
Scott, lot the full week?

447
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:50,950
Pepsi's sending a new season of stuff.
Yep. Kevin wants Richard.

448
00:31:51,023 --> 00:31:55,926
- PepsiCo's chips and paperware-
- That's six days of bad cards from the lot.

449
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,985
I got two weeks before the board
decides about Augusta.

450
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:01,464
That's one week of suck cards.
Come on, Fargas.

451
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:04,127
- What, are you callin' me by my last name now?
- Scott.

452
00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:08,366
Kevin wants Richard. That's Pepsi.
Don't make a stink about it.

453
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,104
You know what? I'm takin' lot. Give it
to me. They got lot concerns at Augusta.

454
00:32:13,178 --> 00:32:16,170
I'm gonna get some prime lot cards.
I'm gonna show 'em I can do it.

455
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,239
- Awesome.
- I'm gonna jam for six days.

456
00:32:18,316 --> 00:32:20,250
Awesome.

457
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:23,378
Let's make it happen!

458
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:34,426
Hey, remove yourself! Get your pizza
off there. Get your butt off my car!

459
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:37,525
<i>Fuck you, Mr. Chopsticks.
You Chungking fuck ass.</i>

460
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:41,834
<i>Hey, show some respect! Where is someone?
Can someone please help me?</i>

461
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:49,003
That's addressed to the board,
for the cards.

462
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:51,572
They want the fresh ones.

463
00:32:55,387 --> 00:32:59,050
<i>Gordon "Jiminy. " A kid hanging
out in your lot kidney punched me...</i>

464
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:03,322
<i>because I offended him,
I guess, by doing nothing.</i>

465
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:05,590
<i>Kidney punched me.</i>

466
00:33:05,664 --> 00:33:08,462
<i>There's a little bit
of a lack of security in your lot...</i>

467
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:11,764
<i>'cause your security guy
was sleeping in my car.</i>

468
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:13,994
Okay. The, uh-
The fucking chip is fixed...

469
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:17,728
and, uh, here we go-
right towards my own private vehicle...

470
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:20,362
<i>because that's how much confiidence
I have in this.</i>

471
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:22,463
Remember, this could be
your daughter.

472
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:27,978
Fuck!

473
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:31,743
...as I offer you
a blueprint for success in the workplace.

474
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:36,150
And, like the eagle, you'll create
a commanding atmosphere around-

475
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,155
Richard Wehlner.

476
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:41,090
<i>If you ever have to choose between
working inside and outside...</i>

477
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,651
<i>at a major American grocery store,
choose inside.</i>

478
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:49,063
<i>Inside you have some freedom.
You have places to hide.</i>

479
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:56,301
<i>You can catch a breeze off the dairy cooler.
The girls work inside.</i>

480
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:02,338
Mmm.

481
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,644
<i>Outside sucks.</i>

482
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:08,015
<i>I just wanted to let you know
that everything was top-notch.</i>

483
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:10,281
Yes.

484
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:12,687
<i>You guys are really
getting your shit together.</i>

485
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:17,854
<i>I fuckin' had it for a while there,
but I've sensed a shift. Hey, good shift.</i>

486
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:20,864
<i>Keep on truckin' in that direction.</i>

487
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,866
<i>I'll be a repeat customer.</i>

488
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:30,596
...cuttin' grass and shit?

489
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:34,270
I can call the police. So, just so you know,
this is Donaldson's property. You're trespassing.

490
00:35:34,346 --> 00:35:36,337
- I'm on a parkin' lot.
- It's our lot.

491
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:40,180
<i>- Fuck you.
- Heh, your ma's courteous. She took my ride, sissy.</i>

492
00:35:40,252 --> 00:35:44,018
What does that mean?
Hey! Well, give 'em back!

493
00:35:44,089 --> 00:35:46,649
Fuckin' get 'em.

494
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,818
Fuck!

495
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:55,365
Fuck!

496
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:58,027
Fuck you, man, you know?
Back up.

497
00:35:58,103 --> 00:36:00,503
- Back what?
- Back up. I'm not fuckin' around, dick.

498
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:03,040
What you call me, motherfucker?

499
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:06,373
Get off the lot! Get off me!

500
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:09,504
- Is he serious?
- Hey, he can't be fuckin' serious.

501
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:12,141
- Have a nice day!
- Have a nice day!

502
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:16,677
<i>You have a nice day, fuckin' assholes!</i>

503
00:36:22,427 --> 00:36:24,361
Aren't you on lot?

504
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:26,920
I'm tryin' to fix these cards.
They got messed up.

505
00:36:26,998 --> 00:36:29,023
Don't forget, those go in today.

506
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,864
Half hour, I'm gonna go down there.

507
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:35,201
- Who's on lot?
- Just Bredon. Keith's sick.

508
00:36:35,273 --> 00:36:38,606
<i>Ah, put Octavio out.
He can come off Deli.</i>

509
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:40,611
We got it covered.
You have the vest?

510
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:43,409
In my locker.

511
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,779
- Thanks, Scott.
- All right.

512
00:36:56,027 --> 00:36:58,518
I don't know what you say.

513
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,559
<i>I was trying to figure out
if Brian... "Grall's"card...</i>

514
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:11,098
<i>said, "Your employees were very...
courageous"?</i>

515
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:17,270
<i>I wondered,
were any of them courageous?</i>

516
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:20,910
<i>Esteban? No.
Little Esteban? No.</i>

517
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:30,722
<i>- Hey.
- Then I thought, fuck.</i>

518
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:35,391
<i>I found a whole stack
of D.E. 's in your locker.</i>

519
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:40,360
- Stauber.
- Yeah.

520
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:42,929
A whole stack.

521
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:47,068
Scott, man, lot's so messed up.

522
00:37:47,145 --> 00:37:49,943
<i>I know it is,
but it's not about you, okay?</i>

523
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:53,211
I'm going down to the Augusta Plus.

524
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:58,517
Why don't you pack your stack and take a
ride with me? I wanna see you hand these over.

525
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,524
<i>Pack your stack.</i>

526
00:38:00,592 --> 00:38:04,119
A lot of the guys, when they're goin' out
to assist customers with their bags...

527
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:06,129
they're doin'
some lollygaggin' outside.

528
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:08,131
And everyone wants to get fresh air.

529
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,633
<i>Don't get me wrong.
I like fresh air...</i>

530
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:14,866
<i>but we need you inside,
or else we're short-</i>

531
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:21,441
<i>Several young men taunted me with chants...</i>

532
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:25,472
<i>of "ching chong Chinaman"
and "cinnamon face"!</i>

533
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,249
You know what? I'd like you
to read them to me right now.

534
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:34,018
- Out loud?
- No, read them to me silently.

535
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:43,561
"My grocery list didn't include
sexual harassment, but thanks.

536
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:46,433
Beth Kopins, 84."

537
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:52,035
- You want me to read all of these?
- Yes.

538
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,203
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry?

539
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,974
That's on the card.

540
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:01,576
"Fuck, that was a great
shopping experience. "

541
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:04,087
- It doesn't say that, does it?
- No.

542
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:07,022
What does it say then?

543
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:12,960
<i>Not a good demonstration
of my managerial skills.</i>

544
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:16,728
<i>But I just decided to bear down,
motivate my staff to raise their game...</i>

545
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:19,167
<i>and just get more hands-on.</i>

546
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:21,688
<i>I was going to handle it. I was going
to keep my cool and handle anything.</i>

547
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:24,139
<i>I was going to handle it. I was going
to keep my cool and handle anything.</i>

548
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:27,770
<i>- Then something happened: The Tater
Tot incident- - You're on the lot.</i>

549
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:30,508
<i>Provoked by what I call
the "Yoo-hoo smash. "</i>

550
00:39:30,582 --> 00:39:32,516
<i>Full Yoo-hoo.</i>

551
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:37,248
<i>Fuck!</i>

552
00:39:37,322 --> 00:39:40,849
- That's assault! I'm callin' the police. You're gone!
- Suck my dick.

553
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:43,587
<i>- You're fucking gone.
All spiced up with a little Mace.</i>

554
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,464
- I mean, what did he do? Did he grab you?
- He, like-

555
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:53,731
A bottle hit me,
and then he tugged at my shirt.

556
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:56,774
- He threw it?
- I don't know, someone in the group!

557
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:59,435
Hey, you Maced him full in the face.
He's in the hospital.

558
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:02,947
<i>- Why don't you calm down?
- He hit me in the head with a bottle. It's out there.</i>

559
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:05,414
<i>Look, pal, there's a lot of bottles out there.</i>

560
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:07,951
What I know is, he's got a face
full of liquid frenzine...

561
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:12,149
<i>his mom and dad are upset, and I'm tryin'
to figure out what he did to you.</i>

562
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:17,092
<i>They wanna talk to somebody-
an owner, they said.</i>

563
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:19,254
I have to call the board.
Frig.

564
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:22,788
- Man, he grabbed me.
- Are you going to press charges?

565
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:27,236
<i>I don't know. I have to talk to the board.
Are they? Can they?</i>

566
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:30,797
I don't know.
The parents are upset.

567
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:45,515
Javier, what are you-
You just left these here?

568
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,615
The bag's damaged.

569
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:51,184
What, are they gonna melt?
Come on, man.

570
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,167
This is bullshit.

571
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:00,796
This... is...

572
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:02,840
bull...

573
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:05,569
- shit!
- Ow!

574
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:08,339
- Hey! Whoa!
- What?

575
00:41:08,413 --> 00:41:11,849
- He's whippin' stuff at me.
- I was tossing them out. He walked right in front of me.

576
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:14,976
It hit me in the wrist.
They're heavy.

577
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:17,044
Ow. They're frozen.

578
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:20,955
- Fuck you, Wehlner.
- What is your problem?

579
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:23,152
You want to file an in-store?

580
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:27,288
- What?
- An in-store. An in-store complaint?

581
00:41:27,365 --> 00:41:30,823
Geez. I don't know. It just-

582
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:33,029
They're pretty dense.
They're frozen potatoes.

583
00:41:33,104 --> 00:41:36,471
- Man, fuck you, Richard.
- What is your f'ing problem?

584
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:44,210
Something's wrong.
What's been bothering you?

585
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,041
You know, in the case
I don't get this job-

586
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,713
in a weird case
I don't get this job-

587
00:41:50,788 --> 00:41:53,985
it's going to be four more years,
because there's no new store planned.

588
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:58,017
You're making too much of this new job.
I mean, I can go back to school-

589
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:00,121
there's night school-
and be a practitioner.

590
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:03,895
You don't need this pressure. We can do it
together, just like we've done everything so far.

591
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:07,404
<i>Jen, I don't want you waiting for the bus
at night in February.</i>

592
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:12,171
<i>You already work two shifts.
Night school? You don't want to go back.</i>

593
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:15,576
- I don't want to, but I will.
- You're not going to.

594
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:17,774
- Doug, look out!
- Oh, fuck.

595
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:19,282
<i>- Hey! Hey!
- Hey.</i>

596
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,682
Hey! Hey!
What's your fucking problem?

597
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:26,019
He has an issue with the coupons.

598
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,789
- What, man? What issue? - Y-You do not honor
the coupons anymore for his snacks, yeah?

599
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:34,423
- All right. I'll honor your coupons. Stop slapping me.
- Okay? Stop?

600
00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:39,061
You can't go around slapping people.
What country are you from, Insane Land?

601
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:41,731
<i>Hey, Jen.</i>

602
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:46,636
- Hey, guy.
- Hey.

603
00:42:55,153 --> 00:42:57,087
<i>I wonder if anyone else here...</i>

604
00:42:57,155 --> 00:42:59,749
<i>got slapped in the eyes yesterday
over a graham cracker snack?</i>

605
00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,849
<i>Probably not.</i>

606
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:04,622
<i>I'm just gonna try to forget
about that particular embarrassment...</i>

607
00:43:04,696 --> 00:43:06,664
<i>via some beers.</i>

608
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:13,560
<i>Hey. Wanna top me off there,
Teddy Grahams?</i>

609
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:20,344
Are you enjoying your drink?

610
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:23,244
<i>Then I started working
at the grocery, and-</i>

611
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:26,408
<i>You know, that's been pretty okay.</i>

612
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:28,782
Because you can have
a family, you know?

613
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:31,481
<i>And, uh, move up in administration.</i>

614
00:43:31,556 --> 00:43:34,081
Save a little money.
You know what I'm talkin' about.

615
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:35,682
<i>- Yeah.
- You know?</i>

616
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,819
So it's been good-

617
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:40,261
till this guy from Quebec
comes along.

618
00:43:40,331 --> 00:43:42,128
You told me about that already.

619
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,828
<i>- I did?
- Yeah.</i>

620
00:43:44,902 --> 00:43:47,166
<i>Hey, I have an idea.</i>

621
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:50,469
<i>Let's get down sexually right now...</i>

622
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,532
<i>while you play the banjo.</i>

623
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,477
<i>- Good idea.
- Is that even possible?</i>

624
00:43:57,815 --> 00:43:59,783
<i>Oh, that's the spot, dude.</i>

625
00:43:59,851 --> 00:44:03,514
<i>- Oh, right on.
- I guess so.</i>

626
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:05,852
<i>I had to get up early that morning, too...</i>

627
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,289
<i>to write a Mace apology speech
for the community center.</i>

628
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:11,522
<i>I hadn't written a speech since Webelos.</i>

629
00:44:11,596 --> 00:44:14,497
"While on a courtesy patrol,
the group of young men...

630
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,557
"approached a Donaldson's customer and me
while making threats...

631
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:20,468
and I was struck in the head
by a bottle of Yoo-hoo. "

632
00:44:24,942 --> 00:44:27,877
How do you know
who threw that Yoo-hoo?

633
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:33,708
I noticed, um, previous to the thing...

634
00:44:33,785 --> 00:44:37,243
That the young man that I had
the altercation with was drinking Yoo-hoo.

635
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:41,587
After I was struck, I noticed that he wasn't
drinking Yoo-hoo anymore.

636
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,188
And there was no one else
in the lot, so-

637
00:44:46,264 --> 00:44:50,223
"I discharged a single pull of Mace
in his direction. "

638
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:52,360
I'm glad he's recovered.

639
00:44:52,436 --> 00:44:57,100
"But the incident only occurred because
customer care is priority one at Donaldson's.

640
00:44:57,175 --> 00:45:01,236
<i>"It would have happened
if the customer's safety was threatened...</i>

641
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:04,748

778
00:54:20,637 --> 00:54:24,004

Because that's a man.

779
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:26,269

780
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:29,608

00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,944
man, that-that "all the way" love-

782
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:37,819
then you could be even,
like, a midget or something...

784

So go on, let it shine.

785
00:54:45,095 --> 00:54:47,962

796
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,498

- Mark, you remember Doug.

797
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:24,728
- Yeah. Hey. Teddy Grahams.
- Yeah, hey.

798
00:55:24,802 --> 00:55:27,635
- We got surgery at 10:00. A
cleft palate- two-year-old. - Okay.

799
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:33,233
- What's a cleft palate? - It's a
deformation of the "mascus"- the lower face.

800
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:36,643
Medically, it's "masculari horriblus"...

801
00:55:36,713 --> 00:55:39,841
which is Latin for "monster face. "

802
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:44,013
And I guess some of these kids
really do feel like monsters.

00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:47,147
But we restore them to normalcy.

806
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:03,099
- What? Tell me what.
- Nothing. I'll see you tonight.

807
00:56:03,173 --> 00:56:04,902
Okay.

808
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:08,101
- Let me show you something.
- Yeah.

809
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:19,082
<i>One way to go from planning to tell
the truth to telling another lie...</i>

810
00:56:19,156 --> 00:56:22,887
<i>is to find a gift from your wife-
who has no money-</i>

811
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,121
<i>of some long-sleeved shirts...</i>

812
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:27,129
<i>because she believes
you'll dress more formally...</i>

813
00:56:27,197 --> 00:56:30,894
<i>as the shoo-in boss of a large grocery
because you said this.</i>

814
00:56:30,968 --> 00:56:34,028
<i>When the truth is you might
stay a "short sleever"...</i>

815
00:56:34,104 --> 00:56:37,972
<i>for the foreseeable future
of thousands of days.</i>

816
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:40,771
- Hey. I like my shirts.
- Hey.

817
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:43,074
What are you doing?

818
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:46,707
It's for night school-
for the school thing, for just in case.

819
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:48,717
I thought I should do it.

820
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:52,585
- Are you worried?
- No. But just in case.

821
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:55,489
I didn't want to miss the sign-up.
I want to save a spot.

822
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:59,222
- You have to write a check?
- 180.

823
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:03,297
Don't. Because I got the job.

824
00:57:03,367 --> 00:57:05,835
- They decided?
- Yeah. I got the job.

825
00:57:05,903 --> 00:57:09,168
- Doug! You are great!
- Yeah.

826
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:12,641
Good-bye, banjo fuckers!

827
00:57:12,709 --> 00:57:14,643
Yeah.

828
00:57:20,918 --> 00:57:22,852
<i>I don't know what that was.</i>

829
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,252
<i>A lie wish?</i>

830
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:27,984
<i>Way to go, Doug!</i>

831
00:57:30,193 --> 00:57:32,127
Whoo.

832
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,478
<i>Hey, Scott, I wanted to mention, um-</i>

833
00:57:56,553 --> 00:57:58,544
My wrist is acting up a little...

834
00:57:58,622 --> 00:58:01,147
from the Tater Tot thing.

835
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:05,160
So I think I should
probably do that in-store.

836
00:58:05,228 --> 00:58:06,991
The in-store complaint?

837
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:09,157
- Yeah.
- All right.

838
00:58:09,232 --> 00:58:11,666
That circulates through the company-

839
00:58:11,735 --> 00:58:14,727
to the board, everywhere.

840
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:18,901
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I think that's probably for the best.

841
00:58:18,976 --> 00:58:21,001
You know, in case he does it
to somebody else.

842
00:58:22,379 --> 00:58:26,315
- Okay. I'll get the forms.
- Thanks, Scott.

843
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:30,717
Because it's flaring up.

844

<i>They're for gross and flagrant violation

00:59:11,395 --> 00:59:13,329

853
00:59:13,397 --> 00:59:17,060

<i>tojobs their wives already

855
00:59:23,774 --> 00:59:27,540
<i>Oye. I heard from Scott.</i>

856
00:59:27,611 --> 00:59:31,240
He say you into gymnastics

Right. Uh-

861
00:59:55,572 --> 00:59:58,302
My wife-

862
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:04,841
Due to circumstances, my wife
won't be able to be my partner anymore...

863
01:00:04,915 --> 01:00:07,076
and that's cash money.

864
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:10,176
You can transfer your deposit
if you like.

865
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:13,120

- Hey, Hardy.

01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:39,946
- How you doin'?
- Doin' good.

871
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:43,247
<i>- What'd you do last night?
- Went to the movies with my sister.</i>

872
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,345
- You did? That sounds awesome.
- Yeah.

873
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:47,356
<i>- Guess what.
- What?</i>

874
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:51,554
- I'm growing a mustache.
- All right. That's cool.

875
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:54,654
Hey, Hardy, you're doing a great job
in the store here.

876
01:00:54,731 --> 01:00:56,722
- Thanks. You too, man.
- Keep it up.

01:01:08,779 --> 01:01:11,543
<i>- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.</i>

878
01:01:11,615 --> 01:01:14,413
Just... Hardy.

<i>Itjust gets sad sometimes.</i>

880
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,645
Do you know why Hardy's hand
is powdered?

881
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:22,419
Why?

882
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:25,518
'Cause retarded guys
masturbate so much...

883
01:01:25,595 --> 01:01:28,689
that they rub the skin
off their penises.

884
01:01:28,765 --> 01:01:32,257
It's just- They don't know better.

885
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:35,463
Just- They have a hard time
not jerkin' off.

886
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,070
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

887
01:01:41,778 --> 01:01:45,305
- Scott in?
- Yeah.

888
01:01:45,382 --> 01:01:48,613
- I think Scott's in Receiving.
- Okay.

889
01:01:48,685 --> 01:01:50,846
- I wanted to ask you a question about the application.
- No problem.

890
01:01:50,921 --> 01:01:52,855
I'll see you guys later, all right?

891
01:01:52,923 --> 01:01:54,857
Hey, fellas.

892
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:01,420
What was he doing?

893
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:05,525
- Was he talking about jacking off?
- Richard?

894
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:08,070
He was talking about jacking it?

895
01:02:08,138 --> 01:02:10,072
In front of customers?
Jacking dicks?

896
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:27,150
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

897
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,814
F. You!

898
01:02:51,882 --> 01:02:54,646
- What?
- I didn't say that.

899
01:02:54,718 --> 01:02:57,585
They asked me what you said.
That's what you said.

900
01:02:57,654 --> 01:03:00,953
- You know what? Fuck you, Doug.
- That's what you said.

901
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:03,424
How's your wrist?
How's your wrist, Richard?

902
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:05,757
- You're bogus.
- I'm bogus?

903
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:09,162
You lace that thing on, try to fuck me out of a job
- out of money for me and my wife.

904
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:10,961
Those things weigh 62 grams.

905
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:14,868
I don't know what a gram is,
but I guess that's a lot 'cause you're hurt.

906
01:03:14,938 --> 01:03:16,872
Get off me, Wehlner!

907
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:19,306
See you later, Tappy.

908
01:03:19,376 --> 01:03:22,277
What, are you wearing tap shoes?

909
01:03:22,345 --> 01:03:24,279
Lori left me, little boy.

910
01:03:24,347 --> 01:03:26,713
It's the only class
I can attend as a single.

911
01:03:26,783 --> 01:03:29,149
Goddamn! Come on!

912
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:36,549
<i>Is that guy wearing tap shoes?</i>

913
01:03:40,297 --> 01:03:42,731
Come on!

914
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,391
- Fuck off!
- Yeah?

915
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:46,367
Come on, dick!
Come on!

916
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:51,139
- Fuck you!
- Hold it! Not cool!

917
01:03:53,076 --> 01:03:55,738
Not cool! Go inside.

918
01:03:57,814 --> 01:04:00,282
Sorry, Scott.

919
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,477
<i>- Dancing bear.
- Yeah, wife liar!</i>

920
01:04:06,723 --> 01:04:09,385
<i>I was lunching with Jen...</i>

921
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:12,394
<i>trying to forget about it and roll into
the crucial second interview.</i>

922
01:04:13,496 --> 01:04:16,522
<i>Then I spied that Big World.</i>

923
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:18,624
<i>Remember Do-Good and Dodo?</i>

924
01:04:19,903 --> 01:04:23,031
<i>Dodo makes lunchtime
unpleasant for everyone.</i>

925
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:36,210
<i>Do-Good shares his peanut brittle
with the new... Negro.</i>

926
01:04:38,588 --> 01:04:40,613
"Negro"?

927
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,557
What the fuck?

928
01:04:47,263 --> 01:04:49,959
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

929
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:54,435
<i>Sometimes, Do-Good cleans up a mess...</i>

930
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,438
<i>even if he didn't make it.</i>

931
01:04:58,775 --> 01:05:02,267
<i>Dodo is sometimes simply
not a good young man.</i>

932
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,827
<i>Hey, Lori. It's me.</i>

933
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:28,928
Hey, uh, tomorrow's the big day-
the final sit-down.

934
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:31,371
You know, the final interview thing.

935
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:33,568
Then they make their decision.

936
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:36,111
Hey, guess what.
I'm taking tap dancing.

937
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:39,945
The studio wouldn't give me
the deposit back, so I'm tappin'.

938
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:42,177
I've gotta say I really like it.
It's real-

939
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:44,982
It's a real dance style.
Very expressive.

940
01:05:45,055 --> 01:05:48,183
Um, anyway, whatever.
I'm still dancin', practicin'.

941
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:50,192
And, uh-

942
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,785
Listen, Lori.

943
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:55,092
I love you, and I miss you.

944
01:05:56,633 --> 01:05:58,362
Bye.

945
01:05:58,435 --> 01:06:02,804
<i>#And deep down

946
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:07,737

<i>really critical days in his life-

950
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:21,914
<i>a few days that can totally determine
the quality of his future.</i>

951
01:06:21,991 --> 01:06:26,655
<i>This chapter is dedicated to helping you-

opportunities many of us will actually have.</i>

<i># Oh, I know it hurts

960
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:01,556
<i>#But it's time for me to fly #</i>

968
01:07:22,352 --> 01:07:24,582
<i>Because I didn't pay
for the licensing.</i>

969
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:31,217
You have to pull the card back out.

01:07:36,766 --> 01:07:40,964
<i>Orange Line, Midway. Now changing to direct.</i>

01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:02,079
<i># Whenever Paul #</i>

975
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:06,944
<i># Thinks of rain #</i>

976
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:12,855
<i>#Swallows fall #</i>

977
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,692

978

979
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:28,709
Chapter 12. "Finishing Strong. "

980
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:32,407
I've written this chapter
as a reminder of your new skills.

981
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:35,846
Perhaps you'll choose
to listen to this passage...

982
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:38,443
on the morning
of your most important day.

983
01:09:39,722 --> 01:09:43,488
So here it goes,
because you're ready.

984
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:45,493
Richard Wehlner-

985
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,495
is totally number one.

986
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:50,896
Because- Richard Wehlner-

987
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:52,901
shows true grit.

988
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:57,303
Richard Wehlner
- is not afraid to put others under his thumb...

989
01:09:57,373 --> 01:10:03,175
<i>because- Richard Wehlner-
totally does more than what's expected.</i>

990
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:05,407
<i>#Rings just once #</i>

991
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:11,010
<i>#Late at night #</i>

992
01:10:11,087 --> 01:10:15,217
<i>#Like a bird #</i>

993
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,885
<i>#Don't be scared #</i>

994
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,988
<i>#Don't believe
you're all alone #</i>

995
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:30,132
<i># Wake #</i>

996
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:34,905
<i># Wake up, Paul #</i>

997
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:39,710
<i># Whisper clouds #</i>

998
01:10:39,782 --> 01:10:45,152
<i>#Rolling by #</i>

999
01:10:45,221 --> 01:10:50,386
<i>#And the seeds ##</i>

1000
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:55,621
<i>Is there anything you'd like to add?</i>

1001
01:10:55,698 --> 01:10:58,428
Just that I'd give
the new store my all.

1002
01:10:58,501 --> 01:11:00,435
I think you would.

1003
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:03,233
Good. So if there's nothing else...

1004
01:11:03,306 --> 01:11:05,297
send in jack apples.

1005
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:09,605
<i>Let's get apple jacker's
interview over with.</i>

1006
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,580
That cheese cracker.

1007
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:20,988
Good luck.

1008
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:23,048
Because you're gonna need it.

1009
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,457
<i>Before I get Richard,
I just-</i>

1010
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:35,503
We have this bag boy
- Hardy. I wanted to tell you that, when you thought...

1011
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:39,007
that Richard Wehlner
was talking trash talk, as you said...

1012
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:42,943
Richard was just letting me know there are
parts of Hardy's life that made him sad.

1013
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:46,539
- That's all.
- Which parts?

1014
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:53,712
Um, the parts where Hardy
can't stop masturbating his penis.

1015
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,726
<i>So he has a powdered right hand
for a deterrent.</i>

1016
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:03,822
Wouldn't powder make
the experience better?

1017
01:12:05,134 --> 01:12:08,592
Uh, probably, but-

1018
01:12:08,671 --> 01:12:13,540
This is a specific powder
with sandpaper-like qualities, I think.

1019
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:17,340
<i>All I'm saying is that-
Richard is a good guy.</i>

1020
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:20,983
<i>He's not out of line
or inappropriate.</i>

1021
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,518
I wanted you to know.

1022
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:25,577
He's a real good grocer.

1023
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:28,215
So if there was
no inappropriate talk...

1024
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,657
I guess that leaves you guys
on equal footing.

1025
01:12:34,397 --> 01:12:37,423
Yeah. I guess.

1026
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:41,228
Tell Richard we'll be with him
in five minutes.

1027
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:48,735
Are you all done?

1028
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:51,678
They said wait around.

1029
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:54,648
- For what?
- They didn't say.

1030
01:12:54,717 --> 01:12:56,708
They just said wait around.

1031
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,155
I'm fucked.

1032
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:12,622
Hey. Richard.

1033
01:14:14,263 --> 01:14:16,197
Doug.

1034
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,698
We're all just out here
tryin' to get some food.

1035
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:24,271
Sometimes we bump into each other.

1036
01:14:33,749 --> 01:14:35,683
Stay loose, Doug.

1037
01:14:47,063 --> 01:14:50,624
<i>#Every day, I'm gonna
strut that stuff #</i>

1038
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,895
Hey. I've enjoyed our time together.

1039
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:55,164
But now it's time
for you to get out there...

1040
01:14:55,237 --> 01:14:57,762
and just kick everyone's ass.

1041
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,209
See you at the yacht club, my good friend-
Richard Wehln-

1042
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:18,518
- Do one thing for me.
- Yeah, babe.

1043
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:20,755
You fix that little ship...

1044
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:23,765
and you keep it cool
and keep it clean, mister.

1045
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:27,166
- Chrissie's sleepin'.
- Okay.

1046
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:37,735
<i>Don't get f'ing tangled.
Come on.</i>

1047
01:15:44,553 --> 01:15:46,544
Tell me again why you're not at work.

1048
01:15:46,622 --> 01:15:48,852
I carved out some free time.

1049
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:51,791
- On your first day?
- Yep.

1050
01:15:56,165 --> 01:15:58,326
You didn't start
your new job today, did you?

1051
01:15:59,402 --> 01:16:01,336
No.

1052
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:06,840
You didn't actually get it yet,
did you?

1053
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:08,934
No.

1054
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:11,138
Doug, why did you tell me that?

1055
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:13,807
I said I could go back to school.

1056
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:17,148
I want to be the primary
breadwinner, Jen. Come on.

1057
01:16:19,922 --> 01:16:21,913
Female lions do the hunting.

1058
01:16:23,592 --> 01:16:26,390
I'm not a lion.

1059
01:16:26,462 --> 01:16:28,453
I'm a guy.

1060
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:30,829
<i>Get up there, son of a b.</i>

1061
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:44,274
- I was embarrassed.
- About what?

1062
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:46,280
Our life.

1063
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:48,839
- And George Washington Carver.
- George-

1064
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,216
Who made all this stuff
out of peanuts-

1065
01:16:51,287 --> 01:16:53,221
blankets, peanut silverware...

1066
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:55,223
a peanut car, a peanut gun.

1067
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:57,623
<i>- No, he didn't.
- He made some peanut stuff.</i>

1068
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,854
And he was a slave.

1069
01:16:59,929 --> 01:17:02,159
I should've made something by now.

1070
01:17:02,231 --> 01:17:04,665
<i>I'm 33 years old.
I sell peanuts.</i>

1071
01:17:06,802 --> 01:17:08,793
<i>I am peanuts.</i>

1072
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:15,769
You're such a guy.

1073
01:17:26,622 --> 01:17:27,611
Hey.

1074
01:17:29,592 --> 01:17:30,616
Fuck!

1075
01:17:35,231 --> 01:17:38,291
- I tried, babe.
- I know.

1076
01:17:40,803 --> 01:17:43,101
I'll get the next one, babe,
all the way.

1077
01:17:43,172 --> 01:17:46,505
- I know.
- I love you.

1078
01:17:46,575 --> 01:17:48,736
Love you too.

1079
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:23,542
- Hello.
- Doug. Mitch from Donaldson's.

1080
01:18:23,612 --> 01:18:25,603
- Hey.
- We've made our choice.

1081
01:18:25,681 --> 01:18:29,845
Between you and me, Richard
failed his drug test- spectacularly.

1082
01:18:29,919 --> 01:18:32,046
So it was you and Donnie Wahls
from Lakeview.

1083
01:18:32,121 --> 01:18:34,055
But he's pretty junior.

1084
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:37,217
So I'm calling to say
welcome aboard.

1085
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:43,295
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

1086
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:45,299
I just wanted to say welcome aboard.

1087
01:18:45,367 --> 01:18:48,530
Oh, hey. Welcome aboard
to you too, Mitch.

1088
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:52,040
- Yeah. Doug, we'll see you on the seventh at 8:00 a. m.
- Okay, yeah.

1089
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:55,304
- Hey-Hey, Mitch. Thanks.
- See you, Doug.

1090
01:19:01,984 --> 01:19:05,147
<i>Standing downtown,
I thought of everything that happened.</i>

1091
01:19:05,221 --> 01:19:07,155
<i>Was I the better man?</i>

1092
01:19:07,223 --> 01:19:09,555
<i>I don't know.
I just know I started running.</i>

1093
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:11,559
<i>Maybe because
I got something I needed.</i>

1094
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:13,652
<i>And if I met Richard
in the street or somewhere...</i>

1095
01:19:13,729 --> 01:19:15,720
<i>I think I could still
shake his hand.</i>

1096
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:19,394
<i>So was I the better man?</i>

1097
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:21,459
<i>I don't know.
I just felt like a man.</i>

1098
01:19:26,008 --> 01:19:29,239
<i>Man, I hadn't felt that good
since I placed silver in Boys' Apparatus-</i>

1099
01:19:31,146 --> 01:19:32,738
<i>in the junior Olympics.</i>

1100
01:19:42,091 --> 01:19:44,025
Yeah!

1101
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:56,700
<i>I never saw Richard again, but I heard
he went back to Canada with his family...</i>

1102
01:19:56,772 --> 01:19:58,535
<i>back to his old grocery.</i>

1103
01:19:58,607 --> 01:20:02,043
<i>I also heard he put out a storage room fire
with his bare hands or something...</i>

1104
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:04,204
<i>and got promoted to manager.</i>

1105
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:08,307
<i>There are rumors he started the fire himself
for self-promotion purposes.</i>

1106
01:20:08,384 --> 01:20:11,512
<i>But either way,
he's a higher-up now.</i>

1107
01:20:11,587 --> 01:20:14,750
<i>And that's cool, because he can
get a place for his wife and girl.</i>

1108
01:20:14,823 --> 01:20:17,917
<i>He can save a little something
off to the side for himself too.</i>

1109
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:19,984
<i>I don't know, maybe a new chopper.</i>

1110
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:36,174
<i>#Put your face where we can see it #</i>

1111
01:20:37,947 --> 01:20:41,940
<i>#Put it on a show on cable #</i>

1112
01:20:43,585 --> 01:20:47,180
<i># You can really show it all there #</i>

1113
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:53,254
<i># Turn it on when you are able #</i>

1114
01:20:53,329 --> 01:20:56,025
<i># Turn it on #</i>

01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:01,631
