A bullet's kiss is a cold
way to meet betrayal.



Some things never change in this city.



Blackouts. Lights out.
Everything stops.



Like this gig I had
at this spot called the Tower.



Lot of cats were involved
in the ups and downs.



Hey, man, some were righteous,
some were straight-up crooks,



the rest were just dreamers who were
dancing around in their own world.



That was Chaz Davenport.



Wide-eyed rich kid who ate cereal
from a silver spoon.



I ain't saying that's a bad thing, see,
'cause he could have did the family route.



Had the power, prestige,
been an instant wheel in the big city,



but, like I said, Chaz was a dreamer.



I guess his dream was to find
life on his own.



He opened up the Tower, this paradise
for wolves who led lambs to the slaughter.



See, Chaz was cursed
and blessed with a big heart.



Big hearts break hard downtown fast.



Welcome to the blues.



<i>I had a dream last night</i>



<i>There were no shadows, no sign of light</i>



<i>My heart, it was aching</i>



<i>I was lost and alone</i>



<i>Blind to the rain</i>



<i>I was soaked to the bone</i>



<i>The broken sidewalk, forever I roam</i>



<i>'Cause now these dark, dark streets</i>



<i>Are my home</i>



<i>I ask God for nothing</i>
<i>and I got it in spades</i>



<i>Moments of pleasure</i>
<i>how memories fade</i>



<i>I have no pride, I have no shame</i>



<i>I cut the deal and I take the blame</i>



<i>Nightmares that haunt me</i>
<i>the night winds that roam</i>



<i>Now these dark, dark, dark streets</i>



<i>They're my home</i>



<i>See, this all went down a long time ago</i>
<i>on Gotham's dark streets.</i>



<i>That unreal world in the back of your mind.</i>



Darkness has no face.



Day and night embrace.



Come with me to this place
where shadows dance,



and romance is an eager breath away.



Good evening and welcome
to the grand opening of the Tower!



I am Prince Royale.



Now let's make it warm
for Miss Crystal LaBelle.



<i>If you're feeling lonely</i>
<i>when the blue hour comes around</i>



<i>Come in from the street now</i>
<i>Lay your troubles down</i>



<i>Step in through my doorway</i>
<i>Come in from the rain</i>



<i>'Cause when I hold you in my arms</i>
<i>all your heartaches fade</i>



<i>Twilight calls, nothing's what it seems</i>



<i>Twilight calls, you can live your dreams</i>



<i>Twilight calls, you come to me</i>



<i>Twilight calls, nothing's what it seems</i>



<i>Twilight calls, you can live your dreams</i>



<i>Twilight calls, nothing's what it seems</i>



<i>Twilight calls, when you come to me</i>



<i>When twilight calls, you come to me</i>



<i>Come to me</i>



<i>Yeah, you come to me</i>



Congratulations, Mr. Davenport.



Ladies, you were incredible.



Best champagne all around.



Good night.



- Ain't he the dreamiest?
- Come back to earth.



A Davenport ain't havin'
nothin' real to do with you.



Or you either.



Get a load of Lady Rockefeller.



You think 'cause you knew him way back,
he thinks you're any different than us?



You don't know nothin'.



Sometimes things ain't always
like they seem.



<i>Somewhere along the way, Chaz's dad</i>
<i>took the deep six on his own bullet.</i>



<i>Left Chaz holding a bag of bills.</i>



<i>And to find out</i>
<i>that he was nixed out of the will</i>



<i>was like a kick in the face</i>
<i>when he was down.</i>



<i>Why, oh, why</i>



<i>Why do you treat me like you do?</i>



<i>I wanna know, babe</i>



<i>I said why, oh, why</i>



<i>Why do you treat me like you do?</i>



<i>I said, you know, you know, baby</i>



<i>That you treated me wrong for</i>



<i>For such a long, long time</i>



<i>You're gonna look around for me</i>



<i>I said I'll be gone</i>



Let's have a drink. Just the two of us.



<i>Yeah, one of</i>



<i>One of these sunny days</i>



<i>You'll look around for me, yeah</i>
<i>and I'll be gone</i>



<i>Yes, I will</i>



<i>You treated me, you treated me wrong</i>



<i>You treated me wrong far too long</i>



Yeah, the blues, man.
Once it's in you, it's got you.



It had Chaz bad, so bad
he wanted to bottle it, package it



and take it on uptown to his rich friends.



But this city's cold-blooded.



Just grabs hope by the throat
and it don't let go.



Come in.



Okay, 60 pounds of ice,
12 cases of ginger ale,



12 jars maraschino cherries.



- You wanna roll for it?
- No, sir.



- Just put it on my account, will you?
- They told me I gotta collect.



<i>Now that's what I do</i>



<i>I'm taking it slow</i>



<i>Just living on the layaway plan</i>



This came in the mail. Sure is heavy.



<i>I'm telling you how</i>



<i>You might miss your chance</i>
<i>if you don't take it now</i>



<i>You can have it today</i>
<i>and you don't have to pay</i>



<i>You can afford it on the layaway plan</i>



<i>That's what I do</i>



<i>I'm taking it slow</i>



Hey, isn't that from your father?



<i>Business after pleasure</i>



<i>Just living on the layaway plan</i>



Yes, it is from my father.



Who the hell is Gloria Martin?



See you later.



The Wonder Wheel.



Delores? Chaz. I'm fine, fine. Is my uncle in?



Hey, say, Delores,
did you ever hear of a Gloria Martin?



No? All right. Well, tell him I called. Thanks.



Hey, sweetie, here's a little something
to cheer you up.



You know I always share.



You're all cleaned up now, huh?
Chaz straightened you out, didn't he?



You see, Crystal used to know him back
when he went to that fancy college.



He used to let her in through the window.



We're on in 30, girls. Don't miss your cues.



Well, more for us.



Mr. Davenport.



Thanks for the job.



I won't forget.



That's all right, Tommy,
just hand 'em the towels.



<i>Everything was popping.</i>



<i>More nights like this,</i>
<i>and the sharks would be paid in full.</i>



Again?



<i>With darkness comes nightmares</i>
<i>that pull you face to face</i>



<i>with the Angel of Death.</i>



Nice club.



Be nicer with electricity.



You can do a lot with a place like this.



That was the idea, Lieutenant.



Maybe you can arrest me some customers.



That would be illegal.



Can I do something for you?



Hope you're not afraid of the dark.



I'm only afraid of losing my shirt.



Good night, Mr. Davenport.



Night, Rose.



Maybe you shouldn't take
your shirt off so much.



They always say
women look better in candlelight.



I don't know. What do you think, mister?



I got a friend who sings.



Okay. All right, listen, Lieutenant,
you know what I need?



I need enough juice to keep this place lit up.



Singers I got.



Yeah, I'll bring her around.



<i>In this dirty town</i>



<i>You know your life ain't worth a damn</i>



<i>You can lose it in a second</i>



<i>When you tangle with the man</i>



<i>'Cause they'll take you out</i>



<i>And they'll carry you on down</i>



<i>Only the gutter for your burying ground</i>



Boss.



Boss!



Hey, you might wanna lay off
that hooch, man.



- What can I do for you?
- Power's back on.



Yeah, there's someone here to see you.



- Who?
- Not a who, it's more like a what.



Please. Sit down.



- I brought you a warning.
- Did you?



- 'Cause I didn't receive it...
- Shut up!



A warning, I came to talk with you.



This ain't no joke, playboy. Pay up!



I'll be back, and the next time
I won't be so sweet.



Chaz?



Chaz?



You sing beautiful, miss.



- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.



What was that all about?



Just... Nothing.



<i>Consolidated Power.</i>



<i>I remember Chaz telling me</i>
<i>about being a kid,</i>



<i>playing in those long marble hallways</i>
<i>with his folks before his old lady died.</i>



<i>One day, you're king of the throne,</i>
<i>next day, you're begging for a loan.</i>



<i>Governor Shipman, what exactly</i>
<i>is being done about the blackouts?</i>



<i>Every assemblyman in the state</i>
<i>is losing sleep over this.</i>



- Good afternoon, Mr. Davenport.
- Afternoon, Mike.



We were all shocked about your father.



So was I.



<i>When love wants to leave</i>



<i>Well, it's up and out that door</i>



<i>You can make a sinner believe</i>



<i>Love can make a rich man so poor</i>



<i>Love knows no rules</i>



<i>What's right and what is wrong</i>



<i>Even though you've never known it</i>



<i>You can miss it when it's gone</i>



<i>You can lose somebody</i>



<i>You've barely known</i>



Chaz!



I thought I heard someone.



Delores. The true love of my life.



Your uncle was just talking about you
before he went out of town.



- He's meeting with the governor.
- When will he be back, D?



It's hard to tell, you know,
with this power crisis. Isn't it awful?



You know, your uncle is working himself
to the bone.



- Do you need him?
- Just wanted to say hello.



- And invite him to my club.
- Yes, your new nightclub.



That must be very exciting for you.



I forgot about Frank.



My father's best friends were always the men
who got their hands dirty at the plant.



Your father was the salt of the earth.



So, I tried to stop in to see Leonard,
but his door was locked.



Leonard died.



He died?



Car accident.
Right after your father's funeral.



They hired a new company attorney,
but nothing like Leonard, though.



You know, thirty-five years.



Yes?



That switchboard can track me down
in the ladies' room.



I'll tell your uncle to call you.



Yes, he's just leaving.



Yes.



He didn't know.



<i>Like I always said, you wanna dance</i>
<i>with the devil, you gotta ride on the horn.</i>



Well, if it ain't Sleeping Beauty.



I guess I missed last call.
You got the dough?



I got. Oh...



What do you mean, "Oh"? You got it or not?



No. I got it, I got it. I can get it, okay?



Got is now. Get is in the future!



It ain't polite to point them things at people.



Guess it's good I came by.



Grab his arm.



Maybe you need some protection
from this sort of thing.



Five, six, seven and...



<i>Send me your kiss</i>



<i>'Cause only you know</i>
<i>how to thrill me like this</i>



<i>There's not another</i>
<i>who could give me such bliss when we kiss</i>



<i>So, baby, drive me crazy</i>



<i>Send me your charms</i>



<i>'Cause all I want</i>
<i>is just to be in your arms</i>



<i>And all your loving is what I'm dreaming of</i>
<i>heaven above</i>



<i>So, baby, send me your love</i>



I guess I should thank you.



Not necessary.



There's only one problem.



Now that you killed King Kong,



his employer is probably gonna be
a little bit annoyed.



I'm guessing you owe some money.



You're obviously clairvoyant.



No, Methodist.



I got some juice in this town.
I'll make some calls.



See if I can't buy you a little bit more time.



Yeah, but when he finds out
his ape is dead...



Maybe I say you paid him



and he decided to take
a little Mexican vacation with the dough.



You see?



<i>Baby, send me your kiss</i>



<i>'Cause only you know</i>
<i>how to thrill me like this</i>



This is Madelaine.



<i>There's not another</i>
<i>who could give me such bliss</i>



She's gonna be auditioning for you.



<i>So, baby</i>



<i>Come on and send me your kiss</i>



<i>Send me your kiss</i>



Hello, Mr. Davenport.



And I can sing, too.



So how do you know the Lieutenant?



He's an old friend.



You have interesting friends.



If this isn't a good time, we can certainly...



Time...



Actually, it's a perfect time.



<i>I'm a lady far from home</i>



<i>Just a stranger wherever I roam</i>



<i>There ain't nowhere I've ever known</i>



<i>That's a place I can call my own</i>



<i>If you need sweet company</i>



<i>Come and spend some time with me</i>



<i>In the morning when you're gone</i>



<i>I want a place I can call my own</i>



Thank you.



- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yes.



We don't need another singer.



- Wasn't she great?
- What about my numbers?



Well, you're a great belter,
but we've got a real chanteuse now.



She can chanteuse my ass.



<i>Well, I know a lot of women</i>
<i>with a crazy plan</i>



<i>Don't mind me at all</i>
<i>being the backdoor man</i>



<i>Don't get what I want, but I get what I can</i>



<i>Loving on the layaway plan</i>



You might be a high roller, furs and rings.



But when it comes up snake eyes,
it don't mean a thing.



Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Madelaine Bondurant.



<i>No one wins the game of life</i>



<i>No matter how they try</i>



<i>We're all dreamers in the night</i>
<i>as the world is passing by</i>



<i>True love's never true</i>



<i>Love is just a lie</i>



<i>Seems to me they're nothing more</i>
<i>than one long goodbye</i>



<i>Every dream has an end</i>
<i>when morning has to start</i>



<i>And there ain't no way to mend</i>
<i>a lonely broken heart</i>



<i>'Cause true love's never true</i>



<i>Love is just a lie</i>



<i>Seems to me there's nothing more</i>
<i>than one long, sad goodbye</i>



Tell me. Where are you at home?



Here.



No white picket fence?



No dogs in the yard?



This is what I want.



Listen, Chaz, I'm a singer and I'm good.



I plan on being much more
than just another nightclub act



and I'm not going to be part
of your little stable.



No, of course not.



They're all out to pasture now.
You're the one I'm betting on.



You really shouldn't gamble, Chaz.



I have to go. I have to rehearse.



Hey, man, someone said
you left this at the bar.



Yeah, I thought it might be good luck.



The band wants to know
when they're getting paid.



- They'll get paid.
- Yeah?



- Yeah.
- Cool.



<i>" Gloria, darling,</i>
<i>if you receive this, then I am dead.</i>



<i>" They think you know something</i>
<i>and they'll come after you, too.</i>



<i>" Take the money and go somewhere safe.</i>



<i>"Love, Arthur."</i>



Your father, what are you talking about?



I'm gonna find out who killed him.



You've been drinkin' like a fish
and now you're talkin' stupid. Stop it.



<i>Hope on a book of matches.</i>



<i>Hey, some hope beats no hope at all. Right?</i>



Thanks for squeezing in a dance
with the boss.



Well, you have to promise
not to step on my toes next time.



Hey, Davenport, who's the doll?



The doll is Miss Bondurant to you, Harry.



How do you do, Miss Bondurant?



Better be careful, honey,
the camera don't lie. Only people do.



Hello, Crystal.



How'd you like a page 6 spread
in the Friday edition?



What, did you run out of dead bodies
to snap?



Just hard to find good stories in the dark.



Listen. Just arrange a little date
with the cutie over there.



Rosie?



Maybe a half hour, somewhere discreet.



Get out of my club.



You know, I didn't think we should run
your father's dead mug on the front page,



but my editor insisted on it.



Out.



Speakin' of these blackouts, Davenport,



isn't keepin' the lights on
your family business?



Scumbag.



I can't believe we're taking 23 and 24
off the grid. I mean, that ain't right.



- Excuse me.
- This station is closed to the public.



Well, you must be new here.
I'm Charles Davenport.



I'm afraid you're gonna have to leave.
Safety regulations.



No, no. I'm just looking for somebody
who works here. Frank Levitt?



- You say Frank Levitt?
- You know him?



Yeah, he packed his lunchbox up about
a month ago. I ain't seen him since.



- Do you know where he went?
- No.



This is private property. You're trespassing.



- All right, I'm gone, all right?
- Good.



Wouldn't want you to get electrocuted
or something.



Chaz, how does this look?
We're down a girl.



- What happened to Darlene?
- She still hasn't shown up.



- Maybe she overslept.
- Yeah, well, she's sleepin' now.



Yeah, eternally.



What?



Christ.



- Where have you been?
- I was out.



You might wanna try being in
once in a while.



Especially when there's a rehearsal.



Hello?



Wait, Gloria?



Yeah. No, I've been trying to reach you.



All right. Okay.



I'll be there.



Oh, my, another dame?



Hey.



- See you soon.
- Sure.



Excuse me. I'm looking for a Gloria Martin?



Right behind you. She fell down the stairs.



Gloria? It's Charles. Charles Davenport?
Can you hear me?



Gloria?



They murdered your father.



They're going to try to kill you.



Who killed my father? Who killed my father?



- Hey, mister, that's enough.
- The governor.



- What about the governor?
- Your father loved you.



He loved you so much.



<i>In this dirty, old town</i>



<i>You know your life ain't worth a damn</i>



<i>You can lose it in a second</i>



<i>If you tangle with the man</i>



<i>'Cause they'll take you out</i>



<i>And they'll carry you on down</i>



<i>Only the gutter for your burying ground</i>



<i>And if you are rich or poor</i>



<i>Sure it don't make no never mind</i>



Gloria Martin?



Yes, yes, friend of the family.



When did she die?



No. Thanks.



So what do you want to talk about?



I was thinking about
what you said to me before.



About needing protection.



What do you need protecting from?



I don't know.



I know this is going to sound crazy.



- But... There's a woman...
- Seems there always is with you.



No. No, no.



This is different.



She's dead.



She fell down some stairs,
but I know she was pushed.



She said the governor is involved.



You think the governor pushed her?



Just... He had something to do with it,



and I think they're trying to kill me, too.



Why?



I don't know.



All right. Don't tell me.



We all have our little secrets.



I'll keep my eyes open around here.



You can owe me
when you get your big payday.



<i>As I've said repeatedly,</i>
<i>we are doing everything in our power</i>



<i>to end these blackouts, folks.</i>



<i>We cannot let private power companies</i>
<i>take control of our state.</i>



- Governor. Governor.
- What's the real deal, Governor?



- Governor.
- Come on, guys, I've a flight to catch.



- Governor, I'm Charles Davenport.
- Davenport?



- Sir, sir. One more question...
- Let him through. Let him through.



- I need to talk to you.
- The answer is still no.



You Davenports can go to hell.



- Governor Shipman!
- Sir! Sir!



I'll see what I can do.



See anything you like?



What do you mean?



I needed to use the phone
and I forgot something.



Like that mask you wear
whenever he's around?



Chaz gave it to me.



I didn't want it to die.



I always thought red was for love.



And white was for funerals.



Welcome, sir.



Charles?



Uncle Nate.



- You cut quite the figure.
- Well, I take after my favorite uncle.



Delores said you've been trying to reach me.
Is anything wrong?



I wanted to talk to you about my father.



I know I haven't really been there
for you, Charles, I'm... I'm sorry.



Being busy is no excuse.



Uncle Nate, did...



Did my father work closely
with the governor?



Well, yes. He did. Why?



Would the governor have any reason
to want my father out of the way?



There's been a lot of tension
between the company and the state



during the power crisis.



For goodness' sake, Charles...



I know, I know! It sounds crazy. It's just...



I have a letter from my father.



- A letter?
- Wait, I'm gonna get it.



Keep your ears open. Or he's a dead man.



<i>- Knocking at my door</i>
<i>- Knocking at my door</i>



- Don't worry, Charles, I'll look into it.
- Thanks.



<i>Looked out my window</i>
<i>early one foggy night</i>



<i>Well, I saw a stranger in the pale moonlight</i>



<i>Crawled back in my bed</i>
<i>when I heard the sound</i>



<i>See my blood started racing</i>
<i>and my heart began to pound</i>



<i>And I said you must be the devil</i>



<i>- You must be the devil</i>
<i>- You must be the devil</i>



<i>Hey, hey, this must be the devil</i>



<i>- This must be the devil</i>
<i>- This must be the devil</i>



<i>Hey, hey</i>



<i>Heaven can't help me no more</i>



<i>I was hiding in the dark</i>
<i>when I heard him laugh</i>



<i>He said, " Boy, where I come from</i>
<i>See, we don't forget the past"</i>



<i>He said, " The gates of hell are open now</i>



<i>" I'm on the loose</i>
<i>You gotta be careful what you say, boy</i>



<i>"'Cause I got a real short fuse"</i>



<i>And I said, "You must be the devil"</i>



<i>- You must be the devil</i>
<i>- You must be the devil</i>



<i>Hey, hey, you must be the devil</i>



<i>- You must be the devil</i>
<i>- You must be the devil</i>



<i>Hey, hey</i>



<i>Don't you understand?</i>
<i>I said he's the devil</i>



<i>I made a deal with the devil</i>



<i>And heaven can't help me no more</i>



<i>I made a deal with the devil</i>
<i>don't you understand?</i>



<i>I made a deal with the devil</i>
<i>I just don't understand</i>



<i>I never should have tried</i>
<i>to take the shortcut</i>



<i>'Cause now</i>



<i>Old devil at the door</i>



<i>Yeah, see when Tommy got his throat slit,</i>



<i>bottom dropped out of whatever</i>
<i>false bravado we all had going on.</i>



<i>And I still sleep with one eye open.</i>



<i>Chill of the night</i>



<i>And it's dark all around</i>



<i>Nothing seems right</i>
<i>and there's blood on the ground</i>



<i>You just don't understand</i>



<i>'Bout the deal that's going down</i>



<i>And the devil plays his hand</i>



<i>Now there's blood on the ground</i>



Crystal? What are you doing out here?
It's dangerous.



I followed you.



I figured you'd be pretty down about Tommy.



I know I am.



Jesus.



My dad used to take me when I was a kid.



We'd go at sundown,



just when they were starting
to light the whole place up.



Yeah?



Something about places like that
when you're a kid.



Like magic, you know?



My father used to pay the guy to stop
at the top of the Ferris wheel.



You could see for miles from up there.
The city was lit up like stars.



- So many lights.
- Ain't many lights nowadays.



Even when we were in caves, we all used
to gather around the campfire.



Sure. You didn't wanna get eaten
by a lizard with big sharp teeth.



We ride those things just to test it all,
you know?



You want that feeling,
you want to be scared.



- You want to know what it feels like.
- Like what feels like?



Dying.



Hey, don't... Don't look at me like that.



Come on, let's go.



I could use a drink.



Me, too.



<i>When I come home</i>



<i>All you wanna do, all you wanna do</i>
<i>is fuss and fight, yeah</i>



<i>Baby, can't do that</i>



It's getting pretty late, huh?



<i>Yeah</i>



<i>I work hard all day</i>



It's not that late.



<i>... fuss and fight</i>



Crystal...



Come on, baby. Like it used to be.



<i>You know, baby, hey</i>
<i>it just ain't right</i>



What the hell's wrong with you?



It's her, isn't it?



You're very special to me, Crystal.



Yeah? But not special enough, huh?



- Special enough for good times.
- Stop it, Crystal.



- Special enough for promises, once.
- Stop it!



But not special enough to keep a doc
from shoving a coat hanger up me.



I know.



I know. I'm sorry.



I'm sorry, Crystal.



Please.



Please.



I'm sorry.



You're in love with that little bitch,
aren't you?



<i>You treated me wrong</i>



Don't think I'm jealous, 'cause I'm not.



That new little pony of yours,
she's the one riding you.



<i>He couldn't let it go.</i>



<i>Knowing his old man was murdered</i>



<i>kept him searching shadows</i>
<i>in every dark corner.</i>



I've been digging into this theory
of yours, Charles,



and I'm sorry, it doesn't add up.



I think we have to face facts.



Your father... There was a woman and she...



- Gloria Martin.
- Gloria Martin, yes.



They had been...



Well, he knew her for a long time,
and about a year ago, she broke it off.



Your father sank into a deep depression.



And with you also gone,
I think his mind just gave way,



just gave up.



You don't know what it was like
to see my brother just deteriorate like that.



What about the governor?



Although the governor and your father
didn't see eye to eye...



But murder, Charles... It's a bit extreme.



I mean, even for a politician.



See, I...



I always thought it came with the territory.



Charles, these things are hard for all of us.



I'm sure the last thing
your father would have wanted



was for you to waste your life over it.



Right.



Charles, I'm worried about you.



You don't look well.



I'm all right.



Why don't you go up
to your father's old cabin for a few days?



I forgot about that place.



There must be some beautiful girl
you can take along with you,



isn't there?



Get out of the city, away from the blackouts.



Listen.



Just forget about all of this for a while?



Okay.



Why don't you boys go play
some gin rummy?



I don't see your little friend here.



She's just your friend, right?



Save yourself.



Or don't.



We're on in 10.



<i>I've been waiting all night long</i>



<i>I never thought you would show</i>



<i>You're so nice, let's be nice some more</i>



<i>I can't love hoping</i>



<i>Hoping for your call</i>



<i>Hey, that would be nice</i>



<i>Let's be nice some more</i>



<i>People go out dancing</i>



<i>Dancing till dawn</i>



<i>Hey, don't that sound nice?</i>



<i>Let's be nice some more</i>



<i>I remember, darling</i>



<i>You were waiting at my door</i>



<i>We'd be out romancing</i>



<i>Never coming back till after 4:00</i>



<i>Maybe you hold me all night long</i>



<i>Hey, wasn't that nice?</i>



<i>Let's be nice some more</i>



<i>Yeah, baby</i>



<i>I remember, darling, you waiting at my door</i>



<i>We'd be out romancing</i>



<i>Never coming back till after 4:00</i>



<i>Now you got someone that...</i>



Smile, Guv.



- No!
- Hello, Governor.



Who the hell are you?



<i>Let's be nice some more</i>



<i>She must think it's nice</i>



<i>Let's be nice some more</i>



What's this?



My father gave this to me when I was seven.



Oh, I'm sorry.



Something else we used to do,
my father and me...



Bring the stars closer.



I just had an idea
for one of my numbers at the club.



Tell me about it.



You've heard the number before.



I suddenly came up
with a whole new arrangement.



<i>Now you've heard my sad refrain</i>



<i>Its melody so blue</i>



<i>When my song has run its course</i>



<i>The answer's up to you</i>



<i>'Cause true love's never true</i>



<i>Love is just a lie</i>



<i>A song that's never ever sung</i>



<i>Will slowly fade and die</i>



<i>Delilahs are and always will be</i>
<i>the root of every sap's demise.</i>



<i>Sooner or later, you gotta wake up.</i>



<i>And it ain't the dream</i>
<i>you're looking at anymore.</i>



<i>Chill of the night</i>
<i>and it's dark all around</i>



<i>Nothing seems right</i>
<i>and there's blood on the ground</i>



<i>You just don't understand</i>



<i>'Bout the deal that's going down</i>



<i>And the devil plays his hand</i>



<i>Now there's blood on the ground</i>



<i>You don't know what's going on</i>



- Frank...
- Chaz.



Is that you?
Frank. I've been looking for you all over.



What are you doing here?



- Your father got me the job.
- Yeah?



Said I knew too much.
People might be lookin' for me.



Wait, what people?



See, your uncle was closing plants down
for maintenance.



There was nothing wrong with them.



He just shut down parts of the grid,
and before you know it,



whole city's goin' dark.



My uncle



was deliberately causing the blackouts?



Consolidated wanted the power contract
for the whole state.



So your uncle played hardball.
"Guess what, Governor?



"We're not turnin' the juice back on
until we get that contract."



Your father was gonna blow the whistle.



But somehow, your uncle got
the governor to change his mind.



Now your uncle's got all the juice.



Hey, wait... You're... You're packing up?



I mean, the...
The carnival just got here, didn't it?



Always seems that way. Show's over, son.



All right, boys. Let's pull down her bones.



<i>'Cause you just don't understand</i>



<i>'Bout the deal that's going down</i>



<i>Now the devil plays his hand</i>



<i>Now there's blood on the ground</i>



Dad?



<i>What you thought was right was wrong</i>



<i>And you better not look down</i>



<i>At the blood on the ground</i>



<i>I used to be lucky</i>



<i>I used to be lucky, so they say</i>



<i>The sun shining down on me</i>



<i>I used to be lucky, so they say</i>



<i>I was as happy as a baby boy could be</i>



<i>But you know as time goes passing by</i>
<i>you know that I



<i>All I do is sit alone and cry</i>



<i>Now don't you worry about me, girl</i>



Chaz?



<i>I just don't care anymore</i>



Get the hell out of here!



See you later, sweetie.



<i>Now don't you worry about me, baby</i>



Great club.



By the way, notice how the governor
turned around on that energy thing?



Quite the smooth move on your uncle's part,
wouldn't you say, Davenport?



Why don't you just go?



Some people really know how to take
the power into their own hands.



Rosie.



Crystal.



- What are you doing?
- Hi, Chaz.



You're back on that junk? Crystal?



Come on, baby.



- What the hell is going on here, huh?
- Why are you talking to me?



That's how you like it.
You like it rough, huh?



Well, that's how it is with a girl like me.



Where's Madelaine?



I told you she was a little snake.



God. Crystal. For God's sake.



I could tell you something you wanna know,



but you just gotta say it one more time.



You don't gotta mean it,
just say the words one time.



What are you doing?



You should have stayed by the campfire.



We all should've stayed by the campfire.



What happened to Mack?



I don't know Mack.



Let him go.



<i>In this dirty town</i>



Pour Mr. Davenport a whiskey.



<i>You know your life ain't worth a damn</i>



What the hell is going on around here?



I knew this place had potential
the minute I laid eyes on it.



So did Madelaine.



She always had a good head
on her shoulders.



<i>'Cause they'll take you out</i>



Where is she?



<i>And they'll carry you down</i>



You know women.



You don't want them,
you gotta swat them like flies.



<i>... for your burying ground</i>



When you do...



<i>If you're rich or poor</i>



<i>Sure it don't make no never mind</i>



<i>Maybe I'll rob the liquor store</i>



<i>Drink every single bottle dry</i>



Madelaine!



Madelaine!



<i>Shoot the cop on the corner</i>



Madelaine!



<i>No one wins the game of life</i>



<i>No matter how they try</i>



<i>We're all dreamers in the night</i>



<i>As the world is passing by</i>



<i>True love's never true</i>



<i>Love is just a lie</i>



<i>Seems to me there's nothing more</i>



Hello?



<i>... than one long goodbye</i>



Hello?



<i>I heard you've been, well,</i>
<i>digging into things, Charles.</i>



How do you know where I am?



You're my only nephew, Charles.
I tried to protect you.



You killed my father.



I certainly never counted on you
to start digging around.



That was very foolish of you, Charles.



You see, you weren't disinherited,



though you deserved to be,
which you knew as well as I.



My brother, that idiot,
he willed 50% of Consolidated to you.



I destroyed the original will.



I knew he'd hidden a copy.
Someplace where only you would find it.



Your father knew I wouldn't think
of looking at the heavens.



Only you would look for pie in the sky.



The meek do not inherit the earth, Charles.
They get eaten.



Welcome back, sir.



Maddy.



<i>I had a dream last night</i>



<i>There were no shadows, no sign of light</i>



<i>I was lost in a world, no sense of time</i>



<i>I cried to the dark, I committed no crime</i>



<i>This broken sidewalk, forever I roam</i>



<i>And now these dark, dark streets</i>



<i>Are my home</i>



So now you're going to kill yourself.



<i>I ask God for nothing</i>
<i>and got it in spades</i>



Guess it runs in the family.



<i>How memories fade</i>



<i>I have my pride, I know the game</i>



<i>I cut the deal, so there's no one to blame</i>



<i>The nightmares that haunt me</i>
<i>the night winds that moan</i>



<i>'Cause now these dark, dark streets</i>



<i>Are my home</i>



<i>The meek don't inherit the earth.</i>



They just end up in it.



See, the Angel of Death collected a soul,



and wasn't nothing left but the blues.



<i>Round about 6:00</i>



<i>Looking your best</i>



<i>Got a shine on your shoes</i>



<i>And a watch in your vest</i>



<i>Come crawling home, baby</i>



<i>Looking like a dog in the rain</i>



<i>Had too much juice</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking again</i>



<i>Round about dawn</i>



<i>You hop in my bed</i>



<i>I need to have some fun</i>



<i>But it's like waking the dead</i>



<i>You're no good to me, baby</i>



<i>'Cause my daddy's been drinking again</i>



<i>Yeah, that's too, too much juice</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking again</i>



<i>Yeah</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking</i>



<i>Round about noon</i>



<i>You got bed in your head</i>



<i>Why am I so blue, I ask</i>



<i>I'm so mad</i>



<i>It's downhill, baby</i>



<i>Like a runaway train</i>



<i>You had too much juice</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking again</i>



<i>Round about noon</i>



<i>You got bed in your head</i>



<i>Why am I so blue, I ask</i>



<i>I'm so mad</i>



<i>It's downhill, baby</i>



<i>Like a runaway train</i>



<i>You had too much of that juice</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking again</i>



<i>You had too much juice</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking again</i>



<i>You had too much juice</i>



<i>Looks like Daddy's been drinking again</i>



<i>You had too much juice</i>



<i>Too much juice</i>



<i>Daddy's been drinking</i>



<i>Drinking</i>



<i>Again</i>



<i>Yes, sir</i>
