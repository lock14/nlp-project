1
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:22,881
<i>Far, far away</i>

2
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,126
<i>Where saints in glory stand</i>

3
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:29,503
<i>Bright, bright as day</i>

4
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:32,962
<i>Oh, how they sweetly sing</i>

5
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:36,485
<i>Worthy is our Saviour King</i>

6
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:39,915
<i>Loud let His praises ring</i>

7
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:43,777
<i>Praise, praise for aye</i>

8
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>Come to that happy land</i>

9
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,540
<i>Come, come away</i>

10
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,245
<i>Why will you doubting stand?</i>

11
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:04,840
<i>Why still delay?</i>

12
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,092
<i>Oh, we shall happy be</i>

13
00:02:08,193 --> 00:02:11,757
<i>When from sin and sorrow free</i>

14
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:15,384
<i>Lord, we shall live with Thee</i>

15
00:02:15,485 --> 00:02:19,187
<i>Blest, blest for aye</i>

16
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:29,900
<i>Bright, in that happy land</i>

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,367
<i>Beams every eye</i>

18
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:37,031
<i>Kept by a Father's hand</i>

19
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:40,667
<i>Love cannot die</i>

20
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:44,086
<i>Oh, then to glory run</i>

21
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:47,854
<i>Be a crown and kingdom won</i>

22
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:51,587
<i>And, bright, above the sun</i>

23
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:55,848
<i>We reign for aye.</i>

24
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,818
Where's my gun? Fuckin' hell.

25
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,907
Fuck. Fuckin' bastards. Fuckin'...

26
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:17,842
Come on, you fuck...

27
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:20,033
Mikey, get down. Christ!

28
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,957
Mikey!
Arggh!

29
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:30,383
I'm hit, Charlie. I'm hit.

30
00:03:30,484 --> 00:03:32,468
You'll be alright, Mikey. Hold strong.

31
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:41,895
You'll never take me alive,
you bastards.

32
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:20,238
Do I need to introduce myself?

33
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:22,637
I know who you are.

34
00:04:22,737 --> 00:04:24,937
Good.

35
00:04:25,038 --> 00:04:27,774
I know who you are.

36
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:33,148
My brother's taken a bullet, Stanley,
and is in need of medical attention.

37
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:36,992
Well, allow me to address
the subject of your brother, Mr Burns.

38
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:43,624
Christmas, as you're probably aware,
is fast approaching.

39
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:47,370
And Christmas this year
will hold a unique significance

40
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:49,747
for young Micky here.

41
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,048
Mikey.

42
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,384
Because on Christmas Day,

43
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:59,048
I have made plans
that he be taken from the jail in Banyon

44
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:01,050
and hanged by the neck until he is dead.

45
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:02,850
Charlie.

46
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:06,139
You're a copper, Stanley,
not a judge and jury.

47
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:09,858
Well, clearly, Mr Burns,
I am what I wish to be.

48
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,689
So what is it that you want?

49
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,697
I want Arthur Burns.

50
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,701
I no longer ride with my brother.

51
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:32,963
Now, I will allow you
a moment to think about it.

52
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:54,269
What's happening, Charlie?

53
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,321
It's alright, Mikey.

54
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,490
It's alright.

55
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,711
Australia.

56
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:16,298
What fresh hell is this?

57
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:22,096
I have kept company
with bad men all my life.

58
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:26,720
I was 22 years
in Her Majesty's land forces.

59
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,738
I've dealt with your type many times.

60
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:31,189
Touch my brother again and I'll kill you.

61
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:42,158
Make no mistakes, Mr Burns.

62
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,757
It will be done. I will civilise this place.

63
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:47,788
What the fuck
are you talking about, Stanley?

64
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,435
Listen to me now, Charlie.

65
00:06:54,534 --> 00:06:56,005
Don't speak.

66
00:06:56,105 --> 00:06:58,634
Hush, Mikey. You'll be fine.

67
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,220
Hush.

68
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:12,855
I wish to present you with a proposition.

69
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:20,071
I know where Arthur Burns is.

70
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:24,283
It is a godforsaken place.

71
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:32,076
The blacks won't go there,
nor the trackers.

72
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:34,420
Not even my own men.

73
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,175
I suppose, in time,
the bounty hunters will get him.

74
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:46,319
But I have other plans.

75
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,427
I aim to bring him down.

76
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:49,935
I aim to show

77
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,055
that he is a man like any other.

78
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:53,939
I aim to hurt him.

79
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:56,983
When you're ready, sir.

80
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,322
And what will most hurt him?

81
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,079
Well, I've thought
long and hard about that.

82
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,124
And I have realised, Mr Burns,

83
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:17,629
that I must become
a little more inventive in my methods.

84
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:25,713
Now, don't speak, Mr Burns.
Listen to me now.

85
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:28,180
Don't say a word.

86
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:32,977
Now, suppose I told you there was a way

87
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:36,940
to save your little brother
Mikey from the noose.

88
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:41,277
Suppose I gave you a horse... and a gun.

89
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,658
Suppose, Mr Burns,

90
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:49,946
I was to give both you
and your young brother, Mikey, here,

91
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,413
a pardon.

92
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:57,975
Suppose I said that I could give you

93
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:01,005
the chance to expunge the guilt...

94
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:04,134
beneath which you so clearly labour.

95
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,471
Suppose I gave you till Christmas.

96
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:13,135
Now, suppose you tell me
what it is I want from you.

97
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,855
You want me to kill my brother.

98
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,816
I want you to kill your brother.

99
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,025
Arthur Burns is a monster.

100
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,495
An abomination.

101
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:35,665
<i>La, la, la.</i>

102
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:40,038
You were right
to part company with him

103
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:42,505
and to take Mikey with you.

104
00:09:43,398 --> 00:09:47,128
What happened at the Hopkins place
was unforgivable.

105
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:50,221
<i>La, la, la.</i>

106
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:53,349
I have never seen
such a sickening sight.

107
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,721
Did you know that
that poor woman, Eliza Hopkins,

108
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,187
had a child in her belly?

109
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:57,948
Your business
with your brother is unfinished.

110
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,500
You have nine days, Mr Burns.

111
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,386
Bring the horses round.

112
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:17,017
- Coming now.
- Come on. Get that on now.

113
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:45,768
It's the fucking Burns boy.

114
00:11:45,868 --> 00:11:48,088
Come on. Let's hit 'em.

115
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:50,841
Got 'em.

116
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:55,096
I fucking got him!

117
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:07,775
Pigs.

118
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,153
Who have you got?

119
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:16,868
Troopers... dismount!

120
00:12:21,722 --> 00:12:24,411
The man I have brought in...

121
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,409
is Mike Burns...

122
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:28,838
of the Burns gang.

123
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:38,056
That's one down and two to go,
gentlemen.

124
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:42,513
You've got to
get the other ones now.

125
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:46,230
I will... civilise this land.

126
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,943
Make yourself at home, Mikey.

127
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,066
Good evening to you, Mrs Stanley.

128
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:37,990
Good evening, Mr Broussard.

129
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:52,379
He's not so fuckin'
dangerous now, is he?

130
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:10,981
Martha?

131
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,522
Good evening, gentlemen.

132
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,363
Evening, Mrs Stanley.

133
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:19,825
You should... really not come here.

134
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:24,455
Cannot a lady visit her husband
in his place of work?

135
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,802
You men...

136
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:40,761
you wait outside.

137
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:51,432
We spoke about
why you shouldn't come here.

138
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,941
This is not appropriate...

139
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,568
Morris, you've been gone for three days.

140
00:14:57,754 --> 00:15:00,448
It's lonely up there at the house.

141
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,256
It's so quiet without you.

142
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:05,120
Are you coming home now?

143
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,123
Well, I have things to attend to.

144
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:12,663
I'll have Officer Dunn escort you home.

145
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,462
I'll be back soon.

146
00:15:14,562 --> 00:15:16,500
You look terrible, Morris.

147
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,424
Yes.

148
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:23,388
Yes, I do.

149
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:28,726
Dunn.

150
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,895
Who is that?

151
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:34,106
But he's no more than a boy.

152
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,062
He's man enough, ma'am.
He's man enough, indeed.

153
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:39,446
Enough.

154
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:49,575
Escort Mrs Stanley home
and wait there till I return.

155
00:15:49,674 --> 00:15:51,493
How long will you be, dear?

156
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:53,418
Later.

157
00:16:03,611 --> 00:16:05,631
Never speak to my wife
about such things again.

158
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,474
Do you understand?
My apologies, Captain.

159
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:11,053
What happened today on the flats,
that's between you and me.

160
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:12,854
Of course, sir.

161
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:15,558
Because there would be consequences
were it to become common knowledge.

162
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:18,150
Yes.

163
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:15,993
Eliza Hopkins
was a good Christian woman,

164
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:17,836
and she was my friend.

165
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:21,416
I pray to God that her death
was mercifully swift.

166
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:23,634
It was, wasn't it?

167
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:28,262
Martha, can we speak of other things?

168
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:31,974
Come here, Captain Stanley.

169
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:57,417
My poor husband.

170
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:19,440
The world you live in in there.

171
00:18:25,377 --> 00:18:27,823
Don't be gloomy, dear.

172
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:32,868
This burden you carry...

173
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,873
you might let me carry it too.

174
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,961
I believe in you.

175
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:02,523
Stay down. Stay in bed.

176
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,787
What in God's name...?

177
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:23,753
Christ, sir...

178
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:26,088
I've shot my bloody toes off.

179
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:35,174
There's nothing to see here, Martha.
Go back to bed.

180
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,349
Officer Dunn has shot his t...

181
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,563
Martha, go back inside.

182
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:59,748
<i>"When?" said the moon
to the stars in the sky</i>

183
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:04,627
<i>"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home</i>

184
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:10,884
<i>"Who?" said the cloud
that started to cry</i>

185
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:16,847
<i>"Me," said the rider, as dry as a bone</i>

186
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,980
<i>"How?" said the sun
that melted the ground</i>

187
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:29,333
<i>"Why?" said the river
that refused to run</i>

188
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:34,324
<i>"Where?" said the thunder
without a sound</i>

189
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:40,797
<i>"Here," said the rider,
and took up his gun.</i>

190
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:51,132
Bloody flies.

191
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,463
Kill one and a dozen more
turn up to his funeral.

192
00:20:57,363 --> 00:21:00,099
<i>Oh, Danny Boy</i>

193
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,480
<i>The flies, the flies are crawl...</i>

194
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,625
Oh, a thousand pardons, my dear man.

195
00:21:11,726 --> 00:21:15,240
It appears that I am a little scuppered.

196
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:19,695
Oh, no need for that, sir.
No need for that.

197
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:22,288
We are white men, you and I.

198
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:25,993
Permit me to introduce myself.

199
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:28,961
My name is Jellon Lamb.

200
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:31,290
Citizen of the world, you might say.

201
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,923
An adventurer.

202
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:38,229
And, if I may be so bold,
a man of no little education.

203
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,099
And you, sir?

204
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,980
By what name
am I honoured to address thee?

205
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,820
Of course, a... mere detail.

206
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:58,534
Mere detail.

207
00:21:59,342 --> 00:22:02,871
Forgive me, sir, but I've been stuck here

208
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:07,702
with no-one but this sorry sack
of Hibernian pig shit for conversation.

209
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:11,161
Poor, poor Dan O'Reilly.

210
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,049
Sit, sir. Drink with me.

211
00:22:17,528 --> 00:22:20,673
One more crack about the Irish,
Mr Lamb, and I'll shoot you.

212
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,182
Am I clear?

213
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:24,470
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.

214
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:26,686
Let us drink, then, to the Irish.

215
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:31,567
No finer race of men
have ever... peeled a potato.

216
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,313
Do you pray, Mr Lamb?
Good Lord, son.

217
00:22:35,413 --> 00:22:37,238
No, I do not.

218
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:40,409
I was, in days gone by, a believer.

219
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:45,030
But, alas, I came
to this beleaguered land

220
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,499
and the God in me just...

221
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:50,419
evaporated.

222
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,707
Let us change our toast, sir.

223
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:57,425
To the God who has forgotten us.

224
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,012
But first...

225
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:04,641
cardinal rule.

226
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,945
Never raise a glass with a man
whose name you do not know.

227
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:15,486
My name is Charles Murphy.

228
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:31,041
Charles, eh?

229
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,586
Perhaps you've read

230
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:35,582
'On The Origin Of The Species
By Means Of Natural Selection'

231
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,465
by Charles Darwin.

232
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:39,134
Oh, don't be thrown by the title.

233
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:43,423
He had some most fascinating
things to say.

234
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,181
Chilling things.

235
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,487
Mr Darwin spent time
studying Aboriginals.

236
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,560
He claims we are, at bottom,

237
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:59,194
one and the same.

238
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:06,744
He infers, Mr Murphy,

239
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:12,049
that we share
a common ancestry with monkeys.

240
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:18,714
Monkeys!

241
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:28,057
Mr Murphy, Russia, China, the Congo.

242
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:32,055
Oh, I have travelled
among unknown people

243
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:35,190
in lands beyond the seas.

244
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,528
But nothing...

245
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:41,772
nothing could have prepared me

246
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:45,272
for this godforsaken hole.

247
00:24:45,373 --> 00:24:49,203
You see... Mr Murphy...

248
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:54,792
I am something of a fortune hunter.

249
00:24:59,105 --> 00:25:01,667
And what fortune do you hunt
out here, Mr Lamb?

250
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:04,760
That would be my question
to you, Mr Murphy.

251
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:08,890
Unhand me, Murphy, or I'll slit
your fucking throat.

252
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:23,195
We are white men, sir.

253
00:25:25,048 --> 00:25:27,576
Not beasts.

254
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:50,973
He sits up there
in those melancholy hills.

255
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:56,306
Some say he sleeps in caves
like a beast.

256
00:25:56,406 --> 00:26:00,494
Slumbers deep like the kraken.

257
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:04,089
The blacks say that he's a spirit.

258
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,615
The troopers will never catch him.

259
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:11,702
Common force
is meaningless, Mr Murphy,

260
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:17,008
as he squats up there
on his impregnable perch.

261
00:26:20,854 --> 00:26:24,674
So I wait, Mr Murphy.

262
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,362
I wait...

263
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:37,770
Aye, you wait.

264
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:40,272
You wait here, bounty hunter.

265
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,954
- Hang him, sir.
- Hang him high, sir.

266
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,640
Hail the conquering hero.

267
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:30,490
What a vile specimen of humanity.

268
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:35,244
What a little piece of filth.

269
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,950
Not really the one that we're looking for,
though, is it, Captain?

270
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:41,243
In the end, justice will be done.

271
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:43,368
Justice.

272
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:47,633
Save your little wisdoms
for the mob, Stanley.

273
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,755
Has he told you where his brothers are?

274
00:27:51,855 --> 00:27:53,971
With due respects, Mr Fletcher,

275
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,092
perhaps it would be wise
to allow police work

276
00:27:56,192 --> 00:27:58,143
to be done by policemen.

277
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,984
What a little piece of filth.

278
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:12,608
Still, better than nothing, I suppose.

279
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:16,286
Good evening, Captain.
Good evening.

280
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:26,712
<i>"When?"
Said the moon to the stars in the sky.</i>

281
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:31,884
<i>"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home.</i>

282
00:28:33,903 --> 00:28:37,766
<i>"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry.</i>

283
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,895
<i>"Him," said the rider, dry as a bone.</i>

284
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:57,340
Me roses are looking lovely.

285
00:28:57,442 --> 00:28:59,788
I got green thumbs, I 'ave.

286
00:29:01,221 --> 00:29:03,333
I was just
thinking about England.

287
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:08,463
Do you not miss it, Martha?

288
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,916
There's much to miss.

289
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:14,051
There and here.

290
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:20,767
Let's get rid of that headache.

291
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:25,270
Now... Captain Stanley,

292
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:29,275
eat your breakfast before the flies do.

293
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,366
Made by
me own fair 'ands, them eggs.

294
00:29:37,468 --> 00:29:40,119
Me eggs
have never tasted so fine, ma'am.

295
00:29:41,762 --> 00:29:43,832
You're a good man, Morris.

296
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:47,251
And you're a good woman, Martha.

297
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:52,792
Do we have company?

298
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:55,300
Yes, I'm afraid we do.

299
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,433
Captain!

300
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,865
Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me, sir.

301
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:20,743
Martha, would you excuse us?

302
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:23,114
It's fine, Morris.
No, Martha, please.

303
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:25,457
This is police business.

304
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:36,545
How dare you come
to my house in that state?

305
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:39,386
Sir.
What exactly do you want?

306
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:41,682
We just got back from
the Arooka Ranges, sir.

307
00:30:41,781 --> 00:30:44,384
We rounded up six rebel blacks, sir.
Sean killed one.

308
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:47,520
Thought you'd want to know
about it straightaway.

309
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,153
Captain?

310
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,948
Captain?

311
00:31:01,634 --> 00:31:04,698
No, leave the door open.
It's rank in here.

312
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,623
Yes, sir.

313
00:31:07,473 --> 00:31:10,912
Are you sure you've put enough iron
on these men, Sergeant?

314
00:31:11,011 --> 00:31:13,869
They have been
adequately secured, sir.

315
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,758
Jacko, get over here.
Yes, Captain, sir.

316
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:21,011
Ask them how long they've been
hiding up in the ranges.

317
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,267
He says they very tired.

318
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:30,145
Well, you'll have a nice long rest

319
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:33,852
if you don't open your fuckin' mouths
and start yapping, you black bastards.

320
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:35,527
Sergeant.

321
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,195
Wait outside.

322
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,115
Wait outside the door.

323
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:42,617
I'll call you if and when I need you.

324
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:55,171
Ask them again

325
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,009
how long they've been
hiding up in the ranges.

326
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:09,011
Captain, sir, he said
they don't hide in the ranges,

327
00:32:09,112 --> 00:32:10,520
they live in the ranges.

328
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:13,599
Then ask him how long
they have lived in the ranges.

329
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,109
Them always been living
in the ranges, Captain, sir.

330
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:22,942
Ask him if they've seen
a white man up there.

331
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,826
Yes, Captain, sir. I'll ask them.

332
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,960
They seen white man.
White man catches them.

333
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:41,801
Jesus Christ.

334
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:43,845
I don't mean the police.

335
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:47,182
This... this man.

336
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:51,805
This man. A man with this man.

337
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,730
A white man.

338
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:56,942
This man. This man.

339
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:03,073
Ask him.

340
00:33:05,174 --> 00:33:07,695
Fella in the picture...

341
00:33:07,796 --> 00:33:09,615
he live in a cave.

342
00:33:09,714 --> 00:33:11,215
Dog man.

343
00:33:11,316 --> 00:33:12,749
Big fella.

344
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:17,663
He said dog man never sleep.
He sit there all day.

345
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:21,382
Sit down in a cave. Way up.

346
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:25,303
He live with small fella... and black fella.

347
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:28,799
Cannot catch him. Cannot kill him.

348
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,017
He's dog.

349
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:33,644
What, he eats dog?

350
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:36,057
No, Captain, sir. He is dog.

351
00:33:36,156 --> 00:33:38,138
He changed to dog.

352
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,151
He grows hair.

353
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,778
He grow teeth. Sharp.

354
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:45,401
And he grows a tail, this way.

355
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,907
Long.

356
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,405
And he stand with two leg, like this.

357
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:53,999
And he goes...

358
00:33:57,978 --> 00:33:59,998
Sergeant.

359
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:02,465
Sergeant!

360
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:09,472
<i>"When?"
Said the moon to the stars in the sky.</i>

361
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:15,019
<i>"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home.</i>

362
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:21,067
<i>"Who?" said the cloud that started to cry.</i>

363
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,907
<i>"Me," said the rider, dry as a bone.</i>

364
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:31,619
<i>"How?" said the sun
that melted the ground.</i>

365
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,293
<i>"Why?" said the river that refused to run.</i>

366
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:43,882
<i>"Where?" said the thunder
without a sound.</i>

367
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:49,262
<i>"Here," said the rider,
and took up his gun.</i>

368
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,903
The captain is weak, a weak man.

369
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:09,900
Oh, so you reckon he's weak,
Lawrence?

370
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:11,409
Fuck off, Cox.

371
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,112
Come out here
to sort out the niggers.

372
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,954
Fuck me, he's done nothing.

373
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:17,909
These black bastards,
they're running all over us.

374
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:20,829
They chose
the wrong man for the job.

375
00:35:20,929 --> 00:35:22,914
This isn't London. It's not England.

376
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:24,922
This is fuckin' Australia.

377
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:29,677
Did I say I wanted to fuck
the captain's wife?

378
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:32,215
Will you go back to sleep, Paul?
For gawd's sake.

379
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:33,849
I would like to fuck his wife.

380
00:35:33,949 --> 00:35:37,219
If I was married to that bucket
of pig's tripe you call a fuckin' wife,

381
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,228
I'd want to fuck her too.

382
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,974
"I want to fuck his wife."

383
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:43,608
I want to fuck his wife.

384
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,269
I could fuck her so...
Yeah, alright.

385
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:49,072
We all want to fuck Mrs Stanley.

386
00:35:50,215 --> 00:35:53,619
She certainly isn't getting anything
from the good captain, is she?

387
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:56,954
You know why?

388
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,914
Because he's weak.

389
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,932
He's got other things on his mind.

390
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:05,873
Because he really fucked up this time.

391
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,632
He got the boy, yeah.

392
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,920
He let the other one go.

393
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,471
Fix him right up.

394
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:19,847
Got him good...

395
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:22,135
Got him good medicine.
Fix him no time good.

396
00:38:22,235 --> 00:38:25,603
Gonna need sleep. Gonna need rest.

397
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:31,351
Don't cry, Daddy.
Blood all gone. Good and clean.

398
00:38:31,452 --> 00:38:34,278
Gonna need sleep.
Gonna need rest.

399
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,777
Good afternoon, Mr Broussard.

400
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,023
Remember to save a turkey for me.

401
00:40:40,123 --> 00:40:41,916
Of course, Mrs Stanley.

402
00:40:42,016 --> 00:40:44,242
Is everything alright?

403
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:51,137
Go home, you stupid cow.

404
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:53,501
I'm sorry. What did you say?

405
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:59,425
Mrs Stanley... perhaps
you'd better ask your husband.

406
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,947
Shut up, dog.

407
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:27,159
Holy mother of mercy.

408
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,911
Look who's raised himself
from the dead.

409
00:41:29,012 --> 00:41:31,949
Him much better now.
Him much better because I fixed him.

410
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,916
He don't look better to me.

411
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:37,414
You know, Samuel, the thing
I relished the most while I was away

412
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:40,507
was not having to see
your fuckin' face all the time.

413
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:43,619
If it weren't for me and my crack shooting,
you'd be fuckin' dingo dinner.

414
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,045
30 yards away, I was.

415
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:49,217
Blew that black bastard's head right off.

416
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:50,891
It was beautiful.

417
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:55,097
Show a bit of respect
or I might just have to shoot you...

418
00:41:55,197 --> 00:41:57,273
with my new Winchester.

419
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:02,027
Fuck! That hurt!

420
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,570
Charlie.
Go easy there.

421
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:08,594
It's alright, Charlie.

422
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:14,135
Do you want to know
why I've come back?

423
00:43:14,235 --> 00:43:16,936
I know why you've come back, Charlie.

424
00:43:18,288 --> 00:43:20,148
Look at that.

425
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:28,692
Be humble of heart, Charlie.
This is the end of things.

426
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:30,443
You're my brother, Charlie.

427
00:43:30,543 --> 00:43:32,367
You belong with me.

428
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:35,322
We are a family.

429
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:37,623
All of us.

430
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,927
Yeah, I was just getting reacquainted.

431
00:43:40,128 --> 00:43:41,518
Samuel.

432
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:45,958
Oh, be kind. A little tolerance, Charlie.

433
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:47,467
Samuel's a boy.

434
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:49,510
He's a vicious little cretin.

435
00:44:02,748 --> 00:44:04,192
Where's Mikey, Charlie?

436
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,445
Mikey stayed behind in Clarence.

437
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:09,364
You left Mikey alone?
He met a girl.

438
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,994
Mikey met a girl?
Aye.

439
00:44:14,094 --> 00:44:16,913
Mikey met a girl.

440
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:24,873
What's her name, Charlie?
Molly.

441
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:26,715
Molly.

442
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:28,731
Molly O'Boyle.

443
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:31,177
Molly O'Boyle.

444
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:36,677
A red-headed colleen, no doubt.

445
00:44:36,777 --> 00:44:38,518
Aye. Red.

446
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:40,936
Like the sunset.

447
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:43,523
Like the sunset.

448
00:44:57,846 --> 00:45:01,458
What does she do,
this... Molly O'Boyle?

449
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,630
I'm feeling a bit tired right now, Arthur.

450
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,250
Is she a farmer's daughter?
Can she cook a good lamb stew?

451
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:11,175
Would you stop it?

452
00:45:20,242 --> 00:45:22,972
Mikey's not
the same stuff as us.

453
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:26,231
We'll be flung to the depths, you and I.

454
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,027
He worships you, you know.

455
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,864
There was a time
we both did.

456
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,251
Mikey deserves better.

457
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:48,588
You were right to leave -
take him with you.

458
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:52,300
I need to rest.

459
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,760
Mary O'Boyle.

460
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,137
Molly, Arthur. Molly.

461
00:45:57,237 --> 00:46:00,726
Molly. Molly. Right. Molly.

462
00:46:29,646 --> 00:46:32,465
Mikey, Mikey.

463
00:46:32,565 --> 00:46:35,635
<i>On the fifth day
of Christmas</i>

464
00:46:35,735 --> 00:46:39,048
<i>My true love gave to me</i>

465
00:46:39,148 --> 00:46:42,487
<i>Five cats a-flogging</i>

466
00:46:42,586 --> 00:46:46,206
<i>Four nooses swinging</i>

467
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:50,027
<i>Three crows a-pecking</i>

468
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:53,376
<i>Two dogs a-pissing</i>

469
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:56,657
<i>And little Mikey</i>

470
00:46:56,757 --> 00:47:00,744
<i>Hanging from a pear tree.</i>

471
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,371
Only five more days to go, Mikey.

472
00:47:16,025 --> 00:47:18,302
Martha.

473
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,681
Martha.

474
00:47:23,282 --> 00:47:26,268
When Sergeant Lawrence said...

475
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:31,190
that the boy that you are holding
at the lock-up was man enough...

476
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,818
what did he mean by that?

477
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:38,065
Sergeant Lawrence is an ignorant thug
with the moral fortitude of a snake.

478
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:40,693
Just disregard...
What did he mean?

479
00:47:40,793 --> 00:47:42,702
What did the boy do?

480
00:47:42,802 --> 00:47:44,244
He's a member of the Burns gang.

481
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:46,365
There are certain things
a woman should not be privy...

482
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,155
I know that. I asked you a question.

483
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:49,905
I asked you not to visit me at work.

484
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:51,621
Tell me what he did to Eliza.
Enough.

485
00:47:51,722 --> 00:47:54,922
She was my friend!
Enough!

486
00:47:56,817 --> 00:47:58,885
That's enough.

487
00:48:02,237 --> 00:48:05,224
Headache, Captain Stanley?

488
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:15,818
So, what can I do for you, Mr Fletcher?

489
00:48:21,675 --> 00:48:26,822
Word has it that your men captured
half a dozen rebel blacks two days ago,

490
00:48:26,922 --> 00:48:29,289
and that one was shot in the process.

491
00:48:31,684 --> 00:48:34,086
Do you have a problem with that?

492
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:36,757
Yes, Captain, I do.

493
00:48:36,856 --> 00:48:39,251
Word came this morning
from Eight Mile Creek

494
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:41,922
that Dan O'Reilly's place was attacked.

495
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:43,472
Are you sure it was blacks?

496
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:45,556
Dan O'Reilly had so many spears in him

497
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:49,811
that he resembled your good old
garden variety English hedgehog.

498
00:48:50,786 --> 00:48:52,523
It's simple, Captain.

499
00:48:52,623 --> 00:48:55,275
It's called the law of reciprocity.

500
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:59,440
Kill one of them and they're
going to kill one of ours.

501
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:04,318
Do the job I brought you
here to do, hmm?

502
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,536
If you have to kill one,

503
00:49:06,637 --> 00:49:09,289
make sure you bloody well kill them all.

504
00:49:10,056 --> 00:49:12,458
Well, I'll send some troopers out today.

505
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:20,340
Well, is our business here finished?

506
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,422
I'm going to have Mike Burns flogged.

507
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,972
What?
100 lashes.

508
00:49:30,702 --> 00:49:32,324
Martha.

509
00:49:32,425 --> 00:49:33,980
Thank you.

510
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,817
I thought you gentlemen
might like a little tea.

511
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:39,402
Please, sit down.

512
00:49:41,295 --> 00:49:44,199
Thank you, Martha.
That would be lovely.

513
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:49,244
Thank you, Martha.

514
00:50:06,278 --> 00:50:08,528
Is there anything else I can get you?

515
00:50:08,628 --> 00:50:11,309
No, thank you, Martha. This is lovely.

516
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:17,065
Well, then, I'll leave
you two gentlemen alone.

517
00:50:30,846 --> 00:50:35,250
A clever and well-bred woman,
your wife.

518
00:50:36,643 --> 00:50:39,253
You did well for yourself, Captain.

519
00:50:43,442 --> 00:50:45,969
Word has it...

520
00:50:46,068 --> 00:50:48,472
that you had Charlie Burns.

521
00:50:49,905 --> 00:50:51,807
And you let him go.

522
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:57,516
Word has it... that you offered him
some kind of deal.

523
00:50:57,615 --> 00:50:59,983
Tell me this isn't so, Captain.

524
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:02,735
Word has it
that you promised

525
00:51:02,835 --> 00:51:05,606
those animals who raped
Eliza Hopkins a pardon

526
00:51:05,706 --> 00:51:08,409
if Charlie Burns
brought back his brother.

527
00:51:08,509 --> 00:51:11,822
A pardon for the annihilation
of the Hopkins family.

528
00:51:11,922 --> 00:51:14,873
Are you completely out of your mind?

529
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,722
Listen to me.
Mike Burns is a simpleton.

530
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:20,503
He spends all day in his cell,
crying like a child.

531
00:51:20,603 --> 00:51:23,373
It is my belief that he is
not responsible for his actions.

532
00:51:23,474 --> 00:51:26,545
I'm not interested in
your beliefs, Captain Stanley.

533
00:51:26,644 --> 00:51:28,713
Who do you think you are?
The judge and jury?

534
00:51:28,813 --> 00:51:30,681
Arthur Burns must be stopped.

535
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,016
It is he who is responsible
for this outrage.

536
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:38,097
And I know that Charlie Burns
will stop at nothing

537
00:51:38,197 --> 00:51:40,773
to protect his younger brother Mike.

538
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:44,730
So all we need do now is wait.

539
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:46,905
Wait?

540
00:51:47,005 --> 00:51:49,574
My God, man. They raped a woman.

541
00:51:49,675 --> 00:51:52,827
Tomorrow morning,
I want Mike Burns flogged.

542
00:51:56,306 --> 00:51:58,373
As I said, 100 lashes.

543
00:51:58,474 --> 00:52:00,621
This will kill him.
So be it.

544
00:52:00,721 --> 00:52:02,963
But what if I'm right?

545
00:52:03,063 --> 00:52:07,460
What if Charlie Burns does as I ask?
What if he comes back?

546
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:10,177
Then we will hang the lot of them.

547
00:52:13,532 --> 00:52:15,934
Good day.

548
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:29,364
Martha.

549
00:52:30,255 --> 00:52:32,324
Martha. Stay here.

550
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:35,661
Do not let anyone in.
I shall return tomorrow.

551
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:39,576
Martha! Do you hear me?

552
00:52:39,675 --> 00:52:41,793
Please. Stay here.

553
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:33,344
What's going on in here?

554
00:53:36,657 --> 00:53:39,427
I believe Officer Davenport
and Officer Matthews

555
00:53:39,527 --> 00:53:41,572
were entertaining the prisoner, sir.

556
00:53:41,672 --> 00:53:43,646
Is that right, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.

557
00:53:43,746 --> 00:53:46,231
Well, I've got a job for you.
Yes, sir.

558
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:48,228
You have unfinished business
in the Arooka Ranges.

559
00:53:48,327 --> 00:53:50,320
Sir.
Rebel blacks, Sergeant.

560
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,608
Within two hours,
you must find Jacko...

561
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:58,195
and recruit some more troopers

562
00:53:58,295 --> 00:54:00,121
and depart.

563
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:07,878
You fucking snake.

564
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:12,126
Why are you still standing there?

565
00:54:12,226 --> 00:54:14,719
You've been dismissed.

566
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:26,648
Where's Charlie, Mr Stanley?

567
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:30,394
I don't know, son.

568
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,320
I don't know.

569
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:44,666
Captain?

570
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,184
Captain?

571
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:21,411
- Bring him out, Stanley!
- Bring him out, Captain!

572
00:55:36,192 --> 00:55:39,721
Michael Burns.

573
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,264
Let's see him, Stanley!

574
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:48,063
Give him to us, Stanley!

575
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:54,311
Bring him out, Stanley.

576
00:55:54,413 --> 00:55:57,112
Stand aside, Stanley.

577
00:55:58,005 --> 00:55:59,949
We want justice.

578
00:56:06,139 --> 00:56:08,083
I'll shoot...

579
00:56:08,182 --> 00:56:12,581
the first person
who lays hands on Mike Burns.

580
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:14,505
Give him to us.

581
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,262
He'll sort it.

582
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:26,809
You heard me.

583
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:29,394
You move, I'll shoot you dead.

584
00:56:30,204 --> 00:56:33,900
Are you going to shoot
your wife as well, Captain?

585
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,572
Martha?

586
00:56:39,672 --> 00:56:43,257
She was with child, for God's sake.

587
00:56:43,356 --> 00:56:47,371
Martha, if this flogging goes ahead...

588
00:56:50,851 --> 00:56:53,121
it will be our death sentence.

589
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:55,880
What if it had been me?

590
00:57:16,376 --> 00:57:17,853
Come on,
you fuckin' nasty...

591
00:57:17,954 --> 00:57:19,811
Captain Stanley?

592
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:21,697
Help me!
Get up, Mikey!

593
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:23,824
Get it over and bloody done with!

594
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:27,739
Go on! Go on. Get up.
Stop it!

595
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:30,164
Get off me!

596
00:57:30,264 --> 00:57:32,918
Now stay still.

597
00:57:33,018 --> 00:57:35,170
- My good people...
- Stay still!

598
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:39,632
before you stands

599
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:43,045
one of the vilest,
most bloodthirsty villains

600
00:57:43,146 --> 00:57:46,014
this country has ever seen.

601
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:47,682
Rapist.

602
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:50,726
Looter. Murderer.

603
00:57:50,827 --> 00:57:53,563
His crimes are
of the most heinous kind.

604
00:57:54,329 --> 00:57:56,893
Before the year is out,
this man will hang.

605
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:58,686
Today, he will be flogged.

606
00:57:58,786 --> 00:58:00,195
A message to all

607
00:58:00,295 --> 00:58:04,025
who would dare transgress
the laws of this land.

608
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,818
100 lashes.
Please.

609
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:07,242
Proceed.

610
00:58:07,342 --> 00:58:09,547
One!
Please!

611
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,623
Two!

612
00:58:15,436 --> 00:58:16,621
Three!

613
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:18,385
Please!

614
00:58:20,356 --> 00:58:25,260
<i>Oh, Peggy Gordon</i>

615
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,567
<i>You are my darling</i>

616
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:36,733
<i>Come sit you down</i>

617
00:58:37,659 --> 00:58:42,121
<i>Upon my knee</i>

618
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:47,427
<i>And tell to me</i>

619
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:53,338
<i>The very reason</i>

620
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:58,914
<i>Why I am slighted so</i>

621
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:02,882
<i>By thee</i>

622
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:07,094
<i>I wish I was in</i>

623
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:12,400
<i>Some lonesome valley</i>

624
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,304
<i>Where womankind</i>

625
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:24,161
<i>Could not be found</i>

626
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:28,949
<i>And little birds</i>

627
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:34,255
<i>Sing up on the branches...</i>

628
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,913
<i>And every moment</i>

629
00:59:40,012 --> 00:59:44,414
<i>A different sound</i>

630
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:48,844
<i>Oh, Peggy Gordon</i>

631
00:59:48,945 --> 00:59:54,150
<i>You are my darling...</i>

632
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:00,851
<i>Come sit you down</i>

633
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:04,976
<i>Upon my knee</i>

634
01:00:05,076 --> 01:00:09,666
<i>And tell to me</i>

635
01:00:09,766 --> 01:00:14,788
<i>The very reason</i>

636
01:00:15,764 --> 01:00:20,969
<i>Why I am slighted so</i>

637
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:25,882
<i>By thee.</i>

638
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:39,855
He could shame a nightingale.

639
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:53,034
Thirty-eight.

640
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,539
Thirty-nine.

641
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,001
Go on.

642
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,282
Your days are over, Captain Stanley.

643
01:01:41,974 --> 01:01:44,621
<i>La, la, la.</i>

644
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:46,588
Martha.

645
01:01:47,563 --> 01:01:49,425
Come on.

646
01:01:58,534 --> 01:02:01,978
<i>La, la, la.</i>

647
01:03:34,963 --> 01:03:37,449
Martha, you must eat.

648
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,951
Tobey's made you some soup.

649
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,802
Here you go.

650
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,641
This is good.

651
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:15,277
You must eat something,
Martha, please.

652
01:04:18,172 --> 01:04:20,032
No.

653
01:04:23,637 --> 01:04:25,496
No.

654
01:04:37,108 --> 01:04:38,969
I'm so sorry.

655
01:04:41,028 --> 01:04:42,597
Forgive me, please.

656
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:45,099
I just wanted to protect you.

657
01:04:46,909 --> 01:04:49,353
I had an idea about justice and...

658
01:04:50,746 --> 01:04:53,148
for the town, for the country...

659
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:55,777
for you.

660
01:04:56,836 --> 01:04:58,697
For you.

661
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,451
And now...

662
01:05:04,594 --> 01:05:06,454
I don't know.

663
01:05:08,056 --> 01:05:09,458
Hey, quit pissing down my leg.

664
01:05:09,557 --> 01:05:11,389
Well, find your own fuckin' tree.

665
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,288
What do you need a fuckin' tree for?

666
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:14,963
Just piss out there, not on me.

667
01:05:15,063 --> 01:05:17,458
Fuck off. You pissed on me, you idiot.

668
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:19,920
Strange mob... you whities.

669
01:05:27,282 --> 01:05:28,976
Good news.

670
01:05:29,077 --> 01:05:30,936
Sergeant Laurie...

671
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,559
over there.

672
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:35,202
What?

673
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:37,170
Where?

674
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,070
See it?

675
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:41,030
Hard to see it.

676
01:05:41,882 --> 01:05:43,409
At foot of the ranges.

677
01:05:43,509 --> 01:05:45,570
What? I can't see a bloody thing.

678
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:47,112
There.

679
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:49,039
What?

680
01:05:51,766 --> 01:05:53,626
Smoke.

681
01:06:10,786 --> 01:06:12,646
Love.

682
01:06:13,496 --> 01:06:15,440
Love is the key.

683
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:19,360
Love and family.

684
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:25,652
For what are night and day -

685
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:28,780
the sun, the moon, the stars -

686
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,706
without love...

687
01:06:31,972 --> 01:06:34,375
and those you love around you?

688
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:40,438
What could be more hollow...

689
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:44,385
than to die alone... unloved?

690
01:06:46,237 --> 01:06:47,681
What the fuck was that?

691
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,141
Fuckin' trooper's rifle... 450s.

692
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,804
- Shooting blacks.
- Be calm, Samuel.

693
01:06:52,903 --> 01:06:55,396
The shots are miles away.

694
01:07:22,983 --> 01:07:26,378
<i>Thou shalt flourish</i>

695
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,463
<i>Great and free</i>

696
01:07:29,563 --> 01:07:32,510
<i>The dread and envy</i>

697
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:36,072
<i>Of them all</i>

698
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:39,565
<i>Rule Britannia</i>

699
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:43,813
<i>Britannia rules the waves</i>

700
01:07:43,913 --> 01:07:48,025
<i>Britain never, never, never</i>

701
01:07:48,126 --> 01:07:53,331
<i>Will be slaves.</i>

702
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:22,818
Burn it.

703
01:08:22,917 --> 01:08:26,029
Burn the fuckin' lot.

704
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:29,533
Don't stand there moping.

705
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:33,118
What are you doing?

706
01:08:33,219 --> 01:08:36,331
Burn everything!

707
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:44,380
Molly O'Boyle, my arse.

708
01:09:18,264 --> 01:09:22,085
Who the fuck left Danny Boy
out in the sun?

709
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:30,844
Hey, Jacko, you lazy bugger.

710
01:09:30,944 --> 01:09:33,798
I told you to bury that bastard last night.

711
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:37,135
He stinks worse than you.

712
01:09:37,234 --> 01:09:39,060
Jacko.

713
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:44,768
You got the wrong fuckin' black man.

714
01:09:44,868 --> 01:09:46,275
Slowly now, Sergeant.

715
01:09:46,376 --> 01:09:50,070
Put your privates back in your pants
and turn around.

716
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:57,154
Come to steal my brother a horse
and we find ourselves a copper.

717
01:09:57,255 --> 01:10:00,408
You fire that gun,
you'll have eight more all over you.

718
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:02,332
Fair enough.

719
01:10:06,854 --> 01:10:09,876
Step into the shade, Sergeant.

720
01:10:09,975 --> 01:10:12,636
To the back.

721
01:10:19,283 --> 01:10:21,430
Has... has Charlie found you, then?

722
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:23,724
Stanley's little mate.

723
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:25,649
Over there.

724
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:28,068
By the straw.

725
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,735
Good boy.

726
01:10:29,836 --> 01:10:32,795
That's right.
Stay. Lay down, Sergeant.

727
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,819
- Hey, hey. Come here.
- Lie down.

728
01:10:35,918 --> 01:10:38,368
I know something you don't know.

729
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:41,219
Hush now, Sergeant.

730
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:44,034
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hush.

731
01:10:44,135 --> 01:10:46,743
Your brother's come to kill you.

732
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,881
- I can help.
- You can help me?

733
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:52,793
Help... your... fuckin'... self.

734
01:10:52,894 --> 01:10:54,970
Steady. Come on.

735
01:10:55,069 --> 01:10:56,756
Help... your... fuckin'... self.

736
01:10:56,856 --> 01:11:01,011
Help... your... fuckin'... self...

737
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:03,729
copper.

738
01:11:12,421 --> 01:11:14,823
Here's your knife back, you dog.

739
01:11:25,182 --> 01:11:27,627
There's something
I want to tell you.

740
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:34,091
I've been having a dream...
most nights.

741
01:11:34,818 --> 01:11:36,761
I've kept it from you.

742
01:11:36,862 --> 01:11:39,264
But I don't suppose it matters now.

743
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:42,768
I'm in a room.

744
01:11:43,534 --> 01:11:45,137
It's our bedroom, I think.

745
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:47,063
And...

746
01:11:47,162 --> 01:11:49,524
I'm searching for something.

747
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:55,273
And then suddenly...
I feel a presence in the room and...

748
01:11:55,372 --> 01:11:58,158
I stand up and I turn around...

749
01:11:59,259 --> 01:12:03,448
and there in the doorway
is Eliza Hopkins.

750
01:12:03,548 --> 01:12:05,707
And she looks frightful.

751
01:12:05,806 --> 01:12:10,559
Her... her dress is all...
creased and torn...

752
01:12:10,658 --> 01:12:15,341
and covered in blood, and her face, too.

753
01:12:15,442 --> 01:12:18,463
All battered and bruised
and splashed with blood.

754
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:21,431
Martha...
But listen to this.

755
01:12:21,532 --> 01:12:24,511
In her arms... she's holding something.

756
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:28,020
I... I... I can't see what it is...

757
01:12:29,664 --> 01:12:32,443
because it's covered by her hair.

758
01:12:33,543 --> 01:12:36,237
And then she walks towards me.

759
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:39,239
Very slowly.

760
01:12:41,384 --> 01:12:43,286
And...

761
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:47,372
she hands me a tiny bundle.

762
01:12:50,143 --> 01:12:52,377
And I look down...

763
01:12:54,146 --> 01:12:57,382
and I see that it's a baby.

764
01:12:58,777 --> 01:13:00,636
A newborn.

765
01:13:02,488 --> 01:13:06,184
And this baby...
Oh, it's a beautiful baby, Morris.

766
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:11,648
And it... it opens its eyes.

767
01:13:11,747 --> 01:13:15,604
And then... I feel a pressure on my hand

768
01:13:15,703 --> 01:13:17,654
and I look down and I see

769
01:13:17,753 --> 01:13:21,234
that the baby has taken hold of my finger

770
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:25,244
and it's squeezing it tight in its tiny fist.

771
01:13:30,057 --> 01:13:32,461
Then I wake up.

772
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:41,984
But after I wake, it's...

773
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:44,346
it's the strangest thing.

774
01:13:44,448 --> 01:13:48,511
I can still feel...
I can still feel the pressure

775
01:13:48,612 --> 01:13:50,555
of that dream baby's hand

776
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:53,105
on my finger.

777
01:13:56,917 --> 01:13:59,362
What do you think of that?

778
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:15,753
That's the boy. Good boy.

779
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:20,676
Nice and tight, eh? Right.

780
01:14:21,568 --> 01:14:24,179
Up we get.

781
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,807
Oh, no. I wouldn't try that if I were you.

782
01:14:27,908 --> 01:14:31,351
Ligatures and knots
are one of my many talents.

783
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:40,145
And it appears
that you are singularly bereft

784
01:14:40,246 --> 01:14:43,907
in any talents whatsoever, Mr Burns.

785
01:14:46,384 --> 01:14:48,822
To be speared by a savage.

786
01:14:48,921 --> 01:14:51,789
How extraordinarily quaint.

787
01:14:53,349 --> 01:14:56,920
Easy, Mr Burns.

788
01:14:59,523 --> 01:15:01,341
I was drunk.

789
01:15:01,442 --> 01:15:03,551
You only got me because I was drunk.

790
01:15:03,652 --> 01:15:07,805
Well, I'm not drunk now.
I'm on the job now.

791
01:15:09,574 --> 01:15:11,059
Not a bad day's work either.

792
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:16,363
What is an Irishman...
but a nigger turned inside out?

793
01:15:16,533 --> 01:15:18,149
Now...

794
01:15:18,248 --> 01:15:21,354
We're going to sit down...
Charlie!

795
01:15:21,454 --> 01:15:23,238
On this log.

796
01:15:23,337 --> 01:15:26,234
Nice and easy, Mr Burns.

797
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:29,661
There.

798
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:49,925
I really should stop saving
your life, brother Charlie.

799
01:15:50,024 --> 01:15:52,559
Come on! Come on!

800
01:15:53,702 --> 01:15:55,103
All things considered.

801
01:15:55,203 --> 01:15:59,309
"There's night and day, brother."

802
01:15:59,409 --> 01:16:02,359
"Both sweet things."

803
01:16:02,461 --> 01:16:07,666
"Sun and moon and stars,
all sweet things."

804
01:16:10,092 --> 01:16:15,081
"Likewise... there's a wind on the heath."

805
01:16:16,099 --> 01:16:19,502
"Life is very..."

806
01:16:19,603 --> 01:16:22,713
"sweet, brother..."

807
01:16:23,564 --> 01:16:28,378
"Life is very sweet... brother."

808
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:32,474
"Who would wish to die?"

809
01:16:33,908 --> 01:16:36,019
George Borrow, I believe.

810
01:16:37,203 --> 01:16:39,021
A worthy writer.

811
01:16:39,122 --> 01:16:42,067
And a beautiful sentiment, sir.

812
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:45,110
But you're not my brother.

813
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:58,123
Finish him.

814
01:16:58,891 --> 01:17:01,712
Oh, dear.

815
01:17:06,106 --> 01:17:08,935
This may hurt.

816
01:17:37,096 --> 01:17:39,033
Why can't you ever just...

817
01:17:39,134 --> 01:17:40,958
stop me?

818
01:17:46,606 --> 01:17:49,134
They're hanging Mikey
come Christmas Day.

819
01:17:50,985 --> 01:17:52,797
When's Christmas, Charlie?

820
01:17:52,898 --> 01:17:54,675
I have some riding to do.

821
01:17:54,774 --> 01:17:56,682
Brother!

822
01:18:14,216 --> 01:18:15,661
Where did you get it?

823
01:18:15,761 --> 01:18:17,635
I'm a very resourceful woman.

824
01:18:17,734 --> 01:18:19,393
I never doubted it for a moment.

825
01:18:19,493 --> 01:18:21,117
Look real good, missus.

826
01:18:21,216 --> 01:18:23,251
Thank you, Tobey.

827
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:26,253
And...

828
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:39,350
And look.

829
01:18:45,873 --> 01:18:47,734
Snow.

830
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:56,158
Ho, ho, ho.

831
01:18:56,259 --> 01:18:58,453
Ho, ho, ho.

832
01:19:02,849 --> 01:19:05,418
- Who is it?
- Dr Bantrey.

833
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:13,926
Are you alone?
Yes.

834
01:19:16,447 --> 01:19:18,347
Then you may come in.

835
01:19:24,454 --> 01:19:28,894
It doesn't look good, Morris.
The boy is dying.

836
01:19:28,993 --> 01:19:32,738
Nothing I can... do.

837
01:19:36,256 --> 01:19:39,034
Sure is pretty.

838
01:19:39,135 --> 01:19:41,037
You can never get your fill
of nature, Samuel.

839
01:19:41,136 --> 01:19:44,993
To be surrounded by it is to be stilled.
It... it salves the heart.

840
01:19:45,092 --> 01:19:49,329
The mountains, the trees,
the endless plains.

841
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,338
The moon, the myriad of stars.

842
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:54,341
Every man can be made
quiet and complete.

843
01:19:54,443 --> 01:19:58,006
Even the lowliest misanthrope
or the most wretched of sinners.

844
01:19:58,105 --> 01:20:00,849
What's a misanthrope, Arthur?

845
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:03,344
Some bugger who fuckin' hates
every other bugger.

846
01:20:03,444 --> 01:20:05,514
Hey, I didn't ask you,
you black bastard.

847
01:20:05,613 --> 01:20:07,063
He's right, Samuel.

848
01:20:07,162 --> 01:20:09,440
A misanthrope
is one who hates humanity.

849
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:13,270
Is that what we are - misanthropes?

850
01:20:13,371 --> 01:20:16,322
Good Lord, no. We're a family.

851
01:20:38,278 --> 01:20:43,265
<i>"Adieu," said the bird
in the branch of a tree</i>

852
01:20:44,074 --> 01:20:49,279
<i>"Farewell," said the snake
to the dying light</i>

853
01:20:50,372 --> 01:20:55,069
<i>"Adieu," said the fish
in the river of sleep</i>

854
01:20:56,296 --> 01:21:01,033
<i>"Goodbye," said the rider,
"Goodbye and goodnight"</i>

855
01:21:04,637 --> 01:21:07,304
<i>"No," said the stars
to the moon in the sky</i>

856
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:10,502
<i>"No," said the trees
that started to moan</i>

857
01:21:13,979 --> 01:21:16,667
<i>"No," said the dust
that blinded his eyes</i>

858
01:21:16,768 --> 01:21:19,886
<i>"Yes," said the rider
and pointed his gun.</i>

859
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:30,480
Best you go now, Tobey.

860
01:21:40,923 --> 01:21:43,909
Tobey.

861
01:21:46,054 --> 01:21:48,914
Merry Christmas.

862
01:21:57,649 --> 01:21:59,760
Merry Christmas, Captain.

863
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:33,167
Prisoner coming through!

864
01:22:34,978 --> 01:22:36,421
Prisoner coming through!

865
01:22:36,521 --> 01:22:38,082
Stand back, ladies and gentlemen,

866
01:22:38,182 --> 01:22:39,882
this black fella bites!

867
01:22:39,983 --> 01:22:42,712
Keep moving,
you murdering bloody bastard!

868
01:22:42,813 --> 01:22:44,261
'Tis the jailhouse for you!

869
01:22:44,362 --> 01:22:46,597
You led us a merry bloody dance
for many days,

870
01:22:46,698 --> 01:22:49,970
but alas for you,
you dirty mongrel, we've got you!

871
01:22:50,069 --> 01:22:52,186
How am I doing?

872
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:54,980
You're doing just fine, Sergeant Stoat.

873
01:22:57,626 --> 01:23:00,654
Keep moving,
you dusky devil. Don't lag.

874
01:23:00,753 --> 01:23:03,984
And keep your lustful eyes
to the ground, you lecherous dog,

875
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:07,327
or I'll whip the filthy
black hide right off you!

876
01:23:08,177 --> 01:23:10,037
Good morning, miss.

877
01:23:30,533 --> 01:23:33,103
What's happening?
I don't know.

878
01:23:33,912 --> 01:23:37,189
It must be some of Lawrence's lot.

879
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:39,943
Oh, shit.

880
01:23:43,630 --> 01:23:45,740
Mikey. Mikey.

881
01:23:45,841 --> 01:23:47,451
This one's pissed himself.
Help!

882
01:23:47,551 --> 01:23:50,828
Where are the keys,
you bastards?

883
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,123
The fuckin' keys.

884
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:58,622
Please. Oh, God. Oh, please.

885
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:00,671
Mikey?

886
01:24:01,606 --> 01:24:03,091
Mikey.

887
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,885
Mikey. Mikey.

888
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:06,630
Will you shut him up, Charlie?

889
01:24:06,729 --> 01:24:08,387
Mikey! Mikey!

890
01:24:08,488 --> 01:24:11,216
Mikey! It's Charlie.

891
01:24:11,317 --> 01:24:12,643
Two Bob.

892
01:24:14,034 --> 01:24:15,596
I think the job's fucking done.

893
01:24:15,697 --> 01:24:17,761
Two Bob, you fuckin' yellow dog.

894
01:24:17,862 --> 01:24:19,893
Come on, sons of bitches, get down.

895
01:24:19,993 --> 01:24:21,568
- Arthur!
- Arthur!

896
01:24:21,667 --> 01:24:25,154
I'll see you at the good Captain's.
We'll save the best till last.

897
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:32,162
Get!

898
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:34,658
Stand back.

899
01:24:34,757 --> 01:24:36,582
Get!

900
01:25:48,796 --> 01:25:51,198
You look grand, Samuel.

901
01:25:52,926 --> 01:25:56,823
Well... we're going visiting.

902
01:25:56,922 --> 01:25:58,789
That's right.

903
01:27:23,516 --> 01:27:28,378
It's all your fault, Charlie.
You should never have left us.

904
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:46,662
Would you like me to carve?

905
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,024
No. No, no, no. I'll carve.

906
01:28:11,355 --> 01:28:13,550
Finest bird I ever 'ad, ma'am.

907
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:16,720
Made with my own fair 'ands.

908
01:28:47,725 --> 01:28:49,586
Thank you.

909
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:15,751
For what we are about to receive...

910
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:18,274
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

911
01:29:18,373 --> 01:29:20,533
Amen.
Amen.

912
01:29:22,385 --> 01:29:24,287
Merry Christmas.

913
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:27,791
Merry Christmas.

914
01:29:55,001 --> 01:29:57,480
Guard the woman, Samuel.

915
01:29:57,581 --> 01:30:00,155
Shit.

916
01:30:15,521 --> 01:30:17,882
Move out of your seat again, ma'am,

917
01:30:17,983 --> 01:30:21,261
and I'll stick this fork
through your fucking eye.

918
01:30:21,987 --> 01:30:23,430
Shut up.

919
01:30:23,529 --> 01:30:26,099
I said shut up.

920
01:30:50,474 --> 01:30:52,332
It's Christmas.

921
01:31:19,627 --> 01:31:21,488
What does that say?

922
01:31:33,934 --> 01:31:36,203
"To my darling wife..."

923
01:31:36,304 --> 01:31:38,539
"whom I love so much."

924
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,466
"I'm sorry."

925
01:31:42,650 --> 01:31:44,677
Sorry for what?

926
01:31:58,583 --> 01:32:01,737
Oh... ma'am...

927
01:32:01,837 --> 01:32:03,279
they're beautiful.

928
01:32:03,378 --> 01:32:06,109
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

929
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:07,944
Samuel!
That's us.

930
01:32:08,043 --> 01:32:10,662
Come on.

931
01:32:30,155 --> 01:32:32,768
You won't want to miss this, Captain.

932
01:33:06,317 --> 01:33:10,088
Samuel,
sing us Peggy Gordon.

933
01:33:10,189 --> 01:33:13,926
<i>Oh, Peggy Gordon...</i>

934
01:33:14,027 --> 01:33:19,231
<i>You are my darling...</i>

935
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:23,734
<i>Come sit you down...</i>

936
01:33:25,753 --> 01:33:29,073
- <i>Upon my knee...</i>
- Charlie.

937
01:33:29,173 --> 01:33:30,902
- Just in time.
<i>- And tell... to me...</i>

938
01:33:31,002 --> 01:33:33,787
Mikey's dead.

939
01:33:33,886 --> 01:33:35,663
<i>The very reason...</i>

940
01:33:35,764 --> 01:33:38,493
Listen to that. He sings like a bird.

941
01:33:38,594 --> 01:33:40,877
<i>Why I...</i>

942
01:34:00,371 --> 01:34:02,774
Not the gut, Charlie.

943
01:34:04,292 --> 01:34:07,069
Shit.

944
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:11,742
No more.

945
01:34:58,555 --> 01:35:00,957
I'm going to be with my brother.

946
01:36:09,751 --> 01:36:13,320
You got me, Charlie.

947
01:36:22,972 --> 01:36:25,417
What are you gonna do now?

948
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:22,676
<i>"When?" said the moon
to the stars in the sky</i>

949
01:37:22,775 --> 01:37:26,447
<i>"Soon," said the wind
that followed him home</i>

950
01:37:26,546 --> 01:37:30,542
<i>"Who?" said the cloud
that started to cry</i>

951
01:37:30,643 --> 01:37:34,569
<i>"Me," said the rider, as dry as a bone</i>

952
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:38,399
<i>"Who?" said the sun
that melted the ground</i>

953
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:42,315
<i>"Why?" said the river
that refused to run</i>

954
01:37:42,417 --> 01:37:46,234
<i>"Where?" said the thunder
without a sound</i>

955
01:37:46,335 --> 01:37:50,586
<i>"Here," said the rider,
and took up his gun</i>

956
01:38:06,577 --> 01:38:10,390
<i>"No," said the stars
to the moon in the sky</i>

957
01:38:10,490 --> 01:38:14,286
<i>"No," said the trees
that started to moan</i>

958
01:38:14,386 --> 01:38:18,215
<i>"No," said the dust
that blinded his eyes</i>

959
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:22,243
<i>"Yes," said the rider,
as white as a bone</i>

960
01:38:22,344 --> 01:38:26,238
<i>"No," said the moon
that rose from his sleep</i>

961
01:38:26,338 --> 01:38:30,041
<i>"No," said the cry of the dying sun</i>

962
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:34,225
<i>"No," said the planets
that started to weep</i>

963
01:38:34,326 --> 01:38:38,841
<i>"Yes," said the rider,
and laid down his gun.</i>

964
01:39:12,475 --> 01:39:16,505
One, two, three, four.

965
01:39:31,243 --> 01:39:34,640
<i>Clean hands and dirty hands</i>

966
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:39,694
<i>Brown eyes and blue</i>

967
01:39:44,632 --> 01:39:48,070
<i>Pale cheeks and rosy cheeks</i>

968
01:39:48,171 --> 01:39:52,998
<i>Jesus loves you</i>

969
01:39:58,145 --> 01:40:01,917
<i>If you'll come to Him today</i>

970
01:40:02,018 --> 01:40:06,220
<i>He will wash your tears away</i>

971
01:40:12,034 --> 01:40:15,599
<i>Clean hands and dirty hands</i>

972
01:40:15,698 --> 01:40:20,485
<i>Brown eyes and blue</i>

973
01:40:42,273 --> 01:40:44,252
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

974
01:40:44,351 --> 01:40:46,761
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

975
01:41:18,059 --> 01:41:20,421
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

976
01:41:24,983 --> 01:41:29,119
<i>Hey</i>

977
01:41:29,354 --> 01:41:34,059
<i>Yeah</i>

978
01:41:41,082 --> 01:41:42,943
<i>Hey</i>

979
01:41:44,461 --> 01:41:46,320
<i>Yeah</i>

980
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:09,511
<i>Hey</i>

981
01:42:18,869 --> 01:42:22,225
<i>Clean hands and dirty hands</i>

982
01:42:22,324 --> 01:42:25,610
<i>Brown eyes and blue</i>

983
01:42:31,966 --> 01:42:35,447
<i>Pale cheeks and rosy cheeks</i>

984
01:42:35,546 --> 01:42:39,791
<i>Jesus loves you</i>

985
01:42:44,895 --> 01:42:48,564
<i>If you come to Him today</i>

986
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:52,762
<i>He will wash your sins away</i>

987
01:42:57,908 --> 01:43:01,681
<i>Clean hands and dirty hands</i>

988
01:43:01,782 --> 01:43:04,983
<i>Brown eyes and blue</i>

989
01:43:05,708 --> 01:43:07,903
<i>Hey</i>
