2
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,401
All of my past washes over me.

3
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,741
All of my past is in this room.

4
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,207
I found you.

5
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,879
All of the women I have been with
are eclipsed by you.

6
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,136
I am stripped.

7
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,726
I think of you as my patient.

8
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,856
I treat you.

9
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,901
I'm stripped also.

10
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,075
I searched and searched for you.

11
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,621
I want to know you.

12
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,752
I, like my work,

13
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,881
there are rules.

14
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,717
They protect us.

15
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,513
The movement of your hands.

16
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,603
The rhythm of your hands
has become my resting place.

17
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,358
Momentary peace...

18
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,779
so sweetly broken apart.

19
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,418
Take off the mask.

20
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,930
You still have about an hour.

21
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,391
Do you wanna do the piercing?

22
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,021
Yeah.

23
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,981
- Aah.
- Shh.

24
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,950
It's almost there.

25
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,619
- Do you wanna look?
- Sure.

26
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,749
It's a little deeper than last time.

27
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,751
Yeah.

28
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,170
Do you wanna try another one?

29
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,173
Sure.

30
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,801
I love doing this.

31
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,658
It's through.

32
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,040
Hold still now.

33
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,417
- Hold still.
- Uh-huh.

34
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,061
This is the best part.

35
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,567
Aah!

36
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,975
I wrote a little note.

37
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,103
As usual.

38
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,691
Remember last week

39
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,610
when the phone lines
were all screwed up?

40
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,947
God, yeah.
I lost a whole day's work practically.

41
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,532
I was out a lot of money.

42
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,034
I called you that day.

43
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,162
I know, you told me.

44
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,998
I got scared the place
had closed down. I...

45
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,836
I worried I would never
get in touch with you.

46
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,964
I'm going to quit
at the end of the month.

47
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,057
I was thinking we could try...

48
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,643
seeing each other on the outside.

49
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,603
You...

50
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,401
you know I've wanted this
for a long time.

51
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,111
Yes, I know.

52
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,116
How should we do this?

53
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,913
Why don't you give me your number
and I'll call you?

54
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,125
I'll give you my card.

55
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,855
Mm.

56
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,214
Okay, look.
The guy told me 1:00, all right?

57
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,673
- What, do you think I made this up?
- No, no, no, no.

58
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,676
I didn't say that. I only said
that Jeff does not come in on Fridays,

59
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,969
so there must be
some misunderstanding.

60
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,597
- A misunderstanding?
- Yes, a misunderstanding. I'm sorry.

61
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,975
Staff meeting was
moved up to three today, right?

62
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,560
Uh, yes.

63
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,314
Mail keeps piling up.

64
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,194
Just getting in and you already
look like you need a Valium, Peter.

65
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,279
I'll drop by your office later.

66
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,365
So what's going on?

67
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,243
Sorry to bug you about this,
but what do you think I should say

68
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,953
to the Oxford people
on the phone today?

69
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,746
Uh, about?

70
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,249
Remember the kid who hid himself
in the building a couple of weeks ago?

71
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,792
Oh, right.

72
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,669
Well, all I can say is

73
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,796
you must tell them
what you already know.

74
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,382
They're gonna cut him off
unless you exaggerate what's going on.

75
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,884
What, like claiming
he's suicidal?

76
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,638
Well, that depends on how strongly
you feel he should stay in therapy.

77
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,518
- Anything else?
- No.

78
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,687
Thanks.

79
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,862
Thanks for calling. No messages.

80
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,586
Ooh.

81
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,471
No, no, no, no.
Relax, relax, just leave them.

82
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,187
Is there something going on?

83
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,856
You've been kind of hard
to talk to these days.

84
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,360
I know,
I've been pretty distracted.

85
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,612
Is it the clinic?

86
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,405
In part.

87
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:02,035
Do you think this has anything
to do with May's going away to college?

88
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,829
Doesn't feel that way.

89
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,750
Except her leaving
makes me know that I'm older.

90
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,671
I've been pretty preoccupied myself.

91
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,340
Ugh,
if I don't finish this book

92
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,093
up in Nova Scotia this summer,
I don't know.

93
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,553
It's not just work.

94
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,514
Well, what is it, then?

95
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,354
There's a dominant
that I've been seeing.

96
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,648
I mean...
I mean, I've been seeing...

97
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,192
one dominant for a while now.

98
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,323
She told me the other day
she's gonna stop working.

99
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,746
I've become very...

100
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,542
attached to her.

101
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,088
Is it...

102
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,173
Is it personal
or professional,

103
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,551
this attachment
you have to her?

104
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,970
- Both.
- Both?

105
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,598
We're gonna try
to get together for coffee

106
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,434
after she's stopped working.

107
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,277
Are you telling me this to reassure
yourself that that's all it'll be?

108
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,488
No, that is all it will be.

109
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,703
I just didn't want you to think
it was something else.

110
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,204
I didn't mean to...

111
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,290
I just wanted to tell you.

112
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,362
Hello?

113
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,200
I told you I'd call you.

114
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,739
Hi.

115
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,283
- Sorry, am I late?
- No, not at all.

116
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,835
So how you doing?

117
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,423
It's strange seeing you
on the outside.

118
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,342
Well, how?

119
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,804
You're uncomfortable, too.
I can tell.

120
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,473
I, uh, well, I...
I guess I am a little nervous.

121
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,851
That's good.

122
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,439
Oh, um, just a glass of white wine
for me, please.

123
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,483
Yeah, I'll have the same.

124
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:26,364
You said on the phone
your wife's gone for the summer?

125
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,870
Yeah, she's up in
Nova Scotia writing.

126
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,086
It must be hard on you
with your wife gone for so long?

127
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,672
I'm used to it.

128
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,674
She goes there every summer.

129
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,846
Does that mean
you've done this before?

130
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,306
Done what?

131
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,850
What we are doing right now.

132
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,602
No...

133
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,939
not with anyone I've ever seen.

134
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,736
- This is stupid.
- What? What?

135
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,488
Us talking like this.
The whole thing.

136
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,616
- I should go.
- Suzanne...

137
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,622
I should go.

138
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,670
I'll never feel comfortable
about how we met.

139
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,131
We would never have met
in any other way.

140
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,348
That doesn't change
the way I feel.

141
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,854
What do you want from me?

142
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,233
Nothing.

143
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,653
Well,
that's not true.

144
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,447
I do wanna talk to you.

145
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,824
You wanna know about me.

146
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,955
Yes.

147
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,212
Remember that guy I told you about?
The one who liked extreme bondage?

148
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,339
Who?
Hog-tie Harry?

149
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,928
Something happened with him
about three weeks before I quit.

150
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,682
He was one of my first regulars.

151
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,309
I never really liked him,

152
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,853
but I've always allowed him
to see me.

153
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,899
Out of some kind of perverse loyalty,
I guess.

154
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,319
But the last time I saw him,
it wasn't just that I didn't like him...

155
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,779
he repulsed me.

156
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,699
- What did he ask you to do?
- No, no, it's not that.

157
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,663
It's more that I felt
that he deserved to be humiliated

158
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,957
like he should be kicked around.

159
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,168
Didn't he feel he deserved
to be humiliated?

160
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,673
I liked hurting him, Peter.

161
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,678
Are you saying
you never felt this way before?

162
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,183
I discovered I couldn't
distance myself from the work.

163
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,060
Was I involved in this?

164
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,565
I knew we had gotten too close.

165
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,912
It's late.

166
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,127
I'm happy here.

167
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,760
I like being with you.

168
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,099
I like being with you, too.

169
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,448
Suzanne, stop.

170
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,075
What's the matter?

171
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,538
Are you enjoying this?

172
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,540
Of course I am.

173
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,043
I wasn't sure.

174
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,614
I'm not available right now.

175
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,624
Who is it?

176
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,501
Robert.

177
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,431
Um... did you decide?

178
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,559
Diana.

179
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,068
- I can take your tribute now.
- Yeah, sure.

180
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,446
Here.
All right?

181
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,906
- Great.
- Good.

182
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,366
Make yourself comfortable.

183
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,576
Take a position and Mistress Diana

184
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,161
- will be with you shortly.
- Thank you.

185
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,746
Okay.

186
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,448
You're supposed to be kneeling.

187
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,825
I guess I wanted to talk first.

188
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,084
Kneel in front of me
and we'll have a consultation.

189
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,557
What do you like?

190
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,976
I love to be stretched...

191
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,148
on a rack or on the bed,

192
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,442
sometimes across a horse.

193
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,111
I used to take a lot more pain.

194
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,490
I'm into the more erotic
parts of this now.

195
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,325
You know what a zipper is?

196
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,910
Yes, I love that,

197
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,330
but what I'm saying
is that for the scene to be successful,

198
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,709
I need to be touched
where the pain is.

199
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,797
Okay.

200
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,855
Spread your legs out.

201
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,819
More.

202
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,488
- Are you stretched enough?
- Yes, thank you.

203
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,994
I have very small nipples.

204
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,082
I think I can find them.

205
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,344
Have you done piercing?

206
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,972
No, that's the only thing
I've never tried.

207
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,226
The sight of the needles
makes me wanna pass out.

208
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,020
Pity.
I love piercing.

209
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,152
That was a terrific session.

210
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,030
Thank you.
I had a good time.

211
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,659
What days are you on?

212
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,704
Wednesday afternoon
and Thursday and Friday evenings.

213
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:03,584
But if you call in advance, I can try
to arrange to be here on another day.

214
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,381
Robert's not my real name.
It's, uh...

215
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,551
it's Peter.

216
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,766
Is Diana your real name?

217
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,727
- What do you think?
- I guess not.

218
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,774
- What do you do, Peter?
- I'm a...

219
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,692
a therapist.

220
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,486
- Really?
- You sound surprised.

221
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,907
Most therapists
take a while to admit it.

222
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,953
Are you married?

223
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,330
Yes.

224
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,417
- Do you two play?
- No, but she knows that I do it.

225
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,961
Hmm.

226
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,005
We're coming right out.

227
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,224
It's not an affair.

228
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,018
I could never do that.

229
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:12,027
My husband Chris
comes from real wealth,

230
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,238
East Coast Wall Street money,

231
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,949
and he's quite a few years
older than I am.

232
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,329
Things are all right
between us, but...

233
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,668
I've never actually known
any kind of feeling

234
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:32,131
that could be called ecstasy
with him.

235
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,884
I didn't even know what an orgasm
was until recently.

236
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,140
We had this huge
catered dinner affair,

237
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,976
some of Chris' clients,
valet parking and all that.

238
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,645
At some point
during the evening,

239
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,648
I was called into the kitchen
to resolve some stupid argument

240
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,985
about what food to bring out next
and I noticed the room

241
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,946
where the staff
had left their things.

242
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,907
And after everyone left the kitchen,

243
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,909
I went into that room,

244
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,622
and I opened one of the backpacks.

245
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,958
And... and I found some change

246
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,129
quarters, dimes, pennies.

247
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,051
I felt like I was gonna faint.

248
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,971
I began to rub the coins together

249
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,767
between my fingers
and then I began to dig my nails

250
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,436
into the coin's... flesh,

251
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,146
the surface.

252
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,649
It was like

253
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,984
a series of waves.

254
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,444
That's how I knew.

255
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,613
It must have been wonderful.

256
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,075
- It was.
- Have these experiences continued?

257
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,244
Well...

258
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,163
I felt so guilty about it
the first time,

259
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,916
I was determined
never to do it again.

260
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,043
But I did do it again

261
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,088
and after a while,
I stopped feeling guilty about it.

262
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,800
But I... I still would like to know...

263
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,221
why I get my pleasure this way.

264
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,556
Because it is restricted.

265
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,768
Can I ask you a question
about something you described?

266
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,063
- Yes.
- Did you keep the coins?

267
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,696
Well, I only needed
a few at a time.

268
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,158
I never would have given
them back.

269
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,838
You didn't buzz first.

270
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,716
I'm sorry, I forgot.

271
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,594
If you don't watch out,
you'll lose your key privileges.

272
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,306
I hope you are not serious.

273
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,852
I just like to know
you're coming up, that's all.

274
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,937
Not too much to ask, is it?

275
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,231
What are we arguing about here?

276
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,650
My right to privacy.

277
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,236
That's bullshit.

278
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,907
Suzanne, you don't like the way
I do anything these days.

279
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,247
Ugh, could you tell whoever it is
I'll call them back, please?

280
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,130
Hello?

281
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,508
She's not here right now.
Can I take message?

282
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,052
Juno?

283
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,681
And she has your number?

284
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,476
I'll take it.

285
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:34,354
This is the woman
you used to work for, isn't it?

286
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,651
Hi, Juno.

287
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,377
Let's try again.
I know you can get it.

288
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,141
F...

289
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,935
free.

290
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,441
- Let's try it another way.
- I don't wanna do this.

291
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,693
- Let's just see...
- I don't wanna do this!

292
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,362
- Peter...
- No!

293
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,002
Hi, you've reached Suzanne.

294
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,588
Please leave a message.

295
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,425
Suzanne, I was...
it's Peter.

296
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,095
I was wondering if we could
get together later?

297
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,847
Do you think that's a good idea?

298
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,182
I think it's a good idea.
Would you call me back when you...

299
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,101
when you get a chance?

300
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,319
Yeah?

301
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,779
Lisa, hi.

302
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,031
I've got one of
the Board of Directors up front.

303
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,491
Shit.

304
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,910
I'm not even close to ready
with this thing.

305
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,372
I told them I wasn't sure
if you'd left yet.

306
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,916
- If you don't mind.
- No problem.

307
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,710
Thanks.

308
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,991
You may open your eyes now.

309
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,288
You're fighting it today,
Peter.

310
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,332
Yeah, I know.

311
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,375
I know.

312
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,838
Let the control go.
Come on, you're experienced.

313
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,674
You know how to do this.

314
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,596
Hey.

315
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,607
You really have runner's legs.

316
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,859
Not too much to grab on to.

317
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,750
Let your body lead the way.

318
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,754
I wanna be taken apart.

319
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,602
Thank you.

320
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,900
Are you ready to worship me?

321
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,610
Yes.

322
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,239
Yes?

323
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,034
Yes.

324
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:07,961
The year I turned 16 was the most
horrible year of my whole life.

325
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,425
We had just arrived from Germany
to finally join my father,

326
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,385
but...

327
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,971
my parents' marriage
was always a disaster

328
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,474
and he basically left right away.

329
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,561
He came to visit me
and my brother sometimes.

330
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,107
And then, some months later,
around Christmas,

331
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,861
he just crashed into this truck
in the middle of nowhere.

332
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,363
Boom.

333
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,324
Life, I can tell you.

334
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,494
Were you... were you close?

335
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,370
- To him?
- Yeah.

336
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,124
I was his favorite.
I wanted it to be that way.

337
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,377
I think I even flirted with him.

338
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,131
In fact, I know I did.

339
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,177
- Did anything...
- No.

340
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,058
Not with him,

341
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:07,729
but my mother always hated
how close we were.

342
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,231
She was jealous.

343
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,442
She...
she always punished everyone

344
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,736
for her own unhappiness
her whole life.

345
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,031
Just like she punished me
and my brother when my dad died.

346
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,370
She was so cold and removed.

347
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,830
Sometimes when people
are in shock...

348
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,623
Look, Peter,
I have a therapist.

349
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,167
I talk to her once a week,
I don't need another one.

350
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,045
Yeah, yeah, right.

351
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,260
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so harsh.

352
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,895
- I should go.
- I'll get you a cab.

353
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,566
- No, I like walking.
- I'll walk with you.

354
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,818
No, I like walking alone.

355
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,721
Stop.

356
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,350
Please let me continue.

357
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,485
Let me... smell you.

358
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,009
Lie down.

359
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:50,141
Lie down, Peter.
We only have a few minutes left.

360
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,001
I remember being so bored that summer.

361
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,837
Also terrified
of trying to make friends.

362
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,258
I ended up hanging out
with this kid Tim.

363
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,052
I guess I thought he was cute,

364
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,304
but mostly I just needed not to be

365
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,515
the new girl with the weird accent.

366
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,686
When I gave him
the blow job that day,

367
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:20,106
I actually remember feeling proud
of myself afterwards.

368
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,652
I never knew if Tim
meant to tell everybody like that

369
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,489
or if it just got around...

370
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,701
...but by then it didn't matter.

371
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,536
Why am I telling you this?

372
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,538
You hear these kind of stories
every day.

373
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,249
I don't think that's the point.
I was gonna say...

374
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,878
if it didn't still hurt,
you wouldn't have brought it up.

375
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,382
Come on, Peter.
Even you must hold on to things

376
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,467
that irritated you
a long time ago.

377
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,927
Of course.

378
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,513
So, what?
Tell me.

379
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,473
Things at school.
School things.

380
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,434
Things I couldn't
seem to make them understand.

381
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,520
I tried it...

382
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,442
every time I'd talk,
everything seemed to come out wrong.

383
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,989
It was shameful.

384
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,202
I get mad about it.
Makes me...

385
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,873
Even now, people correct
the way I say something,

386
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:22,168
I sit there for days
going over it in my head.

387
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,046
More and more
terrified of losing it.

388
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:28,466
Jesus, listen to us.

389
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,094
What?

390
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,471
Talking about our childhood
like this.

391
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,974
People talk to me
about this sort of thing all the time.

392
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,394
That's exactly the reason why
we should be talking about other things.

393
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,646
I like listening to you.

394
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,902
I think we've established
on plenty of occasions

395
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,448
that your intentions
aren't as innocent as that, Peter.

396
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,701
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

397
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,703
You didn't like me touching you?

398
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,830
It's what I saw behind it.

399
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,040
What did you see?

400
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,126
How much more you wanted.

401
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,504
- During our sessions together...
- That wasn't me, okay?

402
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,506
You wanted to go out, too.

403
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,175
I know.

404
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:13,344
I just need to do it my way,
okay?

405
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,684
I will be back.
I will be back.

406
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,053
Do my legs now.

407
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,997
Do you want me
to take this off?

408
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,334
You know that's against the rules.

409
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,754
Do they apply to us anymore?

410
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,882
- The rules are there to protect us.
- I know.

411
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,679
You don't sleep with your patients!

412
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,141
- That's not the same thing.
- For me it is.

413
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,154
It's time to jerk off.

414
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,947
Aah!

415
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,768
I want you to come for me.

416
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:21,074
Suzanne!
Suzanne.

417
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,584
Hello, my dear.

418
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,462
Don't you look wonderful.

419
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,174
Not even a kiss hello?

420
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,219
Too late,
I'm already sitting.

421
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,476
What would you like, dear?

422
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,603
Deaf cappuccino, please.

423
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,272
No caffeine?

424
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,315
You've changed.

425
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,532
So tell me,

426
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,743
what have you been doing
with yourself

427
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,202
since you left the business?

428
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,705
Working on my art mostly.

429
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,790
That all?

430
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,667
It's a lot.

431
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,670
I'm sure. Yes.

432
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,132
And the girlfriend?

433
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,801
What about her?

434
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,346
I always thought
you'd end up with a man.

435
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,435
Oh, I suppose there's still
plenty of time for that.

436
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,815
I'm not going back to work
for you, you know?

437
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,650
Of course I do, honey.

438
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,986
No, no, I...

439
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,113
I have something specific

440
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,324
I thought you
might be interested in.

441
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,243
A very lucrative something

442
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:32,580
down in Philadelphia.
An old regular.

443
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,458
I imagine you could

444
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,460
make enough to support yourself

445
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,921
for two or three months.

446
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,134
Do people still ask for me?

447
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:48,429
Oh, yes.
They miss you.

448
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:52,308
I wonder if you know
why you're so good at it,

449
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,061
why the customers really do
miss you.

450
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:01,442
You really could
create the feeling of intimacy.

451
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,570
Fake intimacy,

452
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:08,157
but that's why the customers
kept coming back.

453
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,202
Maybe,
but so what?

454
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,996
You're still perverse.

455
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,000
There's more than one way
to express that.

456
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,465
I am sorry, Juno.
I can't help you out.

457
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,593
Have it your way.

458
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,266
You won't hold it against me, now.

459
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,770
That would be unprofitable
for both of us.

460
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,333
Hi.

461
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,045
I'm fine.
Working on a new panel.

462
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,803
I'm not sure I'm ready to see
you again so soon.

463
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:14,557
I know, I know.

464
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,142
I just need a little bit more time.

465
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,977
I'm pretty busy right now.

466
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,147
I'll call you.

467
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,860
All right,
next week sounds good.

468
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,196
Okay.

469
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:31,032
You, too.

470
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,362
- Have you read this?
- Mm-mm.

471
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,239
- Well, I have.
- Really?

472
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,699
Yeah.

473
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,660
Wasn't one just like last years?

474
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,119
Well, there's nothing new here.

475
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,579
- Let me tell you.
- Really?

476
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,831
I mean,
look at this chapter right here.

477
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,209
I know. I know.

478
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,419
Ugh,
but, my God, he's amazing.

479
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,755
It's his third book
in three years.

480
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,674
Have you read this month's issue

481
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,009
- of "Psychoanalytic Thought"?
- No.

482
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,513
Well, my essay on
counter transference in young adults,

483
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,890
- deals with a lot of the same issues...
- Really?

484
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,393
- Yes!
- Oh, please.

485
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,228
I don't know where
he gets this stuff.

486
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,855
- Well, he's got a good publisher.
- Huh.

487
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,378
How come
you're always in corners, Peter?

488
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,886
You're terrific to watch.

489
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,596
Thanks.

490
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,641
- You ever do men?
- It's usually men I do.

491
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:32,398
I haven't done a public scene
for a long time.

492
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,984
Looking for someone
to corrupt you, huh?

493
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,819
Ah, maybe so.

494
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,612
- You straight?
- Uh-huh.

495
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,656
- You married?
- Uh-huh.

496
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,117
What's your name?

497
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,619
Peter.

498
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,914
Go to the bar
and get me a bottle of water, Peter.

499
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,792
Go.

500
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,838
I'll take a water.

501
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,637
Keep the change.

502
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,777
You ready?

503
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,363
I'm ready.

504
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,617
What would you
like me to do?

505
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:28,204
I want you to go over there,

506
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,331
take off all your clothes,

507
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,625
and wait for me.

508
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,002
People will stop and stare,
but they're not allowed to touch.

509
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:38,172
You know that, right?

510
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,426
- Yes.
- You can call me Mistress Terry.

511
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,221
Yes, Mistress Terry.

512
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,310
Go.

513
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,248
Since this is
our first time together,

514
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,875
I'm gonna take it really slow.

515
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,460
I'm gonna handcuff your wrists,

516
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,754
but your feet are gonna
stay on the floor.

517
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,966
Say "Thank you, Mistress Terry. "

518
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,926
Thank you, Mistress Terry.

519
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,096
Raise your hands.

520
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,555
Good.

521
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,491
Peter, Peter, relax.

522
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,288
This is supposed to
make you feel good.

523
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,459
The safety word is "mercy".
You say "mercy" and the scene is over.

524
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,670
We don't go on to something else.

525
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,172
- We stop.
- Thank you, Mistress Terry.

526
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,883
Let me hear you say "mercy".

527
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,095
- Mercy.
- Good boy.

528
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,100
You have the option
of a blindfold.

529
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,728
I'd like to keep my eyes open,
Mistress Terry.

530
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,479
Okay.

531
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,942
- Kiss it.
- Kiss it?

532
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,777
Kiss it.

533
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,457
How's that?

534
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,542
Fine, fine.

535
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,318
Aah!

536
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,950
Aah!

537
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,746
Mercy. Mer... mercy.

538
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,082
Mercy...

539
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,626
mercy.

540
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,046
Are you sure?

541
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,673
You know my rule.

542
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,135
Yes, Mistress Terry.

543
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,649
- I'm sorry about earlier.
- Aw, you didn't like my punishment?

544
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,484
Oh, no.
You were great.

545
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,361
It was me.

546
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,113
I just...

547
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,073
didn't have it tonight.

548
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,866
Mm.

549
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:56,537
Well,
I'm here most weekends.

550
00:56:56,704 --> 00:57:00,249
I'd be happy to try again
with you, Peter.

551
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,045
If you want.

552
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,090
Thanks.

553
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,059
Hi, you've reached Suzanne.

554
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,895
Please leave a message.

555
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:25,441
Suzanne, it's Peter again.

556
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,818
I haven't heard from you
in a little while.

557
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:31,029
I hope everything's all right.

558
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,699
I was wondering if you wanted
to get together tomorrow night.

559
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,369
I'm seeing a patient at six,
but I'm free after that.

560
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,205
Call me.

561
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,835
I miss you.

562
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,091
Did you see my red nail polish?

563
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,724
Miko,
did you hear me?

564
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,605
What is it?

565
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,648
Who is Peter?

566
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,154
A friend.

567
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:17,493
He sounded
like something else.

568
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,786
I don't like the way
you said that.

569
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,705
Was he client?

570
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,958
Why would you think that?

571
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,004
Where else you meet a man?

572
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,052
He is a former client...

573
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:39,515
but I happen to have
other male friends

574
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,475
from all parts of my life.

575
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,560
You are changing
the subject.

576
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:44,728
No, I'm not.

577
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,606
You are acting as if you
don't know I've had boyfriends.

578
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,150
So, he was boyfriend, too?

579
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,069
No!
Don't...

580
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,404
change things around!

581
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,534
I thought

582
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,620
you didn't see your client
outside work.

583
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,916
I thought

584
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,086
that was breaking the rule.

585
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,510
I don't work there anymore.

586
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,095
Remember?

587
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:23,016
Argue your way out of it
like always you do...

588
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:30,065
but I saw guilt
on your face when I asked you.

589
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,693
Don't leave.

590
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,278
Let's...

591
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,283
Fuck this, Suzanne.
Fuck all of this.

592
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,625
I'm seeing a patient at six,

593
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:51,169
but I'm free after that.

594
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,130
Call me.

595
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,092
I miss you.

596
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,608
Hello?

597
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,693
Yes,

598
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,613
I would like to speak
to Juno, please.

599
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,950
Hello, Walter.

600
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,334
It's been quite a while.

601
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,461
Yes, Mistress Diana.

602
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:59,631
I don't come back East
very often anymore.

603
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,179
May I say something,
Mistress Diana?

604
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,682
Speak.

605
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,393
I was hoping
for the red leather outfit.

606
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,687
You know black
makes me uncomfortable.

607
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,365
Are you telling the mistress
what she should wear?

608
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,993
I was only hoping
that since I am paying for this...

609
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,619
This is all they've got here!

610
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,998
Next time you have to come
to New York!

611
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,750
Get up.

612
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,056
Put those on your ankles.

613
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:53,101
Uh-oh, look at you,

614
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,188
clumsy, stupid.

615
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:01,067
Mistress, Diana.

616
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,069
You know I need you
to speak more softly.

617
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,822
It's important.
The tone is not right.

618
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:09,451
If you continue
to speak like this,

619
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,204
I'm going to fix you
with a ball gag.

620
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,502
- Please, Mistress...
- Shut up!

621
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,588
Walk over to the rack
and don't move!

622
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,477
I know you're looking at me.

623
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,896
Keep your eyes on the wall.

624
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,113
Put this on your wee wee.

625
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,573
No, Mistress, please.

626
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,200
Come on, do it!

627
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,743
I don't want you
dripping on the floor.

628
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,246
It's disgusting.

629
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:08,260
May I say something,
Mistress, please?

630
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,387
What, Walter?

631
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:12,347
It is important
that you touch me correctly.

632
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,642
That... that... is just not right.

633
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,520
I've had it, Walter.

634
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,831
Open your mouth.

635
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,000
Open your mouth!

636
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,169
I'm not in the mood
to put up with this today.

637
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:46,590
I'm really not in the mood.

638
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:57,017
And I don't wanna hear
another sound from you.

639
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,515
I don't believe we're gonna be able
to continue these sessions

640
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:22,143
until your whip technique
improves significantly.

641
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,815
And I believe your session
has come to an end,

642
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,818
unless you wish to pay
for another hour.

643
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,195
And you do need
to work on that voice.

644
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,739
It's still not quite right.

645
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,242
Don't try to top me,
Walter.

646
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,298
Thank you.

647
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,471
Hello?

648
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,432
Steve?
What's going on?

649
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,483
No, no.

650
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,153
Yeah, of course I'll let you know
what's happening.

651
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,406
What I'd really like to do is to, um...

652
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,075
escape up there with you.
Yeah.

653
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,952
Have you talked to May?

654
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,538
No, I haven't either,
but she's in Venice.

655
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,957
I got a postcard from her.
Yeah, sure.

656
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,542
Uh, Pat, hold on.

657
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,044
I have another call.

658
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,589
Yeah?

659
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:40,884
Suzanne?
What is it?

660
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,643
You blew up the reproductions
from the book I gave you.

661
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,937
You don't like it?

662
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,609
No, I think this is great.

663
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,993
I wanted to apologize
for being so out of touch lately.

664
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,120
It's fine,
don't worry about it.

665
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,292
Are you all right?

666
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,504
Well, I had a tough day
at the clinic yesterday.

667
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:03,007
Uh,
so, I'm glad I'm here.

668
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,429
I haven't seen my mother
in close to a year.

669
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,515
She doesn't know
anything about my life.

670
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:15,520
Whatever you want to say
about me...

671
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,064
us...

672
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,817
She probably won't even ask.

673
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

674
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,672
So you get lost or somethin'?

675
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,340
No, why?

676
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,384
How long did it take us
to get here?

677
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,178
I don't know,
I just thought you'd be here sooner.

678
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,181
We drove right out

679
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:55,101
and if it wasn't for my friend
Peter offering to bring me,

680
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:58,062
it would've taken much longer.

681
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,940
Oh, um, Steve,
this is Peter.

682
01:12:01,108 --> 01:12:03,318
Peter.
Nice to meet you.

683
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,447
Should we go inside?

684
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:10,366
Yeah.

685
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,924
Why didn't you tell me
you had gone in for a biopsy?

686
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:32,805
I didn't want to make
a big deal of it until I knew.

687
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:35,350
I would like to be there
for your next appointment.

688
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:41,230
I'm sorry for this horribly morbid
introduction to our family.

689
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:44,609
No, no.
I'm sorry about your news.

690
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,028
Are you sure you don't want
a cup of coffee or somethin'?

691
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,155
Uh, okay, sure.

692
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,325
I'll, uh...
I'll come with you.

693
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:10,051
I have been busy with this
new art project I'm working on.

694
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:14,555
And the temp job?

695
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,102
I only do that work
to make ends meet.

696
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:22,438
What is the new
art project about?

697
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,360
It's not about one thing.

698
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,581
It was kind of your friend
to drive you over here.

699
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,668
What does he do?

700
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:46,796
He's a therapist.

701
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:48,881
Not yours, I hope.

702
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:51,551
- No, but what does that...
- Don't get upset.

703
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:54,470
I was only half serious.

704
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,603
I came here
to talk about you, Mom.

705
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,105
I'm worried.

706
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:07,442
Save your worry
for when things get really bad.

707
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,570
Stephen?

708
01:14:12,322 --> 01:14:16,200
He'll help you get
the guest room arranged upstairs.

709
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:18,828
We're not staying the night.

710
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:22,331
You came all the way out here
just to leave again?

711
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:25,918
Peter has to go back.

712
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:28,337
Did you just call me, Ma?

713
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:31,924
You'll stay for dinner at least,
I hope.

714
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,018
So do I get to see

715
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,896
this project sometime?

716
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:47,231
If you come to New York.

717
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:57,200
Are you still in the same space
near that loud bridge?

718
01:14:57,367 --> 01:15:00,745
Yes, and it's not that loud.

719
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,832
As long as you're happy.

720
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,881
I am.

721
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,759
Good.

722
01:15:19,806 --> 01:15:21,974
So, Peter,

723
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:24,519
I didn't catch
what you did in the city.

724
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,772
He analyzes people like us.

725
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,775
I'm a...
I'm a therapist.

726
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,403
You don't find it depressing?

727
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:37,073
Uh, no.
Why would you think that?

728
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,325
See, I was right.

729
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,161
You can't help analyzing people.

730
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:00,805
You're welcome to stay over.

731
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:02,848
We need to go back.

732
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,980
What?

733
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:11,607
I don't really know
what to do here.

734
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,067
Why don't you go home?

735
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,735
She can always call
if she needs anything.

736
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,154
No, I mean, in general.

737
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,785
Don't imagine the worst yet.
A lot of people make it through this.

738
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:27,331
Hey.

739
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,375
Is this all about me
not staying the night?

740
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:33,170
No, but it would be nice to think
that maybe you'd be around sometimes

741
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:35,631
if we need your help.

742
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:38,301
Let's take one step at a time,
okay?

743
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,760
Why don't you
give me a call tomorrow?

744
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,345
You know...

745
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:43,347
you keep expecting her to change

746
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:45,975
and, uh, she's not gonna.

747
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,768
So I have to?

748
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,770
Is that what you're saying?

749
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,025
Forget it.

750
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:56,277
All right?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

751
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,960
Thanks for today.

752
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,838
You going to be all right?

753
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,631
What do you mean?

754
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,386
Uh, nothing.

755
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,763
Do you wanna come up
for a little while?

756
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:15,207
- Any messages?
- Yeah, a couple of patients.

757
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:18,252
And from your wife?

758
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,962
No.

759
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:31,766
Can I kiss you?

760
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:36,771
I've only let a few people
kiss me.

761
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,275
I wanna kiss you
more than anything.

762
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,857
I will never feel comfortable

763
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:24,068
about how we met.

764
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,237
Well, we can't do anything
about that.

765
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:29,281
That's the point.

766
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,572
I wanna be inside you.

767
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:29,425
Why did you ask me up here?

768
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:35,598
When we left my mother's house,
I felt very close to you.

769
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,357
We met two and a half years ago.

770
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:47,776
You didn't me,
you met Diana.

771
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:50,237
Who did you meet?

772
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:52,948
Somebody who tops
from the bottom.

773
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:55,284
That's not fair.

774
01:21:57,996 --> 01:21:59,914
When you started to bring me
those books,

775
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,374
you were being manipulative.

776
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:05,336
It wasn't just me.
You wanted to go out, too.

777
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,255
And I gave you those books
because I thought

778
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,175
you might enjoy them.

779
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,885
I did enjoy them.

780
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,450
It's no good, Peter.

781
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,535
I can't.

782
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,702
Please leave a message.

783
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:11,331
Suzanne, it's Peter.

784
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,835
I was wondering
how you're doing.

785
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,505
Things have been
pretty stressful here at the office.

786
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,883
I guess I'll, uh...

787
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:22,843
tell you
about it when we talk.

788
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,181
I also feel exhausted
by what happened.

789
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:32,269
Why don't you give me a call?

790
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:35,230
I'll be at the office
for an hour or so.

791
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,402
I hope you...

792
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:46,491
Well, call me.

793
01:28:19,836 --> 01:28:21,336
Hi, you've reached Suzanne.

794
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:24,214
Please leave a message.

795
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,676
Suzanne, it's Peter.

796
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,261
Are you there?

797
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:34,558
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

798
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:37,644
That's all.

799
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:39,396
I'm sorry.
I feel silly calling again,

800
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,232
but it's been almost five days

801
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,860
since we last saw each other.

802
01:28:45,028 --> 01:28:46,570
Or even talked.

803
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,824
If we could just... well...

804
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,285
Hi.

805
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,203
I'm here.

806
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,226
I can't see you anymore.

807
01:29:18,394 --> 01:29:21,646
That's it, Peter.
I'm not going to change my mind.

808
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,066
I'm sorry about the other night.

809
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:25,567
I thought I could be patient.
I...

810
01:29:25,735 --> 01:29:29,821
I can't allow myself
to want you.

811
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:32,199
I know that's how you feel.

812
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,703
It will never happen again.

813
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,122
It will never happen.

814
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:41,541
I don't wanna lose you!

815
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,179
If I gave in,
I would be...

816
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:58,141
I can't.

817
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,978
And in reality, Peter,
you can't either.

818
01:30:02,146 --> 01:30:05,524
Well, that's your decision,
not mine.

819
01:30:05,691 --> 01:30:07,818
Did you forget
that you're married?

820
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:15,951
It's like your age.
It's something I can't ignore.

821
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:18,036
Let's get out of here.
Let's just walk around

822
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:20,247
- and talk about this.
- No!

823
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:23,375
No, I'm not going anywhere
with you together.

824
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:24,876
Suzanne, don't do this.

825
01:30:25,044 --> 01:30:26,461
Do what?

826
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:30,340
You are the one
who's losing control.

827
01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:32,092
You can't let go of the...

828
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:33,927
fantasy.

829
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:40,600
Is that all you think
this has been?

830
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:48,442
All?
Maybe not.

831
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,068
But it doesn't matter.

832
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:52,779
I can't be responsible for you.

833
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:42,829
Tell me what you feel, Peter.

834
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:45,081
I feel you still with me.

835
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:46,541
And this?

836
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:49,586
Pain. It feels like pain.

837
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:51,254
Tell me what's happening.

838
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:53,131
I'm sad.

839
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:55,091
Stay with it, Peter.

840
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:58,428
As a child, I'd already given up hope.

841
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,597
I was made to shape myself

842
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:02,432
to what others wanted.

843
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,101
Helpless, I searched.

844
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:07,437
I wanted to be punctured,

845
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,022
pierced,

846
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,107
torn apart.

847
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:12,734
Reformed.

848
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:17,113
Shaped, I struck at their plan.

849
01:32:17,281 --> 01:32:19,616
I wanted to puncture,

850
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,076
pierce,

851
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:22,953
rip apart.

852
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:31,419
I want to look at you again.

853
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,674
The time is up.

854
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,247
Is she okay out there?

855
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:09,583
Oh, yeah.
She's a much better swimmer than I am.

856
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,751
Oh, mm...

857
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:17,007
The fisherman finally got their new boat
landing on the south shore.

858
01:33:17,174 --> 01:33:19,175
The state approved it
a few weeks ago.

859
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:22,637
- Aw, that's too bad.
- Oh, I don't know.

860
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:24,889
I'm not even sure it'll make
that big of a difference.

861
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:28,018
Well, I thought most people
were against it.

862
01:33:28,185 --> 01:33:31,646
Eh, they were resisting
the idea of change

863
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:33,732
as much as anything else.

864
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:36,151
- That's normal, I guess.
- Hmm.

865
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,361
But not very realistic.

866
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,742
Did she tell you
anything about her trip?

867
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:46,661
No, not really.

868
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:50,040
I suppose we'll have to wait
to see the pictures.

869
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:51,541
That's funny.

870
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:54,711
How they go from telling you
absolutely everything

871
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,255
to practically nothing.

872
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:59,382
She's private.

873
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,428
Like you.

874
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:09,559
I don't know.

875
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,728
About her or you?

876
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:16,274
I'm scared most people
won't understand.

877
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:18,026
Does that include me?

878
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,611
No.

879
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:24,240
You do hurt me,
you know?

880
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,369
I know.

881
01:34:29,413 --> 01:34:30,830
And I'm sorry.

882
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:53,061
Hello?

883
01:34:53,229 --> 01:34:54,729
Suzanne.

884
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:57,232
It's Peter.

885
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,983
How are you?

886
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,279
I'm fine.

887
01:35:03,447 --> 01:35:06,449
I saw your ad in one of the magazines.

888
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:09,452
I needed the money.
It's only one day a week.

889
01:35:11,288 --> 01:35:13,998
I was wondering
if we could get together.

890
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:15,583
Just to talk.

891
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:20,213
It won't be any different
than it was a year ago.

892
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,347
Peter?

893
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:31,266
Are you there?

894
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,059
Yes.

895
01:35:34,305 --> 01:35:40,512
