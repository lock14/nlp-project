Mr Mohammed Ali! Please!



When you're bad, you can do
what you wanna do.



First of all, we wanna thank
all the newsmen



for so graciously coming out
at this hour



to see the people's champion
depart for Africa.



The dream is now becoming a reality.



(Ali) The people's choice.



So what we're going to do here today
is to talk about...Ali leaving here,



going to meet George Foreman
in his quest to regain his crown



as the heavyweight champion
of the world.



"Regain"? Defend my crown.
I'm going to defend my crown.



What I wanna do is add
a little bit more to this,



the complementary proposal
we're gonna have down there



with a festival that will complement
the greatest sporting event



in the history of the world.



Some of the most dynamic performers
from Afro-America



will be appearing down there



for the benefit of all that are honoured
and privileged to be at the stadium



in Kinshasa on 20th, 21st and 22nd,



along with the world
with its theatrical release.



It will be James Brown,



who is Soul Brother Number One,
one of our top leading black artists...



-(Ali) is he coming?
-Yes, James Brown will be there.



-We will have BB King...
-(Ali) Mmm!



-The Spinners, Miriam Makeba...
-(Ali) Mmm!



(Child squawks)



(Women speak in African dialect)



(♪ Chilled African music)



(Indistinct chatter)



(McManus) How the hell did they
slide the double-deck under here?



Or did they start up here?
Does it feel firmer than it was?



Oh, yeah.



Let's hook up the winch leads.



Hook up the winch leads.
I wanna get it 4 feet in the air.



Mickey was doing that last night.
I don't know how it works.



Check the mains
and the meters. Gary!



lf you want to, there's some service
receptacles on this first pull-switch.



You can start checking
readings on this board here.



The matrix memory has been out
since end of Cat Stevens,



and I wanna find out, it just came
from there right to here, all right?



(Car horns blaring)



(Excited chatter)



(Radio interference)



Try 18 right now cos we're getting
a lot of crap from you right now.



(Radio interference)



It's worse. Go back to 17.



'... he's standing right here and
he's just stopped work all together



'and he's not gonna do anything
until he's been paid



'for everything he's done so far.'



So we're caught up
in the middle of all this, right?



'Right, the show is gonna suffer,
it's already suffered.'



I'll have to get a hold of Bradshaw
and have him call the government



and find out about the payment
of those people out there.



Zaire.



I don't have the time for that,
what do you want? Who's this?



Hi, Bob, come over
and get your picture took.



Foreman's eye got cut.
It's on the AP, man.



Foreman got a cut in his eye and
they're talking about postponing the fight.



I'm not, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, yeah.



Making it all up. I'm calling every artist
and telling them that.



It's a practical joke
for the day before the thing.



(Laughter)



We just gotta go straight ahead.
There's still gonna be a festival, man.



-We can't cancel it.
-No, everything is all go.



Everything is on straight ahead.
I n fact, don't tell anyone.



No.



Okay, I'll call you back
in about a half hour. Okay, later.



Hold on. So, we've got the press party,
we've got the plane,



we've got the Holiday Inn,
we've got limousines.



You'll get shots in Africa upon arrival.



lf we make it!



(Laughter)



I mean, how do you call performers
and say, "Hey, it's cancelled,



"because Foreman cut his eye"?



That's what's so weird about this,
the fight and the music together, man,



you know, like, they just...
no one will ever understand that.



The festival must go on.



We got people down in Kinshasa,
the stage is being built,



the crew gotta pull out,



Bill McManus and Chip Monck gotta go
on the road with the Rolling Stones.



It's impossible for us to delay,
not one day,



it's impossible for us to delay a minute.



(Bradshaw)'Our main concern
at the moment



'is we've got 36 hours to go
for the festival, less.'



Anything else?



No, I don't see any problems
with the stadium.



We oughta have a little meeting...



And what about the reception
for the artists tonight?



I understand the aircraft
is now about midnight, right?



Somewhere between 10:00
and 11:00 I'm told now.



Have you found out if it's going
via Las Palmas or Madrid?



It's going by Madrid.



I got a call from...



Oh, you said the World Airways man
was here now.



He's out at the airport. He told me
that it'd be between 10:00 and 11:00.



We have to see him. In terms
of trying to get this charter back.



Yeah, I talked to him already.
I've already queried him on that.



I asked him if we could get a charter
out of here on the evening of 24th.



And?



Very good possibility of it.



(Woman) Do you want my passport?
(Woman #2) You have it? You've got it?



Okay. That's what I want to know?
You need to fill out both of these, okay?



Then you can have this.
Elizabeth. All right, Elizabeth.



(Bustling and chatter)



How do you feel about this?
It's obvious the answer.



But you of all people,



the most respected American
in Africa, going to Africa.



I mean, you are respected.



Come on, now, you know
where that's at.



I just feel good, man. I just feel
I'm a part of a great movement.



I see the water now, I'm glad to see you.
I'm just glad to be here.



Whoo! Who set up this meal, man?
Mama used to cook these.



Yeah, yeah!



James Brown, I work here.
Can I get your autograph, please?



-Michelle, I'm getting it!
-That's what we should be doing!



Michelle, come here.
Here she is.



-M-i-c-h-e-l-l-e?
-Yes.



I can't even spell all of that now.



(Tannoy)'Anybody that hasn't had
their tickets processed,



'please go to the counter
outside the main ballroom.'



Can't beat it, good food.



Soul cookin' in the bag.



My brothers and sisters, on behalf
of the 23 million people of Zaire,



I wish to extend their deepest gratitude
and appreciation.



And I wanna thank you
for making a dream come true,



that one day the beat
would return to the roots.



The best music you ever gonna hear in
your life is gonna be heard in Kinshasa.



They playin' some grooves down there
just make you cry.



There gonna be dancing
and shouting and jumping.



You'll have so much fun, you'll throw
your passports back on the airplane.



again, I wanna thank all of you.



And I wanna say bon voyage
on your musical historic mission,



Zaire '74, a spiritual commitment.



Thank you.



(Cheers and applause)



(Airplane engine roars overhead)



Oh, Christ, move round again.



(Man) Whaddya want from us?



So, what's the latest on the aircraft,
by the way?



Um, Alan to base.



Alan to base.



Did you get anything
after we met this afternoon?



-On the time it left Madrid?
-Oh, you know what we got?



We got a huge discrepancy
on the day that this festival starts,



um, cos Likuku said he had just come
from the presidency himself,



the presidency has notified
every newspaper



and all the TV and radio stations,



that it is on Saturday that it starts,
not Friday night.



You're saying no and I said...



No, tickets are printed for Friday,
it's always been Friday,



in the contract it's Friday,
the contract was signed six months ago.



But he said the presidency has moved it.



But he told me this morning that
it was going on absolutely as scheduled.



-Who did? Shimpupu?
-Shimpupu.



Who's going to pick up the bloody tab
for the artists? The extra tab?



They are contracted to be here
until the 25th.



Yeah, their problem says
they perform on 20, 21, or 22, right?



I understand that...



So if we ask them to perform on 23,
they'll say it's outside my contract



and they'll bloody well rip us off
for an extra fee.



We don't know that.
I'd like the extra day for better show.



My experience is the moment
you ask them to do anything



that's one dollar outside of their contract,
they are going to bloody well fight.



Every further day, I've got 200 people,
hotel bills, expenses...



We're still coming in two days
ahead of schedule, though.



-Anyway...
-lf we can make it three, all the better.



(Pariser) We got a weight it all.
I figure it's up to them.



lf we can get them to agree to it,



we've got enough ticket sales,
which is important.



(Bradshaw) We'll see. I'm not happy
about late changes like this.



Particularly when the situation
is as confused as it is now.



Alan to base.



'Let's bring up the one and only
James Brown!'



(Cheering and whistling)



Why you wanna do this to me?



I got to do it to ya
cos you did it to yourself!



You earned it! James Brown!



Oh, man.



Ladies and gentlemen,



right now I'd like to give
another special round of applause



by the way of beautiful singers,
the fabulous Spinners.



The Spinners!



Bring up Mr BB King.
Mr BB King, come right on up.



Let's give a round of applause
for the one and only Mr Bill Withers.



Come on, a big round!



You say just plain Bill?
He's not just plain Bill! A winner!



Give him another big round of applause.



The only thing I got to say is
that it's been a long time comin',



and these are just four things
I'd like to leave with you.



Four small things.



It's cold-blooded but it's been hell.



Now here's the payback,



and remember as long as you live,
Papa don't take no mess.



-No, no.
-This stage doesn't look complete.



There's bunting that goes
across the front and so on.



There's a lot of dressing that
makes it look naked without it, but...



-All that's prepared and in-hand?
-There is planking on the backside.



There's several more things
they're gonna do, but...



They guarantee me they'll have it done
by late tomorrow afternoon.



Any other problems?



(♪ Bongo beat)



(Chanting)



(Shouts)



(Buzzing)



Flies are faster here
than they are in the States.



Ain't that something?



They eat too much in America,
they lazy.



They get too much to eat.



These flies, they don't get enough to eat,
so they stay hungry and fast.



(Laughter)



I thought the Congo was a lot of jungle



and little rough Mau Maus
running around, attacking, you know?



You hear about all this,
what they in American make you think.



Some people scared to come over here,



it was in the press,
"Scared to come over here."



And people drive their cars
and they so peaceful and nice.



And they got their own airports
and hotels



and little houses and little streets
and little nightclubs and they ain't so bad.



No kidding, New York is
more of a jungle than here.



The policemen arrive
with .45 guns and dogs.



Every minute a homicide,
somebody dies.



Dying with dope and always somebody
being raped or somebody being robbed



or somebody on the rooftop
shooting twelve people.



A man goes in the bank and shoots
the teller and stabs the bank official



and he runs out
and he gets shot down the street.



Two cars, head-on, doing 100 mph.



Train jumped over a track,
mine caves in.



Always something in America.



It's so peaceful over here.



Really, the savages are in America.



You know, I mean, I'm a world traveller



and I consider myself one
the most travelled black men in America,



I'm getting around the world.



And I'm seeing things that I never saw,



so I know the average man,
the layman wouldn't even thought of it.



I'm getting on a DC-10 in Paris
and all Africans flying and operating it.



Here he is, taking the big jet off.



(Imitates engine noise)



And navigating, hitting little buttons.



(Imitates engine noise)



And coming through lightning
and thunder.



(Continues making engine noise)



'Pulling that big old jet plane through
the sky and flying it for 15 hours.'



(♪ Woman sings in Spanish)



(♪ Pace quickens)



(♪ Sings in Spanish)



Well, James, it seems like
we're going back home.



Yeah, after such a long time.



We finally, um, got our heads together.



We ain't been to Kinshasa.
We don't know what to expect.



We're gonna be met by a country
that expected a fight.



Instead they're gonna get the greatest
musical performance there ever was.



Every little band in Kinshasa and Zaire
is playing a James Brown beat.



Now it's a total, total, total
French-speaking country



and they sing every one
of your lyrics in English.



Now that says a whole lot for me.



-It says that we're not coming...
-We're there.



... black is here.



We've been back and forth,
getting reports, man,



about the way that people feel
about this, man.



This is the biggest thing that
ever happened to them, man.



And it's the biggest thing
that ever happened to us.



(♪ Singing in Spanish)



-lf you're going back now...
-I have to get back there, yeah.



How are you fixed? Are you going back
to the hotel? You got transport?



I'm gonna go back with Shimpupu.
He's here. So any problems...



Shimpupu is here? That's the man
I've been waiting to see, where is he?



-Over there. Do you want to see him?
-That's exactly right.



-How are you, Alan, all right?
-Tired.



You better wait now Shimpupu is here.
See what we can sort out.



-Keith?
-Yes?



He was fully told about all of that stuff,
time and time again.



Doesn't matter. It's all history.



Go and ask McManus
to join us with Shimpupu,



because I want to get
McManus' problem sorted out.



-What problem is that?
-His bloody cable problem.



Eight thousand bucks worth
of damn cable



which is just gonna go down
for four days and go back up again



which is the government's
responsibility anyhow.



And this fella says
he's not gonna put it down...



I wanna lay it to Shimpupu
cos he said he'd sort it.



Bill!



Wait, which Shimpupu is this?
This is the journalist?



-Yeah.
-Oh, no.



-The wrong man's here.
-(Bradshaw) Sorry!



We been on this plane now,
we going on 13 hours.



Thirteen hours on an airplane
with all this energy and all this great vibe



and all this good feeling.



I'm almost high off it
just listening to the great music.



Lloyd Price never got high in his life.



Never ever. But I tell you,
I promise you the spiritual commitment,



the rhythm and the beat,



and we're going to Kinshasa
for Zaire '74, that's what's happening.



(♪ Latino music)



People waiting at the airport
for six hours, man.



About 300,000 people.



300,000 people at the airport.
Feels like there's 300,000 on this plane!



-I think that this is just fantastic.
-Hey, let me hear some more music!



(♪ Latino music)



(Clapping and singing)



(Price) Back to the roots!



(All) Yeah!



(♪ African chanting and music)



(Laughter and screaming)



You know, we're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it, man.



-Where's Masekela?
-Masekela is here.



Masekela!



Hey, Brother Bill! Welcome.



See you later, okay.



Welcome, John. How are you?



-It's a pleasure to be here.
-It's a pleasure to have you here.



How do you like that welcome?



I love it, love it, love it.
Really love it.



-I see some beautiful ladies, too.
-Yeah.



(Screaming and cheering)



The problem is...
Forget the walkie-talkie.



-The problem is that other...
-What do you want, Abanga?



Other than the film crew and the staff,
all the baggage is done in.



Put a blessing on us,
O Great One! Ha ha!



We had it worked out perfect,



except they came,
we came with 32,000lbs extra,



and, um, don't discuss it right now.



(♪ African music)



(Cheering and applause)



(Excited chatter)



Hello, Papa!



I got ants in my pants, I gotta dance!



(McManus) All right,
on the downbeat, fellas.



A-one-ah and a-two-ah and a go!



Oh, everybody ready?



And stop.



I can only give you my record.
My mode of operandi, what I've done.



It's a fact that I got out
and hustled up $14 million,



which is a feat for any man, regardless
of colour, race, creed or religion.



And the daringness of it
is what brought it all together.



These are facts!



Excuse me.



Hi, George,
what are you doing here in Africa?



Well... I'm drunk.
Drunk in Africa, always have been.



Oh, yeah? Are you happy?



(Slurs) Well, since the...er...



Cut that damn thing off!



Next time I design a truss, I'll get
a measurement on the crack in your ass!



Next time you design a fucking truss,
make it big enough for the lamps!



You know we're always more ambitious
than the trusses.



Wait a minute, number one is still
not far enough off to the right.



It's gotta come off right further.

It's a business proposition

The money means that there's

When a man do something
that's gonna involve black people

God has made me bigger
than all the entertainers in the world,



God has made me bigger
than all athletes in the world.



Now it's my job
to whup this man, get my title,



so I can use it to help uplift
the black man in America.



That's why I go in the ring,
with this intention.



Muhammad Ali!



Come on in.



I have finally figured out just about
what we'll do and the way we'll do it.



-Okay.
-Er...



-Have you got beer?
-Uh, no...



I had beer.
Big Black brought that in.



This is what I figured out.



We'll come in with the theme bit
of Guess Who.



Then we'll play that slow blues,
whichever slow blues of my choice



at that particular time,
I don't know which one.



Then we'll follow
with Ain't Nobody Home,



The Thrill Is Gone, Sweet Sixteen.



After Sweet Sixteen, then we will do...



I Like To Live the Love and
we'll throw out Ain't Nobody Home.



I mean, we'll throw out
Hummingbird for now.



But if we have to do an encore or
if the time is running short, then we will.



Got lipstick on my handkerchief.
Good thing I ain't married.



-(Man) At the moment.
-Oh, don't rush it, man.



(Man) Taking a nice, long break.



I tell you what, as far as I'm concerned,
the break ain't over.



We still at intermission.

-Let's do a dance.
-(Girl) Do what?



Er, something we do
in Philadelphia, in America.



-We do the Bump.
-Okay.



-We do the Bump.
-(All) Bump, bump, bump.



-Yeah.
-Go on.



-Okay, one. See?
-One.



And bump and turn,
and bump and turn,



and bump...and bump!



It took me 5 years to learn the Bump,
and she gets it in one second?



-Très bien!
-(Girl) She's really good!



Please, please.



-Bump... bump...
-(All) Hey, wow!



-Hey, that's not the Bump.
-In America, you'd get arrested for that.



Thank you.



I always like to see it.
Thank you. I like to see it near me.



-Yeah, I'll see you after we hook it up.
-Right on.



I'm gonna first sit down for a minute
or so and drink me a little water.



That's the first thing I'm gonna do.



I hope it didn't sound too bad.



Er... I enjoyed parts of it.



Some parts of it, I thought,
went on pretty good.

So what we're coming back here
with is what we left here with,



plus the influences that
we picked up from living...er...



where we've lived for the last
3 or 400 years or whatever, y'know?



So we're coming back now
in the same form



but with other places on it.



Meanwhile, they've evolved
from the point



where we all were when we left here.



So we've evolved in one corner,
they've evolved in the other corner.



And now we're gonna come back
and listen to each other



and I know I'm gonna go home
knowing something...



Somebody asked me,
"What are you gonna bring back?



"You gonna bring back any souvenirs?
Somebody wants cloth and all like that."



What I wanna bring back
is the feeling.



I think of us as a people
that was maybe left out in the desert.



We were taken away and dropped off
in the desert by parachute.



We know that we got a home
someplace, but where?



So we still got the same feelings,
we still got the same ties,



we know that there it is, but where?



We know it's inside of us,
we know that it must be someplace



that somebody's thinking
along the same lines of us.



So we're in this little colony,
we're being treated a certain way,



and parts of it we don't understand,
we're in a different land,



we're in places where people speak
a different language we don't know.



But we do know, deep down in, through
the years, even though a lot of us died,



we still know that those ties
are there somewhere.



(Speaks Kiswahili)



For you, very good.



I must get...
Er, where is the interpreter?



(♪ Men play instruments)



You really just don't want
your slave to be free. Face it.



You hate to admit it
and you don't mean it that way,



but your people don't want
the slave to be free.



That's the whole thing. They'll say,
"'Really?" Well, why not let me go?



Why not let me go, white man?
They don't want to let that Negro go.



That Negro leave, that's his protection.



Tornadoes, droughts, hurricanes,
all kind of trouble.



America been under so much trouble,



if we wasn't over there,
it would've been pitiful.



The wise whites know it.



Your white brother knows
that if we wasn't in America,



it would've been in trouble long ago!



You have some problems.



We're not all brothers. No, you say
we're brothers, we not brothers.



We white and black are not brothers!
We're not brothers.



Brother don't lynch a brother, cut
his private off and put it in his mouth,



tie horses and pull him apart,
and burn him up,



and kill pregnant women
before the babies are born.



Enslave him 400 years,
rob him of his name, his language.



And today, still doin' it.



Still police is stopped on the highway
and look for black people



because their new cars
and modern times and pull him over.



And I see 'em, modern cities
and everywhere,



doing something to provoke him,
make him say something and shoot him.



You don't say nothing, he get mad,
because he can't get him for nothing.



Beat him up, all kind of injustice.



Only reason the cameras on me,
only reason I'm in the shape I'm in



is cos I'm the world's greatest fighter,
otherwise, I'd be another Negro.



(Laughter)



To show you I'm the best,
I will stay in your chest.



Since we don't get along,
we gotta get it on.



What I'm gonna say
might shock and amaze ya,



but, chump, you look like Joe Frazier!



Quit talking.



Wait a minute. Let me get a mouthpiece,
let me get a mouthpiece!



Let me get a mouthpiece!



-Are you serious?
-Brother, I ain't got no mouthpiece.



(All laugh)



(Man) Give a big round of applause.

(Cheering and whistling)



Right now,
we'd like to do some of the tunes



that created a sound
called the James Brown sound.



And this is the way it goes.



One day, a fella walked up and said,
"James, play some of your old tunes."



Said, "Hey, man,
we don't have no old tunes."



Said, "Well, play some of your oldies
but goodies."



I said, "I don't dig that.
Don't bury me while I yet live."



Then he said,
"Well, play the best of James Brown."



Fred smiled and I frowned.



He said, "Why you frowning?"
I said, "Because I can't do that.



"The best of James Brown
is yet to come."

Let me say another thing. I hope this
can be put on the tail end of this.



When you walk out this movie,



if you walk away
from your television set,



here's one thing you walk out with
in your mind.



When you get up and walk out and look
down the street, you say to yourself,



"Damn right I'm somebody."
