...get out of here alive, l tell you.

00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:03,073
Let's go!

3
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:13,474
lncoming!

4
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,331
- Sorry, captain. - lt's all right, son, just keep moving.

5
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,385
That's the future in your hands.

6
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:24,314
Heave! Heave! Heave!

7
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:27,480
- Starboard gunners ready, captain. - Lieutenant.

8
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:33,054
Fire!

9
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:38,786
Prepare to take us into the channel. Ahead a half.

10
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,919
- Make revolutions for five knots. - Aye, sir.

11
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,167
- Range, 1 50 yards! - 1 50 yards!

12
00:01:53,475 --> 00:01:54,969
Fire!

13
00:01:57,954 --> 00:01:58,936
Fire!

14
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:03,546
Fire!

15
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,097
- All ahead full. - Aye, captain.

16
00:02:43,107 --> 00:02:44,252
Stop engines.

17
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,424
- Captain? - Stop engines! Run silent!

18
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:48,252
Cease firing!

19
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,931
Cease firing! Close the gun ports. Hold still.

20
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,202
- Cease firing! - Close the gun ports!

21
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,784
Mrs. Nwokolo?

22
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:25,760
Eva Rojas, World Health Organization. This is Dr. Hopper.

23
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:27,873
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Please come with me.

24
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:35,361
Sorry about the dark. The light hurts his eyes.

25
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,015
- Thank you. - What's his name?

26
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:39,357
Azikiwe. Most call him Kiwe.

27
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:41,659
Hi, Kiwe. My name is Eva.

28
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:44,225
We need to have a little look at you, okay?

29
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,273
- How long has he been sick? - For two days.

30
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,434
- Has he traveled anywhere recently? - He was in Mali last week.

31
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,100
With his father.

32
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,333
- Where is his father now? - He's at the lighthouse.

33
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,708
That's where he works.

34
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:57,313
Blood pressure, 80/50.

35
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,578
- Circulatory failure. - Drawing blood.

36
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,697
- Easy, son. Easy. No, no. - Kiwe!

37
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,548
- Sedative, Eva. - What dose?

38
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,793
Two mils.

39
00:08:08,994 --> 00:08:11,328
Easy, son. Easy. No. lt's okay.

40
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,758
lt's all right. You're gonna be all right. Just trying to help.

41
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:15,776
lt's okay. lt's okay, Kiwe.

42
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:17,632
lt's okay.

43
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:21,150
- Your mama... Your mama is here. - lt's okay, Kiwe. lt's okay.

44
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:26,076
You all right?

45
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:29,143
- Mali, just like the others. - Yeah, l know.

46
00:08:30,498 --> 00:08:32,800
- This is an outbreak, Frank. - We've got six cases.

47
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:35,198
- That's not enough. - Oh, how many do we need?

48
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:36,703
Sixty?

49
00:08:36,898 --> 00:08:38,491
Six thousand?

50
00:08:39,842 --> 00:08:41,784
When does it start to matter?

51
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:52,093
We have to find the source, Frank.

52
00:08:54,114 --> 00:08:56,121
You wanna go to Mali.

53
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:57,400
lt's not gonna happen.

54
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:01,399
WHO isn't gonna lose any more staff to a civil war.

55
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:04,951
- Here, finish your report. - Good.

56
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:07,642
- Just in time for the autopsy. - Eva.

57
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,182
l'll do what l can do.

58
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,962
l'll re-present to the board.

59
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:18,977
- And maybe they'll listen this time. - Thank you.

60
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:21,851
We still need blood samples from his father.

61
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,676
l'll find the father.

62
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,975
Hello?

63
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:51,774
Mr. Nwokolo?

64
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,000
Mr. Nwokolo?

65
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:32,833
Hey!

66
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:35,772
Help.

67
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:49,345
You have no business being here.

68
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,488
Quick, get her bag.

69
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:25,656
Are you okay?

70
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,007
Hey! Hey, pick that up!

71
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,470
What are you doing? Come on.

72
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,765
You're walking past... All right, guys. Come on.

73
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,994
Guys, quit screwing around.

74
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,316
Come on. Come on, come on, come on. All right, stop.

75
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:13,943
All right, hold it there.

76
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:16,218
Report any variances over two feet.

77
00:12:19,586 --> 00:12:22,488
Here, hold on to these. Come on, grab it.

78
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:26,491
All right. Come on, you piece of...

79
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,344
All right, give me a wrench. l need the wrench.

80
00:12:29,538 --> 00:12:30,967
Wrench! Anybody there?

81
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,494
All right, oil. l need the oil. All right, the oil. Thank you.

82
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:44,375
That's it. All right, we're good! We're good!

83
00:12:45,058 --> 00:12:46,302
Sorry.

84
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,280
Here. Hi.

85
00:12:49,473 --> 00:12:51,000
- Al Giordino. - Eva.

86
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:52,990
- Eva Rojas. - Nice work.

87
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,528
- Thanks. - Welcome aboard.

88
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,031
Thank you.

89
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:01,692
All right, turn it on. Go down. Go, go, go, go, go.

90
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,029
More. Keep going.

91
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:06,103
Hi.

92
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:07,996
- How are you? Feeling better? - Yes, thank you.

93
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,339
- l'm Rudi. - Sorry, where are we?

94
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:12,352
This is the Martha Ann, lt's a NUMA boat. Ship.

95
00:13:12,546 --> 00:13:15,099
We didn't know who you were, so we kind of patched you up ourselves.

96
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:16,988
You had an edema of the upper tracheal track.

97
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:19,936
Rudi, l've been waiting two months for this moment.

98
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:22,049
Don't mess it up for me by letting him drown.

99
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:24,444
- Yes, admiral. - Diver up!

100
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:29,430
ln five, counting, four, three, two, one.

101
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:44,730
Ladies and gentlemen, may l introduce to you

102
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,021
after a 7 72-year engagement on the bottom of the ocean:

103
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:51,935
King Bateen!

104
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,988
Nice job, everyone.

105
00:13:57,954 --> 00:13:59,481
Except you, Al. What the hell?

106
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:02,748
lt's a 1 0-ton-rated winch, my friend, not a fly-fishing rod.

107
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:05,149
You know what? You're thinking of the Thompson 1 2-91 .

108
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,386
Whereas you're astride a 1 2-93.

109
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:09,790
- Not that you could operate either one. - Boys!

110
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:10,913
- Sir? - Sir?

111
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:13,626
The king meets the people at the museum in five hours.

112
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:15,713
- Don't worry, sir. He'll be there. - He'll be there.

113
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:16,854
He better be.

114
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,585
Secure those cables!

115
00:14:19,713 --> 00:14:22,528
Hey, look who's on her feet.

116
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:23,865
Thanks to you, l guess.

117
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,546
You were lucky to just lose your bag. Dangerous city.

118
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,665
Damn it, l did lose my bag.

119
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,305
- Nothing worth dying for, l hope. - Well, that's a tough question.

120
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:35,288
Nothing worth you dying for.

121
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:36,699
Hey, Dirk, get your butt up here

122
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,166
so we can scrape some of the crap off this thing.

123
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:40,955
- Excuse me. The wife. - Come on, ladies,

124
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:42,647
get Mr. Bateen unhooked.

125
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:45,311
Clean him up. We got a party to go to.

126
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:47,262
- Admiral? - Retired.

127
00:14:47,457 --> 00:14:49,246
- Jim Sandecker. - Eva. Eva Rojas.

128
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:51,384
l'm with the WHO.

129
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:54,815
You look like you could use a cup of coffee.

130
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,823
- Hey, Dirk. Hey, l need your help. - What?

131
00:14:58,017 --> 00:15:00,886
- ls it left over right, or right over left? - This better not be like last time.

132
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:03,009
l can't remember. lt's driving me nuts.

133
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:06,648
ls there something about a rabbit going around a tree or something?

134
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,573
l'll be there in an hour.

135
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:12,409
- What, Dirk? - That was Oshodi.

136
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,712
He thinks he might have found something.

137
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,945
Oh, that's great. That is fantastic.

138
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:22,453
- Thank you very much. - No, no, no, no, fantastic for me.

139
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:27,131
l can't wait to tell Sandecker that you're not gonna be at the museum tonight

140
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:29,817
because one of your contacts from the Nigerian underworld

141
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,951
has found evidence of a Civil War ironclad shipwrecked

142
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:35,356
- in a storm off Africa. Yeah, right. - Storm off Africa.

143
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:38,968
That's what you're talking about, right? Yeah. Sandecker's gonna freak.

144
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,625
- Look, Al... - And l'll be there. He'll turn all red.

145
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:46,080
The fox chases the rabbit around the tree and down the hole.

146
00:15:46,273 --> 00:15:49,688
That's how the tie works. Don't you worry, l'll be there.

147
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:53,663
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

148
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,113
First, l'd like to thank the Lagos museum for this magnificent reception.

149
00:15:58,338 --> 00:15:59,865
l would also like to thank

150
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:03,578
our primary benefactor on this project, Yves Massarde.

151
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,788
Thank you.

152
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,877
We are NUMA,

153
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:14,106
the National Underwater and Marine Agency.

154
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,568
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is what we do.

155
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,848
King Bateen.

156
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,744
- Where is he? - He's not at the buffet.

157
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,374
- Damn it. - Do you want another kebab?

158
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:31,610
With the help of museums, with the help of governments,

159
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:35,136
private organizations like ours can work in partnership

160
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,736
to make sure that history,

161
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,712
history that has been lost to the tides of time,

162
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:43,135
can be returned to its people. Thank you.

163
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,533
Thank you so much. Have a lovely evening.

164
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,855
Do you have a CD burner on that ship of yours?

165
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,919
Yes, the same one l bought from you last month.

166
00:16:57,858 --> 00:17:01,786
l have a wonderful piece, straight from the lraqi National Museum.

167
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:04,768
Don't show me things like that, Oshodi. We're not that friendly.

168
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:08,824
Okay, okay. Now, here it is.

169
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:14,649
A very special piece. The one l spoke to you about.

170
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:19,223
lt breaks my heart just to show it to you.

171
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,835
Where did you get this?

172
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,691
Cash, please.

173
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,289
We are not that friendly.

174
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,872
This is a great party.

175
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,680
- Thank you for inviting us, admiral. - The pleasure is mine.

176
00:17:55,873 --> 00:17:58,012
Yves, this is the woman l was telling you about,

177
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,835
- Dr. Eva Rojas. - Hi.

178
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,073
l'm delighted to make your acquaintance. l'm Yves Massarde.

179
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:04,063
Nice to meet you. This is Dr. Frank Hopper.

180
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,533
- How do you do? - How do you do?

181
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:07,966
Yves does a lot of business in Africa.

182
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:10,328
Some even in Mali.

183
00:18:11,681 --> 00:18:13,339
Will you excuse me?

184
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,916
l understand you believe there is some sort of plague coming out of Mali?

185
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,673
We don't like to say ''plague.''

186
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,662
- What do you think it is then? - A plague.

187
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,711
So you do business in Mali?

188
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:26,016
Do you know anyone there who could help us

189
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:28,348
by pressuring the WHO to send a team?

190
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,229
Well, you see, much of Mali is controlled by a warlord.

191
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,248
General Kazim. Do you know him?

192
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes. He used to be a colonel in the Malian army,

193
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:38,233
and gave himself an upgrade the day he shot the president.

194
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,352
He's the man who put the ''war'' back into ''warlord.''

195
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:41,854
And he controls the country?

196
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:43,740
Half of it. And the other half no one controls,

197
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,464
but l don't know which is worse.

198
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:49,046
But l have to warn you, it is very dangerous for foreigners right now.

199
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:51,388
l would say it's probably more dangerous for locals.

200
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:55,066
Yes, but your death would look very bad in the papers.

201
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,989
So does the word ''plague.''

202
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:03,226
All right, l will call some people, but at the end of the day,

203
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,458
l'm just a businessman, so be patient.

204
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:08,544
Oh, yeah, she's good at that.

205
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:12,448
He's not gonna help us. This was a waste of time.

206
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:15,870
Eva, we can't just wander into the middle of a Malian civil war.

207
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:18,432
The fighting with the Tuaregs is too severe. You know that.

208
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,210
l think we should go back to the hospital...

209
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,092
Admiral, have you ever seen a Confederate gold dollar?

210
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,111
- Dear God, don't start this again. - Of course not.

211
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:27,735
The Confederacy never made a gold dollar.

212
00:19:27,937 --> 00:19:29,464
The mint was destroyed near the end of the war.

213
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,487
Dirk, l beg you on my hands and knees. Don't.

214
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,194
But not before Jefferson Davis had five samples made.

215
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:38,045
He gave four of those samples to his top generals:

216
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:41,176
- Lee, Jackson, Stuart and Johnston. - Every time we come to Africa,

217
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:44,246
out comes that stupid ship model. Out come the old port journals.

218
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,592
We are leaving for Australia tomorrow.

219
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,345
Four of those samples have been found.

220
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,354
But the fifth never was.

221
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:53,593
That one was given to an old family friend of Davis.

222
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,640
A brilliant young sea captain named Mason Tombs.

223
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,800
Captain of the CSS ironclad Texas.

224
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:04,379
- Where in the hell did you get this? - Frederick Oshodi.

225
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:05,886
And he got it from a man named lndigwe.

226
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,343
But the important thing is that lndigwe found this in Labbezanga, Mali.

227
00:20:09,537 --> 00:20:10,682
Hey, my dad collects coins.

228
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:14,296
No, that coin and the Texas were on the Niger River.

229
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:16,863
lt's impossible. An ironclad couldn't make it with her draft.

230
00:20:17,057 --> 00:20:19,129
Let me take the Calliope to Labbezanga, have a look around.

231
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:21,500
- You can't have my boat, Dirk. - Three days, admiral.

232
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:23,802
Just three days. lmagine.

233
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,311
lmagine.

234
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,620
All right, if l strike out,

235
00:20:30,818 --> 00:20:33,022
you'll never hear another word about this.

236
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,303
You got 72 hours.

237
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,392
And not a nanosecond more.

238
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:41,817
You fellas just bought yourself a boat trip.

239
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,631
You're a gentleman, admiral. l don't care what they say about you.

240
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,255
l got a bottle says we never find it.

241
00:20:48,385 --> 00:20:51,680
- Make it a case. - All right. You're on.

242
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:17,277
- Okay, l'll see you later. - See you later.

243
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:19,583
Hey, yo!

244
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,772
- You're late. - Excuse me?

245
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:26,009
- l was told 8:00 departure. - Eight o'clock?

246
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,965
- l never said 8:00. - l said 9.

247
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,655
- Nine. - lt's after 1 0.

248
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,970
Who said 8?

249
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:32,824
Admiral Sandecker.

250
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,098
Yeah, he said to give him a call if you had any problems.

251
00:21:35,298 --> 00:21:37,054
A problem? With what?

252
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,088
He wants you to take us up the river to Mali.

253
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,518
- What? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

254
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:46,680
- Taking you to Mali? - Wait.

255
00:21:46,881 --> 00:21:48,572
There's been an outbreak in Mali.

256
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:52,446
- lt's going to become an epidemic. - And you wanna hitch a ride, doctor?

257
00:21:53,089 --> 00:21:55,096
What, WHO's making budgetary cutbacks?

258
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:56,856
Please. lt's important.

259
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,405
- You guys got enough gear? - Probably not.

260
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,318
Small boat. No privacy.

261
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:10,588
l'm not shy.

262
00:23:29,665 --> 00:23:31,007
Where do you call home?

263
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,405
l have a house in Monterey, but l'm never there.

264
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:35,935
Monterey. There's great diving in Monterey.

265
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:38,333
ls that all you ever think about? Diving?

266
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:42,424
No. Sometimes l think about Petricola pholadiformis.

267
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,535
The angel wing clam.

268
00:23:46,689 --> 00:23:48,216
- Beautiful. - Yeah.

269
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,653
This river's the only place on earth they're found.

270
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:52,475
When they're underwater, they glow in the dark.

271
00:23:52,673 --> 00:23:55,291
Now, the amazing thing is that modern science cannot explain why.

272
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:56,896
There must be a reason.

273
00:23:57,729 --> 00:23:59,933
Till then, my theory is that they do it because they can.

274
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:02,463
Dirk! That's it. Let's go.

275
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:04,631
Angel wings.

276
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:08,895
World would be a lot cooler place if more of us were like that, huh?

277
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:24,953
This is the center of the cluster. Here. Asselar.

278
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:26,811
That's where we have to go.

279
00:24:27,297 --> 00:24:28,955
Right in the middle of Kazim's civil war.

280
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,542
Hey, you ever been after marlins, doctors?

281
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:33,817
Oh, no, not the marlin story again, Al.

282
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:36,416
Seven hundred and thirty-three pounds.

283
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,260
Five and a half hours in the fighting chair.

284
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:42,392
- l thought it was 600 pounds. - Hey!

285
00:24:42,593 --> 00:24:46,171
What did you catch that day? l can't remember anything at all.

286
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:47,863
How long you guys been together?

287
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:51,677
Oh, since kindergarten. College. Navy. NUMA.

288
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:54,109
Poor guy's always been in my shadow.

289
00:24:54,305 --> 00:24:56,825
Always the Al's-maid, never the Al.

290
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:58,683
Right?

291
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:04,761
Nice, doc.

292
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:06,653
You're pulling your weight.

293
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:12,951
- My watch, chief. - All right, my man. Excellent.

294
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:20,982
Your friend Al told me all about your Captain Tombs and his boat.

295
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,778
Oh, he did, did he?

296
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:26,426
He also said ironclads were not made to cross the ocean.

297
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,178
Well, neither was man. Tequila?

298
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:34,744
And you found a coin?

299
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:39,575
Not just a coin.

300
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:43,456
l found the coin.

301
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:46,461
Now, l also have a letter from the captain's widow

302
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:49,821
alluding to her husband's urgent Eastern voyage.

303
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:52,024
l have a sailor's log on an Atlantic clipper

304
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:54,843
who swears on a stack of Bibles he saw a great iron beast

305
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:57,430
steaming two miles off the African coast.

306
00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:02,719
Now, what kind of man tries to take a ship like that across the ocean?

307
00:26:04,225 --> 00:26:06,134
Why? How?

308
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,089
l don't know.

309
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,750
But l plan on finding out.

310
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:17,592
Al loves it when people ask me that, thinks it makes me look a bit:

311
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:29,148
This must be nice.

312
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,865
To have this as your office.

313
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,516
Well, every great thing that's ever happened to me

314
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:37,207
happened in the water.

315
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:41,116
Every one.

316
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:54,558
Hey, Rudi, come on, help me out with this.

317
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,633
Oumar.

318
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,875
- You got it? - There you go.

319
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:02,334
- How long to Asselar? - Oh, six, eight hours. No problem.

320
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,220
- You stay for long? - No, not long.

321
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:05,879
All right, this one too.

322
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:08,536
- Think it'll be safe? - Oh, it's okay.

323
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:11,672
Where we go now, no fighting. No problem.

324
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:14,458
- Yeah, no problem. - No Tuareg.

325
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:18,304
Listen, l've been thinking.

326
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:21,310
When this is over, there's a place l know.

327
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:23,360
lt's called Monterey.

328
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:25,689
- Never heard of it. - No?

329
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:27,960
lt's got a beautiful beach.

330
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:31,292
Golden sands, aqua-blue surf. The place is paradise.

331
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:32,863
- Sounds good. - Oh, yeah.

332
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:37,112
l also happen to know a woman who has a house there.

333
00:27:37,313 --> 00:27:40,925
And because she's a workaholic, she's never at home.

334
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:43,990
Now, l haven't asked her, but l'm pretty sure that she wouldn't mind

335
00:27:44,225 --> 00:27:45,272
if you dropped by.

336
00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:46,907
Can l bring a friend?

337
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:50,041
You'd have to ask her.

338
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:52,096
l already did.

339
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:54,455
You did?

340
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,946
You, me and the bay of Monterey.

341
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,237
Thank you for everything.

342
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,065
- You're welcome. - And good luck to you.

343
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,232
You as well. Bonne route, doctor.

344
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,212
Mr. lndigwe, he lives...

345
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,384
lndigwe. He find this one week before, yes?

346
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:41,856
You know, l'm not too much of a linguist...

347
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:43,964
...but that didn't sound too good.

348
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:46,237
lndigwe is dead.

349
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:51,296
Yeah. Hey, the check.

350
00:28:51,489 --> 00:28:53,878
What is ''the check''? L'addition,

351
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:04,508
Hey, you know, my dad collected ancient coins.

352
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:08,796
From Rome, China, Siam, Persia.

353
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:12,157
Somehow they all ended up in a shoebox in New Jersey.

354
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:16,599
- Meaning? - Coins travel, Dirk.

355
00:29:17,665 --> 00:29:20,981
Even if that poor guy was still alive, it could have been nothing.

356
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:25,110
Yeah, but the coin traveled from somewhere, Al.

357
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:27,516
And unless it hitched a ride on the back of a dolphin,

358
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:29,240
l'm gonna guess that its jumping-off point

359
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,676
was a little bit closer to where we're sitting.

360
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:37,375
Really, you can see that ironclad steaming up the river? l mean, really?

361
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:41,049
lsn't it more likely that we missed it somewhere off the coast of Virginia?

362
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,442
Right?

363
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,382
Hello?

364
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,207
Dirk.

365
00:29:52,097 --> 00:29:53,984
l'll meet you at the boat.

366
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:59,964
No, l got the check.

367
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,167
Don't worry about it. l'm serious.

368
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:03,776
l know, l get it all the time.

369
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,449
Sit down, l'll get the check. L'addition,

370
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,820
Ya-Sheikh.

371
00:31:02,593 --> 00:31:03,869
My name is Dirk.

372
00:31:05,825 --> 00:31:07,483
l'm looking for a boat.

373
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,317
And when would we be seeing this boat?

374
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:16,571
About 1 40 years ago, in 1 866.

375
00:31:16,768 --> 00:31:20,216
Back when Labbezanga was one of the greatest ports in Africa.

376
00:31:20,417 --> 00:31:21,791
Do you know anything else?

377
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:25,695
We use events to find dates, not dates to find events.

378
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:28,636
Well, there was a storm.

379
00:31:28,992 --> 00:31:30,650
There was a great storm.

380
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:32,921
One that would have raised the depths of the Niger

381
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:35,771
enough to allow the boat to get here, yes.

382
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:45,724
lt is written here.

383
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:48,950
Six days after the great storm,

384
00:31:49,152 --> 00:31:54,651
a dark ship rode without sails under the banner of a single star.

385
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:59,388
lt was driven upriver, never to return.

386
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:01,686
Bearing...

387
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,056
...death.

388
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:07,935
lt brought a sickness from here up to Gao

389
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:12,568
and bore over 300 souls to heaven.

390
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,702
lt was believed a damnation from Allah.

391
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:18,110
A ghost ship.

392
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:20,213
A cursed ship.

393
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,845
What does that mean?

394
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,596
- What? - That's Arabic, Al.

395
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,286
Yeah. Sounds poetic. What's it mean?

396
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:45,212
''The ship of death.''

397
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:47,318
Great. Should we call Sandecker?

398
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,407
- No. - What ship? Whose death?

399
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:50,877
He'd just tell us to come home.

400
00:32:51,073 --> 00:32:53,440
- Sounds reasonable. - Yeah, then l'd get a case of tequila.

401
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:55,607
Boys, we are going upriver to Gao.

402
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,037
All right. Rudi, you gonna run the sonar on the riverbed?

403
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:01,752
Come on, l was hoping to meet a girl on the Australia trip.

404
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,286
No, African war zone. Ship of death.

405
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:11,196
Bye.

406
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:38,907
- Got a profile. - Another truck bumper?

407
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,828
Bicycle? VCR?

408
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:44,155
Sixteen degrees, twenty-decimal-zero minutes north, zero...

409
00:33:44,352 --> 00:33:46,938
Wait, hold on. lt's just some interference with the buoy.

410
00:33:47,136 --> 00:33:48,859
- Al. - Yeah, l got it.

411
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,300
When did you check the calibration?

412
00:33:50,497 --> 00:33:51,959
l had it out of the water three hours ago.

413
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:53,568
All right.

414
00:33:55,584 --> 00:33:57,853
- Anything, Al? - Hey, guys.

415
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:00,415
Take a look at this.

416
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:06,719
lt's red algae.

417
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:09,692
That doesn't make any sense, this is fresh water.

418
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:11,703
- l'd better get a sample. - Yep.

419
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,316
lt's okay, they're just looking for Tuareg fighters.

420
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,931
Very well, thank you.

421
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:06,269
For you.

422
00:35:08,257 --> 00:35:09,686
Join me.

423
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,644
Thank you.

424
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:17,119
These belonged to General Mayenne.

425
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,429
Then one of them actually killed the Comte de Vezelay.

426
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:26,044
lsn't that fascinating?

427
00:35:27,265 --> 00:35:29,982
Beads for the natives, Yves.

428
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:32,443
What do you want?

429
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:36,893
Well, you know the doctors l was telling you about?

430
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,536
l am afraid they're on their way to Mali.

431
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:44,281
l thought your man was going to take care of them in Lagos.

432
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,065
- Well, we had a problem. - And now the problem is mine.

433
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:54,939
And another thing, general, if l may say,

434
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:59,328
l am slightly concerned your measures of containment

435
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,982
are losing their effectiveness.

436
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:04,446
Why? Because five or six poor souls escaped from Mali

437
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:06,975
- and died in their beds? - The disease spreads quickly.

438
00:36:07,169 --> 00:36:10,235
And luckily, it kills quickly too.

439
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:15,801
General, l think you should control the movements of your population.

440
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:17,112
What's that?

441
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:21,206
Are you trying to tell me how to run my country?

442
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,774
You take care of your business, Yves.

443
00:36:24,288 --> 00:36:25,815
l'll take care of mine.

444
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:27,958
Of course.

445
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,854
- Rocks? - Nope.

446
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:33,397
- River? Radio? - Nope.

447
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,960
- Radar? - Rudi.

448
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,436
- You... That's not... - lt is.

449
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,454
- He can't even... - Here we go again. l spy.

450
00:36:39,648 --> 00:36:43,096
- All right, something l might get. - l spy...

451
00:36:43,297 --> 00:36:45,631
- l spy with my little eye... - Guys.

452
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:50,331
- Company. - This is the Malian Civil Authority.

453
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,535
- l got it. - Prepare to be boarded.

454
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:54,775
You are trespassing in Malian waters.

455
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:56,439
Shut off your engine and throw out a rope.

456
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,975
Hi, this is Al Giordino speaking.

457
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:02,016
Al, Sandecker. l presume you're on your way home with my boat?

458
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:03,834
- Everyone on deck, right now. - lt's for you.

459
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:05,941
- Al, what's going on? - Where are the doctors?

460
00:37:06,145 --> 00:37:08,120
Where are they? We are looking for the doctors.

461
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,971
l have to put you on hold. l don't believe this is a normal shakedown, Al.

462
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:15,478
lf you do not shut off your engine, you run the risk of being fired upon.

463
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,047
The doctors. We are looking for the doctors. Where are they?

464
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,793
- Where is the woman? - l'm sorry. l don't speak English.

465
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,747
You are speaking English now.

466
00:37:22,944 --> 00:37:26,260
No, no. l only know how to say, ''l don't speak English,'' in English.

467
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,098
- Al. - Hi. Hold on.

468
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,296
Stop! Stop the engines now before we open fire.

469
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:39,159
Whoa, hat!

470
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,716
- Did you get my hat? - Sorry, it's gone.

471
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:48,799
That's my favorite hat.

472
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,741
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

473
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,353
- Where's Dirk? - l think he's...

474
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,773
Hold on.

475
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:55,255
Dirk! Dirk.

476
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:07,255
l'm gonna come in. You jump on the front.

477
00:39:07,457 --> 00:39:10,207
- You want me to jump? - Get on the front of the boat. Got it?

478
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,218
- Really? - What am l...?

479
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:22,550
- Al! - What?

480
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:27,802
Here, flare gun.

481
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,171
- Signal for help? - No, shoot them.

482
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:40,253
- Hey! - Sorry.

483
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,407
Come a little closer, babe. Come.

484
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,466
Oh, yeah!

485
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,975
That is what l'm talking about.

486
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,528
- Are you all right? - That was close.

487
00:40:45,728 --> 00:40:47,102
- Al, pick up the phone, - Yeah, it was.

488
00:40:47,296 --> 00:40:48,725
- How about you? - Pick up the phone,

489
00:40:48,928 --> 00:40:50,302
- Glad l'm driving. - Still there?

490
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:52,089
- l am too. - What the hell is going on?

491
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:53,695
l shot a guy with a flare gun.

492
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,644
- A flare gun? What? - Cool.

493
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,342
What did you...? Did you say you shot someone with a flare gun?

494
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:58,806
What did you...? Did you say you shot someone with a flare gun?

495
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:00,535
- What? - Who?

496
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,662
Don't put the phone...

497
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,767
Rudi?

498
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,862
Who's shooting? Al, who's shooting? ls someone shooting at you?

499
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:22,458
You'd better not hurt my boat,

500
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,304
Engine two is out.

501
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:27,870
Fourth and long, man. What do you wanna do?

502
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:34,552
- l think we need to pull a Panama. - A Panama. A Panama?!

503
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:37,274
- Panama? - You think? Really?

504
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:39,031
- Yeah. Really. - No Panama,

505
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:42,559
Somebody pick up... They're ignoring me. They're ignoring...

506
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:44,824
Everybody's ignoring me. Pick up the phone!

507
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,846
Take it. We're doing a Panama. We're doing a Panama!

508
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,414
- What's a Panama? - Navy thing.

509
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:51,161
- l didn't know you were in Panama. - Weren't. We were in Nicaragua.

510
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:54,431
- Then why do you call it a Panama? - We thought we were in Panama.

511
00:41:54,624 --> 00:41:56,991
No Panama,

512
00:41:57,696 --> 00:42:00,696
What are you looking for? Al!

513
00:42:11,424 --> 00:42:13,944
Al. Al, l'm really confused.

514
00:42:21,536 --> 00:42:23,576
How we doing, Al?

515
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:25,877
- Go help Dirk. - What do l do with this?

516
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,290
Just go!

517
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:29,177
Down.

518
00:42:32,128 --> 00:42:33,535
- Open the engine hatch. - Okay.

519
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:36,861
Let's go, Al.

520
00:42:41,568 --> 00:42:42,975
Got it.

521
00:42:44,224 --> 00:42:46,111
Here, light this.

522
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:49,719
- Aren't these the admiral's? - Just light it.

523
00:42:58,336 --> 00:43:00,027
What the...?

524
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:01,758
Whenever you're ready, Al.

525
00:43:01,951 --> 00:43:03,773
- Come on! - What are we doing?

526
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:07,032
- l don't think you should be doing that. - Okay. Drop it.

527
00:43:07,232 --> 00:43:09,337
- We're good. - Yeah?

528
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:10,943
- All right, hold on. - Hold on.

529
00:43:11,168 --> 00:43:12,542
Okay.

530
00:43:17,152 --> 00:43:18,362
Al!

531
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:28,190
Hey, l need a life jacket.

532
00:43:46,528 --> 00:43:48,055
Crap.

533
00:43:48,287 --> 00:43:50,196
He did a Panama.

534
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:52,249
He did a Panama.

535
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,542
Cool.

536
00:43:55,744 --> 00:43:58,395
- ls that how it worked the first time? - Well...

537
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,308
...it didn't really work the first time.

538
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:05,877
- l lost my hat. - Again?

539
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,225
Yeah.

540
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:19,775
Man, is Sandecker gonna be mad

541
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:22,138
when you tell him you lost the satellite phone.

542
00:44:22,336 --> 00:44:24,954
Not as mad as when Rudi tells him it was attached to the boat.

543
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:28,021
- Wait. Why me? - Because we're not going back.

544
00:44:28,224 --> 00:44:30,133
- Right, Dirk? - Nope. We're going to Asselar.

545
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:33,784
- No more Texas? - lronclad's on hold for a while, guys.

546
00:44:33,984 --> 00:44:36,537
Those soldiers weren't after us. They were after the doctors.

547
00:44:36,736 --> 00:44:39,703
l got a feeling whatever bug Eva's chasing, it must be a doozy.

548
00:44:39,904 --> 00:44:41,759
- We gotta get there first. - l'm going with you.

549
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:43,839
- Nope, you gotta tell Sandecker. - Hold on. Hold on.

550
00:44:44,032 --> 00:44:46,749
How am l gonna get across the border? l never took survival training.

551
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,048
- Consider this your course. - lt's kind of pass-fail,

552
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,709
which l always thought was easier.

553
00:44:50,943 --> 00:44:54,489
Look, Rudi. Lay up here till dark, then make your move. The border's not far.

554
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:55,964
- Okay. - All right.

555
00:44:57,376 --> 00:45:00,126
Al, you remember that time in Morocco?

556
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,386
Oh, yeah, when you made me ride that damn camel

557
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:06,879
- that bit my ass. - Yeah, that's the time.

558
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:09,493
Why?

559
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,314
God! What is the secret to this thing?

560
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:22,933
Just wrap it around your nugget.

561
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:27,195
- What part? Here? This? - Yeah.

562
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:31,133
Well, how come yours stays on?

563
00:45:31,744 --> 00:45:33,370
Maybe you got a small head.

564
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:37,845
l don't think so. Somebody would've told me.

565
00:46:01,664 --> 00:46:03,224
Thank you.

566
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:09,914
World Health Organization.

567
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:11,897
Hello?

568
00:46:12,256 --> 00:46:14,111
ls anyone here?

569
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:21,118
Frank.

570
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,387
Look at this.

571
00:46:37,984 --> 00:46:39,413
Anyone here?

572
00:46:45,695 --> 00:46:47,353
Hello?

573
00:46:51,776 --> 00:46:53,205
Hello?

574
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,687
Oh, my God.

575
00:48:22,911 --> 00:48:25,594
This well was filled in recently.

576
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:28,158
l think people here knew the water was making them sick.

577
00:48:28,351 --> 00:48:30,839
l still say we should let Oumar go down.

578
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:33,275
Oumar, you wouldn't mind going down that well, would you?

579
00:48:33,504 --> 00:48:34,911
- No, it's okay. l'll go down. - You see?

580
00:48:35,135 --> 00:48:36,858
Frank, l'll be fine.

581
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,756
Yeah, there you go.

582
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,398
All right, you're looking good. You're looking good.

583
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:56,057
- Give her a little more rope. - Okay.

584
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:00,636
Be careful, please.

585
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:03,381
Just take your time.

586
00:49:03,904 --> 00:49:04,886
Eva.

587
00:49:05,472 --> 00:49:06,650
Eva, hold on.

588
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,013
Eva. Hold on. We've got you.

589
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:11,286
- You got it? - lt's okay.

590
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:14,840
- Bring her up. - No, l'm fine.

591
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,796
Give me more rope.

592
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:26,231
Got it. l made it.

593
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:40,696
- Got water. - All right, great.

594
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:43,066
Get what we need, and let's get you out of there.

595
00:49:43,712 --> 00:49:46,298
Hey, looks like we've got company.

596
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,722
Don't go anywhere. l'll be right back.

597
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:51,129
Okay.

598
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:53,563
Hello there. l'm Dr. Hopper with the World Health Organization.

599
00:49:53,759 --> 00:49:56,509
- You have no authority to be here. - What are you doing?

600
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:59,038
Eva, get those... Oh, my God!

601
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:01,981
- Frank! - Charlie, please don't shoot me.

602
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:03,830
Charlie, don't...

603
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:32,414
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, do you hear that?

604
00:50:54,368 --> 00:50:56,124
- This is all of them? - Yes, sir.

605
00:50:57,536 --> 00:51:02,271
The UN knows that we're here. This is a United Nations-sanctioned mission.

606
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:07,033
Where's your colleague?

607
00:51:10,111 --> 00:51:11,966
No, no, no, no, no.

608
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:14,134
l mean, the woman.

609
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:19,001
She didn't come. She's ill.

610
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:25,077
This pistol, it belonged to General Sir Henry Watkins.

611
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,476
.455 caliber. Very rare.

612
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:31,352
Hard to find the rounds.

613
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:36,318
l have them made by Holland & Holland of London.

614
00:51:38,687 --> 00:51:42,516
Twenty-seven pounds each.

615
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,421
You should put the money to better use.

616
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:49,375
Like containing this plague.

617
00:52:04,607 --> 00:52:06,036
l will give you some advice.

618
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:10,267
Tell me where Dr. Rojas is.

619
00:52:11,071 --> 00:52:12,926
She's not here.

620
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:16,438
Have it your own way.

621
00:52:27,295 --> 00:52:31,670
Make it look like a horde of Tuareg swine just came through here.

622
00:52:32,447 --> 00:52:33,941
- And find the woman. - Yes, sir.

623
00:52:34,143 --> 00:52:35,353
She's here.

624
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,011
Somewhere.

625
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:11,766
You men, set up a perimeter.

626
00:53:11,967 --> 00:53:14,072
l want you to search the whole town.

627
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:18,072
- Hey, Salim, come over here. - Yes, sir.

628
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:48,314
Open up a few rounds just to be sure.

629
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:55,671
Hey.

630
00:54:45,663 --> 00:54:47,965
Al, little help here.

631
00:54:57,439 --> 00:54:59,195
Oh, man.

632
00:55:50,367 --> 00:55:52,374
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Eva.

633
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:58,333
Come on. You okay?

634
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:00,316
- Yeah. - Come on.

635
00:56:01,663 --> 00:56:03,419
We gotta go.

636
00:56:04,415 --> 00:56:06,837
Wait. Wait!

637
00:56:07,743 --> 00:56:09,401
Frank!

638
00:56:10,464 --> 00:56:11,871
Frank!

639
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:18,362
We're done here.

640
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:43,356
We're in Tuareg country now.

641
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:47,869
We're gonna drive north about three hours till we hit the flatlands.

642
00:56:48,063 --> 00:56:51,925
From there it should be a relatively easy drive to the Algerian border.

643
00:56:52,831 --> 00:56:54,554
Sorry.

644
00:56:55,647 --> 00:56:57,109
Eva.

645
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,761
Eva.

646
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:05,978
We'll get through, huh?

647
00:57:11,615 --> 00:57:13,371
- This way. - Please tell me what l am doing here.

648
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:17,015
Five men shot dead in cold blood. What do you think about that?

649
00:57:17,215 --> 00:57:19,451
Hardly my responsibility.

650
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:21,436
No, no, no, you sit, you sit.

651
00:57:21,631 --> 00:57:23,540
You are a very brave man.

652
00:57:23,743 --> 00:57:24,987
The only survivor.

653
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:27,452
Crawled all the way from Asselar to bring me the news.

654
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:30,494
- How very commendable. - Caught in a classic Tuareg ambush,

655
00:57:30,687 --> 00:57:32,542
- wouldn't you say? - Possibly.

656
00:57:32,735 --> 00:57:36,347
One problem. There were no Tuareg.

657
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:56,635
Why didn't you tell me the doctors had American military support?

658
00:57:56,831 --> 00:58:00,214
- Because they didn't. - The two unarmed men who did this...

659
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:05,053
...they were not amateurs, Yves. Nor were the ones on the boat.

660
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:08,116
- And they're the same men, l think. - They're treasure hunters, general.

661
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:09,912
Marine salvage, they call themselves.

662
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:14,071
- Hardly your military elite. - Don't underestimate them.

663
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,749
Watch out. And if you find them, bring them to me.

664
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:47,845
What is it?

665
00:58:51,398 --> 00:58:52,543
Get out of the Jeep.

666
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:55,205
Keep your hands up.

667
00:58:55,397 --> 00:58:57,372
Move slowly.

668
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:20,451
What?

669
00:59:32,422 --> 00:59:33,567
Three o'clock.

670
01:00:01,285 --> 01:00:02,529
Tuaregs!

671
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:07,036
Hi. How are you?

672
01:00:46,086 --> 01:00:48,737
Al, did you see that? No, hang on a minute.

673
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:10,756
Who are you...

674
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,572
...and why are you here?

675
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:16,414
We are enemies of Kazim.

676
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:19,521
You are American.

677
01:01:22,566 --> 01:01:23,646
ClA?

678
01:01:25,413 --> 01:01:27,169
No.

679
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:33,916
l'm a doctor from the World Health Organization.

680
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:38,112
l'm investigating the source of a disease.

681
01:01:45,798 --> 01:01:47,838
Come with me.

682
01:01:57,734 --> 01:02:00,101
This is the disease you are looking for?

683
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:06,272
l believe it is.

684
01:02:12,965 --> 01:02:16,827
All right. Ready to go, big D, big D.

685
01:02:45,574 --> 01:02:47,461
lt's not a plague.

686
01:02:47,654 --> 01:02:50,207
- What? - lt's not a plague. lt's a poison.

687
01:02:50,405 --> 01:02:52,194
There are toxins in the water, here and in Asselar.

688
01:02:52,390 --> 01:02:53,317
- Toxins? - Yes.

689
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:55,550
That's what's making these people sick.

690
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,652
Can you treat it?

691
01:03:00,774 --> 01:03:02,116
No.

692
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:07,998
- Admiral, what can l do for you? - What do you hear from Mali?

693
01:03:08,197 --> 01:03:11,546
- Beautiful country. - Oh, kiss my ass.

694
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,645
l hear about a couple of American boys and their fancy yacht

695
01:03:15,846 --> 01:03:18,235
getting in some trouble on the Niger.

696
01:03:18,437 --> 01:03:19,746
Does the agency have a presence there?

697
01:03:19,942 --> 01:03:21,829
No, it's strictly hands-off.

698
01:03:22,022 --> 01:03:23,331
- Carl. - What?

699
01:03:23,526 --> 01:03:25,315
l gotta get my boys out.

700
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,844
They're private citizens. Now, if they choose to go down there

701
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,339
and get themselves shot up over some sunken treasure,

702
01:03:30,565 --> 01:03:32,507
that is not a company problem.

703
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:34,945
- l'm not asking the company. - Yeah.

704
01:03:35,142 --> 01:03:36,800
You've got some nerve.

705
01:03:36,997 --> 01:03:38,404
Come down here compromising my cover,

706
01:03:38,597 --> 01:03:41,630
and now you're gonna ask me to risk my whole career over this nonsense?

707
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:44,961
Well, since you put it that way...

708
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:46,881
- ...yes, l am. - No, you're not,

709
01:03:47,078 --> 01:03:49,314
because l'm not gonna do it.

710
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:52,317
l'm not gonna do it.

711
01:03:53,702 --> 01:03:57,892
October 2 7th, 1 982.

712
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:02,467
- Yeah, l knew you'd bring that up. - And now l have.

713
01:04:10,245 --> 01:04:12,547
- lf l do this, we are even. - The slate's clean.

714
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,305
- lf l do this, we are even. - The slate's clean.

715
01:04:16,518 --> 01:04:18,657
l'll see what l can do.

716
01:04:20,037 --> 01:04:21,564
Always a pleasure, my friend.

717
01:04:24,677 --> 01:04:27,230
Benzine, heavy metals, nitrates,

718
01:04:27,429 --> 01:04:30,724
Basically, the water's toxic.

719
01:04:34,118 --> 01:04:35,841
l understand.

720
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:40,157
But Kazim's men followed your trail.

721
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:44,348
You must leave tomorrow at first light.

722
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:48,607
Modibo.

723
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:51,812
Eva found the same poison in the wells at Asselar.

724
01:04:52,006 --> 01:04:56,316
- lt's over 300 miles from here. - Africa will find a place for us.

725
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,851
Modibo...

726
01:04:59,493 --> 01:05:00,987
...we have to find the source.

727
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,913
That is for you.

728
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:05,477
My duty is here with my people.

729
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:12,092
We leave in the morning.

730
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:16,096
l've heard that my car pleases your eyes.

731
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:23,808
lt's a 1 936 Avions Voisin.

732
01:05:24,326 --> 01:05:26,017
Six cylinders, sleeve-valve engine.

733
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:29,149
Do you know there was only six of these ever made?

734
01:05:30,629 --> 01:05:33,728
- How the hell did you get it? - We borrowed it...

735
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:36,670
...from Kazim.

736
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:45,568
Bye. Thank you.

737
01:05:45,766 --> 01:05:48,035
Okay, ready? l'll do it. l'll do it.

738
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,874
Okay, here we go. Come on. New Al record right here.

739
01:06:22,885 --> 01:06:24,095
l got something you gotta see.

740
01:06:24,293 --> 01:06:25,667
- Yeah? - Yeah.

741
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:27,421
- All right, give me a minute. - Come on!

742
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,850
That is your Texas we're looking at, isn't it?

743
01:06:35,045 --> 01:06:36,768
- Sure the hell looks like it. - Yeah.

744
01:06:36,965 --> 01:06:39,070
- Sitting in the middle of the desert. - Yep.

745
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:42,205
Hey, l am not paying off the tequila on a picture, okay?

746
01:06:42,437 --> 01:06:45,536
Ship of the desert's a camel. lt's not an ironclad battleship.

747
01:06:45,765 --> 01:06:48,547
l mean, there is no way that that could get across the desert.

748
01:06:48,741 --> 01:06:51,588
At one time, much of this desert was lush, green farmland,

749
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:54,202
and there were rivers everywhere.

750
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,407
Now, the ironclad obviously came up this river

751
01:06:57,606 --> 01:07:01,316
and stopped at this structure, which is a fort? A castle? l don't know.

752
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:02,910
So the climate changed.

753
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,499
So let's say the water level dropped, and the boat became stranded.

754
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:07,677
Yeah, or sailed away.

755
01:07:07,877 --> 01:07:10,812
Or the land dried up, the soil turned to dust,

756
01:07:11,013 --> 01:07:12,540
the sands blew in,

757
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:16,319
and the ship is still buried to this day...

758
01:07:17,189 --> 01:07:20,156
- ...right here, next to the structure. - Okay, great.

759
01:07:20,389 --> 01:07:22,942
So all we have to do is wait for the river to fill up again

760
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:24,548
and sail the Texas home.

761
01:07:26,149 --> 01:07:27,611
- That's how it's spreading. - What is?

762
01:07:27,813 --> 01:07:28,761
The toxins.

763
01:07:28,965 --> 01:07:30,874
What, in the dried-up, nonexistent river?

764
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:35,136
No, no, no. The same river that was on the surface 1 50 years ago still exists.

765
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:37,155
lt's just beneath our feet now, sunk in the sand,

766
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,105
running along the rock strata.

767
01:07:39,302 --> 01:07:41,277
Now, the toxins are obviously leeching from their source

768
01:07:41,477 --> 01:07:43,266
into the underground river system.

769
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:46,625
- Spreading from well to well. - Exactly.

770
01:07:47,174 --> 01:07:51,036
So we find your Texas, we find the underground river.

771
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:55,067
We find the river, we find the source of the toxins.

772
01:08:00,966 --> 01:08:02,624
- Admiral-- - Not now.

773
01:08:23,589 --> 01:08:24,996
Rudi?

774
01:08:25,382 --> 01:08:26,658
Admiral.

775
01:08:29,253 --> 01:08:31,009
l have some bad news about your boat.

776
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:53,826
According to the cave painting, this is the place.

777
01:08:58,277 --> 01:09:02,106
You know, Al, if we were here 1 50 years ago,

778
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:04,612
we'd be swimming right now.

779
01:09:17,093 --> 01:09:18,303
Hey.

780
01:09:18,725 --> 01:09:20,700
Hey, you know how it is when you see someone

781
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:22,973
that you haven't seen since high school,

782
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,027
and they got some dead-end job,

783
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:27,392
and they're married to some woman that hates them,

784
01:09:27,749 --> 01:09:30,018
they got, like, three kids that thinks he's a joke?

785
01:09:30,213 --> 01:09:32,668
Wasn't there some point where he stood back and said,

786
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:35,291
''Bob, don't take that job.

787
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:38,657
Bob, don't marry that harpy,'' you know?

788
01:09:38,853 --> 01:09:40,315
Your point?

789
01:09:40,517 --> 01:09:43,583
Well, we're in the middle of a desert,

790
01:09:43,781 --> 01:09:46,301
looking for the source of a river pollutant,

791
01:09:46,501 --> 01:09:50,625
using as our map a cave drawing of a Civil War gunship,

792
01:09:50,822 --> 01:09:52,349
- which is also in the desert. - Right.

793
01:09:52,549 --> 01:09:54,556
So l was just wondering when we're gonna have to sit down

794
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:57,440
and reevaluate our decision-making paradigm.

795
01:09:57,829 --> 01:09:59,804
l don't know.

796
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,685
Working so far.

797
01:10:20,005 --> 01:10:21,728
- Hey, Al. - Yep?

798
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:23,780
- Let me see the scope. - Sure.

799
01:10:24,805 --> 01:10:27,358
- What do you see? - l don't know.

800
01:10:32,933 --> 01:10:34,908
lt looks like a solar energy plant.

801
01:10:35,525 --> 01:10:36,540
That's strange.

802
01:10:37,925 --> 01:10:40,314
There's a collecting tower...

803
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:44,158
...but no outgoing transmission lines.

804
01:10:47,557 --> 01:10:50,208
''Massarde Enterprises.''

805
01:10:50,405 --> 01:10:52,227
Massarde? Yves Massarde?

806
01:10:52,773 --> 01:10:55,839
Well, whoever it is, they've got heavy security.

807
01:11:03,077 --> 01:11:04,637
Let's check it out.

808
01:11:40,325 --> 01:11:41,503
Come on! Come on! Come on!

809
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:46,683
Come on, come on!

810
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,801
Al!

811
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:15,171
Come on, Eva, kick him. Let's go!

812
01:12:15,973 --> 01:12:17,948
One, two, three.

813
01:12:19,973 --> 01:12:21,402
l got you.

814
01:12:56,133 --> 01:12:57,595
- You okay? - Yes.

815
01:12:57,797 --> 01:12:59,553
- Nice job, doc. - Thank you.

816
01:12:59,749 --> 01:13:01,211
- How we doing, Al? - Great.

817
01:13:01,413 --> 01:13:03,104
Get in the hole.

818
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:35,226
- Admiral! - Not now, Rudi. l don't have time.

819
01:13:35,429 --> 01:13:38,331
Yes, sir, you do.

820
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:47,172
That-- That's not possible.

821
01:13:53,573 --> 01:13:57,599
Yellow Five, report to station three,

822
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:04,990
Loading procedure commencing, Extraction protocol complete,

823
01:14:12,421 --> 01:14:14,560
Please ensure all active materials

824
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:17,506
are securely stored, Thank you for your cooperation,

825
01:14:17,701 --> 01:14:19,676
- What the hell is this place? - Good question.

826
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:26,490
These barrels here are probably full of chemical waste.

827
01:14:27,621 --> 01:14:29,279
They're going in that chamber...

828
01:14:31,877 --> 01:14:34,048
...they're coming out the other side empty.

829
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:39,491
They're using the solar power to superheat and vaporize the toxins.

830
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:40,764
That's smart. Looks clean too.

831
01:14:40,805 --> 01:14:42,747
That's smart. Looks clean too.

832
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:45,408
What about those barrels?

833
01:15:29,604 --> 01:15:31,491
Hi. How are you?

834
01:15:37,413 --> 01:15:39,104
Oh, my God.

835
01:15:43,525 --> 01:15:46,721
Well, l think we found your source.

836
01:16:10,661 --> 01:16:12,636
Tuareg prisoners.

837
01:16:13,285 --> 01:16:16,100
These must be the soldiers captured from Modibo's village.

838
01:16:16,292 --> 01:16:17,950
He thought they were dead.

839
01:16:18,149 --> 01:16:20,964
This Massarde guy's really starting to piss me off.

840
01:16:21,157 --> 01:16:23,044
Well, it's time to call in the cavalry.

841
01:16:24,324 --> 01:16:25,633
Let's go.

842
01:16:27,685 --> 01:16:30,587
Well, Dr. Rojas, l do wish you had stayed in Lagos.

843
01:16:38,116 --> 01:16:39,425
So,,,

844
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:41,371
,,,got your report,

845
01:16:41,893 --> 01:16:43,387
Kind of dense, huh?

846
01:16:46,308 --> 01:16:48,413
Okay, my understanding is...

847
01:16:48,965 --> 01:16:52,413
...there's a problem with the water. Am l right?

848
01:16:52,645 --> 01:16:53,572
Rudi?

849
01:16:53,765 --> 01:16:56,034
The water in the Niger River is being poisoned.

850
01:16:56,389 --> 01:17:00,251
Right now, it's in Mali, but it's headed toward us fast.

851
01:17:00,452 --> 01:17:03,714
lf we don't do something, within one week it's gonna hit the Atlantic.

852
01:17:04,357 --> 01:17:07,139
And when that interacts with the salt water,

853
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:09,667
that growth rate is gonna explode.

854
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,573
The oxygen levels in the affected waters

855
01:17:12,773 --> 01:17:16,548
will decrease by 40 to 60 percent, killing all plant and animal life.

856
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,688
lf it gets to the ocean,

857
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,471
it's halfway to New York within six months.

858
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:23,611
Then there's nothing we can do.

859
01:17:26,853 --> 01:17:28,282
ls that all?

860
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:38,142
Do you have any independent confirmation?

861
01:17:38,629 --> 01:17:40,003
- Nope. - Because intervening

862
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,717
in a sovereign country, granted l'm only in the job a couple of months,

863
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:44,924
l'm pretty sure that's gonna be tough to get an okay for.

864
01:17:45,124 --> 01:17:47,393
- l need you to try. - Oh, l'm gonna look into this. l am.

865
01:17:47,589 --> 01:17:51,037
l'm gonna pass this on to the State Department, get their take on this.

866
01:17:51,236 --> 01:17:53,789
Okay, l think that's the best way to proceed.

867
01:17:53,989 --> 01:17:55,964
Thank you, gentlemen.

868
01:18:21,733 --> 01:18:23,140
Al.

869
01:18:25,349 --> 01:18:27,520
Where the hell are we?

870
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:30,941
l don't know.

871
01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:32,731
Where's Eva?

872
01:18:33,061 --> 01:18:36,192
So the two Americans, they're on their way, general.

873
01:18:37,605 --> 01:18:39,645
The doctor? Well...

874
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:42,561
l'm afraid there has been an incident, general.

875
01:18:42,757 --> 01:18:45,986
An exchange of gunfire, most unfortunate.

876
01:18:47,813 --> 01:18:50,115
She-- She's dead.

877
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:54,083
Yes, general. l'm sorry, l--

878
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:04,153
You know, Dr. Rojas, you're lucky l'm such a gentleman.

879
01:19:04,933 --> 01:19:09,635
Enabling program, phase two, Please ensure all active materials,,,

880
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,836
Who else knows you're here?

881
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:21,631
This facility is a miracle of modern science.

882
01:19:21,828 --> 01:19:23,551
State-of-the-art technology.

883
01:19:23,748 --> 01:19:25,853
Solar energy harnessed to destroy the world's contaminants.

884
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,679
Not such a bad idea after all.

885
01:19:27,877 --> 01:19:29,884
- lt's a toxic-waste dump. - lt's not so simple.

886
01:19:30,085 --> 01:19:32,932
You see, all new technology has enemies.

887
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:35,264
Sandstorms, for example, they chip away at the mirrors.

888
01:19:35,461 --> 01:19:38,810
Productivity falls, and the waste needs to be stored underground.

889
01:19:39,045 --> 01:19:44,162
So we have developed new laminate coating to protect the mirrors.

890
01:19:44,356 --> 01:19:48,993
And with this new approach, our problems should now be in the past.

891
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:51,164
You're poisoning a river system underground.

892
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,395
lt's spreading across Western Africa.

893
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,129
You're wrong. That's impossible.

894
01:20:01,092 --> 01:20:02,652
Securing burn chamber,

895
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,507
Who else knows you're here?

896
01:20:05,701 --> 01:20:07,010
The Nigerian government.

897
01:20:07,685 --> 01:20:08,994
The WHO.

898
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:16,954
No one else knows you're here, do they?

899
01:20:20,613 --> 01:20:22,882
lnitiate system safety check,

900
01:20:29,509 --> 01:20:31,200
What are you doing?

901
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,058
l got it.

902
01:20:37,637 --> 01:20:38,652
Die.

903
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:43,939
Live.

904
01:20:48,453 --> 01:20:49,882
You got it?

905
01:20:52,901 --> 01:20:54,461
Clear?

906
01:20:55,077 --> 01:20:56,124
Got it.

907
01:21:02,628 --> 01:21:04,832
Ready? One, two, three.

908
01:21:05,797 --> 01:21:07,520
One, two, three.

909
01:21:16,676 --> 01:21:19,065
Wait. Not good. Not good. New plan!

910
01:21:19,268 --> 01:21:20,828
- l like it. - No!

911
01:21:47,013 --> 01:21:48,573
Well...

912
01:21:49,924 --> 01:21:52,990
- ...that's a new one. - Yeah.

913
01:21:53,893 --> 01:21:56,282
We're home free now.

914
01:21:59,684 --> 01:22:00,731
Sweet, sweet, sweet

915
01:22:00,932 --> 01:22:03,747
Run fast, she don't But she swims real well

916
01:22:03,941 --> 01:22:06,624
Racing through the water With a swish of her tail

917
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,603
She's my little mermaid

918
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,049
Massarde, your packages have not arrived,

919
01:22:21,252 --> 01:22:22,626
Apparently they were lost in the desert,

920
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:25,635
- Yes, l heard. - Tell me, Yves, the doctor?

921
01:22:25,829 --> 01:22:27,968
- Promise me she's dead. - Oh, yes, yes.

922
01:22:28,164 --> 01:22:30,619
Be a shame to fall out over a woman, no?

923
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,130
General, l've come here to tell you

924
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:34,429
that l think we should suspend waste shipments to the plant

925
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:35,873
- for the time being. - Nonsense.

926
01:22:36,068 --> 01:22:39,451
The borders are all closed. The sick are either quarantined or dead.

927
01:22:39,652 --> 01:22:43,067
l did not expend all these resources only to see my profits shrink.

928
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:44,763
Yes, but l have good reasons to believe

929
01:22:44,996 --> 01:22:46,719
the toxins are in the Niger River.

930
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:50,265
Then the problem is no longer ours, but our neighbors' downstream.

931
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,994
They will soon find out. The Americans did.

932
01:22:52,197 --> 01:22:56,092
Okay, Yves, as you please. Close the plant.

933
01:22:56,293 --> 01:22:59,708
But your payments to me will continue.

934
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:02,080
Okay?

935
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:05,247
Don't worry. lt's Africa.

936
01:23:05,445 --> 01:23:08,380
Nobody cares about Africa.

937
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:13,568
This photo was taken 24 hours ago.

938
01:23:14,308 --> 01:23:16,796
Normally, Kazim likes to keep his tanks where he can see them,

939
01:23:17,028 --> 01:23:18,915
in case the people get frisky.

940
01:23:19,141 --> 01:23:21,956
This one, taken four hours ago,

941
01:23:22,148 --> 01:23:24,995
shows the tanks mobilizing north to the desert.

942
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:28,484
And my guess, and intelligence supports this,

943
01:23:28,677 --> 01:23:31,972
- they're looking for your boys. - Well, we'll have to find them first.

944
01:23:32,165 --> 01:23:33,474
We already did.

945
01:23:33,668 --> 01:23:35,970
Yesterday they showed up in a Tuareg village

946
01:23:36,165 --> 01:23:39,743
- about 200 miles northwest of Gao. - That's within range.

947
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,849
You could get choppers in there if you flew at night.

948
01:23:42,052 --> 01:23:44,921
- But your boys already left. - Left? Where? Going where?

949
01:23:45,124 --> 01:23:48,288
Well, based on their behavior so far...

950
01:23:49,957 --> 01:23:51,201
...l have no idea.

951
01:25:10,788 --> 01:25:13,854
- Dirk. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. l see it.

952
01:25:19,652 --> 01:25:22,816
Well, you don't see that every day.

953
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:39,068
l bet you 1 00 there's a toolkit in there.

954
01:25:39,268 --> 01:25:43,840
l don't wanna rain on your crazy parade, buddy,

955
01:25:44,036 --> 01:25:46,971
but l don't think we can fix this thing.

956
01:26:23,236 --> 01:26:25,756
- A little more to the left, Al. - Left.

957
01:26:28,261 --> 01:26:32,058
Yeah, that's it, right there. Right there. We're dialed in, baby.

958
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,547
- Hello. - Hey, admiral.

959
01:26:55,749 --> 01:26:57,123
- Dirk? - How you doing?

960
01:26:57,316 --> 01:26:59,934
Oh, Dirk, thank God, Where the hell are you?

961
01:27:00,164 --> 01:27:03,939
Well, that's a damn good question. Listen, l've got some bad news.

962
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:06,337
Your buddy, Yves Massarde, he's got an industrial factory

963
01:27:06,532 --> 01:27:08,703
that's dumping deadly toxins into the Niger.

964
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,933
- Massarde? Oh, Christ. - l think he's got Eva at his plant.

965
01:27:12,132 --> 01:27:14,718
Which hopefully is gonna be our next stop.

966
01:27:14,916 --> 01:27:18,560
Well, l've got something for you. Rudi's got chemistry here

967
01:27:18,756 --> 01:27:22,236
that says if that leak's not shut down ASAP, it's gonna reach the ocean,

968
01:27:22,436 --> 01:27:26,211
When it does, that'll be ground zero for the Atlantic's version of Chernobyl.

969
01:27:26,404 --> 01:27:27,833
- l get it. - l've got something more,

970
01:27:28,036 --> 01:27:30,141
l've got word that Kazim has mobilized his troops

971
01:27:30,372 --> 01:27:31,834
and is heading across the desert.

972
01:27:32,068 --> 01:27:34,207
We could use some serious muscle here, admiral.

973
01:27:34,436 --> 01:27:36,640
Well, you're not gonna get it. Not fast enough.

974
01:27:36,836 --> 01:27:39,203
l'm getting the D.C. two-step bigtime.

975
01:27:39,428 --> 01:27:41,403
- And this has to be done-- - Yesterday. l got it.

976
01:27:41,604 --> 01:27:43,164
Hey!

977
01:27:43,844 --> 01:27:45,470
- Dirk? - Yeah?

978
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:47,578
l can't ask you boys to go this alone.

979
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:49,984
Well, that's the great part, sir.

980
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,806
You know you never have to.

981
01:28:05,892 --> 01:28:08,161
There is no more time, Modibo.

982
01:28:08,356 --> 01:28:11,585
Now is your chance to hit Kazim where it really hurts.

983
01:28:11,972 --> 01:28:14,274
We only have small arms.

984
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:16,989
They are no use against concrete and heavy machine guns.

985
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:19,420
But you have power in numbers.

986
01:28:19,621 --> 01:28:22,523
We attack when he does not expect it. We have to try.

987
01:28:22,724 --> 01:28:26,368
Do you know what Kazim's war with us has cost my people in lives?

988
01:28:26,564 --> 01:28:30,110
- ln the poverty and disease it causes? - Then come with us.

989
01:28:30,404 --> 01:28:31,516
And let's finish it.

990
01:28:34,404 --> 01:28:38,659
l cannot afford to have my men slaughtered in a full-frontal attack.

991
01:28:38,852 --> 01:28:41,535
We cannot go with you.

992
01:28:41,732 --> 01:28:43,619
l understand.

993
01:28:45,732 --> 01:28:47,871
All right, we got another idea.

994
01:28:52,484 --> 01:28:54,720
Can l borrow your car?

995
01:29:12,804 --> 01:29:14,495
Kazim. Kazim!

996
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,842
Had you going there, didn't we?

997
01:29:27,172 --> 01:29:28,187
You?

998
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,114
Hi. How are you?

999
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:42,649
Zakara, go get the doctor.

1000
01:29:47,204 --> 01:29:48,698
Move on ahead. Let's go.

1001
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:57,658
- Where is everybody? - l don't know, corporate retreat?

1002
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:00,227
Go.

1003
01:30:00,996 --> 01:30:04,891
Something's wrong here, Al. This place is completely deserted.

1004
01:30:14,116 --> 01:30:15,774
Modibo.

1005
01:30:24,004 --> 01:30:24,952
Nobody home.

1006
01:30:25,796 --> 01:30:27,225
- Hey, Al? - Yeah.

1007
01:30:27,428 --> 01:30:30,014
What would you do if you were about to be exposed as the worst polluter

1008
01:30:30,212 --> 01:30:31,488
of modern times?

1009
01:30:31,684 --> 01:30:33,211
l don't know. Run for president?

1010
01:30:33,412 --> 01:30:35,834
- You'd hide the evidence, right? - Yeah, right.

1011
01:30:36,036 --> 01:30:37,443
How?

1012
01:30:37,636 --> 01:30:39,741
How do you hide 50 tons of industrial waste

1013
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,566
without anybody noticing it?

1014
01:30:43,556 --> 01:30:45,018
You don't.

1015
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:50,816
- He's gonna blow the place, Al. - That's not exactly subtle.

1016
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,834
That's what he's gonna do.

1017
01:30:53,284 --> 01:30:55,804
That's why it's abandoned. Make it look like an industrial accident,

1018
01:30:56,003 --> 01:30:57,410
- and he walks. - That's a good idea.

1019
01:30:57,604 --> 01:30:59,644
- No, not really. - Why?

1020
01:30:59,843 --> 01:31:01,534
The toxins would be sealed underground,

1021
01:31:01,732 --> 01:31:04,252
and there would be no way to contain them, Al.

1022
01:31:04,452 --> 01:31:07,681
Look, to bring this place down, he'd need 20 or 30 military-grade devices,

1023
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:10,144
all wired for simultaneous detonation.

1024
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:14,202
lt would never look like an accident. Unless one centrally placed device

1025
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:18,113
diverted all the plant's stored energy into one massive explosion.

1026
01:31:18,308 --> 01:31:19,835
- Which would look like an accident. - Yes.

1027
01:31:20,068 --> 01:31:21,759
Well, we gotta get that bomb, Al.

1028
01:31:21,956 --> 01:31:24,323
No, l'll find the bomb, you get the girl.

1029
01:31:25,284 --> 01:31:26,232
Deal.

1030
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:42,046
That's it.

1031
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:49,663
Got it. Bomb in a barrel.

1032
01:32:05,475 --> 01:32:06,402
Come on.

1033
01:32:24,548 --> 01:32:27,395
Get in. Get us out of here. Now!

1034
01:32:27,588 --> 01:32:29,082
Come on, let's go!

1035
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:46,177
- Eva. Out, out, out! - Don't shoot!

1036
01:32:47,588 --> 01:32:50,338
- Back off. Back off! Move! - Easy.

1037
01:32:50,564 --> 01:32:52,506
l apologize, Mr. Pitt.

1038
01:32:53,316 --> 01:32:55,869
- This is not what it appears. - Did l miss something?

1039
01:32:56,516 --> 01:32:58,305
l've seen your toxic dump.

1040
01:32:58,787 --> 01:33:02,399
l've seen the sick Tuareg women and kids, and l saw the dead in Asselar.

1041
01:33:02,596 --> 01:33:04,090
- l leave something out? - Dirk!

1042
01:33:07,204 --> 01:33:09,593
Get this thing out of here, quick! Stay here and don't move!

1043
01:33:37,092 --> 01:33:38,040
Stop!

1044
01:33:39,236 --> 01:33:40,698
Eva!

1045
01:33:41,252 --> 01:33:44,318
Take us up 1 ,000 meters and circle the plant.

1046
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:01,209
Remote system activated,

1047
01:34:01,443 --> 01:34:04,410

Come on. Come on.

Commence incineration burn,

1052

01:37:25,348 --> 01:37:27,519

1056
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:32,993
Thank you, and have a nice da--

1057
01:37:33,795 --> 01:37:35,551
Get us out of here, quick.

1058
01:37:38,884 --> 01:37:40,193
Eva.

1059
01:37:41,699 --> 01:37:44,001
How many times am l gonna have to save your ass?

1060
01:37:44,196 --> 01:37:46,847
Well, in case you didn't notice, l actually saved yours.

1061
01:37:47,043 --> 01:37:48,058
l wasn't in any danger.

1062
01:37:48,259 --> 01:37:50,845
- Oh, no? - No, l'd have thought of something.

1063
01:37:51,043 --> 01:37:52,155
Come here.

1064
01:37:54,179 --> 01:37:56,001
We gotta go.

1065
01:38:09,156 --> 01:38:11,131
Hey, what's with the costumes?

1066
01:38:12,451 --> 01:38:14,240
Uniforms? lt's his idea.

1067
01:38:14,979 --> 01:38:18,110
Hey, by the way, with this plan of yours, do we have enough gas?

1068
01:38:18,308 --> 01:38:20,697
Oh, stop being so negative, Al.

1069
01:38:40,836 --> 01:38:42,745
- lt's coming around on our 6. - Yeah.

1070
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:48,409
lt's Kazim. Hey, maybe he wants his car back.

1071
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,588
Al, did you bring any of the explosives from Massarde's?

1072
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,030
- Couldn't find them. - Al.

1073
01:39:20,227 --> 01:39:21,307
- l didn't have time. - Al!

1074
01:39:21,539 --> 01:39:22,913
Of course l brought the explosives!

1075
01:39:23,107 --> 01:39:25,627
Eva, l hope you don't throw like a girl.

1076
01:39:39,427 --> 01:39:40,889
He's coming around.

1077
01:39:51,012 --> 01:39:52,954
Al, l need a door right now!

1078
01:40:05,987 --> 01:40:07,678
Oh, my hat!

1079
01:40:09,156 --> 01:40:10,432
Damn it!

1080
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:20,633
Okay, here's the plan.

1081
01:40:20,868 --> 01:40:23,650
Eva, get in the back seat behind me. Go!

1082
01:40:23,843 --> 01:40:24,770
- Al? - Yeah.

1083
01:40:24,964 --> 01:40:27,103
- Give her that bag of explosives. - Gotcha!

1084
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:28,860
All right, hold on!

1085
01:40:30,755 --> 01:40:31,682
Yeah.

1086
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:37,945
Eva, l need you to throw a bundle of the dynamite into that hillside

1087
01:40:38,147 --> 01:40:39,521
every time l say. Comprende?

1088
01:40:39,716 --> 01:40:40,861
- Yeah. - All right.

1089
01:40:42,852 --> 01:40:43,932
l'm good!

1090
01:40:47,843 --> 01:40:49,053
Now!

1091
01:40:55,427 --> 01:40:58,045
Get us out. Move. Move!

1092
01:41:01,348 --> 01:41:03,770
- Dirk, we need cover! - l'm working on it!

1093
01:41:20,963 --> 01:41:23,352
Oh, my God.

1094
01:41:33,699 --> 01:41:35,870
Come on, Eva. Let's go, let's go.

1095
01:41:36,835 --> 01:41:38,013
Come on!

1096
01:41:43,043 --> 01:41:44,636
Move, move!

1097
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:52,636
Eva, help me dig. Come on, let's go, let's go!

1098
01:41:56,803 --> 01:41:57,915
- How we looking, Al? - Great.

1099
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:01,217
Dig faster!

1100
01:42:01,988 --> 01:42:03,068
Need a little help, Al.

1101
01:42:10,883 --> 01:42:11,930
Go.

1102
01:42:16,771 --> 01:42:17,818
- Al? - Yeah.

1103
01:42:18,019 --> 01:42:20,572
You didn't see any extra fuel tanks on that bird, did you?

1104
01:42:20,771 --> 01:42:22,626
- No, l didn't see any. - That means he only has

1105
01:42:22,819 --> 01:42:24,248
20 to 30 minutes left of flight time.

1106
01:42:24,451 --> 01:42:27,834
These walls are about 2 feet thick with a double-steel coating,

1107
01:42:28,067 --> 01:42:32,191
so there's no way his bullets can get to us. We just sit tight, wait him out.

1108
01:42:32,387 --> 01:42:33,499
Eva, down!

1109
01:42:40,515 --> 01:42:42,686
- Say, Dirk? - Yeah.

1110
01:42:43,235 --> 01:42:45,723
You wanna talk me through that again?

1111
01:42:45,923 --> 01:42:48,705
- Armor-piercing rounds. - Yeah.

1112
01:42:49,155 --> 01:42:50,781
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

1113
01:42:51,459 --> 01:42:52,386
l'm fine.

1114
01:43:06,787 --> 01:43:08,194
Hey, Al.

1115
01:43:08,387 --> 01:43:09,729
- No, Dirk. - Oh, yeah.

1116
01:43:09,923 --> 01:43:11,199
No, it'll never work.

1117
01:43:11,395 --> 01:43:13,850
- Why not? - lt's 1 50 years old.

1118
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:15,327
But, Al, it's hardly ever been used.

1119
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:18,392
- lt'll probably blow us to bits! - Well, then at least we'll die fighting.

1120
01:43:18,595 --> 01:43:20,897
- Yeah, that's comforting. - We need to open that gun port.

1121
01:43:21,091 --> 01:43:22,335
What the hell are we doing, guys?

1122
01:43:26,851 --> 01:43:28,574
- l've gotta go outside. - All right, go.

1123
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:41,787
Civil War piece of--

1124
01:43:45,891 --> 01:43:47,200
That's it, Al.

1125
01:44:02,275 --> 01:44:03,737
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

1126
01:44:04,643 --> 01:44:06,170
Next time, you go.

1127
01:44:06,403 --> 01:44:07,832
- What the hell took you so long? - What?

1128
01:44:08,067 --> 01:44:09,343
- Hey, guys. - l stopped for coffee.

1129
01:44:09,539 --> 01:44:10,946
- Get a receipt? - Yeah, l got a receipt.

1130
01:44:11,171 --> 01:44:12,764
- l got you one too. - You're the best, Al.

1131
01:44:12,963 --> 01:44:15,451
You know what? l'll even get you the money from Sandecker.

1132
01:44:15,651 --> 01:44:17,506
- Guys! - What?

1133
01:44:20,483 --> 01:44:21,530
Oh, great.

1134
01:44:22,627 --> 01:44:23,805
Now we're really in trouble.

1135
01:44:24,835 --> 01:44:26,329
- lncoming! - Down!

1136
01:44:33,603 --> 01:44:34,813
Okay.

1137
01:44:35,139 --> 01:44:37,081
lf we bring down Kazim, the army will surrender.

1138
01:44:37,315 --> 01:44:38,908
- Cut the head off the snake-- - Body dies.

1139
01:44:39,139 --> 01:44:41,408
Exactly. We're gonna need cannonball, powder and fuses.

1140
01:44:41,603 --> 01:44:44,156
- l'll get the cannonball. - Eva, l need you to find the fuses.

1141
01:44:44,355 --> 01:44:45,664
They're gonna be in a box this size.

1142
01:44:45,859 --> 01:44:47,998
They look something like carrot sticks. Go.

1143
01:45:14,051 --> 01:45:15,480
- 1 50 yards! - How you feeling, Al?

1144
01:45:15,715 --> 01:45:16,959
- l got them! - Good, good, good.

1145
01:45:18,051 --> 01:45:19,196
lncoming!

1146
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:43,224
Jefferson Davis had how many samples made?

1147
01:45:45,987 --> 01:45:47,994
- Let's get that cannon out the porthole. - Yeah.

1148
01:45:49,283 --> 01:45:51,072
On the count of three, we're gonna pull. Ready, Al?

1149
01:45:51,267 --> 01:45:52,860
- Ready. - One, two, three.

1150
01:46:05,251 --> 01:46:06,625
- Yeah! - That's it!

1151
01:46:12,387 --> 01:46:13,947
- Bring me up 30 degrees, Al. - Yeah.

1152
01:46:17,475 --> 01:46:18,784
Got it.

1153
01:46:40,643 --> 01:46:43,196
l'm so tired of being shot at!

1154
01:46:43,459 --> 01:46:46,394
Hold your positions. Secure the area. l will finish this.

1155
01:47:13,283 --> 01:47:14,265
Go! Go!

1156
01:47:32,963 --> 01:47:34,010
No! Get it now!

1157
01:47:35,011 --> 01:47:36,440
Get it out!

1158
01:47:45,731 --> 01:47:46,713
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1159
01:47:50,787 --> 01:47:52,031
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1160
01:47:52,227 --> 01:47:54,114
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1161
01:47:54,947 --> 01:47:56,223
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1162
01:48:10,979 --> 01:48:12,735
Look, look, look, look, look.

1163
01:48:17,602 --> 01:48:19,544
Looks like you killed the snake.

1164
01:48:20,867 --> 01:48:21,794
There's no way that

1165
01:48:22,019 --> 01:48:24,866
- that should've worked, right? - That should've worked.

1166
01:49:22,115 --> 01:49:23,642
- Yeah! - Yeah!

1167
01:49:32,291 --> 01:49:34,113
Yeah!

1168
01:49:39,714 --> 01:49:44,635
You know, from our point of view, the great thing is, we capped the plant.

1169
01:49:44,835 --> 01:49:46,144
The river's safe.

1170
01:49:46,339 --> 01:49:49,022
And l also understand the WHO is administering

1171
01:49:49,219 --> 01:49:53,343
an antitoxin in the villages formulated from Dr. Rojas' samples.

1172
01:49:53,539 --> 01:49:55,775
- Better late than never. - Absolutely.

1173
01:49:56,003 --> 01:50:00,891
So l trust your work on the Texas is going well?

1174
01:50:01,123 --> 01:50:02,978
Giordino's on the job, making sure everything

1175
01:50:03,171 --> 01:50:04,894
gets where it's supposed to go,

1176
01:50:05,091 --> 01:50:08,571
- All right! - Say, probably not true,

1177
01:50:08,771 --> 01:50:13,375
but did l hear a rumor there's some American gold onboard, on the Texas?

1178
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:15,993
Really? Be nice if it were true.

1179
01:50:16,194 --> 01:50:19,577
No. l can assure you, there's no gold there belonging to the U.S.

1180
01:50:21,539 --> 01:50:23,928
Admiral, the administration was highly impressed

1181
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:27,327
with the way you expedited all the red tape down here.

1182
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:29,921
- They'd like to fold NUMA into-- - No, thanks.

1183
01:50:30,115 --> 01:50:32,254
l'll never work in government again.

1184
01:50:32,451 --> 01:50:34,840
Which is exactly what they said you'd say.

1185
01:50:35,555 --> 01:50:38,457
Look, they're offering full funding in exchange for

1186
01:50:38,659 --> 01:50:40,928
the occasional side job for the good guys.

1187
01:50:41,123 --> 01:50:44,189
- Who decides who the good guys are? - You only do the jobs you want.

1188
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:50,337
- l need a new yacht. - You got it.

1189
01:50:51,331 --> 01:50:53,054
- And Rudi needs new computers. - No, no, no.

1190
01:50:53,251 --> 01:50:54,625
Done.

1191
01:50:59,490 --> 01:51:01,345
There's one more thing.

1192
01:51:11,907 --> 01:51:14,525
Negligence is a gray area of the law, Yves.

1193
01:51:14,723 --> 01:51:17,789
lf the right people are approached and handled in the right manner,

1194
01:51:17,986 --> 01:51:20,604
l think we avoid prosecution completely.

1195
01:51:41,955 --> 01:51:46,232
Not bad, eh? You, me, the bay of Monterey.

1196
01:51:49,314 --> 01:51:50,688
You know, l was thinking.

1197
01:51:51,363 --> 01:51:53,599
Remember that day in the desert?

1198
01:51:53,795 --> 01:51:56,184
With the car, dynamite,

1199
01:51:56,386 --> 01:51:58,972
Kazim's chasing us in the helicopter?

1200
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:01,057
Yeah?

1201
01:52:01,251 --> 01:52:05,080
There's something l wanted to say to you that l never got a chance to.

1202
01:52:05,634 --> 01:52:07,128
What's that?

1203
01:52:10,403 --> 01:52:11,832
You do throw like a girl.

1204
01:52:13,603 --> 01:52:15,675
Hey! You do!
