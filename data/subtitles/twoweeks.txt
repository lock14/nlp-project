Testing, testing, One, two, One, two,



Okay, that's good, Ready, Mom?



Okay, how do you want me to sit?



Anyway you want,
I'm just glad you're finally doing this,



All right, Go ahead, Start,



Great, So, why...



You're just gonna ask me questions, right?



- Hence the "why."
- All right,



I guess I better be careful answering
if this is gonna be how you remember me,



Mr. Bergman?



Mr. Bergman?



Your coffee.



Oh, right.



Thanks.



Is it okay?



You'd hardly know it was instant.



- Hey.
- Hey.



When are the boys coming?



Barry's flying the redeye tonight,



and Matthew's driving,
so I guess two days.



And he's not alone.



Welcome to
Wilmington International Airport,



Oh, great.



For your security, do not leave...



How's she doing?



Sick. In pain. She nods off a lot.



You better start reading.



- There's an instruction manual?
- You're gonna wanna read it.



Well, just too bad nobody ever comes back
and tells these guys if they got it right.



That's me.



Holy shit!



Well, if we study the literature,
maybe we can grow from this experience.



Absolutely. Yeah.
I own the whole Good Tragedy series.



Enjoy your Parasitic Infection,



Making the Most of Incest,
that was a good one.



I especially enjoyed
Congratulations! Your Child's an Addict,



- Will you just read it?
- Give me a break, Em.



- This whole thing sucks.
- Yeah, it does.



And I've been down here
with Mom and Jim



all by myself all week watching it happen.



And I don't have anyone else to talk to,
and so I went to a bookstore.



Sorry.



Yeah, I know
you've been working really hard, okay?



And I will read the book.



Okay.



- They must have been happy to see you.
- Yeah, they are.



I mean, there's only the two of them,
and they really need the help.



No, I meant the bookstore.



Fuck you, Keith.



This is News 6 at 11:00,



Southeastern North Carolina's
most watched 11:00 newscast,



Another missing persons case tonight
with a Blaine County connection,



Mom? Keith's here.



- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.



Glad you could come.



I had to get a few things settled.
Take care of a little business, remember?



Yes, I remember.



You're my oldest son,



the one who called me
every day this week.



- Yeah, I was just...
- I'm dying, not senile.



- Yes, Mother.
- Don't "Yes, Mother" me.



Hand me the clicker.



Thanks.



All right.



Go get settled.



Why did you fire your first oncologist?



You wanna know that for posterity?



I'm a trained film professional,



I'll ask the questions,
you answer them, okay?



Well,
when I asked him how I was gonna die,



he said my intestines would clog up
and I'd puke myself to death,



Which turns out to be true,



But I figured, for $275 a visit,



I deserved a little better
bedside manner than that,



I'll be out
for the 9:30 conference call this morning,



but I'll be available on my cell.



Leave the "B" calls on voicemail.



Tell Swisher
I need her Cisco report by 3:30,



that's 3:30 p.m. my time, by e-mail,



and I'll call you if I think of anything else.



I'll be back as soon as I can. Later.



You forgot to tell them
how to wipe their asses.



So, is it front to back or back to front?



Either way is fine.
I like employees to have a little autonomy.



Do Mom and Jim have DSL?



- No.
- No.



Well, listen, I'll stay as long as I can,
but I'm really busy.



What time is it?



On the West Coast, it's 5:45 a.m.
Up and at 'em, tiger.



Thanks for waking me.



- You see Mom?
- Not yet.



- In that case, thanks for waking me first.
- I'll see her.



I'll see her. I'm just waiting,
you know, to see if she feels up to it.



If who feels up to it?



Keith, come on,
you know I hate all that stuff.



That's what being here is all about,



blood, IVs,



puking.



Yeah.



Listen, they're playing your song.



A little help here!



Let's walk to the bathroom.



- I'm so sorry.
- Here. No, stop it.



- Hi, Barry.
- Mom.



- Thanks for coming.
- Wouldn't miss it.



- Hey, Barry.
- Hey, Em.



Can you clean up the bed?



Sure.



My cowboy sheets.



Awesome.



- How's it going?
- Almost done.



- You set here?
- Sure.



Keith, she's puking up shit.



Yeah.



Look, the honest to God truth,
I'm down here because my mother's dying.



I want you to do this for her.



Yeah, it's like her last wish,
something she never had.



Yeah, she really wants
high-speed Internet access.



No good. She'll be dead by then.
Is there some kind of rush fee I can pay?



Oh, this whole dying-mother thing
really motivates people.



- It's too bad you can only use it once.
- Do you think?



Here you go.



- What's this?
- A cheat sheet from the hospice.



"The stages of dying."



They're coming tomorrow.
We have to be ready.



Haven't you seen the bumper stickers,
"One day at a time"?



That's my philosophy.



You Hollywood guys,
always in and out of rehab.



You make me sick.
What is it, booze again?



It may be AA, but it's also Zen.



Be in the moment.



Nothing happens until it happens.



I can't affect the future,
so I choose not to worry about it.



- That's called denial.
- Exactly.



In LA we call it Zen.



Kind of a mystical, far-Eastern denial.
You know, alcoholics can be like that.



- Well, I'm not an alcoholic.
- Well, not yet.



I know it's hard, just listen.



"Death is a natural process.
It is normal to feel emotional."



Bullshit.



When it's my turn,



they're gonna have to carry me out
kicking and screaming.



- Denial.
- Total.



- No.
- You said that I would have the table...



I said you could have the car,
not the dining room table.



It's an heirloom.



What am I gonna eat on?



- Mom, none of us really want the...
- Hush, hush, hush, hush.



What about the armoire?



We bought that together.



Give it to Emily.



- All right, then I get to keep the table?
- Done.



- Fine.
- Write that down.



I just wanna make sure
you all get your fair share.



What's next?



So, I read about a new clinical trial
on the Web yesterday.



Now, I know it's a long shot,
but I e-mailed them.



And I thought maybe we'll get a hit
before hospice comes.



Keith.



Then I got into this chat group
that reviews local hospices,



so I know which nurses to look out for.



- Then...
- Keith.



Honey, you can't problem-solve your way
out of this one.



Well, I was just doing what I can.



- It's kind of a...
- Zen thing.



I know, Emily told me.



Okay.



Tell me the story of my birth,



What story?



The one you tell me every year
when you call me on my birthday,



- I don't,
- Yeah, you do,



I do? How boring,



Okay,



Well, you were my first baby
and you had a very big head,



which is not a good combo,



It was before Lamaze,



and so they just
put me in a room by myself,



and let me writhe there
until they thought I was ready,



And then they gave me a total block,
not an epidural or anything,



so I couldn't move my arms and legs
and barely knew where I was,



And they tied down my hands,
and then two big nurses pushed on me,



I didn't get to push
or be involved in any way,



And then, all of a sudden,
I wasn't pregnant anymore,



and I was back in the room
and your father was there,



and I started screaming,
"Where's my baby? Where's my baby?"



And so, then the nurses brought you in
so I could see you,



and then I started to cry
and my nose was running,



because you were the ugliest baby
I had ever seen,



So ugly,



Yeah, but I got better looking, right?



Jesus.



What time is it?



Oh, God, it's 6:00.



Forgot to change watch.



Hospice is here.



Best family reunion ever, eh, Bar?



I'm very pleased that we have
Carol available to work with you.



Oh, she's good. Very, very good.



- She was Gilda Radner's hospice nurse.
- Really?



How did that turn out for her?



In the end?



- Who?
- Gilda.



She died.



I see.



So, how long do you think
this process will take?



Well, the process is different
for each individual. It's...



- Very different.
- Very different, right. Yeah.



But, I mean, if you had to guess?
Just for planning purposes.



Well, normally, I'd expect
that she'd have very little time left.



But for a dying person,
your mother is looking very healthy.



So if you had to pin it down?



Well, I'd say very little time.



I see.



Could I check in with you
on another thing?



Sure.



What happens with the leftover morphine?



- Keith!
- Oh, well,



after the dying process is completed,



we'll dispose of remaining narcotics
according to federal law.



If you have any other important questions,
please don't hesitate to call, day or night.



Carol will be over at 3:00.



- Thank you so much for your help.
- Thank you.



- I call morphine.
- Percodan!



- Guys, I'm not in the mood.
- You're just pissed 'cause you didn't call it.



I bet if we'd flown Mom to LA,
we could've gotten a bigger star's nurse.



I don't know.



I think Gilda's top of the A-list
for ovarian cancer.



- Yeah, I was thinking all terminal illnesses.
- Oh, I see.



Why don't you both shut the fuck up?



I mean it.



Cousin Eve? It's Keith.



Aunt Wilma? It's Emily.



Yeah, it has been a while.



Emily!



Not that well, really.
That's why I'm calling.



I'm sorry, you want what back?



When did she borrow it?



No, not long, I'm afraid.



Well, that would depend
on what you meant exactly by "long."



Not long.



I'm supposed to be
in Singapore next week.



Okay read that back to me.



I'm getting phone finger here.



Would you mind calling the Scotts,
the Weidermans and the Parkers?



I really don't know
what to say to these people.



- Well...
- Sorry.



Hello?



Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah. Hold on.



It's for you.



Hello?



Hey, Dad.



Okay, so I set the nutrient IV
up into the port-a-cath.



I'm sorry, what's that?



The metal valve
I've had inserted in my chest,



opens right into an artery,



chemo gets in quicker.



- You don't leak, do you?
- Haven't yet.



It's one-way.



The morphine dispenser
hooks into the same line.



So, if you're feeling any pain,
just press the button.



You wanna try it?



It's on a timer, so you can give yourself
a dose whenever you need it,



but you can't OD.



The box only allows
one dose every 10 minutes to start.



What if I need more?



I can increase the dosage
and the frequency as you need it.



- Yeah, Keith?
- Do we each get one?



Sorry.



I thought you quit that stuff after college.



I did.



A grip on my last shoot gave me this.



We were talking about dying relatives.



It's good to see you're dealing with this
in an open, straightforward way.



Just takes the edge off.



Dad called.



Did they talk?



Yeah, 20 minutes.



- What about?
- She wouldn't say.



Why did you and Dad split up?



I don't know,



What were we talking about?



Nothing, Mom. Why don't you rest?



Don't start with me.
What were we talking about?



The antique clocks.



The antique clocks. All right.



So I have divvied them up.



You can trade, but no fighting.



- Got it?
- Got it.



Open that, after.



Oh.



And there's this.



- You wrote your own obituary?
- I had some time.



Do you have anything for, you know,



the funeral?



Just cremate me. No funeral.



Do whatever you want. I don't care.



I don't think I can be there anyway.



- Hey, Matthew.
- Hey.



Hey, Matthew.



- How was the trip?
- My ass has been asleep since Virginia.



I didn't even see his lips move.



Come in and say hi.
And then I've got a book for you to read.



Hey.



- I'm giving you the best stuff.
- It's not who gets what jewelry.



- It's that bitch getting any of it.
- Oh, she's your brother's wife.



- I thought you hated her.
- I never said that.



You did, actually,
at their wedding reception.



Egads! Was I drunk?



Well, I'm wiser now.
They're married, for better or for worse.



Don't make him choose
between his family and his wife.



Hi, Jim.



- Julia. Come on in. Thank you.
- You're welcome.



All I did was kiss a few boys.



You were in the janitor's closet
doing it with Harry Wexler.



- Yes.
- My God, Harry Wexler?



But discretion was never your strong suit.



If you hadn't published
their "lip ratings" in the Nottingham Rag,



you probably could've gotten away with it.



- What is this?
- Julia brought a tuna casserole.



Tuna, noodles,
Campbell's cream of mushroom soup.



- Jesus.
- I know.



- What are you doing?
- Everyone's gonna start bringing food.



We have to stay ahead of this
or we're gonna be buried.



Keith.



Keith, Julia's Mom's best friend.



I see what you're saying.



We should probably
dirty some plates, too.



Good idea.



Gerald Henderson, three lips out of 10.
He was not pleased.



And?



- He had a little dick, too.
- Oh, stop!



Yes, he did.



- Stop!
- Tiny.



I'm so sorry, Neat.



I've gotta drive back tonight.



I could only take the day off.



It's always good to see you.



They don't make friends like us anymore,
do they?



No. Not anymore.



- See you.
- Yeah, see you.



Love you.



Thanks for coming, Julia.



What are you talking about?
She'd come for me, I'd come for her.



Well, thanks.
And the casserole, it was great.



Is it gonna be in Syracuse?



After?



Yeah, that's where the relatives are.



I'll be there. And I'll call every day.



- Don't you remember your grandfather?
- I was five when he died,



Not at all?



You tell me, Tell me about him,



He was a tailor,
He owned a dry cleaning shop,



And your mother?



Nanna was a housewife,



A great cook, Always entertaining,



- This explains why you can't sew or cook,
- Exactly,



Luckily Nanna is still with us,
so I don't have to,



- What?
- Nothing,



All my grandkids are about five,



Some of them younger,



- Hey, you guys! Hey!
- Daddy!



- How was your flight?
- Airplane!



- Airplane, was there an airplane? Really?
- Yes, Daddy.



- Yeah?
- We slept on the airplane.



- Did you?
- No.



- No?
- No.



- Hey.
- Hi.



The redeye always seems
like such a good idea, right?



Oh, yeah. That's why I'm gonna let you
do it all by yourself next time.



- Oh, yeah.
- Come with me.



- How you been, sweetie?
- So, how're you doing?



- Really?
- Yeah.



I'm glad you're here.



- Daddy, is Grandma sick?
- Yes, she is.



Will she be all better tomorrow?



I wish she were, Sarah,
but I'm afraid she's pretty sick.



Is she going to die?



What do you know about dying, sweetie?



Hanna had a fish that died,
but it got better.



I see.



Well, Grandma's not feeling well,



but I know that she's gonna be very,
very happy to see you guys. Okay?



Come in.



- Grandma!
- Grandma! Hi!



Hey, hi.



Come on up here. Come on.
Oh, my goodness, that was...



- Oh, did you make these for me?
- Yeah.



Thank you so much!



- Hey, Ben, did you ride on an airplane?
- No.



- You didn't?
- We came to see you 'cause you're sick.



I'm so glad you did. Thank you.



- Do you have any toys for us?
- Sarah, that's not nice.



It's just fine.
I do happen to have something for you.



Dad, in the top drawer over there.



Something for Sarah
and something for Ben.



Let me see. Okay.



This is for you.



Oh, it's a shark.



And for Sarah I have a kitty.



- What do you say?
- Thank you, Grandma.



- Oh, you're...
- Thank you.



You're so welcome.



Give me a hug.



Oh, I love you guys.



Hey, guys, why don't you
go show Mommy your toys,



and then Grandma
can rest a little bit? Okay?



- Bye.
- Bye, Grandma.



I got lipstick on you.
Bye, honey. See you later, okay?



- See you later.
- Okay.



See you. Bye.
- Goodbye.



- See you.
- See you.



Do you still want to go
to the beach today?



You sure?
'Cause maybe we should go tomorrow.



Today.



Today.



Who is that woman?



- With Barry?
- Yeah.



That's Suzanne, his wife.



She flew in with the kids last night,
remember?



Don't be smart.
I just can't see too well, that's all.



How you doing?



Ready to go home?



How long have we been here?



Forty-five minutes.



Not yet.



You sure?



You look tired.



You paid $10 for parking.
I want you to get your money's worth.



I'm good for the 10 bucks, Mom.



- Don't start, Keith.
- Okay.



You don't get weather like this every day.



That looks good.



- It's no Motel 6, but...
- We said you could stay here.



Right. On the floor? Thank you.



Give me a break.
I can't believe you're whining...



I'm sorry but what kind of break did you
give me when I was in the hospital?



- Did any of you call or write?
- You had your adenoids out.



You were there for three hours.



You know, it is so obvious
that I am not welcome in this family.



Not one of you cares about anything...



That explains why you're rifling
through the jewelry box



so you can buy someone
who gives a shit about you.



I actually think of it more as payment for
being forced to hang out with you people.



I just came here to help Matthew.



What's with the "you people" thing?



Are we a cult now?



She's just here to help.
Why is it always about Katrina anyway?



- What about Miss Perfect?
- Emily's a mess.



Yes, I know. Her mother's dying.
Oh, wait, mine is, too!



Look, maybe if Katrina
just gave her a little space,



- just took the night off...
- You guys don't even try.



You don't even reach out to her.



You know, she has feelings, too.



Yeah, but if she's here to help,
why should we be reaching out?



I'm sorry, isn't she part of the family?



It's her mother-in-law.



Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to do.



Matthew, I'm not.



You know, I've never seen you cry.



- Oh, please, not again. I cry.
- When?



I cried at our wedding.



I sniff a little at really sad commercials.



What, is there some amount
that I'm supposed to cry?



No. I just think it's perfectly normal,
with your mother dying, I mean...



I'm fine. Sherry, really. Honestly, I'm fine.



I just... I'm playing it as it goes.



You're not gonna give me the Zen speech,
are you?



Well, not unless you make me.



I just think tomorrow, you know,



when I leave,
you're gonna bottle this all up.



As soon as I cry,
I'll e-mail you the digital photos.



Come on. We have DSL.



- Rice?
- No, thank you. I have...



Good.



I want a sparerib.



Mom, you can't eat.



You'll get sick again.
It's got nowhere to go.



Do you want to sit and spit, Mom?



What?



Gilda used to do it.
Carol told us. When she...



When she couldn't eat,
she would chew the food but not swallow.



Yeah. Sit and spit.



Let me sit and spit.



Okay.



Can I have a bowl, please?



And the spareribs?



God.



I love spareribs.



I love Kung Pao chicken!



Matthew, that's enough.
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach.



Mom, I'm 27 years old.



I think I can figure out
how much food I can eat.



Bullshit!



No son of mine
could possibly be 27 years old.



He's older.



Well, that's true.



I am, too.



Sorry, Mom.



And you married an old guy, too.



Oh, God.



You are all so worthless.



Oh, boy.



You can't say that.



- You can't say that.
- Why not?



Are you okay?



Shut it down.



The TV?



The IV.



But without the nutrients you'll just...



- Oh, Mom.
- I asked Carol.



She said it would make things go quicker.



Shut it down.



No one should have to go through...



Mom?



Good night, Mom.



Well, actually,
we always planned to stop at three,



What happened?



As I recall,
it was a great big bottle of Mateus,



which is a pink kind of rose wine,



Your father got a great big bottle
for Christmas one year,



He would make a candleholder
out of the bottle afterward,



Wait, wait, so, Matthew was an accident?



You make it sound so tragic,
Cancer is an accident,



Matthew was a blessing,



Matthew, I love you,



You sent us to the circus with Julia
the day he was born,



When we came home,
you were there with a new baby,



And you were always
so scared of clowns after that,



Oh, yeah,



A little help here!



Let's go.



What are we doing?



The photographers
from House Beautiful are here,



and we want the place to look nice.



Right.



Hey, Katrina, can you take
that pile of sheets to the laundry?



You know, I can't do anything
until I've had my coffee.



Okay.



Matthew. Hi, Matthew.



- Hey, Mama.
- Hey.



Good morning.



Dad?



Hi, Dad.



I try not to be, but I am, sort of.



- Who are you talking to, Mom?
- Don't interrupt.



My dad's talking to me.



"It is common for the dying to converse
with loved ones that have already died.



"Be calm and reassuring,
and listen carefully."



Where is Grandpa, Mom?



He's there.



He's there.



- Is there a window open in here?
- No.



I will try.



I love you, too.



I love you, too. I will.



I will.



Come on, let's lie down.



No one's gonna believe this.



Matthew, honey,
nobody made coffee. Will you help me?



Or that.



So we'll take two-hour shifts at night,
okay?



All right. Here's the schedule. Jim. Em.



And there are some holes in the schedule



because I didn't know
if you could do them.



Yeah, I'll do my share.



So, Suzanne and the kids
are leaving tomorrow.



- I'm thinking I might go with them.
- What?



Well, I don't know
how long this is gonna take,



so I thought maybe I'll work a couple days,
then I'll come back.



Wait, you're kidding, right?



Look, Keith, I've got responsibilities,
all right?



I was fine with a few days,
maybe a week even,



but I don't know
how long this is gonna take, so...



Yeah, well, there is that life-or-death
PowerPoint presentation.



I don't know what I was thinking
telling you,



but I'm pretty sure
I was not asking permission.



Don't you fucking judge me.



- Katrina, are you leaving?
- Yeah, the hospital needs me. So...



- Aren't you in human resources?
- Yeah.



I just wish I could be here
to help nurse poor Anita.



We all do.



- You ready?
- Yeah.



- Bye.
- Bye.



- Take care.
- Yeah, you, too.



Mom, Carol's here.



And I brought oxygen and a catheter.



No. No.



Emily said walking
was becoming more difficult for you.



It is.



Mom, you're not throwing up anymore.
The only reason to get out of bed is to pee.



We thought it'd be easier for you
if you just stayed in bed.



Okay?



Okay.



Never thought I'd be sentimental
about the last time I peed.



She okay?



Yeah, I guess. She's just been sleeping.



- Barry? Barry, where are you?
- I'm here, Mom.



- Who are you?
- It's me, Mom. It's Keith.



You rest, okay?



- You know what?
- What?



Leave the Nintendo.



Sorry.



- Who's your favorite child?
- I don't have one,



Barry,



- No,
- Come on, admit it,



Look, I have spent the last 30-some
odd years trying not to play favorites,



And failing, Come on, admit it,



No, I...



Well, Barry is the responsible one,



Do you remember
that trip we took to the Adirondacks,



when Smokey the dog
was so scared of thunder



he shit all over my car?



And who was the only one to ride
with your dad when I took his car?



- Barry,
- Barry,



Yes, You see?



And I loved him for that,



He's been like that his whole life,



He's just always there
for whoever needs him,



But is he my favorite?



Well, I...



I love you all equally,



but it's impossible
to love you all the same,



All right.



I'll be back in a couple of days.



No kiss goodbye for me?



You know what? I'd stay if I could.
I'll be back in a couple of days.



Yeah, sure.
This isn't that important, anyway.



Blow me. All right? You're both freelance.
I'm the only one with a real job.



Look, Barry, whatever you need to do.



You can blow me, too.
I'll call you from San Francisco tonight.



- What?
- Nothing.



It's your call.



I'm doing the best I can here.



- Daddy?
- Yes, honey.



What does "blow me" mean?



- It means see you soon.
- Oh.



Listen,
what time is the HP meeting tomorrow?



What do you mean it's canceled?
Who canceled it?



- What do you mean I did?
- Did what?



What?



Listen, you cannot cancel my meetings
without even...



Are you... Well, who's gonna cover...



They are?



Hang on. No, not you.
So what you're saying is...



You're my assistant. You can't fire me.



What do you mean, "It's real life"?



Yeah.



Yeah. I guess.



Yeah, hold.



Will you be mad
if I don't come home right now?



Of course not.



Because, I mean, this is just work.



The other thing's real life.



Yeah, I know.



What? No. Yes, we're done.



Yes.



- Well?
- Yeah, I'm gonna stay.



- You guys go on ahead. I'll call you later.
- Okay.



- You're doing the right thing.
- You're awesome.



Okay. Come on, guys.



- Go with Mommy.
- It's time to go.



Where's Mommy going?



- Bye, Savannah.
- Mommy...



Hey, Daddy.



Blow me!



Excuse me.
Yeah, I need to get my bag back.



I'm sorry, sir. Your bag has been checked.



That's it right there, you can just grab it.



- Sorry.
- Oh, come on.



- Security.
- Hold it right there, sir!



Put the bag slowly down.
Put your arms in the air.



But this is my bag.



I'm not trying to sneak it onto a plane.
I'm trying to take it home.



Welcome to
Wilmington International Airport,



For your security,
do not leave bags unattended,



Hey, Em. Why don't you go take a break?



You know, walk around the block
or something?



- I can't.
- Yeah, you can. Just take my cell phone.



Matt and I will be here,
and we can keep an eye on things.



No, I promised her. I said I'd be here.



Well, this could take days.
You can't just stay in the house.



I promised.



Well, I promised I'd take the couch.



Oh, my God. Does Sherry know?



No, but what I was trying to say
was that...



Well, where are you gonna put it?
It doesn't go with anything you own.



Yeah, enough about the couch.
My point was that...



Even I wouldn't promise
to take that couch. Yuck.



Even if you re-covered it,
it's still a big piece of shit.



Okay, the couch is gross.
We know the couch is gross.



What I was trying to say was that...



My point was that we all,
you know, promise things to dying people



in moments of weakness.



And... Well, just take a break.



She'll be fine for 45 minutes.



I can't. I promised.



Hello?



It's a mother-daughter thing, I guess.



- Okay. I guess.
- It's Barry.



How are you gonna get it to California?



Now, a $5,000 bail seems pretty fair to me.



- You did try to steal your own suitcase.
- Fucking crackers.



Actually, I'm kind of glad
that you can't leave the state.



Blow me.



Attaboy.



Patients on a high dose of morphine
develop tolerance,



and the pain can be intense.



So, I'm increasing her dosage
to eight milliliters



and the frequency to five-minute intervals.



Anita.



If you can't press the button,
we can press it for you, okay?



Mom?



Mom, what do you need?



Do you want more morphine, Anita?



Morphine, Mom?



Maybe something's wrong with the pillow.



I don't know, Mom.



I don't know what you need.



Hug her.



What?



Hug her.



I'm right here.



I'm right here.



- I'll sit with you, okay?
- Yeah.



Yeah.



Jim?



What?



What are you doing?



What am I supposed to do?



You people, you're like locusts.



You come into my house,



and you just take over.



It's just, she's our mother. You know?



She's my wife.



I mean, we've been together for 13 years.



I didn't know.



You didn't know that it'd been that long?



You didn't know that I loved your mother?



Or you didn't even know that I was here?



Just go downstairs, all right?
I'll be fine tomorrow.



Hey.



Anything?



She was moaning a little.



So I've been hitting the morphine
every 10 minutes or so.



She didn't wake up?



No, that was it today.



She stayed for the grandkids,
but that was it.



You think?



Yeah.



We bought these
because they're indestructible,



They're gonna be
worth something someday,



They're real wood,



I know you kids
don't like some of these things,



but they're important,
They've been in the family for years,



You can sell some of them if you want to,
but you cannot give them away,



They're much too valuable,



You mean like the couch?



You are gonna thank me one day
for making you take that couch,



You just wait,



Yeah, sure,



It's Yom Kippur Friday.



- So?
- It's the Day of Atonement.



Well, since we're only half Jewish,



I like to think of it
as the Morning of Atonement.



I take the afternoon off.



This is like the Christmas
of Jewish holidays.



I'm thinking we should
get a rabbi in to come visit Mom.



- Mom?
- Yeah.



- Our mom?
- I'm just...



It's something I'm thinking about,
that's all.



- Hello, dear.
- Hi.



- You must be Keith.
- Yeah.



I am your mother's friend, Sylvia.



Oh, please, come in.



Oh, no. I won't trouble you,
but I brought you this.



- Your mother said it's your favorite.
- Oh, thank you. What is it?



Tuna casserole.



I made it with cream of mushroom soup



and some of those
fancy canned onion rings, right on top.



- Wow. Hi, I'm Matthew.
- Hi, Matthew.



This is great.



- I'm gonna check on you again tomorrow.
- Okay, all right.



- Bye.
- Bye.



Hey, Matthew, it was really nice of you
to tell that lady that you love that stuff.



What are you talking about?



- You want some?
- No, thank you.



Come on, we are never
gonna get this place cleaned out.



Why would she keep
her expired driver's license from 1987?



Let me see that.
It's a good picture. We should keep this.



Come on.



Mr. Ruthless is in the house.
What about these?



I don't know. They're so Mom.



What the hell? Look.



I especially like this one of you with
your mouth open, chewing on a hot dog.



- It was a tofu dog.
- Of course it was.



Hey, guys, look at this.



"Dr. Vannick, chemo,



"blood test, chemo,



"support group, blood test."



Jesus.



She had an appointment every day
for the last three months.



That's a lot of work.



After five years of that,
I wouldn't want surgery either.



No.



No.



I'm sorry. It feels like grave robbing.



Jim, if that money goes to probate,



it'll be tied up for a year
and the lawyers will get 100%.



- I don't know.
- Jim.



By next week, you're going to be
up to your ass in medical bills.



Yeah.



- All right. I'm in, okay?
- Well done.



- Good.
- Good.



How's it coming?



Well, I got pretty good
when I skipped school,



but it's been a while.



Forgery's like riding a bicycle,
you never forget how.



I've heard.



- What do I get to do?
- You're driving the getaway car.



Ready? Let's go.



If you hear gunfire,



make sure the engine's running
and the doors are unlocked.



How is Mrs. Bergman?



- Not well.
- Fine, thanks.



She's fine, fine.
She's not well enough to come in.



- She has a bit of a cold.
- Right.



So she asked us
to close her account for her.



Just a moment.



I just want to say how great it is to be
working with the two surviving Stooges.



- We were supposed to say, "Not well."
- Well, yeah.



- The whole point of being here...
- Real smooth, Jim.



She's dying.



We're not supposed to tell her she's dying.



Here she comes.



We know.



You know?



I told him.



- See, the thing is...
- It was all my idea.



I talked them both into coming here.



I know...



I know we should have done it
when she was feeling better, but I didn't...



Bedelia's sister works
at the cancer center.



Please tell Ms. Bergman that we all hope
to see her in here again real soon.



- Thank you.
- Sure.



- Thank you.
- We will.



- Bedelia will cut your check.
- Oh, well, thank you.



You know,
the confessing thing worked for you,



but next time, just rat out Barry
'cause he's already got a record.



Blow me.



Well, The Dying Experience says
religious support can be very comforting.



- To who?
- No, "whom."



Well, I guess
I just don't find rabbis all that comforting.



But rabbits are comforting, though.



All soft and fuzzy.
We could get one of those.



Your mother's not very religious.



- Well, maybe if we had someone here...
- Em, she's comatose.



The books say that nobody knows
what comatose people can hear.



Besides,
Mom doesn't like rabbis all that much.



The last time she set foot in a synagogue
was Matthew's bar mitzvah.



Yeah, me, too.



I'm not exactly clear on
why I even had a bar mitzvah.



- To piss off Dad.
- To piss Dad off.



Oh, yeah. Hey, you guys
remember Aunt Eva's rabbit?



- Excuse me.
- Is she the one who lived at the junkyard?



Yeah. But she didn't call it a junkyard,
she called it an antique yard.



- Died a multi-millionaire.
- Excuse me.



We should have visited more often.



Will you guys just shut up?



Mom's dying.



That's what religion is for.



I'm calling a rabbi.
Does anyone wanna fight about it?



No.



Emily's my best friend,



I talk to her two or three times a day,



I love her to death, Em, I do,



- But?
- But?



Well...



But I don't know that I did her any favors
making her my best friend,



Especially during the divorce,



She took everything on
like it was her job to support me,



I would come home and discuss my dates
with my 14-year-old daughter,



She seemed so grown up,



I remember we were on vacation
at Raquette Lake,



right after your father and I separated,



And you were fooling around
with that married cop,



You knew about that?



Well, she was very grown up,



but she couldn't keep a secret
to save her life,



Yeah, well, that was a long time ago,



She keeps secrets better now, right?



Keith?



Mom?



It's okay to let go, Mom.



We'll really miss you, but it's okay.



I'm right here. I'm right here.



Thanks for coming so late, Carol.



I can increase the morphine
and the frequency.



Well, what happens if she gets too much?



In the hospitals, they tend to err
on the side of a few more days of life.



But, in hospice, we leave that
up to the patient and their families.



So too much morphine...



It's up to you and your mom.



She's not very responsive.



- Increase the dosage.
- Okay.



How about this?



- That was Uncle Abe's daughter's.
- How do you know that?



Who's Uncle Abe?



It's real silver.



"Hong Kong. Silver plate." It's crap.



- We can't leave it.
- I am not keeping this stuff.



If you leave it, I'm gonna sell it.



It's sentimental.



- Not to me.
- Me, either.



Fine, I'll take it. Thank you.



I guess that's it then.
I'm gonna stash my stuff in my luggage.



- Yeah.
- Me, too.



I can go to U-Haul
and get you some boxes.



Thanks.



Look, Arnie, I don't want to take
advantage of the family relationship, but...



So, can we get it down to $650?



Great, thanks.



She wants to have them spread
on her father's grave.



Yeah, well,
so it's an Orthodox cemetery. So what?



Yeah. Well, we wouldn't want to piss off
a whole field of dead people,



now would we?



Yeah, well, we'll talk about it, okay?



Yeah, yeah. Great, great.
Thank you. Thanks, Arnie.



Bye.



Thank you for coming, Rabbi.



Well, I'm actually an assistant rabbi.



But I guess,
after 26 years as a Navy chaplain,



I know a thing or two.



Is there a prayer or something
we should say for her for Yom Kippur?



Why, she doesn't need a prayer.
She just needs to get well.



Anita?



Can you hear me?



You're going to be all right!



Now, I was a Navy chaplain for 26 years,
so I know a thing or two!



You'll be fine, okay?



You look good!



Now, take care, you hear?



Well, when Matthew was little,



he liked to get up
in the middle of the night



and come get in bed
with Mommy and Daddy,



which drove Daddy crazy
because he was a very light sleeper,



So what did you do?



Well, there was a closet door
right outside of his bedroom door,



so, at night, we would tie the doorknob
from the closet



onto the doorknob of his bedroom,
and that was the end of problem,



What if there had been a fire?



Oh, my God,
How did I raise such a bunch of wusses?



You guys, you grew up without seatbelts,
breathing secondhand smoke,



I spanked you a couple of times,



Yes, I think I even had an occasional
glass of wine when I was pregnant,



and you all turned out fine,



Except, of course,
for the psychological damage,



Let me give you one really great lesson,
don't judge us too much,



We didn't do it all wrong,
We did the best we could, And so will you,



That's all there is, Don't over-think it,



Not me,



Especially you,



You read the book?



No.



- None of them?
- Nope.



So you're not dealing with this at all?



- Don't "big sister" me.
- Why not? I'm your big sister.



I'll deal with it my own way.



Katrina and I talk.



Leave it alone, Em.



There's no food in this house
invented after 1967.



- You left your cell phone.
- Yeah.



Don't you think we should bring it?



Do you want to find out your mother died



in the cereal aisle of Sir Buy A Lot?



Nope.



Wait a minute. Excuse me.
That orange juice is on sale.



Well, do you have
a Sir Buy A Lot club card?



No.



Then I'm afraid it's not on sale.



But the sign on the shelf
said that it was just on sale.



Well, that's club members only.



Fine, so how do I join
the Sir Buy A Lot club?



- I hear it's very tough to get in.
- Well, that's right.



Look, the woman next to you
just scanned a spare card for somebody.



Well, that's against store policy.



I'm seeing a no-win here.



I'm having a bad week, okay?



And my mother brought me up to believe
that there is



a solution to every problem
if we all just try hard enough.



So tell me, please, please,



who do I have to fuck



to get the Sir Buy A Lot club price
on my orange juice?



I've never been thrown out
of a grocery store.



You get used to it.



And any more?



- What?
- Regrets,



Yes,



Regrets?



I regret that I won't be around to torture
you like this when you're old and sick,



Hey, hey,



So, how do you feel
about your mother dying?



- Come on, Mom,
- I'm waiting,



Fine, I'm thrilled,



This is a growth experience
second to none,



and I thank God every day
I get to go through it,



You 're not gonna answer me, are you?



This video's not about me,



Bowel obstruction's gone.



Mom took a shit.



Great.
Let's wake her up and feed her breakfast.



No, it's not like that.



Look. No, babe,



I know
you don't get along with them, but...



They respect me. They just don't always...



No, they do listen to me.



It's just not a good time
to bring shit up, okay? Mom's...



Yeah.



Yeah.



I'm scared.



I just wish you were here.



Her heart rate, pulse and breathing
are steady and strong.



But she hasn't eaten anything
in three weeks.



- Yeah.
- She's been off of IV for days.



She had a lot of swelling
from the disease and steroids she was on.



Swelling is just water
collecting in the tissues.



- Maybe that has something to do with it.
- So...



So she's like a camel, living off her hump.



Could be.



- What if she's getting better?
- Keith.



Seriously.



You know, maybe starvation
is some kind of cure for cancer.



- Keith.
- No. What if...



What if it's the morphine
and the starvation that are killing her?



- What if we're doing the wrong thing?
- Come with me.



- What if we're doing the wrong thing?
- No. Come on.



Look.



That's cancer.



She's got so much in her, it's coming out.



You fix one bowel obstruction,
another one grows.



I didn't know.



You can't do anything.



We tried it all before.
We're doing what she wants, okay?



So, anyway, I have started to prepare



a list of things
that I want you to do in your lifetime,



things that I won't be here
to make sure you do,



You know, kind of a model of how to live,



A mother can't be too careful,



So, this is yours,



I've made some for each of you,



I've just begun, too, It's gonna get bigger,



Much bigger,



- Why would we play this?
- It's one of her favorites!



Over my dead body.



I can't even stand listening to it right now.



Is this Neil Diamond?



- Tony Orlando and Dawn, 1973.
- I'll handle this.



I mean, it's just, you don't play
something like this at a memorial service.



- Sometimes you do.
- Some...



This is our mom's memorial service
and you want...



What are you kids doing?



He doesn't want me to put this on the tape
for the memorial service.



And she loves this song.



Well, she loves
the Oscar Mayer wiener song, too.



Do you wanna put that
on the memorial tape?



Would you like one man's opinion?



- Absolutely.
- Not really.



Why don't we save it for your funeral?



You can't respect an original for what it is,



but if somebody like U2
decided to remake it,



suddenly it would seem brilliant.



I must've missed when
they announced that on their website.



Punch out.



I'm okay for a couple of hours.



Nah, it's cool. I'm up.



Well, maybe you should wake me
at 3:00 then.



Barry's turn.



Okay.



- Did you give her morphine?
- Oh, shit!



It's been 10 minutes. I must be really tired.



Oh, God.



We killed her.



What do we do?



Nothing.



Nothing.



Oh, Mom.



I always thought if I could picture it,
that meant it was going to be,



Like on an airplane,



if I could picture
getting up on the other side,



then I knew I would be safe,



The funny thing is, I can...



I can...



I can picture the rest of my life,



how I will be at 70 and 80 and 90,
like Nanna,



Then why don't I get to live it?



I wanna see how it turns out, damn it,



I can't stand not seeing
my grandchildren grow up,



I haven't been bad,
Not worse than anyone else,



Not really,



I deserve to see how it turns out, don't I?



- To Mom.
- To Mom.



I've got to make a call.



- Carol? What...
- No. No way.



I give you the letter.



- The letter.
- The letter.



"Dear Keith, Barry, Matthew, Emily,



"I have never made a secret
of my love for you



"or how important you are to me,



"but maybe I've never come right out
and said 'Thank you.'



"Thank you for turning out
to be such fantastic people.



"Thank you for putting up with me



"even though I upset your lives
through a divorce even I can't explain,



"And thank you
for being there for me in all the best ways



"that kids can be there for their parents.



"I know you'll be sad now,
because, after all, I am your mother,



"but we've had a lot of fun and good times



"and that's how I'd like to be remembered.



"Use your own judgment
about the memorial service, I like it small,



"but it seems to be more your decision
on saying goodbye than mine, "



I love you.



"On the next page, I've divided up all
the important items that can't be shared.



"I trust you to share the rest equally.



"Much love.



"I'll always be with you.



"Mom."



All those days
when you lay here unconscious,



I felt like when I was talking to you,



it was like you were really there.



And now...



Now, I don't feel...



I don't feel...



I don't...



Goodbye, Mom.



It's normal out, isn't it?



Yeah.



The most important thing is,
you guys need to stay close,



Your kids need to know each other,



the way you knew your cousins
when you were growing up,



You guys will stay together, right?
After I'm gone?



It'll be hard,



We'll miss the guilt,



No, that'll ride with you
the rest of your life,



Hey, what are you doing?



Matthew.



- Hey, Matthew.
- I've got a headache.



- Well, join the fucking club.
- I don't feel well. I'm going home.



Come on, we've got stuff to do.



Yeah, you mean you've got stuff
you want to order me to do?



Well, yeah, kind of.



The three of you
treat me like I'm 10 years old.



You hate my wife,
you don't even give her a chance...



You know what? I'm fucking sick of it.



Look, come on. We'll make a cup of coffee
and we'll talk about it.



Would you stop trying to control me?



All right?
My mother just died, I don't feel well.



And I'm going home.



What are we gonna do about it?



You're the oldest.
Order him to get a divorce.



Nah, probably wouldn't work.



Well, Dad's Uncle Stanley
didn't talk to his brother for 48 years.



Really? How'd they patch it up?



Well, they didn't.



Stanley got run over by a bus
when he was 90.



Very uplifting. Thank you, Em.



I'll see your Percodan,
and I'll raise you one Dilaudid.



Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Mayer wiener



That is what I'd truly like to be



Hi, I'm meeting my mother,
and I didn't see her come off the plane.



- Sir, this is the luggage office.
- Right.



She's about this big,
coming in on the 2:45 from Charlotte.



And she's probably addressed to me,
that's Keith Bergman.



Arnie, thanks for setting this up.



- Don't mention it.
- Thank you.



No.



Harriet.



- We feel terrible.
- I know.



- She was a good woman.
- Yeah.



Excuse us.



Are you still going to go ahead with,
you know, after?



Well, what would you do, Arnie?



Spreading her remains would



clearly violate the Orthodox Jewish laws
against cremation.



Of course, your mother always did
pretty much what she wanted.



There is that.



Look, today's Friday.



Go out after 3:00, 3:30,
nobody will be there.



Just don't tell anybody.



It's locked.



I don't know.
Those spikes look pretty sharp.



Yeah, you're right.



Why don't we just toss the box over
and run?



No, I'm just saying.



Look, can we not take
all fucking day discussing it?



I'm not climbing the fence.



Great. Well, suggest something else.



There, it's not so bad.



Give me the box.



Hey, Keith, how did...



Shit.



How did you get there?



I told you I wasn't climbing over.
There's a break in the fence over there.



There's a...



A little help?



Did you get directions?



I've been here before.
How hard can it be to find?



It's right next to a tall tree.



- Is this it?
- No, I think it's over there more.



- This is it.
- What?



Yeah, it does look kind of familiar.



What, with our grandfather's name on it
and all?



- Give me the box.
- No, I got it.



- Wait. Keith, give me the box.
- I got it.



- All right, great. Can I have it?
- No.



- Can I have it now?
- No, I got it.



Just give me... Keith. Let go of it.
Give me the...



- Guys. Guys.
- Give me the box, Keith.



Nice work, men.



At least it's open.



Wait, what's this stuff?



I thought it was all supposed to be ash,
but what's this?



Bone.



Oh, man.



What do we spread it with?



Well, our hands, I guess.



Really?



We're already wearing her.



Let's just pour it.



How do we know that that's really her?



I mean,
they could've just given us anyone, right?



It's that...



It's the port-a-cath,
that thing that the IV went through.



Wow.



It's Mom.



It's Mom.



What are you doing?



I'm keeping it.



No, you're not. We're throwing it away.



Keith, throw it away.



No.



- No. Why? Why?
- Just toss it.



Why? Why throw it away?



- Keith, throw it away, please.
- No.



You're not keeping it.



Don't make me throw it away.



It's okay.



Hey.



It's okay, man.



We're here.



We're all here.
