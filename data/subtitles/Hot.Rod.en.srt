1
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,208
Kevin. Did we reinforce
the take-off ramp?

2
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,171
Nah, we didn't have time.

3
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,343
Cool.

4
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,050
Soul of an eagle.

5
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,735
Oh, shit.

6
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,779
Are you okay?

7
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,669
What's up, little riders?

8
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,867
I'm jumping the public pool tomorrow.
2 bucks. Tell your friends.

9
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,881
Eat some smoke!

10
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,247
That's just a sample.

11
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,352
See you there.

12
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,693
Pink grapefruit.

13
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,928
Yes.

14
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,909
- Toasted marshmallow.
- Yes.

15
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,508
Finish her off.

16
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,546
Raspberry?

17
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,775
Psych! Very Cherry.

18
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,011
A hundred straight.

19
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,023
I'm gonna go drop some dumpage.

20
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,189
- Voltron?
- That's me.

21
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,229
- Hi, Dave.
- How you doing, Cathy?

22
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,863
Why'd you call yourself Voltron?

23
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,093
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause it's super badass.

24
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,003
- You're weird.
- Hells, yeah, I am.

25
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,163
Yoo-hoo, shitheads.

26
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,366
I just found a bag of fireworks
in the men's restroom.

27
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,874
Would you guys like to light them off?

28
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,275
All right, boys. Prepare to be dazzled.

29
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,420
Jumping the pool tomorrow!

30
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,011
God damn. Rod!

31
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,742
Mom? Have you seen my hip pads?

32
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,113
In the kitchen.

33
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,811
Rod, maybe you shouldn't fight Frank
this week.

34
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,821
You know, you could rest up
for the jump tomorrow.

35
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,916
Relax, Kev. I'm gonna win this time.
I did, like, 40 crunches yesterday.

36
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,961
What is it with you two, anyway?

37
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,529
You wouldn't understand, Kevin.

38
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,689
He's your real dad
so he automatically loves you.

39
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,495
But he's my stepdad. I have to earn it.

40
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,574
Ancestors, protect me

41
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,669
May they protect you

42
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,816
Frank?

43
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,484
Frank.

44
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,589
Frank!

45
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:01,829
Never sneak up on a man
who's been in a chemical fire.

46
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,731
- Sorry.
- On your feet.

47
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,165
What's this?

48
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,937
Rhodesian fighting sticks.
Very, very lethal.

49
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,671
Rhodesian. Of course.

50
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,178
Come on.

51
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:23,087
You are pathetic!

52
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,656
Stop, stop, I give up! I give up!

53
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,019
Yeah.

54
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,162
No, Frank!

55
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,398
Play the victim,
and you will be the victim.

56
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,768
Very good, Frank.

57
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,097
Very impressive. Ultimate punch!

58
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,074
I'm gonna knock
that ridiculous mustache

59
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:51,740
right off your face.

60
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,579
All great men have mustaches, Frank.

61
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,449
Yeah, but real men actually grow them.

62
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:59,683
You know I have a hormone disorder!

63
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,596
You'll see, Frank.

64
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,930
One day, I'll punch you right in the face,
and then you'll respect me.

65
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,766
I'll believe it when I see it, muchacho.

66
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,475
Take out the trash.

67
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,959
Nailed it.

68
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,393
Rod?

69
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,065
- Denise!
- Hey!

70
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,430
How's it going?

71
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,507
Oh.

72
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,607
Great. Everything's going super great.

73
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,236
You look different.

74
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:57,372
Oh, really? Well, it's been a while.

75
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,281
You look...

76
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,182
You look pretty much exactly the same.

77
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,582
Yeah. Thanks.

78
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,384
And I see you're still doing your stunts.

79
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,051
Big time.

80
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,493
Actually...

81
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,825
Here. Peep the strategy.

82
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,998
You're jumping the pool? Wow!

83
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,536
Yeah, it's the real deal.
You should come.

84
00:07:18,637 --> 00:07:20,730
Maybe I will. Thanks.

85
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,907
Cool.

86
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,875
Well, I gotta go. I gotta feed Buddy,
but very nice to see you, Rod.

87
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,472
Yeah, you too.

88
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,750
You look pretty.

89
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,980
What did you say?

90
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,148
I said you look shitty.
Good night, Denise.

91
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,409
Hey, Pop.

92
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,149
It's me, Rod.

93
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,882
I sure wish you were alive.

94
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,018
You'd tell me how much you respect me

95
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:14,786
and we'd do stunts
and grow mustaches together.

96
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,725
You may have died
an anonymous stuntman,

97
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,231
but you live on through me.

98
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,433
I miss you, Daddy.

99
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,732
Hey, Rod?

100
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,366
Get out!

101
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:37,878
All right, everybody,
let's clear the pool.

102
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,008
There's gonna be a jump.

103
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,816
Come on, seriously, guys.
It's gonna be pretty amazing.

104
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,983
Okeydoke, Rod. It's regulation size.

105
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,989
Thanks, Rico.
Hey, have you seen Kevin anywhere?

106
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,396
He's not here.

107
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,124
What do you mean he's not here?
He's team manager.

108
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,359
- He has to be here.
- I know, right?

109
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,463
Richardson, out of the pool. Let's go.

110
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,735
No can do, Dave.

111
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:06,003
Come on, Richardson.
You're being a tool, man.

112
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:09,337
There is no tool in this pool.

113
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:13,350
And I'd happily get out,
if you let me join your crew.

114
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,184
You can't join the crew, Richardson.
You don't do anything.

115
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,347
Oh, don't I?

116
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,363
You like what you see?

117
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,729
Hey.

118
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,103
Denise. Hey.

119
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,939
Looks exciting.
Is there anything I can do to help?

120
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,603
Oh, no, it's cool.

121
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,674
Stop it!

122
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,307
I think my crew's got it
pretty much covered.

123
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,545
So...

124
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,423
- Good luck.
- Don't worry, Denise.

125
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,188
I've done this before.

126
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,174
Totem spirit, fox.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,026
Please, God, don't let me
embarrass myself in front of Denise.

128
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,155
Hello?

129
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,721
I'm home.

130
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,520
Kevin?

131
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,960
You missed the jump.

132
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,556
I totally landed it.

133
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,176
Rod, thank goodness you're home.

134
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,008
What's going on? Is this some sort of
interactive theater art piece?

135
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,810
It's Frank. He's very sick.

136
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,475
What? Since when?

137
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,519
Since 21 years ago.

138
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,546
It's his heart.

139
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,750
He needs a transplant,
and our insurance won't cover it.

140
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,595
They say he's too high-risk. Oh, Rod.

141
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,664
He doesn't have much time left.

142
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,624
No way.

143
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,192
We would've told you sooner, but
we knew how much it would upset you.

144
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,534
So, you just decided to keep me
and Kevin in the dark?

145
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:52,032
Oh, no, we told Kevin.
We just didn't think you could handle it.

146
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,546
I can handle it.

147
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:58,376
I love you, Kevin.
I want you to have my watch.

148
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:00,481
I love you, too, Dad.

149
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,213
Hold on, Frank! Don't die!

150
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,215
Let's let them talk.

151
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,790
Sorry, boy. My time's up.

152
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,724
But I still need to kick your ass.
How can I do that if you're dead?

153
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,694
Well, then,
I guess I'll die still champion.

154
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,925
No way. Let's do it right now.
One more for the road.

155
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:18,469
Beating me wouldn't mean
anything now. I'm all through.

156
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,165
All I want is to earn your respect, Frank.
How can I do that if you won't fight me?

157
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,208
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

158
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:26,277
before you sucked at being a man
all your life.

159
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:30,678
Oh, my God. I hate you so much,
I just wanna smash your face in.

160
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,081
Too late. I'm a dead man.

161
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,051
What about the transplant?

162
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,215
Oh, sure. 50 grand.
You gonna pay for it?

163
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,155
- No!
- 'Course you're not.

164
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,455
Let's face it. You're a kid.

165
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,030
You live at home. You got no job.

166
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:49,623
All you're good for is goofing around
with your friends on your moped.

167
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,569
You're wrong, Frank. I'm not a kid.
I'm a man.

168
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:57,199
I am gonna get you better.
And then I'm gonna beat you to death!

169
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,041
You couldn't beat a drum.

170
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:04,807
- Rod, are you okay?
- I need to go to my quiet place!

171
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,017
Shit!

172
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,744
Oh, my God!

173
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,003
And that is how it's done.

174
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,342
Wow.

175
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:51,671
It's amazing.

176
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:52,841
That really hurt.

177
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:55,010
Okay, you guys. Thanks for meeting me.

178
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,387
As you all know, I recently found out
that my stepfather, Frank,

179
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,481
is on his deathbed.

180
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:04,995
I needed to think last night,
so I galloped into a wooded glen.

181
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,532
And after punch-dancing out my rage

182
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:11,034
and suffering an extremely long
and very painful fall,

183
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,802
I realized what has to be done.

184
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,035
We're gonna raise the money
to save Frank's life.

185
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,611
Well, that's awesome, Rod,

186
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:23,579
but how exactly
do you plan on doing that?

187
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,343
One big jump, gentlemen.

188
00:16:25,717 --> 00:16:28,481
The biggest jump this town's ever seen.

189
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,282
We're gonna jump 15 buses.

190
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,016
Whoa. Come on, Rod.

191
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,615
That's nearly as many
as Evel Knievel jumped.

192
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:38,287
It's actually one more
than Evel Knievel jumped, Rico. I know.

193
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,592
I checked. Online.

194
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,532
Now, I've gotta be in top physical form
if we're gonna do this jump.

195
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,467
- I'm sorry, Dave.
- What's that?

196
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:47,697
Where are you going?

197
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,833
I'm sorry, man. I just realized,
I'm late for work at the ice rink.

198
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,035
- So, is that a problem?
- Yes.

199
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,740
Now, this jump demands
that I be in top physical condition.

200
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,839
I've already drafted
a rough schedule of exercises

201
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,884
that will help us take things
to the next level.

202
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,887
Once training is complete, we'll turn
our attention to funding the jump.

203
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,958
By my estimations,
we'll need to raise around $5,000.

204
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,856
That includes bus rentals,
ramp construction,

205
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,188
team hats and wrist bands,

206
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,024
and a $9 per diem
for each crew member.

207
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,188
Now you're talking.

208
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,095
We're gonna have to raise money fast.

209
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,998
I'll drum up small-scale stunt work
at birthday parties.

210
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,298
We're talking escape tricks,
fire breathing.

211
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,066
Anything to please the rug rats.

212
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,871
Also, we're gonna have to organize a
lot of shopping carts.

213
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:30,641
And we're gonna go through some trash
for cans and newspaper to sleep on.

214
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,944
Hey! What are you guys doing?

215
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,146
Rod.

216
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,189
Once we've raised the money,
we'll use it to put on the bus jump,

217
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,283
make $50,000, and save Frank's life.

218
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,520
Now, who's with me?

219
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,827
Let's celebrate.

220
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,734
Buddy. Come on.

221
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,179
Hey, Rod.

222
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,592
Oh.

223
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,659
Denise, what's up?

224
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,922
Not much.

225
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,327
Funky fresh.

226
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,629
I heard about your plan to save Frank.
I think that's great.

227
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:28,069
Oh, yeah. I'm mainly just doing that
so I can kick his ass.

228
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,435
Right.

229
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,374
So, Denise, I think I know
why you came over here.

230
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,772
- You do?
- Yeah.

231
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,944
You wanna join my crew.

232
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,614
I can't lie. I think it's a great idea.

233
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,282
We could use someone
with your college experience.

234
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,884
- Cool. I'd love to join.
- Whoa, whoa, Denise. Slow down.

235
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:54,523
You can't just waltz in off the street
and demand to be in my crew.

236
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:59,127
- But I thought you...
- Yeah, I know what you thought.

237
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,499
But the fact is you can't join
until you go through initiation.

238
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,201
All right. What's the initiation?

239
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,213
It's crazy.

240
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,478
It's like the craziest thing
you could even imagine.

241
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,950
Okay.

242
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,418
Here we go.

243
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,485
Rod! Rod.

244
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,684
Welcome aboard.

245
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,387
I'm kind of grumpy today, dude.
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.

246
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,828
I was having those dreams again.

247
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,959
You know how it's just me in a castle.
I gotta fight, like, a thousand wizards.

248
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,004
The only way to beat them is to punch
them as hard as I can in their faces.

249
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,903
And then, when I'm done,
all their little wizard wives came out

250
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,908
and wanted me
just to have sex with them.

251
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,204
Which is kind of weird.

252
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,973
Hey, look at this, huh?

253
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,844
Hey, everybody.
I've got some awesome news.

254
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,646
We have a new crew member today.
Denise.

255
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,151
Hi, everyone.

256
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,812
So, I thought it'd be fun
if we all went around

257
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:53,117
and said our name
and a little something about ourselves.

258
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,251
I'll start. My name is Rod,

259
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,124
and I like to party.

260
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,891
All right, Dave. You're up.

261
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,832
Hi. My name is Dave,

262
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,631
and I like to party.

263
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,504
No, Dave. I just said that I party, so
maybe do something different from me.

264
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:15,038
My name is Dave,
and I am the stunt man.

265
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:17,740
You know what? Let's move on.
Rico, you're up.

266
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:21,610
Hello. I'm Rico, and I like to party.

267
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,450
Yeah. Rico?
What did I just say to Dave?

268
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,747
- Who?
- Dave.

269
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,121
- I like to party. I'm Rod.
- No. You're Kevin.

270
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,353
Right. Kevin. I party.

271
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,454
No. No, you don't.
Okay, nobody parties but me.

272
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,430
Yes. And we party.

273
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:36,830
- No.
- Yeah, just Rod.

274
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,027
- Yes.
- And me.

275
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,594
- No! I'm the only one who parties.
- I'm pretty sure I've partied before.

276
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:44,869
No, Kevin, I know for a fact
you don't party, okay? You do not party.

277
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:47,410
- You're right. Dave's the party guy.
- Sweet.

278
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,073
Oh, my God. Shut up, okay?
I'm just gonna do it for you.

279
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:53,582
Denise. This is the crew.

280
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,176
Dave's the mechanic.
Rico makes the ramps.

281
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,415
And Kevin is
team manager/videographer.

282
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,548
None of them party. Right?

283
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,758
Got it?

284
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:03,953
Okay.

285
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,462
Let's party.

286
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,090
Pools are perfect
for holding water, man.

287
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,970
Man, I don't really know about having
a girl on the team, man.

288
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,569
All right, Rico, listen.

289
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,737
There's an ancient Italian maxim
that roughly translates to,

290
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:27,248
"He who is resistant to change
is destined to perish."

291
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,344
So, why don't you try to open up
that mind of yours? You know?

292
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,787
It's like, look at Kevin. I mean, he...

293
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,616
Real mature, man.

294
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,694
Yeah, don't you ever tell me
how to live my life again.

295
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:40,489
Okay, you guys.

296
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:44,227
If I'm gonna jump 15 buses, my body's
gonna have to be in top physical form.

297
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,430
Which brings us to our first exercise.
Lung strengthening.

298
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,905
You guys are gonna hold me
under water for 40 seconds.

299
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,703
That's 20 less than a minute.

300
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,005
My body's natural instinct
is gonna be to resist.

301
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,979
But, no matter what, don't let up.

302
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,449
If there's any problem at all,
I will ring this bell.

303
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:25,966
Hey, Dave. Mom wants to know
if your friends want some grape punch.

304
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:29,137
Maggie! Don't even ask. Just bring it.
Come on.

305
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,150
Don't just stare at me! Go! Thank you.

306
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:39,586
Soul of a bottlenose dolphin.

307
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,000
Hey, y'all.

308
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,170
Mom said there wasn't enough grape,
so it's mixed with cherry. Is that okay?

309
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,271
Yeah, fine, Maggie. Put it on the table.

310
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,406
Which table?

311
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,077
You tell me, Brainiac.
It's your front yard, too.

312
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,986
Hey, little girl! I don't want cherry.
It upsets my stomach!

313
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:17,393
37, 38, 39, 40. Okay. Let him up.

314
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,192
Get him out, get him out, get him out!

315
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,759
Get him up, get him up.

316
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,968
Rod, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

317
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,736
Come on, Rod.

318
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:38,809
- Nice.
- Oh, God.

319
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,116
- Oh, man.
- What happened?

320
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,711
You almost drowned. Denise just gave
you mouth-to-mouth and saved you.

321
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:50,617
Did it look like we were making out?

322
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,894
A little bit.

323
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:54,225
Awesome.

324
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,295
Are you okay?

325
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,602
Oh. Hey, Denise. What's up?

326
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,697
Great. I'm just gonna go wash off
this puke from my face.

327
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:04,797
Cool.

328
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,339
Speed management.

329
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:10,976
G force.

330
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,973
Let's run it.

331
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:21,118
My safe word will be whiskey.

332
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,522
Sorry, Rod. What was that?

333
00:24:24,195 --> 00:24:25,457
Whiskey.

334
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,058
Don't you mean whiskey?

335
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:28,789
What?

336
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,061
- You're saying it weird.
- Saying what weird?

337
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,158
All of it.

338
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,601
Where do you get off?

339
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,436
I just don't get
why you're saying it that way.

340
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,635
Why I'm saying what what way?

341
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,474
- Forget it.
- I will. I will forget it.

342
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,851
Denise. Would you kindly clear
the wheels?

343
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,519
Okay, here we go. On three.

344
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,551
One,

345
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:57,257
- two...
- Whoa, whiskey!

346
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,852
Whiskey!

347
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:01,591
Whiskey!

348
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,326
Whiskey!

349
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:05,493
Whiskey!

350
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:08,302
Oh, shit!

351
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,336
Rod!

352
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,105
Are you okay?

353
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,874
The safety word didn't help.

354
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,346
My trailer! What the hell?

355
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:21,179
One of you is getting
your dick-hole smashed!

356
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:29,085
I'm freaking pumped! I've been drinking
green tea all goddamn day!

357
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,427
Oh!

358
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,756
Man, he hit his ass
with a parking cone. Nice!

359
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,560
God, I go to church
every goddamn Sunday!

360
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,998
You gonna bring the demons out of me!

361
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,466
- All right, Rico. You got him.
- Rico.

362
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,334
Not with the trash can, buddy.
No, no, come on.

363
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,839
- Trash!
- All right, let's get him off of him.

364
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,308
- Okay, okay, okay.
- No, no. No!

365
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,376
This is my hat, now.

366
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,607
This is totally my hat.

367
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,522
Thanks.

368
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:07,058
So, how do you like
being in the crew so far?

369
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,463
- It's been interesting.
- Told you.

370
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,799
Stop it.

371
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,340
Hey, Denise?

372
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,902
There's something I wanted to ask you.

373
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,139
Yeah?

374
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,310
Well...

375
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:30,013
I couldn't help but notice
that we've both matured a lot,

376
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,820
physically.

377
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:35,858
And I was just wondering if maybe...

378
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,825
Hey, Rod. What's that song called,

379
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,590
about the grandma
getting run over by a reindeer?

380
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,933
Grandma Got Run Over
by a Reindeer?

381
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,263
No.

382
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,634
Jonathan.

383
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,537
Hey, what are you doing?
I thought you were at work.

384
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,409
Wanted to come by
and surprise my little girl.

385
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,516
Hey, guys.

386
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,052
This is Jonathan.
He's visiting from the city.

387
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,122
- What's up, fellas?
- I'm gonna grab my jacket.

388
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,190
Okay.

389
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,528
So, what are you supposed to be?

390
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,064
A stuntman.

391
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,530
How about you, precious?

392
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,634
I'm a team manager.

393
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:24,967
Wow.

394
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:27,774
Ready.

395
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,740
Have a nice day, guys.

396
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:31,415
Bye.

397
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,812
Oh. Rod, what were you gonna ask me?

398
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,978
Oh, right.

399
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,989
I was going to ask you
who you think would win

400
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:44,494
in a fight between
a grilled cheese sandwich

401
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,964
and a taco.

402
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,168
Is that really what you were gonna ask?

403
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,327
Yes.

404
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,368
Grilled cheese. But only in a fair fight.

405
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,773
If it's prison rules, I'd take the taco.

406
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:04,177
Wow. That's pretty racist, but correct.

407
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,216
I'll see you guys.

408
00:28:17,995 --> 00:28:20,156
You know what car is super-overrated?

409
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:22,323
- What?
- Corvette.

410
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,861
You mean, like the one
Jonathan was driving?

411
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:28,564
Is that what he was driving?

412
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,440
Must've been what reminded me.

413
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,908
I don't know,
I thought it was kind of cool.

414
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:36,605
Okay, boys. Now, this is the first time

415
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,740
your father's feeling well enough
to sit with us at the dinner table.

416
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:44,379
So I want everyone to promise me,
no fighting.

417
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:48,448
What're you looking at me for?
Kevin could fight him.

418
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,686
- I promise not to fight him.
- Thank you, Kevin.

419
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,422
- Rod?
- Fine, I promise.

420
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,588
Thank you.

421
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,658
Hi, Kevin.

422
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,928
Hey, Dad.

423
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:00,196
Thank you, dear.

424
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,266
Frank.

425
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,812
So, Frank.

426
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,815
I'm sure you've heard the plan
to get you a new heart is going great.

427
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,111
Nope.

428
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:15,651
Well, it is.

429
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,345
You can say thanks, if you wanted.

430
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,082
No, I'm good.

431
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,522
I know what you're doing, Frank.

432
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,595
You're trying to make me lose
my temper.

433
00:29:24,695 --> 00:29:26,754
But it's not gonna happen.

434
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:30,095
I'm afraid cooler heads have prevailed.

435
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,228
You're the devil!

436
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,096
All right! That's enough.

437
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,833
Frank, back to bed.

438
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,465
Rod, outside.

439
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,702
Fine.

440
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:41,871
Have fun being married to Satan!

441
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,896
Nice work, Rico!

442
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,317
So, Denise. Tell me about Jonathan.
What's that dude all about?

443
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:30,152
Well, we've been going out
for about a year.

444
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,861
- And it's going well?
- Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,194
I mean, every relationship has
its ups and downs, but...

446
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,927
Right. I've heard that.

447
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,003
And he's a nice guy?

448
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,629
Oh, yeah. I mean, he's really smart.

449
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,903
He's actually in line to become
a junior partner at his law firm.

450
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,808
Right. Totally.
You guys should break up.

451
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:51,040
- What?
- Nothing. Hey, Dave's back.

452
00:30:51,148 --> 00:30:54,117
You guys, the bathroom here is nuts.

453
00:30:58,489 --> 00:30:59,820
What do I owe you?

454
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,983
$7.25.

455
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,454
So,

456
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:33,881
hi.

457
00:31:33,991 --> 00:31:36,391
$2.39's your change. Thank you.

458
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,529
We don't talk much, do we?
Cathy, was it?

459
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,225
I'm Rod. I do awesome stunts.

460
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,269
All the time, with my friends.
You probably didn't know that.

461
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,134
And you probably have lots of cool stuff
about you that I don't know.

462
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,868
The point is, if you don't sit down
with someone and really talk

463
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,773
and get to know them,
you never find those things out.

464
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,073
So, what do you say?
You wanna make this thing official?

465
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,082
Are you asking me out?

466
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:04,977
Oh, Cathy!

467
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,558
Wow, Rod. I can't believe she said yes.

468
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:15,359
Yeah, well, you have only to believe if
you wish to achieve, Kevin.

469
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,263
That rhymed. Unintentional.

470
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:21,532
Man, Rod. I am just green
with jealous rage right now.

471
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,932
- She's really pretty.
- I know, D.

472
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,033
But it's more than that with Cathy.
It's emotional.

473
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:28,839
She really gets me.

474
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,312
Tell you what. Why don't you grab
that brainy beau of yours

475
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:33,178
and we'll make it a double date.

476
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,273
Really?

477
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,149
- Sure.
- Okay. That sounds like fun.

478
00:32:37,254 --> 00:32:40,849
Great, because I also think
it sounds like fun.

479
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,418
A lot.

480
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:53,466
Frank.

481
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,332
I know you're sleeping,

482
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,501
but I just wanted you to know
that training is going really great.

483
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,670
My reflexes are sharp.

484
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,773
I'm crazy agile.

485
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:09,913
And I have a date.

486
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,051
So, anyways, that's the update.

487
00:33:16,727 --> 00:33:18,388
Sleep tight.

488
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:21,897
Who are you talking to?

489
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:27,034
Oh, when you're going on a date

490
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,765
You put on a shirt

491
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:33,105
And you drive your bike to the date

492
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,218
Looks like you got stood up, huh?

493
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,415
No, she's coming.

494
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,882
Okay.

495
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,016
Hey, guys, can I take your order?

496
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,525
No, we're actually waiting for...

497
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,892
Yeah, we'll take
three Flaming Dr. Peppers.

498
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,055
Okay.

499
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,598
So, Super Dave.

500
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,396
Denise tells me you're working on
some pretty big-time stuff.

501
00:33:58,502 --> 00:34:01,232
Yeah, well, I been doing stunts
since I was a kid,

502
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,636
so it's not really a big deal to me.

503
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,641
Yeah, me neither.
I was just being polite.

504
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,370
But thanks for letting me off the hook.

505
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,536
Jonathan.

506
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,670
Here we go.

507
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,372
Oh, speak of diablo.

508
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,347
Bombs away.

509
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,485
Boom! There's the flavor!

510
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,691
So, how's your mom holding up, Rod?

511
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:31,666
Oh, pretty good, I guess.

512
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,499
I mean, sometimes I think
she's really sad.

513
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,768
Holy shit, is that Sullivan? Sully!

514
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:40,173
- Bro, no way!
- No way, Sully.

515
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:41,938
Babe, I gotta say "what up" to Sullivan.

516
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,172
- Okay.
- Sweet.

517
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,716
Hey. Don't you two go falling in love
while I'm gone.

518
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,313
Like that'll happen.

519
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,685
Sullivan, you chode!
I owe you a shot to the nuts!

520
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,854
Maybe you should call her, Rod.
Just check in.

521
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,660
Nah. She hates it
when I try and keep tabs on her. So...

522
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:11,006
Hey, Denise?

523
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:13,338
Have I ever showed you a picture
of my dead dad?

524
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,708
- No.
- Oh, you've gotta see it.

525
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,303
He's super dead.

526
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,709
- That's him?
- Yeah.

527
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:25,248
He looks so nice.

528
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,817
He was a stuntman?

529
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,653
Oh, yeah.

530
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:33,157
He used to work for Evel Knievel,
testing his bikes before big jumps.

531
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,959
He would do the jumps first,
to make sure they were safe

532
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:38,159
and then let Evel come in
and get all the glory.

533
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,999
And, after a while, the old man said,

534
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,268
"To hell with that.
I want the credit I deserve."

535
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,972
So, one afternoon,
he set out to jump ten milk trucks.

536
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:54,713
He nailed the takeoff, but when he
landed, something terrible happened.

537
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,416
His front tire exploded like a cannonball

538
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:01,719
and his handlebars went
straight through his head.

539
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,856
Blood was everywhere.

540
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:07,223
His teeth were ground down to a powder

541
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:12,065
and the front of his face exploded
out the back of his skull.

542
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,336
He died instantly,

543
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,167
the next day.

544
00:36:19,543 --> 00:36:21,135
That's horrible.

545
00:36:21,478 --> 00:36:22,843
I know.

546
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:23,914
When my mom married Frank,

547
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:27,575
I kept my dad's last name
to honor his memory.

548
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:32,412
And every time I do a stunt,
I know he's watching.

549
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:42,698
Okay, people, training's going great,
but Frank's running out of time.

550
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,893
So I'm officially kicking off phase two,

551
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,697
Operation Fiscal Jackhammer.

552
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:51,741
Starting right now, we're gonna fill
this jug with 5 grand.

553
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:53,207
Let's work!

554
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:32,242
- All right. Who has the keys?
- Oh, man.

555
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,816
Rod, we're gonna be right there!

556
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,476
Oh, my God. Find them, find them!

557
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,017
I found the key.

558
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,022
They grow up so fast.

559
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,652
Get the fuck off my porch.

560
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,031
Sounds good.

561
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:50,393
Oh, no, Kevin!

562
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:02,536
For he's a jolly good fellow

563
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,802
For he's a jolly good fellow

564
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:08,537
For he's a jolly good fellow

565
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:10,340
- Is everything ready?
- Now?

566
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:12,472
- No, not now!
- Blow it now!

567
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,389
- You're a terrible stuntman.
- What?

568
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:32,858
- You're a terrible stuntman!
- What?

569
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:35,228
You're a terrible stuntman!

570
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,934
I'm just kidding. I can hear you.
It was just really mean.

571
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:44,646
Tai chi teaches that if you focus
your body and mind,

572
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:49,949
you'll be able to perform
at the peak of your abilities.

573
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,786
Yes, sensei.

574
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,221
You don't have to call me sensei, Rod.

575
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:55,952
Got it.

576
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,025
Sensei, I have a question.

577
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,222
Is there a tai chi move

578
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:04,232
that would make a grown man
crap his pants, and not know why?

579
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:07,929
I'm not gonna lie to you, Rod.
That move does exist.

580
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,870
But you're not ready for it yet.

581
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,935
As you wish, sensei.

582
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:18,140
Now we take the ball
and we push the ball away.

583
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:20,941
Yeah, we could.

584
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:26,049
Or you could cut the kiddie stuff
and show me the crap-yourself move.

585
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,495
That didn't work.

586
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,537
Anyways, I'm gonna get going, so,

587
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,969
take it easy.
I'm gonna go see what Frank's doing.

588
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,599
You wanted to see it, Rod.

589
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,737
Yeah, I did want you to show me,
and you didn't, 'cause it didn't work.

590
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,817
So now I'm gonna go, 'cause
there's nothing left for me to learn.

591
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:57,114
Thank you, though, for trying.
That was very nice of you to try.

592
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:03,052
Please believe
I do my laundry with no pants on

593
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,762
Hey, half-brother.

594
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,164
What you working on?

595
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:14,101
- Nothing. I'm just messing around.
- Oh, yeah?

596
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:15,466
Let's take a look.

597
00:41:15,572 --> 00:41:18,097
- Okay, but it's not really finished, so...
- Got it.

598
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,604
That's something else
that I'm working on. For Mom.

599
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,376
- Not for me.
- Right.

600
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:27,950
Mom likes that stuff, so...

601
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:29,541
Here's the right one.

602
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,586
Dominique Wilkins.

603
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,002
I'm Rod Kimble,
stuntman extraordinaire.

604
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:52,805
Life is short.

605
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,783
- That's it.
- Holy moly, Kev-bot.

606
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,286
- That was beautiful.
- You liked it?

607
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,356
Are you kidding me? I loved it!

608
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:08,390
You're the next
Douglas Bubbletrousers!

609
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,016
Wow, Rod. Thanks.

610
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,188
Kevin, I just had a great idea.

611
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,834
Hey, Frank.

612
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,494
It's me, Rod.

613
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:32,107
I just wanted to let you know,
we've already raised over $3,000.

614
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,234
Soon, I'll jump 15 buses

615
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,372
and then I'm gonna kick your ass.

616
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,511
I'm gonna assume you're laughing
at some funny dream you're having.

617
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,782
You're a pussy.

618
00:43:47,924 --> 00:43:49,983
What is that, sleep-talking?

619
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:51,287
You suck.

620
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:54,057
Frank, open your eyes.
You are not asleep!

621
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,600
I am asleep, homo.

622
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:01,902
Oh, it's so good to see him
smiling again.

623
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,839
Yeah! And you know what
won't make him smile?

624
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:09,945
When I murder him!

625
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,913
And I am genuinely sorry
about the window!

626
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,089
Enjoy the show. Hey, how are you?

627
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:22,759
Enjoy the show.

628
00:44:27,597 --> 00:44:29,929
Yeah, I have various responsibilities
within the crew, you know.

629
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:34,265
I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades, really.
I one time manned a flamethrower.

630
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,395
Cool.

631
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:38,065
Of course it's cool.
It's awesome as shit.

632
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,406
Here you go, Mr. And Mrs. Powell.
Front row seats.

633
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:42,944
I hope you all enjoy the show.

634
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:45,344
I can assure you I won't.

635
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,110
- Thank you, Rico.
- Okay.

636
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,650
Goodbye, Rico.

637
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,952
Hey, I just did the numbers.

638
00:44:51,054 --> 00:44:54,217
We sold 200 tickets at 5 bucks apiece,
which comes to $1,000.

639
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,451
Now, you add that to the money
from the birthday parties,

640
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,357
and it's over $4,900.

641
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,896
Rod, we're really gonna do this jump.

642
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:03,727
Of course we are, Kevin.
We're geniuses!

643
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,326
Oh, heads up.

644
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,027
Oh, man.

645
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:54,510
This guy's a moron!

646
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:55,642
Shut up!

647
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,781
You suck!

648
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,158
We're all laughing at Rod!

649
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,729
The devil's lies

650
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:19,174
Run, red man
Run for your life

651
00:46:22,145 --> 00:46:26,206
Oh, my God. Bear.
No, there's a bear. Bear!

652
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,611
Kevin, turn it off!

653
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:31,752
- Rod...
- I said, turn it off!

654
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:35,184
I try to drink at least two a day.

655
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,658
Oh, yeah!

656
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:42,222
My Native American healer...

657
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,964
Hey, what happened to the crazy movie!

658
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,165
Take it easy! Whoa, whoa.

659
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,877
What the hell was that all about?

660
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:54,104
What the hell was that all about?

661
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,543
Rod, I'm sorry.
I don't know what they're laughing at.

662
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,273
Your video made me look like an idiot!

663
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:01,578
- I didn't mean to.
- What was it, Kev? Jealousy?

664
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,654
You couldn't take everyone loving
my stunts and thinking you're short?

665
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:06,517
- I'm not short.
- Yes, you are!

666
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,056
No, I'm not!

667
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,948
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, guys.

668
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,118
- Oh, you guys.
- Come on, they're serious,

669
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:12,661
let them work it out.
Let them work it out.

670
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:13,729
Let them work it out.

671
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,764
Okay, I'm out. Peace, I'm out.

672
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,067
What do you want?

673
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,858
Come sit down, honey.

674
00:47:51,601 --> 00:47:53,193
I failed, Mom.

675
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:57,129
I lost all the money
and people laughed at my stunts.

676
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,834
Dad would've been ashamed of me.

677
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,211
Rod, there's something
I have to tell you.

678
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,742
Something that I should've told you
a long time ago.

679
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,044
What?

680
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:12,019
I haven't been completely honest
with you about your father.

681
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:15,020
You see, he wasn't a stuntman.

682
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,819
What?

683
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,259
He was a cashier in a tire shop.

684
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,923
But what about the picture?

685
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:24,762
It was just a picture.

686
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:28,998
Evel Knievel came to town, and
he posed with everyone in the store.

687
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,836
You lied.

688
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,001
You had such an imagination as a boy,

689
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,600
and when you saw that picture

690
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,681
you started to make up
these wonderful stories.

691
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:42,240
And I didn't have the heart to tell you
it wasn't true.

692
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,782
You have to believe me.
I did it out of love.

693
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:47,885
So, how did he die?

694
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,822
He choked on some pie.

695
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,554
What? Come on. Seriously?

696
00:48:52,662 --> 00:48:55,187
He wanted to win that contest so badly.

697
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:56,766
Well,

698
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,528
I guess if he wasn't a stuntman,
then neither am I.

699
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,466
Rod.

700
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:05,702
Rod!

701
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,111
You did the right thing, honey.

702
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,610
There he is.

703
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:44,475
Rod! Hey, Rod!

704
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:45,843
Hold it right there, Rod.

705
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,782
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

706
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:50,284
Grocery shopping.

707
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,048
I don't understand, Rod.

708
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:56,421
I'm not a stuntman, Dave. I never was.
Just a normal dude.

709
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,391
Well, what the hell are we supposed to
do, huh? Where's that leave us?

710
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,986
I dunno, Rico. You tell me.

711
00:50:01,097 --> 00:50:03,327
What ever happened to
"Live as a team, die as a team?"

712
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,459
It's a sham, okay?
There's no such thing as a team.

713
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:07,763
You live and die alone.

714
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:11,602
Do you see what you're doing to him?
You're making him upset.

715
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,471
How important is this to you? Huh?

716
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:15,407
I don't even cry, and look at me.

717
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,537
You're about to make
tears come out of my face.

718
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,410
I'm sorry, okay?
This isn't what I wanted.

719
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,416
Who am I supposed to build ramps for?

720
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,316
Who am I supposed to
build ramps for now?

721
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,254
I just wanna be friends, Rod.

722
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,056
I want us to...

723
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,095
For serious.

724
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,931
You wanna know
why I joined the crew, Rod?

725
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,631
It's 'cause ever since we were kids,

726
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,904
you've always done exactly
what you wanted to do.

727
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:53,043
And everybody else just grew up,
and got boring, and sold out.

728
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:55,743
But you stayed exactly the same.

729
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,717
Who cares what anyone thinks?

730
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:01,154
You don't get it, do you, Denise?
I used to be legit.

731
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,658
In fact, I was too legit.

732
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:06,922
I was too legit to quit.

733
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,521
But now I'm not legit.

734
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:11,566
I'm un-legit.

735
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,102
And for that reason, I must quit.

736
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,262
You don't mean that.

737
00:51:15,371 --> 00:51:16,736
Yeah. I do.

738
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,040
Stay sweet.

739
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:53,138
- Hello?
- Rod. Hey, buddy, it's Dave.

740
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:56,002
- From the crew.
- Yeah?

741
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,340
Hey, man, what's going on, man?

742
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,439
I just, you know, wanted to call,
see how you're doing.

743
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,018
Maybe you'd wanna hang out,
you know?

744
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,916
Possibly take me to the hospital?

745
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,649
- You know? If you're free.
- Is everything okay?

746
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,658
Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.
Everything's great.

747
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,059
No, no. But, you know, it's probably
just precautionary, you know.

748
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,563
If you just wanna swing by, man,

749
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:17,098
I'd totally appreciate it.

750
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,135
Yeah, sure. Just give me a minute.

751
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:23,662
Rod, thank you so much...

752
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,781
Hey, Rod. Thanks for the ride...

753
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,724
Hey, buddy, how's it going?

754
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,161
Dave, what happened to your eye?

755
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:49,390
- This?
- Yeah.

756
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,262
- Is it really noticeable?
- Yeah.

757
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:55,770
Oh, man, it's totally serendipitous.
Well, I got off work early.

758
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,773
And you know my buddy, Derrick?
Well, he was like...

759
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:02,140
"I've got this acid, but I can't do it."

760
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,269
And I was all like,

761
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:05,472
"Well, I'll do it."

762
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:08,040
So I did it.

763
00:53:09,285 --> 00:53:12,721
And by the time I got on
my banana board, man, I was...

764
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:15,891
I was tripping balls pretty hard, man.

765
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:19,718
So, I decided to get on my
bench grinder

766
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,923
and a piece of metal flew up
and hit me right in the eye.

767
00:53:23,032 --> 00:53:24,260
It was pretty awesome.

768
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,562
And that brings us to now.

769
00:53:26,669 --> 00:53:29,832
Yeah, well, just try and relax.

770
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:33,031
Can do, man. Can do.

771
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,171
I'm gonna be honest with you, Rod.

772
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:42,374
You look like a giant eagle
with fire all around you

773
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,821
and you've got a mountain for a face.

774
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,822
I'm guessing that's the drugs, Dave.

775
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,893
Yeah, but it's also just kind of weird
seeing you drive this minivan.

776
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,088
Yeah, well, it's my mom's.

777
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,860
Balls, man!

778
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:00,700
Man, we just ran over a small bus.

779
00:54:00,803 --> 00:54:02,737
This really small bus,
we just ran over it.

780
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,101
I didn't see anything.

781
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,232
Hey, we're here.

782
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:08,674
Seriously, man, this is, like,

783
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:12,441
one of the top ten nicest things
anybody has ever done for me.

784
00:54:12,548 --> 00:54:14,345
Don't worry about it.

785
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:23,292
Hey,

786
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:27,055
I know things are feeling
pretty bad for you right now,

787
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:31,429
what with your biological dad not being
a real stuntman and whatnot, but,

788
00:54:32,468 --> 00:54:35,562
I dunno, the way I look at it,
you've still got this other dad at home,

789
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,971
sick in bed,
and you sure do love him, man.

790
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,441
And if he's sick, and you've got
the talent to make him better,

791
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:43,842
well, that's pretty special.

792
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,507
And to deny that would just be

793
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,545
dumb.

794
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:52,382
All right. Take it easy, mountain-face!

795
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,161
- Hospital?
- Trash can!

796
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,061
Sweet. Thanks, buddy.

797
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:19,045
Teacher, there are things

798
00:55:19,148 --> 00:55:21,946
That I don't wanna learn

799
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:25,846
'Cause there ain't no joy

800
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,590
For an uptown...

801
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,962
Hey.

802
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:38,792
Hey.

803
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:40,632
So, look,

804
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:46,169
I was way out of line, and I'm sorry.

805
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,608
It's okay.

806
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,008
Sorry about your dad.

807
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:53,275
Thanks.

808
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:57,550
So, cool beans?

809
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,886
Cool beans.

810
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,550
Cool beans.

811
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,723
Cool beans.

812
00:56:05,294 --> 00:56:06,386
Cool beans.

813
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,895
- Cool beans.
- Cool beans.

814
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,760
- Cool beans.
- Cool beans.

815
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,591
- Cool, cool.
- Bean, beans.

816
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,668
- Cool.
- Beans.

817
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,396
- Cool, cool.
- Beans, beans.

818
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,471
- Cool...
- Beans.

819
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:17,163
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

820
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,240
- Cool
- Beans

821
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,003
- Cool
- Beans

822
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,668
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

823
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:23,803
- Cool
- Beans

824
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,505
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

825
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,604
- Cool
- Beans

826
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,411
- Cool, cool
- Beans, beans

827
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,485
- Cool
- Beans

828
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:31,416
- Cool, cool, cool
- Beans

829
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:32,749
Cool beans!

830
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:38,120
So, cool beans?

831
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,825
Yeah. Cool beans.

832
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,694
Good.
Because I have some exciting news.

833
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,022
So, before the screening,

834
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,466
I took the liberty of posting
some of the stunt footage online.

835
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:48,696
Great.

836
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,170
Well, I guess people
liked what they saw,

837
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,968
because it started to get sent around.

838
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,565
As of this morning,
it's been downloaded

839
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,042
over 100,000 times.

840
00:56:56,145 --> 00:56:57,271
Seriously?

841
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:02,044
Yeah. It's bouncing around the web like
a beach ball at a Nickelback concert.

842
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:04,342
But that's not even the best part.

843
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,285
KNER called us.

844
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,017
- The AM radio station?
- Yeah.

845
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,685
They heard about the web stuff,
and how we're trying to save Frank

846
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:13,227
and they wanna sponsor the bus jump,

847
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,763
with all the proceeds going
to Frank's surgery.

848
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:17,856
And what'd you tell them?

849
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:21,933
I think you'll be needing this.

850
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,891
Oh, hey, Mr. Pasternack.

851
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:50,932
Hey, Kevin.

852
00:57:51,033 --> 00:57:54,833
Hi. Mr. Pasternack, I'd like
to introduce you to my brother, Rod.

853
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:56,871
- Pleasure to meet you, son.
- Hi.

854
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,567
Mr. Pasternack is the owner of
the radio station that's funding the jump.

855
00:57:59,675 --> 00:58:01,540
And I'm the number one DJ.

856
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,077
No shit.

857
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,971
I've gotta tell you, boys, I couldn't be
more excited about this jump.

858
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:11,452
When people hear me describing it over
the radio, they are going to remember

859
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:16,184
that AM radio is a viable and modern
source for news and entertainment.

860
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,919
Totally.

861
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:20,154
I used to be number one in this town,

862
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,561
but people don't listen to AM
like they used to.

863
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,498
Seems like it's more
about FM and color TV.

864
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:27,762
- That's stupid.
- It sure is, Kevin.

865
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:31,806
In fact, I've got a tattoo here
that fully illustrates my point.

866
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:36,345
It's of this rebellious young man,
and he's urinating on an FM radio.

867
00:58:36,445 --> 00:58:40,074
And then this other stream of urine is
going onto that television set.

868
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,673
Implausible, I know,

869
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:44,115
but I like to imagine
that he had sex the night before,

870
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,451
and now a little bit of residue
is blocking his urethra,

871
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:50,219
allowing the urine to flow
in two separate directions.

872
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:54,262
You may also note that an AM radio
is sitting, safely dry, in the middle.

873
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:56,160
It's on a little magic carpet there.

874
00:58:56,265 --> 00:58:58,358
Oh, yeah, look at that.

875
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:03,200
Now, Rod, I've spent
the station's last $15,000 on this.

876
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:06,639
So it has to be a big success.
You understand?

877
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:09,472
- You can count on me, sir.
- Excellent.

878
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:13,675
This is the big one, boys.
This is the one that brings us back.

879
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:18,113
Soon, AM radio will reign king
once more!

880
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,766
Honey, your phone's ringing.

881
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,464
What?

882
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,707
Don't worry, I got it.

883
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:46,081
Hello.

884
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,343
Hi, may I speak to Denise, please?

885
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:51,318
No, she's in the can.
Can I take a message?

886
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,388
- Jonathan?
- Yup.

887
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,320
Okay. You got a pen?

888
00:59:55,424 --> 00:59:57,289
Yes, sir. Got one right here.

889
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:58,826
The message is,

890
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,657
"Denise, it's Rod.

891
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:05,632
"I'm jumping 15 buses tomorrow at
the fairgrounds. Hope you can make it."

892
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:08,636
Fifteen buses.

893
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:10,501
Wait, did you really write it down,

894
01:00:10,606 --> 01:00:12,801
or are you just waving your arm
around in the air?

895
01:00:12,908 --> 01:00:16,366
Come on.
Rod, you've got some imagination, kid.

896
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,413
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna get her the message.

897
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:19,776
Okay.

898
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:22,809
Who was that?

899
01:00:22,918 --> 01:00:24,408
Wrong number.

900
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:37,155
I give the old man a week.

901
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,234
Really insensitive, Bob.

902
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:47,038
He's had a bad day.

903
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,941
Maybe you should sit with him.

904
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,692
Hey, Frank.

905
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:09,427
I know you're not feeling so good,
but I need you to hold on a little longer.

906
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,601
The big jump's tomorrow.

907
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,860
We're gonna sell tickets

908
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,530
and people are gonna hear about it
at home on the AM radio

909
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,335
and donate money.

910
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,404
It's basically the perfect plan.

911
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,913
You're gonna get yourself killed.

912
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:31,175
Well, I'd rather die than live in a world
where I can't kick your ass.

913
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:36,716
Rod.

914
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:40,787
What?

915
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:43,262
You know why I've been so hard on you?

916
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:47,826
Because when I'm gone, you're gonna
have to be the man around here.

917
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:53,968
Frank, if I do land this jump,
will you respect me?

918
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,610
Not until you beat me in a fight,
you pathetic washout.

919
01:02:06,021 --> 01:02:08,285
I can't wait to punch your face in.

920
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,823
And I can't wait for you to try.

921
01:05:02,301 --> 01:05:05,134
What the hell? Was that because of us?

922
01:05:05,237 --> 01:05:08,968
I dunno, man. It started off
super positive, then it just got crazy.

923
01:05:09,074 --> 01:05:10,541
I did not like that at all.

924
01:05:10,642 --> 01:05:12,735
No, Kev. None of us did.

925
01:05:12,845 --> 01:05:15,279
Yeah, it was totally messed up.

926
01:05:15,814 --> 01:05:18,749
It's disgusting how people will just,
you know, take something good

927
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:21,251
- and just take advantage of a situation.
- Yeah.

928
01:05:21,353 --> 01:05:23,685
There was no time to do anything,
except just leave

929
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:26,314
and just hope that you're not hurt.

930
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:27,687
It's great to have you guys back,
by the way.

931
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:28,919
- Well, thank you, man.
- Feels good to be back.

932
01:05:29,027 --> 01:05:31,291
- So, you wanna...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

933
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:35,595
The dog walked itself home,
ate a pizza, and took a nap.

934
01:05:35,934 --> 01:05:38,994
In local news,
self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble

935
01:05:39,104 --> 01:05:42,505
is going to attempt to jump
fifteen buses today.

936
01:05:42,608 --> 01:05:44,633
We would bring you
coverage of the jump,

937
01:05:44,743 --> 01:05:49,840
but apparently an AM radio station
has the exclusive broadcasting rights.

938
01:05:49,948 --> 01:05:52,280
In other news, riots broke out...

939
01:05:52,384 --> 01:05:53,442
Terrific.

940
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:55,916
Buckle your seatbelts
and open your ears,

941
01:05:56,021 --> 01:05:59,354
it's a jump for the ages today
on KNER AM.

942
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:03,451
But first, here's Duke Wentworth
with A Jim-Jam Jubilee.

943
01:06:04,596 --> 01:06:07,121
- All right, there you go.
- Here, Rod.

944
01:06:07,232 --> 01:06:08,665
- Cool, what's your name?
- Matt.

945
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:13,295
Matt. You are cool. Don't be like Frank.

946
01:06:13,806 --> 01:06:15,797
Rod. There you go.

947
01:06:15,908 --> 01:06:17,136
Thanks, Rod.

948
01:06:17,242 --> 01:06:20,006
All right, thanks, guys.
And don't let your dads eat pie.

949
01:06:20,112 --> 01:06:21,807
Hey, Kev.

950
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,908
- Have you seen Denise anywhere?
- No, I haven't seen her all day.

951
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:33,019
- What was that?
- We just hit a raccoon.

952
01:06:33,592 --> 01:06:35,423
Jonathan, don't you think
we should stop?

953
01:06:35,527 --> 01:06:38,189
Oh, trust me, babe. That raccoon
would not have stopped for us.

954
01:06:38,297 --> 01:06:39,457
Are you serious?

955
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:42,898
Oh, my God. I can't wait to tell Sullivan.
He'll be so psyched.

956
01:06:46,338 --> 01:06:49,796
I'm gonna grab a Vitaminwater.
Should I make that dos?

957
01:06:50,108 --> 01:06:51,473
No, thanks.

958
01:06:51,577 --> 01:06:52,908
Coolio.

959
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:55,342
Hey, maybe I'll get a box of dong bags

960
01:06:55,447 --> 01:06:57,312
so we can knock boots later,
what do you think?

961
01:07:00,352 --> 01:07:02,946
Truly a momentous day for listening

962
01:07:03,155 --> 01:07:06,784
as stuntman Rod Kimble
will jump 15 buses

963
01:07:06,892 --> 01:07:08,985
in a last-ditch effort
to save his stepfather.

964
01:07:09,094 --> 01:07:10,425
My oops, forgot my wallet.

965
01:07:10,529 --> 01:07:12,429
Jonathan, Rod's doing the jump.

966
01:07:12,531 --> 01:07:14,590
Oh, my God, who cares?

967
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,725
Babe, why do you hang
with those nerds?

968
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:18,802
I like those nerds.

969
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:21,099
Well, guess what?
You're embarrassing yourself.

970
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:25,198
It's only embarrassing if you care
what people think.

971
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:26,971
That's a good one. I like that.

972
01:07:27,846 --> 01:07:30,246
- Babe?
- Goodbye.

973
01:07:30,516 --> 01:07:32,416
Babe, wait. Babe, wait.

974
01:07:32,518 --> 01:07:35,612
Babe, wait! Babe!

975
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:38,383
Babe, wait! Babe. Babe. Babe.

976
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:41,288
Babe! Babe, wait. Babe, no!

977
01:07:41,393 --> 01:07:43,293
Babe, no! Babe, no!

978
01:07:43,462 --> 01:07:47,831
Babe!

979
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:51,630
Babe, babe, babe! No, babe!

980
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:52,994
Wait!

981
01:08:03,048 --> 01:08:04,208
No way.

982
01:08:04,316 --> 01:08:05,783
You're gonna look
like a champion, Rod.

983
01:08:05,884 --> 01:08:08,182
You guys, this thing is number one.

984
01:08:08,287 --> 01:08:10,278
- Wait, Rod, there's more.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

985
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:13,017
We were worried that the moped
might not be fast enough

986
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:15,252
to clear the jump, so...

987
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:19,761
No way.

988
01:08:22,668 --> 01:08:23,635
Whoa.

989
01:08:24,036 --> 01:08:26,163
Dave, this thing is number one!

990
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:29,297
Now, I know she doesn't look like much,
but trust me, man.

991
01:08:29,408 --> 01:08:32,036
- She's got some kick. A lot.
- All right.

992
01:08:32,144 --> 01:08:33,338
There's one more thing, Rod.

993
01:08:33,445 --> 01:08:36,414
I know how you like explosions
and showmanship and stuff.

994
01:08:36,515 --> 01:08:38,676
So, I rigged the whole jump
with fireworks.

995
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:39,944
Cool.

996
01:08:40,052 --> 01:08:42,885
And I got you this rock to represent
all my hard work.

997
01:08:42,988 --> 01:08:45,013
Oh, cool, Rico.

998
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:47,589
That's number one.

999
01:08:47,693 --> 01:08:51,151
Yeah, you can pretty much just toss
that after the fireworks go off. It's cool.

1000
01:08:51,263 --> 01:08:52,491
Thanks.

1001
01:08:53,398 --> 01:08:54,422
Thanks, all of you.

1002
01:09:33,505 --> 01:09:37,134
Okay, everyone. It's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1003
01:09:37,242 --> 01:09:41,008
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Rod Kimble!

1004
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:07,400
He's going in circles!

1005
01:10:11,443 --> 01:10:12,432
Rod!

1006
01:10:13,612 --> 01:10:14,943
Rod!

1007
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:21,152
Rod!

1008
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:34,260
Who wants to see me do
a big-ass stunt?

1009
01:10:41,273 --> 01:10:43,468
Ladies and gentlemen.

1010
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:45,743
What is destiny?

1011
01:10:46,344 --> 01:10:47,834
What is fate?

1012
01:10:48,346 --> 01:10:52,484
I dedicate this jump to fathers
and father figures everywhere.

1013
01:10:53,051 --> 01:10:59,615
I hope that in some small way
all of their sons manage to jump them.

1014
01:10:59,725 --> 01:11:03,161
Frank, I'm gonna get you better,
you old sack of shit.

1015
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:08,824
And then I am gonna uncork the
ass-beating of a lifetime on you!

1016
01:11:08,934 --> 01:11:11,459
And you will respect me!

1017
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:12,730
Peace!

1018
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,110
Kimble clearly has a few issues
with his stepfather there.

1019
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,450
But who doesn't? I know I do.

1020
01:11:35,293 --> 01:11:36,555
You got this, man!

1021
01:11:36,661 --> 01:11:40,153
Just remember.
Drive really, really, really fast, okay?

1022
01:11:40,265 --> 01:11:42,426
And hold on tight! You'll be fine!

1023
01:11:42,534 --> 01:11:44,798
I'm so nervous for you!

1024
01:11:44,903 --> 01:11:47,895
And everybody here is!
We're nervous for you!

1025
01:11:48,006 --> 01:11:49,132
I was just in the bathroom,

1026
01:11:49,241 --> 01:11:52,802
and everybody's talking about
how crazy this is.

1027
01:11:52,911 --> 01:11:54,105
- Okay.
- Don't worry about it.

1028
01:11:54,212 --> 01:11:56,806
You're gonna do great!
Now go kick those buses' ass!

1029
01:11:59,284 --> 01:12:01,775
You good?

1030
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:06,757
Do you like stunts?
What about terminally ill stepfathers?

1031
01:12:07,192 --> 01:12:09,353
Well, if you answered yes to one
or both of those questions,

1032
01:12:09,461 --> 01:12:13,454
you couldn't have picked a better day
to stumble upon KNER radio.

1033
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:37,554
Hey, Rod!

1034
01:12:37,656 --> 01:12:39,248
Denise. You came.

1035
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:41,757
Of course.

1036
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:42,986
Oh, wow.

1037
01:12:43,094 --> 01:12:44,391
Yeah.

1038
01:12:45,931 --> 01:12:48,832
- Denise, I don't know what I'm doing.
- What?

1039
01:12:48,934 --> 01:12:52,028
I mean, this jump is huge. I could die.

1040
01:12:53,338 --> 01:12:55,363
You're the bravest guy I know, Rod.

1041
01:12:57,342 --> 01:12:58,832
I don't know what to believe anymore.

1042
01:12:59,711 --> 01:13:01,770
Believe in this.

1043
01:13:10,956 --> 01:13:12,218
Oh, wait.

1044
01:13:12,324 --> 01:13:13,951
What? You don't...

1045
01:13:14,059 --> 01:13:17,358
No, I do. I do. I just...

1046
01:13:17,462 --> 01:13:20,761
- Your mouth was all open.
- Oh, God.

1047
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:23,198
It was just like...

1048
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:24,627
Anyways.

1049
01:13:29,441 --> 01:13:33,172
Oh, whoa, wait, what?
Why is Rod kissing his sister, man?

1050
01:13:33,278 --> 01:13:35,678
Denise isn't his sister.

1051
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:38,248
- She's not?
- No.

1052
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,511
Man, that shatters my entire universe.

1053
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:42,849
I'm not saying
that kiss was hot, listeners,

1054
01:13:42,954 --> 01:13:47,084
but if the boner police are here,
I demand a lawyer!

1055
01:13:47,192 --> 01:13:50,025
- Good luck, Rod.
- Thanks.

1056
01:13:53,999 --> 01:13:57,230
All right, swing man. Back in business.

1057
01:13:57,335 --> 01:13:59,462
Hey, how are you?

1058
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,806
Kimble's preparing
for his final approach.

1059
01:14:06,912 --> 01:14:11,440
Ascending the multiple ramp levels
to the tippy-top.

1060
01:14:41,947 --> 01:14:44,438
Why'd the numbers stop?

1061
01:14:44,549 --> 01:14:46,983
I guess people wanna see
what happens.

1062
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:52,923
Souls of the animal kingdom.

1063
01:14:53,024 --> 01:14:59,520
Eagle, fox, bottlenose dolphin,
octopus, house cat.

1064
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:03,430
Okay.

1065
01:15:03,535 --> 01:15:05,196
Let's jump this jump.

1066
01:15:11,843 --> 01:15:13,640
Come on, Rod!

1067
01:15:18,249 --> 01:15:19,443
Here he goes.

1068
01:15:20,919 --> 01:15:24,582
He's driving the bikey-thing
with his hands and legs.

1069
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:26,919
This needs to be seen to be believed!

1070
01:15:27,926 --> 01:15:31,384
Three, two, one, liftoff!

1071
01:16:04,262 --> 01:16:06,696
Oh, he's like a broken doll.

1072
01:16:13,671 --> 01:16:15,138
Oh, this does not look good.

1073
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,265
Rod's crew is running to his side.

1074
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:19,900
I, for one, hope none of them had a fight
with Rod this morning,

1075
01:16:20,011 --> 01:16:22,206
because he is more than likely dead.

1076
01:16:22,347 --> 01:16:23,974
- Rod.
- Oh, no.

1077
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:27,784
- Rod, are you okay? Can you hear me?
- Step aside, please.

1078
01:16:27,886 --> 01:16:30,377
Rod, stay away from the light, man.
Don't go towards that light.

1079
01:16:31,823 --> 01:16:33,848
Rod?

1080
01:16:38,563 --> 01:16:39,552
Oh, God, he's probably having

1081
01:16:39,664 --> 01:16:42,497
some sort of profound,
out-of-body experience.

1082
01:16:56,381 --> 01:16:57,507
Hi.

1083
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:06,419
Oh, yes. Yes.

1084
01:17:10,228 --> 01:17:11,286
Yes.

1085
01:17:12,464 --> 01:17:14,523
- I'm not getting any vitals.
- Oh, Rod.

1086
01:17:17,435 --> 01:17:18,493
Rod?

1087
01:17:18,603 --> 01:17:20,195
Finish him! Finish him!

1088
01:17:20,305 --> 01:17:21,966
Yes, taco!

1089
01:17:23,641 --> 01:17:25,734
Rod? Rod?

1090
01:17:25,844 --> 01:17:27,141
Denise?

1091
01:17:27,245 --> 01:17:28,712
Hoobastank.

1092
01:17:28,813 --> 01:17:30,610
He's alive.

1093
01:17:32,117 --> 01:17:34,915
Denise. You were right.

1094
01:17:35,019 --> 01:17:36,008
The taco won.

1095
01:17:37,288 --> 01:17:39,813
Okay, Rod. Okay.

1096
01:17:39,924 --> 01:17:40,948
Time to get up.

1097
01:17:41,059 --> 01:17:43,892
- No, no, Rod, don't move. Don't move.
- You could have internal injuries.

1098
01:17:43,995 --> 01:17:46,862
Sorry, guys. I'm walking out of here.

1099
01:17:46,965 --> 01:17:50,457
No, no, no. No, no, no, Rod.

1100
01:17:50,568 --> 01:17:51,592
Wait a minute.

1101
01:17:51,703 --> 01:17:55,867
It appears Kimble is awake,
and he's trying to stand up.

1102
01:17:55,974 --> 01:17:58,374
Seriously, you're probably
hurt pretty bad.

1103
01:17:58,476 --> 01:18:00,103
I'd say definitely, Kevin.

1104
01:18:00,211 --> 01:18:03,305
I'd wager 10 to 20 broken bones,
minimum.

1105
01:18:04,916 --> 01:18:06,406
But life is pain

1106
01:18:06,518 --> 01:18:10,318
and we've got to scrape the joy out of it
every chance we get.

1107
01:18:10,421 --> 01:18:12,855
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

1108
01:18:13,758 --> 01:18:15,123
Rod.

1109
01:18:15,393 --> 01:18:18,419
Rod! Rod! Rod!

1110
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:22,364
The crowd is cheering Kimble
back to life.

1111
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:26,227
Rod! Rod! Rod!

1112
01:18:28,873 --> 01:18:33,276
Rod! Rod! Rod!

1113
01:18:42,487 --> 01:18:44,978
And the phones are ringing off the hook!

1114
01:18:55,433 --> 01:18:59,369
Rod. Rod, look. Look.

1115
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:13,881
We did it!

1116
01:19:17,922 --> 01:19:19,014
They've done it!

1117
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:24,425
They've raised $50,000
for Frank's conveniently-priced surgery.

1118
01:19:30,535 --> 01:19:32,435
Rod, Rod! Over here!

1119
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:34,129
We did it, Richardson!

1120
01:19:34,839 --> 01:19:36,807
Rod knows my name.
Rod knows my name.

1121
01:19:36,908 --> 01:19:37,966
Rod knows my name!

1122
01:19:38,076 --> 01:19:40,909
People are screaming
and jumping up and down.

1123
01:19:41,012 --> 01:19:43,207
The fairgrounds are literally shaking!

1124
01:19:44,816 --> 01:19:47,751
A cooked goose for everyone!

1125
01:19:47,852 --> 01:19:49,786
It's Ebenezer Scrooge!

1126
01:19:49,887 --> 01:19:52,685
Yes, a cooked goose.

1127
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,823
Dave.

1128
01:20:29,794 --> 01:20:33,252
- Rod, do you really need to do this?
- Yes.

1129
01:20:33,364 --> 01:20:35,855
Come on, Rod. The doctor said
his heart's even stronger than before.

1130
01:20:35,967 --> 01:20:37,229
You're not gonna win.

1131
01:20:37,335 --> 01:20:39,496
Kevin, it's not up for discussion.

1132
01:20:41,806 --> 01:20:45,264
Gods of war!

1133
01:20:45,376 --> 01:20:47,844
May your hammer be mighty

1134
01:20:50,848 --> 01:20:52,110
Here I am, Frank.

1135
01:20:53,785 --> 01:20:57,346
Get ready to meet your maker. Oh, God!

1136
01:20:57,455 --> 01:20:59,184
We hadn't even started yet!

1137
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:01,383
Never underestimate your opponent.

1138
01:21:07,365 --> 01:21:11,165
What's up now, Frank?
I'm doing this because I love you!

1139
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,811
- Never underestimate your opponent.
- Well, well, well.

1140
01:21:20,912 --> 01:21:26,077
Finally, a fight I might actually...

1141
01:21:27,251 --> 01:21:29,811
- Got you.
- What the hell? Is that a throwing star?

1142
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,214
Oh, hell, yeah, Roddy! Kick his ass!

1143
01:21:58,316 --> 01:22:00,614
Come on, old man! Come on!

1144
01:22:00,718 --> 01:22:03,551
Old man, young heart!

1145
01:22:05,456 --> 01:22:06,650
Good Lord!

1146
01:22:08,393 --> 01:22:11,726
Oh, shit. No mercy.

1147
01:22:12,597 --> 01:22:14,360
Guys, come on, come on. That's rented.

1148
01:22:16,934 --> 01:22:18,367
Jesus Christ.

1149
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:21,700
He just rocked him with a brick!

1150
01:22:22,573 --> 01:22:23,699
Oh!

1151
01:22:25,209 --> 01:22:26,335
Here we go.

1152
01:22:28,179 --> 01:22:30,477
- Should we stop them?
- Oh, no, they're fine.

1153
01:22:36,721 --> 01:22:39,281
- Oh, no.
- Say it, Frank!

1154
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:41,722
- Say I'm a man.
- Never.

1155
01:22:45,329 --> 01:22:48,162
- Say it!
- You're a man.

1156
01:22:48,266 --> 01:22:49,563
Say it again!

1157
01:22:50,802 --> 01:22:53,430
You're a man, son.

1158
01:22:58,042 --> 01:23:00,211
You've gotta be kidding me.

1159
01:23:00,411 --> 01:23:01,844
Yeah!
