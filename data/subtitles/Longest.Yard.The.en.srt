1
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,600
Hey, sexy.

2
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,200
I love that dress.

3
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Of course you do, Lorenzo.
You made it.

4
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,800
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, guys.

5
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,500
- There you are.
- Lena.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
- You have done it again.
- Well, it's all for you, Bradlee.

7
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,700
Got to mingle.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,600
Oh, the girls are by the pool.

9
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,300
Well, well, well, Lena. So where's
this sexy boy toy of yours hiding?

10
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,200
I didn't know you were
a football fan, Patrick.

11
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,000
I have never watched a game. I am just
a big fan of his old underwear ads.

12
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,800
Well, he's probably just getting out of
the shower. Let me go hurry his ass up.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,200
- Hi.
- Hey, babe.

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,400
Start of the fourth quarter, and Owens
will throw. He's got Brown wide open.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,700
You have got to be kidding me.

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,800
Honey, just let me finish the game,
I will take you to the movies.

17
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,800
Take me to the movies?

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,200
Hello. There's a huge party
going on downstairs.

19
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,500
Remember the catering trucks
and the valet parkers?

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,600
Oh, shit, I forgot.

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,500
I will tell you what
you should forget about.

22
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Football.

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,500
Because it's forgotten all about you.

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,200
Now, you're going to put this outfit on
that I bought you,

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,100
drag your drunken ass downstairs

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,200
and mingle with my clients
like a good boy.

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Who am I? Elton John?
I ain't wearing that shit.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,500
- Yes, you are.
- I am not your trained monkey, honey.

29
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,600
No. You're much more
expensive than that.

30
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,400
But I tell you what.

31
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,200
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes,

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,300
I am going to throw you out of my bed,

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,500
out of my house and out of my life.

34
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,400
Then you're going to have to
pay for your own bananas.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,600
I am just so mad at you
because you're not wearing my gift.

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,400
Gift?

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,900
What gift?

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,800
It's like a I-love-you gift.
I left it in the closet for you.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,600
Really?

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,600
Paul, I am so excited.

41
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,400
I can't believe you did this.

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,300
- Where'd you put it?
- In the back, on the right.

43
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,000
Paul? Paul, what are you doing?

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,200
I think we need some
alone time, honey,

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,100
so I am going to go take a cruise
in your Bentley.

46
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,500
Don't you dare take my car,
you drunken bastard.

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
- I own you.
- I love you.

48
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,700
Somebody please open
this damn door. Patrick?

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,100
- Lena?
- Patrick.

50
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,300
What happened to you?

51
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,300
He locked me in the closet
and left me to die.

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,800
Oh, my God, he is deranged.

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
He thinks he can mess with me.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,300
911.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,700
Oh, man.
Here come the party poopers.

56
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,400
Well, well, well. I will be damned.
If it isn't Paul Crewe.

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,200
So, what did I do wrong?
Was I driving poorly?

58
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,800
Nope. Nope.
This car was reported stolen.

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,200
No, no, no.
It's actually my girlfriend's car.

60
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,900
Shit happens.

61
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,200
Shit does happen. I mean,
look what happened to your ears.

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,200
I got to ask you something.
Does he get XM Radio with those?

63
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,500
Actually, they get
a couple of channels.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,900
It's Paul Crewe.

65
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,400
Another question, though.

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Santa Claus. What's he like?

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,500
Boy, I hate to arrest a public figure
like yourself,

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
but, hell, I don't think
you got too many

69
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,000
endorsement deals to worry about,
now, do you?

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Now, listen here, Mr. Frodo.
Don't get short with me.

71
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,800
That was good. I mean, he's good.

72
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,500
Man. I hope you got a lot of money
for that game you threw,

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,900
because that was the most pathetic
thing I ever saw.

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,100
Now, step out of the vehicle,
Mr. Crewe.

75
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,900
Don't you think I should pull the car
over more? I could get sideswiped.

76
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,900
You're slurring your words a bit there,
Paul. You been drinking tonight?

77
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,300
Absolutely not. Now, could you do me a
favor? Hold this beer while I back it up.

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Hey, you can finish that one.
I got five more. Take care, guys.

79
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
We got a 3-94 in progress.

80
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,100
Okay, remain calm.

81
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,200
How you doing? What's up?
What's up? What's up?

82
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,300
What you are watching is live footage
of a vehicle, apparently stolen,

83
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,900
being pursued by police.

84
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,900
We're receiving word now
that the driver of that vehicle

85
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,900
is former Pittsburgh football star
Paul Crewe.

86
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,500
Crewe, you might remember,

87
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,200
was the only man ever to be indicted
on federal racketeering charges

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,700
for shaving points
in a professional football game,

89
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,400
although it was never fully proven.

90
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,800
Yeah.

91
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,500
- Hello.
- Do not get one more scratch

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,100
on my car, or I will slit your throat.

93
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,300
See, that's our problem, sweetie.

94
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,900
You care about this car
more than you do us.

95
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,800
And how'd you even know
there was a scratch on this baby?

96
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,700
Because I am watching you on TV,
as is the whole country.

97
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,600
Once again,
you are proving to everyone

98
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,200
what a worthless piece of shit
you are.

99
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Well, I hope they like this.

100
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,900
Hey, Lena.

101
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,500
I think we should start
seeing other people.

102
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,100
I think I am in love.

103
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,000
Good news, boys,
I didn't spill my beer.

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,100
Without question, Crewe's five-year
federal probation for point-shaving

105
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,200
has been severely violated tonight.

106
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,700
The future of this once-great football
star looks very dark indeed.

107
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,000
Long way from the big city,
huh, superstar?

108
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,700
Staying with the times
around here, huh?

109
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,500
Ain't she beautiful?

110
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,900
Home sweet home, boy.

111
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,300
Get on your feet.

112
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
You're one lucky son of a bitch,
Crewe.

113
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,500
- Is that right?
- That's right.

114
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,800
See, the warden loves his football.

115
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,000
Fact, he was on the winning side
of your little thing.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,100
- Well, tell him congratulations.
- But I wasn't.

117
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,900
Welcome to Allenville.

118
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,900
Thank you, sergeant.
I will take it from here.

119
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,100
- Afternoon, inmate Crewe.
- Yeah.

120
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,200
Come on. Warden wants to see you.

121
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
Let's do it.

122
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Move it.

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
I used to play
a little college ball myself.

124
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,500
Down at the University of Miami.

125
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,000
I bet a lot of your old teammates
are locked up in here.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,400
No inmates from my playing days.
Couple of guards, though.

127
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,300
See, we got us a fine
prison-guard league down here.

128
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,100
It's like a company softball team.

129
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,400
Now, the warden...

130
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,300
...he's going to ask you to help out.

131
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay. With what?

132
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,700
That wasn't nice.

133
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
When the warden asks you,

134
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,700
what are you going to say?

135
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,300
Yes?

136
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,400
You're going to tell him "no."
You got it?

137
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,200
You're going to tell the warden

138
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,600
that you want nothing to do
with his football fantasies.

139
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Not in my back yard.

140
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,700
Because the warden
don't run this prison. I do.

141
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,000
You understand?

142
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,800
Not entirely.

143
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay. I feel you, dog. I feel you.

144
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,700
Paul "Wrecking" Crewe.

145
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,800
I don't get to say this
to my new guests very often,

146
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,400
but it's an honor to have you
here at this institution.

147
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,800
It's an honor to be
locked up here, sir.

148
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,600
Oh, well, this is Errol Dandridge.

149
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,200
Colonel Sanders
been eating his own chicken.

150
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,900
He's my political adviser.

151
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,900
See, I have been approached
by several very influential people

152
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,200
wondering if I'd be interested
in standing for governor.

153
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,800
They see the way I run this prison,
think maybe I should run this state.

154
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,500
Only with less sodomy, right?

155
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
Hopefully none.

156
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,800
Sorry.

157
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,300
Now, there are two things we take very
seriously here in the state of Texas.

158
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,500
Prison and football.

159
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
We play a little of the latter here.

160
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,800
The warden is too modest to admit
that his team is rather good.

161
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,500
But not good enough.

162
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Five years since
our last championship.

163
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,700
Five years.

164
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,800
Now, I have worked real hard,
pulled strings,

165
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,200
called in quite a few favors
to get you here, Paul.

166
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,200
Now, why would you go and do that?

167
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,800
Because I am convinced that
you can get us back on track.

168
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I haven't played football and I don't
know how long. I don't really want to.

169
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,600
You wouldn't be playing, Paul.
Just consulting.

170
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,300
Anyone who was once the MVP
of the National Football League

171
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,000
must have a great deal
of expertise to offer.

172
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,800
Captain, what would you say
to Mr. Crewe looking in,

173
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,400
giving us the benefit
of his experience?

174
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,600
I think that's a real good idea, warden.
We can use all the help we can get.

175
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,500
Well, then, it's all settled.

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,100
What you say, Paul?

177
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
I appreciate the offer,
but I am going to have to pass.

178
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,800
Now, I can assure you

179
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,900
that your time here will be a whole
lot easier if you just participate.

180
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,300
I just want to do my time
and go home. Nothing else.

181
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,800
If you will excuse us, Mr. Crewe.

182
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,400
Captain Knauer, you can stay.

183
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,000
Sit down.

184
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,300
I used to love
your underwear commercials.

185
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,500
Thank you very much.

186
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,700
My ex-husband wore the
same brand of tighty whities.

187
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,700
He didn't fill them out
quite as well as you, though.

188
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,500
Special effects. Hollywood.
Not all me.

189
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Oh, I doubt that very seriously.

190
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Well, then get him enthusiastic,
damn it.

191
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Come on, get up.

192
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,900
How'd it go in there?
We all set now?

193
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Oh, yeah, we're real tight.

194
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,200
Only the finest for you, superstar.

195
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
I was just playing.

196
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,400
I ain't going to forget you, Crewe.

197
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,600
Hey, yo, you owe me money
on that game, punk.

198
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Better watch yourself, Mr. Football.

199
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,700
Bitch.

200
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,900
Yeah, you better run, woman.

201
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,200
Yo, football.

202
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,200
Take a seat.

203
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,200
Thanks.

204
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,100
You know, I have never seen
one inmate just walk in here

205
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,200
and be unanimously hated
by the entire population.

206
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,700
- I ain't never seen it.
- How'd I get so lucky?

207
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
You could have robbed banks,
sold crack,

208
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,300
stole your grandmama's pension,
and nobody would have cared.

209
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,900
But shaving points off a football game?
Man, that's just un-American.

210
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,200
- You play football?
- Me? No.

211
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
I suck so bad, they used to pick me
after the white kids.

212
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,000
Used to be mad too. It's like, "I can't
believe I picked a nigga that can't play."

213
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,100
- Caretaker.
- Paul Crewe.

214
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,700
Whatever your pleasure,
I can facilitate.

215
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,100
You need weed, you need meth...
Hey, you need Prozac, I am your man.

216
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,200
I know how you white boys
always deal with that depression.

217
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,600
I mean, me personally, I don't
understand what you white boys

218
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,700
all depressed about.
Hey, you're white. Smile.

219
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,000
And for a small fee,
I can even get you McDonald's.

220
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,800
- Really?
- Yeah, that's right. Mickey D's.

221
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
My man Cheeseburger Eddy
got the hookup.

222
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,800
Cheeseburger Eddy?

223
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,700
That's right.
We can get our McFlurry on.

224
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,500
Enjoy it, fat man.

225
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,800
What about the love
of a beautiful woman?

226
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,200
Well, you're going to have
to lower your standards

227
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,500
on the beautiful part
and on the woman part.

228
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Hey.

229
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,500
Let's just stick
with the cheeseburgers.

230
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Oh, they ugly now, but in eight months,
he going to look like Beyonce.

231
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,900
No, thanks.

232
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,000
Now, here's the most important part.

233
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,400
You can't let these guys scare you.
You can't let them punk you.

234
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,300
Because if you do that, you going to
end up being somebody's bitch.

235
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,100
Don't want that.
Thanks for the advice.

236
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,300
Hey. Let me take that tray
out for you.

237
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,000
I ain't done eating yet.

238
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,900
Oh, you're not?
I will give it back to you, then.

239
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,500
You're dead.

240
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,900
Hornet's Nest.

241
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,300
Everybody stay down.

242
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
Stay quiet.

243
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Come on, Crewe, get up.

244
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,900
Get up, superstar.

245
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,800
Yes, sir.

246
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,000
You think you can do anything
you want around here, don't you?

247
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,700
Well, you are no different
than any other piece of shit

248
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,500
that calls this place home.

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,500
Really? These guys think
you're a dumb redneck too?

250
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,500
Girl, that's your new boo.

251
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,500
You better cut that shit out.
It's getting old.

252
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,900
That's going to cost you.

253
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
Looking forward to it.

254
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.

255
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,900
Hey, superdick.

256
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Warden's wondering if your stay
in the hotbox has changed your mind.

257
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,900
How long have I been in here?

258
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,500
One week. Want to go for two?

259
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
How'd you find these guys anyways?

260
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,100
Recruitment, boy.

261
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,500
When college stars don't get drafted,
they need a place to go.

262
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,600
A job, money, security.

263
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,400
Who drank all the damn Gatorade?

264
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,300
Damn it.

265
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,000
And apparently steroids.

266
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Look, seems like you got all the talent
you'd want. So why do you need me?

267
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Well, now, you might
find this hard to believe,

268
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,700
but there's folks here in the prison
league don't care for me very much.

269
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,900
- You, warden?
- They thought it might be amusing

270
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,600
to schedule the defending
league champs as our first game.

271
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,300
And me? Well, I thought
an old pro like yourself

272
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,200
might have some training-camp tricks,
drills, insights to offer up.

273
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,000
Give us the competitive edge.

274
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,200
All right. Relatively simple.
You need a tune-up game.

275
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,300
A tune-up game?

276
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah. In college, we'd start every
season against Appalachian State

277
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,700
or some slack Division II team.

278
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,000
Kick the living shit out of them.
Get their confidence up.

279
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,000
You know something, Paul?

280
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,400
- You have just given me an inspiration.
- That's great. What?

281
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,500
You're going to assemble a team
to play the first game against us.

282
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,900
And you, Mr. Crewe,
are going to be the quarterback.

283
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,300
I don't think so.

284
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,800
Let me tell you something.

285
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,900
In my prison, to get along,
you got to go along.

286
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,100
I just want to do my three years
and be done.

287
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,000
Three years is before
you assaulted Captain Knauer.

288
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,200
Now, you could be with us
for a very long time, Mr. Crewe.

289
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,700
Fine, I will do it.

290
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Good choice.

291
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
But one condition, though.

292
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Got to promise me to keep
Captain Knauer off my back.

293
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a deal.

294
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,700
Now, you got four weeks
to assemble a team and train them.

295
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,000
What, are we going to have a half-hour
a day to practice with a Nerf ball?

296
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,600
Oh, I will make sure my boys allow you
sufficient freedom, within these walls,

297
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,600
to get your team in shape.

298
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,700
- What's this? 
- "Football tree-outs."

299
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,200
What the hell is a "tree-out"?

300
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
"Tryout," you half a meatball.

301
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
- What's this football thing about, man?
- Crewe's getting a team together.

302
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,900
- To play against who?
- The guards.

303
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,600
Now, I don't know about you all,
but I occasionally have the impulse

304
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,500
to physically assault one of our
finer correctional officers.

305
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,800
Yeah? Well, how the hell
we going to get to do that?

306
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,700
Just show up at the "tree-outs,"
you big, dumb bitch.

307
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,500
Do the girls get to play?

308
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,400
We're playing footballs,
not balls-balls.

309
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,700
This is bullshit. Just another chance
for the guards to beat on us.

310
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,800
Don't you idiots get it? We could get
a free shot at the guards.

311
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,400
This is our turn.
We could beat up on them.

312
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,100
We could kill them.

313
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
Kill them.

314
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,900
You know MVP
sold his own teammates out.

315
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,100
What do you think
he's going to do to you fools?

316
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,700
And that's the truth.
With some cheese on it.

317
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,300
There ain't no meat loaf
between these buns.

318
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,800
Yo, man, that's my flier, man.
I worked hard on it.

319
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,000
You see? He ran like a little bitch,
right? You saw that, right?

320
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Yo, team needs you.
Team needs you.

321
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,600
You sh... You come to the tr...
Come to the tree-outs.

322
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,300
Crappy field, shit-ass equipment...

323
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Hey, man, at least we got some
world-class players over there.

324
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,300
Forty-five.

325
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Forty-six.

326
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,600
Forty-seven.

327
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,900
He might make the team.

328
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,400
Well, if we got to cut him,
you're doing it.

329
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,200
Forty-nine.

330
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,600
Fifty.

331
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,900
- All right, man.
- Good job, man.

332
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
Well, well, well.
You a football player?

333
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,600
Oh, no. I never played
no football, mister.

334
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,800
So, what happened? You read the flier,
thought it looked like some fun?

335
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,600
- Oh, I can't read.
- Oh, don't worry.

336
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Reading's for rich people.

337
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
So you know, we're putting together
a football team. Love you to join.

338
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,600
Will you teach me to football?

339
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,900
Sure we will teach you to football.
Won't we, Caretaker?

340
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,200
Hey, I will teach you anything.
Just don't eat me.

341
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
Okay.

342
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Down, Shrek. Down.

343
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,100
Okay, bring it in. Whoever's trying out
for the team, wake up.

344
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,700
Can you give a brother
a little hustle?

345
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,600
Very good.

346
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,200
For those of you who don't know
who I am, I am Paul Crewe.

347
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,300
I am going to be your coach,
your captain, your quarterback.

348
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,400
You haven't played in years.
Why can't I be quarterback?

349
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,500
- You're right. Let's see what you got.
- All right.

350
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,700
- Hit me, I am open.
- Hike, hike. Hike.

351
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,000
That's why.
Now, sit down and shut up.

352
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It slipped. I just ate popcorn.

353
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,300
Question: Any of you gentlemen
ever play football before?

354
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,000
- You did? Where?
- Kansas State.

355
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,200
Are you shitting me?
For Coach Snyder?

356
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,000
Kansas State Prison.

357
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,200
Now, I hear they have
the softest mattresses out there.

358
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,700
Yeah, they do.

359
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,000
Not as soft as the ones
at West Texas Mental Institution.

360
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,700
- Really?
- Let's finish this conversation later.

361
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,900
For now, I want to see
what you got out there.

362
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,200
We will grade them
on a scale of one to ten.

363
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
Move it. Hustle, hustle, hustle.

364
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,500
Give these guys sixes.
Give these guys fives.

365
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,000
Good. Good.
Give them threes.

366
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,500
Very nice.

367
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
- Aren't we missing somebody?
- Where's the Kansas State guy?

368
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,400
You assholes better not cut me.
I am still on this team.

369
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
Negative two.

370
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,700
All right, go with negative two.

371
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,000
Hey. Somebody bring me
a Diet Coke.

372
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,100
- Let's do this.
- That's it.

373
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,200
Five.

374
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,600
Good. Seven.

375
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,500
Stupid tire. You're a fricking tire.

376
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,800
You think you're better than me?
I will kick your ass.

377
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,100
Three.

378
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
And a half?

379
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,500
Yeah. That's better.

380
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,100
Okay. Good.

381
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,300
Yeah. Hit that bag, man.
There you go, man.

382
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,500
Four.

383
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,400
- Five. I don't know.
- I go.

384
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,300
Come on, Switowski.

385
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,500
Daddy.

386
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,800
Oh, man.

387
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,900
- Look at that.
- He got it off the hinge.

388
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,600
- I think that's a ten.
- Let's go with a ten.

389
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,000
I am sorry. I "brokeded" your toy.

390
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,200
No, that's a good thing. You should
have a victory hug with Caretaker.

391
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,100
What? What you
talking about, man? Hey.

392
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,400
Asshole.

393
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,800
Okay, fellas, it's pretty simple.
You do a buttonhook.

394
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,400
The rest of you guys block for me.
I will take care of the rest.

395
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,600
Okay? On "go." On "go."

396
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Ready? Break.

397
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,800
We will work on that.

398
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,100
Okay, half speed on this one, guys.
Slow and easy.

399
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,200
Ready?

400
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
Go.

401
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,900
Stop it.

402
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,200
Stop the violence.

403
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,800
Can't we all get along?

404
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
- Hey, Paul.
- Unger.

405
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,100
- Team's looking great.
- Oh, yeah.

406
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
- So are you.
- Yep. Working on it.

407
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,100
The blood of the guards is going to flow
like the rivers of ancient Babylon.

408
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,600
That's good news.
Unger, you're the man.

409
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,400
Good job today. You're all starting
to look really sharp out there. Yeah.

410
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,800
See you tomorrow.

411
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,300
- We're going to suck.
- Yeah. No doubt about it.

412
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,800
You look like
you could use a little help.

413
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,200
No offense, my man,
but you're a little seasoned.

414
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,300
Seasoned?

415
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,700
I am not asking to play. I will coach.
I am Nate Scarborough.

416
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
Nate Scarborough?

417
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
The Heisman Trophy winner
from Oklahoma?

418
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,700
The inmate from cellblock D.

419
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,200
But about a hundred years ago,
when I could run and gun,

420
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,100
yeah, I was a Sooner then.

421
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,900
I heard you were dead.

422
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,000
No, I ain't dead.
I have been right here, rotting.

423
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,700
Waiting for a chance to get back
at those sadistic guards.

424
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Waiting. For this.

425
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, coach, as you can see,

426
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,800
we don't exactly have the cream
of the crop to work with here.

427
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,200
Well, what are we going to do?
How are we going to find players?

428
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,500
How'd they get you
to go to Florida State?

429
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
They recruited me.

430
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,600
I will get the strippers.

431
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,800
Well, now, Lindsay, this isn't
about credit or congratulations.

432
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,700
This is about giving men
who have made mistakes in their lives

433
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,100
an opportunity
to rise above themselves.

434
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,000
To move beyond
the bars of containment.

435
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Say what?

436
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
What I would do to you.

437
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,700
Yeah. Nice boot, skin man.

438
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,000
Hey, why does he get to be
the kicker? I was All-State, man.

439
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,900
Let's see what you got.

440
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,700
That's why, you dumb-ass.

441
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,600
Just go do some laps.

442
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,500
I heard you boys needed to see me.

443
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,400
Yeah. I want you to meet Skitchy.

444
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,100
Hey, dog.
Check that building over there.

445
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,500
They keep all the records
in the basement.

446
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,900
He's been here so long,
he knows where everything is.

447
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,100
That ain't necessarily
a good thing, is it?

448
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,900
I had a parole date in '86.
But I got in a tussle with a guard and...

449
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,400
One punch and it went away.

450
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Twenty extra years for one punch?

451
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,300
Well, unfortunately for him,
the guard he punched

452
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
just happens to be the warden now.

453
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,200
Oh, shit. Warden Hazen?

454
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,500
"Oh, shit" is right.

455
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,800
Fight in the yard. Send backup.

456
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,700
Right on time.

457
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

458
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,000
Ain't you guys glad you got
a black man for a friend?

459
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,800
- Hell, yeah.
- Come on.

460
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,200
Hazen has a rating system
for every con.

461
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,700
What's three stars?

462
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,500
The more prone to violence that the
inmate is, the more stars he gets.

463
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,100
Five stars is the max.

464
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,700
I didn't know that. Let's see how many
stars my maniacal ass got.

465
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,500
Half a star? That's got to be a mistake.
Check it again. Check it again.

466
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
You're about as maniacal
as a boxful of kittens.

467
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,800
Come on, that's not funny, man.

468
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,500
I am going to have to stab somebody
or something. Get my rep up.

469
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,800
Why don't we have a maniacal pillow
fight tonight. That could get it up some.

470
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Yeah. We can sell it to pay-per-view.

471
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Superstar Versus Half-a-Star.

472
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Why don't you shut up before I slit your
throat and watch the dust come out.

473
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,800
Come on, guys,
we only got a couple minutes.

474
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,400
How about this guy?

475
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,300
Damn, this fool got the chair
three times, ain't died yet.

476
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Well, we may not have
the most talented team,

477
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,800
but we will definitely
have the meanest.

478
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,800
- What's he doing that for?
- Because he's a freak.

479
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,100
Hey, Sasquatch.
Someone's here to see you.

480
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,300
Not too smart on your part.

481
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,200
Hey.

482
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,900
How's the headbanging coming?

483
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,300
You're bleeding. Just so you know.

484
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,000
People have told me that
you and I look a lot alike,

485
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,400
so I wanted to see for myself.

486
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,000
I am going to take a piss.

487
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,500
You scared him away, dumbshit.

488
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,800
You're kidding. Five-star Torres
likes The View?

489
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,200
No, just Joy Behar.

490
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,100
The good news is she can
breast-feed standing up. That's it.

491
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,300
Where does she come up
with this shit?

492
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,600
I am a Star Jones man myself.
I love that big bitch.

493
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,700
That was, like, the furthest thing.

494
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,400
I got married so young, so, I mean,

495
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,800
they weren't pressuring me,
the society was pressuring me...

496
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,500
Mr. Torres.

497
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,000
Us convicts are starting up
a football team.

498
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,500
Not interested.

499
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,300
We're playing the guards.

500
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,400
Walk away.

501
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,500
Good idea.

502
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,400
0 for 2.

503
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,600
You're putting the pressure
on her right now.

504
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,200
Show's over, amigo.

505
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,600
I still got 15 minutes of Joy Behar.

506
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,100
Well, I am cutting you short.
Back to your cell, asswipe.

507
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,600
Hey, white boy.

508
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,000
Cherryhead going to play?

509
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,100
Yes, he is.

510
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,700
Crewe, don't forget,
I am going to be open.

511
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,600
Green 40. Hut.

512
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,000
Damn.

513
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,100
Brucie. Brucie. You all right?
You breathing?

514
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,500
I got a bird. His name is Ronnie.

515
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,400
Well, tell Ronnie you got
knocked the fuck out.

516
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,400
Wow, no bullshit. Real football?
Against the guards?

517
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,700
Full contact.

518
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,500
Captain Knauer is their quarterback?

519
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,700
- Yep.
- So I get to tackle him?

520
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,600
Yeah. You can either tackle him or hit
him over the head with that hammer.

521
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,400
I want to hurt him. Not kill him.

522
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Let's get out of here
before that thing bites somebody.

523
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,000
All right. We will see you
and your pet iguana at practice.

524
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,800
Down, set.

525
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,300
Hut. Hut.

526
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Hey.

527
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,600
- Hit me.
- Get rid of it.

528
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,000
Get rid of it.

529
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,100
He didn't get rid of it.

530
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,300
Sacked your ass.

531
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
Somebody's got to get open, guys.

532
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
You got hammered by the hammer.

533
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,300
I think I felt it on my leg.
We got to get some speed, man.

534
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
What'd you expect?
You got no brothers out there.

535
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,200
What are you talking about?
We got Switowski.

536
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,200
Switowski? That's one brother.

537
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
That's a lonely nigga.
This ain't hockey.

538
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
You want some speed,
you know where to go.

539
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,500
Hey, yo, check out
this fake Slim Shady, man.

540
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,100
I knew you couldn't resist my shit.

541
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,400
I got the shakes
that will make you quake.

542
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,300
I got the fries that will cross your eyes.

543
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,900
I got the burgers that will......

544
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,100
I just got burgers.

545
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,300
I am all right. Thank you.

546
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,500
Just wanted to talk to you fellas about
possibly joining the football team.

547
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,700
The only game we'd play with you is

548
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Slap the Point-Shaving White Boy
Till He Cries Like a Baby-Back Bitch.

549
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,800
Baby-back bitch, baby-back bitch
Baby-back bitch

550
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,100
- That's a big-ass robot.
- Yeah.

551
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,700
You going to help me out here?

552
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,900
Thank you, Half-a-Star.

553
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,700
Just so you know,
we are playing the guards.

554
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,600
That ain't a team.
That's just a bunch of dumb rednecks

555
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,100
giving themselves excuses
to grab each other.

556
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,300
This guy must be
quite the athlete, huh?

557
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,300
You risk bringing your ass in the jungle
because you know I am.

558
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,600
Yeah, so you'd beat me
in a game of one-on-one, right?

559
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,700
- What?
- I think it's time for you to get stepping.

560
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,900
How's this, though? One game.

561
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,200
I beat you, you guys play for the team.
You beat me, I will leave you alone.

562
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,100
Take that. Take that, Deac.

563
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,400
This fool ain't nothing
but a thing, baby.

564
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,800
- Ball, dog.
- Ball up.

565
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,300
Can Crewe play ball?

566
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,700
He's a natural athlete.

567
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,000
So is Greg Louganis, but I bet you
he'd get his ass whupped out here.

568
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,800
- Game's 11. Call your own fouls.
- Okay.

569
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,200
- Come on, come on.
- Give it to him, Deac.

570
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Did I get you?

571
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,900
No, that was clean.

572
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,900
He will be all right. Call his mama.

573
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,500
- If I foul you, tell me, dog.
- Okay, baby.

574
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,800
Take this f... Take this foul.

575
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,200
What happened there?
I think it's my ball, right?

576
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,300
All right.

577
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,200
Get up. Get up, Deac.

578
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Come on, Paul.

579
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,800
- Calm down.
- What?

580
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,300
Now, don't stir up
the brothers, now. Come on.

581
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,200
Come on, Deacon.

582
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,500
Did I get you, dog?

583
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,400
Hell, no, baby. That was clean.
Good D.

584
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,900
I thought he didn't want to get hurt.

585
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,600
It ain't about getting hurt.
It's about pride.

586
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
I bet you he's pretty proud right now.

587
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,000
It ain't easy being cheesy.

588
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,100
Did I get you? Did I get you?

589
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,800
- No, I think I am okay, baby.
- I didn't get you, did I?

590
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,600
That's traveling, bitch.

591
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,600
You keep coming, huh?

592
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Game point, baby.
How you want the game put up?

593
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Foul.

594
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
That was a bullshit call.

595
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,300
My court, my ball.

596
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,200
All right, you all. Let Deac speak.

597
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,300
Nice spanking that ass, dog.

598
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,200
- Now, get stepping.
- Hold up.

599
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,300
You all got a running back?

600
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,400
Not any good ones.

601
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,100
No disrespect, Deac...

602
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,700
...but any man that can take
that kind of beating out here,

603
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,400
I can't wait to see what he can do
in a contact sport.

604
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,600
Shit, I am in.

605
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,400
Man, give me that cheeseburger.
You acting like a real McAsshole.

606
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,800
Cheeseburger, he wants to run
with the white boys, we will let him.

607
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,500
Let's do this.

608
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,300
Earl Megget.

609
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,500
Well, we didn't get the whole chocolate
bar, but we got a Hershey's Kiss.

610
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,800
I will take it.

611
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,300
Let's get this over with, rookie,
I am starving.

612
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,000
Fresh meat, boys. Fresh meat.

613
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Down, set.

614
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,800
Battle, you're a psycho.

615
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,000
Tony, you're a fat shit. Hut.

616
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,500
Holy shit.

617
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,600
Get him.

618
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Ran right out of your shoes, huh?
Hey, manager, don't you think

619
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,500
we can get our new star running back
a decent pair of cleats?

620
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,700
Yeah. I think I got a cousin
that drives a truck for Reebok.

621
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,200
It's cool, man.
I never had shoes growing up noway.

622
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,000
- I will be all right for now.
- Oh, okay.

623
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,600
Get your country ass
back in the huddle.

624
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,300
That boy got some slave feet,
you see that?

625
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Defense. Huddle up over there.

626
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Paul. Paul.

627
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,700
Hey, ladies. How's it hanging?

628
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,900
- Tell him.
- I am going to say something to him.

629
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,900
I just wanted to let you know
I am your biggest fan.

630
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,000
And I will be cheering my jailhouse
boobies off for you at game day.

631
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,600
I appreciate that. Thank you.

632
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,200
Paul.

633
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,700
I appreciate you.

634
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Okay, thanks. I am glad to know that.

635
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Okay, are you done now?

636
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,100
What's wrong with you? Jealous
because I don't cheer for you anymore?

637
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,400
I don't know what
you're talking about, freak show.

638
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,200
Whatever, back freckles.

639
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,000
Oh, yeah, back freckles.
She's making up shit now.

640
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,500
I am going to get some water.

641
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,200
That feature interview
worked better than I thought.

642
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,500
I just got off the phone with ESPN2.

643
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,300
They want to televise
the football game.

644
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,900
Guards, cons, Paul Crewe,
it's compelling stuff.

645
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,100
Lots of human interest.

646
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,000
Don't do that in here.

647
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,500
Television.

648
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,700
Dandridge, do you think
that might help my visibility

649
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,800
with the registered voters
of this fine state?

650
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,500
Oh, yes.

651
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,100
The freak is back.

652
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,300
Hey, hey. It's me again.

653
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,500
You know, if I take this half down,
we could play together.

654
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,600
I am just going to take this half down.

655
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,400
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I got another ball.

656
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,800
It's okay.

657
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,800
You want to serve?

658
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,300
I will serve.

659
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,700
Really good news.
We started a football team.

660
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,500
You like football?

661
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,100
It's kind of like Ping-Pong.

662
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,500
Only the ball's a little bigger
and egg-shaped, like my head.

663
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,500
Just a joke. Stay calm.

664
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,300
Give you a good chance
to throw people on the ground,

665
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,600
hurt them like you used to when you
were a kid, 10 feet 6 inches ago.

666
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,800
We'd be playing the guards.

667
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,000
I think Papajohn's their safety.

668
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,300
Turley, nobody gets to me.
We will play more Ping-Pong later, okay?

669
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
Hut.

670
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,700
Effective.

671
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,800
- All right.
- He brokeded my nose.

672
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,500
I don't want to play no more.

673
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,800
Hey, hey, hey. Switowski,
what are you talking about?

674
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,600
This is football. Shit happens.

675
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,300
Paul, he brokeded my nose.

676
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,900
Okay. Stop crying.

677
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,000
All right. We can fix this.
Here we go.

678
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,500
Okay. Good, good.

679
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
How's it look?

680
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,700
How's it look? It looks... It looks like...
It looks better than before.

681
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,600
- Really?
- Yeah, it's straighter.

682
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,800
More distinguished.
Kind of like a young Michael Jackson.

683
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,100
I love little Michael.

684
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,900
That's great. That's great.

685
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,800
I think he did it on purpose.

686
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,900
No, he didn't.

687
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,400
Okay, maybe he did.

688
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,400
You got to apologize to him.
Come on, Turley.

689
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,500
Say you're sorry.

690
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,900
Come on. Say it.

691
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,800
He said he's sorry.
I got him to say he's sorry.

692
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,500
Yeah, yeah. We're all impressed.

693
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,400
Looking good, gentlemen.
Way to work hard.

694
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,600
Good practice, Paul.
Me and the girls want to show you

695
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,000
- what we have been practicing.
- Okay, hit me.

696
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,200
- What we have been practicing.
- Okay, hit me.

697
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,500
Come on, let's go. One, two, three.

698
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,400
Give me a...

699
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,800
D, D, give me a I
I, I, give me a C

700
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,900
C, give me a...

701
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,300
All right, all right. I got it.
Just save it for the game.

702
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,300
Don't act like you ain't
want to see more, Brucie.

703
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,500
- Yeah, you wish, pal.
- No, you wish I'd kiss you again,

704
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,500
because your breath
smell like eight cans of shark shit.

705
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,200
I wouldn't touch her
with a 10-foot pole.

706
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,900
- What's he talking about?
- He's a freak.

707
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,200
Run, Forrest, run.

708
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,900
That's how a white man plays guitar.

709
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
Captain, he said he had some info.

710
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,800
You guys have "Halo 2."
I didn't even think that was out yet.

711
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,300
Focus. Turn the music off.

712
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,500
Yeah, captain.
You know them convicts?

713
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
They're starting to get
some serious players.

714
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,700
But their biggest threat?
A running back. Megget.

715
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,200
- He's good?
- He's fast.

716
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,600
He's really, really fast.

717
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,700
I mean, he's so fast,
he makes fast people look not fast.

718
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,200
I got it, he's fast.

719
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,100
Now, why don't you show us your speed
and get your pyro ass out of here.

720
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,700
Yes, sir. Here I go. I am sorry.

721
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,500
Any books
you'd recommend, inmate?

722
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,200
No, sir.

723
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,700
Not much of a reader.

724
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,200
Oh, come on, now, maggot.
I have seen you in here reading before.

725
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,500
You requested this detail.
Isn't that right?

726
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,200
No. It's the quiet time I like, sir.

727
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,300
Maybe you'd like to read this.

728
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,500
What the hell kind of bullshit
book is that?

729
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,900
It's historical. Sir.

730
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,600
Now, why would he want to read
a book about a four-eyed nigger?

731
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,900
Does the N word
offend you, nigger?

732
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,200
No, sir.

733
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,000
Sorry about that.

734
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,100
You mind fetching
these books for me, boy?

735
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,200
No, sir.

736
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,300
Just pick them up.
Put them on the table.

737
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,900
There you go.

738
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,100
You forgot one.

739
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,100
Bet you'd like to hit us, huh?

740
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
Hit you, sir? No.

741
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,400
You all my friends.

742
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,500
Pick these up.

743
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
Go.

744
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,400
Hit me. I am open. I am open.

745
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,000
Come on. We got one week
before we play that game.

746
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,600
We can't complete a pass yet.

747
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,100
- Megget can't run the ball every play.
- I know, coach.

748
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,500
What the hell is he smiling at?

749
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,400
This better be on the up and up.

750
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,500
I guarantee it.

751
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,300
Let's do this shit.

752
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,000
There goes the neighborhood.

753
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,400
Now I will never get to play.

754
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,400
Did you see that? Did you see that?
The Deac is here.

755
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,700
Nice.

756
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,600
Okay, we seal off here, seal off here.

757
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,200
- Cheeseburger.
- Yeah.

758
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,000
You're just going to chip this guy...

759
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:01,200
That stings.

760
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,800
It's nothing a Quarter Pounder
can't fix.

761
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,500
With cheese on it?

762
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,200
Hut.

763
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,900
Man, that boy would catch a cold
in the desert. Here you go.

764
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,700
- Everything's looking up.
- Yeah.

765
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:40,100
Still got one more
pain in the ass to deal with.

766
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,000
All right, what do you say?
How about a little best ball?

767
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,100
No, I hate that bullshit.
Everyone play their own damn ball.

768
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,000
Holy shit, is that Paul Crewe?

769
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,800
How do you like that, boys?
The MVP coming to kiss my ass.

770
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,700
So, what's on your mind, Paul?

771
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,500
Got a problem with inmate Unger.

772
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,500
- Is he on your little squad?
- I believe he's on your little squad.

773
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,900
Mr. Crewe, would you mind
if we had a picture? Please?

774
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,900
That's up to the warden.

775
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,800
- Damn it. All right.
- Rewound it. Did everything.

776
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,400
- The flash is ready.
- You don't need a flash. It's daylight.

777
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,600
Oh, my bad.
I just want a good picture.

778
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,300
You know, I think you had sex
with my wife before I married her.

779
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,200
- Sorry about that.
- Oh, hell, no.

780
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,200
If she's hot enough to have
a one-nighter with a pro football player,

781
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,100
I must be doing all right.

782
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,100
Okay, here we go.

783
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
- Sergeant Engleheart?
- Yes, warden.

784
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Would you step out
of the picture, please?

785
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,500
Yes, sir.

786
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,300
- His wife has got the hottest ass.
- Great.

787
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,700
Just cut to the chase, shall we?

788
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,900
You don't actually think you have
a chance of winning, now, do you?

789
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,700
We're going to get
our asses handed to us.

790
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:58,100
I know it. You know it.
I just don't want my players to know it.

791
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,700
Your players?

792
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,900
Just when I thought
I had you all figured out.

793
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,000
- What does that mean?
- In the time you have been here,

794
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,200
you haven't made or received
one telephone call.

795
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,800
You haven't opened so much
as a single shred of mail.

796
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,200
What do you give a damn
about those slimeballs?

797
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,400
You never cared about anybody
in your entire life.

798
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Well, maybe I finally found
that sense of family

799
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,500
I been yearning for since I am a baby.

800
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
And gosh almighty,

801
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,600
my new family and I
would sure appreciate it

802
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,100
if you got Unger off the field.
You hear?

803
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,800
Sergeant Engleheart.

804
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,500
Thank you.

805
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,600
Oh, and as for your request...

806
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,900
...you will have my answer
soon enough.

807
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,000
Did it rain last night?

808
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,400
Not a drop.

809
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,800
Son of a bitch.

810
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,800
All right, boys.

811
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,900
The warden is trying
to break our spirit.

812
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,500
He thinks we're going to
skip practice today,

813
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,200
wait for the field to dry,
make it up tomorrow.

814
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,600
You know what? Who gives a shit?

815
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,500
Three days till game time.
We can handle it.

816
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
But let me say this:

817
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,800
That old man flooding this field
tells me something.

818
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,200
The guy is scared.

819
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,700
Scared of you sick,
degenerate convicts.

820
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,500
And you know what?

821
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,300
He should be.

822
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,500
Because I got news for you guys.

823
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,000
We're going to win this thing.

824
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,000
Did he say "win"?

825
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,400
What's it going to be, boys?

826
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,600
Do we go back to our cells,
call it a day?

827
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,700
Or do we get ourselves ready
for the greatest ass-kicking fiesta

828
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,900
in the history of football?

829
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,500
I will leave it up to you guys.

830
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,900
Hey. You're part
of the goddamn team.

831
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,600
Get your point-shaving ass in there.

832
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,500
You got it.

833
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,700
I guess that asshole Hazen
wants to play dirty.

834
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,800
- We all convicts, right?
- Right.

835
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,800
Maybe it's time
we started acting like it.

836
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,900
Right here. Right here.

837
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,000
Take it, Deac.

838
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Let's see which guards
have some broken bones.

839
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,600
Yeah.

840
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,200
Shoes, nigga.

841
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,400
Check this out. These be brass
knuckles. They damn near old as me.

842
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,000
Hut.

843
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,100
That's perfect, Cheeseburger.
Never been better.

844
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,400
Good ball. Good ball.

845
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,600
Okay.

846
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,000
- Who we going to crush?
- The guards.

847
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
- Who we going to kill?
- The guards.

848
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,100
- Who we going to kiss?
- The guards.

849
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,200
Gotcha.

850
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,400
Lights out.

851
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,700
Good night, ladies.

852
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,300
- Yo, Crewe.
- Yes, Mr. Caretaker.

853
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,700
Check your toilet. There should be
a little surprise in there for you.

854
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,700
You took a shit in my toilet?

855
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,400
No, that's the surprise
I left in Brucie's toilet.

856
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,900
- You got something else.
- All right.

857
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,200
Well, would you look at this.

858
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,100
A bottle of Ketel One
and two glasses?

859
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,600
Now, what would I need two for?

860
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,700
Just shut up
and pour me a drink, bitch.

861
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,200
- Man, who taught you to be so cool?
- My mama.

862
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,600
Now, when I get out of here, I don't
want you to get all Hollywood on us.

863
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,100
I want you to meet her.

864
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,300
Here, look at my girl.
She's your biggest fan.

865
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,700
Your mom's beautiful.

866
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,800
And you, you are ugly.

867
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,000
Thank you. Got it.

868
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,800
Here's to...

869
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,500
...the first friend I have had
in I don't know how long.

870
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,800
Hey, I thought
I was your friend, Paul.

871
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,900
You are, Switowski. Just finish your
coloring book and go back to sleep.

872
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,000
Okay.

873
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,900
And here's to having one of these
with you on the outside,

874
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,400
sometime in the next
three to five years.

875
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,000
- Yo, Crewe.
- Yes, sir.

876
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,600
You being a ex-football player
and all,

877
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,700
I am sure you got a lot
of hot ass on the outside.

878
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,900
Well, let's not forget I wasn't
the most popular guy out there.

879
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,000
Don't give me that shit.

880
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,200
O.J. Chopped his wife's head off
and still got some ass.

881
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,300
Yeah.

882
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,500
My mama taught me not to kiss
and tell. Now, go to sleep.

883
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,600
All right. I got one more question
to ask you.

884
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,700
Okay. What is it?

885
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,900
Why'd you shave those points?

886
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,700
Didn't you read the papers?
I am innocent.

887
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,100
Yeah. Ain't we all?

888
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,000
Yo, Crewe, what would you say

889
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,200
if I could get you film
from the guards' games last year?

890
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,600
I would say that's incredible,
but how?

891
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,700
Thanks, gentlemen.

892
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,300
The warden will be done with him
in 15 minutes.

893
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,000
- We can handle him.
- Yes, ma'am.

894
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,900
Then you're going to, ma'am.

895
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,600
Nice job.

896
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,600
I can't tell you how much this means
to me. Thank you, Lynette.

897
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,100
Now Nate can study
all the guards' formations.

898
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,000
Not so fast, sugar bear.

899
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,200
You got to earn them.

900
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,200
We only got 15 minutes,

901
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,200
but, sunshine, we're going to
make them all count.

902
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,200
One more, please?

903
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,600
Let's go.

904
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,900
- Quiet down. Guys.
- Let's go.

905
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,900
Before we watch the guards'
game film from last season,

906
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,300
we have a special presentation
from our very own Mr. Paul Crewe.

907
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,800
What are you talking about?

908
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,600
What's going on?

909
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,900
Now I got to relive this shit?

910
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,000
Yeah.

911
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,700
You can say this,
my man's a team player.

912
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,500
You know what they say. Once
you go gray, there ain't no other way.

913
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,600
Hey, hey, hey. Brucie. Brucie.
I am glad you think that's funny,

914
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,800
because I got something pretty funny
to show you guys.

915
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,300
Tony, hit it. You're going to like this.

916
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,700
- What the hell is this?
- What? It's good. It keeps going.

917
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,000
- Hi.
- Here I am.

918
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,800
Turn this shit off. Turn it off.

919
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,700
No.

920
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very funny.
Trick photography.

921
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,800
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

922
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,800
I was showing a little wrestling move.
That's all.

923
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,500
Knock it off.

924
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,000
Knock it off.

925
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,700
It's time we took a look
at what we came here to see

926
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,800
before the guards come back.

927
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,400
The first film is the guards' offense
against Texas Southern.

928
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,700
Now, as you can see,
they're running a standard wishbone.

929
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,000
So you're telling me that these animals
are watching our game films.

930
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir, boss.

931
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,600
They got all last season.

932
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,900
Seems to me that we ought to
do something about this.

933
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,700
What do you want me to do?

934
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,900
You're the criminal. Be creative.

935
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,200
But on game day, if I so much as...

936
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
What are you doing?

937
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,700
I don't know.
I have had hot flashes all shift,

938
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,100
and now my nipples are killing me.

939
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,900
Why are we talking about
your nipples?

940
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,700
We're not. Just go do
what you're doing there.

941
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,300
Guys.

942
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,300
I want Crewe finished.

943
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:15,400
Yes, sir. You give me the inspiration,
sir. I got something for him.

944
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,800
Hut.

945
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,900
Everybody.

946
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,600
Huddle up.

947
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,900
Every day we have been taking shit,
for a long time.

948
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:41,100
Tomorrow, payback.
Now, think about that for a second.

949
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,300
- What time is it?
- Game time.

950
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,000
- What time is it?
- Game time.

951
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,600
- What time is it?
- Game time.

952
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,700
Tomorrow, 12:00, the bus leaves.
Don't be late.

953
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,800
Where the hell is Caretaker?

954
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,600
I don't know.

955
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,000
A gift for you, Mr. Crewe.

956
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,300
How does he listen
to that cracker shit?

957
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,000
We're here deep in the heart
of toothless country,

958
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,700
coming to you from a simple
Texas high school stadium

959
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,000
that's been retrofitted
for the big event.

960
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,500
Now, when my man Travis
tried to drag me out here, I said,

961
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,000
"What are you, brain-dead from
talking to too many Raider fans?

962
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,100
It's not going to work."

963
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,300
But the fact of the matter is,
this could shape up as an epic day.

964
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,500
Hot-dog vendors, high-powered rifles,
I love the combination.

965
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,100
And apparently so do the fans.

966
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,000
Hey, shitheads. Listen up.

967
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,900
Everybody on their feet
for the warden.

968
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,500
Anthony, wow. You can sit down.

969
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,900
Thank God.

970
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:23,200
Gentlemen, Texas marshals
have been kind enough

971
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,800
to supply us with a dozen
of their finest sharpshooters.

972
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,600
So for those of you thinking
of mingling with the civilians

973
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,300
or trying to make a break for it,

974
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,200
you will be shot.

975
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,900
In the head.

976
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Now, let's all go out there
and have some fun.

977
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,300
Crewe. I will see you on the field.

978
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,400
I think he's in love with you.

979
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,300
All right, listen up.

980
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:00,200
I know it's hard to get psyched for
the game without Caretaker being here.

981
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,500
But somehow that sick,
skinny bastard

982
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:07,500
found a way to get us all fired up
from beyond the grave.

983
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,000
Caretaker's last gift to us.

984
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,700
Battle, I presume this is yours.

985
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,600
I still don't think that's big enough.

986
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,200
- That's it?
- No, that ain't it.

987
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,900
Caretaker said he'd find us
some gear to wear.

988
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,300
I think he found us a name too.

989
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,600
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

990
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,200
Good afternoon and welcome to a
very special edition of ESPN football.

991
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,600
As today, the semipro
Allenville Federal Prison guards

992
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,300
will be taking on the very prisoners
they guard.

993
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,800
And with this special game, folks,
comes a special broadcast,

994
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,200
as I am joined in the booth
by Baby Face Bob.

995
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,000
Say hi to the folks, Bob-O.

996
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,300
Chris, we went to a commercial.

997
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,500
This job, Bob,
it's a lot of give and take.

998
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,400
So when I bring you in,
don't be afraid to talk to the folks.

999
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,600
Unless you don't want to.

1000
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,300
And here come the cons,

1001
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,300
led by former NFL MVP quarterback
Paul Crewe.

1002
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,800
Holy shit. Hey, hey, hey.

1003
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,600
Well, hello. How are you?

1004
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,200
Back away from the girls.

1005
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,400
- Hey, now.
- Call me.

1006
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,900
What the hell
are you dressed up for?

1007
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:52,500
Hey, I didn't spend 14 years
in the joint just to watch this game.

1008
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,400
And there in the
high-security bleachers

1009
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,900
are the good-behavior cons,
along with their...

1010
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,100
...cheerleaders?

1011
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,200
We're the mean machine
Don't mean to dis you

1012
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,900
We're going to kick your ass
And then we will kiss you

1013
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:07,800
Hey. Ho.
What?

1014
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,700
I didn't do it.

1015
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,300
Come on, Batt.

1016
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,000
- What's that?
- Did you see that?

1017
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,700
Damn it.

1018
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,700
Papajohn's at the 20, the 10.
And he will score.

1019
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
Sweet dreams, bitch.

1020
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,500
That's a 90-yard return.

1021
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:02,300
And I got to tell you, the cons seem
more interested in hitting the guards

1022
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,100
than tackling the ball carrier.

1023
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:09,000
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
Thanks for picking me up from school.

1024
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,500
And here comes the big story
of the day.

1025
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,000
Paul Crewe,
serving a three-year sentence,

1026
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,400
hasn't played since he was banned
from the NFL six years ago.

1027
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,600
Center, shift it. Shift it.

1028
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,400
Hey, Sasquatch.

1029
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,200
Twenty, hut.

1030
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,500
Crewe drops back to pass.
Turley's leaving him unprotected.

1031
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,300
Fumble.

1032
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,200
Holy shit.

1033
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,500
Goddamn it.

1034
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,100
That's going to be a personal foul
on the big guy.

1035
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,000
And this is certainly an inauspicious
start for the cons.

1036
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,400
Come here. All right. You got him.
Now, protect me.

1037
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,000
Let's go. Hold them.

1038
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:00,900
And here comes Knauer and that
big offensive unit for the guards.

1039
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,600
Eighty-six.

1040
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,400
Back to your cell.

1041
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,100
Hut. Hut.

1042
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,400
Knauer has Potter wide open.
Touchdown, guards.

1043
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,900
- Son of a bitch.
- And in the first 90 seconds,

1044
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,200
the guards are up
by two touchdowns.

1045
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,500
This one looks like
it could be over early.

1046
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:30,200
Sorry.

1047
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:33,200
What are we celebrating for?
It's 14-nothing.

1048
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,600
You guys want to beat these assholes,
do it on the scoreboard.

1049
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:40,800
Are you okay? Oh, God,
you're not hurt, are you?

1050
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,700
Jesus, you sound like my mother.

1051
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:47,300
Listen, if you want to cry,
you go ahead and cry. I will cry with you.

1052
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,300
Get off me. Get back out there
and kick some ass.

1053
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:53,400
Why are you yelling at me?
All I did was care.

1054
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,600
Look. A broken leg will heal.

1055
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,600
A loss to the Mean Machine
lasts forever.

1056
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,100
Sorry, guys.

1057
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,000
Yeah, yeah. Me too.

1058
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,000
All right. Now, let's get started.

1059
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,000
Now, get the hell out there. Let's go.

1060
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,800
Way to go. Way to go.

1061
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,600
There's the first sign of life
from the cons.

1062
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,500
Let's see if Paul "Motley" Crewe
can make something happen.

1063
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,600
Hut.

1064
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:41,600
On first down, Crewe will throw.
He's got Deacon wide open.

1065
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,400
That's got to be pass interference.

1066
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:47,400
But the ref is waving it off.

1067
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,600
- What?
- Oh, come on.

1068
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,100
Come on, now. I am in this hellhole
for less than that.

1069
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:54,900
- Be a man and make a call.
- You're right.

1070
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,500
Unsportsmanlike conduct.
Eighty-eight black.

1071
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,900
What?

1072
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,000
Come on.

1073
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,400
This is baby-back bullshit.

1074
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,300
- Bullshit, D.
- Calm down. Let it go.

1075
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,400
Let's call that one
a questionable call.

1076
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,300
Blue 42, hut.

1077
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:16,600
The give is to Megget. He spins
to the outside. Megget has room.

1078
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,100
He's at the 35. The 40.

1079
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
He's brought down hard,
by his facemask.

1080
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,400
What? Oh, come on, man.
That was a facemask.

1081
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:29,600
- You're not going to call that?
- I saw a clean tackle, sir.

1082
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,700
What you looking at?
Are you serious?

1083
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,000
Tell it to the parole board, criminal.

1084
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,100
I mean, this is absurd.

1085
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:38,600
We can't win with the refs
on the payroll.

1086
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,700
Listen up. I got an idea
to end all this bullshit.

1087
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,200
Come on, let's all stay up. Come on.

1088
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,300
Down, set.

1089
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,700
Red 58.

1090
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,200
Cover your man.

1091
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,400
Red 58. Hut.

1092
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,800
That one hurt my marble sack.

1093
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,200
All right.

1094
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,100
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1095
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,700
- What down is it?
- Fifth.

1096
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,000
- No, no. It would be fourth down.
- Okay.

1097
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:22,000
What do you think?
Should I go for the left nut this time?

1098
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,400
Underneath. Let's go.

1099
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,500
Ref, you got to get in the game.
Right over here.

1100
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,700
Well, I don't quite get this, but on fourth
and 22, the cons are going to go for it.

1101
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,300
Down, set.

1102
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,000
Red 58.

1103
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,600
Red 58. Hut.

1104
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,900
You got to always protect
the McNuggets.

1105
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,900
How about from now on, you call
a fair game? How's that sound?

1106
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,200
Sounds good.

1107
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:56,300
Okay. Wet Willie.

1108
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah, you like that.

1109
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,700
And so the guards will take over

1110
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:08,300
after one of the strangest
offensive series I have ever seen.

1111
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:11,500
Okay, boys. We know who doesn't
have any balls out there now.

1112
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,100
Have we got any?
Have we got some balls?

1113
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:17,700
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go kick some ass.

1114
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:20,600
Come on, Swit, stand them up, baby.

1115
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,400
White 50. White 50. Hut, hut, hut.

1116
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,900
Knauer, play action.
Here comes the blitz.

1117
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,300
Switowski is so big, it's like being
tackled by a Coke machine with legs.

1118
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,400
This is fun.

1119
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,700
Nice to see you smiling, Bob.

1120
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,900
Thanks, Chris.

1121
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,700
Green 90. Hut.

1122
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,300
Third and 5,
and the give is to Megget.

1123
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,900
He's to the 40,
where he will come up short.

1124
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,600
But look at Turley push the pile.

1125
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,000
And now Crewe.

1126
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,600
And that's a first down.

1127
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:00,200
And look out. Boy, somebody better
take control of this game soon,

1128
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,500
or they're going to need body bags
on the sidelines.

1129
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:03,700
Let's go, guys.

1130
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,000
Start of the second quarter.

1131
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,100
Cons still down by two touchdowns,
but they finally have some momentum.

1132
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,600
Hut.

1133
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,000
Crewe with a shovel pass to Megget.

1134
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,900
And Megget scrambles
for a first down.

1135
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,000
Oh, you fooled me.

1136
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
- I got you there, didn't I?
- You did.

1137
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,700
You know, Engleheart, you are
the best-looking guy on your team.

1138
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:28,200
You know, Paul, in the midst of all this,
for you to say something like that is...

1139
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,400
Come on, let's go. Let's go, D.

1140
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,600
First and 10 at the guards' 35.

1141
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,600
Crewe dumps it over the middle
to Deacon Moss.

1142
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,800
And he's hammered at the 17 for a
13-yard pickup, and that's a first down.

1143
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,000
- Hut.
- Crewe, trying to get his team

1144
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,600
on the scoreboard.

1145
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,800
He will throw.

1146
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,600
And it's caught by Deacon Moss
for a touchdown.

1147
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:53,800
All right.

1148
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,900
And so there will be no shutout today,
as the cons are on the board.

1149
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,600
Quit booing, people.
Both teams are trying very hard.

1150
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,100
What the hell's wrong with you?
Stop acting like a damn cheerleader.

1151
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,400
- Sportsmanship, try it.
- Shut up.

1152
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,200
Damn.

1153
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,400
2:11 left in the first half.
And Dunham is back in at fullback.

1154
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,300
And he is a load, at 6'2", 260.

1155
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,600
Dunham, breaking tackles.

1156
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,500
He refuses to go down.

1157
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:28,800
But he finally does
after a 15-yard gain.

1158
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,400
That's how a white man
runs a football.

1159
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,200
If I was on D, I'd crack you square
in that egg-ass head of yours.

1160
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,100
Yeah, but you ain't on D.
Are you, bitch?

1161
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,700
Switowski. Come here.

1162
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,300
Do you know what
he said to me in the library?

1163
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,500
Yes. Him. Out.

1164
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,700
D, D, defense
D, D, defense

1165
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,000
The cons don't seem to have
an answer for Dunham,

1166
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,600
who's averaging close to 12 yards
a carry this half.

1167
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,300
Green 67.

1168
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,200
Green 67. Hut.

1169
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,100
Oh, what a hit on Dunham
by Switowski.

1170
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,900
I think I made him shit himself.

1171
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:21,100
- Shit.
- I think he just shit himself.

1172
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,600
I think he just shit himself.

1173
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,200
Good Lord.
This guy shit himself bigtime.

1174
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:30,600
See? I told you
I made him shit himself.

1175
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,100
Yo. I will make sure I send
them books to the hospital, pimp.

1176
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,800
And some diapers.

1177
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,000
Nineteen seconds.
We got a lot of ground to cover.

1178
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,500
So you bastards remember
that play we practiced in the mud?

1179
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,400
What are you talking about?
That was some schoolyard bullshit.

1180
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,500
Yeah. Let's try some
schoolyard bullshit.

1181
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,600
Come on, D, let's go.

1182
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,600
Down, set. Green 88.

1183
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,200
Green 88. Hut.

1184
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:00,900
The clock starts to run. Crewe hands
the ball to Megget. It's a reverse.

1185
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,200
Cheeseburger Eddy's got it.

1186
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,000
Go, baby, go.

1187
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,500
He laterals to Deacon.

1188
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,000
Tackle him.

1189
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,400
To Turley.

1190
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,100
The clock is running. To Brucie.

1191
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,300
Shades of Cal-Stanford.

1192
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,900
Back to Crewe.

1193
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,300
He tosses to Megget.

1194
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,400
Tackle him.

1195
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:28,900
And look at that little Megget run.

1196
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,800
Three seconds left.

1197
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,900
Yeah. Go.

1198
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,900
He could go all the way. Touchdown.

1199
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,400
Did you see that?

1200
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,900
Do that sound again.

1201
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,100
I like that.

1202
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,200
And so, on a miraculous play,

1203
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:59,200
the cons end the first half
with the score: 14-all.

1204
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,700
Bring it in.

1205
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,600
Do you have any idea
who's beating you out there?

1206
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,800
This was supposed to be a blowout,

1207
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:15,300
and they're showing you up
in front of the whole nation.

1208
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,900
The whole nation.

1209
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,500
I like it when he's angry.

1210
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,200
- I told you.
- Way to go, baby, way to go.

1211
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:34,100
What in the hell do you think
you're doing out there?

1212
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,800
Playing football, sir.

1213
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,200
I didn't say nothing about winning.

1214
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,700
We're not winning. Not yet.

1215
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,000
You got yourself in quite
a predicament, Mr. Crewe.

1216
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,600
- Is that right?
- See, it's just come to my attention

1217
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,800
that inmate Unger
has been taken into custody

1218
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,300
for the murder of Caretaker.

1219
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,800
- Good.
- Oh, yeah, it's good.

1220
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:59,500
Only thing is, he claims
to have an accomplice.

1221
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,600
Claims you knew all about it.

1222
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,900
Hell, he even says
you sent Caretaker to your cell.

1223
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,200
Bullshit.

1224
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,400
Captain Knauer says
he saw you planning it with Unger.

1225
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,400
There's no way
that could hold up in court.

1226
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,500
Court?

1227
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,500
Hell, boy, in Allenville,
I am the judge, I am the jury,

1228
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:24,700
and in your particular case,
I am the executioner.

1229
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,500
What do you want?

1230
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,600
I want you to lose.

1231
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,000
I can't do that.

1232
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Of course you can. After all,
you have had plenty of practice.

1233
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,500
But the men. It's more important
to them than it is to you.

1234
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,700
Okay. Suit yourself.

1235
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,300
Spend the next 25 years
of your useless life in prison.

1236
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,100
All right, I will do it.

1237
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,600
But I don't want my guys hurt.
You get ahead, you coast. We clear?

1238
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,400
Fine. Right after I get
a two-touchdown lead.

1239
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,600
I tell you what bothers me
the most, warden.

1240
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,300
That you're not going to be
out there on that field with us,

1241
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,300
getting what you got coming to you.

1242
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,000
The only thing coming to me
is victory.

1243
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,400
Mean Machine.

1244
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,100
It's cute.

1245
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,800
- Let's go, boy.
- We can do it, baby.

1246
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,500
Captain.

1247
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,700
May I have a word?

1248
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,300
Don't worry, warden,
we will take care of business.

1249
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:32,600
I already have.

1250
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,500
What? We can win this on our own.

1251
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,600
Captain, a man in my position
doesn't leave things to chance.

1252
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,300
Now, after you get a comfortable
three-touchdown lead,

1253
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,300
I want you to inflict as much pain
as humanly possible.

1254
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,500
Do not let up, you hear?

1255
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,700
I want those cons to understand
who owns them.

1256
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,800
Do I make myself clear?

1257
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,200
Oh, yes, sir.

1258
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,900
Good.

1259
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,100
There's the kickoff, and we're
under way in the second half.

1260
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,600
Megget is finally brought down
at the guards' 33,

1261
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,400
where Paul Crewe will take over.

1262
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,300
And what a first half he's had.

1263
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,700
Here we go. Here we go.

1264
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:18,900
Down, set.

1265
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,700
Y 45. Hut.

1266
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,000
On first and 10, Crewe will pass.

1267
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,800
- He's got Deacon wide open.
- Come on.

1268
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,100
Oh, incomplete.

1269
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,300
It's okay. Get your head up.

1270
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:30,800
It's all right, man.

1271
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,900
Come on, Paulie.

1272
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,300
Second and 10 from the 33. Crewe's
looking for Deacon once again.

1273
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,500
- He's open.
- He's open.

1274
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,900
But overthrows it.
And it's picked off by Papajohn.

1275
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,600
Look out. He might go.

1276
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,700
Say goodbye.

1277
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,400
Touchdown.

1278
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,800
The first mistake
Crewe's made all day.

1279
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:02,300
Short memory, baby.
We will get it back. We will get it back.

1280
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:04,100
Defense, let's do this.

1281
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,700
8:38 left in the third quarter,

1282
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,900
and Crewe has struggled
thus far in the second half.

1283
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,400
Hut.

1284
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:14,000
The pitch to Megget.
Oh, my. That ball is live.

1285
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,500
It's picked up by Lambert.

1286
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,800
He's at the 15, the 10,
and he will score.

1287
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,100
Yeah. Touchdown. Yeah.

1288
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:27,300
Crewe took a shot on that play
and he's getting up slowly.

1289
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,800
Meanwhile, in the end zone, the guards
have something to celebrate,

1290
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,400
as they find themselves up
by two touchdowns.

1291
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:37,000
This is simply a different Paul Crewe
we're seeing here in the second half.

1292
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,600
There's the old Paul Crewe
we love to write about.

1293
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,500
What the hell are you
doing out there?

1294
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,100
I am done.

1295
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,800
I am out. That's it.

1296
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,700
- Where you hurting?
- My knee.

1297
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,900
- Seems okay to me.
- Well, it ain't.

1298
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,100
If Crewe can't go, I don't know how
deep these guys are at quarterback.

1299
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,400
The guards will try to keep it away
from Megget, so they will pooch kick.

1300
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,800
Fair catch. Fair catch.

1301
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,500
As Big Tony calls for the fair catch.

1302
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,500
Watch out. That was as late a hit
as I have ever seen.

1303
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,800
And even some of the home crowd
not liking that one.

1304
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,100
Hang in there, partner.

1305
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:22,100
Can of corn. Can of corn,
and I will be fine. Can of corn.

1306
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,200
Yeah, I'd have a hard time
looking at me too.

1307
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:28,800
Brucie.

1308
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,100
Yeah, coach.

1309
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,600
You're the only one that knows
this offense, son. Now, do it.

1310
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,000
Coming into the game,
replacing the injured Paul Crewe,

1311
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,500
is number 1, Brucie.

1312
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
All right, all right.
Crewe's playing like shit.

1313
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,700
That's his problem.
I am going to bring us back.

1314
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,100
Right, 32 Flex Dive Motion
on one. Ready.

1315
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,300
Break.

1316
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,900
Yeah. It's Brucie's
time to shine, baby.

1317
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,800
Okay. Down, set. Hut.

1318
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,800
There's the snap and the ball is
fumbled. And the guards recover.

1319
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,700
I knew I shouldn't
have had that popcorn.

1320
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,400
The guards are in command here
as we move late into the third quarter.

1321
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,900
Ninety-eight. Hut. Hut.

1322
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:06,700
The give is to Potter.
Back to Knauer.

1323
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:09,100
He's got a man open
deep downfield.

1324
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,200
He will throw the flea-flicker.

1325
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,000
And he's got it. Touchdown, guards.

1326
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,100
And this game is starting
to look like a blowout.

1327
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:23,000
Hey, man, after all Caretaker did,
this is how you show him love?

1328
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,500
Don't worry about it.

1329
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,900
You haven't changed one damn bit.

1330
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,800
All right. Down, set.

1331
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,200
Back in at quarterback is Brucie,

1332
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,100
who will try to find a handle
on the ball this time.

1333
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,400
Throw it, Brucie.

1334
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:41,400
Oh, shit.

1335
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,000
And look out.

1336
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,900
What a shot he took.

1337
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,400
How much more blood do you want?

1338
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:57,100
I think the cons are just about
out of options at quarterback.

1339
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,700
Hey, Skitchy,
let me ask you something.

1340
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,400
When you popped the warden,
was it worth it?

1341
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,600
Was it worth spending
the rest of your life in here?

1342
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,900
Was it worth it? It was worth
every goddamn second.

1343
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,300
What the hell is he doing?

1344
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,600
Paul Crewe must be feeling better,
because here he comes.

1345
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,100
All right, I missed you guys,
so I am back.

1346
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,400
We got a lot of work to do.
Let's get it going.

1347
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,100
Deuce right, 89. Fly on two. Ready?

1348
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,400
Break.

1349
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,800
As we start the fourth quarter,
cons down by three touchdowns.

1350
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,200
Wide left. Tight left.

1351
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,800
Black 90. Hut. Hut.

1352
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,500
Here comes the blitz,
and no one's blocking.

1353
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,600
And Crewe will be sacked
for a big loss.

1354
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:14,100
That looked like a message to Crewe
from his offensive line.

1355
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,300
Did you see that, man?
They're quitting on him.

1356
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:19,400
Okay, baby. Jailbreak Blitz. Ready?

1357
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
We got that out of the way.
I deserved it.

1358
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,300
- Now we got to play some football.
- Switch it. Switch it.

1359
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,500
Cons need to do something
to get back in this game.

1360
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,500
And that's not it.

1361
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,100
And Crewe is leveled.

1362
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,500
I don't think he's going to get up
from that one.

1363
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,100
Nice hit.

1364
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,500
But he is. And I don't know how,
after that last hit.

1365
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,800
All right, punt team.

1366
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,200
Keep them off the field.
We're going for it.

1367
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,200
Dumbshits are going for it.
Let's go. Let's go.

1368
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,400
Come on back, if he wants to get
his ass kicked. Come on back.

1369
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,700
This is unbelievable.

1370
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:53,900
Fine. You guys don't want to help me,
I will do it on my own. On two.

1371
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,100
Let's go, to the line.

1372
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,600
On fourth and 20,

1373
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,400
the cons are going to go for it.
This could be the ball game right here.

1374
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,600
Red 98. Hut. Hut.

1375
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,700
Crewe dodges the blitz,
but he loses his helmet.

1376
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,500
And he's not going down.

1377
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,100
He's got the first down.

1378
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:21,500
Time-out.

1379
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:23,700
- Man, oh, man.
- Not bad.

1380
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,100
Huddle up.

1381
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,200
Look.

1382
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:38,500
I am sure you already know this,
but I never said it out loud.

1383
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,700
I did throw that game.

1384
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,300
I did it.

1385
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:47,800
I was in a bad way
with some worse people.

1386
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,900
After I did it,

1387
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:54,000
I felt so shitty I wish I would have
just let them kill me instead.

1388
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,800
Now the warden wants to pin
Caretaker's murder on me

1389
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,800
if I don't throw this game.

1390
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,000
So it looks like I am going to get
to know you guys a lot better,

1391
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,700
because I ain't doing that
twice in a lifetime.

1392
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,900
We got a little time left.
We can still do this.

1393
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:14,100
I am begging you.
Put your hands in here.

1394
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,400
Okay. Thank you. Now, who are we?

1395
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,600
Mean Machine.

1396
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,100
Come on, Mean Machine, let's go.

1397
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,500
That's great news.

1398
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,300
All right. We got ourselves a game.

1399
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,000
Brown 65. Hut.

1400
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:43,100
First and 10 from the 30.
Crewe finds Deacon open in the flat.

1401
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,100
Hut.

1402
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:50,500
The give is to Megget. And he fights
his way for a 9-yard gain.

1403
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,300
One yard, baby. One more yard.

1404
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,600
Hut. Hut.

1405
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,700
Crewe tries a sneak. Or is it?

1406
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:58,400
He flips it back to Megget.

1407
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,700
Megget's got the first down
and more.

1408
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,600
And Megget is down to the 4-yard
line, where it will be first and goal.

1409
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,900
Hut.

1410
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,300
Crewe hands it to Turley.
And look at the big man go.

1411
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,700
Tackle him.

1412
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,200
Touchdown.

1413
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:31,400
That was some rumbling, bumbling
stumbling right there.

1414
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,300
And listen to the crowd

1415
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,900
as this underdog con team
is starting to win them over.

1416
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:48,200
Third down and 6. Guards have
the ball on their own 29-yard line.

1417
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,700
Knauer needs a first down
to put this game away.

1418
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:52,300
White 50.

1419
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,900
White 50.

1420
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,200
And look at Battle take off.

1421
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,000
He knocks the ball loose.

1422
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:04,500
There's a dogpile in the backfield.
The refs are trying to sort it out.

1423
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,700
My arm.

1424
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,600
The cons recover.

1425
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,900
We got the ball. We got the ball.
We got it. We got it.

1426
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,900
With just over two minutes left to be
played, this has turned into a game.

1427
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:23,900
Crewe will start in great field position
at the guards' 25.

1428
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:27,500
And look at this formation.
The guards, they're confused.

1429
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,700
Shift over. Move.

1430
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,100
They're trying to call time-out,
but there's the snap.

1431
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,200
Moss is behind a wall of cons. I
wouldn't want to be in front of that thing.

1432
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:42,600
And they will score.

1433
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,000
- Hey. Is that legal?
- Yeah, it is.

1434
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,000
- Is that a touchdown?
- Yes, it is.

1435
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
What is going on here? Shit.

1436
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,600
And with the extra point,
the cons are down by just seven.

1437
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:07,900
- Brucie.
- Yeah. Yeah, coach.

1438
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,400
I want you to go out there
and kick off.

1439
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,400
- I can do it.
- Kick off.

1440
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,500
Brucie can't kick worth a shit.

1441
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:17,400
I know. Recover the ball.

1442
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,500
Jesus Christ, my savior.
If you help me out with this one,

1443
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:24,100
I promise to stop cheating on my wife
with black guys. Amen.

1444
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,400
Back in the game is Brucie,
and he will do the honors.

1445
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,100
And it's a horrible kick.

1446
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:29,800
But the ball is tipped.

1447
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,000
And the cons have come up with it.

1448
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,600
- We got it. One time-out.
- Got it. Got it.

1449
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:40,100
That's it, Brucie. Hey, hey.
My bad. My bad. My bad. Come on.

1450
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:42,900
Give me that.

1451
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,800
Damn...

1452
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,400
Well, that felt unnecessary.

1453
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,300
Cons have enough time
for one final drive.

1454
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,500
Crewe drops back to pass.
He's under pressure.

1455
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,200
- Watch the pass.
- He's looking for Deacon.

1456
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,100
He gets the ball up, but he's leveled.

1457
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,700
And Deacon's got it for a first down,
but he stayed inbounds.

1458
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,800
Tick, tick, tick.
The clock keeps running.

1459
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,900
Clock's running. Clock's still running.
Clock's still running.

1460
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,000
On the ball.

1461
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,100
Goddamn it. Do something.

1462
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,300
Hut.

1463
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:16,200
Crewe. He's looking to throw.
Under pressure again.

1464
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,700
Go. Get rid of it. Go. Go.

1465
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:21,100
He pitches it to Megget.
He's got some room.

1466
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,800
Here we go. Here we go.
Go, Megg. Go, Megget.

1467
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,700
- Go, Megget.
- Get him.

1468
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:29,200
He could go all the way.

1469
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,600
But he won't.

1470
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:31,800
Goddamn it.

1471
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,300
And Megget is hit hard
at the 4, and he's hurt.

1472
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,900
My knee, man.

1473
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:40,800
You busted your knee for us,
we will bust our ass for you.

1474
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,700
Hey, coach, I need a back.

1475
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,200
Just win this shit.

1476
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,400
I am going in.

1477
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,100
Coach, you serious?

1478
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:50,800
Yeah, I am serious.

1479
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,500
And look who's
coming into the game.

1480
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,700
You can do it.

1481
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:58,900
Get that old ass of yours
in the end zone.

1482
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:01,600
We got to win this thing. Come on.

1483
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,900
No, no, no. Hey, old man.

1484
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:08,000
Absolutely not.
You're going to get killed out here.

1485
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,100
They have been trying that for years.
Don't worry, I got the perfect play.

1486
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:13,400
- I ain't handing you the ball.
- You don't have to.

1487
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,900
Nate Scarborough, the former
Heisman Trophy winner from 1955,

1488
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,200
is going to play tailback,

1489
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,900
but he's got to be in there more
for moral support than anything.

1490
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,700
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1491
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,600
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1492
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,900
Mean Machine, Mean Machine
Mean Machine

1493
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,500
Mean Machine.

1494
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,700
Mean Machine.

1495
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:37,300
Six seconds left on the clock.
Cons down by seven.

1496
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,300
They must score on this play.

1497
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:42,900
Don't let them through.

1498
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,200
Down, set.

1499
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:49,200
- Black 99.
- Come on, D.

1500
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:52,300
Black 99. Hut. Hut.

1501
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,600
The give is to the big man, Turley.

1502
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,400
He's stopped by Lambert
at the line for no gain.

1503
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,500
No. Wait.

1504
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,200
The ball's picked up
by Scarborough.

1505
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,500
Come on.

1506
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,300
Touchdown.

1507
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,300
What an amazing comeback, folks.

1508
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,100
Taking a play from
the old Nebraska playbook.

1509
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,200
The Fumblerooskie.

1510
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,900
Easy. Easy.

1511
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,500
You still alive, old man?

1512
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,500
Never felt better in my life.

1513
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,700
You're a sick bastard. Come here.

1514
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,900
All right.

1515
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:44,200
And now the cons are a mere
extra point away from overtime.

1516
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,700
Mean Machine.

1517
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:52,300
Team vote: We go for the win?
We go for the tie?

1518
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:55,700
Hell, guys, we're convicts.
We always go for it all.

1519
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:59,900
Unfortunately, that's why
we're all in the joint.

1520
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,500
What would Caretaker do?

1521
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:04,500
Give me that blackboard.

1522
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,800
Yeah, come on.

1523
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,500
Come on.

1524
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,000
Are you serious?

1525
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,800
I don't know. That play is wack.

1526
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,000
It's going to work.

1527
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,400
It's going to work. Let's go. On the ball.

1528
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,500
Come on. Let's go.

1529
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,600
Let's go, you all. Let's go.

1530
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,400
I think it's going to work.

1531
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,100
Get them out there.

1532
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,500
And wait a minute.
Crewe is coming back into the game.

1533
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,400
The cons are going to go for the win.

1534
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,600
They're going for it.

1535
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,800
Crewe, trying to settle his team
into formation.

1536
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,800
But there seems to be
a lot of confusion.

1537
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,700
Come on. Run the play.

1538
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:44,100
Turley. Turley. Over here.

1539
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,800
Move your giant ass right here.
Right here.

1540
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,700
Come on, baby. Come on.

1541
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,100
The play clock is still running.
Crewe better call a time-out.

1542
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:54,300
Come on, Crewe.

1543
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,900
They don't know what we're doing.

1544
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:59,600
Run the play we set up.

1545
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:02,000
I think you're still dizzy from that hit.

1546
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,900
The snap is to Deacon.

1547
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:06,300
It's a trick.

1548
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:08,400
He throws it to Crewe.

1549
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:33,100
They did it. Unbelievable.

1550
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,700
The cons win.

1551
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,100
We win.

1552
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,000
Group hug in the shower tonight.

1553
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,100
Or not. Or not.

1554
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,400
Well, there you have it.

1555
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,700
A bunch of ruthless criminals
have beaten

1556
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:04,300
the men that uphold
our justice system.

1557
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:06,500
Criminals are people too, Chris.

1558
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,900
Now, give me your wallet.

1559
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:09,400
What?

1560
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,500
Just kidding.

1561
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,100
You got a lot of balls, Crewe.
You played a hell of a game.

1562
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,900
And don't worry, I know you had
nothing to do with Caretaker's murder.

1563
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:24,100
And I will back that up.

1564
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,200
Thank you, baby.

1565
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,200
Mean Machine. Mean Machine.

1566
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,500
You humiliated me. I can't believe
you couldn't even win a fixed game.

1567
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,400
Now, where the hell
does he think he's going?

1568
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:47,900
He's escaping.

1569
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:49,400
He's escaping.

1570
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,600
Officer, shoot that man.

1571
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,500
But, sir, there's people.

1572
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,200
Shoot him.

1573
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,100
Crewe.

1574
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,300
Captain, I order you
to shoot that prisoner.

1575
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,400
Shoot him. Fire.

1576
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,900
Crewe.

1577
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:10,900
Damn it, I am giving you an order,
captain.

1578
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:12,000
Crewe.

1579
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,900
Pull the trigger.

1580
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,600
It's the game ball.

1581
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:42,300
Hey.

1582
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,900
Why don't you stick this
in your trophy case.

1583
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,000
- You have a nice time, old man?
- Yeah.

1584
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Yeah? Okay.
So, what do we do now?

1585
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,700
Well, the first thing is, we tell the
team where they're hiding Unger.

1586
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:02,200
Oh, I can't wait to see
what Switowski does to him.

1587
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,200
Great game, sir.

1588
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,400
That's a week in the hotbox.

1589
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,400
Who gives a shit?
