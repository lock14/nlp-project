2
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,140
Check it out!

3
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,660
Silibil n' Brains, yo!
Going out to all the rejects!

4
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,820
Grab your helmets!

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,860
Before you bump it
Nod your ahead to this

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,020
Our illness is your medicine

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,500
Pump it up till the speaker blows.

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,180
Silibil, Brains -
we both met in the same skate scenes,

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,380
punk rock scenes and hip-hop scenes
just back in the day.

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,220
We basically started to join forces
together and take over the planet.

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,820
They were really
so far ahead of the game.

12
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,780
I've never seen anything like it. I
thought they were going to be huge.

13
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,060
Our travels have taken us
to the UK, California, Asia -

14
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,580
all the places, really.

15
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,860
Ended up back in London,

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,660
did one show and there was
record company people there,

17
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,460
they offered us a record deal
and we needed money for booze

18
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,060
so we thought, "Take the deal,
let the good times roll."

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,420
Always beamed out of this world
Like space bees

20
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,220
Make machine guns out of mics
And blast you like the A-Team...

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,300
It was like having
two early Eminems

22
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,260
and they're from America,
that means they're amazing!

23
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,500
Typical low lives

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,100
Crash in your pad
And jack you with your own knife...

25
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,940
They were very young,
they were dynamic.

26
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,420
My plan was to use the Sony system
to take them to the world.

27
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,860
But I don't care I'm a master

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,420
I'm like a plastic surgeon
I'm always staring at breasts...

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,140
I mean, I thought
of the Beastie Boys.

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,820
..I pulled my pubes
through my nipples

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,860
Put some hair on my chest...

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,620
Before you bump it
Nod your ahead to this

33
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,500
Inject these lethal flows...

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,420
please put your hands together
for Silibil n' Brains.

36
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,780
It seems that your music is going
to be huge here in the UK

37
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,380
and in the US. -Let's hope. -Yes.

38
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,980
They had nothing but
total and utter confidence

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,300
in everything that they were doing.

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,620
They were now with one of the
biggest record labels in the world.

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,700
What would possibly
stand in their way

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,180
and stop them
from becoming huge?

43
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,980
So, where are you guys from?

44
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,620
- Planet Zordon.
- Really? I could tell.

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,420
We were abducted by aliens
when we were kids

46
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,100
and been travelling around
the solar system ever since then.

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,980
But what about really?

48
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,700
I'm Gavin Bain,
I'm not Brains McLoud,

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,100
I'm not American, I'm Scottish.

50
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,700
I've never been in America.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,300
You know, everyone lies,
everyone is lying,

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,420
it's just what you're lying for.

53
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,300
They had an idea
to cheat the system.

54
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,500
The moment they woke up in the
morning they had to be American -

55
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,580
and to girls they met,
and to friends they made.

56
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,460
Greatest actors
I've ever come across.

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,140
You know, and they're
full-on Scots.

58
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,060
We just created a monster.

59
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,980
There's so much lies
about the lies, about the lies.

60
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,540
Why can't you just tell the truth
now? And that's what I want to do.

61
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,060
I was 18 when I met Gav and within
months we were making music.

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,380
We, kind of, brushed past each other
at the front gate of Dundee College

63
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,540
and he was just standing outside
with headphones on.

64
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,500
I just thought, "That guy's,
like, the epitome of cool."

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,180
He just made
the most bizarre entrance.

66
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,700
It was something like out of a film,

67
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,580
when someone would fall
into a classroom,

68
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,040
like, "Oh, my God, sorry, I'm late."

69
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,241
And everyone would be like,
"Who the hell is this guy?"

70
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,780
That's how...that was
my first impression of Gav.

71
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,260
The only seat that was available
was next to Bill.

72
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,700
I remember him, like, you know,

73
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,220
looking at me and being like,
"Oh, fuck," you know?

74
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,220
I think he had a Tupac T-shirt on.

75
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,700
Straightaway I knew,
"Oh, this guy must be into hip-hop."

76
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,540
We liked all the same rap groups,
metal bands

77
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,380
and we liked all the same
comedians, same comedy shows.

78
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,340
From day one we were a comedy duo.

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,140
We were always together and we were
always getting into trouble,

80
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,820
we were always having a laugh.

81
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,460
It sounds like
it was love at first sight.

82
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,500
Ha-ha-ha. I mean...

83
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,540
..I don't know about
"love" at first sight!

84
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,940
I felt like
I'd known him all my life.

85
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,140
We were best friends,
we were brothers.

86
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,420
It was a bromance!

87
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,740
Yeah, he was
a good-looking cat as well.

88
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,620
He just walked past girls
and just, like, a look

89
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,060
and they would stop,
and then he'd start talking to them.

90
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,820
I'd never seen that in my life.

91
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,460
It felt like he was always trying
to press people's buttons.

92
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,820
You know, I'm, kind of,
naturally a shy guy

93
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,620
and he just exuded confidence.

94
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,100
Full of confidence,
full of bullshit!

95
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,780
Alcoholic!

96
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,780
What's up, girls?

97
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,420
We met in the local nightclub
in Arbroath.

98
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,740
I was still at school.

99
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,780
How do you explain
what charisma is?

100
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,700
He's like a light, I suppose,
and people just come to him

101
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,940
because he's fun,
he's good to be around.

102
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm a realist, through and through

103
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,260
and I think that's what Billy needs
because otherwise he would be...

104
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,060
He's like a balloon, you'd have to
hold on to him to keep him steady!

105
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,620
We were both
really good at rapping.

106
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,220
Then we started thinking we should
try and write our own songs.

107
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,700
We worked so well together.

108
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,260
You know, that was enough
to cement it in my head

109
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,620
that this is a path, for sure.

110
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,980
I mean, from the first show,
this hunger just came.

111
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,660
Every chance we get
we'd record songs,

112
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,820
we'd write songs,
we'd record them.

113
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,820
We brought in Oskar.
He's just a great friend of ours.

114
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,660
We had great lyrics so we brought
him into make up three of us.

115
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,540
Feel the strain and tension
My brain's a weapon

116
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,460
A mention of my name could
inflame the tamest session

117
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,820
A reclaimed possession
The world's in my clutches

118
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,260
I bring heat to the mic
and burn any fuck who touches.

119
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,380
So, that's, like,
just one little verse.

120
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,380
Billy was the, sort of,
entertainer and, kind of,

121
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,340
hyping the crowd up, and Gav was,
like, this evil genius

122
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,820
behind the whole thing, and I just
wanted to get my lyrics across.

123
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,860
Gavin was almost quite militant.

124
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,620
He was the driving force
behind everything that we did.

125
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,620
Effectively forcing us
to record and write music.

126
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,660
He was completely
and utterly in charge.

127
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,020
I got addicted to production.

128
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,540
I fell in love with beat machines

129
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,180
and just the technical side of it
was really addictive to me.

130
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,100
We'd sit and read thesauruses,
we'd read dictionaries,

131
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,620
we built our word banks up.

132
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,300
We were confident in our music,
we were confident in our lyrics.

133
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,380
At that time, we were naive
enough to believe that

134
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,180
that's what mattered in music,

135
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,380
was the talent
of the actual music itself,

136
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,380
and the lyrics, and the writing.
And, obviously, that wasn't the case.

137
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,420
# Come gather in my long
Scottish wind

138
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,380
# Belt out your blackest poems
as the sea around you sings

139
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,980
# When that drone takes to the air

140
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,700
# A single note to raise my hair

141
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,020
# Carry songs beyond my lungs

142
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,540
# Cold Scottish wind ##

143
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,500
I grew up in Arbroath
with dreams of leaving.

144
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,220
It's the same as any small town
anywhere in the world.

145
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,300
It's the kind of town that
you grow up to move away from.

146
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,660
Especially if you're creative.
There's no creative scene.

147
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,300
The idea was always
to get in a band and move away.

148
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,740
You know the story about us
auditioning for the record label,

149
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,020
down in London?

150
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,900
This banner popped up on a website

151
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,180
and it said,
"Are you the next Eminem?"

152
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,460
"Are you the next Eminem?
Are you the next Usher?"

153
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,100
At the time, in our heads,
we were it.

154
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,660
We took the 13-hour bus journey down
and we were quite confident.

155
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,540
We were like, "Yeah, we've got
something really original."

156
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,220
In comes the one with
the tongue sharp as thorns

157
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,940
An art of scorn, my style's
immaculately bastard born.

158
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,940
When we arrived at the audition

159
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,500
I realised we were drowning
Eminems in a sea of Ushers

160
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,700
as everyone else was pimped out
in this hip-hop gear.

161
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,500
So we stood out.

162
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,700
I was used to rapping
in little pubs and clubs,

163
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,700
nothing with that much
importance or attention.

164
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,860
And it was three A&Rs, but
you would probably say judges now.

165
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,500
You know, this was before X Factor.

166
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,420
They looked up and they
were, kind of, "Hmm."

167
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,660
And as soon as we started saying,
"Oh, we're B Production,"

168
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,980
talking in a Scottish accent
the vibe just changed horribly.

169
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,220
They were, like, squinting
their eyes, like, "Hmm."

170
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,060
Looking at each other like...

171
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,700
Rappers having no fun
are no-one

172
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,540
They're probably coming out
more overdone

173
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,140
Posh spice and David Beckham's son...

174
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,780
We could tell that they weren't
taking us seriously.

175
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,380
There was a couple of people
we could see, kind of, laughing.

176
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,180
We could see people smiling,
but it wasn't a smile as in,

177
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:21,681
"Wow, this is fantastic,"

178
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,180
it was a smile as in,
"What the hell is this?"

179
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,780
We were like,
"What's with the fucking laughter?!"

180
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:34,380
One of them referred to us
as the Rapping Proclaimers.

181
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,620
It sounds like
you're the Rapping Proclaimers.

182
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,580
It was just horrifying
to hear someone

183
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,580
just destroy it in a second,
all because of where we were from.

184
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,900
This was completely alien to them.

185
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,700
They're like, "Right, so, Scottish
rap?" And we were like, "Yeah."

186
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,060
And it was, they were just like,
"No, no, that's not going to work."

187
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,700
Didn't enjoy that 13-hour
bus journey back.

188
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,860
They were really cocky
and I was just heartbroken.

189
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,260
I couldn't even talk.

190
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,700
It was just like an absolute
journey from hell.

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,780
We were really, really hurt.

192
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,060
Confidence was smashed.
It was all doom and gloom.

193
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,700
What are we going to do?
We need to change our lives.

194
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,060
We need to change
everything we're doing.

195
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,980
All we wanted to do
was be the next big thing.

196
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,380
As a group it was just,
it felt like it was the end.

197
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,580
For me and Gav, I think
it made us stronger.

198
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,860
It made us determined
to prove the people wrong.

199
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,540
A big part of me wanted revenge.

200
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,820
I wanted to show these people,

201
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,340
"How dare they tell me, after the
hours I put in, how dare they say

202
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,100
"that this isn't good?"

203
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:05,060
He was so absolute hell bent
on making it.

204
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,180
And that's what we set out to do,
so we wrote new tunes

205
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,260
and we stepped up a gear.
Everything was better.

206
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,860
The lyrics were better, the music was
better, our performance was better.

207
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,100
We wanted to get some shows in London
to prove these guys wrong.

208
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,620
So we started phoning
and we ended up saying,

209
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,980
"Hi, we're rappers from Scotland, can
you..." And it was like...hang up.

210
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,060
So we tried again, "Hiya, we're
a hip-hop group from Dundee..."

211
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,020
Dooo! No-one was interested.

212
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,780
"Oh, sorry, guys,
it's not what we're looking for."

213
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,500
We felt like we were back
in the audition in London again.

214
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,980
It was my turn to phone,
and for a complete joke

215
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:50,060
and to, sort of, pick our spirits up
I spoke in an American accent.

216
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,260
I just said,
"Hey, we're from California,

217
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,780
"we're coming to London to try and
get a show," and people were like,

218
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,620
"Oh, wow, can you send us any
of your music?" And we were like...

219
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,420
"What? Like, really?"

220
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,860
So, we did it again, we tried and we
were like, "Hi, we're from California

221
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,620
"and we'd love to send you guys our
demo." And, "Oh, yeah, send us it.

222
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,460
"This is great,
we're really interested."

223
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,100
It, kind of,
felt like...but...

224
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,740
It's the same music, it's the same
thing so why would you be interested?

225
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,980
That was shocking. That was just
like, OK, this has got nothing

226
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,500
to do with how good we are, this has
got nothing to do with talent.

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,660
If you want to get on a label,
then you just have to be marketable.

228
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,540
With the whole rapping Proclaimers
thing and people laughing at us

229
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,140
still ringing in our ears,
we knew we had to make a big change.

230
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,660
Gav turned to me and said,

231
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,260
"I think I'm going to become
American." So I sort of laughed

232
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,260
and went, "Oh, yeah, OK."
And he went...he went,

233
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,540
"No, seriously, I think
I'm going to move to London.

234
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,340
I'm going to tell them that I'm
an American rapper from California.

235
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,540
We'll put these fake accents on,
we'll go down,

236
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,260
con the music world and then,

237
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,140
"Pow!" Come clean on Jonathan Ross

238
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,241
and, woo-hoo, we're heroes,
you know?

239
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,660
You can say that out loud, but
it doesn't sound, you know, real.

240
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,740
And I was like, "Listen, man, this is
only going to work if you're American."

241
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,220
You know, you can't turn up and say,
"I'm Scottish.

242
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,300
"Oh, by the way listen to me rap in this
incredible thick Californian accent."

243
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,460
He was like,
"Yeah, you're right.

244
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,980
"I'm just going to completely
redesign myself."

245
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:51,300
From that point forward, just started
talking with an American accent

246
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,660
and installing the idea
deep into, like,

247
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,780
his subconscious
that he was American.

248
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,420
You got the light
I'm a pyrotechnic

249
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,620
Damn it, I can't get from A to B
Because I'm dyslexic.

250
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,980
We were just the little guys
that had a point to prove.

251
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,100
We had, like,
a nation to stand up for.

252
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
The plan was to genuinely
become superstars.

253
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,300
It wasn't really something
that I wanted to do, though.

254
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,020
I felt like I wouldn't feel
right about where I've come from

255
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,180
and my family. There wouldn't be
any integrity there for me.

256
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,260
It would feel shallow and false.

257
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,380
They say your works do no songs
That are straight from the heart

258
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,300
But I'd rather create a pack
That didn't know where to start...

259
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,460
Out of spite, we decided to develop
these characters

260
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,740
and that's when
Silibil n' Brains were really born.

261
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,580
We re-recorded our songs
in American accents,

262
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,780
we spoke to each other every
minute of every day in American.

263
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,260
We decided we had to be
these characters now.

264
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,020
Silibil, Brains,
we both met in the same skate scenes,

265
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,700
punk rock scenes and hip-hop scenes
just back in the day.

266
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,060
- Two LMCs.
- Yeah.

267
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,100
The back story had to be perfected.

268
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,500
We were from San Jacinto,
in California.

269
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,660
We got these layouts
from off the net,

270
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,820
downloads of the street names
and stuff,

271
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,700
so be started memorising areas
that we could have went.

272
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,740
And then our story just
kind of grew from there.

273
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,380
The accent had to be
unquestionably American.

274
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,500
We have to do our own stunts,
which is

275
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,060
probably why he won't see any
skateboarding in our videos.

276
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,660
Oh!

277
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,180
Silibil stuck with me.

278
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,580
I think about syllables
when I'm writing

279
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,180
and, obviously, my name is Billy,
so silly Bill, Silibil.

280
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,460
It was just a play on words.

281
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,500
Brains McLoud just felt like
a comic book character

282
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,780
and then you put Silibil
and Brains together. It was like,

283
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,220
you know, Pinky and the Brain. So it
was like a comic book or cartoon.

284
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:08,180
You know, villains and heroes,
you know? Great double act.

285
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,300
Like Itchy and Scratchy
come to life.

286
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,940
Tom and Jerry, Beavis & Butthead.
It was... It was easy.

287
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,860
We looked like two extras
from Jackass.

288
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,260
American skating kids,
that's what we looked like.

289
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,180
We had baggy jeans, skate T-shirts.

290
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,100
My character was like Jim Carrey
mixed with the rapper Redman.

291
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,540
Bit of Michael J Fox, David
Schwimmer, but then I liked them

292
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,660
as, like, my speaking voice
and how I would speak to people.

293
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,020
Bill was like Chris Tucker and
Chris Rock mixed with, like, ODB.

294
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,980
So we were able to become
characters that you'd see on TV.

295
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,940
Dave!

296
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,740
The problem was that we spent
so much time on the accents

297
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,420
and getting the look,
and how we would act perfect,

298
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,980
we didn't do any research
into, like, American culture.

299
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,940
What grade...what grade
did we finish school in?

300
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,980
What is a grade?

301
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,380
All we knew was these
kind of stereotypes

302
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,060
that we'd seen on music videos

303
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,780
and we were just perpetuating
black rapper stereotypes.

304
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,180
It was just constant,

305
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,500
"perfect the character, perfect the
character, perfect the character."

306
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,980
We were talking in American,
but to girlfriends and stuff,

307
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,500
we were having sex
with an American accent.

308
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,740
Definitely, my girlfriend
at the time thought that was weird.

309
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,780
Masturbating in an American accent.

310
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,340
The only way we were not
going to get caught

311
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,500
was if we could really believe
in these characters.

312
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,220
Like any actor taking on a role,
that's what we did.

313
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,180
This was going to be
the biggest role we'd ever play.

314
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,540
On the bus to London, it kind of
started to slowly sink in.

315
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,780
Like, "Holy shit, we're doing this!"

316
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,780
OK, so what's it
going to really take?

317
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,140
OK, so we need to get in the door.
We need to cause a buzz.

318
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,060
How can we get into this group of
people that run the music industry?

319
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,780
How can we convince them
that we're other people?

320
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:14,380
We are demons that are here
to take over this industry.

321
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,460
I just couldn't understand
how they could think

322
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,620
that they could carry it off.

323
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,260
You can't live a lie.

324
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,420
I'd just moved
to a little studio flat,

325
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,140
which was pretty much
just a living room. It was tiny.

326
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,740
Having, you know, just one person
in that place was just crowded

327
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,540
and then having the two boys...

328
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,180
..it didn't really work,
but I put up with it

329
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,820
because I had to for my brother.

330
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,540
We had £360 between us,
£250 between us.

331
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,500
Bill's last wage, my dole cheque.

332
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,220
I had absolutely nothing at that
point. I was in £6,000 debt as well.

333
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,540
They had a focus
and they had a mission. That was it.

334
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,620
They went and did it.

335
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,060
One person actually offered us
a show and said,

336
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,540
"If you guys want to play,
we've got a slot."

337
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,220
Guys, girls, everyone just
getting naked, changing.

338
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,980
No-one cares, they're so focused
on, "I've got to be this pop act,

339
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,140
"got to get this record deal
tonight, you know?"

340
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,060
And we were just, like, laughing
and like, staring at tits!

341
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,900
We were just there
to kind of blow everyone away.

342
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,100
Just before we went on,
there was four guys, R&B group,

343
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,220
you know, singing harmonies.

344
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,100
We walked out on stage
and the crowd were looking at us.

345
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,940
We said, "Hey, we're Silibil n' Brains,
we're from California, let's go!"

346
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,220
Oh, oh, oh, look who's coming through

347
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,300
Best get out the way
This is Tongue Kung Fu

348
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,700
We just grew
We punched through

349
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,540
All we hit is bricks and beer
And touch fools.

350
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,300
From the moment we said,
"We're from California," that was it.

351
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,620
We had the crowd.
And we really had the crowd.

352
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,460
Already a force in the burglary

353
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,740
Cos I take it too far
Like Michael Jackson in surgery...

354
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,700
We came to the bit where we paused
in between a song and I went,

355
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,420
"It's a shame your mum isn't here
tonight cos she's so...blah, blah."

356
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,020
It was like we were
battling each other

357
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,060
and the crowd were going crazy,
everybody was loving it

358
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,620
because, to them, we were just
making this up on the spot.

359
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,820
When we came off stage, we were
just completely high, buzzing,

360
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,900
"Oh, my God, you know, oh, wow,
that was great!" You know?

361
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,580
We'd taken three steps
off the side of the stage...

362
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,900
And someone stopped us.

363
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,140
You know, and he was like,

364
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,780
"Yo!" He was like dressed all
gangsta, like, you know, A&R.

365
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,780
Huge guy, London accent
and he said,

366
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,180
"Oh, my God, you guys are amazing.

367
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,900
"Where are you from?"
And without thinking we just went,

368
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,580
"Oh, we're from California."

369
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,180
It felt like the room froze.

370
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,140
It felt like the world stopped and we
were able to think... "What did...?

371
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,700
"Did we just say that?"

372
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,340
That was the defining moment.
There was no turning back.

373
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,820
And he gave us his business card

374
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,060
and it was Chris Rock
from Island Records.

375
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:56,180
If you meet someone who's
into hip-hop, you know straightaway.

376
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,180
I have a massive collection
of trainers, I buy vinyl records,

377
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,820
I listen to music all the time,
I wear these crazy glasses

378
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,980
and every one thinks,
"My, God, what are they?"

379
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,940
And that's the hip-hop culture.

380
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,980
Authenticity within hip-hop
is pretty much that.

381
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,300
You've got to live and breathe it.
Silibil n' Brains were hip-hop.

382
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,940
It was hilarious.

383
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,660
They had clever enough
lyrics and flow

384
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,380
to actually impress people like me.

385
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,620
It was, "I love you guys,
I absolutely love it.

386
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,020
"I want to make it happen."
He wrote down a list of names

387
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,300
and said, "I want you
to check these guys out.

388
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,060
"Tell them Chris Rock from
Island Records has seen you guys

389
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,700
"and wants to sign you guys."
He goes, "I just need someone

390
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,580
"to represent you guys
as management."

391
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,740
I'd made an industry contact.

392
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,500
First show in London,
first trip as Silibil n' Brains.

393
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,740
Same songs as what
we had in Scottish.

394
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,740
We were just like,
"This is going to work," you know?

395
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,620
Our confidence just
ballooned at that point.

396
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,860
I guess it's luck. I mean, it's luck
but we made that luck happen,

397
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,540
you know? We made our own luck.

398
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,380
We worked out, like, a method.

399
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,980
We would say, "OK, so, don't ever
talk over each other.

400
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,540
"One of us is to cover, one leads."

401
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,540
If I'm leading, Bill will sit there
listening to every single thing

402
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,220
this guy's saying back and figuring
where he's going with it.

403
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,900
So, I'm not thinking about what...
I'm just trying to get his head

404
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,140
away from asking us about
our story, our past.

405
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,980
Because we weren't
ready for that yet.

406
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,580
Just worked on staying in character
all the time.

407
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,340
My sister must've thought we were
crazy because we always spoke

408
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,060
in an American accent
with her as well.

409
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:45,260
Oh, my God... Fucking A, man!
Fucking A! That guy rocks, man.

410
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,100
I'll tell you that. That guy rocks.

411
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,940
They didn't want to get
out of their personas

412
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,500
out of their acting, in case it
would slip back into,

413
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,380
kind of, a bit of a Scottish

414
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,500
and they couldn't let
the twang get in there.

415
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,940
They had honed it so well...

416
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,860
They sounded like they were
born in America, raised in America.

417
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,740
It was like a little bit
of a dream...

418
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,020
but I was always worried
that he would just get

419
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,900
so deep into it that he wouldn't
know who he was really

420
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,300
because they do have that in them,
both of them.

421
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,660
They get so involved and so deep
into what they're doing that they...

422
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,900
they don't know the line between
reality and, you know, the acting.

423
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,460
We felt Americans were slightly
cockier and slightly louder

424
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
so our characters became that.

425
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,940
Jonathan Shalit was, and still is,

426
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,020
one of the most powerful managers
in the music business.

427
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,780
With managers, it's to do with

428
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,980
not what you know most of the time,
it's who you know.

429
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,780
Ultimately
I'm looking for that X factor

430
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,460
and you can't quantify what that
hidden gem of that person is.

431
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,220
It's just something that
jumps out at you. It could be...

432
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,500
It could be anything.

433
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,380
You can't quantify what
is going to make someone succeed.

434
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
They've got a degree of magic
about them.

435
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,740
What I remember is two dynamic
young people with a massive amount

436
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,860
of energy bounding into the office
like young puppies.

437
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,180
Yo, me and Sili been having
this drinking contest

438
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,980
Six months later and my head
is full of cobwebs...

439
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,580
He didn't get it.
He knew he didn't need to get it.

440
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,940
He knew that if JD gave him the nod,
then that was cool.

441
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,380
The moment we walked into Jonathan
Shalit's office, they were on us.

442
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,540
They couldn't believe their luck
in stumbling across these two

443
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,740
crazy Americans who were just wild.

444
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,500
I think he's seen us as a package,

445
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,500
which was perfect
cos that's what we wanted to be.

446
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,300
We didn't just want to be
two rappers making music,

447
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,260
we wanted to venture off into film.

448
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,700
We wanted to have our own TV shows,
we wanted to be everywhere.

449
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,340
My plan was to first of all
get the record deal.

450
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,140
No-one else was doing
what they were doing at that time.

451
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,100
It seemed, to us, people who could
electrify British clubs,

452
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,980
nightclubs and radio stations
up and down the country.

453
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,020
I said, like, "Jonathan,
we're not getting out of bed

454
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,980
"for anything less than 65,000."

455
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,500
He was like, "All right, cool.
OK, 70."

456
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,220
I'm, like, looking at Bill like,
"Fuck." You know, 70 grand!

457
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,780
It was all happening faster
than our emotions could catch up.

458
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,660
They'd just come back from America
and they had no money

459
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,940
so we gave them financial advances.

460
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,500
They put us up in a house in London,

461
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,620
we got money every month
in our bank account,

462
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,020
all studio costs were paid for.

463
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,340
We paid for them
to have a place to rehearse,

464
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,420
we paid people to be in a band
for them, we paid for instruments.

465
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,940
Basically, financially
supported them completely

466
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,460
so they could concentrate without
worrying on developing their music.

467
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
Did you have any qualms
about taking his money?

468
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,140
No.

469
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,620
No.

470
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,180
First goal achieved, we're making
music, were getting paid

471
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,620
to do fuck all but make music.
You know, that's the life.

472
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,660
And now all we needed Jonathan to do
was to go back to Island Records,

473
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,340
sign the deal
and we had a record deal.

474
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,420
But Jonathan had other ideas.

475
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,220
He knew that if there was interest
from Island, there would be

476
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,420
interest elsewhere, so he began
to pimp us to the other labels.

477
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,580
Just creating this insane buzz.

478
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,060
I think Chris Rock was probably
a little bit pissed off

479
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,620
because they thought
it was just going to happen.

480
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,220
Essentially, your manager is
looking for the best deal.

481
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,580
Everyone is trying to get in
because you know,

482
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,740
as a management company, you're
going to get your little 20%

483
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,860
which, if they sell millions of
records is a large amount of money.

484
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,140
So, all the time, there is a lot
of back-stabbing, cut-throating.

485
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,580
A lot of talking,
people whispering in people's ears,

486
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,180
that's the music business.

487
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,980
What you do is you book a rehearsal
room with a light and sound system

488
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,620
and you create a mini stage,

489
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,260
and then invite the record label
down for a private performance.

490
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,660
It's a very cold environment
because there's no cheering

491
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,500
It's a very cold environment
because there's no cheering

492
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,820
and clapping, and whooping,
like in a concert,

493
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,780
so it's very hard for the act
to be dynamic

494
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,140
because they've got to
perform to nothing.

495
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,100
They perform to no reaction
apart from a...

496
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,220
Sony were really the front runners,
Sony US.

497
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,940
Senior members of Sony
flew in specially for them

498
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,300
when they heard the music.

499
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,020
We did a little showcase for them.

500
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,780
He was just full of questions,
like, "Why are you over here?"

501
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,620
You know, like, "When are your visas
going to run out?"

502
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:49,700
And stuff like that, you know, "Why
aren't you doing this back home?"

503
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,700
"Let's go." You know,
he was really into it

504
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,100
and it seems like he really
wanted to make it happen.

505
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,340
We were just really worried
that, you know,

506
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,340
how do we go back to America?
How do we get into America now?

507
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,060
We'd be found out
as soon as we got to Customs

508
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,460
and we don't have
American passports.

509
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,420
So we thought that was
too tricky,

510
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,100
so I think Bill made up something
on the phone to Shalit about,

511
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,700
"No, we can't work with that guy,"
like, "He came on to me."

512
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,780
Yeah, we just sabotaged that one.

513
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,020
So now we're turning down
record deals.

514
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,740
That just kind of kick-started
the Sony UK deal happening,

515
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,340
so if the US weren't going to have
this, Sony still wanted it.

516
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,260
They loved the music we had,
they were going to pay for us

517
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,380
to go back into the studio,
work with different producers

518
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,420
and get our first single,
get it ready,

519
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,020
get it printed up and get it out.

520
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,700
We believed, if we got found out,

521
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,140
that we'd have to pay
all the money back.

522
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,660
Well, obviously, we couldn't take it
to a lawyer and say,

523
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,980
"This is what we're doing."

524
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,860
We didn't know if it was, you know,
if we'd go to jail for fraud.

525
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:26,180
Friday 13th April, 2004,
we signed to Sony.

526
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,540
Two singles and an album,
essentially.

527
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,380
So that's, like, I think,
50 grand and then,

528
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,460
when the album's ready, 100,000.

529
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,260
You don't think,
like, it's going to work.

530
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,180
You know deep down
you've got the talent

531
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,940
and you've got the drive to do it,
but you can't imagine that

532
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,300
things are just going to,
bam, bam, bam, then go, and go.

533
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,620
It got real at that point.
It got really real.

534
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,220
People over the world...

535
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,740
Every minute of every day,

536
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,540
are dreaming of signing a major
record deal with their music and...

537
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,340
We'd just done that.

538
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,460
We never really got into the music
for the glitz and the glam,

539
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,380
and all that fame
and celebrity stuff.

540
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,900
For us, it's always been about
keeping it real

541
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,460
and just having a good time,

542
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,180
travelling around with friends,
rocking out venues,

543
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,580
skating around the world and...
-Groupies.

544
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,980
No, I mean, seriously,
we're down-to-earth guys,

545
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,540
we like to stay grounded,
keeping it real

546
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,380
and all that kind of stuff...

547
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,540
What is this? -It's champagne!

548
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,980
It's not Cristal?
Get it out of here!

549
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:48,420
Sorry. -Stop breathing on me, you're
giving me a chill in my neck. Jesus!

550
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,460
The next stage was just pure fun
for us.

551
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,980
It was incredible, every morning,

552
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,140
waking up, hitting the studio,
making tracks.

553
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,140
That, for me, is incredible.

554
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,340
After the studio, we'd go to
an event, get drunk, get wasted,

555
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,420
go back to the studio,
in the morning, start again.

556
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,380
It was a marketeer's wet dream.

557
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,220
I just couldn't see
how it would fail.

558
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,460
The key aim was, it sounds silly,

559
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,020
but really, was to take over
the world.

560
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,740
It was infectious and you did kind of
get wrapped up in it yourself.

561
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,820
And it's very easy
after spending time with them

562
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,940
to think "we could do this,
we could take over the world."

563
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,500
We will be the biggest band.

564
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,220
We gave people too much
to think about.

565
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,740
We needed them
not to ask certain questions, so...

566
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,020
If the conversation ever
got into anything serious,

567
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,820
we'd throw the head on tangents.

568
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,420
So, yes, it was always manic.

569
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:09,500
Going to celebrity parties,
going to gigs, VIP at shows,

570
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,580
we were almost living as
these superstar celebrities,

571
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,060
but without having
that success behind us.

572
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,580
We started just enjoying stuff
far too much, you know,

573
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,620
a couple of 21, 22-year-olds just
having the time of our lives, you know?

574
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,940
Silibil n' Brains like to drink
and like to party,

575
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,580
so I think most of the money
I gave them went down their throats.

576
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,500
Young single guys living in London,
a bit of money in their pockets,

577
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,860
they had a lot of fun.

578
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,340
I was thinking to myself, fuck, this
Brains character is really working.

579
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,820
Fell in love with being Brains.

580
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,940
Got me a shit-load of money,
that clearly

581
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,420
I wasn't able to get. He got me
the attraction from all sorts of women.

582
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,540
Now it was just women
all over us

583
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,220
and some of my girlfriends have
been some of the hottest people

584
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,420
I have ever seen in my life.

585
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,740
Gav could never have done
any of that.

586
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,220
But they weren't even
there for Brains.

587
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,300
They were there for the hope of
being around someone who was famous

588
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,900
and maybe they'd get famous.

589
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,780
Difficult being apart.

590
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,180
Difficult wondering
what he was up to.

591
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,300
Difficult knowing that he wanted
this fame and I didn't.

592
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,740
It wasn't till I went down
to London and he said to me,

593
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,700
"You do know I'm going to have to
speak American to everybody?"

594
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,620
I was like, "Oh, OK."

595
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,580
That's when I think it dawned,
when I was actually there,

596
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,860
cos till then it was kind of
a bit of a...fantasy world

597
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,020
that I was going to be part of.

598
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,140
He would obviously not speak
American to me

599
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,700
when we were on our own.

600
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,860
What was that like,
going out with him?

601
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,540
Mortifying.

602
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,460
Embarrassing.

603
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,860
I am, like, the most honest,
straight,

604
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,500
up and down the line person.

605
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,020
At that point, we had been together
quite a long time anyway,

606
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,300
so he knew that, and I often asked
myself, "Where is this going?"

607
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,500
I never thought
Billy didn't love me.

608
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,700
I just always wondered if...

609
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
The music was more important.

610
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,340
They lived round the corner.

611
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,140
After my band split up

612
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,300
I didn't really go out much actually,

613
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,940
I was sort of just locked up
in my, you know, house.

614
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,700
And people would come round.
And they came round.

615
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,860
They played me a DVD of their band.

616
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,500
Tired of waking up in the morning,
next to some old lady thinking

617
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,460
"where did these handcuffs come from?
Why am I in leather hot pants, huh?"

618
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,060
- Watch your ankle.
- Yeah, it's a sore one. It's weaker.

619
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,060
When Busted was quite influential,
we had millions of fans.

620
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,340
People were losing their minds.

621
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,860
Like a chemical reaction, that once
it happens, you can't reverse it.

622
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,340
Seeing my own band go from,
you know, nothing,

623
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,700
to the success that we achieved,

624
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,780
I really believed that they had
a chance to be really big.

625
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,540
It was just very obvious to me.

626
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,980
I sort of became a fan, actually.

627
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,140
Here I am.

628
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,660
Part of the appeal and the fun.
They had a video camera.

629
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,940
They were always making
little movies of themselves.

630
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,580
This was in the early days of
kind of all the modern technology.

631
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,740
Their ideas were so, like, foreign.

632
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,580
And these guys were out...

633
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,740
shooting their own stuff, like,
running around London.

634
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,060
making skits, editing them,
putting on their website.

635
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,300
No-one else was doing
stuff like that.

636
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,620
- First day of the tour.
- We got here. We arrived.

637
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,900
Now all bands have a YouTube
channel, they have content,

638
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,260
an on-the-road diary.

639
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,300
Everyone has to do it, it's part
of your marketing campaign.

640
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,020
You know, what became
bread and butter for the industry,

641
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,060
they were, kind of, out there
doing themselves.

642
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,740
I didn't get the high score.
That sucks!

643
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,020
A lot of what is de rigueur
and a lot of what I do every day

644
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,900
I did for the first time
with Silibil n' Brains.

645
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,900
We just had this huge team of people

646
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,260
that were dealing with
everything that we wanted to do.

647
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,460
Talking ourselves up and spreading
rumours about ourselves,

648
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,540
and just trying to build the brand
of Silibil n' Brains.

649
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,540
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

650
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,740
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!

651
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,940
You could see that Gavin was
the brains behind everything,

652
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:31,260
not to take anything away
from Billy

653
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,460
but Gavin ate, slept, drank,
breathed everything about the band.

654
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,420
He didn't stop for one minute.

655
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,660
I would lose myself
in finding out about production

656
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,140
and all that beautiful stuff
whereas Bill just worked on it,

657
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,900
like, his rhymes
and the entertainment side of it.

658
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,060
He was probably more interested in it
for the fact that it would get us fame.

659
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,660
It's a road for us to just have
just great times all the time.

660
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,060
You know, have the fun
of famous people.

661
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,220
I was on a table
at the front of the Brits.

662
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,220
I was there with Jonathan Shalit,
Jamelia, and a few other people,

663
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,060
and I'd joked about Billy in the day

664
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,340
because he's asked me if I could
get him in and I said,

665
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,300
"Look, I'm really sorry,
I don't have a ticket.

666
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,580
"They're £1,000 each."

667
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,940
"See if you can get in yourself."
And that was it.

668
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,540
We blagged our way
into a lot of things

669
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,060
but Gavin didn't feel confident that

670
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,761
we could blag our way into the Brit
Awards so he refused to go with me.

671
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,180
And I see that
almost as a challenge.

672
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,260
I said I was the Jamelia stylist.

673
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,020
At some point during the night
I got a text from Billy.

674
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,740
I went out to the bar
and there he was backstage,

675
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,780
just hanging out with all the bands.

676
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,380
For Billy to have bluffed his way
past all the security guards,

677
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,220
right to the centre, was genius.

678
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,260
I mean, I was drinking shots after
shots at the bar with Green Day

679
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,900
talking about punk music,
talking about skating,

680
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,780
talking about California
- as a Scottish guy -

681
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,700
and no-one questioned it.

682
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,140
Daniel Bedingfield was someone
I spent a lot of time with backstage

683
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,980
because, like, we were just drinking
and we just got on really well,

684
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,260
and had a laugh.

685
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,460
Someone had said, "Have you met Silibil,
he's from California, he's a rapper?"

686
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,720
He was sitting there and he went,

687
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,921
"Are you from California?",
and I was like, "Yeah."

688
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,060
And he said, "I thought
you were Scottish."

689
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,260
And when he said that, like,
there was a split second

690
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,500
when my heart stopped and everything
just disappeared, and I just thought,

691
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,620
"Have I just been speaking Scottish?
Have I not...? Did I tell him...?"

692
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,860
Cos I'd been drinking quite a lot
and I was thinking,

693
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:54,700
"Maybe for the last half an hour
I've just been speaking Scottish."

694
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,060
And there was just this panic where,
"How do I get out of this?"

695
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,500
In an instant I just
congratulated him and I said,

696
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,900
"Oh, thanks so much." I said,

697
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,020
"I've been living in California for
years and been travelling around,

698
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,280
"and that's why I've got
a strange accent.

699
00:44:07,281 --> 00:44:09,181
"A lot of people think I'm Canadian."

700
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,580
I never seen Gav again
until the next morning.

701
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,620
I think Gav was quite angry
at the fact that I'd done it

702
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,920
and I don't know if he was angry

703
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:26,121
because I'd gone to the BRIT Awards
and he hadn't done

704
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,060
or because I'd, in front of
our friends almost,

705
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,580
I'd, sort of, shown him,
"Yeah, we can do it."

706
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,100
I had an incredible night.

707
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,820
Absolutely one of the most memorable
nights I think I had in London.

708
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,220
To see him standing there
chatting away with Kelly Osbourne.

709
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,780
You know, in his suit
with his, kind of, blonde hair

710
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,180
going this way and that way.

711
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,860
It was like, yeah, it was like...

712
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,460
You are one of them and that's
why you do deserve to succeed.

713
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,500
I suppose part of me was jealous.

714
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,220
What you don't see
you're worried about, aren't you?

715
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,500
When he's not answering his phone cos
he's at the BRIT Awards you're thinking,

716
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,700
"Where the hell are you?
Why are you not picking up?"

717
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,860
He phones later and he's like, "Sorry,
I was at the BRIT Awards and..."

718
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:16,060
"What do you mean,
you at the BRIT Awards?!"

719
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,660
Our lives are like polar opposites

720
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,300
and can something like that
actually work?

721
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,180
I'd been out of touch with Gav
for over a year, actually.

722
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,700
I hadn't spoken to him.

723
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,020
Rang him out of the blue

724
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,260
and he'd been speaking with
an American accent so much

725
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,660
that it was almost impossible for him
to talk to me in a Scottish accent.

726
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,780
That's when he started to tell me
that they'd been signed

727
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,820
and that they had this massive,
like, publishing deal.

728
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,000
There was a studio in Brixton

729
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:55,001
that they were recording at free
of charge, whenever they wanted,

730
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:59,900
and I was just, like,
"Fuck, this is insane!"

731
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,520
So I ended up going down to visit them

732
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:05,121
and it was just a completely surreal situation.

733
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,420
Hey, no interview.

734
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,900
The thing that was most shocking

735
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,780
was that they'd completely
fooled all these people.

736
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,340
They were convinced
that they were American.

737
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:41,220
A massive part of the hip-hop
industry is how credible you are.

738
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,380
You know, they talk about
people being real

739
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:47,180
and people being fake,
and they were genuinely fake.

740
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,060
Everybody was giving them
tons and tons of respect.

741
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,660
Just being really sycophantic

742
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,540
and they were running off
to the shops for them.

743
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,540
Gav and Billy are making
all these demands.

744
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,260
I did not fucking ask for blue ones!

745
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,780
One of the things which was
kind of odd, that I remember

746
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,460
so vividly about the studio, like,
they had this really,

747
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,300
really pristine laminate flooring

748
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:37,140
and I just remember thinking back
to all the scenarios that we'd

749
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,540
been in when we tried to record
and we have these, sort of,

750
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,740
really shitty, kind of, carpets.

751
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,420
Although it sounds really silly,
even just not standing

752
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:52,340
on a shitty carpet, for me,
was quite a big step up for them.

753
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,260
They'd changed completely,
personality wise.

754
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,940
They'd amplified it so much

755
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:06,860
and so over-exaggerated everything
that they were doing to the point

756
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,260
where it was actually quite hard work
sometimes to hang out with them.

757
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,620
We're just drinking!
We're just drinking!

758
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:24,300
What's wrong with gays?
That's what I say.

759
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,500
We didn't care who was watching us,
we didn't care who'd seen us.

760
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,700
We were the most loudest,

761
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:30,801
obnoxious people you could probably
ever meet in London

762
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,780
and, literally, we felt invincible.

763
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,940
We had to be very careful who
we brought into our circle of lies.

764
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,540
Maybe four or five people
really knew.

765
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,140
Everyone who came in
had to lie our lie.

766
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,300
At this point, London wasn't here.

767
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,140
It was just our little
bubble of friendship.

768
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,300
The characters, they had a licence
to do whatever they wanted to do.

769
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,700
Inside, we kind of knew
that it was fine,

770
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,300
we could get away with it because
we were just these wild guys.

771
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,940
That's what everyone expects.

772
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,700
And it became that.
It became people expected it.

773
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,980
Come here. Come here.

774
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,620
I need a piss.

775
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,780
There was always a notion
in the back of my head

776
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:47,500
that I, kind of, felt like
it would all just unravel.

777
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,820
That was the kind of routine,
really.

778
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,180
Every night would end with, like, a
massive fight. We were just stupid.

779
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,940
When you're playing characters
24/7, you start to become them.

780
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,260
You know, my mum would
call me on the phone.

781
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,020
I'd, like, miss the call
and not be able to speak to her.

782
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,980
We didn't want to break character.

783
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,700
After a while it really...really
grates at you.

784
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,580
- Did you get the beer?
- Yeah, I got one, dude.

785
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,180
Stella?!

786
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,700
Dude, you know what happens
when we drink Stella.

787
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,620
Before long you've went, like,
18 days again, on the trot

788
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,420
drinking and you're completely
hung over every day,

789
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,020
and you're putting on weight,
and you feel like crap.

790
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,260
It's just so easy, you know?

791
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,060
And the time is 5:54.

792
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,860
I don't know what the fuck is going
on. Am I fucking time travelling?

793
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,260
Am I fucking living the dream?
Am I fucking already dead?

794
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,460
Am I frozen? What the fuck?

795
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:35,380
I guess I'm just here...
Me and, just me and my drink.

796
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,420
The tour manager's still sleeping.
Everybody's sleeping. Not me!

797
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,380
I'm a fucking mess. Maybe I should
sleep? That's the fucking problem.

798
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,900
I should sleep more instead
of drinking and staying up.

799
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,080
We're lying 24/7.

800
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:52,681
You go home at 12 o'clock at night,
you're not going to sleep, are you?

801
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,540
The whole day is going to run
through, "What did I say today?"

802
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:59,060
But I'm just worried, worried,
worried, worried.

803
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,740
Gav started to have a lot of
psychological problems.

804
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,580
He has quite powerful hallucinations
when he goes to sleep

805
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:16,940
where he experiences
terrifying, vivid nightmares.

806
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,540
I see a demon in my sleep.
The "night crusher".

807
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,260
It's like an incubus, a demon that
you see in the corner of the room.

808
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,900
You freeze, you can't move,
you try screaming, you can't,

809
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,980
and you feel the incubus, the demon,
is squeezing your neck.

810
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,340
We completely had forgot,
at one point, that we were Scottish.

811
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,940
To the point that I created
such a good lie

812
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,620
where I could actually see
where I'd been.

813
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,180
You know, see where
I'd lived in my head.

814
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:52,740
So I was definitely
going a little cuckoo.

815
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,580
It's just really hard
to remember what your plan is.

816
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,140
Please put your hands together
for Silibil n' Brains!

817
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,540
What's up? What's up? What's up?

818
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,100
Shut up! -Thanks for coming on, guys.
-You guys are great. Shut up! -OK, OK.

819
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,300
Boys, you are spanking new music.
-Spanking. -New.

820
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,300
How would you describe your sound?

821
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,580
- Spanking!
- Spankingly new!

822
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,700
Spankingly new.

823
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,140
Comedy, humour, excellent.

824
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,940
Well, you did a performance for us,

825
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,300
to try and drag this back
from the edge of despair,

826
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,380
Your Mums, is what it was called.

827
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,700
Well, it wasn't called My Mums.
-Just Your Mums. -Your Mums.

828
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,900
Mums in general. -Don't bring my mum
into! Not on my own show! -Oh, OK.

829
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,860
Let's take a look at it.
It's very entertaining.

830
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,340
That's your mums

831
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:45,220
I was in luck when she didn't
know that she is my fantasy

832
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,460
That's your mums

833
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,340
I gots to have her
She's all I wanted, she's all I need

834
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,500
That's your mums...

835
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:56,300
We got invited to be part of 2004's,
like, the next big thing.

836
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,260
MTV's brand-new music.

837
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,100
She takes pills
but you can't cure ugly...

838
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,580
Other acts that were with
us were Kasabian, Bloc Party,

839
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,060
Natasha Bedingfield.

840
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,260
There was bands that just
absolutely blew up

841
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,020
and, obviously, we thought we were
all going to be in the same boat.

842
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,820
We all thought we were
all going together.

843
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,100
So, is that's what we going
to hear most of the album?

844
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,860
Mostly material that
is taken from...

845
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,500
No, the rest of the stuff's all
love songs and boring music.

846
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,340
Dave is trying to ask us stuff and
we're just throwing him curveballs.

847
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:28,500
We're swerving
his questions, you know?

848
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,820
We're getting out what we want
out of the interview.

849
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,500
Right, you drop it. Check it.

850
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,060
They say violence sells
Well, how about this?

851
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,380
I'll smack myself in the face with
a porcupine wrapped around my fist

852
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,460
I throw a grenade in the toilet
As he sat down on it. -What?

853
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,380
It's not over till
the fat lady sings

854
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,620
but let's leave Dave's mum
out of this. -Oh!

855
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,220
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dave.
- That's good, man.

856
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,820
- We're friends!
- That's OK.

857
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,460
Also, while we were doing that,
we were also listening.

858
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,260
That is the art of telling
great lies - listening.

859
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,220
So, now, reading about you - UK, US,
where are you guys from?

860
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,580
Planet Zordon.

861
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,300
Really, I can tell. -We were abducted
by aliens when we were kids

862
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,100
and been travelling around
the solar system ever since then.

863
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,300
But what about really
because, you know, it seems

864
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,900
that your music is going to be huge
here in the UK and in the US?

865
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,020
Let's hope. -Yes. -Do you think that's
because you've been brought up...

866
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,460
Mothers everywhere
will be buying it.

867
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,980
Er, ladies and gentlemen, please
put your hands together,

868
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,300
Silibil n' Brains.

869
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,740
Boys, good luck, it's been
a pleasure meeting you. And you too.

870
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:27,180
There was an awful lot
of people up here

871
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,820
had seen them being
interviewed on TV.

872
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,860
Why are they American now?

873
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,140
You know, they weren't American.
You know, word travels fast.

874
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,660
Music scene chatrooms
were all lighting up, like,

875
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,020
"I know those guys. I went
to school with Billy in Arbroath,"

876
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,460
and, "I got in a fight with Gav
in a chip shop in Dundee.

877
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,460
Those guys are fake." So, we were
like, "Shit, like, how do we...?"

878
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,460
We sat there trying to, you know,
contact administrators

879
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,580
and trying to get posts
taken off, and deleted,

880
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,940
and we were just thinking,
"OK, there's someone at Sony

881
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,300
"sitting there going through all the
negative press," and, "Oh, what's this?"

882
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,480
You know,
Google search Silibil n' Brains,

883
00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:04,681
and it comes up,
you know, they're fake.

884
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,620
So, did it come up?

885
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,860
No, it didn't. No-one was
doing those searches.

886
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,820
Then we were really
worried about it.

887
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,420
Everything just, like, wow, this
is, this is a really bad plan.

888
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,340
A part of the plan was that
we were just going to get in,

889
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,260
make a record
and then release the record,

890
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,660
and then come clean but release
schedules don't work like that.

891
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,500
That's the side of the game we
didn't really know that much about.

892
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,540
Like, you can't just release
music like that.

893
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,980
You know, you have to do six
weeks of press, radio, TV.

894
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,380
The constant worry
and the constant stressing

895
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,980
that someone's going
to catch us out here...

896
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,460
..someone's going to tell the world
who we really are.

897
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,820
Say cheese.

898
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,020
We always said we weren't going
to get engaged just to be engaged.

899
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,780
We were going to get engaged
because you wanted to get married.

900
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:19,220
How long did you plan your
wedding for? -Only a year.

901
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,460
It was kind of the next step,
you know?

902
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,620
If you're not moving forward
you're stagnated and, I suppose,

903
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,580
we felt ready, in a lot of ways.

904
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,940
Everyone in the industry knew
I was getting married.

905
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,700
No-one questioned why I was
marrying someone in Scotland.

906
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,340
No-one expected invites
to the wedding, so it was fine,

907
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,060
we got away with it.

908
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,020
We went to Verona for a week
for our honeymoon,

909
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,660
and that's when it started being
a bit more real, and thinking,

910
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:52,180
"We can't really do this,
living apart much longer."

911
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,420
It was always hard for Mary.

912
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,020
It was hard enough having our
long-distance relationship

913
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:01,140
between Arbroath in London.

914
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,780
What happens if we do become
these huge superstars

915
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,780
and we're jet-setting
all over the world?

916
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:12,620
Once the kind of honeymoon period
was over, if you like,

917
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,580
sort of, cracks were starting
to show in the friendship.

918
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,820
Because they were living together
and spending so much time together

919
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,940
in the studio as well,
on top of this whole charade,

920
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,660
there was definitely an underlying
feeling of frustration.

921
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,460
We were best friends.

922
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,260
I mean, we were like brothers
and I guess that's what made it more

923
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,420
upsetting, the fact that we allowed
the divide to happen.

924
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,140
It was like we were business
partners, rather than friends.

925
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,460
We just didn't talk about the things
that mattered, I guess.

926
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:51,020
We were too busy, well,
when we were in London

927
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,580
we were too busy worrying about
a lot of other things.

928
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:00,780
Got a phone call this morning
saying, "Come and support D12,"

929
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:06,180
which kind of wasn't...
kind of wasn't scheduled.

930
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,500
But...

931
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,940
..nothing to worry about.
We won't shit ourselves.

932
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:14,420
Are you well?

933
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,500
It was just lovely, just being able
to ring the guys and say,

934
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:22,580
"We're going to go and support
D12 at the Brixton Academy."

935
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,540
Explain what's happening.

936
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,260
Fucking... Come on.

937
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,780
We were excited. We thought, "This
is it. It doesn't get bigger than this."

938
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,060
They were huge at the time,

939
00:59:51,061 --> 00:59:53,561
we were going to be playing to
thousands of people.

940
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,540
That's the stage.

941
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,340
That's where the people will be.

942
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,740
As usual, something so exciting

943
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:05,260
was met by the fear of...the past.

944
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,340
Wait a minute.
We've been lying the whole time

945
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,780
that we're friends with D12
and Eminem.

946
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:14,140
That's the way we've came up
from the States, and holy fuck.

947
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,820
We were now in a situation
where Del and whoever we were with

948
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:27,580
were expecting us to meet up with
our old friends D12 before the show.

949
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,540
Who we'd never met in our life.

950
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:38,140
I was led to believe at that point
that they knew them.

951
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,340
OK, so the first night of the show.

952
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:44,980
We're performing at Brixton Academy,
London. Stop it, stop it!

953
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:49,540
We're performing at Brixton Academy,
London, with D12. Whatever.

954
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,340
So it's time to start warming up.

955
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:07,340
We were just going to sound check.

956
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:10,460
D12 were on stage, we were standing
at the side watching them.

957
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,300
I just remember the look
on Del's face,

958
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,220
as if to say, "There's your guy!"

959
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,980
Gavin and Billy both shout,
"Yo, Proof, how you doing?"

960
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,720
I just remember
shaking hands with Proof

961
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:29,721
and just being like,
"Hey! How's it going?"

962
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,520
Like you would do in hip-hop.

963
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:34,321
"Hey, man, how you doing?"
"High-five, wassup, wassup?"

964
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,260
Cuddled him and held on.

965
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,420
One of those stories
that we didn't need to tell,

966
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,020
we didn't need to go that far.
But we did.

967
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,580
We'd always add arms and legs
to this huge body of a story.

968
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:00,580
I think he was addicted to lying.

969
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,700
I think he <i>is</i> addicted to lying.

970
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,380
As a child, he had a full-on
South African accent.

971
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:13,260
Like, really really strong
South African accent.

972
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:18,620
When we left South Africa it was
like a total shock to the system.

973
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:21,980
Beautiful hot country,
all our friends and everything,

974
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,620
and we came to Scotland.

975
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:30,100
It was cold, it was dull, it was
dreary. It was pretty hard on him.

976
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:36,460
We had to adjust our accents, and
Gavin had to, he had to change it.

977
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,980
My parents were speaking to
each other in a Scottish accent,

978
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,140
but then they would speak
to any of their friends

979
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,380
in South African accents.
And that's what I learned to do.

980
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:51,220
Taking what someone is doing
and copying it to the absolute...

981
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,580
If I lived with you for like a week,

982
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,300
I'd probably start morphing
into your voice. Mimicking.

983
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,580
I'm phenomenal at mimicking.

984
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:04,700
You think it's probably not that
great, but I think it's quite cool.

985
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,340
We decided that Losers
was going to be the single.

986
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,940
We were always the underdogs,

987
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:44,500
and that was the song about
the underdog sort of taking over.

988
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,460
The record label and the management

989
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:49,780
said, "Release it, this song is
good. Let's make it a single."

990
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,980
But Gavin is like
a full-on perfectionist,

991
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:55,060
so even if he doesn't like a slight
beat or how he sounds on a song

992
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,620
or how Billy sounds on a song,

993
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,820
Gavin is willing to scrap the whole
song and start from scratch.

994
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:03,660
It was Gav's way or no way.

995
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,780
Can you use the best one of them,
and then I'll do another one?

996
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,820
He is difficult to work with.

997
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:13,700
Whenever I've recorded with him,
he's been a nightmare to work with.

998
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,780
My mama knows, my papa knows

999
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,100
Everybody knows we're just losers...

1000
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,940
They could have been famous
ten times over

1001
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,180
if he'd just said yes
to a few things.

1002
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,300
We missed our window to release
the record, for sure.

1003
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,860
I suppose they couldn't
really just release.

1004
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,740
Gavin was always kind of
self-sabotaging himself really,

1005
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:39,380
because he was thinking, "If this
releases, what's going to happen?

1006
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,740
"As soon as that does come out,
it might end everything."

1007
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,340
Do you think he stopped anything
ever coming out? -Yeah.

1008
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:52,540
At that point,
we weren't on the same tracks.

1009
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,300
Bill would have been happy
if the first release went out.

1010
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,300
Whenever the release windows were,
whatever the shape of the band,

1011
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,740
whatever with music sounded like,
as long as he was able to rap

1012
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:05,180
and get famous he would be happy
with that going out in any way.

1013
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,700
Sony merged with BMG and a lot
of people got made redundant.

1014
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,900
The executive responsible
for signing them

1015
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,540
was a victim of the merger process.

1016
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:30,500
If you're signed to a major record
label and you haven't got

1017
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,220
allies who support you,
it's very hard to progress.

1018
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:37,100
The label was sitting there
looking at who makes money,

1019
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,540
who doesn't make money,
and unfortunately at that point

1020
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,380
we hadn't been given
the opportunity to make them money.

1021
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:49,060
This A&R came in, and he
showed us complete disregard.

1022
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,940
He was just kind of, "Look,
we're not going to get rid of you,

1023
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,860
"but we're not really sure
about this."

1024
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,660
"Don't think you are believable,"
I think is what he said.

1025
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:59,780
I really just wanted to jump over
the table and strangle him

1026
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,780
and scream in my Scottish
accent in his ear, you know.

1027
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:06,420
We were then told that it was
going to take about six months

1028
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,860
for all the paperwork to go through
with this merger,

1029
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,180
which meant that we'd be on hold
for another six months.

1030
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:13,940
Had we just went ahead and put
the original version of Loser out

1031
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,340
it could already been out,
and within that six months

1032
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,180
been on tour, or been releasing
elsewhere in the world.

1033
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,660
But we were on hold now.

1034
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:28,900
It happens all the time, because
these artists, they come along,

1035
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,900
and they're young
and they've got a dream.

1036
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,940
And they're focused on the dream.

1037
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,540
And they always get fucked over
on the business

1038
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,580
because they're not looking
at the business,

1039
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,300
they're looking at the dream.
While looking at the dream,

1040
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,100
this other guy is looking
at the business.

1041
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,860
They're not looking at the business,

1042
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,460
so how can they know if they're
getting fucked on the business?

1043
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:56,700
There is always a moment when
you're developing creative people,

1044
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,540
if they don't have success
before that moment passes,

1045
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,660
they often don't have success.

1046
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:05,700
Once someone at the top
has told all the foot soldiers

1047
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:09,220
that that band is probably on its
way out, the phone stops ringing.

1048
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:12,740
You can't get hold of people.
And I remember thinking at the time,

1049
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:16,740
because I've gone through it before,
"This feels like that time again."

1050
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:22,540
No-one will really say,
"This isn't working. It's over."

1051
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,060
We'd write songs, write songs,
write songs,

1052
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,620
but we couldn't get in
to record the songs.

1053
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:33,620
So that period was very,
very frustrating.

1054
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:37,060
There's only so long, especially
when you're hungry to get out there

1055
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,420
with what you've got,
that you can do that for.

1056
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:44,020
Bill had this relationship
up in Scotland,

1057
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:46,260
and that was going well, whatever.

1058
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:51,060
We'd already been married
half a year.

1059
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:55,380
Mary was pregnant with Brandon
at the time,

1060
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,220
and we needed the security.

1061
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,700
This was going to be security,
once this song comes out,

1062
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:03,060
and once everything is out,
it's all going to blow up

1063
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:06,420
and we would be sorted.
That was my attitude.

1064
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,620
So he was starting to ransom
himself, like,

1065
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,020
"I don't know how much longer
I can be around this any more.

1066
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,860
"I can't keep doing this forever.

1067
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:15,420
"You keep putting releases back,
I can't be here."

1068
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:18,460
So it was like, "Well, you should be
here as long as it takes

1069
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,100
"for this to happen,
for this plan to work, you know?"

1070
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,620
I realised how close we'd come
to getting our music out,

1071
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:29,220
which is what we always wanted,
was our music being out there.

1072
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,860
They were living a door apart
from each other in the house,

1073
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,820
but they didn't speak
for days at a time.

1074
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,660
I gave him a date, and said,
"If nothing happens by this date,

1075
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,060
"then I'm leaving."

1076
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:46,140
The date came and gone and another
date was put and another date,

1077
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,860
and I kept putting new dates on it.

1078
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:51,660
"OK, May. If nothing happens by May,
that's it, I'm out of here."

1079
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,100
"June. If nothing happens by June,
I'm out of here."

1080
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,620
It just went on and on for months

1081
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,220
until the point where
I just thought, "Enough is enough."

1082
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:07,100
The lie drove me and Gav from
best friends to hating each other.

1083
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,860
The war had become between us.

1084
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:14,180
The war with the industry was gone,
it was a personal war.

1085
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:17,140
We fucking hated each other's
characters.

1086
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,820
We had a really horrible fight,

1087
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,140
and I was like, "How the fuck
can you leave?"

1088
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,820
He was like,
"I'm going to be a dad."

1089
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,860
"How can you be a dad?
You're an addict!"

1090
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:27,820
He was like, "You're an addict,
you're on pills every five minutes

1091
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:30,300
"to stop you from sweating,
to stop you going to sleep,

1092
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,620
"to help you go to sleep.
You're a fucking addict."

1093
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:34,500
And I'm like,
"But you're a fucking addict..."

1094
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,540
No-one has those fights
if you're friends, you know?

1095
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,860
I think at that point you realise
the friendship is over, kind of thing.

1096
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,820
We got up in the morning,
me and Mary.

1097
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:51,460
We packed up the car,
and we drove it back up to Scotland.

1098
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:58,500
I didn't want to walk away,
I didn't want to leave.

1099
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:03,140
This was my dream
since I was a small child.

1100
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,540
But I knew I had to.

1101
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:12,020
Just the way, at that point,
he was talking about it,

1102
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,620
like he had no attachment to it.

1103
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,980
This wasn't a thing that
we had gone through together,

1104
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,020
we hadn't just done all that.
It was just, "I'm gone.

1105
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,980
"I can just get rid of this
from my life in a second."

1106
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,660
That's the thing that drove me
absolutely crazy.

1107
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,380
I felt like he'd came along
on this plan

1108
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,380
which was good for as long as
it suited him,

1109
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,180
and then once he had
lost faith in it,

1110
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:34,820
screw everyone else that was
a part of it, I'm offski.

1111
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,980
But I was the captain of the ship,
so I had to go down swimming.

1112
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:50,100
He phoned me a couple of days after,
because we had a big show to do.

1113
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,020
They were playing some festival,
and if Billy didn't come back then

1114
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,220
he was going to destroy everything
that was important to Billy.

1115
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,700
I think he was at breaking point,
you know.

1116
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,020
He was angry
and he wanted to hurt Billy

1117
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,340
the way Billy had obviously
hurt him.

1118
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:05,060
By leaving.

1119
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,620
I think he realised
that without Billy,

1120
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,420
there was no more Silibil n' Brains.

1121
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,260
And I just told him straight
I wasn't coming,

1122
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,740
I had no interest in coming
and he was on his own now.

1123
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:19,180
I wasn't prepared to come back down,
I wasn't putting up with it any more.

1124
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:22,220
"We'll speak soon."
We never spoke soon.

1125
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,980
I didn't want to see him again,

1126
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:36,060
I didn't want to hear about his family,
I didn't want to hear anything.

1127
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,580
I honestly didn't care
if he was alive or dead.

1128
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:49,580
It felt like he'd left me for dead,
so why should I care about him?

1129
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,500
Everything you've ever dreamed of,

1130
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,620
and then all of a sudden
one of your best friends,

1131
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:55,020
who you've known forever
and did all this with vanished

1132
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:56,921
and won't even talk to you.

1133
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,380
The rest of the boys
have kind of disappeared that way,

1134
01:11:59,380 --> 01:12:02,020
Charlotte and Jonathan stopped
taking your phone calls,

1135
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,220
the label doesn't put you as a priority.
I mean, he lost everything.

1136
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,740
Even Del, Del was struggling
to take my phone calls, you know?

1137
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:19,220
Even Shalit was like,
"You're a group", you know?

1138
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,340
"You're a group.
You're a double act.

1139
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,860
"I don't deal with just one of you."

1140
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,580
I would have no interest in seeing
Mick Jagger in concert on his own.

1141
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:31,580
I wouldn't be interested in seeing
Keith Richards on his own.

1142
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:34,660
But together, Mick Jagger
and Keith Richards are amazing

1143
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,380
in the Rolling Stones.
Same with Billy and Gavin.

1144
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,300
Together, they were brilliant.
Separate, they were worthless.

1145
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,420
I was just left with
bottles of Co-codamol,

1146
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:52,420
taking little snoots for a while.

1147
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:55,620
There is a period of those months
that I literally have no memory of,

1148
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,980
because I was just
in a kind of coma.

1149
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,140
Suspended animation.

1150
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,020
Two years of playing a role,

1151
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:10,260
acting like somebody else,
can do that to anybody.

1152
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:16,540
Some points it was like,
"Where does Gavin Bain begin

1153
01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:18,780
"and where does Brains...?"

1154
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,340
It was just so strange.

1155
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,460
I don't think they realised

1156
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:28,020
how far they'd got themselves
into these personas.

1157
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,460
And how hard it would be
to get back out.

1158
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:37,980
I was sitting alone one night
in a completely empty house.

1159
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,060
All the money had gone, spent.

1160
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:44,020
I was watching Muse on TV
headline Reading.

1161
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:46,940
They were at the studio and we were
brushing shoulders with them

1162
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,620
and there was a vibe
around that time

1163
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,620
that we were going to be
the next big thing.

1164
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:54,820
And it just hit me, like,
we were on that same road, you know?

1165
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,580
I was just drinking,
drinking and drinking.

1166
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,620
The ghosts of all these naked chicks
running around, no more.

1167
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:08,020
Our poster still up on the wall.
Fuck, you know?

1168
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,740
Now I'm that guy from that group
that's no longer.

1169
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:18,420
I could always say it's us telling
this lie, and now it was just me.

1170
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:25,060
I heard this really loud thump,
and I thought, "What's that?"

1171
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,020
I went upstairs and I just heard

1172
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,140
the strangest sound
that I've ever heard.

1173
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,060
And Gavin was, like,
slumped in the bathroom,

1174
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:34,740
and I was like, "What are you doing?
Are you drunk again?"

1175
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:40,140
It was horrible. It was...

1176
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,780
Everything just flashed before
my eyes.

1177
01:14:55,220 --> 01:14:59,420
I like to think that he didn't mean
to take too many,

1178
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:04,460
that it was just, you know,
he forgot how many he was taking.

1179
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,260
That's what I told the doctors,
anyway.

1180
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,500
But, yeah, he just got so deep,

1181
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,340
so dark that he didn't want
to stay around.

1182
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,140
It was just very hard.

1183
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,140
When we came back from London,
I hated Gav.

1184
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:36,580
I didn't want to hear from him,
I didn't want to talk to him.

1185
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:39,380
It was just the best feeling,
to be away, to be free,

1186
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:43,140
and not have this pressure
of having to keep the pretence going.

1187
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:46,340
It didn't take me a week, it didn't
take me a month, it didn't take me

1188
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,060
a year to think, "I wish I was still
doing that, this is so hard."

1189
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,900
It was literally door closed,
move on, that was it.

1190
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,940
Scotland is a very proud nation.

1191
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:02,300
We're sort of a nation
of almosts and maybes.

1192
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,580
I've always been proud
of being Scottish,

1193
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,540
I am proud of being Scottish.

1194
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,020
That's essentially why we did it
in the first place.

1195
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,900
I don't think you really appreciate
growing up somewhere

1196
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,620
until you've actually left it,
and then you want to come back to it.

1197
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:25,140
What would you like? Cereal or egg
or what? Or omelette? -Omelette.

1198
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,100
Brandon, yours is nearly ready.
I hope you're sitting down nice.

1199
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:35,380
Brandon is six and Travis is two.

1200
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:38,380
Both going on 18, I think.

1201
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,580
I've just had it done,
so it's still healing.

1202
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:43,820
That's actually Brandon's hand
that I've got there.

1203
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:45,940
And then I got a link
to go through it,

1204
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,940
like the "family first" thing
goes all the way across.

1205
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,220
I don't want to go to school.

1206
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,700
You don't want to school? Why?

1207
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,540
I'm a million miles away from
what we did as Silibil n' Brains,

1208
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:01,020
these kids running riot in London.
I've grown up, you know,

1209
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:04,300
and sometimes you have to
let go of that and grow up.

1210
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,500
Become yourself.

1211
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,180
- How's it going?
- Where you going? The Bruce?

1212
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,380
Got your pass? -I do, yeah.

1213
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:17,100
I'm an equipment operator offshore,
on a rig, in the oil industry.

1214
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,780
He works in the North Sea. Gosh.

1215
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:26,780
It wasn't a dream, it was wanting to
financially provide for a family.

1216
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,580
I don't think
I could be any further away

1217
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,940
from the sort of music lifestyle
that we had before.

1218
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:39,700
It's something completely different,

1219
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,620
something I'd never imagined
me doing.

1220
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,220
Whatever happened in London

1221
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:52,220
I'm not actually
that bothered about any more.

1222
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,540
It was so long ago.

1223
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:57,300
It's not going to change the way I
feel about Billy. It's in the past.

1224
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,700
I don't need it any more in my life.
I believe that Gavin does.

1225
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:04,780
He still chasing it,
he still wants that.

1226
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:12,380
Silibil n' Brains had a crazy ride.
I haven't left yet because

1227
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,500
I don't think I've achieved
what my endgame was.

1228
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,820
I'm here until the endgame.

1229
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,500
I don't need to have another MC
next to me.

1230
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,780
I can do this on my own.

1231
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,660
Me being Brains McCloud only ended
about six, seven months ago.

1232
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,460
If I was looking at Gavin Bain
from Brains' eyes,

1233
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,100
I was a complete failure,

1234
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,380
why would I want to go and be
a complete failure again?

1235
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:52,940
The industry is
kind of closing down to me,

1236
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:56,260
but the social aspects were still
there for that character.

1237
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:59,660
If anything, that's the only thing
I kind of had at that point.

1238
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:06,260
One minute I'm hanging with big
famous people, doing shows with D12,

1239
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:09,860
the next minute I'm on the dole in
fucking Palmers Green in London.

1240
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:13,900
I was just hanging out with girls,
trying to get laid,

1241
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,460
going out and getting wasted
and fucked up.

1242
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,900
Little bit tipsy! Sure!

1243
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:22,140
Everything I was doing was trying to
validate who this character was.

1244
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:28,020
My sister was always kind of like,
"Why are you still Brains?"

1245
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:29,940
Like, "Come back to being you."

1246
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:36,260
First gig back,
I couldn't go on stage.

1247
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:39,020
I'd used the fact it was
the kind of comeback

1248
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:42,980
of this "Brains", American rapper,
to fill the venue.

1249
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:45,060
I felt like I couldn't move my legs.

1250
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:50,040
I was like, "Who am I?
Who do I go on stage as?"

1251
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:59,780
I just said, "I'm Gavin Bain. I'm
not Brains McCloud. I'm Scottish.

1252
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,300
"I've never been in America."

1253
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,900
It was the strangest reaction
to a first song I've ever had

1254
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,980
from any crowd. It was just kind
of like, "What did you say before?"

1255
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,100
I got hugged, I got slapped.

1256
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:18,300
I spoke to Dan Miller from Sony,
and he was like, "You motherfucker."

1257
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,820
It was shocking at first.

1258
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,700
And then it kind of hit me, and
I thought, that is fucking genius.

1259
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,460
Because they never dropped it once.

1260
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,700
And you know, you've no reason
not to believe.

1261
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,060
There's still loads of people
who don't know.

1262
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,500
Where are you from?

1263
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,580
You're lying.

1264
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:38,100
What would I do?

1265
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,620
If every time you met somebody
you assumed they were lying,

1266
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,100
you'd go around in circles.

1267
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,300
I sat down on this big couch
and Gavin was there,

1268
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,100
and he said, "I'm Scottish,"
in a Scottish accent.

1269
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:55,500
And it's weird, because right up
until that point, I had no idea.

1270
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:59,940
And then I remember looking at him,
hearing his words,

1271
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:04,140
it looks like Gavin,
but it doesn't sound like Gavin.

1272
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,060
I kind of almost expect them
still to talk in an American way,

1273
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,060
because they still look the same.

1274
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:12,580
It's not like they were wearing
a mask or had prosthetics on.

1275
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,980
Want to sort of come on
the biggest tour

1276
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:17,020
with the best band in the world?

1277
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,540
I got a call on my mobile
from a number I didn't recognise,

1278
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,740
and it was Billy.
And then to hear him

1279
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:26,300
talking in a Scottish accent as well
was really quite weird.

1280
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,660
I had so much contact with them
over that time and the accent never

1281
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:33,820
broke once, at any point, did they
let on that they weren't American.

1282
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,060
At all. You know. Greatest actors
I've ever come across.

1283
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:42,300
To all intents and purposes,
they destroyed themselves.

1284
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:45,300
They misguidedly thought
that pretending to be American,

1285
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:48,300
not Scottish, would get them
a record deal.

1286
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,180
But I think they got a record deal
because they had great songs

1287
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,460
and were captivating personalities.

1288
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,460
I thought it was funny.

1289
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,420
I also thought, good luck to them.

1290
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,020
It sort of made the whole journey
more amusing.

1291
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,420
They came from really boring,
horrible lives,

1292
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,900
and the way you escape from that
really boring, horrible life

1293
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,100
is become something you're not.

1294
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,460
They could sit in their small house
in the corner of Scotland

1295
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,740
and see America in their bedrooms,
and then created this dream.

1296
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,900
But all dreams come to an end.
You wake up.

1297
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,300
I honestly feel I've learned more
about myself in the last five years.

1298
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:38,340
Figured out what I'm truly
capable of, how far I'll go,

1299
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:42,100
how high I'll get and how low I'll
stoop to to get what I want.

1300
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,820
I know who I am now, you know?

1301
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:53,340
I've got no regrets about London.

1302
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:56,420
Your perception of
"living the dream" changes.

1303
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:02,060
To this day, I still believe
that I'm living the dream.

1304
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:07,940
I've done the whole dream chasing,
and it's more like, I'd say,

1305
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,940
the dream is kind of chasing me.

1306
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:20,260
# It's all there

1307
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,860
# Shining up for the season

1308
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:33,020
# It's not why

1309
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:41,420
# It's all there... #

1310
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:46,260
They could have sold
millions of CDs.

1311
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:48,460
I thought they'd have number ones.

1312
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:51,060
I thought they'd sell out arenas
for concerts.

1313
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:55,820
People can say, "But what if you done
that, what if you done this?

1314
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:59,500
"Where would you have been now?"
I could have been anyone.

1315
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,020
This interview could have been done
in Beverly Hills, you never know.

1316
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,820
I wouldn't take them back.
It was a long time ago.

1317
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:09,660
Be too old now anyway.
31 and ugly, they are now.

1318
01:24:13,660 --> 01:24:15,460
I miss him as a person.

1319
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,660
At the end of the day,
there's two people in the world

1320
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:20,780
who have went through this,
you know what I mean?

1321
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:23,220
There's only one person
I can talk to

1322
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:27,220
that knows exactly what
this was like, and that's Bill.

1323
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,180
Would you do it again?

1324
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,100
Hmm. Tough question.

1325
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:38,980
What did Bill say?

1326
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:44,380
# Every little thing I know

1327
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:52,260
# Every little thing I have

1328
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:59,780
# Sitting up by the Eyre

1329
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:06,060
# Sitting with tired eyes

1330
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:13,580
# Every little thing I have

1331
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:20,180
# Sitting up by the Eyre

1332
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:28,580
# Sitting with tired eyes ##

1334
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,060
I'm takin' a break
from the path I'm on

1335
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,820
Shit creek, paddle, gone

1336
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:50,420
Feel like my past's been blasted on
with a massive atom bomb

1337
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:52,980
I'll be the freshest next best yes
This is effortless

1338
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,620
Rappers that wanna challenge
can hand me the damn death wishes

1339
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,700
Cos I been livin' in
a John Niven imagery industry

1340
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,580
Bitterly killin'
every single little bit of me

1341
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,540
Could've been the epitome
of every kid with a dream

1342
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:03,900
But life is higgledy-piggledy
Nothin' is what it seems

1343
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,180
To question my pedigree
You just best to test and see

1344
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:08,460
I'm so nuts
and nuts are allergic to me

1345
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:11,100
I know these swag rappers
are just testing my sanity

1346
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,780
Shit, Sili had swag when it was
just called personality.
