1
00:00:39,624 --> 00:00:43,461
<i>I always believed</i>
<i>it was the things you don't choose</i>

2
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,630
<i>that makes you who you are.</i>

3
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,300
<i>Your city.</i>

4
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:51,302
<i>Your neighbourhood.</i>

5
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:54,639
<i>Your family.</i>

6
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,729
<i>People here take pride in these things.</i>

7
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,732
<i>Like it was something</i>
<i>they'd accomplished.</i>

8
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:09,320
<i>The bodies around their souls.</i>

9
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,491
<i>The cities wrapped around those.</i>

10
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:41,019
<i>I lived on this block my whole life.</i>

11
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:44,481
<i>Most of these people have.</i>

12
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:49,861
<i>When your job is to find people</i>
<i>who are missing,</i>

13
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:52,614
<i>it helps to know where they started.</i>

14
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:57,410
<i>I find the people</i>
<i>who started in the cracks,</i>

15
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,370
<i>and then fell through.</i>

16
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:07,670
<i>This city can be hard.</i>

17
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:13,635
<i>When I was young, I asked my priest</i>
<i>how you could get to heaven</i>

18
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:17,347
<i>and still protect yourself</i>
<i>from all the evil in the world.</i>

19
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:24,562
<i>He told me what God said</i>
<i>to his children.</i>

20
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,942
<i>"You are sheep among wolves,</i>

21
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,153
<i>"be wise as serpents,</i>

22
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:35,240
<i>"yet innocent as doves."</i>

23
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,867
You live just across the street.
Is that right, ma'am?

24
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,370
That one on the corner,
that's our house.

25
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,958
You know, to get Annette
in high school, you have …

26
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:51,631
- I heard they had an opening.
- Yeah, me, too.

27
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,432
The thing is, she always
had a smile on her face.

28
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:04,769
That was her. She was always smiling.

29
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,981
I mean, who would take my little girl?

30
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,816
She never hurt anybody,
never caused …

31
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,404
Whoever you are, if you have her,

32
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,739
you just let her go.

33
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:19,284
Now, we won't charge you,

34
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,913
<i>but if you're out there,</i>
<i>just let her come home.</i>

35
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,791
<i>All right? Let her come home.</i>

36
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,002
<i>I mean, who would take my little girl?</i>

37
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,421
- You fucking cops.
<i>- She never caused no trouble,</i>

38
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,882
<i>she never got in any fights,</i>
<i>she's a sweetheart.</i>

39
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:37,218
- This is just unbelievable.
<i>- She was a good kid.</i>

40
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,387
The whole force
standing outside the house,

41
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,348
guarding the sidewalk
with their arms crossed.

42
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:46,185
I mean, are the kidnappers
coming back?

43
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,229
<i>Amanda McCready was taken</i>
<i>from her home</i>

44
00:03:48,313 --> 00:03:51,107
<i>between 8:00 and 8:30</i>
<i>Wednesday night.</i>

45
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,902
<i>She's four years old,</i>
<i>has blond hair and green eyes …</i>

46
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,028
- Hey.
- Hey.

47

<i>… weighs 35 pounds</i>
<i>and is 40 inches tall.</i>

48
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,491
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah. I know.

49
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,410
<i>A beleaguered police force</i>
<i>and a weary citizenry</i>

50
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,787
<i>have been left with so little to cling to.</i>

51
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:08,833
<i>A blanket, a back door,</i>
<i>and a doll named Mirabelle.</i>

52
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,710
The neighbourhood's
really coming together.

53
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:11,878
We're gonna have a rally.

54
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:15,465
Everyone's gonna have a vigil.
We're gonna have a vigil tonight.

55
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:17,300
You know,
the neighbourhood's all alert,

56
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:20,678
everybody's alert of what's going on
and everything that …

57
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:25,224
The surroundings. We got flyers up,
posters up, we have all that stuff up.

58
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,269
So everybody's well aware
and everybody's looking for Amanda.

59

<i>Captain Jack Doyle on details</i>

67
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:53,044
Little bit.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

68
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,796
She was blowing Mike Gulley
down the post

69
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,257
when he was still 14 and innocent
and milking cows up Vermont.

70
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:00,927
I don't know about innocent.

71
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:04,389
<i>Her mother says Amanda</i>
<i>may be carrying a little girl of her own.</i>

72
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:07,892
<i>Mirabelle was last seen with Amanda.</i>
<i>It's her favourite doll.</i>

73
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,312
This is horrible.

74
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,233
- Not if you're Channel 9.
- Turn it off.

75
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,447
Good night.

76
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,667
- Hey, Angie. Get the door?
- I'm in the bathroom.

77
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:40,550
It's 7:00! Seven in the fucking morning!

78
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:41,759
What?

79
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,762
Are you Patrick Kenzie?

80
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:48,558
- Yeah.
- Bea and Lionel McCready.

81
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:50,685
Our niece was kidnapped
three days ago.

82
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:54,230
Please, come on in. Come on in.
I have to apologise.

83
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,941
You know, there's been some problems
with kids in the neighbourhood,

84
00:05:57,025 --> 00:05:59,527
kind of ding-dong ditch,
ringing the buzzer and running away.

85
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,945
So that's the reason for the language.

86
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,405
- Oh.
- Well, we can come back later.

87
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,990
No. Please, please.
Make yourself comfortable.

88
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,825
Here, we're just …
I'm sorry about the mess.

89
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,995
We've been …
I had a late case, and a lot of cases.

90
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,747
We've just been …
We've just been working a lot,

91
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,000
we worked on a case last night,
you know, so we just …

92
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,002
Please sit down, though.

93
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,840
Or …

94
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,761
My associate'll be in in just a minute.
She's in the other room.

95
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,596
How can we help you?

96
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,681
Do you know people
in the neighbourhood

97
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,142
who don't talk to the police?

98
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,852
Yeah, one or two.

99
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,024
We wanna hire you to augment
the investigation of Amanda.

100
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,233
Is that right?

101
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:43,362
You know how in JonBenet Ramsey
the family hired investigators?

102
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:46,199
So … Are the police all right
with youse hiring outside help?

103
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:48,743
The police need to worry
about finding my niece.

104
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,038
Hi. I'm Angie Gennaro.
I work with Patrick.

105
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,207
Hello. I'm Bea McCready.
This is my husband, Lionel.

106
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,583
- How do you do?
- They wanna hire us

107
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,711
to augment the investigation.

108
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:01,214
You should talk
to Precision Investigators.

109
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,924
- Who? I …
- I don't know, I meant …

110
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:04,217
Well, let's hear them out, Ange.

111
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,886
Well, aren't you
missing persons detectives?

112
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,721
Yeah, that's what your ad says
in the paper.

113
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:11,182
Yeah, we are.
We are missing persons detectives.

114
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,893
I'm sorry, she …
I think that what Angie means to say is,

115
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,729
just for the sake of disclosure,
up to this point,

116
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:21,567
our experience has been primarily,
you know, finding missing persons

117
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:23,569
who've gone missing that they …

118
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,530
You know, they just stop payments on
their Jet Ski

119
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,656
and they went to New Hampshire …

120
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:30,993
Every police officer in this state
is looking for your niece right now.

121
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,954
And I'm not sure
how much more help we could be.

122
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,497
Well, you're not gonna
do any harm, are you?

123
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,042
All right, look.
I got a pension coming up with Edison.

124
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,503
- So, that's collateral, if …
- No. It's not that.

125
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,381
Why is this so hard?
The cops don't want me coming here.

126
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,674
- Lionel don't want me coming here.
- Don't worry.

127
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,301
- Now you don't want the job?
- No, it's not that we don't want the job …

128
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,847
We consult privately
before we make decisions like these.

129
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,558
- We do.
- Helene puts her to bed.

130
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,727
She goes across to Dottie's.
Maybe gone a half hour, watches TV.

131
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,147
Then she comes home
and Amanda is gone.

132
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,648
She was watching <i>Wife Swap.</i>

133
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,942
She remembers,
'cause that's her favourite show.

134
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,277
And do youse two live upstairs?

135
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,446
Yeah, when our folks died
they left us a unit and my sister a unit,

136
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:10,158
so, you know,
basically we got no choice.

137
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,450
And with the acoustics
in the apartment,

138
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,577
you can't get away from it.

139
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,453
Why don't you just
come over the house, all right?

140
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,540
- Just talk to Helene, you know.
- Lionel, talk to Helene?

141
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,834
Look, she don't show it,
but she's hurting right now.

142
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,503
- Please. Please!
- All right. Lookit, all right?

143
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:25,173
I was no saint. All right?
I had my own problems.

144
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:28,384
I took a hard bust at 22.
Bea straightened me out.

145
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,887
My sister Helene has not had that.

146
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,765
Talking to the mother's
the least we could do.

147
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,934
- We'll come right over.
- Thanks a lot.

148
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,352
Yeah. Pleasure, Lionel.

149
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,688
Oh, you'll find us
in that brown three-decker by the park.

150
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:43,191
- You know where it is.
- Be hard to miss today.

151
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,129
Look at this. Jesus.

152
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,216
Fucking block party here.

153
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:14,555
Four Cape Verdeans
got killed here last year.

154
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,599
No one gave a shit.

155
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,732
We have a good life, right?

156
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,818
Is that a trick question?

157
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:33,241
I don't wanna find their little kid
in a dumpster.

158
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:35,826
Maybe she's not in a dumpster, babe.

159
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:40,957
I don't wanna find a little kid after
they've been abused for three days.

160
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,337
Hon, nobody does.

161
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,134
All right.

162
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,096
Listen, we'll just go up
and we'll talk to them,

163
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:59,100
and you don't wanna do it after that,
I won't argue with you.

164
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:00,309
Okay.

165
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,989
Hi. Please, come on in.

166
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,368
Helene.

167
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,954
This is Patrick Kenzie,
Angela Gennaro.

168
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:23,958
- Hi.
- I remember you from high school.

169
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:28,462
I see you're still a little conceited, huh?

170
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:29,880
Would you excuse us, Dottie?

171
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:34,051
Dottie's my best friend, Lionel.
She could be in my house if she wants.

172
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,386
Helene, we don't wanna
get in your hair.

173
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,637
We're just gonna ask you
a couple questions

174
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,472
about your daughter,
then we'll be out of here.

175
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,225
- Everyone wants their part now.
- I know.

176
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,978
I already talked to the cops forty times.

177
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,147
- We're sorry to take up your time.
- Listen, we're not the cops.

178
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,565
Beatrice asked us to come over here

179
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,234
and see if we could help out
finding your daughter.

180
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,738
Why don't Bea mind her business?
It's my kid.

181
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,906
'Cause everyone gotta
have their moment, now.

182
00:10:56,032 --> 00:10:57,074
- Right?
- Right.

183
00:10:57,158 --> 00:11:00,411
Beatrice hired these people to help
find Amanda with her own money,

184
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,413
so you had better show them
the goddamn courtesy

185
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,498
- and respect they deserve!
- She's in grieving, prick.

186
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,000
She could grieve
how she wants, Dottie.

187
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,335
- You don't live here!
- Asshole.

188
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,171
Don't you fucking yell at her, Lionel.
You ain't her father!

189
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,256
Fuck you, Lionel.

190
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,675
Go fuck yourself. Cocksucker.
Fuck you.

191
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,510
Get the fuck outta here.

192
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,848
- I'm sorry.
- Maybe we should go.

194
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,434
- I understand. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

195
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,436
Maybe we should go?

196
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:30,066
Look. Can we all just have a few words
in the hallway, please?

197
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,361
Excuse us, Helene.

198
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:47,124
- Helene's got emotional problems.
- It's not that, Lionel.

199
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,959
- What is it, then?
- She's a cunt!

200
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:52,463
- Beatrice, don't use that word.
- God help me, it's true.

201
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:04,725
This is a child.
And I don't know where she is.

202
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:21,575
Well …

203
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:28,416
We can't do any harm, right?

204
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:38,342
It's all right, Bea.
It's all right, Bea. Huh?

205
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:40,177
Thank you.

206
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,637
Now …

207
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:48,102
Well, she's quiet.
She tries very hard to be a good girl.

208
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,440
What about Helene? Her friends?
People she hangs out with?

209
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,942
She got a lot of people
come by the house?

210
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,154
I don't know.
She's at the Fillmore all the time.

211
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:00,948
She's at the Fillmore Lounge?

212
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,033
Yeah, she drinks every day.

213
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:07,371
She's got the gene, you know?
The disease. Our parents had it, too.

214
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,458
She use drugs?

215
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,293
I think she does a little coke.

216
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,462
How much is a little?

217
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:20,301
I don't know. Few times a week, maybe.
I mean, how much is a lot?

218
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,803
Few times a week's a lot.

219
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,973
Then she does a lot.
I don't know anything about that.

220
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:30,519
I put the plug in the jug myself,
I got 23 years sobriety, so, I'm good.

221
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,858
Congratulations.

222
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,070
Do you mind if we see her room?

223
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,924
- Kidnapped the furniture, too?
- Patrick.

224
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,275
<i>10-7 investigation.</i>

225
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,238
Solved it yet?

226
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:26,742
Captain, Patrick Kenzie.
This is my associate, Angie Gennaro.

227
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,080
I see Beatrice went on
and hired someone.

228
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,208
I take it that wasn't
your recommendation.

229
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,459
It was not.

230
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,547
That woman would mortgage her home
to every snake doctor

231
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,716
taking credit cards if she thought
it would help find her niece.

232
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,053
My job's hard enough
without inviting the circus in here.

233
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,639
Captain, this isn't
about the money for us.

234
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:53,894
You ever investigated
an abduction before?

235
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:55,396
I think Mrs McCready was hoping
we could help

236
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,732
with the neighbourhood aspect of this
investigation, the people, you know.

237
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,401
How old are you?

238
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,321
- I'm 31.
- He just looks young.

239
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:13,163
A four-year-old child is on the street.

240
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,833
It's 76 hours and counting.

241
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,585
And the prospects
for where she might be

242
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:20,087
are beginning to look grim,
you understand?

243
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,091
Half of all the children in these cases
are killed, flat out.

244
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,510
If we don't catch the abductor
by day one,

245
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:29,346
only about 10% are ever solved.

246
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,348
This is day three.

247
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,104
He may look young,

248
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:40,274
but if he wants to work this case,
he'd better not act it.

249
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:44,028
Well, he's been hired by a woman
who's the victim of a crime,

250
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,363
and by law he's entitled
as her representative

251
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,450
to be cooperated with
by the Boston Police Department.

252
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,118
So he expects to be.

253
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:55,331
And he will be.

254
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:01,879
He and his better half will be contacted
by two of my senior men,

255
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:05,716
at their convenience,
and be permitted to observe.

256
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,347
We're just trying to help, Captain.

257
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:18,479
Look, I don't care who does it.
I just want it done.

258
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,151
Good afternoon.

259
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,489
Ready to get started?

260
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,002
All I'm saying is that we heard
Helene comes in here.

261
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:44,922
We're not asking
for the combination to the safe.

262
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:49,677
Listen, I ain't saying a fucking word.
I already talked to the fucking cops.

263
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,929
All right.

264
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,431
- Dave, right?
- Big Dave.

265
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,684
Big Dave. All right.

266
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:00,020
I'm Medium Patrick. Nice to meet you.

267
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,357
You're a little fucking light in the ass
to be talking shit, ain't ya?

268
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,526
Jesus, pal, I'm just playing.

269
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,696
Listen, buy a couple
of fucking drinks or screw.

270
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,073
Okay, we'll take a couple tonics.

271
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,910
Jesus Christ.

272
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:19,289
Steve Penteroudakis!
The Grecian Formula!

273
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,874
Oh, shit! What are you doing here?

274
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,293
Look at this little motherfucker
at the Fillmore, what's up?

275
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:24,545
Gyro!

276
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,797
Beers and keno, 2:00 in the afternoon.

277
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,132
- What up?
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:33,804
Yeah, listen, I been fucking everywhere
putting up posters, man, you know?

279
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,141
Every project hallway,
all over City Point, everywhere.

280
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,892
You know? I mean, it's a real tragedy.

281
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:40,853
She used to come in here,
sit up at the bar and shit.

282
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:44,106
- You know, she was like our mascot.
- Helene brought Amanda in here?

283
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:48,068
No, mostly in the afternoons.
I mean, it's no place for a child at night.

284
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,695
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

285
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,198
Hot tempers, lot of drugs, trust me.

286
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,784
So how often Helene come down here?

287
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,202
Five nights a week.

288
00:17:57,286 --> 00:18:00,122
Come on, guys, please.
She's a fucking coke ho, okay?

289
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,416
She's in here fucking doing lines
just about every night.

290
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,460
Trust me, all right?
It's not a real shocker, so …

291
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,379
- She's that bad, huh?
- Huh?

292
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:09,131
Oh, she's fucking terrible.

293
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,967
Listen, remember that night
when the kid got kidnapped?

294
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,093
You saw her on the news, right?

295
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:16,847
She's saying, "Oh, I was at my
neighbour's house for a half hour."

296
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,976
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

297
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,563
- What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

298
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,774
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

299
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:29,943
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

300
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,570
and I was banging on the fucking door.

301
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,822
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

302
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,574
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

303
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:36,742
I was banging on the door.

304
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,868
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

305
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,536
but I know he's fucking in there.

306
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,664
- Don't lend him any money …
- Hey, Stevie.

307
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:46,668
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

308
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,837
Don't talk about people you don't know.

309
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,172
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

310
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,424
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

311
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,718
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

312
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:57,513
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

313
00:18:57,596 --> 00:18:59,389
Why don't you mind your business?

314
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,850
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

315
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,269
You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

316
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,648
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

317
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:11,527
What are you doing here, anyway?
Dave can't make a martini worth a shit.

318
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,238
Trying to help Helene
find her daughter. Is that all right?

319
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,697
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

320
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,449
thinking you're better than me.

321
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,701
I'm not the fucking one.

322
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,662
- All right, just cool it.
- Cool it.

323
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,581
- Listen to this douchebag.
- Bet she fucks this asshole in half.

324
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,835
Jesus Christ. What the fuck
is the matter with you guys?

325
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,212
You, you punk fucking jackass.

326
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,223
We're leaving, all right?

327
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,396
You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks …

328
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,734
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

329
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,620
Open that door, rummy.

330
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,624
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

331
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,014
You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

332
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:28,437
How's that, motherfucker?
Now you know.

333
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,481
Keep your fucking mouths closed.

334
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,400
What, you wanna
say some shit, Fat Dave?

335
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,526
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

336
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,862
Make me a martini,
you fucking fat bastard!

337
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:37,988
- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

338
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,325
Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

339
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,577
Fucking unbelievable.

340
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,949
- Can I help you?
- You Detective Bressant?

341
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:25,035
- That's right.
- Patrick Kenzie. Did you just call me?

342
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,580
Oh, sorry.
Sergeant Detective Remy Bressant.

343
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,624
How you doing?

344
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,835
- Should we … Sit down?
- Something wrong?

345
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:35,504
No! I just …

346
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,507
I think Nick was expecting
an older couple, maybe.

347
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,093
Life's full of surprises.

348
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,680
Corwin Earle.
Serial molester, recently work-released.

349
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,265
Went AWOL around the time
Amanda disappeared.

350
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,810
Known associates, Leon Trett

351
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:54,898
and his handsome wife, Roberta.

352
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:58,694
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

353
00:21:58,777 --> 00:21:59,945
They have drug habits.

354
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,781
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

355
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,451
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

356
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:10,205
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

357
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:11,957
Apparently the three of them

358
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,002
have some kind of
<i>Addams Family</i> deal going on.

359
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:18,422
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

360
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,925
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

361
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,301
Do you think this is who has Amanda?

362
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,803
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

363
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,055
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

364
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,017
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

365
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:35,355
So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

366
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,481
No, we got more.

367
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,109
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

368
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,902
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

369
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:42,612
we've interviewed every neighbour
in a mile radius

370
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,406
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

371
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,199
who just happened
to cut off his ankle bracelet.

372
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,325
- Take it easy …
- No, no, no, no, no!

373
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,411
Who the fuck is this guy?

374
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,040
You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

375
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:54,833
You got something to contribute,
you know, be my guest.

376
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,293
Otherwise, hey, you …

377
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,713
You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

378
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,675
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

379
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,054
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

380
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,431
that are capable of doing this.

381
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:13,101
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

382
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,353
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

383
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:19,941
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

384
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:23,445
Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

385
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,656
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

386
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,909
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

387
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,578
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

388
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,163
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

389
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,499
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

390
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:36,958
Fascinating.

391
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,171
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

392
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,217
She did bullshit us.

393
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,552
I'm gonna have to tear her
a new asshole.

394
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:49,179
Meet you down there.

395
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,477
So what kinda name is Bressant?

396
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,687
It's the kind they give you in Louisiana.

397
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,356
Oh, yeah?
Thought you were from here.

398
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,275
Well, it all depends
on how you look at it.

399
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:07,656
I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

400
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,660
But I been living here
longer than you been alive.

401
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,411
So who's right?

402
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:14,955
I'll mull it over.

403
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,082
- What's up, sucker?
- Bubba.

404
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,500
- Good to see you, brother.
- Good to see you.

405
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,043
- How you been? You been good?
- Yeah.

406
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,504
Yeah? What's up, Angie?
How you doing, baby?

407
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,382
You seen those people?

408
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:30,220
Drug addict, drug addict, fucking …
Paedophile.

409
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,348
What the fuck makes you think
I know people like this?

410
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:36,184
Bub, I know you don't pay your rent
doing people's taxes.

411
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,145
Yeah, I don't pay my rent
selling penny rocks

412
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,813
to walleyed child molesters, neither.

413
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,898
They're not all three child molesters.

414
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,318
Just … Just this one, Corwin Earle.

415
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,738
The other two are just baseheads
he hangs out with.

416
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,448
What are the two of yas,
crime dogs, now?

417
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:53,118
We got hired to find that little girl.

418
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,036
Turns out the mother was down
at the Fillmore all night

419
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,163
while the kid was taken.

420
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,957
- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

421
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,751
- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

422
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:04,796
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

423
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,131
Ray works for Cheese?

424
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:10,760
Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

425
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,512
Did you ever sell to Helene?

426
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,556
There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

427
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,349
between us right now.

428
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,602
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

429
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,228
Or coconuts like Cheese.

430
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,354
You should know better by now.

431
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,773
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

432
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,443
I'll let you know
if I hear anything, though.

433
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:27,736
- Thanks, bro.
- Peace.

434
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,655
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

435
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:34,451
How well do you know
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

436
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,454
- Who?
- Come on, sweetheart.

437
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:40,332
"Cheese" Jean Baptiste?

438
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,211
Oh, sounds familiar.

439
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:48,965
No. No.
It don't "sound familiar," Helene.

440
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:55,388
He's a violent, sociopathic
Haitian criminal named "Cheese."

441
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,226
Either you know him or you don't.

442
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,854
Who is he?

443
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,315
He's a drug lord or something, isn't he?

444
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,025
Helene, who is he?

445
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:09,569
- He's just a guy, Lionel.
- Thank you.

446
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:13,156
He is, among other things,
Mrs McCready, a drug dealer, yes.

447
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,159
- What other things?
- I don't know.

448
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:18,119
Why don't you answer
your brother's questions, Helene?

449
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,746
Why don't you go
suck a nigger's dick, Bea?

450
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:22,123
You listen to me!
You don't disrespect my wife,

451
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:23,959
and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

452
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,377
- Who is this man?
- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

453
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,503
You know what I mean!

454
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,338
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

455
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,299
He's a drug dealer, a pimp,
a pornographer. All right?

456
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:34,678
- Perfect. You associate with a pimp.
- A pornographer? Helene.

457
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,013
And we think he rolled up
Pokey Jackson in a carpet

458
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,724
and shot him in the head
on Castlegate, so there's that, too.

459
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,685
What do you do for him?

460
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,854
I just mule.

461
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,690
Occasionally, not making
a habit out of it.

462
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,484
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Lionel, what does that mean?

463
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,529
It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

464
00:26:52,612 --> 00:26:55,031
- Isn't that right, Helene?
- Oh, my God, a few times.

465
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,201
- Where?
- Providence …

466
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,953
Does it fucking matter?

467
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,204
You think I'm fucking around, here?

468
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,708
You think I'm playing games, here?
'Course it matters.

469
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,672
Better answer his question, Helene.

470
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,216
- For what?
- Fuck's sake, Lionel.

471
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,928
- What do you think? Money, taste.
- Of what, drugs?

472
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:18,930
No, little puffy heart stickers
for my locker.

473
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,932
- What kind of drugs?
- Cocaine and heroin.

474
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:25,812
- No, I would've seen the track marks.
- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

475
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:28,273
Yeah, less addictive that way.

476
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,402
Piece of work.

477
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,824
What the fuck is that?
Where are you going?

478
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:47,083
Oh, yeah.
I keep thinking about this thing I heard.

479
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,962
- You know where I'm going with this?
- No.

480
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,757
Did you know I used to work DCU?

481
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,593
- I give a fuck.
- Okay.

482
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,764
So, I still know some of those guys
real well.

483
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,558
Anyway, I heard someone
ripped Cheese off

484
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,602
on a New Hampshire run.

485
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,605
- Did you hear anything about that?
- No.

486
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:12,233
- Care to take a polygraph?
- I already took one.

487
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:14,694
Different questions this time.

488
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:17,906
Come on. It's all right.

489
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,827
We don't care about a
couple of hopheads beating each other.

490
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,871
We care about your child.

491
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,248
So come on.

492
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,667
How much?

493
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,881
You even give a fuck about your kid?

494
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,550
'Course I do.

495
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:42,931
And we know you took the money.
So just tell us how much you took.

496
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,307
How much?

497
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:49,979
How much?

498
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,982
How much?

499
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,653
One thirty.

500
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:07,455
- $130,000?
- Yes, Bea.

501
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,165
How'd you do it?

502
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,548
Me and Ray had to do this
run up Nashua, right?

503
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:18,007
Yeah.

504
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,677
We dropped four ki's on these bikers.

505
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,430
When we was walking back
through the motel with all the money,

506
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:26,766
these cops just swooped right in,
went right for the bikers,

507
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,771
and Amanda was with us,
so we just pretended to be like a family.

508
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:35,066
- And we got in the car, took off.
- You took Amanda with you?

509
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,361
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Leave her in the car, Bea?

510
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,197
I don't got no daycare.

511
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:46,828
It's really hard being a mother.
It's hard raising a family, you know?

512
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,998
All on my own.

513
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,584
But God made you barren,
so you wouldn't fucking know.

514
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,711
- So I understand, Bea, okay?
- You are an abomination.

515
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,379
- Hey, hey, hey. Right here.
- As God is my witness.

516
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,548
Right here. What happened next?

517
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:05,388
We was driving back,
and Ray, fucking Ray was like,

518
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,391
"You know everyone's gonna think
the cops got the money."

519
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,437
- You told Cheese the cops got it.
- But you and Ray kept the money.

520
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:18,359
- This whole fucking thing is Ray's fault.
- Where's the money now, Helene?

521
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,490
- It's with Ray.
- And where's Ray?

522
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,162
- Chelsea.
- Let's go. Come on.

523
00:30:29,245 --> 00:30:31,915
She rides with you.
I don't want her in my car.

524
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,019
- Go on. Move your bike!
- Go fuck your mother.

525
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,688
- What the …
- Beat it, sucker!

526
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,947
Helene, you used to go
with Scott Flaherty, didn't you?

527
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,533
- How do you know?
- You know, I went to Saint Mark's.

528
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,577
I was a freshman when you were
a senior. You don't remember me?

529
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:10,787
No.

530
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,165
Whatever happened to Scott?

531
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:17,293
He stabbed a foreign exchange student
in the chest.

532
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:20,630
He got life in Walpole.
He's a faggot now.

533
00:31:22,632 --> 00:31:24,801
He was kind of a faggot in high school.

534
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:29,931
Oh, man. You're terrible. He was cute.

535
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,642
Well, he kind of wore them tight shorts.

536
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:36,104
Oh, who's a faggot now?
You're dating a faggot.

537
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,652
So, how did the …
How'd the money end up in Chelsea?

538
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,071
I thought youse and …
You and Ray went home after.

539
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,991
No, we dropped off Amanda
and went back to Ray's.

540
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:51,160
But fucking retarded Ray
left his baby rock at my place.

541
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:54,163
You know, right then, I'm like,
"I'm gonna drop this motherfucker.

542
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:56,833
"I don't care if he does got a big dick."

543
00:31:56,916 --> 00:32:00,503
So we went back to the apartment
and Ray was hollering,

544
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:03,590
he was gonna wake up Amanda,
she needs her sleep, you know?

545
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:06,509
So, we went back to Ray's,

546
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,511
- or Ray's mother's. Whatever.
- Yeah?

547
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:12,015
I don't know where that mother went,
but she left all her fucking cats in there,

548
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,017
and it smells like cock.

549
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,687
And Cheese never contacted you,
never left you a note?

550
00:32:17,812 --> 00:32:19,522
No.
We didn't hear nothing from Cheese.

551
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,274
That's why Ray said, "Don't say shit."

552
00:32:21,357 --> 00:32:23,192
You didn't think it was worth it
for your daughter's sake

553
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,696
to tell people what happened?
Cheese has your kid.

554
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:31,618
God fucking knows
what he's doing to her.

555
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,952
What am I gonna do?

556
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,455
Call Cheese and be like,
"You got my daughter?

557
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,206
"'Cause I just ripped you off,
and I'm just checking."

558
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:38,374
Yeah!

559
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,209
- Helene, sit back.
- Oh, my God!

560
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,713
Oh, I'm gonna call the cops, too,
and be like, "You know,

561
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:47,050
"just so you know, wanna know
I run coke and heroin

562
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,384
"in case that's irrelevant."

563
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,179
- All right, calm down. Calm down.
- You make me sick.

564
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,059
What makes you think Ray hasn't
spent all the money, Helene?

565
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,311
Nigger, please. I hid it.

566
00:32:58,394 --> 00:32:59,562
Pull over.

567
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:28,174
Looks like somebody had a little talk
with Ray before they shot him.

568
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:31,594
- Looks like he held out pretty good.
- He didn't have it.

569
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:36,432
He couldn't tell them where the money
was, because he didn't know.

570
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,101
Helene hid it.

571
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,230
Ray made poor relationship choices.

572
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,608
Guess they didn't believe him.

573
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,110
Poor prick.

574
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,612
I'm not waiting in a fucking car.

575
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:08,631
- Where's the money, Helene?
- I give a fuck about the money.

576
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:12,051
- Helene …
- I just want my daughter home with me.

577
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:16,556
I know it. I know, I'm … I'm sorry.
It's very upsetting about Ray. But …

578
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,392
- Where's the money?
- It's right there.

579
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:22,812
- Where?
- Buried it when Ray was passed out.

580
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:24,647
What was that book about,

581
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:27,734
<i>Everything You Need</i>
<i>Is in Your Own Backyard?</i>

582
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:31,154
- I think it was a French book.
- Yeah, that wasn't a book.

583
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,406
- That was a book.
- No, it was a cartoon.

584
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,991
- The fuck out of here.
- No, it was a cartoon.

585
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,243
- Right, Helene?
- Fuck youse both.

586
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,494
Should we bring in the FBI
at this point?

587
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,830
- That's the worst thing we could do.
- Why is that?

588
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,749
'Cause I don't wanna see Cheese
kill Amanda

589
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,083
after he opens a bag
full of newspapers.

590
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,585
It's kidnapping.

591
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:49,338
- I don't see a note. You see a note?
- Nope. No note.

592
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,674
We're investigating
a missing children's case, here.

593
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,094
Kidnapping has nothing to do with it.
Fastest way to get Amanda home

594
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:58,181
is go to Cheese,
swap the money for her and walk away.

595
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:01,684
- Plain and simple.
- Do you know Cheese?

596
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:05,188
Knew his brother better, Jude.
He was a sweet kid.

597
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,273
Cheese went another way.

598
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:11,694
- He wouldn't hurt her, right?
- Ask Ray.

599
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,529
All right, listen.
All he cares about is his money.

600
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:16,032
If he gets it back …
He's not gonna hurt Amanda.

601
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,619
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
We'll get her back. It'll be fine.

602
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,038
- Oh, you're gonna talk to him?
- Yeah, that's the idea.

603
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,207
Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry, all right?

604
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:26,959
I mean, he knows me,
just tell him I apologise.

605
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:29,879
Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.
Just take her home.

606
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,049
- We'll take care of this, all right?
- We'll meet you over there.

607
00:35:33,174 --> 00:35:34,550
I'm hungry.

608
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,885
All right. I'll get you something, Helene.

609
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,637
No, her.

610
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,639
That's what she said to me
right before I put her to bed.

611
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:42,225
She said, "I'm hungry."
I mean, they fed her, right?

612
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,393
She's not still hungry?

613
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,063
I don't know.

614
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:36,112
I know I fucked up.

615
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,447
I just want my daughter back.

616
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:42,368
I swear to God,
I won't use no drugs no more.

617
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,287
I won't even go out,
I'll be fucking straight.

618
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,955
Cross my heart.

619
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,292
It's all right.
We're gonna find her, Helene.

620
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,419
You have to. You promise?

621
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,132
Yeah. I'm gonna try. I will.

622
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,761
Promise. You have to promise me.

623
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,806
I promise.

624
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:09,896
All right.

625
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,332
- Where do you think you're going?
- Talk to Cheese.

626
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,083
No, you're not. No, get back in the car.

627
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,753
No, that's a mistake.
He's never gonna talk to a badge.

628
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,171
- No. No way.
- It's too important.

629
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,839
You wanna get the girl back, or not?

630
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,841
I know him.
If there's a deal to be brokered,

631
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,177
- we're the ones who can do it.
- No, me and Nick are handling this.

632
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,261
Get back in the car.

633
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:45,014
Guys, you two go in there
and negotiate a ransom for a little girl,

634
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:48,517
then it is the FBI.
'Cause it's kidnapping.

635
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:49,769
All you're gonna do is scare him.

636
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:52,521
The more you scare him,
the worse it is for her.

637
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,028
All right. Go ahead.

638
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:03,866
Just fucking relax, sit tight. I know him.
I'm gonna take care of it.

639
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,368
Good luck.

640
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,542
It's been a long time.

641
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,798
No. I quit.

642
00:38:25,888 --> 00:38:28,224
I'm gonna talk some private shit.

643
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,397
- Don't wait, but don't get too far.
- You know I'll be right here.

644
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,859
Bitches love the cheddar.

645
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,868
- How you been, Chris?
- Better than you.

646
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,331
Yeah. Good to hear it.

647
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,501
- Fuck you.
- Man, be cool.

648
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:59,505
It's been too long not to see a fool.

649
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,590
I grant you audience.

650
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:03,759
Go.

651
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:08,347
We found what you
were looking for in Chelsea.

652
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,517
What I care about Chelsea?

653
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,770
'Cause one of the idiots
that robbed you lived there.

654
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,772
What idiot?

655
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:20,943
The one that you and Chris
beat with a pipe and shot in the chest.

656
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:26,115
I don't know about nobody getting kill.

657
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:29,785
But if somebody rob me
and end up dead …

658
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:35,041
Well, you know, life is a motherfucker.

659
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:41,756
Cheese, we got your money.
It was buried in Ray's backyard.

660
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:46,635
We wanna give it back to you
in exchange for Amanda McCready.

661
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:50,139
The two police outside
are the only other people who know.

662
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,641
No one gives a fuck
about what you did.

663
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:54,810
I mean, I didn't even
like Ray that much.

664
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:57,646
You're gonna get your money,
the mother gets her daughter back,

665
00:39:57,772 --> 00:40:00,816
and we'll say we found the kid
in the bushes, or whatever.

666
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:02,902
It's either this, real quiet,

667
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,154
or it's a thousand fucking cops
kicking your door in,

668
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:07,782
putting their fat knees in your neck.

669
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,495
Hold up.

670
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:19,835
What the fuck is this?

671
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,671
Lift up your shirt.

672
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,634
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker, you heard me.

673
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,095
Lift up your shirt.

674
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,682
- It ain't like that, Cheese.
- My CC, I ain't down with you.

675
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,768
Lift up your shirt.

676
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,609
You, too, baby.
Ain't no gender immunity.

677
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,194
Let me see some tit.

678
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:54,120
Don't ever come in my spot like that.

679
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,041
You got my money,

680
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,878
you leave that shit in the mailbox
on your ass way out, you feel me?

681
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,880
Some other motherfuckers
let fool rob on them.

682
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,216
I don't play scrimmage.

683
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:09,552
But I don't fuck with no kids.

684
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:18,227
And if that girl only hope is you,
well, I pray for her,

685
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:20,229
'cause she's gone, baby.

686
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:22,523
Gone.

687
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,994
Cheese, if you ever
disrespect her again like that,

688
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:37,663
I'm gonna pull your fucking card.

689
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,873
Okay?

690
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,339
So you're saying you didn't do it, fine.

691
00:41:47,423 --> 00:41:50,509
We'll take your money,
and we'll be on our way.

692
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,429
But if it turns out you're lying,

693
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:56,182
I'm going to spend every nickel
of that money to fuck you up.

694
00:41:56,265 --> 00:41:57,933
I'm gonna bribe cops to go after you,

695
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,477
I'm gonna pay guys
to go after your weak fucking crew,

696
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:03,647
and I'm gonna tell everyone I know
that you're a CI and a rat.

697
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:05,816
And I know a lot of people.

698
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,611
And after that, you're gonna wish
you had listened to me,

699
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,447
'cause your shitty, pool-hall,
crime-syndicate headquarters

700
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:12,865
is gonna get raided.

701
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,451
And your doped-up bitches
are gonna get sent back to Laos,

702
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,953
and this fucking retard right here
is gonna be testifying against you

703
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,456
for a reduced sentence while you're
getting cornholed in your cell

704
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,249
by a gang of crackers.

705
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:26,295
'Cause from what I heard,

706
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,673
you guys that get sent up Concord
for killing kids,

707
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,592
life a motherfucker.

708
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:46,357
If I see you again,
I'm gonna get discourteous on you.

709
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,829
And get that sausage off my lawn.

710
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,500
- Well, what happened?
- He said he didn't know anything,

711
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,336
but if you had his money,
you could put it in his mailbox.

712
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,339
- That's what he told you?
- That's it.

713
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,383
Nothing else?

714
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:15,844
Yeah. He said that he wanted
you two off his lawn.

715
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:19,139
I thought you said
you knew this fucking guy.

716
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:21,433
Half the guys he knows
are degenerates.

717
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:23,143
Yeah, you know
what the other half are?

718
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:26,230
- What?
- Cops. Don't hold it against me.

719
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:31,193
No, no. I won't hold it against you.

720
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:35,072
You know what I'll hold against you?

721
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:39,660
We had one chance to make this deal.
You said you knew him.

722
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:42,705
You said you could do it
and you fucked it up.

723
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:45,749
Now I gotta get a warrant for a tap,
start surveillance,

724
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,710
hope to Christ we get lucky.

725
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:49,878
You know, if Amanda
dies because of this,

726
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:53,841
I won't have to hold it against you.

727
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:58,554
You'll hold it against yourself
for a long, long time.

728
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,291
Hope we didn't fuck this up.

729
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:39,011
- Yeah.
- Cheese called in.

730
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:41,930
<i>Says he'll take the deal with Amanda,</i>
<i>but he wants to go tonight.</i>

731
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,600
- Great.
- Well, it is and it isn't.

732
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:47,394
They record calls at the station now.

733
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:50,022
<i>- Jack got a hold of the transcript.</i>
- What does that mean?

734
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:53,150
It means our badges are
basically fucking forfeit at this point.

735
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:55,110
<i>He wants you both down here, now.</i>

736
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,279
Oh, and, hey, Cheese said
he left something in a mailbox

737
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,782
to prove that he's got Amanda.

738
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:25,307
This is a transcript of a recorded call
that came in this morning.

739
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:30,646
Care to read the highlighted portion?

740
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:34,149
Aloud?

741
00:45:37,653 --> 00:45:42,032
"Caller: Bitch, you better
have my money.

742
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,162
"Detective Bressant: Who is this?

743
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:50,791
"The caller:
You know who the fuck this is, fool …

744
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:53,335
"Creole curse words.
If you want that girl back,

745
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,879
"you need to meet me up
Quincy tonight.

746
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:58,507
"Fuck around for a minute
and I'll throw that girl in the lake."

747
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:02,177
The lake he refers to is the water
in the abandoned quarry.

748
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:07,891
Detective Bressant goes on to make
an unauthorised ransom arrangement

749
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:11,687
to exchange Amanda McCready
for $130,000 tonight

750
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,856
in just that location.

751
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:18,402
After some discussion,
Detective Bressant was kind enough

752
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,195
to produce this.

753
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,406
Recognise it?

754
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,576
The four of you have involved me
in an illegal activity

755
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:29,163
without my knowledge or consent,
and I don't fucking appreciate it.

756
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:32,708
- You don't have to be a part of it, sir.
- The hell I don't.

757
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,543
If I delay this now, after this agreement,

758
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:37,296
I just further endanger
the life of that child.

759
00:46:37,379 --> 00:46:40,215
Does that sound like something
you expect me to do?

760
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,675
No, sir.

761
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,136
I went in there. I'll accept responsibility.

762
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,054
You'll accept nothing!

763
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,891
Don't come in here
trying to get noble, boy.

764
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:52,895
Let me see that note.

765
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:01,236
My God.

766
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:06,408
He wants to separate us.

767
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,244
The note instructs you guys to be
on the east side and wait for Amanda,

768
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:12,623
me and Nick to be at the clearing
by the edge with the money.

769
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:15,501
Once Amanda's turned over to you,
you give us a call on the radio,

770
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:17,419
we turn over the cash.

771
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,590
- Who's he likely to bring with him?
- Chris Mullen.

772
00:47:21,715 --> 00:47:23,800
He was at the club
when we made the offer.

773
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:25,511
What do you know about him?

774
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:28,514
It was probably him
who killed Ray for Cheese.

775
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:29,765
If I had to guess.

776
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,601
All right.
Nobody else knows about this, right?

777
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:35,103
- I don't know.
- Yes?

778
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:39,274
I'm asking if keeping it quiet is better
for Amanda or is it better for us?

779
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:43,654
Do you have any children,
Miss Gennaro?

780
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:45,280
No, sir.

781
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:51,286
My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

782
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,331
What you probably didn't hear,

783
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:55,624
and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

784
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:59,127
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

785
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:03,757
Knowing that my little girl likely died

786
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,468
crying out for me
to come and save her.

787
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:09,012
And I never did.

788
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:16,019
My little girl died afraid and alone
in a shallow ditch bank

789
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,648
by the side of the road
not 10 minutes from my house.

790
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,946
I know what it feels like to lose a child.

791
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:31,702
Now, damn it, you force my hand

792
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:34,079
and then you question
the way I handle it.

793
00:48:34,162 --> 00:48:36,331
No one's questioning you, sir.

794
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:39,167
I honour my child with this division.

795
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:43,338
So that no parent
has to go through what I've known.

796
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,216
This child.

797
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,013
That's all I care about.

798
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:53,974
I'm gonna bring her home.

799
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,367
Why'd he bring us all the way up here?

800
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:17,122
I don't know. It's big. It's dark.
It's easy to get away.

801
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,248
No.

802
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,919
They're gonna kill her.

803
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:50,447
This asshole could've found some level
fucking ground somewhere.

804
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:54,534
This is where we part ways.
You guys'll be on top of that cliff.

805
00:49:54,618 --> 00:49:56,620
We'll be right across from you.

806
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:59,790
Give us a call on the radio
when you have her.

807
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,377
- We will.
- Well, good luck.

808
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:07,589
Let's go.

809
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,171
How are they gonna
get Amanda up here?

810
00:50:49,756 --> 00:50:51,425
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

811
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:55,470
<i>Hey, Remy! Fucking Cheese!</i>
<i>Where is she?</i>

812
00:50:56,638 --> 00:51:01,476
<i>There she is. I can see her.</i>
<i>It ain't the way it is!</i>

813
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:05,147
<i>Someone hit Cheese!</i>

814
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:07,190
- You sure you heard something?
- Yes!

815
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,859
- Over there!
- What happened?

816
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:11,611
I don't know. I heard a splash.
Down there!

817
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:12,738
Somebody took Cheese out,

818
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:14,072
- and then all hell broke loose.
- Where's Amanda?

819
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:15,407
- Shots were fired from over there.
- I don't know!

820
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,533
Something went in the water!

821
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:17,659
- What?
- You sure you heard something?

822
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,035
- Yeah, something went in, but I …
- Where did it go?

823
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,537
There! Right there!

824
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:21,997
Oh, my God.

825
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:24,040
Oh, no.

826
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:38,138
Jesus Christ!

827
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,232
<i>Paging Dr Goldsburn.</i>
<i>Dr Goldsburn to ICU.</i>

828
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

829
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:58,802
- How's the leg?
- It'll be fine.

830
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:03,807
They find anything?

831
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:10,939
- They got divers in there now.
- She could still be alive.

832
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:16,778
Maybe she's hiding.
She could be stuck.

833
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:18,029
Right?

834
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,617
I don't think so.

835
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:42,095
Hey …

836
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:44,264
<i>… he's ever seen in all his years,</i>

837
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:48,351
<i>on a little girl called Amanda</i>
<i>and a doll named Mirabelle.</i>

838
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:51,396
<i>This quarry is extremely deep</i>
<i>and treacherous.</i>

839
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,610
<i>All too often,</i>
<i>she keeps that which she takes in.</i>

840
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:59,988
<i>- A sad end to that story, Suzanne.</i>
<i>- It sure is, Phil.</i>

841
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,575
<i>And Ron is next with sports.</i>
<i>The Bruins in action tonight?</i>

842
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,076
<i>Yes, they are, Phil.</i>

843
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,995
<i>The B's took a crack</i>
<i>at the Flyers tonight,</i>

844
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,164
<i>and the rough stuff started</i>
<i>in the first period.</i>

845
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:12,918
<i>And like that, she was gone.</i>

846
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:19,424
<i>We gave our statements.</i>
<i>Nick and Remy the same.</i>

847
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:24,137
<i>All of us spared any blame</i>
<i>for Amanda's death.</i>

848
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,097
<i>Jack Doyle resigned on the condition</i>

849
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:29,309
<i>that he and he alone</i>
<i>be held accountable.</i>

850
00:54:29,392 --> 00:54:33,063
<i>The legendary captain of a unit</i>
<i>dedicated to children</i>

851
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:35,815
<i>stepped down today</i>
<i>in the aftermath of controversy.</i>

852
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:38,944
<i>He was granted</i>
<i>the dignity of early retirement.</i>

853
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,906
<i>But the humiliation of half a pension.</i>

854
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:49,537
<i>It was an ignominious end</i>
<i>to an illustrious career.</i>

855
00:54:50,956 --> 00:54:54,584
<i>Chris' run lasted a day and a half until,</i>
<i>from what they could tell,</i>

856
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:57,671
<i>he ran into someone who wanted</i>
<i>the money more than he did.</i>

857
00:54:57,754 --> 00:54:59,881
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old Chris Mullen</i>
<i>was gunned down last night</i>

858
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:01,508
<i>in an apparent robbery.</i>

859
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:03,843
<i>The police commissioner</i>
<i>defended the rising tide of crime</i>

860
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,763
<i>as a statistical aberration tied</i>
<i>to growing unemployment</i>

861
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:08,890
<i>and the humidity of …</i>

862
00:55:13,812 --> 00:55:16,773
<i>Enough time went by</i>
<i>and they called off the search.</i>

863
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,567
<i>They issued Helene</i>
<i>a death certificate.</i>

864
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,628
<i>The frame and the casket were</i>
<i>donated by the funeral home,</i>

865
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:44,300
<i>but had to be returned</i>
<i>at the end of the afternoon.</i>

866
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:49,681
You know I love you, right?

867
00:55:49,764 --> 00:55:51,182
Yeah.

868
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:55,270
I just wanna be alone for a while.

869
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:06,489
<i>I don't know if she blamed me</i>
<i>or if she blamed herself.</i>

870
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:12,996
<i>But when she didn't think I was home,</i>

871
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:15,540
<i>or if she thought I couldn't hear,</i>

872
00:56:16,666 --> 00:56:18,293
<i>she would cry.</i>

873
00:56:25,884 --> 00:56:30,013
<i>I couldn't stop running it over</i>
<i>and over and over in my mind,</i>

874
00:56:31,973 --> 00:56:33,641
<i>the vague and distant suspicion</i>

875
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:36,686
<i>that we never understood</i>
<i>what happened that night,</i>

876
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,521
<i>what our role was.</i>

877
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:43,693
<i>Or maybe it was just that,</i>
<i>like the hundreds of other children</i>

878
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:46,654
<i>who disappear each year</i>
<i>and never return …</i>

879
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:53,203
<i>Amanda was even more haunting</i>
<i>for never being found.</i>

880
00:56:56,581 --> 00:57:00,210
<i>What they did find</i>
<i>was another big story,</i>

881
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:03,588
<i>and I couldn't help but find it strange.</i>

882
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:09,677
<i>Not two months later and not far away,</i>
<i>another child went missing.</i>

883
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:11,387
<i>… and community watch patrols</i>
<i>are being formed.</i>

884
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:15,558
<i>A bicycle left roadside.</i>
<i>A tyre left spinning.</i>

885
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,352
<i>Late-breaking news on that story.</i>

886
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,813
<i>Little Johnny Pietro is also wearing</i>

887
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:22,023
<i>what this reporter believes</i>
<i>might be a sign.</i>

888
00:57:22,357 --> 00:57:25,026
<i>Johnny Pietro was wearing the</i>
<i>medallion of St. Christopher,</i>

889
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,236
<i>patron saint of …</i>

890
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:29,364
<i>Johnny Pietro and his medallion.</i>

891
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:33,118
<i>What I didn't find strange</i>
<i>was this time,</i>

892
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:35,578
<i>no relatives came knocking</i>
<i>on our door.</i>

893
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,917
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hi.

894
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:43,419
- I need you to come on a ride with me.
- Where?

895
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:45,755
To Everett.

896
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,007
- What, no parties in Lynn?
- Funny.

897
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:51,302
- You got your toast with you, right?
- My what?

898
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:53,138
Your gun, dummy.

899
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:55,265
Yeah.

900
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:09,070
This ain't no
strip-clubbing in Lynn, Patrick.

901
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:12,240
I got something better for you, buddy.

902
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,755
You asked me to find
some people for you.

903
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,716
I think I found them.

904
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:30,842
What you getting me into?

905
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:33,928
You don't give a fuck about this
Corwin Earle dude no more?

906
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:37,265
Yo, 'cause the fat bitch
and the old dude are in there.

907
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:40,268
My man didn't know about the diddler.

908
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,978
Come in with me. Watch my side.

909
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:45,190
We'll find out
if this motherfucker's in there.

910
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,983
You know what, Patrick?

911
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:48,693
If you don't wanna come in,
you don't have to come in.

912
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:51,321
If you don't wanna come in, fuck it.

913
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:56,659
Let's go.

914
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:24,687
Guess who?

915
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:27,607
- Jerome Miller?
- No, it's the coke fairy.

916
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,525
- Open up.
- I got the money right here.

917
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:32,862
Marmaduke, you think you're gonna
hand me money on a fucking porch?

918
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,697
Open the door.

919
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:36,157
Who's he?

920
00:59:36,241 --> 00:59:38,993
He's your father.
Open the fucking door!

921
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:44,207
- Look out.
- Okay, man!

922
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:46,167
Chill! Chill!

923
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,595
What are you guys, starting a band?

924
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:59,847
No one's starting a band.

925
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:06,562
It's a taste.

926
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,856
Cocaine for the old man.

927
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:11,359
Fucking Christ.

928
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:15,697
Want me to change
a roll of quarters for you, too?

929
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:20,576
I told you to tell me when they got here!

930
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:22,328
They just got here.

931
01:00:22,412 --> 01:00:25,373
- You already did some!
- It was a taste bag.

932
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:26,958
Sorry, love.

933
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:30,962
Here, count this fucking mess.

934
01:00:35,216 --> 01:00:37,302
Where's the rest, man?

935
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:41,472
As soon as he's finished counting
that fucking mess you gave me.

936
01:00:50,273 --> 01:00:53,443
- Mr Miller, do you mind?
- No, I don't mind.

937
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:56,195
- Excuse me!
- You're excused.

938
01:00:56,279 --> 01:00:59,324
- Hey, please don't snoop around, sir.
- Hey, relax, handsome.

939
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:00,700
Excuse me!

940
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:03,244
Where the fuck you think you're going?

941
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:05,580
Mr Miller, I'm warning you!

942
01:01:06,748 --> 01:01:08,124
Stop!

943
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,256
Patrick, shoot this bitch.

944
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:21,763
You fat busted cunt.

945
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:25,767
You put a gun on me, you better use it.

946
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,353
Just give us the fucking wizza!

947
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,442
You don't wanna shoot her, Patrick?

948
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:41,407
Who's this guy?

949
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:44,077
Corwin! Go back to your room!

950
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,120
It's not a party?

951
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:50,208
No, it's not a party.

952
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,545
How much money's there, Patrick?

953
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:56,130
Enough.

954
01:01:59,467 --> 01:02:00,968
Want this?

955
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:13,523
What are you doing?
Pick up the fucking money.

956
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:19,904
At least two guns in the house.
Roberta's carrying hers.

957
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:22,240
- What else?
- Well, they're definitely high.

958
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,242
- On what?
- Cocaine.

959
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:26,285
Your friend tell you that, too?

960
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:27,870
SWAT'll be here in five minutes.

961
01:02:27,995 --> 01:02:29,122
You're not gonna wait for them?

962
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:31,290
Did you or did you not tell me
you saw Corwin Earle

963
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:34,252
with the medallion of St. Christopher
around his fucking wrist?

964
01:02:34,335 --> 01:02:35,628
I definitely saw Corwin Earle.

965
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:37,755
We're not waiting.

966
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,550
Stay here.
And don't fuck around, all right?

967
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:41,968
Good job.

968
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:29,390
Fuck.

969
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:41,777
An … An officer … Shots are fired!
An officer down … Shots …

970
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:42,945
Listen to me!

971
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:46,574
A police officer has been shot
at 33 German Road!

972
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:37,166
Get away from him!

973
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:35,850
It was an accident.

974
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,570
It was an accident.

975
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:27,902
Wait!

976
01:07:39,306 --> 01:07:40,725
Hey.

977
01:07:45,146 --> 01:07:46,605
You okay?

978
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:50,484
They told me what happened.

979
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:57,950
I'm proud of you.

980
01:08:00,578 --> 01:08:02,788
That man killed a child.

981
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:06,459
He had no right to live.

982
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:12,757
- You're proud of me?
- Of course I am.

983
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:17,261
You did what you had to do.

984
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:23,100
Let's go home.

985
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:30,191
I gotta stay here awhile.

986
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,990
- See you at home.
- Yeah.

987
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:54,882
Thanks.

988
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:01,806
It was fucked up, right?

989
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:07,478
They tell you anything about Nick?

990
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:10,147
They said he could be okay.

991
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,317
I don't know.

992
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:18,239
They say how old that little boy was?

993
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:19,865
Seven.

994
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:24,161
Second grade.

995
01:09:25,496 --> 01:09:30,251
Should be proud of yourself.
Most guys would've stayed outside.

996
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:33,712
I don't know.

997
01:09:33,796 --> 01:09:35,756
What don't you know?

998
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:40,803
My priest says shame is God
telling you what you did was wrong.

999
01:09:42,137 --> 01:09:43,639
Fuck him.

1000
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:47,184
Murder's a sin.

1001
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:50,855
Depends on who you do it to.

1002
01:09:50,938 --> 01:09:54,483
That's not how it works. It is what it is.

1003
01:10:07,329 --> 01:10:10,332
I planted evidence on a guy once,

1004
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:14,587
back in '95.

1005
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:17,047
We were paying $100
an eight-ball to snitches.

1006
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:19,842
We got a call
from our pal, Ray Likanski.

1007
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:22,177
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

1008
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:24,346
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

1009
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,515
up in Columbia Point.

1010
01:10:27,391 --> 01:10:29,435
We go in, me and Nicky.

1011
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:33,814
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

1012
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:35,941
So, it's a … It's a stash house, right?

1013
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:39,904
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

1014
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:43,699
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

1015
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:45,743
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

1016
01:10:45,826 --> 01:10:49,163
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room …

1017
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:52,750
Now, this place
was a shithole, mind you.

1018
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:56,462
Rats, roaches all over the place.

1019
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:59,715
But the kid's room, in the back,

1020
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,676
was spotless.

1021
01:11:03,677 --> 01:11:07,723
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

1022
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:10,643
The little boy's sitting on the bed

1023
01:11:10,726 --> 01:11:14,188
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

1024
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:16,774
There's no expression on his face,

1025
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:20,569
tears streaming down.

1026
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:25,741
He wants to tell me he just learnt
his multiplication tables.

1027
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:26,992
Christ.

1028
01:11:27,076 --> 01:11:29,662
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

1029
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:32,414
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

1030
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:38,128
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

1031
01:11:40,214 --> 01:11:42,591
You're worried what's Catholic?

1032
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:44,802
I mean, kids forgive.

1033
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:49,056
Kids don't judge.

1034
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:51,433
Kids turn the other cheek.

1035
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,436
What do they get for it?

1036
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,689
So I went back out there,

1037
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:58,857
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

1038
01:11:58,941 --> 01:12:02,277
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

1039
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:08,492
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

1040
01:12:10,869 --> 01:12:12,955
You gotta take a side.

1041
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:18,961
You molest a child, you beat a child,

1042
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:21,755
you're not on my side.

1043
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:23,298
If you see me coming, you better run,

1044
01:12:23,382 --> 01:12:26,260
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

1045
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:31,348
Easy.

1046
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:38,814
Don't feel easy.

1047
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,775
Is the kid better off without his father?

1048
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:43,736
Yeah.

1049
01:12:45,487 --> 01:12:47,656
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

1050
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,284
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

1051
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,828
It's a war, man.

1052
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:55,956
Are we winning?

1053
01:12:57,458 --> 01:12:59,043
No.

1054
01:13:04,965 --> 01:13:08,302
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

1055
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:12,306
No.

1056
01:13:14,725 --> 01:13:16,935
Does that make you right?

1057
01:13:20,606 --> 01:13:22,900
I don't know.

1058
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:25,444
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

1059
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:44,046
- Hey.
- Hi.

1060
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:47,883
How's Remy?

1061
01:13:49,635 --> 01:13:51,136
He lied to me.

1062
01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:55,349
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

1063
01:13:55,432 --> 01:13:57,226
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

1064
01:13:57,309 --> 01:14:00,395
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

1065
01:14:00,646 --> 01:14:02,648
He called him his "old pal."

1066
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:05,567
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

1067
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:06,902
Patrick …

1068
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:09,947
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

1069
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:12,199
and Remy lies about knowing him.

1070
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:16,745
Let it go.

1071
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:19,373
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

1072
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,458
Amanda's dead.

1073
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:23,627
Let it go.

1074
01:14:31,635 --> 01:14:33,053
<i>Babe.</i>

1075
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:36,181
<i>Nick died.</i>

1076
01:14:48,902 --> 01:14:51,780
Left. Left.

1077
01:14:58,287 --> 01:14:59,872
Mr Kenzie.

1078
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,125
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

1079
01:15:16,305 --> 01:15:19,016
Amen.

1080
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:57,512
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1081
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:03,185
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

1082
01:16:03,268 --> 01:16:05,437
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

1083
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,106
You know, too much rum.

1084
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,858
Yeah, like what?

1085
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:14,363
Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.

1086
01:16:15,364 --> 01:16:17,783
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

1087
01:16:18,784 --> 01:16:22,871
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

1088
01:16:24,248 --> 01:16:27,709
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

1089
01:16:29,419 --> 01:16:31,546
What if I don't?

1090
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:35,050
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

1091
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:39,596
Had lunch with him last week.

1092
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,847
Dana had lunch with him last week?

1093
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:42,391
Excuse me.

1094
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:45,185
Hey, Dev.

1095
01:16:45,686 --> 01:16:49,064
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

1096
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:51,275
I can't complain.

1097
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:53,777
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

1098
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:56,655
Not here.

1099
01:16:56,738 --> 01:17:00,117
If it's like that, then you're gonna
have to buy me lunch.

1100
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,912
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

1101
01:17:05,872 --> 01:17:07,708
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

1102
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,501
DCU, yeah. What's up?

1103
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:11,086
Why'd he leave?

1104
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:14,715
Had a habit of just
rubbing people the wrong way.

1105
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:16,883
Like what? What'd he do?

1106
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:19,386
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

1107
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,554
Come on.

1108
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:22,347
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

1109
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:25,392
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

1110
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:27,894
So, what happened?

1111
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:30,647
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

1112
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:31,773
and puts in for a transfer.

1113
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:32,899
What, to Doyle?

1114
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:36,653
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

1115
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:40,198
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

1116
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:42,117
What's "dirty"?

1117
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:46,997
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

1118
01:17:48,582 --> 01:17:50,542
Yeah. Why?

1119
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:53,170
Look, man. <i>CSI</i> is killing us out here.

1120
01:17:53,253 --> 01:17:56,757
Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibres are.

1121
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,633
Certain people are workers.

1122
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:00,344
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

1123
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:02,596
So they don't mind it.

1124
01:18:04,598 --> 01:18:08,268
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

1125
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:12,147
He lied to me.

1126
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:14,483
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

1127
01:18:14,608 --> 01:18:17,194
that's small enough not to matter.

1128
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:23,825
All right, look.

1129
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:28,372
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

1130
01:18:28,455 --> 01:18:31,458
Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

1131
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,584
Yeah.

1132
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,629
One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

1133
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:38,131
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

1134
01:18:38,215 --> 01:18:39,424
So what?

1135
01:18:39,508 --> 01:18:41,259
So my informant tells me,

1136
01:18:41,343 --> 01:18:44,846
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

1137
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:47,974
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

1138
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:49,976
How'd he know that?

1139
01:18:51,144 --> 01:18:52,938
Let me tell you something.

1140
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:54,064
You better think long and hard

1141
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:57,150
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

1142
01:18:57,234 --> 01:19:02,030
You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

1143
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:06,535
Thanks for the steak.

1144
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:08,995
All right.

1145
01:19:22,342 --> 01:19:23,760
Hey.

1146
01:19:25,846 --> 01:19:27,347
I got it.

1147
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:29,850
<i>We need to talk to you, Lionel.</i>

1148
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:31,351
<i>About what?</i>

1149
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:34,187
<i>About the acoustics in your apartment.</i>

1150
01:19:34,271 --> 01:19:35,814
<i>What?</i>

1151
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:37,774
<i>Oh, we live</i>
<i>in a three-decker, too, Lionel.</i>

1152
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:39,693
<i>I got nothing to talk about.</i>

1153
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:42,863
<i>Well, that's fine.</i>
<i>We can talk to the state police.</i>

1154
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:46,199
<i>Meet me at Murphy's Law.</i>

1155
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:07,471
<i>I don't meet him down Murphy's,</i>
<i>he's gonna call the staties.</i>

1156
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:09,890
<i>He's putting a move on you.</i>
<i>Don't go down there.</i>

1157
01:20:10,599 --> 01:20:12,058
<i>I can handle Patrick Kenzie.</i>

1158
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:13,852
<i>- This is an oath we took.</i>
<i>- I started this.</i>

1159
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:15,896
<i>- This has to be protected.</i>
<i>- I got things to protect, too.</i>

1160
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:17,063
<i>- Listen to me!</i>
<i>- All right, Remy.</i>

1161
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:19,483
<i>You leave that house,</i>
<i>you're an enemy to me.</i>

1162
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:21,902
<i>- Just trust me, all right?</i>
<i>- No! Trust me!</i>

1163
01:20:22,027 --> 01:20:26,615
<i>Where I come from,</i>
<i>you die with your secrets!</i>

1164
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:55,268
How long have you known Remy?

1165
01:20:55,393 --> 01:20:58,480
Detective Bressant? Just in …

1166
01:20:58,605 --> 01:21:01,816
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

1167
01:21:01,942 --> 01:21:03,902
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1168
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,449
How long you known Remy?

1169
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,660
What is this?

1170
01:21:11,785 --> 01:21:14,704
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

1171
01:21:14,788 --> 01:21:17,123
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

1172
01:21:17,249 --> 01:21:19,668
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

1173
01:21:19,793 --> 01:21:21,378
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

1174
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:22,504
I'm not.

1175
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:25,298
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

1176
01:21:25,423 --> 01:21:26,925
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1177
01:21:27,008 --> 01:21:29,469
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

1178
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:32,472
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

1179
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:34,808
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

1180
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:36,685
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

1181
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,687
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

1182
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:41,231
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose …

1183
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:44,192
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

1184
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,487
I haven't been honest with you.

1185
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,532
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

1186
01:21:50,657 --> 01:21:53,493
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

1187
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:54,786
The other guy cracked his skull.

1188
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:57,330
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

1189
01:21:57,455 --> 01:22:01,793
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

1190
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:04,629
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

1191
01:22:04,713 --> 01:22:07,591
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

1192
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,342
So you knew Detective Bressant.

1193
01:22:09,467 --> 01:22:11,678
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

1194
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:15,015
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

1195
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,933
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

1196
01:22:17,017 --> 01:22:18,852
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

1197
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:20,520
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who … Who …

1198
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:25,567
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

1199
01:22:28,153 --> 01:22:29,821
Why would I do that?

1200
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:32,907
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

1201
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:35,994
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

1202
01:22:36,077 --> 01:22:38,038
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

1203
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:40,290
you're just like everybody else.

1204
01:22:40,373 --> 01:22:42,250
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

1205
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:43,918
And you thought
you could get away with it.

1206
01:22:44,044 --> 01:22:46,129
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

1207
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:48,548
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

1208
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,759
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

1209
01:22:50,884 --> 01:22:53,136
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

1210
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,512
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

1211
01:22:54,596 --> 01:22:55,639
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

1212
01:22:55,722 --> 01:22:57,349
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

1213
01:22:57,432 --> 01:22:58,642
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

1214
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:00,852
Can I get some service?

1215
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:02,270
Yeah.

1216
01:23:09,069 --> 01:23:10,445
What?

1217
01:23:12,072 --> 01:23:15,200
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

1218
01:23:15,283 --> 01:23:16,743
Thank you.

1219
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:20,080
Just give me a second.

1220
01:23:51,403 --> 01:23:54,280
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

1221
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,294
Go.

1222
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:15,635
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

1223
01:24:17,929 --> 01:24:20,473
<i>I was reading her a story</i>
<i>when Helene and Ray come home.</i>

1224
01:24:20,557 --> 01:24:21,641
<i>They didn't know I was there.</i>

1225
01:24:21,725 --> 01:24:25,270
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

1226
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:29,983
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

1227
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:32,152
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

1228
01:24:32,277 --> 01:24:33,987
What's the monkey gonna do?

1229
01:24:34,112 --> 01:24:35,405
- Oh, you know …
- I'm not …

1230
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:38,658
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

1231
01:24:38,742 --> 01:24:40,160
So I called Remy and told him.

1232
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:42,912
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine …

1233
01:24:42,996 --> 01:24:44,664
And then what?

1234
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:49,502
We took her.

1235
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:55,091
<i>Remy laid out this plan.</i>
<i>It seemed easy.</i>

1236
01:24:55,175 --> 01:24:58,011
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

1237
01:24:58,136 --> 01:25:00,180
then we put her back. You know?

1238
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:02,265
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

1239
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:03,850
My sister learns a lesson.

1240
01:25:04,184 --> 01:25:07,020
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

1241
01:25:07,103 --> 01:25:10,023
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

1242
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,691
They were gonna handle the cops.

1243
01:25:11,775 --> 01:25:13,943
But Bea, she went nuts.

1244
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:16,613
<i>Started calling the papers. Hired you.</i>

1245
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:19,032
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

1246
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:23,036
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

1247
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:27,290
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

1248
01:25:27,373 --> 01:25:30,043
<i>They got Chris Mullen</i>
<i>to set up Cheese at the quarry.</i>

1249
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:33,713
15K and a chance to be the boss.

1250
01:25:36,508 --> 01:25:38,802
<i>Cheese figured out</i>
<i>what was happening.</i>

1251
01:25:38,885 --> 01:25:42,305
<i>Even though it was too late,</i>
<i>he started shooting.</i>

1252
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:44,349
<i>Panicking.</i>

1253
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:49,312
<i>And she just fell. I mean, she just …</i>

1254
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,064
She fell in.

1255
01:25:52,524 --> 01:25:54,150
She's gone.

1256
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:56,402
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

1257
01:25:56,486 --> 01:25:58,696
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

1258
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:04,244
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

1259
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:06,913
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1260
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:12,085
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

1261
01:26:12,252 --> 01:26:16,422
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

1262
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,342
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

1263
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:21,177
smoke a doobie with some guys.

1264
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:23,012
Two hours.

1265
01:26:24,764 --> 01:26:27,433
Amanda literally roasted.

1266
01:26:28,726 --> 01:26:30,228
She was three.

1267
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:37,277
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

1268
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:42,949
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

1269
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:48,121
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

1270
01:26:49,455 --> 01:26:51,791
Like a fucking pot roast.

1271
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,296
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

1272
01:26:56,379 --> 01:27:00,133
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

1273
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:05,054
Bartender. Open the safe. Now.

1274
01:27:06,723 --> 01:27:10,643
Everybody needs to shut up and stay
calm. On the floor. On the floor!

1275
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:12,395
- Hands on your head. Do it.
- Oh, my God.

1276
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:14,063
Everybody stays calm,
this'll be over in a minute.

1277
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:17,108
Hey, do you know
whose bar this is, shithead?

1278
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:20,528
Or you can get wise, it's up to you.

1279
01:27:23,281 --> 01:27:25,074
What did you say?

1280
01:27:25,825 --> 01:27:27,869
You're a talker, huh?

1281
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:29,495
Just keep revving, motherfucker.

1282
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,664
Don't antagonise him. He's got a gun.

1283
01:27:31,748 --> 01:27:35,084
- Oh, just keep yapping away.
- I didn't say nothing.

1284
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,003
You should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

1285
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:38,504
Shut the fuck up, for Christ's sake.

1286
01:27:38,588 --> 01:27:41,341
- Just keep talking, pal.
- I didn't say nothing.

1287
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:42,759
Close your eyes.

1288
01:27:42,842 --> 01:27:43,968
- Fuck!
- Remy Bressant.

1289
01:27:44,052 --> 01:27:46,346
Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant.

1290
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:49,182
Oh, fuck, God. Amanda McCready
was taken by Remy Bressant!

1291
01:27:49,265 --> 01:27:51,059
- Wait. Wait. Jesus.
- Remy Bressant.

1292
01:27:51,142 --> 01:27:52,685
God damn it. Remy Bressant!

1293
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:53,853
Amanda McCready was taken

1294
01:27:53,937 --> 01:27:55,021
- by Remy Bressant.
- Jesus. I told him.

1295
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:57,607
I told him we took her for ransom.
I told him. I told him, Remy.

1296
01:27:57,690 --> 01:28:01,110
Please, I told him we took her
for ransom. I did it.

1297
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:03,029
Remy, please.

1298
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:04,739
Please.

1299
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:24,884
Are you all right?

1300
01:28:26,052 --> 01:28:27,095
Stay with him.

1301
01:29:29,449 --> 01:29:31,242
Drop your gun.

1302
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,662
Put it down!

1303
01:29:39,417 --> 01:29:42,920
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

1304
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:54,098
What did you do?

1305
01:29:54,974 --> 01:29:56,476
Did you get her killed?

1306
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:01,022
Say yes.

1307
01:30:05,985 --> 01:30:07,320
Say yes.

1308
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:09,739
Say yes!

1309
01:30:10,656 --> 01:30:14,827
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1310
01:30:29,175 --> 01:30:31,177
She was a child.

1311
01:30:33,346 --> 01:30:35,223
I love children.

1312
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:15,680
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

1313
01:31:17,056 --> 01:31:20,601
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

1314
01:31:21,853 --> 01:31:25,064
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

1315
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:28,818
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

1316
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:31,070
Is corruption looked on lightly?

1317
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:32,822
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

1318
01:31:32,905 --> 01:31:34,115
Whoa, hold on.

1319
01:31:34,198 --> 01:31:36,617
You charge people money
as a detective.

1320
01:31:36,701 --> 01:31:40,621
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

1321
01:31:40,705 --> 01:31:43,624
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

1322
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:46,085
You're baffled. Right?

1323
01:31:47,628 --> 01:31:52,091
No, because, strange as it might seem,

1324
01:31:52,175 --> 01:31:55,428
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

1325
01:31:56,095 --> 01:31:57,346
You're a fresh prick. You know that?

1326
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,640
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

1327
01:31:59,724 --> 01:32:00,808
put in my mailbox.

1328
01:32:00,892 --> 01:32:03,936
And because I read a transcript of
a call that Cheese put into the station.

1329
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,104
A 911 call?

1330
01:32:05,188 --> 01:32:08,232
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

1331
01:32:08,316 --> 01:32:09,609
To Remy Bressant at the station.

1332
01:32:09,692 --> 01:32:11,736
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

1333
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:13,613
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

1334
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:15,573
and there was a call.

1335
01:32:15,656 --> 01:32:17,575
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

1336
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:20,453
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

1337
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:25,124
So, did you hear a tape?

1338
01:32:26,459 --> 01:32:28,794
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

1339
01:32:28,878 --> 01:32:31,088
Did you see a transcript?

1340
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:38,387
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

1341
01:32:48,648 --> 01:32:50,107
<i>Kids forgive.</i>

1342
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:51,651
What do they get for it?

1343
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:54,153
Amanda literally roasted.

1344
01:33:03,496 --> 01:33:04,664
<i>You think I don't miss her.</i>

1345
01:33:04,747 --> 01:33:07,166
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1346
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,377
I love children.

1347
01:33:13,881 --> 01:33:18,135
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

1348
01:33:20,388 --> 01:33:22,139
Are you sure?

1349
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:24,225
No.

1350
01:33:28,062 --> 01:33:29,939
Are you coming?

1351
01:33:30,564 --> 01:33:31,857
No.

1352
01:33:43,494 --> 01:33:46,247
<i>Doyle brought Remy</i>
<i>from Louisiana back in '72.</i>

1353
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:49,041
<i>Care to read the highlighted portion?</i>

1354
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,055
Taking a trip?

1355
01:34:03,139 --> 01:34:04,890
Patrick Kenzie.

1356
01:34:06,475 --> 01:34:09,270
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1357
01:34:09,353 --> 01:34:11,981
Remy Bressant died last night.

1358
01:34:12,523 --> 01:34:15,568
I was told. It's a shame.

1359
01:34:16,986 --> 01:34:21,574
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

1360
01:34:21,657 --> 01:34:23,492
He was a good man.

1361
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:27,496
We don't know
why people do what they do.

1362
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:30,166
Everybody looks out his own window.

1363
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:32,585
And everyone's got their reasons.

1364
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:44,680
- Hey.
- Hi.

1365
01:34:44,764 --> 01:34:46,057
- How are you?
- Good.

1366
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,184
<i>Nick! They're firing at me.</i>

1367
01:34:48,267 --> 01:34:49,935
Nick, you hear me? You okay?
They're firing at me!

1368
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:51,187
Remy!

1369
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:53,522
- I heard something go in the water!
- Ambush! Ambush!

1370
01:34:53,606 --> 01:34:56,484
- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

1371
01:34:57,234 --> 01:34:58,569
<i>Panicking.</i>

1372
01:34:58,652 --> 01:35:01,447
<i>Amanda got scared.</i>
<i>She started running.</i>

1373
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:04,450
<i>She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.</i>

1374
01:35:08,913 --> 01:35:11,582
<i>Twenty-nine-year-old Chris Mullen</i>
<i>was gunned down last night</i>

1375
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:12,917
<i>in an apparent robbery.</i>

1376
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,087
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

1377
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,338
Make you a sandwich, okay?

1378
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:18,631
- All right.
- That's my girl.

1379
01:35:18,714 --> 01:35:19,757
<i>Don't go down there.</i>

1380
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,509
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

1381
01:35:21,592 --> 01:35:22,718
I got no problem doing the time.

1382
01:35:22,802 --> 01:35:25,221
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

1383
01:35:25,304 --> 01:35:26,597
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>- I got things to protect, too.</i>

1384
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,933
<i>You leave that house,</i>
<i>you're an enemy to me</i>

1385
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:30,226
<i>and you're a danger to Amanda.</i>

1386
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:32,436
Please, I told him
we took her for ransom. I did it.

1387
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,605
I told him. Remy, please.

1388
01:35:39,693 --> 01:35:40,945
So now you know.

1389
01:35:41,821 --> 01:35:44,323
<i>My sister's not stable. She's on crack.</i>

1390
01:35:44,407 --> 01:35:46,492
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

1391
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:48,786
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

1392
01:35:48,869 --> 01:35:50,955
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>
<i>She's an addict.</i>

1393
01:35:51,038 --> 01:35:52,623
Bigot. Drug mule.

1394
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:55,751
The child will be dead
or on the street in 10 years.

1395
01:35:55,835 --> 01:35:58,462
<i>- What about the uncle?</i>
<i>- He can never tell anyone.</i>

1396
01:35:58,546 --> 01:36:01,966
<i>Not even his wife.</i>
<i>Or he'll never see her again.</i>

1397
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:06,011
<i>It's worth it to him.</i>
<i>Know she'll have a better life.</i>

1398
01:36:06,095 --> 01:36:09,098
<i>Do one last good thing</i>
<i>before we hang it up.</i>

1399
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:13,936
<i>How many children</i>
<i>have we seen destroyed?</i>

1400
01:36:14,895 --> 01:36:16,188
<i>Enough.</i>

1401
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,859
Does it make you feel better?

1402
01:36:20,693 --> 01:36:24,029
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

1403
01:36:24,113 --> 01:36:26,449
That you took her to be saved.

1404
01:36:26,532 --> 01:36:28,367
From her own mother?

1405
01:36:30,536 --> 01:36:33,747
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

1406
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,335
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

1407
01:36:38,419 --> 01:36:41,130
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

1408
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:45,134
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

1409
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:48,554
You turn around.

1410
01:36:48,637 --> 01:36:52,892
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

1411
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:56,812
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

1412
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:02,193
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in 10.

1413
01:37:02,276 --> 01:37:05,070
Thought you would've
done that by now.

1414
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:09,575
You know why you haven't?

1415
01:37:11,494 --> 01:37:15,414
Because you think
this might be an irreparable mistake.

1416
01:37:15,498 --> 01:37:20,169
Because deep inside you, you know
it doesn't matter what the rules say.

1417
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:22,296
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

1418
01:37:22,421 --> 01:37:26,258
"Is she better off here or better off
there," you know the answer.

1419
01:37:26,342 --> 01:37:28,344
And you always will.

1420
01:37:30,262 --> 01:37:35,267
You … You could do a right thing here.

1421
01:37:35,351 --> 01:37:37,102
A good thing.

1422
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:40,231
Men live their whole lives
without getting this chance.

1423
01:37:40,314 --> 01:37:42,191
You walk away from it,

1424
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:44,568
you may not regret it
when you get home.

1425
01:37:44,652 --> 01:37:45,986
You may not regret it for a year,

1426
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:49,782
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

1427
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:54,954
I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she …

1428
01:37:56,121 --> 01:38:00,292
She'll be dragging around a couple of
tattered, damaged children of her own,

1429
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:04,838
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

1430
01:38:05,839 --> 01:38:08,050
You know what? Maybe that'll happen.

1431
01:38:08,133 --> 01:38:12,304
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

1432
01:38:14,139 --> 01:38:16,809
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

1433
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:18,602
is have to apologise
to a grown woman

1434
01:38:18,686 --> 01:38:19,770
who comes to me and says,

1435
01:38:19,853 --> 01:38:21,939
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

1436
01:38:22,022 --> 01:38:24,233
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

1437
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:27,861
"And you did, you found me
with some strange family.

1438
01:38:27,987 --> 01:38:30,739
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

1439
01:38:30,823 --> 01:38:33,659
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

1440
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:38,664
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

1441
01:38:40,332 --> 01:38:42,918
"They stole me.

1442
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:46,714
"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

1443
01:38:46,839 --> 01:38:50,009
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

1444
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:53,262
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

1445
01:38:53,345 --> 01:38:55,848
but I'll never forgive myself.

1446
01:39:00,019 --> 01:39:04,690
I did what I did for the sake of the child.

1447
01:39:06,358 --> 01:39:10,029
All right. For me, too.

1448
01:39:12,698 --> 01:39:17,953
But now, I'm asking you
for the sake of the child.

1449
01:39:20,623 --> 01:39:22,458
I'm begging you.

1450
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:29,590
You think about it.

1451
01:39:38,891 --> 01:39:40,601
She's happy.

1452
01:39:42,311 --> 01:39:43,729
What?

1453
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:47,066
She's happy here. I saw her.

1454
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:51,111
Angie, don't do this.

1455
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:54,198
If you call the police,
they will send her back.

1456
01:39:54,281 --> 01:39:57,409
I'm not sending her anywhere.
Helene is her mother.

1457
01:39:58,410 --> 01:39:59,995
She's better off here.

1458
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:03,916
Why? Because he's got money,
and he makes her sandwiches?

1459
01:40:04,249 --> 01:40:06,001
Because he loves her.

1460
01:40:06,085 --> 01:40:09,421
- Helene loves her, too.
- Helene doesn't treat her that way.

1461
01:40:09,505 --> 01:40:11,423
Well, maybe she'll change.

1462
01:40:11,757 --> 01:40:13,717
She won't change.
People don't change.

1463
01:40:13,801 --> 01:40:15,386
Helene is arsenic.

1464
01:40:15,469 --> 01:40:17,680
Angie, I know that this is hard.

1465
01:40:17,763 --> 01:40:20,099
Look at me, I know it's hard.

1466
01:40:21,141 --> 01:40:24,436
But I need you to stand by me.
I need you to say,

1467
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:25,646
"We're gonna make the right decision,

1468
01:40:25,771 --> 01:40:26,939
"and we're gonna
make everything okay."

1469
01:40:27,022 --> 01:40:29,149
Everything will be okay.

1470
01:40:29,274 --> 01:40:30,359
Because we're gonna leave her here,

1471
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:32,569
and every now and then
we're gonna talk about her.

1472
01:40:32,653 --> 01:40:35,781
And where she is,
and about what grade she's in.

1473
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:39,910
And that'll be okay, because
we're gonna know what school she's in,

1474
01:40:39,993 --> 01:40:42,329
and we're gonna know she's happy,
and she's got birthday parties,

1475
01:40:42,454 --> 01:40:45,374
and she smiles every day,
and she has sleepovers.

1476
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:49,670
Baby, I'm sorry.

1477
01:40:49,795 --> 01:40:53,382
But you can't ask me
to do something that I can't do.

1478
01:40:56,552 --> 01:40:59,304
And you can't ask me to live with it.

1479
01:41:00,931 --> 01:41:04,810
Patrick, for me. Please?

1480
01:41:08,647 --> 01:41:14,319
I will hate you for doing this,
and I don't want to.

You must be so excited.
Give us your feelings.

1496
01:43:25,117 --> 01:43:26,159
Oh, my sweetheart. Oh, my.

1497
01:43:26,285 --> 01:43:28,829
Helene, the whole world wants to know
what you're feeling right now.

1498
01:43:29,288 --> 01:43:31,540
How are you, sweetheart?

1499
01:43:31,623 --> 01:43:33,667
Oh, my heart is brimming.

1500
01:43:33,792 --> 01:43:40,132
And just God bless to everyone
and thank you to all …

1501
01:43:40,257 --> 01:43:43,343
To all the policemen and the firemen,

1502
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:46,096
I feel like 9/11 right now.

1503
01:43:46,179 --> 01:43:49,641
<i>Oh, I swear to God, I mean, just …</i>

1504
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:51,768
<i>Do you have any comments</i>
<i>for parents out there</i>

1505
01:43:51,852 --> 01:43:53,228
<i>that might be in a similar situation?</i>

1506
01:43:53,312 --> 01:43:55,939
<i>Oh, just never let your kids</i>
<i>out of your sight.</i>

1507
01:43:56,023 --> 01:43:57,733
<i>Don't trust them to no one.</i>

1508
01:43:57,816 --> 01:44:00,903
<i>And just keep them in your arms,</i>

1509
01:44:00,986 --> 01:44:04,114
<i>as much as they're in your heart,</i>
<i>you keep them in your arms.</i>

1510
01:44:04,197 --> 01:44:06,950
<i>How about that?</i>
<i>A great end to that story.</i>

1511
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:09,870
<i>- Good news for everybody.</i>
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

1512
01:44:34,144 --> 01:44:37,814
- Sorry, I had to get some stuff.
- It's all right.

1513
01:44:41,026 --> 01:44:43,487
You wanna talk for a minute?

1514
01:44:46,698 --> 01:44:49,034
There's nothing to say.

1515
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:55,350
Sorry for being rude, I gotta be
out of here in, like, two minutes.

1516
01:45:55,434 --> 01:45:57,227
Do your thing.

1517
01:46:06,445 --> 01:46:08,697
- Think he'll like me?
- Who?

1518
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:10,115
My date.

1519
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:13,201
Oh, how could he not?

1520
01:46:13,285 --> 01:46:15,454
You're sweet.

1521
01:46:15,537 --> 01:46:17,706
He seen me on my <i>American Victim.</i>

1522
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:20,792
He wrote me letters,
I was like, "Whatever."

1523
01:46:20,876 --> 01:46:24,796
But then he seen my <i>Meredith Vieira,</i>
he drove down here from Providence.

1524
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:27,883
I'm like, "That's romantic." Right?

1525
01:46:27,966 --> 01:46:29,384
How's your girlfriend?

1526
01:46:29,468 --> 01:46:31,470
She's all right,
she's at the North Shore with her sister.

1527
01:46:31,553 --> 01:46:34,222
Oh, hope she got
better family than I do, right?

1528
01:46:34,306 --> 01:46:36,600
Those dirty motherfuckers.

1529
01:46:40,437 --> 01:46:43,440
She don't get smart, I'll take you out.

1530
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:48,070
- How's Bea?
- Fuck Bea.

1531
01:46:48,153 --> 01:46:50,238
I banned her from the apartment.

1532
01:46:50,322 --> 01:46:54,409
She sold her unit,
moved out fancy-pants Melrose.

1533
01:46:54,493 --> 01:46:57,579
Don't think she don't hate you
for Lionel going to jail, neither.

1534
01:46:57,662 --> 01:46:59,581
Well, that's probably
why she never paid my bill.

1535
01:46:59,664 --> 01:47:01,917
You should fucking sue.

1536
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,169
How about you, Helene?

1537
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:06,922
You hate me?

1538
01:47:07,005 --> 01:47:08,673
Fuck no.

1539
01:47:08,799 --> 01:47:12,844
Brother or not, he took my kid.
Fuck Lionel. She could have been hurt.

1540
01:47:12,928 --> 01:47:15,972
- What about Amanda?
- What about Amanda?

1541
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:20,852
- Who's gonna watch her?
- Dottie.

1542
01:47:20,936 --> 01:47:23,438
Yeah, does Dottie know that?

1543
01:47:23,522 --> 01:47:26,274
- She will in five minutes.
- Great.

1544
01:47:26,358 --> 01:47:30,821
Fuck, I'm gonna be late, too.
Unless you don't mind sitting for her.

1545
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:36,493
- Yeah, sure.
- For real?

1546
01:47:37,536 --> 01:47:40,622
- Yeah, that's fine.
- She likes you.

1547
01:47:44,042 --> 01:47:46,211
Bye, sweetheart.

1548
01:47:46,294 --> 01:47:48,505
You're a godsend, Patrick.

1549
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,842
Bye.

1550
01:48:09,401 --> 01:48:11,695
Is that Mirabelle?

1551
01:48:12,904 --> 01:48:14,865
Annabelle.
