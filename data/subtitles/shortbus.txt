1
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:44,603
Are you a top or a bottom?

2
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:47,407
I beg your pardon?

3
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:48,981
I mean in real life.

4
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,807
This is real life.

5
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,824
Let me put it this way:

6
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,401
Do you think we should get out of Iraq?

7
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:57,469
Is your daddy paying for this?

8
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,811
No.

9
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:03,838
You're taking a picture
of yourself at Ground Zero --

10
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:05,843
do you smile?

11
00:03:06,758 --> 00:03:08,126
Get on the fucking bed!

12
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,644
If you could have any superpower,
what would it be?

13
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,297
The power to make you interesting.

14
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:35,414
Do you think you'll ever have kids?

15
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,576
You only have an hour.

16
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:37,704
It's my money.

17
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:41,345
Well, you fucking trust
fund ** piece of fetish shit!

18
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:42,707
I'm sorry!

19
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,742
I'm sorry what?

20
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,770
I'm sorry, Mistress Severin.

21
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,685
But I'm serious.

22
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:48,935
What are your thoughts on procreation?

23
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:51,232
I want to do it by myself,

24
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:53,456
in the dark.

25
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,030
Like a worm.

26
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,762
Can you describe your last orgasm?

27
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,846
It was great.

28
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:54,965
It was like time had stopped
and I was completely alone.

29
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:03,106
Let's go, partner.

30
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,019
I'm gonna miss my fucking train.

31
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:31,773
Oh, God, oh.

32
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:35,851
Oh, easy, easy.

33
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:54,831
Were you sad afterwards?

34
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:58,473
Yeah.

35
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:00,765
Why?

36
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,864
Cause time hadn't stopped.

37
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:06,964
And I wasn't alone.

38
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:17,623
Hey hon, I'm home!

39
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,406
Hey.

40
00:07:21,877 --> 00:07:23,193
You doing yoga?

41
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:24,436
Yeah.

42
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:25,437
Sorry, I would have been here sooner.

43
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:28,097
Somebody threw themselves
in front of the L train.

44
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:32,428
Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:35,665
God, you're so sweaty.

46
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:36,934
I love it.

47
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,844
Wow!
- I just jerked off, actually.

48
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:42,899
You did?

49
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,246
Did you think of me?

50
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,377
I'll go put on some clothes.

51
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,824
This is recording!

52
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:56,824
Fuck!

53
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,804
When are you going to let me see
what you're working on?

54
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:03,805
Soon.

55
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,609
Thank you.

56
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,905
<i>Thank you... </i>

57
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:24,758
cutie.

58
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:27,246
That was--
oh God, that was incredible.

59
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,140
Definitely.

60
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:38,787
Look, I do feel sorry for people
who don't have what we have.

61
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:44,771
Like Brad and Cheryl.

62
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,445
Brad and Cheryl?

63
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:51,037
Yeah, the couple I've been working with.

64
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:54,346
Can you keep a secret?

65
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:56,032
Of course I can keep a secret.

66
00:08:57,714 --> 00:09:02,742
Yesterday Cheryl told me
she's been faking her orgasms.

67
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:07,119
She won't tell Brad because
she's afraid he'll break up with her.

68
00:09:07,658 --> 00:09:09,614
So I finally told her what I think she should do.

69
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,862
What should she do?

70
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,881
She should keep faking.

71
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:17,281
It's a completely legitimate
strategy to buy time.

72
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:18,282
Really?

73
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:23,258
Cause the thing is, if she tells Brad,
he's gonna think it's all his fault.

74
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:26,268
You know?

75
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:29,691
And the thing is, an orgasm
isn't something Brad can give her.

76
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:32,956
She has to claim it for herself.

77
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,181
What do you think?

78
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,851
What do you mean with,
what do I think?

79
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:00,264
Hi.

80
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,594
Jamie and Jamie.

81
00:10:08,385 --> 00:10:10,559
Actually, I just started
to call myself James again.

82
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,801
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.
- It's all right.

83
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,228
Jamie and James.

84
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,460
Tell me about yourselves.

85
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:21,064
Well, I'm Jamie Mitchell.

86
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:25,741
I was a child actor. I was on a
TV show called "One of the family".

87
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:31,145
Where the rich black couple
adopted the poor white trash kid,

88
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,156
and they didn't have the heart
to tell him he's not black?

89
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:36,252
"I'm an albino!"

90
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,303
I'm Canadian.

91
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,229
Well, Jamie and I met
when I was doing research

92
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,674
for "Take him from the streets".
I paid a street hustler.

93
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:49,552
And -- James was -- well, he was --

94
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:51,604
escorting at the time.

95
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:54,260
James, what do you do now?

96
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:56,090
Well, I don't hustle any more.

97
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:57,615
Um, I guess I'm a...

98
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,616
He's a lifeguard.

99
00:10:59,695 --> 00:11:00,694
Yeah, at a...

100
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:02,615
a gym jacuzzi.

101
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,746
Can you tell me why you're here?

102
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:09,481
Recently we started about opening up
our relationship, you know.

103
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:10,482
Sexually.

104
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:16,558
I was a little surprised
when Jamie mentioned that he wanted to do this,

105
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,573
and then I thought, well,
we've been together five years,

106
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:20,574
and -- I mean, let's face it,

107
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,317
monogamy's for straight people.

108
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:27,385
But we thought we should get
an impartial opinion from a sex therapist.

109
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Dr Lin?

110
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,140
Actually I prefer the term "couples counselor".

111
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:37,197
Although I have a great deal
of experience in sex therapy.

112
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,567
Jamie, I'm wondering --
can you do me a big favor?

113
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:41,568
Sure.

114
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:42,569
Leave us alone.

115
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:46,735
'K...

116
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:50,529
Thanks.

117
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:51,401
All right.

118
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:57,138
Why are you here?

119
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,771
Well, something did happen at work last week.

120
00:12:04,884 --> 00:12:08,670
Um, would you mind if
I taped myself talking about this?

121
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,134
See, I'm making this little film, and
I want to tape myself telling this story.

122
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:14,945
Just me.

123
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:15,946
Sure, OK.

124
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,238
So I was at the gym last week...

125
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:54,658
Oh, Jesus!

126
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,268
There's something in there!
Something's on the bottom there!

127
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,570
Can you help me?

128
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,403
What was that?

129
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,263
It must have been a brownout.

130
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,264
Are you OK?

131
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:51,265
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:13:51,266 --> 00:13:52,266
Everything's fine.

133
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,948
You know, we're making some progress.

134
00:13:56,195 --> 00:14:00,212
I got to hear from James,
and now I'd love to hear from you, Jamie.

135
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,315
Tell me what you need in your life right now.

136
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,866
Well, I need Jamie.

137
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,416
Besides James.

138
00:14:12,277 --> 00:14:14,938
We love each other so much.

139
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:17,308
I just...

140
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,480
I don't want to lose him.

141
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:25,759
And I think about him and other guys,

142
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,384
and then I think about me and other guys,

143
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:32,103
and I think, maybe there's an opportunity here.

144
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:37,520
I mean, there's a lot of good and cute people in
the world who don't have any love in their lives,

145
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:40,504
and I think we could help them.
I mean, I love cute people.

146
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,804
Tell me what you need, in one sentence.

147
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,014
I love everybody.

148
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,011
That's not a need.

149
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:49,126
I need to love everybody.

150
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:54,759
Wait! Did you just hear me?

151
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,920
"I need to love everybody"?

152
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,457
How can I love everybody?
I can't even meet everybody!

153
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,359
Wow! You're good!

154
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Thank you!
- Jamie...

155
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,772
Thank you!
I'm having a breakthrough!

156
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,290
Jamie, that's actually called a "false epiphany".

157
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,459
Come on, give me a break!
Did you give him a breakthrough?

158
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:11,429
You don't just dole out the breakthroughs.

159
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,430
Well, you can!

160
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:13,430
Don't you give yourself a breakthrough?

161
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:15,073
I don't need a breakthrough.

162
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:16,183
You're not gonna give me the breakthrough?

163
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:17,251
I do not need a breakthrough.

164
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:18,629
We all need breakthroughs.

165
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,651
Well shut up and sit down!

166
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,686
You shut up! And I...

167
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,521
Sit down!

168
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:25,510
Oh my God. I...

169
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:27,816
I am so sorry.

170
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,973
I'm not gonna charge you for this session.

171
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:35,103
It's a...

172
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:41,433
I'm preorgasmic.

173
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,103
Does that mean you're about to have one?

174
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:48,104
No.

175
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,524
I've never had one.

176
00:18:15,621 --> 00:18:16,522
Get the hell out of here.

177
00:18:16,523 --> 00:18:17,127
Everybody hates you.

178
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:17,730
Do you know who I am?

179
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:19,309
Yes, I know who you are.

180
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:20,504
Dr Donuts.

181
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,727
Eat my twat, Dr Donuts!

182
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:22,882
Fuck you!

183
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,650
I hate carbs!

184
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:27,509
What are you looking at?

185
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,598
Nothing. Um--

186
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:30,999
Jamie and, um, James told me to come here.

187
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,228
What's your name?

188
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,229
Sophia.

189
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,657
Oh, Sophia! I'm Justin Bond.
I'm the mistress of Shortbus.

190
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,658
Come on.

191
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:46,651
Do you know what a shortbus is?

192
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:47,459
No.

193
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,598
You've heard of the Big Yellow School Bus?

194
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:51,487
Well, this is the short one.

195
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:54,205
It's a salon for the gifted and challenged.

196
00:18:55,162 --> 00:18:56,161
Hi-ha!

197
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:59,548
That's Alice. She's got a cunt like
a wizard's sleeve.

198
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:01,515
This place has really taken off
in the last few years,

199
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:04,317
since all these young people
started flocking to the city.

200
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,800
Why would they come to New York?
It's so expensive to live here.

201
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:07,801
9-11.

202
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:10,300
It's the only thing real
that's ever happened to them.

203
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:13,307
Now in here is our performance room.

204
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:15,579
But tonight we're having a film festival.

205
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,507
They're boring as hell,
but I've found the more boring they are,

206
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:21,959
the more intelligent people think
they are. But watch.

207
00:19:26,846 --> 00:19:28,282
"I'm an albino!"

208
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:31,734
Oh, there's the Jamies.

209
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:35,036
Hey. Mmm. Good to see you.

210
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:36,037
Hi James.
- Hey.

211
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,036
I'm so glad you came.

212
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:44,296
I said to switch the films. We're gonna do
a three-hour Gertrude Stein documentary.

213
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:46,154
That sounds like a real weenie shrinker.

214
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,653
Come on, let's go get laid.

215
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:48,654
You're gonna be all right?

216
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,164
Yeah.

217
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,232
What's the matter?

218
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:53,678
Nothing.

219
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,960
Are you sure you wanna try this tonight?

220
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,602
No, that's too late.
It'll be good for us.

221
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,380
Are you OK with it?

222
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:03,032
Yeah...

223
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:10,841
If you find somebody and I don't,
you know, that's totally cool.

224
00:20:11,265 --> 00:20:14,838
But if I find somebody and you don't,
that's a dealbreaker for me. I can't do that.

225
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,839
No, don't do that.

226
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:20,408
I spend half of my time blowing
the NYPD to keep this place open.

227
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,301
I barely have any time for myself.

228
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:26,560
Here's the sex *** room.
This is where it all happens.

229
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,515
Aren't they beautiful?

230
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:43,877
It's not your average sort of Friday night event,
but people seem to be enjoying themselves.

231
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,497
Last week we had some people in here,
I had to throw them out,

232
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:48,326
'cause you know, this is my house...

233
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:35,091
Oh, this is Creamy.
She's your maître d'.

234
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,365
Pleased to meet you.
Can I help you with some condoms or lube?

235
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:38,938
No, I'm fine, thank you.

236
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:41,410
Well, then maybe some blondies.
These are cannabis-free,

237
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,411
the pot corn isn't.

238
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:43,411
Excuse me.

239
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:44,412
Pot corn.

240
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:46,851
These are actually not all for me.
Thank you so, so much.

241
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:48,789
Why don't you come in and have a look?

242
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:52,348
After all, voyeurism is participation.

243
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,253
Well?

244
00:21:57,254 --> 00:21:59,542
Now come on.

245
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,189
These bitches in there.
Eating asses and sucking cock,

246
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,237
and then they show up at the buffet
and say they're vegan.

247
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:07,254
Hi.

248
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,107
Any bites?

249
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:10,769
No.

250
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,770
I love these little gadgets.

251
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,747
Oh, this is Sophia.
She's a friend of the Jamies.

252
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:14,748
You know the Jamies?

253
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:17,394
I love the Jamies!
They're like the cutest couple in the whole world.

254
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:18,982
Do you think you could introduce me to them?

255
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:19,540
Yeah, probably.

256
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:22,291
I'm Ceth, with a C.
- Justin...

257
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:25,936
Hmm?
- Someone just came on your cat.

258
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,280
It's not funny!

259
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:29,852
Why can't they leave my pussy alone?

260
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:31,242
What is that?

261
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:34,548
That's the "yenta 650".
It's supposed to find me a husband.

262
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:35,549
How does it work?

263
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,550
I put in my profile...

264
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:37,883
"I got a match for you!"

265
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,126
Hi.
- I'm Magnus. And you are Keth?

266
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:50,681
That's actually Ceth. So you're 1. 9 meters tall?
What's that in feet and inches?

267
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:53,917
Do you know?
Where are you from?

268
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:56,027
Canada. - Oh really?
- 6 1/2 feet.

269
00:22:56,902 --> 00:22:59,447
6 1/2. So that makes...
a 15 cm dick...

270
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,358
Oh my God!

271
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:02,750
Maybe we can talk about this if we sit?

272
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:05,011
Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Great.

273
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:06,032
Is my hair OK?

274
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:07,933
Yeah, it's fine.

275
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:11,689
Thanks.

276
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:14,467
Sophia, come sit with us.

277
00:23:14,468 --> 00:23:15,468
OK.

278
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,296
You make it sound like the Loch Ness monster.

279
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:23,350
It doesn't seem like it should be so hard to find.

280
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:27,545
It is so elusive, you know.
I'm starting to wonder if it's even natural.

281
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,945
It's not necessary for procreation, is it?

282
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:31,960
It only seems to appear in a handful of species

283
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:36,413
like the rabbit, the ferret,
the bottle-nosed dolphin, the macaque, the bonobo, ...

284
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,574
"I'm an albino!"

285
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:40,575
Thanks.

286
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:43,922
Well I am, so it meant a lot to me.

287
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:44,923
<i>Oh, that means a lot to me, actually. </i>

288
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:47,288
Hey.

289
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,430
Hey.

290
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,778
You gonna be around later?

291
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:51,687
Sure.

292
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:55,682
Sorry. Go on.

293
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:57,481
You know, I feel like we're inundated by images

294
00:23:57,517 --> 00:24:01,093
of these super deluxe babes
in the throes of the ultimate orgasm...

295
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:04,017
I think it's just some myth to sell more magazines.

296
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:09,184
Whoa, myth? Did you just say that
female orgasms are a myth?

297
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:10,185
Yeah.

298
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:13,711
I'm here to tell you, sister, they're not.
- Here we go.

299
00:24:13,746 --> 00:24:15,633
I've seen them happen before.
They're completely real.

300
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,112
Shabbos, Sophia.
Sophia, Shabbos.

301
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:19,113
Hey kids.

302
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,709
Nice to meet you.
I'm Shabbos Goy,

303
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,246
and if you're Jewish
I can help you turn on your lights.

304
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:27,484
I'm agnostic.

305
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,406
Do you like performance art?

306
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:29,496
Yeah, I do.

307
00:24:29,531 --> 00:24:31,786
OK, I'm gonna do a show soon,
and I think that you should come to it.

308
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:34,064
Might be a sort of therapeutic
for your little problem.

309
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:34,764
Excuse me?

310
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:38,804
I have to say I find the fact that you
can't have an orgasm completely unacceptable.

311
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:40,229
I would really like to work with you.

312
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,741
Shabbos!

313
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,400
Maybe I can help her!

314
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:44,425
You know, I'm sort of like a orgasmic superhero.

315
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:51,151
"Have I got a match for you?
Oy, **! Oy, sheyne ponim! Sheyne ponim at 11 o'clock!
Come on, just get off and go! Why so picky?"

316
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:53,762
Shit!

317
00:24:53,763 --> 00:24:56,211
Sir, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

318
00:24:56,246 --> 00:25:00,177
My pacemaker. This odd vibration.

319
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:01,800
I'm so sorry.

320
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:02,801
No, no...

321
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,682
I think that was my Yenta.

322
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:05,683
Your-- your who?

323
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,273
Don't I know you from somewhere?

324
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:13,504
Well...

325
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:17,846
I used to be the mayor of New York.

326
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,871
Oh my God.

327
00:25:21,872 --> 00:25:23,737
It's called "Ode to the female secretion",

328
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,866
and it works in five different movements:

329
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:28,599
Lubrication, Lactation,

330
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,851
Ejaculation --which is my favorite--,

331
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:31,933
then Urinatinon and Menstruation.

332
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,461
I think my throat's closing.

333
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:34,598
I can't use the last two.

334
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,903
Are you a really heavy bleeder?

335
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:37,645
On my second and third days.

336
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:38,646
That's so hot.

337
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:42,875
You know, I use menstrual blood as makeup in my show.

338
00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:47,129
Tampons. Just pull them right out,
fresh from the fruit, and use it as lipstick.

339
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,130
It's a period piece.

340
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,331
You're kidding.

341
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:53,621
I should really use that in the show. That's
the first funny thing you've ever said in your life.

342
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:55,580
Would you be interested in doing that?

343
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:56,581
You mean, donating... my...

344
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:59,244
Some of your menstrual blood for my face.

345
00:25:59,246 --> 00:26:00,246
Oh, come on now!

346
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:00,747
What?

347
00:26:00,747 --> 00:26:02,248
Join the line!

348
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:05,580
Did that make you...
I think it just made you uncomfortable

349
00:26:05,581 --> 00:26:06,380
because you're a little baby homo.
- What are you doing?

350
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:09,253
Does this really have to do with an orgasm?

351
00:26:09,254 --> 00:26:10,254
It comes from her fucking pussy,

352
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:11,918
why are you so fucking uncomfortable about it?

353
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:12,919
I can deal with pussies!

354
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,363
I'm around them all the time!

355
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,290
I'm not talking about your fucking boyfriend.

356
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:18,846
Get off of me!

357
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:20,861
You got a boner!

358
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:22,726
That's my cellphone,
you fucking albino butch faggot!

359
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,102
Want to fuck me there with your mangina?

360
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:29,312
*** just for cockfucking me, you fucking dick.

361
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:37,229
Hi.

362
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:39,651
Are you OK?

363
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:42,543
There's just, uh...

364
00:26:42,544 --> 00:26:44,054
lots of, uh...

365
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:46,122
Men?

366
00:26:46,124 --> 00:26:47,124
Yes.
- Jesus.

367
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,125
My name is Bitch.

368
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:50,051
Hi Bitch.

369
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,098
You are?

370
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
Sophia.

371
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:53,878
Hey, sister. Sit down.

372
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,056
You're in the right place.

373
00:26:56,057 --> 00:26:57,057
You're in the Pussy Palace.

374
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,404
So you're a sex therapist
but you've never had an orgasm?

375
00:27:01,405 --> 00:27:03,872
Actually I prefer the term "couples counselor".

376
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:04,873
Have you ever been with a woman?

377
00:27:05,898 --> 00:27:09,308
Uh, no, you know--
I'm not sure if I'm wired that way.

378
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:11,896
Rob's the only person I've ever been with.

379
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:12,897
Wow.
- It's cool.

380
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:13,897
My god.

381
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:16,473
You must have some major blue clit.

382
00:27:18,008 --> 00:27:19,639
Did you do those PC muscle exercises?

383
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:21,591
You know, the PC muscle that controls your pee?

384
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:23,755
So when you're peeing next time,
just, you know,

385
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:27,551
squeeze it up and then let it go.
Squeeze it up, let it go.

386
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:28,552
That's good for your orgasms.

387
00:27:28,553 --> 00:27:30,860
I'm doing it right now.

388
00:27:30,861 --> 00:27:31,861
Can you guys tell from my face?

389
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,825
May I ask you a question?

390
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,290
I wanna know what did your very orgasm feel like.

391
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,167
Welcome to Lifetime Television.

392
00:27:43,202 --> 00:27:44,792
It's all about your pussies.

393
00:27:44,826 --> 00:27:50,606
This is gonna sound really cheesy, but I felt like
I was shooting out creative energy into the world,

394
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:58,711
and it was merging with other people's energy,
and then there was no was. There was peace.

395
00:27:58,712 --> 00:27:59,712
Wow.

396
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,282
Well, mine was definitely with Little Prince.

397
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,604
We had this incredible connection.

398
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:10,157
We just like made it really slow and still,

399
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:13,694
and I felt like I was finally not alone.

400
00:28:17,493 --> 00:28:21,147
Mine felt like I was talking with the gods or something.
You know, they were--

401
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:22,736
Shut the fuck up.

402
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:24,114
Excuse me?

403
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:26,659
Sophia, if you've never had an orgasm,

404
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:29,987
then how does it feel like for you to have sex?

405
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:31,988
Great.

406
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:36,466
Yeah. Sex is really awesome.

407
00:28:36,467 --> 00:28:37,467
I love sex.

408
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:42,739
Sex feels terrific.
- That's great.

409
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,477
I love it. A lot.

410
00:28:45,512 --> 00:28:48,131
It's a great workout. It feels good.

411
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:50,015
And I love loving my husband.

412
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:54,227
It's just, there comes a point sometimes
where it gets a lot of pressure

413
00:28:54,857 --> 00:28:57,075
and kinda like,

414
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:58,076
it feels a little bit, kinda like, um,

415
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,387
like somebody's gonna kill me,

416
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:05,361
and I just have to smile and pretend to enjoy it.

417
00:29:06,674 --> 00:29:08,812
And that way I can survive.

418
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:15,990
Fuck, Severin.

419
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:18,719
Excuse me, that was totally inappropriate.

420
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:21,912
Don't mind her.
- Freak.

421
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:49,755
But you know what's the most wonderful thing
about New York?

422
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:50,755
What?

423
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,542
It's where everyone comes to get fucked.

424
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,671
It's one of the last places where people
are still willing to bend over

425
00:29:57,706 --> 00:29:59,896
to let in the new.

426
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:04,667
And the old.

427
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:20,022
New Yorkers are... permeable.

428
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:20,941
You know what I mean?

429
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:22,251
Yeah.

430
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,649
You sure are?

431
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:27,626
Therefore we're sane.

432
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:36,638
Consequently, we're the target of the impermeable.
And the insane.

433
00:30:39,395 --> 00:30:46,348
And of course, New York is where
everyone comes to be forgiven.

434
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,076
What have you done wrong?

435
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:03,764
Tell me, how have you sinned?

436
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,046
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

437
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:10,047
How would you know?

438
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:15,636
Well, I'm-- I'm sure you did your best.

439
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:22,327
Imagine if you grew up here like I did.

440
00:31:25,192 --> 00:31:31,572
Home can be very unforgiving.

441
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:36,337
It's true.

442
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:41,552
People said I didn't do enough

443
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:45,019
to help prevent the AIDS crisis

444
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,039
because I was in the closet.

445
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:53,467
That's not true.

446
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:56,945
I did the best I could.

447
00:31:58,672 --> 00:31:59,672
I was--

448
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:03,307
I was scared

449
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,701
and--

450
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:10,038
impermeable.

451
00:32:13,046 --> 00:32:16,011
Everybody knew so little then.

452
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:26,182
I know even less now.

453
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:12,461
Chip?

454
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:22,399
No, I'm OK.

455
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:29,575
Who's that?

456
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,722
If he's wearing a blue shirt, it's me.

457
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:35,047
It's you.

458
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:37,348
I made that for him.

459
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:38,792
Oh yeah?

460
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:40,867
That's Jamie there on the back.

461
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:42,468
Oh my God.

462
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:44,487
Shut up, that's so cute!

463
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:47,962
How old are you guys?

464
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:48,963
Seven.

465
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:49,964
Six.

466
00:34:51,863 --> 00:34:53,325
Somewhere around there.

467
00:34:58,808 --> 00:35:01,124
I think I'm actually gonna go.

468
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:03,242
What? No!

469
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:04,243
Yeah.

470
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:05,244
No, it's OK. It's cool.

471
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:06,246
Are you sure?

472
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:07,247
No.

473
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,248
Yeah.

474
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,629
Hang out for a while.

475
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,630
OK.

476
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,411
Come on.

477
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:44,068
How do I be a model?

478
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:47,546
A lot of it's instinct, to be honest.

479
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:49,435
But there are some basics.

480
00:35:49,436 --> 00:35:51,889
The way I like to think about it,
it's like geometry.

481
00:35:51,924 --> 00:35:53,936
Like lines and angles.

482
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:14,176
I like that.

483
00:36:17,057 --> 00:36:18,641
That's perfect. That's like an ad right there.

484
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,711
See, you got it.

485
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:25,467
Whatever, I hate it. It totally sucks.

486
00:36:42,048 --> 00:36:43,048
James?

487
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:44,049
Yeah?

488
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:46,511
Can you actually use your other hand?

489
00:36:46,547 --> 00:36:49,536
'Cause I usually command it from a different angle.

490
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:50,737
Sure.

491
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:54,431
How's that?

492
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:55,378
That's fine.

493
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:05,473
That feels really good.

494
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:07,342
What?

495
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:07,950
Huh?

496
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,231
Just say something.
- What are you talking...

497
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:13,194
Make more sounds.

498
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:14,894
"I'm an albino!"

499
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:17,097
"I'm an albino!"

500
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:19,647
"I'm an albino!"

501
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:25,748
"O say, can you see"

502
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:31,801
"by the dawn’s early li-i-i-i-i-ight"

503
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:42,866
"O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave"

504
00:37:42,866 --> 00:37:52,515
"O’er the land of the free-e-e-e-eee"

505
00:37:52,516 --> 00:38:01,770
"and the home of the b-rave?"

506
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:07,119
Is that the first time somebody sang
the National Anthem in your ass?

507
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
No.

508
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:41,681
OK, rotate.

509
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:48,276
Carpet burn.

510
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,601
Jamie, can I watch you fuck him?

511
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:56,908
I want you.

512
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:02,049
You. You. You.

513
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:48,112
That's it.

514
00:41:48,113 --> 00:41:50,164
Fuck...

515
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:14,170
Fuck!

516
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,695
Rob!

517
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:24,659
What?

518
00:42:24,695 --> 00:42:25,628
It's too loud!

519
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:27,082
No, it's not.

520
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:27,593
It is!

521
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:28,234
It's not!

522
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:28,998
It is!

523
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:29,379
It's not too loud!

524
00:42:29,401 --> 00:42:30,356
I can't concentrate!

525
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:31,259
I'm looking for a job, OK?

526
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,260
What kind of a job, a hand job?

527
00:42:33,714 --> 00:42:35,646
For Christ's sake, turn the fucking music off!

528
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:37,043
And look at this place.

529
00:42:37,044 --> 00:42:39,974
I just got the fucking cleaners in here yesterday!

530
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,466
These are my dried cranberries--

531
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,096
And you bought everything in this house!

532
00:42:46,324 --> 00:42:47,586
Fuck - you!

533
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:54,139
We agreed to come from a place of love.

534
00:43:01,536 --> 00:43:04,630
I feel your warm and loving hands.

535
00:43:06,704 --> 00:43:08,939
And I feel worried that you think I'm ugly.

536
00:43:10,657 --> 00:43:13,043
Because why else would you be doing that
on the computer.

537
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:15,919
I'm squeezing your perfectly round shoulders,

538
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,938
following to your clavicle and your collarbone,

539
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:21,318
so you know that you're incredibly attractive.

540
00:43:21,354 --> 00:43:22,196
I think you're incredibly sexy.

541
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:25,401
And I'm just distracting myself.

542
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:29,260
I feel the sleeves of your T-shirt.

543
00:43:29,295 --> 00:43:31,328
They're dry against my clammy hands.

544
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:32,472
Your skin is perfect

545
00:43:32,506 --> 00:43:34,276
like I could never get this on a computer.

546
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:35,905
'Cause I'm just-- blocked.

547
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:38,069
Totally. We're both blocked, and--

548
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,524
Oh god, that feels good.

549
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:40,771
Really?

550
00:43:40,805 --> 00:43:43,069
Shit, I'm so crunchy up there.

551
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:46,712
How about you unblock these beautiful breasts?

552
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:48,113
Your pertinent nipples.

553
00:43:48,114 --> 00:43:49,114
"Pertinent"?

554
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:50,546
Very relevant.

555
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:51,941
Aw! Jeez!

556
00:43:51,975 --> 00:43:53,747
I am not a cow!

557
00:43:53,915 --> 00:43:55,856
I know you're not a cow, baby--

558
00:43:55,857 --> 00:43:56,857
It felt that way.

559
00:43:56,858 --> 00:43:58,582
It felt like I was a cow.

560
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,670
You wanna know why?
- That's what you felt.
- Yes. I own that.

561
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,239
Can we try it again?

562
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,944
I'm feeling your strong biceps.

563
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:11,132
They're so tender and smooth.

564
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:13,550
Oh god, when you flex them,

565
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:15,054
they're just like breasts.

566
00:44:16,129 --> 00:44:19,621
I feel the delicate wisps
of your receding hairline...

567
00:44:19,684 --> 00:44:20,863
I'm not balding.

568
00:44:20,864 --> 00:44:23,187
Yes you are, honey. You are.

569
00:44:23,222 --> 00:44:27,000
And I love your balding, virile head.

570
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,443
I feel really small.

571
00:44:29,444 --> 00:44:30,934
That's because we are small.

572
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,792
We're so very small.

573
00:44:32,793 --> 00:44:33,793
No!

574
00:44:35,076 --> 00:44:37,948
I'm saying that I feel small.

575
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:40,920
I feel like I can't take up enough space.

576
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,500
I feel like my cock isn't big enough for you.

577
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:46,850
This is your issue, and you have to own it.

578
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,242
Because I am not a size queen,
and I don't care about...

579
00:44:48,274 --> 00:44:51,104
I can't bring home any money.
I feel like I'm not contributing.

580
00:44:51,796 --> 00:44:54,160
I love the fact that you deliver Meals on Wheels.

581
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,554
You volunteer. It's beautiful. Why would you...

582
00:44:56,555 --> 00:44:59,694
Bullshit. I can't even give you an orgasm.

583
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,394
Yes, you... many times you have.

584
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
Bullshit!

585
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:06,271
I think we can get over this.

586
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:09,683
We can work this through.
We've been through a lot of stuff together.

587
00:45:09,684 --> 00:45:11,320
I can't give you an orgasm!

588
00:45:24,102 --> 00:45:25,102
Hello?

589
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:28,470
Hi. Is this Severin?

590
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:29,471
Yeah.

591
00:45:29,472 --> 00:45:32,869
Hey. It's Sophia.

592
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:47,486
So, do you like to jerk off?

593
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:49,282
Of course I do.

594
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:54,859
What are you doing with the cigarette in here?

595
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:56,822
Please, put that out!

596
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:58,380
This is a non-smoking environment.

597
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:01,289
That's totally absurd.
We're completely surrounded by water.

598
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,302
It's like a dream smoking environment.

599
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:04,303
You're gonna kill us in here.

600
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:06,870
That feels good.

601
00:46:06,905 --> 00:46:08,422
Thank you.

602
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:10,839
What about your husband,
has he ever tried to get you off?

603
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,840
This is not about Rob?

604
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:15,138
70% of all women have trouble achieving an orgasm.

605
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:16,731
70% of all men are assholes.

606
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:17,731
He's not an asshole, he's a great guy.

607
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:20,548
If it wasn't for Rob, I'd still be a bank teller.

608
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:21,549
He totally changed my life around.

609
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,550
He's my best friend.

610
00:46:23,672 --> 00:46:26,885
Why is it so important for you
to have an orgasm anyway?

611
00:46:26,886 --> 00:46:29,955
I mean, it feels good,
but it's not gonna save your life.

612
00:46:29,956 --> 00:46:32,067
I wanna be welcomed into
the secret society of women.

613
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:34,692
I was never a brownie.
I haven't had an orgasm.

614
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:36,840
God, I want to be able to save my marriage.

615
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,562
What does it have to do with your marriage?

616
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:40,667
It has a lot to do with--
- I think it has nothing to do with the other person.

617
00:46:40,702 --> 00:46:42,550
Like, I can only come if it's my own hand.

618
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:47,452
It has everything to do, because
you need two people to make love.

619
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:48,947
No you don't.

620
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,734
Have you even had a relationship?

621
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:59,943
So were you like, abused as a child?

622
00:47:01,324 --> 00:47:02,324
No.

623
00:47:02,325 --> 00:47:03,325
Were you?

624
00:47:03,326 --> 00:47:04,326
No!

625
00:47:05,295 --> 00:47:08,015
I come from a very traditional
Chinese Canadian family.

626
00:47:08,016 --> 00:47:10,426
I love Chinese Canadian food, but
what does that have to do with it?

627
00:47:10,824 --> 00:47:12,507
Chinese families are very strict.

628
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,258
My mom was a disciplinarian,

629
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:20,258
and my father... was...

630
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:22,369
my father was a great guy.

631
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:24,504
Did he touch you?
- No.

632
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:27,469
No, he didn't touch me.

633
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,265
He didn't touch anyone, ever.

634
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:31,706
Oh I see. Like, "My father wasn't there,

635
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:33,359
I can't feel anything between the legs. "

636
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:35,424
You are so far behind you think you're first.

637
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:39,363
God, he was alway there for me.

638
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,960
It's just-- he was always there for me,
that was the problem.

639
00:47:41,961 --> 00:47:42,961
He was always watching me.
He was always watching me.

640
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:47,023
Watching you how?

641
00:47:48,188 --> 00:47:50,456
You want me to say he raped me without touching me?

642
00:47:50,457 --> 00:47:51,457
Well, did he?

643
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:54,803
Did he?

644
00:47:54,804 --> 00:47:56,817
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

645
00:47:56,818 --> 00:47:57,818
I'm sorry.

646
00:47:58,048 --> 00:48:02,440
Domination, black and white-- it's not as simple.
Relationships are more complex than that?

647
00:48:02,442 --> 00:48:05,539
Are you saying that I can't understand your
relationship with your father who "watched you",

648
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:09,220
because I'm a dominatrix?

649
00:48:09,222 --> 00:48:10,222
Well, yes!

650
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,614
That's really funny,
because you're a sex therapist

651
00:48:12,614 --> 00:48:14,801
and you can't have an orgasm.

652
00:48:14,836 --> 00:48:16,435
You should be in...
Where are you going?

653
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:19,349
I am not one of your clients who
pays to be dominated!

654
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,727
Sophia, this is like the best conversation
I've had over years.

655
00:48:21,728 --> 00:48:22,728
Let go of my arm!

656
00:48:23,398 --> 00:48:24,760
I won't grab you.

657
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:27,239
Please, I'm--
I'm sorry, OK? I just--

658
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:31,869
Sometimes when I get uncomfortable,
I get mean.

659
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,835
You are not gonna keep me keen
by treating me mean.

660
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,629
Look, I know I can help you have an orgasm.

661
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:41,779
And maybe you can help me having
a real human interaction with someone?

662
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,347
Maybe we could meet here every week for an hour.

663
00:48:44,348 --> 00:48:45,998
I'm in a crisis.

664
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:48,599
All right, every night this week,
starting tomorrow.

665
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:55,532
You're sitting all by yourself.

666
00:48:56,612 --> 00:48:59,092
And you look up, and there he is.

667
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:01,446
With his lunch tray.

668
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:02,694
What's his name again?

669
00:49:02,695 --> 00:49:04,415
Phil.

670
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:05,417
Phil Mudd.

671
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:08,755
Severin's not my real name.

672
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:13,126
What is your real name?

673
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:19,798
So Phil Mudd says, "Is anyone sitting here?"

674
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:23,715
And you say, "No one's ever sat here. "

675
00:49:24,498 --> 00:49:26,133
OK, I'm going down.

676
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:35,133
<i>Feel the thought first.
Then get on the bus. </i>

677
00:49:35,738 --> 00:49:38,371
Just whisper it to me.
Whisper it in my ear.

678
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,375
I can't do it.

679
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:44,376
Oh, Phil!

680
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:48,175
I want you to see his lunch tray.

681
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:52,261
It's got a carton of homogenized milk.

682
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:55,531
Pour that all over you.

683
00:49:56,512 --> 00:50:00,122
Look at his Converse.
He markered them all up.

684
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:04,365
OK, if you can't say it,
then just simply write it down.

685
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:08,890
<i>Feel the thought first.
Then get on the bus. </i>

686
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,137
All right. You gotta pull the bus over.
You're not riding safely. Park.

687
00:50:26,825 --> 00:50:28,245
Jennifer.

688
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:31,781
That's a lovely name.

689
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:35,018
Oh Jennifer.

690
00:50:38,094 --> 00:50:40,622
What's your last name?

691
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:47,907
Aniston?

692
00:50:54,643 --> 00:50:56,310
Jennifer Aniston.

693
00:50:58,211 --> 00:51:00,255
There's room for two in this world.

694
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:04,609
Good going! It's OK! It's all right!

695
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:08,480
Good work today, Jennifer.

696
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:35,973
It's a remote-controlled vibrating egg.

697
00:52:37,031 --> 00:52:38,958
Where'd you get this?

698
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:40,363
That's not important.

699
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:45,908
OK, so here's the plan:

700
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:49,326
We'll mingle separately to see what
we can experience safely,

701
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:52,712
and once in a while,
I want you to check in with me

702
00:52:52,713 --> 00:52:53,713
with this.

703
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:55,937
Jesus Christ, Sophia!

704
00:52:55,971 --> 00:53:00,603
I want you to have control.
So if you're feeling threatened or horny

705
00:53:00,638 --> 00:53:03,130
or if you just wanna check in and say "Hey",
buzz me, OK?

706
00:53:06,114 --> 00:53:07,967
Come on, it'll be fun!

707
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:08,968
It'll be hot.

708
00:53:12,074 --> 00:53:13,074
Come back, bitch!

709
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:17,182
That's "Bumble bee kisses".

710
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,183
Oh, that's nice.

711
00:53:50,679 --> 00:53:54,087
It's just like the 60s, only with less hope.

712
00:53:55,225 --> 00:53:56,631
See anything you like?

713
00:53:56,632 --> 00:53:59,544
Oh Jesus. It's a lot of stuff that I'm seeing.
It's incredible.

714
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:03,519
For a minute I thought that man didn't have an arm.

715
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:07,887
So, how's the big O coming?

716
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,895
Oh, everybody's talking about it.

717
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:13,739
Everybody here knows.
"That's the girl that can't have orgasms. "

718
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,649
You're sitting up here in your corner
with your flower choking your throat.

719
00:54:17,683 --> 00:54:21,464
I mean, sweetheart, you gotta
loosen up a little bit.

720
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,333
I mean, you have nice boobs.

721
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:26,259
You've got what it takes, sweetheart,
what's the holdup?

722
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:30,195
I think I have some sort of clog in
my neural pathways

723
00:54:30,231 --> 00:54:32,861
somewhere between my brain and my clitoris.

724
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:35,028
That's disgusting.

725
00:54:35,029 --> 00:54:36,029
No, I'm serious.

726
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,363
Don't think of it as a clog.

727
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:44,555
Think of it as some sort of magical circuit board.
A motherboard, filled with desire, that travels
all over the world.

728
00:54:44,556 --> 00:54:47,413
That touches you, that touches me,
that connects everybody.

729
00:54:47,448 --> 00:54:51,023
You just have to find the right connection,
the right circuitry.

730
00:54:51,024 --> 00:54:52,735
Look at all these people out there.

731
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,431
They're trying to find the right connection.

732
00:54:54,432 --> 00:54:56,952
And I personally expect a few blown fuses

733
00:54:56,988 --> 00:54:58,442
before the night is over.

734
00:54:58,443 --> 00:55:00,741
And maybe one of them will be yours.

735
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,380
Are you suggesting that Rob and I aren't
compatible sexually?

736
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:07,909
Who the hell is Rob?

737
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:08,910
My husband.

738
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:09,911
Well, where is he right now?

739
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:10,912
I don't know.

740
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,495
Well, then it's time to play.

741
00:55:13,529 --> 00:55:18,039
You've got the whole world. It's your playground.
What do you think it will take?

742
00:55:18,074 --> 00:55:22,766
Maybe somebody who's just starting to explore
their sexuality, somebody...

743
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,877
Like a child?

744
00:55:25,082 --> 00:55:26,723
No.

745
00:55:26,759 --> 00:55:27,759
Not a child.

746
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,163
I'm not recommending it. I'm just asking.

747
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:32,361
I'm just trying to help you, dear.

748
00:55:33,593 --> 00:55:34,593
You're touching my thigh.

749
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:35,594
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
00:55:35,595 --> 00:55:36,594
It's OK.

751
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:38,238
I don't mind.

752
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:46,909
Hey-- OK. What if I asked you, um--
if I can kiss you?

753
00:55:48,498 --> 00:55:50,142
Well, I don't know, I mean...

754
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:52,525
I get really scared sometimes, but...

755
00:55:54,428 --> 00:55:57,979
all right, if you want to, but...
just real gently.

756
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,483
OK.

757
00:56:24,262 --> 00:56:26,406
Wow. That was fast.

758
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:28,289
No, it's my husband.
- Oh.

759
00:56:28,325 --> 00:56:31,672
He's trying to communicate with me.
- Oh.

760
00:56:39,754 --> 00:56:42,836
Oh my godness, how sad! Do you want a hug?
- I just want--
- Can I use your leash for a second?

761
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:48,403
Jesus, do you have a cellphone in your twat?

762
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,805
No, it's-- um, he's got the remote control.

763
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,697
It's... this... vibrating, uh...

764
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:00,019
OK, lady. Well, you know, best of luck,
thanks for everything,

765
00:57:00,055 --> 00:57:03,944
as my dear departed friend
Lotus Weinstock used to say:

766
00:57:03,946 --> 00:57:06,134
"I used to want to change the world.

767
00:57:06,135 --> 00:57:09,906
"Now I just want to leave
the room with a little dignity. "

768
00:57:09,907 --> 00:57:12,976
Excuse me while I crawl out of here.
- Um...

769
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:26,068
That's fun.

770
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:30,090
Are you guys hard?

771
00:57:31,793 --> 00:57:34,105
I get something to drink.
I'll be right back.

772
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:40,867
Wow. So weird.

773
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,913
He's awesome.

774
00:57:46,816 --> 00:57:48,081
Do you think that...

775
00:57:48,116 --> 00:57:49,264
What?

776
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:57,363
I don't know, I mean,
I've heard of three-way relationships,

777
00:57:57,398 --> 00:57:59,105
but they're mostly in Berkeley.

778
00:58:00,265 --> 00:58:01,265
What do you think?

779
00:58:01,266 --> 00:58:02,266
I don't know.

780
00:58:02,267 --> 00:58:03,267
He's great.

781
00:58:03,268 --> 00:58:05,478
And I think we'll learn to do a lot, you know.

782
00:58:07,379 --> 00:58:09,119
That's good. It's a good thing.

783
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,060
What?

784
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:15,060
It's a good thing?

785
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:16,061
Yeah!

786
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:19,669
What's a good thing?

787
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,262
I just think...

788
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,751
Do you hear yourself?

789
00:58:23,787 --> 00:58:25,643
Do you even know what you're saying any more?

790
00:58:25,644 --> 00:58:26,643
'Cause I don't.

791
00:58:28,162 --> 00:58:31,130
I'm sick of having to drag
every little thing out of you.

792
00:58:33,412 --> 00:58:35,342
I mean--

793
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:38,128
I know you get depressed, but come on!

794
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:40,316
I'm trying!

795
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:47,960
Do you love me?

796
00:58:51,303 --> 00:58:53,136
You don't love me any more?

797
00:59:11,376 --> 00:59:12,376
Severin! Wait up!

798
00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:13,377
Wait!

799
00:59:22,356 --> 00:59:24,119
Ohhhhh!

800
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,974
How's it going?

801
00:59:25,985 --> 00:59:27,410
Pretty great.

802
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,033
You had an orgasm?

803
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,325
No, but-- I made out with somebody.

804
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:34,324
Who?

805
00:59:34,359 --> 00:59:35,359
Justin Bond.

806
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:38,631
He's an homosexual!

807
00:59:38,632 --> 00:59:40,134
Apparently not.

808
00:59:40,154 --> 00:59:41,560
Oh my god.

809
00:59:41,753 --> 00:59:42,753
Well, he's really cute.

810
00:59:42,754 --> 00:59:44,245
Yeah, he is.

811
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:47,079
I saw Rob, by the way.

812
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:50,673
Yeah. What was he up to?

813
00:59:51,543 --> 00:59:53,495
He was getting fucked up the ass.

814
00:59:55,912 --> 00:59:56,912
It was really intense.

815
00:59:57,143 --> 00:59:58,143
Oh god.

816
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:02,025
I'm just kidding.

817
01:00:03,648 --> 01:00:06,129
You brat!
- No, seriously, though-- he was.

818
01:00:08,755 --> 01:00:10,372
I should probably go find him.

819
01:00:12,714 --> 01:00:13,713
What's with him?

820
01:00:14,631 --> 01:00:17,259
That fucking trust fund muppet Jesse is

821
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,535
like the longest relationship I've ever had.

822
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,381
You deserve so much more, Jennifer.

823
01:00:24,382 --> 01:00:27,383
Thank you, but I can't respond to that name yet.

824
01:00:27,384 --> 01:00:28,384
I'm sorry.

825
01:00:34,037 --> 01:00:36,181
I can't do it any more.

826
01:00:38,743 --> 01:00:40,020
I can't...

827
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:41,351
I just like...

828
01:00:41,385 --> 01:00:47,020
wanna have like a house, a cat, a pet,
you know what I'm saying?

829
01:00:49,337 --> 01:00:50,336
I'm sorry.

830
01:00:50,337 --> 01:00:52,021
No, you shouldn't apologize.

831
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:53,995
I'm glad that you're telling me these things.

832
01:00:53,996 --> 01:00:54,996
I want to hear you say these things.

833
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,137
I'm gonna save up all my money,

834
01:00:58,138 --> 01:01:02,200
and then I'm just gonna make art for a year.
Nothing else.

835
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:04,249
I know you can do it.

836
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,448
But everything's so fucking expensive!

837
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:09,915
I don't even know if I can afford
to live in New York any more.

838
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:12,105
Where would I go, Fresno?

839
01:01:19,651 --> 01:01:20,651
It's OK.

840
01:01:23,708 --> 01:01:25,528
Your skin is so soft.

841
01:02:00,188 --> 01:02:01,188
Jesus.

842
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:02,597
Rob.

843
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:03,598
Hi, Rob.

844
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:10,214
Oh my god.

845
01:02:14,803 --> 01:02:15,803
Oh, man.

846
01:02:20,329 --> 01:02:21,329
Oh god.

847
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:35,097
Don't move.

848
01:02:55,842 --> 01:02:56,842
I'm so sorry.

849
01:03:00,567 --> 01:03:01,567
It's OK.

850
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:02,568
I'm sorry.

851
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:03,568
Don't apologize.
- Fuck.

852
01:03:13,191 --> 01:03:15,731
I just-- I'm like, so sensitive.

853
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,858
I should find Rob.

854
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:24,437
You can tell me all about it tomorrow.

855
01:03:27,794 --> 01:03:28,794
Actually, um--

856
01:03:31,084 --> 01:03:34,579
I can't make it tomorrow,
but I will give you a call.

857
01:03:37,152 --> 01:03:40,921
I'll give you a call. Later this week.

858
01:04:00,517 --> 01:04:01,460
Christ.

859
01:04:01,496 --> 01:04:02,496
Truth or dare?

860
01:04:02,745 --> 01:04:03,745
Truth.

861
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:08,365
Out of everyone here, who would
you want to make out with the most?

862
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,427
No one.

863
01:04:10,428 --> 01:04:11,428
What?
- Bus cow.

864
01:04:13,479 --> 01:04:14,479
OK, spin.

865
01:04:20,437 --> 01:04:21,436
Dare.

866
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:23,957
You and Severin have to go
in that closet.

867
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:27,735
You do whatever the fuck you want to her,
for five minutes. While we take a pee break.

868
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,080
Oh my god.

869
01:04:50,237 --> 01:04:52,891
I'm not gonna make out with you, OK?

870
01:04:53,967 --> 01:04:54,967
I'm James.

871
01:04:55,497 --> 01:04:56,497
Severin.

872
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,631
What is that?

873
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,299
It's my film.

874
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:07,878
What is it about?

875
01:05:11,233 --> 01:05:12,973
I have a hard time saying.

876
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:15,960
Are you showing it here tonight?

877
01:05:18,408 --> 01:05:19,408
I don't know.

878
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:22,409
What are you guys doing in there?

879
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:25,019
I hate him.

880
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,396
He can be a lot worse.

881
01:05:30,132 --> 01:05:31,131
At least he's cute.

882
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:33,509
That's pretty unusual.

883
01:05:35,211 --> 01:05:36,473
What's pretty unusual?

884
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,860
I never had a john that cute.

885
01:05:47,005 --> 01:05:48,949
You know how we got started?

886
01:05:48,985 --> 01:05:49,985
How?

887
01:05:49,986 --> 01:05:54,447
After watching "My own private Idaho".

888
01:05:54,482 --> 01:05:56,418
I grew up in a small town, so
I didn't know where to go.

889
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:01,302
So I waited outside the theater
where it was playing.

890
01:06:01,303 --> 01:06:04,014
I waited for somebody to come out.

891
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,542
And that's where I met my first john.

892
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,170
So was it choice?

893
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:11,066
Yeah.

894
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:14,938
I loved it actually.

895
01:06:16,577 --> 01:06:19,065
I knew exactly what I was worth.

896
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,620
You know?

897
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,205
Exactly what I had to contribute.

898
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,841
What was like, the most you ever made in a day?

899
01:06:30,672 --> 01:06:33,126
Well, with cab fare--

900
01:06:33,127 --> 01:06:34,127
$389.

901
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:40,594
That's pretty good for a small town.

902
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,525
You're with that guy who looks
just like you, right?

903
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:47,526
Yeah.

904
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:51,219
He's cute. He looks like a jelly bean.

905
01:06:52,934 --> 01:06:53,934
Yeah.

906
01:06:55,940 --> 01:06:57,692
He's great, actually.

907
01:07:02,348 --> 01:07:04,385
I never let him fuck me.

908
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:09,195
I never let anybody fuck me.

909
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:19,097
What are you guys doing in there?

910
01:07:26,123 --> 01:07:26,327
You're an artist.

911
01:07:27,212 --> 01:07:28,403
No. I suck.

912
01:07:29,108 --> 01:07:30,465
Hey, me too.

913
01:07:32,502 --> 01:07:34,681
Do you take that camera everywhere you go?

914
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:35,682
Yeah, something like that.

915
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:48,247
Are you OK?

916
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:56,790
Why are you crying?

917
01:08:05,133 --> 01:08:09,111
I look back to things that were
when I was 12 years old.

918
01:08:11,262 --> 01:08:14,064
I'm still looking for the same things now.

919
01:08:24,735 --> 01:08:26,668
Time's up.

920
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:34,474
Hey, what are you doing?

921
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:35,475
I'm looking for my husband.

922
01:08:35,476 --> 01:08:37,232
I just found mine.

923
01:08:37,266 --> 01:08:41,728
Both of them. I'm totally in love with them.
But together. Not so much separately.

924
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:43,813
I hope they know it's gonna have to be
a monogamous relationship.
- Excuse me.

925
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,138
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

926
01:08:47,139 --> 01:08:48,054
Who are you?

927
01:08:48,055 --> 01:08:49,099
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

928
01:08:49,102 --> 01:08:50,623
I'm Ceth. Is there a problem?

929
01:08:50,624 --> 01:08:51,624
You're not funny.

930
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:52,625
I thought it was kinda funny.

931
01:08:52,626 --> 01:08:55,616
No you're not. And you're a horrible therapist.

932
01:08:55,617 --> 01:08:58,289
Listen to me: James and Jamie are perfect.

933
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,290
Just leave them alone.

934
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:00,291
I think you need to leave.

935
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:02,522
No. I think you're fucking with something
very pivotal to them and to me.

936
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:03,522
Just walk away!

937
01:09:03,523 --> 01:09:04,523
Fuck you!

938
01:09:04,524 --> 01:09:05,524
You motherfucker!

939
01:09:05,525 --> 01:09:06,525
OK, OK.

940
01:09:08,922 --> 01:09:09,921
Timeout, timeout.

941
01:09:11,739 --> 01:09:12,739
Sorry, I--

942
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:16,511
Are you OK?

943
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:18,884
I've got an egg vibrating between my legs!

944
01:09:38,705 --> 01:09:39,705
What the fuck is going on in here?

945
01:09:41,113 --> 01:09:43,815
Hey. Are you OK?

946
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,598
You gave it away?

947
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,599
I just misplaced it.

948
01:09:48,595 --> 01:09:49,286
I know you're hurt.

949
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:51,799
I am not hurt. I am furious!

950
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:54,881
I totally honor your feelings, but
I want you to own them.

951
01:09:54,882 --> 01:09:56,709
Shut up with your "honoring your feelings".
And do not tell me what to own.

952
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:59,535
Because I know what I own,

953
01:09:59,536 --> 01:10:02,061
you balding impotent liar!

954
01:10:02,062 --> 01:10:03,988
Right, sister!

955
01:10:06,644 --> 01:10:08,741
All right, show's over.
We're gonna be processing to the next room now.

956
01:10:10,386 --> 01:10:11,386
Hey.

957
01:10:33,834 --> 01:10:36,690
Fuck! Fuck!

958
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,412
Yes. I--I need an ambulance.

959
01:13:08,447 --> 01:13:10,865
I'm at the Palestra Gym. It's on 99...

960
01:14:37,108 --> 01:14:38,108
Hello?

961
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,003
Who is this?

962
01:14:43,106 --> 01:14:45,895
Oh. Hey. How are you?

963
01:14:47,278 --> 01:14:49,156
Do I know you?

964
01:14:51,159 --> 01:14:52,158
No.

965
01:14:55,106 --> 01:14:57,010
Did you follow me?

966
01:14:58,677 --> 01:15:01,016
Why would you wanna do that to yourself?

967
01:15:05,426 --> 01:15:08,523
James-- Yes, I followed you to the gym.

968
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:16,420
Why?

969
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,844
Let's not talk about this on the phone.

970
01:15:18,845 --> 01:15:20,886
What does your afternoon look like?

971
01:15:23,583 --> 01:15:28,808
I'm looking for a friend. His last name is Baysin.

972
01:15:30,176 --> 01:15:31,176
B-A-Y-

973
01:15:33,356 --> 01:15:35,428
What do you mean, he checked himself out?

974
01:15:36,772 --> 01:15:38,208
So what do you want?

975
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:41,085
I want to be restrained, but
I don't want to totally lose control.

976
01:15:41,086 --> 01:15:42,168
Good.

977
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,631
'Cause I can't be bothered to tie you up.

978
01:15:44,632 --> 01:15:48,115
Turn over and hold the headbar.
If you let go, I'll leave.

979
01:15:53,037 --> 01:15:54,855
You never asked your wife to do this?

980
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,430
I guess she wouldn't understand.

981
01:15:58,007 --> 01:15:59,007
All right.

982
01:16:00,321 --> 01:16:02,155
This one's for her.

983
01:16:07,592 --> 01:16:10,562
And I told Brad, "I think you're confusing me
with someone who hurt you. "

984
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:16,853
And he said, "No, Cheryl, you're hurting me. "

985
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,367
Right?

986
01:16:21,739 --> 01:16:24,074
And that was an eye opener for me.

987
01:16:27,301 --> 01:16:30,479
And whenever I brought up
my gastrointestinal problem...

988
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:48,330
When did you start watching me?

989
01:16:51,034 --> 01:16:52,795
Um, a couple of years ago.

990
01:16:54,862 --> 01:16:56,823
I work right out of here.

991
01:16:56,824 --> 01:16:58,609
I proofread for a living.

992
01:17:00,436 --> 01:17:01,920
I don't have cable.

993
01:17:01,921 --> 01:17:04,673
I remember watching Jamie cut your hair.

994
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:10,166
It just seemed like fun.

995
01:17:11,513 --> 01:17:13,454
And you were always my favorite,

996
01:17:13,455 --> 01:17:15,400
because you were sad.

997
01:17:17,984 --> 01:17:19,573
Do you have a boyfriend?

998
01:17:20,567 --> 01:17:24,108
Look, James, please, you have to call Jamie, OK?

999
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:25,109
Just call him.

1000
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,110
You can use my phone.

1001
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:42,260
Why won't he come home?

1002
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:45,395
Wouldn't you wanna go home?

1003
01:18:26,471 --> 01:18:28,659
What are you doing?

1004
01:18:30,942 --> 01:18:32,617
I don't understand?

1005
01:18:34,963 --> 01:18:37,151
What are you doing here?

1006
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:41,426
Explain it to me, please.

1007
01:18:42,944 --> 01:18:46,081
First you bring Ceth into the relationship--

1008
01:18:46,082 --> 01:18:47,082
What's wrong with you?

1009
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,820
I didn't want Jamie to be alone.

1010
01:18:51,915 --> 01:18:54,058
How long have you been planning this?

1011
01:18:56,272 --> 01:19:00,461
What, so you've been making
a suicide tape for the last six months?

1012
01:19:01,376 --> 01:19:03,794
I just wanted him to know it wasn't his fault.

1013
01:19:06,682 --> 01:19:08,204
Jamie loves you.

1014
01:19:10,432 --> 01:19:11,887
You have so much.

1015
01:19:14,985 --> 01:19:15,985
I know.

1016
01:19:18,559 --> 01:19:20,660
I see it all around me.

1017
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,701
But it stops at my skin.

1018
01:19:28,054 --> 01:19:30,081
I can't let it inside.

1019
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:34,237
It's always been like that.

1020
01:19:35,555 --> 01:19:37,915
It's always gonna be like that.

1021
01:19:40,376 --> 01:19:43,360
I can feel it in little moments with Jamie,

1022
01:19:43,395 --> 01:19:45,434
because he loves me so hard.

1023
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:51,692
He loves me as hard as the people
who treated me like shit.

1024
01:19:57,236 --> 01:19:58,235
I can't feel it.

1025
01:20:00,764 --> 01:20:01,764
Don't.

1026
01:20:04,045 --> 01:20:05,045
Don't. Don't. No.

1027
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:07,739
No. No.

1028
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:13,449
Go! Go!

1029
01:20:15,318 --> 01:20:17,387
Don't you see that I don't wanna be this!

1030
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:20,154
... if that makes people uncomfortable,
then it makes us uncomfortable.

1031
01:20:22,498 --> 01:20:24,698
But at least it's truthful.

1032
01:20:25,127 --> 01:20:26,790
I don't want to lie any more.

1033
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:29,641
Because that isn't who I am, and it isn't
who I'm trying to, who we're trying to be.

1034
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,596
I have to get some sort of information,

1035
01:21:59,597 --> 01:22:03,699
because the patient that was there
checked himself out.

1036
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:04,888
Ceth!

1037
01:23:18,996 --> 01:23:20,729
Are you sure?

1038
01:24:14,814 --> 01:24:18,231
Be glad you followed me out into the fucking cold
and bucked a date

1039
01:24:18,266 --> 01:24:20,324
so you could feel something?

1040
01:24:21,418 --> 01:24:24,088
It's hard not to feel anything in your life.

1041
01:24:24,122 --> 01:24:26,063
Do you feel it now, you little faggot?

1042
01:25:02,601 --> 01:25:04,475
Don't you fucking look at me.

1043
01:25:05,121 --> 01:25:06,995
Don't fucking look at me!

1044
01:25:14,252 --> 01:25:15,252
It's OK.

1045
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:02,781
"... is doing everything possible
to get some power back,

1046
01:27:02,782 --> 01:27:06,409
"and he's advising calm, which seems unnecessary,

01:27:06,445 --> 01:27:10,037

I'll be back in five minutes.

1050
01:27:16,679 --> 01:27:20,213
"... no reason to believe that this is
the result of terrorist acts... "
