00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:39,287
Good morning, sir
Good morning, madam.

3
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:41,287
Before we enter the apartment,

4
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:44,287
I’ll give you some info about this building:

5
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,287
It has six units.

6
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:49,287
It's very quiet and in perfect shape.

7
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:53,280
It also has an underground parking garage,

8
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:58,280
which is accessible from the elevator behind us.

9
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:01,287
Another big plus is

10
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:02,287
it has two entrances.

11
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:04,287
Good Morning, Night

12
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:07,287
The second is through the kitchen.

13
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:11,287
So when you exit the garage with
packages for example…

14
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:14,287
you can walk to the kitchen directly…

15
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:16,287
without passing through the apartment.

16
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:19,287
Directed by Marco Bellocchio

17
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,287
It's very peaceful
and private…

18
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:24,287
like the entire neighborhood.

19
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:27,287
Let’s go in now…

20
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,278
and start the tour.

21
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:32,278
Here we are.

22
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:36,287
I'll open the windows.

23
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:40,280
We can see it better that way.

24
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:47,287
Here's the foyer, roomy yet functional.

25
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,287
The door is armored...

26
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:52,287
you can feel safe here.

27
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:56,280
The finishings are very high quality.
The floors are in marble and parquet.

28
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:59,287
Here’s the living room

29
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,278
I'll open it.

30
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:07,287
There.

31
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:11,280
As you can see,
the apartment's very bright.

32
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:14,287
This way is...

33
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:17,287
the garden, exclusively for this apartment.

34
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:21,287
Hello, Micione!
We even have a lovely cat.

35
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:23,287
OK.

36
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:27,287
It isn't maintained very well
because nobody’s been living in this unit,

37
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:31,280
but with some water
and some newly planted flowers…

38
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,287
it’ll look completely different.

39
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,287
This is an important part of the apartment.

40
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:38,287
Since it's at ground level...

41
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:40,287
people outside will pass by
your windows.

42
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:44,280
This is like a natural cover...

43
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:47,287
it will block out inquisitive eyes.

44
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:50,287
OK, let's continue our tour

45
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:53,287
together with the lovely little cat.

46
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,287
Here…

47
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:59,280
we have the two rooms…
I'll open it...

48
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:04,280
to give you a sense
of how bright the place gets…

49
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,287
and the condition of the rooms.

50
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:10,287
The other room is in back.
This could be used as an office.

51
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:14,287
Hopefully later…

52
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:15,287
it will be your children’s' room.

53
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:19,280
Unfortunately, you'll have to forgive me...

54
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:25,287
but I have many appointments to
show this apartment today.

55
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:28,287
Don't hesitate to call me...

56
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,287
I’m at your service anytime.

57
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:33,287
- Goodbye sir.
- Goodbye madam.

58
00:03:33,287 --> 00:03:35,278
See you later.

59
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,287
<i>We're almost there.
It's almost midnight.</i>

60
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,278
- <i> We're almost there.</i>
- <i>Maestro Borghesi.</i>

61
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,280
<i>Over to you Maestro!<i>

62
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:26,287
<i>...Minus stealing, minus
scandal, minus robbery, minus doubt!...<i>

63
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:30,280
<i>Viva 1978!</i>

64
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:45,280
<i>Happy new year, everyone!</i>

65
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:52,287
Come on! Happy New Year!

66
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,279
<i>I hope 1978 will be a lucky
year for everyone.</i>

67
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:58,287
Sorry, my bedsheet
dropped into your garden.

68
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:00,287
I live upstairs. I'm Sandra

69
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,287
It's nice to meet you. I'm Chiara.

70
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:07,280
- Come in.
- Thanks.

71
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,287
Ernesto, my husband.

72
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:15,280
- Sandra.
- Nice to meet you.

73
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:24,278
Thanks

74
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:30,280
- Excuse me.
- Not at all.

75
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,287
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Bye

76
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:38,280
<i>What you just heard is
"The March of the Don Cossacks."</i>

77
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:45,278
That was our neighbor.

78
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,287
Do you think she did it on purpose?

79
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:55,280
I haven't gone out. It’d be
impossible for her to see me.

80
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,278
<i>End of transmission.</i>

81
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:33,287
<i>Our program, "Arguments"…</i>

82
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:37,280
will broadcast the opera, "L'Opera dei Pupi."

83

<i>Television News
Special Edition.</i>

84
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:34,287
<i>Good evening.  The chairman of
the Christian Democratic Party,</i>

85
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:38,287
<i>Aldo Moro, has been the victim of
a most serious crime.</i>

86
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,287
<i>According to our initial reports,</i>

87
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:42,287
<i>Aldo Moro appears to have been kidnapped.</i>

88
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:46,287
<i>This information has been confirmed
by the Minister of the Interior.</i>

89
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:50,287
<i>It was a bloody affair.</i>

90
00:09:50,287 --> 00:09:53,287
<i>5 people were killed.  They were all</i>

91
00:09:53,287 --> 00:09:56,287
<i>members of the Christian Democratic Party
president's escort.</i>

92
00:09:56,287 --> 00:10:00,280
<i>Three police officers and two bodyguards.</i>

93
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:05,280
<i>It appears there were numerous gunshots</i>

94
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:10,287
<i>from machine guns and revolvers.</i>

95
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:14,287
<i>The body of police chief, Leonardi,</i>

96
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:18,280
<i>has been identified.</i>

97
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:22,287
I have to pick up my son. Can
you look after him for me?

98
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,287
I'm very sorry, I can't.

99
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:29,287
Just for a moment?

100
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:31,278
Wait!

101
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:14,287
<i>Let's remember that Aldo Moro, one of our most
illustrious contemporary statesmen,</i>

102
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:18,280
<i>was the mastermind of the new majority...</i>

103
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:23,287
<i>who brought about a new era
in Italian politics.</i>

104
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:27,287
<i>In his speech on February 28th, in
fine political form,</i>

105
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,278
<i>he persuaded the Christian
Democratic Party</i>

106
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:35,287
<i>to work towards a parliamentary alliance</i>

107
00:11:35,287 --> 00:11:37,287
<i>which included the Communists.</i>

108
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:41,287
<i>It's no accident that he was
kidnapped today.</i>

109
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:45,287
<i>A terrifying political motive seems to
have inspired this action</i>

110
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,287
<i>which resulted in the deaths of
his entire security force at the site.</i>

111
00:11:49,287 --> 00:11:52,287
<i>Now let's take a look of the scene
of the assassination this morning.</i>

112
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:56,287
<i>Above all, a map of the area
where the event took place.</i>

113
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,287
<i>No, I heard we were trying to
form a liaison with Parliament.</i>

114
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,287
<i>Quickly, the reactions.</i>

115
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,287
<i>Yes,  the reactions this morning</i>

116
00:12:05,287 --> 00:12:09,280
<i>were very strong once the news
got out.</i>

117
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:21,287
<i>Senator La Malfa urged</i>

118
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:25,287
<i>his colleagues:</i>

119
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,287
<i>implement a state of emergency and
the death penalty.</i>

120
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,287
<i>This is a very strong reaction.</i>

121
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:33,287
<i>The Christian Democratic Party
is meeting</i>

122
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,287
<i>with Zaccagnini.</i>

<i>Everyone has tears in their eyes,</i>

00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:43,280
<i>obviously moved and in shock.</i>

125
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:26,278
Let's fix it.

126
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:31,280
- Can I help you?
- No, no problem.

127
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:37,280
Slowly, slowly!

128
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,278
Put it down.

129
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:58,280
Where's the head?

130
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,278
He's awake

131
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:44,287
<i>...message from his family in solidarity</i>

00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:52,280
<i>This is first-hand news...</i>

134
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:56,278
Thanks.

135
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,278
See you later.

136
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:06,287
- Who was that?
- No one, a kid.

137
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,287
- A kid?
- A newborn.

138
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:11,278
OK.

139
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:33,287
Do you understand who we are?

140
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:36,287
Yes, I understand.

141
00:15:36,287 --> 00:15:39,287
<i>You have just seen the
five covered bodies.</i>

142
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,287
<i>The white Alfa that escorted</i>

143
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:43,278
<i>the politician's car.</i>

144
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:48,280
<i>They didn't have time to get out of the car.</i>

145
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:55,287
<i>Only one man tried
to grab his weapon.</i>

146
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:59,280
<i>He was coldly murdered.</i>

147
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:03,287
<i>At 10:15, an anonymous
person made a phone call to Milan,</i>

148
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,287
<i>according to the newspaper "La Notte":</i>

149
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:08,287
<i>"This is the Red Brigades:</i>

00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:11,287
<i>we've struck at the heart of the State."</i>

00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:13,287
<i>"The hostage is in our hands."</i>

152
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:17,287
<i>You can see the car of

153
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:21,280
<i>in front is the white Fiat 128...</i>

154
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:28,287
He must have broken his ribs.
He's having trouble breathing.

155
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,278
Go to the pharmacy,

156
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:36,280
get this medication.

157
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:40,287
Without a prescription?

158
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,278
Make something up.

159
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,287
Also get an elastic bandage,

160
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:49,280
to keep it set.

161
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:59,287
A film script?

162
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:01,278
Weird.

163
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:06,287
And our savings?

164
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:08,287
I'm going to withdraw it all.

165
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:11,287
I keep it all at home,
and spend what I need;

166
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,287
and the rest goes to Switzerland.

167
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,287
It's safer over there, for the time being.

168
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:18,287
No one knows what the future holds.

169
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,287
At least it's in a safe place.

170
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:24,287
But that's illegal...

171
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:26,278
Stop!

172
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:29,287
Thanks, comrade!

173
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:31,278
Look at me!

174
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:36,287
Workers on strike!

175
00:17:36,287 --> 00:17:37,287
We're going to the labor union.

176
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:41,280
I'll come with you, I can't work like this.

177
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:46,287
How can you go on strike after
Moro's kidnapping?  Such a good man...

178
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:50,280
an important figure...

179
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,278
Mariano.

180
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,287
All that should be burned.

181
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:40,280
- This too?
- Everything.

182
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,287
<i>People are talking about civil war.</i>

183
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:49,280
<i>We've already been fighting one!</i>

184
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,278
<i>But this time,</i>

185
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:56,287
<i>it's not a matter of</i>

186
00:18:56,287 --> 00:19:00,280
<i>a battle between one small group
of people and another.</i>

187
00:19:03,287 --> 00:19:05,278
<i>Not at all!</i>

188
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:10,280
<i>We have a group of professional terrorists</i>

189
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:15,287
<i>who are attacking our institutions,</i>

190
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,287
<i>and our liberty!</i>

191
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:21,280
<i>We're dealing with a small
group of assassins!</i>

192
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,287
Why's no one responding?

193
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:29,287
They can't agree with everything he's said.

194
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:33,280
Why don't they rebel?

195
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:39,287
They're all applauding.

196
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,287
Why?  They should be hissing!

197
00:19:42,287 --> 00:19:44,287
Calm down.

198
00:19:44,287 --> 00:19:48,280
<i>...that we conquered thanks to
our combat.</i>

199
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:53,287
<i>We have to open our eyes.</i>

200
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:55,278
<i>We must make an appeal,</i>

201
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:01,287
<i>in accordance with our president's message:</i>

202
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,287
<i>to our political forces,</i>

203
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,287
<i>our schools, our men of culture,</i>

204
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:10,287
<i>our society, and our families.</i>

205
00:20:10,287 --> 00:20:13,287
<i>They're living well somewhere...</i>

206
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:17,280
<i>these young people...these men...
or women, unfortunately,</i>

207
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:22,280
<i>who allow themselves to take
part in such criminal acts.</i>

208
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:26,287
<i>There must be some families
which can say that...</i>

209
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:28,278
He knocked.

210
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:32,287
Moro knocked.

211
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:36,280
<i>...the chaos in
which we're involved.</i>

212
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:40,287
<i>I think</i>

213
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:44,280
<i>under these circumstances, we should</i>

214
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:49,287
<i>appeal to the spirit of non-violence.</i>

215
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,287
<i>This is a serious matter.</i>

216
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:55,280
<i>A necessary procedure of detoxification.</i>

217
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,287
Didn't he eat anything?

218
00:20:58,287 --> 00:21:00,278
He only wants to drink.

219
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,278
He's breathing poorly.

220
00:21:04,287 --> 00:21:08,280
He asked me to leave
the door ajar.

221
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:12,287
I'll take guard duty.
You can take the next shift.

222
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:14,278
Go to bed.

223
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:19,280
Turn off the TV, please.

224
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,278
Chiara!

225
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:51,287
How are you?
You're very tan!

226
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:55,280
Did it snow a lot?

227
00:24:59,287 --> 00:25:01,287
They're all going nuts!

228
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:05,287
Shall we go elsewhere?

229
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,287
The boss was terrified.

230
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:09,287
He left with his mistress.

231
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:10,287
What a moron!

232
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:13,287
Mass arrests are in order!

233
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:16,287
Close the universities!
And the labor camps!

234
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:19,287
Bravo, hard labor camps for you!

235
00:25:19,287 --> 00:25:20,287
What is this bullshit?

236
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:23,287
You, conscientious objector,
you're a coward!

237
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:26,287
If you're not a soldier,
you're a coward?

238
00:25:26,287 --> 00:25:29,287
The terrorists are risking their lives!

239
00:25:29,287 --> 00:25:31,278
Don't listen to him.

240
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:47,287
Hello?

241
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:49,278
Hi.

242
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:54,287
-<i>Am I disturbing you?</i>
- No, I'm glad you called.

243
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,287
- <i>I never hear from you.</i>
- You know I live with my boyfriend.

244
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:57,287
He doesn't have a phone.

245
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,278
- I'm always there.
- <i>How were the mountains?</i>

246
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:05,280
Yes, it was nice...the weather was great.
It snowed.

247
00:26:06,287 --> 00:26:09,287
- <i>You'll come Sunday?</i>
- I don't know if I'll come or not.
- <i>It's your father's anniversary.</i>

248
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:13,280
- What about my father?
- <i>We're going to the cemetery.</i>

249
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,287
-<i> I'll make lasagne for you.
You can eat all you want.</i>

250
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:20,287
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- <i>I'll make lasagne</i>

251
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,287
Lasagne...that'll be perfect.

252
00:26:23,287 --> 00:26:27,280
- We'll talk later, OK?  I have work to do.
- <i>Bye.</i>

253
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:42,280
Excuse me,
no smoking in here.

254
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,287
Didn't you see that?

255
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:57,287
It's not my graffiti.

256
00:27:57,287 --> 00:27:59,287
Let me by, I want to see it.

257
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,278
Call the police.

258
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:06,280
This elevator has to be blocked off.

259
00:28:13,287 --> 00:28:15,278
Newspapers?

260
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:33,278
Hi Chiara.

261
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:38,287
So what's up?

262
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:42,280
Nothing new.

263
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:11,287
Where're you going?

264
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:13,278
To look for bread.

265
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:28,280
What did people at work say?

266
00:29:29,287 --> 00:29:31,287
Everyone's talking about us.

267
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:33,287
Yeah, but what are they saying?

268
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:37,287
They say we're assassins.

269
00:29:37,287 --> 00:29:41,280
Ask at the factories who the real
assassins are.

270
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:54,287
Someone drew a graffiti of our star.

271
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:56,287
Where was that?

272
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:58,287
In the elevator.

273
00:29:58,287 --> 00:30:00,278
Then it's done.

274
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:06,280
If the workers are rebelling,

275
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,278
it's done.

276
00:31:45,287 --> 00:31:47,278
Sorry.

277
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:18,278
Primo!

278
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:44,278
The newspapers.

279
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:03,278
A burglar.

280
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,278
Who was that?

281
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:14,287
Just a burglar.

282
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:16,278
A burglar?

283
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:22,278
Incredible.

284
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:13,278
Come in.

285
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,287
You've got the wrong person.

286
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:21,287
I don't have any political power,

287
00:34:21,287 --> 00:34:23,287
nor do I have a governmental position.

288
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:25,287
You represent the
Christian Democratic Party.

289
00:34:25,287 --> 00:34:29,287
We don't want to judge you as
a citizen or a father,

290
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:33,287
but as all that you represent...
the symbol, the function,

291
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:35,287
the party you represent.

292
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:39,287
Like me... I represent
the working class.

293
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:43,280
My party is truly populist,

294
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:48,287
it's a very large group
composed mostly of everyday folk:

295
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,287
blue collar workers, peasants,
employees.

296
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:54,287
You speak of "people," yet
we speak of "classes"...

297
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,287
of class struggle,
of class hatred.

298
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:00,287
I don't have any hatred for you.

299
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:03,287
And I don't believe that class struggle

300
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:07,287
is the engine of history.

301
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:10,287
People are frightened,
they want to live in peace.

302
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:14,287
My party is simply a party of peace,

303
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:16,287
of charity,

304
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:18,287
of modest welfare...

305
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:22,280
This is reactionary thought.

306
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:55,287
<i>...has a white shirt, no suit and tie.</i>

307
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,287
<i>We can't see his hands or feet.</i>

308
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:00,287
<i>No trace of any scars on his face.</i>

309
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:02,278
There's a cat outside.

310
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,278
On top of the birdcage.

311
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:12,280
- Where?
- Bring it back inside.

312
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:18,287
<i>What's the format of the photograph?</i>

313
00:36:18,287 --> 00:36:21,287
<i>Four by six, I said</i>

314
00:36:21,287 --> 00:36:25,287
<i>What was President Moro's expression?</i>

315
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:29,287
<i>Rather calm. We can't see
any harm to his face.</i>

316
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,287
<i>We received some pictures
and a message.</i>

317
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:36,280
<i>We'll run a special edition.</i>

318
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:42,280
- Mr. President, some soup?
- Yes.

319
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:50,278
Close it again.

320
00:36:56,287 --> 00:37:00,280
<i>We ask for wisdom from
the authorities,</i>

321
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:05,287
<i>an acute sense of responsibility,</i>

322
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:09,287
<i>clarity, firmness, and determination</i>

323
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:13,287
<i>in the implementation of the
necessary means to restore order.</i>

324
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:17,287
<i>and to defend justice and freedom.</i>

325
00:37:17,287 --> 00:37:20,287
<i>This is a heavy burden on them,</i>

326
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:22,287
<i>and that's what we're waiting
for them to do...</i>

327
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:24,278
<i>above all else.</i>

328
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:30,287
<i>I give to God, with his
infinite mercy,</i>

329
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:32,287
<i>the hearts of these victims,</i>

330
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:35,287
<i>the bodyguards and policemen,</i>

331
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,287
<i>who are very dear to their families...</i>

332
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:41,280
<i>and today, also to the Italian people.</i>

333
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:47,287
<i>I call for everyone's support</i>

334
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:49,287
<i>and prayer from the believers,</i>

335
00:37:49,287 --> 00:37:53,280
<i>in the name of those whose supreme
sacrifices have immortalized them.</i>

336
00:37:56,287 --> 00:37:58,287
<i>I ask from God</i>

337
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:00,287
<i>that their bloodshed</i>

338
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,278
<i>will help unify us
in this time of</i>

339
00:38:03,287 --> 00:38:07,280
<i>fragile civil peace.</i>

340
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:12,287
<i>And that the families, struck so cruelly,</i>

341
00:38:12,287 --> 00:38:16,287
<i>can find, with God's help,
some consolation.</i>

342
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:20,280
<i>Nothing can ease the pain wrought
by these infamous assassins.</i>

343
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:28,287
You don't have to understand,
just confess.

344
00:38:28,287 --> 00:38:30,278
You want me to confess?

345
00:38:32,287 --> 00:38:36,280
In the sacrament of confession,
penitence is obligatory.

346
00:38:37,287 --> 00:38:39,287
But what do I have to repent for?

347
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:43,280
For my entire life? I won't be believed.

348
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:48,287
I should admit things that you know of
but I'm unaware of.

349
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:52,280
Should I then obtain your
benevolence through lies?

350
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:56,287
You speak to me of Proletarian law,
of Proletarian justice...

351
00:38:56,287 --> 00:39:00,280
but tell me how it works,
how does it function,

352
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:03,287
what laws govern this kind of justice?

353
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:06,287
Proletarian justice is
not that of the bourgeoisie.

354
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:10,280
I want to remind you that our justice
is punishable by death,

355
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:15,280
without the possibility of an appeal
or overrule.

356
00:39:19,287 --> 00:39:21,278
Death.

357
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:26,280
"Give me liberty or give me death,"
as someone once said.

358
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:31,280
You certainly can't sentence me
to life in prison.

359
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:43,287
I want to write to my wife.

360
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:45,278
And also

361
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:49,287
to my friends from the party.

362
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,278
Of course.

363
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:08,278
He wants to write a letter.

364
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:22,287
Did he understand?

365
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:24,278
I don't know.

366
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:44,287
What should we do with the minutes?

367
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:48,287
- Huh?
- The minutes, the letters.

368
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:50,287
- What do we do with them?
- Destroy them.

369
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:52,287
That's your job.

370
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:56,280
Just keep the originals.

371
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:02,280
Chiara, are you tired?

372
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:24,280
<i>We have this message from
the Red Brigades.</i>

373
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:28,287
<i>Also this photo.</i>

374
00:41:28,287 --> 00:41:31,287
<i>We've studied with great emotion</i>

375
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:35,287
<i>a photograph of Aldo Moro,</i>

376
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:39,280
<i>looking melancholy and resigned.</i>

377
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:45,280
<i>We are encouraged
to see that he's alive</i>

378
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:48,287
<i>and in good health, I imagine.</i>

379
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:51,287
<i>In another message from the Red Brigades,</i>

380
00:41:51,287 --> 00:41:55,280
<i>they address the issue
of a trial for Aldo Moro.</i>

381
00:41:57,287 --> 00:41:59,287
<i>That seems to be the ridiculous intention</i>

382
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:03,280
<i>of these assassins, of these criminals
who are responsible for his kidnapping.</i>

383
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:13,287
The working class must rule over all.

384
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:17,280
The working class must rule over all.

385
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:09,287
Annalisa?

386
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,278
No, she's on sick leave.

387
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,287
What are you looking at me for?

388
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:29,280
You could really be more beautiful.
You have the look of a nun.

389
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:34,280
What gives you the right?

390
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,287
- Hello?
- <i>I'm Enzo Passoscuro's mother.</i>

391
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,287
It's your mother.

392
00:43:44,287 --> 00:43:47,287
- He doesn't want to speak to you.
- <i>Then I'll come down there.</i>

393
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:51,287
Since you don't want to speak to her,
she's coming over here.

394
00:43:51,287 --> 00:43:53,278
- That's all.
- Then come down.

395
00:43:54,287 --> 00:43:56,278
Goodbye.

396
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:06,280
- How's your mother?
- Dead.  My father too.

397
00:44:10,287 --> 00:44:12,287
I'm so sorry.

398
00:44:12,287 --> 00:44:13,287
Why?

399
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:17,280
- You must be pissed off.
- No.

400
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:22,287
You're happy?

401
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:24,287
Yes

402
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:26,287
Are you content with being
just a petty civil servant?

403
00:44:26,287 --> 00:44:28,278
I don't believe you.

404
00:44:29,287 --> 00:44:31,287
Don't believe me.

405
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:35,280
You're 20 years old now,
look at what you've done.

406
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,287
Don't you have a passion?

407
00:44:38,287 --> 00:44:40,278
A dream?

408
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:42,287
For me, it's writing.

409
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:46,287
I don't know if I'm talented or not,
but I love it.

410
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:49,287
I write novels,  poems.

411
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,287
I even wrote a screenplay.

412
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:55,287
It's called "Good Morning, Night."

413
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:59,287
It's a verse from Emily Dickinson.
Would you read it?

414
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:01,287
I don't have the time.

415
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:05,280
Are you kidding?
No one actually works here!

416
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:20,278
Thanks.

417
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:28,287
Are you engaged or married?

418
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:32,280
Don't you ever work?

419
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:37,287
This is my mother's ring.

420
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:39,287
- Hello?
- <i>Chiara, it's Zia.</i>
- Zia!

421
00:45:39,287 --> 00:45:41,287
<i>Do you remember what's on Sunday?</i>

422
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:45,287
- Yes, lunch, of course.
- <i>Bring your boyfriend.</i>

423
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:46,287
- I don't know.
- <i>But he's your boyfriend.</i>

424
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:50,280
- He's my boyfriend, but he
may not want to come, OK?
- <i>Convince him.</>

425
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:56,280
- I'll try to convince him.
- I can go.

426
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:03,287
- <i>We made reservations at a
great restaurant by the Tevere River.</i>
- Oh yeah?

427
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:06,287
- <i>Are you listening?</i>
- I'll try to convince him, OK?

428
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:10,287
- <i>Can't wait to see you.</i>
- Bye.

429
00:46:10,287 --> 00:46:12,278
- Are you joking?
- No.

430
00:46:15,287 --> 00:46:17,287
<i>...met in various groups
on the Transatlantic</i>

431
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:20,287
<i>to read and examine it.</i>

432
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:24,280
<i>According to a popular
quote from Andreotti,</i>

433
00:46:25,287 --> 00:46:27,287
<i>as written by Mastrostefano,</i>

434
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:30,287
<i>who is a member of the D.C.</i>

435
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,280
<i>Experts believe the letter is
in Aldo Moro's writing,</i>

436
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,287
<i>but it doesn't sound like him.</i>

437
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:40,287
<i>Andreotti's comment</i>

438
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:44,287
<i>sums up the political reaction</i>

439
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:46,287
<i>to Moro's writing.</i>

440
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:50,287
<i>I quote: "No matter what he
writes, they're not his words."</i>

441
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:52,278
- Hi.
- Hi.

442
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:54,287
Did Mariano leave already?

443
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:58,280
No, he's with the president.

444
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:07,287
Are you afraid of death?

445
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:10,287
Why do you ask?

446
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,287
You do, however, believe in the afterlife.

447
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:16,280
In the Garden of Gethsemane, Christ
was afraid of death too.

448
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:20,287
As a child, I was really inspired by religion

449
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:24,280
so I wanted to die in order to
get to heaven as quickly as possible.

450
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:31,287
- How absurd!
- You weren't afraid of death?

451
00:47:31,287 --> 00:47:34,287
Everybody dies.

452
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:38,280
But not all deaths have the same significance.

453
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:41,287
I think our advantage is this:

454
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:45,287
we're prepared to die for our ideals.

455
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:49,287
Communists are just like that.

456
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:53,287
Like the early Christian martyrs.

457
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:57,287
Basically, you have a religion...you too.

458
00:47:57,287 --> 00:48:00,287
Much heavier than mine.

459
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:04,280
It scorns the body
much more than us Catholics.

460
00:48:06,287 --> 00:48:09,287
Christianity was like that once.

461
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,287
But that's in the past.

462
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:15,287
The last crusade was in the year 1270.

463
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:19,280
The last witch was burned in Switzerland
at the end of the 18th Century.

464
00:48:21,287 --> 00:48:24,287
Anyway, I'm going to read what you wrote.

465
00:48:24,287 --> 00:48:27,287
I'll discuss the plan with my comrades.

466
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:31,287
Did you send my letters?

467
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:33,278
Yeah.

468
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,287
No response?

469
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:40,280
Your friends don't recognize you anymore.

470
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:44,287
They don't recognize me anymore.

471
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,287
Me neither, I don't recognize them.

472
00:48:47,287 --> 00:48:51,280
They think I've turned into someone else.

473
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:56,287
That's the case, in fact.

474
00:48:56,287 --> 00:49:00,280
But not in the way they think.

475
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,278
I'm always myself.

476
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:09,287
I'm going to lay down a bit.

477
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:11,278
Wake me up around midnight.

478
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:23,278
What's the matter with you?

479
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,287
- Can you tell that I'm upset?
- Yes.

480
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:29,287
I miss Giulia.

481
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:31,278
Of course you do.

482
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:36,287
I can't even drop her a line.

483
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:38,287
You know...

484
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:42,287
I know, but I have faith in her.

485
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:45,287
- We're soldiers.
- How you talk!

486
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:47,287
I didn't even do my military service.

487
00:50:47,287 --> 00:50:51,280
Comrade Ernesto, a little
revolutionary enthusiasm!

488
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:08,287
You were gone for 5 minutes.

489
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:11,287
You sound like my mother
at the gas station!

490
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:13,287
I want to be sure he's still there,

491
00:51:13,287 --> 00:51:14,287
that this isn't a dream.

492
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:18,287
- Seeing him there makes me feel reassured.
- Would you rather this be a dream?

493
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:20,278
I don't know.

494
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:26,280
I solved the problem:
I don't dream anymore.

495
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:06,287
Oh God, grant the
serenity of saints

496
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:09,287
on our departed brothers.

497
00:52:09,287 --> 00:52:12,287
In all your graciousness,

498
00:52:12,287 --> 00:52:16,287
give them eternal peace

499
00:52:16,287 --> 00:52:18,287
and let shine on them undying light.

500
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:22,280
May they rest in peace.
Amen.

501
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,287
Daniel,  we salute you

502
00:52:29,287 --> 00:52:33,280
in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.  Amen.

503
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:36,278
Until next year.

504
00:52:56,287 --> 00:52:59,287
I'd like to say two things.

505
00:52:59,287 --> 00:53:03,280
Forgotten time doesn't forget
the partisan.

506
00:53:04,287 --> 00:53:08,287
We came from up north
to pay our respects to our friend,

507
00:53:08,287 --> 00:53:11,287
the father of Antonio and Chiara

508
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:13,287
who, each year...

509
00:53:13,287 --> 00:53:15,287
Each year, he rambles.

510
00:53:15,287 --> 00:53:17,287
Listen to him, you might learn something.

511
00:53:17,287 --> 00:53:21,280
He believes in the great potential of mankind.

512
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:26,280
He says if people realized

513
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:31,287
even 1/5 of their potential,

514
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:34,287
all the world's problems would be solved.

515
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:37,287
We control love, peace,

516
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:41,280
justice, fraternity, and the joy of life.

517
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:45,287
Newlyweds!

518
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:49,287
Cheers to the new couple!

519
00:53:49,287 --> 00:53:51,287
- There's truth in that.
- Oh yeah?

520
00:53:51,287 --> 00:53:55,287
People do a lot less than they could.

521
00:53:55,287 --> 00:53:57,287
It's a real waste of vital energy!

522
00:53:57,287 --> 00:54:00,287
If people gave it their all,

523
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:04,287
the world would be different.

524
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:07,287
There are people who always do the
same thing,

525
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:11,280
and then suddenly, they want to
change the world with a revolver,

526
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:16,287
without noticing that their daily
lives amount to nothing.

527
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:19,287
I read that between two of the assassinations,
a member of the Red Brigades

528
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:22,287
masturbated while watching porno films.

529
00:54:22,287 --> 00:54:24,287
What's the matter with the Red Brigades?

530
00:54:24,287 --> 00:54:26,287
How's that?

531
00:54:26,387 --> 00:54:31,287
They give their lives for the exploited.
They deserve some respect.

532
00:54:31,287 --> 00:54:33,287
Are you listening to your brother?

533
00:54:33,287 --> 00:54:34,287
They're better than me; I just roll
my joint, quietly.

534
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,287
Fuck you!

535
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:42,287
Charlie, you remember it, sing it,

536
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:44,287
and we'll respond.

537
00:54:44,287 --> 00:54:47,287
Sing of happy memories!

538
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,278
Come on Charlie!

539
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:54,280
<i>Wind blow,  tempest roar,</i>

540
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:57,278
<i>tattered shoes,</i>

541
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:00,287
<i>but we must move on</i>

542
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:04,280
<i>to conquer the red spring</i>

543
00:55:05,287 --> 00:55:09,280
<i>where the sun of the future rises.</i>

544
00:55:20,287 --> 00:55:24,280
<i>If cruel death surprises us</i>

545
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:30,280
<i>strong will be the revenge of the partisan</i>

546
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,287
<i>it's all worked out</i>

547
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:36,287
<i>the fatal destiny</i>

548
00:55:36,287 --> 00:55:40,280
<i>of the cowardly and traitorous fascist.</i>

549
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:55,280
<i>The wind stops, the storm subsides</i>

550
00:55:56,287 --> 00:56:00,287
<i>the proud partisan goes home.</i>

551
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:04,280
<i>His red flag flies very high.</i>

552
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:10,280
<i>We'll be free and victorious in the end.</i>

553
00:57:05,287 --> 00:57:07,278
What is it?

554
00:57:08,287 --> 00:57:12,280
<i>...nothing will be solved
by breaking the law.</i>

555
00:57:13,287 --> 00:57:14,287
<i>The new law that's been introduced</i>

556
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:18,280
<i>revises the text of the
existing health reform law.</i>

557
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:23,287
<i>A mentally ill person becomes
a normal patient like any other.<i>

558
00:57:23,287 --> 00:57:27,280
<i>Without being segregated, they'll be placed
into various hospitals around  the province.</i>

559
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:35,278
Please stand up.

560
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,287
The trial ends here.

561
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:42,287
The Proletariat knows what the
Christian Democratic Party regime stands for

562
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:45,287
because they are the primary victims of it.

563
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:47,287
The trial of Aldo Moro is just one stage

564
00:57:47,287 --> 00:57:48,287
in the trial of the State

565
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:52,287
and in Communism's class war.

566
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:56,287
Aldo Moro bears the same responsibility
as others in the State,

567
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:58,287
his guilt is the same.

568
00:57:58,287 --> 00:58:00,287
The Christian Democratic Party
will be swept away

569
00:58:00,287 --> 00:58:02,287
by the Communist fighting forces.

570
00:58:02,287 --> 00:58:06,280
Aldo Moro is guilty and
thusly condemned to death.

571
00:58:25,287 --> 00:58:27,278
That's all.

572
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,287
Should I bring him a tranquilizer?

573
00:59:04,287 --> 00:59:08,280
If he wants one.

574
00:59:15,287 --> 00:59:19,280
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

575
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:39,280
He said he wanted to be alone
so he could write.

576
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:52,280
He's trying to get them to negotiate.

577
01:00:00,287 --> 01:00:04,280
Did you sleep?

578
01:00:11,287 --> 01:00:14,287
The president wrote to his wife.

579
01:00:14,287 --> 01:00:17,287
You should leave it tomorrow,
after work,

580
01:00:17,287 --> 01:00:21,280
at the same place,
in the usual church.

581
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:27,280
- Can I read it?
- Yes.

582
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:48,287
<i>My dear Noretta,</i>

583
01:00:48,287 --> 01:00:52,280
<i>we have arrived, I believe,
at the conclusion.</i>

584
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:56,287
<i>Stay united in remembrance of me.</i>

585
01:00:56,287 --> 01:00:59,287
<i>I'll do the same.</i>

586
01:00:59,287 --> 01:01:02,287
<i>I beg you, live your life as before.</i>

587
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:05,287
<i>Kiss and hug everyone for me</i>

588
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:09,287
<i>each face, each eye.</i>

589
01:01:09,287 --> 01:01:13,280
<i>Express my undying love for them.</i>

590
01:01:14,287 --> 01:01:18,287
<i>Be strong, my sweet,</i>

591
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:21,287
<i>through this absurd and
incomprehensible ordeal.</i>

592
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:24,287
<i>This is the will of God.</i>

593
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:28,287
<i>I'd like to understand with my
little eyes</i>

594
01:01:28,287 --> 01:01:31,287
<i>how we can see each other again.</i>

595
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:35,280
<i>If there were light,
it would be so beautiful.</i>

596
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:38,287
<i>My love,</i>

597
01:01:38,287 --> 01:01:42,287
<i>always know that I'm with you,
and hug me tightly.</i>

598
01:01:42,287 --> 01:01:45,287
<i>Hugs and kisses to Fida,
Demi, Luca...</i>

599
01:01:45,287 --> 01:01:47,287
<i>My love,</i>

600
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:51,287
<i>tomorrow morning, a firing squad
of the fascist republican guard</i>

601
01:01:51,287 --> 01:01:53,278
<i>will put an end to my days.</i>

602
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,287
<i>My love,</i>

603
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:14,287
<i>tomorrow morning, a firing squad
of the fascist republican guard</i>

604
01:03:14,287 --> 01:03:16,287
<i>will put an end to my days.</i>

605
01:03:16,287 --> 01:03:19,287
<i>I want to tell you before I die,</i>

606
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:23,287
<i>that you are my first, my one, and
my only love,</i>

607
01:03:23,287 --> 01:03:27,287
<i>and that if I survive,
I want to make you my wife</i>

608
01:03:27,287 --> 01:03:29,287
<i>and I'll make you very happy.</i>

609
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:32,287
<i>In these moments, the most
tragic of my life,</i>

610
01:03:32,287 --> 01:03:36,287
<i>my life flashes before my eyes,
like in a movie.</i>

611
01:03:36,287 --> 01:03:38,287
- I need to see her!
- Don't move.

612
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:42,280
He's not intending to run away,
you don't need me.

613
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:45,287
We have to fight the revolution

614
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:48,287
with people like you, who only thinks of
screwing his fiancée?

615
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:50,287
Our lovers must become "B.R." like us.

616
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:54,280
I'm a wolf...I don't want any
woman but the one I love!

617
01:03:55,287 --> 01:03:57,287
I'm leaving.  Kill me if you want.

618
01:03:57,287 --> 01:03:59,287
- You're no longer one of the B.R..
- I don't give a damn!

619
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:00,287
She'll understand.

620
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:03,278
Shut up!
Let me go!

621
01:04:08,287 --> 01:04:10,287
What should we do?

622
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:12,287
In any case, he'll come back.

623
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,287
My father used to hunt me
down with a bat.

624
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:16,278
You were lucky.

625
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:40,287
Who are you writing to?

626
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:43,287
To Luca, my grandson.

627
01:04:43,287 --> 01:04:45,287
He's two years old.

628
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:49,280
He'll read it one day.

629
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,287
Do you have any children?

630
01:04:52,287 --> 01:04:56,287
Yes, a son, but I haven't
seen him for a long time.

631
01:04:56,287 --> 01:04:58,287
That really hurts me.

632
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:01,287
It's like he never existed.

633
01:05:01,287 --> 01:05:04,287
We must find a way
to negotiate with them.

634
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:09,287
Consult a higher authority,

635
01:05:09,287 --> 01:05:11,287
one above parties.

636
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:13,278
God.

637
01:06:16,287 --> 01:06:19,287
- You're back?
- Yes.

638
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:23,287
The great escape, is it over already?

639
01:06:23,287 --> 01:06:27,280
We're soldiers,
that's what you said.

640
01:07:18,287 --> 01:07:20,287
What's up?

641
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,287
I'm thinking about the letter
that Moro wrote to his wife.

642
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,287
I read it in the newspaper this morning.

643
01:07:27,287 --> 01:07:30,287
It reminded me of a book that
my father used to read to me:

644
01:07:30,287 --> 01:07:32,287
"Last Letters of Communist Partisans
Condemned to Death."

645
01:07:32,287 --> 01:07:34,278
Moro is still alive.

646
01:07:36,287 --> 01:07:38,287
What are you trying to say?

647
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:42,280
Those people in the book are all dead.

648
01:07:43,287 --> 01:07:47,287
- Moro is still alive.
- Do you think they'll kill him?

649
01:07:47,287 --> 01:07:51,287
They won't get anywhere if
they don't kill people.

650
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:55,287
They're crazy and stupid.

651
01:07:55,287 --> 01:07:58,287
- And it scares me.
- I don't understand.

652
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:02,287
You're making me nervous!

653
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,278
Hold on...

654
01:08:06,287 --> 01:08:08,287
You speak of the Red Brigades as if they
were crazy,

655
01:08:08,287 --> 01:08:12,287
masturbating men
who are the lowest of the low!

656
01:08:12,287 --> 01:08:14,287
Can't you see the other side?

657
01:08:14,287 --> 01:08:17,287
The powerful Christian Democrat,
his lackeys, his hypocrisy?

658
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:21,287
The Red Brigades are worse:
they want to imitate them!

659
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:23,287
They write nonsensical communiqués.

660
01:08:23,287 --> 01:08:26,287
Can you imagine if they were in power?

661
01:08:26,287 --> 01:08:30,287
Do you write any better? Your screenplay
rings false from start to finish.

662
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:33,287
Then you've read it.

663
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:34,287
How is it false?

664
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:37,287
Imagination has never saved anyone.

665
01:08:37,287 --> 01:08:40,287
Imagination is real.

666
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:43,287
I'd like to think that there's a
woman among the kidnappers.

667
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:46,287
A woman?

668
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:48,287
I changed the ending...

669
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:52,287
I imagined a girl, young,
in the army,

670
01:08:52,287 --> 01:08:55,287
but not because she read
<i>Das Kapital</i>...

671
01:08:55,287 --> 01:08:56,287
- she's a little like you.
- Why me?

672
01:08:56,287 --> 01:08:59,287
I imagined her to be like you.

673
01:08:59,287 --> 01:09:01,278
Young, beautiful,

674
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:06,287
but does everything to hide it.

675
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:09,287
This girl wants to save the prisoner

676
01:09:09,287 --> 01:09:11,287
without betraying her comrades.

677
01:09:11,287 --> 01:09:15,287
Calling the police would be
too great a betrayal.

678
01:09:15,287 --> 01:09:18,287
Don't you agree?

679
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:21,287
- I don't know.  Continue.
- But she has to take risks,

680
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:23,287
She may have to risk her life,

681
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:25,287
otherwise it would all be too easy.
She's forced to risk her own life

682
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:29,287
Like one of the terrorists that took part
in the kidnapping rationalizes it...

683
01:09:29,287 --> 01:09:29,287
Why?

684
01:09:29,287 --> 01:09:32,287
How could she in less than two months...

685
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:36,280
Must you always have a logical explanation?

686
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:42,287
The assassination horrifies her.
She's lost her faith.

687
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:47,840
It infuriates her to have
been so stupid.

688
01:09:49,287 --> 01:09:51,287
She has to do something...

689
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:55,280
to prevent herself from going crazy.

690
01:09:56,287 --> 01:10:00,280
What are you doing?

691
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:07,287
So do you think they'll kill him?

692
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:11,280
<i>...I've arrived just after the
skirmishes in front of the Senate.</i>

693
01:10:12,287 --> 01:10:16,287
<i>I heard noises, like tear gas bombs.</i>

694
01:10:16,287 --> 01:10:20,287
<i>At Place San Pantaleo,
a police chief told me:</i>

695
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:22,287
<i>"We responded with tear gas bombs</i>

696
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:26,280
<i>after we were attacked
with Molotov cocktails"...</i>

697
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:38,280
<i>...the only way to reach the
frozen lake is by helicopter.</i>

698
01:10:39,287 --> 01:10:43,287
<i>You can see the that the center</i>

699
01:10:43,287 --> 01:10:47,287
<i>was opened in the summer by divers.</i>

700
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:50,287
<i>For the moment, no results...</i>

701
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,287
Primo, what are you doing?

702
01:10:52,287 --> 01:10:56,280
Come in! You can see for yourself.

703
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:12,280
The canaries flew away.

704
01:11:37,287 --> 01:11:38,287
What's going on?

705
01:11:38,287 --> 01:11:40,287
Nothing, the canaries escaped.

706
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:44,287
- Was it you who let them go?
- Shut up!

707
01:11:44,287 --> 01:11:48,287
The cats must have eaten them.

708
01:11:48,287 --> 01:11:49,287
Your leader isn't there?

709
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:51,278
He left.

710
01:11:52,287 --> 01:11:54,278
He'll be back tomorrow.

711
01:11:59,287 --> 01:12:03,280
May I read you the letter
I wrote to the Holy Father?

712
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:07,287
I'd like you to give me your impressions.

713
01:12:07,287 --> 01:12:11,280
I've tried to write it many times.

714
01:12:20,287 --> 01:12:24,280
I'd also like to read it to your colleagues,
your comrades.

715
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:28,287
I'd like to know their opinions...

716
01:12:28,287 --> 01:12:32,287
It's my last chance.

717
01:12:32,287 --> 01:12:36,280
You can leave the door open,
I'll turn my back.

718
01:12:45,287 --> 01:12:47,278
Come over here.

719
01:12:48,287 --> 01:12:52,280
Be careful,  the door is open.

720
01:13:06,287 --> 01:13:10,280
- May I begin?
- Yes.

721
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:14,278
"Your Holiness"...

722
01:13:17,287 --> 01:13:21,280
Is there a women among you?

723
01:13:23,287 --> 01:13:27,287
I can tell because my socks are folded.

724
01:13:27,287 --> 01:13:29,278
"Your Holiness,

725
01:13:30,287 --> 01:13:32,287
"in this difficult time,

726
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:36,280
"permit me to address you,
with all respect and with hope,

727
01:13:40,287 --> 01:13:44,280
"in the end, that with
the grandest moral authority,

728
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,287
"and in the grandest Christian spirit,

729
01:13:47,287 --> 01:13:49,287
"you can intercede

730
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:52,287
"with the Italian governmental authorities

731
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:53,287
"for an equitable result

01:13:53,287 --> 01:13:57,280
"regarding the question of the
exchange of political prisoners

733
01:13:59,287 --> 01:14:03,280
"and my safe return to my family.

734
01:14:04,287 --> 01:14:11,287
"My presence and my assistance
areindispensable to them.

735
01:14:11,287 --> 01:14:13,287
"Only Your Holiness

736
01:14:13,287 --> 01:14:15,287
"can impart

01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,280
"the moral imperatives, and the right to live."

739
01:14:24,287 --> 01:14:27,287
"With the utmost gratitude
and profound respect,

740
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:31,280
"yours sincerely, Aldo Moro."

741
01:14:36,287 --> 01:14:38,278
So?

742
01:14:42,287 --> 01:14:46,280
Ask your comrades if I
could improve it further.

743
01:14:48,287 --> 01:14:51,287
I must find a word that
goes right to the heart.

744
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:55,280
There's only one.  Not two.

745
01:15:02,287 --> 01:15:04,278
You've made her cry.

746
01:15:08,287 --> 01:15:10,278
How old is she?

747
01:15:10,278 --> 01:15:14,287
23.

748
01:15:14,287 --> 01:15:18,287
I want to ask her a question.

749
01:15:18,287 --> 01:15:21,287
She's here, she's listening.

750
01:15:21,287 --> 01:15:24,287
I want to ask the young lady

751
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:28,280
if her emotions mean that my letter is moving.

752
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:41,280
No, I don't like it.

753
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:48,287
It's cold, resigned, formal.

754
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:50,278
But you cried.

755
01:15:51,287 --> 01:15:54,287
Yes, but out of anger.

756
01:15:54,287 --> 01:15:58,280
Then I have to rewrite it.

757
01:16:01,287 --> 01:16:05,280
I don't know.
An old man's going to read it.

758
01:16:29,287 --> 01:16:33,280
<i>Presidency of the Council of Ministers
"Unconditionally"</i>

759
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:38,287
<i>"...In the name of holy Christ</i>

760
01:16:38,287 --> 01:16:42,280
<i>"who I pray to and who, certainly,
won't ignore me.</i>

761
01:16:43,287 --> 01:16:46,287
<i>"I'm begging on my knees</i>

762
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:50,287
<i>"free president Aldo Moro,</i>

763
01:16:50,287 --> 01:16:52,278
<i>"unconditionally."</i>

<i>L'Unita - the Pope.:

765
01:17:02,287 --> 01:17:06,280
<i>Corriere della Sera, L'Unita
and Lotta Continua, please.</i>

766
01:17:09,287 --> 01:17:12,287
- Can I tell you something?
- Sure, go ahead.

767
01:17:12,287 --> 01:17:16,280
Your husband cheats on you.

768
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:27,278
Thanks.

769
01:18:10,287 --> 01:18:14,280
I declare myself a political prisoner.

770
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:31,287
What's wrong Chiara?

771
01:18:31,287 --> 01:18:35,280
Why are you taking him?
What's he done?

772
01:19:00,287 --> 01:19:04,280
Are you Bernardo,
our spiritual guide?

773
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:13,287
Thank you for joining us here.

774
01:19:13,287 --> 01:19:15,287
As you must know,

775
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:19,280
Aldo Moro was sentenced to death
by the Red Brigades.

776
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:26,287
We want to know, above all,

777
01:19:26,287 --> 01:19:30,280
if he's still alive.

778
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:39,280
Spirit of Bernardo, we ask you,
if you would,

779
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:44,280
to tell us where Aldo Moro is imprisoned.

780
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:55,280
Where is this place?

781
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:58,278
L.

782
01:19:59,287 --> 01:20:01,278
A

783
01:20:03,287 --> 01:20:05,278
L

784
01:20:06,287 --> 01:20:08,278
U

785
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:11,278
N

786
01:20:13,287 --> 01:20:15,287
A

787
01:20:15,287 --> 01:20:17,287
"The Moon."

788
01:20:17,287 --> 01:20:21,280
Come on Bernardo, don't kid around,
comic spirit.  It's a tragedy..

789
01:21:50,287 --> 01:21:54,287
<i>We die from heroin
and enslavement.</i>

790
01:21:54,287 --> 01:21:58,280
<i>I don't give a damn if
Aldo Moro dies too.</i>

791
01:22:44,287 --> 01:22:48,280
I've come to consecrate the house.
I'm the priest of Santa Lucia.

792
01:22:51,287 --> 01:22:55,280
- Am I disturbing you?
- No.

793
01:23:04,287 --> 01:23:06,278
Let's pray together.

794
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:10,287
God, please bless this family,

795
01:23:10,287 --> 01:23:12,287
so that all of its members

796
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:15,287
can be reunited, with love and peace,

797
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:18,287
which are gifts from resurrected Jesus.
We pray.

798
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:20,287
God, please bless this family.

799
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:23,287
Please God, assuage the fatigue of
those who work hard

800
01:23:23,287 --> 01:23:27,287
and assure that they won't lack
happiness or bread.

801
01:23:27,287 --> 01:23:29,287
God, please bless this family,

802
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:33,280
so that their passed members
can be together in that great place in the sky.

803
01:23:36,287 --> 01:23:40,287
Blessed art thou, Our Holy Father,
in this house.

804
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:44,280
By our Lord Jesus Christ.

805
01:24:05,287 --> 01:24:07,287
She's exhausted, she didn't
sleep all night.

806
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:09,287
- Is she pregnant?
- Yes.

807
01:24:09,287 --> 01:24:13,280
- See you at the baptism.
- Yes.  I'll give you a donation.

808
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:22,280
- I'll see you out.
- Thanks.

809
01:24:24,287 --> 01:24:26,278
Goodbye.

810
01:24:35,287 --> 01:24:37,278
Unfortunately,

811
01:24:38,287 --> 01:24:42,280
still no news of Aldo Moro.

812
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:46,287
We were trembling, yesterday,

813
01:24:46,287 --> 01:24:50,287
as we reached the deadline
set by these men

814
01:24:50,287 --> 01:24:53,287
who are self-proclaimed

815
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:57,280
judges and executioners.

816
01:24:58,287 --> 01:25:00,287
And we tremble again

817
01:25:00,287 --> 01:25:04,287
in hope and in prayer

818
01:25:04,287 --> 01:25:06,287
that we are spared--

819
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:10,287
Rome, Italy, the whole world,

820
01:25:10,287 --> 01:25:14,287
and especially his family and friends--

821
01:25:14,287 --> 01:25:18,280
the perpetration of this crime.

822
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:23,280
This waiting allows us to keep hoping.

823
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:29,287
I can't abandon my grandson.

824
01:25:29,287 --> 01:25:32,287
He loves me very much,
he'll fall ill.

825
01:25:32,287 --> 01:25:34,287
He couldn't handle my disappearance.

826
01:25:34,287 --> 01:25:37,287
As a good Christian,
I can accept death,

827
01:25:37,287 --> 01:25:41,287
but I can't die now!

828
01:25:41,287 --> 01:25:45,287
I could be your prisoner for life.

829
01:25:45,287 --> 01:25:49,280
I give you my word that
I won't try to run away.

830
01:25:51,287 --> 01:25:54,287
We'll keep trying until the very end.
In the meantime, write.

831
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:56,287
What more is there to write?

832
01:25:56,287 --> 01:26:00,280
I've already written to everybody,
and I even made my will.

833
01:26:01,287 --> 01:26:03,287
I'm not just talking about your family.

834
01:26:03,287 --> 01:26:06,287
Make everyone understand that
you've run out of time.

835
01:26:06,287 --> 01:26:08,287
You don't understand that I'll
become a martyr,

836
01:26:08,287 --> 01:26:12,287
I'll be the idiot that destroys you.

837
01:26:12,287 --> 01:26:15,287
You must understand.

838
01:26:15,287 --> 01:26:19,287
When the TV shows images
of my dead body,

839
01:26:19,287 --> 01:26:22,287
people won't understand you,
they'll hate you!

840
01:26:22,287 --> 01:26:24,278
In the meantime, write.

841
01:26:57,287 --> 01:27:00,287
Have you decided to kill him?

842
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:02,287
Yes, we all agree.

843
01:27:02,287 --> 01:27:04,287
Why'd you ask him to write?

844
01:27:04,287 --> 01:27:08,287
So he can kill time.

845
01:27:08,287 --> 01:27:12,280
The pope himself begged you.
Isn't that enough for you?

846
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:17,287
Why? Many comrades were impressed.

847
01:27:17,287 --> 01:27:19,287
Haven't you read it?

848
01:27:19,287 --> 01:27:21,287
Freedom, unconditionally.

849
01:27:21,287 --> 01:27:24,287
If we set him free unconditionally,
we're fucked in the head!

850
01:27:24,287 --> 01:27:27,287
We have to set him free
unconditionally.

851
01:27:27,287 --> 01:27:29,287
They don't want to acknowledge us.

852
01:27:29,287 --> 01:27:31,287
And why would they?  If you don't
acknowledge them?

853
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:35,287
"You"?
You're not one of us now?

854
01:27:35,287 --> 01:27:39,287
Yeah, but I don't understand
why we have to kill him.

855
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:43,287
Nothing can convince me that this is right.
I can say that, can't I?

856
01:27:43,287 --> 01:27:47,287
The workers revolution can't
be subject to humanitarian limitations.

857
01:27:47,287 --> 01:27:49,287
Nothing is prohibited.

858
01:27:49,287 --> 01:27:51,287
For a Proletarian victory,

859
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:53,287
we're entitled to kill even our own mother.

860
01:27:53,287 --> 01:27:57,287
What appears inconceivable, absurd,
or inhuman to us

861
01:27:57,287 --> 01:28:01,287
is a heroic act of annihilating
our subjective reality.

862
01:28:01,287 --> 01:28:05,287
It's the best of humanity.

863
01:28:05,287 --> 01:28:08,287
We have to reason this way!

864
01:28:08,287 --> 01:28:11,287
And everyone agrees:
the central base, the leadership, all...

865
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:13,287
"Everyone"?

866
01:28:13,287 --> 01:28:17,280
We're the ones who've imprisoned
him for almost two months.

867
01:28:18,287 --> 01:28:22,280
We're the only ones entitled to decide!

868
01:28:30,287 --> 01:28:31,287
Can't we wait?

869
01:28:31,287 --> 01:28:35,287
No, it's too dangerous.

870
01:28:35,287 --> 01:28:38,287
Their negotiations are only
to buy time.

871
01:28:38,287 --> 01:28:42,280
- Tonight?
- Unless something comes up.

872
01:29:08,287 --> 01:29:12,287
You're tired.
Tonight, you must sleep.

873
01:29:12,287 --> 01:29:14,287
Eat something.

874
01:29:14,287 --> 01:29:16,278
OK.

875
01:29:28,287 --> 01:29:32,287
<i>The Aldo Moro affair.  The leadership
of the D.C. will meet tomorrow.</i>

876
01:29:32,287 --> 01:29:36,280
<i>Another attack in Milan:
A doctor is kneecapped.</i>

877
01:29:37,287 --> 01:29:39,287
<i>The attack was carried out</i>

878
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:42,287
<i>by the armed Communist Proletariat.</i>

879
01:29:42,287 --> 01:29:46,280
<i>Shooting in Bologna after
post office hold-up.</i>

880
01:29:48,287 --> 01:29:50,278
<i>Don't eat.</i>

881
01:30:11,287 --> 01:30:14,287
We've made a big mistake.

882
01:30:14,287 --> 01:30:17,287
People will be on our backs.

883
01:30:17,287 --> 01:30:21,280
"People"?
The bourgeoisie?

884
01:30:22,287 --> 01:30:24,287
For example, my fiancée and her family...

885
01:30:24,287 --> 01:30:26,287
- Have you spoken with her?
- Yes.

886
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:29,287
- About us?
- What do you take me for?

887
01:30:29,287 --> 01:30:31,278
Calm down.

888
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:38,287
We're no longer heroes, but assassins!

889
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:41,287
According to who?  <i>La Repubblica</i>?
You're nuts!

890
01:30:41,287 --> 01:30:45,280
Where are you going?

891
01:30:48,287 --> 01:30:51,287
Did you hear what the president said?
Think about it.

892
01:30:51,287 --> 01:30:55,287
They want him to die.
We'll do them a service by killing him.

893
01:30:55,287 --> 01:30:56,287
Think about that!

894
01:30:56,287 --> 01:31:00,280
We've proven ourselves the strongest.
Pity won't stop us.

895
01:31:01,287 --> 01:31:03,287
We only respond to the working class.

896
01:31:03,287 --> 01:31:05,278
Fuck you!

897
01:31:08,287 --> 01:31:12,280
That's the last time.
You'll never see me again!

898
01:31:22,287 --> 01:31:24,278
Give me a hand.

899
01:32:03,287 --> 01:32:06,287
- Is he not feeling well?
- He said he's not hungry.

900
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:10,280
I'll take his plate.

901
01:33:03,287 --> 01:33:07,280
I'm not hungry.
I'm going to bed.

902
01:36:12,287 --> 01:36:13,287
<i>Aldo Moro was killed
on May 9,1978</i>

903
01:36:13,287 --> 01:36:17,280
<i>after being imprisoned for 55 days.</i>

904
01:36:18,287 --> 01:36:22,287
<i>One by one, the kidnappers
and assassins were arrested</i>

905
01:36:22,287 --> 01:36:25,287
<i>and sentenced to life,</i>

906
01:36:25,287 --> 01:36:29,280
<i>a penalty which they serve
under a system of semi-freedom.</i>

907
01:36:30,287 --> 01:36:34,287
<i>The solemn ceremony of
the State funerals</i>

908
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:37,287
<i>was conducted by Pope Paul VI</i>

909
01:36:37,287 --> 01:36:40,287
<i>at St. John in Lateran Cathedral</i>

910
01:36:40,287 --> 01:36:44,280
<i>and in the presence of the entire
Italian political class.</i>

911
01:36:45,287 --> 01:36:49,280
<i>All that was missing was the
body of Aldo Moro,</i>

912
01:36:50,287 --> 01:36:53,287
<i>due to the refusal of his family,</i>

913
01:36:53,287 --> 01:36:57,280
<i>who chose to have a private ceremony.</i>
