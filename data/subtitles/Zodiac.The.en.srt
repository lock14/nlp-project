1
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,520
Whoa.

2
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,664
This is big. I know this is big.

3
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:31,807
I... I... I mean, I know Iraq was big,

4
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:35,039
but this... This might actually be it.

5
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,118
Sophie, please.

6
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:43,198
This...

7
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,350
This can't be.

8
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:49,984
Go get Alberts.

9
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:52,447
Get Alberts, quick.

10
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,015
This is it, isn't it?

11
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,239
This is it.

12
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,502
Man, you are out of it today.

13
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:29,151
You know she just looked at you.

14
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,454
She was lookin' at you.

15
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,406
She's got good taste.

16
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:36,191
Look, man,
you should go in with a different approach.

17
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,471
Something unique.

18
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,871
Yeah, well, I'm sure I should,

19
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:42,591
but we can't all be you, can we?

20
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:44,287
Yeah, I'm pretty awesome.

21
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:46,461
All right, this is what you do.

22
00:02:46,461 --> 00:02:48,447
Guys talk too much, right? Go up to her

23
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:50,655
all mysterious,

24
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,831
just stare.

25
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:54,591
Chicks dig that.

26
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:57,055
- You ever heard the term "creeper"?
- Yes. Yes, I have.

27
00:02:57,086 --> 00:02:59,263
- Professor Martin! Hey.
- Jennifer.

28
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:00,829
- How are you?
- I'm good, how you doing?

29
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,103
Aww, man.

30
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,247
Your dad gets to spend an
hour with her every week.

31
00:03:05,278 --> 00:03:06,431
That's not fair.

32
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,742
Yeah, you were great.

33
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:09,215
Do you think you wouldn't mind
helping me study for another one?

34
00:03:09,246 --> 00:03:11,550
And she pays him.

35
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:13,375
God, I would tutor her for free.

36
00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:15,806
I would tutor her all day.

37
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,335
You should be proud... oh.

38
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,287
Oh, she's... She's a hugger.

39
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,167
- She's a good hugger.
- Good to see ya.

40
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,990
He just melted into that. He just...

41
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:26,211
Good morning, Professor Martin.

42
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,350
- Good morning.
- How's Jennifer today?

43
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:31,070
I'm sure she's fine.

44
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,606
Mm-hmm. I'm sure she is.

45
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:33,759
How you doin', bud?

46
00:03:33,789 --> 00:03:35,103
What'd you like?

47
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:37,790
Uh, nothing for me. I just...

48
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,631
Hey, Joel, um...

49
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,735
Jennifer needed some more cream.
Can you, uh, run this out to her

50
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:46,655
- for me, please?
- Totally.

51
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,926
Thank you. I appreciate that.

52
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:50,526
Thanks.

53
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:52,191
You know you... You should ask her out.

54
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:53,502
She's a nice girl.

55
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,687
- Just like that, huh?
- Yeah, just like that.

56
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:01,022
From the man forced to
use online dating sites

57
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:02,879
is giving me advice? Hmm.

58
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:06,175
Hey, Roger.

59
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:10,048
Yeah, well, hold off using
your phone for a while, okay?

60
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:16,254
Nah, I don't need any coffee.

61
00:04:16,286 --> 00:04:17,471
It's free, you can afford it.

62
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:20,735
You know, under Sumerian law,

63
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:23,038
a son who disrespects his father
would have his tongue torn out.

64
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,630
Well, I'll remember that the
next time we're in Sumeria.

65
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:27,678
Sumer. The next time we're in Sumer.

66
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,600
Whatever.

67
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,726
Oh, come on, Colin.

68
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,415
Seriously another Setag book?

69
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:37,822
Shouldn't you be studying calculus?

70
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:41,534
He was building holograms
in his garage at 15.

71
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:44,158
He was a millionaire by 22.
I think he's worth studying.

72
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,846
Yeah, according to you.

73
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,670
I should get going.

74
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,430
Mortgage isn't gonna pay for itself.

75
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,606
A rare phenomenon known as ball lightning

76
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,495
on a scale never seen...

77
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,439
...has caused severe fires
throughout the Chinese fields.

78
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,167
We are now receiving reports...

79
00:05:03,134 --> 00:05:05,951
- Wow.
- Holy...

80
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,367
- Hey, Colin, come back!
- Jennifer!

81
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,567
Hey, you all right?

82
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,862
Just stay with me.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

83
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,071
- Run.
- You're okay. You're okay.

84
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:40,158
What is it this time?

85
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,343
Colin!

86
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,086
Joel!

87
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,663
...the meteor on Wednesday
is only the latest...

88
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,630
No, Colin, he's...
he's pretty shaken, but he's okay.

89
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:08,127
No, no, the town's basically shut down.

90
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:11,166
Talk to, uh, Aunt Jackie?

91
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:15,071
No, I...
I can't get a hold of anyone. I... I...

92
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:16,286
Yes, of course.

93
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,454
I know, I know. I'll keep trying, okay?

94
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,750
All right, stay safe.

95
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:26,814
We have received eyewitness reports

96
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,382
- describing the size...
- Hey.

97
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:30,975
Hey, buddy.

98
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,855
You, uh... Look, you hungry?

99
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,697
I can... I can make you some pasta.

100
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:38,430
I'm fine.

101
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,399
Hey, I should take a look at that.

102
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,903
Meteor-like activities

103
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,951
that have been seen in various
areas in North America...

104
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,606
Look, Colin, I don't...

105
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,624
I said I'm fine.

106
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,742
Colin, I...

107
00:06:55,774 --> 00:06:57,759
Hello?

108
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,685
Can I help you?

109
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,264
Uh, is Professor Martin home?

110
00:07:09,214 --> 00:07:11,581
- And you are?
- Kathryn Keen, Polydynamics.

111
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:14,079
Really? Today?

112
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:17,245
You don't think there's a
better time you can come back?

113
00:07:17,278 --> 00:07:20,158
Actually, no.
It's quite urgent that I speak with him.

114
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,038
Wow. All right. Dad!

115
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,175
Look, my dad's a nice guy.

116
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:27,678
He's a bit awkward at
first, but he's smart.

117
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,887
Probably too smart for his own good.

118
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,191
Just give him a chance
to open up and relax.

119
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:35,846
- Once you get to know him...
- I'm sorry, I don't... I don't follow.

120
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,574
Well, to be honest,
he hasn't had a lot of luck lately.

121
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:42,718
Dad,
a woman from the dating service is here!

122
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,711
Excuse me?!

123
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:48,670
- Uh, hello?
- Professor Martin, I'm Kathryn Keen.

124
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,632
I represent Polydynamics,
which is not a dating service.

125
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:55,238
Uh, can I have a moment of your time,
please?

126
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,846
Uh... Let me call you back.

127
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,182
Polydynamics is a research company.

128
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,677
We look for solutions for global issues:

129
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:05,949
water shortages, poverty, climate change.

130
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:07,103
Okay.

131
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,959
A few days ago, one of our field teams

132
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,838
found something... unique.

133
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,151
What is this?

134
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,879
I was hoping you'd tell me.

135
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,877
It's a zodiac. Where'd you find this, Iraq?

136
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,151
A lead mine in Peru.

137
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:23,903
No, that's... That's not possible.

138
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,918
This style of writing was never
used outside of the Middle East.

139
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,125
But, look, don't take my word for it.

140
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:29,538
The world's preeminent authority is...

141
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,903
- Dr. Robert Bowles.
- That's right.

142
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:37,022
Dr. Bowles died two days ago.

143
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,966
The meteor showers caused
a cave in at the dig site.

144
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,294
I didn't know.

145
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,759
- Well, then there's Paul...
- Alberts?

146
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,249
Yes,
they were both killed in the meteor shower,

147
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,918
but this now leaves you as
our authority on this matter.

148
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,374
Come with me to the site.

149
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:03,486
I need your expertise.

150
00:09:04,765 --> 00:09:06,302
What... what, now?

151
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,118
It shouldn't take more than a week.
We'll pay you, of course for your time.

152
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,167
- Say... say $50,000?
- It's not about the money.

153
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:12,254
Uh, yes, it is.

154
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,431
Look, I haven't done field work in years.

155
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,663
But you said it yourself,
I mean, it's extraordinary.

156
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,166
This is... This is the find of a lifetime.

157
00:09:19,197 --> 00:09:20,370
- No.
- We want double.

158
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,999
What? The mortgage isn't gonna pay itself.

159
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:28,798
Done. Done.

160
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,615
Well, when do we leave?

161
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,653
You look like a seven-year-old
on a field trip.

162
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:12,958
It feels good to be back in the field.

163
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,110
Thanks.

164
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,726
So they finished clearing out the tunnels.

165
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,383
Just watch your step inside.

166
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:29,119
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Stay here.

167
00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:31,357
- No, don't even think about it. I'm...
- Colin, I'll be right back.

168
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:32,959
- Just, please, okay?
- You can't be serious.

169
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,165
- Colin.
- Dad, come on.

170
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:37,981
Be right back.

171
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:40,095
So much for stickin' together.

172
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:44,222
Thanks for the eight-hour flight, though.

173
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:45,942
At least I got to watch
the news in Spanish.

174
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,831
- You need a minute with him?
- No, not right now.

175
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,701
After you.

176
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,365
- You say this is a lead mine?
- Why?

177
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:12,894
They didn't mine much
of the lead out of it.

178
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,006
It's right through here.

179
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:24,575
Careful.

180
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:35,711
This is incredible.

181
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:43,647
It's a heliocentric zodiac.

182
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:49,278
Wait, wait, what?

183
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,518
One, two, three, four, five, six,

184
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:54,302
seven, eight planets.
The sun in the center.

185
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,831
This is... This is incredibly detailed.

186
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:58,143
I've never...

187
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,285
I've never seen an ancient civilization

188
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:02,769
with such an accurate
idea of the solar system.

189
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,206
Are those traditional zodiac symbols?

190
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:08,831
Those are astronomical glyphs.

191
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:13,567
- What does it mean?
- I have no idea.

192
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,311
I thought you were the expert.

193
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:19,389
Are you kidding? On what?

194
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:20,957
This is unprecedented. This is...

195
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,645
pre-Babylonian, pre-Sumerian. This is...

196
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,047
It's like asking a
zoologist about a unicorn.

197
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,110
Screw this.

198
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,134
Cancer.

199
00:12:52,734 --> 00:12:54,525
Sagittarius.

200
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:55,837
Huh.

201
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,726
What?

202
00:12:57,758 --> 00:12:59,999
Some of the zodiac signs are upside down.

203
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:03,005
Wait.

204
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:05,663
There's eight rings,

205
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:07,230
eight planets.

206
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,558
So what is this ring?

207
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:17,662
It goes around and comes back here.

208
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:20,029
Why?

209
00:13:20,062 --> 00:13:22,033
Why the hole in the center of the sun?

210
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,366
Unless...

211
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,951
ninth planet.

212
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:32,413
- Excuse me?
- Nibiru.

213
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,038
Planet X. I'm sure you've heard of it.

214
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:37,597
What, not up on your doomsday prophesies?

215
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:38,782
Guess not.

216
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:40,318
Dad!

217
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,342
See, Bowles, he...

218
00:13:57,374 --> 00:13:59,230
He loved legends.

219
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,198
Especially ones based on historical facts.

220
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,335
He chased lots, but there was one...

221
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,471
one that he was absolutely obsessed with.

222
00:14:10,878 --> 00:14:13,328
He searched his entire life.
Maybe he was cl...

223
00:14:13,758 --> 00:14:15,582
Maybe he was close after all.

224
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:17,950
You think the stone is hidden here?

225
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,774
How do you know about the stone?

226
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:24,222
What's happening?

227
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:25,663
Stay back.

228
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,783
Dad?

229
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:38,591
Kathryn!

230
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,078
Dad?

231
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:55,711
Interesting.

232
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:59,270
It's not just some kind of puzzle, it's...

233
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:02,174
- It's a machine.
- What did you do?

234
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,018
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

235
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:08,125
Kathryn.

236
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,695
Here.

237
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,238
Should we be doing that?

238
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,405
Ancient civilizations built
all kinds of elaborate puzzles.

239
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:18,813
Even complex devices.

240
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:21,215
In Greece,
they found an analog computer device

241
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:22,738
that's over 2,000 years old.

242
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:33,663
Look.

243
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:47,326
I just found your unicorn.

244
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,038
Uh...

245
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:27,423
Hello? Dad!

246
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,254
Don't touch it.

247
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,309
What is that?

248
00:16:37,341 --> 00:16:39,807
Why do you have that?

249
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,173
Dad!

250
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,765
Colin. Colin!

251
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:51,071
Dad!

252
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:53,758
Dad!

253
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,263
Colin!

254
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:57,182
Colin!

255
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,062
You okay? Dad!

256
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:01,918
- Colin!
- Are you okay?

257
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:05,278
Colin!

258
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:07,326
Colin!

259
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,959
You okay?

260
00:17:11,773 --> 00:17:13,278
What's... what's going on?

261
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:14,493
- There's someone in here!
- What?!

262
00:17:14,526 --> 00:17:16,509
There's someone buried in here.

263
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,077
Give me a hand.

264
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:32,798
There, got it.

265
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:38,846
Oh, my God. It's Sophie.

266
00:17:38,877 --> 00:17:40,605
Is she alive?

267
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:46,558
Kathryn, call for a helivac now! Go!

268
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,846
Here, help me.

269
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:52,125
That's all right.

270
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:55,357
- Careful, grab her hip.
- Watch your head.

271
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,021
We gotta get her outta here!

272
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,174
Come on, we gotta go!

273
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,798
Colin, we gotta get her outta here!

274
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:06,143
Get the other side.

275
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:07,806
Come on.

276
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,213
Come on.

277
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,711
Yeah, come on!

278
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:14,653
This way!

279
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,509
This is Keen,
we need immediate air lift evac onsite!

280
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:29,790
I repeat,

281
00:18:29,821 --> 00:18:34,046
immediate evac at the mine entrance.

282
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:37,309
Chopper inbound. ETA in six minutes.

283
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:39,518
Come on, Colin!

284
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:40,925
Come on, let's go!

285
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:43,646
Come on!

286
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,405
- Almost there.
- Okay.

287
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:50,814
- Yeah, come on!
- You got her?

288
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,030
We gotta go!

289
00:18:57,021 --> 00:18:58,781
Come on!

290
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:00,679
Get in the car. Just get in the car!

291
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,806
- Where is it?
- Come on! No! Keep going!

292
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,278
- Go, go, go!
- Is she breathing?

293
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,965
Hold on! Hold on!

294
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,294
Oh! Come on!

295
00:19:52,093 --> 00:19:54,365
It's getting closer!

296
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:56,894
Hang on everybody! Hang on!

297
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,750
Why are we still here?

298
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:32,605
- Dad?
- Huh?

299
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:36,029
Oh, they just need to ask their
questions then we're free to go.

300
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:37,950
If we want to.

301
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:39,101
We do want to, right?

302
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:43,677
Honestly, I'm getting tired of this
whole extreme archaeology thing.

303
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,117
What does this even mean?

304
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:47,006
What does this even mean?

305
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,246
I'm not 100% sure yet. Have you seen...

306
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:51,582
What does this look like? Huh?

307
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:52,733
I don't know. A hair pin?

308
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:55,518
No, have you seen...
have you seen this shape recently?

309
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:56,561
Look closer, Colin.

310
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,814
I don't know.

311
00:20:58,845 --> 00:21:00,990
Back home... Back home, the meteors.

312
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:04,029
I think they... I think this is Leo.

313
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,846
Leo as in what?

314
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:08,829
- The zodiac sign Leo?
- Exactly.

315
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:10,589
Here. Then there's this.

316
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,549
Look at this.
The twin peaks rushing at us, right?

317
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:16,894
- Tidal wave.
- Dad.

318
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:21,021
Colin, what if... what if the zodiac
isn't birth signs, or astrology.

319
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,805
What if it's a prediction?

320
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:25,534
That would make, what?

321
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:28,157
Wait a second.

322
00:21:28,189 --> 00:21:29,630
Aries.

323
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:31,678
Okay, you need to take a step
back and just listen to yourself

324
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,213
because honestly I...

325
00:21:33,244 --> 00:21:34,846
Kathryn, you gotta see this.

326
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,405
Professor Martin, I'm Agent Tyler.
We're ready for you.

327
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:40,094
Terrific. I need to speak to Kathryn Keen.

328
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,501
Dad, you're gonna want to
get your facts straight

329
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:44,286
- before you go public.
- Come on.

330
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:45,405
Please.

331
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,676
You sure you're up for this, Soph?

332
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,885
Yeah. I'm fine.

333
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:04,445
It helps being here.

334
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,365
Miss Keen? Professor Martin...

335
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,286
Kathryn, the carvings in the cave

336
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:13,278
I think I found something.

337
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:15,453
You did.

338
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:18,622
And your country is grateful.

339
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,053
Uh...

340
00:22:21,085 --> 00:22:22,365
You're welcome.

341
00:22:22,396 --> 00:22:25,244
- Woodward, D.O.D.
- Neil Martin.

342
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,486
You don't look any worse for wear.

343
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:31,294
If it wasn't for you,
I'd be under water so...

344
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:32,605
thank you.

345
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:35,773
The zodiac.
I think it's some kind of warning.

346
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:36,990
- Zodiac?
- What if the disasters

347
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,142
that we've seen across the globe

348
00:22:38,173 --> 00:22:40,125
are tied to the zodiac symbols we found?

349
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:42,238
Look at this.

350
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,230
Ball lightning in China.

351
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,566
Capricorn.

352
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:46,973
See the similarities?

353
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,822
And then we saw... We saw Leo firsthand.

354
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:52,413
Meteors wreaking havoc across
the Northern Hemisphere.

355
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,814
Then we have Scorpio.

356
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:56,924
Scorpio, tsunamis across South America.

357
00:22:56,957 --> 00:22:59,837
That's three signs, there are nine left.

358
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,821
I think it's some kind of, uh...

359
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:03,486
like a countdown.

360
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:06,239
And, if I'm right, Aries is next.

361
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,990
We need to figure out what this is.

362
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,869
- Looks kinda like a fountain.
- Possibly.

363
00:23:11,902 --> 00:23:14,589
Yeah, look,
I think it's some kind of energy.

364
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:16,605
Like forcing upwards. Possibly a...

365
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:19,964
Professor, what does any of
this have to do with the stone?

366
00:23:19,997 --> 00:23:21,405
The stone?

367
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:24,125
Dad, I think we should go.

368
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:26,046
Thank you, Professor.
Can we start the test?

369
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:27,037
- Two minutes.
- Dad...

370
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:29,438
Wait, wait.

371
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,773
Now that you have the stone, that's it?

372
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:33,501
Years of research by Bowles led to this.

373
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:35,357
This...
this could be a revolutionary power source.

374
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,230
- All of our global energy issues...
- Energy? This isn't about energy.

375
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,949
Yes, it is, and we're grateful
for your help, Professor,

376
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,472
but we'll take it from here.

377
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:46,269
No. Kathryn, you're...

378
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:49,374
What is this?

379
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:57,150
Images from the space
agencies heliospheric feed.

380
00:23:57,182 --> 00:23:59,580
Apparently our solar
system has a new member.

381
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:00,797
How long have you known about this?

382
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:02,942
Just discovered.

383
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:06,109
We think a combination of
the extremely long orbit

384
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,356
and... and the path that it
tracked behind the sun...

385
00:24:07,388 --> 00:24:09,021
Wait a sec... That's the cave.

386
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:12,382
One elongated path crossing the
orbit of the other eight planets.

387
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:14,684
Like somehow they knew.

388
00:24:14,717 --> 00:24:16,413
Nibiru, the stone, the ninth planet.

389
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:19,165
- Nibiru?
- Look, it's all connected.

390
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:20,541
Professor,
that's a really interesting theory.

391
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:21,916
Look, if this is real,

392
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:24,125
the legend of Nibiru is
about the end of the world.

393
00:24:24,157 --> 00:24:26,557
Okay, Professor. Thank you.

394
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:27,740
Agent Tyler will make sure

395
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,213
- you and your son get home safe.
- Kathryn, wait a...

396
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:31,326
Miss Keen, can we please start the test?

397
00:24:31,356 --> 00:24:33,278
- Let's go, Professor.
- Kathryn!

398
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:36,479
Final positions.

399
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,452
Remember when you taught me
to always lead with the facts?

400
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:05,150
I was leading with the facts.

401
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:07,773
I'm not some crazy person
ranting about the End of Days.

402
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,597
The zodiac is a roadmap
to coming destruction?

403
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,229
Exactly.

404
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,077
Dad, if it sounds crazy, it usually is.

405
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,645
Get in the car.

406
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:27,037
What if he's right?

407
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,925
- Not now, Sophie.
- I'm just saying.

408
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:30,718
I see the similarities.

409
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,670
Bowles trusted him, and from what I saw...

410
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:36,349
Bowles knew to temper his theories
until he had concrete evidence.

411
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,013
We believe the stone was encased in lead

412
00:25:42,045 --> 00:25:44,028
to shield it from specific rays of light

413
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,492
that would trigger a powerful reaction.

414
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,205
Our test will blast the stone
with the whole spectrum of rays

415
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:53,020
from radio to gamma so we can isolate

416
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,461
the frequency that triggers it.

417
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:55,677
Go ahead.

418
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:42,430
Fire up the D.E.W.s.

419
00:26:44,861 --> 00:26:47,741
Directed-energy weapons activating.

420
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:53,085
Nothing.

421
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:56,413
Moving to infrared.

422
00:27:07,006 --> 00:27:09,405
Infrared activating.

423
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:30,334
Moving to ultraviolet.

424
00:27:38,077 --> 00:27:40,028
Ultraviolet activating.

425
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:49,566
Moving to gamma.

426
00:27:55,614 --> 00:27:58,013
Gamma activating.

427
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:06,846
Still nothing.

428
00:28:10,718 --> 00:28:13,246
Copy that.

429
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:22,717
Yes, you think I'm crazy.
I get it. I understand.

430
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,605
Indulge me, all right?

431
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:30,885
Look, we need to figure out what Aries is.

432
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:37,116
Enough. Shut it down.

433
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,452
I just need about an hour
to run some diagnostics.

434
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,246
- Don't bother.
- Shutdown commencing.

435
00:28:41,277 --> 00:28:43,069
Yeah, it's me.
Tell the senator I'm available after all.

436
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,182
- Wait.
- Miss Keen,

437
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:47,611
I wanted this to work
just as much as you did.

438
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:50,525
- Energy level rising.
- What's that? What's happening?

439
00:28:50,717 --> 00:28:52,253
- Energy level rising.
- The stone's reacting.

440
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,597
What did you do?

441
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:57,470
Nothing, we're shut down.

442
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:00,413
Sophie.

443
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,589
That's not us.

444
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:32,924
What is that?

445
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,094
Ugh!

446
00:30:00,797 --> 00:30:02,397
Wha...

447
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,606
- He's out cold.
- What was that?

448
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:08,317
Proof.

449
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,294
Field team, report!

450
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:13,980
The scopes are dead, I can't see anything!

451
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,221
Field!
Someone tell me what's going on out there!

452
00:30:16,252 --> 00:30:18,492
- What happened?
- I don't know yet.

453
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,613
You've never even gotten a speeding ticket

454
00:30:31,644 --> 00:30:33,596
and now you're stealing trucks
from the Department of Defense.

455
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:35,452
- Borrowing.
- It's government property.

456
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:38,526
- I pay my taxes.
- I don't think it works like that.

457
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:41,565
Please,
please tell me this is not about the rock.

458
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:43,069
Okay, I won't tell you.

459
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,941
- You're scaring me.
- Colin! Look...

460
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,540
you've seen everything I have seen.

461
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:50,557
There's nine signs left, nine disasters.

462
00:30:50,588 --> 00:30:53,278
And based on what I've seen,
I don't see how we survive any of it.

463
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:55,549
And the stone is somehow involved.

464
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,552
I need to get it before Woodward does.

465
00:30:57,744 --> 00:30:59,452
He doesn't trust the end-of-the-world guy.

466
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,148
Shocking.

467
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,709
Colin, just... Just stay right there.

468
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,692
Dad, we can't be here.

469
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,763
You saw what that thing did. We...

470
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:39,933
Oh, my God.

471
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:42,653
This is so stupid.

472
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:03,261
Woodward.

473
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:07,453
Frakkin' Tyler.

474
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:24,669
This is Agent Tyler.

475
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,173
I'm on my way to the test site now.

476
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:27,357
Dad, we gotta get out of here.

477
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:29,053
- Copy that.
- Dad, we gotta go.

478
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:32,925
We have to go.

479
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,260
All right. Go! Go!

480
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:48,637
Come on!

481
00:33:05,469 --> 00:33:07,196
Now you're scaring me.

482
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:09,884
My flight response kicked in.
I can't control it.

483
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:12,990
Slow down and tell your flight response
to stay off the main roads. Okay?

484
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,749
Keep an eye out for Aries.

485
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,109
Oh, and being chased by
government agents isn't enough.

486
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:22,621
I want checkpoints. I want phone taps.

487
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,509
I want the works. Yeah.

488
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,292
- The hell happened here?
- The stone happened here.

489
00:33:27,324 --> 00:33:29,882
Which the professor still has.
Which I want back.

490
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:34,237
This time let's, uh,
try not to lose any vehicles.

491
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:37,373
- This is unbelievable.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:38,429
How could the stone do this?

493
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:41,244
I don't know.

494
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:42,493
Absolutely.

495
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,477
This facility and everything in it

496
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:45,853
is now property of the Defense Department.

497
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:48,189
What?! Why?

498
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:51,037
National security.

499
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:53,244
You can't do that!

500
00:33:53,277 --> 00:33:55,740
That power cannot be in civilian hands.

501
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,788
Not Polydynamics, not Professor Martin,

502
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,069
not you, nobody.

503
00:33:59,101 --> 00:34:02,108
Do you understand that?

504
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,932
Yeah, I'm here.

505
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:07,292
Yes, they've been informed.

506
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,757
- We need to find Neil.
- We've secured the site.

507
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:12,572
Absolutely. I'm on my way there now.

508
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:23,740
So, where we going?

509
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:25,244
We need to get back to that cave.

510
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:27,262
You can't seriously want to go back there.

511
00:34:27,293 --> 00:34:30,045
- It was wiped out by a tsunami.
- No, you don't know that for sure.

512
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:32,572
Well,
you don't know the world's ending for sure.

513
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,068
Look, Colin,
I don't have all the answers yet.

514
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:37,724
But I know what we've seen is only
the beginning of what's to come.

515
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:39,869
The drawings in that cave,
the mechanism that's there,

516
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,429
this stone... It's all part of a puzzle.

517
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,606
We solve that and maybe we can stop this.

518
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:50,172
Drive careful, all right?

519
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,492
We've got a 100-mile perimeter in place.

520
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:09,309
Good. I wanna know as soon as he's spotted.

521
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,838
One more thing.
Kathryn and Sophie are missing.

522
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:18,909
Well, we can't drive to Peru,

523
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,338
and if we go to the
airport we'll be arrested.

524
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:39,293
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Where's the stone?

525
00:35:39,324 --> 00:35:42,429
- You lied to me.
- I risked my career coming here!

526
00:35:47,516 --> 00:35:50,556
- Dad!
- Aries.

527
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:57,998
Kathryn, grab the bag!
Let's get outta here! Come on!

528
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,940
- Go! Let's go!
- Go!

529
00:36:06,972 --> 00:36:08,668
What is it?

530
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:13,757
Look out!

531
00:36:32,188 --> 00:36:33,309
Dad!

532
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:38,300
It's everywhere!

533
00:36:39,293 --> 00:36:40,318
Watch it!

534
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,742
Ah!

535
00:37:15,963 --> 00:37:17,532
I think it's over.

536
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:23,389
You were right.
You described it almost perfectly.

537
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,981
Yeah, well, I wish I was wrong. Come on.

538
00:37:33,981 --> 00:37:36,509
Yes, sir. We'll all be praying.

539
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,045
Yes, sir.

540
00:37:38,077 --> 00:37:39,548
Woodward.

541
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:43,420
Hang on. What do you got?

542
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:46,012
Found remnants of the truck
off-road about 15 miles out.

543
00:37:46,045 --> 00:37:48,925
- No bodies.
- Text me that. The stone?

544
00:37:48,956 --> 00:37:50,237
Negative.

545
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,559
We did pick up a signal
from Kathryn's cell.

546
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:55,132
It's faint, but we're triangulating it now.

547
00:37:55,164 --> 00:37:56,349
Okay.

548
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,782
Woodward.

549
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:01,340
- What?
- Sir.

550
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:03,836
Those geysers or whatever you wanna call
'em,

551
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:06,172
they did look a bit like the Aries sign.

552
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:07,260
Hang on.

553
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,275
Yeah,
and atomic explosions look like mushrooms,

554
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:10,364
but I don't put 'em on my pizza.

555
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:12,349
I don't wanna hear about...

556
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,708
that zodiac theory from that nut job.

557
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:18,460
Yes, sir.

558
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:22,333
Hang on.

559
00:38:23,465 --> 00:38:26,077
Volcanic eruptions happened
as far away as Moscow,

560
00:38:26,108 --> 00:38:27,932
Paris is completely obliterated.

561
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:29,565
The president has declared marshal law

562
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:32,061
and moved the entire cabinet
into emergency shelters,

563
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,309
and what do I have?

564
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:35,548
Oh, a nutty professor runnin'
around with a suitcase nuke.

565
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:38,331
You find that professor,
you find that stone, you secure it,

566
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:40,445
you do your job, and you do it now!

567
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:43,998
Yes, sir.

568
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,204
Idiot!

569
00:38:46,237 --> 00:38:48,474
No, not you. I don't have that information.

570
00:38:56,603 --> 00:38:58,268
Let me ask you something.

571
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,509
You actually buy into all this stuff?

572
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,748
Some guy from Sumeria
foreseeing the future?

573
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,148
Sumer, not Sumeria.

574
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:07,773
Seriously? You're worse than him.

575
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:11,038
- You okay?
- Yeah.

576
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:14,141
I'm just worried.

577
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:16,413
My, uh, folks are

578
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,460
traveling overseas.

579
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:20,380
- First time in Europe.
- Ah.

580
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,780
My mom was nervous.
I told her she'd be safe.

581
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:25,052
Now I can't get ahold of her.

582
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:28,188
The phones are probably down.

583
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:30,172
How about your family?

584
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,572
My parents died a long time ago.

585
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:36,092
Colin's mom, she...
She left when he was five.

586
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,612
Other than the occasional
birthday and Christmas call,

587
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,684
- we don't hear from her.
- I don't mean to pry.

588
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:43,996
No, it's okay.

589
00:39:44,956 --> 00:39:46,844
I'm the lucky one, I got Colin.

590
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:52,764
Colin... that's why you haven't
been in the field for 15 years.

591
00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:55,644
It's tough to trail after Bowles
when your kid's in kindergarten.

592
00:39:55,675 --> 00:39:57,532
I have no regrets.

593
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:59,931
Yeah, well, you're in the field now.

594
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:01,755
That I am.

595
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:06,204
Okay.

596
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:09,309
All right, look.

597
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,164
This is next, okay?

598
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:14,268
Okay, everyone?

599
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,277
- This is Libra.
- Another tidal wave?

600
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:18,844
No, that's a different zodiac sign.

601
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,989
It'll be a completely different event.

602
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:25,309
Each... each sign is associated
with an element, okay?

603
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,485
Scorpio is a water sign, tsunamis.

604
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:30,813
Aries is a fire sign.
That sure seems to make sense, right?

605
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:34,012
Right, Leo is also a fire sign...
Exploding meteors.

606
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:36,509
- Libra's air.
- Exactly.

607
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,492
Okay, so air...

608
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:39,485
a tornado?

609
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:42,780
No, the line is parallel to the ground.

610
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:45,661
- Heavy winds?
- Then what's that arch on top?

611
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:49,340
- A cloud?
- Meh.

612
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:51,420
Well, I don't know,
I'm lookin' at two lines in the dirt.

613
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,661
Look, there's a way to figure this out,
right?

614
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:56,380
The cuneiform in the cave

615
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,525
called the stone the shield.

616
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,148
Now I believe it has the
power to shield us.

617
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:02,652
Oh, wait.

618
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:04,284
- I've seen this before.
- What?

619
00:41:04,317 --> 00:41:06,876
In Iraq. Yeah, we found these tablets

620
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:07,996
with paintings of ancient
schematics on them.

621
00:41:08,027 --> 00:41:09,659
- Sophie.
- Here.

622
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:12,476
That was all over them.
This is what led us to Peru.

623
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,012
Looks like some kind of machine.

624
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:19,900
Wait, this is it.

625
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:22,748
This links the stone, Nibiru,
and the zodiac disasters all together.

626
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,740
This...

627
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:27,077
this is what we've been missing.

628
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:29,789
Wait.

629
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,581
There are only half the tablets here,
at best.

630
00:41:31,612 --> 00:41:33,755
Where are the rest?
Where would Bowles have kept them?

631
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:35,293
Okay...

632
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,436
anything of value that
we acquired with Bowles

633
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,844
would have been auctioned
off to fund other digs.

634
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,445
Auction, okay. Auctioned to whom?

635
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:42,525
There's a database listing,
if I can get online.

636
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:45,181
Great, we need to find a computer.
Let's go.

637
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:48,925
And a car.

638
00:41:57,981 --> 00:41:59,420
You guys hear that?

639
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:01,916
- It's a car.
- Ooh.

640
00:42:01,947 --> 00:42:03,708
Hey, come on! Hey!

641
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,501
- Stop!
- Stop!

642
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:08,092
- Hey!
- Stop!

643
00:42:09,115 --> 00:42:11,740
Look!

644
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,485
- Okay.
- You certainly made my job easier.

645
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:18,427
The stone. Now.

646
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,188
Look, just take it easy, all right?
We're on the same team.

647
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:22,523
- We just need to get online.
- We found the missing piece.

648
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:25,436
Tyler, with your help, look,
we can stop this, all right?

649
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:26,429
Come on, Tyler Stand down.

650
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,378
- Stand down!
- Tyler, just... God...

651
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:34,429
- Give me the stone.
- Tyler, this is insane.

652
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,253
Here.

653
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:38,396
Look, you can have it,

654
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:40,221
but take us with you, all right?

655
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,916
I need to speak to Woodward.

656
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,532
You want a ride? Try my truck you stole.

657
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:52,925
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

658
00:42:52,956 --> 00:42:54,940
- He can't just leave us.
- Just...

659
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,876
Get me Woodward.

660
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:22,748
I've got Agent Tyler for you, sir.

661
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,668
Put him through.

662
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:25,724
Mission accomplished.

663
00:43:25,755 --> 00:43:28,059
Tyler, do you have the stone?

664
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:31,195
Affirmative, sir.
Holding the canister as we speak.

665
00:43:31,228 --> 00:43:34,748
The canister? Ty... Tyler, Tyler,

666
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,476
say again, you have the canister?

667
00:43:36,509 --> 00:43:39,228
Tyler? Tyler, you looked inside right?

668
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,965
Tyler, tell me you looked inside.

669
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:49,788
Aah!

670
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,340
Tyler! Where'd he go?

671
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:58,619
Tyler!

672
00:43:58,652 --> 00:44:00,347
Tyler, say again. Tyler!

673
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,492
That was the stone.

674
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:12,028
Tyler.

675
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:13,436
Tyler.

676
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:15,581
What happened?

677
00:44:15,612 --> 00:44:18,045
Swing around.
Take me to his last coordinates.

678
00:44:18,076 --> 00:44:19,612
Go!

679
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,565
Oh, my God.

680
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,947
What happened?

681
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,271
They must have taken it
out of the canister.

682
00:44:37,853 --> 00:44:38,972
Colin, no. Don't...

683
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:42,204
Don't touch it.

684
00:44:42,235 --> 00:44:44,221
Okay, we need to find that canister.
Everyone...

685
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:45,757
look for it.

686
00:44:47,804 --> 00:44:50,268
It discharged.
Just like it did at the test field.

687
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,347
The stone and Nibiru react to each other.

688
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,811
The closer Nibiru gets,
the harsher these disasters.

689
00:44:54,844 --> 00:44:56,443
We need to find that canister.

690
00:45:09,947 --> 00:45:11,068
I got it!

691
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:19,228
Here.

692
00:45:20,956 --> 00:45:22,077
Careful.

693
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,820
Okay, come on.

694
00:45:45,851 --> 00:45:47,164
Let's go!

695
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:19,996
Let's keep moving.

696
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:31,197
We're almost there, sir.

697
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:37,340
What made the stone react?

698
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:39,420
I thought your experiment
did it the last time.

699
00:46:39,452 --> 00:46:41,371
We were powered down, the test was over.

700
00:46:41,403 --> 00:46:42,684
The stone erupted out of nowhere.

701
00:46:42,715 --> 00:46:45,501
Like I said before,
they must have opened up the canister.

702
00:46:45,532 --> 00:46:47,483
The lead seals it.
It would've kept them safe.

703
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:49,648
That's why they buried it in a lead mine.

704
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:55,548
What is that?

705
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:15,773
Run! Run! Come on! Run!

706
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:29,148
What the hell?

707
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,643
Holy, sweet mother.

708
00:47:39,675 --> 00:47:41,757
Um, let's not... Go, go, go!

709
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:58,204
Holy...

710
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,181
What in the hell is that?!

711
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:35,900
Hey!

712
00:48:39,996 --> 00:48:41,916
- Look, come on!
- Come here!

713
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:48,699
Get in, get in, get in, get in!

714
00:49:16,572 --> 00:49:18,619
My name's Marty.

715
00:49:18,652 --> 00:49:20,157
Come on in, stay a while.

716
00:49:20,188 --> 00:49:23,036
Thank you. Thank you.

717
00:49:23,068 --> 00:49:25,838
What's the fun in havin'
a bunker if you can't share?

718
00:49:26,907 --> 00:49:28,027
Ah.

719
00:49:32,092 --> 00:49:33,659
Okay.

720
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,869
Come on.

721
00:49:37,085 --> 00:49:39,324
Ah, thanks. Do be careful of the first step

722
00:49:39,356 --> 00:49:40,731
it can be precarious.

723
00:49:40,762 --> 00:49:43,228
And the third. Uh-huh.

724
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,820
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm. Anytime.

725
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,956
Welcome to my pride and joy.

726
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,340
- What is this place?
- Abandoned munitions storage.

727
00:50:01,371 --> 00:50:03,965
Until I invoked the native rule.

728
00:50:03,996 --> 00:50:07,036
- And what's that?
- Any government land not used

729
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:10,396
in 20 years automatically reverts back
to the original holder of the deed,

730
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:13,019
in this case... me.

731
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,429
Okay.

732
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:19,197
This is the last line of defense, man.

733
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:23,835
Independent power grid, recycled water,

734
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:27,195
two years' food supply,
and a whole lot of beer.

735
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:29,755
Some people call it a hideout.

736
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:32,699
I call it Suzanne.

737
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:34,076
Pretty sweet, huh?

738
00:50:34,108 --> 00:50:37,083
- First sign of a banjo, I'm outta here.
- I'm right behind ya.

739
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:38,447
Um, why did you build it?

740
00:50:40,411 --> 00:50:41,692
You kidding me, right?

741
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,923
Hey, we got lucky with Y2K and 9/11.

742
00:50:48,956 --> 00:50:51,005
But World War III

743
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:52,795
and the antichrist...

744
00:50:52,827 --> 00:50:54,532
These things are happening, man.

745
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,811
And the only thing about it...

746
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:08,188
- Marty?
- Huh?

747
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:09,724
The antichrist?

748
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,443
No, kid.

749
00:51:12,474 --> 00:51:15,228
That's old news. Don't
get mixed up in that.

750
00:51:16,188 --> 00:51:17,307
Mayans.

751
00:51:18,586 --> 00:51:20,539
That's the thing. 2012.

752
00:51:20,572 --> 00:51:23,420
- It's 2014.
- Any day now.

753
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:26,436
So, Marty, how long you been down here?

754
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:29,019
Boom.

755
00:51:33,244 --> 00:51:34,844
That's the proof.

756
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:39,132
And who's ready for it?
Marty friggin' Fitzgerald, that's who.

757
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:41,275
Me, that's me.

758
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:45,275
Now I don't know if we'll ever
actually land on the moon,

759
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:48,123
or if we'll ever expose
reptiles in the royal family,

760
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:52,603
but what I do know is that
the Anunnaki are coming, man.

761
00:51:52,635 --> 00:51:54,940
- dNibiru.
- What?

762
00:51:54,972 --> 00:51:57,244
d Nibiru.

763
00:51:57,275 --> 00:51:59,291
How do you know about Nibiru?

764
00:52:00,347 --> 00:52:01,949
Oh, it's on the wire, man.

765
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,125
Ninth planet.

766
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,068
Does this work?

767
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:09,467
Oh, yeah, it works.

768
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,251
Everything works. Solar powered.

769
00:52:12,284 --> 00:52:14,364
Internet via satellite. There's no wires,

770
00:52:14,396 --> 00:52:16,188
- there's none of that bull...
- So you're actually online?

771
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:17,851
Is Picasso a Freemason?

772
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,059
- May I?
- Yes, please.

773
00:52:23,643 --> 00:52:25,340
Wait a minute.

774
00:52:25,371 --> 00:52:29,179
- Are all these recent?
- Yeah, those are, yeah.

775
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:32,668
This was Southeast Asia two weeks ago.

776
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:35,291
That is Eastern Europe six days later.

777
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:38,268
That's four days after that and
this was the day before yesterday.

778
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,219
Oh, my God.

779
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:42,235
I thought Capricorn was
first. Then after Libra

780
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:44,572
there was seven signs left,
but this has been...

781
00:52:44,603 --> 00:52:46,492
- this has been happening for weeks.
- Oh, yeah.

782
00:52:46,523 --> 00:52:48,411
The news has just been writing
it off as natural events.

783
00:52:48,443 --> 00:52:50,588
I'm so lost.

784
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:52,123
When Nibiru appeared, the disasters began.

785
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:54,588
That's why half the signs in the cave
were already turned when we got there.

786
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:56,284
Scorpio turned right in front of our eyes.

787
00:52:56,315 --> 00:52:57,659
Just as the disasters were beginning.

788
00:52:57,692 --> 00:52:59,324
Marty...

789
00:52:59,356 --> 00:53:01,980
you're a genius.

790
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,317
I been sayin' that for years.

791
00:53:24,186 --> 00:53:25,659
Back to the Dark Ages.

792
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:32,668
Planet's been ripped apart piece by piece.

793
00:53:35,675 --> 00:53:38,331
Last nail in the coffin is that stone.

794
00:53:41,403 --> 00:53:43,164
I gotta get it back.

795
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:49,244
Let's go.

796
00:54:03,036 --> 00:54:06,588
There's Taurus, Aquarius, Pisces, Virgo,

797
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,635
Gemini, Capricorn, Leo,

798
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:11,771
Scorpio and Aries, the lava shoots.

799
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,851
And thanks to Marty, we
just survived Libra.

800
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,931
That's 10 in total.

801
00:54:15,963 --> 00:54:18,364
There aren't seven signs left,
there are only two.

802
00:54:18,396 --> 00:54:19,963
Cancer and Sagittarius.

803
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,731
Right, so that's the entire zodiac.

804
00:54:24,764 --> 00:54:27,003
- Then what?
- The apocalypse.

805
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:31,835
Here.
We need to figure out what these two mean.

806
00:54:34,492 --> 00:54:35,771
Well, you heard the man,

807
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:38,364
let's put our heads
together and get Cancer.

808
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:42,969
You really have a way with words there,
Marty.

809
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,275
You, too.

810
00:54:45,307 --> 00:54:47,132
No. Dueling cyclones,

811
00:54:47,163 --> 00:54:49,242
which seems like the most obvious guess,
right?

812
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:50,844
Wait, but Cancer

813
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:53,596
is a water sign, so... whirlpools?

814
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,835
- Maybe, we should be safe on land.
- Got it.

815
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:58,588
The tablets were sold to
a business in Davenport.

816
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:00,219
It's only about 90 miles away.

817
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:03,097
Well, that's a long way to hitchhike.

818
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,204
You guys wanna use my car?

819
00:55:09,467 --> 00:55:12,795
My cousin Chantelle tried
to get me into this huge RV,

820
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:15,996
but ever since my operation,
I can't drive a stick.

821
00:55:20,858 --> 00:55:23,099
Marty...

822
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:25,307
- you're a Godsend.
- Well, before you say that,

823
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,771
the gas mileage is total crap.

824
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:29,373
But you got a full tank.

825
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,059
Take care of her.

826
00:55:33,402 --> 00:55:34,715
I will.

827
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:37,724
And... thank you.

828
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:40,476
For what?

829
00:55:43,068 --> 00:55:44,155
For believing.

830
00:55:45,114 --> 00:55:47,451
All right.

831
00:55:47,483 --> 00:55:48,603
All right.

832
00:55:54,204 --> 00:55:56,507
Yeah, you get outta here.
Go, go. Get outta here.

833
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:58,523
I'll go.

834
00:56:02,394 --> 00:56:04,603
Go save the world.

835
00:56:20,402 --> 00:56:22,427
Kinda takin' the slow road, aren't you?

836
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:25,307
Cancer's a water sign,
I want to stay away from the water.

837
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:26,523
On higher ground.

838
00:56:31,643 --> 00:56:34,108
What in the...

839
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:35,516
Look at that.

840
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,228
Dad?

841
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,083
Dad?

842
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:50,621
Oh, my God!

843
00:56:58,074 --> 00:56:59,387
Hold on!

844
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,012
Be careful, Dad. Be careful!

845
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,643
- Dad!
- It's okay.

846
00:57:06,106 --> 00:57:07,708
Oh, my God!

847
00:57:19,547 --> 00:57:20,603
Faster!

848
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:23,963
I'm trying to! Hold on, everyone!

849
00:57:35,643 --> 00:57:37,115
Come on!

850
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:41,659
Go, go, go! Gotta get out of here!

851
00:57:45,722 --> 00:57:47,771
- It's coming!
- It's coming!

852
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:48,956
Go!

853
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:58,748
Get out! Get out! Get out!

854
00:57:58,778 --> 00:58:00,731
Go, go! Come on! Come on!

855
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,684
Where we going?!

856
00:58:11,963 --> 00:58:13,083
Come on!

857
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:22,108
The stone!

858
00:58:24,155 --> 00:58:25,563
Kathryn, no!

859
00:58:36,922 --> 00:58:38,172
Grab it!

860
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:52,411
Hold on!

861
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:07,483
No!

862
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,523
We have base on the com for you, sir.

863
00:59:26,556 --> 00:59:28,411
- Go.
- Kathryn Keen's login

864
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,778
was used to access the Polydynamics server.

865
00:59:30,811 --> 00:59:32,572
- What did she access?
- Only one file.

866
00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:34,523
A shipping receipt going from Polydynamics

867
00:59:34,554 --> 00:59:36,027
to an address in Davenport.

868
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:39,260
- What was shipped?
- They were crates. Artifacts from Iraq.

869
00:59:40,282 --> 00:59:42,139
Gotcha. Let's go.

870
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:51,898
Thought it was supposed to be a water sign.

871
00:59:51,931 --> 00:59:54,300
- It is a water sign.
- It came out of the sky!

872
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:55,898
Yeah, after it came out of the water.

873
00:59:55,931 --> 00:59:57,179
Well,
how are we supposed to predict these things

874
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,420
if these elements keep changing
from one thing to another?

875
00:59:59,452 --> 01:00:00,764
It was a water sign.

876
01:00:00,795 --> 01:00:03,195
- Just like Sagittarius is a fire sign.
- Sagittarius is an arrow.

877
01:00:03,226 --> 01:00:04,411
- It could be anything.
- Dad, come on, help me.

878
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:06,041
Just stop! Both of you, just...

879
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:08,987
stop.

880
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:11,842
- We're just trying to help.
- Yeah, well, so was I...

881
01:00:12,284 --> 01:00:13,563
and now Kathryn...

882
01:00:17,722 --> 01:00:19,641
- You weren't wrong.
- Colin, just...

883
01:00:21,532 --> 01:00:23,130
- You weren't wrong.
- Colin...

884
01:00:24,507 --> 01:00:26,492
Kathryn's dead because of a disaster,
not because...

885
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:28,219
You don't understand.

886
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:30,204
I can't protect you, Colin.

887
01:00:33,786 --> 01:00:36,443
This is it. We're here.

888
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:41,467
S.C. Engineering?

889
01:00:41,498 --> 01:00:43,612
You gotta be... you gotta be kidding me.

890
01:00:44,762 --> 01:00:47,003
This is one of Harry Setag's companies.

891
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,452
Who's Harry Setag?

892
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:53,211
His hero.

893
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:01,436
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

894
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:31,771
S.C. Engineering has
one of the most advanced

895
01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:34,523
biometric security systems in the world.

896
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:44,186
Nice job, son.

897
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:51,579
Hello?

898
01:02:02,746 --> 01:02:04,635
- Hello?
- What was that?

899
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:07,483
- Bye.
- I don't know. It's up there.

900
01:02:07,514 --> 01:02:09,403
Come on.

901
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:12,027
Hello...

902
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:13,851
scotch.

903
01:02:50,842 --> 01:02:52,987
Uh, hello...

904
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:54,556
people.

905
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,539
You're...

906
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:01,978
you're...

907
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,251
- you're Harry Setag.
- Am I?

908
01:03:04,282 --> 01:03:06,300
That I am.

909
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,731
Uh...

910
01:03:08,762 --> 01:03:10,396
drink?

911
01:03:11,802 --> 01:03:13,914
- I...
- His name is Colin.

912
01:03:13,947 --> 01:03:17,788
My name is Neil Ryan and this is Sophie.

913
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:19,867
I heard somewhere you didn't drink.

914
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:22,556
I don't?!

915
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:28,858
But this 70-year-old single malt...

916
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:31,675
best sex you'll ever have.

917
01:03:31,706 --> 01:03:33,820
I'm told.

918
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:37,722
- Cigar?
- No.

919
01:03:37,755 --> 01:03:40,572
No, we're... We're fine, but thank you.

920
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:43,163
Mr. Setag,
we're looking for some Sumerian tablets

921
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,179
that you bought from Polydynamics.

922
01:03:47,643 --> 01:03:49,594
- Show yourself to the door!
- What?

923
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:55,835
And tell that bastard
Woodward he's not getting

924
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:58,204
- one damn thing from me. Ever!
- Wait, no.

925
01:03:58,235 --> 01:03:59,579
- No, no, no, look.
- That's a fact.

926
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,563
We don't work for Woodward.

927
01:04:01,594 --> 01:04:02,876
Really?

928
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:07,931
Please, Mr. Setag.
The tablets that you bought,

929
01:04:07,963 --> 01:04:10,840
they may contain information
that could save the world.

930
01:04:11,483 --> 01:04:12,827
Well...

931
01:04:16,123 --> 01:04:17,882
knock yourself out.

932
01:04:20,282 --> 01:04:24,572
As far as saving the world goes,

933
01:04:24,603 --> 01:04:26,010
you're a little late.

934
01:04:26,043 --> 01:04:27,675
- What is that?
- Wait a second.

935
01:04:27,706 --> 01:04:31,003
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

936
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,490
You know?

937
01:04:34,523 --> 01:04:37,884
When I came by my first billion,

938
01:04:39,483 --> 01:04:41,244
I started to wonder.

939
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:46,108
If I could do anything I want...

940
01:04:47,802 --> 01:04:49,563
what is it I wanna do?

941
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:54,331
I invested in promising
avenues of discovery,

942
01:04:54,362 --> 01:04:56,507
but the richest opportunities

943
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:59,963
often lie where others
have given up looking!

944
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,322
To the creative mind...

945
01:05:03,355 --> 01:05:05,403
There are no dead ends.

946
01:05:06,682 --> 01:05:08,507
You read my book.

947
01:05:10,266 --> 01:05:12,827
Why...

948
01:05:12,858 --> 01:05:14,268
have a cigar.

949
01:05:16,347 --> 01:05:17,947
I've read all your books.

950
01:05:17,978 --> 01:05:19,771
I have, too.

951
01:05:19,802 --> 01:05:21,724
This machine, the scale of it.

952
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:25,050
- We can't build it.
- But we have to at least try.

953
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:28,539
Even if we had the entire Army
Corps of Engineers, we wouldn't...

954
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:31,130
It would take years, Sophie.

955
01:05:31,163 --> 01:05:32,731
Uh, 18 months.

956
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:36,731
- What?
- It took us a year and a half

957
01:05:36,762 --> 01:05:39,034
to make that damn machine.

958
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:40,155
What? You... you built this?

959
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,884
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, what?

960
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:44,699
Gave my accountant a heart attack.

961
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:48,474
You funded Polydynamics.

962
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:50,619
Eh, it doesn't make any difference.

963
01:05:52,603 --> 01:05:54,811
The machine is useless without the stone.

964
01:05:54,842 --> 01:05:56,315
Mr. Setag.

965
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:09,242
You actually found it.

966
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:15,259
There are no dead ends.

967
01:06:21,722 --> 01:06:23,771
Aah!

968
01:06:25,146 --> 01:06:27,387
To the car! Come on, get out of here.

969
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:28,923
Colin, let's go! Come on!

970
01:06:30,681 --> 01:06:32,603
Open the door!

971
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,528
Put it back in my backpack.

972
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:41,882
Here, here! Take this one.

973
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,451
- Put pressure on it.
- It's okay.

974
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:45,818
Get downstairs, cover the other exits!

975
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:47,963
- Open the door!
- Is there another way out of here?

976
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:51,418
By the staircase on your way to the lodge.

977
01:06:51,449 --> 01:06:53,498
- Dad, you're shot!
- On three, come on.

978
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,699
- Help me!
- No, no, no, no. Absolutely not.

979
01:06:56,731 --> 01:06:59,771
One thing I've learned
in my career is to know

980
01:06:59,802 --> 01:07:01,914
who's an asset and who's a liability.

981
01:07:03,418 --> 01:07:05,179
You need to get to the machine.

982
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,811
Go.

983
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:11,322
Drive it to Mt. Franklin. Go!

984
01:07:11,353 --> 01:07:13,179
- Go!
- Let's go, let's go!

985
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:15,483
Colin, here!

986
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,492
Go. Save the world!

987
01:07:18,523 --> 01:07:20,572
Thanks.

988
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,338
Damn it!

989
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:48,891
Hello, Harry.

990
01:07:49,851 --> 01:07:51,322
Woodward.

991
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:56,411
- Okay.
- Hold still.

992
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:57,659
Eyes on the road, all right?

993
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,387
I'm sorry,
I've never seen my dad get shot before.

994
01:07:59,418 --> 01:08:01,083
So how does this machine even work?

995
01:08:01,114 --> 01:08:03,514
- It's a shield.
- A shield? A shield from what?

996
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:04,827
- Sagittarius?
- Yes.

997
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:07,226
According to Setag's tablet,
it's comin' from the sun.

998
01:08:07,259 --> 01:08:08,923
It's a solar eruption.

999
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,139
I need that stone.

1000
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,427
I would...

1001
01:08:19,673 --> 01:08:22,234
no, actually, I wouldn't.

1002
01:08:23,865 --> 01:08:25,755
Okay!

1003
01:08:25,786 --> 01:08:27,643
Aah!

1004
01:08:38,203 --> 01:08:41,020
Hand me... that bottle.

1005
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:44,859
The Bordeaux.

1006
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:50,939
See, I know you don't have it.

1007
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,859
I know that Neil has it.

1008
01:08:52,890 --> 01:08:54,939
What I need from you...

1009
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:58,171
- Where's Neil?
- I don't... I don't know.

1010
01:08:59,194 --> 01:09:01,051
He left.

1011
01:09:01,082 --> 01:09:02,875
Went for a stroll.

1012
01:09:05,435 --> 01:09:06,684
Okay!

1013
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,076
Give me that.

1014
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:14,682
What is this?

1015
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:18,555
- Blueprints.
- I know it's a blueprint!

1016
01:09:23,194 --> 01:09:24,859
What...

1017
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:26,490
is it a blueprint of?

1018
01:09:26,521 --> 01:09:29,211
A machine built by...

1019
01:09:29,242 --> 01:09:31,802
a primitive civilization

1020
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:36,154
that shouldn't have even had
the knowledge to make it.

1021
01:09:37,498 --> 01:09:40,795
You built a 10,000-year-old weapon

1022
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:42,842
powered by that stone,

1023
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:45,146
and you just sent Neil out

1024
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:46,458
to go turn it on?

1025
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:50,298
No, what you should be asking

1026
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:53,722
is how did they access the materials?

1027
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,875
How did they even know

1028
01:09:58,905 --> 01:10:02,682
the power of that stone?

1029
01:10:02,715 --> 01:10:05,787
How did they know

1030
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:07,930
that it had to be built

1031
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:10,970
in a lead deposit?

1032
01:10:12,922 --> 01:10:14,810
- How did th...
- Lead...

1033
01:10:14,842 --> 01:10:15,804
Huh?

1034
01:10:16,762 --> 01:10:18,235
...deposit.

1035
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,051
Harry, Harry.

1036
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:25,371
What lead deposit?

1037
01:10:30,618 --> 01:10:31,643
Do you hear that?

1038
01:10:36,283 --> 01:10:38,011
It's Woodward! Go!

1039
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:40,600
Nice and low. Get right on 'em.
Get right on 'em!

1040
01:10:49,082 --> 01:10:50,747
Keep up, keep up, keep up!

1041
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:54,747
Stay with 'em. Stay with 'em!
Stay with 'em!

1042
01:10:54,779 --> 01:10:56,570
Colin!

1043
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:57,787
Plea... oh, sh...

1044
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,827
Get right down on 'em!

1045
01:11:00,858 --> 01:11:02,458
Get moving.

1046
01:11:11,162 --> 01:11:12,827
Come on, go!

1047
01:11:12,859 --> 01:11:14,587
- Be careful.
- He's closing in!

1048
01:11:16,358 --> 01:11:17,850
Stay with 'em. Stay with 'em.

1049
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:18,908
Stay with 'em.

1050
01:11:24,027 --> 01:11:25,519
All right, down, down, down.

1051
01:11:29,913 --> 01:11:31,515
Go! Just go, Colin!

1052
01:11:34,362 --> 01:11:36,122
- Colin!
- Go!

1053
01:11:37,819 --> 01:11:39,150
Where the hell'd they go?

1054
01:11:48,506 --> 01:11:50,957
They got nowhere to go.
They got nowhere to go.

1055
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:56,411
Look out!

1056
01:11:58,426 --> 01:11:59,515
Now I gotcha.

1057
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:01,882
- Colin, it's a dead end!
- There are no dead ends.

1058
01:12:01,914 --> 01:12:03,643
What?!

1059
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:08,774
Where'd they go? Where the hell'd they go?!

1060
01:12:08,795 --> 01:12:11,835
Where the hell did...
They just disappeared!

1061
01:12:11,867 --> 01:12:13,243
Circle around!

1062
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:24,219
Great Scott!

1063
01:12:26,363 --> 01:12:29,914
It worked.

1064
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,411
One of Harry Setag's first inventions.

1065
01:12:32,443 --> 01:12:33,914
Holograms.

1066
01:12:36,283 --> 01:12:39,867
I think I just crapped
my third grade homework.

1067
01:12:44,378 --> 01:12:47,386
They went right into that mountain.
Where the hell did they go?

1068
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:49,530
Take us down.

1069
01:12:49,563 --> 01:12:51,162
Take us down now!

1070
01:12:55,002 --> 01:12:56,283
Come on.

1071
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:30,203
He really built it.

1072
01:13:56,282 --> 01:13:57,690
Okay.

1073
01:13:57,722 --> 01:13:59,673
Unbelievable.

1074
01:13:59,706 --> 01:14:01,627
This is where the stone goes.

1075
01:14:01,658 --> 01:14:03,386
Okay, how do we get it open?

1076
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:05,242
Okay, we gotta...

1077
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:06,712
Put everything in sequence.

1078
01:14:12,442 --> 01:14:14,331
- Watch out!
- Go fast

1079
01:14:35,323 --> 01:14:37,658
All right, get the machine open.

1080
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:39,291
I'll get the stone.

1081
01:14:51,546 --> 01:14:53,242
Uh... okay, uh...

1082
01:14:53,274 --> 01:14:54,905
No, wait, don't. It has to be in sequence.

1083
01:14:54,938 --> 01:14:57,306
Sagittarius is last.

1084
01:14:57,337 --> 01:14:59,962
Taurus. Taurus is first.

1085
01:14:59,993 --> 01:15:02,618
- Uh, okay.
- Um...

1086
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:04,059
Wait a second.

1087
01:15:14,105 --> 01:15:16,890
- Okay.
- Taurus...

1088
01:15:16,921 --> 01:15:19,194
- Uh...
- Aquarius.

1089
01:15:19,226 --> 01:15:20,859
Yeah.

1090
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:31,643
Ugh!

1091
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:44,475
- Uh, Pi... Pisces!
- Pisces.

1092
01:15:50,265 --> 01:15:51,962
Uh... uh, Virgo!

1093
01:15:55,641 --> 01:15:57,850
- Virgo, uh...
- Um...

1094
01:15:57,882 --> 01:15:59,643
- Gemini!
- Yeah.

1095
01:16:22,618 --> 01:16:23,802
Aah!

1096
01:16:34,363 --> 01:16:36,122
Capricorn.

1097
01:16:38,362 --> 01:16:40,635
Uh, a little help here.

1098
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,203
- Little help.
- Okay.

1099
01:16:43,417 --> 01:16:45,818
Okay.

1100
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:48,506
Okay, okay, let me think. Um...

1101
01:16:49,881 --> 01:16:52,251
Uh, I can't remember what's next.

1102
01:17:23,002 --> 01:17:24,954
- Scorpio.
- Yes.

1103
01:17:26,203 --> 01:17:28,314
Aries.

1104
01:17:39,643 --> 01:17:41,819
Cancer.

1105
01:17:46,073 --> 01:17:47,865
Good. Good.

1106
01:17:47,898 --> 01:17:49,914
Okay.

1107
01:17:54,426 --> 01:17:55,835
Sagittarius.

1108
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,618
We did it!

1109
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,475
Now all we need is the stone.

1110
01:18:41,561 --> 01:18:42,715
Here!

1111
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,274
Okay.

1112
01:19:07,162 --> 01:19:09,146
Go. Go! Get out of here! Go!

1113
01:19:15,097 --> 01:19:17,979
Go. Go! Run! Run!

1114
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:20,378
We gotta get outta here. Run!

1115
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:26,042
Go, go, go! Come on!

1116
01:19:26,073 --> 01:19:27,899
Dad, you drive!

1117
01:20:11,578 --> 01:20:12,890
Oh, my God.

1118
01:20:21,881 --> 01:20:23,483
Aah!

1119
01:21:07,386 --> 01:21:08,859
Go, go, go, go!

1120
01:21:18,265 --> 01:21:19,867
That's good, right?

1121
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:43,610
You did it.
