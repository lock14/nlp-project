1
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:30,735
Where's Jay?

2
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,451
How long were those potatoes
under the fire? How'd you do that?

3
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,507
- Somebody will see!
- No way.

4
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:02,350
- Does Maryann kiss as good as I do?
- How would I know?

5
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:20,451
- You said we were special.
- I meant everything.

6
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:10,043
- That's not allowed.
- Come on.

7
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:20,011
Come on. A man is not made out of stone.

8
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,933
Somebody's there!

9
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:39,030
We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing a...

10
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:52,001
Please, don't!

11
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:05,139
No!

12
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,902
Hi, girl. Excuse me! Hi, boy.

13
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:26,614
You speak English?
How far is it to Camp Crystal Lake?

14
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:31,661
That far?
Okey-dokey. See you later.

15
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:44,616
<i>It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June.</i>

16
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:49,495
<i>This is Big Dave and it's time for you
lazybones to get out of bed.</i>

17
00:07:49,662 --> 00:07:53,208
<i>It's black-cat day in Crystal Lake.</i>

18
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,468
<i>I must have seen that Kojak 82 times.</i>

19
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:06,637
Excuse me. How far
is Camp Crystal Lake from here?

20
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:15,896
What is it, Enos? About 20 miles?

21
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,023
- About that.
- Camp Blood?

22
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,152
- They're opening that place again?
- Lots of luck.

23
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,447
- Can I get a bus or something?
- Not likely.

24
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:30,911
You going out to the crossroads, Enos?
What about a lift? That would be halfway.

25
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:34,581
No sweat, Trudy. Okay, kid, let's move it.

26
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:39,336
- Name's Annie.
- All right, Annie, let's go.

27
00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,929
All the girls up there
gonna look as good as you?

28
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,139
I don't know.

29
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:56,228
- You're going to Camp Blood, ain't you?
- Goddamn it, Ralph, get out of here!

30
00:08:56,395 --> 00:08:59,522
- Leave people alone!
- You'll never come back!

31
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,774
Oh, shut up, Ralph!

32
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:06,070
It's got a death curse!

33
00:09:08,072 --> 00:09:11,033
He's a real prophet of doom, ain't he?

34
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:13,035
Climb up, miss.

35
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:36,684
He's causing problems enough
for your boss with all that talk.

36
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,813
Goddamn nuisance.

37
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:07,881
- He tell you anything?
- Who?

38
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,675
Your boss. Steve Christy.

39
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:14,679
I'll be cooking for 50 kids and 10 staff.

40
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:20,352
- Campers will mostly be inner-city children.
- No, I mean about what happened.

41
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:25,106
No.

42
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:33,031
Come on. There's something
you're not telling me.

43
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:40,579
- Quit. Quit now.
- Quit? Why would I want to quit?

44
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,874
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed!

45
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:48,504
Terrific. Not you too. You sound
like your crazy friend back there.

46
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:53,592
Well, maybe. Did Christy tell you about
the two kids murdered in '58?

47
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:59,306
Boy drowning in '57? A bunch of fires?

48
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:01,642
Nobody knows who did any of them.

49
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:06,522
In 1962, they were going to open up.
The water was bad.

50
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,900
Christy will end up like his folks:
Crazy and broke.

51
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:14,989
He's been up there a year fixing up that
place. Must have dropped $25,000.

52
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:19,034
And for what? Ask anybody.

53
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:23,247
- Quit!
- I can't.

54
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:27,126
Dumb kids. Know-it-alls.

55
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:30,837
Just like my nieces. Heads full of rocks.

56
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:36,759
- You're an American original.
- I'm an American original.

57
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:42,181
- Dumb kid.
- At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.

58
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:06,831
- Take care of yourself.
- No sweat. Thanks for the lift.

59
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,076
Hey, Marcie. You really think
there'll be other gorgeous women...

60
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:47,329
...at Camp Crystal Lake besides yourself?

61
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:51,833
- Is sex all you ever think about, Ned?
- Hey, no. No. Absolutely not.

62
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,045
Sometimes I just think about
kissing women.

63
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,735
- You wanna give me a hand over here?
- Sure.

64
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:04,613
Alice! I wanna get this tree stump out.

65
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,366
Get on this side, you pull
on that side. Alice!

66
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:09,826
Coming.

67
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,583
- That's great. I'm Steve Christy.
- Jack.

68
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,293
- Marcie
- Ned Rubinstein.

69
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,171
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
This is Alice.

70
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:23,590
Hi. Steve, Cabin B is all ready.

71
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:28,345
- Where's Bill? Cleaning out the boathouse?
- Haven't seen him in half an hour.

72
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:31,014
I wanted him to start painting. Brenda?

73
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:35,810
- Setting up the archery range.
- I'd rather she paint. Come on. Let's go.

74
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:38,021
I thought we had two weeks.

75
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:41,399
Come on. I'll show you
where you can get changed.

76
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:54,119
- Here, let me give you a hand with that.
- Thank you.

77
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,005
You got it?

78
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:28,320
You draw very well.

79
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:33,200
Thanks. I wish I had more time to do it.

80
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,035
Oh, dummy.

81
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,582
- When did you do this?
- Last night.

82
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,919
- Do I really look like that?
- You did last night.

83
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:52,719
You're very talented.

84
00:15:54,846 --> 00:15:57,140
You're very pretty.

85
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:02,020
This really isn't your cup of tea, is it?

86
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:05,023
Any particular reason?

87
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,360
It's just a problem I have.
It's nothing personal.

88
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:14,741
- You wanna leave?
- I don't know. I may have to...

89
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:17,911
...go back to California
to straighten something out.

90
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,375
Come on. Give me another chance.

91
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:28,713
Stay a week.
Help get the place ready.

92
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:34,302
By Friday, if you're not happy,
I'll put you on the bus myself.

93
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,556
All right. Friday. I'll give it a week.

94
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,232
Thanks, Alice.

95
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:05,916
Bill? Steve wants to know
if we need more paint.

96
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,670
- Paint's all right. Need more thinner.
- Okay.

97
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:14,842
- Alice. Did the others show up?
- Yeah, everybody except that girl Annie.

98
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:20,013
- Think you're gonna last all summer?
- I don't know if I'm gonna last all week.

99
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,766
- I'll tell Steve about the thinner.
- Fine.

100
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,783
- You want it listed separately?
- Right.

101
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,828
Brenda, I want you to
finish the archery range.

102
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:48,291
If Annie gets here, get her started
in the kitchen. Do your best.

103
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,668
I'll be back sometime after lunch.

104
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:55,590
It's supposed to rain like hell,
so get as much done as possible.

105
00:18:01,304 --> 00:18:06,142
He neglected to mention that downtown
they call this place "Camp Blood."

106
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:11,022
Next there'll be snakes in the
outhouse and crocodiles in the lake.

107
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:14,275
No, the crocodiles are in the cabins.

108
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:43,929
Are you crazy?

109
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:48,266
Wanna see my trick shot?
It's even better.

110
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:52,437
I don't believe you!

111
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:58,360
You know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.

112
00:18:58,527 --> 00:18:59,569
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

113
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:03,615
You come to help me or scare
me to death? You do that again...

114
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:07,701
...I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
- I love that sexy talk!

115
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:35,938
Hi. I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.

116
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:52,913
Guess I always wanted to
work with children.

117
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,251
I hate when people call them "kids."
Sounds like little goats.

118
00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:01,838
But when you've had a dream
as long as I have, you'll do anything.

119
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,614
Hey, wasn't that the road for
Camp Crystal Lake back there?

120
00:20:32,744 --> 00:20:35,121
I think we better stop.

121
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:39,459
Please?

122
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:46,049
Stop, please! Please! Stop!

123
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,967
Please, stop!

124
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:15,636
No. No.

125
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:18,890
No.

126
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:35,071
All right, move it out. A little to the left.
Little to the left.

127
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:44,915
Move it out. Move it out. Okay,
little to the left. Now... No, no.

128
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:49,503
Let's go. Okay. Okay. Good. Good.

129
00:23:01,598 --> 00:23:05,227
If you were a flavor of ice cream,
what would it be?

130
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:09,356
- Rocky Road.
- Hey!

131
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:25,412
What's that vitamin C
stuff do for you, anyway?

132
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:29,792
Vitamin C is supposed to neutralize
the nitrates or something.

133
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:34,129
What's the matter?
Do you see something?

134
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,468
No. Nothing.

135
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:47,101
Ned! Get out of here!

136
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,487
Hey, you guys.
Ready to go back to work?

137
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,280
Yeah.

138
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:06,203
- Come on, Alice.
- Help! Help!

139
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:11,667
- Something's wrong with Ned.
- Get a life preserver!

140
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:30,518
- Can he swim?
- I don't know.

141
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:33,521
- He's right around here somewhere.
- I got it.

142
00:24:33,688 --> 00:24:36,107
Go ahead, dive for him.

143
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:39,944
- There he is!
- Come on. Help me.

144
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,071
Watch his head.

145
00:24:48,203 --> 00:24:51,206
- Watch his head!
- Got him?

146
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:01,049
- Can you give mouth-to-mouth?
- Yeah.

147
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:08,889
- Oh, God.
- Come on, Ned.

148
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:12,142
- Oh, Neddy!
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

149
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:22,236
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

150
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:56,602
Bill!

151
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:01,440
Bill, come here, quick! Hurry!

152
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:08,865
- What is it?
- There's a snake over there.

153
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:10,783
Where?

154
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:20,626
- What do I do?
- Kill it.

155
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:22,170
It might bite.

156
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,132
- Haven't you ever been in the woods?
- We're not in the woods.

157
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,467
- Bill, what are you doing?
- There's a snake.

158
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:31,137
- Why are we in here?
- Feet don't fail me now!

159
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:33,222
- There it is!
- Oh, God!

160
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:39,228
- I can't sleep with a snake in here.
- Nobody said anything about snakes.

161
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:43,232
- Kill it!
- I can't get it until it comes out.

162
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,484
- Well, call him!
- How do you call a snake?

163
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,528
I'll flush him!

164
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:56,161
- I got it.
- Where?

165
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:57,496
Look out!

166
00:26:57,662 --> 00:26:58,997
I got him!

167
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,711
Oh, God.

168
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,343
Is it dead?

169
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,971
Either that or it's got a very short clone.

170
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:20,894
- Well, at least we know what's for dinner.
- Marcie!

171
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:28,318
I'm making salad. Want me
to make some for everybody?

172
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:32,030
- That would be great. There's hamburger...
- None for me.

173
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,616
There are apples.
Know how to make apple pie?

174
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:38,619
- Sure. No sweat.
- What is going on?

175
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:49,964
Oh, shit.

176
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:55,886
- Who are you people?
- Camp counselors. Ned is fooling around.

177
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:57,930
- Right, just...
- Can it, Cochise.

178
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:00,516
Steve Christy hire you people?
He pay you for this?

179
00:28:00,683 --> 00:28:02,893
- Nice bike.
- You been smoking, boy?

180
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,729
Smoking? Don't smoke. Causes cancer.

181
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:11,151
You just get off a spaceship or something?
Colombian gold. Grass. Hash. The weed.

182
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:13,404
- What's he talking about?
- Don't get smart.

183
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:18,159
- Me? I'm as dumb as they come.
- Not another word out of you, understand?

184
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:21,954
Nothing's going on here.
We're getting the place in shape.

185
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:23,164
For what?

186
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,958
- Is there anything we can do to help?
- I'm looking for somebody.

187
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:31,045
- Who's that?
- A guy named Ralph. The town crazy.

188
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:34,007
There's no crazy people around here.

189
00:28:34,174 --> 00:28:39,304
I told you to sit on it, Tonto. I got word
Ralph was pedaling out this way...

190
00:28:39,512 --> 00:28:42,765
...spouting his gospel.
- We haven't seen anybody here.

191
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:45,935
- Just us.
- This guy Ralph. Is he dangerous?

192
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:49,272
Every time that loony gets drunk,
he gets his calling.

193
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:53,067
I spend the morning in court,
he gets a week in jail.

194
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:57,447
<i>Cycle Two, where are you?
Come in, Cycle Two.</i>

195
00:28:57,614 --> 00:29:01,117
This is Dorf. I'm out here
at Camp Crystal Lake. Over.

196
00:29:01,284 --> 00:29:04,621
<i>Haul it back in, Dorf.
Chief wants you back in town.</i>

197
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:09,292
Roger that. 10-4. On my way. Out.

198
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:11,961
Never keep the chief waiting.

199
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:19,676
You kids keep your noses clean.
You'll be hearing from me if you don't.

200
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,849
We ain't gonna stand
for no weirdness out here.

201
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:16,691
I'm a messenger of God.
You're doomed if you stay here.

202
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:22,363
This place is cursed. Cursed.

203
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:27,368
- It's got a death curse!
- Who are you?

204
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,579
What do you want?

205
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:34,125
- God sent me.
- Get out of here, man!

206
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:39,172
I got to warn you.
You're doomed if you stay.

207
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:43,759
Go. Go!

208
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:59,524
- I think we just met Ralph.
- God, what's next?

209
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,664
You're doomed. You're all doomed.

210
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,358
- Who likes them rare?
- Me.

211
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,861
How can you guys eat that?
It looks like dead animals.

212
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,615
Dead animals? That's the old counselors.
You cannibals!

213
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:51,867
If you would mix this stuff right,
you'd get all the protein you need.

214
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:54,995
Too bad Annie never showed.
She was supposed to be a good cook.

215
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:58,916
- Don't expect me to play chef.
- The squaws are revolting.

216
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,961
- Trouble?
- Yeah. A bad bulb or no power.

217
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:04,296
Seems a little gloomy in here.

218
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:06,966
Steve taught me how to use
the emergency generator.

219
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:10,678
- Town power lines are lousy.
- Don't you love that macho talk?

220
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:12,930
Emergency generator.

221
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,057
- Want to give me a hand?
- Yeah.

222
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,768
- Wait for me.
- Can you watch the burgers?

223
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:20,938
- Sure.
- Burn them.

224
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:28,362
- Think he's gonna be bent out of shape?
- I don't know.

225
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:32,449
This looks almost like the one
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.

226
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:36,162
- Well, here goes.
- What an antique.

227
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:47,297
Well, what hath God wrought?

228
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,833
Hello?

229
00:34:15,217 --> 00:34:17,386
Can I help you?

230
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,103
Hello? Hello?

231
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:31,607
- Come on.
- Coming, I'm coming.

232
00:34:34,902 --> 00:34:39,073
Wind's come up.
Shifted a good 180 degrees.

233
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,201
Makes me want to hold onto you.

234
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:49,792
- What about Ned?
- I don't love Ned.

235
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:53,171
- He keeps acting like such a jerk.
- Neddy!

236
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:56,174
- Don't call him.
- Thought you wanted to give him...

237
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,217
...one of your motherly lectures.

238
00:34:58,384 --> 00:35:02,972
Look, Neddy's gonna do whatever
Neddy wants to do, you know?

239
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:07,768
It's gonna storm. Gonna tear down
that valley like a son of a gun.

240
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:10,480
I've been afraid of storms
since I was little.

241
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:12,940
No. Really?

242
00:35:13,107 --> 00:35:18,153
I've had this dream about five or six
times where I'm in a thunderstorm...

243
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:25,160
...and it's raining really hard. It sounds
like pebbles when it hits the ground.

244
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:31,166
I hear it and I try to block it out
with my hands, only it doesn't work.

245
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,336
It just keeps getting
louder and louder.

246
00:35:37,172 --> 00:35:40,342
And then the rain turns to blood...

247
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:45,847
...and the blood washes away
in little rivers...

248
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:50,352
...and then the sound stops.

249
00:35:51,812 --> 00:35:57,859
- It's just a dream.
- I know. I call it my "shower dream."

250
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:02,697
Hey, hey. This is no dream.
Come on, we're gonna get soaked.

251
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,818
Jack and Marcie are gonna get drenched!

252
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,529
Not if they're where I think they are.

253
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,431
That's nice.

254
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,976
I know what we can do.
We'll play Monopoly.

255
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:43,354
- I hate Monopoly!
- Not the way I play it, you don't.

256
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,691
- Like what?
- We're going to play strip Monopoly.

257
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:51,237
- I'll be the shoe.
- You have got to be kidding.

258
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:52,989
What if Steve walks in?

259
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:57,577
We'll give him a handicap.
He can keep his boots on. It's easy.

260
00:38:57,743 --> 00:39:03,291
Instead of rent, you pay clothes. Bill
can be banker. Unless he's chicken.

261
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:06,127
Heaven help you if you land
in my hotel!

262
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:09,714
Why don't you see if Marcie
left any of that grass?

263
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:14,218
- What happened to my 500's?
- They're there. Where's my shoe?

264
00:40:25,955 --> 00:40:28,999
I'm not going to pass "Go"
without a glow.

265
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:31,961
We rolled for you. You're going last.

266
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:35,464
Community Chest cannot
give you your clothes back.

267
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:39,635
Double sixes! I get to roll again!

268
00:40:39,802 --> 00:40:42,888
- We're being hustled.
- I think you're right.

269
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:49,770
You are so fine.

270
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:58,737
Where are you going?

271
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:02,032
I gotta pee.
You're lying on my bladder.

272
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:10,123
Hurry back, okay?
It's getting cold in here.

273
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:22,260
- You'll save my place for me?
- Yeah.

274
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:41,529
Five.

275
00:41:42,614 --> 00:41:46,910
- Baltic Avenue. I'll buy it.
- No one ever lands on Baltic Avenue.

276
00:41:47,076 --> 00:41:49,204
I think it's a pretty color.

277
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:52,916
Come on.

278
00:41:53,875 --> 00:41:55,376
Eight.

279
00:41:56,878 --> 00:42:02,007
- Baltic Avenue. You owe me one boot.
- Coming.

280
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:04,343
Alice draws first blood.

281
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,388
- Terrible way to talk about my feet.
- Thank you.

282
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:09,848
Who's next?

283
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:15,103
You know I think I'm beginning
to like this game.

284
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,232
Wait until he lands
on my old Kentucky home.

285
00:42:18,398 --> 00:42:21,151
- More beer? More beer.
- Let's see. A railroad.

286
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:27,984
<i>Forty Yards to the Outhouse,
by Willie Makit.</i>

287
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:31,863
Come on, kids,
you can do better than that.

288
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:34,990
Jack?

289
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,831
Jack?

290
00:44:46,293 --> 00:44:47,670
Jack?

291
00:44:56,846 --> 00:45:01,058
When I looked into that mirror,
I knew I'd always be ugly.

292
00:45:02,143 --> 00:45:06,939
I said,
"Lizzie, you'll always be plain."

293
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:12,153
Hello?

294
00:45:49,772 --> 00:45:51,024
Ned?

295
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:57,155
Hey, come on, you guys.

296
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:43,951
It must be my imagination.

297
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:04,721
- Hello.
- Shit.

298
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:07,765
Worst run of bad luck
since Richard Nixon.

299
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:09,725
You can call it quits.

300
00:47:09,934 --> 00:47:15,064
Fat chance! You're two steps
from Pacific Avenue and Skin City.

301
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:24,824
What can I say?
It's not much, but I call it home.

302
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:31,330
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Get the money.

303
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:34,584
- God!
- It's blowing like crazy out there.

304
00:47:34,792 --> 00:47:38,921
I think I left the windows
in my cabin open. Shoot!

305
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:44,927
We'll have to finish this game
some other night.

306
00:47:45,136 --> 00:47:47,680
Just when it was getting interesting.

307
00:47:48,473 --> 00:47:51,058
- See you guys in the morning.
- See you.

308
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:53,603
- Good night.
- Good night.

309
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,237
Look at this mess! Here.

310
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:08,825
- Were you going to go ahead with it?
- I hadn't made up my mind.

311
00:48:08,992 --> 00:48:11,995
We'll have to finish
the game another night.

312
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:34,935
- Is there anything else you want?
- No, thanks, Sandy. I'm fine.

313
00:48:35,143 --> 00:48:38,313
You can't go out in that rain.
You want to drown?

314
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:41,775
I've got to.
I've got six new counselors at camp.

315
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:45,320
They are babes in the woods,
in every sense.

316
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:50,032
They'll be okay if they know enough
to come out of the rain.

317
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:54,703
- Well, what do I owe you?
- Just a night on the town, Steve.

318
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:59,792
- Come on now, you know what I mean.
- That's okay. Two and a quarter.

319
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:04,588
Thank you.

320
00:49:17,143 --> 00:49:19,979
- Here's your change.
- No, you keep it.

321
00:49:20,187 --> 00:49:21,397
- Thank you.
- Sure.

322
00:49:21,605 --> 00:49:23,149
- Drive careful.
- I will.

323
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:24,358
Good night.

324
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:51,561
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,732
- Thought that'd go through anything.
- Not dragging a trailer.

326
00:52:55,941 --> 00:52:57,400
Can you give me a lift?

327
00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:01,737
- I'll have a counselor bring me back.
- Why not?

328
00:54:22,275 --> 00:54:24,152
Help me!

329
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:51,094
Help me!

330
00:55:18,997 --> 00:55:20,374
Hello.

331
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:29,925
- Hello.
- Over here. Please somebody help me.

332
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:31,385
Hello.

333
00:55:34,804 --> 00:55:36,097
Hello.

334
00:55:40,143 --> 00:55:41,435
Hello.

335
00:55:46,983 --> 00:55:48,234
Hello?

336
00:55:53,906 --> 00:55:59,579
Come quickly, please.
Come quickly. Help.

337
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:16,637
Where are you? Hello.

338
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:37,783
Hello?

339
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:45,540
All right.

340
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:50,670
Come on out! You're not funny anymore!

341
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:54,633
It's not funny at all.

342
00:57:59,488 --> 00:58:00,739
Bill.

343
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:06,495
- Hi. The generator is okay.
- I thought I heard a scream.

344
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:10,623
- How can you hear in that wind?
- It sounded like Brenda.

345
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:12,125
I'd better look.

346
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:15,795
Somebody turned on the lights
at the archery range.

347
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:19,966
I can't see anything.

348
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,719
They're off now.

349
00:58:23,678 --> 00:58:25,722
I'm gonna check it out.

350
00:58:26,264 --> 00:58:30,727
- Bill. Can I come?
- Come on.

351
00:58:34,022 --> 00:58:35,398
Brenda!

352
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:37,776
Brenda!

353
00:58:43,114 --> 00:58:44,824
Where is she?

354
00:58:46,618 --> 00:58:49,287
She must be with Jack and Marcie.

355
00:58:52,415 --> 00:58:54,292
- Alice?
- Yeah?

356
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:55,752
Come here.

357
00:59:15,312 --> 00:59:18,398
What is going on?

358
00:59:21,985 --> 00:59:23,237
Come on!

359
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:33,747
- Jack, open the door.
- Jack.

360
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:41,547
- Where are they?
- I don't know. Come on.

361
00:59:45,092 --> 00:59:46,635
Brenda?

362
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:49,303
Marcie?

363
00:59:50,555 --> 00:59:55,393
Jack? Neddy?

364
00:59:59,981 --> 01:00:02,650
Bill, I think we should call someone.

365
01:00:03,317 --> 01:00:05,570
If this is a joke, I'll brain them!

366
01:00:05,778 --> 01:00:10,491
I'm serious.
I really think we should call someone.

367
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:20,835
The sucker's locked.

368
01:00:21,043 --> 01:00:23,087
- Where's the key?
- I don't know.

369
01:00:23,254 --> 01:00:24,797
Wait a minute.

370
01:00:33,848 --> 01:00:35,558
Watch out.

371
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:41,646
Be careful.

372
01:00:43,732 --> 01:00:45,358
Let me get the light.

373
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:54,993
What's wrong?

374
01:00:55,535 --> 01:00:58,038
It's dead. Try the pay phone.

375
01:00:58,246 --> 01:01:00,540
Do you have a dime or a quarter?

376
01:01:01,082 --> 01:01:02,876
No. Check the desk.

377
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:12,844
Hello?

378
01:01:13,428 --> 01:01:15,639
This damn thing's dead too!

379
01:01:31,237 --> 01:01:33,239
What's the matter with it?

380
01:01:33,447 --> 01:01:34,907
It's wet.

381
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:36,075
I don't know.

382
01:01:36,283 --> 01:01:39,954
Why don't we just hike out of here?
Get out. Right now!

383
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:43,749
It's 10 miles to the nearest crossroads.
Steve will be back soon.

384
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:47,294
We can use his jeep if we need
to get help. Don't worry.

385
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:51,090
- There's some stupid explanation for this.
- Like what?

386
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:55,010
We'll be laughing about this tomorrow,
I promise.

387
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,057
Let's get out of the rain.

388
01:02:05,146 --> 01:02:10,025
It's not bad enough to have Friday the
13th, we've gotta have a full moon too.

389
01:02:10,234 --> 01:02:15,030
We keep statistics. We have more
accidents, more rapes, more robberies...

390
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:18,909
...more homicides, more of everything
when there's a full moon.

391
01:02:19,118 --> 01:02:21,786
It upsets people. Makes them nuts.

392
01:02:21,995 --> 01:02:24,747
You're making science
out of coincidence.

393
01:02:26,624 --> 01:02:29,461
I hear Ralph was out your way today.

394
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:32,672
His wife was a nervous wreck
until we got him home.

395
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:36,217
That's all I need,
Crazy Ralph running around.

396
01:02:36,426 --> 01:02:38,678
Well, the rain's stopping.

397
01:02:39,762 --> 01:02:41,556
It was a pisser while it lasted.

398
01:02:41,764 --> 01:02:45,435
<i>Sgt. Tierney, come in.
Sgt. Tierney, Car Niner.</i>

399
01:02:46,603 --> 01:02:47,979
This is Tierney.

400
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:52,984
<i>Rescue squad with Jaws of Life.
Near mile-marker 17. Possible fatals.</i>

401
01:02:53,193 --> 01:02:55,570
<i>Three, maybe more, trapped.
Head on.</i>

402
01:02:55,779 --> 01:03:00,074
Roger. Acknowledge receipt.
Estimate arrival, 15 minutes.

403
01:03:09,876 --> 01:03:12,878
- I have to let you off here.
- Sure.

404
01:03:13,879 --> 01:03:15,088
Thanks.

405
01:03:15,297 --> 01:03:17,007
Good luck.

406
01:03:56,171 --> 01:03:57,631
Who is that?

407
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:05,138
What are you doing
out in this mess?

408
01:05:26,843 --> 01:05:28,970
What do you think happened?

409
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:31,139
I don't know.

410
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:35,185
The generator's probably out of gas.

411
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:37,354
I'll go check it.

412
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:40,857
Do you want me to come with you?

413
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:44,860
Why don't you stay here
and try and sleep.

414
01:05:46,028 --> 01:05:47,321
I'll be right back.

415
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:19,537
Full of gas.

416
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:06,542
Generator.

417
01:14:13,818 --> 01:14:16,403
What am I gonna do?

418
01:15:28,266 --> 01:15:30,560
Please! Oh, please!

419
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,273
Who are you?

420
01:15:36,107 --> 01:15:39,611
I'm Mrs. Voorhees.
An old friend of the Christys.

421
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:44,449
No, no. There, there.

422
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:47,327
I can't help you
if you don't calm down.

423
01:15:47,494 --> 01:15:52,248
But she's dead and he's dead.
Oh, my God! Poor Bill! Oh, God!

424
01:15:52,457 --> 01:15:55,793
- All right. Come on, dear. Show me.
- No. No!

425
01:15:55,959 --> 01:16:01,048
It's all right. I'll take care of you.
I used to work for the Christys.

426
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:03,592
What's going on?
Help me get out of here!

427
01:16:03,801 --> 01:16:07,387
It's this place and the storm.
That's why you're upset.

428
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,516
No, no! They're all dead!
They're all dead!

429
01:16:10,682 --> 01:16:13,685
- All right. I'll go look.
- Don't leave me!

430
01:16:13,852 --> 01:16:15,646
They'll kill you too!

431
01:16:15,854 --> 01:16:17,981
I'm not afraid.

432
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:39,294
Oh, my Lord!

433
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,297
So young.

434
01:16:42,548 --> 01:16:44,174
So pretty.

435
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:47,301
What monster could have done this?

436
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:50,972
Bill is out there!

437
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:54,809
Oh, God, this place!

438
01:16:55,226 --> 01:16:58,312
Steve should never have
opened this place again!

439
01:16:58,521 --> 01:17:01,065
There's been too much trouble here.

440
01:17:01,941 --> 01:17:04,235
Did you know a young boy drowned?

441
01:17:04,444 --> 01:17:07,029
The year before those two others
were killed.

442
01:17:07,238 --> 01:17:09,657
The counselors weren't paying attention!

443
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:13,536
They were making love
while that young boy drowned!

444
01:17:14,829 --> 01:17:17,165
His name was Jason.

445
01:17:18,833 --> 01:17:22,253
I was working the day it happened.
Preparing meals.

446
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:24,922
Here. I was the cook.

447
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:28,217
Jason should have been watched!
Every minute!

448
01:17:28,426 --> 01:17:30,052
He was...

449
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:35,850
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

450
01:17:37,976 --> 01:17:40,520
We can go now, dear.

451
01:17:40,854 --> 01:17:44,107
I think we should wait for Mr. Christy.

452
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:46,359
That's not necessary.

453
01:17:46,568 --> 01:17:48,361
I don't understand.

454
01:17:49,488 --> 01:17:51,364
Help me!

455
01:17:51,573 --> 01:17:52,866
Help!

456
01:17:53,074 --> 01:17:54,326
Help, Mommy!

457
01:17:54,534 --> 01:17:57,537
Help! Help, Mommy!

458
01:17:58,538 --> 01:18:00,707
I am, Jason.

459
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:02,042
I am.

460
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:08,131
You see, Jason was my son.

461
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,884
And today is his birthday.

462
01:18:11,093 --> 01:18:13,553
Where's Mr. Christy?

463
01:18:13,762 --> 01:18:16,765
I couldn't let them open this place again.

464
01:18:16,932 --> 01:18:18,558
Could I?

465
01:18:19,184 --> 01:18:21,311
Not after what happened.

466
01:18:25,148 --> 01:18:28,818
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason.

467
01:18:29,819 --> 01:18:32,154
My only child.

468
01:18:32,738 --> 01:18:33,864
Jason.

469
01:18:38,744 --> 01:18:40,371
You let him drown!

470
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:43,666
You never paid any attention!

471
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:46,752
Look what you did to him!

472
01:18:46,961 --> 01:18:51,173
Look what you did to him!

473
01:19:52,942 --> 01:19:56,196
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

474
01:20:00,075 --> 01:20:04,120
Don't let her get away, Mommy.
Don't let her live!

475
01:20:04,287 --> 01:20:08,333
I won't, Jason. I won't!

476
01:20:57,631 --> 01:20:59,841
Where are the goddamn bullets?

477
01:21:16,023 --> 01:21:17,150
Come, dear.

478
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:21,863
It will be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

479
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:28,661
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

480
01:21:30,747 --> 01:21:32,123
Kill her.

481
01:23:09,176 --> 01:23:12,096
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

482
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:16,016
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

483
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:19,061
Get her, Mommy. Get her!

484
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:21,564
Kill her! Kill her.

485
01:27:51,911 --> 01:27:53,955
Get off me!

486
01:31:02,599 --> 01:31:05,268
Ten milligrams, Valium.
It's all right.

487
01:31:05,477 --> 01:31:07,604
It's all over. Everything's over.

488
01:31:10,856 --> 01:31:13,192
Roll over. Roll over, dear.

489
01:31:33,712 --> 01:31:36,006
Your folks are on the way up.

490
01:31:38,759 --> 01:31:41,011
Is anyone else alive?

491
01:31:42,513 --> 01:31:44,390
Are they all dead?

492
01:31:44,849 --> 01:31:46,475
Yes, ma'am.

493
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:52,481
Two of my men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead too.

494
01:31:53,399 --> 01:31:55,651
Do you remember very much?

495
01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,403
The boy.

496
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:59,613
Is he dead too?

497
01:31:59,864 --> 01:32:03,366
- Who?
- The boy, Jason.

498
01:32:04,826 --> 01:32:05,869
Jason?

499
01:32:06,077 --> 01:32:11,040
In the lake. The one who attacked me.
The one who pulled me under the water.

500
01:32:12,876 --> 01:32:16,463
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

501
01:32:18,256 --> 01:32:19,883
But he...

502
01:32:26,264 --> 01:32:28,933
Then he's still there.
