2
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,290
In here. Right there.

3
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,008
Jesus Christ, it gets
worse all the time.

4
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,468
Sure as hell doesn't get any better.

5
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,513
All shot in their beds, execution style,

6
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,349
only the mother shot in the head.

7
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,687
What time you make it?
Give me a ballpark guess.

8
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,189
3:00, 3:15,

9
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,942
and that's pretty close.

10
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,903
Thanks.

11
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,966
How long have you been waiting?

12
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,884
-About half an hour...
-Just a couple of minutes.

13
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:07,014
Over there, that's a
little gardening hut.

14
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,517
-You mean that's included?
-Sure.

15
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,061
It could be a guest house,
with a little fixing up.

16
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,021
- A guest house?
- Sure.

17
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,148
Come on. Right up here.

18
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,780
See how much property you have?
Isn't that lovely?

19
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,994
Be careful. Don't trip.

20
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,873
You'll see what a beauty this is.

21
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,631
There's nothing like it on the market,

22
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,383
not at this price.

23
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,347
- Come in. Come on in.
- Thank you.

24
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,725
- Impressive, isn't it?
- Wow.

25
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,935
I mean,
that's what I call charming.

26
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,605
-Come on, I'll show you the living room.
-Thank you.

27
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:02,069
That's a wood-burning fireplace.
Be nice on cold nights.

28
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,453
That's the sun porch. Nice, isn't it?

29
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,456
- George, I don't think...
- Be cool.

30
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,292
Would you like
to see the kitchen?

31
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,960
Yes, thank you.

32
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,464
This is the kitchen.
Nice and spacious, isn't it?

33
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,634
Really big. Has all the original hardware,
and everything works.

34
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,722
This your first house?

35
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,434
We just got married.

36
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,063
Shall we look at the upstairs?

37
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,733
I like to refer to this as
a fixer-upper that can be fun.

38
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,238
We can start with this, huh?

39
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,618
Now, this is an extra room.

40
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,887
This is the bathroom connecting
with the next bedroom.

41
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,056
This is the second bedroom.

42
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,726
There's a nice view of
the river from here.

43
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,107
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms, plus...

44
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,110
We already have a family,
two boys and a girl.

45
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,028
Great kids.

46
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,492
-You are so bad.
-What?

47
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,285
-Cut it out!
-What?

48
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,088
Next is the master bedroom.

49
00:07:58,645 --> 00:07:59,979
Love it.

50
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,107
Just one more floor.

51
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,362
See anything you like,

52
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,329
-we can include it in the price.
-Really?

53
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,581
Sure.

54
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:30,843
This can be another bedroom,
or a playroom, whichever you prefer.

55
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,686
I'll tell you what, I think maybe
we'll wander around on our own again,

56
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,438
now that we got the layout.

57
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,400
We can meet you downstairs.
How'd that be?

58
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,070
I'll be in the kitchen. Take your time.

59
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,656
We won't be long.

60
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,996
What do you think?

61
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,832
I love it.

62
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,128
But, honey, $80,000?

63
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,801
I mean, it might as well be $800,000.

64
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,681
Well, now, listen.

65
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,438
The house is worth $120,000 easy.

66
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,065
Mmm-hmm.

67
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,777
And if I move my office
into that little cottage out back,

68
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,903
that'll save that rent.

69
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,573
And the boathouse means I won't have
to shell out for mooring charges,

70
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,909
which they're raising, by the way.

71
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,994
You didn't tell me that.

72
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,747
There was nothing to be done about it.

73
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,918
I just wish that
all those people hadn't died here.

74
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,257
A guy kills his whole family?

75
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,550
Doesn't that bother you?

76
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,553
Sure, but houses don't have memories.

77
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,141
I don't know.

78
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,270
Well, I do.
The house wouldn't even be for sale,

79
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,605
and if it was, we couldn't afford it

80
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,525
if we had tuna casseroles for a year.

81
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,364
You're going to be very happy.
It's a wonderful house.

82
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,324
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.

83
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,119
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle the details.

84
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,538
Just go on and get ready to move.

85
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,392
They're not getting too close
to the river out there?

86
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,810
Uh-uh.

87
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,104
Sounds like a regular daddy
I hear over there.

88
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:34,109
I might feel like one, if that's what they
started calling me instead of George,

89
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:39,448
which, I got to admit, is better than all
that "Mr. Lutz" crap they were giving me.

90
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,537
What do you want to do with this?

91
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,376
I know, I know. Put it in the living room
on that wall there beside the bookshelf,

92
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,712
and the light will come through
the window and look beautiful.

93
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,172
You got it.

94
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,394
Voila!

95
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,648
Aw, shit, come on.

96
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,664
I'm tired of
this damn sticky paper!

97
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,998
I wish I'd listened to my mother

98
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,292
and gotten the old-fashioned kind
that you tack down.

99
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,294
Nobody likes a quitter.

100
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,172
But I got an idea.

101
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,094
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

102
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,056
What are those monsters up to?

103
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,364
Hello?

104
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,950
Anybody home?

105
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,244
Hello?

106
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,500
George?

107
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,504
Kathy?

108
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,465
Anybody home?

109
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,682
Hello?

110
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,156
Harry, get over here.

111
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,602
God's peace in this house.

112
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,849
Get out.

113
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,275
Get out!

114
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,085
Amy? Amy, honey, dinner's ready.

115
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,216
Amy?

116
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,614
-Here.
-No, I've got her.

117
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:39,534
You and the boys start. I'll take
her upstairs and put her to bed.

118
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,710
She wasn't outside.

119
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,880
Where was she?

120
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,634
Up. You get on in there
and eat your hot dogs. Come on.

121
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,241
Hello.

122
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,119
Hello, Kathy?

123
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,709
Kathy, can you hear me? Kathy.

124
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,173
Father Delaney, there's
something very...

125
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,467
Hello? Hello?

126
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,720
-Who was that?
-On the phone?

127
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,305
Yeah.

128
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:26,474
Just a bunch of static.
A bad connection or something.

129
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,102
I think Ma Bell's gone wacko again.

130
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,107
Probably discover it was a collect call
from Japan or someplace

131
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,192
when the next bill comes.

132
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,738
Did you make sure
that Amy's got her doll with her?

133
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,324
Yeah, she's sleeping with it.

134
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,492
You hungry, honey?

135
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:50,498
You don't want one of those charbroiled
hot dogs I did especially for you?

136
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,335
No, I'm not hungry.

137
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,425
Damn, it's cold in here.

138
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:05,055
I felt cold a bit earlier,
but I think I've warmed up now.

139
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,476
It says 72. It feels like 32.

140
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,770
Do you know what I think it is?

141
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,397
I think there's a draft
that comes up from the basement

142
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,691
through that door down there.

143
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,948
This house is supposed
to be well-insulated.

144
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,325
They'll nickel-and-dime you to death.

145
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,534
Huh?

146
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,379
Matt?

147
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,507
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

148
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,677
-Did you hurt yourself?
-No.

149
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,264
Those stairs are tricky. Come on.

150
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,474
I'll take you upstairs.

151
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,269
We'll check this all out tomorrow.

152
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:21,357
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't mean to scare you.

153
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,737
I look at you all the time.

154
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,114
I can't get used to you.

155
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,245
Who loves you?

156
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,502
-I'm lucky.
-Come here.

157
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,797
I just wanted to clean up first.

158
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,560
I love the way you smell right now.

159
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,697
I love you.

160
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,659
I love you back.

161
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,587
You make me feel like a kid
in the backseat of a car.

162
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:39,394
I want us to work. I want to be the best.
I don't want you to have any regrets.

163
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,188
I love you, Kathy.

164
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,123
I want to go home.

165
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,461
Mommy, I want to go home.

166
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,713
Honey, come on. What's this trouble?

167
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,257
Come on. Back to bed. Back to bed.

168
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,552
This is our home. Don't you know that?

169
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,639
Here we go.

170
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,101
There you go, sweetie.

171
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,355
What's the matter? Having mean dreams?

172
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,567
Sleep tight.

173
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,068
It's not so easy, is it?

174
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:56,906
Well, I guess people have had
to deal with this

175
00:26:56,991 --> 00:27:00,368
ever since Adam and Eve
got kicked out of the Garden.

176
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,706
Just have to learn to live with it.

177
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,045
Thank you.

178
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,912
You're one hell of a watchdog, Harry.

179
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,042
Come on, boy.

180
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,669
Come on.

181
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,276
What do you say, Harry?
It looks okay, huh?

182
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,473
George.

183
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,131
Don't ever do that.

184
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,426
Not to a man with an ax in his hand.

185
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,721
I just thought
maybe I could get a little help.

186
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,140
Look what you made me do.

187
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,725
I made you do?

188
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,687
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

189
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,314
Wait a minute till I finish this up.

190
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,066
George, "Finish"?

191
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,903
You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole South Shore!

192
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,418
You take this.

193
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,337
-I'll get the rest.
-I love you.

194
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,262
Broke a bulb.

195
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,727
Hey, who drinks this fancy
kind of tea around here?

196
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:21,439
Oh, that's for Aunt Helena.
She's coming by around 2:00.

197
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,650
-Give me a break.
-Come on, George, be nice.

198
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:27,194
This is a big event in my family.

199
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,779
We've always been a bunch of renters

200
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,324
and this is the first time
anyone's bought a house.

201
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,493
Damn regimental inspection,
and we're not ready.

202
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,927
Sweetie pie, you scared me.
What do you want?

203
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,679
My friend Jody wants to play upstairs.

204
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:35,763
Mmm-hmm?

205
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,640
Huh, Jody? See?

206
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:41,018
Mmm-hmm. Well, you and Jody
go on up and enjoy yourself.

207
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,146
And does your friend, Jody,
like sugar cookies too?

208
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,524
I don't think so.

209
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,650
No?

210
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:50,778
Off you go.

211
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,796
Hello, this is Kathy Lutz.

212
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,798
Could I speak with
Father Delaney, please?

213
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lutz.

214
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:15,094
Father's not feeling very well today.

215
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,054
He's asleep right now.

216
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,807
This is Father Bolen.
May I help you in any way?

217
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,684
Father Bolen,

218
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,770
he was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday,

219
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,731
but it can wait till he feels better.

220
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:31,068
-I hope he's not too sick.
-I think it's just one of those flu things.

221
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:34,405
But, Mrs. Lutz,
Father was at your house yesterday.

222
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,949
Uh-uh. We were expecting him,
but he never showed up.

223
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,410
Well, I know he left to go there.

224
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,996
He didn't come. We waited all day.

225
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,331
Must have been some kind of mix-up.

226
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,209
Oh, well, no big deal.
Just tell him "Hi."

227
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,754
And that we hope he's feeling better.

228
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,339
I sure will. Thank you for calling.

229
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,458
I'll go check Amy's bathroom.

230
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,337
Boy, does it stink!

231
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,007
Mom. Mom.

232
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,562
Kathy!

233
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,524
Go downstairs and let
your aunt Helena in.

234
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,609
And don't tell her anything
about this, okay?

235
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,403
-Do we have to? She's always pinching!
-Yes, you have to! Go, now!

236
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,239
-Come on!
-Go on.

237
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,282
And be polite.

238
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,999
Well, hello, Matthew.

239
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,003
And Gregory, and Harry.

240
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,549
-Where's your mother, dear?
-She said she'll be down in a minute.

241
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,838
Aunt Helena?

242
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,506
- Kathleen.
- What?

243
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:01,343
I'm sorry.
I must have set it too near the edge.

244
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,388
-I have to go.
-I don't understand.

245
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,473
I don't feel well at all.

246
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:10,227
Look, I bought your favorite tea
and I'll make you a cup.

247
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,938
I have to go. I really feel terrible.

248
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,773
If you just rested a while,
you'd feel a lot...

249
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,692
-I can't stay!
-Please, stay.

250
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,361
-No, I can't stay. I don't feel well.
-You'll feel a lot better if you just rest.

251
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,697
If you just rest and...

252
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,283
I can't stay. Forgive me.

253
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,577
George, please make her...

254
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,138
Hey.

255
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,776
-Aren't you going to come to bed?
-In a minute.

256
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,903
The fire went out.

257
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,781
Are you still cold?

258
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,747
Hope you're not coming down
with something.

259
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,835
I'll be all right.

260
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,089
I got to stay healthy
for your brother's wedding.

261
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,434
Your hair's getting long.

262
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,983
You know what?
Maybe you should sleep in tomorrow.

263
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,277
I got work to do.

264
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:09,073
I don't want to be up to my ass
in boxes forever.

265
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,627
I'm sorry.

266
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,716
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with me.

267
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,512
-Silly, this happens all the time.
-Not to me, it doesn't.

268
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,682
Hey, stop pushing.
You don't have to prove anything to me.

269
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,607
Yeah.

270
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,283
Turn out the light.

271
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,786
Turn out the light.

272
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,171
I love you.

273
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,215
I love you back.

274
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,284
She was shot in the head!

275
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,707
No.

276
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,668
You all right?

277
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,699
Tell me something, Father.

278
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,867
What?

279
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,704
Why couldn't this wait till tomorrow?

280
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,748
I don't know. I...

281
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:27,419
All I know is I have to get back
to that house. That's all.

282
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,717
-Are you feeling all right, Father?
-I'm fine, fine, fine.

283
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:42,184
-Father!
-What's the matter?

284
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,728
There's something wrong
with the steering wheel.

285
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,455
What's wrong with this?

286
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,243
Harry, be quiet!

287
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,704
Be quiet!

288
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,853
Kathy!

289
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,148
Will you check this for me, please?

290
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:13,233
It's got to come to 1,500 bucks
for the caterer.

291
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,403
-The sucker wants cash.
-Jimmy, will you relax?

292
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,573
You've counted it about 1000 times.

293
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,664
You sure do look terrific.

294
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,718
You're not gonna start to cry already?

295
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:44,806
It's just that, yesterday,

296
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,060
I was riding you around
on the back of my bike,

297
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,562
and now you're getting married.

298
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,980
I sure am.

299
00:44:56,778 --> 00:44:59,571
I'm just real happy for you,
that's all, hon.

300
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,789
Hey, there he is.

301
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,709
George, you look terrible.

302
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,419
So she keeps telling me.

303
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,838
It's just some kind
of little flu virus going around.

304
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,507
Amy's got it too. It's nothing.

305
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:21,343
Listen, if you're not up to it,
I'd understand.

306
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:25,222
Hey, I'm your best man.
Come on, let's go.

307
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,391
Okay.

308
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:30,769
Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed
to give Amy an aspirin or anything?

309
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:33,355
Just give her one before bed, okay?

310
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,983
Are you gonna be okay?

311
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,527
I don't know.

312
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,491
- What's the matter?
- The money.

313
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,285
What money?

314
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,371
The money for the caterer. $1,500.

315
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,416
-I put it in this pocket.
-It must have fallen out. Come on...

316
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,000
Well, it's not here.

317
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,170
I'll look under here.

318
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,716
Have you checked your pants?

319
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:07,931
Now, calm down, Jimmy. Calm down.
It can't have gotten up and walked away.

320
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,891
If you had it here, it's got to be here.

321
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:14,688
What am I gonna do?
I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

322
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,694
Will you get those kids off that horn?

323
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,614
Jimmy, George, we have to go.
We're getting very late.

324
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,950
- George...
- What am I gonna do?

325
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:30,787
It's got to be here someplace.

326
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:32,664
We'll just look for it
when we get home.

327
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,708
What about the caterer?

328
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:38,795
I'll take care of him.

329
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,505
I'll write him a check.

330
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,383
-You sweetie.
-Okay?

331
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,720
I'll get the kids.

332
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,116
It's freezing in here.

333
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,664
It's time for bed, Amy.
I've got to give you an aspirin.

334
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:18,668
I don't want to go to bed.
I want to play with Jody.

335
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,672
Now, your mom said I had to put you
to bed early because you've been sick.

336
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,633
Now, don't smart off to me.

337
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:28,094
I wasn't sick.
I just didn't like meat loaf.

338
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,972
Let's get you into your pajamas.

339
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,787
Amy? Open the door.

340
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,630
Amy, I'm in the closet. Open the door.

341
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,928
Amy, I mean it!

342
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:20,146
Amy, come to the door. Open it!

343
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,986
Amy, for Christ's sake, open the door!

344
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,821
Amy?

345
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:29,239
Amy?

346
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:37,330
Amy! Open the...

347
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,709
Amy, open...

348
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,589
Amy, open the door!

349
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,303
Amy!

350
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,930
Amy, open the door!

351
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,850
Amy?

352
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:59,811
For Christ's sake, open the door!

353
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,106
Amy!

354
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,505
How are you?

355
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,467
-Are you feeling better?
-Fine. Just fine.

356
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,011
-I want to apologize for the other day.
-Don't worry about that.

357
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,346
I don't know what happened.

358
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:37,223
I hadn't gone a half a block
from your house,

359
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,808
and I was violently ill.

360
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,102
I think there's a virus
or something going around.

361
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,731
Father Delaney's got something
and Amy's got something and...

362
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,692
I don't know what's
the matter with George.

363
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,154
Listen, I'll talk to you later, okay?

364
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,127
I'm gonna write you a check.

365
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:09,631
The deal was cash, you know? Cash.

366
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,175
The cash is lost.
You gotta take a check.

367
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,929
I don't like checks.
Let me tell you something about checks.

368
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,515
Checks get canceled. Checks bounce.

369
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,352
Checks is not cash. Cash is cash.

370
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:25,271
You listen to me, pal.

371
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,649
I don't like lectures,

372
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,694
and I don't like being hassled
in the men's room.

373
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,946
I'm gonna write you a check.

374
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,989
Either that's good enough for you

375
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:37,867
or you're gonna eat
your own goddamn food.

376
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,413
Look at this.

377
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:44,416
I want cash, and they're
giving me checks.

378
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,877
Are you all right, honey?

379
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:51,131
I don't think I can make it
through the reception.

380
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,716
Let's get the kids and split, huh?

381
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,635
Okay, I'll get the kids.
You take it easy.

382
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,378
Matt, get over here.

383
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,595
Now, Matt, right upstairs
and right to bed. Come on.

384
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,764
- Why? I'm not even tired.
- Upstairs and right to bed.

385
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:42,599
-You are so tired.
-I am not!

386
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,976
You're tired because
I said you're tired.

387
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,770
Hey, cut that out.

388
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,605
Come on. I'll bring you up
some milk and cookies.

389
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,191
Let me out.

390
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,943
Let me out.

391
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:56,863
Let me out.

392
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,532
Amy, are you okay?

393
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,161
Jackie?

394
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,499
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- I couldn't get out.

395
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,335
The door closed and it locked,
and I couldn't get out.

396
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,295
There's no lock on this door.

397
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,714
-It wouldn't open.
-Take a look.

398
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,257
Look. See?

399
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,762
It wouldn't open!

400
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,973
Why didn't you open the door?
Why didn't you answer me?

401
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,850
Jackie! Jackie! Jackie!

402
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,312
Why didn't you unlock the door?
You heard Jackie knocking.

403
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,732
- Jody wouldn't let me.
- Jody? Who's Jody?

404
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,319
She's my friend
and she comes to play with me.

405
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:40,240
Jesus Christ, what the hell are we
standing here listening to?

406
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,826
And weren't you told to go to bed?

407
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,869
Go on! Get out of here!

408
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,834
These kids of yours
need some goddamn discipline.

409
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,840
Let me see.
Let me go get something for them.

410
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,675
George yelled at me.

411
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,261
You should have opened the door!

412
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,430
Jody doesn't like George.

413
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:51,185
Where the hell is it?

414
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:58,860
There's an explanation
for all of it.

415
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:02,071
We're not in the habit of blaming Satan
for every phenomenon.

416
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,948
Neither am I, Father.

417
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:08,286
For a modernist, who thought Vatican II
didn't go far enough,

418
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,205
don't you think you sound
a little medieval?

419
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,669
My being a modernist
has nothing to do with it.

420
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,589
I happened to check into the murders,
and I checked into the 20-year-old boy

421
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,966
who killed his parents and
his four brothers and sisters,

422
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:25,553
and when he was at trial, he testified
that he heard voices in the house!

423
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:29,515
He heard voices in the house
and the voices told him to do it!

424
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,185
Now, I was in the house,
and I heard the voices too!

425
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,187
And I also felt a presence in the house!

426
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,231
I'm telling you,
there was a presence in that house!

427
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,610
Half of the killers in this country
say the same thing.

428
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,696
The voices.
"The voices told me to do it."

429
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,532
But I heard them, Father!
I heard voices!

430
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:50,495
Then explain this!
Explain my hand, if you can do that!

431
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:53,039
Go on!
Explain how the car went out of control!

432
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,125
Go on. Father Bolen was with me.
You tell him!

433
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,753
Well, the wheel locked, and then the...

434
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,299
The wheel locked.
How about a mechanical defect?

435
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:07,178
I'd blame Detroit
a lot faster than the Devil.

436
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,723
Seems like every month
there's some kind of recall.

437
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,145
I see.

438
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,483
We're just gonna walk away from it.

439
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,319
Has that become the fashion now?
To cover up?

440
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:25,405
Nothing to walk away from.

441
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,825
-Well, I think it's nonsense.
-There's nothing to cover up.

442
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,411
I think it's bureaucratical bullshit!

443
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,206
What do you think I am?

444
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,837
I am not some pink-cheeked seminarian

445
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:45,216
who doesn't know the difference
between the supernatural and a bad clam!

446
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,343
I am a trained psychotherapist!

447
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:50,680
I went into that house
and what I saw there was real!

448
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,767
What I felt there was real!
And what I heard there was real!

449
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,397
Now, gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

450
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,025
They are facing real danger.

451
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,821
Who the hell do you think you are?

452
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:12,160
You think your secular education gives
you the right to question the Church?

453
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:14,746
Sit down!

454
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,707
Sit!

455
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:33,014
Now, you haven't told us one thing

456
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,017
that can't be written off
as simple hysteria.

457
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:41,314
Even psychotherapists lose touch
with reality sometimes.

458
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,485
Your education doesn't
give you any immunity.

459
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,616
Father Nuncio and I have seen
our share of phenomena

460
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:55,328
and never once did any of them
turn out to be Satanist!

461
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,544
Let's understand each other, Father.

462
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,592
To me... The Church...

463
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,720
It's my home.

464
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,183
The Church is my strength.

465
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,943
And I need her now,

466
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:33,157
and that family needs her now.

467
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:43,501
Frank, how long has it been
since you've seen your family?

468
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:50,883
What do you mean?

469
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,761
We think you should take a vacation.

470
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,101
Good morning, Father.

471
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,395
Good day, Father.

472
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:06,399
You could do with a haircut and shave.

473
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,984
-What do you think?
-Very uptown.

474
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,778
-I thought you guys had a small business.
-Believe me, we do.

475
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,072
Getting smaller all the time.

476
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,284
What's the matter?

477
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,040
I don't want to go any closer.

478
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:07,001
Carolyn, what are you talking about?

479
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,297
It gives me the creeps.

480
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,196
Hi, George. How's it going?

481
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:42,286
Listen, I wouldn't have
come out and bothered you,

482
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,538
but your line's always busy.

483
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,707
Nobody's seen you for days.

484
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,255
You haven't even been in
to sign the payroll checks.

485
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,757
I did us both a favor
and brought them along.

486
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,967
Here.

487
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,511
-Gosh, what day is this?
-Thursday.

488
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,056
Thursday?

489
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,434
Thursday.

490
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,273
I promised the men I'd
hand-deliver these.

491
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,692
Should have been paid yesterday.

492
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:19,323
Some caterer's been screaming that you
wrote him a personal check that bounced.

493
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,286
I should have covered that.

494
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,955
And some guy from the IRS
has been calling.

495
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,249
Don't you have any good news?

496
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:36,924
Yeah, I brought you the spotlight
for your boat.

497
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,350
Come on. I'll put it on for you.

498
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:09,040
You girls think I don't know
what you're up to?

499
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:15,921
Well, I do. And if I ever catch you again,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

500
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:20,176
You girls hear me?
Janet, are you listening?

501
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,095
Now, don't be a smart ass.

502
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:30,144
You quit that. Stop teasing me.

503
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,776
Hey, what are you two rascals
doing in my room, huh?

504
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:47,078
Oh, my God!

505
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,464
The goddamn thing
feels like it's nailed shut!

506
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,717
Push!

507
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,997
Hold it out.
No blood gets on him.

508
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,707
I'll drive, honey.

509
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,251
-Amazing.
-What?

510
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,670
Not one broken bone.

511
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,307
George, are you awake?

512
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:59,275
Isn’t it kind of strange that none of
the bones are broken in Greg's hand?

513
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,322
George, I have to talk to you.

514
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,092
-What was that?
-I don't know. You stay up here.

515
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,510
Like hell.

516
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:41,979
Wait. Wait.

517
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,620
Goddamn it, don't sneak up on me.

518
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,999
You call the police.
I'm going to go check on something.

519
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,876
It's okay, sweetie.

520
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,352
Hi, Sarge, what brings you out?

521
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,687
Insomnia.

522
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:16,115
-What do you got?
-Beats the hell out of me.

523
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,761
-What do you got?
-This is Mrs. Lutz, Sergeant.

524
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,179
Mrs. Lutz.

525
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:41,974
And George Lutz.

526
01:07:50,734 --> 01:07:52,401
Is that L-U-T-Z-E?

527
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,902
No "E."

528
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,822
The basement door
is the same as the front.

529
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:00,200
What way is the basement?

530
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:02,161
Come on, I'll show you.

531
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,477
Hey, who let you in?

532
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:29,855
What are you doing there, boy?

533
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,278
No broken windows.

534
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:41,825
How long you been living here?

535
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,577
A couple of weeks.

536
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,123
Are you related to the family
that was here before?

537
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,876
Uh-uh.

538
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,128
You look a lot like them.

539
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,214
The kid had the same...

540
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,132
Harry, knock it off!

541
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:10,270
Have you had any trouble with vandals
or trespassers?

542
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,397
What's that supposed to mean?

543
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:18,237
Well, you've got a door that was broken
outward, Mr. Lutz, from the inside.

544
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,493
Burglars break in. You've got a
front door that's broken out.

545
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:28,080
Let me tell you something.
Somebody broke into my house.

546
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,874
They heard me coming and they took off.

547
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,711
Okay. Then who broke the basement door?

548
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,756
Maybe they came in through the cellar

549
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,467
and ran out the front door.

550
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,011
I checked all the windows down there.
None broken.

551
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:46,723
You think it was faster to break it down
than to open it?

552
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,109
There'll be a tighter
watch on your house.

553
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,112
You call us if anything happens, okay?

554
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,532
Good night. Good night.

555
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:06,243
Good night.

556
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,262
Why is this all going wrong?

557
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:10,933
We have to do something.

558
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:37,125
Jody says
everything's gonna get better.

559
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,293
Mmm-hmm.

560
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,379
What does Jody look like?

561
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:46,635
I mean, is Jody big,
or thin, or fat, or...

562
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:49,137
She's nice.

563
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:54,685
-She tells me things, too.
-Yeah? Like what does she tell you?

564
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:58,730
She tells me about the little boy
who used to live in my room.

565
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,066
He got hurt and he died.

566
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,820
What else does Jody tell you?

567
01:12:04,904 --> 01:12:08,240
She says she wants me
to live here forever and ever,

568
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,575
so we can all play together.

569
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,934
Good-bye, sweeties.
Be home by 3:30, okay?

570
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,937
Be careful.

571
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,347
Oh, answer.

572
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,651
Please answer.

573
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,293
Hello.

574
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:29,089
Father, this is Kathy Lutz,
and I have to talk to you.

575
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:33,969
Kathy, listen to what I'm telling you.

576
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,974
Father? Father!

577
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,396
Father!

578
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:00,412
Oh, Lord, hear my prayer

579
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,081
and hasten to answer me.

580
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:51,213
Hello. Everybody wanted to come over
to welcome you to the neighborhood.

581
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,259
It's all right, isn't it?

582
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,681
Just a minute, please.

583
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:06,353
Hello.

584
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:08,855
Hello?

585
01:16:58,072 --> 01:17:01,074
George, thanks for coming.

586
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,868
I thought I might be stood up.

587
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:06,413
Look, don't give me any crap.
I don't have time.

588
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:10,458
George, relax, will you?
I just want to buy you a drink.

589
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,169
- A couple of beers, please?
- Got you.

590
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:20,093
George, are you all right?

591
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,012
I mean, you look terrible.

592
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,763
Here you are, pal.

593
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,558
Jesus, I'm sorry.

594
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:28,977
You look just like that kid.

595
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,771
He was sitting right in that seat
where you are when he was arrested.

596
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,982
What the hell are you talking about?

597
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:38,445
The kid last year that killed his family.
You know the house down by the river?

598
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:41,072
-Hey, you're the spitting image.
-So?

599
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:45,118
So, I'll bring you another brew.
No offense, huh?

600
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,998
Look, I gotta get out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

601
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,667
No, George, now. We gotta talk now.

602
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:54,127
The business is falling apart.

603
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:56,296
People are calling.
Bills have to be paid.

604
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,631
I know you're busy unpacking,
but life goes on.

605
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:01,176
Don't push me, Jeff. I'm warning you.
I don't have the patience.

606
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:04,846
You're warning me?
Give me a break, will you? Talk to me!

607
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:11,436
I knew this would happen.
I told you, you were taking on too much.

608
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,230
-Just drop it, Jeff!
-You marry a dame with three kids,

609
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:16,858
you buy a big house
with mortgages up to your ass,

610
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,985
you change your religion
and you forget about business.

611
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,570
Great. Really great.

612
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:31,122
Okay. Now, can we talk?

613
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:38,213
Christ, man, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

614
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:40,924
Come on.

615
01:18:42,426 --> 01:18:46,346
Jesus loves me, this I know

616
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:50,809
for the Bible tells me so

617
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:55,563
Little ones to him belong

618
01:18:56,482 --> 01:19:01,236
They are weak but he is strong

619
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,532
Yes, Jesus loves me!

620
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,619
Yes, Jesus loves me!

621
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:13,415
Yes, Jesus loves me!

622
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,625
The Bible...

623
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,046
Who you singing to, princess?

624
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:21,714
You scared Jody.

625
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,175
Jody?

626
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:27,387
There's no one here. See?

627
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:30,557
You scared her.
She went out the window.

628
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,601
She went out the window?

629
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:37,230
I better check and make sure
she's not still there, huh?

630
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:54,456
The house is doing things.
Windows open by themselves.

631
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,626
Rooms full of flies
at the wrong time of year.

632
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:03,006
You saw what happened
to Greg's hand. It's crazy.

633
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:09,304
And last night the front door was
ripped off its hinges from the inside.

634
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:14,058
Of course. It's right here.
It's history.

635
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,561
John Ketchum.

636
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:17,979
So?

637
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:21,774
Listen, they ran him out of Salem
for being a witch.

638
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:27,071
He built his house exactly
where you're living.

639
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:31,409
You're living on some sort
of special ground.

640
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,162
Devil worship.

641
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,747
Death.

642
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,082
Sacrifice.

643
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:44,088
George, there's one simple rule.

644
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:48,510
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
It can only change forms.

645
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,345
Carolyn, will you get
a grip on yourself?

646
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,931
You sound like some kind
of psycho weirdo.

647
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:57,519
Come on, Jeffrey, don't be such
a hard-core rationalist.

648
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:00,605
You know, everything in life
cannot be explained by a slide rule.

649
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,941
Thank you very much
for your cosmic views.

650
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,193
Now, do me a favor, shut up!

651
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,868
Can I make a rational
suggestion, please?

652
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:19,165
Sure, man, anything.

653
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:26,714
Go home, get cleaned up,
take Kathy out to dinner.

654
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,634
Carolyn and I will baby-sit the kids.

655
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:33,054
You've got to get away from it, George,
even if it's for a couple of hours,

656
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:36,224
and when you get back,
we'll add it all up.

657
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,644
We'll talk this thing through.

658
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,151
Okay.

659
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:50,154
Let's go home.

660
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:09,382
Look, I'll go in and talk to Kathy.
You all come in, in a couple of minutes.

661
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,265
Hey. Hey.

662
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:18,933
Hey!

663
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,437
He told us to wait out here.

664
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:26,566
Jeff, I've got to see it for myself.

665
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:30,320
-I thought that place gave you the creeps.
-What?

666
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:36,117
Are those vibes ever strong.

667
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,704
It really pulls on you.

668
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:45,168
I've got to see the basement.
That's where it's coming from.

669
01:22:45,252 --> 01:22:47,962
I'm very sensitive about these things.

670
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,215
And I know about them.

671
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:57,388
Come on. Knock it off, will you?

672
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,809
What I saw was not a cat.

673
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:09,817
It could have climbed up the ivy.
It's all over the side of the damn house.

674
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:15,156
Look, Kathy,
I don't have all the answers yet.

675
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:18,743
We've got to get some perspective
on this thing.

676
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:24,749
Come on, let's take Jeff's offer.
Put yourself together.

677
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:29,087
Let's get the hell away from it
for a couple of hours.

678
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:31,964
We'll get dressed.

679
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:35,968
I just gotta check the fire first.

680
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:50,775
Demons are smart.
They're not just monsters. They...

681
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:55,196
They think. Just like you and I do,

682
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:59,450
just in reverse. You know?
It's a closed system.

683
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:04,747
Now you're beginning
to give me the creeps.

684
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:10,878
There was a tribe of Indians
called the Shinnecocks,

685
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:14,132
and they used this land
as a sort of exposure pen.

686
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:21,055
They put all the crazy people here
and left them here to die.

687
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,059
My God!

688
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,769
That's where it is.

689
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:29,480
What the hell are you talking about?

690
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:33,025
There are people buried here.

691
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:40,908
Easy. Easy.

692
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:43,703
Easy, Harry.

693
01:25:00,888 --> 01:25:02,180
What the hell are you doing?

694
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:06,184
What is the matter with you?

695
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:09,061
Don't you understand? It has to be done.

696
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:12,231
-That is where the room is!
-What the hell are you doing to my house?

697
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:14,150
George, I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into her.

698
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:17,153
I'm trying to tell him.
That's where it is.

699
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,374
She's right.

700
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,045
She's right. There is something here.

701
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,133
Give me that.

702
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,409
What's going on?

703
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,621
Have you all gone mad? George!

704
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,815
They come and go through here.

705
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:50,705
Find a well.

706
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:57,295
It's the passage to hell!

707
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:03,968
Cover it!

708
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:49,263
Hello.

709
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:07,782
George, you heard that voice.
You know whose voice that was?

710
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:12,662
George, you heard that voice.
You know whose voice that was?

711
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:17,166
You heard it! I know you heard it!

712
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,008
We have to do something, George.

713
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,928
We have to do something now.

714
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,183
Peace to this house
and all who enter here.

715
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:17,893
- Forgive our sins...
- Peace to this house

716
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:20,604
- and all who enter here.
- ...and save us from all illness.

717
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:23,524
Grant this through Jesus
Christ, our Lord.

718
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:34,368
What is going on here?

719
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:39,957
Weird people.

720
01:29:56,308 --> 01:29:58,976
Bless this house and all who enter here.

721
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,978
Bless this house...

722
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,106
What's happening?

723
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,240
Kathy? Kathy?

724
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:18,829
-Kathy?
-Don't touch me!

725
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,248
Leave me alone, please.

726
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:26,504
Please?

727
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,064
Father,
since I've come back from Vietnam,

728
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:48,150
you've had a tremendous
influence in my life.

729
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:51,362
I look up to you.
I respect you. I admire you.

730
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,656
And what is your point?

731
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:59,453
Well, I believe that I know about fear.

732
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:02,581
I've seen it. I experienced it.

733
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:08,963
Richard, I wish you'd make your point
because I've got a lot of things to do.

734
01:31:09,047 --> 01:31:11,590
My point is, Father, that I believe
we create our own demons

735
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,259
in our own minds.

736
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:19,056
I'm sorry, Father.

737
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,416
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

738
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:53,841
Let us pray.

739
01:32:07,397 --> 01:32:08,731
Father...

740
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:13,402
By the power of Your spirit,

741
01:32:14,404 --> 01:32:16,614
You have filled the hearts

742
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:19,950
of Your faithful people

743
01:32:21,203 --> 01:32:25,331
with gifts of love for one another.

744
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:31,795
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

745
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,757
Give them health.

746
01:32:35,926 --> 01:32:38,636
Give them health of
mind and body that...

747
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:45,392
Give them health
of mind and body

748
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,437
that they may do Your will
with perfect love.

749
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:53,234
Give them health
of mind and body

750
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:56,070
that they may do Your will
with perfect love!

751
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:59,573
We ask this through our Lord,
Jesus Christ, Your son.

752
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:03,911
Give them strength of mind and body!

753
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:08,290
O Lord, I beg thee!

754
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:11,502
Give them strength
in the name of our Lord,

755
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,421
Jesus Christ, Your son!

756
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,673
O Lord!

757
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,344
Oh, Jesus Christ!

758
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:34,817
Richard.

759
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,947
What is it, Father?

760
01:33:42,993 --> 01:33:44,368
I can't see.

761
01:33:51,501 --> 01:33:52,835
I'm blind.

762
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,627
What do you want from us?

763
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:22,466
God damn it, this is my house!

764
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:25,529
No! No, no, no! No!

765
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,030
Oh, no.

766
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:11,492
Oh, no.

767
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:15,037
I'm coming apart!

768
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:18,290
Oh, Mother of God, I'm coming apart!

769
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:24,546
George?

770
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,841
George? What happened?

771
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:31,386
I was just dreaming.

772
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:34,848
I'm sorry if I woke you.

773
01:37:34,933 --> 01:37:37,059
Honey, are you okay?

774
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:40,145
-Oh, sure.
-Are you sure?

775
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,820
Oh, my God. What happened to your foot?

776
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:52,950
Look.

777
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:56,954
Nothing. I just tripped.

778
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:04,545
-It looks like teeth marks.
-Will you stop nagging at me?

779
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:07,631
It's always so cold in here.

780
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:13,136
Let's get out of here.

781
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:15,847
Let's just pack up our stuff and go.

782
01:38:18,768 --> 01:38:22,396
Would you please leave that damn fire
alone and listen to me?

783
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,274
I'm not going anywhere.
You're the one that wanted a house!

784
01:38:25,358 --> 01:38:27,609
This is it, so just shut up!

785
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,487
You bastard.

786
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:08,984
Excuse me? Somebody told me
that you could tell me where...

787
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:10,193
Excuse me?

788
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:13,196
-Someone told me that you...
-Hello.

789
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:16,533
I'm sorry. I'm Kathy Lutz
and I'm looking for Father Delaney.

790
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:21,038
Hi, I'm Father Bolen.

791
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,790
I believe the Father has gone
on his vacation.

792
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:25,834
He's been very overworked and...

793
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:29,880
I must speak to Father Delaney.
I simply must.

794
01:39:31,883 --> 01:39:35,469
You don't understand.
He's more than a priest to me.

795
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:36,637
He's like a friend of mine.

796
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:39,264
He's helped me through some
very difficult times in my life,

797
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:42,225
and I have to talk to him now!

798
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:46,938
It's out of my hands.

799
01:41:14,485 --> 01:41:15,986
Hello, Father.

800
01:41:17,947 --> 01:41:20,323
How are you feeling today?

801
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:34,254
I brought you some mail.
Would you like me to read it?

802
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:42,929
I notice there's one here
from a former patient.

803
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:45,015
Would you like to hear it?

804
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:57,110
It certainly is beautiful here.

805
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:03,784
Why don't I arrange
so we can have our lunch here?

806
01:42:03,868 --> 01:42:05,994
Would you like that, Father?

807
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:48,578
Excuse me, Father.
Can I have a word with you?

808
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:53,583
Of course, Sergeant.
What can I do for you?

809
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:57,671
Well, I don't really know, exactly.

810
01:42:57,755 --> 01:42:59,464
You know, it may be
just a wild goose chase,

811
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:01,508
but I'm the curious type.

812
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:04,511
Like the man says,
it goes with the territory.

813
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,012
Sergeant, I have a great deal
of work to do.

814
01:43:06,097 --> 01:43:08,265
Could you make your point, please?

815
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:11,643
I'd like to know what's happening
to Father Delaney.

816
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:14,604
You see, he's an old friend,
and I can't get the story right.

817
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,440
Well, there is no story to get right.

818
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:23,947
-Maybe I am just chasing shadows.
-Excuse me, please.

819
01:43:56,522 --> 01:43:58,857
I think this has all the good stuff,

820
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,817
I mean, the major coverage.

821
01:44:00,902 --> 01:44:02,527
If there's anything you need,
that you wanna see,

822
01:44:02,612 --> 01:44:03,695
I'll go back there and get it.

823
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:05,739
-No, I think this should be fine.
-Yeah, that's what I thought.

824
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:09,451
This is the November 14th issue.
That's the day after the murders.

825
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:11,661
Now, that crank over there?
You turn that crank...

826
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:12,996
-That one there?
-Right there.

827
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,581
-Okay. Fine.
-It advances the film.

828
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:16,666
Each frame is a whole page,

829
01:44:16,751 --> 01:44:19,628
and to get it in focus,
you just turn this knob right here.

830
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,921
-Okay, I've got it.
-Okay.

831
01:44:21,005 --> 01:44:23,632
-You all set now? Good.
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

832
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:51,451
Oh, my God. George.

833
01:46:57,828 --> 01:47:00,413
George! George!

834
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:02,165
George!

835
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:10,006
Matt! Greg! Matt!

836
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:09,858
Amy!

837
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:14,904
Amy?

838
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,787
Amy!

839
01:48:43,726 --> 01:48:45,185
Amy?

840
01:48:47,813 --> 01:48:50,690
Amy? Amy!

841
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:55,945
Stop!

842
01:48:58,490 --> 01:48:59,490
Mom!

843
01:49:11,712 --> 01:49:15,298
-Don't hurt my babies.
-Kathy?

844
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:28,645
I saw your picture in the newspaper.

845
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:29,854
It...

846
01:49:34,443 --> 01:49:36,819
Kathy, I wouldn't hurt you.

847
01:50:09,728 --> 01:50:13,231
- Oh, my God!
- Get going! Now! Get going!

848
01:50:19,321 --> 01:50:22,532
Go ahead! Hold on, hold on!

849
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:32,208
Hold on there. Go! Run!

850
01:50:37,548 --> 01:50:38,798
Hold on.

851
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:49,225
- George! Open it!
- I got it!

852
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:54,480
Something's coming. Please, open it!

853
01:50:54,732 --> 01:50:56,274
Go, go, go!

854
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:59,402
Mom!

855
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:22,091
The keys. Oh, God, where are the keys?

856
01:51:22,343 --> 01:51:24,385
What? Wait a minute.

857
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:36,898
I want Harry.

858
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:40,360
-Please, George, drive.
-Mom?

859
01:52:04,968 --> 01:52:09,013
George! No! No!

860
01:52:27,324 --> 01:52:29,283
Harry! Come on, boy!

861
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,125
Harry!

862
01:52:52,182 --> 01:52:53,975
Harry, come on!

863
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:56,436
Harry?

864
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:42,732
No, it's me!

865
01:53:48,405 --> 01:53:51,908
Harry, no! Harry!

866
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:54,952
Harry.

867
01:54:00,209 --> 01:54:01,918
Pull, Harry! Pull!

868
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:05,588
Harry.

869
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:10,301
Harry, pull!
