1
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,625
What's he doing?

2
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,544
Working.

3
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,775
It doesn't look anything
like the picture.

4
00:28:14,858 --> 00:28:16,442
Maybe it's been
modified.

5
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,568
The tail is wrong.

6
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:18,653
It's just backwards.

7
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,893
Why have you
failed me?

8
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,394
We're working.

9
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:17,064
Diligently.

10
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,066
I let you live.

11
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,278
This is how you repay me?

12
00:30:23,946 --> 00:30:26,280
It's very complex.

13
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,034
He's trying very hard.

14
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:30,410
On his knees.

15
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,750
You think I'm a fool?

16
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,794
I'll get the truth.

17
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,878
We're both working.

18
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,471
Open your mouth.

19
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:53,224
You think I'm a fool?

20
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,605
What's going on?

21
00:30:59,106 --> 00:31:01,607
Tell me the truth.

22
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,277
He's building your Jericho.

23
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:54,471
Where is Stark?

24
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:56,722
He was here a moment ago.

25
00:32:56,848 --> 00:32:57,932
Go look for him.

26
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,457
Hurry it up.

27
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,750
Put the women in the trucks.

28
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:30,876
Stack the weapons here.

29
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:31,961
Clear all the houses.

30
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,712
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

31
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:42,887
Grab that dog.

32
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,976
Put him with the others.

33
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,197
What the hell is this?

34
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,711
Shoot this dog.

35
01:17:13,878 --> 01:17:15,462
You're all incompetent.

36
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,800
Turn your head.

37
01:27:43,632 --> 01:27:46,592
This is the only gift
you shall receive.
