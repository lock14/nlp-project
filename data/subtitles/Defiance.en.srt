1
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:23,559
You want me not to help?

2
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,211
Bitch... You want vodka?

3
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:36,326
Working late, Bernicki.

4
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:38,788
Hunting Jews...

5
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,081
Our new bosses are very organized.

6
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,543
Hunting can work up a thirst.

7
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:50,174
Fifteen in one day...

8
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:51,081
Our new bosses are very organized.

9
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:59,433
500 roubles for every one we turn in.

10
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,477
A Jew is worth that much?

11
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,789
Do you pay more for a fat one?

12
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:06,491
500 roubles for every one we turn in.

13
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:11,946
Caught five in a ditch. Smelled so bad I
thought the Germans wouldn't want them.

14
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,490
Maybe for a reduced price.

15
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,576
You know the Bielskis?

16
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:21,621
We missed them
when we visited the parents.

17
00:12:24,876 --> 00:12:30,338
The wife doesn't like these long nights.

18
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,259
Keep it.

19
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:38,346
Bribing an officer of the law?
21
Hiding more of this black market vodka
in the barn?

20
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,770
Please, take a look.

21
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,607
And clean out the cow shit
while you're there.

22
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,830
Ah!

23
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,158
You'll keep your eyes open, yes?

24
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:05,666
Good hunting.

25
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,503
You worked late.

26
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,258
Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day off?
29
Fucking SS never sleeps...

27
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,101
You know who I am?

28
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:54,729
Sit!

29
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,899
You know why I'm here.

30
00:17:00,027 --> 00:17:02,570
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

31
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:07,825
lf they say find someone,
I find him. It's my job.

32
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,285
To kill Jews.

33
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,162
Or lose my job.

34
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,998
And you like your job.

35
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:17,250
I was always fair with your family.

36
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:22,798
Everyone knew you were smuggling.
I looked the other way.

37
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:25,968
Ask your father.

38
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,929
My father? You can ask my father.

39
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,598
On your knees.

40
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:34,101
On your knees!

41
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:37,270
Please... I beg you.

42
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:58,020
Collaborator.

43
00:25:58,897 --> 00:26:00,190
Traitor!

44
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:04,152
We are the Bielskis!

45
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:05,778
We'll be back.

46
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:13,287
My truck! Who did this?
Who are you?

47
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:15,580
This truck took away Jews.

48
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,835
The Germans made me use it.

49
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,760
It's one of ours,
but there is no one here.

50
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:37,621
Maybe he was drunk?

51
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:39,705
Look for him and hurry up!

52
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,249
We want to get to the party!

53
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,740
A-ha!

54
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,809
Asael!

55
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,609
Asael!

56
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:48,777
Hello Koscik.

57
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:53,032
In the barn.

58
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:17,389
JEW LOVER

59
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,650
I'm sorry.

60
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,362
Come.

61
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,760
Go.

62
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:40,134
Ssh...
Good morning. Early to market?

63
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:44,389
Could you spare us a little bit of milk?

64
00:39:45,224 --> 00:39:47,307
This is what I must give the Germans.

65
00:39:48,268 --> 00:39:53,356
lf I don't meet my quota,
they'll shoot me and my family.

66
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:06,661
Comrade, we are grateful
for your cooperation.
69
What a lovely coat.

67
00:46:08,815 --> 00:46:12,485
Leave now and we won't shoot all of you!

68
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:15,362
Don't be a fool.
There are hundreds of us!

69
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:18,990
There are hundreds of us!
Who is the fool?
73
Let's go!

70
00:49:29,782 --> 00:49:30,682
Who are you?

71
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:36,313
A brigade of independent fighters.

72
00:49:37,356 --> 00:49:38,648
What brigade?

73
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,670
The Bielski Otriad.
Ah!

74
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:46,798
We know of you. Jewish bandits.

75
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:51,786
I'm sure we can clear this up
with your commander.

76
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,929
We know of you. Jewish bandits.


77
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:26,070
I am Viktor Panchenko,
Commander of the October Otriad.

78
00:50:28,032 --> 00:50:36,039
We've heard of a Jewish gang
stealing from villages loyal to us.

79
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,753
How do you respond to these charges?

80
00:50:43,757 --> 00:50:51,764
When you take food, it is support.
When we do, it is stealing.

81
00:50:53,557 --> 00:50:56,851
We are soldiers of the Red Army.

82
00:50:57,269 --> 00:51:00,521
And we fight a common enemy.

83
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:07,653
The Motherland doesn't distinguish
between Jews and non-Jews.

84
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:13,452
But Jews do not fight.

85
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:17,081
These Jews do.

86
00:51:20,626 --> 00:51:22,878
We will see.

87
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:57,938
JEWISH LIVING AREA
DO NOT ENTER

88
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:26,215
Send us your best fighters.

89
00:51:27,925 --> 00:51:29,592
We are honored to be of service.

90
01:05:28,431 --> 01:05:33,353
Buried underneath
with this detonator,...

91
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:38,398
..almost touching the rail.

92
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:42,237
As the train passes its weight
causes pressure...

93
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,797
..on the detonator...

94
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,617
..and then...

95
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,969
Boom!

96
01:10:20,932 --> 01:10:22,600
You are related to Bielski?

97
01:10:22,725 --> 01:10:24,143
I am Bielski.

98
01:14:08,118 --> 01:14:12,162
More dead soldiers than empty bottles.

99
01:14:13,748 --> 01:14:15,123
That is so... Russian.

100
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:18,836
At least you drink like a Russian.

101
01:14:22,006 --> 01:14:25,926
A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.

102
01:14:27,304 --> 01:14:29,889
What is it we are good for, Viktor?

103
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:33,701
Dying.

104
01:14:36,854 --> 01:14:40,064
That's what we are good at.

105
01:14:41,193 --> 01:14:43,652
Tell me about this brother of yours.

106
01:14:44,988 --> 01:14:46,197
Oh, yes.

107
01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:50,576
The Great Tuvia Bielski,
Savior of the Jews,

108
01:14:50,702 --> 01:14:53,578
and all around big shit.

109
01:14:54,206 --> 01:14:55,288
You compete with him.

110
01:14:55,707 --> 01:14:57,750
He competes with me.

111
01:14:59,336 --> 01:15:02,128
My older brother and I
have the same relationship.

112
01:15:02,213 --> 01:15:04,715
He's a big shit also?

113
01:15:06,051 --> 01:15:07,176
A soldier.

114
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:13,349
He was killed in the first hour
of the German invasion.

115
01:19:35,153 --> 01:19:37,070
Every time we try to move,...

116
01:19:38,448 --> 01:19:41,033
..they radio back
to the transmitter at police HQ.

117
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:43,452
So we attack the transmitter.

118
01:19:43,787 --> 01:19:46,246
Yes, my Hebrew Warrior.

119
01:19:46,747 --> 01:19:49,082
Except the place
is swarming with police.

120
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,962
What's this, two Bielskis at once?

121
01:19:56,173 --> 01:19:58,091
To what do we owe this honor?

122
01:19:58,842 --> 01:20:01,345
We have sickness. I need ampicillin.

123
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:05,724
Medicine's only for fighters.

124
01:20:06,016 --> 01:20:11,354
If we have typhus
it may spread to your camp.

125
01:20:12,189 --> 01:20:15,525
I will have to take that chance.
I must insist.

126
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:17,903
Comrade.

127
01:20:19,713 --> 01:20:20,796
You'd better not.

128
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:27,037
There is medicine
in the Stankiewcze police station, yes?

129
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:31,917
Tuvia and I grew up there.

130
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:36,505
The Bielski Otriad
can destroy the transmitter.

131
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:01,115
Forgive me, Commander.

132
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:05,662
Zus. Join us.

133
01:28:07,664 --> 01:28:11,876
I want to report
the mistreatment of a comrade.

134
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:19,884
This man beat Comrade Lova
for no reason at all.

135
01:28:20,176 --> 01:28:21,552
I had a perfectly good reason.

136
01:28:22,596 --> 01:28:23,762
He is a Jew.

137
01:28:25,807 --> 01:28:28,350
And you are a savage.

138
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:30,686
Ignore him.

139
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:32,771
Let's drink.

140
01:28:36,694 --> 01:28:38,028
Anti-Semitism...

141
01:28:39,154 --> 01:28:40,947
..is a violation of Party discipline.

142
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:46,994
Gramov.

143
01:28:47,954 --> 01:28:49,456
Apologize to our comrade.

144
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,466
I apologize,

145
01:29:00,717 --> 01:29:02,510
Comrade Jew.

146
01:29:07,891 --> 01:29:10,726
Let's have a drink.

147
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:13,270
Drink!

148
01:41:32,899 --> 01:41:36,069
- He says he has a wife and children.
- So did I!

149
01:43:57,948 --> 01:44:00,407
The attack is coming.
We're leaving the forest.

150
01:44:00,908 --> 01:44:01,867
Leaving?

151
01:44:02,536 --> 01:44:04,537
What about the Bielski Otriad?

152
01:44:04,912 --> 01:44:05,912
What about them?

153
01:44:06,288 --> 01:44:07,957
They will be slaughtered.

154
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:12,127
My priority

155
01:44:12,587 --> 01:44:14,837
is the lives of Soviet soldiers.

156
01:44:15,798 --> 01:44:17,507
The Bielskis are sacrificed

157
01:44:17,801 --> 01:44:19,842
so that we can escape?

158
01:44:20,761 --> 01:44:22,887
Everyone must sacrifice

159
01:44:23,305 --> 01:44:26,516
so that we can keep fighting.

160
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:29,686
They're my brothers.

161
01:44:31,648 --> 01:44:34,942
We are all brothers.

162
01:44:36,278 --> 01:44:37,110
Comrade Bielski.

163
01:44:38,113 --> 01:44:41,698
Your Jewish sentimentality
is heart-warming,

164
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:44,243
but counter-revolutionary!

165
01:44:46,328 --> 01:44:48,872
You and your comrades
will follow Gramov,...

166
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,960
..and retreat as I have ordered!

167
01:44:56,088 --> 01:44:57,171
And if I don't?

168
01:44:57,966 --> 01:44:59,257
You'll be shot.

169
01:45:08,435 --> 01:45:09,268
Comrade Bielski.

170
01:45:13,606 --> 01:45:15,481
You are a soldier of the Motherland.

171
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:20,738
Thank you for the honor, Comrade.
