1
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,340
RIGHT AWAY

2
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,060
It was in 1975...

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,020
just before spring.

4
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,700
I was 19.

5
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,740
Time to go.

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,820
- What time is it?
- 9:10.

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,180
- Shit. What excuse will we give this time?
- Whatever.

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,540
- Want breakfast?
- Of course.

9
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,020
- It's me. Open up.
- I'm coming.

10
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,460
It stinks in here!

11
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,140
- Aren't you going to school?
- Yes.

12
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,060
- What are you doing then?
- I just missed the first hour.

13
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,020
Hurry up, then. I have to go, too.
I'm late. See you tonight.

14
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,620
- Coming? I have something to say to you.
- I have nothing to say to you.

15
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,980
- So I'll sit down.
- You're a pain in the ass!

16
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,140
- We're going in here.
- In here?

17
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,780
He won't bother us in here.

18
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,380
What did he do to you?

19
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,220
- Nothing. I just don't want to see him.
- You're exaggerating.

20
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,380
I don't want to see or talk to him, anymore.
He disgusts me.

21
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,820
But you slept with him.

22
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,580
So I slept with him. What's the big deal?

23
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,580
- I slept with him.
- Well, it's something.

24
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,540
That's just it. It's nothing.

25
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,460
- That's what disgusts me.
- May I?

26
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,340
I'm waiting for a friend. I'm a bit early.

27
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,860
- Cheers.
- We're here to eat.

28
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,060
No problem. What do you want?

29
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,340
- Sandwiches.
- No problem. What kind?

30
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,140
- Ham.
- No problem.

31
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,180
Can we get two ham sandwiches, please?

32
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,300
Nothing better than sandwiches
and champagne, right?

33
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,020
- Right.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,940
I'm going to guess your names.

35
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,580
Oh, there's my friend.
I've got to go. Too bad, eh?

36
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,100
But if you want, we could meet up tonight.
We'll be at Smoking...

37
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,940
on Pierre Charron Street. Ask for Gérard.

38
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,220
Gérard, that's me.

39
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,580
Be there, okay? Gérard.

40
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,340
How much?

41
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,820
Gérard took care of it.

42
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,020
Sketch this for me.

43
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,140
The silhouette, okay?

44
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,820
Just the silhouette. No face. Begin.

45
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,140
He said no face.

46
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,340
Did you make it to your class this morning?

47
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,340
Yes. I missed the first hour. No big deal.

48
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,300
No big deal, but if you keep it up...

49
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,140
Can't you wake each other up?

50
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,620
I'll remind you
that I go to the university, Dad.

51
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,620
Our schedules are different.

52
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Your mother called.

53
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,740
- She'll be in Paris next week.
- Will we see her?

54
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,820
I don't think she plans on it.

55
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,340
She sends you her love.

56
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm going to bed early. I'm beat.

57
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,700
- Maybe you'll get up on time tomorrow.
- Good night.

58
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
What do you think this guy's name is?

59
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,180
Ahmed. José.

60
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,060
- What do you think?
- I don't care.

61
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,700
- Ready to go?
- Where?

62
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,060
You know. Let's go.

63
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,260
Hello. We're here to see Gérard.

64
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,460
Seriously, how old are you guys?

65
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,700
- We'll tell you, if you tell us your age.
- 23.

66
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,700
23? That's pretty old.

67
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,540
And you?

68
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,780
She's 18. I'm 19.

69
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,500
That's funny, you don't look older than her.

70
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,500
- And your friend?
- Same age.

71
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,380
- Same as whom?
- As me.

72
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,900
- Do you work together?
- Yes.

73
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,220
What do you do?

74
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,300
Stuff, mostly real estate.

75
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,300
And what's your friend's name?

76
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,860
God, you're curious. Ask him yourself.
He'll tell you if he wants to.

77
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,940
I've got to go hang out with them a bit.

78
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,860
I'll be back.

79
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,300
Dance with me now.

80
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,820
- Who's that?
- Yeah, who's that?

81
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,140
- You drew it?
- Yeah.

82
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,060
What's your name?

83
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,020
Time for bed.

84
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,380
Can I turn off the light?

85
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,700
Move over.

86
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,700
- What?
- I'm going to class. It's time.

87
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,500
- I'm not.
- You're an idiot.

88
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,100
That's the way it is.

89
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,580
Wait, I'll show you out.

90
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,620
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

91
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,140
- Do you want breakfast?
- No.

92
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,660
- Are you going home?
- No.

93
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,100
Where do you live?

94
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,620
With my parents, like you.

95
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,860
I love you!

96
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,780
What's with all the cash?

97
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,340
It's just cash.

98
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,300
But do you always have so much?

99
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,180
- We do things, mostly real estate.
- You sell apartments?

100
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,780
- Yeah, for example.
- With Gérard?

101
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,380
Yeah, and others.

102
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,780
So why don't you have
your own apartment then?

103
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,100
I live with my parents. I like it there.

104
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,260
I'd love to have my own apartment.

105
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,420
It'll happen.

106
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,420
Be careful.

107
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,380
- Of what?
- I don't know. Just be careful.

108
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,020
It was the good life.

109
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,820
I don't know if it was real life.

110
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,580
It didn't happen, and I don't know...

111
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,700
In high school,
I never aced the entrance exams.

112
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
I'll get it.

113
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,340
You have two pieces
quite different from each other.

114
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,420
In one, you're...

115
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,420
Hello?

116
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,220
I'm calling to say goodbye.

117
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,820
Why goodbye?

118
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,420
Where are you?

119
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,460
Where are you?

120
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,940
I just robbed a bank.

121
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,260
We took hostages.

122
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,900
Gérard is dead.

123
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,300
A bank teller is dead.

124
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,780
We won't get out alive.

125
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,540
What are you saying? Are you crazy?

126
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,220
Listen...

127
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,460
I've got to go. I'm calling from the bank.
If you don't believe me, turn on your TV.

128
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,140
I'll try to call you back.

129
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,300
The deadly holdup occurred this afternoon,
in Place de la Nation.

130
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,940
Three gangsters...

131
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,580
killed the teller
who was attempting to trigger the alarm.

132
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,060
Police, making their usual rounds...

133
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,500
thwarted the thieves.

134
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,100
One was shot and killed instantly.

135
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,860
The two other robbers
took cover in the bank.

136
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,380
They are holding four people hostage...

137
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,260
and are negotiating with police.

138
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,340
They are communicating via telephone...

139
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,140
and seem particularly determined
and dangerous.

140
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,460
The gangsters are demanding two million
and a vehicle.

141
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,140
For now, the situation in front of the bank
is calm, surrounded by the police.

142
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,220
The wait continues.

143
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,900
Further developments will be presented
by Gérard Holtz at 10:15.

144
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,140
I wish you a nice evening.

145
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,260
Are you coming? Dinner's served.

146
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,740
- Aren't you hungry?
- No.

147
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,260
What's your sister doing tonight?

148
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,060
She went out. It's Friday.

149
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,460
That's right. It's Friday.

150
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,940
I must remember to give you
this week's allowance.

151
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,180
I'm okay. I still have some. Thanks, Dad.

152
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,660
Are you going out, too?

153
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,740
Yes, but not for long.

154
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,300
BANK

155
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,780
Back up, please.

156
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,380
What's going on?

157
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,140
They're coming out with the hostages.

158
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,420
...17th borough.

159
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,500
They drove around awhile...

160
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,540
to ensure they weren't being followed.

161
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,940
They stopped
in the Meridien hotel parking lot.

162
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,780
There, the two men got out...

163
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,300
and told the woman driving...

164
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,700
to circle the place for 10 minutes...

165
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,340
otherwise, they'd open fire.

166
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,660
- Hello?
- It's me.

167
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,420
Yes?

168
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,860
We left the hostages
at Porte de la Chapelle station.

169
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,300
It's okay. They're not hurt.

170
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,940
We don't know where to go.

171
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,180
- Can we come to your house?
- Yes.

172
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,300
Then we're coming.

173
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,980
Leave the service door open.
Stay in your room.

174
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,660
See you right away.

175
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,340
You have to make a phone call.

176
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,260
Right now?

177
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,700
Where's the phone?

178
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,060
In the hall.

179
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,860
Go and tell him to bring the car.

180
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,860
Here's the number.

181
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,140
Go on.

182
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,220
He says to tell you to bring the car.

183
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,060
Can you give me the address?

184
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,980
12 Eugéne Labiche Street.

185
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,100
Third floor. Buzz and I'll let you in.

186
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,260
He's coming.

187
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,580
We're leaving. We've got to leave.

188
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,580
Yes.

189
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,580
- Do you want to come with me?
- Yes.

190
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,660
You don't need to say yes.

191
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,580
You can say no, if you want.
I'm not forcing you.

192
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,620
I know.

193
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,700
If you don't come, I'll come back for you.

194
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
I don't know when, but I'll come back.

195
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,460
If you want me to come, I'll come.

196
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,220
Get your things.

197
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,780
Come in.

198
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,220
- You'll be here tonight?
- Yes, of course.

199
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,500
- Where are we?
- On the Champs Élysées.

200
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,980
I'm suffocating under here.

201
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,460
It's okay. Everything's calm.

202
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,740
Stop. Let me drive.

203
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,860
You can come out, too.

204
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,020
There's no point in hiding
unless you both do.

205
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,780
It's not good to kill.

206
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,660
Shut up. You didn't kill.

207
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,660
Yes, we did.

208
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,820
We're killers.

209
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,900
Who did the killing?

210
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,900
Him or you?

211
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,740
It's the same thing.

212
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,700
We killed.

213
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,940
We're killers.

214
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,820
For me.

215
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,780
Will the pharmacists go on strike?
It's quite possible...

216
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,780
There's absolutely nothing.

217
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,900
...strike starting...

218
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,940
They forgot.

219
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,860
...you know, a conflict...

220
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,060
We've got to leave.

221
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,500
Can't stay here.

222
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,820
...what's known as mutualist pharmacies.

223
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,300
We thought we were Robin Hoods.

224
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,180
Belleville was a slough. It was dirty.

225
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,140
It was poor.

226
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,620
Thanks to us, the whole neighborhood
had color TVs and Dupont lighters.

227
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,780
What did your parents say?

228
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,660
Nothing.

229
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,620
That wasn't supposed to happen.

230
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,900
Gérard.

231
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,140
They shot him like a rabbit.

232
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,300
And that father, the teller.

233
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,660
Didn't your parents notice?

234
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,180
I don't know.

235
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,420
- What do they do?
- They own a hair salon.

236
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,100
My parents adore me.

237
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,260
I adore them.

238
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,660
And they adore each other.

239
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,140
You notice what you want, you know.

240
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,420
You're lucky.

241
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,020
If I'm found, I'm a dead man.

242
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,340
Sleep.

243
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,540
Do you have identification photos?

244
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,100
No. Why?

245
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,660
I'm just asking. To leave.

246
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,620
No, I don't.

247
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,780
There's a photo machine
in the subway station nearby.

248
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,260
Go on. It'll take 10 minutes.

249
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,060
I don't want to go alone.

250
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,780
I'll go, too, after. I don't have any, either.

251
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,540
- Come with me. Let's go together.
- We can't.

252
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,900
Come with me.

253
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,620
What should we do now?

254
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,620
- We're going back.
- No.

255
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,540
- We're going back.
- No.

256
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,500
Eat something. You haven't eaten for days.

257
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,140
I'm not hungry.

258
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,500
Eat, my love.

259
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,340
- Branco! Branco!
- It's a transvestite?

260
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,500
Go on, punch them out!

261
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Wait.

262
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,460
I want to see how prepared you are...

263
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,980
I threw up.

264
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,860
- What's wrong?
- I'm scared.

265
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,380
You think now's the time
to strut your stuff outside?

266
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,500
Are you stupid or what?

267
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,340
It's my fault.

268
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,060
Be careful. Don't lose your head.

269
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,700
They fought?

270
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,940
No. Almost.

271
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,140
This is my place.

272
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,700
Hello.

273
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,340
Hello.

274
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,260
You sleep up there?

275
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,500
No, I never go up there.

276
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,340
But I couldn't sleep.

277
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,740
Is everyone else asleep?

278
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,780
Yes.

279
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,460
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

280
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,220
That's a funny name. It's strange.

281
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,700
Don't forget it.

282
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,260
Show me yours.

283
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,260
- Who's that?
- Who's who?

284
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,260
I don't know. Just a person.

285
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,500
We're leaving.

286
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,460
- When?
- Tonight.

287
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be arriving shortly at Hendaye station.

288
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,700
Hendaye, three-minute stop.

289
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,940
We remind you that this train
is destined for Irún.

290
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,500
There's only one. He got on the first car.

291
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,100
Go to the end. Show your ticket.

292
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,980
Once he's seen it, get off.

293
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,700
I'll wait for you at the other end
and give you the bag. Okay?

294
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,300
Wait for me.

295
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,340
- I'll come back to show my ticket after.
- Wait. I'll go.

296
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,060
French Customs. Passport, please.

297
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,260
Thank you.

298
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,180
French Customs. Passport, please.

299
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,780
Thank you.

300
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,860
- Thank you.
- Are you traveling together?

301
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

302
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,740
- Thank you. Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

303
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,140
You'll go through Spanish Customs
before changing trains.

304
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,100
Should I go?

305
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,780
- They went out?
- Yes.

306
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
They went to buy themselves some clothes.

307
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,980
We're meeting them for lunch.

308
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,300
Look.

309
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,620
They left us this.

310
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,860
For what?

311
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,940
We're going shopping.

312
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,180
We're going to buy some clothes, too.
Don't you want to?

313
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,660
- Sure.
- We've got to buy stockings.

314
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,780
We've got to buy stockings for us and them.

315
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,780
Where are we meeting them?

316
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,260
Don't worry. I have the address.

317
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,980
Come next door with me.
Their breakfast looks really good.

318
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,060
I'm coming.

319
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,940
You're like me. You're bourgeois.

320
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,340
It's funny that we're with guys like them.

321
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,780
- What kind of guys?
- You know, criminals.

322
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,740
We're not made for this.

323
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,180
- I guess we are.
- You think?

324
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,620
Well, we're here. You'd rather be elsewhere?

325
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,420
No. And you?

326
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,900
No.

327
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,180
We're criminelles.

328
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,060
Is that how you say it?

329
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,180
Criminals, criminelles.

330
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,780
- Are you sure you don't want to come?
- Yes. Really, I don't have time.

331
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,220
- He won't be happy.
- It's okay. He knows.

332
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,340
Do you want me to drop you off?

333
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,140
No, I'll walk. It's not far, I think.

334
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,860
I'll figure it out.
You're okay with bringing everything back?

335
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,180
No, really, tell me.
Why didn't you meet us for lunch?

336
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,300
It's nothing. I just didn't want to see you
with the others. That's all.

337
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,220
What do we do if we're separated?

338
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,580
What do you mean?

339
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,020
If you need to flee, suddenly...

340
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,980
and I'm not with you at the time.
I can't find you. What do I do?

341
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,100
In a foreign country? Like now?

342
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,820
Stay where you are.

343
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,620
And then?

344
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,100
Then I'll know where to find you.

345
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,100
I'll come get you. Quickly.

346
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,860
- Where are we going?
- To my home.

347
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,940
- Where's that?
- Where my family is from.

348
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,220
- Morocco?
- Yeah.

349
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,180
Come on, let's go outside.

350
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,540
What?

351
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,500
Nothing. It was just an idea.

352
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,300
Excuse me.

353
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,860
Can I ask you
what you'll be doing in Morocco?

354
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,100
We're going to visit friends. Why?

355
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,660
- You're staying with them?
- It's possible.

356
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,580
Do you have money?

357
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,340
Sorry, sir. That's fine.

358
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,940
With all the people coming to live
in our country without a cent...

359
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,940
Once again, I apologize. Have a nice trip.

360
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,900
I can't keep them on me. It's too dangerous.

361
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,380
- There's no more room in my jeans.
- Take them!

362
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,740
There's no risk if you have them.

363
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,740
- Where do I put them all?
- Put them in your bag!

364
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:30,620
CUSTOMS

365
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,060
First, we stayed in Tangier.

366
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,540
We lived in a luxurious hotel.

367
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,580
It was the nicest in the city.
That's what I was told, and I can believe it.

368
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,060
Then we rented cars.

369
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,580
We drove to one village after another.

370
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,140
Usually, they were by the sea,
but not always.

371
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,700
It was like a holiday, our first holiday.

372
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,060
Maybe the only one I'd ever have.

373
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,460
An eternal holiday. Weeks, months.

374
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,660
Sometimes, they'd leave in turns.

375
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,380
They went to convert the cash.
It wasn't going well.

376
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,140
The bills were undoubtedly marked.
We couldn't use them all that much.

377
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,580
They had to be sold for below price.

378
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,260
There were guys for that,
in London, in Brussels.

379
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,980
He told me nothing...

380
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,820
but I knew things weren't going well.

381
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:59,100
It's happened.

382
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,460
These are the killers

383
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,940
We had to be careful with the money.

384
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,180
We believed we were rich,
yet it was less and less certain.

385
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,540
Not right away.

386
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,100
We rented an apartment
in Casablanca, in Casa.

387
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,900
The holiday was over.

388
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,180
God damn it! Can't you cover up?

389
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,340
- I'm sick of seeing your ass all day!
- Take a cold shower if you're in heat!

390
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,340
Get in.

391
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,700
Where will we go after?

392
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,700
After what?

393
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,340
When we can go wherever we want.

394
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,980
I don't know. Wherever you want.

395
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,500
Okay. But you, where would you like to go?

396
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,060
I don't know.

397
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,580
Maybe...

398
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,900
an island.

399
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,860
- A deserted island?
- No.

400
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,300
An island with people and everything...

401
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,660
but still an island.

402
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,820
Really?

403
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,660
I don't know. Where do you want to go?
I answered.

404
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,820
Where are you going like that?
Come back here!

405
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,460
Where are you going?

406
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:07,060
Fucking whore!

407
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,020
Where is he?

408
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,020
We've got to leave.

409
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,860
A guy stopped me in the street.

410
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:29,820
He said something strange. I don't like it.

411
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,740
Anyway, Casa is too small. We'll get caught.

412
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,060
- What do you want it for?
- Take it off.

413
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,180
I'll buy you 10 more.

414
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,300
Excuse me.

415
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,220
There are lots of islands. Look.

416
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,500
I'm scared.

417
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,420
- Scared of what?
- I'm scared.

418
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,260
But of what?

419
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,820
Of everything. I'm sure of it. I'm very scared.

420
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,820
Stop it. Nothing's going to happen.

421
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,700
Greece.

422
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,940
Athens.

423
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,300
I noticed that you had problems with
Customs.

424
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,500
I did, too, because of the visa.
They're such a pain.

425
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,500
I'm Lebanese.

426
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,340
Are you French?

427
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,860
My name is Georges.

428
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,060
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

429
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,260
- Did you reserve a hotel room?
- No.

430
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,860
Where's your suitcase?

431
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,420
Someone stole it.

432
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,340
Did you declare the theft?

433
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,540
- No.
- Why not?

434
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,500
Okay, listen.

435
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,100
If you want, I'll bring you to my hotel.

436
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,460
It's not high season.
I'm sure there'll be a room.

437
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,860
Okay?

438
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,420
Yes.

439
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,340
Come.

440
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,980
- Do you have any money?
- No.

441
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,620
Come.

442
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,500
Do you have your passport?

443
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,460
Eat. It'll do you good.

444
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,300
Okay...

445
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,980
I'm going to a friend's house.

446
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,980
Eat and sleep. You'll see,
tomorrow everything will be just fine.

447
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,100
You didn't eat a thing.

448
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,940
Have a croissant. They're good.

449
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,380
I've got to leave.

450
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,100
You know my Greek friend,
the man I dined with last night...

451
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,580
he's looking for a babysitter.

452
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,940
He's divorced and has custody of the child.

453
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:14,700
His little boy is 5.

454
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,700
He's willing to let you live in his house...

455
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,900
until your problems are sorted out.

456
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,700
First, he wants to meet you.

457
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:28,740
That's normal, isn't it?

458
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,860
Here's his phone number.

459
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,260
Everything is written here.

460
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,100
Do you have all the toiletries you need?

461
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,540
Wait, I'll bring you two or three things.

462
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,980
There. I think that's all you need.

463
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,140
I also brought you this.

464
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,940
I noticed you didn't have a watch.

465
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,060
I'm going.

466
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,300
- The plane won't wait for me.
- Thank you.

467
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,500
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

468
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,460
Thank you.

469
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:04,580
- Can you start today?
- Yes, okay.

470
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,420
What's your boy's name?

471
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:12,700
His name is Dimitri. He's 7.

472
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,700
Is that all you have with you?

473
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,260
My suitcase was stolen at the airport.

474
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,460
I have nothing anymore,
but it's not a problem.

475
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:36,100
You can't stay like that.

476
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,380
Come on.

477
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,180
How's it going?

478
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:06,860
Your room.

479
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,980
Where's Dimitri?

480
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,540
He lives with his mother.

481
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:23,700
I get him only on weekends.

482
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,740
- Georges told me he lived with you.
- Are you hungry?

483
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,980
We're going out to eat.
Change your clothes, if you want.

484
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,700
But I'm telling you, I won't touch you.

485
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,020
- No, not tonight.
- I just want to sleep.

486
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,340
Tomorrow I'll slide into bed with you.

487
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,380
I promise, okay?

488
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:15,900
I promise.

489
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,740
Fine. Okay.

490
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,620
What's going on? Are you okay?

491
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:01,260
Yes, I'm fine. Sorry, it was nothing.

492
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,860
Are you sure?

493
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:06,540
- You don't need me?
- No, no.

494
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,180
Sorry. I'm fine.

495
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,220
I'm going back to sleep.

496
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,220
Are you awake?

497
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:33,900
Are you sleeping?

498
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,820
No, I just woke up.

499
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,980
Okay, listen.

500
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,620
I'm going to work.

501
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,340
I'm in a rush.

502
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,260
I'm locking you in, okay?

503
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,740
No, don't. How will I do the shopping?

504
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,100
What shopping?

505
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,660
The fridge is full.

506
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:56,580
I don't know. Beauty stuff. Things I need.

507
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,780
Don't worry, I'll be here tonight.

508
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,180
Fine...

509
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,340
I'm leaving the key on the buffet.

510
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,300
Oh, you're French.

511
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,700
What's your name?

512
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,740
Are you here on holidays?

513
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,020
Yes.

514
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,180
I love Greece. I'm out of money.

515
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,060
I want to stay. I'm looking for work.

516
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,260
I work in a boutique.
They need an employee.

517
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,660
We can talk to my boss.

518
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:07,620
- Now?
- Sure. Why not?

519
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:10,980
Come.

520
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,620
There's a room at my place.

521
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,580
A guy lived there but he left.

522
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,300
You can come.

523
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:27,980
Yes or no?

524
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:31,660
Say yes.

525
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:04,220
Are you all settled in?

526
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,900
I'm going to bed.

527
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,820
Good night.

528
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:28,740
Who's that man?

529
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,500
A policeman, obviously.

530
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,660
- Why's he here?
- Why not? He's a friend of the boss.

531
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,580
Why are you scared?

532
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,980
I'm a fugitive.

533
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:47,180
No, just kidding.

534
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,180
You should watch out. You'll burn.

535
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:25,060
Does it hurt?

536
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,060
It burns a little.

537
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:38,900
Don't look at me like that.
You're scaring me.

538
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:08,820
You're from Paris?

539
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,740
I am. He's from Blois.

540
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:14,140
I'm from Paris.

541
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,180
We met each other here.

542
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,380
Are you going home soon?

543
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:24,820
Tomorrow. Our holidays are over.

544
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,900
Do you live in Athens all year?

545
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:35,620
- No, I'm waiting for someone.
- Oh.

546
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:11,580
Don't touch me.

547
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,900
Do you want me to leave?

548
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,340
No.

549
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,260
It's okay like this.

550
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,620
Tell them the sentence
I taught you in Greek.

551
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,140
Once more, my darling.

552
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,700
Are you coming?

553
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:22,980
No, I'm staying here.

554
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,700
- Don't be stupid. Come.
- I said no. I'll see you at your place.

555
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,380
What'll you do? You don't have any money.

556
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,900
I'll find a way.

557
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,220
Okay.

558
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:37,980
See you later.

559
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,420
I called my father.

560
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:03,980
In Paris?

561
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:05,500
Yes.

562
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,300
You spoke to him?

563
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:09,820
Yes.

564
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:17,140
To my sister, first, and my dad.
He's coming to get me.

565
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:20,780
- When?
- Tomorrow.

566
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,220
There he is. My mother's here.

567
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,300
They sentenced him to death.
Forever on the run...

568
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,060
over there...

569
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:12,740
at the end of the world, or here, so close.
I didn't know.

570
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,140
I waited.

571
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:17,540
They sentenced me to two years of prison.

572
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:21,500
Lawyer, court, trial, judge.

573
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,780
I didn't go to jail.

574
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,020
Presidential pardon.

575
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:28,860
Five years of probation.

576
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,100
They said my name.

577
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,860
I didn't care.

578
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,500
I waited.

579
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:37,340
I waited for him.

580
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:38,780
No one came.

581
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:45,980
I lived alone to be alone.

582
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,060
I wanted to kill myself.

583
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:49,620
I tried...

584
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:50,780
several times.

585
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:53,580
But, no. I waited.

586
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:56,100
I could no longer stand being alone.

587
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:59,700
I lived with my sister. We talked a lot.

588
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,820
She was there. And me, I waited.

589
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:32,420
- Are you having supper with Mother?
- Yes.

590
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,940
Do you want to come with me?
I'll wait for you, if you want.

591
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:37,940
No. I'm seeing her tomorrow, anyway, so...

592
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,340
- Bye.
- Bye.

593
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,700
You know, we don't have only one life.
We have several.

594
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,860
Several at once?

595
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:01,700
At once, or consecutively.

596
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,460
For men, it's usually at once.
For women, consecutively.

597
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:07,700
In any case, there are several.

598
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:15,140
And what if there's only one real one?

599
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:28,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

600
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:30,500
Come in.

601
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,020
I don't know any more than you do.

602
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:41,300
I know nothing.

603
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,540
You fixed the chair?

604
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,540
I've been thinking of you for a long time.

605
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,140
You took your time coming back here.

606
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,340
I don't like asking.

607
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:15,260
Where's the hair salon?

608
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,860
The hair salon?

609
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,660
It's near Belleville Street.

610
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:23,660
Where?

611
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:28,820
Des Rigoles Street.
But it's useless. Believe me.

612
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:36,740
- You're going to work?
- Well, yeah. I have to.

613
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,220
- Will you give me your phone number?
- Why?

614
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:44,220
I don't know. If I have something to tell you.

615
01:25:45,220 --> 01:25:47,260
- You don't want to?
- Yes, I do.

616
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,740
My name is Laurence.

617
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,060
Take a seat.

618
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,980
Come.

619
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:08,700
Eat. It's good.

620
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,940
Come.

621
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:30,740
I don't know, my girl. I don't know.

622
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,860
- Despite the police officer's warnings...
- Stop.

623
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,900
...he did not stop
and was killed by a bullet in the heart.

624
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,180
Sentenced to death for contumacy...

625
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,780
he was wanted for the holdup...

626
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,940
Stop!

627
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,260
There's someone on the phone for you.

628
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,300
- Who is it?
- Laurence.

629
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:20,500
Tell her I'm coming.

630
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:23,100
What'll you do now?

631
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:24,780
I've got to find a job.

632
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,860
- What kind of job?
- I don't know.

633
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,140
Far away.

634
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:35,220
A job, but far away.

635
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,500
- In a foreign country?
- Yes.

636
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,980
Are you allowed, with your probation?

637
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,380
Yes, if the employer is located here.

638
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,860
Okay, I'll call you back.

639
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:54,020
- When?
- Soon. I'll call you back.

640
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,980
And you've previously stayed
in one of our clubs?

641
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:01,620
Yes, on vacation with my mother, in Sicily.

642
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,900
What was that place called?

643
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:05,940
It's slipped my mind.

644
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:08,780
Cefalù.

645
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:11,340
That's it. Cefalù.

646
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:15,740
So you know how it works?

647
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:19,180
The key is to put yourself
in the shoes of each guest.

648
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,020
You must anticipate what they want
before even they know it.

649
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,900
- Do you think you can do that?
- Yes.

650
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:25,340
Yes?

651
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:32,340
Plus, it's exactly what I need,
to put myself in the shoes of others.

652
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:33,980
Really?

653
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:37,140
And where would you like to go?

654
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:41,460
If I could choose, I'd go to an island.

655
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:44,860
There's no shortage of islands.
