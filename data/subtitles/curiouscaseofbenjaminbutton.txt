2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,300
What are you looking at, Caroline?
-The wind, mom.

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,600
They say a hurricane is coming.

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,200
I feel like I'm on a boat...
drifting.

5
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,700
Can I do anything for you, mom?
Make anything easier?

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,300
Oh, sugar. There is
nothing left to do.

7
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,400
It is what it is.

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm finding it harder
to keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,900
My mouth's full of... cotton.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,000
There, there, miss Daisy.
You will scratch yourself to ribbons.

11
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,700
Do you want any more
medication, mother?

12
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,400
Doctor said you can
have as much as you want.

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,400
No need for anybody to suffer.

14
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,900
A friend told me that...

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,500
she never had a chance to say
goodbye to her mother.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,300
I wanted to tell you...

17
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,500
how much I'm gonna miss you.
Mom.

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,900
Oh, Caroline.

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,400
Are you afraid?
-I'm curious.

20
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,000
What comes next...

21
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,400
They built that train
station in 1918.

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
Our father was there
the day it opened.

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,900
He said that...

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,700
a tuba band was playing.

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,600
They had the finest clockmaker
in all of the South

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,200
to build that glorious clock.

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,100
His name was

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Mr Gateau.

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,700
Mr Cake.

30
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,300
He was married to a Creole
of Evangeline Parish

31
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,400
and they had a son.

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,800
Mr Gateau was from birth
absolutely blind.

33
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,200
When their son was old enough,
he joined the army.

34
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,500
They prayed God would keep him
out of harm's way.

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,300
For months, he did nothing
but work on that clock.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,200
One day a letter came.

37
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:58,500
Mr Gateau, done for the night,
went up alone to bed.

38
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,900
And their son came home.

39
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,700
They burried him
in a family plot

40
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,900
where he would be with them
when their time came.

41
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,700
Mr Cake worked on his clock,

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,200
laboring to finish.

43
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,800
It was a morning to remember.

44
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,300
Papa said there were
people everywhere.

45
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,300
Even Teddy Roosevelt came.

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,700
It's running backwards!

47
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,400
I made it that way.

48
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,900
So that perhaps the boys
that we lost in a war

49
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,800
might stand and
come home again.

50
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,000
Home to farm,

51
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
work,

52
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,500
have children,

53
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,700
to live long, full lives.

54
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,300
Perhaps my own son
might come home again.

55
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,100
I'm sorry if I offended anybody.

56
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,800
I hope you enjoy my clock.

57
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,900
Mr Cake was never seen again.

58
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,900
Some say he died
of a broken heart.

59
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,500
Some say he went to sea...

60
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,500
Excuse me, do you mind
if I make a call?

61
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,500
Somebody's watching
my little boy. -Sure.

62
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,000
I hope I haven't
disappointed you.

63
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
You couldn't disappoint me.

64
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, I...

65
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,500
I know I don't have much
to show for myself.

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
The suitcase.

67
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,500
There's a diary.

68
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,300
This?

69
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,400
Could you read it to me, dear?
-Is this what you wanna do?

70
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,300
I tried to read it a hundred
different times...

71
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,000
Mom, it's not exactly...

72
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,900
Just the sound of
your voice, darling.

73
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,800
It's dated "April 4th, 1985."

74
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,700
It says, "New Orleans."

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
This is my last will
and testament.

76
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,200
I don't have much to leave,
few possessions, no money really.

77
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,000
I will go out of this world
the same way I came in,

78
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,100
alone and with nothing.
All I have is my story.

79
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm writing it now
while I still remember it.

80
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,100
My name is Benjamin.
Benjamin Button.

81
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,800
And I was born under
unusual circumstances.

82
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,000
The first world war had ended.

83
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,300
I've been told it was an
especially good night to be born.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,300
We won the war!

85
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,800
What are you doing here?
-Thomas...

86
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm afraid she's gonna die.
-What?

87
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,000
That's enough! All of you!
Get away from her!

88
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,300
I came as quickly as I could.
The streets are filled with people.

89
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Thomas, promise me
he has a place...

90
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,700
Yeah.

91
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,500
She gave her life for me.

92
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,100
And for that,
I am forever grateful.

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,900
Mr Button...!

94
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
Thomas!

95
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,400
Thomas, wait!

96
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Hey, what are you doing there!?
What do you have there?

97
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,300
The air is sweet.

98
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,400
You look very handsome
tonigh, miss Queenie.

99
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Handsome as I ever seen you.

100
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,500
The brown matches your eyes.
-Oh, hush!

101
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,800
You ain't no slouch yourself.

102
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,700
Hambert's back in town.
He came home legless...

103
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,300
but he home... I know you was
sweet on him one time...

104
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,900
Sweeter than I shoulda been...
-Miss Simone messed herself.

105
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,100
Sweet Jesus! She got to stop
doing that, or it's diapers for her.

106
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,500
-I'll be right there!
-C'mon, it's awful nice out here.

107
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,300
Come out back for a moment,
take your mind off things.

108
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
What in God's name...!?

109
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Oh, the Lord done
something here...!

110
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,900
I hope I didn't hurt it none,
steppin' on it like that.

111
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
We best leave that for
the police. -Oh, baby.

112
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,800
I'll go.

113
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,000
It's for sure nobody wanted
to keep it. Come on, baby.

114
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,300
Quennie!
-Hold your water!

115
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
I'll be back.

116
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,000
She went and messed
herself all over again...

117
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
Jane Childress, start her a bath.

118
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,800
And mind your own
business, Mrs Duprey.

119
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,000
You'll be messing yourself
soon enough.

120
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
Somebody stole my necklace.

121
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,500
OK, Mrs Hollister, I'll be right
with you. Go on back upstairs.

122
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,000
You are as ugly as an old pot,
but you still a child of God.

123
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,700
Queenie, she won't go
take a bath without you.

124
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Mercy... I'll be right there!

125
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,000
You just wait right
here for me, okay?

126
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,200
My sister gave me those pearls.
I can't find them anywhere.

127
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,800
Somebody's been
stealing my jewelry.

128
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,500
They are right here,
Mrs Hollister. See?

129
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,300
Right around your pretty
white neck. Now come on.

130
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,800
Your heart is strong. You want
to avoid any undue stimulation.

131
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,600
I trust you ladies will
help me out with that?

132
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,500
I've never seen anything like it,
nearly blind from cataracts.

133
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not sure if he can hear,
bones indicate severe arthritis.

134
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,600
His skin has lost all elasticity
and his hands and feet are ossified.

135
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,700
He shows all the deterioration,

136
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,300
the infirmities not of
a newborn, but of a man

137
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,300
well in his eighties on his way
to the grave. -He's dying?

138
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,100
His body's failing him
before his life's begun.

139
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Where did he come from?
-It's my sister's child.

140
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,100
From Lafayette. She had
an unfortunate adventure.

141
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,300
Poor child, he got the worse of it.
Come out white.

142
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,900
There are places for 'unwanted'
babies like these, Queenie.

143
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,000
No room for another
mouth to feed here.

144
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,800
The Nolan Foundation,
despite their good intentions,

145
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
thinks this place is a large
nuisance as it is. A baby...

146
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
You said he don't have long.

147
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,600
Queenie, some creatures
aren't meant to survive.

148
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,500
No, this baby here is a
miracle, that's for certain.

149
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,300
Just not the kind of miracle
one hopes to see.

150
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,700
Now listen! Listen up here!
We gonna have us a visitor

151
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,500
that's gonna be staying
with us for a little while.

152
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,700
My sister had a child, but she
couldn't see right by it. So...

153
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,500
He's known as...

154
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,000
Benjamin.

155
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,900
Benjamin...
He's not a well child,

156
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,700
so we're gonna have to
take good care of him.

157
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,700
I had ten children, there's
not a baby I can't care for.

158
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,100
Let me see him.

159
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Oh, God in heaven, he looks
just like my ex husband.

160
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,500
Look, he's prematurely old.

161
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,500
Doctor Rose said he ain't got
much more time on this earth.

162
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,000
Join the club.

163
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, smile!

164
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Hambert sends his
remembrances to you.

165
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,400
Are you right out of your mind?

166
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,900
I know you ain't got all the parts
it takes to make one of your own,

167
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,100
but this ain't yours to keep,
it may not even be human kind.

168
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Mr Weathers, come back here!

169
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,800
Please.

170
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,500
"You never know
what's comin' for you."

171
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,300
It seemed I'd found a home.

172
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Is any of this true?

173
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,800
You have such a lovely voice.

174
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,400
Mom, there's an ancient
streetcar token.

175
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,900
That clock just kept going,

176
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
year after year after year...

177
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,300
I didn't know I was a child.
-Same old crap every day.

178
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,100
I thought I was like
everyone else there.

179
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,400
An old man in a
twilight of his life.

180
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,100
Stop bangin' that fork. It's used
for eating, not for playin' with.

181
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,700
And use your napkin,
please Mr. Benjamin.

182
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
Queenie!

183
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,400
Hey, boy!

184
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,400
I always had a healthy curiosity.

185
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
What was up the street,
or around the next corner?

186
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Benjamin! That is dangerous.
Come back over here!

187
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,000
Stay put, child!

188
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I loved her very much.
She was my mother.

189
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,200
Momma... momma!

190
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,300
Some days I feel different
than the day before.

191
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,900
Everybody feels different about
themselves one way or another.

192
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,400
But we're all goin' the same way.

193
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,600
Just taking different roads
to get there, that's all.

194
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,100
You're on your own road,
Benjamin.

195
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
Momma, how much longer I got?

196
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,400
Just be thankful for
what you're given.

197
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,100
You already here longer
than you supposed to.

198
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,200
Some nights,
I'd have to sleep alone.

199
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,900
I didn't mind. I would listen
to the house breathing.

200
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
All those people sleeping.

201
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,100
I felt safe.

202
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
It was a place of great routine.

203
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,300
Every morning at 5:30
no matter the weather,

204
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,500
General Winslow, US army
retired, raised the flag.

205
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,300
Mrs Sybil Wagner, once an
opera singer of some note,

206
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,700
well, she sang Wagner.

207
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Alright, c'mon.

208
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,400
We gotta put some life into
these old sticks for you.

209
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,900
get you walkin'.

210
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,900
No matter the season, supper
was served promptly at 5:30.

211
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,000
Mol-asses...
-Molasses.

212
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,200
Molasses.

213
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,900
I learned to read
when I was five.

214
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,800
My grandfather was
a dresser for a famous actor.

215
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,600
He brought home every
play for me to read.

216
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,600
"Kind keepers of my
weak decaying age

217
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,400
let dying Mortimer
here rest himself.

218
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Even like a man new
haled from the rack.

219
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,900
So fare my limbs with
long imprisonment.

220
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,000
And these gray locks,
the pursuivants of death,

221
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,000
argue the end of
Edmund Mortimer."

222
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,500
You thought I was
plain ignorant, didn't you?

223
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,200
The actor my grandfather worked
for was John Wilkes Booth.

224
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
He killed Abraham Lincoln.

225
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,300
You never know
what's coming for you.

226
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,100
On saturday nights, momma
would make me go to church.

227
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,300
Benjamin!

228
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,600
Amen!

229
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,700
What can I do for you, sister?

230
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Her parts are all
twisted up inside,

231
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,300
she can't have little children.

232
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Lord, if you could see clear
to forgive this woman her sins

233
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,900
so she can bear
the fruit of the womb.

234
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,300
Out damnable affliction!
Praise God!

235
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,800
Hallelujah!

236
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,400
And what's this old
man's irrediction?

237
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,000
He's got the devil on his back,

238
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
trying to ride him into
the grave before his time.

239
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,800
Out, Zebuchar!
Out, Beelzebub!

240
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
How old are you?

241
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Seven, but I look a lot older.

242
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,500
God bless you.
He's seven!

243
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,500
Now, this is a man with
optimism in his heart!

244
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Belief in his soul!

245
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,800
We are all children
in the eyes of God!

246
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,900
We are gonna get you
out of that chair.

247
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,700
And we're gonna have you walk.
-It's all right.

248
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,800
In the name of God's glory,
rise up!

249
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,000
Come on!

250
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Come on, man!

251
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,000
Now God is gonna see you
the rest of the way.

252
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
He's gonna see this
little old man walk

253
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,200
without the use of
a crutch or a cane.

254
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,000
He's gonna see that you walk from
faith and divine inspiration alone!

255
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,800
Now walk.

256
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,700
Don't touch him!

257
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,400
Rise up, old man!

258
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,300
Rise up like Lazarus!

259
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,900
I said rise up!

260
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,600
Yes!

261
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,000
Say hallelujah!

262
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,100
Walk. Walk on.

263
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,300
Now, when I look back on it,
it was miraculous.

264
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,600
But you know the saying:

265
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,300
"The Lord giveth and
the Lord taketh away."

266
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,300
Praise be to the Lord
on the highest...!

267
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,600
There was so many birthdays.

268
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,300
So we wouldn't run out,
we would spare the candles.

269
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,200
You know I don't like birthdays
and I don't like cake.

270
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,400
And death was a common visitor.
People came and went.

271
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,300
You always knew
when someone left us.

272
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,500
There was a silence in the house.

273
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,300
It was a wonderful
place to grow up.

274
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,700
I was with people who had shed all
the inconsequences of earlier life.

275
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,200
Left wondering
about the weather,

276
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,800
the temperature of a bath,

277
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
the light at the end of the day.

278
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,100
For everyone that died, someone
would come to take their place.

279
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,300
I've been married five times.

280
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,600
My first wife and I are captured
by neighbor tribe of cannibals.

281
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,300
We escaped across the river.

282
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,300
My wife, she can't swim,
so, sadly, she eaten.

283
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,800
My second wife steps
on a cobra and dies.

284
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,900
It was very bad luck
to be married to me.

285
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,100
That's Mr Oti. He's an acquaintance
of an acquaintance of mine.

286
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,300
The next summer I'm captured...
-He's a pigmey.

287
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,400
...with six others
by Baschiele tribe.

288
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
They trade us for pigs,
shoes and beer

289
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,100
to a very strange
american man.

290
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,800
I hear you're not so old
as you looking.

291
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,300
You just foolin' everybody.

292
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,600
What's the matter,
did you get Madjembe?

293
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,700
What's madjembe?
-Worms.

294
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,700
I don't think I have worms.
This is just how I am.

295
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,200
Come, let's get a cold root beer.

296
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400
I found medication
under your pillow.

297
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,300
I'm not supposed to.
It's dangerous.

298
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Who said that?
Come on, little man.

299
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,800
Hurry up.

300
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
Halt, please!

301
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,500
Then I am in the monkey house
at Philadelphia Zoological Park.

302
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,400
Three thousand people
show up my first day.

303
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,200
Look.

304
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,000
What's it like living
in a cage? -It stinks.

305
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,100
But the monkeys,
they do some tricks there.

306
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,600
I throw a spear...

307
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,000
wrestle with Kowali,
she is orangutan.

308
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,700
When I'm not playing
with the monkeys,

309
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,600
they want me to run to the bars
in my cage, with my teeth.

310
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,200
So then what did you do?
-Then I leave ZOO.

311
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,200
Go here, go there,
wander most of the time.

312
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
You were all alone?
-Plenty of time you'd be alone.

313
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,900
When you're different like us,
it's gonna be that way.

314
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,300
But I tell you a little secret.
Fat people, skinny people,

315
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,500
tall people, white people...
they're just as alone as we are.

316
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,500
But they are scared shitless.

317
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I think about the river
I grew up on.

318
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,600
It would be nice to sit
by my river again.

319
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,000
Come. I have an appointment.

320
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,800
There's my little man.
You ready, sugar?

321
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,300
Always ready.
Always ready.

322
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,200
Filamena, mr Benjamin.

323
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
-My pleasure, ma'am.

324
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,500
You can find your own
way home, can't you?

325
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,200
Take the St. Charles
line to Napoleon.

326
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,400
Where in God's name
have you been? Get in here!

327
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,400
Youre goin' to take my breath
away, you know that?

328
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,100
Oh Lord, I was so
worried about you.

329
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,100
It had been the best
day of my life.

330
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,800
How's her breathing?
-Shallow.

331
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,100
They're sayin' it will
reach us in few hours.

332
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,500
I gotta get my baby
and take him to my sister's.

333
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,300
They say there's nothin' to worry
about here in the hospital.

334
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,000
Nurses will be right here if you
need them. Are you okay?

335
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Yeah, I'm okay, reading...

336
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,800
I shouldn't be more
than an hour.

337
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,000
Was there just company?

338
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,100
It was just Dorothy leaving.

339
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,700
Go on, Caroline.

340
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,200
On sundays, the families
would come and visit.

341
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,200
It was Thanksgiving, 1930.

342
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,300
I met the person who
changed my life forever.

343
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,400
Well, Benjamin...

344
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,900
Might I say you are looking
strikingly youthful.

345
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,000
Good day, Mrs Fuller.

346
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,100
A single cane,
back straight as an arrow...

347
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,900
What elixir have
you been drinking?

348
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,700
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Grandma, look at me!

349
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,700
That was really something!
Come on over here, you.

350
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:16,100
This is my granddaughter Daisy.
This is mister...

351
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,500
I'm afraid, Benjamin, I don't
rightly know your last name.

352
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Benjamin is fine.

353
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,500
I never forgot her blue eyes.

354
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,800
Good people, supper is served.

355
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,800
Did you know turkeys
aren't really birds?

356
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,600
-Why do you say that?
-They're in the pheasant family.

357
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,900
They can hardly fly. Sad, don't
you think? Birds that can't fly.

358
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,500
I like birds that can't fly.
They are so delicious.

359
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
-That's cruel.
-I have something to tell you all.

360
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
While we're giving thanks
for God's blessings...

361
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,600
I've had a miracle happen.

362
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,400
The Lord saw fit to
answer my prayers.

363
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,200
What does she mean
"answers her prayers"?

364
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,400
She's gonna have a baby, silly.

365
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,800
That's what my momma said when
I was gonna have a baby brother.

366
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,500
But he didn't live long.

367
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Cause he didn't breathe right.

368
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,000
...when he got his
beautiful hind legs

369
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,000
just as big God Ngog
had promised.

370
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,000
You can see that
it's five o'clock,

371
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,600
because big God
Ngog's clock says so.

372
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,000
Isn't that something?

373
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,900
-Again. Read it again.
-Read it again, please.

374
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,700
Alright. But afterwards,
you must go to bed.

375
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,000
I promise.

376
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,400
Old Man Kangaroo...

377
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
Are you sleeping?

378
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,800
-Who is that?
-It's me, Daisy.

379
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,000
-Hi!
-Come on!

380
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,100
Where are we going?
-Come on. Right in here.

381
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,800
Here, you light it. -I'm not
supposed to play with matches.

382
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Don 't be a chicken.
Light it!

383
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,900
I'll tell you a secret if
you'll tell me one. -Okay.

384
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,100
I saw my momma
kissing another man.

385
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,900
Her face was red from it.

386
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Your turn.

387
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,200
I'm not as old as I look.
-I thought so.

388
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,500
You don't seem like an old
person. Like my grandma.

389
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,700
-I'm not.
-Are you sick?

390
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Well, I heard momma
and Tizzy whisper

391
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,600
and they said I was
gonna die soon.

392
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,300
But maybe not.

393
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,200
You're odd.

394
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,000
You're different than
anybody I've ever met.

395
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,200
May I? -Okay.

396
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,700
What are you doing
under there?

397
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,200
You come right out here
and get back up to bed.

398
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
It's after midnight!

399
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,000
You are not to be playing
together. -Yes, ma'am.

400
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,100
Not many people experience that.

401
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,000
You want me to go on?

402
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,600
What about your friend?
The tall lady?

403
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,600
We're not friends anymore.

404
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,300
That's what happens with
tall people sometimes.

405
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,600
Well... goodbye.

406
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,400
I spent a lot of time
by myself that year.

407
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Hello?

408
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,900
-Hi. -I'm moving in today.

409
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,600
Welcome. We've been
expecting you.

410
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,000
Can you please show her up
to Mrs Rousseau's old room?

411
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,500
I'm sorry, but we usually
don't allow dogs in the house.

412
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Well, she's old as the hills,
she's almost blind.

413
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
She won't be a
bother much longer.

414
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Well, alright, as long as she
stays out from underfoot.

415
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,700
As hard as I try,
I can't remember her name.

416
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,000
Mrs Lawson, or Mrs Hartford,
or maybe it was Maple?

417
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,400
It's funny how sometimes the
people we remember the least

418
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,500
make the greatest
impression on us.

419
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,800
I do remember
she wore diamonds.

420
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,500
And she always dressed in fine
clothing as if she's going out.

421
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,200
Although she never did and
nobody ever came to visit her.

422
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,200
She taught me
to play the piano.

423
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,800
It's not about
how well you play,

424
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
it's how you feel about
what you're playing.

425
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,200
Try this.

426
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,500
You cannot help but put
yourself into the music.

427
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,200
There were many changes. Some
you could see, some your couldn't.

428
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,600
Hair started growing
in all sorts of places.

429
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,500
Along with other things.

430
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,900
I felt pretty good, considering.

431
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,300
Oh, darlin', the pain.
-Alright mom, I'll get the nurse.

432
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,900
Look at this eye.
This is a major hurricane.

433
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,200
Not doing too good?

434
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,700
Nobody seems to know
whether to stay or leave.

435
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,500
I'm gonna ride it out.

436
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,100
There, that should make
things much easier.

437
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Have you had a chance
to say your goodbyes?

438
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,300
My father waited 4 hours for my
brother to get here from Boger City.

439
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,600
Couldn't go without him.

440
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,900
She seems like a sweet woman.
-Yeah.

441
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,400
I haven't had as much time
with her... -Are you busy?

442
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

443
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,500
Queenie would let me go with
Mr Daws to Poverty Point,

444
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,500
to watch the boats go
up and down the river.

445
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,200
These were hard times.

446
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Did I ever tell you I was struck
by lightning seven times?

447
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,700
Once when I was in the field
just tending to my cows.

448
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
My fourt' hand didn't show up.

449
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,700
Anybody wanna make 2 $
for a day's work around here?

450
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,700
What's the matter?

451
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,700
Nobody wants to do an honest day's
work for an honest day's pay?

452
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,900
He never pays.

453
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,500
Nobody wants the job?
-I do.

454
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,300
You got your sea legs, old man?

455
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,200
I think.

456
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,900
That's good enough for me.

457
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Get your ass on board,
we'll sure as hell find out!

458
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,200
I was as happy as I could be.
-I need a volunteer!

459
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,000
I would do anything.
-Yes, captain!

460
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,000
-Scrape off all this bird shit.
-Right away, sir.

461
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,000
I was actually goin' to be paid for
something I would've done for free.

462
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,800
His name was
captain Mike Clark.

463
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,200
He'd been on a tugboat
since he was seven.

464
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,900
Get movin'!

465
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
Come here.

466
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,000
Could you... still get it up?

467
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,600
I do every morning.

468
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
The old pole? The hard'n?

469
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I guess.

470
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,000
When was the last time
you had a woman?

471
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,000
Never. -Never?

472
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,600
Not that I know of, sir.

473
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,900
Wait a minute!

474
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,900
You mean to say, you've been on
this earth for how many years,

475
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,100
and you never had a woman?

476
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,800
Damn! That's the saddest
thing I ever heard in my life.

477
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,900
Never? -No.

478
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,100
Then, by Jesus,
you are comin' with me.

479
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,600
-What did your father do?
-I never met my father.

480
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,100
You lucky bastard!

481
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,900
All father's gonna do
is hold you down.

482
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,400
Out on my father's boat,
working da two-a-days.

483
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,600
This little fat bastard,
"tug Irish" they call him.

484
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,900
I finally get up the
nerves and tell him:

485
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,100
"I don't wanna spend da rest of
my life on a goddamn tugboat!"

486
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,300
You know what I'm sayin'?

487
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,300
You don't wanna spend the rest
of your life on a tugboat.

488
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,700
Absolutely, damn right!

489
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,500
And you know what
my father says to me?

490
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,800
He says: "Who the hell
do you think you are?"

491
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,500
"What the hell do you
think you can do?"

492
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,500
I tell him:

493
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,300
"Well, if you're askin'..."

494
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,700
"I wanna be an artist."

495
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
He laughs... "An artist?"

496
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,900
"God meant for you to work
a tugboat just like me."

497
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,300
"And that's exactly
what you're gonna do."

498
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,800
Well, I turned myself
into an artist.

499
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,600
A tattoo artist!

500
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,700
I put on every one
of these myself.

501
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,700
You have to skin me alive to
take my art away from me now!

502
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,900
When I'm dead, I'm gonna
send him my arm.

503
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,700
That one.

504
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,900
Don't let anyone
tell you different!

505
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,400
You gotta do what
you're meant to do.

506
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,200
And I happen to be
a god-damned artist!

507
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,900
But you're a tugboat captain.

508
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,900
Captain Mike, we're ready
for you and your friend.

509
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,700
Go, old timer.
Break your cherry.

510
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
Hello, ladies!

511
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,900
Hi.

512
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,800
He gives me the willies.
That is not for me.

513
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,800
How are you tonight, grandpa?

514
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,900
It was a night to remember.

515
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,900
What are you, Dick Tracy or
something? I've got to rest.

516
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,400
I can't.

517
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,500
Thank you. -No, thank you.
Have a nice night.

518
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,100
-Will you be here tomorrow?
-Every night but sunday.

519
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,400
It sure made me understand
the value of earning a living.

520
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,800
Things money can buy you.

521
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:39,100
It's nasty out. Can I offer
you a ride somewhere?

522
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,800
That's awfully kind of you, sir.

523
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,400
My name is Thomas. Thomas Button.
-I'm Benjamin.

524
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,200
Benjamin... it's a
pleasure to know you.

525
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,700
Would you like to stop
somewhere and have a drink?

526
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,700
All right.

527
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,800
Evening.

528
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,400
-What will it be, sir?
-I'll have whatever he's having.

529
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,500
A Sazerac for both of us.
With whiskey, not brandy.

530
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,800
You don't drink, do you?
-It's a night for firsts.

531
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
-How's that? -I've never
been to a brothel, either.

532
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,300
-It's an experience.
-Certainly is.

533
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,500
There's a first time for
everything. -Sure enough.

534
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Your drinks.

535
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:45,400
I don't mean to be rude...
but your hands, is that painful?

536
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,000
I was born with some form of
disease. -What kind of disease?

537
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,500
I was born old.

538
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,700
-I'm sorry. -No need to be.
Nothing wrong with old age.

539
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:10,300
My wife passed away
many years ago.

540
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,500
I'm so so sorry.

541
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,000
She died in childbirth.

542
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,900
To children.
-To mothers.

543
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,100
What line of work are you in,
Mr Button? -Buttons.

544
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,600
Button's Buttons. There isn't
a button we don't make.

545
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,600
Our biggest competition is B.F.
Goodrich and his infernal zippers.

546
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,900
Would you gentlemen
like anything else?

547
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,400
One for the road, Benjamin?

548
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,400
Only if you let me
pay for it, Mr Button.

549
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,900
So, what line of
work do you do?

550
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,000
I'm a tugboat man.

551
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,200
I enjoyed talking to you.
-I enjoyed drinking with you.

552
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,700
Benjamin...

553
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,100
would you mind if, time to time,
I stop by and say hello?

554
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,000
Anytime.
Good night, Mr Button.

555
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,300
Good night, Benjamin.
Drive off.

556
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,500
Where have you been?

557
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,500
Nothing. I met some people
and listened to music...

558
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,400
Oh, sweet Jesus, boy!

559
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,500
Growing up is a funny thing.
Sneaks up on you.

560
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,000
One person is there
and then suddenly

561
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,300
somebody else is
taking their place.

562
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,900
She wasn't all elbows
and knees anymore.

563
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,900
-Benjamin! Come on.
-Okay.

564
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
I loved those weekends
when she'd come

565
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,800
and spend the night
with her grandmother.

566
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,200
Daisy! Daisy!

567
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,200
You wanna see something?

568
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,200
You gotta keep it a secret.

569
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,800
Get dressed.
I'll meet you out back.

570
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,100
Come on!

571
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,600
Can you swim?
-I can do anything you can do.

572
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,400
Put this on. We gotta hurry.

573
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,200
Is he okay? -Captain!

574
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,000
Captain Mike!

575
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,800
Morning, captain.
Can you take us out?

576
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,400
Do you know what day it is?
-Sunday.

577
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,600
You know what that means?

578
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,200
It means that I was
very drunk last night.

579
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,200
You're drunk every night.

580
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,100
Is that a girl? -A close friend.
I want to show her the river.

581
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,300
I'm not supposed to go
joy-ridin' with civilians.

582
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,300
I could lose my licence.

583
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,600
What are you waiting for?

584
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,600
She put in for repair.
A wounded duck.

585
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,800
She's flyin' now!

586
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,900
I wish we could go with them.

587
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,900
Did you say something, mom?

588
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,900
It's getting really bad.

589
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,600
Can you hear me, mom?

590
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,600
Time just seeped out of me.

591
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,200
Things were changing quickly.

592
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,200
I don't know how it's possible,
but you seem to have more hair.

593
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,200
What if I told you that
I wasn't getting older,

594
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,000
but I was getting younger
than everybody else.

595
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,600
Well, I'd feel sorry for you.

596
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,900
To have to see everybody
you love die before you do.

597
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,200
It's an awful responsibility.

598
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,300
I've never thought about life
or death that way before.

599
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,400
Benjamin, we're meant to
lose the people we love.

600
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,700
How else would we know
how important they are to us.

601
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,800
And one fall day, a familiar
visitor came knocking on our door.

602
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,600
You wanna go with me
to the drugstore?

603
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,900
She taught me how to
play the piano. -Amen!

604
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,200
And she taught me what
it meant to miss somebody.

605
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
Let's go.

606
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,500
I had gone to a brothel,
I had my first drink,

607
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,600
Said goodbye to one friend
and burried another.

608
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,600
In 1936, when I was coming to the
end of the 17th year of my life,

609
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,500
I packed my bag
and said goodbye.

610
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I knew, life being what it was,

611
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,600
I'd probably never
see them again.

612
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,700
Good luck to you, son.
-Thanks.

613
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:49,400
-I love you, mom.
-I love you too, baby.

614
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,800
I want you to say your
prayers every night, hear?

615
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,900
Be safe!

616
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,100
Benjamin!

617
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,900
Where are you going?
-Off to sea.

618
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,400
I'll send you a postcard.

619
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,500
From everywhere.

620
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,200
Write me a postcard
from everywhere.

621
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,200
Can you imagine?

622
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,900
He sent me a postcard
from everywhere he went.

623
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,600
Every place he worked.

624
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:04,100
Newfoundland, Baffin Bay,
Glasgow, Liverpool, Narvik...

625
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,700
He had gone with
that captain Mike.

626
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,500
Captain Mike had contracted for
three years with Moran Brothers

627
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,700
Tug and Salvage. The old
ship had been refitted

628
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,300
with a diesel engine
and a new sea winch.

629
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,400
We went around Florida
and up the Atlantic seaboard.

630
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,800
We were a crew of seven now.
Captain Mike and me,

631
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
the cookie, Prentiss Mayes
from Wilmington, Delaware.

632
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,200
The Brody twins, Rick and Vic
who got along fine at sea,

633
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,300
but for some reason,
once they were on dry land,

634
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,900
couldn't stand the sight
of each other. -Enough!

635
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,500
One in every eight
boats never returns...

636
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,900
There was John Grimm,
who sure fit his name.

637
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,800
...all hands lost at sea.

638
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
From Belvedere,
South Dakota.

639
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,400
And Pleasant Curtis
from Nashville,

640
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,600
who never said a word
to anyone, except himself.

641
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,900
I wrote him constantly.

642
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,300
I told him I had been invited
to audition in New York City,

643
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,400
for the School of American Ballet.

644
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,300
Please stay. Thank you.
Thank you.

645
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,400
You can stay.

646
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:26,700
I was relegated to the "corps".
Another dancing gypsy.

647
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,300
Benjamin, how is it
when you showed up,

648
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,800
you were no bigger than a bollard
with one foot in the grave.

649
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,500
Now... either I drink a helluva
lot more than I think I do,

650
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,100
or you sprouted!
What's your secret?

651
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,400
Well, Captain...

652
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,000
you do drink a lot.

653
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,300
We stayed in a small hotel with the
grand name, "The Winter Palace."

654
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,200
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

655
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,100
The hummingbird is
not just another bird.

656
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:16,300
Its heart rate is
1,200 beats a minute.

657
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,400
Its wings beat
80 times a second.

658
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,000
If you was to stop
their wings from beatin,

659
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,700
they would be dead in
less that ten seconds.

660
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:34,900
This is no ordinary bird,
this is a frikkin' miracle!

661
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,900
They slowed down their wings
with moving pictures,

662
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:49,000
and you know what they saw?
Their wingtips are doing...

663
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:57,900
You know what the figure "8"
is the mathematical symbol for?

664
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,900
Infinity!

665
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,300
Everybody, no matter
what differences they had,

666
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:13,600
languages, the color of their skin,
had one thing in common:

667
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,400
They were drunk
every single night.

668
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,500
Could you hold the lift, please?
-Thank you very much.

669
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,800
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott.

670
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,300
She was not beautiful.
She was plain as paper.

671
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,000
But she was pretty
as any picture to me.

672
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,000
What are you looking at?

673
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,500
If you must know, we have
a long standing agreement

674
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,700
never to go to bed sober.
Isn't that right, honey?

675
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,900
-Whatever you say, darling.
-Her husband was Walter Abbott.

676
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,300
He was Chief Minister of the
British Trade Mission in Murmansk.

677
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,900
And he was a spy.

678
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,800
Are you okay, darling?
-Oh yes.

679
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,600
I broke my heel off
one of my shoes.

680
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,600
I'm not in a habit of walking
about in my stocking feet.

681
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,900
They were long days there.

682
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,200
And even longer nights.

683
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,200
One particular night, I was
having trouble sleeping.

684
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,900
I'm sorry.

685
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,400
I couldn't sleep.

686
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:52,800
I was gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

687
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,200
No, thank you.

688
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:37,000
-Milk? Honey?
-A bit of honey, please.

689
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,700
I hope you like flies in your
honey. -Oh, perhaps not.

690
01:00:56,100 --> 01:01:00,200
Maybe... better to
let it steep a little.

691
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,700
Steep? -Soak.

692
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,900
I don't know, I mean... there's
a proper way of making tea.

693
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,800
Where I'm from,
people just want it to be hot.

694
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,400
Well, quite right.

695
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,400
You're a seaman?
-Sailor.

696
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,300
I hope I'm not being impolite,
but I have to ask:

697
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,800
Aren't you a little old
to be working on a boat?

698
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,900
There's no age limit,
as long as you can do the work.

699
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,500
And you have trouble
sleeping? Thank you.

700
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,700
I didn't think I did.
I usually sleep like a baby.

701
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,100
Something kept me up.

702
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,300
My father, in his eighties,

703
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,400
he was so convinced
he's gonna die in his sleep,

704
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,900
he limited himself to
having afternoon naps.

705
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,900
He was so determined
he was gonna cheat death.

706
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,200
Did he? -Did he what?
-Die in his sleep?

707
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,100
He died sitting in
his favorite chair,

708
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,900
listening to his favorite
program on the wireless.

709
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,300
He must have known something.

710
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,500
My husband is
British Trade Minister,

711
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,600
and we've been here
for fourteen months.

712
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,200
-Good God! -We were
supposed to go to Peking.

713
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:41,100
But it never seemed to work out.
Have you been in the Far East?

714
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,000
No. I've never been anywhere,
really. I mean outside harbors.

715
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,300
And where is it that you're from?
-New Orleans, Louisiana.

716
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,500
I didn't know
there was another.

717
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,300
And she told me about
all the places she had been.

718
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,000
What she had seen.

719
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,900
And we talked till
just before the dawn.

720
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:14,200
And we went back to our rooms,
to our separate lives.

721
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,400
But every night, we'd
meet again in that lobby.

722
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,200
A hotel in the middle of the
night can be a magical place.

723
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,000
A mouse running and stopping.

724
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,400
A radiator hissing.
A curtain blowing.

725
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,100
There's something peaceful,
even comforting,

726
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,500
knowing that people you love
are asleep in their beds,

727
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,800
where nothing can harm them.

728
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,300
Elizabeth and I would
lose track of the night,

729
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,300
till just before daybreak.

730
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:11,000
I think I may have given you
the wrong impression.

731
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,200
I beg your pardon?

732
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,000
Well, married women don't
customarily sit around

733
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,900
in the middle of the night
with strange men in hotels.

734
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:23,400
I wouldn't know what a married
woman does and doesn't do.

735
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,100
Good night!

736
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,800
Murmansk.

737
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,900
"I've met somebody and
I've fallen in love." Mom?

738
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
That was over 60 years ago.

739
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:52,300
-Did you love him, mother?
-What does a girl know about love?

740
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,700
I'm not dressed. -You look
splendid just as you are.

741
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,800
Don't waste any time bothering
about the wine or the cheese

742
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,900
in Murmansk, cause they are
really completely ordinary.

743
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,900
But the caviar and the vodka

744
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,500
are sublime and plentiful.

745
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,400
So...

746
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:06,100
Savor it... and don't
eat it all at once.

747
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,800
Because that way, there's
nothing left to enjoy.

748
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,400
Now take a little swallow of vodka
while it's still in your mouth.

749
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,900
Nazdrovia.

750
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,600
You haven't been with
many women, have you?

751
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,500
Not on sundays.

752
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:43,300
And you've never had a girlfriend
before, have you? -No ma'am.

753
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:52,600
When I was nineteen,
I attempted to become

754
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,200
the first woman ever to
swim the English Channel.

755
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,500
Really?

756
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,000
But the current that day
was so strong that...

757
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,700
for every stroke I took,
I was pushed back two.

758
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,100
I was in the water
for 32 hours.

759
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,100
And when I was
two miles from Calais,

760
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,100
it started to rain.

761
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,700
When I couldn't go any further,

762
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,600
I stopped.

763
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,700
I just stopped.

764
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,500
And everybody asked me
would I try again.

765
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,700
Why wouldn't I?

766
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:43,500
I never did.
As a matter of fact,

767
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,800
I've never done anything
with my life after that.

768
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,100
Your hands are so coarse.

769
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:07,500
I can feel the wind
in your cheeks.

770
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,600
I'm afraid it's
the witching hour.

771
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,400
It was the first time
a woman had ever kissed me.

772
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,800
It's something
you never forget.

773
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,400
-Benjamin!
-You make me feel younger.

774
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,500
You make me feel years
younger too. I wish I was.

775
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,700
So many things I'd change.
I'd undo all my mistakes.

776
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:53,400
What mistakes?

777
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,000
I kept waiting, you know.

778
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:04,300
Thinking that I'd do something
to change my circumstances.

779
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,100
Do something.

780
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,700
Such an awful waste,
you never get it back.

781
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,300
Wasted time.

782
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,500
If we're going to have an affair,

783
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,000
you're never to look
at me during the day.

784
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,600
And we're always to
part before sunrise,

785
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,400
and we will never say
"I love you".

786
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,600
Those are the rules.

787
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:42,200
Are you cold?
-I'm freezing.

788
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,500
She was the first woman
that ever loved me.

789
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:28,100
Want me to skip some?

790
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:32,900
No, glad he had somebody
to keep him warm.

791
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,400
I couldn't wait
to see her again.

792
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,600
We saw each other every night.
We always used the same room.

793
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,600
But each time seemed
new and different.

794
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,700
Come here.

795
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,300
Elizabeth...

796
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,500
Good night.

797
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,900
Until one night.

798
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:05,400
<i>Yesterday, December 7th 1941,
the day which will live in infamy.</i>

799
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:13,900
...in the near future,
and possibly beyond.

800
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,600
There's been a change
of plan, lads.

801
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,300
As you may or may not know,

802
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,400
the Japs bombed
Pearl Harbor yesterday.

803
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,300
Frank D. Roosevelt asked
each of us to do our part.

804
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,700
The Chelsea's been commissioned
to serve in the United States Navy.

805
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,700
To repair, salvage
and to rescue.

806
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:41,200
Anybody doesn't wanna go to war,
now's the time to say so.

807
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,200
Once you set foot on that boat,
you're in the Navy, friend.

808
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,500
I've been meaning to
talk with you, Mike.

809
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,100
My wife's doing poorly.

810
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,500
I'd like to maybe
see her one more time.

811
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:03,400
You're free to make your way
home any way you can, Mr Mayes.

812
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,700
If he's leaving,
who's gonna cook?

813
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,700
Food poisoning is one of the
leading causes of death at sea.

814
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,100
Right after inadequate
safety equipment.

815
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,200
I can cook, captain.
Been doin' it all my life.

816
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:23,300
Yeah, I knew it. You're a little
too old for war, Benjamin.

817
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,800
Ah, what the hell.
I'll take any man

818
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,600
who wants to kick the shit
out of Japs and Huns.

819
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:36,300
That's it! Back to your gear.
We're going to war, gentlemen!

820
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:44,600
She had left a note.

821
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,600
She wrote "It was nice
to have met you."

822
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,400
And that was it.

823
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,800
It wasn't the war
any of us expected.

824
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,800
We just towed crippled ships.
Scraps of metal, really.

825
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,900
If there was a war,
we didn't see it.

826
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,900
There was a man assigned to us.
The Chief Gunner loved the Navy.

827
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,200
But most of all,
he loved America.

828
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,000
There is no other
country in the world!

829
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,600
When you spell A.M.E.R.I.C.A,
you're spelling freedom.

830
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,100
His name was Dennis Smith and
he was a full blooded Cherokee.

831
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,300
His family had been americans
for over 500 years.

832
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,100
These pacifists. They say
they won't fight on conscience.

833
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:30,400
Where would we be...

834
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,800
if everybody decided to act
according to their conscience?

835
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,100
Keep it down, would you chief!

836
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,000
Hey...

837
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,400
I've been watching you.
You seem trustworthy.

838
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,600
If something happens to me,

839
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,800
could you see that
this gets to my wife?

840
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,300
He had given me all of his pay.
Hadn't spent a dime of it.

841
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:20,200
I want my family to know
that I was thinking about them.

842
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,600
All hands on deck!

843
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,600
Get you asses up here,
you lazy bastards!

844
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,500
The war had finally found us.

845
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,300
Full stop!

846
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,100
Pleasant, get on that light.

847
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:16,300
A transport carrying 1300 men
had been split by a torpedo.

848
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,600
We were first to
arrive at the scene.

849
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,800
Stop the engine!
Full stop!

850
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,100
We were the only sound.

851
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,600
Fellows!

852
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:06,100
We surely can't count
to outrun them fuckers.

853
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,100
Battle stations!

854
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,800
What?

855
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Is that the last one?

856
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,200
Captain!

857
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,100
They shot the hell
out of my paintin'!

858
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:23,200
Give me your hand.

859
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,200
You'll be alright,
captain Mike.

860
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,400
Nice spot in heaven's
waitin' for you. Nice spot.

861
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,000
You could be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

862
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,500
You could swear,
curse the fates...

863
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,500
but when it comes to the end...

864
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,700
you have to let go.

865
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,400
Captain.

866
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,000
1328 men died that day.

867
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:31,200
I said my goodbyes to the
Cherokee, Dennis Smith.

868
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,800
John Grimm who was right,
he was gonna die there.

869
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,600
I sent Pleasant Curtis'
wife his money.

870
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,100
I said goodbye to
the twin, Vic Brody,

871
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:48,300
and to Mike Clark, captain
of the tugboat "Chelsea."

872
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,300
I said goodbye to all the other men,
who had dreams of their own.

873
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:58,000
All the men who wanted to be
insurance salesmen or doctors

874
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,800
or lawyers or Indian chiefs.

875
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,800
This don't get fixed.

876
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:09,300
Out here, death
didn't seem natural.

877
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:29,500
I had never seen a hummingbird
that far out to sea.

878
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,800
Before or since.

879
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,900
And in may of 1945,
when I was 26 years old...

880
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,100
I'm coming!

881
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,100
Queenie? -Yes.

882
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,500
Oh, sweet Jesus!
You're home!

883
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,100
Lord, you came back!
Let me look at you!

884
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,200
Who's that, mama? -Child,
it's your brother, Benjamin.

885
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,200
I didn't know he
was my brother.

886
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,600
There's a shit load of
things you don't know.

887
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,600
Finish sweeping, wash your hands
and help me with the table. C'mon!

888
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,100
Turn around. Oh, you look
like you've been born again!

889
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:22,600
Younger than the springtime.

890
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,300
I think that preacher laid the hands
on you gave you a second life.

891
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,900
I knew it the moment
I saw you, you were special.

892
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:33,800
I tell you what, my knees are
sore cause I've been on them

893
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,200
every night asking the Lord,
I say God, bring him home safely.

894
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,900
Remember what I told you?

895
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:45,700
You never know what's comin'
for you? -That's right. Sit down.

896
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:52,000
Did you learn anything
worth repeating?

897
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:57,100
-I sure saw some things.
-Oh, you've seen some pain.

898
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,100
Some joy too? -Sure, sure I did.
-Yeah, that's what I wanna hear.

899
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,100
Look at you...
-Where's Tizzy?

900
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:09,300
Oh, baby!

901
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Mr Weathers died in his sleep
one night last april.

902
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:19,600
Mama, I'm so sorry. -Don't you
worry about that, baby.

903
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,300
Well, there's only one or
two of them left now.

904
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
They're all just about new.

905
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,800
I guess they're waitin' their
turn like everybody else.

906
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,500
I'm so glad you're
back home with me.

907
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,700
Now we're going to find you
a wife and a new job.

908
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,900
Come and help me
with this table.

909
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:43,200
Benjamin! You're wasting
your time, baby.

910
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,600
She's stone deaf.

911
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,400
You'll be staying in what was
Mrs DeSeroux's old room.

912
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,400
You're too big to be rooming
with anybody else.

913
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,200
It's a funny thing
about coming home.

914
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,600
Looks the same. Smells
the same. Feels the same.

915
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:10,900
Did I ever tell you I've been
struck by lightning 7 times?

916
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:16,100
Once when I was sitting in my
truck, minding my own business.

917
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:24,900
You realise
what's changed, is you.

918
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:31,400
And late one morning,
not long after I'd been back...

919
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:03,000
Excuse me, is Queenie here?

920
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,300
Daisy?

921
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,900
It's me, Benjamin.
-Benjamin?

922
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,500
Oh my God!

923
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,700
Of course it's you! Benjamin!

924
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,900
How are you?

925
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:29,000
It's been such a long time!
There's so much I wanna know!

926
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,100
When did you get back?
-I got back few weeks ago.

927
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,800
I spoke to Queenie, she said
you were in the war,

928
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,700
somewhere at sea, we were so
worried about you. -I'm okay.

929
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,300
Well, look at you.
You are so lovely.

930
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,800
You stopped writing.

931
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:54,400
When I had left she was a girl.
And a woman had taken her place.

932
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,700
She was the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen.

933
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,900
Beautiful.

934
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,700
The most beautiful.

935
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,200
You remember grandma Fuller?
-Sure I do. -She passed.

936
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,600
I heard that, I'm sorry.

937
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,700
I just can't believe
we're both here.

938
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,900
Must be fate... no, no,
what did he call it? Kismet.

939
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,600
Do you know about Edgar Cayce,
the psychic? -I don't believe I...

940
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,400
He says that everything
is predetermined, but...

941
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,900
I like to think
that it is fate.

942
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,200
I'm not sure how it works,
but I'm glad it happened.

943
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,000
Have you been to Manhattan?
It's right across the river from me.

944
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,800
I can see the Empire State
Building if I stand on my bed.

945
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
What about you, where've
you been? Tell me everything.

946
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,300
Last time you wrote, you said
you've been to Russia.

947
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,100
I always wanted to go to Russia.
Is it as cold as they say?

948
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,300
-Twice as cold.
-My goodness!

949
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:00,800
We always said you were different.
I think you really are.

950
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:06,100
You wrote that you met
somebody. Did it work out?

951
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,900
It ran its course.

952
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,400
Hey, do you remember this?

953
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:27,700
This is the picture of Old Man
Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon.

954
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,200
Would you like to have dinner?

955
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,300
Did I tell you that I danced
for Ballenchine?

956
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:47,500
He's a famous choreographer.
He said that I had perfect line.

957
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:52,800
In a rehearsal once,
a dancer fell.

958
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,800
And he just put it
right into the production.

959
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:59,500
Can you imagine that
in a classical ballet?

960
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:02,900
A dancer intentionally falling?

961
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,900
There's a whole new word for
dance now, it's called abstract.

962
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,900
He's not the only one though,
there's Lincoln Kirstein,

963
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,500
and Lucia Chase
and Agnes DeMille...

964
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,100
she has just torn up
all those conventions,

965
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,600
all that straight up
and down stuff...

966
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,100
And she told me about
this big new world.

967
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,700
Names that didn't
mean a thing to me.

968
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,800
I didn't really hear very much
of what she was saying.

969
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,200
It's new and modern
and it's American.

970
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,700
They understand our vigor
and our physicality.

971
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,300
Oh my God, I've just been
talking and talking.

972
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,700
No, no, I've enjoyed listening.

973
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:44,700
I didn't know you smoked.
-I'm old enough.

974
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,900
I'm old enough
for a lot of things.

975
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,100
In New York we stay up all night.

976
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,900
Watch the sun come up
over the warehouses.

977
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,700
There's always something to do.

978
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,800
I have to go back tomorrow.

979
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,200
-So soon?
-Wish I could stay.

980
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:35,300
Dancers don't need costumes
or scenery anymore.

981
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:39,100
I can imagine dancing
completely naked.

982
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:44,200
Have you read D.H. Lawrence?
His books were banned.

983
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:48,100
The words are like making love.

984
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:37,800
In our company,
we have to trust each other.

985
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:46,400
Sex is a part of it.

986
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:54,100
I know a lot of the dancers
are lesbians.

987
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,600
There was one woman who
wanted to sleep with me.

988
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:09,800
Was that upseting you?
-Which part?

989
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:14,100
Somebody wanted to sleep with me?
-You're a desirable woman,

990
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:18,000
I would think most of them
would wanna sleep with you.

991
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,200
Let's go back to the house.

992
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,100
Or we can get a room somewhere.

993
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:30,200
We can lay down your jacket.
-I don't know, Daisy...

994
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:35,400
It's not that I wouldn't like to.
I think I'd just disappoint you.

995
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,900
Benjamin, I've been
with older men.

996
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,700
You go back to New York
in the morning,

997
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,300
you should be with your friends.

998
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,100
You're only young once.
-Oh, I'm old enough.

999
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,700
Daisy, just not tonight, is all.

1000
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,800
We can go hear some music.

1001
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,200
Our lives are defined
by opportunities.

1002
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,900
Even the ones we miss.

1003
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:18,500
You look so handsome,
so distinct.

1004
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,600
They're sayin' the hurricane is
gonna miss us. Blow right on by.

1005
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,000
-Oh, that's great.
-I'll stay under the blankets...

1006
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:28,300
with mother.
She said nothing...

1007
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,600
Benjamin?

1008
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,400
Things were becoming
different for me.

1009
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:37,900
My hair had very little gray
and grew like weeds.

1010
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,700
My sense of smell was keener,
my hearing more acute.

1011
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,900
I could walk further and faster.

1012
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:50,300
While everybody else was aging,
I was getting younger. All alone.

1013
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,300
Come in.

1014
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,700
Benjamin!

1015
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:01,800
Do you remember me?
-Sure I do, Mr Button.

1016
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:06,100
What happened to you?
-Darn foot got infected.

1017
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:10,200
Welcome home, my friend.

1018
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,200
I see you're still drinking
your Sazerac with whiskey.

1019
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,200
I'm a creature of habit.

1020
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,400
Still visiting the house
on Bourbon Street?

1021
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,800
Not for a long time.

1022
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,600
Interesting times, though.

1023
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,100
We went from making 40 thousand
to nearly a million buttons a day.

1024
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,700
We employed ten times
the number of people.

1025
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:33,300
We were operating
around the clock.

1026
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,500
Damn shame.

1027
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:43,400
The war has been kind
to the button industry.

1028
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,500
You know...

1029
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,700
I'm sick. I don't know
how much longer I have.

1030
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:56,500
I'm sorry to hear that,
Mr Button. -No...

1031
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:00,800
I don't have any people.
I keep to myself.

1032
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,600
I hope you don't mind, but...

1033
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,400
whenever possible,
I'd enjoy your company.

1034
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,400
I'll certainly do what I can.

1035
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:17,500
Benjamin, do you know
anything about buttons?

1036
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,700
Button's Buttons has been
in our family for 124 years.

1037
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:29,600
My grandfather was a tailor.
He had a small shop in Richmond.

1038
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:33,000
After the Civil War,
He moved to New Orleans

1039
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:37,400
where my father had the wisdom
to make our own buttons.

1040
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,600
So, with his help,
the tailor shop grew to this.

1041
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:46,600
And today, I can't sew a stitch.

1042
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:53,100
That's very, very interesting.

1043
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:59,400
You sure have done
well for yourself.

1044
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:04,100
So... what can I do
for you, Mr Button?

1045
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:09,500
Benjamin, you are my son.

1046
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,400
I'm so sorry I've never
told you before.

1047
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:25,300
You were born the night
the Great war ended.

1048
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:30,300
Your mother died
giving birth to you.

1049
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,600
I thought you were a monster.

1050
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:42,300
I promised your mother
I'd make sure you were safe.

1051
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,600
I should never have
abandoned you.

1052
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,700
My mother?

1053
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,500
This is our summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1054
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:03,200
When I was a boy I loved to
wake up before anyone else,

1055
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,200
run down to the lake
and watch the day begin.

1056
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:11,300
It was as if I was
the only one alive.

1057
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,200
I fell in love the
first time I saw her.

1058
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,700
Your mother's name was
Caroline Murphy.

1059
01:36:18,900 --> 01:36:22,700
She worked in your
grandfather's kitchen.

1060
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,100
She was from Dublin.

1061
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,900
In 1903, Caroline and all
her brothers and sisters

1062
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:34,400
came to live here,
in New Orleans.

1063
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:39,000
I'd find excuses to go
down to that kitchen,

1064
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:42,200
just so I could look at her.

1065
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:51,900
April 25th 1918, the
happiest day of my life.

1066
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:55,100
The day I married your mother.

1067
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,900
Why didn't you just tell me?

1068
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,200
I plan on leaving
everything I have to you.

1069
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,400
I have to go.

1070
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:08,700
-Where?
-Home.

1071
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,500
What is he thinking?
He think he can just show up

1072
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,000
and everything's supposed
to be fine and dandy.

1073
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,300
Everybody's supposed
to be friends.

1074
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,300
He got another thing coming,
that's for sure.

1075
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,400
God be my witness,
he got another thing coming!

1076
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:26,000
He left us 18 dollars
that night you was found.

1077
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:29,300
18 ratty dollars
and a filthy diaper!

1078
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,200
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, baby.

1079
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:50,600
Did I ever tell you, I was
struck by lightning 7 times?

1080
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,200
Once I was walking
the dog down the road.

1081
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I'm blind in the one eye,
can't hardly hear.

1082
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,900
I get twitches and shakes
out of nowhere,

1083
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,000
I always lose my line of thought.

1084
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,600
But you know what?

1085
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,600
God keeps reminding me
I'm lucky to be alive.

1086
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,700
Storm's comin'.

1087
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:11,900
Wake up.

1088
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:16,800
Let's get you dressed.

1089
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,500
You could be mad as a mad dog
at the way things went.

1090
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:57,300
You can swear and
curse the fates...

1091
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,700
but when it comes to the end...

1092
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,600
you have to let go.

1093
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,200
That sure is a beautiful service.

1094
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:32,900
He'll be burried right
next to your mother.

1095
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:36,500
You're my mother.

1096
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:41,100
My baby.

1097
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,100
I've never seen New York.

1098
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:19,200
Excuse me, I'm a friend of
Daisy's. -Right this way.

1099
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,200
Daisy!

1100
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,900
Yes! I'm in the wardrobe!

1101
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,900
Is somebody looking for me?

1102
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,800
Benjamin! -Hi.

1103
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:38,500
-What are you doing here?
-I thought I'd come visit.

1104
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:42,100
Spend some time
with you if I could.

1105
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:48,100
I wish you would have called.
You took me by surprise.

1106
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:53,800
-Are you still mad?
-No. Thank you, they're lovely.

1107
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:57,100
I couldn't take
my eyes off of you.

1108
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:00,300
I thought you were mesmerizing.

1109
01:44:00,900 --> 01:44:04,500
Thank you. That's very
kind of you to say.

1110
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:11,100
I better get changed. A group
of us are going to a party.

1111
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:13,200
Would you wanna come?

1112
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:15,900
Somebody told me about a restaurant
I thought you might enjoy.

1113
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:18,500
I made a reservation.
Just in case.

1114
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:21,900
It's just that all the dancers
go out after the show.

1115
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:26,100
You're welcome to come with us.
I'll get changed, alright?

1116
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,900
This is David.
He dances with the company.

1117
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,300
This is Benjamin.
I told you about him.

1118
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,800
Oh yeah... how are you doing?

1119
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I'll go get you a drink.

1120
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:10,000
So, you were a friend
of her grandmother's?

1121
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:12,800
Or something like that?

1122
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:16,400
-Something like that.
-Excuse me.

1123
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:03,300
Hey!

1124
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:06,500
I had no idea you were coming!

1125
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,400
Lord, Benjamin...

1126
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,400
What did you expect?

1127
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:17,500
What, you want me to drop
everything? This is my life.

1128
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:20,400
Hey, going downtown?

1129
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:26,500
Come on.

1130
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:30,500
Have a good time. There'll be
musicians, interesting people...

1131
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:34,100
You don't have to do that.
It's my fault.

1132
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:37,100
I should've called.
I thought...

1133
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:41,800
I'll come here and sweep you
off your feet, or something.

1134
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:47,200
-Daisy, come on!
-I'll be right there.

1135
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:53,300
He seems nice.
Do you love him?

1136
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:58,900
I think so.

1137
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,700
I'm happy for you.

1138
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:06,900
Maybe I'll see you at home.

1139
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:10,300
Okay.

1140
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:14,400
I enjoyed the show!

1141
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:25,800
He came to tell me
his father had died.

1142
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:29,300
You couldn't have known.

1143
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,400
I was 23. I just didn't care.

1144
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:40,700
What did you do next?
-Some photographs, I think.

1145
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Front of my bag.

1146
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:50,600
I was as good a dancer
as I was ever gonna be.

1147
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:55,000
For five years...

1148
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:59,600
I danced everywhere.

1149
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,900
London, Vienna, Prague...

1150
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,100
I've never seen these.

1151
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:14,000
Mom, you never talked
about your dancing.

1152
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:18,500
I was the only American
to be invited

1153
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:21,700
to dance with the Bolshoi.

1154
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,300
It was glorious.

1155
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:34,600
But Benjamin was never
far from my thoughts.

1156
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,300
And I'd find myself saying:

1157
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,600
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1158
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,500
-"Goodnight, Daisy."
-He said that?

1159
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:53,100
Life wasn't all that complicated.

1160
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:57,700
If you want, you might say
I was looking for something.

1161
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:08,200
Benjamin, mrs La Tourneau
just passed.

1162
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:18,600
Mr Benjamin Button?
-That would be me.

1163
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,000
Bonjour.
-Oui, monsieur?

1164
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,800
Miss Daisy Fuller.
-Just a minute.

1165
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Please, have a seat.
-Sure.

1166
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:05,200
Sometimes we are on a collision
course and we just don't know it.

1167
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,400
Whether it's by accident
or by design,

1168
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:11,600
there's not a thing
we can do about it.

1169
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:16,500
A woman in Paris was on
her way to go shopping.

1170
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:20,900
But she had forgotten her coat,
and went back to get it.

1171
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:24,000
When she had gotten her
coat the phone had rung,

1172
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,800
so she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes.

1173
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
While the woman was
on the phone,

1174
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:33,700
Daisy was rehearsing for performance
at the Paris Opera House.

1175
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:36,900
And while she was rehearsing,
the woman, off the phone now,

1176
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,900
had gone outside to get a taxi.

1177
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:46,500
Now a taxi driver had
dropped off a fare earlier,

1178
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,700
and had stopped to
get a cup of coffee.

1179
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:53,400
And all the while
Daisy was rehearsing.

1180
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:58,200
And this cab driver who had
dropped off the earlier fare,

1181
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,500
and had stopped to
get the cup of coffee,

1182
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:02,900
had picked up the lady
who was going shopping,

1183
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:05,800
who had missed
getting the earlier cab.

1184
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,500
Taxi had to stop for a man
crossing the street,

1185
01:51:08,700 --> 01:51:11,500
who had left for work 5 minutes
later than he normally did,

1186
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,500
because he forgot
to set his alarm.

1187
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,000
While the man, late for work,
was crossing the street,

1188
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:21,800
Daisy had finished rehearsing
and was taking a shower.

1189
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:24,900
While Daisy was showering, taxi
was waiting outside a Boutique

1190
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:28,400
for the woman to pick up a package
which hadn't been wrapped yet

1191
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:31,200
because the girl who
was supposed to wrap it

1192
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,700
had broken up with her boyfriend
the night before, and forgot.

1193
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,700
When the package was wrapped,
the woman, who was back in the cab,

1194
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:40,000
was blocked by a delivery truck.

1195
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:43,000
All the while Daisy
was getting dressed.

1196
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:47,100
The delivery truck pulled away
and the taxi was able to move.

1197
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,700
While Daisy,
the last to be dressed,

1198
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:53,400
waited for one of her friends
who had broken a shoelace.

1199
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,600
While the taxi was stopped,
waiting for a traffic light,

1200
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:00,500
Daisy and her friend came out
the back of the theater.

1201
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:03,800
And if only one thing
had happened differently,

1202
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,100
if that shoelace hadn't broken,

1203
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:08,700
or that delivery truck had
moved moments earlier,

1204
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:11,000
or that package had been
wrapped and ready,

1205
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,700
because the girl hadn't
broken up with her boyfriend,

1206
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:16,900
or that man had set his alarm
and got up five minutes earlier,

1207
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:20,400
or that taxi driver hadn't
stopped for a cup of coffee,

1208
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,700
or that woman had
remembered her coat

1209
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:24,900
and had gotten
into an earlier cab,

1210
01:52:25,200 --> 01:52:28,200
Daisy and her friend would
have crossed the street.

1211
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,200
And the taxi would
have driven by.

1212
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:43,700
But life being what it is,

1213
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:46,800
a series of intersecting
lives and incidents,

1214
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
out of anyone's control,

1215
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,600
that taxi did not go by,

1216
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,500
and that driver was
momentarily distracted.

1217
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:00,800
And that taxi hit Daisy.
-Daisy! Help!

1218
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:06,200
And her leg was crushed.

1219
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,400
Daisy...

1220
01:53:18,100 --> 01:53:21,600
-Who told you?
-Your friend wired me.

1221
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:26,800
Very kind of you to come all this
way to see that I was alright.

1222
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:30,100
You'd do the same for me.

1223
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:33,100
My God!

1224
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:38,500
Look at you.
You're perfect.

1225
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:43,500
I wish you hadn't come.

1226
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:47,600
I don't want you
to see me like this.

1227
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,600
Her leg had been
broken in five places.

1228
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,700
And with therapy, and time,
she might walk again.

1229
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:01,700
But she'll never dance.

1230
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,800
I'm gonna take you home with
me. I wanna look after you.

1231
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,200
I'm not going back
to New Orleans.

1232
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,700
Then I'll stay here in Paris.

1233
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:14,400
Don't you understand?
I don't want your help.

1234
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:16,900
I know I'm feeling
sorry for myself,

1235
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,300
but I don't want to be with you.

1236
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:23,800
I tried to tell you that in
New York, but you don't listen.

1237
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:26,500
You might change your mind.

1238
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:30,300
We are not little children
anymore, Benjamin.

1239
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,900
Stay out of my life.

1240
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:00,700
I was awfully cruel.

1241
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:04,800
He didn't understand that...

1242
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,400
I couldn't have him
see me like that.

1243
01:55:10,100 --> 01:55:13,100
I didn't leave right away.

1244
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:18,100
I stayed in Paris for awhile
to look out for her.

1245
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:23,800
I never knew that.

1246
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:30,400
Darling, could you
get the nurse?

1247
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:40,000
I taught myself to walk again.

1248
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,400
I took the train to Lourdes.

1249
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:50,000
Lets take a look.
That's normal.

1250
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:53,600
Pulse rate is slowing. She is
gonna struggle to breathe.

1251
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,600
Will you be alright?
-Yeah.

1252
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Alright, he says:
"I went back home..."

1253
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:15,400
And then there's
lot of pages torn out.

1254
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:19,600
"I listened to the sound of the
house." I think I've read that.

1255
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,900
He spilled something on it,
so it's hard to read, mom.

1256
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:29,300
Something about "sailing".
Does that make sense?

1257
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:35,100
I learned to sail on an old boat of
my father's from the Lake House.

1258
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:47,400
I can't lie, I did enjoy the
company of a woman or two.

1259
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,400
Or maybe three.

1260
01:57:33,700 --> 01:57:38,500
Don't bother, Sam. It's just
gonna be there again tomorrow.

1261
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,000
Mama.

1262
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:51,400
And in the spring of 1962,

1263
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,200
she came back.

1264
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:19,400
You wanna know
where I've been? -No.

1265
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:23,900
How come you didn't
write or nothin'?

1266
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:26,100
Just disappearing like that.

1267
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:29,100
It was something I needed
to do for myself.

1268
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:32,500
I never took you to
be the selfish type.

1269
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:35,700
I sure hope I'm not wrong.

1270
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,800
I'm usually not wrong
about people.

1271
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,800
-Good night, Momma.
-Good night, baby.

1272
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,200
Now have fun.

1273
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:51,100
You haven't said two words.
-I don't wanna ruin it.

1274
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:24,100
Sleep with me. -Absolutely.

1275
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:04,300
I asked her to come
away with me.

1276
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:10,000
We sailed into the Gulf,
along the Florida Keys.

1277
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:54,400
I'm so glad we didn't find
one another when I was 26.

1278
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:58,500
-Why do you say that?
-I was so young.

1279
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,200
And you were so old.

1280
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,300
It happened when it was
supposed to happen.

1281
02:01:04,500 --> 02:01:08,600
I will enjoy each and every
moment I have with you.

1282
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:17,800
I bet I can stay out here longer
than you. -Bet you can't.

1283
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,800
You barely have
a line, a crease.

1284
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,600
Every day I have
more wrinkles. Not fair.

1285
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:31,600
I love your wrinkles.
Both of them.

1286
02:01:36,900 --> 02:01:40,500
What's it like,
growing younger?

1287
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:46,500
Can't really say. I'm always
looking out of my own eyes.

1288
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:55,200
Will you still love me when
my skin grows old and saggy?

1289
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:58,700
Will you still love me
when I have acne?

1290
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:01,100
When I wet the bed?

1291
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:05,300
When I'm afraid of
what's under the stairs?

1292
02:02:11,300 --> 02:02:12,900
What?

1293
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:22,600
What are you thinking?
-I was thinking how nothing lasts.

1294
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:27,900
And what a shame that is.

1295
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:32,300
Some things last.

1296
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:38,400
-Goodnight, Daisy.
-Goodnight, Benjamin.

1297
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:56,000
Mom?

1298
02:02:57,700 --> 02:03:02,300
When did you meet dad?
-Some time after that.

1299
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:07,600
Did you tell him
about this Benjamin?

1300
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:10,600
He knew enough, darling.

1301
02:03:29,700 --> 02:03:31,300
Momma!

1302
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:39,500
Queenie!

1303
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:44,000
Hallo?

1304
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:48,100
Hi, Mrs Carter. It's Benjamin.
Where is everybody?

1305
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:51,400
Oh, Benjamin. Queenie died.

1306
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:54,300
I'm so sorry.

1307
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:25,800
So sorry for your loss.
She was a great woman.

1308
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:36,500
We buried her beside
her beloved Mr Weathers.

1309
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:45,400
And so we might have
memories of our own,

1310
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:48,200
we sold my father's
house on Esplanade.

1311
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:51,000
It's a wonderful
old place, darlin'.

1312
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:54,300
I think we're going
to be so happy here.

1313
02:04:54,500 --> 02:04:57,100
Oh, what a long family
history you have.

1314
02:04:57,300 --> 02:05:00,100
They come with the house.

1315
02:05:02,700 --> 02:05:05,700
We have to see the master suite.

1316
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:09,100
We bought ourselves a duplex.

1317
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:13,100
I loved that house.

1318
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,700
It smelled like firewood.

1319
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:21,200
Don't stop, darlin'.

1320
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:24,700
It was one of the happiest
times of my life.

1321
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:27,700
We didn't have
a stick of furniture.

1322
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,600
We would have picnics
in the living room.

1323
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:36,600
We ate when we felt like it.

1324
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,300
Stayed up all night
when we wanted.

1325
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:41,900
We vowed never
to fall into routine,

1326
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:44,600
to go to bed or wake up
at the same time.

1327
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:47,700
We lived on that mattress.

1328
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:26,600
Our neighbor, Mrs Van Dam,
was a physical therapist.

1329
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:31,500
We lived four blocks
from a public pool.

1330
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,200
You might have got a few
more years out of it.

1331
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:16,600
You chose to do something
so special, unique,

1332
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:22,200
that there was only a short
window of time you could do it.

1333
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:25,400
So even if nothing ever happened,

1334
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:28,700
you'd still be right here
where you're now.

1335
02:07:28,900 --> 02:07:31,800
I just don't like getting old.

1336
02:07:32,300 --> 02:07:36,000
They put too much
chlorine in here.

1337
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I promise you, I'll never lose
myself to self-pity again.

1338
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:29,100
And I think right there
and then, she realised...

1339
02:08:29,600 --> 02:08:32,700
None of us is perfect forever.

1340
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:38,200
She found her own peace.

1341
02:08:38,900 --> 02:08:43,200
She opened a studio and taught
young girls how to dance.

1342
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:47,200
Come back the other way.

1343
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:51,200
Excellent!

1344
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Good night!

1345
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:23,000
You certainly are
beautiful to watch.

1346
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:27,300
Dance is all about the line.

1347
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:31,400
Line of your body.

1348
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:37,200
Sooner or later you lose that line,
and you never get it back.

1349
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,200
I figure...

1350
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:48,200
You were born in 1918,
49 years ago.

1351
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:50,800
I am 43.

1352
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
We are almost the same age.

1353
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,300
We're meeting in the middle.

1354
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:03,900
We finally caught up
with each other.

1355
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:08,900
Wait. I want to remember
us just as we are now.

1356
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:22,200
I am pregnant.

1357
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:43,500
You know, I swear the nurse
slipped and said it was a boy.

1358
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:00,000
But I think it's a girl.

1359
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:06,800
I know you're afraid.

1360
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,900
I'm not hiding it. -Okay.

1361
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:19,500
-What's your worst fear?
-Baby born like me.

1362
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:22,500
Then I will love it
all the more.

1363
02:11:23,500 --> 02:11:25,100
Okay.

1364
02:11:25,300 --> 02:11:29,300
How can I be a father when
I'm heading the other direction?

1365
02:11:29,500 --> 02:11:33,300
It's not fair to a child. I don't
wanna be anybody's burden.

1366
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:36,500
Sugar, we all end up in diapers.

1367
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,900
I'm gonna make this work.

1368
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:44,800
I want this,
and I want it with you.

1369
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,200
I want you to have
everything you want, all of it.

1370
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,400
I'm just not sure
how to reconcile this...

1371
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:54,900
Would you tell a blind man
he couldn't have children?

1372
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:58,500
You be a father
for as long as you can.

1373
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:01,700
I know the consequences.
I've accepted that.

1374
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:05,700
Loving you was worth
everything to me.

1375
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:11,500
I have to go pee.

1376
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:27,100
<i>The oldest woman to ever
swim the English Channel</i>

1377
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,900
<i>arrived here today, in Calais,</i>

1378
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,600
Keep it!

1379
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:34,200
<i>having made the swim in 34 hours,
22 minutes and 14 seconds.</i>

1380
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:38,100
<i>68 years old Elizabeth Abbott,
arrived at 5:38 GMT,</i>

1381
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:40,400
<i>exhausted but happy.</i>

1382
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:44,000
<i>Mrs Abbott, how would you sum
up in words this achievement?</i>

1383
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:48,900
<i>I suppose...
anything is possible.</i>

1384
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,300
Are you ready?

1385
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:58,600
Yeah.

1386
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:10,900
In the spring,
on a day like any other...

1387
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:14,000
I'll be back in an hour!

1388
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,900
Honey!

1389
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:23,900
Gotta call the ambulance!

1390
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,700
The baby is coming.

1391
02:13:28,900 --> 02:13:31,800
Operator, I need an ambulance!

1392
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:17,800
Everyone's fine. She's a
perfectly healthy baby girl.

1393
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:25,400
Honey...

1394
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:31,200
She gave birth to a five pound
four ounce baby girl.

1395
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:49,600
Did you count the toes?

1396
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:55,000
She's perfect.

1397
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:59,300
"And we named her for
my mother, Caroline."

1398
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,800
This Benjamin was my father?

1399
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:08,400
And this is how you tell me?

1400
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,300
Excuse me.

1401
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:28,500
<i>...all the conditions are there
for the major storm,</i>

1402
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:31,700
<i>possibly even up
to a cathegory 5.</i>

1403
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:41,600
Hey, I know it's hard.
You can't smoke in here.

1404
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,100
<i>Nobody can tell you exactly
where it's gonna hit...</i>

1405
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:04,400
You grew as the doctor had
promised, normal and healthy.

1406
02:16:12,700 --> 02:16:16,500
You're gonna have to find
a real father for her.

1407
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:20,500
What are you talking about?

1408
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:24,000
She's gonna need someone
to grow old with.

1409
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:27,200
She'll learn to accept whatever
happens. She loves you.

1410
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:30,700
Honey, she needs a father,
not a playmate.

1411
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:35,600
Is it me? -Of course not.

1412
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:39,500
Is my age beginning to bother you?
Is that what you're telling me?

1413
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:42,700
You can't raise both of us.

1414
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:52,900
It was your first birthday.

1415
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:57,400
We had a party for you. The
house was filled with children.

1416
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:59,600
-How are you?
-Hey, man.

1417
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:04,400
Before you turn around,
they'll be in high school, dating.

1418
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:39,500
I sold the summer house
on Lake Pontchartrain.

1419
02:17:39,700 --> 02:17:42,300
I sold Button's Buttons.

1420
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:45,100
I sold my father's sailboat.

1421
02:17:45,300 --> 02:17:48,500
I put it all into
a savings account.

1422
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:53,800
And so that you and your
mother might have a life,

1423
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:58,200
I left, before you could
ever remember me.

1424
02:18:47,500 --> 02:18:50,800
"I left with just the clothes
on my back."

1425
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,700
I don't want to read this now.

1426
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:57,000
Can you just tell me
where he went?

1427
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:00,100
I don't really know.

1428
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:14,500
It's for me. 1970. I was two.

1429
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:17,600
"Happy birthday."

1430
02:19:18,300 --> 02:19:21,900
"I wish I could've
kissed you goodnight."

1431
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:29,900
They are all for me.
Five:

1432
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:35,100
"I wish I could've taken you
to your first day of school."

1433
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:40,500
Six:

1434
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:45,700
"I wish I could've been there
to teach you to play the piano."

1435
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,900
1981, I was thirteen:

1436
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:55,300
"I wish I could've told you
not to chase some boy."

1437
02:19:55,600 --> 02:20:00,000
"I wish I could've held you
when you had a broken heart."

1438
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:04,100
"I wish I could've
been your father."

1439
02:20:04,300 --> 02:20:08,000
"Nothing I ever did
will replace that."

1440
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:16,600
I guess he went to India.

1441
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:20,000
For what it's worth,
it's never to late,

1442
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:24,600
or in my case, too early,
to be whoever you want to be.

1443
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:32,700
There is no time limit,
start whenever you want.

1444
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:39,500
You can change or stay the same.
There are no rules to this thing.

1445
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:44,400
We can make the best
or the worst of it.

1446
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:47,500
I hope you make the best of it.

1447
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:54,200
And I hope you see
things that startle you.

1448
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:59,400
I hope you feel things
you never felt before.

1449
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:05,100
I hope you meet people with
a different point of view.

1450
02:21:05,500 --> 02:21:09,200
I hope you live a life
you're proud of.

1451
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:14,000
If you find that you're not,

1452
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:19,300
I hope you have the strenght
to start all over again.

1453
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:25,000
He had been gone a long time.

1454
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:29,500
I'll see you next thursday.

1455
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:35,300
-Good night, miss Daisy.
-Good night, sweetheart.

1456
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:55,900
I'm sorry, we're closing.

1457
02:21:57,700 --> 02:22:00,300
Can I help you?

1458
02:22:00,900 --> 02:22:04,400
Are you here to
pick somebody up?

1459
02:22:13,700 --> 02:22:16,600
Why did you come back?

1460
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,600
Mom?

1461
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:21,100
Mom!

1462
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:24,100
You ready yet?

1463
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:27,900
Mom, what's wrong?

1464
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,400
I was just hearing a very sad
story about a mutual friend,

1465
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:34,700
who I hadn't seen
for a very long time.

1466
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:37,900
Caroline, this is Benjamin.

1467
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:42,100
You knew him when
you were just a baby.

1468
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:44,800
Hi. -Hi.

1469
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:48,000
Hey!

1470
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:52,800
I'm sorry, I thought
you were done.

1471
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,900
Oh, this is a friend of my
family's, Benjamin Button.

1472
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:01,300
This is my husband, Robert.
-How do you do.

1473
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,900
Pleasure.

1474
02:23:10,900 --> 02:23:14,800
It was very nice to meet you.
We'll be in the car, darling.

1475
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,100
Alright. -Bye.

1476
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:20,300
I'm just locking up.

1477
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:31,400
She's beautiful,
like her mother.

1478
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,700
Does she dance?
-Not very well.

1479
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:37,500
I guess that'd be from
my side of things.

1480
02:23:37,700 --> 02:23:40,100
She's a dear sweet girl.

1481
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:44,400
She seems a little lost.
But then, who isn't at twelve?

1482
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:48,800
There's a lot of her
that reminds me of you.

1483
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:53,400
My husband, he's a widower
... was a widower.

1484
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,200
He's an incredibly kind,
bright, adventurous man.

1485
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,600
He's been a terrific father.
-Good.

1486
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:12,700
You're so much younger.
-Only on the outside.

1487
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:16,800
You were right.

1488
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:21,200
I couldn't have been
raising both of you.

1489
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:23,900
I'm not that strong.

1490
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:30,100
So, where are you staying?

1491
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:33,400
What are you gonna do?

1492
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:37,200
I'm staying at the Pontchartrain
hotel on the avenue.

1493
02:24:37,400 --> 02:24:40,400
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1494
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:50,800
They're waiting.

1495
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:35,600
I remember that.
That was him.

1496
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:39,900
Hurricane's changed direction.
It's gonna make a landfall

1497
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
some time soon. -Am I
supposed to do something?

1498
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:44,200
Arrangements are being made to
move people, but it's up to you.

1499
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:46,300
No, no, we're staying.

1500
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:49,500
I'll let you know
if anything changes.

1501
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,100
That night, while I was
sitting and wandering

1502
02:25:54,300 --> 02:25:58,300
why I came back at all,
there was a knock at the door.

1503
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:03,400
Come in.

1504
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,800
Are you alright?

1505
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:26,000
I'm sorry, I don't know
what am I doing here.

1506
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:37,300
Nothing lasts.

1507
02:26:40,100 --> 02:26:43,100
I never stopped loving you.

1508
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:51,500
Benjamin, I'm an old woman now.

1509
02:27:01,500 --> 02:27:04,800
Some things you never forget.

1510
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:54,600
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1511
02:27:55,500 --> 02:27:57,800
Goodnight, Daisy.

1512
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:03,300
And as I knew I would...

1513
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:05,900
I watched her go.

1514
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:10,500
That's the last thing he wrote.

1515
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:16,000
Some time after
your father passed,

1516
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:19,600
there was a call.

1517
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:24,900
Hello? Yes, speaking.

1518
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:31,800
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1519
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:43,500
It's the corner house.

1520
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,200
Come on in!

1521
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:14,000
I'm Daisy Fuller.
-I'm David Hernandez

1522
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:17,900
with the Orleans Parish dept
of Child Welfare Services.

1523
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:21,300
He was living in the
condemned building.

1524
02:29:22,200 --> 02:29:25,500
The police found this
with him, this address,

1525
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:28,500
it's got your name
in here a lot.

1526
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:31,600
He's in a very poor health.
He was taken to the hospital.

1527
02:29:31,800 --> 02:29:35,700
He doesn't seem to know who or
where he is. He's very confused.

1528
02:29:35,900 --> 02:29:39,600
I was telling Mr Hernandez
that Benjamin is one of us.

1529
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:43,800
If he needs a place to stay,
it's alright. He can stay here.

1530
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:14,300
Benjamin.

1531
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:20,300
You play beautifully.

1532
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,100
He doesn't seem to
like to be touched.

1533
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:27,200
He goes in and out of
states of recognition.

1534
02:30:27,300 --> 02:30:29,500
The doctors said if they
didn't know any better...

1535
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:32,200
it is the beginnings
of dementia.

1536
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:35,500
Do you remember me?

1537
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:39,900
I'm Daisy.

1538
02:30:41,500 --> 02:30:43,800
I'm Benjamin.

1539
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:52,000
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

1540
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:58,800
Do you mind if I sit with you?
I would love to hear you play.

1541
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:05,100
Do I know you?

1542
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:15,000
And every day I would stop by
to make sure he was comfortable.

1543
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:19,900
Don't think that I don't
know what you're doing!

1544
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:22,400
You're all fucking liars!

1545
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:26,600
He doesn't believe
he just had his breakfast.

1546
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:34,200
Why don't we see if we can find
something else for you to do.

1547
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:37,800
I have a feeling there's a lot
of things I can't remember.

1548
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,500
Like what, sugar?

1549
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:45,300
It's like...
there's this whole life I had,

1550
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:49,300
and I can't remember what it was.

1551
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:56,200
It's okay.
It's okay to forget things.

1552
02:31:56,600 --> 02:32:01,800
Many times he would simply
forget who or where he was.

1553
02:32:03,900 --> 02:32:06,500
It wasn't easy.
-Benjamin!

1554
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:09,200
I can see everything!
I can see the big river!

1555
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:11,900
That's right. You can see
everything, sweetheart.

1556
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:15,300
I can see the graveyard where
mama's buried and other people.

1557
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:19,200
I want you to come down!
-What if I can fly?

1558
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:22,400
I knew a man who could fly.

1559
02:32:22,600 --> 02:32:26,000
Come down and I'll
tell you all about him.

1560
02:32:28,800 --> 02:32:31,600
Somebody go up there.

1561
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:40,000
He was five when I moved in.

1562
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:44,600
Nearly the same age I was
when I had met him.

1563
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:56,600
This is the picture of Old Man
Kangaroo at 5 in the afternoon,

1564
02:32:57,300 --> 02:33:01,100
when he got his
beautiful hind legs.

1565
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:07,600
The days passed, and I watched
as he forgot how to walk...

1566
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:15,600
What's my name?
...how to talk.

1567
02:33:15,900 --> 02:33:18,000
I'm Daisy.

1568
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:20,700
Can you say Daisy?

1569
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:27,100
In 2002, they put up a new
clock in that train station.

1570
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:37,800
And in the spring of 2003,

1571
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:44,500
he looked at me,

1572
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:50,900
and I knew that
he knew who I was.

1573
02:33:54,700 --> 02:34:00,500
And then he closed his eyes
as if he would go to sleep.

1574
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:35,500
I wish I had known him.

1575
02:34:35,800 --> 02:34:38,000
Now you do.

1576
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:45,800
Mom, I think I should go
see what's going on.

1577
02:34:52,500 --> 02:34:55,400
Goodnight, Benjamin.

1578
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:28,300
Some people are born
to sit by a river.

1579
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:31,900
Some get struck by lightning.

1580
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:35,600
Some have an ear for music.

1581
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:38,800
Some are artists.

1582
02:35:39,500 --> 02:35:41,500
Some swim.

1583
02:35:42,100 --> 02:35:44,700
Some know buttons.

1584
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:50,200
Some know Shakespeare.
Some are mothers.

1585
02:35:52,100 --> 02:35:55,600
And some people... dance.

1586
02:35:56,305 --> 02:36:02,727
