1
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,676
Ethel!

2
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,011
Ethel?

3
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:49,799
Fred...

4
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,386
Fred!

5
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,888
Fred, wake up!

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,189
Fred!

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,560
What is it, Ethel?

8
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,563
Fred, this is Lucy on the intercom.

9
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,564
Oh, oh.

10
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,565
Is Ethel there?

11
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:06,866
No.

12
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,234
Well, where is she?

13
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,235
How should I know?

14
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,620
Well, she's your wife.

15
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,124
Well, did you wake me up just to rub
it in?

16
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:15,408
Oh...

17
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,328
Listen, Ethel was supposed to be here
an hour ago.

18
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,331
I don't know how I'm gonna do all the
things I have to do

19
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,333
for the Yankee Doodle Day celebration

20
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,335
if Ethel isn't gonna cooperate with
me.

21
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,336
Honestly!

22
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,339
Listen, Fred, did you try on your
costume yet?

23
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,841
Fred, did you try on your costume
yet?

24
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,728
Really.

25
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,655
Committee member Mertz reporting.

26
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,609
Ethel, where have you been?

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,829
I've got a million things to check
with you.

28
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,664
Let me see that poster.

29
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,585
"Yankee Doodle Day Celebration."
Uh...

30
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,087
I thought it was supposed to say

31
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,589
"Lucy Ricardo, chairman

32
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,968
Did you put these posters up all over
town?

33
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,935
Yeah.

34
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:17,220
Did you nail them

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,721
to the telephone poles like I asked
you to?

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,308
All right, now. Let's see.

37
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,310
Did you call all the members of my
committee

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,146
and ask them to be here for luncheon
tomorrow?

39
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,447
Yep, I did.

40
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,281
All of them?

41
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,782
Yep, all of them.

42
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,783
Did you check the man who's writing

43
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,785
a special song about the Battle of
Campo?

44
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:33,786
Yep. I did that.

45
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,288
Did you talk to Mr. Silvestri the
sculptor,

46
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,789
make sure the statue will be ready

47
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,790
the day after tomorrow?

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,791
Yeah. Uh-huh.

49
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,792
Day after tomorrow.

50
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:40,793
Yep, yep, yep.

51
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,295
Did you rent the trailer to carry it
in?

52
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,329
Yep, yep.

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,331
Good. Oh, boy!

54
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,834
I'm never gonna be chairman of
another committee.

55
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,835
It's too much work.

56
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,173
For who?

57
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,174
For me.

58
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,142
For you?!

59
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,978
Who do you think's been doing all the
work?

60
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,930
How about... Ouch!

61
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,899
Listen, Ethel, I just mean

62
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,400
that I have all the responsibility.

63
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,736
I'm the one that has to sit home and
worry

64
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,988
about whether you're getting all the
work done or not.

65
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,824
Well, now, I'll just make you a deal.

66
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,576
Next year, I'll sit home and worry,

67
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:16,579
and you go out and nail your thumb to
a telephone pole.

68
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,081
Oh, Ethel. Listen.

69
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,583
We are commemorating a battle of the
Revolutionary War.

70
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,418
Now, let's not start one of our own.

71
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:23,836
Well, all right.
Okay.

72
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,838
Did you and Fred try on your costumes
yet?

73
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,173
Yep.
How were they?

74
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,625
Oh, mine's just fine.

75
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,510
Fred's grumbling about his as usual.

76
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,961
He's gonna wear it, isn't he?

77
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,929
Yeah, I think he is.

78
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,430
When I left this morning,

79
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,431
he was standing in front of a mirror,

80
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,433
trying on his powdered wig.

81
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,935
It was a proud sight.

82
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,937
It's the first time in 20 years

83
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:42,939
Fred's been able to brush his hair.

84
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,694
Well, I got Ricky to read the speech
at the unveiling.

85
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,528
You did?
Yeah.

86
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,812
Did you have much of a struggle?

87
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,898
No. He agreed to it right away.

88
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,150
You mean you didn't have to trick him
or anything?

89
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,401
Mm.

90
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,704
My, he's getting agreeable these
days.

91
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,156
I know. Things are working out
beautifully.

92
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,660
Ricky's getting mellow just as I'm
running out of tricks.

93
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,328
Lucy!

94
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,329
What?

95
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,248
Look at this!

96
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,749
What is it?

97
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
Fred! He chewed up my slippers!

98
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,220
Fred wouldn't do a thing like that.

99
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,722
Oh, he means the dog Fred.

100
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,723
Oh.

101
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,724
I knew we made a mistake

102
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,509
letting Little Ricky name that dog
Fred.

103
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,344
We made a mistake letting Little
Ricky

104
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,845
get the dog in the first place.

105
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,397
Where is that four-legged beast?

106
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,432
Oh, I don't know. He's up with Little
Ricky, I guess.

107
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,934
Well, where is Ricky?
He's not in his room.

108
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,936
Well, he must be up there someplace.
Ricky!

109
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,437
Yes, Mommy?

110
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,939
Is Fred up there with you?

111
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
No, Mommy.

112
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,860
What is that you have on your
face?

113
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,195
I'm a clown.

114
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,613
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!

115
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,115
He's a clown.

116
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,700
March yourself right down here, young
man.

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,702
He must have gotten into my
makeup kit.

118
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,871
Yeah. Ricky, you shouldn't put stuff
like that

119
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,707
all over your face, honey.

120
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,375
Daddy was a clown this morning.

121
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,177
Yeah, I know I was a clown this
morning,

122
00:04:54,177 --> 00:04:56,679
but that's because I'm doing a circus
number at the club.

123
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,514
I wanted to show Mommy how I was
gonna look.

124
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,932
Well, from now on,

125
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,435
you'd better not bring home your
m-a-k-e-u-p.

126
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,936
I know what that is.

127
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:04,937
You do?

128
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,439
Uh-huh. It's spelling.

129
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,940
It's spelling. Yeah.

130
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,442
Well, now, you go on upstairs

131
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,943
and take all that stuff off your
face,

132
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,945
and don't you ever get in Daddy's
makeup kit again.

133
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,063
Okay, Mommy.
Go on now.

134
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,448
Where's Fred?

135
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,950
In the den, Daddy, sleeping in your
chair.

136
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,903
In the den, sleeping in my chair.

137
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,906
You know, that dog uses my favorite
chair more than I do.

138
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,492
Well, he likes to be comfortable like
anyone else.

139
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,879
Well, then why doesn't he go out and
buy his own izzy share?

140
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,216
He's not gonna hurt your old "izzy
share."

141
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:37,136
Besides, there's a brand-new doghouse
in the backyard,

142
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,471
and you were supposed to keep him
there.

143
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,806
He doesn't like it out there.

144
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,307
Why not?
I don't know.

145
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,308
Why don't you ask him?

146
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,810
Mira, que tiene cosa...

147
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,811
el perro este no le gusta la casa de
perro...

148
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,230
And stop jabbering at me in a foreign
tongue.

149
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,482
I got enough trouble without you
being cranky.

150
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,933
I am not cranky!

151
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,153
The dog sits in my favorite chair all
the time.

152
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,156
He doesn't like the doghouse that I
bought him.

153
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,658
He chews up all my slippers.

154
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:00,159
Ever since we got that animal,

155
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,661
he's leading my life

156
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,163
and I'm leading the dog's life.

157
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,532
I'm sorry you have to hear all this
arguing, Ethel.

158
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,500
Oh, that's all right.

159
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,001
Makes me feel right at home.

160
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,004
I thought you were taking him to
obedience school.

161
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,506
I have been.

162
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,507
Well, then, how come

163
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,342
that he hasn't learned how to
obedience?

164
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,261
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's because

165
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,263
I haven't been helping him with his
homework.

166
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:21,764
Well, you'd better help him with his
homework,

167
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:23,266
or I'm going to take him right back
to the pound

168
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:24,100
that's where we got him.

169
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,018
Oh, honey, now you don't mean that.

170
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,521
Anyway, he's graduating from
obedience school tomorrow,

171
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,023
and I'm sure he's gonna come through
with flying colors.

172
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,024
Good.
Now, listen.

173
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,309
Did you try your costume on yet?

174
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,644
Oh, that's another thing.

175
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,145
I'll make the speech,

176
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,147
but I'm not gonna wear that
silly-looking

177
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,483
Yankee Doodle dandy outfit that you
got me. No.

178
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,952
Oh, honey, you look so wonderful

179
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,954
in a Revolutionary War uniform.

180
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:45,955
Oh, sure, yeah.

181
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:47,957
Yeah, those knee breeches will give
you a chance

182
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,208
to show off your good-looking legs.

183
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,494
I am not going to be seen

184
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,747
in those silly early-American
snickers.

185
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,632
It's knickers.

186
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:58,885
That's what I said-- snickers.

187
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,670
Well, now, look.
you're making a mistake.

188
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,671
I'll leave it to you, Ethel.

189
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,172
Doesn't he have good-looking legs?

190
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,143
Come on, now, will you?
Cut it out.

191
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,145
Well, everybody else is wearing a
costume.

192
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:10,513
Yeah, Rick.
Even Fred.

193
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,397
Yeah? What's he wearing?

194
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,765
Oh, he's got a wonderful one.

195
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,267
He's gonna be the town crier.

196
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,269
He's gonna go through the town
ringing a bell,

197
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,020
announcing all the ceremonies.

198
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,656
This I got to see.

199
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:21,574
Well, will you wear it or not?

200
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,075
All right, all right.

201
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,076
I'll go learn my speech.

202
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,328
Okay, he will.
Oh, honestly.

203
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,696
They give you a fight, don't they?

204
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,197
What you have to go through...

205
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,198
Boy, oh, boy.

206
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,700
...to get him into costume for a
thing like this.

207
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,201
Hear ye!

208
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,921
Hear ye! Hear ye!

209
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,707
Oh, Fred, you look wonderful!

210
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,211
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!

211
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:46,632
Get yourself another town crier!

212
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,102
What are you talking about?

213
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,938
I refuse to do this fool thing.

214
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,639
Well, why, Fred?

215
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,777
Well, first of all, this ding-dang
wig is too hot!

216
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,564
How do people stand it when they have
hair?

217
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,399
Listen, Fred.
Maybe you can do it

218
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,400
without the wig, huh?

219
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,902
That's not all.

220
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,737
These things are killing my feet.

221
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,206
If their shoes pinched like these,

222
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:12,959
no wonder the town criers cried.

223
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,795
Fred, we can get you some bigger
shoes.

224
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,296
Oh, sure, Fred. You gotta do
something

225
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,298
to celebrate Yankee Doodle Day.

226
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,300
Well, I can always stick a feather in
my hat

227
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,802
and call it macaroni.

228
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,220
Oh, now, Fred.

229
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,222
Fred!

230
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:27,223
Come on, now.

231
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,724
Say you'll be the town crier.

232
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:32,144
No, sir. I wouldn't go yelling
through town in this outfit

233
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,931
if the British were to come back
again!

234
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,731
Oh, Fred!

235
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:36,732
I'll get him to do it.

236
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:37,733
Don't worry about it.

237
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:38,734
I'll get him to do it.

238
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,019
Now, listen, Fred...

239
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,355
Fred! Fred! Fred!

240
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,608
Fred! Fred!

241
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,409
Where did he go?

242
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,327
What did he do?

243
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,112
He chewed up my whole speech.

244
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,916
Oh. Well, now, honey, don't, don't,
don't be mad at him.

245
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:54,917
He won't do these things

246
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:56,669
once he's graduated from obedience
school.

247
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,672
If you ask me, we should have sent
him to reform school.

248
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,673
Oh...

249
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,177
"Fellow citizens of Westport,

250
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,180
"we're gathered here on Yankee Doodle
Day

251
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,468
to commemorate, to unveil and
dedicate a statue."

252
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:21,310
"The statue will commemorate the
great bravery and daring courage

253
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,313
"of the patriots of this community

254
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,951

"many of whom are still living...

259
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,080
Hi, dear.

260
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,165
in this..." Oh, hi.

261
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,967
Congratulations are in order.
Fred graduated!

262
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,752
Well! Congratulations, old man!

263
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,054
What's that?

264
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,088
That's his diploma.

265
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,473
Well, we'll frame it up

266
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:51,974
and put it in his doghouse.
Yeah.

267
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,759
Did he really learn something?

268
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,678
Well, I told you he graduated.

269
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,565
Well, good for you, because I'm
running out of slippers.

270
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,018
Hey, who set the table for my
luncheon?

271
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,486
Oh, Ethel did.

272
00:10:03,486 --> 00:10:04,987
And there's a beautiful plate

273
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,322
of cold cuts back in the kitchen.

274
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:07,773
Oh, good.
They're delicious.

275
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,660
What are you doing?

276
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,663
These cold cuts are for my committee
members.

277
00:10:13,663 --> 00:10:15,114
Well, what is the principal speaker

278
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,415
supposed to eat for lunch?

279
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,700
I'll fix you

280
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,035
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

281
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,370
Thanks a lot.

282
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,124
Well, Fred, now let's see if you
really graduated.

283
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,459
I want you to take this diploma,

284
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,462
take it over to Little Ricky upstairs
and show it to him.

285
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,963
Then after you do that,

286
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,265
I want you to the diploma over to the
guest house

287
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,434
and show it to Aunt Ethel and Uncle
Fred.

288
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,553
Oh, for heaven's sake, Ricky.

289
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,055
He can't do all that.

290
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,606
Well, you just told me

291
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,608
he graduated from obedience school.

292
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,609
Well, he learned obedience,

293
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,064
but he's not ready for The Ed
Sullivan Show.

294
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:48,781
What can he do?

295
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,149
He can do lots of things.

296
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,652
He can sit up, he can speak, he can
roll over.

297
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,953
I'll show you later.

298
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:54,737
Well, show me now.

299
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:55,738
No. I haven't got time now, honey.

300
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:56,956
I gotta get this luncheon going.

301
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,290
Listen. I paid 30 bucks

302
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,875
for this character to go to that
school.

303
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,161
I want to see what he learned.

304
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,580
I don't want to show you right now.

305
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,798
I will show you later.

306
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,919
Apparently, the wrong one went to
obedience school.

307
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,421
Oh, all right.

308
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,425
Show what you learned to Senor Simon
Legree.

309
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,428
Leash. Come on, now, Fred.

310
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,429
All righty, boy.

311
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,932
Show Daddy what we learned here, huh?

312
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,317
Oh, boy, he graduated top honors,

313
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,319
too, boy.
All right, now.

314
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:28,237
Sit up, honey.

315
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:29,488
Sit up, Fred.

316
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,607
Fred, sit up.

317
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,159
Come on, Fred, sit up.

318
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,528
Aw, come on, Fred.
You know how to sit up.

319
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,279
Now, you're not paying attention.
Come on, now.

320
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,864
Sit up.
Here we go.

321
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,999
Up we go.

322
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,367
Up, up, up, up, Fred. Up!

323
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,336
Show Daddy how you can sit up.

324
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,838
Come on here. Fred, up.

325
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,760
You know how to sit up.

326
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,211
You know how to sit up.
Come on, honey.

327
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,963
Never mind the lovemaking.

328
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,797
Just come on, now. Sit up.

329
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,765
I want you to sit up.

330
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:57,266
Now, pay attention. Up, boy.

331
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,051
Up.

332
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,436
Aw, come on, now.
You know how to it.

333
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:02,271
Look. Like this. See? Like this.

334
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,199
I guess he just doesn't feel like
sitting up right now.

335
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,067
No, I guess not.

336
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,870
Well, actually, sitting up wasn't his
best subject.

337
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,455
Oh?

338
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:21,373
No. Let's try speaking.

339
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,374
Here we go now.

340
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,376
All right, Fred, pay attention now.

341
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,162
All right, speak!

342
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,830
Speak, boy!

343
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,799
Speak! Fred?

344
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,550
Speak, speak, speak!

345
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,418
Come on, say something.

346
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,419
Talk up a storm, boy!

347
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,754
Come on. Say something.

348
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,388
Speak, Fred!

349
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,593
Come on, say something for me.

350
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,094
Just a couple of words, huh?

351
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:42,895
Oh, now, Fred, stop.

352
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,396
Come on. Speak.

353
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:51,187
I guess he didn't head his class in
speaking either.

354
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,489
Well, actually, he isn't supposed to
speak

355
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:56,358
unless he wants something, you know,
like his dinner.

356
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,327
Oh. Oh, I see.

357
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,696
He's a before-dinner speaker.

358
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:02,998
Yeah, well.

359
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:04,366
Here's something he does very well.

360
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,868
Now, watch.

361
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,919
Okay, Fred.

362
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,171
Now, roll over and play dead!

363
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:10,456
Come on, Fred.

364
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,208
Come on now, roll over and play dead.

365
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,542
Come on. Roll over and play dead,
boy.

366
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,011
Come on. Down you go.
Play dead.

367
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,429
Fred...

368
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,136
Come on now, roll over and play dead,
boy.

369
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,021
Fred, pay attention to me.

370
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:29,475
Look. Look, Fred. Fred...

371
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,976
Like this.

372
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,117
Are you sure they didn't give him the
diploma

373
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,485
just to get rid of him?

374
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,954
Well, I don't understand it.

375
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,456
He did everything beautifully for the
instructor at school.

376
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,826
Look, I'm gonna give you one more
chance here.

377
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,294
Now, you stand up there.

378
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,796
Now, Fred, pay attention!

379
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,466
Go get it, boy!

380
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,421
Fred, go get it.

381
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:05,060
Fred! Go get it!

382
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,429
Fetch the paper, Frederick.

383
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,984
Can't you do just one trick, for me,
Fred? Come on.

384
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,319
Fred, look.

385
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,994
Nice Lucy.

386
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,246
Nice Lucy.

387
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:26,665
Here. You deserve this more than he
does.

388
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,171
Well, he just must be exhausted

389
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,173
for cramming for all of his exams,
that's all.

390
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:35,674
He needs a vacation.

391
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,626
Good. Then he can go out in the
doghouse

392
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,928
and then he can take his vacation.

393
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,679
He doesn't like it out there.

394
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,681
Well, that's too bad.

395
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:44,683
But if he's not smart enough to
learn, how...

396
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,102
Shh! Don't talk like that in front of
Fred.

397
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:48,604
You'll hurt his feelings.

398
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,356
Come on, Fred.

399
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,107
Fred.

400
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,193
Fred!

401
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,061
Oh, Fred!

402
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,536
You big bully.

403
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,493
Now, what were you saying?

404
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,330
I was saying that if he's not smart
enough to mind,

405
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,831
he can stay in the doghouse.

406
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,999
You're mean!

407
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,801
Since when is mean for a dog

408
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,085
to stay in his doghouse?

409
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,971
When the dog doesn't like the
doghouse,

410
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,472
he's not happy out there.

411
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:24,890
Why shouldn't he be happy out there?

412
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,892
It's a beautiful doghouse.

413
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,394
It's very roomy.

414
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,895
It's brand-new.

415
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,397
It doesn't have a mortgage.

416
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,149
And he doesn't have a wife to nag
him.

417
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,435
Oh, there's no talking to you.

418
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
I have things to do.

419
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,938
We'll discuss this later.

420
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,611
Fellow citizens of Westport,

421
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:49,114
we are gathered here on Yankee
Doodle...

422
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,950
Oh, no!

423
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,369
Oh, you naughty dog!

424
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,586
What's the matter?

425
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,756
He licked half of the cold cuts on
that platter!

426
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:58,457
Where are you going?

427
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,842
I'm going to put him out

428
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,844
in the doghouse where he belongs!

429
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,967
...On Doodle Dandy Day to dedicate...

430
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,544
Ethel, wait till you see it.

431
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,045
Mr. Silvestri did a wonderful job.

432
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,547
Oh, I can hardly wait!

433
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,249
Oh, it's really...
It's just beautiful.

434
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,752
Are you ready?

435
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,753
Yeah.

436
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,505
Oh!

437
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:32,057
Oh, it's pretty lifelike, isn't it?

438
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,842
Oh, I should say it is.

439
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:36,562
I thought I saw him squeeze the
trigger.

440
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,230
Ha, ha!

441
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,732
Isn't it great?

442
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,233
It is just great!

443
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,651
When do you take it over to Jessup
Green?

444
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,153
Well, I'm going to get it there

445
00:16:44,153 --> 00:16:46,155
just a few minutes before Ricky does
the unveiling.

446
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,157
That way nobody will be able to peek
at it

447
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:49,158
before the ceremony.

448
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,159
Where is Ricky?

449
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:51,660
He's over at the newspaper office.

450
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,162
They're taking some pictures

451
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:54,663
for the Yankee Doodle Day
celebration.

452
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:56,665
Mommy! Mommy!

453
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:57,583
What?

454
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,084
Fred ran away!

455
00:16:59,084 --> 00:16:59,952
Fred ran away?

456
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:00,953
Which Fred?

457
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:01,954
My dog!

458
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,455
Oh, nuts.

459
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,923
Are you sure?

460
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,176
Are you sure he ran away?

461
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:07,960
His rope's chewed up,

462
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,428
and there's a hole in the fence.

463
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,430
Oh, dear. It's my fault for putting
him

464
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,765
out there in that doghouse.

465
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,633
Now, honey, he's around here
someplace.

466
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,634
We'll find him.
Oh, dear.

467
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,635
Fred!
Fred!

468
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:17,636
Fred!
Fred!

469
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,138
Fred!
Fred!

470
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,139
Fred!
Fred?

471
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,106
What do you want?

472
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,608
Oh, not you.

473
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,610
We're calling the dog.

474
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,611
He ran away.

475
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,112
Oh, Mommy, where is he?

476
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,614
We'll find him, honey. I promise.

477
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,115
Don't worry, honey.

478
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,617
Fred!

479
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,153
Lucy, your phone's ringing.
Lucy..

480
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,070
What?

481
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,488
Your phone.
Your phone.

482
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,040
You keep looking.
We will, honey.

483
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,826
Fred!

484
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:41,827
Fred!
Fred!

485
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:42,711
Hello.

486
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,213
Oh, hello, Grace.

487
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:45,714
Yeah.

488
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,716
Yeah, we just found out a minute ago.

489
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,718
He did?

490
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:51,220
Which way did he go?

491
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,006
Oh. Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Grace.

492
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,890
Oh, dear!

493
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,391
Fred.

494
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,393
Fred! Fred!

495
00:17:58,393 --> 00:17:59,228
Can't you hear me?

496
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,679
Yeah, I can hear you.

497
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,681
Well, why didn't you answer?

498
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,599
I thought you were calling the dog.

499
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,983
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

500
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,436
Tell Ethel and Ricky to come in here
right away.

501
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:09,438
Ethel!
Yes?

502
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:11,440
Come on.
Lucy wants you.

503
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:13,742
What's up?

504
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,160
Grace Munson just called and said

505
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,162
that she saw a dog that looked like
Fred

506
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,497
running up the road past her house.

507
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,833
Oh! That's almost a mile away from
here!

508
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,201
Maybe it wasn't our Fred.

509
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,169
Well, we gotta track down every lead.

510
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,004
Now, listen, I'm gonna drive over to
the Munsons'.

511
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,923
You go out and get Bruce Ramsey,
honey.

512
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:28,924
Look all around the neighborhood.

513
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:29,925
Hear?
Okay, Mommy.

514
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:30,793
You stay here in case there're

515
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:31,794
any more calls, will you, Ethel?

516
00:18:32,294 --> 00:18:33,045
Oh, sure.

517
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:34,429
Lucy, you call us, now, if you find
him.

518
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,881
Yeah, I will.
I'll look around here.

519
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,382
Maybe he's hiding inside.

520
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:38,383
I'll look in the kitchen.

521
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,860
Fred!

522
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,861
What?

523
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,146
I'm calling the dog.

524
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:53,148
Oh, for corn sakes.

525
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:55,984
I haven't been right once today.

526
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,953
Maybe it'd make things simpler

527
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:58,954
if you changed your name.

528
00:18:58,954 --> 00:18:59,872
To what?

529
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,323
Rover.

530
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:04,877
Very funny!

531
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,328
I'll go and look in the den.

532
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,714
I'll go upstairs and look, Fred.

533
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,674
Hey!
What was that?

534
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:20,175
Something sounded like a wreck out
there in back.

535
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,176
No, no. It was out here, Fred.

536
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,177
No, it was in back.

537
00:19:22,177 --> 00:19:23,178
I know it was out there.

538
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:24,179
My ear tells me it's in the back.

539
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,180
It sounded just like it was out
front.

540
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,432
It's out back!
Now go on!

541
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,104
Lucy, are you all right?

542
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,573
I'm all right, but look at him.

543
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,075
Oh, my goodness, honey.

544
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,577
What happened?

545
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,578
Oh, I jumped in the car

546
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,413
and forgot all about the trailer

547
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,915
and backed right into that elm tree.

548
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,333
Wouldn't you know it?

549
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,835
The poor guy got through the
Revolutionary War

550
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:48,337
without a scratch,

551
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:50,339
but five minutes with you and he's
finished.

552
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,424
Oh, be quiet, Fred.

553
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,927
Uh, Lucy, maybe we can glue it back
together.

554
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,879
Glue what back together?

555
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,881
This is all that's left of him.

556
00:19:58,881 --> 00:19:59,798
Oh, my goodness.

557
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,633
Well, you gotta do something.

558
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,051
You've got to fix it.

559
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:06,054
Oh, how can I fix it, for heaven's
sake?

560
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:11,860
Doesn't look very good.

561
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,778
Lucy.
What?

562
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,279
The unveiling's in an hour.

563
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,113
What are you gonnna do?

564
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,064
Oh, dear, I don't know.

565
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,566
But while I'm thinking,

566
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:18,567
will you drive over to the Munsons',

567
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:20,319
find Little Ricky and go find the
dog, will you?

568
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,653
Sure.
Yeah.

569
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,654
Oh...

570
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,657
See you later, shorty.

571
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,660
Ethel, what am I gonna do?

572
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,662
They'll throw me out of the
Historical Society.

573
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,130
Oh, you'll be lucky

574
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,632
if they don't throw you out of town.

575
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:34,883
Oh, dear.

576
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:37,669
Hey, I'll call Mr. Silvestri

577
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:39,004
and see if he's got another one.

578
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,473
Another one?

579
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,176
They don't make statues in pairs like
bookends.

580
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,512
Oh, it doesn't hurt to ask.

581
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,513
Mr. Silvestri?

582
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,515
This is Mrs. Ricardo.

583
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,518
Yeah. You know the statue you made
for us?

584
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:58,023
Well, by any chance, do you happen to
have a spare?

585
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,524
Oh, you don't, huh?

586
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,526
Well, could you make another one?

587
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,327
Oh, good!

588
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,830
How long will it take?

589
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,114
Two weeks!

590
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, dear.

591
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,003
Well, could you make it sooner?

592
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,507
Well, I was thinking in about an
hour, maybe?

593
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,011
Yeah, well, all right, all right, all
right, Mr. Silvestri.

594
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,013
Well, you start on it right now, huh?

595
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,015
Yeah. What?

596
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,017
Why do I want another one?

597
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,385
Why? Why?

598
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,219
Why, Ethel?

599
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,137
Why do we want two of them?

600
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:32,140
Uh... well...
Westport is growing

601
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,142
and it may become twin cities

602
00:21:34,142 --> 00:21:35,944
like Saint Paul and Minneapolis.

603
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:38,814
Yeah, well, you know, Mr. Silvestri,

604
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:42,818
Westport is growing so, it just might
become twin cities

605
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,821
like Saint Appolis and Minnie Paul.

606
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,875
Minneapolis and Saint Paul.

607
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,376
Oh.

608
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,879
Well, you just go ahead, Mr.
Silvestri,

609
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,881
and we'll think up a reason later.

610
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,884
I mean, I'll tell you the reason
later. Yeah.

611
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,386
Oh, uh, Mr. Silvestri,

612
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:06,892
incidentally, is the, uh, the first
statue insured?

613
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,727
Oh! Oh, thank goodness!

614
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,596
Yeah, well, just start on the...

615
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:12,597
on the other one.

616
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,099
Thanks very much.

617
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,401
Oh! Thank goodness that's over.

618
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,769
Now all you have to do

619
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,271
is postpone the ceremonies for two
weeks.

620
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,188
Yeah.

621
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:21,490
Postpone the...?

622
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,825
I can't postpone the ceremonies!

623
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:26,278
Everybody in town will be over there
in an hour.

624
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:27,779
Well, what are you gonna do?

625
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,082
I don't know. I forgot all about the
ceremonies.

626
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,366
Oh, dear.

627
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:32,868
Oh, Ethel.

628
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,873
Hey, I got an idea.

629
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,760
No, maybe it's too wild.

630
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,262
If you've got an idea that you think
is too wild,

631
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,264
I don't want to hear it.

632
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,885
No, I think it will work.

633
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:51,853
Yeah, I think so.

634
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,789
You know, we're going to have

635
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,290
ice cream and cake later.

636
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,291
Are you having a good time, honey?

637
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,793
Yes.

638
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,295
Fred! Fred, you found Fred!

639
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,797
Oh, let him through here. Oh, Fred!

640
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,298
Yeah, I found him.
I found him all right.

641
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,800
Oh, bless his little heart.

642
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,135
Where was he?

643
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,636
Well, you will never believe it.

644
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,138
He was sitting on the steps

645
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,005
of the obedience school.

646
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,473
Oh, Fred.

647
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,258
Now, why do you suppose he went
there?

648
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,227
Well, I guess he heard he had a bad
report.

649
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,229
He was trying to sign up for summer
school.

650
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:35,013
Oh, maybe.

651
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,432
Your mommy's here, honey.

652
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:38,433
You'll see her pretty soon.

653
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,152
And your daddy's getting ready to
make a speech.

654
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,486
Did you know that?
Yeah.

655
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,163
Fellow citizens of Westport,

656
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,499
we are gathered here on Yankee Doodle
Day

657
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,003
to unveil and dedicate a statue--

658
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,504
a statue which commemorates

659
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,007
the great bravery and daring courage

660
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,509
of the patriots of this community

661
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,513
during the Battle of Campo in 1777.

662
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:14,019
So I hereby dedicate this statue to
these brave men and women,

663
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,520
and to their descendants,

664
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,525
many of whom are still living in this
community.

665
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,811
And now, for the unveiling.

666
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:28,116
Here we go!

667
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:00,515
Lucy?

668
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:04,986
Lucy!

669
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:17,115
Shoot, if you must, this old redhead.

670
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,920
Un momento, un momento que ha pasado
algo...

671
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,421
Fred...

672
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,923
Que ha pasado algo...
