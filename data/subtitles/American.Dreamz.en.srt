1
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:40,582
How are the numbers?

2
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:42,834
Incredible.

3
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:47,411
Absolutely incredible.

4
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,718
Congratulations.

5
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:55,263
I'm leaving you.

6
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,436
Did you hear what I said?

7
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,428
I'm leaving you.

8
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,972
Yeah, I heard. Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,112
- I'm not kidding.
- I know.

10
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:18,776
Look, I think
it's an excellent decision on your part.

11
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:21,122
You do?

12
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:24,459
You're a fantastic person,

13
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:29,214
and the last year's been great, really.

14
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,883
You're beautiful.

15
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,427
The sex has been wonderful.

16
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:36,721
You're kind and supportive.

17
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:40,590
You wait for me with dinner
when I work late, you're amazing.

18
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:44,135
And it's driving me out of my fucking mind!

19
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:48,931
You know, with numbers like this,

20
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,568
this should be the happiest day of my life,

21
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:54,906
and instead I have to worry about
whether I make you happy all the time!

22
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,078
Jessica, sweetheart,

23
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,291
you make me feel like being a better person.

24
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,502
And I'm not a better person.

25
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,411
I'm me.

26
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,124
I feel sorry for you.

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,975
Don't.

28
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,550
I certainly don't.

29
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,525
In fact, I envy myself deeply.

30
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,723
- Morning.
- Morning.

31
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,594
Good morning, Mr President.

32
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:51,731
And congratulations.

33
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:54,567
It's good to have you with us
for another four years.

34
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:57,404
Thank you, Thomas. It's good to be back.

35
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,157
Would you like me to turn on the TV, sir?

36
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:05,995
Oh, no. That's okay.

37
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:09,249
Hey, I'll tell you what.

38
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:12,335
- How about the paper?
- The paper, sir?

39
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,869
Yeah. What the heck?

40
00:04:14,996 --> 00:04:18,915
We'll see what the New York Times
has to say about things.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,845
Bet they're eating some crow this morning.

42
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,888
We have a copy anywhere?

43
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:25,473
We can get one, sir.

44
00:04:25,257 --> 00:04:29,060
All right, get one.
And scare up my reading glasses.

45
00:04:30,262 --> 00:04:32,939
I'm going to read the newspaper.

46
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,515
Shall I bring it to the workout room, sir?

47
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:39,029
No, I'm gonna read my paper
right here in bed.

48
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,239
Take it a little easy this morning.

49
00:04:41,022 --> 00:04:43,366
Well, you deserve it, sir.

50
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,244
Yes, I do. It was a heck of a fight.

51
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,538
Yes, sir, a heck of a fight.

52
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:52,156
The important thing is the good guys won.

53
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:14,856
Cut!

54
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:28,953
Cut!

55
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:44,917
Cut!

56
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:49,474
This guy is pathetic!
He's ruining every shot!

57
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,643
You, come here!

58
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,896
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Sorry?

59
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,095
Is that what you're going to say

60
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,431
when you endanger your brothers
on the holy mission?

61
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,933
- No.
- Just stay out of the shot.

62
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,613
Yes, sir.

63
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:07,784
My wife's cousin.
Otherwise, I send him back home tomorrow!

64
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:11,287
Okay, everybody, from the top, huh?
Let's shoot this puppy!

65
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,706
Come on. Come on.

66
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:10,096
One, pah!

67
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,672
Singular sensation

68
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,091
Every little step she takes

69
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,937
One, pah!

70
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,513
Thrilling combination

71
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,182
Every move that she makes

72
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,365
One smile and suddenly nobody

73
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:31,117
else will do

74
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:35,705
You know you'll never be lonely

75
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,625
With you-know-who

76
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,535
One moment

77
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,713
Oh!

78
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,298
What is this?

79
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:46,841
Was I being loud?

80
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,302
You could hear it down into the valley.

81
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,388
Hey...

82
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,225
That was rare.

83
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,768
You are lucky it was me who found you,

84
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:59,688
not one of the others
because they would cut your throat!

85
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:02,649
I'm so sorry. I like show tunes.

86
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:06,893
I grew up listening to them,
my mother had a collection of 50 records.

87
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,280
Your mother was killed
by an American bomb.

88
00:08:09,064 --> 00:08:10,740
I know that.

89
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:13,024
That is why I'm here.

90
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:15,995
Look, I've got some news for you.

91
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,997
Your papers came through.

92
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:21,532
You are leaving next week for Frankfurt,
and from there to Orange County.

93
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:24,994
You'll be staying at our mutual cousins'.
They know nothing of your purpose there.

94
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:28,425
You are to just wait
until your sleeper cell contacts you.

95
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,218
When will that be?

96
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,887
Never.

97
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,106
I can't. I just can't, I can't, I can't.
I can't possibly. I can't do it.

98
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:47,610
It's too horrible.
Please, not another season, please.

99
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:51,031
I beg you, don't make me do it.
Don't make me do it.

100
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:52,532
- Don't make me do it.
- Everyone's ready for you, sir.

101
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:56,484
Right, terrific. Okay, let's go!
Let's rock and roll, yeah?

102
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,073
Good morning. Good morning, everyone.
Lovely to see you again.

103
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:05,837
Or, rather, not see you.
Can we have the house lights, please?

104
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,380
Now?

105
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,215
Now?

106
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,761
Not next Tuesday. Cheers. Boo!

107
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:14,095
Boo!

108
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,140
Here we are again. Here we are, yet again.

109
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,394
Here we are, producing
the most popular show on television.

110
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:25,430
The show to which not only America,
but now the whole world is glued. Yay!

111
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:32,113
Which brings me to the task at hand.

112
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:34,407
When you're on top,
there's only one place to go.

113
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,451
- And where is that?
- Down!

114
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:38,286
Who said that?

115
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,992
"Down" is an incorrect answer.

116
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:50,632
The answer is "up." Up!

117
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,876
Because if you go down,
do you know what happens?

118
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:59,464
All those people who were buttering you up
and smiling at you just moments ago

119
00:09:59,257 --> 00:10:02,977
leap on you and kick you and kick you

120
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,763
and kick you and kick you
and kick you until you shut up.

121
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:13,196
Down is not an option.

122
00:10:15,857 --> 00:10:17,242
So,

123
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,569
let's go out there
and get some great contestants.

124
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:25,041
And I don't just mean talented,
I mean human.

125
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:29,952
And by human, I mean flawed.
And by flawed, I mean freaks.

126
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:31,996
Bring me some freaks.

127
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,749
Let's make this a show
that even I would watch.

128
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:40,140
- Is it them? Is that them?
- Don't run!

129
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:44,425
Wait, wait, wait! Your hair!

130
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:47,678
- Okay, okay, okay. Stop, Mom.
- All right. Go!

131
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,527
Oh, Goddess, please, please, please.

132
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,828
- Sally Kendoo?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,705
We're from American Dreamz.

134
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:06,833
- I know.
- And we're here to tell you...

135
00:11:06,616 --> 00:11:08,908
You've been selected
to perform on the show.

136
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,494
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

137
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:13,548
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

138
00:11:13,331 --> 00:11:14,799
You know what.

139
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,386
Just once I would like to tell when...
What are you doing?

140
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:20,680
Sorry. Screaming.

141
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:23,214
- Yes! Yes!
- Stop! Stop, stop screaming.

142
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,726
- Stop.
- Dude.

143
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:28,521
I'm really sorry.
We're gonna have to do this all over again.

144
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:31,399
You're gonna have to go inside,
and come out

145
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,360
and jump for joy all over again,

146
00:11:33,143 --> 00:11:35,935
because we didn't get it on camera.

147
00:11:36,605 --> 00:11:38,073
Okay.

148
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,697
Yes! I got it! I got it!

149
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,834
- She's good.
- Yes! Yes!

150
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:54,036
There's my guy.

151
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:56,257
Congratulations, Mr President.

152
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,709
You said we'd tear them a new one
and we tore them a new one.

153
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,388
Excuse me.

154
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:04,099
The big guy up there tore them a new one.
He smited them.

155
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:06,340
- Smote.
- Smote, smited, whatever.

156
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:08,311
What's with the papers? New puppy?

157
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,386
- They're newspapers.
- I can see that.

158
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,274
- Hi, Mrs P. You look beautiful.
- Good morning, Wally.

159
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:16,809
- So, Mr P, you ready to meet the press?
- Not right now.

160
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,863
Mr P, we discussed this.

161
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,908
I mean, it was your idea
to meet the press after the big win.

162
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:26,371
Herald in a new era of openness,
what with our overwhelming mandate.

163
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:30,542
Yeah, I know.
It's just that there is a lot of stuff in here.

164
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:33,503
It... There's a lot of interesting things.

165
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:37,090
Well, yeah, there is a lot of stuff.
They have to fill the pages with something.

166
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:39,634
But I think "interesting" is stretching it.

167
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:42,512
Well, for instance, did you know

168
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:46,808
that there are two kinds of Iraqistanis?

169
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:48,966
I mean, actually,

170
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,730
three kinds of Iraqis.

171
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:54,357
Do you mean,
Sunnis and Shiites and Kurds?

172
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,224
You knew about this?

173
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:58,392
So did you. You knew this, Mr P.

174
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:00,864
- Yeah, but...
- It's in your weekly digests.

175
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,022
It's not like in this country,

176
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:07,162
where whites and blacks and Latinos
all get along

177
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:11,082
and there's no prejudicial deal
between them. I mean, these people,

178
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:14,002
they have some long-standing
beefs with each other.

179
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:17,954
Look, honey.
American Dreamz is coming on again soon.

180
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,717
That's great. Great.

181
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:24,836
Mr President,
we have to get you dressed and prepped.

182
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,723
The press is waiting for you.

183
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,132
You mean,
they're all out there waiting for me?

184
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:30,685
They certainly are.

185
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:40,403
Well, I just want to sit here
and read for a while.

186
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:43,521
I think I deserve a break.
I'm kind of exhausted.

187
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:45,075
Mr P, we need...

188
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,526
I am not going out there right now,
g-damn it!

189
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:53,375
Move it. Fun in a bucket.
Fun in a bucket, everybody.

190
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:55,502
All right, all right.

191
00:13:55,577 --> 00:13:58,338
Hey, Willie, where's Sally?
Get her down here!

192
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:00,006
- Oh, you know how girls are.
- Yeah.

193
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,677
Hey, man. That's some girlfriend you got.
When you gonna marry that girl?

194
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,220
We're talking about it, Uncle Fitz.

195
00:14:05,003 --> 00:14:07,044
We're thinking maybe next spring, huh?

196
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:08,796
All righty. All right!

197
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:19,150
- Hey, Sally, it's you-know-who.
- Come on in, Willie.

198
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:21,945
The door's locked, babe.

199
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:32,945
What are you doing up here, Sally,

200
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,875
when everybody's down there
celebrating your triumph?

201
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:39,379
Great.
I'm really excited for them.

202
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,881
And they're really excited for you.

203
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,094
You know, I am, too. I don't think
I've ever been prouder in my life.

204
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,429
You know what?

205
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:51,214
I was pretty excited for myself, too,
for like a half hour.

206
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:55,603
And then it sunk in that this means nothing.

207
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,981
Nothing?

208
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:01,474
Sally, this is your dream.
You've always wanted to be on TV.

209
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:04,654
No. I've always wanted to be a star.

210
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,322
Isn't that the same thing?

211
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:10,660
No, Willie, it's not the same thing.
Any idiot can be on TV nowadays.

212
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:14,998
All you have to do is swap your wife
or eat a sheep's anus or something.

213
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,418
Yes. Yes, but you are gonna sing.

214
00:15:18,994 --> 00:15:21,119
Yeah. I'm gonna sing.

215
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,382
I'm gonna sing. And I'm not good enough.

216
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,332
I'm not good enough!

217
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:28,709
- Seven years!
- No, you know what I am?

218
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:32,724
I am the best karaoke singer
in this county of Ohio.

219
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:34,549
I'm going to go all the way out there, right?

220
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:35,842
And I'm gonna come right back home

221
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,396
and lose in the first round
because I'm just... I'm not good enough!

222
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,564
- No way.
- Yes.

223
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:40,732
- No way.
- Yes.

224
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:43,902
No way, no way, no way. You're cute.

225
00:15:44,394 --> 00:15:46,571
You got a great voice.

226
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:48,980
You got personality.

227
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,941
And you got a great voice.

228
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:55,747
Why, I think you're gonna win
the whole damn thing.

229
00:15:55,906 --> 00:16:00,158
And if for some reason those folks
have their heads up their stinkholes

230
00:15:59,951 --> 00:16:02,076
and you don't win, for whatever reason,

231
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,162
I'm not gonna love you any less.

232
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,425
I'm gonna love you more
because I see your real beauty

233
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,470
and I don't need no TV show
to show it to me.

234
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:14,224
Honey, I got some big news today, too.

235
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,857
I'm being made assistant manager,
plumbing fixtures.

236
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:26,111
Assistant manager.

237
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:29,072
And you know what happens next.

238
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:31,397
Manager, plumbing fixtures.

239
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,109
Willie?

240
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:38,780
I think it's time we broke up.

241
00:16:39,783 --> 00:16:41,199
What?

242
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,578
It's just... I don't think it's working anymore.

243
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:48,425
- Sure it is. It's going great.
- Not really.

244
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,833
No, your life is here.

245
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,960
And my life is...

246
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:55,390
Or maybe it's...

247
00:16:57,592 --> 00:17:01,094
But either way, see, I can't take you with me.

248
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,191
But I love you.

249
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:08,945
I love you. Damn it, you can't do this to me.

250
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:13,033
No, listen. You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me, I can't take it.

251
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:15,191
You stay up here and cry.

252
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,444
I'm going to go down and greet my fans.

253
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,123
Sally!

254
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:26,285
Hi, everyone!
Now, who'd like to hear a little song?

255
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,289
Yeah!

256
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:40,727
She's a very freaky girl

257
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:44,147
The kind you don't bring home to mama

258
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:47,442
She's a super freak
Super freak

259
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:49,986
She's super freaky

260
00:17:53,857 --> 00:17:55,492
Wrong!

261
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,650
Do you want this?

262
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:59,318
Do you?

263
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:01,654
Well, then get your ass in gear!

264
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,906
- Lqbal, darling.
- What?

265
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,753
Your cousin Omer is arriving any minute.

266
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:10,298
Okay, I'll be up in a moment.
I'm doing something here.

267
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:14,761
No, not in a moment.
A moment with you stretches into an hour.

268
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:18,682
Your cousin has come halfway around
the world. Let's show him some hospitality.

269
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:20,392
You come up right now!

270
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:24,396
Don't get me upset today, okay?
You know I don't like to get upset.

271
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,033
Nazneen!

272
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:41,235
What a home. It is stupendous.

273
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,707
What, this old place? Nazneen!

274
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,875
Nazneen!

275
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:48,576
- ALl: There you are.
- Aunt Nazneen.

276
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,548
This young man thinks
our little home is stupendous.

277
00:18:51,373 --> 00:18:55,927
What, this old shack?
Let me see you. Let me see you.

278
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,637
Hey, Omer!

279
00:18:57,587 --> 00:19:00,129
Could this be little Shabnum?

280
00:19:00,382 --> 00:19:02,673
Call me Shazzy. Everyone does.

281
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:05,395
I'm so excited you're here.
It's been, what, 10 years, right?

282
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:08,054
- Yes.
- We're gonna party like rock stars!

283
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:09,514
Okay.

284
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:11,641
Oh, Omer. Omer.

285
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:15,937
I am so, so sorry about your mother.

286
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:19,451
You know I loved her very, very much.

287
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:23,329
I told her to leave Baghdad.
It's too dangerous.

288
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,489
But she was headstrong.

289
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:29,252
No, no, Nazneen.
This is a happy day. Remember.

290
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:31,410
Oh, yes, of course, sweetie. Yes, honey.

291
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:33,548
Hey, lqbal, this is your cousin, Omer!

292
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,885
- Hello.
- Hi. Long time no see.

293
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,972
Come on. Come on, everybody.
Come on, sweetheart.

294
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:42,964
- Come on, let's be happy.
- Yes.

295
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:47,593
The President hasn't made
a public appearance for the last three weeks.

296
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,304
What about the rumours
that he has a mystery ailment?

297
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:52,140
There is no mystery ailment.

298
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:56,237
As we all know, the campaign process
takes a lot out of a person.

299
00:19:56,021 --> 00:20:00,450
And the President has been enjoying
the intervening time to rest and reflect.

300
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,620
Is it true that he left President Putin on hold
for 30 minutes

301
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:05,914
when the Russian president called
to congratulate him?

302
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:07,374
Absolutely not.

303
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:10,168
The President and Mr Putin had a nice talk.

304
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:12,962
The President considers him a close friend,

305
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:17,217
while of course, deeply mistrusting
his undemocratic tendencies.

306
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:22,430
Sir, what about the rumours that
the President had a nervous breakdown?

307
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:24,140
Nervous breakdown?

308
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,677
Look, fellows, I would like to remind
everyone that we're still at war here.

309
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:32,899
The terrorists are looking to exploit
any sign of weakness.

310
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:34,859
And it's not a question of if,

311
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:39,771
but when they're going to launch a major
attack ending life on Earth as we know it.

312
00:20:40,065 --> 00:20:43,451
So let's just try and keep a positive attitude.

313
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,539
Okay, that's it.

314
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,254
Poopie.

315
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:09,102
Poopie!

316
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,021
Oh, hey, Poopie.

317
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:14,024
- When did you get up?
- Four hours ago.

318
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:17,819
It's time for you to get dressed.

319
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,811
I picked you out a nice suit.

320
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:22,824
We both think you need to get up
and get out of this bedroom.

321
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:25,483
- Who's we?
- Hi, Mr P.

322
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:29,706
- Oh, hi, Wally, I didn't hear you come in.
- I guess you were distracted.

323
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:33,658
Wally, be careful
with that pile. That is the Canadian press.

324
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,253
Canadian press?

325
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:39,330
What on earth are you doing
reading the Canadian press?

326
00:21:39,124 --> 00:21:42,093
Who outside of Canada gives a shit
about the Canadian press?

327
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:44,304
- Wally, language.
- They're our neighbours.

328
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:45,889
Our neighbours?

329
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:49,225
Sir, you are worrying me, here.

330
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:52,135
I don't know how long I can cover for this.

331
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:55,815
Well, there is nothing to cover for.

332
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:03,938
I'm just...
I'm just trying to figure out a few things.

333
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:07,900
If you wanted more info, sir,
why did you cancel the weekly briefings?

334
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:12,488
Because I'm not sure I'm getting
the straight poop from them, that's all.

335
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:15,158
I mean, Iran and North Korea

336
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:18,505
are not just like Dr Octopus and Magneto.

337
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:21,257
You don't like cartoons? Fine, they're gone.

338
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,666
Joe, we're trying to help, here.

339
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:28,014
- Linda?
- Well, we were wondering

340
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,102
maybe you ought to take some of these.

341
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,355
What, your hormone pills?

342
00:22:35,138 --> 00:22:38,149
They're not hormone pills,
they're happy pills.

343
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:40,558
They make you happy when you're sad.

344
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:43,988
Well, hold on here.

345
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:49,119
- Are you sad?
- No. I'm happy.

346
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:52,789
But I think you're a little sad, maybe.

347
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:56,501
I think maybe you ran so hard,

348
00:22:56,618 --> 00:23:00,588
you fought so well
for this wonderful victory,

349
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:05,135
so that you could help your country, and...

350
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:08,471
You fought so well

351
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,391
for a wonderful victory.

352
00:23:13,552 --> 00:23:15,927
Fought so well
for the wonderful victory that you...

353
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:19,774
Now you have the wind,
the wind knocked out of you.

354
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:22,819
You're wondering,
what was the point of it all.

355
00:23:22,644 --> 00:23:25,071
Why you? Why now?

356
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:28,616
Why did the Lord pick you out of all people?

357
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:33,246
What are your special qualifications?
And did the Lord even pick you?

358
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:36,781
Or was it just having
really, really powerful friends?

359
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:40,628
Are you saying the Lord didn't pick me?

360
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:43,089
The Lord did pick you. He picked you.

361
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:45,717
Of course he picked you, honey.

362
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:49,877
The thing is, we just can't have a President

363
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,682
who stays in his pyjamas all day.

364
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:54,684
Come on, sir.

365
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,687
The country needs you.

366
00:23:58,597 --> 00:24:00,690
I like the country.

367
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:04,819
Well, that's good.
Because you're its President.

368
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:27,884
- Hello, William.
- Hi, Mrs Kendoo.

369
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:31,502
I just came by to say good-bye to Sally.

370
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:34,683
Well, have you up and joined the Army?

371
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:38,103
I have, Mrs Kendoo.

372
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:42,013
I just feel like since Sally dumped me,
my life has been meaningless.

373
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:45,558
So, I'm trying to find meaning
by defending my country.

374
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:49,197
And I just wanted to tell Sally that.

375
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:52,992
Well, William, that's very sincere of you,

376
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,152
but Sally isn't here.

377
00:24:55,946 --> 00:24:59,416
She's in New York meeting with agents.

378
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,961
- Agents?
- They're folks that...

379
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:08,758
They act greedy and mean for you,
so you can seem like a nice person.

380
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,250
But Sally is a nice person.

381
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:16,474
So I'm not gonna get to see her, then, am I?

382
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,841
I'm afraid not, William.

383
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:26,599
Well, you just tell her

384
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:28,768
that wherever I am, I'll be thinking of her.

385
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:31,406
And I got her face tattooed on my arm.

386
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,450
It's from our prom photo.

387
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:37,537
Well, it's beautiful work.

388
00:25:41,116 --> 00:25:42,615
Well.

389
00:25:46,663 --> 00:25:49,341
Now I feel like a terrible person.

390
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:53,918
Oh, you can't help it if that boy wants
to go do something foolish like get a tattoo.

391
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:02,510
I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored, I'm bored,

392
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:05,398
I'm bored, bored,
bored of these contestants.

393
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:08,151
I want some variety, okay?

394
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:12,437
I want someone to love, I want someone
to pity, I want someone to laugh at.

395
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,950
I want someone to masturbate over.
Well, possibly we have that already.

396
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:19,704
I want... I want an Arab.

397
00:26:20,614 --> 00:26:22,332
I'm part Arab.

398
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:23,792
No, don't be ridiculous.

399
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:26,836
No. Mother's Syrian. Dad's Korean.

400
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:28,546
Good God. All right, then.

401
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,800
Bring me a fellow Arab. And a Jew.

402
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,843
Bring me an Arab and a Jew.

403
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:36,169
What about an Arab Jew?

404
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,597
Don't be funny.

405
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:39,974
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

406
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:42,852
Martin, I've got the White House
on the phone for you.

407
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:46,356
- No, love. I don't think you have.
- I think I do.

408
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:52,518
Hello? Martin Tweed.

409
00:26:52,437 --> 00:26:54,155
No commercials.

410
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:56,783
Don't be ridiculous.
We can't do no commercials.

411
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:59,619
The PR benefit to you
will more than make up for it.

412
00:26:59,403 --> 00:27:03,373
With all due respect,
we are the number one show on TV.

413
00:27:03,156 --> 00:27:06,908
We are watched by college freshmen,
grandmas in retirement homes,

414
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:08,910
death-row inmates, nuns.

415
00:27:08,704 --> 00:27:12,038
We hit every demo.
That is the reason you've come to us.

416
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:14,207
You need the PR more than we do.

417
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,928
We're talking about
the President of the United States, here.

418
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:19,587
Yeah, a President who hasn't been seen
in public for weeks.

419
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:21,506
There are rumours he's gone bonkers.

420
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:25,895
He hasn't gone bonkers. Doing great.
Feeling good, has a good sense of humour,

421
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,356
tremendous popular appeal.
Man of the people.

422
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,015
That's why we want to get him out there
in a big way.

423
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:33,351
I heard you're also booking him
on Larry King and Oprah.

424
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:35,186
- That's correct.
- No, that is incorrect.

425
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,574
If he does our show, he cannot do
any other show before our show

426
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:39,868
and he cannot do another show
for at least a week afterwards.

427
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:41,327
But those are talk shows.

428
00:27:41,111 --> 00:27:43,903
The President's old friends with Larry
and he loves Oprah.

429
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:46,155
Don't we all? Still, those are my terms.

430
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,741
No other TV appearances.
Two commercial breaks.

431
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:50,420
- No commercial breaks.
- Two.

432
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,088
- One.
- One.

433
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,414
One commercial break.

434
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:58,595
- Okay.
- Okay. Great! Great!

435
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:04,100
Looks like the President's gonna be
a guest judge on American Dreamz.

436
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,511
- Hi.
- Hello.

437
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:11,681
Oh, well, now he looks
as strange as you two do.

438
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:14,183
Nonsense. He looks adorable.

439
00:28:13,977 --> 00:28:17,447
He barely let us spend anything on him.
All this stuff was on sale.

440
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,689
Thank you so much.
This is more than I need.

441
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:22,786
You see?
You two need to learn a lot from this fellow.

442
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,789
Darling, we must get him
his own credit card.

443
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,989
Why not?

444
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,960
Hey, Omeriser. Want to see something cool?

445
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:32,785
Watch out.
Super-gay-meister might jump you!

446
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:35,548
Shut up, hairy she-male! Let's go.

447
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:39,667
She's a super freak
Super freak

448
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:41,753
She's super freaky

449
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,115
Wow.

450
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:03,326
Bravo!

451
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:06,121
Okay. Thank you.

452
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:07,831
- Thanks.
- Oh, the shaking.

453
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:10,834
Okay, now you're just making fun of me.
Stop.

454
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,378
No! No!

455
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:16,913
No, you are extremely talented, cousin.

456
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:21,928
Not only as a singer but as a dancer.
You have pizzazz, my friend.

457
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:23,836
Really?

458
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,391
- You really think so?
- Yes.

459
00:29:26,758 --> 00:29:28,174
Wow.

460
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:30,510
How strange to not be met with mockery.

461
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:32,022
Who mocks you?

462
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:34,816
Everyone! That's why
no one's allowed down here.

463
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:37,736
Oh, this is a spectacular set-up you have.

464
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,404
You think so?

465
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:43,283
Gosh! I really wish
you would have been here last month!

466
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:45,660
I taped an audition for American Dreamz.

467
00:29:45,444 --> 00:29:49,195
Had to have Shazzy run the camera.
She couldn't stop shaking with laughter.

468
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:52,250
- So, how do you work the lighting in here?
- Oh, I'll show you.

469
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:18,985
- Hey, how long you been in Iraq?
- Fourteen months.

470
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:22,989
Wow. Fourteen months.
You must have seen a lot of stuff.

471
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,731
This is my first day here.

472
00:30:25,525 --> 00:30:28,067
In fact, I just joined the Army
two weeks ago.

473
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:31,081
I had kind of an accelerated basic training.

474
00:30:31,114 --> 00:30:35,366
I was pretty surprised when they said,
"Pack your bags, you're going to Iraq."

475
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:38,213
Honestly, I thought they were joking.

476
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:41,914
Hey, you got any advice for me?

477
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:45,095
Don't get shot.

478
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:47,472
Don't get shot!

479
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:49,589
Okay. Will do.

480
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:53,103
What was that?

481
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,398
I think you just got shot.

482
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:58,817
My tattoo!

483
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:02,612
First off, I think you're really talented

484
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:04,771
and you have a chance
to win this whole thing.

485
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:07,409
A chance? She's going to win it all, mister.

486
00:31:07,192 --> 00:31:09,452
Mom, shut up. Go on, Chet Krogl.

487
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:13,289
Thank you. I know she's gonna win, Martha.
That's why I'm representing her.

488
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:16,824
But winning American Dreamz
isn't just about talent.

489
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:19,327
You have to have a story.

490
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:23,133
Now, the whole
poor white trash thing is great.

491
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:25,176
Well, we're not white trash.

492
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,461
No. No, no, no. Of course not, of course not.

493
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:30,296
But it doesn't hurt to imply that you are.

494
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,799
Look what it's done for Britney Spears.

495
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:35,979
See, everyone in America
thinks they're middle class.

496
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:38,304
So they like to have someone
to look down on.

497
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:39,649
We are middle class.

498
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:43,184
Mom, shut your gaping pie hole.
Go on, Chet Krogl.

499
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,145
Human interest is what wins these things.

500
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:48,616
Now, absent father's not bad.

501
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:50,201
You two are divorced, right?

502
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:53,288
Well, Daddy lives with another man
in Chicago.

503
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:54,998
Another man.

504
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:59,169
Maybe? Well, no.

505
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:02,464
Let's not feature that.
That's too much of a wild card.

506
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:06,332
Now, one thing that is important, Sally,
is that you not appear to want it too much.

507
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,668
I'm just singing for the love of singing.

508
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:10,638
As long as I get to get on that stage

509
00:32:10,422 --> 00:32:15,101
and perform in front of
that incredible audience, I'm happy.

510
00:32:15,385 --> 00:32:17,593
Not bad. Not bad.

511
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:21,764
Now, of course, on the inside,
you do need to want it really badly.

512
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:25,028
Mr Krogl, I'd rather jab my eyes out
with toothpicks and eat them

513
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:27,572
- than lose this thing.
- Okay. Awesome!

514
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:33,036
There's sort of this Hollywood thing,
the camera puts on 10 pounds.

515
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,122
- So, you're gonna want to lose 20.
- Screw you.

516
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:39,292
I control my weight swings. No one else.

517
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:44,203
Having a little extra meat, taking it off,
packing it on can make people root for you.

518
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:46,873
It hasn't hurt Oprah.

519
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,720
I love Oprah.

520
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:53,390
We're busy!

521
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:57,936
- Could you get that?
- Yes.

522
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:07,445
Oh, my Lord! Sally, you better get over here.

523
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:15,203
It's William. He's back.
And I think he's been wounded.

524
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:18,957
Oh, my God.

525
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:22,575
- I know.
- Poor William.

526
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:27,465
I don't think
he's going away.

527
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,343
Who's William?

528
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:32,418
It's Sally's old boyfriend.

529
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:34,754
She broke up with him a few weeks ago.

530
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:36,506
Yeah, it just wasn't gonna work.

531
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:39,769
Every time he smiled, I wanted to hit him
in the head with my shoe.

532
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,106
So he's a returning war veteran
injured in Iraq?

533
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:44,607
That's right.

534
00:33:45,976 --> 00:33:47,444
Yep.

535
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:50,103
Sally, remember what I said

536
00:33:49,896 --> 00:33:53,481
about human interest being the thing
that wins American Dreamz?

537
00:33:57,654 --> 00:33:59,456
Hi, William.

538
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:02,417
Hi, Sally. I'm back.

539
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:04,169
Brought you some flowers.

540
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:06,921
Oh, gosh. Thank you, William.

541
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:10,456
I got injured in Iraq.

542
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:13,928
Yeah, I can see. I'm so, so sorry.

543
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:20,393
Well, I just came to say hi, so...

544
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,301
Yeah. But, William,

545
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:26,149
I'm actually really happy that you're home

546
00:34:25,932 --> 00:34:28,276
and you're back

547
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,696
and you're alive.

548
00:34:33,106 --> 00:34:35,867
- Sorry, sorry.
- No big deal. No big deal.

549
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,828
Listen, I'm so happy to see you, too. I...

550
00:34:46,203 --> 00:34:50,632
- Sally, who's the guy with the video camera?
- Nobody. He's just my agent.

551
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:51,998
Oh, cool.

552
00:34:52,376 --> 00:34:54,834
Keep going. Don't mind me.

553
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:58,515
This is Linda Garvey reporting live
from the White House.

554
00:34:58,298 --> 00:35:01,685
It is his first official state visit
since his re-election

555
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:03,926
and the President is hosting
the Premier of China.

556
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,190
Unfortunately, news cameras
weren't allowed inside for the meeting.

557
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:10,141
I am terrified of North Korea.

558
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,697
I keep having this nightmare.

559
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:16,032
That the sirens are going off

560
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:20,745
and then someone rushes in and tells me
that the North Koreans are attacking.

561
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:24,447
So I run to get my Bible, but I can't find it.

562
00:35:24,825 --> 00:35:27,961
And then the sky goes dark.

563
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,674
Do you ever have nightmares?

564
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,209
Vamp. Improvise.

565
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:45,562
Bye-bye. Sure you don't want to sleep over?

566
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,346
All right. Next time. Bye, now.

567
00:35:51,852 --> 00:35:53,267
Well.

568
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:57,396
I think that went really well.

569
00:35:58,108 --> 00:36:00,900
He seems like a real nice guy.

570
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:03,079
Yes, he's very nice.

571
00:36:02,946 --> 00:36:06,499
Very nice, for a communist dictator.

572
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:09,419
What the hell is going on here, Joe?

573
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:12,297
I mean, have you had
a frigging nervous breakdown?

574
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:15,592
Uh, no.

575
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:19,888
"Uh, no" is not a very reassuring answer.

576
00:36:19,963 --> 00:36:23,683
Joe, you remember when we first met?

577
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:27,093
When I came up to you at that fundraiser
for your dad and I said,

578
00:36:26,887 --> 00:36:28,772
"You're gonna make
one hell of a President,"

579
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:32,984
and you said, "You mean my dad is,"
and I said, "No, pal. You are."

580
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:35,904
I kind of remember it. I was pretty toasted.

581
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:39,324
Is that what's happening here?
Are you getting toasted again?

582
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:42,608
- Do you have a bottle hiding somewhere?
- No! Of course not.

583
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:44,444
'Cause I'm there for you.

584
00:36:47,157 --> 00:36:49,000
It's just that

585
00:36:49,368 --> 00:36:54,297
there are some things that kind of seemed
pretty black-and-white.

586
00:36:54,831 --> 00:36:56,633
And now they,

587
00:36:56,416 --> 00:37:00,303
kind of, becoming a little grey-seeming.

588
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:03,515
I'll tell you one thing
that isn't grey-seeming.

589
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:05,016
Your numbers.

590
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,134
The only demo where you have
an approval rating above 30%%

591
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:11,147
is with children under the age of five.
You know what they're saying out there?

592
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:12,649
Yeah, I've been reading the papers.

593
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:16,017
They're saying you've disappeared.
They're saying you've gone cuckoo!

594
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:17,570
Look, Mr President.

595
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:19,698
We have a lot of important work to do.

596
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:23,566
We're making democracies
and you have to keep your eye on the prize!

597
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:29,165
First off, no more newspapers.

598
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,543
In fact, no more reading.
Back to the regular briefing.

599
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:34,118
Second off, we're gonna up the dosage
on your medicine.

600
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:36,256
Third off, we're going on a publicity blitz

601
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:39,791
to show the world that you're still
going strong, still have the common touch.

602
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:44,055
And to start off with, you're gonna be
a guest judge on American Dreamz.

603
00:37:45,924 --> 00:37:49,894
- Are you sure that's dignified?
- Oh, it will be dignified.

604
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:54,816
And charming.
And populist and on-message.

605
00:37:55,058 --> 00:38:00,186
Because you'll be wearing this.

606
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:03,533
What is that?

607
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:08,204
Hey, Omer. Want to go to the mall?

608
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,863
We just went last weekend.

609
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:13,116
Yeah. Now we're going again.

610
00:38:12,993 --> 00:38:15,754
Why? Did you forget
to purchase something?

611
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:22,719
If you do not mind,
I think I will pass on the mall today,

612
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:25,680
I would like to just stay here and relax.

613
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:28,558
- Okay. Bye!
- Bye.

614
00:38:46,943 --> 00:38:50,038
(MYSTICAL INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC
PLAYING)

615
00:38:51,823 --> 00:38:54,584
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

616
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:59,130
You're too kind. You're too kind, really.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

617
00:38:58,914 --> 00:39:02,415
And now a piece from the classic,
Guys and Dolls.

618
00:39:04,836 --> 00:39:07,180
This is really a new low.

619
00:39:07,422 --> 00:39:10,600
- This lqbal guy can't sing.
- Neither can the Hasidic guy.

620
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,936
What? The Hasidic guy rules.

621
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,053
Wait! I hear singing.
Start the camera. Start the camera.

622
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:19,526
Luck be a lady tonight

623
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:23,113
Luck be a lady tonight, pah!

624
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:26,616
Luck if you've ever been a lady to begin with

625
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,327
Luck be a... tonight

626
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:33,665
May I help you?

627
00:39:33,448 --> 00:39:38,242
You do not understand.
I have no desire to be on a television show.

628
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:41,715
But you have real talent.
Do you really think so?

629
00:39:41,998 --> 00:39:46,000
But it is a moot point,
because it is not I you are looking for.

630
00:39:46,128 --> 00:39:48,169
It is my cousin, lqbal.

631
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:50,671
I want him. No, I don't want him.

632
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:52,882
I need him. I love him.

633
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:55,812
That is it. That's my Arab.
Lqbal's out. Omer's in.

634
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:57,553
Okay. We're working on it.

635
00:39:57,347 --> 00:40:01,317
Now here's a tape
that Sally Kendoo's agent sent over.

636
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,559
She's the white-trash girl from Ohio.

637
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:07,021
Apparently, she has a boyfriend
who was injured in the Iraq war,

638
00:40:06,815 --> 00:40:09,690
and this is footage of their reunion.

639
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:15,696
Now look at this right here.

640
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,448
Did you get that?

641
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:18,793
Whoa.

642
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:21,744
Give me that. Give me that. Give me that.

643
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:26,009
Did you get that?

644
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,098
Dirty bitch.

645
00:40:47,564 --> 00:40:50,189
Oh, my God. It's Martin Tweed!

646
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:52,024
Martin Tweed, everyone!

647
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,124
Oh, my God!

648
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:00,032
Get back. Get back, everyone!

649
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:16,726
Mr Tweed.

650
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:19,886
- Come on in.
- Thank you very much.

651
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,888
- Mrs Kendoo?
- Oh, yes.

652
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,442
And a lot of other Kendoos.

653
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:29,364
Can I get you some hot bundt cake
or how about a beer?

654
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:31,908
No, thank you very much.
I'm on a strict sashimi diet.

655
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:35,026
Martin, Chet Krogl.
We met at upfronts a couple of years ago.

656
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,454
Right. Yeah, Chet Krogl.

657
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:39,165
- I don't want to talk to you.
- Okay. No problem.

658
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:43,086
Do you know what? Do you think I might
go upstairs and talk to Sally in private?

659
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:45,755
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

660
00:42:09,896 --> 00:42:13,033
- Cool car.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

661
00:42:13,316 --> 00:42:16,651
Not easy renting a Ferrari in Padookie, Ohio.

662
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:22,751
I'm surprised that you're here,
'cause I thought

663
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:25,952
we were supposed to meet
for the first time onstage at the show.

664
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,965
Yeah. Normally we would.
I never produce these segments.

665
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:31,968
But I heard Padookie was an exciting town,
thought I'd check it out.

666
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:36,514
- That was a joke.
- I'm aware.

667
00:42:37,007 --> 00:42:38,965
You didn't laugh.

668
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:40,852
It wasn't funny.

669
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:43,563
No.

670
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:48,151
But why didn't you laugh
just to kiss my ass?

671
00:42:48,143 --> 00:42:50,518
I figure you didn't need me to kiss your ass.

672
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:54,991
I mean, I'm sure you have people
kissing your ass 24 hours a day.

673
00:42:55,942 --> 00:43:00,789
And I guess, like, not kissing your ass
is like kissing your ass for most people.

674
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,667
Absolutely right.

675
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:09,120
It's weird. One can become quite detached
from reality when one's famous.

676
00:43:08,914 --> 00:43:10,413
Really.

677
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,510
That sounds so cool.

678
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:15,887
Yeah, it can be.

679
00:43:19,758 --> 00:43:24,104
So, Sally, I've seen your tapes
and I think you're very talented.

680
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:27,774
- Really? You do?
- Well, moderately.

681
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:30,349
But beyond that...

682
00:43:30,352 --> 00:43:32,070
Beyond that?

683
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,604
I think I like you.

684
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,524
I don't mean romantically, I mean

685
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:42,987
I think I like you as a human being.

686
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,672
So, have you ever been
in a Ferrari before?

687
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:52,747
Yeah, yeah, tons of times.

688
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,304
You know, sometimes I'll be driving
my Enzo down Mulholland Drive,

689
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:01,725
really gunning it. I'll look at the little railing
at the side of the road

690
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:04,185
and the steep drop just beyond that
and I'll think,

691
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:07,939
"Wouldn't it be great just to shoot
off the edge of the cliff?"

692
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:11,401
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Mr Tweed, I...

693
00:44:11,184 --> 00:44:14,446
No, no, no, no, no. Don't call me Mr Tweed.
Call me Tweedy.

694
00:44:14,229 --> 00:44:18,147
- Like Tweety Bird, but with a 'd'?
- Exactly, yeah.

695
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:23,204
You know, my mum used to say to me,
"Martin, you have no talent.

696
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:25,206
"No one will ever love you."

697
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,825
Well, look at me now, Mum!
Look where no talent will get you!

698
00:44:28,827 --> 00:44:31,452
You jealous, drunk old bitch.

699
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:33,465
Really, that's great.

700
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:36,916
But, Tweedy, can you help me win?

701
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:40,055
Because I would do absolutely anything
to win this show.

702
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:43,423
I'd love to help you, Sally,
but there's only so much I can do.

703
00:44:43,216 --> 00:44:46,092
It's down to you.
You've got to make the people love you.

704
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:49,522
- The way that they love you?
- Nope. Nobody loves me.

705
00:44:50,057 --> 00:44:53,891
My mum was right about that.
But it's fine, I don't care.

706
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:57,728
I don't want the fake bullshit
that passes for love in this world.

707
00:44:57,522 --> 00:45:01,743
Well, you don't have to worry about me,
I'm not even sure that I like you.

708
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:03,370
Wow.

709
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:05,945
My God,
I can't believe I just said that out loud.

710
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,780
I never say stuff like that out loud.

711
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:10,168
I think you are a rapacious little bitch.

712
00:45:09,951 --> 00:45:13,046
Well, I think you're a self-involved,
preening idiot.

713
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:16,049
Sociopathic, egomaniacal,
Madonna wannabe.

714
00:45:15,832 --> 00:45:20,303
No-talent, famous-for-being-famous,
third-rate, Regis Philbin clone!

715
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:25,308
So, at the mall today,
I upgraded my plan to 5,000 minutes,

716
00:45:25,092 --> 00:45:26,507
but it's a family plan.

717
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:29,771
- Thank you, Auntie.
- You should've gotten 10,000.

718
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:31,648
- Lqbal?
- Yeah.

719
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:36,069
Something very odd happened today.
It's funny, really.

720
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:40,073
You see, these people from the
American Dreamz television show came by.

721
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,651
- Yeah?
- And...

722
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:50,375
- And?
- And I was using your stage

723
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:53,086
and they heard me singing
and they want me to be on the show.

724
00:45:55,706 --> 00:46:00,500
I'm sorry. Did you say they want you
to sing on the show?

725
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:01,678
Mmm-hmm.

726
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:03,096
Isn't that amusing?

727
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:05,004
- Holy crap.
- Shazzy.

728
00:46:05,215 --> 00:46:07,924
- Congratulations, Omer!
- Thank you.

729
00:46:07,718 --> 00:46:10,259
"Congratulations, Omer!"
That's what you have to say!

730
00:46:10,053 --> 00:46:12,147
"Congratulations, Omer!"

731
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:15,358
Do you know how hard I have worked
to get on this show?

732
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:17,266
You've stolen my dream!

733
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,895
I'm so sorry. I told them.
I told them they had made a mistake.

734
00:46:21,022 --> 00:46:22,438
But do not worry.

735
00:46:22,232 --> 00:46:26,703
I will simply refuse
to be on the television show. Yes?

736
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:29,247
Yes, and then they must take you instead.

737
00:46:29,072 --> 00:46:31,166
They don't want me.

738
00:46:31,575 --> 00:46:34,586
Nobody wants me!

739
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:37,839
Nonsense, sweetheart. We all love you.

740
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:42,302
Is that going to make me famous?
I don't think so.

741
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:54,720
Next week, the exciting
premiere episode of American Dreamz.

742
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:58,099
Which of these hopefuls will live
the next American dream?

743
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:06,649
Wait. Rewind the TiVo.

744
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:13,667
Pause it.

745
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:19,589
- Hello.
- Hello, Mrs Riza.

746
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:22,967
- Is Omer at home, please?
- Yes, he is.

747
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,221
Who shall I say is asking for him?

748
00:47:26,004 --> 00:47:28,713
Just some friends.

749
00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:32,717
Come in, please.

750
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:42,946
- Sun block, anyone?
- Yes. Thank you, Auntie.

751
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:44,114
Sure.

752
00:47:44,356 --> 00:47:47,826
Now, I am going to bring you boys
a little treat.

753
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:49,619
Thank you.

754
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,702
Very cushy situation you have here.

755
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:04,718
- No pool?
- No. No, just the Jacuzzi.

756
00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:13,591
The Western Command has learned of you
being chosen to sing and dance

757
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:17,981
on a hedonistic television show
aptly named American Dreamz.

758
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,360
Wow. You guys heard about that?

759
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:26,656
It's all a big mistake, you see.

760
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,659
They got me mixed up with my cousin.

761
00:48:29,818 --> 00:48:33,986
Because I would never engage
in such a frivolous activity.

762
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:38,032
In fact, I'm going to tell them
I will not be on the show.

763
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:40,326
You are to do no such thing.

764
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,662
You are to perform on the show.

765
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:45,300
And you must get
to the championship round,

766
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,594
because judging the championship round

767
00:48:47,377 --> 00:48:51,931
will be none other than the
President of the United States of America.

768
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,351
The President?

769
00:48:54,342 --> 00:48:59,522
When you are onstage with the President,
you will have smuggled in an explosive belt.

770
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:02,192
And you are to martyr yourself.

771
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:05,476
Killing, in the process,
the head of the serpent.

772
00:49:06,188 --> 00:49:09,032
What if I don't make it to the final round?

773
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:12,202
Omer, folks don't call me "The Torturer"

774
00:49:11,985 --> 00:49:14,412
because I don't like to torture people.

775
00:49:14,196 --> 00:49:16,289
You know what I mean?

776
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:22,118
Now, who would like to try
some grapefruit sorbet?

777
00:49:25,665 --> 00:49:29,886
In a busy political week capped by
a marked increase in his approval ratings,

778
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:33,890
the President has stepped back into the
public eye in a string of high-profile events.

779
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:36,768
Earlier this week,
he hosted the Ukrainian President,

780
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:40,105
lifted weights with the head
of the Organisation of African States,

781
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:42,263
spent some time with his dog, Henry,

782
00:49:42,057 --> 00:49:45,725
and chatted with Carmen Electra
at a black-tie event.

783
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,237
- Thank you.
- You come back now, all right?

784
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,905
- Okay. Nice meeting you.
- Okay.

785
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,275
After weeks of seclusion,
suddenly the President is everywhere.

786
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:55,745
Even signing on to guest judge

787
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:59,332
the finale of the top-rated television show,
American Dreamz.

788
00:49:59,116 --> 00:50:01,741
You hear that? We're back.

789
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:04,629
All right. Now hold still.

790
00:50:07,082 --> 00:50:08,581
It tickles.

791
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:11,428
You want to wear this thing all night?
Then sit still.

792
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:19,133
This thing is incredible. Great reception.

793
00:50:20,429 --> 00:50:23,732
I can't believe I didn't think of it earlier.

794
00:50:23,807 --> 00:50:27,944
Hell of a week, sir!
You really got back on message.

795
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:30,697
That's because you're telling me
what the message is.

796
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,979
Exactly.

797
00:50:32,858 --> 00:50:36,161
I just love that Carmen Electra. Thanks.

798
00:50:36,445 --> 00:50:39,039
I would have never had the courage to go up

799
00:50:38,822 --> 00:50:41,833
and talk to her by myself, face to face.

800
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:44,127
Engaging girl.

801
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:47,370
Good night, Mr President.

802
00:50:58,258 --> 00:51:01,394
One and two. Three and four.

803
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:02,729
Five...

804
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:04,731
Hey.

805
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:06,733
What are you doing?

806
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:10,017
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm just rehearsing some dance steps.

807
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,196
Oh.

808
00:51:11,104 --> 00:51:12,906
Look, lqbal.

809
00:51:13,607 --> 00:51:15,867
- I am so sorry...
- Stop.

810
00:51:17,194 --> 00:51:20,997
I don't want your pity.
Does it look like I need pity?

811
00:51:21,615 --> 00:51:24,542
No, no, no. You have far too much dignity.

812
00:51:24,326 --> 00:51:28,578
If these people know nothing about talent,
there's not much I can do about it, is there?

813
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:34,594
So let's see it. Let's see your dance steps.

814
00:51:36,004 --> 00:51:37,639
All right.

815
00:51:40,842 --> 00:51:44,104
One and two. Three and four.

816
00:51:44,137 --> 00:51:45,553
What?

817
00:51:45,347 --> 00:51:47,972
Oh, there's no way
you're gonna win this thing.

818
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,641
I know. I fear as much.

819
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,953
Get up there. Up on the stage.

820
00:51:59,945 --> 00:52:01,746
Are you sure?

821
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:04,124
Do it. Before I change my mind.

822
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:09,921
Okay. Now this is just the bass track.
It's good to practice moves to.

823
00:52:09,913 --> 00:52:14,300
- I don't like this kind of music.
- It's just a bass track. It's just for rehearsal!

824
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:17,178
Okay.

825
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:23,518
Now, one problem you have is you move
like a re-animated corpse in a zombie movie.

826
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:24,853
Not good.

827
00:52:24,803 --> 00:52:26,688
You need to loosen up.

828
00:52:27,431 --> 00:52:29,806
Okay. Come on, let's go.

829
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,860
Free-form jazz dancing,
right now, immediately.

830
00:52:31,643 --> 00:52:34,154
Lqbal, why are you helping me?

831
00:52:34,438 --> 00:52:36,646
I destroyed your dream.

832
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:38,908
Yeah.

833
00:52:39,192 --> 00:52:40,775
You did.

834
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:43,121
But that was yesterday.

835
00:52:43,238 --> 00:52:46,989
Today, I've turned a page
on a new chapter in my life.

836
00:52:46,783 --> 00:52:51,004
I'm not sure being a performer
was ever what I was really meant for.

837
00:52:50,787 --> 00:52:54,591
I'm more of a behind-the-scenes player.
A puppeteer.

838
00:52:54,499 --> 00:52:56,509
A Svengali, if you will.

839
00:52:57,794 --> 00:52:59,637
As of today,

840
00:53:00,172 --> 00:53:02,182
I'm your manager.

841
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:08,010
This is Martin Tweed, and I am
in the small town of Padookie, Ohio.

842
00:53:08,305 --> 00:53:11,149
Our first dream starts right here,

843
00:53:10,932 --> 00:53:15,278
where local chanteuse Sally Kendoo
hopes her dream comes true.

844
00:53:16,855 --> 00:53:19,032
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

845
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:23,995
It was always Sally's idea to perform,
not mine.

846
00:53:24,279 --> 00:53:27,916
I mean, she's been wanting to do this
since she was six months old.

847
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,876
Sing!

848
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:35,048
She did it before. She's just shy.
Come on, honey. Sing!

849
00:53:35,207 --> 00:53:37,498
The last remaining business
on Main Street

850
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,386
is Harry's Hangdown Bar and Grill

851
00:53:39,336 --> 00:53:42,211
where Sally works as a part-time waitress.

852
00:53:42,005 --> 00:53:44,213
The Hangdown is a home away from home

853
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:47,060
for the largely unemployed male population
of Padookie.

854
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:53,983
Come on! Yeah!

855
00:53:54,184 --> 00:53:57,570
Sally's high-school sweetheart
is a decorated war veteran,

856
00:53:57,354 --> 00:53:59,364
a real American hero.

857
00:54:00,857 --> 00:54:05,161
And halfway across America,
hailing from halfway around the world,

858
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:08,665
Omer Obeidi lives with his cousins,
the Riza Family.

859
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:11,418
A refugee from the mayhem
of the Middle East.

860
00:54:11,201 --> 00:54:15,286
I cannot believe my good fortune
to be competing on the show.

861
00:54:15,956 --> 00:54:19,092
This is truly an American dream come true.

862
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,428
Now.

863
00:54:21,503 --> 00:54:23,002
Now.

864
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:26,099
America, you will be Omerised.

865
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:31,761
Like any American kid,
Omer likes to hang out at the mall

866
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:33,565
where his posse all know him.

867
00:54:33,348 --> 00:54:35,442
Omer, American Dreamz, baby!

868
00:54:35,225 --> 00:54:37,600
Yo, Big O!
I like your style.

869
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:40,321
O-mizzer! That's my dawg right there!

870
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:42,282
Keep it real, man! Remember that.
Keep it real.

871
00:54:42,065 --> 00:54:46,578
There may not be peace in the Middle East,
but there is Middle East in this piece,

872
00:54:46,361 --> 00:54:51,239
as we visit cantor Sholem Glickstein,
recent Israeli immigrant.

873
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:52,917
I wish Omer luck.

874
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:56,327
I wish all of the contestants luck,
because I'm coming for them.

875
00:54:56,121 --> 00:54:57,537
Do you hear that?

876
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:01,051
Do you hear that? I am coming
for you, bitches! I am coming for you!

877
00:55:01,877 --> 00:55:03,459
Looks great.

878
00:55:03,295 --> 00:55:06,431
Big day tomorrow, boss. You fired up?

879
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:10,216
Yes. I am fired up.

880
00:55:14,014 --> 00:55:15,940
- Debra?
- Yes.

881
00:55:16,516 --> 00:55:18,558
Do you think I'm lovable?

882
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:20,904
Lovable?

883
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:24,574
Yeah. Yes, sure, very.

884
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:27,452
Frank?

885
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:32,029
I love you. That's all I know.

886
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:37,869
Okay, thanks. You can go.

887
00:56:00,852 --> 00:56:04,520
Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome back, America!

888
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:06,689
- Boo!
- Boo!

889
00:56:07,192 --> 00:56:09,869
I'm Martin Tweed
and I am so delighted to be back

890
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:11,996
with another exciting season
of American Dreamz.

891
00:56:13,657 --> 00:56:17,658
We have some amazing dreamers
who are gonna perform for you tonight.

892
00:56:17,577 --> 00:56:20,547
Some will triumph.
Some will sink back into obscurity.

893
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:23,425
Only one will become
America's newest sensation.

894
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:24,707
It's up to you, America.

895
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:27,637
Only you have the awesome power
to lift someone up into the heavens

896
00:56:27,421 --> 00:56:29,055
and create a new star.

897
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,297
And here are your dreamers!

898
00:56:41,643 --> 00:56:44,821
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, watch your step! Watch your step!

899
00:56:44,604 --> 00:56:47,782
Go, go, go, go! Come on, get on up there!

900
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:50,493
Let's go! Go! Move it out! Move it!

901
00:57:14,009 --> 00:57:17,760
I'd like to dedicate this song
to a real American hero.

902
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:20,648
My boyfriend, William Williams.

903
00:57:23,935 --> 00:57:28,782
He risked his life for our freedom,
and that's a real American dream.

904
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:36,998
Mommy, don't drink

905
00:57:36,782 --> 00:57:40,585
Me to bed tonight

906
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:44,464
What's gotten into

907
00:57:44,247 --> 00:57:47,175
Your head tonight?

908
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,178
Did I make you mad?

909
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:53,640
Is that why you're sad?

910
00:57:54,466 --> 00:57:57,310
And, Daddy, where have

911
00:57:57,302 --> 00:58:00,689
You been all my life?

912
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:04,025
Mommy said that

913
00:58:03,975 --> 00:58:07,112
You got a new wife

914
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:10,605
And there's nothing to do

915
00:58:10,565 --> 00:58:13,702
But I know that's not true

916
00:58:13,693 --> 00:58:17,497
And there's no one to hold me

917
00:58:17,697 --> 00:58:20,667
Close when I cry

918
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:24,170
To rock me so gentle

919
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,382
Till the storm passes by

920
00:58:28,083 --> 00:58:30,875
And I'm just a kid

921
00:58:30,877 --> 00:58:34,514
But I know it ain't right

922
00:58:35,841 --> 00:58:39,019
So, Mommy, don't drink

923
00:58:38,802 --> 00:58:43,189
Me to bed tonight

924
00:58:58,029 --> 00:58:59,664
Sally.

925
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:04,117
I think you're terrific.

926
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:08,298
In fact, I think you have star quality.

927
00:59:08,707 --> 00:59:10,800
Thank you, Mr Tweed.

928
00:59:13,336 --> 00:59:15,347
Sally Kendoo.

929
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:21,895
Girl, let's not be friends

930
00:59:21,678 --> 00:59:23,938
'Cause we've shared too much

931
00:59:23,722 --> 00:59:28,933
Girl, you know that
I'm yearning for your touch

932
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:33,490
'Cause I can't be less than your everything

933
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,232
'Cause I'll lay down and cry

934
00:59:36,026 --> 00:59:38,651
I'll curl up and die

935
00:59:38,445 --> 00:59:43,406
Don't let this be how my story ends

936
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,825
It's love or good-bye

937
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:48,546
So let's not be friends

938
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:51,299
I'm a rocking man

939
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:54,417
I'm a genuine rocking man

940
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:58,723
I'm a rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Rocking man!

941
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:04,051
I'm a rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock

942
01:00:03,845 --> 01:00:06,189
I never felt

943
01:00:06,306 --> 01:00:09,359
This way

944
01:00:09,851 --> 01:00:14,781
Before

945
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:20,537
Girl, you know I want you
I got a rocket launcher

946
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,456
So, baby, let's get raunchy tonight

947
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,531
Let's get raunchy tonight

948
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:29,462
I don't want to taunt you
Or take you out and flaunt you

949
01:00:29,246 --> 01:00:32,215
So, baby, let's get raunchy, all right

950
01:00:31,998 --> 01:00:35,051
Let's get raunchy, baby

951
01:00:43,802 --> 01:00:45,478
Sholem.

952
01:00:45,846 --> 01:00:48,304
I only have two words for you.

953
01:00:48,098 --> 01:00:49,649
Mazel tov!

954
01:00:50,058 --> 01:00:52,934
No, you were wonderful. Really, wonderful.

955
01:00:54,104 --> 01:00:57,490
Good news, Pauly.
I don't want to be your friend.

956
01:00:57,274 --> 01:01:00,660
In fact, you make me
want to projectile vomit.

957
01:01:01,069 --> 01:01:06,249
Bobby, I think my ears are actually bleeding.
You are like a musical Ebola virus.

958
01:01:06,283 --> 01:01:07,917
Cindy.

959
01:01:08,952 --> 01:01:11,661
I'm afraid I have felt this way before.

960
01:01:11,455 --> 01:01:15,456
And it was just before I tried to kill myself.
Sorry, love.

961
01:01:17,294 --> 01:01:18,793
Sorry.

962
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:22,891
I hate you!

963
01:01:23,425 --> 01:01:25,226
Nice girl. Cindy.

964
01:01:35,687 --> 01:01:37,322
Here he is.

965
01:01:39,316 --> 01:01:41,441
Fantastic, Omer.

966
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:50,408
- Don't clap.
- No, no, of course.

967
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:56,591
To dream

968
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:59,636
The impossible dream

969
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:04,808
To fight

970
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:08,895
The unbeatable foe

971
01:02:09,971 --> 01:02:12,513
To bear

972
01:02:12,557 --> 01:02:16,528
With unbearable sorrow

973
01:02:17,896 --> 01:02:21,950
To run where the brave dare not go

974
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:25,401
What the hell is that?
He looks like he stepped on a scorpion.

975
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:28,070
This is my quest

976
01:02:27,864 --> 01:02:31,199
To follow that star

977
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:34,087
No matter how hopeless

978
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,048
No matter how far

979
01:02:36,832 --> 01:02:39,540
To fight for the right

980
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:42,971
Without question or pause

981
01:02:42,754 --> 01:02:46,307
To be willing to march into hell

982
01:02:46,091 --> 01:02:49,894
For a heavenly cause

983
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:52,303
Go, Omer. Go.

984
01:02:52,097 --> 01:02:56,860
To reach the unreachable star

985
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:01,114
You have been Omerised! Pah!

986
01:03:14,786 --> 01:03:16,254
Omer,

987
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:18,996
that was strange.

988
01:03:19,124 --> 01:03:20,842
Strange,

989
01:03:21,918 --> 01:03:23,762
but rather wonderful.

990
01:03:24,296 --> 01:03:26,639
I think I have been Omerised.

991
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:28,767
I think I might be Omer-sexual.

992
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,418
Oh, my God!

993
01:03:57,996 --> 01:03:59,464
Yes!

994
01:03:59,706 --> 01:04:02,331
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

995
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,677
Yes!

996
01:04:27,651 --> 01:04:32,278
They came on boats
From across the sea

997
01:04:33,824 --> 01:04:36,532
From faraway places

998
01:04:36,326 --> 01:04:39,587
And far distant lands

999
01:04:40,539 --> 01:04:42,830
And still they come

1000
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:46,678
To a place where they're free

1001
01:04:47,254 --> 01:04:49,629
They fly in on planes

1002
01:04:49,506 --> 01:04:53,007
With hope in their hands

1003
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,187
Sometimes it feels

1004
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:59,399
Like we're stuffed to the seams

1005
01:04:59,558 --> 01:05:04,185
But it's everyone's God-given right

1006
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:08,992
To follow their dreams

1007
01:05:08,775 --> 01:05:11,234
My American dream

1008
01:05:11,903 --> 01:05:15,081
Will come true for me

1009
01:05:15,198 --> 01:05:17,208
My American dream

1010
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:21,171
For all to see

1011
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:25,665
Every woman and man

1012
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:29,669
Has their own destiny

1013
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:34,601
To dream American Dreamz

1014
01:05:34,593 --> 01:05:37,103
Dreamz with a Z

1015
01:05:36,887 --> 01:05:41,733
To dream American Dreamz

1016
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:44,611
Dreamz with a Z

1017
01:05:45,562 --> 01:05:48,406
We began the show with 50 dreamers.

1018
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,232
Now we're down to just three.

1019
01:05:54,112 --> 01:05:55,789
- Boo.
- Boo!

1020
01:05:56,448 --> 01:05:58,291
How are you doing?

1021
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:00,585
You all right?

1022
01:06:01,703 --> 01:06:04,245
And the two finalists

1023
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:15,725
will be revealed after this commercial break
brought to you by American Motors,

1024
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:19,562
introducing "The Tank," 50%% larger
than the next biggest SUV on the road,

1025
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:21,106
because you need it.

1026
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:24,849
And we're out! Come on,
people. Hair and makeup, let's go, let's go.

1027
01:06:25,685 --> 01:06:28,394
All right.
Give me some room over here, Travis.

1028
01:06:28,188 --> 01:06:32,242
Calm, calm, calm, calm.
Thank you, thank you very much.

1029
01:06:32,275 --> 01:06:35,245
Here you go.
And you're supposed to be drinking this.

1030
01:06:35,028 --> 01:06:37,455
- Must I?
- Contractually, yes.

1031
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:39,833
- Your envelope.
- Thank you.

1032
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:43,117
All right, let's wrap it up.
Let's get it started.

1033
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:44,462
Let's get the chairs out, let's go.

1034
01:06:44,246 --> 01:06:46,454
Get the lead out. Big smiles, everyone.

1035
01:06:46,248 --> 01:06:49,884
Big smiles. And we're back. Three, two.

1036
01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:54,139
Excuse me. Delicious.
That's wildly refreshing.

1037
01:06:54,673 --> 01:06:58,758
And now, America, you have voted.

1038
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:12,105
- Sholem Glickstein?
- Yeah.

1039
01:07:23,785 --> 01:07:25,420
You are

1040
01:07:27,622 --> 01:07:29,883
not a winner.

1041
01:07:34,755 --> 01:07:37,849
This week's winners who will move on
to the championship round

1042
01:07:37,632 --> 01:07:40,769
are Sally Kendoo and Omer Obeidi.
And don't forget,

1043
01:07:40,552 --> 01:07:43,886
on next week's finale, special guest judge,
the President.

1044
01:07:52,147 --> 01:07:53,615
Honey?

1045
01:07:54,566 --> 01:07:56,993
I have a confession to make.

1046
01:07:59,196 --> 01:08:01,873
I haven't been taking my happy pills.

1047
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:06,544
Actually, I haven't been taking mine, either.

1048
01:08:06,578 --> 01:08:10,131
- But you don't seem sad.
- Well, I guess I'm not.

1049
01:08:10,582 --> 01:08:14,584
At first, those happy pills
really helped me a lot.

1050
01:08:14,586 --> 01:08:19,516
But, eventually, I think they were just
kind of like placebos.

1051
01:08:19,841 --> 01:08:23,176
Placebos? Aren't they illegal?

1052
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:29,192
No, Poopie. It means fake.

1053
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,738
Well, yeah.

1054
01:08:33,688 --> 01:08:35,156
Well.

1055
01:08:38,193 --> 01:08:39,776
You know,

1056
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:44,530
I guess I kind of feel like I'm a placebo.

1057
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:50,703
I mean, I've had speech writers

1058
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:53,258
writing for me all my career,

1059
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:56,428
and advisors telling me
what positions to take.

1060
01:08:58,338 --> 01:09:02,475
I can't even remember why I wanted
to get into politics to begin with.

1061
01:09:03,802 --> 01:09:06,938
I think it's 'cause my mom wanted me to.

1062
01:09:07,681 --> 01:09:10,525
Show my dad any idiot could do it.

1063
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:15,572
Maybe I ought to just chuck the whole thing.
What do you think?

1064
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,158
Starting with that American Dreamz deal.

1065
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:20,399
Don't you say that.

1066
01:09:21,486 --> 01:09:25,957
Do you remember what I said
the first time I met you?

1067
01:09:26,491 --> 01:09:27,959
Yeah.

1068
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:31,296
"Hey, jerk-off, you spilled your beer on me."

1069
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:34,132
After that.

1070
01:09:34,583 --> 01:09:37,125
When you went and got that towel

1071
01:09:36,918 --> 01:09:41,139
and borrowed that T-shirt
from one of your frat brothers for me.

1072
01:09:41,673 --> 01:09:44,768
I said, "Now that there is a good guy."

1073
01:09:44,885 --> 01:09:47,312
And I still think so today.

1074
01:09:48,263 --> 01:09:52,890
So you just go on and be on that show.

1075
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:58,604
And then, afterwards, we will tell Wally
no more earplugs, okay?

1076
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:03,495
Well, how am I gonna know what to say?

1077
01:10:04,696 --> 01:10:07,572
Well, we will think of it together.

1078
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:11,920
Mmm-hmm.

1079
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:20,168
Look at this! "Omer Mania!"

1080
01:10:20,212 --> 01:10:23,348
"America's newest mascot, adorable,

1081
01:10:23,548 --> 01:10:27,018
"Omer Obeidi
has 'Omerised' the whole country."

1082
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,521
It should have been me.

1083
01:10:30,222 --> 01:10:33,233
I mean, great, Omer! They love you!

1084
01:10:34,184 --> 01:10:35,767
Room service.

1085
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:40,855
Hey, what are you gonna say
when you meet the President?

1086
01:10:41,817 --> 01:10:43,201
Sorry?

1087
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:45,954
"Sorry?" Omer, you crack me up.

1088
01:10:45,737 --> 01:10:48,873
Okay, we got two orders
spicy tuna hand rolls,

1089
01:10:48,657 --> 01:10:51,918
a plate of fresh fruit
and some chimichangas.

1090
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:01,928
Oh, you guys go ahead and start eating. I...

1091
01:11:01,712 --> 01:11:05,713
I have to go talk to the waiter in private
for a moment.

1092
01:11:07,718 --> 01:11:09,185
So.

1093
01:11:10,053 --> 01:11:13,231
You have become quite the famous man.

1094
01:11:13,765 --> 01:11:17,600
- You know why they vote for you?
- Because they like me?

1095
01:11:19,688 --> 01:11:22,699
Because you are a figure of fun to them.

1096
01:11:23,108 --> 01:11:26,745
They see you prancing and singing
and they can forget the terrors

1097
01:11:26,528 --> 01:11:30,665
they've inflicted on our lands
with their soldiers and weapons.

1098
01:11:30,449 --> 01:11:32,792
It could be. Yes, I guess.

1099
01:11:32,743 --> 01:11:34,919
But I have to hand it to you.

1100
01:11:34,786 --> 01:11:39,466
You have put us in a wonderful position
to strike them a crippling blow.

1101
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:44,669
About that crippling blow.

1102
01:11:45,005 --> 01:11:47,046
I really don't know
how I'm supposed to do it.

1103
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,632
You see, really,
there is a lot of security there.

1104
01:11:49,426 --> 01:11:52,812
All you have to do is get me and the rest
of your brothers on the guest list

1105
01:11:52,596 --> 01:11:54,773
for the studio audience.

1106
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:58,766
We will smuggle in the explosive device
in pieces, assemble it there,

1107
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,601
and then you must only retrieve it

1108
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:04,282
in the toilet-seat-cover dispenser
in the men's bathroom.

1109
01:12:04,191 --> 01:12:07,410
Then, when you meet the President

1110
01:12:07,444 --> 01:12:10,663
and shake his hand, live on television,

1111
01:12:10,447 --> 01:12:12,874
you will ignite the device.

1112
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,960
And I will see you in paradise.

1113
01:12:16,953 --> 01:12:19,214
You will be killed, too?

1114
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:22,540
Not yet. It's a pretty small bomb.

1115
01:12:22,834 --> 01:12:25,804
But I'll see you up there
in a few years, I'm sure.

1116
01:12:28,673 --> 01:12:33,301
So, I'm just curious.
How is this Martin Tweed in person?

1117
01:12:37,099 --> 01:12:39,776
Sally, Sally, Sally. I am so proud of you.

1118
01:12:39,559 --> 01:12:43,029
I always knew you had a great voice
and now the whole world knows it, too.

1119
01:12:42,813 --> 01:12:47,492
William, no, no. I have not won yet.
Everybody seems to be forgetting that.

1120
01:12:47,275 --> 01:12:51,027
You know, folks,
they love that Middle Eastern guy.

1121
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:52,831
They love you more.

1122
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:56,918
They love us more. You know how many hits
we got on our website last night?

1123
01:12:56,702 --> 01:12:58,659
Sixteen million.

1124
01:12:59,204 --> 01:13:01,662
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1125
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:07,376
God, William. You make me feel bad.
Why do you care so much about me?

1126
01:13:07,254 --> 01:13:08,888
Why?

1127
01:13:09,673 --> 01:13:14,019
Because, honey, you are my dream girl.

1128
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:15,645
Yuck.

1129
01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:17,939
I can't stand looking
at those damn French fries anymore.

1130
01:13:17,723 --> 01:13:19,680
Just cover them up or something.

1131
01:13:20,058 --> 01:13:22,350
Sally Kendoo, I love you.

1132
01:13:22,144 --> 01:13:24,769
Okay? I love you.

1133
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:27,657
I love how you binge eat
and then starve yourself.

1134
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:29,951
I love how pretty you sing,
whether it's in the shower

1135
01:13:29,735 --> 01:13:32,162
or in front of millions of TV viewers.

1136
01:13:31,945 --> 01:13:36,739
I look at you and I see that same girl
that I fell in love with in high school.

1137
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,295
And I'd like to know, right here and now,

1138
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:45,414
if you'd help to make my dream come true
and marry me?

1139
01:13:46,376 --> 01:13:48,053
Oh, my God.

1140
01:13:49,421 --> 01:13:51,181
Oh, my Lord.

1141
01:13:50,964 --> 01:13:53,558
Hold it right there! Nobody move.

1142
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,716
- Chet, what are you doing?
- I'm calling the camera crew.

1143
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,854
No, you're not. Put the phone down, Chet.

1144
01:13:57,637 --> 01:14:01,722
- Chet, put the phone down right now!
- Chet, put the phone down!

1145
01:14:01,516 --> 01:14:04,444
What, are you kidding me?
This is great stuff.

1146
01:14:06,521 --> 01:14:08,782
- And, William, stand up, please.
- But...

1147
01:14:08,565 --> 01:14:10,200
Stand up.

1148
01:14:10,275 --> 01:14:14,277
Now, please understand.
I am so touched by your proposal

1149
01:14:14,071 --> 01:14:17,332
and the sweet things
that you just said to me, but...

1150
01:14:17,449 --> 01:14:20,293
Right now is a really bad time.

1151
01:14:20,077 --> 01:14:21,961
Do it on the show!

1152
01:14:21,745 --> 01:14:24,036
- On the show?
- Absolutely.

1153
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:25,840
That's a great idea.

1154
01:14:25,624 --> 01:14:27,008
- Really?
- Yes.

1155
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:29,167
And do that thing about how
every time you look at her

1156
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,419
you see the same girl
you fell in love with in high school.

1157
01:14:31,213 --> 01:14:34,547
- What, you were listening?
- I'm in the other room, man, so, yes.

1158
01:14:34,341 --> 01:14:37,925
And you. Hey, you!
Are you still into winning this thing?

1159
01:14:37,719 --> 01:14:41,053
Because this is what we in the biz call
"incredible television."

1160
01:14:40,847 --> 01:14:43,024
People are going to be
in their living rooms, sobbing.

1161
01:14:42,808 --> 01:14:44,567
Then they're gonna be
crawling over each other

1162
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,570
trying to get to the phone
so they can call up and vote for you!

1163
01:14:49,606 --> 01:14:54,317
Well, I'm up for it if you are, Sally.

1164
01:14:54,111 --> 01:14:55,745
Yes! This guy!

1165
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:57,487
We are gonna get into this
with the producers.

1166
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,322
Can I see that ring for a second?

1167
01:14:59,116 --> 01:15:00,875
Wow, that's great.

1168
01:15:00,742 --> 01:15:02,950
We're gonna get a bigger one
so that it plays on TV,

1169
01:15:02,744 --> 01:15:04,462
but there is nothing wrong with that ring.

1170
01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:05,964
Now, here's what I'm thinking, okay?

1171
01:15:05,747 --> 01:15:07,705
It's gonna be a special
built around the wedding.

1172
01:15:07,499 --> 01:15:09,300
- Do you sing at all, William?
- I can sing a little bit.

1173
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:10,635
I thought you could sing a little bit.

1174
01:15:10,419 --> 01:15:13,346
I think we're gonna call it
"Sally and William, sealed with a kiss."

1175
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:14,848
- What do you think about that?
- I love that.

1176
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:17,392
Yeah, I think everyone's gonna love that.

1177
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,845
Hey, Omer?

1178
01:15:54,296 --> 01:15:56,389
Can I buy you a beer?

1179
01:15:56,381 --> 01:16:00,133
Oh, no, no, no, no. I do not drink.
But thank you.

1180
01:16:05,724 --> 01:16:10,028
Hey, do you ever wonder why you're doing
this whole competition thing for?

1181
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,438
Only every day.

1182
01:16:18,028 --> 01:16:20,570
But then I think of my mother.

1183
01:16:21,156 --> 01:16:23,781
She loved all types of singing.

1184
01:16:24,743 --> 01:16:27,003
It keeps me going on.

1185
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:36,002
When I was 10 years old,

1186
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,973
I weighed 200 pounds.

1187
01:16:40,759 --> 01:16:43,603
- That is large.
- Yeah.

1188
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:51,528
And I told myself I would lose 90 pounds
by the time I turned 14 or I would kill myself.

1189
01:16:53,855 --> 01:16:55,740
So I lost the weight.

1190
01:16:55,816 --> 01:16:57,450
And...

1191
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:01,204
I suddenly was really popular.

1192
01:17:00,987 --> 01:17:05,615
I had a whole new group of friends.
I had this cute boyfriend.

1193
01:17:05,742 --> 01:17:08,451
Even my teachers liked me better.

1194
01:17:09,162 --> 01:17:11,370
And my mom and I
walked around the entire house

1195
01:17:11,164 --> 01:17:15,385
collecting all the pictures of me
when I was fat and burned them.

1196
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,973
I love my mom.

1197
01:17:26,763 --> 01:17:28,398
So.

1198
01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:31,568
Good luck tomorrow.

1199
01:17:32,602 --> 01:17:34,237
Thank you.

1200
01:17:35,772 --> 01:17:38,481
Sorry I'm gonna have to destroy you.

1201
01:18:01,757 --> 01:18:04,048
Here is your chewing gum.

1202
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:06,728
Remember, no blowing bubbles.

1203
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:14,569
Is this really necessary?

1204
01:18:14,352 --> 01:18:18,521
Just a little bit higher. Oh, that's good.

1205
01:18:19,483 --> 01:18:23,234
Yeah, that's beautiful.
Give me a little bit more in here.

1206
01:18:23,028 --> 01:18:25,486
Take my moustache down a little bit, too.

1207
01:18:29,076 --> 01:18:31,951
My cousin's gonna be in the finale.

1208
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:46,601
- William?
- Yeah, yeah.

1209
01:18:46,385 --> 01:18:48,645
Okay. Omer's gonna go on first.

1210
01:18:48,428 --> 01:18:51,564
Then after Sally is done,
we're gonna hit you with a spotlight.

1211
01:18:51,348 --> 01:18:54,109
Then you're gonna go onstage
and do your proposal.

1212
01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:55,308
- Got it?
- Got it.

1213
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:57,894
- All right.
- It's happening.

1214
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,772
She's very excited.

1215
01:19:00,649 --> 01:19:02,992
It's a joyful moment. Joyful.

1216
01:19:05,195 --> 01:19:07,872
- Hi, Tweedy.
- Hi, Sally.

1217
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:15,411
Just wanted to say good luck tonight.

1218
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:17,132
Thank you.

1219
01:19:16,998 --> 01:19:19,426
Could you just give us
a quick second, please?

1220
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:21,334
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

1221
01:19:26,508 --> 01:19:27,924
So.

1222
01:19:28,802 --> 01:19:31,229
I think you're going to win.

1223
01:19:32,013 --> 01:19:34,524
Novelty contestants
never win the whole thing.

1224
01:19:34,307 --> 01:19:37,809
- That's why I've been helping him along.
- Thank you.

1225
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:43,450
Hey, is something wrong?

1226
01:19:44,192 --> 01:19:45,660
No.

1227
01:19:46,737 --> 01:19:49,706
I mean, nothing beyond
the usual creeping dread.

1228
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:57,870
All right. Well.
I'm sure you know at this point

1229
01:19:57,664 --> 01:20:00,925
that William is supposed to propose to me
on tonight's show.

1230
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:02,125
Yeah.

1231
01:20:02,794 --> 01:20:06,431
Do you think it's bad of me to accept
a proposal from a man I don't love

1232
01:20:06,214 --> 01:20:09,309
in order to manipulate
people into voting for me?

1233
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:13,563
"Bad." Such a nebulous word, isn't it?

1234
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:17,233
You know what I think?
I think everyone wants something.

1235
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:18,975
William wants you.

1236
01:20:19,269 --> 01:20:23,438
Why? Because he has this idea in his head
of what you are.

1237
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:28,787
I don't think he cares if it's true or not,
just so long as he keeps his fantasy alive.

1238
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:31,081
So I think he deserves what he gets.

1239
01:20:30,864 --> 01:20:34,198
- He deserves to be miserable?
- Why not?

1240
01:20:34,743 --> 01:20:36,784
You are, aren't you?

1241
01:20:37,329 --> 01:20:40,423
Despite your newfound fame and adulation?

1242
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:42,592
Tweedy,

1243
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:46,930
I sometimes feel like you're the only person
in the whole world who really gets me.

1244
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:50,350
Yeah.

1245
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:54,886
Sometimes I look at you
and I see my own reflection.

1246
01:20:55,263 --> 01:20:57,107
It's revolting.

1247
01:20:58,183 --> 01:21:02,404
And attractive.

1248
01:21:08,276 --> 01:21:09,911
Martin,

1249
01:21:11,363 --> 01:21:15,917
I'm not physically attracted to other people,
but if you want me,

1250
01:21:17,494 --> 01:21:19,170
I'm yours.

1251
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:24,957
The problem is I find that whenever
I become intimately involved

1252
01:21:25,794 --> 01:21:27,971
with a woman I admire,

1253
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:32,267
it rapidly degenerates into mutual loathing.

1254
01:21:33,385 --> 01:21:35,843
I don't want that to happen to us.

1255
01:21:42,644 --> 01:21:44,654
Having said that...

1256
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:17,552
Omer, are you okay?

1257
01:22:17,387 --> 01:22:20,690
Great. Great. Just a little nervous, I guess.

1258
01:22:21,516 --> 01:22:24,308
- I just feel confused.
- About what?

1259
01:22:24,144 --> 01:22:26,029
About this country.

1260
01:22:25,812 --> 01:22:27,739
You know, there are
so many nice people here,

1261
01:22:27,522 --> 01:22:30,492
but it does so much harm in the world.

1262
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:31,951
So?

1263
01:22:31,735 --> 01:22:35,987
So, to what degree is this country
culpable for its actions?

1264
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:40,168
Are Americans to blame for America?
And beyond that,

1265
01:22:40,744 --> 01:22:45,674
can causing someone else to suffer
ever truly ease one's own suffering?

1266
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:50,428
Omer! You're wigging out.
That bitch deserves to suffer!

1267
01:22:50,879 --> 01:22:52,378
What bitch?

1268
01:22:52,172 --> 01:22:53,723
Sally! Who are you talking about?

1269
01:22:54,674 --> 01:22:56,309
15 minutes, Omer.

1270
01:22:57,886 --> 01:23:01,064
Well, see, I think the dress works
'cause it flows nice.

1271
01:23:00,847 --> 01:23:03,274
The dress is gonna be a hit.

1272
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:07,237
Hey, I'm gonna go run lines with Sally.

1273
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:08,571
- Well, don't be long.
- Okay.

1274
01:23:08,355 --> 01:23:09,823
Yeah.

1275
01:23:41,805 --> 01:23:44,816
Mr President,
it's such an honour to have you here.

1276
01:23:44,599 --> 01:23:46,557
Happy to be here.

1277
01:24:22,637 --> 01:24:26,889
"Press here to explode yourself."

1278
01:24:29,269 --> 01:24:32,937
Where's Martin? Where the hell is Martin?
Has anybody seen Martin?

1279
01:24:32,731 --> 01:24:36,315
- He's in there.
- What the hell is he doing in there?

1280
01:24:36,693 --> 01:24:39,662
- What are you doing?
- This isn't pretty.

1281
01:24:39,446 --> 01:24:40,830
What?

1282
01:24:47,537 --> 01:24:50,872
- That's Sally and Mr Tweed?
- Yep.

1283
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,925
- Are you seeing anybody?
- What?

1284
01:25:08,725 --> 01:25:11,517
It looks so much bigger on TV.

1285
01:25:11,686 --> 01:25:13,644
Hey, watch my foot, huh?

1286
01:25:16,066 --> 01:25:19,869
- So, do you feel filthy?
- Not really.

1287
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:22,497
How do you feel?

1288
01:25:27,536 --> 01:25:29,212
It's weird.

1289
01:25:30,664 --> 01:25:33,883
- I don't actually loathe you.
- You, either.

1290
01:25:47,097 --> 01:25:49,607
Right. The President here yet?

1291
01:25:49,433 --> 01:25:51,891
Yeah!
How you doing, everybody?

1292
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:58,241
How many Omer fans
do I have with me tonight?

1293
01:25:58,734 --> 01:26:00,201
Yeah!

1294
01:26:01,361 --> 01:26:05,665
And how many Sally fans do I have?
She can hear you in the back!

1295
01:26:08,785 --> 01:26:13,412
And now your host,
Martin Tweed!

1296
01:26:22,382 --> 01:26:24,424
That's Martin Tweed.

1297
01:26:25,052 --> 01:26:27,844
You're looking very good, sir. Very good.

1298
01:26:29,848 --> 01:26:32,557
Welcome, America.

1299
01:26:32,851 --> 01:26:36,269
Welcome, world. Welcome, everyone else.

1300
01:26:37,022 --> 01:26:38,823
- Boo!
- Boo!

1301
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,038
We've been through so much together.

1302
01:26:44,821 --> 01:26:49,042
We've laughed. We've cried.
We've formed attachments.

1303
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:52,827
And now, we're down to just two.

1304
01:26:52,662 --> 01:26:56,466
And to help me help you judge tonight,

1305
01:26:56,249 --> 01:26:58,875
we're welcoming a very special guest.

1306
01:26:58,794 --> 01:27:01,888
The President of this great country,

1307
01:27:02,339 --> 01:27:05,809
President Joseph Staton!

1308
01:27:09,554 --> 01:27:12,315
Thanks for having me on your show.

1309
01:27:21,525 --> 01:27:23,159
So.

1310
01:27:22,943 --> 01:27:26,694
What do you think of these
two great contestants, Mr President?

1311
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:31,626
I think they exhibit
what's best about America.

1312
01:27:33,328 --> 01:27:36,548
- The spirit of resolve...
- The spirit of resolve

1313
01:27:36,331 --> 01:27:40,082
that makes this
the greatest country in the world.

1314
01:27:42,045 --> 01:27:43,513
They know what they want...

1315
01:27:43,296 --> 01:27:46,057
They know what they want
and they go out and get it.

1316
01:27:45,841 --> 01:27:47,392
All right.

1317
01:27:48,552 --> 01:27:52,105
- I'll be right back!
- Omer! Where are you going?

1318
01:28:00,981 --> 01:28:03,742
Where's that interference coming from?

1319
01:28:03,734 --> 01:28:06,077
Turn that frigging thing off!

1320
01:28:05,861 --> 01:28:08,486
And turn that frigging thing off!

1321
01:28:10,031 --> 01:28:11,614
Oh!

1322
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,917
Okay. Okay.

1323
01:28:23,754 --> 01:28:26,379
America, Mr President,

1324
01:28:26,423 --> 01:28:31,717
without further ado, let me introduce
America's favourite Middle Eastern import,

1325
01:28:32,095 --> 01:28:34,804
Omer Obeidi!

1326
01:28:58,789 --> 01:29:00,913
Where the hell is he?

1327
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:03,009
- I don't know where he is...
- I'm going on!

1328
01:29:13,136 --> 01:29:15,261
Go, Omer!

1329
01:29:18,475 --> 01:29:21,444
My wife loves this guy.

1330
01:29:23,563 --> 01:29:28,274
And now the end is near

1331
01:29:29,736 --> 01:29:33,456
That's a bad call. That's Frank's song.
People aren't gonna respond to that.

1332
01:29:33,698 --> 01:29:35,792
Bold choice of song.

1333
01:29:36,243 --> 01:29:37,919
My friends

1334
01:29:38,537 --> 01:29:40,995
I'll say it clear

1335
01:29:41,748 --> 01:29:44,624
I'll state my case

1336
01:29:44,793 --> 01:29:47,721
Of which I'm certain

1337
01:29:48,797 --> 01:29:53,643
I've lived a life that's full

1338
01:29:54,302 --> 01:29:56,677
I've travelled each

1339
01:29:57,305 --> 01:30:00,890
And every highway

1340
01:30:01,435 --> 01:30:05,269
But more, much more than this

1341
01:30:06,314 --> 01:30:08,241
I did it

1342
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:13,038
My way

1343
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:19,117
I've loved, I've laughed and cried

1344
01:30:19,494 --> 01:30:21,838
I've had my fill

1345
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:24,049
Mr President, what are you doing?

1346
01:30:23,832 --> 01:30:25,508
My share of losing

1347
01:30:25,292 --> 01:30:28,261
I'm getting a lot of feedback in this thing.

1348
01:30:28,045 --> 01:30:31,963
And now, as tears subside

1349
01:30:32,299 --> 01:30:34,757
I find it all

1350
01:30:35,594 --> 01:30:38,021
So amusing

1351
01:30:39,181 --> 01:30:41,107
To think

1352
01:30:41,683 --> 01:30:44,361
I did all that

1353
01:30:44,644 --> 01:30:47,437
And may I say

1354
01:30:48,148 --> 01:30:51,566
Not in a shy way

1355
01:30:51,818 --> 01:30:53,703
Oh, no

1356
01:30:54,196 --> 01:30:56,571
Oh, no, not me

1357
01:30:56,865 --> 01:30:58,823
I did it

1358
01:30:59,284 --> 01:31:03,004
My way

1359
01:31:02,954 --> 01:31:06,789
For what is a man?

1360
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:09,250
What has he got?

1361
01:31:09,961 --> 01:31:13,181
If not himself

1362
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:14,974
then he has naught

1363
01:31:14,758 --> 01:31:17,018
William Williams, you're a moron.

1364
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:21,846
A moron. You stupid moron! Stupid moron!

1365
01:31:22,516 --> 01:31:26,017
And not the words

1366
01:31:25,811 --> 01:31:29,364
Of one who kneels

1367
01:31:29,147 --> 01:31:32,117
The record shows

1368
01:31:32,025 --> 01:31:34,869
I took the blows

1369
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:37,414
And did it

1370
01:31:37,197 --> 01:31:42,460
My way

1371
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:49,467
I love you, Mom.

1372
01:31:54,172 --> 01:31:56,130
He nailed it!

1373
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,258
That's my cousin!

1374
01:32:10,605 --> 01:32:12,563
We're gonna stand up.

1375
01:32:24,703 --> 01:32:27,130
Omer, meet the President.

1376
01:32:27,622 --> 01:32:29,424
Nice to meet you, sir.

1377
01:32:29,207 --> 01:32:31,301
He's talking to him.

1378
01:32:32,753 --> 01:32:36,139
What'd you think of Omer tonight,
Mr President?

1379
01:32:36,089 --> 01:32:38,047
What did I think?

1380
01:32:40,135 --> 01:32:41,717
Mr President?

1381
01:32:41,511 --> 01:32:42,927
What did I think?

1382
01:32:42,721 --> 01:32:45,315
Mr President? Can you read me?

1383
01:32:46,099 --> 01:32:47,901
I think

1384
01:32:51,063 --> 01:32:52,781
I liked you.

1385
01:32:53,106 --> 01:32:54,783
Thank you, sir.

1386
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:58,286
Go ahead.

1387
01:32:59,571 --> 01:33:00,955
Do it!

1388
01:33:00,739 --> 01:33:03,166
And I just want to say,

1389
01:33:03,241 --> 01:33:05,700
in terms of the Middle East,

1390
01:33:07,579 --> 01:33:11,883
that it looks like the problems over there
are never going to be solved.

1391
01:33:12,501 --> 01:33:14,000
What?

1392
01:33:14,002 --> 01:33:15,637
I mean never.

1393
01:33:15,921 --> 01:33:18,848
Never, never, never, never, never.

1394
01:33:19,758 --> 01:33:21,393
And so,

1395
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:25,897
I'm sorry about that.

1396
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,556
What the hell was that? I never said that!

1397
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:30,308
Oh, Poopie.

1398
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,825
Mr President?

1399
01:33:37,526 --> 01:33:39,650
I deeply hope,

1400
01:33:40,237 --> 01:33:42,361
for all of our sakes,

1401
01:33:43,031 --> 01:33:44,791
that you are wrong.

1402
01:33:45,242 --> 01:33:47,127
I hope so, too.

1403
01:33:49,538 --> 01:33:51,339
Nice singing.

1404
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:54,791
Well...

1405
01:33:54,876 --> 01:33:56,594
On a brighter note,

1406
01:33:56,378 --> 01:34:00,129
we'll be back after a short break
with the enchanting Sally Kendoo.

1407
01:33:59,923 --> 01:34:04,967
And then you all will decide
who is the winner of American Dreamz.

1408
01:34:09,766 --> 01:34:12,777
That's it! Show is over!

1409
01:34:12,561 --> 01:34:15,019
What are you talking about?
There's another contestant.

1410
01:34:14,813 --> 01:34:16,364
Sorry, I'm taking my guy out!

1411
01:34:16,148 --> 01:34:19,284
Your guy, your guy just went
way off reservation!

1412
01:34:19,067 --> 01:34:22,078
Talk about depressing.
Half the audience want to shoot themselves!

1413
01:34:21,862 --> 01:34:23,872
And you, sir, are no Oprah!

1414
01:34:23,655 --> 01:34:26,708
I'd kind of like to see how Sally does.

1415
01:34:26,783 --> 01:34:30,045
All right, you. Where is the you-know-what?

1416
01:34:31,204 --> 01:34:34,257
And we're back
in three, two.

1417
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:35,884
Get off the stage! Get off the stage!

1418
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:37,385
We're back!

1419
01:34:37,169 --> 01:34:41,139
And now all the way from Padookie, Ohio,

1420
01:34:40,964 --> 01:34:45,185
America's newest sweetheart, Sally Kendoo!

1421
01:35:15,248 --> 01:35:18,750
Where the hell is William?
He's supposed to be up here.

1422
01:35:21,797 --> 01:35:26,507
I would like to dedicate this song
to someone very special in the audience,

1423
01:35:26,593 --> 01:35:28,436
my boyfriend.

1424
01:35:28,804 --> 01:35:30,647
William Williams!

1425
01:35:46,196 --> 01:35:47,872
What? No!

1426
01:35:47,948 --> 01:35:50,875
No, he's supposed to propose
after she sings!

1427
01:35:50,659 --> 01:35:52,950
- He's an idiot!
- Yeah.

1428
01:35:54,079 --> 01:35:57,215
Excuse me a moment.
This moron's missed his cue.

1429
01:35:59,626 --> 01:36:02,637
Let's all welcome Sally's sweetheart.

1430
01:36:02,587 --> 01:36:05,724
Decorated war veteran, William Williams!

1431
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:13,679
I think, perhaps, William has something
he wants to ask Sally.

1432
01:36:14,641 --> 01:36:16,140
Sally?

1433
01:36:17,644 --> 01:36:19,446
Yes, William?

1434
01:36:19,813 --> 01:36:22,240
How could you do this to me?

1435
01:36:25,694 --> 01:36:28,455
How could I do what to you?

1436
01:36:29,489 --> 01:36:32,281
How could you sleep with Mr Tweed?

1437
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:40,550
Whoa!

1438
01:36:41,168 --> 01:36:42,583
- Boo!
- Boo!

1439
01:36:42,377 --> 01:36:43,960
I'm serious.

1440
01:36:44,463 --> 01:36:46,556
Well, seriously, William,

1441
01:36:46,339 --> 01:36:49,017
I think it's common knowledge
I would never ever, ever, ever

1442
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,259
sleep with a contestant
on American Dreamz.

1443
01:36:51,053 --> 01:36:53,511
I saw you through the keyhole.

1444
01:36:56,349 --> 01:36:58,068
He nailed her?

1445
01:37:00,395 --> 01:37:03,156
I guess you two think I'm stupid.

1446
01:37:03,565 --> 01:37:06,659
I guess you all think I'm stupid.

1447
01:37:07,152 --> 01:37:10,121
Well, I'll show you how stupid I am.

1448
01:37:10,405 --> 01:37:14,042
I'm going to blow myself up
with this bomb I found.

1449
01:37:18,288 --> 01:37:22,039
William, don't joke around
about something like that.

1450
01:37:21,833 --> 01:37:24,041
Oh, I am not joking!

1451
01:37:26,254 --> 01:37:28,056
What the fuck?

1452
01:37:28,215 --> 01:37:31,434
Great idea! On-air proposal, Chet Krogl!

1453
01:37:31,259 --> 01:37:32,894
Keep rolling! Keep rolling!

1454
01:37:32,677 --> 01:37:35,553
Get back to your camera!
Get back to your camera!

1455
01:37:35,347 --> 01:37:37,190
Come back! Come back!

1456
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:39,067
Get back to that camera!

1457
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:40,694
Oh, no.

1458
01:37:49,069 --> 01:37:50,745
Mr Williams?

1459
01:37:50,946 --> 01:37:55,166
Mr Williams, do not do this.
It is not worth it.

1460
01:37:55,617 --> 01:37:58,586
Your death will not solve any problems.

1461
01:37:58,370 --> 01:38:01,788
It'll solve the problem
of me feeling miserable.

1462
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,720
William? I'm the President.

1463
01:38:08,004 --> 01:38:10,265
I know who you are, sir.

1464
01:38:10,632 --> 01:38:12,757
Now, as your Commander in Chief,

1465
01:38:12,634 --> 01:38:16,271
I'm gonna have to ask you
not to blow yourself up.

1466
01:38:17,389 --> 01:38:20,442
Now, I've had dark days myself, William.

1467
01:38:20,809 --> 01:38:24,946
Days where I just wanted to lie in bed
and dream.

1468
01:38:25,939 --> 01:38:27,699
Never get up.

1469
01:38:31,403 --> 01:38:34,028
But I have come to think

1470
01:38:33,905 --> 01:38:37,208
that it is better to deal with reality,

1471
01:38:40,912 --> 01:38:43,454
no matter how unpleasant it is.

1472
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:46,843
That's my guy.

1473
01:38:53,008 --> 01:38:54,966
No disrespect, sir.

1474
01:38:56,428 --> 01:39:00,315
But if I can't have Sally Kendoo
then I don't want to go on living.

1475
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:02,890
William, wait...

1476
01:39:02,976 --> 01:39:05,184
Stay there! Stay there!

1477
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:10,148
My American dream

1478
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,192
Will come true for me

1479
01:39:18,658 --> 01:39:21,284
My American dream

1480
01:39:21,995 --> 01:39:24,620
For all to see

1481
01:39:24,539 --> 01:39:26,883
William! In here.

1482
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:30,168
Every woman and man

1483
01:39:30,379 --> 01:39:33,848
Has their own destiny

1484
01:39:37,469 --> 01:39:40,939
To dream American Dreamz

1485
01:39:41,098 --> 01:39:43,525
Dreamz with a Z

1486
01:39:43,308 --> 01:39:47,987
To dream American Dreamz

1487
01:39:47,771 --> 01:39:50,146
Dreamz with a Z

1488
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:54,567
To dream American Dreamz

1489
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:56,986
Dreamz with a Z

1490
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,463
What happened?

1491
01:40:42,993 --> 01:40:45,587
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1492
01:40:46,371 --> 01:40:49,163
You won this thing. You won it.

1493
01:40:48,957 --> 01:40:50,759
Where are you going?

1494
01:40:50,542 --> 01:40:53,720
Listen, those three gentlemen right there.
They were the ones with the bombs.

1495
01:40:53,503 --> 01:40:56,598
You see? Back there, those three.
They were the ones with the bomb.

1496
01:41:05,015 --> 01:41:06,649
Go!

1497
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:12,947
Mr President! Stop! Stop!

1498
01:41:27,037 --> 01:41:30,006
All right, everyone, please. Please, shut up.

1499
01:41:31,166 --> 01:41:32,967
It's starting.

1500
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:38,723
Last season's finale was
the highest-rated show in television history,

1501
01:41:38,507 --> 01:41:41,101
as my boyfriend, William Williams,

1502
01:41:40,884 --> 01:41:44,469
suffering from hallucinations
caused by posttraumatic stress

1503
01:41:44,262 --> 01:41:46,356
tragically lost his life.

1504
01:41:46,598 --> 01:41:48,775
There was a silver lining, though,

1505
01:41:48,558 --> 01:41:52,393
as he was voted the surprise winner
of American Dreamz.

1506
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:55,271
I know he would have been so thrilled.

1507
01:41:55,357 --> 01:41:57,315
Fellow runner-up, Omer Obeidi,

1508
01:41:57,109 --> 01:42:01,360
has been touring the country
with a repertory of Broadway hits.

1509
01:42:01,321 --> 01:42:05,041
Go, Greased Lightning
You're burning up the quarter mile

1510
01:42:04,825 --> 01:42:07,450
Greased Lighting
Go, Greased Lighting

1511
01:42:07,244 --> 01:42:10,338
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1512
01:42:10,455 --> 01:42:12,413
This isn't a hoedown!

1513
01:42:12,624 --> 01:42:15,082
Special guest judge,
President Staton,

1514
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:17,846
recently returned
from a Mid-East fact-finding tour

1515
01:42:17,629 --> 01:42:19,639
with his new Chief of Staff.

1516
01:42:19,423 --> 01:42:21,433
You choose first, Poopie.

1517
01:42:22,759 --> 01:42:25,384
I guess I'll go for the newspapers first.

1518
01:42:25,178 --> 01:42:29,806
You take the intelligence reports
and summit briefing and then we'll switch.

1519
01:42:29,599 --> 01:42:33,403
And I have
some pretty big shoes to fill.

1520
01:42:35,021 --> 01:42:36,823
Welcome!

1521
01:42:36,773 --> 01:42:40,858
Welcome back to another season
of American Dreamz.

1522
01:42:40,652 --> 01:42:44,998
I am so excited to be your new host,
it's such a dream come true for me.

1523
01:42:45,323 --> 01:42:50,118
And I'd like to dedicate this season
to someone who was very special to us all.

1524
01:42:50,412 --> 01:42:53,381
The great Mr Martin Tweed.

1525
01:42:57,169 --> 01:43:00,138
We will miss you so very much.

1526
01:43:00,922 --> 01:43:04,507
But now, on to an exciting new season!

1527
01:43:04,301 --> 01:43:06,676
And here are your dreamers!
