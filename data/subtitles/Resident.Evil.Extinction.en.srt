1
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,632
Take a sample of her blood
Then get rid of her

2
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:32,866
Yes, sir

3
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,671
The Umbrella Corporation thought
they contained the infection.

4
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,503
They were wrong.
Racoon City was just the beginning

5
00:07:27,544 --> 00:07:31,224
Within weeks, the T-Virus
had consumed the United States.

6
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,537
Within months, the world

7
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,884
The virus didn't just wiped out human life...

8
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:39,680
...lakes and rivers dried out.
Forests became deserts.

9
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:43,400
And whole continents were reduced to
nothing  more than baren wastelands.

10
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,161
Slowly but surely.
The Earth began to wither and die.

11
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,872
The few survivors that were, l
earnt to keep on the move.

12
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:06,840
We avoided major cities.

13
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:10,480
If we stopped in a place too long,
they would be drawn to us

14
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:14,287
Only a few at first, but then more and more...

15
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,387
A never ending army...

16
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,478
... of the undead.

17
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:24,922
For those of us left, staying on the road,
seemed the only way to stay alive.

18
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:41,396
This is KLKB We have 7 people here
in need of urgent medical attention

19
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,680
We need help. This is KLKB.

20
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:48,280
Can anyone hear us?
Can anyone help us? Please?

21
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:58,947
My baby

22
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:01,971
Please!

23
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,283
Please it save my baby!

24
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,037
You bitch!

25
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,214
You dropped my baby.

26
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:27,218
We're surrounded

27
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,217
We needed help. Can anyone hear us?
Can anyone help us?

28
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:31,628
Please!

29
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:34,489
Let us see.

30
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,312
What you got down there, missy?

31
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,387
I wouldn't do that!

32
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:52,890
That he happens to you.
Pull her back!

33
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,448
You show her, daddy

34
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:59,724
Daddy, daddy!

35
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:03,964
Jesus Christ, he's dead.

36
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:30,135
Think you're pretty smart, huh?
We will see

37
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:32,782
There you go, bitch!

38
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:35,756
We will see what you can do.

39
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,560
Open the cage!

40
00:11:46,066 --> 00:11:48,372
I am scared!

41
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:16,839
Let them loose.

42
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:06,541
That.

43
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:49,834
That was a juicy one, huh?

44
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:57,877
#In a gadada vida
#Don't you know that I love you

45
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:07,093
#In a gadada vida, baby
#Don't you know that I'll always be true

46
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,932
Hey Carlos, this is Claire.

47
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,624
You got any smokes?

48
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:13,559
No!

49
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,315
Like I'm supposed to believe that.

50
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:18,660
Claire, Would I lie to you?

51
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:27,172
LJ?

52
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:30,965
How can I help you?

53
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:31,895
Got any smokes?

54
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,989
No can't do.

55
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,065
What about alternates?

56
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:37,289
Sorry to say...

57
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:38,530
... we're all out of that too.

58
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,804
You gotta be shitting me?

59
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,564
Sorry campus,

60
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:44,804
...smoked the last two back in Salt Lake.

61
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:47,455
Yeah, people.

62
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:48,456
Damn it!

63
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,457
...end of the world.

64
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:24,212
Anyone else?

65
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:27,969
Paris facility. Food supplies now at 50%

66
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,870
6 casualties. Biohazard numbers increasing

67
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,724
London facility.

68
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,933
Food supplies down to 28%.

69
00:16:36,977 --> 00:16:40,690
17 casualties. Biohazard numbers increasing.

70
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,430
Gentlemen!

71
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,556
Dr. Isaacs.

72
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:47,041
How good of the science division to join us.

73
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:48,617
General Wesker

74
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:49,932
As one is

75
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:54,171
On the subject of the biohazards,
what does the science division have to report?

76
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:58,799
Well we now know conclusively that
they have no real need for sustenance

77
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:02,901
They hunger for flesh, but do not require it

78
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:11,072
My investigations indicates that
they'll remain active for decades
- We'll be trapped underground for decades?

79
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,929
What news of project Alice?

80
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,622
Using antibodies from her blood

81
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:20,303
I will develop a serum that will not just
combat the effects of the T-Virus,

82
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,690
...but potentially reverse it.

83
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:26,719
Giving back these creatures a measure
of their intelligence.

84
00:17:27,452 --> 00:17:28,683
Their memories.

85
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:32,994
Thus curving down their hunger for flesh.

86
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:35,481
You're confident you can domesticate them?

87
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:39,404
They are animals essentially.

88
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:41,238
We can train them.

89
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:43,992
If we can take away their basic instincts

90
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,237
They'll never be human...

91
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,097
...but would provide the basis for
a docile work force.

92
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,215
We can return to the surface.

93
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:53,352
After months of experiments,

94
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:54,492
...you have got nothing to show.

95
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:56,394
And we are left over underground.

96
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:59,498
Without the original Project Alice,
progress has been difficult.

97
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:02,838
I've been forced to replicate her
using flawed genetic models.

98
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,822
The results are unpredictable.

99
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:09,186
Project Alice and the subject
of domestication...

100
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,008
...is of the highest priority.

101
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:15,012
You'll concentrate on this
and exclude all other research.

102
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:17,798
I expect and updated report within a week.

103
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:20,357
Simply demanding results
will not guarantee them.

104
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:23,186
Then perhaps we should get someone else in charge

105
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:26,383
Someone who can give us the
reassurances we require.

106
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,660
Continue with your research, Doctor.

107
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:33,040
While it is still your research.

108
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,314
This meeting is adjourned.

109
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,379
Sorry about this, Stevie!

110
00:21:59,613 --> 00:22:03,440
This is Claire Redfield convoy,
present location at the Desert Trout Motel...

111
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:06,200
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

112
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:10,595
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?

113
00:22:18,356 --> 00:22:19,176
Seems quiet.

114
00:22:19,822 --> 00:22:21,467
Don't they always

115
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,606
Claire, it looks clear. We're going in.

116
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:29,025
It's your call, boys

117
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:31,398
Come on!

118
00:22:32,027 --> 00:22:33,154
Let's do it.

119
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:11,637
Get me a room

120
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:17,360
I'll take a water bed and Jacuzzi.
Then I'm going to rent me a porno.

121
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,641
What happened? Are you ok?

122
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:31,751
Yeah, it's all clear.

123
00:25:43,546 --> 00:25:44,886
Somebody need my help?

124
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,471
It's nothing, but if you insist...

125
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:51,708
That's right. So sit back and relax

126
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:55,844
Spread out, look for anything of use

127
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,014
Gas, food, ammo
You know the drill

128
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:00,602
You like playing rough, huh?

129
00:26:01,682 --> 00:26:03,020
Oh, I've had worse

130
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:04,742
I'm sure

131
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:07,535
You've always been gentle with me, babe.

132
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:09,504
Oh God!

133
00:26:09,542 --> 00:26:11,186
I'm leaving.

134
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:17,424
So, what do you say,
a dinner at my place, tonight?

135
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,012
Oh, I'm there.

136
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:11,184
This is amazing. He knows what it is.

137
00:27:16,564 --> 00:27:17,316
A camera.

138
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:20,906
You try.

139
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,213
Stand your ground.

140
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,768
Very good.

141
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:33,825
Unbelievable!

142
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:56,585
He has memory, and reasoning skills.
-This is incredible!

143
00:27:56,626 --> 00:27:59,176
The serum works.
You've domesticated them.

144
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:01,480
You've done it. Congratulations!

145
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:14,929
For the love of Jesus!

146
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,781
Pork and beans and some peaches there!

147
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:36,857
The suspense!

148
00:28:38,137 --> 00:28:40,171
You. Cat food.

149
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:44,959
Just kidding. It's pork and beans.

150
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:47,372
Hey!

151
00:28:47,418 --> 00:28:48,547
It is sufficient?

152
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:49,860
Soup.

153
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:51,722
Cream of mushrooms.

154
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,619
Yeah sure.

155
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,276
I'll be dammed!

156
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:57,618
How do you do that?

157
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:01,032
Just one of my skills.
It's a dying art, unfortunatelly.

158
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:04,138
This is the last one.

159
00:29:04,173 --> 00:29:05,713
Some kind of fruit.

160
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,542
Sorry that.

161
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:22,960
Have you checked the gas station yet?

162
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,962
Yeah, it's bone dry.

163
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,511
How are we looking here?

164
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,892
Well, Claire, if we can run these trucks on rust,

165
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,193
...we're looking pretty good.

166
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:36,682
All right!

167
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:42,543
Hey sweetheart!

168
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,098
Are we up yet?

169
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,778
It's almost done.

170
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:48,606
Who's out there?

171
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,051
Hey, Carlos!

172
00:29:54,097 --> 00:29:54,850
Claire?

173
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,462
All that working is slowing you down.

174
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,673
I want the perimeter up.

175
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:20,296
Last sentinel in place.
Perimeter is up and running.

176
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:23,460
All motion sensors online.

177
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,535
Cameras 100%.

178
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:32,710
Refried beans, fruit salad.

179
00:30:32,745 --> 00:30:34,531
Bueno.

180
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,497
Storm's coming. Let's start packing it up
and move inside.

181
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:44,588
Get on the bus.

182
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:46,413
Put this fire out.

183
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:26,937
This is Claire Redfield convoy.
Present location the Desert Trout Motel.

184
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,789
FLY OVER THERE

185
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:02,961
Heard the tranmissions again.
They're broadcasting from some town in Alaska
No infection. No Undead. They're isolated

186
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:12,377
Go To Alaska.

187
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:48,660
Activate number 87.

188
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,861
Shit!

189
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:14,436
Dr.Isaac!

190
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:15,363
What is it?

191
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:18,566
My sensors have detected a peak
is psy-organic activity.

192
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:20,322
Both alpha and beta waves.

193
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:22,116
From number 87?

194
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:24,356
No, activity is not from one of the clones.

195
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,809
It appeared outside the complex.

196
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:30,049
It's not possible.

197
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:32,012
My sensors are quite clear.

198
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:35,696
Massive psy-organic activity was
detected 15 minutes ago.

199
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,597
Sent it on the  desert location

200
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,444
Claire!

201
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:52,924
Oh God!

202
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:03,016
Carlos!

203
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:04,578
I see them.

204
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:08,539
Everybody, stay in your trucks.

205
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,042
What is going on?

206
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:14,222
Everybody, stay in your trucks.

207
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,329
Roll up your windows and keep quiet.

208
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:19,695
Close the windows up.

209
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:40,074
What's wrong with their eyes!?

210
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,905
They're feeding on infected flesh.

211
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:04,301
Fire it up, let's get out of here.

212
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,127
Yeah, that's a good idea.

213
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:07,813
Lock and load.

214
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:13,989
It's stuck.

215
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:16,585
Oh, hell no. Let's get out of here.

216
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:22,290
Let's get on the bus, come on.

217
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:30,604
Go! Go!

218
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,608
All raise.

219
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:47,102
Claire!

220
00:38:49,608 --> 00:38:50,055
Damn it!

221
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:53,426
Wait, Carlos, we have to evacuate the bus.

222
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:55,224
You got it.

223
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,148
Come on. Go Go Go!!

224
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,476
Come on!

225
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:55,246
Now, Betty, go

226
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:57,177
Go go go!

227
00:39:58,634 --> 00:39:59,656
Go!

228
00:40:05,424 --> 00:40:06,693
Hurry up!

229
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:27,375
Betty!

230
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:30,792
No!

231
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:37,203
Betty!

232
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:47,996
Go go go!

233
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:48,307
Dr Isaacs!

234
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:51,756
Another spike of abnormal activity
has been detected.

235
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:55,435
45% of probabilities that this is
Project Alice.

236
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:58,090
Triangulate, find the location.

237
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:03,777
Impressive!

238
00:42:04,824 --> 00:42:07,374
If it is her, her development
is extraordinary.

239
00:42:07,409 --> 00:42:10,161
Her powers seem to have grown
in a geometric rate.

240
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:12,719
since her escapre from the DTork facility.

241
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,840
You've made 10 trips to the surface
in the last 24 hours.

242
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:19,841
All unauthorized.

243
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:23,957
Any trips to the surface, specially to gather
fresh specimen, puts my men at risk.

244
00:42:25,304 --> 00:42:26,608
Why did you disobeyed orders, sir?

245
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:28,472
Isaacs!

246
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:32,023
My research has intensified.

247
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,542
Don't worry, they're perfectly secured.

248
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:45,160
You're supposed to be domesticating them.

249
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,711
Sometimes aggression has its uses.

250
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:49,981
What could you possibly needs these things for?

251
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,776
Dr. Isaacs!

252
00:42:51,818 --> 00:42:55,391
Specimen 87 has reached the final state
of the test grid.

253
00:42:55,436 --> 00:42:57,810
Perfect, put her on the screen.

254
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:04,535
Good girl.

255
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:14,460
That it is what tries.

256
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,836
He knows what he needs to know.

257
00:43:17,882 --> 00:43:19,632
I do not understand your remark.

258
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:23,461
My research will change the face of everything.

259
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:27,598
When you pick a side.

260
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:31,216
Choose the right one.

261
00:43:52,943 --> 00:43:53,908
Hi!

262
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,043
Hey!

263
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:04,238
This belongs to you?

264
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:05,728
Gave it to you last night.

265
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:08,207
For luck.

266
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:10,510
Thank you.

267
00:44:12,244 --> 00:44:14,170
What's your name?

268
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:15,373
K Mart.

269
00:44:17,245 --> 00:44:18,548
It's where they found me.

270
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:20,127
Claire and the others.

271
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:22,782
A few years back.

272
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:25,380
You have another name?

273
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:27,893
Never liked it.

274
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:34,203
And everybody I knew is dead.

275
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:36,194
Seemed like time for a change.

276
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,438
Anyone wants to say something?

277
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:15,152
Alice, this is Claire Redfield.

278
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,950
She's the one that put this convoy together.

279
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:20,360
Thank you so much for your help.

280
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:22,051
Claire!

281
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,777
Excuse me, something needs my attention.

282
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,874
Last six months we all signed up
for the convoy.

283
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:39,807
Pretty soon there'll be more of us
dead than alive.

284
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,329
Alice, what happened to you?

285
00:45:44,781 --> 00:45:46,601
Why did you leave after DTroy?

286
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:49,191
I didn't have a choice.

287
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:51,014
They were looking for me.

288
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:52,739
What do you mean?

289
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:54,909
They were tracking me.

290
00:45:55,538 --> 00:45:57,629
I couldn't be around you,
any of you.

291
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:00,495
I would have got you all killed.

292
00:46:00,536 --> 00:46:01,947
That's why you disappeared?

293
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,400
Broke into an Umbrella facility,..

294
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,050
...hacked into their computers.
Downloaded satellite trajectories.

295
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:10,662
Stayed off the grid.

296
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:13,011
After the world ended,

297
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,008
why stay out on your own?

298
00:46:18,016 --> 00:46:22,200
It's safer if I don't go around people.

299
00:46:23,237 --> 00:46:24,717
But you've come back!

300
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:50,520
Damn!

301
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,400
What time is it?

302
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:55,075
Chase,

303
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,023
What time is it?

304
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:01,150
Carlos, it is 12:14

305
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:03,636
Why, is there somewhere you've
got to be?

306
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,705
I guess I must be moving on.

307
00:47:15,226 --> 00:47:16,837
Welcome home.

308
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:27,526
Got a minute?

309
00:47:28,259 --> 00:47:29,083
Yeah.

310
00:47:30,432 --> 00:47:32,465
Everyone is grateful to you for helping us out.

311
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,464
How long am I gon'na stay?

312
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:36,544
Don't get me wrong.

313
00:47:37,718 --> 00:47:39,327
We are grateful.

314
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:44,166
They're all talking about what you did...

315
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,023
...and they are scared.

316
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,708
I don't blame them.

317
00:47:49,614 --> 00:47:51,954
People have a hammered in
getting rid of me.

318
00:47:54,545 --> 00:47:55,471
Not just you.

319
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,582
You're positive it's her?

320
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:10,659
62%, to great a chance to pass up.

321
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:16,440
If it is Project Alice, she's been evading
the satellite grid for years.

322
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:18,202
I've rerouted the remaining satellites...

323
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:21,794
...to reaquire the subject and
she'll be unaware of us.

324
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:23,687
I'll have an strike team ready within the hour.

325
00:48:23,726 --> 00:48:27,815
No, we'll establish a positive
identification first.

326
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:29,896
100%

327
00:48:29,931 --> 00:48:33,057
The group she's with includes
known associates.

328
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:37,026
The original Project Alice
is vital to my research.

329
00:48:37,068 --> 00:48:39,958
The whole process of domestication is in her blood.

330
00:48:39,998 --> 00:48:42,195
Her genetic structure is the key.

331
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,025
The longer we leave her out there
the greater the chance we lose her again
I can't risk that.

332
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:48,335
That decision isn't yours to make.

333
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:53,366
You'll take no action until this matter
has been discussed by the committee
at the next scheduled meeting.

334
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:55,678
Doctor!

335
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,331
That's an order!

336
00:49:01,478 --> 00:49:05,263
Claire, these are sequence of tranmissions.
It's the best indications of what we...

337
00:49:05,306 --> 00:49:06,304
Alaska!?

338
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:07,339
We have to check it out.

339
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:08,784
We can't just ignore it.

340
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,772
Have you any idea what kind
of journey that would be?

341
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:12,915
Yeah, a long one.

342
00:49:12,957 --> 00:49:17,462
And at the end of it, what? You have
no guarantee there is even anyone alive up there.

343
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,423
Claire, these transmissions say...

344
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:21,178
They are dated six months ago.

345
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:23,490
How many radio broadcasts have be
responded to?

346
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:26,423
How many times have we got there?

347
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,564
The transmissions say there is
no infection up there

348
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,175
It's isolated.

349
00:49:33,185 --> 00:49:34,010
It is safe.

350
00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:36,836
This convoy trust me with their lives.

351
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:39,528
These people don't need pipe dreams.

352
00:49:40,632 --> 00:49:43,273
May be that's exactly what they need.

353
00:49:44,426 --> 00:49:45,836
Look at them.

354
00:49:45,873 --> 00:49:48,941
Six months ago, there were 50 of us
then 40.

355
00:49:48,976 --> 00:49:50,516
Now there is less than 30.

356
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:54,035
We're starting to give up.

357
00:49:55,217 --> 00:49:56,969
They need somekind of hope.

358
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:06,656
We made a decision to make.

359
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,171
And too big!

360
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:11,938
It's too important for me to make it for you.

361
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:15,039
There is a change
there are survivors.

362
00:50:16,939 --> 00:50:17,866
In Alaska.

363
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:22,069
There is a chance...

364
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:24,861
...that the infection hasn't reached that far.

365
00:50:25,797 --> 00:50:27,172
But we don't know for sure.

366
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,440
So we have a choice.

367
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:32,136
We stay as we are...

368
00:50:32,968 --> 00:50:34,308
...or we travel to Alaska.

369
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:38,234
For Alaska?

370
00:50:44,573 --> 00:50:45,913
We will leave soon.

371
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,320
I hope you're right.

372
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,600
The food is virtually gone
Trucks are running on empty.

373
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:05,761
I've got half a tank of gas
That's it. Chase?

374
00:51:06,419 --> 00:51:10,680
Shit, I don't even have empty.
I have enough for 100 miles.

375
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:13,886
All right, if we're going to make this trip,
we're going to need to resupply.

376
00:51:14,005 --> 00:51:14,827
Yeah!

377
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:18,071
These are our options.

378
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:21,926
The nearest safest bet is,
right there.

379
00:51:22,898 --> 00:51:24,508
It's empty, I tried there.

380
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:27,172
Then we...

381
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:28,824
We could try this.

382
00:51:28,863 --> 00:51:30,098
Vegas.

383
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,851
We're limping and we're short
in gasoline and supplies.

384
00:51:34,896 --> 00:51:38,023
Vegas is too damn dangerous.

385
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:39,840
Place is going to be crawling with
the sons of bitches.

386
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,280
We have traveled every small town
for the last the 6 months.

387
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,648
We have to go to the big city.

388
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:45,817
She is right.

389
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,510
Vegas is our only bet.

390
00:51:53,115 --> 00:51:55,275
We'll establish a positive
identification first.

391
00:51:56,076 --> 00:51:57,676
"One hundred percent."

392
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,640
"Doctor that's an order."

393
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:21,040
"The Committee authorizes immediate action."

394
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:24,560
"Release of vehicles and personnel."

395
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,684
"Under the commando of the Dr Isaacs."

396
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:29,469
"That's an order."

397
00:53:27,562 --> 00:53:32,697
PEACE OVER THERE, LIVING OUTSIDE

398
00:53:33,158 --> 00:53:34,427
CAREFREE

399
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:41,902
STILL PEOPLE,
LIVING, LOVING PEOPLE

400
00:53:59,755 --> 00:54:01,024
Hey, are you all right?

401
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:02,405
Yeah, I am fine.

402
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:07,777
The pork and beans, man.
I don't see how them cowboys do it.

403
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:11,330
Just practice.

404
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:20,948
WELCOME To Fantastic
LAS VEGAS

405
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:24,553
Oh, my God!

406
00:54:57,261 --> 00:54:58,390
What happened to it?

407
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,492
The desert must have taken it back.

408
00:55:03,261 --> 00:55:04,601
Five years.

409
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:06,050
It put the sand back.

410
00:55:14,363 --> 00:55:15,808
It's empty.

411
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:19,219
No undead, nothing.

412
00:55:20,879 --> 00:55:23,287
Those birds must've  move the city block by block.

413
00:55:24,497 --> 00:55:26,144
Picked it clean.

414
00:55:34,221 --> 00:55:35,865
I don't see any truck stops.

415
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:40,596
Where are they?

416
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:45,865
There, lower parking at the casino up ahead
There's gas pumps there.

417
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,107
How in the hell do you know that?

418
00:55:47,149 --> 00:55:50,005
I dump 2Gs back in the day.

419
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:52,008
You lost 2000 dollars?

420
00:56:08,872 --> 00:56:09,623
Damn it!

421
00:56:22,075 --> 00:56:23,274
Spread them out.

422
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:28,381
We're going to have to move that.

423
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,067
Casey, we need a look out.

424
00:56:45,623 --> 00:56:46,751
Up there.

425
00:56:56,032 --> 00:56:56,677
Great.

426
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:11,025
Climbing the Eiffel Tower. My God.

427
00:57:12,252 --> 00:57:14,316
A few years ago
that'd have caused a stir.

428
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:20,578
Well, let the good times roll.

429
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,080
Let's get this done.

430
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,636
And get the hell out of here.

431
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,573
Mikey, get the wench.

432
00:57:45,617 --> 00:57:46,368
Yeah.

433
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:47,469
Carlos!

434
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:17,018
Move away.

435
00:58:25,163 --> 00:58:25,737
Get back.

436
01:00:17,693 --> 01:00:19,963
Just get in the back and stay quiet.
Go now, go!

437
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:24,873
It backs down

438
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,299
She really is magnificent!

439
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:47,442
When she is dead,
make sure you move in fast.

440
01:01:47,479 --> 01:01:50,028
We need a sample of her blood
while it is still warm.

441
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:51,440
That might be a problem.

442
01:01:54,203 --> 01:01:55,919
Satellite in position?

443
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,089
Yes, sir.

444
01:01:58,063 --> 01:02:00,026
Then shut her down.

445
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:40,219
Mikey!

446
01:03:05,155 --> 01:03:06,907
Mikey!

447
01:03:43,328 --> 01:03:45,082
She's fighting the conditioning.

448
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,083
Boost the control signal.

449
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:55,524
Help me, Chase!

450
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,287
Climb!

451
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:01,520
What is it?

452
01:05:01,557 --> 01:05:04,343
The satellite, somekind of malfunction.

453
01:05:32,172 --> 01:05:33,513
How long?

454
01:05:33,552 --> 01:05:36,959
Feed coming online in 15 seconds.

455
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:46,266
3,2 now!

456
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:51,133
Where is she going?

457
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,297
Shut her down!

458
01:06:01,684 --> 01:06:02,506
She's still coming!

459
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,851
Now!

460
01:06:04,891 --> 01:06:06,429
Oh shit!

461
01:06:15,131 --> 01:06:16,188
Back to base.

462
01:06:22,819 --> 01:06:24,088
The antivirus.

463
01:06:24,129 --> 01:06:26,186
Get me the antivirus.

464
01:06:43,278 --> 01:06:44,546
Why didn't you shoot?

465
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,679
Because if we're going to get to Alaska,

466
01:06:47,347 --> 01:06:48,920
...we need that helicopter intact.

467
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:51,800
Let's go look in the computer,
see where that helicopter is headed.

468
01:07:06,767 --> 01:07:07,564
How is he?

469
01:07:07,605 --> 01:07:09,120
Under house arrest, as you instructed.

470
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,272
He's been quiet.

471
01:07:26,207 --> 01:07:27,817
How much of this have you used?

472
01:07:27,862 --> 01:07:31,236
The blood increases the creatures power.

473
01:07:31,277 --> 01:07:34,239
Also increases the strength of the infection.

474
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:38,888
I needed it.

475
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:41,339
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

476
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:46,206
No!

477
01:07:46,482 --> 01:07:48,268
I have an idea.

478
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:51,131
You're out of control.

479
01:07:52,618 --> 01:07:59,683
Under execute order 1345 issued by Chancellor
for insubordination and gross misconduct in the field...

480
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,882
...I sentence you to summary liquidation.

481
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,475
Liquidation?

482
01:08:05,546 --> 01:08:06,334
No, just die.

483
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:19,229
Take the body to the surface,then
bring me the stats on Project Alice to see what...

484
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:20,232
Sir!

485
01:08:44,782 --> 01:08:47,120
Good thing we like a challenge.

486
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:08,637
Hold on!

487
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:11,842
They have the antivirus in there.

488
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:13,808
Just hold on.

489
01:09:15,797 --> 01:09:17,211
It is too late and you know it.

490
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:22,286
Besides, you need a way to get in there.

491
01:09:23,946 --> 01:09:25,004
And I have an idea.

492
01:09:39,855 --> 01:09:41,300
You keep them safe, huh!

493
01:09:41,337 --> 01:09:42,535
Got it.

494
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:49,605
Come here.

495
01:10:08,123 --> 01:10:09,053
Carlos.

496
01:10:09,091 --> 01:10:10,736
Save it.

497
01:10:16,608 --> 01:10:18,569
You just promise me one day...

498
01:10:19,813 --> 01:10:21,190
...When you get down there...

499
01:10:23,435 --> 01:10:24,456
...consider it done.

500
01:11:25,396 --> 01:11:26,876
I wish I had a smoke.

501
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:09,375
I'll be damned.

502
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:12,898
LJ sneaky son of a bitch.

503
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:22,213
All down.

504
01:13:17,308 --> 01:13:18,400
Quickly, go.

505
01:13:30,045 --> 01:13:30,990
Take it.

506
01:13:37,174 --> 01:13:38,442
You're not coming?

507
01:13:39,967 --> 01:13:41,541
Take care of the others.

508
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:09,265
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

509
01:17:09,979 --> 01:17:12,230
I am an artificial intelligence.

510
01:17:12,276 --> 01:17:13,064
I know what you are.

511
01:17:13,102 --> 01:17:14,853
I knew your sister.

512
01:17:15,019 --> 01:17:16,695
She was a homicidal bitch.

513
01:17:17,655 --> 01:17:22,473
My sister computer was merely following the most
logical path for the preservation of the human life.

514
01:17:22,514 --> 01:17:23,207
Yeah!

515
01:17:23,245 --> 01:17:25,209
Kill a few, save a lot!

516
01:17:25,495 --> 01:17:27,334
So, what happened here?

517
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:30,055
The Dr. Isaacs returned in
an infected state.

518
01:17:30,098 --> 01:17:33,778
He was bitten by a creature that been
treated with a newly developed serum.

519
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:36,198
A serum derived from your blood.

520
01:17:37,203 --> 01:17:40,022
The resulting infection has caused massive change.

521
01:17:42,511 --> 01:17:43,780
My blood?

522
01:17:43,822 --> 01:17:45,983
Your blood has bonded with the T-Virus.

523
01:17:46,615 --> 01:17:51,199
The Dr Isaacs correctly deduced that it
could be used to destroy the biohazards for good.

524
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:55,704
You mean that my
blood is the cure for all this.

525
01:17:55,749 --> 01:17:57,054
Correct.

526
01:17:57,785 --> 01:17:59,195
So why are you helping me?

527
01:17:59,233 --> 01:18:05,674
Your blood is pure. And this facility has
all you'd require to synthesize a cure.

528
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:10,436
You mean that this could all end!

529
01:18:10,472 --> 01:18:11,563
Correct.

530
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:14,019
There is, however,...

531
01:18:14,058 --> 01:18:15,597
...a faux paux.

532
01:18:22,885 --> 01:18:26,973
I have contained him to the lower levels,
but I cannot hold him there for much longer.

533
01:18:31,019 --> 01:18:31,983
Let's go.

534
01:18:43,535 --> 01:18:44,287
Alice!

535
01:18:45,742 --> 01:18:46,764
Good luck!

536
01:22:54,128 --> 01:22:55,292
You can't kill me.

537
01:22:57,755 --> 01:22:58,540
Yeah!

538
01:23:44,926 --> 01:23:45,889
I've told you.

539
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:48,018
I cannot die.

540
01:24:36,966 --> 01:24:39,962
For so long, I thought you were the future.

541
01:24:40,758 --> 01:24:41,886
It was wrong.

542
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:45,609
I am the future!

543
01:24:51,927 --> 01:24:52,890
No!

544
01:24:54,514 --> 01:24:57,512
You're just another asshole!

545
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:02,882
And we're both going to die down here.

546
01:25:24,854 --> 01:25:27,122
Yeah, you're the future all right.

547
01:26:02,124 --> 01:26:05,803
All attempts to contact the
North American facility have failed.

548
01:26:07,052 --> 01:26:09,452
How long have they been off the air?

549
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,400
17 hours.

550
01:26:11,308 --> 01:26:13,058
We must consider them lost.

01:26:13,136 --> 01:26:14,886
The plans remain unchanged.

552
01:26:14,929 --> 01:26:17,280
All data will be transferred to this facility.

553
01:26:17,281 --> 01:26:20,720
All research will continue under my
personal supervision.

554
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:22,537
I expect results within 1 month.

555
01:26:23,581 --> 01:26:25,782
You' won't have to wait that long, boys!

556
01:26:25,823 --> 01:26:28,055
Because I'm coming for you.

557
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,710
