1
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,910
It was great
to have you, Anwar.

2
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,810
Thank you.
It was an honor to be here.

3
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,340
Your presentation
was outstanding.

4
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,470
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,220
Okay. Take care.

6
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,240
Thank you.

7
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,520
Oh, there's my phone.
Sorry I have to rush. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,801
Good save!

9
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,241
Again, Mom.

10
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:22,771
Okay. Here it comes.

11
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:25,511
Okay, get back up.

12
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:28,081
- Hello.
- Did you just try to call me?

13
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,081
- No. Where are you?
- Well, I'm still in Cape Town.

14
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:31,311
I'm on my way
to the airport now.

15
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,841
Okay. I thought you were
gonna call me earlier.

16
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,351
I know. I'm sorry.
I had meetings all day.

17
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:36,381
- Oh, yeah. Right.
- Is that Dad?

18
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,021
Yeah. Do you wanna talk to him?

19
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:40,821
Your son wants a word with you.
Hold on.

20
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,231
Hey, Dad,
did you get me a present?

21
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:46,161
- Jeremy.
- What? He said he would.

22
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,031
- Did you?
- Hey, monkey. Sure I did.

23
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:51,001
Okay, cool.

24
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,171
- Okay, get in the goal. Hey.
- Come on, Mom.

25
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:54,971
- What are you doing?
- I'm playing soccer.

26
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:56,641
You'll give my mother
a heart attack.

27
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,371
- Yeah. Nuru's fine.
- Mom, kick the ball.

28
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,881
Is your flight schedule
still the same?

29
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:02,681
Yes.
Connecting through Washington.

30
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:04,452
- Arrive Chicago at 7:45 p.m.
- Uh-huh.

31
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,612
Okay, we'll see you
at the airport.

32
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,182
- Okay. Bye.
- All right. I love you.

33
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,092
- I love you, too.
- Bye.

34
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,122
Okay. You get ready.

35
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,182
Here it comes.

36
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:15,392
Goal!

37
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,593
Who you talkin' to?

38
00:03:15,623 --> 00:03:17,183
My grandmother.

39
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,793
She up early?

40
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,323
- Yeah.
- I call her once a week.

41
00:03:22,363 --> 00:03:24,193
Are her goats in a frenzy?

42
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:32,303
When are they picking you up?

43
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:34,603
- Too soon.
- Yeah.

44
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,073
Douglas.

45
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,154
You know,
they can't see me here.

46
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,654
I know.

47
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,724
- I gotta go.
- Come on. Come a--Come here.

48
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,124
Seriously, stop kissing me.

49
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:52,134
Stop it.

50
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:53,894
I see you at the office.

51
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:08,534
Fatima...you came.

52
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:11,204
You waited.

53
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:14,044
Your CDs.

54
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:16,284
Get on.

55
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:19,884
Did you listen to them?

56
00:04:19,924 --> 00:04:21,154
Yes.

57
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,194
They were okay.

58
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,224
You have the worst taste
in music.

59
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,435
Stop, Khalid.

60
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,265
We can't go this way.

61
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,705
It's a shortcut.

62
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,575
Khalid, I said stop.

63
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:47,245
My father has tea here
every morning.

64
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,485
You see him?

65
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:54,225
No.

66
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:56,385
Fatima.

67
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:57,555
Fatima, wait.

68
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,225
Fatima, wait.

69
00:04:59,795 --> 00:05:01,235
I want to meet him.

70
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,195
I told you, you can't.

71
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:04,465
Has he called?

72
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,635
Only to yell at me.

73
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,735
We should run away, just go.

74
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,045
We have our studies, Fatima.

75
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:17,386
We have to be realistic.

76
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,856
Okay for you.
No one's forcing you to marry.

77
00:05:20,886 --> 00:05:23,286
I just want to meet him.

78
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,226
He has chosen someone for me.

79
00:05:27,256 --> 00:05:28,816
He has chosen.

80
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:31,226
He might like me more.

81
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,496
You don't know my father.

82
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,606
Daddy.

83
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,466
Daddy, did I wake you?

84
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,616
No, sweetheart.

85
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,906
Daddy, do you dream about me
when you're sleeping?

86
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:53,916
I dream...

87
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:56,876
about you...

88
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:58,746
and your mother...

89
00:05:59,056 --> 00:06:01,186
and your sister.

90
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:07,697
Fatima said you stop dreaming
when you get married.

91
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:12,097
She's wrong, sweetheart.

92
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,937
You dream all your life.

93
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:17,177
It's one of God's gifts.

94
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:18,537
Understand?

95
00:06:19,517 --> 00:06:21,637
- Give me a kiss.
- No.

96
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:23,277
- One kiss.
- No.

97
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,337
Only one.

98
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:34,857
After Fawal,
we have meetings...

99
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:37,157
with Saeed El-Dalizi,
Minister of Interior...

100
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,787
Hamsa Reglori,
the head of defense.

101
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:41,957
Saeed's all right.

102
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:46,027
Reglori has a...a little bit
of a solophist back-story...

103
00:06:46,077 --> 00:06:47,937
but he knows
which side he's on.

104
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:51,707
So, uh, this, uh, Fa-Fawal--
What's his name?

105
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:54,178
- Abasi Fawal.
- Abasi Fawal.

106
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,948
- So he's the hard guy?
- Yeah. I--I've never met him.

107
00:06:58,388 --> 00:07:00,548
You're the, uh, knuckle-dragger.
I'm the pen-pusher.

108
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:03,488
He'll be more your contact
than mine.

109
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:34,048
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

110
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:35,108
Tea, please.

111
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:36,388
Okay.

112
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:43,959
How long you been here?

113
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:46,499
Five and a half months.

114
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:48,899
It's just on the other side
of the square.

115
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,139
- Ahmid, what's going on?
- Accident, sir.

116
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,279
Fuckin' traffic, man.

117
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,149
Out the back! Out the back!

118
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,340
Mr. Freeman.

119
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,410
I am sorry.

120
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:29,501
- Lee Mayers.
- Lee, it's Douglas.

121
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,131
How's Dixon?

122
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,311
He's dead.

123
00:09:33,341 --> 00:09:35,681
Fuck. Where are you now?

124
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,181
At the hospital.

125
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,511
- Are you hurt?
- No. I'm fine.

126
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:41,981
All right, listen. You're gonna
have to step up for a while.

127
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:44,781
Fill in for Dixon. Report
directly to me. Understood?

128
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:46,221
Yeah, I understand.

129
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:50,191
Douglas, are you okay?

130
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,991
Yeah.

131
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:07,972
Corrine Whitman.

132
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,412
Yes, it is.

133
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:14,982
All right, go ahead.

134
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,422
What's his condition?

135
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:28,602
Has anybody contacted
his wife yet?

136
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,862
No. I will do it.

137
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:36,302
- Any claim of responsibility?
- What is it?

138
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,672
No. All right. I'm comin' in.

139
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,202
What's happened?

140
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:47,242
Suicide bombing over there,
and they got one of us.

141
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:49,912
Jesus. It's 2:00 A.M.

142
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:51,722
Yeah. Well, I'm sure they
arranged it...

143
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,482
just to spite you, honey.

144
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,793
So he's Egyptian
with a green card?

145
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,493
Okay. When's he land?

146
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:06,333
Uh-huh.

147
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:09,503
Okay, do it.

148
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:14,243
I'm givin' you
the authorization.

149
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:25,893
Welcome to Washington, D.C.

150
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,623
Please follow the signs
to U.S. Customs.

151
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:31,653
All arriving passengers
must clear customs here...

152
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:34,163
before embarking
on connecting flights.

153
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:38,223
Please have your passports and
customs declaration forms ready.

154
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:43,734
Excuse me.

155
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:46,214
- Mr. Anwar El-Ibrahim?
- Yes?

156
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:48,074
Sir, we have
an emergency message for you.

157
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:50,104
- Would you follow us, please?
- What do you mean? What is it?

158
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:52,054
- Is it my wife? Is she all right?
- I apologize, sir.

159
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:54,114
They don't give us
any details.

160
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,494
- I got it.
- Okay, let's go.

161
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:34,385
19 dead, 75 injured.

162
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,755
El-Hazim have
claimed responsibility.

163
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:38,355
And the new guy?

164
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:40,395
Shrapnel in the neck.

165
00:12:40,735 --> 00:12:41,925
He bled to death.

166
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,635
Damn.

167
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:45,895
Sir.

168
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:47,805
You have calls
from Corrine Whitman, CIA...

169
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:50,735
and Mr. Davis
at the U.S. State Department.

170
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:52,775
Give me Corrine first.

171
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,615
One dead American.

172
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:28,836
Where am I?

173
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,846
Rashid Salimi.

174
00:13:31,886 --> 00:13:33,086
What?

175
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:35,916
Rashid Salimi.

176
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:39,396
No, sir.
My name is Anwar El-Ibrahimi.

177
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:41,866
Rashid is
an Egyptian national...

178
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:46,026
who's claimed responsibility
for today's terror attack.

179
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:47,266
What attack?

180
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,826
Why don't you tell me?

181
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:52,306
Look...

182
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:55,536
I don't know anything
about any attack of any kind.

183
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:58,136
I've been on a plane
from South Africa for 18 hours.

184
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,286
Is this your phone?

185
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,406
It looks like mine. Why?

186
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:09,147
- Numbers match.
- What numbers?

187
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:11,627
Rashid has placed several calls
to your phone...

188
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:12,717
over the last few months.

189
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,257
No, sir. I've never talked
to anybody named Rashid.

190
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:16,457
What were you doing
in Cape Town?

191
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:19,437
Why am I shackled this way?
I want to speak to a lawyer.

192
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,837
What were you doing
in Cape Town?

193
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:29,407
Attending a conference...

194
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:32,177
for chemical engineers.

195
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:35,117
I was invited by the South
African Fossil Fuels Foundation.

196
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:36,177
Who did you meet with?

197
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:40,387
List them.

198
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:44,317
Can I call my wife?

199
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:45,957
No.

200
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:10,518
These are all
well-regarded professionals...

201
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:12,488
in my industry.

202
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:16,598
Are you familiar
with bomb-making techniques?

203
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:17,648
What?

204
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:20,858
Have you ever constructed
a bomb?

205
00:15:22,198 --> 00:15:23,458
This is ridiculous.

206
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:25,798
You've never
constructed a bomb?

207
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:27,168
No, sir.

208
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:40,878
Six years ago...

209
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:46,119
I, uh...I worked briefly on
a study commissioned by the ATF.

210
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,679
Nothing to do
with bomb-making.

211
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,159
Just detection, using
trace paper technology.

212
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,219
You can check it out.

213
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,529
Thank you.

214
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:56,489
We will.

215
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:00,399
The point is...

216
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,529
you have experience
with explosives.

217
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:08,279
There were ten of us
on that team.

218
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:11,909
It was for a government agency.
Have you arrested them, too?

219
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,679
Rashid Salimi.

220
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:17,319
I don't know anyone
named Rashid!

221
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,840
Where is he?

222
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,840
I don't know.

223
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,900
I'm gonna call him.

224
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,510
You've reached Anwar.
Please leave a message.

225
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,740
Hey, it's us.
We're at Arrivals...

226
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,950
and we don't see you anywhere.

227
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,690
Maybe we got
the information wrong.

228
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,190
Call me back when you get this.
Okay, bye.

229
00:17:33,271 --> 00:17:36,061
El-Hazim claimed responsibility
within minutes of the attack.

230
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,091
The incident took place
in a crowded square...

231
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,571
as residents
were heading to work...

232
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:42,511
leaving nineteen dead
and dozens more injured.

233
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,101
The fourth
in a series of attacks...

234
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,971
the bombing has once again
raised concerns...

235
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:47,571
that extremists
are targeting governments...

236
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:51,281
I need everything we have
on Al-Hazim Brigade. Okay?

237
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,751
I have been asked
to fill in for Dixon...

238
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,951
until a replacement
can be found.

239
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,591
Uh, I need a work-up on Fawal.

240
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,891
Uh, Abasi Fawal.

241
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:08,492
Okay.

242
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:19,372
I need a shirt.

243
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,852
- Are you okay?
- I need a shirt.

244
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:23,472
I need a shirt. I need--I need
you to get me shirt...

245
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:24,572
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

246
00:18:24,622 --> 00:18:25,742
Okay, I need a plain shirt...

247
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:26,842
- not a--not a shirt with stripes.
- Yes.

248
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:27,912
- I know what a shirt is, Douglas.
- Just a plain cotton shirt.

249
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:29,182
Do you--Do you know
what I'm talk--Okay. -Okay?

250
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,752
Okay. Good. I need a shirt.

251
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,282
And I--I need a--I need,
um...uh...

252
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:35,352
What? Gum?

253
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:36,552
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

254
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:38,562
Okay. Okay.

255
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:47,902
If Cape Town says he boarded
and D.C. says he didn't...

256
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,372
then one of them is wrong.

257
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:51,972
I'm sorry, sir,
but you cannot just get...

258
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:54,812
on a plane in one country
and not get off in another.

259
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:56,183
Now, you must have
some record of him...

260
00:18:56,223 --> 00:18:59,383
arriving or transferring
to another airline.

261
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:00,613
Yes.

262
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,453
Well, check again.

263
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:05,783
Is he asleep?

264
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,353
He wants you to read to him.

265
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:08,993
Can you do it?
I'm on hold.

266
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,393
Did you speak to the hotel?

267
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:13,633
They said they dropped him
off at the airport on time.

268
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:17,293
Everything will be all right.

269
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:18,963
He probably just missed
his connection.

270
00:19:19,013 --> 00:19:20,473
He hasn't called.

271
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:26,913
Lina.

272
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:34,923
Dad, when is Fatima
coming home?

273
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:40,453
Finish your milk.

274
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:53,464
Please, Abasi.

275
00:19:54,074 --> 00:19:56,344
Tell her you made a mistake.

276
00:19:57,344 --> 00:19:59,944
It's not the same
as when we were young.

277
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,344
There are rules, Samia.

278
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:03,844
There are rules.

279
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:06,724
Look at my sister Layla.

280
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:09,244
She'll never marry.

281
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,264
Call her, Abasi.

282
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:17,154
Please.

283
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:19,134
For me.

284
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:20,804
I have called.

285
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,634
I've left a dozen messages.

286
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:23,904
She doesn't answer.

287
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:24,994
What can I do?

288
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:29,474
Leave the egg alone!

289
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:32,074
Have you called your father?

290
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:33,745
Not yet.

291
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:36,485
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:37,585 --> 00:20:40,615
Don't worry, it's nothing.

293
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:42,885
What have I done?

294
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:52,095
I'm proud of you
for standing up to him.

295
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:55,005
That's my taxi.

296
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,565
Please stay.

297
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:05,345
I want you in this apartment
by eight while I'm gone.

298
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:09,775
If my brother knew I was
leaving you here alone...

299
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:14,085
he'd kill me.

300
00:21:14,755 --> 00:21:15,785
Okay?

301
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:22,126
See you in a few days.

302
00:21:26,806 --> 00:21:29,276
We think it was an attempt
on Abasi Fawal.

303
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:32,106
Dixon was just wrong place,
wrong time.

304
00:21:32,146 --> 00:21:34,306
If they got one of us,
that's a victory for them.

305
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,116
These are the latest of Rashid?

306
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:39,046
Three months after he escaped
the Jordanians.

307
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:42,786
They should've taken him out
when they had the chance.

308
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:44,916
So without Dixon,
who do we have?

309
00:21:44,956 --> 00:21:47,546
Douglas Freeman, analyst.

310
00:21:47,596 --> 00:21:48,756
Degree in economics
from Princeton.

311
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:51,266
Started out as a junior exec
in the oil business.

312
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:52,856
How long with us?

313
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,096
Since September 12th,
give or take.

314
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:58,196
Jesus.
He looks 12 years old.

315
00:21:58,236 --> 00:21:59,936
Do you think he can do this?

316
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:01,876
He's smart.
He's been getting close...

317
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,736
with the ministers
of finance and interior.

318
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:07,076
He initiated the Madrasa
charity investigation...

319
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:08,636
that,
uh, brought in forty-four...

320
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:09,707
- al Qaeda fundraisers.
- Lee...

321
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:11,647
analyst is not a jackal.

322
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:14,447
We're spread thin.

323
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:19,157
Did you polygraph
the Egyptian?

324
00:22:19,197 --> 00:22:20,957
Yeah. Came up clean.

325
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,787
Polygraph doesn't mean diddly.

326
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:25,697
Well, we always say that
when they pass.

327
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:29,797
Somethin' funny?

328
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:34,297
We lost someone today.

329
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:40,137
I traced him with Interpol,
Mossad, the Egyptians.

330
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,207
Nobody's interested.

331
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:42,837
I'm interested.

332
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:46,017
Okay.

333
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:49,417
What do you wanna do?

334
00:22:50,857 --> 00:22:52,487
We can't hold him here
indefinitely.

335
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:56,357
Put him on the plane.

336
00:22:58,468 --> 00:22:59,588
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:53,579
My grandma has
the middle floor. I'm on top.

338
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,649
I don't want her
to find me here.

339
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:58,749
She's away for the week.

340
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,919
I have a back way in.
No one will see us.

341
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,269
You okay?

342
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,330
My grandma's room.

343
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,230
Come.

344
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
Jeremy,
stop bouncing the ball.

345
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,060
You know you're not supposed
to do that in the house.

346
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,760
Why can't I come with you?

347
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,460
Because you have school,
and you have tryouts this week.

348
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,030
What's all this stuff?

349
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,440
These are my important papers,
Jeremy.

350
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,840
I need you to get off the bed.

351
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,871
Are you gonna see Daddy?

352
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:25,011
Yeah.

353
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:27,311
Why didn't he come home?

354
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:33,011
He just had to stay at work
a little bit longer.

355
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:35,491
Jeremy, your food
is on the table.

356
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,121
I wanna wait for Mommy.

357
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:40,191
I'll be down in just a second.
Okay, honey?

358
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,531
Go on.

359
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:48,161
Sorry. I just--I have a copy
of his green card...

360
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,191
but I can't find a copy...

361
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,501
- of his passport anywhere.
- Under my name.

362
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:56,241
Who is this man
you're going to see?

363
00:25:58,111 --> 00:25:59,741
He's a friend from college.

364
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:02,011
He works for a senator.

365
00:26:23,612 --> 00:26:24,942
Like jasmine.

366
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:00,643
Do you sell what you paint?

367
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:02,113
Some.

368
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:04,713
I'm getting better.

369
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:11,583
No.

370
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,993
Those are just drafts.

371
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:25,093
That's you?

372
00:27:29,103 --> 00:27:30,263
And them?

373
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,943
My brother and grandma.

374
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:37,613
This is your mother?

375
00:27:38,313 --> 00:27:40,143
She was beautiful.

376
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:43,413
You are the beautiful one.

377
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:51,264
You and your brother
have the same eyes.

378
00:27:51,894 --> 00:27:53,454
Where's he now?

379
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,764
Does he visit you?

380
00:27:58,534 --> 00:27:59,694
No.

381
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,964
Not anymore.

382
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:04,374
Are you hungry?

383
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:09,504
Come, let's go to the kitchen.

384
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:27,094
Saeed.

385
00:28:27,134 --> 00:28:28,794
Ah, Douglas.

386
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:30,134
I thought today
you might not come.

387
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:32,034
Yeah.

388
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:34,374
- Do you want a cigar?
- No, thank you.

389
00:28:34,404 --> 00:28:35,705
Tea?

390
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:37,145
Uh, please. Yeah.

391
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,575
Do you guys have anything yet?

392
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:43,705
Not yet. You?

393
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,085
No.

394
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,345
I got it.

395
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:50,885
You know, you have
a new detainee on the way.

396
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:51,915
Egyptian...

397
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:54,555
lives in America.
He's a chemical engineer.

398
00:28:54,595 --> 00:28:56,525
Yeah, I got
the cable last night.

399
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:58,535
- Who's observing?
- Me.

400
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:04,825
You're not a case officer,
Douglas.

401
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:07,105
Nope.

402
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,905
Maybe I can
finally use my gun.

403
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,337
We've got 58 percent approval
after your statement.

404
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:14,897
There's no reason
for him to hide.

405
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,607
It's not the bill
he's concerned about.

406
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:17,737
- It's the attachment, Alan.
- I know.

407
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:19,647
- Okay, there's a compromise here.
- Yeah. Obviously.

408
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:21,377
This bill's gonna get crushed
in committee...

409
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:22,407
if you guys
don't get behind it.

410
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:23,937
Yeah?

411
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:26,977
Um, damn. I got to go.

412
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:28,217
I'll talk to the senator.

413
00:30:28,257 --> 00:30:30,387
Thank you. Thank <i>him.</i>

414
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:36,017
Izzy, you're here.

415
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:39,227
Um...God, look at you.

416
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:42,237
You didn't tell me you're,
like, a hundred months pregnant.

417
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:43,607
Thank you for seeing me, Alan.

418
00:30:44,237 --> 00:30:45,397
Yeah.

419
00:30:45,437 --> 00:30:47,467
Well, let's get you off
your feet, all right?

420
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:48,907
Okay. Yeah.

421
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,177
You look
like you're about to pop.

422
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,177
Uh, something to drink?
Eat? Eat?

423
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:55,207
Uh, no. Just a bottle of water
would be great...

424
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:56,777
if you have that. -Sam, can we get
a couple of bottles of water?

425
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:58,687
- Sam, Izzy. Izzy, Sam.
- Hi.

426
00:30:58,717 --> 00:31:00,888
- We got Senator Lewis.
- Bravo.

427
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:02,358
Right. Am I walkin' too fast?

428
00:31:02,388 --> 00:31:04,188
No, no, no.
I'll get there eventually.

429
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:05,388
Okay.

430
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:08,188
You've done well for yourself.

431
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:09,698
I always knew you would.

432
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:11,758
Thank you.

433
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,368
So, uh, you married Anwar.

434
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:20,068
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

435
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:22,208
What'd your father
say about that?

436
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:24,508
I'm sure you can imagine.

437
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:25,948
Yeah.

438
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,578
Thought about inviting you
to the wedding.

439
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:32,388
I probably
wouldn't have come.

440
00:31:36,158 --> 00:31:41,218
I--I, um, brought some things
that I thought might be helpful.

441
00:31:43,698 --> 00:31:45,798
This is a copy
of his Egyptian passport...

442
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,268
- Listen, Izzy.
- and his green card.

443
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:48,929
My guy at INS,
he got back to me...

444
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:52,139
and he assures me that Anwar
never entered the United States.

445
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,669
- The South Africans made a mistake.
- I need you...

446
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,039
to take a look at this.

447
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,569
This is a copy of his
most recent credit card charges.

448
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:03,489
He spent $70 on duty free
during his flight to D.C.

449
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,149
He was on that plane, Alan.

450
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,020
No!

451
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,800
I've got Jim Alderman
on the line.

452
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,170
Jim. Yeah, thanks
for getting back to me.

453
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,970
Listen. I'm sitting
on convincing evidence...

454
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,910
that El-Ibrahim
landed in D.C.

455
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,940
He purchased something
in the in-flight duty free.

456
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,660
What did he say?

457
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,960
Uh, nothing helpful.

458
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,201
Sam, can you get me a minute
with the senator?

459
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,171
- Peace be with you.
- And with you.

460
00:34:22,962 --> 00:34:25,562
I thought you weren't coming.

461
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:51,022
Come.

462
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,092
Sir, he's here.

463
00:35:30,763 --> 00:35:33,823
Douglas Freeman,
Abasi Fawal.

464
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:37,533
Uh, sorry about Mr. Dixon.
Uh...

465
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,733
Definitely, they were after me.

466
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:44,073
Second time.

467
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:46,513
Second time. Please.

468
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:53,144
Drink, my friend.

469
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,814
No, thank you.

470
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:00,694
So Dixon
was replacing Simms.

471
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,024
Yeah.

472
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,054
Yes. And now it's you.

473
00:36:06,104 --> 00:36:08,794
Now it's me.

474
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,864
Please.

475
00:36:19,784 --> 00:36:20,944
Almonds.

476
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:22,974
Good. Very good.

477
00:36:27,254 --> 00:36:28,814
Um...

478
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:31,754
Our questions.

479
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:33,664
Of course. Thank you.

480
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,425
Al Jazeera
is running footage.

481
00:36:41,505 --> 00:36:46,805
<i>Security authorities</i>
<i>have confirmed 19 deaths.</i>

482
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:50,005
<i>Most of the victims</i>
<i>are women and children.</i>

483
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:54,005
<i>A tourist video</i>
<i>found at the scene...</i>

484
00:36:54,055 --> 00:36:56,385
<i>shows the source of the blast.</i>

485
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:09,965
<i>In an email to the station,</i>
<i>El-Hazim has claimed...</i>

486
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,865
Why the hell didn't we get that?

487
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:20,165
Call Abdou, I want a copy now.

488
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,446
So...

489
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,916
you're staying to observe.

490
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:35,386
I will ask your questions.

491
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:37,796
But there will be no
suggestions, no interference...

492
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:40,096
while I work. Understood?

493
00:37:42,466 --> 00:37:43,766
Good.

494
00:37:44,266 --> 00:37:49,066
The struggle against
the Zionist and the Crusader...

495
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:54,076
represents the decisive battle
between faith and infidelity.

496
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:57,546
Between good and evil.

497
00:37:58,646 --> 00:38:04,416
The destruction of the infidel
and hypocrite is your sacred duty.

498
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:09,756
When you meet the Apostate you are
commanded to "strike the necks."

499
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:19,097
The Crusader
talks about freedom.

500
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:25,837
Jihad is the only path
to freedom.

501
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:28,737
Do not fear their bullets.

502
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:32,617
What can they do...

503
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:35,577
but set your soul free?

504
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,357
On the Day of Judgment...

505
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:43,587
when you stand before
the Almighty God...

506
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:46,097
and He asks you...

507
00:38:47,197 --> 00:38:50,797
"Why did you not fight
for the cause of God?

508
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:55,497
"And for the oppressed. The men,
the women and the children?

509
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:05,348
"What did you do
with the one weapon I gave you?

510
00:39:05,748 --> 00:39:07,778
"Your body."

511
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:11,788
What will be your answer?

512
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:15,558
Will you display the wounds of martyrdom

513
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:19,459
and walk through the gates of heaven?

514
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:28,128
Or, will you hang your head
in shame and roast in the fires of hell?

515
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:33,708
Success is from God.

516
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:37,148
May the peace and blessings and
glory of God, the Almighty, be upon you.

517
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:40,018
Amen.

518
00:39:40,918 --> 00:39:42,048
Amen.

519
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:43,978
Praise God.

520
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:45,788
God is great!

521
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:28,599
S-s-sir?

522
00:40:29,569 --> 00:40:32,269
There's been
some kind of mistake.

523
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:34,739
Why have my clothes
been taken from me?

524
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:36,709
I want my clothes.

525
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,650
No one has told me why I'm here
or--or what I've done.

526
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,650
I--This is crazy!
I want my clothes!

527
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,090
And I want to speak
to a lawyer immediately!

528
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,520
Yes. Yes, of course, you do.

529
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,930
I have just a few questions.

530
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:00,260
If you answer honestly,
we can send you home.

531
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,240
Sir.

532
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,970
Sir. Are you American?

533
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,410
I've lived in the States
for twenty years.

534
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,510
My wife is American.

535
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,110
Her name
is Isabella Fields El-Ibrahimi.

536
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,980
If you just call her--

537
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,550
You are Egyptian. Yes?

538
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,591
You are Egyptian.

539
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:31,991
Yes.
I was born in Egypt...

540
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,661
but I came to the States
when I was fourteen years old.

541
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,271
I studied at NYU.

542
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:38,931
- I got my mas--
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

543
00:41:38,971 --> 00:41:40,911
I have it all here.

544
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:43,541
Your English is beautiful.

545
00:41:43,581 --> 00:41:45,341
What language do you speak
with Rashid?

546
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:47,311
I don't know who that is.

547
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:50,181
I've never talked
to anyone named Rashid.

548
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:52,621
So how do you explain
these calls?

549
00:41:52,651 --> 00:41:54,211
What?

550
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:58,551
Uh, it must be a--a mistake.

551
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:00,621
Maybe it's a mix-up.

552
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:03,931
My name is "El-Ibrahim-ee."

553
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:08,831
But, um, sometimes
people call me "El-Ibrahim."

554
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:11,171
But it's "Ibrahim-ee"
with an "i."

555
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:13,331
- With an "i." "Ibrahim-ee."
- So--

556
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:15,432
Yes. Very good.

557
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:19,002
Rashid Salimi and one
El-Ibrahimi, with an "i."

558
00:42:19,052 --> 00:42:21,312
Don't tell me
he didn't call you.

559
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:25,012
All this info, it's lies.

560
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:28,312
I don't know.

561
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:30,932
You never get calls from Egypt?

562
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:32,192
No.

563
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:37,192
Yes. I mean, yes.
My--My family is in Egypt.

564
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:41,732
- Then they call you.
- Of course, they call me.

565
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:43,762
Of course. What about?

566
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:47,202
Little things.
Uh, family things.

567
00:42:47,242 --> 00:42:48,902
Like what? Like, uh...

568
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,772
Um, like...

569
00:42:50,812 --> 00:42:52,802
like my Uncle Yusef.

570
00:42:52,852 --> 00:42:56,982
He called, asking if NYU
is a good school...

571
00:42:57,022 --> 00:42:59,712
for his...for my cousin.

572
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:00,812
Yusef who?

573
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:07,223
Yusef Abdul Hamid?

574
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,703
Yes.

575
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,133
- Where is he?
- What?

576
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:18,973
Your uncle.

577
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:22,243
Where is your uncle?

578
00:43:22,283 --> 00:43:24,213
Why?

579
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,743
Why do you want
to talk to my uncle?

580
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:30,473
My friend...

581
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:38,153
put yourself
in our position.

582
00:43:38,193 --> 00:43:40,683
A criminal named Rashid...

583
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:44,493
has been on a bombing campaign
for two years.

584
00:43:44,533 --> 00:43:48,473
In the last few months,
suddenly his explosives...

585
00:43:48,503 --> 00:43:52,064
are more sophisticated,
more deadly.

586
00:43:52,114 --> 00:43:55,974
You are an engineer.
You have the chemical know-how.

587
00:43:56,014 --> 00:44:00,884
We have direct calls to you
from a number linked to Rashid.

588
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:03,484
What are we to think?
You tell me.

589
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:05,584
What are we to think?

590
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:07,384
It's a mistake.

591
00:44:08,924 --> 00:44:10,584
It's a mistake.

592
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,834
A mistake.

593
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:31,344
What if I were to tell you that
we have a signed confession...

594
00:44:31,384 --> 00:44:34,974
from one
of Rashid's lieutenants...

595
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:38,684
that you have been aiding them
for more than a year?

596
00:44:38,724 --> 00:44:41,995
Then...I'd say you were lying.

597
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:49,695
Put him in the hole.

598
00:45:20,835 --> 00:45:22,235
Would you like some water?

599
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:34,576
Come. I want
to show you something.

600
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,676
They close the fool's hand...

601
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:42,986
around this
pressure release trigger.

602
00:45:43,026 --> 00:45:44,386
Pull the pin.

603
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:48,356
It's like a hand grenade.

604
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:52,096
You let go, it detonates.

605
00:45:53,496 --> 00:45:55,196
If the bomber
changes his mind...

606
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:59,106
they have a shooter
who will take him out.

607
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:01,436
The hand releases.

608
00:46:03,546 --> 00:46:04,636
Boom.

609
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:17,487
They make it like this...

610
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:19,547
with nails and bolts...

611
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:22,297
for maximum human damage.

612
00:46:24,337 --> 00:46:28,067
This is what killed
your friend Dixon.

613
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:37,637
The work we do
is important, Douglas.

614
00:46:37,677 --> 00:46:39,777
It is sacred.

615
00:46:39,817 --> 00:46:41,677
We save lives.

616
00:46:47,327 --> 00:46:49,317
Dixon wasn't my friend.

617
00:47:08,978 --> 00:47:10,498
I let myself in.

618
00:47:11,548 --> 00:47:12,678
Yeah.

619
00:47:12,718 --> 00:47:14,738
- Do you mind?
- No.

620
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:27,518
- I gotta get cleaned up.
- No, you don't.

621
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:28,728
Yeah.

622
00:47:31,438 --> 00:47:32,458
Come on.

623
00:47:40,408 --> 00:47:42,348
I, uh...

624
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:45,338
Oh.

625
00:48:20,449 --> 00:48:21,879
Douglas.

626
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:33,019
Talk to me.
What happened today?

627
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:38,869
It was a bad day.

628
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,260
What happened?

629
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,400
That's him.

630
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,990
You see?

631
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,470
Heading right for me. The dog.

632
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,930
Is someone trying to stop him?

633
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:18,100
Wait, wait.

634
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,940
She's blocking him.

635
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,110
The gunshot...

636
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:35,161
Useless.

637
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:55,771
Is it a boy or a girl?

638
00:49:58,351 --> 00:49:59,651
Oh, um...

639
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:03,081
We wanted to wait.

640
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,521
Well, it sounds like
a law-enforcement issue.

641
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:14,901
Have you spoken to the FBI?

642
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:17,492
Yeah.
They never heard of him.

643
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,942
I-I-I don't know how I can
help you on this one, Alan.

644
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:24,342
All right.

645
00:50:24,382 --> 00:50:27,372
What's your involvement
with this?

646
00:50:27,412 --> 00:50:30,012
Uh, she is an old friend.

647
00:50:32,152 --> 00:50:34,412
She outside?

648
00:50:34,452 --> 00:50:37,322
Uh, you want me to say hello.
I mean, I'd rather not.

649
00:50:37,352 --> 00:50:39,652
No, I'd rather you not.

650
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:43,492
I got a question.

651
00:50:43,532 --> 00:50:45,292
Shoot.

652
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:47,392
When the CIA decides
to move someone covertly...

653
00:50:47,432 --> 00:50:48,632
who gives the order for that?

654
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:52,902
Corrine Whitman.

655
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:54,032
Right.

656
00:50:56,312 --> 00:50:57,402
Thanks.

657
00:50:59,212 --> 00:51:00,512
She comes in here once a week...

658
00:51:00,542 --> 00:51:02,482
to brief the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

659
00:51:02,512 --> 00:51:04,852
Now, Senator Hawkins
is on that committee. Okay?

660
00:51:04,882 --> 00:51:06,613
They have a relationship.

661
00:51:11,663 --> 00:51:13,123
I need to be delicate...

662
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:16,823
so let me do the talking.

663
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,833
I don't want her to know
you're in the room, okay?

664
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:19,993
- Okay.
- Okay?

665
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:21,223
- Yeah.
- Izzy?

666
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:22,493
Yeah.

667
00:51:23,703 --> 00:51:25,003
Okay.

668
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,283
Corrine Whitman's office.

669
00:51:37,313 --> 00:51:39,213
Hello. Alan Smith,
Senator Hawkins' office.

670
00:51:39,253 --> 00:51:40,913
I need to speak
with Ms. Whitman.

671
00:51:40,953 --> 00:51:43,943
This is Todd Hamilton, Mrs.
Whitman's executive assistant.

672
00:51:43,993 --> 00:51:46,053
Can I ask what this is about?

673
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:48,153
Anwar El-Ibrahim.

674
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:51,393
Please hold.

675
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:58,734
Mr. Smith?

676
00:51:58,774 --> 00:52:00,634
Yes.

677
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:03,274
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Whitman is not available.

678
00:52:04,684 --> 00:52:08,584
Generally, or to talk
about Mr. El-Ibrahim?

679
00:52:08,614 --> 00:52:11,584
Please submit your inquiry
in writing to her office.

680
00:52:17,524 --> 00:52:19,684
What does that mean?

681
00:52:19,724 --> 00:52:22,284
CIA calls it
"extraordinary rendition."

682
00:52:22,334 --> 00:52:24,194
It started under Clinton.

683
00:52:24,234 --> 00:52:26,924
The agency wanted to be able to
move suspected terrorists...

684
00:52:26,964 --> 00:52:30,374
without having to formally apply
for extradition.

685
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:32,634
Now, it's supposed
to be used...

686
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:34,574
only under
extraordinary circumstances.

687
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:37,844
But after 9/11,
it took on a whole new life.

688
00:52:37,884 --> 00:52:40,474
Basically, the government
has authorized the seizure...

689
00:52:40,514 --> 00:52:43,145
and transfer of anyone they
suspect of being involved...

690
00:52:43,185 --> 00:52:46,055
in terrorism to secret prisons
outside of the U.S.

691
00:52:46,085 --> 00:52:47,985
Alan,
Anwar is not a terrorist.

692
00:52:48,025 --> 00:52:50,155
- There's nothing extremist about him.
- I know.

693
00:52:50,195 --> 00:52:52,595
He coaches Jeremy's soccer team,
for Christ sakes.

694
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:53,615
What do you mean prison?

695
00:52:53,665 --> 00:52:55,225
Okay, but there
must be some reason...

696
00:52:55,265 --> 00:52:56,255
why they would take him.

697
00:52:56,295 --> 00:52:57,325
What reason?

698
00:53:00,705 --> 00:53:02,635
Did Anwar ever apply
for U.S. citizenship?

699
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:03,895
No.
But why is that important?

700
00:53:03,935 --> 00:53:06,535
He has a green card.
He pays his taxes.

701
00:53:07,575 --> 00:53:08,975
Alan, you know him.

702
00:53:10,115 --> 00:53:12,515
In fairness, Izzy,
I barely knew him.

703
00:53:14,955 --> 00:53:16,175
You knew him.

704
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:19,345
Okay.

705
00:53:20,355 --> 00:53:23,415
What I'm asking is that
the FBI checks him out.

706
00:53:23,455 --> 00:53:25,125
You have to promise me
they're not gonna find...

707
00:53:25,165 --> 00:53:26,385
anything unusual.

708
00:53:26,425 --> 00:53:28,825
A meeting he might have
attended, all right?

709
00:53:28,865 --> 00:53:31,766
A friend or an acquaintance
that's had some contact...

710
00:53:31,806 --> 00:53:34,136
any contact
with an extremist group.

711
00:53:34,166 --> 00:53:36,466
Uh, like a mosque he attends?

712
00:53:37,606 --> 00:53:39,406
Does he--
Does he even attend a mosque?

713
00:53:41,016 --> 00:53:42,176
You knew him.

714
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,036
He hasn't changed.

715
00:53:49,156 --> 00:53:50,586
Okay. I know.

716
00:53:51,786 --> 00:53:53,556
I had to ask.

717
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:33,587
Where were you?

718
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:36,087
Fatima,
what are you doing here?

719
00:54:36,437 --> 00:54:37,557
I was worried.

720
00:54:37,597 --> 00:54:40,067
You can't keep missing classes.

721
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,497
I was busy.

722
00:54:44,137 --> 00:54:45,437
You were busy.

723
00:54:45,877 --> 00:54:47,007
Don't.

724
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:49,137
Are you seeing another girl?

725
00:54:52,187 --> 00:54:53,177
No.

726
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:54,777
Then where were you?

727
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:56,407
- With Omar.
- Where?

728
00:54:56,457 --> 00:54:58,247
At his home. He has a problem.

729
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:00,917
I am his friend.

730
00:55:01,657 --> 00:55:02,687
Friend.

731
00:55:07,698 --> 00:55:09,358
I'm sorry.

732
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,428
I have to go.

733
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:15,498
Now?

734
00:55:15,738 --> 00:55:16,768
Stay here.

735
00:55:17,008 --> 00:55:18,168
No.

736
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,338
Please...

737
00:55:22,378 --> 00:55:23,978
stay with me.

738
00:55:26,188 --> 00:55:27,348
I'm sorry.

739
00:55:41,068 --> 00:55:42,758
Hello?

740
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,998
Hi.

741
00:55:46,738 --> 00:55:48,538
What did your friend say?

742
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,638
He's talking to somebody
very high up.

743
00:55:51,678 --> 00:55:53,978
He said
she probably knows something.

744
00:55:57,789 --> 00:55:58,809
Nuru?

745
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:00,979
Yes?

746
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,059
There's nothing I don't know,
is there?

747
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,689
What do you mean?

748
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,999
I mean,
back in Egypt when...

749
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:18,239
when he was younger.

750
00:56:19,669 --> 00:56:22,339
There's nobody
he would've known there with--

751
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,339
What?

752
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,879
Nothing.

753
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:32,819
- I'm sorry.
- Isabella.

754
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:36,179
I think maybe you
should come home...

755
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:38,749
before you put
the baby at risk.

756
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:42,019
- We can do things from here.
- So tired.

757
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,400
Why did Rashid call you?

758
00:57:33,081 --> 00:57:35,641
Why did Rashid call you?

759
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:40,941
Give him an answer, Anwar.

760
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,051
Give him an answer.

761
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:50,091
Leave us.

762
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:07,311
What are you doing?

763
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:10,381
It's not working.

764
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:14,781
He's not giving us
any answers.

765
00:58:17,591 --> 00:58:20,192
If he gives no answer...

766
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:23,032
then that's the answer
you put in your report.

767
00:58:24,032 --> 00:58:25,562
"He gave no answer."

768
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:29,902
Let me talk to him.

769
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:34,832
I wanna talk to him.

770
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,682
Ten minutes.

771
00:59:10,683 --> 00:59:12,343
Are you the American?

772
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:16,883
Uh-huh.

773
00:59:21,923 --> 00:59:23,293
Why are you here?

774
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:30,563
Just explain the phone calls,
and we can all go home.

775
00:59:30,603 --> 00:59:33,933
Tell me what to say.
I'll say it.

776
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:43,273
Do you have a family?

777
00:59:47,053 --> 00:59:49,523
I asked you a question.
Do you have a family?

778
00:59:55,524 --> 00:59:57,684
You son of a bitch,
why are you here?

779
01:00:00,694 --> 01:00:02,394
Won't you
take this off of me?

780
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:05,324
You fucking coward,
why don't you--

781
01:00:05,374 --> 01:00:06,834
Explain the phone calls.

782
01:00:14,784 --> 01:00:16,744
Explain the phone calls.

783
01:00:18,984 --> 01:00:21,714
I--I can't.

784
01:01:12,005 --> 01:01:13,065
Is Fatima here?

785
01:01:18,745 --> 01:01:19,765
There's...

786
01:01:21,615 --> 01:01:23,175
There's a problem, Abasi.

787
01:01:27,215 --> 01:01:29,345
I don't know where Fatima is.

788
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:34,886
But she was staying with you.

789
01:01:37,266 --> 01:01:38,526
I went away...

790
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:42,266
Away for work.

791
01:01:43,406 --> 01:01:44,566
You left her alone?

792
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:51,106
When was the last time
you saw her?

793
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:53,236
Six days ago.

794
01:01:53,746 --> 01:01:55,216
Six days ago?

795
01:01:57,646 --> 01:01:59,586
She's been seeing a boy.

796
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:03,256
She said he was a school friend.

797
01:02:03,926 --> 01:02:05,326
Just a friend.

798
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:07,386
What's his name?

799
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,396
I don't know if she's with him.

800
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:12,456
What's his name?

801
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:13,886
Khalid.

802
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:15,126
Khalid who?

803
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,696
I don't know his last name.

804
01:02:21,507 --> 01:02:22,907
I'm sorry.

805
01:02:45,797 --> 01:02:47,027
This is Douglas.

806
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:48,967
Douglas Freeman?

807
01:02:50,207 --> 01:02:53,227
That's right. Who is this?

808
01:02:53,277 --> 01:02:57,007
Corrine Whitman. Lee Mayers
speaks very highly of you.

809
01:02:57,047 --> 01:02:59,137
Oh, thank you.

810
01:02:59,177 --> 01:03:01,147
How are things progressing?

811
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:04,777
Uh, he's not cooperating.

812
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:08,748
Well, that's why he's there...

813
01:03:10,358 --> 01:03:12,158
so you can help along.

814
01:03:12,858 --> 01:03:15,958
I don't think that he has
any helpful information.

815
01:03:17,098 --> 01:03:19,258
Really?

816
01:03:19,298 --> 01:03:20,698
Well, I'm told otherwise.

817
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:23,128
I understand that.

818
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:27,138
Is your opinion shared
by Mr. Fawal?

819
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:31,578
Well, Mr. Fawal doesn't care
if he gets information.

820
01:03:31,618 --> 01:03:35,848
He-He-He-He'll just keep trying
to get information...

821
01:03:35,888 --> 01:03:37,008
whether he gets...

822
01:03:37,048 --> 01:03:40,748
- any information or not.
- Is this opinion shared by Mr. Fawal?

823
01:03:44,558 --> 01:03:46,428
No.

824
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:48,798
No. I see.

825
01:03:50,968 --> 01:03:53,398
You're new to this,
aren't ya?

826
01:03:54,698 --> 01:03:56,398
This is my first torture.

827
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:03,509
The United States
does not torture, Douglas.

828
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:06,169
Let me tell you something.
This is how this works.

829
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:08,079
You worry about getting
the information...

830
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:12,349
and I will worry whether the
information you get is helpful.

831
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:15,759
Okay? You focus on the job.

832
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,710
FBI and Interpol
have nothing.

833
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,650
He's been in and out
of the States a dozen times.

834
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,980
Conferences, lecture tours...

835
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,250
but Immigration has
never had a problem.

836
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,480
Could he be dirty?

837
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,180
Does it make any difference?

838
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,160
Hell, yes. Who's this?

839
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:24,520
Sharon Lopez, I think.

840
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,090
Mrs. Lopez, nice to see you.

841
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,390
Thank you so much for your
support on the micro loan bill.

842
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:29,420
My pleasure.

843
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,370
Look, the only point
you need to make...

844
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,271
is that he's disappeared without
any kind of judicial reviews.

845
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,031
So, then you'd like
to go public?

846
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:37,801
Absolutely.

847
01:05:37,841 --> 01:05:40,571
When this thing breaks, you'll
be on the right side of it.

848
01:05:43,111 --> 01:05:44,601
She's here.

849
01:05:49,351 --> 01:05:52,011
Alan, be nice.

850
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:03,771
Ms. Whitman.
Sorry. Forgive the interruption.

851
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:06,101
Alan Smith,
Senator Hawkins' office.

852
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:08,471
Oh. How is the senator?

853
01:06:09,171 --> 01:06:13,071
Flush. Approval's over 60.
Not a contender in sight.

854
01:06:13,111 --> 01:06:16,641
Oh, view must be great
from there.

855
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:20,611
I was wondering
if I might have a word with you.

856
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:23,342
Oh.

857
01:06:23,392 --> 01:06:24,982
Of course.

858
01:06:27,422 --> 01:06:30,662
Um, I'm inquiring about
a constituent's husband.

859
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:34,092
- Uh-huh.
- Anwar El-Ibrahim.

860
01:06:34,132 --> 01:06:36,462
Does that name sound familiar?

861
01:06:36,502 --> 01:06:39,332
No. I'm afraid it doesn't.

862
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:41,032
Egyptian?

863
01:06:41,912 --> 01:06:45,032
- Mr. Smith?
- Yeah.

864
01:06:45,082 --> 01:06:48,312
I'm afraid that this is not
the appropriate time or place...

865
01:06:48,342 --> 01:06:50,182
- to have this conversation.
- No, I apologize...

866
01:06:50,212 --> 01:06:53,512
but, um,
I called your office...

867
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:56,022
and I couldn't get an answer...

868
01:06:56,052 --> 01:06:57,882
and I don't really know
what I should do.

869
01:06:57,922 --> 01:07:00,722
Well, I gave you my answer.

870
01:07:00,762 --> 01:07:02,552
Name's not familiar to me.

871
01:07:03,532 --> 01:07:07,832
Um, what if the press
were to get a hold of this?

872
01:07:09,172 --> 01:07:13,503
They might say that a dedicated
family man, an NYU graduate...

873
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:15,833
has been detained
without any charges...

874
01:07:15,873 --> 01:07:17,533
without access to a lawyer...

875
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:20,343
- just swirled away to God knows where.
- Darlin'...

876
01:07:20,383 --> 01:07:22,403
before you launch
into your big speech...

877
01:07:22,453 --> 01:07:24,383
why don't you ask your boss...

878
01:07:24,413 --> 01:07:27,253
how badly he really does want
to stick his neck out...

879
01:07:27,283 --> 01:07:28,513
for a terrorist?

880
01:07:29,653 --> 01:07:32,643
Well, he might
for due process.

881
01:07:32,693 --> 01:07:34,523
Maybe I should have a copy
of the Constitution...

882
01:07:34,563 --> 01:07:36,253
sent to your office.

883
01:07:39,063 --> 01:07:41,033
What are you
taking issue with?

884
01:07:42,233 --> 01:07:45,223
The disappearance
of a particular man...

885
01:07:45,273 --> 01:07:47,743
or a national security policy?

886
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:51,533
You have him.

887
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:53,133
I didn't say that.

888
01:07:53,183 --> 01:07:55,303
Yeah. I'll say it.

889
01:07:55,353 --> 01:07:58,784
Mr. El-Ibrahim should be brought
back to the U.S.

890
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:02,684
If he's guilty, try him.
If not, let him go home.

891
01:08:02,724 --> 01:08:05,754
Honey,
this is nasty business.

892
01:08:06,794 --> 01:08:09,694
There are upwards
of 7,000 people...

893
01:08:09,734 --> 01:08:13,064
in central London
alive tonight...

894
01:08:13,104 --> 01:08:16,624
because of information
that we elicited just this way.

895
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:19,004
So maybe you can put your head
on your pillow...

896
01:08:19,044 --> 01:08:23,064
and feel proud for saving
one man while 7,000 perish.

897
01:08:23,114 --> 01:08:25,544
But I got grandkids
in London...

898
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:30,414
so I'm glad I'm doing this job,
and you're not.

899
01:08:30,454 --> 01:08:34,414
Unless your grandkid
is Anwar El-Ibrahim.

900
01:08:35,754 --> 01:08:38,724
Let me get a copy
of the 9/11 Commission report...

901
01:08:38,764 --> 01:08:40,814
over to your office
in the morning.

902
01:08:40,864 --> 01:08:42,294
You sleep well now.

903
01:08:55,315 --> 01:08:56,675
Khalid.

904
01:08:56,715 --> 01:08:57,735
Smile.

905
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:02,305
Wait, I want one with Fatima.

906
01:09:03,255 --> 01:09:04,945
Fatima. Come get in the picture.

907
01:09:05,385 --> 01:09:06,645
Smile.

908
01:09:07,385 --> 01:09:08,415
Brothers and sisters.

909
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:11,355
Sorry to stop the music.

910
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,795
I just need to make
a few points...

911
01:09:15,595 --> 01:09:18,155
before the march tomorrow.

912
01:09:18,835 --> 01:09:21,735
Remember, the streets
will be lined with police.

913
01:09:22,235 --> 01:09:25,035
We must remain calm.

914
01:09:26,505 --> 01:09:27,595
We will show the world...

915
01:09:29,245 --> 01:09:32,335
We will show the world
that we have had enough.

916
01:09:32,745 --> 01:09:34,336
That we won't take it anymore.

917
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:35,916
Enough!

918
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:37,406
Enough!

919
01:10:25,437 --> 01:10:26,457
Khalid!

920
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:27,827
Khalid!

921
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:33,667
Khalid!

922
01:10:33,947 --> 01:10:35,497
- Khalid!
- Omar!

923
01:10:35,977 --> 01:10:37,207
Omar!

924
01:10:54,767 --> 01:10:56,257
The boy's name
is Khalid El-Emin.

925
01:10:57,037 --> 01:10:58,397
Khalid El-Emin?

926
01:10:58,437 --> 01:11:00,067
I got it from the school.

927
01:11:00,967 --> 01:11:01,997
Father's in Paris.

928
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:03,467
Mother's dead.

929
01:11:03,937 --> 01:11:05,807
His brother, Fadil,
had multiple arrests.

930
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,467
We had him for a while.

931
01:11:10,477 --> 01:11:12,008
We let him go?

932
01:11:14,518 --> 01:11:16,988
He died.

933
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:29,128
Where's the boy?

934
01:11:29,738 --> 01:11:30,758
We don't know.

935
01:11:31,638 --> 01:11:33,398
We're trying to find
an address for him.

936
01:11:35,008 --> 01:11:37,268
Then why are you standing here
like an idiot?

937
01:11:37,478 --> 01:11:38,498
Go!

938
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:40,608
Find him!

939
01:11:41,478 --> 01:11:42,638
Move!

940
01:11:49,158 --> 01:11:50,818
Khalid, where are we going?

941
01:11:53,328 --> 01:11:54,488
Who is it?

942
01:11:54,528 --> 01:11:55,958
It's Khalid. They've taken Omar.

943
01:11:56,398 --> 01:11:57,558
Open, open.

944
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:01,719
They took Omar.

945
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:09,869
They took Omar.

946
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:17,239
Go in the kitchen
and boil some water.

947
01:12:18,519 --> 01:12:20,539
So we can clean him up.

948
01:12:44,879 --> 01:12:46,399
You should not have
brought her here.

949
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,720
What are we going to do
about her?

950
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,540
Leave her out of it.

951
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,420
I'm not going to her house.

952
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,590
You've got to understand,
she is not her father.

953
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:08,430
Then we will do it another way.

954
01:13:10,370 --> 01:13:11,390
They have Omar.

955
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:13,060
They will make him talk.

956
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:14,930
Over.

957
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,130
It is over.

958
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,900
Then...

959
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:27,280
we must do it now.

960
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,090
Remember your brother.

961
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:40,591
Remember your brother.

962
01:13:45,711 --> 01:13:46,691
She called you?

963
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:47,731
Yes, she did.

964
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:49,601
She didn't like the way you
approached her in public.

965
01:13:49,641 --> 01:13:51,771
Well, she wouldn't return
my calls.

966
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:53,901
Well, Alan,
she's not obliged to.

967
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:56,711
You have a personal stake
in this...

968
01:13:56,751 --> 01:13:59,341
so let me show you
what she gave me.

969
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:06,481
For a year,
NSA has been tracking calls...

970
01:14:06,531 --> 01:14:08,151
from Rashid Salimi.

971
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:10,861
Last week, a number they say
was one of his...

972
01:14:10,901 --> 01:14:12,891
was tracked connecting
to a cell phone...

973
01:14:12,931 --> 01:14:14,421
registered to your guy.

974
01:14:18,171 --> 01:14:20,761
- Salimi called Anwar?
- Maybe.

975
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:22,171
Maybe.
What do you mean "maybe?"

976
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:23,682
Did he contact him,
or didn't he?

977
01:14:23,712 --> 01:14:25,442
I said maybe.
You know these guys.

978
01:14:25,482 --> 01:14:27,042
They give away
their cell phones.

979
01:14:27,082 --> 01:14:28,072
They switch numbers.

980
01:14:28,112 --> 01:14:30,452
He could have passed the phone
to somebody related to Ibrahim.

981
01:14:30,482 --> 01:14:31,512
We don't know.

982
01:14:32,522 --> 01:14:33,952
Or somebody passed it on
to somebody...

983
01:14:33,992 --> 01:14:34,982
who passed it on
to somebody.

984
01:14:35,022 --> 01:14:36,752
- Who knows, right?
- Yeah. Who the fuck knows?

985
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:38,592
But there could be
a connection.

986
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:40,862
Now, you wanna bet your career
on something...

987
01:14:40,892 --> 01:14:41,992
that could go either way?

988
01:14:42,032 --> 01:14:43,092
I don't.

989
01:14:43,132 --> 01:14:45,122
We got a bill
we're trying to get passed.

990
01:14:45,162 --> 01:14:47,602
This business of yours
is just gonna muddy things up.

991
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:49,572
You wanna be the guy
who never has to compromise...

992
01:14:49,602 --> 01:14:51,802
then go join
Amnesty International.

993
01:14:51,842 --> 01:14:54,102
In this business here,
to get things done...

994
01:14:54,142 --> 01:14:55,842
you gotta give,
and you gotta take.

995
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:57,312
You got it?

996
01:14:57,342 --> 01:14:59,572
If we're gonna get
into a fight about rendition...

997
01:14:59,612 --> 01:15:01,812
it's gotta be the right fight
at the right time...

998
01:15:01,852 --> 01:15:04,412
and it's gotta be a watertight
case, and this ain't it!

999
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:08,652
But, listen.

1000
01:15:12,123 --> 01:15:14,223
I knew Anwar.

1001
01:15:14,263 --> 01:15:18,033
Okay? He was a solid guy.

1002
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:19,053
We'll, isn't that interesting?

1003
01:15:19,103 --> 01:15:22,403
That's exactly what they said
about Mohammad Atta in Hamburg.

1004
01:15:22,443 --> 01:15:23,703
You start
pushing this thing...

1005
01:15:23,743 --> 01:15:25,403
they're gonna scream
national security...

1006
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:26,433
at the top of their lungs...

1007
01:15:26,473 --> 01:15:28,573
and you and I are gonna be
called bin Laden lovers.

1008
01:15:28,613 --> 01:15:30,443
You want that? I don't!

1009
01:15:30,483 --> 01:15:32,443
Back off!

1010
01:15:32,483 --> 01:15:34,213
I got a meeting.

1011
01:15:56,973 --> 01:15:59,563
- Good morning.
- Morning, Samantha.

1012
01:16:00,844 --> 01:16:02,574
Alan, Isabella's here.

1013
01:16:03,044 --> 01:16:04,944
Can I get you a hot tea?

1014
01:16:04,984 --> 01:16:06,974
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

1015
01:16:10,224 --> 01:16:12,244
- Hi.
- Hey.

1016
01:16:12,284 --> 01:16:14,254
So, what's happening?

1017
01:16:15,594 --> 01:16:17,424
- Uh...
- What do you have?

1018
01:16:17,464 --> 01:16:19,484
Have a seat. Here.

1019
01:16:22,434 --> 01:16:24,124
Want some coffee?

1020
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:27,464
No. I can't drink coffee, Alan.

1021
01:16:30,574 --> 01:16:31,764
That's right.

1022
01:16:34,044 --> 01:16:36,574
What is it?

1023
01:16:36,614 --> 01:16:37,634
What do you have?

1024
01:16:40,484 --> 01:16:41,544
Okay.

1025
01:16:42,924 --> 01:16:44,444
You need a lawyer, Izzy.

1026
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:50,855
There is evidence that
Anwar has been in contact...

1027
01:16:50,895 --> 01:16:54,025
with a terrorist group
called El-Hazim.

1028
01:16:59,305 --> 01:17:00,775
What?

1029
01:17:01,975 --> 01:17:03,905
What evidence?

1030
01:17:05,145 --> 01:17:06,305
It's classified.

1031
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:08,535
Classified.
What does that mean?

1032
01:17:10,445 --> 01:17:13,215
That means
that I'm the wrong person...

1033
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:15,345
to be looking
into this for you.

1034
01:17:19,595 --> 01:17:24,495
Alan, I know everything
that you're doing for me...

1035
01:17:24,525 --> 01:17:26,795
and I'm sure
this must be hard for you.

1036
01:17:28,135 --> 01:17:29,595
I'm not naive.

1037
01:17:29,635 --> 01:17:31,265
Maybe I even expected the worst.

1038
01:17:31,305 --> 01:17:34,205
But please, please
don't let that happen.

1039
01:17:36,045 --> 01:17:39,136
Please don't be one of those
people who just turns away.

1040
01:17:40,716 --> 01:17:42,376
I'm sorry.

1041
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:45,716
There's just nothing else
I can do.

1042
01:18:10,206 --> 01:18:12,196
What is it
they say he's done?

1043
01:18:13,516 --> 01:18:14,566
I don't really know.

1044
01:18:14,616 --> 01:18:16,016
You don't know?

1045
01:18:16,686 --> 01:18:18,076
Well, who does know?

1046
01:18:18,116 --> 01:18:20,676
Because I need someone
to look me in the eye...

1047
01:18:20,716 --> 01:18:24,056
and tell me exactly
what it is they say he's done.

1048
01:18:26,897 --> 01:18:29,057
What has he done, Alan?!

1049
01:18:30,967 --> 01:18:32,517
That's the name
of a lawyer...

1050
01:18:32,567 --> 01:18:35,037
who really knows
his way around Washington.

1051
01:18:36,107 --> 01:18:38,067
You should take it, Izzy.

1052
01:18:56,027 --> 01:18:57,487
Isabella.

1053
01:19:01,357 --> 01:19:05,417
Tomorrow at 11:00,
she'll be here.

1054
01:19:08,397 --> 01:19:10,367
Thank you.

1055
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:42,928
Please.

1056
01:19:42,968 --> 01:19:46,338
Please! Please! God!
No more!

1057
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:50,568
I want to know what else
Rashid is planning.

1058
01:19:50,608 --> 01:19:52,408
I want names.
I want addresses.

1059
01:19:52,448 --> 01:19:54,378
I want to know
about future attacks.

1060
01:19:54,418 --> 01:19:56,008
Do you understand?

1061
01:20:03,959 --> 01:20:05,859
I don't know.

1062
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:13,599
If you died here today,
right now, who would miss you?

1063
01:20:17,839 --> 01:20:19,739
Your wife
would eventually remarry.

1064
01:20:19,779 --> 01:20:22,569
Your son would call
another man "father."

1065
01:20:23,509 --> 01:20:26,449
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

1066
01:20:36,059 --> 01:20:38,619
No, no. No, no, no, no.

1067
01:20:47,839 --> 01:20:50,460
Enough. Enough. Enough!

1068
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,140
This is my interrogation.

1069
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,420
You observe, Douglas,
nothing more.

1070
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:09,750
Put the gag on.

1071
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:21,270
- Put the gag on.
- No. No.

1072
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,640
No. No. No. No.
No. No. No. No.

1073
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:27,510
Wait! Wait! Wait!
He contacted me a year ago.

1074
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:40,951
Who contacted you?

1075
01:21:44,931 --> 01:21:46,721
Rashid.

1076
01:21:46,761 --> 01:21:47,791
How?

1077
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:51,301
He called me...

1078
01:21:52,331 --> 01:21:53,801
on my cell phone.

1079
01:21:58,071 --> 01:21:59,341
What? What did he want?

1080
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:02,671
Information.

1081
01:22:02,711 --> 01:22:04,871
What information?

1082
01:22:04,911 --> 01:22:09,041
Chemical composition
to increase explosive power.

1083
01:22:09,081 --> 01:22:11,081
- Did you give him that information?
- Yes.

1084
01:22:11,121 --> 01:22:12,821
Did you ever speak
with any of his aides?

1085
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,521
Yes.

1086
01:22:35,112 --> 01:22:36,702
Names.

1087
01:22:51,162 --> 01:22:52,962
Did he pay you?

1088
01:22:58,872 --> 01:23:00,062
How much?

1089
01:23:01,572 --> 01:23:03,202
Forty thousand.

1090
01:23:05,112 --> 01:23:06,472
Where is the money?

1091
01:23:06,512 --> 01:23:08,672
I haven't received it yet.

1092
01:23:08,712 --> 01:23:10,012
When was he
gonna give it to you?

1093
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:11,602
When I was in South Africa.

1094
01:23:11,652 --> 01:23:13,112
Why South Africa?

1095
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,943
I didn't want
a large amount of money...

1096
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,683
being wired to me in America.

1097
01:23:24,393 --> 01:23:26,423
Where is the money?

1098
01:23:26,463 --> 01:23:28,093
I don't know.

1099
01:23:29,163 --> 01:23:31,393
The courier didn't show up.

1100
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:39,543
Names.

1101
01:23:43,483 --> 01:23:44,953
Names.

1102
01:24:38,734 --> 01:24:41,794
Hey, it's the man of the hour.

1103
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:43,104
- Congratulations, Alan.
- Didn't I tell you?

1104
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:44,304
You beat 'em
on this one, huh?

1105
01:24:44,344 --> 01:24:45,474
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

1106
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:47,034
- A great day for us.
- Did I tell you?

1107
01:24:47,084 --> 01:24:48,744
- You told me.
- Congratulations.

1108
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:58,125
Come. I'm not going
to hurt you. Come.

1109
01:24:58,825 --> 01:24:59,985
Where?

1110
01:25:00,025 --> 01:25:02,585
To a bigger cell.

1111
01:25:24,885 --> 01:25:26,315
Come.

1112
01:27:12,997 --> 01:27:16,428
Do you know
what they will do to Omar?

1113
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:21,858
Do you?

1114
01:29:44,581 --> 01:29:46,811
Douglas,
it's 5:00 in the morning.

1115
01:29:48,621 --> 01:29:50,111
What is this?

1116
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:52,851
1990 Egyptian soccer team.

1117
01:29:53,861 --> 01:29:56,851
- I Googled it.
- Okay.

1118
01:29:56,901 --> 01:29:59,761
1990 is the year
Anwar left Egypt for America.

1119
01:29:59,801 --> 01:30:01,201
Those are the men
that he said were members...

1120
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:02,721
of the El-Hazim Brigade.

1121
01:30:02,771 --> 01:30:04,561
It's a fucking soccer team.

1122
01:30:05,601 --> 01:30:07,161
This is why you've got me
out of bed?

1123
01:30:07,211 --> 01:30:08,671
To show me he's a liar?

1124
01:30:11,511 --> 01:30:15,001
He said that--that Rashid
paid him $40,000.

1125
01:30:15,051 --> 01:30:18,141
- Well, that's a big incentive.
- He makes $200,000 a year.

1126
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:22,121
Why would somebody who--who
makes $200,000 a year...

1127
01:30:22,151 --> 01:30:26,321
risk his life and his family
for $40,000?

1128
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:31,492
We have a saying.
"Beat your woman every morning.

1129
01:30:31,532 --> 01:30:34,002
"If you don't know why,
she does."

1130
01:30:38,072 --> 01:30:39,832
I don't know what that means.

1131
01:30:39,872 --> 01:30:41,462
If you don't have
the stomach for this...

1132
01:30:41,512 --> 01:30:43,132
then you should ask
to be reassigned.

1133
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:45,512
Douglas, I can't help you.

1134
01:30:46,782 --> 01:30:49,252
We have a saying, too.
Do you know Shakespeare?

1135
01:30:50,822 --> 01:30:52,842
Of course,
I know Shakespeare.

1136
01:30:52,882 --> 01:30:55,112
"I fear you speak
upon the rack...

1137
01:30:55,152 --> 01:30:58,092
where men enforced
do speak anything."

1138
01:31:00,592 --> 01:31:01,792
Saeed.

1139
01:31:05,132 --> 01:31:08,292
In all the years
you've been doing this...

1140
01:31:08,332 --> 01:31:10,892
how often can you say...

1141
01:31:10,942 --> 01:31:14,462
that we've produced truly
legitimate intelligence?

1142
01:31:14,512 --> 01:31:15,532
Once?

1143
01:31:16,943 --> 01:31:19,313
Twice? Ten times?

1144
01:31:19,343 --> 01:31:20,743
I mean,
just give me a statistic.

1145
01:31:20,783 --> 01:31:21,773
Give me a number.

1146
01:31:21,813 --> 01:31:24,153
Give me--Give me
a fucking pie chart.

1147
01:31:24,183 --> 01:31:25,713
I love pie charts.

1148
01:31:27,553 --> 01:31:29,683
Anything. Anything
that outweighs the fact...

1149
01:31:29,723 --> 01:31:31,253
that if you torture
one person...

1150
01:31:31,293 --> 01:31:35,853
you create ten, a hundred,
a thousand new enemies.

1151
01:32:01,323 --> 01:32:03,453
What are you doing?

1152
01:32:03,493 --> 01:32:04,924
Those are his release forms.

1153
01:32:04,964 --> 01:32:05,954
Yes, I can see that.

1154
01:32:05,994 --> 01:32:07,934
I need you to sign them.

1155
01:32:09,534 --> 01:32:11,964
We brought him to you.

1156
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:14,124
He's my responsibility.

1157
01:32:16,274 --> 01:32:18,704
Now I'm asking you
to sign those.

1158
01:32:23,414 --> 01:32:27,074
Do you know
what this will mean for you?

1159
01:32:35,954 --> 01:32:38,514
- Morning.
- Good morning, Senator.

1160
01:33:08,795 --> 01:33:10,385
- Shall we go in?
- Mrs. Whitman.

1161
01:33:10,425 --> 01:33:12,125
Yes?

1162
01:33:13,765 --> 01:33:16,495
My name
is Isabella El-Ibrahimi.

1163
01:33:18,105 --> 01:33:19,395
I'm sorry.

1164
01:33:19,435 --> 01:33:22,375
My husband
is Anwar El-Ibrahimi.

1165
01:33:25,445 --> 01:33:28,845
Please,
just tell me where he is.

1166
01:33:31,215 --> 01:33:32,905
Please just
let me talk to him.

1167
01:33:32,945 --> 01:33:36,385
I have no information
on your husband, Mrs. Ibrahim.

1168
01:33:36,415 --> 01:33:39,255
Ma'am, I have a son.
He's six years old.

1169
01:33:39,285 --> 01:33:40,915
What do I tell our son?

1170
01:33:40,955 --> 01:33:42,586
I'm very sorry
for your distress.

1171
01:33:42,626 --> 01:33:45,116
I wish I could help you
with your problem...

1172
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:46,496
but I simply cannot.

1173
01:33:46,526 --> 01:33:48,226
My problem?

1174
01:33:48,266 --> 01:33:49,526
- My problem?!
- Young lady, if you'll just leave...

1175
01:33:49,566 --> 01:33:51,656
- your name and information--
- You have my name.

1176
01:33:51,706 --> 01:33:53,066
You have my home address.

1177
01:33:53,106 --> 01:33:54,766
You have my phone number.

1178
01:33:54,806 --> 01:33:56,296
- You have everything.
- Let's go.

1179
01:33:56,336 --> 01:33:58,466
You have my husband!

1180
01:33:58,506 --> 01:34:00,446
Please don't walk away from me!

1181
01:34:00,476 --> 01:34:02,746
Just tell me where he is!

1182
01:34:02,776 --> 01:34:06,576
- Ma'am.
- Just tell me he's okay!

1183
01:34:06,616 --> 01:34:08,446
- Ma'am.
- Just--Stop!

1184
01:34:08,486 --> 01:34:10,956
Take your hands off me.

1185
01:34:13,326 --> 01:34:14,686
God damn it.

1186
01:34:41,187 --> 01:34:42,657
Oh!

1187
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:46,017
Are you okay?

1188
01:34:55,197 --> 01:34:57,497
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

1189
01:34:59,707 --> 01:35:00,697
Douglas?

1190
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:03,507
I'm sorry to call you so early.
I need your help.

1191
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:06,677
Okay, can you meet me
at my place in an hour?

1192
01:35:10,117 --> 01:35:11,237
Okay.

1193
01:35:11,287 --> 01:35:12,947
Thanks.

1194
01:35:27,768 --> 01:35:28,858
Hello.

1195
01:35:28,898 --> 01:35:30,528
Sorry to wake you, sir.

1196
01:35:31,338 --> 01:35:32,898
We have someone
who knows your daughter.

1197
01:35:33,468 --> 01:35:35,028
Omar Adnan.

1198
01:35:35,508 --> 01:35:38,098
He was arrested
by the riot squad last week.

1199
01:35:38,748 --> 01:35:40,648
He knows where the boy lives.

1200
01:36:16,519 --> 01:36:18,449
Khalid?

1201
01:36:45,079 --> 01:36:47,139
We're releasing El-Ibrahimi.

1202
01:36:47,179 --> 01:36:48,439
Tell them I'm coming down.

1203
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,470
Hey.

1204
01:38:11,631 --> 01:38:13,121
Put on the clothes.
We're leaving.

1205
01:38:19,911 --> 01:38:21,471
Put on the clothes.

1206
01:39:03,682 --> 01:39:05,212
Come on.

1207
01:39:48,433 --> 01:39:51,403
<i>I do this in memory</i>
<i>of my brother.</i>

1208
01:39:58,643 --> 01:40:00,113
Come on.

1209
01:41:42,085 --> 01:41:43,416
Wait.

1210
01:41:46,486 --> 01:41:49,046
Okay.
I want you to keep moving.

1211
01:41:49,086 --> 01:41:50,746
- I just want you to keep walking, okay?
- No, no--

1212
01:41:50,796 --> 01:41:52,726
Just keep walking.

1213
01:41:52,756 --> 01:41:53,746
You do what I say.

1214
01:41:53,796 --> 01:41:55,286
Keep walking.

1215
01:41:59,166 --> 01:42:00,926
I gave you
the release forms, okay?

1216
01:42:00,966 --> 01:42:02,956
They're signed by
the Minister of the Interior.

1217
01:42:03,006 --> 01:42:04,666
Now, open the gate.

1218
01:42:06,236 --> 01:42:08,076
- Mr. Abasi--
- Open the gate!

1219
01:42:57,057 --> 01:43:01,257
They overload these donkeys
and cause accidents. Chaos.

1220
01:43:01,297 --> 01:43:02,317
Tea, please.

1221
01:43:02,367 --> 01:43:03,557
Okay.

1222
01:43:11,737 --> 01:43:13,727
Ahmid, what's goin' on?

1223
01:43:13,777 --> 01:43:15,677
Accident, sir.

1224
01:43:16,947 --> 01:43:18,567
Fuckin' traffic, man.

1225
01:43:39,798 --> 01:43:41,168
Khalid!

1226
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:44,338
Khalid!

1227
01:43:45,978 --> 01:43:47,138
Khalid!

1228
01:43:50,878 --> 01:43:52,278
Khalid!

1229
01:43:52,318 --> 01:43:53,308
Khalid!

1230
01:43:53,348 --> 01:43:54,438
Khalid!

1231
01:44:01,788 --> 01:44:03,048
Khalid!

1232
01:44:14,869 --> 01:44:15,959
Why is he stopping?

1233
01:44:27,749 --> 01:44:29,689
Please, he's my father.

1234
01:44:31,489 --> 01:44:33,479
Khalid, please.

1235
01:44:36,829 --> 01:44:38,449
Please.

1236
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:42,529
Please.

1237
01:44:47,469 --> 01:44:49,939
He's not going to do it.

1238
01:44:54,879 --> 01:44:57,140
Take him out.

1239
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:06,590
Take him out.

1240
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:18,290
Khalid!

1241
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:23,740
Khalid!

1242
01:46:10,391 --> 01:46:11,511
Let's go, huh?

1243
01:46:19,401 --> 01:46:21,861
Come on. Come on.

1244
01:46:51,562 --> 01:46:54,052
When did he die?

1245
01:46:54,932 --> 01:46:57,372
God's will.

1246
01:47:00,442 --> 01:47:02,272
When?

1247
01:47:06,312 --> 01:47:08,072
A week ago.

1248
01:47:11,422 --> 01:47:13,882
They were just children.

1249
01:47:55,193 --> 01:47:57,023
Yes.
Is this <i>The Washington Post?</i>

1250
01:47:58,333 --> 01:47:59,923
Yeah.

1251
01:47:59,963 --> 01:48:01,733
Yeah, I'll hold.

1252
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:05,403
- Did you get that stuff?
- Yeah.

1253
01:48:11,384 --> 01:48:13,214
Thank you.

1254
01:48:16,884 --> 01:48:19,944
Yeah. Um, could you connect me
to Editorial, please?

1255
01:50:12,306 --> 01:50:14,206
Here's your passport
and green card.

1256
01:50:16,406 --> 01:50:18,566
Captain's name is Walna.

1257
01:50:18,606 --> 01:50:20,136
He'll take you to Malaga...

1258
01:50:20,176 --> 01:50:23,236
then you'll fly to Madrid,
connect to Chicago.

1259
01:50:25,446 --> 01:50:27,346
Don't talk to anybody.

1260
01:50:27,386 --> 01:50:30,376
Don't say anything
until you're back in the States.

1261
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:35,387
Get on the boat.

1262
01:50:51,177 --> 01:50:52,507
Go.

1263
01:50:53,747 --> 01:50:55,147
Go!

1264
01:51:01,457 --> 01:51:02,617
What the fuck are you doing?

1265
01:51:02,657 --> 01:51:04,087
I just got a call
from the consulate.

1266
01:51:04,117 --> 01:51:05,147
Do you have him?

1267
01:51:06,287 --> 01:51:07,317
No.

1268
01:51:07,357 --> 01:51:09,327
What do you mean no?!
Where the fuck is he?!

1269
01:51:09,357 --> 01:51:10,347
Douglas, listen to me!

1270
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:12,157
You are making
a big mistake here!

1271
01:51:12,197 --> 01:51:16,257
And whatever it is that you
think you're doing, stop now.

1272
01:51:18,467 --> 01:51:19,997
Douglas, lis--

1273
01:51:57,778 --> 01:51:59,268
I hear you.
I have to call you back.

1274
01:51:59,308 --> 01:52:00,298
I didn't know
if I should answer it.

1275
01:52:00,348 --> 01:52:02,678
It's all right.
I'm going to get it.

1276
01:52:12,629 --> 01:52:14,649
I don't want that.

1277
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:25,269
Corrine Whitman.

1278
01:53:21,230 --> 01:53:22,290
Hi, Daddy.

1279
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,160
Hi there.
