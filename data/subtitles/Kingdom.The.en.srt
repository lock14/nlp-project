1
00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:02,330
<i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,865
<i>Defeated at Ethandun,
Earl Guthrum was baptised</i>

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:08,810
<i>and became King
Aethelstan of East Anglia.</i>

4
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:14,201
<i>While in Wessex, Aethelwold still sees
himself as the true heir to the throne.</i>

5
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:15,637
I see it as a king would see it.

6
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:18,021
<i>Yet, King Alfred has other plans.</i>

7
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:19,259
I am to be married?

8
00:00:19,294 --> 00:00:21,730
A permanent bond between
Wessex and Mercia.

9
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:24,277
Which one of you is Aethelred?

10
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:27,192
<i>Alfred forced me to renew my allegiance.</i>

11
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,522
<i>He sent me to kill the Northmen
brothers, Erik and Sigefrid.</i>

12
00:00:30,557 --> 00:00:31,791
Argh! Aah!

13
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:34,634
<i>After taking Sigefrid's
hand, I banished them.</i>

14
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,444
You will take one ship and
you will leave Northumbria.

15
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:39,223
- You will not return.
- I swear.

16
00:00:39,524 --> 00:00:43,353
<i>And at last, in Northumbria, I
took my revenge against Kjartan</i>

17
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:47,753
<i>and his son, Sven, freeing
my enslaved sister, Thyra.</i>

18
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,113
Let me help you.

19
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,613
<i>Having defeated the Danes,
I married my love, Gisela.</i>

20
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,963
<i>And now all seems quiet.</i>

21
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,634
<i>But for a warrior there
can never be peace.</i>

22
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,973
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

23
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,200
_

24
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:14,072
_

25
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:20,774
We're here.

26
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:22,884
Ground herahead.

27
00:01:23,855 --> 00:01:25,134
And be ready.

28
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:47,753
She says she loves me.

29
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,664
- I swear! She says she loves me.
- She would.

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,123
Sihtric, she's a whore.

31
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:59,204
- No! She's past that.
- What she loves is your silver.

32
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:00,521
Is that the name of his cock?

33
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:04,073
I wish to marry her.

34
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:07,313
And I wish you to kill
Danes and survive the night.

35
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:09,563
We're the only chance
the villagers have.

36
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,153
They have begun.

37
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:34,454
Elgin, pass me the flask.

38
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:38,293
Ah...

39
00:02:49,034 --> 00:02:52,644
If you wish to live, boy, take
your hand away from your sword.

40
00:02:59,064 --> 00:03:00,563
Yah! Aah!

41
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,503
There will be no more than 30 raiders.

42
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,503
We hide and we wait.

43
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:14,764
We attack on my command, not before.

44
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:17,204
You all heard the Lord. We find cover.

45
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:21,283
Keep them moving.

46
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,593
Be quiet, woman!

47
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,943
Don't look at me!

48
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,253
Come on, come on! Stay together.

49
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,973
That's enough. You're
alive, girl, be thankful.

50
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:38,163
Elgin! Elgin, get up!

51
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:44,204
You can help rope the
prisoners. And keep them quiet!

52
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:49,743
Elgin!

53
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:54,563
Are you drunk?

54
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:55,853
Now!

55
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,144
We kill every bastard one of them!

56
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:02,913
To arms! Defend yourselves!

57
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,554
Run! Argh!

58
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,524
What's your name?

59
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,264
Her name is Aethelflaed, Lord.

60
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:55,233
- You're her mother?
- No, Lord.

61
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:06,293
King Alfred...

62
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:10,653
He has a daughter named Aethelflaed.

63
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:12,153
She's strong and brave.

64
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:16,113
You will need to be the same.

65
00:05:21,574 --> 00:05:24,384
Go back to your village
and take care of your dead.

66
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:28,983
Finan?

67
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:32,824
Hang three of the dead from the
trees... visible from the river.

68
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:33,814
Lord.

69
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:37,600
Take back what belongs to you.

70
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,014
You're safe now.

71
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:43,754
You will go back to your rat's nest

72
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:46,704
and tell anyone who cares to listen...

73
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:49,793
Beyond Lunden, the River
Temes belongs to Alfred.

74
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:54,433
And it's guarded by
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

_

77
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,920
Now there's a welcome sight...

78
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,740
My wife and my boy!

79
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,540
Whoa! Oh-ho! I think we
might be feeding you too much.

80
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,930
Don't forget your
daughter, she's here too.

81
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,379
- It went well?
- It did, not a scratch.

82
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,819
You have a visitor.

83
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:22,990
He has been here all night.

84
00:07:30,821 --> 00:07:32,459
Aethelwold.

85
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:35,090
How much of my ale have you drunk?

86
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,259
Not a cup.

87
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:40,810
Not a drop of ale has passed
my lips for ten days or more.

88
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,069
You've been ill?

89
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:44,319
Not ill, but... sober.

90
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,860
Which, as you know, is unlike me.

91
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,970
But it is important that
you accept that I am sober.

92
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,579
Say what you're here to say,
you have waited long enough.

93
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,279
The dead speak.

94
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,439
I have seen it, heard
it and the dead speak.

95
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,470
The dead?

96
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:12,500
A corpse.

97
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,279
I saw him rise from his grave and speak.

98
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,110
And what did this corpse say?

99
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,110
Well, what he said concerns us
both, us all, hence my visit,

100
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,689
and what I tell you are his
words, not mine, you understand?

101
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,860
And what did he say?

102
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,470
That I should be King.

103
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,129
No, believe me, it is true.

104
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,090
He said that I should be King of Wessex

105
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:37,909
and that you, you should be a king too.

106
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,659
He said that you, Uhtred,
will be crowned King of Mercia.

107
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,517
Bjorn heard it through
the three spinners.

108
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,918
Bjorn?

109
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,860
That is his name.

110
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:57,360
He is a Dane?

111
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,029
A dead Dane, yes. And
therefore, a good Dane.

112
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,269
We are royalty, you and l.

113
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,000
I have done my utmost to serve Alfred,

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,350
but with no reward, no
respon... Where are you going?

115
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,460
To wash the blood off
my hands and then to bed!

116
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:14,190
Do you not believe me?

117
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:15,830
Where did you see this corpse?

118
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,110
Mercia. Beyond Watling Street.

119
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,850
You crossed into Daneland?

120
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,549
I went to the part of Mercia that
Alfred gifted to the Danes, yes.

121
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:27,460
You happened to wander
across Watling Street?

122
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:30,179
I was sent for! I was invited!
And the same will happen to you.

123
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,240
I know what I saw.

124
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,799
You will be a queen.

125
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,820
I may not wish to be a queen.

126
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,870
When Bjorn is ready to speak,
there will be a messenger.

127
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,269
Tell me...

128
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,320
Do you wish Alfred harm?

129
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:04,820
No. No, of course not.

130
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,350
I mean, I wish him dead,
but I would not harm him.

131
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,740
I know what I saw.

132
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:23,950
I will not outstay my welcome.

133
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,399
Thank you for your kindness.

134
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,210
You are sworn to Alfred.

135
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,950
To become King of Mercia you
would need to break that oath.

136
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,259
If that is my fate.

137
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,399
Then you believe he speaks the truth?

138
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,759
No, I do not.

139
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,259
But I know he's not telling lies.

140
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,789
The truth is another matter.

141
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:11,289
We do not want an enemy such as Alfred.

142
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,730
And Alfred will not
want an enemy like me.

143
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:18,470
There appears to be good progress, Lord.

144
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:21,330
The people of Coccham
seem to be in good spirits.

145
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,759
- It would appear so.
- Welcome, Lord King.

146
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,169
We shall see.

147
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:27,750
Lord King.

148
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,730
Open the gates!

149
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:43,029
- Finan.
- What?

150
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,500
Lord King! Welcome to Coccham.

151
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,629
Finan.

152
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,919
Lord Uhtred is at the
fortress, the burh.

153
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,309
Would you fetch him, Finan?
We'll be waiting in the hall.

154
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,669
I will, Lord.

155
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:02,159
The man must have a priest
for each day of the year.

156
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,169
God be with you.

157
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,409
Lord, we are crossing into Wessex.

158
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:19,879
This stretch of river is
protected by Lord Uhtred.

159
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,610
You say you have trade there?

160
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,779
I do, Lord.

161
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,600
Lord, please, I cannot
risk losing my ship.

162
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,960
You will KEEP your ship.

163
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,860
It's easy enough to say it.

164
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,080
It is a pagan's hall.

165
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,580
Lord, you say the same
every time we visit.

166
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:59,120
Uhtred IS a pagan, as is his hall.

167
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,980
I find it annoying
that he will not grow.

168
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,159
He insists upon clinging
to these ancient beliefs.

169
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,710
The beliefs of our forefathers.

170
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:07,980
Who knew no better.

171
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:10,409
Lord King.

172
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,490
- Refreshment.
- Thank you, Gisela.

173
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,559
I, uh... I trust you are well?

174
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:22,320
I am, Lord, and better for your visit.

175
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:23,909
The ale is freshly brewed.

176
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,039
Ah! Excellent.

177
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,200
You are content in Wessex, I hope?

178
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:31,469
I am, Lord.

179
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,239
I am well, my family are well,

180
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,489
and there's peace, this is all I ask.

181
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,099
And what of you? Are you content?

182
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,849
My daughter is now old enough and
will soon be gifted in marriage,

183
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,879
I am...

184
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,336
apprehensive.

185
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:49,239
Aethelflaed is a sweet girl.

186
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,629
- She is.
- You are fond of her suitor, Lord?

187
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:53,918
Aethelred.

188
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,219
He serves a purpose. He is godly.

189
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,879
Well, we look forward to the
wedding celebrations in Winchester.

190
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,219
And I wish her... happiness.

191
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,068
The purpose of marriage is
not to be happy, my dear.

192
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,538
Then I am fortunate.

193
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,938
I pray my own wife might say the same!

194
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,798
Oh, I imagine she does,
Odda, she so rarely sees you.

195
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,288
Lord King. Lord Odda.

196
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,239
Steapa, my friend.

197
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,219
Uhtred, you do not deserve
such a charming wife.

198
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,519
Oh, I can only agree, Lord.

199
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,859
I was not expecting you,
there's been no message.

200
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,509
I'm hearing you've hanged a man.

201
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,408
I hanged many men just
lately. Raiders, Danes...

202
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,078
And already dead, Lord.

203
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,739
I'm speaking of a Saxon man,
a man of Coccham, of Wessex.

204
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,509
- That is why you're here?
- Amongst other concerns.

205
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,649
That man was a thief,
Lord. Sinful to the bone.

206
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,259
You hanged him without trial.

207
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,379
He was guilty. Three times over.

208
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,298
It is the purpose of a
trial to determine guilt.

209
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,089
People must witness justice being done.

210
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,369
Then I shall arrange a trial.

211
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,379
It's a little bit late for that, I fear.

212
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:09,678
Has there been a complaint, Lord?

213
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,208
There are laws, carefully written laws.

214
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,739
If you wish to remain an
ealdorman, you will adhere to them.

215
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,599
You shall not impose your
pagan ideals within my kingdom.

216
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,278
We are west of Watling Street, not east.

217
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,948
Yes, Lord.

218
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,489
We do not cross over into Daneland,

219
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,869
we do not cross over into Danelaw,
in mind, nor body, norspirit.

220
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,899
No, Lord.

221
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,849
My nephew... Aethelwold, he was, uh...

222
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,979
Well, he was seen doing just that.

223
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,418
Leaving Wessex, crossing
through Mercia from west to east.

224
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:42,448
Are you aware of this?

225
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:45,639
I am not.

226
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,499
When Aethelwold was here,

227
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,609
he mentioned nothing of
crossing into Daneland.

228
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,818
Hm, what did he mention?

229
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,229
He mentioned you, Lord,
and how you took his crown.

230
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,668
Aethelwold is permanently idle.

231
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:00,869
My advice is the same
as it has always been -

232
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,259
you should put him on
trial and then kill him.

233
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,869
Should the devil begin
to whisper in his ear,

234
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,278
then I may have no choice.

235
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,909
Besides the man you strung up,

236
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,108
how many of the raiders did you kill?

237
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,078
We killed about 30 men in total.

238
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,628
They had sacked a village.

239
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,378
- Which was in Mercia.
- Lord, we hear the screams at night.

240
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,459
Mercia is weak. Its people have
no protection from the Danes.

241
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,848
Mercia is disorganised
and that will change.

242
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,439
There will be burhs.

243
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,648
What is that?

244
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,659
That structure there?

245
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,209
It's a place for prayer, Lord.

246
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,048
A church, Uhtred?

247
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:43,159
Not quite, Lord. it's... a
shack, with a cross attached.

248
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,298
If it is for the purpose of
prayer, then it is a church.

249
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,509
Lord! A ship is near.

250
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:50,848
Traders.

251
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:54,598
Perhaps you'd like a
moment to pray, Lord?

252
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,368
I'll need to watch the trader.

253
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,939
Yes. Yes, I would like that.

254
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:11,989
Lord!

255
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,088
I was just thinking about you.

256
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,949
You were in my prayers, is what I mean.

257
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,068
Thank you, Hild.

258
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,808
Please continue, do not
let me disturb your peace.

259
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:27,878
Would you care to sit
with me? In peace, Lord?

260
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,378
I would, Hild. I will.

261
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,419
May I ask...?

262
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:49,259
Have you found your lasting peace?

263
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,709
I am near, Lord.

264
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,759
I feel more content here
with God than with my sword.

265
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,669
Courage without the sword
is the more difficult path.

266
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,868
It must, in time, become the only path.

267
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,929
I pray you find your
peace sooner than I.

268
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,979
Thank you, Lord.

269
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,028
You, stay with the ship.

270
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,618
Godwine, I was expecting you days ago.

271
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:25,548
Are you carrying the axe heads?

272
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:30,088
I am, Lord, Frankia-made.
Would split an oak tree.

273
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:32,009
- How many?
- How many do you need?

274
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,009
My man saw warriors aboard your ship.

275
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,368
Is this true?

276
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,358
Three men only, Lord. It is a Northman.

277
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,528
He wishes to speak with you. Alone.

278
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:54,749
Can I trust this Northman?

279
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,999
He says that you know him.

280
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,208
His name is Erik, he
has a brother, Sigefrid.

281
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,708
Finan... First sign of
trouble, fire the ship.

282
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:07,127
There'll be no need for fire, Lord.

283
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,678
Sihtric, fetch me a
whole bunch of torches.

284
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,988
I like to be prepared.

285
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:28,087
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

286
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:33,198
Here you are, lost in Wessex once again.

287
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:36,337
I am sworn to King Alfred.

288
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,317
That is why I am here...

289
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:42,897
Why are you here?

290
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:45,198
I'm not looking to fight.

291
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,837
Not yet.

292
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:49,927
Can you believe I'm travelling
to meet with a dead man?

293
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:51,057
You deal in sorcery now?

294
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:53,397
It is my fate, or so I'm told.

295
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:57,387
You have my word that I will
make my appointment in Mercia

296
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:00,198
and then I shall return to Frankia.

297
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,417
Sigefrid is in Frankia?

298
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,617
He is, but not for much longer.
My brother is... restless.

299
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:09,857
We have grown strong in
the years since Northumbria.

300
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,758
We have a fleet now. 19 ships.

301
00:21:13,888 --> 00:21:15,998
Which you will sail to where?

302
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:20,167
Oh, we have no firm plan,
other than to listen to Bjorn.

303
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:21,337
The dead man.

304
00:21:21,338 --> 00:21:23,867
You say it without surprise, Uhtred.

305
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:26,077
I think you might have
gotten wind of this ghost.

306
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,327
He speaks the words
of the three spinners,

307
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,337
we cannot ignore him.

308
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:32,728
- "We"?
- You and l.

309
00:21:32,729 --> 00:21:36,438
After his defeat at Ethandun,
the Earl Guthrum rejected our gods

310
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,657
and they are angry.

311
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,698
They want a revenge.

312
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:43,748
I believe we have been chosen.

313
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,468
You will receive your invitation,

314
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:51,387
you shall see for yourself, I'm sure.

315
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:54,857
What if I refuse to
meet with this ghost?

316
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:57,768
That is a matter for the
three spinners and the gods.

317
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:02,357
And what if I believe
this ghost to be a trap?

318
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:05,127
To be Sigefrid, wanting to kill me?

319
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:09,347
You have my word that
it is not. I swear.

320
00:22:09,348 --> 00:22:13,278
All that we want is Uhtred
of Bebbanburg at our side.

321
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:17,498
Now, am I allowed to pass
to keep my own appointment?

322
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:20,637
You are.

323
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,928
Safe journey.

324
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,839
All the way back to Frankia.

325
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,240
Uhtred Ragnarson...

326
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,847
You will always have my respect.

327
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,038
But do not forget you
were raised as a Dane.

328
00:22:52,568 --> 00:22:54,347
The broth was suitable, Lord?

329
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:56,827
- Mm, the broth was a delight, Gisela.
- As is the ale.

330
00:22:56,828 --> 00:22:59,837
You should moderate, Odda, you have
a ladder to climb to find your bed.

331
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,337
You can always be carried, Lord.

332
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,298
It wouldn't be the first time!

333
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,877
And I guarantee it
won't be the last time.

334
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:09,018
Lord, you make me out to be a drunk.

335
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:12,397
Though my head will be sore
in the morning, I know it.

336
00:23:12,398 --> 00:23:15,397
Well, then, it's ale for
breakfast, Lord! The only cure!

337
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:22,057
Was my nephew drunk
when he was here last?

338
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:27,587
Aethelwold is often drunk, Lord.

339
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:29,597
But this last time, he
did not touch a drop.

340
00:23:29,598 --> 00:23:31,948
He mentioned he had been sober for days,

341
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,208
which came as a surprise.

342
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:35,317
- That's a miracle!
- Not quite.

343
00:23:35,318 --> 00:23:38,228
Aethelwold is not a complete fool, Lord.

344
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:41,137
If he's idle, then could he
not help bring order to Mercia?

345
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:46,198
- He fought well at Ethandun.
- As he is fond of reminding people.

346
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,778
He's as good a man as Aethelred.

347
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:51,028
Uhtred, you speak of matters
you do not understand,

348
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:52,758
matters that do not concern you.

349
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:54,728
The safety of Wessex concerns me.

350
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:56,137
I'm happy to hear you say it.

351
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:57,867
Which is why we killed
the raiders, Lord.

352
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:59,837
Raiders who once
belonged to Earl Guthrum.

353
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,147
His name is now King Aethelstan.

354
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,117
That has been his name
since he became a Christian.

355
00:24:03,118 --> 00:24:04,478
Regardless of what he is called,

356
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:06,448
it's his men who now break the peace.

357
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,647
- You are sure of this?
- I am.

358
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:11,647
They gather at the mouth of
the Temes river at Beamfleot.

359
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:14,367
It's true, Lord. 200
or more, we've seen it.

360
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:16,008
And the number grows.

361
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:19,008
If these rogues are Aethelstan's
men, then they are his worry.

362
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,117
Until they decide to
blockade the river, Lord.

363
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:24,218
Then Wessex will be starved of trade.

364
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:26,508
- Aethelstan shall deal with them.
- He must kill them.

365
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:28,057
I believe WE must kill them.

366
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:30,218
What we must do is hold the peace.

367
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,448
War cannot always be the answer.

368
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:38,278
Lord, forgive me, but you speak of
matters YOU do not fully understand.

369
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,577
These men will not listen to Aethelstan

370
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:43,107
and Aethelstan will not deal with them.

371
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,468
For now, they are rogues,

372
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:46,018
but should they find a lord to serve,

373
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,188
then they will become an army.

374
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,198
So answer me this. Where
might this lord come from?

375
00:24:49,199 --> 00:24:51,218
Do I know of him?

376
00:24:51,219 --> 00:24:52,667
Should I fear him?

377
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:57,407
You can be sure he will
not be called Uhtred, Lord,

378
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:58,667
if that is your meaning.

379
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,597
My advice, Lord, is to send
ships and men to Beamfleot.

380
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,347
We shall maintain the peace.

381
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,458
They say it is an honour
to have the King stay,

382
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,428
but his men and his
priests have eaten almost

383
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:31,298
a winter's worth of food.

384
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:34,488
Uhtred, how can you serve a
man who doesn't see your value?

385
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:39,038
Oh, he sees it, but his god
won't allow him to embrace it.

386
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,998
He dislikes me more by the day.

387
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:44,377
Then you should ask
him to release you...

388
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:47,188
and we will go north.

389
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:48,788
To my brother and to Ragnar.

390
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:53,518
I am content here, but we
cannot become an enemy of Alfred.

391
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:00,597
Lord!

392
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:05,048
Hild. You look fearsome.

393
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:06,788
I think I preferred you with a sword.

394
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:08,288
Ah, my sword has become heavy.

395
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:10,768
But you could probably kill
someone with that, though.

396
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,877
I need to speak to you plainly.

397
00:26:17,568 --> 00:26:21,127
I would like to build a house,
a nunnery, here in Coccham,

398
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:24,268
but with your permission and
that of the bishop, of course.

399
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:26,847
The time is the right time.

400
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:31,728
You have my permission, no question.

401
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:33,228
Thank you.

402
00:26:33,229 --> 00:26:34,867
And you have my protection.

403
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:37,397
Always.

404
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,167
Abbess Hild.

405
00:26:43,449 --> 00:26:46,208
You will always be too
good a woman for God alone.

406
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:51,416
Alfred will be pleased.

407
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:02,048
_

408
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:04,967
Stow the oars! Make her secure.

409
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,247
- And, Haesten...
- Lord?

410
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:11,017
- Ensure the ships are guarded well.
- Yes, Lord.

411
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:20,576
The fortress of Beamfleot.

412
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:22,497
And all the men inside.

413
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:23,957
They are ours now.

414
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:27,096
Even the air is rich here.

415
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,896
Lunden is how far up river?

416
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:32,997
Half a day, with the tide.

417
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:35,817
We take it at the earliest.

418
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:36,797
And Uhtred?

419
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,326
As we planned.

420
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:57,868
_

421
00:27:57,897 --> 00:27:59,866
Looking forward to the wedding, Father?

422
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:02,676
I am. I am, Father Beocca.

423
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:05,396
I enjoy a wedding as
much as the next drunkard.

424
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,567
And how is your own
lady, Father, the Dane?

425
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,846
Thyra? She is not my lady.

426
00:28:12,847 --> 00:28:14,727
She's well.

427
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:17,537
She is something of a strange beauty.

428
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:21,196
Yes. She's, uh... She's...

429
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:22,317
Yes.

430
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:25,317
I inform God each evening how
much I miss the company of a woman.

431
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:27,196
He sends me nothing.

432
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:32,166
We talk, Thyra and l.
She's a pleasant woman.

433
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:38,257
There is no finer sight than that
of a naked woman, arms outstretched.

434
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:41,329
Almost there.

435
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,747
Lord? Lord?

436
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:45,387
Beocca, come in.

437
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:51,106
- Father Pyrlig.
- Good day, Lord.

438
00:28:51,107 --> 00:28:53,636
I read of nothing but
skirmishes and raids.

439
00:28:54,857 --> 00:28:57,007
What kind of a place must Daneland be?

440
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:59,257
- Sinful, Lord.
- Without question.

441
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:02,217
They aspire only to kill and fornicate.

442
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,977
Lord, are we to wait?

443
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:06,057
For a moment.

444
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:07,747
Lady Aelswith.

445
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,946
Lady, I'm begging your
pardon for my somewhat

446
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,106
colourful description of life as a Dane.

447
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:14,727
We are prepared, Lord.

448
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:21,477
- Father Pyrlig, I have a task for you.
- Lord.

449
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:23,586
You are familiar with
East Anglia, are you not?

450
00:29:23,587 --> 00:29:26,586
I am, Lord, a land of
quite unremarkable beauty.

451
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:28,186
You are to go to King Aethelstan.

452
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:30,616
He may need help with the
reading of this letter.

453
00:29:30,617 --> 00:29:31,836
Aethelstan.

454
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,416
He is to deal with the rogue
Danes at Beamfleot and swiftly.

455
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,906
- If you could emphasise swiftly.
- Emphasise swiftly.

456
00:29:36,907 --> 00:29:39,906
You have been allocated a guard. They
are waiting for you in the stable.

457
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:42,737
- I am to leave now, Lord?
- Swiftly, Father.

458
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:47,406
May I say, I was somewhat looking
forward to the celebrations, Lord, the...

459
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:50,307
The whole of Winchester
shall be... celebrating...

460
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:52,326
Swiftly.

461
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:54,156
Yes, Lord. I will gather what I need.

462
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:55,237
Lord.

463
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:01,096
You are ready?

464
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:07,136
I am.

465
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:09,906
There is still a little
decorative work to be done.

466
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:12,576
Now, do not touch it, you
have ink on your hands.

467
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,497
Say what you think.

468
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:28,886
Do you like it?

469
00:30:30,857 --> 00:30:33,106
I have not seen anything so beautiful.

470
00:30:35,827 --> 00:30:38,826
- He does not deserve you.
- Did I not say the same?

471
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:40,656
I hope that Aethelred says the same.

472
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:44,787
Aethelred should consider himself
a very fortunate young man.

473
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:47,406
And in time, you will
grow fond of him, I'm sure.

474
00:30:47,407 --> 00:30:48,676
I'm already fond of him.

475
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:50,787
0h, shush now, you've barely met him!

476
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:52,896
The last time, over a year ago.

477
00:30:52,897 --> 00:30:55,326
Aethelred is a good and godly man.

478
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,906
Who is a little too fond of himself.

479
00:30:57,907 --> 00:30:59,967
Will Uhtred be coming to the wedding?

480
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:02,926
Sadly, he will, I'm sure.

481
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,227
I consider him to be our lucky charm.

482
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:07,287
Now, now, there'll be no
mention of luck or charms.

483
00:31:07,288 --> 00:31:09,067
There is God's will and nothing more.

484
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,146
Praise him.

485
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:16,287
Hold the horses.

486
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:18,957
Get some water.

487
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,656
It is fertile land, Lord.

488
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:27,207
No greener than Mercia.

489
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,696
Though Wessex does have
the advantage of not sharing

490
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:31,237
a border with the Welsh.

491
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:34,947
The Welsh to the west,
the Danes to the east

492
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:36,396
and Alfred to the south.

493
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:37,567
We're surrounded.

494
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,866
I would say we're perfectly positioned

495
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:44,037
at the very middle of
Alfred's idea of an England...

496
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,096
Pivotal.

497
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:47,737
Yes, I like that.

498
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:54,396
Lord? Lord!

499
00:31:55,617 --> 00:31:57,497
Have you made a decision yet?

500
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,557
- Have you given it thought?
- Given thought to what?

501
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:03,537
Uhtred.

502
00:32:04,617 --> 00:32:08,227
Well... my request to marry, Lord.
I... would like to have a family.

503
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,356
Lord, you will answer the man.

504
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:18,967
I will speak with her at
Winchester and give you my decision.

505
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:20,366
Thank you, Lord.

506
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:24,076
But you are to give her no more
of your arm-rings, nor silver!

507
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,086
If it is not the great Lord Uhtred

508
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:49,767
of the small and little-known
village of Coccham.

509
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,826
I see you're drinking again, Aethelwold.

510
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:53,936
It's just a cup or two, nothing more.

511
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,666
I have news for you.

512
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,406
You know where to find me.

513
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:04,336
Before you take yourself away to
an inn, I wish to speak with you.

514
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:06,027
About what?

515
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,247
Privately.

516
00:33:16,488 --> 00:33:21,027
Uhtred, please. Let us not
rush to make an enemy of Alfred.

517
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:23,277
And if the dead man and
the gods say differently?

518
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:25,957
They will not, if they are truly gods.

519
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:28,106
And also...

520
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:31,626
This girl whom Sihtric loves,
you will not belittle her.

521
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:34,106
She's an alehouse whore.

522
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:37,817
And what is Aethelflaed? What
is a peace cow if not a whore?

523
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:39,876
There's a difference, clearly.

524
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:42,406
She will marry and be humped
by a man she does not know

525
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:43,906
and for a price.

526
00:33:43,907 --> 00:33:45,126
Where's the difference?

527
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:49,247
- It's the way.
- She is a whore in a wedding gown.

528
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:53,047
If it is the way, then I
belong to your uncle still.

529
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:57,737
I will say no more.

530
00:33:57,738 --> 00:33:59,426
Well, I am pleased to hear it.

531
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:07,396
Uhtred.

532
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:10,565
Uhtred, as always, it
begins as a joy to see you.

533
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,599
And you, Father Beocca.

534
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:15,547
- You look well.
- I am well.

535
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:18,876
Oh, I would like you
to meet Father Pyrlig.

536
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:21,597
Lord Uhtred, I've heard much about you.

537
00:34:21,597 --> 00:34:24,126
Father Pyrlig here was
once a warrior himself.

538
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,396
Sword and spear, Lord,

539
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:27,976
but a man tires of sticking ironware
into the bellies of other men.

540
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:30,597
I would have enjoyed a
cup of ale with you both,

541
00:34:30,597 --> 00:34:32,047
but I must leave you.

542
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,697
You have the letter secure?

543
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:37,016
I do, Father. I've put it
right next to my ball bag.

544
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:40,117
Lord Uhtred, it was an honour.

545
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:45,646
- Unusual priest.
- Yes.

546
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,536
Uhtred, there is a matter upon which

547
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:52,777
l find myself in need of
your advice... about Thyra.

548
00:34:53,898 --> 00:34:57,226
Well, as I say, she's-she's
well, she's... delightful.

549
00:34:58,347 --> 00:34:59,806
But my problem is this...

550
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:05,056
She... must leave, I feel.

551
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:08,527
Join you at Coccham or return to Ragnar.

552
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:11,527
You don't want her here?

553
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,206
No. Yes, I mean...

554
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:18,556
No, I do want her here, it's just
that l... l simply cannot think.

555
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:21,836
I can't work, I can't sleep.

556
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:24,317
It has been like this for months.

557
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:27,697
I mean, I can barely pray,
and even when I do pray,

558
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,976
I pray only for myself,
which is wrong, very wrong.

559
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:33,467
- Sinful.
- Wrong.

560
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:37,496
I didn't realise she had
become such a burden, Father.

561
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:40,496
I mean, she's not a burden.
She could never be a burden.

562
00:35:42,418 --> 00:35:45,086
Then, Father, I'm lost.
Why must she leave?

563
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:48,507
Because I cannot think
of anything but her.

564
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:55,496
It is constant and it is
pathetic and hopeless because...

565
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:57,416
Well, she is fair and I am, Beocca,

566
00:35:57,418 --> 00:36:00,976
a man old enough to be
her... much older brother.

567
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:05,947
- You're smiling.
- No.

568
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,726
You're laughing at me.

569
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:10,166
No, Father, I swear,
I'm not laughing at you.

570
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,556
- Well, I can see your teeth.
- I'm sharing your joy.

571
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,887
There is no joy.

572
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,836
I feel I am in a purgatory of sorts.

573
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:21,467
Thyra will not go to Ragnar.

574
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:24,277
She is happy here in
Winchester with you.

575
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:28,737
- Nonsense.
- Beocca, you are her peace. Her happiness.

576
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:32,056
- Marry her.
- Marry her?

577
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,916
You should marry her,
Father. And bed her.

578
00:36:38,387 --> 00:36:41,907
And then give thanks to God
for giving us such a joy.

579
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:45,152
Praise him, Father. Praise Him!

580
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:49,737
But what if she refuses?

581
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:04,786
- Is that Aethelred?
- Hmm.

582
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:08,496
From what I know, Alfred could
not have chosen a bigger turd.

583
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:10,367
I've never met the man,

584
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:14,586
but by the look of him, he was
indeed shat out the arse of a giant.

585
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:17,967
He is to be King of
Mercia, they are saying.

586
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:20,447
The Ealdormen of the
Witan, they're saying.

587
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,646
The Lord of Mercia, perhaps.

588
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:26,166
Alfred would never allow
another Saxon to be called King.

589
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,836
Nor would a certain
dead man called Bjorn.

590
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:32,547
- He wishes to meet you.
- Come with me.

591
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,827
You're pinching my skin!
You're pinching my skin!

592
00:37:37,277 --> 00:37:38,586
This was clean!

593
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:40,797
Why is it that you are being
trusted with my business?

594
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:42,996
- Who gave you this message?
- A skald. A pagan skald.

595
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:44,867
- His name?!
- Eilaf? Eilif?

596
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:48,387
Something Dane, something
odd! Are you any wiser?

597
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:51,106
No, you are not. I am a
messenger, nothing more.

598
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:55,237
Like it or not, we
are bonded, you and l.

599
00:37:55,237 --> 00:37:56,503
- Bonded?
- Yes!

600
00:37:56,914 --> 00:38:00,246
Our ancestors were kings and yet we
are barely acknowledged as Ealdormen!

601
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:03,717
We deserve more. You
especially deserve more.

602
00:38:06,947 --> 00:38:09,106
As for me, I have a chamber
in the palace and that is it.

603
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:11,356
That is the sum of my land.
He has given me nothing.

604
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:13,467
I am no longer part of the Witan, even.

605
00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:19,516
Uhtred, I can see you are torn,

606
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:22,516
but why should we stand by and watch
while power and wealth is given to

607
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:24,487
the likes of Aethelred of Mercia?

608
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:27,717
You were witness, you saw him just now,

609
00:38:27,717 --> 00:38:30,246
riding through Winchester like
a peacock, like he was King!

610
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:32,317
When?

611
00:38:32,318 --> 00:38:34,097
When am I to meet with Bjorn?

612
00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:36,766
If we leave tonight,

613
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:39,067
we can be back here in two
days, in time for the wedding.

614
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,077
I am to take you there.

615
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:48,106
Watch him rise from his grave and
you will know that it is all true.

616
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:51,297
He will not ask again.

617
00:38:51,297 --> 00:38:52,606
Lord!

618
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:54,396
Don't speak! Don't move!

619
00:38:58,097 --> 00:39:01,286
We leave as soon as my
horses are cooled and fed.

620
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:04,682
The winds are blowing
a change, Lord King.

621
00:39:11,737 --> 00:39:15,347
You'll be glad to hear that
I have made my decision.

622
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:17,036
You may marry this girl...

623
00:39:17,038 --> 00:39:19,336
- Lord, thank you!
- Upon completion of a task.

624
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:21,766
You'll fetch Clapa, you'll go
to the stables and wait for me.

625
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:24,076
Ensure the horses are
watered and fed, but ready.

626
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:25,797
- Yes, Lord.
- Go.

627
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:29,976
And thank you, Lord. We will
name our first son Uhtred, Lord.

628
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:32,876
- No, you will not!
- No, I will not.

629
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:52,947
Thyra?

630
00:39:52,947 --> 00:39:56,456
Beocca. You... you gave me a fright.

631
00:39:56,458 --> 00:39:58,427
Forgive me.

632
00:39:58,427 --> 00:40:01,476
Are you coming inside?

633
00:40:01,478 --> 00:40:04,146
I have supper.

634
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:08,786
Something I needed to say, Thyra,
something I need to... to ask.

635
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:11,507
- You should ask it...
- Marry me!

636
00:40:13,387 --> 00:40:15,496
I...I said... l said, marry me.

637
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:21,306
It was selfish of me to ask,
to even mention the word.

638
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:28,947
But... l fear you have become
someone I cannot live without.

639
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:31,197
You fear?

640
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:32,927
Life without you...

641
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:43,106
Fear no more.

642
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:46,717
I am here.

643
00:40:47,418 --> 00:40:48,827
Always.

644
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:06,967
Supper?

645
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,217
Praise Him.

646
00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:13,996
This is it.

647
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:17,556
Skalds' Hall.

648
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,887
It was given to Eilaf by
his lord, for great service.

649
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:26,416
Sihtric, you will go no further, not
until we are at the hall and inside.

650
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:29,327
- At all times, you will remain unseen.
- Yes, Lord.

651
00:41:29,327 --> 00:41:32,887
If the dead man rises,

652
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:38,137
when he returns to his
grave, you will keep watching.

653
00:41:38,137 --> 00:41:39,827
What if he sees me, Lord?

654
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:45,547
What if... what if he
knows that I'm near?

655
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:48,027
Then you shit yourself.

656
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:51,077
You will remain unseen and keep watch.

657
00:41:51,077 --> 00:41:52,577
Yes, Lord.

658
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:14,327
There are men. Warriors.

659
00:42:33,978 --> 00:42:36,407
We are here to see Eilaf, the Skald.

660
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:42,317
We have an invitation.

661
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,086
Who leads here?

662
00:42:46,398 --> 00:42:48,876
- You?
- I do.

663
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:56,197
I am Haesten, and you
are Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

664
00:42:56,197 --> 00:42:58,867
You spared me at Eoferwic, Lord.

665
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,117
You are expected and welcome.

666
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:27,275
Go take a piss.

667
00:43:29,527 --> 00:43:32,996
- Who is he?
- A thief, Lord.

668
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:47,856
I serve Erik, Sigefrid's brother.

669
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:50,576
He sends you good wishes.

670
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:53,065
Erik is not here?

671
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,925
He is not, and if I had my way,

672
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:58,076
I would not be here.

673
00:43:58,077 --> 00:44:01,266
My men are afraid.

674
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,045
Of ghosts?

675
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:09,376
It is not a sight you will forget.

676
00:44:12,146 --> 00:44:14,155
My Lord wants you to know that by now

677
00:44:14,157 --> 00:44:17,905
he will be at Beamfleot and not Frankia.

678
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:19,686
With Sigefrid?

679
00:44:19,686 --> 00:44:22,876
And his brother and with the fleet.

680
00:44:22,876 --> 00:44:24,755
He insisted you were told.

681
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:26,766
And where to after Beamfleot?

682
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,706
I can't say.

683
00:44:30,706 --> 00:44:34,226
But it is hoped that
you will join us there.

684
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:38,346
Eilaf is resting, Lord,
in preparation for tonight.

685
00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:40,456
You may wish to do the same.

686
00:44:51,097 --> 00:44:53,815
They have a fleet. How many, I wonder?

687
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:55,695
19 ships.

688
00:44:55,697 --> 00:44:59,206
That's more than 500 men,
plus those already there.

689
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:03,005
- And those who will come.
- Then, it has started.

690
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:04,746
What?

691
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,525
The end of the peace.

692
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:24,856
You stand too close, girl.

693
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:35,076
Do not make me speak to you again.

694
00:45:38,827 --> 00:45:41,255
Once the marriage is made,

695
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:44,916
you should consider making
Aethelred earn his privilege.

696
00:45:44,916 --> 00:45:49,465
Skirmishes and raids from the Danes
must not be tolerated, not one.

697
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:51,715
It should be made
Aethelred's responsibility.

698
00:45:51,717 --> 00:45:56,215
And the Mercian Ealdormen should
be invited to attend a Wessex Witan.

699
00:45:56,217 --> 00:45:58,275
For the purpose of what?

700
00:45:58,277 --> 00:46:00,666
For the purpose of bowing to the King

701
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:03,576
and watching the Lord
of Mercia do the same.

702
00:46:05,967 --> 00:46:07,976
I do not doubt for a
moment that Aethelred

703
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,545
has dreamt, is dreaming,
of overtaking me.

704
00:46:12,737 --> 00:46:14,965
It would be a simple
reminder of his position.

705
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:18,856
Excuse me, Lord.

706
00:46:18,856 --> 00:46:21,155
Odda. Come in, join us.

707
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,893
Lord, it is about both
something and nothing.

708
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:29,293
Sit.

709
00:46:34,987 --> 00:46:37,795
Uhtred has left Winchester, last night.

710
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:41,126
- And gone where?
- We don't know for certain.

711
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:44,596
- And what of his current witch?
- His wife, dear.

712
00:46:44,597 --> 00:46:47,315
The lady Gisela remains in Winchester.

713
00:46:47,317 --> 00:46:49,376
Well, he can't have gone far.

714
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,576
Aethelwold is with Uhtred.

715
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:55,885
- They went in which direction?
- Mercia, Lord.

716
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:01,326
I think it is something
more than nothing, Odda,

717
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:03,956
and I am wholly tired at
never-ending disobedience.

718
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:06,485
But it will not ruin
your appetite, Lord.

719
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,186
It will not.

720
00:47:10,186 --> 00:47:12,255
Put a watch on Gisela.
She must not leave

721
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:15,346
until her husband has returned
and explained his absence.

722
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:19,936
Father Beocca.

723
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:24,576
Lord. Lord, Lady, I have news.

724
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:26,505
Uhtred has returned?

725
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:28,235
From where, Lord?

726
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:30,155
What is your news, Father Beocca?

727
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:33,485
I am to be married.

728
00:47:39,396 --> 00:47:43,286
The once proud and brave Earl Guthrum.

729
00:47:44,876 --> 00:47:48,016
He now calls himself a Christian!

730
00:47:50,507 --> 00:47:54,115
He now calls himself King Aethelstan,

731
00:47:54,117 --> 00:48:00,025
but he's nothing but Alfred's
hound, and he's shamed us all!

732
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:05,126
He has shamed every warrior
that has gone before us!

733
00:48:07,097 --> 00:48:08,925
He has shamed the gods!

734
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:15,635
And the gods call upon every man
gathered here today to avenge them!

735
00:48:17,347 --> 00:48:19,824
And avenge them we will!

736
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:28,056
By sunrise tomorrow, Lunden and
all of its riches shall be yours!

737
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:35,365
Believe me when I tell
you, the gods are with us!

738
00:48:35,367 --> 00:48:37,615
The gods are with us!

739
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,438
_

740
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:29,525
Forgive me for not being
awake to greet you, Lord.

741
00:50:30,556 --> 00:50:34,824
Bjorn has given me little
rest these recent times.

742
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:40,255
We understand.

743
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:44,855
The gods are wanting true men.

744
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:48,695
So, I thank you for being
here, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

745
00:50:50,436 --> 00:50:54,554
After tonight, I hope to sleep.

746
00:51:05,016 --> 00:51:06,885
Fetch the blood.

747
00:51:12,746 --> 00:51:15,045
It is time.

748
00:51:40,315 --> 00:51:42,324
It's a Christian graveyard.

749
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:43,686
Yes, Lord.

750
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,802
Perhaps that is why Bjorn cannot rest...

751
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:48,885
Nor pass.

752
00:52:04,356 --> 00:52:08,014
Please, no. Please. Please!

753
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:14,954
To raise the dead, Lord, we need
to send a messenger across the gulf.

754
00:52:15,456 --> 00:52:17,864
- He is guilty?
- Twice over.

755
00:52:17,865 --> 00:52:22,141
Please, I beg you, Lord, please! I
have a wife, I have children! Please!

756
00:52:22,177 --> 00:52:25,974
- What did you steal?
- Just a lamb, Lord, for my family.

757
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,835
- And furs.
- For my family, Lord!

758
00:52:28,835 --> 00:52:31,545
I'm sorry, but a thief
twice over deserves to die.

759
00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:34,175
- No! Please, please!
- Put it in his mouth.

760
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,375
Please, no, please,
Lord, I beg you, please!

761
00:52:36,376 --> 00:52:38,905
I can fight, I can work, I can serve
you, Lord! Please, I beg of you!

762
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,594
I am on your side, Lord!

763
00:52:40,596 --> 00:52:43,364
What is it? Please!
No, Lord, please, no!

764
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:49,125
Shhh.

765
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:54,054
A harp string, Lord. A bridge
from our world to Bjorn's.

766
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:55,974
Kill him.

767
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:58,594
No, please, Lord!
Please, Lord, no, please!

768
00:52:58,596 --> 00:53:02,255
Get the message into
his mouth and kill him.

769
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:05,485
Spare me! Spare me and I
will repay you with gratitude!

770
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:08,635
Please, Lord! Please, Lord!

771
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:43,034
Bjorn, you have blood.

772
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:48,664
I have given you life.

773
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,724
I have sent you a message.

774
00:53:51,755 --> 00:53:53,775
If it's peace that you want,

775
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:57,295
you shall not have it
until we hear you speak.

776
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:46,375
The harp string.

777
00:54:46,376 --> 00:54:49,414
Welcome, Bjorn. This is Lord Uhtred,

778
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:52,844
who has sent a good many Dane
to the place where you live.

779
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:55,934
I do not live.

780
00:54:55,936 --> 00:54:58,465
You have a message for Lord Uhtred.

781
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:10,514
Lord Uhtred. I see you now.

782
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:17,264
The gods have had their
sacrifice and the brothers

783
00:55:17,266 --> 00:55:22,655
have tonight begun that
which cannot be stopped.

784
00:55:22,655 --> 00:55:28,844
Lunden's streets are
red with Saxon blood.

785
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:36,625
You are to be King.

786
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:42,905
King of Mercia, King of Saxon and Dane.

787
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:47,125
King of other kings.

788
00:55:51,726 --> 00:55:54,394
You, Lord Uhtred.

789
00:56:05,226 --> 00:56:07,195
Bury him.

790
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:13,335
Lord King? It is done.

791
00:56:56,235 --> 00:57:00,923
What we have just witnessed.
Do you believe it to be true?

792
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:02,563
I do.

793
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,173
And me.

794
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:10,574
It put a shiver through
your spine, no doubt.

795
00:57:12,034 --> 00:57:15,873
So, what now? You are sworn to Alfred.

796
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:20,233
Alfred is nothing compared
to the gods, I would suggest.

797
00:57:23,235 --> 00:57:28,063
Uhtred, it is our birth-right
to be called kings.

798
00:57:29,565 --> 00:57:31,153
Haesten!

799
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:34,108
Lord?

800
00:57:34,143 --> 00:57:38,614
The brothers Sigefrid and Erik,
is it true what Bjorn says?

801
00:57:38,614 --> 00:57:40,534
They're attacking Lunden?

802
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:44,003
I cannot say for certain,
Lord, but that was the plan,

803
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:49,764
to sail upriver and take Lunden,
which would now be your city,

804
00:57:49,764 --> 00:57:51,733
as King of Mercia.

805
