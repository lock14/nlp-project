1
00:00:59,366 --> 00:01:05,345
The only wonder of the world
seen from outer space...

2
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:09,340
...is the Great Wall of China.

3
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:15,999
The sole purpose of building the wall
was to protect the land.

4
00:02:18,815 --> 00:02:21,498
The enemy kept coming.

5
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,893
He fought on bravely.

6
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,426
The greatest warrior of China:

7
00:02:35,037 --> 00:02:37,720
Liu Sheng.

8
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:44,504
Today the wall is for tourists.

9
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:49,305
The spirit of warriors
lies frozen in statues.

10
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:56,753
But the enemy returns.

11
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:59,254
Hojo.

12
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:27,696
The evil Hojo has the village Zhange
in his grip.

13
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:32,493
He knows riches worth millions
are hidden here.

14
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:35,859
He sells their treasures to foreigners.

15
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:50,958
Sure. I'll talk to Dad about the shipment.

16
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:56,085
You Lazy dog.

17
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:14,962
Go. Or your son dies!

18
00:04:40,465 --> 00:04:46,410
Hojo 's treacherous games
brought ruin to the villagers...

19
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:50,888
...and death too.

20
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,115
They were helpless.

21
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:11,880
In times of trouble,
even the blind look to God.

22
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:16,038
But help only comes
to the drowning man...

23
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:19,466
...if he reaches out for it.

24
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:25,922
The villagers sought a guiding light
to brighten their dark days.

25
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:11,875
The key to their survival lay in their past.

26
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:16,959
Their centuries-old protector
had returned.

27
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:22,595
He was born again: Liu Sheng.

28
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,434
Born in another form and country...

29
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:30,820
... their protector awaits them.

30
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:04,990
You smile?.

31
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,678
You're done for.

32
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,937
Where to?. You're Lunch.

33
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,112
I spent 100 rupees on five Lottery tickets.

34
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:36,093
Only one. Let me win.

35
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:42,713
Can't you help me?.
You do nothing all day!

36
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,949
Oh, God.
My winning Lottery ticket is burning.

37
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:39,148
Keep it then!

38
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,408
You insult me.

39
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:55,693
You tell people they were royalty
in a previous lifetime.

40
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:56,839
And me?. A mosquito?.

41
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,676
Shut up. You burping toad.
Do you know who I am?.

42
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:05,806
Chopstick.
The only Fung Shastra master in the world.

43
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:11,019
Get it?.
A Master of Feng Shui and Vastu Shastra.

44
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:14,053
I get it. Indian noodles. Chinese curry.

45
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:16,491
Put it down.

46
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:20,036
I'm the only mosquito I know
who works like a dog.

47
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,061
Shut up.

48
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:27,175
Here. See this lucky amulet?.

49
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,609
It'll change your fate.

50
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:32,262
It has the mighty power of Fung Shastra.

51
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:36,774
It's yours. How much have you got?.

52
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,940
How much?.

53
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,664
I'll check.

54
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:46,913
Two rupees.

55
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,781
-Damn. Give it to me.
-Will my luck turn?.

56
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,660
Fool. Wear it and see.

57
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:59,071
You'll be flying like a king.

58
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:15,939
Dada, if I were a big shot,
you'd have no food on your menu.

59
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:20,098
Thanks to you,
my restaurant survives. Right?.

60
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:24,158
Or I'd be begging at Jama Mosque.
I know.

61
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:28,997
You know nothing. If I had worn the amulet,
who knows what I'd be today.

62
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:35,588
Sidhu, you're naive.
Don't get conned by those work-shy fools.

63
00:11:35,751 --> 00:11:38,467
Destiny isn't in your palm.

64
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,711
It's in hard work.

65
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:43,933
Hard work makes sweat. Not money.

66
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,885
I need to get lucky to have money.

67
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,900
Hard work will bring luck.

68
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:54,178
Don't take it out on him.
Stand on your own feet.

69
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:57,538
Stop cooking dreams.
No miracles will strike.

70
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:02,114
How can a miracle strike?.
I never wore the amulet.

71
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:16,856
Dada. Lord Ganesh has appeared
in a potato. A miracle.

72
00:12:20,738 --> 00:12:24,796
Long live Lord Ganesh

73
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,905
Son of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva

74
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:48,732
The charity box is there.

75
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:58,485
It's not Sidhu's. It's Chopstick's cash box.
Long live bank notes.

76
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:03,258
Why did Lord Ganesh choose to appear
in a potato?.

77
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:07,447
Mysterious are the ways of God.
Pay your respects and move on.

78
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:10,102
Four hundred and ten, 420 rupees.

79
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:14,739
Pay protection money. Out with it.

80
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:31,153
Don't pull his hand away
or he'll rip my cheek.

81
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:37,176
Easy.

82
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:45,846
Cool air, please.

83
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:16,947
Dada.

84
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,523
I knew Lord Ganesh
would send you in good time.

85
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:25,490
Long live Lord Ganesh.

86
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,596
No, Dada.

87
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:59,944
Easy. You can't make an omelet
without eggs.

88
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,194
Bring the bride here.

89
00:15:14,097 --> 00:15:16,999
He shows up here too. The moron.

90
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,149
Dada.

91
00:15:35,983 --> 00:15:38,372
Remember, Dada.

92
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:44,259
You won't find another vegetable cutter
like me in Chandni Chowk.

93
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,653
I make the best curry. Mughalai....
Where is he?.

94
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,595
Chinese?.

95
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,202
He's Chinese too?.

96
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:20,261
He needs to know
he's Liu Sheng. Reborn.

97
00:16:20,426 --> 00:16:23,241
Tell him he's the warrior Liu Sheng.

98
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:28,419
He must destroy Hojo. Destroy Hojo.

99
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:32,993
Only Liu Sheng can kill him.

100
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:38,727
Hojo has taken control of our village.

101
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:41,060
Hojo decapitates our men.

102
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:50,657
We have found you at last.

103
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:56,125
You must destroy Hojo.

104
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:06,561
How do I explain to them?.
They mistake a toothpick for an arrow.

105
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:14,334
Chopstick. Good fortune comes from China
and you show it a "Do Not Disturb" sign?.

106
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,443
If you tell Sidhu they want him to kill
an evil enemy, he'll never go to China.

107
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:25,666
Don't lie, Chopstick. He may amount
to nothing, but spare his life.

108
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:28,959
Give him a break. He'll love you for it.

109
00:17:29,123 --> 00:17:32,091
What if Hojo drinks his blood?.

110
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:38,075
Your Chinese ancestors are calling you.
Go to China with him. And get rich.

111
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:39,672
No.

112
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:41,304
Don't listen.

113
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:42,653
Walk the path of truth.

114
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:45,982
Truth?. It will mislead you.

115
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,389
Why look from left to right?.

116
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:52,695
Are they speaking Sindhi?.
What's "Dado Hojo"?.

117
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:58,617
Your plans will go kaput if you tell him
it means "Kill Hojo." Wing it.

118
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:05,110
Dado Hojo means "the cool one."

119
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,599
You're cool too.

120
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,072
But they said a lot more.
What did they say?.

121
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,173
They said Lord Ganesh has blessed you.

122
00:18:18,335 --> 00:18:21,814
His blessings have changed your future.
And your past.

123
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:26,804
You were no fish, fly or flea
in a previous birth.

124
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:30,770
You were a great and fearless
Chinese king.

125
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,876
-Liu Sheng.
-Liu Sheng.

126
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,674
Dado Hojo.

127
00:18:55,835 --> 00:19:02,261
I'm going from Chandni Chowk to China!

128
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:05,943
Hello, boys.

129
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:12,113
She has the curves
She has heart

130
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:16,657
A chance for romance

131
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:19,672
Come, baby, let's dance

132
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:23,029
But Baby can 't dance

133
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:28,847
The new baby in the town
Dreams of dating the DJ

134
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:31,661
But Baby can 't dance

135
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:37,747
But Baby can 't dance
But Baby can 't dance

136
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,463
I will never dance well.

137
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,313
I don't want to live anymore.
Give me poison.

138
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:44,851
Don 't despair.

139
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,878
You don 't need poison.
You need Dance Master G9.

140
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:50,540
Dance Master G9?.

141
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,652
Yes! Dance Master G9.

142
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:54,673
A new Chinese gadget.

143
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,934
Tie it to your ankles.
Press a button and dance.

144
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:02,829
Bhangra to Beyonce. Dance!

145
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,334
Keep your husbands from bar girls.

146
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:10,026
Do the dancing yourself!

147
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,853
Buy Dance Master G9.

148
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,692
I am Miss TSM.

149
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:18,892
Cool, sexy, confident, glam.
That's me.

150
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,617
Thanks to Dance Master G9.

151
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,571
You want to shine like me?.
Order Dance Master G9.

152
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:40,455
Master!

153
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:43,472
Can I find a girl like her in China?.

154
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:48,299
Join the line for a Chinese visa.
Who cares if you're Miss TSM?.

155
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:54,060
Tell your sob story to someone else.
I can't help you. Try asking around.

156
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,711
Go on. Go through, sir.

157
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:57,991
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

158
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,915
Excuse me.

159
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:04,552
Madam, do you have a token?.
Go through.

160
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:08,133
Long live Lord Ganesh

161
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:12,392
Son of Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva

162
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:16,392
O dear lord, master of all.

163
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:24,867
You have answered my prayers.
All I need now is Miss TSM.

164
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,435
My forehead has become dented from
bowing at Shiva's temple.

165
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:36,005
I'll cook the finest delicacies for you.

166
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,710
Your father, Lord Shiva,
never heeded me.

167
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,537
Please, Lord Ganesh.

168
00:21:55,817 --> 00:21:59,591
My God!
I didn't order a dish but here it is.

169
00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:04,963
A woman as lovely as cake
can only be a gift from Lord Ganesh.

170
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:09,797
You are no ordinary dish!
Lord Ganesh seasoned you himself.

171
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,829
My number's been called. I'll be back.

172
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:42,912
Rascal.

173
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:49,945
What's happening to me?.

174
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:56,440
A fellow is dancing like a loony,
I'll just check, sir.

175
00:23:04,898 --> 00:23:07,102
The token will be mine.
Thanks to Dance Master G9.

176
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:11,357
Give me back my token! Wicked girl.

177
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,431
You bad girl!

178
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,998
A bomb!

179
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:20,058
Miss TSM!

180
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,946
Sidhu!

181
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:32,920
I'll give you a tight slap.
Off to China! If you please.

182
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:34,069
Okay. I won't go.

183
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:40,763
I'm furious. Take your bags inside!

184
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,836
No one can stop a hurricane.

185
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:48,308
Not by cursing or kicking.
Let him go to China.

186
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:54,205
You crook! My shoe will land on
your head and knock sense into you.

187
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:59,922
Move it. You always trust the wrong people.
You will never change.

188
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,849
Let me go to China
and fulfill my dream.

189
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:04,859
Stop dreaming! You'll wake up
and find you have nothing.

190
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,867
What do I have now?.

191
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:14,106
No car, no house, no servant.
Not even a mother on my side.

192
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:19,155
I started life in a dustbin.
I might end up on a rubbish heap.

193
00:24:24,314 --> 00:24:28,470
Well done, brother. Well spoken.

194
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:35,792
You were so high when I took you in.
I became your family.

195
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,224
I raised you.

196
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:42,353
And you talk of ending up
on a rubbish heap.

197
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:46,263
You trust that crook.
You think a potato is a god.

198
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:50,221
You don't have a grain of self-belief.

199
00:24:51,895 --> 00:24:55,539
I yell at you. I hit you.

200
00:24:57,047 --> 00:25:02,862
I'm nobody to you, right?.
So you talk of ending up on a rubbish heap.

201
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:07,309
Very well. Be on your way.

202
00:25:07,478 --> 00:25:10,893
I don't want anything from you.

203
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,738
Dada. For my sake, wait.

204
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:23,053
I know...

205
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:30,004
...you taught me everything.
You brought me up.

206
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:39,465
My destiny won't be made here.
It will be made in China.

207
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:48,968
I know you will save me if I get into trouble.

208
00:25:51,122 --> 00:25:56,271
Dada, don't be angry with me. Let me go.

209
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:07,118
Dada, if everything goes well,
promise you'll come to China.

210
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,609
Me?. To China?. No.

211
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,802
Of course. If you don't come,
who will kick me in the backside?.

212
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:17,164
How will I fly through the air?.

213
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,184
Tell me the truth.

214
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:29,956
You won't let me go
because you'll miss me, right?. Don't lie.

215
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:41,990
Be careful, brother.

216
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:46,597
Danger lurks in the strangest places.

217
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:57,153
And so with Dada's blessings,
Sidhu set off to China.

218
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:49,052
Let me close the bin.
Our things will fall out.

219
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,401
Are you stupid?.

220
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:09,625
The little touches that count.

221
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:13,504
Jet Airways.

222
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:20,542
Master! She's a wicked girl.

223
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:23,389
Don't trust her! She's bad.

224
00:28:23,554 --> 00:28:26,402
Lower your voice.
No woman can be trusted.

225
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:11,059
From Chandni Chowk to China

226
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:15,417
I haven 't figured out who I am

227
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:26,963
Look at my face

228
00:29:27,996 --> 00:29:29,240
Plain and simple

229
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:32,729
Everyone tells me I'm a king
Not a pauper

230
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:38,230
Who threw a banana peel here?.

231
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:40,566
Chinese comrades! Ready?.

232
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:56,914
Have you seen your face in the mirror?

233
00:29:57,593 --> 00:30:02,032
You look a right clown

234
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,215
Zero brains

235
00:30:03,608 --> 00:30:05,910
Push you and you'll topple over

236
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:10,416
Silly oaf
It's a sham, all a scam

237
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:18,861
She walks away, stirring his heart

238
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,719
See how he abandons his dreams
And goes after her

239
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,429
Have you seen your face in the mirror?

240
00:30:56,628 --> 00:31:00,653
Girl! Get my drift?
Stop showing me attitude

241
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:04,909
I'm as hot as they get
Stop teasing me

242
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,432
I claw like a cat

243
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,423
Uniforms fear me

244
00:31:14,193 --> 00:31:17,771
My braid is a blade
You big hulk, get lost

245
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,380
Like tamarind, I'm tangy and sweet

246
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:26,473
Like lightning, I'll burn you to eternity

247
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,382
Silly oaf
It's a sham, all a scam

248
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:39,051
Her mischief has made mincemeat of you

249
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:43,012
Where did she come from?
Who does she think she is?

250
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:45,222
Grabbing everything in sight

251
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,725
This doll or that doll will do
As long as she's made in China

252
00:31:51,917 --> 00:31:56,227
Let them burn with envy
Here I go

253
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:01,065
Chandni Chowk behind me
China up ahead

254
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:04,044
Chinatown

255
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:08,906
Let's go down
Chinatown

256
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:12,865
Silly oaf
It's no sham, it's no scam

257
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:21,449
Have no fear
The lord above

258
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:27,208
Will make this clown a king

259
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,024
From Chandni Chowk to China

260
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:32,608
I haven't figured out who I am.

261
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,238
-Are you--?.
-Stupid. Stupid, stupid.

262
00:32:44,393 --> 00:32:46,945
Go to sleep.

263
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:52,734
Are you both stupid?.

264
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:27,488
-Dado Hojo!
-Kill Hojo!

265
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:41,178
Lord Ganesh! I am in China.

266
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:49,496
See that, Chopstick?.

267
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:53,528
Now he has the disciples,
and you're left holding the bags.

268
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,585
Flies love caviar as much as garbage.

269
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:59,455
Look at him! He isn't even a flea.

270
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:09,368
That's her!

271
00:34:13,216 --> 00:34:17,013
Get out of the way. Move.

272
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,324
Stop her. She's a cheat.

273
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:37,594
Where are you heading?.

274
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:46,034
Are you nice as sugar and spice?.
Or bitter as lemon?.

275
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:50,866
How did you turn Chinese?. Or is it
"do in Rome as the Romans do?."

276
00:34:52,572 --> 00:34:55,419
Indian arts are now martial arts, eh?.

277
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:58,928
What's this?. How did this bun appear?.

278
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,811
-Who baked it?.
-Stop it.

279
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:03,320
You said "tit."

280
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:06,645
Sidhu, have you gone nuts?.
Why are you harassing the lady?.

281
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:10,159
That's no lady. Miss TSM is a cheat.
I won't spare her.

282
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,639
Wait for me!

283
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:17,305
Who baked your bun?.

284
00:35:21,945 --> 00:35:25,076
Get your paws off the women!

285
00:36:39,922 --> 00:36:46,118
Diamonds seized.
Liu Sheng?. An Indian.

286
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:19,784
Go to India
and find out who this man is.

287
00:37:20,525 --> 00:37:26,602
Hojo sends his henchman, Joey,
to uncover the truth about Sidhu.

288
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:43,906
Meow Meow wondered
why Sidhu chased her at the airport.

289
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:46,082
And why he thought he knew her.

290
00:37:54,378 --> 00:38:00,160
I'm Miss TSM. I'm Sakhi.
How will I explain in Chinese?.

291
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,355
Miss Sakhi, welcome to the TSM factory
in China.

292
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:11,485
I'm a Chinese guy
Hello to you

293
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,689
Multi Language Translator

294
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,770
Now watch the magic

295
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:18,342
How come they speak Hindi?.

296
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,667
I speak every lingo of the world

297
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:24,804
Press the button

298
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,237
You can speak too

299
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:30,594
Like a necklace
Wear it close to your heart

300
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,888
Wow, you're a genius.

301
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:43,104
A magic umbrella
It comes in handy, rain or shine

302
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:50,747
A shield against bullets.

303
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:53,795
Wow, James Bond.

304
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,810
You'll say it's a parachute too?.

305
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,261
Lands like a feather

306
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:09,058
This pepper spray stings
A girl's perfect bodyguard

307
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,324
Now, isn 't that smart?

308
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,060
I'm Miss TSM from China.

309
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:31,260
Thank you.

310
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:33,879
Put the products in her car.
This way, please.

311
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,134
You're such a big star in India.

312
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:43,100
All this way for the samples?.
From India to China.

313
00:39:43,263 --> 00:39:44,986
So far?.

314
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:51,188
Far?. China is very close to my heart.

315
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:55,990
My parents met here.

316
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,339
My dad. Inspector Chiang Kohung.

317
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:06,454
You're under arrest, Hojo!

318
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:16,978
My twin, Suzy...

319
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:19,995
...and I were born in China.

320
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:26,771
Suzy. Suzy. Sakhi.

321
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:28,113
Suzy?.

322
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:32,343
Suzy. Sakhi.

323
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:40,335
My family met their ruin in China.

324
00:40:41,882 --> 00:40:43,343
Smile.

325
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:46,419
Okay, thank you.

326
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,325
-Go. I'll join you. Take Sakhi.
-And you?.

327
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:55,473
Suzy. Suzy.

328
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:19,468
Run!

329
00:41:30,644 --> 00:41:31,887
My husband!

330
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:49,703
My daughter! Suzy!

331
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:42,986
Chiang Kohung!

332
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:49,291
No! Suzy!

333
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:02,816
We never found Suzy's or Dad's body.

334
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:08,037
Mother couldn't bear her loss
and she too....

335
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:14,334
She always said they were still alive.

336
00:43:15,497 --> 00:43:22,207
I came all the way to China
to lay them to rest...

337
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:24,832
...and find peace.

338
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:42,789
Dad, Suzy...

339
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:47,715
...I could never meet you.

340
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:49,307
Suzy?.

341
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:51,494
I, Sakhi Kohung Chiang, promise...

342
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:55,108
...I'll never forget you.

343
00:43:55,526 --> 00:43:58,013
Sakhi?.

344
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:00,442
Suzy?

345
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:09,373
No!

346
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,190
Subtitle?.

347
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:11,898
They say Liu Sheng died here.

348
00:45:12,638 --> 00:45:17,656
No, he didn't die. He was martyred.

349
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:25,719
Take it easy.

350
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:28,983
Pay your respects.

351
00:45:30,363 --> 00:45:33,625
-Liu Sheng!
-Liu Sheng!

352
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,321
We're after Meow Meow.

353
00:45:50,298 --> 00:45:52,207
Hello!

354
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,239
Have I so many fans in China?.

355
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,937
-There she is!
-Stop!

356
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:02,613
The police?. Fans of mine?. Autograph?.

357
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:06,453
-No autograph?.
-You're under arrest!

358
00:46:06,904 --> 00:46:08,465
Arrest?.

359
00:46:10,136 --> 00:46:11,118
No!

360
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:12,945
Catch me!

361
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:17,428
Where is Lord Ganesh?.

362
00:46:25,206 --> 00:46:26,613
Where is he?.

363
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:04,268
I fell. I didn't even realize it.

364
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,985
No! She's a dangerous woman.
She's violent.

365
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,679
Liu Sheng doesn't hurt women.

366
00:47:34,544 --> 00:47:37,031
The Indian hero.

367
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:39,660
Meow Meow.

368
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:44,231
Not here. Over there.

369
00:47:48,622 --> 00:47:50,314
What did I blurt out?.

370
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:56,973
Liu Sheng!

371
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,250
Master! I am in your country!
A poor boy from Chandni Chowk.

372
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:29,448
I'm here!
All the way from Chandni Chowk!

373
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:45,855
Your king has come!
Hello to each and everyone.

374
00:49:07,783 --> 00:49:12,289
He's here. Liu Sheng has arrived. Hurry.

375
00:49:17,253 --> 00:49:23,963
Costume. Makeup. Disguise.
No one will recognize me.

376
00:49:25,381 --> 00:49:28,131
Meow Meow returned defeated.

377
00:49:28,293 --> 00:49:31,358
Liu Sheng?. As if!

378
00:49:31,716 --> 00:49:34,585
Meow Meow was sure Hojo
would end her days...

379
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:37,538
...but he had another thought in mind:

380
00:49:41,602 --> 00:49:43,707
To kill Sidhu.

381
00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:49,914
How sweet is the taste of money

382
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:53,463
Survival is tough

383
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:00,703
But never forget what I tell you

384
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:05,950
You can never escape your destiny

385
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:09,501
I raise a toast to you, my friend

386
00:50:11,264 --> 00:50:15,158
The world is at your feet

387
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:21,145
Now stand up
And claim what is rightfully yours

388
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,883
Be the master of your destiny

389
00:50:26,782 --> 00:50:29,630
Master, this is an Indian song.

390
00:50:42,398 --> 00:50:48,212
O broad-shouldered, big-hearted
Iron-chested one

391
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,381
There 's nothing to fear, now you 're here

392
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,745
From Chandni Chowk to China

393
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:11,857
A friend of yours has come from India
Say hello

394
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:16,434
Make merry at night
Take it easy all day

395
00:51:26,265 --> 00:51:32,975
Everyone dance and sing
It's a holiday, time for fun

396
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,132
Attack!

397
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:47,210
There is no rich or poor, no high or low

398
00:52:47,505 --> 00:52:53,669
Everyone dance together, friend or foe

399
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,141
No black-marketeering

400
00:52:56,304 --> 00:52:58,246
Clean dealings today

401
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:04,558
Make merry at night
Take it easy all day

402
00:54:12,936 --> 00:54:15,173
Say hello to your friend

403
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:41,572
A friend of yours has come from India

404
00:54:41,734 --> 00:54:45,345
Say hello!

405
00:54:45,509 --> 00:54:50,593
Make merry at night

406
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:57,314
And now to sleep in China

407
00:54:57,764 --> 00:55:01,441
God. Why do I itch all over?.

408
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,475
I got it all wrong.

409
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:17,087
Try and understand. I'm innocent.

410
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,257
I don't know why the police want me.

411
00:55:24,545 --> 00:55:28,887
Master. Tomorrow's papers will have
a photo of me.

412
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:33,590
-I hit her and your photo is printed?.
-No. Your photo too.

413
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,175
-Go. Go to sleep.
-Master, I want to sleep next to you.

414
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,717
Shut it tight, master.

415
00:55:39,264 --> 00:55:42,230
-Get to bed. You'll be fine.
-Listen to me, master.

416
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:51,195
I'll check it again.

417
00:55:59,678 --> 00:56:01,204
Get to bed, Sidhu.

418
00:56:06,077 --> 00:56:07,320
She's changed again.

419
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:19,636
My lips are sealed, alas

420
00:56:20,027 --> 00:56:23,736
It's a secret, come near

421
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,329
How did you get here?.

422
00:56:32,218 --> 00:56:33,844
Touch me, touch me, touch me

423
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:36,344
I said, I said, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me

424
00:56:36,506 --> 00:56:39,156
I said, I said, hold me, hold me, hold me

425
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,735
Save me, master.

426
00:56:57,241 --> 00:56:59,662
She stole my heart

427
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,480
And walked away

428
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:05,751
That's my signature tune.

429
00:57:18,454 --> 00:57:24,400
I lost my mind, I'm half-crazed
What's this thing called love?

430
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,828
I'm terrified, master.
I must sleep next to you.

431
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:43,816
-What's wrong, master?.
-Nothing. I'm closing the door.

432
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:48,336
Make sure it's locked.
She's a slippery customer.

433
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,314
Suzy!

434
00:58:55,756 --> 00:58:58,953
Suzy! Suzy!

435
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:05,958
Suzy!

436
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:17,061
Suzy!

437
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:26,664
Suzy!

438
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,305
Suzy!

439
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:53,413
What a girl.

440
00:59:57,766 --> 01:00:00,286
No need to put on the light.

441
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,045
You dazzle like lightning.

442
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,220
So beautiful.

443
01:00:07,525 --> 01:00:10,045
Like these ignorant folk...

444
01:00:10,213 --> 01:00:12,863
...you also believe Sidhu is Liu Sheng.

445
01:00:13,028 --> 01:00:15,100
You mistake the monkey for the master.

446
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:25,824
He's a loser. A vegetable cutter
from Chandni Chowk.

447
01:00:26,179 --> 01:00:30,685
He dances to my tune.
He's no Liu Sheng.

448
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:36,665
Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng.

449
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:49,532
Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng?.

450
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,109
Sidhu isn't Liu Sheng?.

451
01:00:54,656 --> 01:00:56,859
That's what I said. He's a loser.

452
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:59,773
He's nothing.

453
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:06,359
He's a fool. I am everything.

454
01:01:06,527 --> 01:01:08,665
I am everything.

455
01:01:11,486 --> 01:01:18,196
This time Meow Meow
has the perfect gift for Hojo:

456
01:01:18,462 --> 01:01:22,171
A way to kill Sidhu.

457
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,185
Chopstick.

458
01:01:43,484 --> 01:01:44,977
Suzy.

459
01:01:57,178 --> 01:01:59,567
Suzy?. Wanted?.

460
01:02:01,978 --> 01:02:03,570
Sidhu?.

461
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:30,572
Wait.

462
01:02:34,871 --> 01:02:36,147
Don't tell her anything.

463
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:52,269
Tell them what you told me...

464
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:53,843
...about Liu Sheng.

465
01:02:54,677 --> 01:02:56,335
Sidhu is nothing.

466
01:02:56,724 --> 01:03:01,579
He is a loser. A fraud.
A vegetable cutter.

467
01:03:01,748 --> 01:03:02,958
A vegetable cutter.

468
01:03:03,731 --> 01:03:07,560
Daddy, I tricked him.

469
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:09,291
He doesn't know.

470
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:14,128
He was brought here to kill Hojo.

471
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:18,087
Greetings from India. I have proof, Hojo.

472
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:21,672
Hojo?.

473
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:55,595
Master.

474
01:04:01,262 --> 01:04:04,011
She's always giving me the slip.

475
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:06,339
Where's the girl?.

476
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,378
Liu Sheng, how are you?.

477
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:12,964
Liu Sheng, how are you?.

478
01:04:13,389 --> 01:04:14,501
Liu Sheng?.

479
01:04:14,668 --> 01:04:16,642
Sidhu?. Sidhu?.

480
01:04:17,389 --> 01:04:18,949
Liu Sheng?.

481
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:22,921
-We caught Meow Meow.
-No! I'm not her.

482
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:25,320
-Meow Meow!
-Liu Sheng?.

483
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:30,723
Hojo!

484
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,979
Hojo is here!

485
01:04:35,146 --> 01:04:37,961
Hojo is here!

486
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:41,766
Run for your life!
Run for your life!

487
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:57,313
-Liu Sheng!
-Liu Sheng!

488
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,654
These kids are real naughty.

489
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:18,434
-Come. Kill Hojo!
-You want to take a photo?.

490
01:05:19,622 --> 01:05:22,339
What's the hurry?.
Where were you all night?.

491
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:25,316
See how they respect me?.
It's all thanks to you.

492
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:29,219
They want to take our picture.
You come too.

493
01:05:30,053 --> 01:05:32,540
The photographer?.

494
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:34,116
Hojo!

495
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:39,033
Hey. Not the statue. Take a picture of me.

496
01:05:39,204 --> 01:05:43,032
Come on. Take the picture.
Indians and Chinese.

497
01:05:43,203 --> 01:05:46,881
Brothers all the way.

498
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:53,825
Where's your camera?. Where is it?.

499
01:05:54,466 --> 01:05:57,368
-Liu Sheng.
-That's right. I'm Liu Sheng.

500
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:01,563
Liu Sheng! Liu Sheng! Liu Sheng!

501
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:11,129
Hojo! Hojo! Hojo!

502
01:06:13,472 --> 01:06:16,123
-Dado Hojo!
-Kill Hojo!

503
01:06:16,288 --> 01:06:18,906
-Dado Hojo!
-Kill Hojo!

504
01:06:34,078 --> 01:06:36,795
Hojo! Hojo! Who will take my photo?.

505
01:06:49,054 --> 01:06:50,711
Tell your friend about me.

506
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:59,603
And tell him what I'm going to do to him.

507
01:07:02,076 --> 01:07:08,502
Dado Hojo! Dado Hojo!
Dado Hojo! Dado Hojo!

508
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:11,666
Dado Hojo! Dado--

509
01:07:12,635 --> 01:07:16,409
Sidhu, I lied to you.

510
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:48,021
Run from here, Sidhu.

511
01:07:59,063 --> 01:08:01,135
Let go of me!

512
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:04,434
Sidhu!

513
01:08:22,323 --> 01:08:23,817
Dada?.

514
01:08:50,128 --> 01:08:52,136
I made a terrible mistake.

515
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:56,394
I was no Liu Sheng in a previous life.

516
01:08:56,561 --> 01:09:01,349
I was a mosquito. And still am.

517
01:09:02,031 --> 01:09:05,163
Sir, I'm an ordinary man
from Chandni Chowk.

518
01:09:05,327 --> 01:09:07,563
Dada's foolish boy.

519
01:09:07,728 --> 01:09:09,615
Don't beg!

520
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:15,557
No, it isn't his fault. I'm to blame.
Punish me.

521
01:09:16,206 --> 01:09:21,224
Let him go, sir. It isn't his fault.

522
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:23,429
It isn't his fault.

523
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:28,995
Sidhu, get up!

524
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:32,296
I'll be disgraced forever.

525
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,500
Sidhu, get up!

526
01:09:54,667 --> 01:09:59,074
This is the man you call your Liu Sheng?.

527
01:10:03,689 --> 01:10:05,478
Liu Sheng?.

528
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:12,516
You think you can destroy me?.

529
01:10:14,057 --> 01:10:18,018
You want this man to save your village?.

530
01:10:18,184 --> 01:10:20,224
First let's see...

531
01:10:20,392 --> 01:10:23,141
...if he can save one man.

532
01:10:30,887 --> 01:10:35,491
If you can't use your hands to defend me,
then don't fold them to beg.

533
01:10:35,654 --> 01:10:41,055
Destroy them! Remember you are
from Chandni Chowk.

534
01:10:46,597 --> 01:10:48,834
You bastard!

535
01:10:49,573 --> 01:10:52,507
You have 20 hired hands and think
you're a strong man.

536
01:10:54,692 --> 01:10:59,034
If you're so brave, then fight me.
I'll chop you into bits and scatter them.

537
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:52,182
You are naive.
Don't trust these work-shy bastards.

538
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:05,205
Danger lurks in the strangest places.

539
01:12:12,925 --> 01:12:18,423
I know you'll save me
if I get into trouble.

540
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:52,618
Liu Sheng?.

541
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:53,253
Throw this Chandni Chowk man
out of China!

542
01:15:20,937 --> 01:15:23,304
You want to be Liu Sheng?.

543
01:15:26,409 --> 01:15:28,296
Then die like him.

544
01:17:07,362 --> 01:17:08,889
Sidhu!

545
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:15,768
The man whose hand I clasped
As I walked

546
01:17:18,656 --> 01:17:25,083
He changed life's colors for me

547
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:48,148
My life turned upside down in a minute

548
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:54,169
Filled with grief

549
01:17:54,333 --> 01:18:00,475
My God is slumbering

550
01:18:01,342 --> 01:18:07,057
My protector has gone away from me

551
01:18:07,228 --> 01:18:13,076
Having shown me the path to tread

552
01:18:28,922 --> 01:18:33,811
Your destiny is not
in the lines of your palm...

553
01:18:33,978 --> 01:18:36,531
...but in hard work.

554
01:18:36,697 --> 01:18:41,432
His name is Sidhu

555
01:18:57,079 --> 01:18:58,061
Dada.

556
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,038
Now what do you want?.

557
01:19:30,452 --> 01:19:31,532
My sister.

558
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:44,716
I belong nowhere.

559
01:19:44,978 --> 01:19:47,662
I have no one to turn to.

560
01:19:47,827 --> 01:19:50,640
I can't go back to Chandni Chowk.

561
01:19:50,802 --> 01:19:53,224
Give me some work. I'll do anything.

562
01:19:53,394 --> 01:19:55,696
I'll shine your shoes.

563
01:20:02,704 --> 01:20:08,301
To unite Meow Meow and Sakhi,
Chopstick joined Hojo 's gang.

564
01:20:09,552 --> 01:20:12,072
Three months later.

565
01:20:16,751 --> 01:20:19,238
You blessed me with one hand...

566
01:20:19,406 --> 01:20:22,472
...and took Dada away with the other.

567
01:20:22,638 --> 01:20:26,500
Why, Lord Ganesh?. Why?.

568
01:20:27,085 --> 01:20:29,703
What can I do here in China?.

569
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:31,778
Where to go?.

570
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:35,241
Oh, Lord. No one speaks Hindi here.

571
01:20:35,406 --> 01:20:39,464
What shall I do?. Show me the way, Lord.

572
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:43,906
Have you lost your mind?.
Talking to a potato.

573
01:20:44,077 --> 01:20:49,771
Make french fries and eat them.

574
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:52,615
You've lost weight.

575
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,884
It isn't a potato.

576
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:57,124
This is my god.

577
01:20:57,292 --> 01:21:00,226
Don't talk nonsense, old beggar.

578
01:21:01,163 --> 01:21:04,392
And people say I'm mad.

579
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,143
What did you say?.

580
01:21:16,426 --> 01:21:20,615
I said, people say I'm mad.

581
01:21:23,816 --> 01:21:25,726
You speak Hindi.

582
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,794
I was just repeating what I hear.

583
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,999
But you're speaking Hindi.

584
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:34,468
No, it's Chinese.

585
01:21:34,631 --> 01:21:38,460
No. You were speaking Hindi.

586
01:21:38,631 --> 01:21:42,492
How can I?. I'm Chinese. You're mad.

587
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:45,509
Sure. You're Chinese.
But you can speak Hindi.

588
01:21:50,086 --> 01:21:53,664
Be quiet. I can't remember.
I know nothing.

589
01:21:53,829 --> 01:21:57,473
Lord, I asked for the way
and you send the whole map.

590
01:21:57,637 --> 01:22:00,254
Stay away from me.

591
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:03,584
Lord Ganesh has sent you.

592
01:22:03,748 --> 01:22:07,642
Lord Ganesh has sent you.
People here think I'm Liu Sheng. Listen.

593
01:22:07,812 --> 01:22:10,529
Old beggar, listen to me.

594
01:22:12,964 --> 01:22:17,469
My God has sent you.
Do you understand who Lord Ganesh is?.

595
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:20,318
Old beggar, listen to me.

596
01:22:22,978 --> 01:22:26,360
Liu Sheng, Liu Sheng, Liu Sheng.

597
01:22:39,009 --> 01:22:40,568
Hojo?.

598
01:22:42,336 --> 01:22:44,344
Your future and your past have changed,
Sidhu.

599
01:22:44,513 --> 01:22:50,676
You're the great warrior Liu Sheng.

600
01:23:13,886 --> 01:23:17,049
Dada, I will avenge your death.

601
01:23:17,213 --> 01:23:19,352
I will become Liu Sheng.

602
01:23:19,676 --> 01:23:21,880
I will become Liu Sheng.

603
01:23:35,003 --> 01:23:38,386
That's good. Look at my friend.

604
01:23:48,314 --> 01:23:52,307
Go on. Laugh.

605
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:54,644
When I become Liu Sheng,
I'll be laughing at you.

606
01:23:54,809 --> 01:23:56,598
Go on. Laugh.

607
01:24:08,728 --> 01:24:11,891
The great beggar of China's Great Wall.

608
01:24:12,055 --> 01:24:15,186
I'm not a beggar. I'm Liu Sheng.

609
01:24:15,351 --> 01:24:18,253
Sure. They'll laugh themselves silly.

610
01:24:18,422 --> 01:24:22,415
But don't stop your brick-smashing act.

611
01:24:22,582 --> 01:24:27,317
When I have some chicken soup
and my muscles are toned...

612
01:24:27,478 --> 01:24:29,551
...I'll become Liu Sheng.

613
01:24:29,718 --> 01:24:31,628
What do you want?.

614
01:24:32,054 --> 01:24:34,639
My friend needs food.

615
01:24:34,806 --> 01:24:39,442
We have nothing cooked.
Can't you see?. We're redecorating.

616
01:24:39,604 --> 01:24:40,685
Get out.

617
01:24:41,045 --> 01:24:43,249
What did he say?.

618
01:24:43,572 --> 01:24:46,028
He said the restaurant is closed now.

619
01:24:46,196 --> 01:24:47,441
No food here.

620
01:24:47,604 --> 01:24:51,434
What do you mean?. I can cook.

621
01:24:51,604 --> 01:24:54,637
Well! So Liu Sheng is a chef?.

622
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:56,112
Yes, he is.

623
01:24:56,275 --> 01:24:58,925
You're no better than me.

624
01:24:59,091 --> 01:25:01,163
You've no family and remember nothing.

625
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:05,553
Look at your face. You look like a beggar.

626
01:25:05,714 --> 01:25:06,793
White Bull!

627
01:25:17,778 --> 01:25:19,818
What are you doing?. Get out!

628
01:25:19,985 --> 01:25:21,065
Police! Police!

629
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:22,793
Police!

630
01:25:39,407 --> 01:25:40,389
Sorry.

631
01:25:45,102 --> 01:25:47,142
Liu Sheng has stirred.

632
01:25:53,165 --> 01:25:56,613
Liu Sheng has stirred in me.

633
01:26:03,596 --> 01:26:05,735
Liu Sheng has stirred.

634
01:26:10,028 --> 01:26:11,587
Greetings.

635
01:26:14,827 --> 01:26:16,834
Liu Sheng has stirred.

636
01:26:17,003 --> 01:26:18,857
You fool. It's me. The old beggar.

637
01:26:31,818 --> 01:26:36,575
-Is Liu Sheng alive?. Then fight him.
-He's dead now.

638
01:26:49,256 --> 01:26:50,532
My eyes!

639
01:26:57,191 --> 01:26:59,745
Easy. My legs aren't made of steel. Fool!

640
01:27:06,438 --> 01:27:07,747
What are you doing?.

641
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,496
Liu Sheng has saved me.

642
01:27:10,662 --> 01:27:12,450
Not Liu Sheng. I saved you.

643
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:23,355
Why didn't you save me again?.

644
01:27:23,525 --> 01:27:26,624
Save you?. I'll show you saving.

645
01:27:46,082 --> 01:27:49,148
He's back.

646
01:27:49,314 --> 01:27:51,418
Give me your hand.

647
01:28:21,982 --> 01:28:25,146
Chiang Kohung.

648
01:28:28,638 --> 01:28:30,973
Old beggar. Are you Chiang Kohung?.

649
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:40,856
Chiang Kohung. You're still alive.

650
01:28:49,148 --> 01:28:52,279
You killed Dada. My Dada.

651
01:28:52,444 --> 01:28:55,793
You killed Dada. My Dada.

652
01:29:25,209 --> 01:29:26,932
Dead at last.

653
01:29:27,097 --> 01:29:29,137
Lord Ganesh has sent you to me.

654
01:29:29,304 --> 01:29:31,093
Make me your disciple, o learned one.

655
01:29:31,255 --> 01:29:34,125
-You're under arrest.
-I want to be under you.

656
01:29:34,296 --> 01:29:35,703
Get off.

657
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:42,606
The murder weapon. The corpse.
The evidence.

658
01:29:42,774 --> 01:29:46,287
You're the killer. Straight to prison.
Case solved.

659
01:29:46,454 --> 01:29:49,487
-What case?.
-This case.

660
01:29:50,678 --> 01:29:53,012
You stay right here.

661
01:29:53,173 --> 01:29:55,115
I'm calling the police.

662
01:29:57,077 --> 01:29:58,801
Don't move.

663
01:30:03,604 --> 01:30:05,230
Odd fellow.

664
01:30:05,397 --> 01:30:07,982
He imagines he's a police officer.

665
01:30:28,114 --> 01:30:29,870
Opera?.

666
01:30:30,769 --> 01:30:31,882
Hello.

667
01:30:32,498 --> 01:30:34,440
I'm waiting behind the Opera.

668
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:37,104
I'm on my way.

669
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:00,137
Any word from Joey?.

670
01:31:02,063 --> 01:31:03,786
Go. Call him.

671
01:31:18,157 --> 01:31:19,880
The boss wants his specs.

672
01:31:52,969 --> 01:31:53,952
Sidhu.

673
01:32:16,648 --> 01:32:18,589
Give me my hat.

674
01:32:20,391 --> 01:32:22,462
Hurry up, idiot.

675
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:25,118
Run, Sidhu, run.

676
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:35,905
-What's going on?.
-Sidhu is alive.

677
01:32:36,069 --> 01:32:37,149
Hojo has gone after him.

678
01:32:55,907 --> 01:32:59,355
Stop right here.

679
01:33:00,387 --> 01:33:02,558
-Sidhu.
-Sidhu.

680
01:33:02,724 --> 01:33:05,025
Get in the car.

681
01:33:06,178 --> 01:33:09,822
You handle them. I'll follow Sidhu.

682
01:33:11,554 --> 01:33:13,342
Go, go.

683
01:34:08,701 --> 01:34:10,523
I'm trying to enjoy...

684
01:34:10,684 --> 01:34:12,789
...playing this game with you...

685
01:34:13,308 --> 01:34:14,769
...my friend.

686
01:34:26,587 --> 01:34:29,783
But the game is over. The winner is....

687
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:32,657
Meow Meow?.

688
01:34:36,634 --> 01:34:38,673
Come with me. Come on.

689
01:34:38,841 --> 01:34:40,215
Let go of me.

690
01:34:40,601 --> 01:34:44,856
Where are you dragging me,
Meow Meow?.

691
01:34:45,017 --> 01:34:47,405
I'm Miss TSM. Your Sakhi.

692
01:34:47,801 --> 01:34:49,743
Miss TSM?.

693
01:34:49,912 --> 01:34:52,279
The Chinese Consulate girl?.

694
01:34:52,472 --> 01:34:54,228
He's here. Come on!

695
01:34:55,032 --> 01:34:58,327
-Only one way to escape.
-That's suicide.

696
01:35:23,349 --> 01:35:28,945
Your eyes smiled at me

697
01:35:29,972 --> 01:35:35,056
Overwhelming my heart

698
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:40,840
Now I have found you, don 't go away

699
01:35:43,091 --> 01:35:46,538
Stay in my eyes
Sleep in my embrace

700
01:35:49,266 --> 01:35:52,746
These are the ways of love

701
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:55,696
Some magical encounters

702
01:35:55,858 --> 01:36:01,967
We meet, our hearts smile
The season changes

703
01:36:02,865 --> 01:36:09,575
Your smiling eyes

704
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:19,048
This is me and my twin, Suzy.

705
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:25,257
No wonder! I was so confused.

706
01:36:25,422 --> 01:36:32,132
A dark cloud hung over me
every time I saw your sister.

707
01:36:32,302 --> 01:36:35,301
But when I....

708
01:36:35,502 --> 01:36:39,657
When I see you....

709
01:36:39,821 --> 01:36:41,544
Look at me.

710
01:36:41,709 --> 01:36:46,760
When I see you, my heart floats.

711
01:36:46,924 --> 01:36:50,569
I feel like gliding away like a butterfly.

712
01:36:50,732 --> 01:36:52,161
Off to prison.

713
01:36:57,003 --> 01:37:01,509
Why are you hitting me?.
No prison for me. I have lots to do.

714
01:37:01,675 --> 01:37:05,569
You should be thanking me.
Your memory is back.

715
01:37:06,314 --> 01:37:11,235
Stop hitting me. You're not an inspector.
You're Chiang Kohung.

716
01:37:11,401 --> 01:37:12,646
Chiang?.

717
01:37:12,809 --> 01:37:14,948
Nothing but punches
since I arrived in China.

718
01:37:15,114 --> 01:37:16,358
Who's Chiang Kohung?.

719
01:37:25,033 --> 01:37:28,032
Chiang Kohung! Enough is enough. Stop!

720
01:37:31,849 --> 01:37:34,215
Where do you think you're going?.

721
01:37:37,063 --> 01:37:39,452
Why are you hitting me?.

722
01:38:27,619 --> 01:38:32,670
Sakhi. Sakhi. Sakhi.

723
01:38:41,472 --> 01:38:43,611
Sakhi.

724
01:38:44,256 --> 01:38:46,493
Hey. Hey.

725
01:38:48,832 --> 01:38:50,393
Dad?.

726
01:38:50,848 --> 01:38:51,863
Whose dad?.

727
01:38:52,031 --> 01:38:53,460
My daughter.

728
01:38:54,144 --> 01:38:55,932
Whose daughter?.

729
01:39:05,055 --> 01:39:06,516
Dad.

730
01:39:15,805 --> 01:39:17,780
Believe me. I've told you everything.

731
01:39:17,949 --> 01:39:19,094
I know nothing else.

732
01:39:19,262 --> 01:39:23,669
I'm a poor teahouse owner.
They came and wrecked my place.

733
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,682
The enemy is back.

734
01:39:40,986 --> 01:39:42,415
Sir, Hojo knows you're alive.

735
01:39:49,146 --> 01:39:51,383
He knows Sidhu--

736
01:39:53,211 --> 01:39:54,192
Let him go.

737
01:40:10,008 --> 01:40:11,797
Sidhu...

738
01:40:12,184 --> 01:40:13,231
...forgive me.

739
01:40:14,231 --> 01:40:15,311
Please?.

740
01:40:21,367 --> 01:40:23,821
I want to learn kung fu and karate.

741
01:40:25,527 --> 01:40:27,731
Be a master like you...

742
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,680
...and avenge Dada's murder.

743
01:40:30,774 --> 01:40:32,749
You want to learn kung fu?.

744
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:40,050
Take revenge, eh?. Against Hojo?.

745
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:44,812
Hojo has erased 20 years of my life.

746
01:40:44,981 --> 01:40:46,923
Leave the avenging to me.

747
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,679
-You relax.
-Should I go back to India?.

748
01:40:49,845 --> 01:40:51,438
Yes.

749
01:40:52,084 --> 01:40:54,222
Then I'll go back.

750
01:40:57,204 --> 01:41:00,651
When people ask, "Where's Dada?."
what do I say?.

751
01:41:01,171 --> 01:41:02,633
"Well, Dada's dead."

752
01:41:02,802 --> 01:41:05,552
"How come?."
"Because of me."

753
01:41:05,714 --> 01:41:09,773
"What did you do?."
"I sat by and watched."

754
01:41:24,849 --> 01:41:26,889
You relax, sir.

755
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,902
You have found your family...

756
01:41:30,064 --> 01:41:34,733
...but I will never find my Dada again.

757
01:41:34,896 --> 01:41:36,870
He has gone forever.

758
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:40,707
He died a dog's death
at the hands of Hojo.

759
01:41:41,423 --> 01:41:45,417
He came from Chandni Chowk
to show me he cared.

760
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:47,949
And Hojo slit his throat.

761
01:41:51,918 --> 01:41:54,187
I will have my revenge on Hojo.

762
01:41:54,351 --> 01:41:57,197
Hojo will kill him too.

763
01:42:01,453 --> 01:42:07,268
It's my fault, pinning my hopes on you.

764
01:42:07,437 --> 01:42:11,877
Dada always said,
"Don't count on anyone.

765
01:42:12,141 --> 01:42:15,337
Believe in yourself, Sidhu."

766
01:42:16,459 --> 01:42:18,499
And that's what I'll do from now.

767
01:42:19,724 --> 01:42:24,425
You watch. The world will watch.

768
01:42:24,651 --> 01:42:27,017
I'll kill Hojo.

769
01:42:27,466 --> 01:42:29,409
I'll do it alone.

770
01:42:41,993 --> 01:42:43,651
Dada.

771
01:42:52,168 --> 01:42:54,055
Why are you here?.

772
01:42:54,216 --> 01:42:56,071
Your training starts tomorrow.

773
01:43:22,693 --> 01:43:24,449
What's this?.

774
01:43:24,901 --> 01:43:25,980
What's wrong?.

775
01:43:26,149 --> 01:43:29,498
FIying to the moon?. You clown.

776
01:43:29,668 --> 01:43:33,017
Don't teach me any old rubbish.

777
01:43:33,188 --> 01:43:34,300
I want to learn kung fu.

778
01:43:34,468 --> 01:43:38,112
Be the best, not second best. Get it?.

779
01:43:42,339 --> 01:43:45,241
I want to learn kung fu, not tickling.

780
01:43:49,123 --> 01:43:51,675
Cosmos Thumb. My special move.

781
01:43:52,737 --> 01:43:55,356
Untouched outside. Pieces within.

782
01:43:58,145 --> 01:44:02,073
I want to learn Cosmos Kung Fu.

783
01:44:03,138 --> 01:44:05,855
There's an old Shaolin saying:

784
01:44:06,401 --> 01:44:12,248
"Fear not
the 1 0,000 moves practiced once.

785
01:44:13,408 --> 01:44:18,677
Fear the single move
practiced 1 0,000 times."

786
01:44:18,848 --> 01:44:23,801
Look within you, Sidhu.
Have you such a move?.

787
01:44:24,352 --> 01:44:28,279
A move you've known since childhood...

788
01:44:28,478 --> 01:44:31,446
...that no one can match.

789
01:44:32,223 --> 01:44:35,037
Everyone has such a move.

790
01:44:38,717 --> 01:44:41,652
A move that's second nature to you.

791
01:44:42,461 --> 01:44:47,960
Your own kung fu will help you
the day you challenge Hojo.

792
01:44:49,244 --> 01:44:50,553
Tell me.

793
01:44:52,668 --> 01:44:56,694
I eat and drink every day.

794
01:44:56,955 --> 01:45:00,948
I chop vegetables.
I bathe, I wash. That's it.

795
01:45:03,739 --> 01:45:06,935
Training you
will probably drive me crazy again.

796
01:45:10,362 --> 01:45:11,345
Masterji.

797
01:45:11,514 --> 01:45:14,678
No arrows, no swords
No weapons, no bullets

798
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:19,598
You are your own army
You are your own force

799
01:45:31,897 --> 01:45:33,871
Is this kung fu?.

800
01:45:34,039 --> 01:45:37,934
If it is, then every Indian woman
who rolls bread is better than Bruce Lee.

801
01:45:38,104 --> 01:45:41,649
I rolled bread in India. Now here too.

802
01:45:41,815 --> 01:45:45,163
Tell me, daughter.
What was life like when you were 4?.

803
01:45:45,335 --> 01:45:48,117
Four?. How can I remember, Dad?.

804
01:45:48,278 --> 01:45:52,533
Take your time.
We have nothing but time on our hands.

805
01:45:52,694 --> 01:45:56,339
Let me fill you in.
She drank milk when she was 4.

806
01:45:56,502 --> 01:45:59,698
I'm over 27, and still making bread.

807
01:46:20,435 --> 01:46:22,377
Wow, delicious.

808
01:46:24,467 --> 01:46:29,998
-Can I have another bread?.
-Another?. I'm breaking my back here.

809
01:46:30,162 --> 01:46:32,267
Enough is enough.

810
01:46:32,594 --> 01:46:35,277
Wait, I'll do it. Okay, enjoy the bread.

811
01:46:37,745 --> 01:46:38,792
Now for the next move.

812
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:46,727
The next move?.

813
01:46:46,896 --> 01:46:51,598
If you weren't Sakhi's father,
I'd shove this you know where.

814
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:58,953
I've chopped vegetables all my life.
Now you teach me to roll bread.

815
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:03,014
I want to learn kung fu.
Will you teach me or not?.

816
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:05,165
Here's some kung fu for you.

817
01:47:08,687 --> 01:47:10,378
Why are you hitting me?.

818
01:47:12,686 --> 01:47:15,752
This is called Iron Forearm Kung Fu.

819
01:47:17,197 --> 01:47:22,379
I smashed it. Like the star Dara Singh.
I'm a kung fu master.

820
01:47:22,765 --> 01:47:25,798
Put everything behind you
And forge ahead

821
01:47:25,965 --> 01:47:30,307
The enemy will run for cover
If you use your might

822
01:47:34,508 --> 01:47:36,167
Higher.

823
01:47:41,899 --> 01:47:44,582
I've mastered Iron Forearm.

824
01:47:44,747 --> 01:47:49,416
Soon I'll master Iron Legs, Iron Chest...

825
01:47:49,578 --> 01:47:52,774
...Iron Stomach and Iron--

826
01:47:53,771 --> 01:47:54,785
Enough.

827
01:47:56,010 --> 01:48:00,678
Don't stop me.
My body has turned to iron.

828
01:48:01,481 --> 01:48:03,205
My iron man.

829
01:48:03,369 --> 01:48:05,671
Let's go for an iron kiss.

830
01:48:08,489 --> 01:48:10,015
A ticket for India?.

831
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:15,172
Rusty iron is of little use to anyone.

832
01:48:15,336 --> 01:48:18,370
Hojo isn't my enemy. You are.

833
01:48:19,879 --> 01:48:22,368
I know. Stay away from her.

834
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:36,477
Enough?. Can I get down?.

835
01:48:37,221 --> 01:48:38,847
Higher.

836
01:48:45,029 --> 01:48:46,490
Okay?.

837
01:48:47,236 --> 01:48:49,854
Do you want me to call on God?.

838
01:48:50,021 --> 01:48:51,100
Dad, he'll fall.

839
01:48:51,268 --> 01:48:55,937
-No more training then.
-Never mind, Sakhi. Your father is a tyrant.

840
01:49:00,164 --> 01:49:03,511
-I see a bird's nest. Okay?.
-Jump.

841
01:49:03,683 --> 01:49:06,433
What?. Did you say "thump?."

842
01:49:06,819 --> 01:49:10,201
-I said, jump.
-Impossible. Stop joking.

843
01:49:10,723 --> 01:49:12,282
Joking?.

844
01:49:16,225 --> 01:49:17,632
Wow!

845
01:49:18,082 --> 01:49:23,384
You're a clown. Hojo will die of laughter
when he watches your moves.

846
01:49:28,417 --> 01:49:33,021
Fall from any height
without breaking a limb.

847
01:49:33,185 --> 01:49:34,940
Land like a feather.

848
01:49:35,392 --> 01:49:37,464
Jump.

849
01:49:37,632 --> 01:49:39,420
I'm jumping.

850
01:49:39,584 --> 01:49:41,471
You're hopeless.

851
01:49:41,632 --> 01:49:43,387
Go back to Chandni Chowk.

852
01:49:43,935 --> 01:49:45,758
Just make your way home.

853
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:51,384
-Sakhi, pack his bags.
-No, I'll jump.

854
01:50:02,974 --> 01:50:06,235
Sakhi. Sakhi. Sakhi.

855
01:50:06,396 --> 01:50:09,561
Forging metal turns it to gold
Turn your body to steel

856
01:50:09,724 --> 01:50:13,847
Be brave and even God will bet on you

857
01:50:17,244 --> 01:50:20,692
Let embers smolder

858
01:50:20,859 --> 01:50:23,794
Let diamonds dazzle

859
01:50:24,411 --> 01:50:27,094
Do it!
Today's the day

860
01:50:35,098 --> 01:50:36,439
It's beyond you.

861
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:59,629
Your growl echoes like the roar of a lion

862
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:04,916
You are no less than a tall mountain

863
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:17,492
Wrestle the fiercest waves

864
01:51:17,941 --> 01:51:21,356
Stop the raging storm

865
01:51:21,525 --> 01:51:25,037
Do it!
Today's the day

866
01:51:35,509 --> 01:51:39,021
In the face of danger, show your might
The might of force

867
01:51:39,188 --> 01:51:42,636
Your goal is nearing you
Show your might

868
01:52:15,088 --> 01:52:18,404
Do it!
Today's the day

869
01:52:36,302 --> 01:52:42,826
If you so desire

870
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:48,553
You can conquer the world

871
01:52:57,324 --> 01:53:03,040
Just believe in yourself

872
01:53:08,395 --> 01:53:15,105
Dada!

873
01:53:23,081 --> 01:53:26,245
Sidhu was trained and ready.

874
01:53:26,697 --> 01:53:29,861
Hojo got his diamonds back...

875
01:53:30,024 --> 01:53:33,505
...and Chopstick
was still spying for Sakhi.

876
01:53:40,871 --> 01:53:42,333
Frankie.

877
01:53:44,263 --> 01:53:45,921
Ship out the diamonds.

878
01:53:56,486 --> 01:53:58,046
Chopstick has sent news.

879
01:54:34,178 --> 01:54:35,519
See you at the harbor.

880
01:54:40,801 --> 01:54:43,452
Make sure no outsiders here.

881
01:54:43,617 --> 01:54:45,722
-Good morning, sir.
-What?.

882
01:54:50,369 --> 01:54:52,637
Hello.

883
01:55:31,068 --> 01:55:35,640
Not his shoulder. Hit his chest. Like this.

884
01:55:44,476 --> 01:55:47,443
-What move was that?.
-The Wild Bull.

885
01:55:57,978 --> 01:55:59,222
You keep at it.

886
01:56:00,442 --> 01:56:01,969
I'll sit and watch.

887
01:56:07,962 --> 01:56:10,230
No good. Six out of 1 0.

888
01:56:11,833 --> 01:56:13,621
I'm busting a gut here...

889
01:56:16,984 --> 01:56:18,707
...and you're unimpressed.

890
01:56:21,176 --> 01:56:22,998
From Chandni Chowk to China

891
01:56:28,534 --> 01:56:31,795
Look at my face
Plain and simple

892
01:56:31,959 --> 01:56:35,220
They say I'm a king, not a pauper

893
01:56:36,374 --> 01:56:38,229
Don't use your hand to stop traffic.

894
01:56:39,542 --> 01:56:42,706
Stop the enemy's heart.

895
01:56:43,317 --> 01:56:46,666
-Get it?. You lazy fool!
-Lazy fool?.

896
01:57:15,890 --> 01:57:17,319
-Sidhu!
-What?.

897
01:57:21,457 --> 01:57:23,214
Don't move, or he dies.

898
01:57:23,890 --> 01:57:25,416
The same old dialogue.

899
01:57:26,865 --> 01:57:30,028
"Don't move, or he dies,"
et cetera, et cetera.

900
01:57:30,193 --> 01:57:33,902
Sidhu, my day of reckoning has come.

901
01:57:34,064 --> 01:57:37,064
Master, you have great powers,
and are all-knowing.

902
01:57:37,233 --> 01:57:39,654
-Your predictions come true.
-Stop.

903
01:57:39,824 --> 01:57:41,416
Kill him. Don't worry about me.

904
01:57:41,584 --> 01:57:44,454
You worry me the least.

905
01:57:44,623 --> 01:57:47,306
Stop, or he dies.

906
01:57:47,471 --> 01:57:48,933
You stopped.

907
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:51,470
I knew you cared for me deep down.

908
01:57:51,631 --> 01:57:54,729
No way. A question for you.
Must I immerse your ashes in the Ganges...

909
01:57:54,894 --> 01:57:56,749
...or in a Chinese river?. Well?.

910
01:57:56,910 --> 01:58:00,521
Let's split your remains.
Ashes here, urn there.

911
01:58:00,685 --> 01:58:03,172
Finish him off.

912
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:07,753
Sidhu, forgive me. I touch your feet.

913
01:58:08,716 --> 01:58:10,888
Cosmic Thumb.

914
01:58:13,965 --> 01:58:15,819
Touch my feet, then.

915
01:58:43,914 --> 01:58:47,426
In the face of danger, show your might

916
01:58:47,593 --> 01:58:51,171
Your goal is nearing you
Show your might

917
01:58:51,336 --> 01:58:54,304
Let your breath be your guide

918
01:58:54,473 --> 01:58:58,084
Let your feelings show

919
01:58:58,248 --> 01:59:00,636
Do it!
Today's the day

920
01:59:09,223 --> 01:59:15,932
If you so desire
You can conquer the world

921
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:23,260
Just believe in yourself

922
01:59:24,453 --> 01:59:26,460
That's new.

923
01:59:26,725 --> 01:59:27,706
Cosmic Kick.

924
01:59:27,877 --> 01:59:28,860
Thank you.

925
01:59:30,853 --> 01:59:31,998
Nine and a half.

926
01:59:32,165 --> 01:59:33,147
Thank you, thank you.

927
01:59:33,317 --> 01:59:36,164
Only nine and a half?. You old man!

928
01:59:46,627 --> 01:59:49,442
Hojo heard a familiar voice on the phone.

929
01:59:49,603 --> 01:59:52,124
A voice he had not heard for 20 years.

930
01:59:52,290 --> 01:59:55,705
Hojo was promised the return of his son
in exchange of--

931
01:59:55,874 --> 01:59:57,433
Meow Meow.

932
01:59:58,978 --> 02:00:02,523
Time you know the truth
about your father.

933
02:00:25,695 --> 02:00:27,288
Hojo' s men are everywhere.

934
02:01:39,351 --> 02:01:42,996
Suzy. I want you to know I'm your--

935
02:02:09,269 --> 02:02:11,690
This is for my father.

936
02:02:19,476 --> 02:02:23,948
You killed my father.
You destroyed my family.

937
02:03:00,304 --> 02:03:02,213
Sidhu!

938
02:03:21,293 --> 02:03:23,017
Attack!

939
02:04:07,977 --> 02:04:09,602
Why did Suzy stab you?.

940
02:04:09,769 --> 02:04:13,663
No, it's all Hojo's ruthless scheming.

941
02:04:13,833 --> 02:04:18,654
Suzy believes I murdered her father.

942
02:04:18,824 --> 02:04:20,864
Sidhu, where to?.

943
02:04:21,032 --> 02:04:23,682
To where it all began.

944
02:04:28,775 --> 02:04:32,965
-He's my father, isn't he?.
-He's a foe.

945
02:04:33,127 --> 02:04:35,166
It was now clear to Meow Meow.

946
02:04:35,526 --> 02:04:38,210
Hojo had kept the truth from her.

947
02:05:07,875 --> 02:05:14,138
We made a big mistake.
You're not a reincarnation of Liu Sheng.

948
02:05:14,307 --> 02:05:18,976
You don't owe us anything.
You had better go.

949
02:05:30,497 --> 02:05:36,476
Tell him to leave.
We know he isn't Liu Sheng.

950
02:05:36,864 --> 02:05:42,330
Sidhu, they say they made a big mistake.
You aren't Liu Sheng.

951
02:05:42,497 --> 02:05:48,922
The village is their problem, not yours.
They say, "Return to Chandni Chowk."

952
02:05:54,303 --> 02:05:56,408
I may not be Liu Sheng...

953
02:05:57,758 --> 02:06:00,440
...but now they are my own people.

954
02:06:01,982 --> 02:06:06,804
So what if I was a mosquito
or Liu Sheng in a previous birth?.

955
02:06:07,613 --> 02:06:09,784
My purpose in this lifetime...

956
02:06:11,676 --> 02:06:14,393
...is to destroy Hojo.

957
02:06:54,585 --> 02:06:56,079
Lord Ganesh.

958
02:06:57,272 --> 02:07:00,206
Today I'll fight alone.

959
02:07:01,048 --> 02:07:02,836
Just me.

960
02:07:03,959 --> 02:07:08,302
Lord, you've always been on my side,
and always will be.

961
02:09:26,729 --> 02:09:31,137
-Where are you going?.
-Hojo is here. I'm all right.

962
02:09:32,553 --> 02:09:34,440
I have both your daughters now.

963
02:09:35,464 --> 02:09:37,471
Stop right there.

964
02:09:39,112 --> 02:09:41,021
Who will stop me?.

965
02:09:46,952 --> 02:09:48,358
I will.

966
02:10:00,198 --> 02:10:02,020
You traitor!

967
02:10:12,326 --> 02:10:15,456
One of my daughters goes after me.

968
02:10:39,395 --> 02:10:40,769
Papa.

969
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:18,894
Suzy...

970
02:12:19,672 --> 02:12:20,817
...Sidhu will fight alone.

971
02:12:35,607 --> 02:12:37,941
Liu Sheng. Ready for your next rebirth?.

972
02:12:46,518 --> 02:12:48,340
Sidhu.

973
02:12:52,182 --> 02:12:53,359
Dada?.

974
02:12:53,525 --> 02:12:59,275
The time of promises is over
Seize the day

975
02:12:59,445 --> 02:13:05,107
Learn the wisdom of action

976
02:13:06,004 --> 02:13:12,714
Take what belongs to you

977
02:13:14,322 --> 02:13:20,137
Never beg for what is rightfully yours

978
02:13:21,618 --> 02:13:24,040
So you still believe God is in the potato?.

979
02:13:24,242 --> 02:13:29,063
God only helps those
who help themselves.

980
02:13:31,121 --> 02:13:33,063
Believe in yourself, Sidhu.

981
02:13:39,696 --> 02:13:44,005
Your destiny isn't in your palm lines.
It's in your might.

982
02:13:44,783 --> 02:13:46,572
Know your true self.

983
02:13:48,975 --> 02:13:52,390
Chop them down like corn and carrots.

984
02:13:54,063 --> 02:13:55,819
Destroy them!

985
02:14:00,271 --> 02:14:01,765
Get up, Sidhu.

986
02:14:01,934 --> 02:14:03,210
Please.

987
02:14:05,550 --> 02:14:06,531
Sidhu.

988
02:14:08,718 --> 02:14:10,473
Sidhu.

989
02:14:11,694 --> 02:14:16,614
Fear not 1 0,000 moves practiced once.

990
02:14:16,781 --> 02:14:21,057
Fear a single move
practiced 1 0,000 times.

991
02:14:23,468 --> 02:14:25,378
Look within yourself, Sidhu.

992
02:14:25,548 --> 02:14:29,475
Your destiny is not in your palm lines.
It's in your might.

993
02:14:29,963 --> 02:14:34,665
Do you have a unique move
that none can match?.

994
02:14:37,195 --> 02:14:38,755
Know your true self.

995
02:14:38,922 --> 02:14:40,962
That move is within you, Sidhu.

996
02:14:41,130 --> 02:14:43,847
Chop them like corn and carrots.

997
02:14:44,010 --> 02:14:46,727
That move is within you, Sidhu.

998
02:14:47,625 --> 02:14:48,673
Destroy them!

999
02:14:52,136 --> 02:14:57,221
Sidhu, look within.
Do you know such a move?.

1000
02:14:58,440 --> 02:15:01,058
Do you have such a move, Sidhu?.

1001
02:16:10,849 --> 02:16:12,343
A potato?.

1002
02:16:16,577 --> 02:16:20,373
You're laughing?. You're done for.

1003
02:16:31,007 --> 02:16:35,261
The man with hesitant steps
Is now steady

1004
02:16:44,414 --> 02:16:48,636
Making the impossible possible

1005
02:16:48,797 --> 02:16:53,467
He is a new man

1006
02:16:55,964 --> 02:16:59,259
-Liu Sheng.
-Sidhu.

1007
02:16:59,421 --> 02:17:01,809
Sidhu! Sidhu! Sidhu!

1008
02:17:09,594 --> 02:17:12,497
Now watch my Indian kung fu.

1009
02:17:12,668 --> 02:17:16,661
The kung fu that I learned
in Chandni Chowk's lanes.

1010
02:17:18,811 --> 02:17:22,836
That kung fu that all Indian women practice
as they chop vegetables.

1011
02:17:23,002 --> 02:17:24,376
That kung fu--

1012
02:17:25,082 --> 02:17:27,831
His name is Sidhu

1013
02:17:42,425 --> 02:17:46,516
Bread. All shapes and sizes,
with cheese or radishes?.

1014
02:17:47,735 --> 02:17:49,677
Shall I repeat the menu for you?.

1015
02:17:50,871 --> 02:17:53,773
Bread. All shapes and sizes,
with cheese or radishes?.

1016
02:18:00,151 --> 02:18:03,827
Will I serve you up as a potato dumpling?.

1017
02:18:05,014 --> 02:18:06,126
Sidhu!

1018
02:18:27,667 --> 02:18:31,016
Why so quiet?. Cheer me on!

1019
02:18:31,187 --> 02:18:33,805
Sidhu! Sidhu! Sidhu!

1020
02:18:54,961 --> 02:18:59,947
He sees big dreams
He does great deeds

1021
02:19:00,112 --> 02:19:03,690
The Delhi dreamer
Is now China 's champ

1022
02:19:04,304 --> 02:19:06,922
The potato of the day...

1023
02:19:27,598 --> 02:19:29,932
...is cut to size.

1024
02:19:34,893 --> 02:19:39,681
And that's how Sidhu--
Liu Sheng ended Hojo 's days.

1025
02:19:39,852 --> 02:19:43,562
How long could the great Liu Sheng
tolerate tyranny?

1026
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:46,057
His spirit can rest in peace now.

1027
02:19:46,348 --> 02:19:50,025
Happy days have returned
to Zhange village.

1028
02:19:50,188 --> 02:19:52,456
With Dada 's blessings...

1029
02:19:52,620 --> 02:19:56,613
...Sidhu champions a charming cheer
from Chandni Chowk to China.

1030
02:19:56,779 --> 02:20:01,033
Inspector Chiang was at last reunited
with his daughters.

1031
02:20:01,194 --> 02:20:05,122
Chopstick was delighted to discover
his Chinese roots.

1032
02:20:05,290 --> 02:20:08,388
But Sidhu warned him:
No more conning!

1033
02:20:09,257 --> 02:20:11,591
What's this?

1034
02:20:12,809 --> 02:20:14,216
What's wrong?.

1035
02:20:22,280 --> 02:20:23,621
Sidhu.

1036
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,309
Sidhu?.

1037
02:20:26,472 --> 02:20:30,432
They say they have a big problem
in their village.

1038
02:20:30,599 --> 02:20:36,000
I'm no troubleshooter.
How come you understand them?.

1039
02:20:36,967 --> 02:20:39,618
-Sidhu, I lied to you.
-About what?.

1040
02:20:39,783 --> 02:20:43,492
-My mother wasn't from China.
-Africa?.

1041
02:20:43,654 --> 02:20:45,628
From Chandni Chowk to Africa

1042
02:20:45,797 --> 02:20:48,612
TO BE
CONTINUED

1043
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:57,693
This is Akshay Kumar
of Gopal Apartments.

1044
02:20:57,860 --> 02:21:01,242
Paratha Lane. Red Fort.
Chandni Chowk. Delhi 6.

1045
02:21:01,412 --> 02:21:06,398
Now I sing a fun song for you.
1 01 rupees is my reward.

1046
02:21:06,564 --> 02:21:09,281
Listen. Ears wide open.

1047
02:21:09,444 --> 02:21:15,967
Where to?
O pretty cauliflower

1048
02:21:16,132 --> 02:21:19,676
Cut it out.
Time for the beat to kick in.

1049
02:24:06,482 --> 02:24:09,133
Enough. We're off to Chandni Chowk.

1050
02:24:09,298 --> 02:24:11,207
It's a wrap.

1051
02:24:12,177 --> 02:24:13,457
He is Liu Sheng, reborn.

1052
02:24:13,457 --> 02:24:15,057
[ENGLISH]
He is Liu Sheng, reborn.

1053
02:24:15,057 --> 02:24:15,373
