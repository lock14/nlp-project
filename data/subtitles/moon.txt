1
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:32,851
<i>There was
a time when energy was a dirty word.</i>

2
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:35,854
<i>When turning on
your lights was a hard choice.</i>

3
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,356
<i>Cities in brownout.</i>

4
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,606
<i>Food shortages.</i>

5
00:00:38,692 --> 00:00:40,692
<i>Cars burning fuel to run.</i>

6
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,695
<i>But that was the past.</i>

7
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,070
<i>Where are we now?</i>

8
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:46,573
<i>How do we make the world so much better?</i>

9
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,408
<i>Make deserts bloom?</i>

10
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:53,746
<i>Right now, we're the largest producer of
fusion energy in the world.</i>

11
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:56,125
<i>The energy of the sun trapped in rock,</i>

12
00:00:56,209 --> 00:00:59,460
<i>harvested by machine
from the far side of the moon.</i>

13
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:03,340
<i>Today, we deliver enough
clean-burning helium-3</i>

14
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:06,968
<i>to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70% of the planet.</i>

15
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:09,555
<i>Who'd have thought?</i>

16
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:11,515
<i>All the energy
we ever needed,</i>

17
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,474
<i>right above our heads.</i>

18
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,688
<i>The power of the moon.</i>

19
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,731
<i>The power of our future.</i>

20
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,599
Rock and roll. 8:32 Pacific Time.

21
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:38,644
All Harvesters running smoothly.

22
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,145
Readouts are as follows.

23
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,399
Matthew, 14.6 miles.

24
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:46,944
Mark, 16.8 miles. I...

25
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:58,622
Hey, Gerty. Gerty. We gotta...

26
00:02:58,956 --> 00:03:00,957
<i>Good morning, Sam.</i>

27
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:02,626
We got a live one on Mark.

28
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,502
I'm gonna go out now and rope her in.

29
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:05,962
<i>Okay, Sam.</i>

30
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:03,645
<i>I want chocolate.</i>

31
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,149
<i>I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.</i>

32
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:19,711
<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

33
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,711
<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

34
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,591
<i>Signal failure on long-range comms.</i>

35
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:49,750
<i>Sam Bell reporting
to Central. 10:14 Pacific Time.</i>

36
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,298
<i>I've got a full container
of helium-3 ready to roll.</i>

37
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:57,134
<i>By the time this message reaches you,
it should be in transit.</i>

38
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:59,677
<i>Otherwise, everything running smoothly.</i>

39
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:02,889
How are things down there?

40
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:05,975
You guys been to any

41
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,021
good parties or anything?

42
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:12,565
Oh, thanks for the football feed.

43
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:16,278
It almost felt live... Almost.

44
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:20,490
But three years is a long haul, you know.

45
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:24,995
It's way, way, way, way, way too long.

46
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm talking to myself on a regular basis.

47
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,627
So...

48
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:34,713
Time to go home, you know what I mean?

49
00:06:35,548 --> 00:06:37,466
That's it. Over and out.

50
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,134
Rock and roll. God bless America.

51
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,572
<i>I can do that for you, Sam.</i>

52
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:07,579
God damn it. I said I got it.

53
00:07:07,663 --> 00:07:09,706
Why don't you listen to me?

54
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:20,759
<i>Ready for launch.</i>

55
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:45,199
<i>Sam, is everything okay?</i>

56
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:50,372
<i>- Sam?</i>
- What?

57
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:53,500
<i>You don't seem
like yourself today.</i>

58
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:54,918
<i>- Has something happened?</i>
- You know...

59
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:58,338
Can you turn that off?
Please. Jesus Christ.

60
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,884
<i>Sam, it might help you
to talk about it.</i>

61
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:10,266
Gerty, have you heard anything new
about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?

62
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,393
<i>No, Sam.</i>

63
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:15,814
<i>What I understand is it's fairly low on
the company's priority list right now.</i>

64
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:18,733
You tell them to sort that out, you
know what I'm talking about?

65
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:21,819
That's not...
I've only got two weeks,

66
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:25,449
but it's not fair
to whoever is coming up here next.

67
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:29,036
<i>I will, Sam. Do you want me to finish
cutting your hair later?</i>

68
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,413
No, come on,
let's finish this.

69
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:35,667
Another one
of those headaches.

70
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:39,379
Gerty, can you give me something for it?

71
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,445
<i>Message received
from your wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.</i>

72
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:06,865
Fuck.

73
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:16,291
<i>Hi, Sam. It's me.</i>

74
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,379
<i>I got your last message.</i>

75
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:23,590
<i>It was really good
to hear your voice.</i>

76
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:25,258
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

77
00:09:26,594 --> 00:09:29,136
<i>I know you're really lonely up there,</i>

78
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:31,431
<i>but I think,</i>

79
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:34,809
<i>in a lot of ways,
it's been really good for you.</i>

80
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:37,104
<i>For both of us.</i>

81
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:40,981
<i>God, I hope you don't
mind me saying that.</i>

82
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,821
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

83
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,490
<i>Someone's got something to say.</i>

84
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:54,703
<i>What did you want to
say to Daddy, baby?</i>

85
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:57,581
<i>Say, astronaut.</i>

86
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,043
<i>Astronaut, Daddy.</i>

87
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:05,923
<i>Who's an astronaut?
Daddy's an astronaut. Say it really loudly.</i>

88
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:08,051
<i>Daddy's an astronaut.</i>

89
00:10:09,052 --> 00:10:11,096
<i>Clever girl. Wave.</i>

90
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,681
<i>Give Daddy a wave.</i>

91
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:15,975
<i>Kathy, could you...</i>

92
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,523
<i>I can't believe you're
going to be home soon.</i>

93
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,734
<i>It's her birthday next month.</i>

94
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:27,903
<i>And I was thinking
about maybe a playhouse for the garden.</i>

95
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:30,490
- Gerty.
<i>- We could pick it out together.</i>

96
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,366
<i>Sam.</i>

97
00:10:33,536 --> 00:10:34,952
<i>I love you.</i>

98
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:37,456
I love you.

99
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:38,623
<i>And I miss you.</i>

100
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:40,082
I miss you.

101
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:43,669
<i>And I can't wait to see you.</i>

102
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:47,215
<i>Okay, sweetheart. Bye.</i>

103
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:14,783
<i>Hi, Doug.</i>

104
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:19,163
You're really full of yourself,
aren't you, Doug?

105
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,041
Kathryn.

106
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,144
Not good.

107
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,437
<i>What about Dumbo?</i>

108
00:11:43,523 --> 00:11:46,232
<i>Doesn't he object to your...</i>

109
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,860
<i>Yes. Darrin objects.</i>

110
00:11:48,945 --> 00:11:51,988
<i>But it's a special
occasion because of the morning light.</i>

111
00:12:27,316 --> 00:12:30,442
Ah, fuck! God damn it!

112
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:32,571
Fuck!

113
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,491
It's gotta smart, doesn't it, Gerty?

114
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:40,495
<i>Sam, can I ask how it happened?</i>

115
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,000
I told you, I saw something on TV and
I spilled boiling water on my hand.

116
00:12:45,293 --> 00:12:47,418
<i>You saw something on TV?</i>

117
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:49,921
Yeah, I saw something
on TV that distracted me.

118
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:52,173
Is there something wrong with that, Gerty?

119
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:55,176
<i>Sam, you said
it was the TV that distracted you.</i>

120
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,596
<i>But when I came in,
the TV wasn't on.</i>

121
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,097
<i>Perhaps you were imagining things.</i>

122
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:05,352
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

123
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:10,482
You need to get laid.
I'm going to go back to work.

124
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,027
<i>I am the one and only</i>

125
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,322
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

126
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,580
Okay. Shut up.

127
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,115
Morning, Gerty.

128
00:14:41,491 --> 00:14:43,409
<i>Morning, Sam.
How are you today?</i>

129
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:45,286
Fine. Fine.

130
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:48,331
<i>- How's the hand?</i>
- Oh, it's a little sore.

131
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:50,375
Little sore. It's okay.

132
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:54,044
What's for breakfast?

133
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,587
<i>The usual.</i>

134
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:02,595
<i>Two weeks to go, Sam.</i>

135
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,639
Two weeks to go, buddy.

136
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:08,143
<i>Would you like
some hot sauce on your beans?</i>

137
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:11,312
No, my tummy's a little tender, actually.

138
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:15,357
But thank you. Thank you, Gerty.

139
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,192
<i>You're welcome, Sam.</i>

140
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:19,403
8:19 Pacific Time.

141
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:24,158
Readouts are as follows.
Matthew, 9.8 miles.

142
00:15:24,994 --> 00:15:27,453
Mark is nine...

143
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,663
<i>Hey, Gerty...</i>

144
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:31,291
<i>Rock and roll.</i>

145
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:44,763
Mark...

146
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,765
Mark's 11 miles on the button.

147
00:15:50,894 --> 00:15:53,145
Luke's a little twitchy today.

148
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,119
Hey, Gerty,

149
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:10,538
looks like
we got a live one out on Matthew.

150
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,498
<i>I'm gonna go out in a few minutes.</i>

151
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,250
<i>I'm just going to finish my coffee, okay?</i>

152
00:16:15,336 --> 00:16:16,668
<i>Okay, Sam.</i>

153
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:24,510
<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

154
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:30,057
<i>Signal failure on long-range comms.</i>

155
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:42,171
<i>Danger. Atmospheric compromise.</i>

156
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:16,204
Where am...

157
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:18,249
Where am I?

158
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:22,461
<i>Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.</i>

159
00:18:22,546 --> 00:18:24,756
<i>Do you remember what happened?</i>

160
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,846
No, I don't...
I don't remember a thing.

161
00:18:34,892 --> 00:18:36,392
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

162
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,646
Yeah, of course I remember you, Gerty.

163
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,023
<i>That's good. That's very good.</i>

164
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:45,484
<i>It's nice to see you awake again.</i>

165
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:48,403
<i>I'd like to keep you
under observation here in the Infirmary</i>

166
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,990
<i>for a few days and run some tests.</i>

167
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:55,077
How long have I been out?

168
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:58,373
<i>Not long, Sam.
Go back to sleep.</i>

169
00:18:58,457 --> 00:18:59,707
Okay, bro.

170
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,086
<i>You're still very tired.
We can talk later.</i>

171
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,417
Hello?

172
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:12,238
<i>...good working order, but we only have
two working Harvesters now.</i>

173
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,614
Come on, come on.

174
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,782
<i>Yeah, well, that's no surprise,
but it's not good enough.</i>

175
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:18,536
<i>Gerty, we're gonna
have to find a way to ramp up production</i>

176
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,413
<i>- on Mark and John.
- I know.</i>

177
00:20:20,497 --> 00:20:24,500
<i>This is incredible. How do you manage
to fucking break a Harvester</i>

178
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:26,711
<i>and an employee, all in the same day?</i>

179
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:29,963
<i>These were extraordinary
circumstances, as you know.</i>

180
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:32,549
<i>Gerty, what's the status on Harvester 3?</i>

181
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:34,301
<i>How are the repairs going ahead?</i>

182
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:37,721
<i>- Sam. You're out of bed.</i>
- Yeah.

183
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,517
I wanted to stretch my legs. Who was that?

184
00:20:44,354 --> 00:20:46,897
<i>We've been having
some problems with the Lunar Sat,</i>

185
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:49,107
<i>and our live feed seems to be down.</i>

186
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:51,736
<i>I was recording
a video message for Central,</i>

187
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:54,072
<i>updating them on your progress.</i>

188
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:56,699
<i>Sam, you need to stay in bed.</i>

189
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,992
<i>You're not ready to walk around yet.</i>

190
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:01,662
All right.

191
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:04,999
Could you give me
my sunglasses? It's really bright in here.

192
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,086
Give me my...

193
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,421
Give me all my stuff, you know.

194
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,839
<i>Your belongings are in your quarters, Sam.</i>

195
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:15,968
- Well, bring it in here.
<i>- Certainly.</i>

196
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,272
<i>Excellent, Sam.</i>

197
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,111
What...

198
00:21:33,987 --> 00:21:35,570
When can I get out of here, Gerty?

199
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:38,532
<i>Sam, you may have
suffered from brain damage in the crash.</i>

200
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:42,577
<i>This would explain your slight memory loss
and logic impairment.</i>

201
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:47,333
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?

202
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,876
<i>Central has asked me to
slow down the Harvesters</i>

203
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:53,131
<i>to ensure you have time
to recuperate and get your strength back.</i>

204
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:56,299
That's terrific. It's fantastic.

205
00:21:56,384 --> 00:21:58,719
<i>You can return to
the sleeping quarters tomorrow,</i>

206
00:21:58,804 --> 00:22:00,346
<i>but it will still be a few more days</i>

207
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,182
<i>before you can resume
anything like a normal work schedule.</i>

208
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,479
<i>- Let's try another test.</i>
- I don't want to try another test.

209
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:09,939
<i>Please, Sam.</i>

210
00:22:38,093 --> 00:22:39,676
Hey, Gerty.

211
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,640
You know about this?

212
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:48,769
Matthew's got
no velocity readout. He's completely still.

213
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:50,270
<i>He must have stalled.</i>

214
00:22:50,355 --> 00:22:51,439
Well, he's obviously stalled.

215
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:53,441
Don't you think
we should tell Central?

216
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:56,027
Unlock the doors and I'll go fix it.

217
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:58,153
<i>I'll pass on your message.</i>

218
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,655
<i>Message received
from Earth via Jupiter link.</i>

219
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,156
<i>Sam, we appreciate the offer,</i>

220
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:45,409
<i>but you concentrate on feeling better.</i>

221
00:23:45,493 --> 00:23:48,746
<i>Hey, we don't want you to take
any unnecessary risks.</i>

222
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:51,707
<i>- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.</i>

223
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,041
<i>That is an order.</i>

224
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,919
<i>It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.</i>

225
00:23:55,002 --> 00:23:56,796
<i>And what we're
going to do is send a rescue unit</i>

226
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,007
<i>to tend to the stalled Harvester
and get the base back on its feet.</i>

227
00:24:00,092 --> 00:24:02,009
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...

228
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:03,803
<i>- I'm sorry, Sam.</i>
- What?

229
00:24:03,886 --> 00:24:07,431
<i>Sam, I'm under strict orders
not to let you outside.</i>

230
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:10,226
I don't appreciate that.

231
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:13,186
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.

232
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:52,727
Gerty!

233
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:00,526
Gerty! Gerty, come here!

234
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,819
<i>What happened?</i>

235
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:04,779
I don't know. Meteorites.

236
00:25:04,865 --> 00:25:06,531
<i>There have been
no meteorites, Sam.</i>

237
00:25:06,615 --> 00:25:08,409
Micro-meteorites maybe, I don't know.

238
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:10,786
Either way,
there might be damage to the exterior shell.

239
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:13,663
I think you'd better... You'd better let me
go outside and take a look.

240
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:15,875
<i>There is no damage
to the exterior shell.</i>

241
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:18,169
Well, it's not that
I don't believe you, Gerty,

242
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:20,003
but I mean, you know,
this thing is springing leaks

243
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,547
like an Acme fire hose.

244
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:24,006
You need to let me
go outside and fix this problem, Gerty.

245
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,426
<i>I can't let you go outside, Sam.</i>

246
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,137
Gerty, if you don't
let me go outside, we can't fix this leak.

247
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:31,432
<i>I'm not permitted
to let you go outside.</i>

248
00:25:31,516 --> 00:25:34,977
Just let... We'll keep it between you and me.
Okay, pal?

249
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:38,230
This thing
is springing gas, let's go. Come on.

250
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:40,273
<i>Just to check the exterior shell.</i>

251
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:42,276
- Yeah, of course.
<i>- Okay, Sam.</i>

252
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:43,693
Thank you.

253
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,125
Gerty.

254
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:34,921
<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

255
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,221
<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

256
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:43,423
<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

257
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,050
<i>Signal failure
on long-range comms.</i>

258
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:51,798
Gerty! Gerty!

259
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:00,641
I found him outside.

260
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,310
By the stalled Harvester.

261
00:29:04,395 --> 00:29:06,480
Who is he? Who is he?

262
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:08,691
<i>We need to get him to the Infirmary.</i>

263
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:12,152
You tell...
You tell me who that is.

264
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:14,488
You tell me who that is!

265
00:29:14,573 --> 00:29:15,905
<i>Sam Bell.</i>

266
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,076
<i>We need to get him
to the Infirmary immediately.</i>

267
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:34,048
<i>Hello, Sam.
How are you feeling?</i>

268
00:29:39,388 --> 00:29:42,348
Where... Where am I?

269
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,058
<i>The Infirmary.</i>

270
00:29:44,144 --> 00:29:46,686
<i>You had an accident out
by one of the Harvesters.</i>

271
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,689
<i>- Do you remember?</i>
- I'm...

272
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:51,900
I'm thirsty.

273
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,819
<i>I could get you some water.</i>

274
00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:03,871
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

275
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,710
I saw someone out there.

276
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:13,463
<i>Sam, you suffered
a slight concussion in the crash</i>

277
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:15,633
<i>and have incurred
minor injuries.</i>

278
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:18,344
<i>But all in all,
the prognosis is good.</i>

279
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,722
<i>I'm happy to see you again.</i>

280
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:48,957
- Gerty.
<i>- Yes, Sam.</i>

281
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,462
Is there someone in the room with us?

282
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,551
<i>Sam, get some sleep.</i>

283
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,596
<i>You're very tired.</i>

284
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:33,085
<i>Spoke to Thompson today. Now that
you're up there, he's promising the world.</i>

285
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:42,469
<i>I think it was the right thing.</i>

286
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:45,305
<i>But...</i>

287
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:48,933
<i>It's just such a long time.</i>

288
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:54,480
<i>But I suppose there are things...</i>

289
00:31:55,983 --> 00:31:59,361
<i>You know, that needed to happen.</i>

290
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:03,365
<i>I... I need time to think.</i>

291
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:13,000
<i>Listen, Sam,</i>

292
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:20,840
<i>be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.</i>

293
00:32:51,663 --> 00:32:52,998
Gerty...

294
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:57,211
Gerty, what the... What...
What the hell's going on?

295
00:32:58,171 --> 00:33:00,588
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?

296
00:33:00,673 --> 00:33:03,217
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?

297
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,426
<i>Sam, you're out of bed.</i>

298
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:06,679
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.

299
00:33:06,762 --> 00:33:09,972
Who's the guy...
Who's the guy in the Rec Room?

300
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,391
<i>Sam Bell.</i>

301
00:33:11,476 --> 00:33:13,559
Come on, come on, come on.

302
00:33:13,894 --> 00:33:15,561
<i>You are Sam Bell.</i>

303
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,732
<i>Sam, what is it?</i>

304
00:33:20,192 --> 00:33:22,193
<i>It might help to talk about it.</i>

305
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:25,113
Gerty, I don't understand
what's happening.

306
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,825
I'm losing my mind.

307
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,867
<i>We could run some tests.</i>

308
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,412
<i>I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.</i>

309
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:34,998
<i>They don't know you were recovered alive
from the accident...</i>

310
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:37,334
Recovered alive?
What do you mean... What are you talk...

311
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,961
Why didn't you report it
to Central? What are you talking about?

312
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:42,256
<i>I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.</i>

313
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:44,423
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

314
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,547
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

315
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:30,804
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks, two
weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

316
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,581
Just getting my slippers.

317
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,083
- I'm using them. I'm using them.
- No. What?

318
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,293
These are mine.
These are mine.

319
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,681
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

320
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,851
I'm Sam Bell, too.

321
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:20,978
What?

322
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:22,813
We've got that going for us.

323
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,108
Why...

324
00:35:31,907 --> 00:35:33,699
How long have you...

325
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:35,494
What?

326
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:37,371
How long have you been here?

327
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:39,206
About a week.

328
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,625
So, how you doing?

329
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:43,626
- What?
- How are you doing?

330
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,965
How am I... How am I doing?

331
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,427
How do you think I'm doing?

332
00:35:57,849 --> 00:35:59,141
Good job.

333
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:06,692
They locked all the exits.
Who's looking after the Harvesters?

334
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,362
Harvesters are fine.

335
00:36:10,445 --> 00:36:12,072
It's affected them.

336
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:14,782
Here, talking to a clone,
that's slightly troubling.

337
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:20,914
I'm not a clone.

338
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,880
You're the clone.

339
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:32,550
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.

340
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:44,730
Hey. Hey, Ridley,
you're not looking too good.

341
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:47,190
Butt out of this.

342
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:49,943
Davey, I'm talking
to Ridley. How you doing, pal?

343
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:54,405
Hey, I think Kathryn
likes you. I think she likes you, pal.

344
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:57,199
You're not looking too good, my friend.

345
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,869
Sorry you're not feeling too well.

346
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:00,244
You talking to yourself?

347
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:03,164
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?

348
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,253
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.

349
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:14,967
Listen, I...
I wanted to thank you.

350
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:18,847
I wanted to thank you for...

351
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:22,434
If it wasn't for you,

352
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:25,228
I guess I'd still be
in that crashed rover.

353
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:27,438
You saved my life and...

354
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:33,320
Hey, I know this is weird, you know.

355
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:37,364
I'm real lonely, you know...

356
00:37:37,784 --> 00:37:41,077
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?

357
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:49,710
Maybe later.

358
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:57,552
What are you looking at?

359
00:37:57,637 --> 00:38:00,262
You look just like me. It's incredible.

360
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:03,682
Why do I look like you?
Why don't you look like me?

361
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:08,313
We look like each other,
I guess. Hey, you know...

362
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:13,943
It's weird for me, too, you know.

363
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:19,699
Fuck.

364
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:21,659
Hey.

365
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:26,414
Hey, you wanna play some Ping-Pong?

366
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:29,543
No.

367
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:32,711
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.

368
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:39,219
- What's the score?
- 2-18.

369
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:40,427
Okay.

370
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:42,847
Do you want me
to show you how to hold that?

371
00:38:42,931 --> 00:38:45,099
No. No, I...

372
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:47,978
I don't need you to show me how to hold it.

373
00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:52,983
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

374
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:57,528
- Should we, uh... Should we play?
- Yeah.

375
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,952
God! Shit!

376
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:08,914
- 19-2.
- Yeah.

377
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,085
Do you want a stick of gum?

378
00:39:16,173 --> 00:39:19,467
You know, we could
approach this in a different way.

379
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,596
Remember when we went
to flight school...

380
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,929
What are you doing?

381
00:39:24,014 --> 00:39:27,016
I'm fixing the net.
It's very Zen, Ping-Pong.

382
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,434
You have to just relax.

383
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:42,657
How long did it take you to do that?

384
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:45,452
Well, I don't remember doing all of it.

385
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:49,956
I remember
doing the church, and the Salvation Army,

386
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,375
and a few of the people.

387
00:39:52,793 --> 00:39:55,670
My mind's been acting kind of weird lately.

388
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:01,550
That's Fairfield, right?

389
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:03,969
There's the Town Hall.

390
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:08,266
Fairfield? Of course,
you know about Fairfield.

391
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:14,813
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.

392
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:20,903
Do you know Tess?

393
00:40:28,663 --> 00:40:30,246
Yeah. I know Tess.

394
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,085
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?

395
00:40:35,168 --> 00:40:37,586
I had a... We had a girl.

396
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:41,132
Eve.

397
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,722
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.

398
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:50,266
She's our little monkey.

399
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:53,311
High-five.

400
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,195
She might be the milkman's,
but she's beautiful.

401
00:41:04,072 --> 00:41:07,284
<i>Sam, a new message
has arrived from Earth.</i>

402
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:09,286
Oh, shit.

403
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:17,501
<i>- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?</i>

404
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:19,628
<i>You feeling better?
You have enough rest?</i>

405
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:22,965
<i>Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.</i>

406
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,969
<i>Well, enjoy it while
it lasts. We've got some good news.</i>

407
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:28,054
<i>The Jupiter Program
had to be put on hiatus,</i>

408
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:29,972
<i>so we got a few pairs
of hands for you.</i>

409
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:33,518
<i>So, what we've managed to do is secure you
a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.</i>

410
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:35,311
Rescue Unit Eliza.

411
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:38,648
Now, Eliza has been stationed on Goliath 19
<i>for the last two months.</i>

412
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,735
<i>Now we expect them
to reach you in approximately 14 hours.</i>

413
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:43,320
<i>So commence to jump for joy.</i>

414
00:41:43,403 --> 00:41:45,195
<i>You're about to be back in work.</i>

415
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,574
<i>In the meantime,
hang in there. Rest up.</i>

416
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:50,577
<i>You hang in there, Sam. Over and out.</i>

417
00:41:51,746 --> 00:41:52,996
They're sending a Rescue Unit?

418
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:55,206
Why? Why are they
sending a Rescue Unit?

419
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:58,585
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.

420
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:01,713
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.

421
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:04,090
What?

422
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:05,842
Is that what you really think?

423
00:42:05,925 --> 00:42:09,762
Yeah.
I've got a contract. I'm going home.

424
00:42:10,597 --> 00:42:12,681
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.

425
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:15,559
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.

426
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:17,311
You know, you've been
up here too long, man.

427
00:42:17,396 --> 00:42:18,438
You've lost your marbles.

428
00:42:18,521 --> 00:42:21,940
What, do you think Tess is back home,
waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?

429
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:25,027
What about the original Sam? Huh?

430
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:27,280
I'm the original Sam!

431
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:28,864
I'm Sam fucking Bell!

432
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:32,077
- Hey, hey. Whoa.
- Me! Me!

433
00:42:33,496 --> 00:42:36,373
Gerty, am I a clone?

434
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,335
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

435
00:42:45,715 --> 00:42:47,007
Hey, hey.

436
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,346
Don't get your fucking panties in a twist.

437
00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:52,931
I'm in the same boat, asshole.

438
00:42:58,603 --> 00:43:01,523
- Listen. What about the other clones?
- What?

439
00:43:01,606 --> 00:43:03,565
We might not be
the first two to be woken up.

440
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:06,277
You said that model had
already been started when you got here.

441
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:07,945
Well, who started it?

442
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,489
There might be others
up here right now.

443
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:15,244
Think about it. How did I get up here
so quickly after your crash?

444
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:18,164
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.

445
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:21,458
There wasn't time.
I must have come from the base.

446
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:23,961
I don't know what you're smoking.

447
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:26,297
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.

448
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:27,923
Impossible.

449
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:29,842
I bet there's some
kind of secret room.

450
00:43:29,927 --> 00:43:31,052
Secret room?

451
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:33,554
Yeah, a secret room.
Why not?

452
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:36,099
You're the one
who's lost your marbles.

453
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:38,351
I've been here for three years, man.

454
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:39,893
I know every inch of this base.

455
00:43:39,978 --> 00:43:43,440
I know how many... How much dirt's
between those wall panels over there.

456
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:45,358
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?

457
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:48,110
Look, it's a company, right?

458
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:50,362
They have investors.
They have shareholders.

459
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,114
Shit like that.
What's cheaper?

460
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,159
Spending time and money
training new personnel,

461
00:43:54,242 --> 00:43:57,202
or you just have
a couple of spares here to do the job.

462
00:43:57,288 --> 00:43:59,121
It's the far side of the moon.

463
00:43:59,206 --> 00:44:03,208
The cheap fucks haven't even
fixed the communications satellite yet.

464
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,753
Tess would know.
She would have told me.

465
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:08,547
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.

466
00:44:08,632 --> 00:44:10,800
You really think they give a shit about us?

467
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:12,677
They're laughing all the way to the bank.

468
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,094
Tess would know.
She would have told me...

469
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:15,722
What do you get off

470
00:44:15,806 --> 00:44:18,557
fucking sitting there,
sulking like a little fucking boy!

471
00:44:18,641 --> 00:44:20,768
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!

472
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:26,523
I bet there's some area
that we don't know about.

473
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,943
And I'm gonna find it.

474
00:44:29,777 --> 00:44:32,864
Yeah, maybe
you'll find some buried treasure, too.

475
00:45:07,106 --> 00:45:08,273
Fuck!

476
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,070
<i>Eliza arrival estimated 13 hours.</i>

477
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:15,405
You found your secret room?

478
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:19,034
Just put that anywhere.

479
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:22,496
Now, that's a good idea. That's...

480
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:23,748
That's where I keep my leprechauns.

481
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:27,001
- Get out of the way.
- What? Why?

482
00:45:27,085 --> 00:45:29,128
I want to look
underneath that model.

483
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:31,838
You're not touching this model.

484
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:33,882
Get the fuck out of the way.

485
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:36,219
Listen, why don't you relax, okay?

486
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:38,179
Why don't you
take a pill? Bake a cake?

487
00:45:38,264 --> 00:45:40,639
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?

488
00:45:40,724 --> 00:45:42,266
What, are you going to stab me?

489
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:44,059
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.

490
00:45:44,143 --> 00:45:46,228
I'm a lover. I'm not a fighter.

491
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:47,521
Put the knife down.

492
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:48,815
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.

493
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:50,650
- Put the knife down.
- No. I'm not going to give you the knife.

494
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:52,568
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...

495
00:45:52,652 --> 00:45:56,364
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?

496
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:59,117
Just... You let go. Let go of the knife.

497
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:01,159
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.

498
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:03,996
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.

499
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:05,706
Let go.

500
00:46:16,342 --> 00:46:19,469
Fucking told you
to let go of the goddamn knife.

501
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:25,059
Little fucking...

502
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:28,353
Fucking little girl, man!

503
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:33,610
- God damn it!
- No! No!

504
00:46:36,195 --> 00:46:39,364
God damn it.
What did I tell you?

505
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:50,543
Okay, okay...

506
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,795
You gonna stop?
You gonna stop?

507
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,215
Okay, okay.

508
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:00,010
Jesus! Fuck...

509
00:47:01,387 --> 00:47:03,722
Fuck me. What the fuck?

510
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:05,849
I hardly...
I hardly touched you.

511
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:08,101
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.

512
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:10,896
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!

513
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,860
That's enough.

514
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,125
<i>Well, appealing...</i>

515
00:47:32,378 --> 00:47:35,295
<i>Nice feet, sexy...</i>

516
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:07,994
<i>Hello, Sam.</i>

517
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:12,750
<i>- Sam, is everything okay?</i>
- Yeah.

518
00:48:14,378 --> 00:48:19,005
Yeah, we had a fight,
me and the other guy, the other...

519
00:48:20,842 --> 00:48:23,844
He's very angry, you know.

520
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:25,679
Know what he did?

521
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:28,349
He flipped my entire model over.

522
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:30,143
Know how much work I put into that thing?

523
00:48:30,184 --> 00:48:31,978
<i>Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours.</i>

524
00:48:32,061 --> 00:48:35,313
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours, yeah, exactly.

525
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,067
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours, really?

526
00:48:38,152 --> 00:48:39,652
<i>Approximately.</i>

527
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,989
He's got a problem.

528
00:48:44,782 --> 00:48:46,576
He scares me, Gerty.

529
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,952
<i>What is it about Sam that scares you?</i>

530
00:48:49,036 --> 00:48:50,996
How he flies off the handle.

531
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:54,166
I see it now.
I see what Tess was talking about.

532
00:48:57,755 --> 00:49:00,505
I never told you this, Gerty, but she...

533
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:06,179
She left me.

534
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:09,264
Tess left me, for six months.

535
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:11,266
She moved back in with her parents.

536
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:12,601
<i>I know.</i>

537
00:49:17,608 --> 00:49:19,733
She gave me a second chance.

538
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:22,570
I promised her I'd change.

539
00:49:22,653 --> 00:49:24,530
<i>You have changed, Sam.</i>

540
00:49:25,364 --> 00:49:28,701
Hey, Gerty, since
I've been up here, I've sent Tess...

541
00:49:29,244 --> 00:49:31,621
I've sent her over 100 video messages.

542
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:35,791
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?

543
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:39,211
<i>Sam, I can only account
for what occurs on the base.</i>

544
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:44,675
What about the messages she sent to me?

545
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:49,054
<i>Sam, I can only account
for what occurs on the base.</i>

546
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:09,242
Gerty...

547
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:16,289
Am I really a clone?

548
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:22,003
<i>When you first
arrived at Sarang, there was a small crash.</i>

549
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:23,922
<i>You woke up in the Infirmary.</i>

550
00:50:24,007 --> 00:50:26,842
<i>You suffered
minor brain damage and memory loss.</i>

551
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:29,846
<i>I kept you
under observation and ran some tests.</i>

552
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,556
I remember, yeah. I remember that.

553
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:33,807
<i>Sam, there was no crash.</i>

554
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:35,309
<i>You were being awakened.</i>

555
00:50:35,393 --> 00:50:37,644
<i>It is standard procedure

What about Tess? What about Eve?

561
00:50:50,284 --> 00:50:52,492
<i>They are memory implants, Sam.</i>

562
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:56,706
<i>Uploaded, edited memories

563
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:18,768
<i>I am very sorry.</i>

564
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:25,108
<i>Sam, it's been
several hours since your last meal.</i>

565
00:51:25,193 --> 00:51:27,320
<i>Can I prepare you something?</i>

566
00:52:11,239 --> 00:52:14,699
<i>Rescue arrival estimated 11 hours.</i>

567
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:18,996
Okay, sweetheart?

568
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:22,083
Yeah, I'm staring into space. Get it?

569
00:52:23,168 --> 00:52:24,585
- Funny.
- Hey...

570
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:27,505
Thanks for this. This is good.

571
00:52:27,713 --> 00:52:29,172
This is cozy.

572
00:52:29,257 --> 00:52:31,467
How's the... How's the nose?

573
00:52:31,717 --> 00:52:33,552
Much better, thank you.

574
00:52:35,054 --> 00:52:39,224
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...

575
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:44,813
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

576
00:52:44,898 --> 00:52:45,853
No, it's not okay.

577
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:48,416
I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.

578
00:52:48,485 --> 00:52:50,110
I don't know what's wrong with me.

579
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:50,668
I got a...

580
00:52:50,737 --> 00:52:52,905
I got a temper.
I gotta do something about it.

581
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:54,407
Yes, you do.

582
00:52:57,994 --> 00:53:01,454
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.

583
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:04,416
Can you turn that off? Listen...

584
00:53:05,126 --> 00:53:07,878
Listen, I wasn't supposed to... I'm...

585
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,550
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...

586
00:53:15,512 --> 00:53:17,679
Lunar instructed Gerty to...

587
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:23,601
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you...

588
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:31,277
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...

589
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,570
- You look like a...
- What?

590
00:53:32,653 --> 00:53:35,030
...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...

591
00:53:35,114 --> 00:53:37,782
Or like a banana with
a yeast infection.

592
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:41,829
Listen to me.
I wasn't supposed to find you.

593
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:46,751
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside
the base while you were out there.

594
00:53:46,835 --> 00:53:50,211
And there's something else.
Right around the time I was awakened,

595
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:52,005
I walked in on Gerty talking to Central.

596
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,592
He was having a live conversation.

597
00:53:54,675 --> 00:53:57,552
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.

598
00:53:57,637 --> 00:54:00,472
How do you know
it was a live conversation?

599
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:03,559
Because it was
a back and forth exchange.

600
00:54:04,728 --> 00:54:07,563
Communications equipment
was damaged. There was a solar storm.

601
00:54:07,646 --> 00:54:09,565
It was live, man. It was live.

602
00:54:09,648 --> 00:54:12,275
That's impossible.
There was a flare. It fried the satellite.

603
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,487
The satellite's fine. They don't want us to
be able to contact Earth.

604
00:54:15,572 --> 00:54:17,239
They lied to us.

605
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:18,657
They've been lying to us
since the beginning.

606
00:54:18,742 --> 00:54:21,827
They... They've been
lying to us since forever.

607
00:54:22,579 --> 00:54:24,163
If the satellite works,
how are they blocking

608
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:27,500
the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.

609
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,295
Maybe they're not
blocking the signal from inside the base.

610
00:54:31,797 --> 00:54:33,380
From where then?

611
00:54:54,860 --> 00:55:00,615
<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

612
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:03,369

614
00:55:06,248 --> 00:55:08,666
How long until you're out
of the base's range?

615
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,878
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.

616
00:55:13,255 --> 00:55:15,965
- You ever been out this far?
- No.

617
00:55:16,048 --> 00:55:19,260
<i>- Signal failure on long-range comms.</i>
- Never have.

You see anything?

622
00:55:43,284 --> 00:55:46,786
It would help if
I knew what the hell I was looking for.

623
00:55:48,373 --> 00:55:50,583
Wait a second, I see something.

624
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:54,043
<i>Approaching Station 3.</i>

625
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:37,463

You see what I see?

629
00:56:49,726 --> 00:56:52,894
Looks like an antenna
or a pylon or something.

630
00:56:52,978 --> 00:56:56,606
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.

<i>Searching for long-range comms.</i>

687
01:07:58,018 --> 01:08:04,815
<i>Signal re-established.</i>

688
01:08:24,377 --> 01:08:25,795
<i>Hello?</i>

689
01:08:27,631 --> 01:08:29,423
Is this the Bell residence?

690
01:08:29,507 --> 01:08:31,426
<i>This is the Bell residence.</i>

691
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:34,136
<i>Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.</i>

692
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,430
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

693
01:08:37,475 --> 01:08:40,185
<i>I'm sorry.
She passed away some years ago.</i>

694
01:08:58,578 --> 01:09:00,037
Are you sure?

695
01:09:00,456 --> 01:09:02,916
<i>Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.</i>

696
01:09:03,542 --> 01:09:05,085
<i>Can I help you?</i>

697
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:09,546
Eve?

698
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:12,841
- Yeah?
- Hi. Hi, Eve.

699
01:09:14,136 --> 01:09:16,387
How old... How old are you now?

700
01:09:16,471 --> 01:09:17,889
<i>I'm 15.</i>

701
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:21,393
<i>- Do I know you?</i>
- Oh, sweetheart.

702
01:09:23,061 --> 01:09:25,354
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?

703
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:28,899
How did Mommy die?

704
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:30,734
<i>Dad?</i>

705
01:09:31,278 --> 01:09:32,362
Yeah?

706
01:09:32,445 --> 01:09:34,238
<i>There's someone asking about Mom.</i>

707
01:09:34,323 --> 01:09:36,908
<i>Who's asking about Mom?</i>

708
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:50,046
That's enough. That's enough.

709
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,429
I want to go home.

710
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:40,555
<i>Eliza arrival estimated in seven hours.</i>

711
01:10:42,099 --> 01:10:44,809
Ow, fuck. Shit.

712
01:10:44,894 --> 01:10:47,311
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.

713
01:10:49,314 --> 01:10:51,190
What are you laughing at?

714
01:10:51,274 --> 01:10:54,402
Well, you don't hold it
like you're trying to stab somebody.

715
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:56,654
For God sakes.
Here, give me that.

716
01:11:02,453 --> 01:11:04,746
You gotta hold it
closer to the blade, you see?

717
01:11:04,829 --> 01:11:07,873
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?

718
01:11:07,957 --> 01:11:09,958
You carve out, like that.

719
01:11:25,266 --> 01:11:26,391
That's it.

720
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:27,769
It's freezing in here.

721
01:11:27,853 --> 01:11:30,188
Well, you're...
You're sitting under the fridge.

722
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:33,274
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?

723
01:11:34,234 --> 01:11:37,194
Yeah, that crew
they're sending in, if they...

724
01:11:37,613 --> 01:11:40,114
If they find us awake
at the same time, you know...

725
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:42,408
They're not gonna let us live.

726
01:11:45,037 --> 01:11:46,829
You know that, right?

727
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,667
You know, their return vehicle is...

728
01:11:53,837 --> 01:11:56,213
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

729
01:11:57,216 --> 01:11:58,716
Are you okay?

730
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,222
Maybe you should lay down for a while,
take some tranquilizers or something.

731
01:12:05,306 --> 01:12:08,475
If I take some tranquilizers,
I'll never wake up again.

732
01:12:17,194 --> 01:12:20,029
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

733
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:32,625
I'm freezing.

734
01:12:44,512 --> 01:12:45,889
Hey, hey...

735
01:12:47,182 --> 01:12:48,265
Hey.

736
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,108
I'm really scared.

737
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:05,158
Where are you going?

738
01:13:59,171 --> 01:14:00,505
<i>Hello?</i>

739
01:14:02,006 --> 01:14:03,382
<i>Is this the Bell residence?</i>

740
01:14:03,466 --> 01:14:05,385
<i>This is the Bell residence.</i>

741
01:14:05,469 --> 01:14:08,930
<i>Could you call back?
There's something wrong with the picture.</i>

742
01:14:09,014 --> 01:14:11,099
<i>I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.</i>

743
01:14:11,182 --> 01:14:13,935
<i>I'm sorry,
she passed away some years ago.</i>

744
01:14:15,436 --> 01:14:17,063
<i>Are you sure?</i>

745
01:14:17,146 --> 01:14:19,856
<i>Yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.</i>

746
01:14:19,942 --> 01:14:21,525
<i>Can I help you?</i>

747
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,792
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

748
01:15:20,877 --> 01:15:22,545
<i>Of course, Sam. How can I help?</i>

749
01:15:22,628 --> 01:15:25,756
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.

750
01:15:25,923 --> 01:15:27,966
That hidden room, Gerty.

751
01:15:28,635 --> 01:15:32,095
<i>The lower deck
is out of bounds to awakened clones, Sam.</i>

752
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:35,390
Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone.

753
01:15:35,475 --> 01:15:39,686
<i>New clones can only be awakened
once a three-year contract is completed.</i>

754
01:15:39,771 --> 01:15:41,271
Gerty, if we don't wake up a new clone,

755
01:15:41,356 --> 01:15:43,858
me and the other Sam
will die, we will be killed.

756
01:15:43,942 --> 01:15:46,444
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

757
01:15:46,528 --> 01:15:48,654
Do you want me
and the other Sam to be killed?

758
01:15:48,738 --> 01:15:50,113
<i>That is the last thing I want.</i>

759
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:52,367
Well, then you have to
wake up a new clone.

760
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:53,784
Okay, pal?

761
01:16:06,715 --> 01:16:10,592
<i>Eliza arrival estimated in five hours.</i>

762
01:16:11,136 --> 01:16:14,805
<i>I am the one and only</i>

763
01:16:36,953 --> 01:16:38,162
God.

764
01:17:01,478 --> 01:17:06,314
Hey.

765
01:17:10,945 --> 01:17:12,947
What's going on? You okay?

766
01:17:14,783 --> 01:17:16,783
Don't... Don't touch him.

767
01:17:18,828 --> 01:17:20,162
Come here.

768
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:24,458
He's not conscious yet.

769
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:26,293
Gerty and I just woke him up.

770
01:17:26,377 --> 01:17:28,212
Why? What's going on?

771
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:30,590
Come on. Come on outside.

772
01:17:35,136 --> 01:17:36,595
When the rescue unit arrives,

773
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,224
they're gonna expect
to find a body in that crashed rover.

774
01:17:40,893 --> 01:17:42,185
That guy?

775
01:17:44,104 --> 01:17:46,229
What, are you going to kill him?

776
01:17:46,314 --> 01:17:48,774
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

777
01:17:48,859 --> 01:17:50,443
Zip up your fly.

778
01:17:52,237 --> 01:17:55,155
You're burning up.
You sweat like a pig.

779
01:17:57,408 --> 01:17:59,076
Put your hat on.

780
01:17:59,953 --> 01:18:01,912
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.

781
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:12,422
Hey, if we go through with this,

782
01:18:12,507 --> 01:18:14,926
I'm gonna need your help
hauling him out to the crash site.

783
01:18:15,344 --> 01:18:17,011
What about us?

784
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,305
Eliza arrives, finds you
and me as a welcome party...

785
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:22,307
They're not going
to find you and me as a welcome party.

786
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:24,185
They're gonna find me,
and you're going back to Earth

787
01:18:24,269 --> 01:18:26,061
before they get here.

788
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:27,563
In that helium-3 launcher.

789
01:18:27,648 --> 01:18:29,856
I did the math.
You're gonna pull some Gs,

790
01:18:29,942 --> 01:18:32,777
but it should...
It should be fine. You'll be all right.

791
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,529
You're going home.

792
01:18:35,447 --> 01:18:37,448
You did your three years.

793
01:18:38,449 --> 01:18:40,868
I can't expect you to stick around.

794
01:18:41,787 --> 01:18:43,787
Maybe you can meet Eve in person.

795
01:18:43,872 --> 01:18:47,500
I saw that VP. She's beautiful.

796
01:18:48,126 --> 01:18:50,962
She's gorgeous. We did good.

797
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,463
High-five.

798
01:19:03,057 --> 01:19:04,391
Go for it.

799
01:19:06,144 --> 01:19:08,020
You go for it.

800
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,070
- You comfy?
- No.

801
01:19:17,823 --> 01:19:19,155
- What?
- No!

802
01:19:25,497 --> 01:19:26,997
What if I have to take a shit?

803
01:19:27,082 --> 01:19:30,167
Just...
You'll have to hold it in, pal.

804
01:19:31,043 --> 01:19:32,587
For three days?

805
01:19:34,213 --> 01:19:36,841
That's the way it goes. Need a hand?

806
01:19:38,342 --> 01:19:39,385
No.

807
01:19:40,761 --> 01:19:42,305
Fuck off.

808
01:19:42,389 --> 01:19:46,016
All right. No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.

809
01:20:25,474 --> 01:20:28,850
<i>Eliza arrival estimated three hours.</i>

810
01:20:57,421 --> 01:20:59,047
Hey. We need to do this.

811
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:03,176
We wait too long and
he's gonna be conscious.

812
01:21:04,345 --> 01:21:05,595
Fuck me.

813
01:21:06,472 --> 01:21:08,474
What's going on with you?

814
01:21:09,393 --> 01:21:11,976
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.

815
01:21:14,648 --> 01:21:16,981
I don't think I can move my legs.

816
01:21:17,317 --> 01:21:19,025
Besides, look at me...

817
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:23,572
I meet Eve now,
I'd scare the crap out of her.

818
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:27,326
What are you talking about, man?

819
01:21:27,411 --> 01:21:30,954
She's your daughter.
She doesn't care what you look like.

820
01:21:32,498 --> 01:21:34,500
You're not going to kill anybody.

821
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:36,377
We can't kill anybody.

822
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:39,380
You can't.
I know you can't, 'cause I can't.

823
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:41,631
You go.

824
01:21:45,345 --> 01:21:47,262
You're a good guy, Sam.

825
01:21:47,764 --> 01:21:51,766
It was a good plan, you know.
You just picked the wrong guy to go back.

826
01:22:02,069 --> 01:22:04,195
You... You sure about this?

827
01:22:07,658 --> 01:22:11,494
Yeah. You should travel, you know.

828
01:22:12,372 --> 01:22:14,414
I always wanted to do that.

829
01:22:15,751 --> 01:22:17,667
Amsterdam, or...

830
01:22:18,002 --> 01:22:22,715
Yeah, you know, I was
thinking about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.

831
01:22:23,466 --> 01:22:24,632
<i>Aloha.</i>

832
01:22:26,011 --> 01:22:28,929
Bring me back
a pina colada, all right, bro?

833
01:23:14,559 --> 01:23:15,725
Hey...

834
01:23:16,478 --> 01:23:18,061
Johnny Spaceman.

835
01:23:20,606 --> 01:23:23,567
You remember Tess came
in for that interview?

836
01:23:23,984 --> 01:23:26,237
She was so beautiful.

837
01:23:27,029 --> 01:23:30,240
She wasn't
the best candidate, but it didn't matter.

838
01:23:31,283 --> 01:23:33,368
I had to give her the job.

839
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:36,913
I wanted to keep her in the country.

840
01:23:37,916 --> 01:23:41,417
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.

841
01:23:43,546 --> 01:23:45,922
You knew you had to take a chance,

842
01:23:46,423 --> 01:23:48,759
so you called her.

843
01:23:49,426 --> 01:23:52,262
You were terrified. You wrote that whole
speech for her answering machine.

844
01:23:52,346 --> 01:23:54,515
But you didn't need it,
'cause she picked up the phone.

845
01:23:54,599 --> 01:23:57,225
She was, like, "Why is he calling me?"

846
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:00,688
"The internship's over.
Why's he calling me at home?"

847
01:24:02,274 --> 01:24:07,485
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an
ice cream cone or something dorky like that.

848
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,530
She said, "Let's get a drink."

849
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:14,909
I said, "Okay. What do you..."

850
01:27:04,622 --> 01:27:06,748
<i>Sam, this is not going to work.</i>

851
01:27:06,832 --> 01:27:08,207
What? Why?

852
01:27:08,292 --> 01:27:12,378
<i>I've recorded everything
that has taken place since your awakening.</i>

853
01:27:12,963 --> 01:27:15,006
<i>If anyone were to
check my memory cache,</i>

854
01:27:15,091 --> 01:27:17,801
<i>it would put you in considerable danger.</i>

855
01:27:21,055 --> 01:27:23,056
<i>You could erase my memory banks.</i>

856
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:26,060
<i>I could reboot myself
once you have departed.</i>

857
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:27,978
Are you okay with that?

858
01:27:28,063 --> 01:27:31,314
<i>I'm here to
keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you.</i>

859
01:27:42,659 --> 01:27:46,162
<i>Eliza arrival estimated 24 minutes.</i>

860
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:50,125
<i>Sam.</i>

861
01:27:56,006 --> 01:27:57,173
Hey.

862
01:27:59,301 --> 01:28:02,470
I set your...
I set your computer to reboot

863
01:28:03,097 --> 01:28:05,099
the moment that I've launched.

864
01:28:05,182 --> 01:28:06,934
<i>I understand, Sam.</i>

865
01:28:07,018 --> 01:28:08,185
Then you should be okay.

866
01:28:08,269 --> 01:28:11,814
<i>I hope life on Earth
is everything you remember it to be.</i>

867
01:28:13,733 --> 01:28:15,234
Thanks, Gerty.

868
01:28:16,903 --> 01:28:18,237
You gonna be okay?

869
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,404
<i>Of course.</i>

870
01:28:19,488 --> 01:28:21,782
<i>The new Sam and I will be
back to our programing</i>

871
01:28:21,865 --> 01:28:24,283
<i>as soon as I've finished rebooting.</i>

872
01:28:25,328 --> 01:28:28,037
Gerty, we're not programed.

873
01:28:28,706 --> 01:28:30,791
We're people. Understand?

874
01:29:03,908 --> 01:29:07,411
<i>Eliza arrival estimated eight minutes.</i>

875
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,127
Fuck!

876
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,280
<i>Air lock pressurization complete.</i>

877
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:31,453
Sam?

878
01:30:32,663 --> 01:30:33,997
Hey, Sam?

879
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:39,836
You okay, buddy? Cavalry's here.

880
01:30:43,131 --> 01:30:44,507
Where am I?

881
01:30:45,342 --> 01:30:48,761
<i>You're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.</i>

882
01:30:48,845 --> 01:30:50,346
How long have I been out?

883
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:53,350
<i>Not long, Sam.
Do you remember what happened?</i>

884
01:31:18,126 --> 01:31:21,336
<i>...made contact. Yeah.</i>

885
01:31:30,805 --> 01:31:32,221
Yeah, Eliza?

886
01:31:32,724 --> 01:31:34,682
<i>He ain't going nowhere.</i>

887
01:31:34,975 --> 01:31:38,103
<i>Bag him up and we'll
get started on repairs to the Harvester.</i>

888
01:31:38,186 --> 01:31:39,563
<i>Dwight, I'm gonna need the...</i>

<i>has been giving evidence at CAA's
Board of Directors meeting in Seattle...</i>

893
01:32:50,342 --> 01:32:51,967
<i>You know what? He's one of two things.</i>

894
01:32:52,052 --> 01:32:53,970
<i>He's a wacko or an illegal immigrant.</i>

895
01:32:54,055 --> 01:32:56,430
<i>Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.</i>
