1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,123
Okay, that's good.

2
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,744
<i>- So do you like Dysfunction?
- What?</i>

3
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,204
- The show? Do you watch the show?
- Yeah, of course.

4
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:11,181
So, here's the deal. You're Marie-France...

5
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,288
a French foreign-exchange student
from France.

6
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:16,654
You're staying with the Parkers,
and you're a little Gallic hottie, all right?

7
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:18,989
- Buttery little croissant.
- A toasty little bagel.

8
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:22,666
Okay, and Cody, naturally,
wants to get all up in that ass soup.

9
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:25,357
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

10
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:29,711
Do I have to wear these shoes?
My feet are killing me.

11
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,772
- They're French.
- Okay, so look, we know that you can dance.

12
00:01:33,873 --> 00:01:36,590
So I want you to go ahead
and grab that over there.

13
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:39,241
You'll drop the French bread,
and you'll say the line:

14
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:41,067
"Oh-la-la, I've dropped my baguette!"

15
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,241
You wiggle your little tushy
in front of the audience...

16
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:45,799
as you bend over to pick it up, and presto!
A star is born.

17
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,043
You think you can handle that?

18
00:01:49,233 --> 00:01:51,950
- Do you want me to do it now?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,839
Oh-la-la. I've dropped my baguette!

20
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:00,903
All right, that was excellent.
That was beautiful. That was very nice.

21
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,503
I liked the accent, very authentic.

22
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:06,253
Thank you. We're done here. We'll call you.
You can leave now.

23
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,958
Don't try to walk off with those shoes, now.
They belong to the show.

24
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,697
I'll be interviewing some students...

25
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:01,102
sitting in on some classes,
gathering footage.

26
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:04,235
We'll make sure to be as unobtrusive
as possible.

27
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:08,909
Miss Klein, let me be frank.
The school board approved this, not me.

28
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:12,744
I'm uncomfortable
with the idea of cameras at Roxbury.

29
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:16,264
A lot of very important people
send their very important kids here.

30
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,599
- Believe me, Mr. Mayer...
- Meyer. Think of the wiener.

31
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:24,396
Okay. Mr. Meyer,
you have nothing to worry about.

32
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,544
We're talking about a harmless little
human interest piece on the local news.

33
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,170
Believe me, they're not looking
for anything remotely controversial.

34
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,957
Otherwise, why would they assign it to me?

35
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:41,416
Okay, we're done now.
Guess I'll see you in two weeks.

36
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:43,016
- Excellent.
- Come in.

37
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,991
God damn it, Meyer,
the kids keyed my car again!

38
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:48,462
- Sorry to interrupt.
- That's all right, we're done.

39
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:52,588
Miss Klein, this is Roger Nicholl,
a Law and Civics teacher here at Roxbury.

40
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,802
- Hello.
- Hi, there.

41
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,755
Okay.

42
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:59,403
She's a dyke.

43
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:03,761
Symbiotic, that's what our relationship
is going to be like, Randa.

44
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,930
Just like we learned in biology:

45
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:08,685
The whale,
and the little fish that sticks on it.

46
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:11,087
If you hang with me,
you'll get a lot of attention from boys...

47
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:12,679
that you otherwise wouldn't.

48
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:15,949
Meanwhile, when I'm standing next to you,
I look more attractive by comparison.

49
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,056
- Isn't that great?
- Very nice.

50
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:22,057
It's a constant struggle for us girls
who don't conform to the Western ideal...

51
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:25,457
of blonde hair, and blue eyes,
and an hourglass figure.

52
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:29,840
You know, my best friend Brittany,
whom you'll meet soon, is so lucky.

53
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,592
She's three for three.

54
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,342
Me, I could dye my hair,
but nobody respects a bottle blonde.

55
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:39,277
I am slim, however,
and my breasts are coming along nicely...

56
00:05:39,474 --> 00:05:43,435
though not as nicely as my friend Brittany's,
whom you'll meet soon.

57
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:48,042
You're very lucky that I'm doing this for you.

58
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,993
I know you probably have an impression
of American high school girls...

59
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,195
being mean and spiteful...

60
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,141
and it's a reputation that's largely deserved,
believe me.

61
00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:01,008
But I'm not like that at all.
I really try to be a good person.

62
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:04,839
The same as my best friend Brittany,
whom you'll meet soon.

63
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:08,560
So here's your first survival tip:

64
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,861
This is Beverly Hills,
so a lot of the kids that go here...

65
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:14,475
have rich and famous parents,
and it's good to know who's who.

66
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:16,585
Like, that's Josh Horowitz.

67
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:19,303
His dad is the famous lawyer Larry Horowitz.

68
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:22,758
He defended that baseball player
who killed his wife. He got him off, too...

69
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,459
even though they found him
running around...

70
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:28,207
covered in blood with a baseball bat,
screaming, "I killed the bitch!"

71
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,895
And that's Lenora Fincher.

72
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:33,230
Her mom was the spokesmodel
for this perfume company...

73
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,981
but then she got old and they fired her.

74
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:38,352
And that's Terry something.

75
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,719
His parents aren't famous,
so nobody talks to him.

76
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,273
I do, though, 'cause I'm a good person.

77
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:46,441
- Hi, Terry.
- It's Dave.

78
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,054
- That smells good, what is that?
- Sfeha. Would you like some?

79
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:57,640
- Is it fattening?
- I don't know.

80
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,525
I'm on a diet. I better play it safe.

81
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:02,350
I'm organizing this International Food Fair...

82
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,011
to raise money
for the Drama Club next week.

83
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:06,635
- You must participate. Will you?
- Okay.

84
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,203
Bonus.

85
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:11,889
My hope is that the Fair will not only
raise money for the Drama Club...

86
00:07:11,986 --> 00:07:14,375
but also, kind of,
foster a spirit of togetherness...

87
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:17,614
among the multicultural community
here at Roxbury.

88
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,534
I have respect for all races...

89
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:26,510
but I'm very glad that I was born white.

90
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:29,873
As a woman, it's the best race to be...

91
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,232
especially if you want to become an actress,
like I do.

92
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:36,270
If I wasn't white...

93
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:40,366
then the next thing I'd want to be is Asian,
because a lot of men like Asian girls...

94
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:43,433
because they think they're docile,
and sweet, and subservient...

95
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,098
which I don't really think is true...

96
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:47,090
because I once met this Asian girl
at summer camp...

97
00:07:47,186 --> 00:07:49,096
and she was a real bitch.

98
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:55,409
If I couldn't be white,
and I also couldn't be Asian...

99
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:58,224
then my third choice
would be African-American...

100
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,046
'cause I've always wanted
to be a gospel singer...

101
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,562
and also black men are more forgiving
if your butt gets big.

102
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,343
Except I definitely want light skin
and Caucasian features...

103
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,679
like Vanessa Williams or Halle Berry.

104
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,229
So, rule of thumb:

105
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:16,014
Any time you have a sentence
consisting of two clauses...

106
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,890
the second being introduced
by a conjunction or by a relative...

107
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:24,079
And finally, you know, Randa,
no offense or anything...

108
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,950
but my very last choice would be an Arab.

109
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:31,760
Truth be told,
you're not in a very enviable position.

110
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:34,575
There's a lot of resentment in this country
towards the Middle East...

111
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:37,641
a lot of stereotypes floating around,
which I don't really think are true...

112
00:08:37,747 --> 00:08:40,846
because in the short time I've known you,
you haven't tried to bomb anybody...

113
00:08:40,946 --> 00:08:43,313
and you currently smell okay to me.

114
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,411
But people will laugh at you...

115
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:49,646
and probably make fun of that thing
you wear on your head.

116
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:53,227
- This is my hijab. I must not remove it.
- I know that.

117
00:08:54,963 --> 00:08:56,818
But people are ignorant.

118
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:01,833
To give you an example,
there's this joke going around.

119
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:06,770
- How does an Arab get his wife pregnant?
- I do not know.

120
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:11,210
She gets naked and lies down on the bed.

121
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:15,183
He jerks off on the wall,
and they let the flies do the rest.

122
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,105
Don't laugh. It's insulting to your people.

123
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,712
Miss Joyce?

124
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:25,743
Thank you.

125
00:09:25,843 --> 00:09:29,771
Article or a preposition which pertains
to every member of a series...

126
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,592
must either be used
only before the first term of the series...

127
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:34,316
or before each and every term.

128
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:40,875
I had a half-brother named Sean,
who died in "Operation Iraqi Freedom. "

129
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,856
He was from my dad's first marriage...

130
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:46,027
and I'm a product of his second.
He's now in his third.

131
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:49,644
Anyway, they told my dad
that Sean died from friendly fire...

132
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,406
and he refused to believe them.

133
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,329
He said that Iraqis are the ones
who killed him.

134
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,762
I made the point of saying,
"Why would our own government lie...

135
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,354
"and say he was killed by friendly fire...

136
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,833
"if Iraqis were the ones who killed him?"

137
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,582
- He said I was too young to understand...
- Miss Joyce.

138
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:05,425
There should be exactly one conversation
going on in this classroom, and that's me...

139
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,668
talking.

140
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:10,382
Technically, Mr. Anderson,
that's not a conversation.

141
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:13,682
All right, here's one for you,
I'll see you in detention.

142
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,405
- But I...
- And you, too.

143
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,842
- Me?
- Yes, you.

144
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,558
- Her name's Randa.
- Yes, of course it is.

145
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,255
All right.

146
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:26,056
Which brings us
to the principal of parallel construction.

147
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:28,880
Namely, that expressions
that are similar in content and function...

148
00:10:28,979 --> 00:10:30,353
Sorry, Randa.

149
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:37,419
It's unfortunate that we both have detention
with Mr. Anderson...

150
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:40,840
but on the other hand,
it's only going to prolong our day together.

151
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:46,063
- Hey, Arab chick, you wanna buy a gun?
- Get lost you unkempt miscreant!

152
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:52,876
Stay away from Kenny, the arms dealer.

153
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,812
It's kids like him that give
this great nation of ours a bad name.

154
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:00,810
You are very wise, Kimberly.
I am most fortunate to have met you.

155
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:04,778
Randa, that's so sweet. Come on.

156
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,635
You know, Brit, I was watching girls go by
in their convertibles...

157
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:15,597
I'd say about 75% to 85% of them
were what we call beautiful.

158
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:20,719
- But you want to know a secret?
- What?

159
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,963
They're ugly on the inside, not like you.

160
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,362
You're special.
Your kind of beauty lasts forever.

161
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,561
- Hi!
- Barry, get off me!

162
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:48,883
Randa, this is Barry.

163
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,176
Barry's technically my boyfriend,
except I don't like him.

164
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,751
So, Kimberly, Trevor McNeill
has the funniest shit on his locker.

165
00:11:56,852 --> 00:12:00,081
It's this poster with all these reasons
why beer is better than a woman.

166
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,002
One of the reasons was:

167
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,682
Beer doesn't talk.

168
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,738
- No, that wasn't it.
- It's okay, Barry.

169
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:13,585
- Trev, yo, what's up, man?
- Barry plays football.

170
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,623
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.

171
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:20,336
<i>- How was the Dysfunction audition?
- I'm not holding my breath.</i>

172
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:23,469
It's so hard to stand out
from all the other aspirants, you know?

173
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:24,586
Yeah.

174
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:26,382
So, Brittany, this is Randa.

175
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,557
Randa's from the Middle East.
She's really sweet.

176
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,994
- She doesn't say much, though.
- Hi.

177
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:34,764
I know all about the immigrant experience,
how hard it can be.

178
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,243
I'm Canadian.

179
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,955
So where were you all day?

180
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,875
Truant with Troy.

181
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:45,517
- You look high on happy pills.
- God, Kimberly, he's a poet.

182
00:12:45,652 --> 00:12:49,580
Everything that comes out of his mouth
is like an iambic pentagram.

183
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:53,135
- Who is Troy?
- Who's Troy?

184
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,395
He's only the hottest hottie
of all the hotties at Roxbury.

185
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,834
That's what my mother called
"damning with faint praise. "

186
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:01,517
Kimberly and Troy used to go out.
Now that Troy and I are together...

187
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,147
she could have been a green-eyed monster...

188
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:05,041
but instead she's been really sweet about it.

189
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,889
Brittany, I wouldn't ruin our friendship
over a boy.

190
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,028
- Wonder Twins.
- Wonder Twins.

191
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,482
Brittany and I are the best of friends.
We confide in each other.

192
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:14,635
Like the other day...

193
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,944
Brittany confided that she feels dirty
when she masturbates...

194
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:21,070
but I told her it was normal and healthy,
even when you do it as much as she does.

195
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,147
<i>I forgot to tell you,
they've posted the cast for Anne Frank.</i>

196
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:26,099
Really? Well, who's Anne?

197
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:29,098
I don't know, silly. I waited for you.
Come on.

198
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:32,777
Come on, Randa.

199
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:46,065
- I'm sorry, Brittany.
- Don't be.

200
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,411
Personally,
I think you deserved it way more.

201
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,169
Kimberly, you're a way better actress.
You always have been.

202
00:13:56,788 --> 00:14:00,137
- You know, Margot is a really good role.
- Yeah.

203
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:04,271
And everybody knows
that Anne Frank was a brunette.

204
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:07,315
So if you played her
you'd have to dye your hair.

205
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:11,438
You wouldn't want to do that, would you,
Brittany? You're so cute as a blonde.

206
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,201
That's true.

207
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,646
Oh, look! Troy is playing Peter Van Daan.

208
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:22,450
That means I'll have to kiss him.

209
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,445
I hope you won't be jealous.

210
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,702
- Well, it's just acting, right?
- Yeah, of course.

211
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,826
I still feel bad, though.

212
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:37,802
Well, don't, Kimberly.
I'm really happy for you.

213
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:40,942
I mean, if it couldn't be me, I'm glad it's you.

214
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:44,849
You're my best friend, Brittany.

215
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,988
I say we go to Fred Segal
and do some damage.

216
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:52,009
It sounds keen, but I gotta pass.
Randa and I have DT with Mr. A.

217
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,967
- Be careful.
- Careful? Why?

218
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,036
Mr. Anderson's kind of weird,
especially around girls.

219
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,105
We think he's a podiatrist.

220
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:09,902
Ignore her, she thinks everybody's hot
for her nubile bod.

221
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:15,820
- So anyway, Margot, we'll catch you later.
- All right, Anne.

222
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:18,129
- Down with Nazis!
- Boo, Nazis!

223
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,958
Daddy, I have some news.

224
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,428
I'm going to be playing Anne Frank
in the school play.

225
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,144
The school play?
I thought that you want to be a movie star.

226
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:05,674
Daddy, I have some news.

227
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:08,781
I'm going to be playing Anne Frank
in the school play.

228
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,664
Jew broad, right? Anne Frank?
She was Jewish?

229
00:16:11,765 --> 00:16:15,148
Can I just say this, okay? In my office...

230
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:19,374
I wouldn't mind if it was 30%, 40%,
maybe even 70%...

231
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,517
but ever since
we took the company public...

232
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:24,239
being in a board meeting
is like being in a fucking synagogue!

233
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:26,927
I hear the suffixes of the surnames
around me, and it's all like...

234
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,186
bloom, berg, witz, stein, gold,
schtickman, hackman...

235
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:33,108
You know, I swear to God, I feel threatened.

236
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,759
I'm not kidding, that's how I feel.
I feel like a minority.

237
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,454
Kathy?

238
00:16:37,557 --> 00:16:40,012
Kimberly, we've talked about this.

239
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,419
I would really like it
if you'd start calling me Mom.

240
00:16:42,517 --> 00:16:43,946
- Kathy?
- No.

241
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,864
- Yes, Kimberly?
- Do you fuck dogs?

242
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,459
You know they're just looking for an excuse.

243
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,835
They're looking for an excuse to fire me,
just looking.

244
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:54,479
Sometimes I hear them talk and I think,
they're communicating with each other...

245
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:58,443
in some kind of secret Yid-code
that I'm not privy to. I swear to God.

246
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:00,437
Eat your moo shoo pork by the way.
It's delicious.

247
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:02,541
- I don't like this kind.
- It's fucking delicious. Eat it.

248
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:05,809
Last week's meeting, there's a guy there,
he's coughing, right?

249
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,502
He starts coughing, like a coughing fit.

250
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,540
You know, a fucking, coughing Kike, right?
So I think...

251
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:13,515
I'm sitting here, I'm looking, I'm thinking...

252
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:15,891
is he, like,
coughing in fucking Yiddish or something?

253
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,583
Like, listen to this...

254
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,961
Wait till Hank turns his back...

255
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:26,160
<i>and then stab him with a dreidel!</i>

256
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,563
- Kathy?
- Yes.

257
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:30,090
Do you fuck dogs?

258
00:17:30,198 --> 00:17:33,329
<i>It's like the fucking Titanic.
We hit an iceberg, fucking ridiculous.</i>

259
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,699
This is interesting. I read about this.

260
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:38,449
This is a phase. It's called repetition.

261
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:40,622
It's when they feel the need to repeat things.

262
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,700
Kathy? I got it. Fine.

263
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,931
Kimberly, listen to me. Okay?
I'm going to say something to you.

264
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:50,258
There is a difference
between bonafide racism...

265
00:17:50,773 --> 00:17:53,740
and just speaking the truth,
which is what I'm doing here.

266
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:56,529
You understand that, right?
A big difference.

267
00:17:56,629 --> 00:18:01,266
Okay? Because racism, true racism,
stems from ignorance.

268
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,211
It is ignorant.

269
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:07,668
Now, I don't want to ever catch you
being a racist.

270
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:12,654
This is not to say you have license
to bring R. Kelly home for dinner, okay?

271
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,863
- Or banging some fucking beaner!
- Hank!

272
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,308
No, I'm just saying that I'm scared...

273
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:18,478
that she's going to repeat
some of this shit at school.

274
00:18:18,582 --> 00:18:20,883
And I know,
because these teachers, you know, hear it...

275
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:23,698
these fucking dykes, lesbians,
these feminists at the school system...

276
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,002
with their fucking rectal-ranger buddies,
you know:

277
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:29,549
"Oh, it's the parents' fault.
It's the upbringing. " Right.

278
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:33,199
As if, what, kids couldn't inherently be
fucking complete assholes on their own?

279
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:34,644
And, by the way, no swearing.

280
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:37,938
When you were fucking my dog,
he was going like this...

281
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:45,323
Kimberly, stop it!
Now you are upsetting Bobo.

282
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,012
I just got him back from the Asthma Center.

283
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:51,700
- Hello?
- Hello?

284
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,203
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello?

285
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:54,928
Kimberly!

286
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,445
You know what this is? The Jews.
They call, they hang up.

287
00:18:59,158 --> 00:18:59,757
What?

288
00:18:59,926 --> 00:19:02,130
At least she's not jumping
to some hook-nosed motherfucker...

289
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,197
Yeah, I got your card. It was great...

290
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:09,453
except my name
doesn't have an "E" after the "L."

291
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,783
And my dog's name is Bobo, not Bubbles.

292
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:15,374
And I actually turned 15.

293
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,739
No, it's okay, it's an understandable error.
I'm precocious.

294
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,609
Dad got me a digital video camera...

295
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,289
so that he can tape my violin recitals
and then watch them later...

296
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,456
instead of actually attending them
like a good parent would.

297
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:37,715
Mom, can you hang on a second?
I got another call.

298
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:39,565
Hello?

299
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,565
Kimberly, hey, it's Barry. Listen,
I remembered a couple of those jokes.

300
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,191
<i>You know,
why beer is better than a woman?</i>

301
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:47,756
Okay, great, Barry.

302
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,164
Can you hang on a second?
I'm on the other line with my mom.

303
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:51,276
<i>Sure.</i>

304
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:54,860
Hello? Hey, Mom, I'm back.

305
00:19:58,326 --> 00:20:01,622
Already? But we've only been talking for,
like, a minute.

306
00:20:04,726 --> 00:20:05,741
Okay.

307
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:11,377
Mom? I love you. Bye.

308
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:21,200
Okay, Barry, tell me.
Why is beer better than a woman?

309
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:28,717
I can't remember. You coming over?

310
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,144
Yeah, I'll be over a little later. Okay?

311
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,214
Kimberly, how many times have I told you
not to leave the table for a phone call?

312
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,107
And then when you were done
fucking my dog...

313
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,589
you laid down on my bed,
all naked and sweaty, and you said:

314
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,592
"There's nothing like hard canine cock
to satisfy my desires. "

315
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:50,221
So, how's school?

316
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:52,622
I gotta go.

317
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:54,068
- Where?
- Out.

318
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,117
- With who?
- My ass crack!

319
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:58,992
Okay, well, try to be back in time. Hey!

320
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,987
Ass crack? That's interesting.
You know, anal fixation...

321
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:07,699
Is it theoretically possible for you to shut up
for more than five seconds at a time?

322
00:21:24,694 --> 00:21:27,247
Thanks, Barry. That was nice.

323
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:35,830
You're actually good at that when
you remember to take your retainer out.

324
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,776
My turn.

325
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,864
Barry, I'm sorry, I gotta run.

326
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:46,480
I got homework, and I gotta start
memorizing a bunch of lines.

327
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:49,714
- But we'll get you next time, okay?
- Next time?

328
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,788
You say that every time, "Next time. "

329
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:56,564
I don't know, Kimberly.
I'm not going to take this anymore.

330
00:21:57,143 --> 00:22:00,787
You don't treat me right.
This is not a balanced relationship.

331
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,900
- Next time, I'll go first, okay?
- Yeah, right.

332
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:09,389
God damn it! I fall for it every time!

333
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:34,093
- I hate him! I hate him so much!
- I know, I know.

334
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:39,054
I can't believe he did that to me,
in front of Troy, in front of everybody.

335
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:42,542
Look, he's nothing. He's less than nothing.
He's nobody.

336
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:45,266
I feel like I have this fire inside of me...

337
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,822
and I just want to breathe it out,
and I want to burn him.

338
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,836
I want to watch him burn.

339
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,029
He will, Brittany. We'll burn him.

340
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,076
You and me.

341
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:01,327
How? Tell me how?

342
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:06,860
We'll talk about it. Just come over tonight.

343
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:10,262
I've invited Randa, too.
We'll all talk about it, okay?

344
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:12,910
Okay.

345
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,798
- I love you, Kimberly.
- I love you, too.

346
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:22,673
Come on.

347
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,079
<i>Wait, no, put it back on.
I want to watch The Real World.</i>

348
00:23:28,183 --> 00:23:30,190
<i>No, I hate The Real World.
Those girls are bitches.</i>

349
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:32,401
- You're a bitch.
- Yeah, well, you're a trollop.

350
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:33,747
Fine.

351
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:40,720
- I'm sorry I called you a bitch.
- It's okay. I'm sorry I called you a trollop.

352
00:23:40,823 --> 00:23:42,733
I don't even really know what one is.

353
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,621
It's a promiscuous woman,
often a prostitute.

354
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:47,407
Okay.

355
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:51,413
It is time to open up my big bag of fun.

356
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:56,144
These are assorted items that I've stolen
from Dad for our consumption this evening.

357
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:59,030
Item number one:
Dad's wine-flavored cigars.

358
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,040
Don't those things make you cough?

359
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:04,242
No, they're cigars.
You don't have to swallow. I mean, inhale.

360
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:05,782
No, thanks.

361
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,221
Are you sure, Randa?

362
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,037
To become successful actresses
you have to learn how to smoke them.

363
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:11,564
- It's trendy.
- That's true.

364
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:13,810
No, thank you, I do not smoke.

365
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:17,429
Okay. Item number two:

366
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,988
One of Dad's many, many pornos.

367
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:23,090
<i>Titty Lickers 2.
The search for Golden Curlies.</i>

368
00:24:23,192 --> 00:24:26,454
- Why would we want to watch a porno?
- 'Cause they're funny.

369
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:30,807
Besides, we have to teach Randa about sex,
and this is the best way to learn.

370
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,310
And item number three...

371
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:36,336
and I could get into real, real trouble
if I got caught with these:

372
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:38,991
- Dad's Twinkies.
- Too fattening.

373
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:43,316
Would you please stop criticizing
everything in my big bag of fun?

374
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,488
I spent a lot of time putting this together.

375
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,599
Anyway, we can barf them up later,
Queen of the Duh.

376
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,551
No, change the channel, I can't watch this.

377
00:24:51,128 --> 00:24:52,753
Martin Stivers.

378
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:56,689
- Who is Martin Stivers?
- You didn't hear about it?

379
00:24:58,008 --> 00:25:01,391
Some kid in a private school in Bel Air
just walked into his cafeteria...

380
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:03,023
with an assault rifle and opened fire.

381
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,608
- Killed, like, 10 kids.
- Twelve.

382
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:10,932
Hey, wait, that's the reporter
that's doing the feature on our school.

383
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:13,268
- I hear she's a lesbian.
- Really?

384
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:15,439
She doesn't look like a lesbian.

385
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:17,006
What is a lesbian?

386
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:19,152
<i>...knows no racial or economic boundaries...</i>

387
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:22,420
<i>that violence can stretch
far beyond the limits of the inner city.</i>

388
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,927
<i>Inside the school, there's...</i>

389
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:26,293
I have nightmares about this kid.

390
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:27,926
He wasn't sorry for it, or anything.

391
00:25:28,024 --> 00:25:30,577
And when they took him away,
he was, like, laughing.

392
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,607
Rambo.

393
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,061
In some ways, I know how he feels.

394
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,855
I mean,
there are just so many stupid, annoying...

395
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:43,156
worthless people on this planet.

396
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:48,660
They just, like,
get in the way of what you want.

397
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:52,816
<i>The shooting took place between classes,
between the first and second...</i>

398
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,986
Anyhow, let's watch the skin flick.

399
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,142
Drink up, there.
I don't want it to go to waste.

400
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:03,183
Thank you.
So I did take the car into the shop today.

401
00:26:03,288 --> 00:26:04,695
- That was fun.
- That's nice.

402
00:26:06,616 --> 00:26:08,656
And I walked in, you know...

403
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,910
and it was like this little rabbit
being chucked into this den of foxes...

404
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,997
and I swear they started licking their lips,
you know, the moment...

405
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,756
At the sight of this middle-class woman...

406
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:23,191
who obviously doesn't know
the first thing about cars...

407
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:27,150
and can be completely taken advantage of,
which is true.

408
00:26:28,568 --> 00:26:30,957
- I don't know the first thing about cars.
- Grace.

409
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:33,999
- And I'm sure I was taken advantage of...
- Grace.

410
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:38,134
- What?
- Happy Birthday.

411
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,253
- What's the matter? What is it?
- Nothing.

412
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:46,354
I was just...

413
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,940
I was just getting concerned...

414
00:26:50,937 --> 00:26:54,133
that maybe you didn't get me anything.

415
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:58,318
And I know I'm supposed to say,
"Oh, Percy, you shouldn't have"...

416
00:26:58,424 --> 00:27:01,359
but you should have.
You definitely should have.

417
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:02,392
I know.

418
00:27:02,553 --> 00:27:05,236
- What is it? What is it?
- Open it.

419
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,575
It's a little...

420
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,016
It's a little skirt. It's so cute.

421
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:24,887
Actually, it looks like it goes very well
with the blouse you're wearing.

422
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:29,105
Actually, it does.

423
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:33,237
Thank you.

424
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:36,181
You want to try it on?

425
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:39,763
- Now?
- Okay.

426
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:43,599
Okay.

427
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,760
One sec, okay. Here I go, one second.

428
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,503
Where are you going?

429
00:27:57,113 --> 00:28:00,047
Why don't you change right here?
We are married, for Christ's sake.

430
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:01,560
If you want.

431
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:05,936
Okay.

432
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,760
- It's a nice color.
- Yes.

433
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,457
Yep.

434
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:31,154
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

435
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:34,449
- That's...
- Good?

436
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:36,120
That's...

437
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:39,864
- That's very good.
- Really?

438
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,928
Actually, you're right.

439
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:45,781
Thank you.

440
00:28:50,393 --> 00:28:54,484
God, it reminds me of those skirts
that the girls wear at your school.

441
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,794
Really?

442
00:28:57,753 --> 00:29:01,583
Yeah. I hadn't...
I wouldn't have noticed that. That's...

443
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:06,318
- One sec. Don't move.
- Okay.

444
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:14,126
Be right back.

445
00:29:24,442 --> 00:29:26,351
I'm a little school girl.

446
00:29:30,425 --> 00:29:32,335
I don't want to be late for class.

447
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:35,256
I don't want Mr. Anderson to spank me.

448
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:56,114
Yeah, that's nice.

449
00:30:06,266 --> 00:30:07,695
I have an idea.

450
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,141
Read this.

451
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:23,096
"Why I deserve to be punished. "

452
00:30:28,377 --> 00:30:30,549
Out loud. You read it out loud.

453
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,188
"I have misbehaved.

454
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:38,674
"Some adjectives that could be used...

455
00:30:40,697 --> 00:30:42,705
"to describe my behavior...

456
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:46,929
"include bad...

457
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,370
"naughty, mischievous...

458
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:56,596
"mischievous...

459
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,869
"nasty...

460
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,348
"and downright inconsiderate. "

461
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:06,451
Oh, frisky.

462
00:31:12,442 --> 00:31:15,791
I like this music.
Can you buy the soundtrack to pornos?

463
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,710
"Tiffany Minx, Stephanie Swift. "

464
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:23,318
Brittany, a lot of these porn stars
have names that sound like ours.

465
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:26,168
So if we wanted to, when we grow up,
we could be porn stars.

466
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,746
- You couldn't, Randa, I'm sorry.
- That is quite all right.

467
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,411
I would never want to be a porn star.

468
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,456
My sister's ex-boyfriend,
he lives in the Valley...

469
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:35,417
he used to go out with one.
You know what they did?

470
00:31:35,513 --> 00:31:39,408
They took the fat out of her butt
and her arms, and they put it in her boobs.

471
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,880
Yeah.

472
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:44,401
How is it, please, that two men...

473
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:46,831
at one time...

474
00:31:48,186 --> 00:31:49,680
How can this be?

475
00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:54,417
One of them is doing her up the butt.

476
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:56,535
Up the...

477
00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:59,218
Such a thing is not possible.

478
00:31:59,994 --> 00:32:02,296
It is too small, the aperture.

479
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:09,429
Kimberly, would you let someone
do that to you?

480
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:10,994
I have.

481
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:13,782
- No, way!
- Yes, way.

482
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:16,751
- You're such a liar. Who?
- Warren.

483
00:32:18,746 --> 00:32:21,135
- Warren Prescott?
- Affirmative.

484
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:23,833
When? How?

485
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,961
Last year. We were sort of going out.

486
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:29,845
We were here, kind of getting drunk
on my dad's Captain Morgan...

487
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:31,735
and he just kind of came right out
and said...

488
00:32:31,834 --> 00:32:35,544
We've been going out for three months now,
and I really love you, and everything.

489
00:32:35,642 --> 00:32:38,260
So I was wondering
if you might let me pack your fudge chute.

490
00:32:41,114 --> 00:32:43,700
At first I thought
he wanted to make sundaes...

491
00:32:43,802 --> 00:32:45,625
<i>but then he elaborated.</i>

492
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:47,510
<i>He was very polite about it.</i>

493
00:32:47,611 --> 00:32:50,742
<i>He said please three times.
I couldn't really bring myself to say no.</i>

494
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:56,153
Well, what was it like?

495
00:32:58,426 --> 00:32:59,670
It was okay.

496
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,679
Did it hurt?

497
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:06,771
Kind of.

498
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:14,101
But it hurt less with Warren
than it might have with other boys...

499
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:17,268
- if you catch my drift.
- Kimberly!

500
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:20,567
- What is your drift?
- Never mind.

501
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,052
But you know what?
A few days later, Warren broke up with me.

502
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:27,154
He said he doesn't want to go out with a girl
who'd let a guy do that to her.

503
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:29,779
- Does that make any sense?
- Boys are so weird.

504
00:33:29,947 --> 00:33:31,474
Amen to that.

505
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:33,136
Wait a minute, I like this one.

506
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:34,900
<i>- Hi, Stephanie.
- Hi.</i>

507
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:37,174
<i>Are you here to help me change the oil?</i>

508
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:41,465
<i>You know, I could never give up men,
because I like cock too much.</i>

509
00:33:41,882 --> 00:33:43,409
<i>But I don't know...</i>

510
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:47,283
<i>sometimes I just feel like
I need a woman's touch.</i>

511
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,718
<i>I know what you mean.</i>

512
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,227
Why is that woman...

513
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:58,327
Why is she doing those things
with that other woman?

514
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:02,676
- Why must they show this?
- 'Cause men like to watch it.

515
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:04,848
But it is a sin.

516
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:10,201
Randa, you're going to find out
that a lot of things men like are a sin.

517
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:15,798
Kimberly, tell me you've never done that.

518
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:20,497
- Kimberly?
- What?

519
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:34,898
- You okay, Randa?
- Yes.

520
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:39,764
- Did you get it all out, every last calorie?
- Yes, I think so.

521
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:41,208
Good.

522
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:43,540
Kimberly?

523
00:34:44,443 --> 00:34:47,443
You and Troy never actually, like,
did anything, right?

524
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:52,565
No. Brittany, for the 20 millionth time...

525
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:55,539
me and Troy never, like, did anything.

526
00:34:56,283 --> 00:34:59,927
- And it's 'cause Troy didn't want to, right?
- Right.

527
00:35:00,923 --> 00:35:03,956
Brittany, you know that.
That's why I dumped him.

528
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:10,034
It's just weird,
'cause with me he's, like, insatiable.

529
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:13,782
I wonder why that is?

530
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:15,673
I'm finished.

531
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:21,689
Okay, girls, it's time to get serious.

532
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:24,499
Oh, no, you're not going to make us write...

533
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:26,643
Amnesty International letters again,
are you?

534
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,635
I swear, most of those people deserve
to be in prison.

535
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:31,098
No. Okay, just listen to me.

536
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:36,602
It seems that all three of us
have something in common.

537
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:38,843
Do you know what that is?

538
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:42,171
Our health, happiness, and faith in God.

539
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,041
No, I'm talking about Mr. Anderson.

540
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,969
What about him?

541
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:54,775
He's done stuff to all three of us.

542
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:00,474
I hate him. I hate him so much!

543
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:04,728
- Yes, he is a bad man.
- I know, girls.

544
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,928
So I've been thinking.

545
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:13,428
I've been thinking that maybe it's about time
we put a stop to him.

546
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,402
Remove all jewelry, watches,
earrings, rings...

547
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:24,282
and place them in the box.
You know the drill, people.

548
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:26,805
A metal detector at Roxbury?

549
00:36:26,907 --> 00:36:29,689
Yeah, everybody's freaked out
'cause of what happened over in Bel Air.

550
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,170
They don't want it to happen here, I'm sure.
They figured it out.

551
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,512
Ain't nobody safe,
no matter how rich you are.

552
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:37,172
Ain't nobody safe.

553
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:39,090
Next!

554
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,281
Are you sure about this, Kimberly?
I'm scared.

555
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:46,260
Don't be. We're doing the right thing.

556
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:51,794
They're going to try and discredit us,
and turn us against each other...

557
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,729
but we have to stand firm, okay?
We have to stick together, no matter what.

558
00:36:55,836 --> 00:36:56,850
Okay.

559
00:36:57,948 --> 00:36:59,857
Then we'll watch him burn.

560
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:04,084
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

561
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:09,972
<i>Behind me lies one of L.A. County's
most exclusive private schools.</i>

562
00:37:10,076 --> 00:37:11,864
<i>Roxbury Academy in Beverly Hills.</i>

563
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:15,383
A safe haven for the children
of the rich and the privileged.

564
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,785
A place where they can study
in peace and harmony...

565
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:21,179
free from the troubles that plague
many of the region's public schools...

566
00:37:21,275 --> 00:37:25,236
<i>until today.
Because, today, this hallowed institution...</i>

567
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,399
<i>was rocked on its very foundations
with allegations of sexual assault.</i>

568
00:37:29,755 --> 00:37:32,144
<i>The accused, Percy Anderson...</i>

569
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:34,419
<i>an English and Drama teacher...</i>

570
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:38,004
<i>and new addition this year
to Roxbury's distinguished faculty.</i>

571
00:37:38,108 --> 00:37:39,766
<i>The alleged victims...</i>

572
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:42,901
three 15-year-old sophomore girls...

573
00:37:43,004 --> 00:37:46,102
all of whom have waived their right
to anonymity.

574
00:37:46,204 --> 00:37:50,776
<i>Their names are, Kimberly Joyce,
Brittany Wells, and Randa Azzouni.</i>

575
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,682
I will continue to bring you more
of the details...

576
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:56,210
of this stunning story as it unfolds.

577
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,960
<i>For Team 33 News,
this is Emily Klein in Beverly Hills.</i>

578
00:38:00,604 --> 00:38:01,848
Okay, cut.

579
00:38:02,172 --> 00:38:03,961
That was fucking great!

580
00:38:05,212 --> 00:38:07,601
You were so fucking good!

581
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:15,355
<i>I can't believe this is happening.</i>

582
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:18,648
How are we going to afford a lawyer,
on what we make?

583
00:38:18,972 --> 00:38:23,478
What kind of a country are we living in
when a trio of little tramps...

584
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,020
can besmirch an innocent man's name
with completely fabricated accusations?

585
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,918
Wow, that was really good use
of the word besmirch.

586
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,067
Thank you.

587
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:37,555
Guys, what would you say if I told you
I got a lawyer?

588
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,186
I mean a great lawyer.

589
00:38:39,292 --> 00:38:42,139
Really smart guy,
he's like a borderline genius.

590
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:45,585
And I think I can get him to do it for free,
a nominal fee, at most.

591
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:47,547
Okay, who?

592
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:51,418
Me, Perc. I'm talking about me.

593
00:38:51,516 --> 00:38:53,687
Roger, this isn't a joke, okay?
This is my life.

594
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:56,635
I need a real lawyer,
not a high-school Law teacher.

595
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:58,674
Okay, look,
what you seem to be forgetting is that...

596
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,820
I'm not just a high-school Law teacher,
all right?

597
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:02,834
I passed the Bar in '96.

598
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,256
So, technically, I'm licensed to practice law
in the State of California.

599
00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:07,379
I understand, Roger.

600
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:10,299
Technically, you can practice law,
but you're not a practicing lawyer.

601
00:39:10,397 --> 00:39:12,786
No, I'm not,
but I'll be better than a public defender.

602
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,576
What I lack in experience,
you know I'll make up for with insight.

603
00:39:15,676 --> 00:39:18,840
I know you, I know the school,
and I know these girls.

604
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,274
Look at me, man, I'm your guy.

605
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,238
I don't... What's the point?

606
00:39:25,757 --> 00:39:28,604
Nobody's going to believe me.
I'm never gonna beat this.

607
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,115
What kind of attitude is that?
I already have a foolproof strategy.

608
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:36,279
I saw this in a movie once, all right?
Look, we say one of your arms is dead...

609
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,537
useless. Then, at a crucial point in the trial,
I throw a jar at you...

610
00:39:40,636 --> 00:39:44,433
and you catch it with your other hand,
thus proving your innocence.

611
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,067
You are an idiot.

612
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:50,070
Which arm do we say is dead?

613
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,163
- Well, which hand did you grope them with?
- Roger.

614
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,243
Roger, let me make something clear to you,
all right?

615
00:39:56,348 --> 00:40:00,058
I didn't touch these girls. Never. Not once.
Not one of them.

616
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:01,848
Let me make something clear to you, okay?

617
00:40:01,948 --> 00:40:04,315
If I'm gonna be your lawyer,
I don't wanna know if you did it.

618
00:40:04,413 --> 00:40:06,268
I don't care. It's irrelevant.

619
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:08,820
- Okay, but...
- No, listen to me.

620
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:13,240
I don't want to know. Got it?

621
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:25,107
<i>Now I'm running my fingers
along your chest.</i>

622
00:40:25,405 --> 00:40:29,365
<i>And my red nails
are ripping through your chest hair...</i>

623
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:31,866
<i>like fire through a forest.</i>

624
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,521
What am I doing to you?

625
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:40,987
I've got my thumb so far up your ass,
I'm bowling with your ass.

626
00:40:41,085 --> 00:40:42,612
- Okay? I'm...
- Hank!

627
00:40:42,716 --> 00:40:43,861
Yeah!

628
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:47,896
Okay, so that Evers report, I think,
is due on Monday, is it not?

629
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:49,753
- Yeah...
- Hank, have you seen Bobo?

630
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:52,187
That stupid dog pissed all over my Manolos.

631
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:54,423
Fuck Bobo, okay? Yeah, okay, and the nips?

632
00:40:54,525 --> 00:40:56,794
That shipment is coming in...
That's tomorrow, I think.

633
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:58,453
Talking to Moishe.

634
00:40:58,877 --> 00:41:00,633
<i>Yeah. Shalom.</i>

635
00:41:01,213 --> 00:41:03,798
<i>Yeah, I'll see you at the mezuzah, okay?</i>

636
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:05,465
Fucking Hebs, you know, I got...

637
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:08,598
What, you can't see
that I'm working here? Hello?

638
00:41:12,253 --> 00:41:16,148
Never mind. Bobo! Fucking dog!

639
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:17,747
Run, Bobo, run.

640
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:25,628
Still there?
Fuck, are you kidding? I got teak.

641
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:42,907
Knock, knock.

642
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,940
You okay, Daddy?

643
00:42:17,277 --> 00:42:18,292
Yeah.

644
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:22,524
Kimberly, you're a smart girl.

645
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,638
So before you decided to do this thing
that you're doing...

646
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:32,186
gee, I hope you thought long
and hard about it.

647
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:36,182
I hope you thought about
what it's going to mean for Daddy.

648
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:38,646
What are you saying?

649
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:41,335
Well, you know,
Daddy's name isn't just his name.

650
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:43,772
It's also a brand name...

651
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:47,514
and people associate brand names
with certain qualities.

652
00:42:47,614 --> 00:42:51,029
For instance,
when people hear the name Walt Disney...

653
00:42:51,742 --> 00:42:53,629
they think, "family friendly"...

654
00:42:53,726 --> 00:42:56,246
even though Disney gives benefits
to faggots.

655
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,540
And when they hear the name Henry Joyce,
do you know what they think of?

656
00:43:01,086 --> 00:43:04,085
- What?
- "Quality electronics at the lowest prices. "

657
00:43:04,189 --> 00:43:06,491
And I want it to stay that way, Kimberly.

658
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:11,165
I don't want them thinking,
"Slutty daughter, who takes it in the ass. "

659
00:43:12,158 --> 00:43:14,809
So if it turns out that you were...

660
00:43:15,742 --> 00:43:17,433
somehow making all this up...

661
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:19,672
- How can you say that?
- No, I'm not saying anything.

662
00:43:19,774 --> 00:43:23,123
It's just, you know how people
always want to blame the parents...

663
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,052
and it just drives me fucking crazy.

664
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:29,209
Daddy, I would never do anything
to hurt you or your reputation.

665
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:31,381
Yay, Kimberly. Good, good. That's...

666
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,460
Kimberly? Kimberly.

667
00:43:33,726 --> 00:43:35,930
Would you please take your dog for a walk?

668
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:39,128
- Are you done fucking him?
- Enough of that already.

669
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,757
What? I saw her.

670
00:43:40,862 --> 00:43:45,302
Her red nails were running through
his chest hair like fire through a forest.

671
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:48,185
That's actually kind of poetic.

672
00:43:51,102 --> 00:43:52,149
Okay.

673
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:56,595
I've said what I've had to say here.

674
00:43:56,702 --> 00:44:00,564
I just do wish you would've told me before
you went and started this thing because...

675
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,347
I'm sure it will be fine,
because these things never go to trial.

676
00:44:04,446 --> 00:44:07,894
And so day one of the Roxbury
sexual assault trial is set to begin.

677
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:11,575
<i>Stay tuned to Team 33 News
for more updates, throughout the day.</i>

678
00:44:11,678 --> 00:44:13,205
I'm Emily Klein.

679
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:15,322
Okay, cut.

680
00:44:16,094 --> 00:44:18,297
- This is huge.
- Fucking huge.

681
00:44:18,398 --> 00:44:21,976
Can you believe this all started out
as a wimpy little special-interest feature?

682
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:24,828
They give me fluff, and I turn it into dirt.

683
00:44:25,438 --> 00:44:28,820
- You know what that is?
- It's hot. It's fucking hot.

684
00:44:29,438 --> 00:44:32,307
No, it's talent. Here, wait here.

685
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:37,047
Kimberly. Hi. Off the record...

686
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:42,394
I just want to say
that I really admire your courage.

687
00:44:42,782 --> 00:44:44,309
Thank you, Emily.

688
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,336
I'm doing this
because I feel like I have a responsibility.

689
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:53,082
Not just to myself but to all the other girls
all around the world...

690
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:55,091
- who have been subjected to harassment.
- Yes.

691
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:58,711
Or, God forbid, outright assault
at the hands of teachers...

692
00:44:59,262 --> 00:45:02,524
and who are too scared
or ashamed to come forth.

693
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:08,216
I'm fighting a battle
inside these walls, Emily...

694
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,582
but I'm also fighting a war.

695
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,446
You have such passion and conviction.

696
00:45:16,863 --> 00:45:19,994
You kind of remind me of myself
when I was your age.

697
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:23,826
I only wish I'd had half your self-assurance.

698
00:45:25,086 --> 00:45:26,613
Thank you, Emily.

699
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:31,192
And, off the record...

700
00:45:33,118 --> 00:45:37,341
I could never give up men.
I like cock too much.

701
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:42,458
But sometimes I just need a woman's touch.

702
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,469
Hi.

703
00:45:56,831 --> 00:45:59,067
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

704
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,533
Mr. Nicholl, you may cross-examine.

705
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:05,018
After you.

706
00:46:07,647 --> 00:46:08,956
Your Honor.

707
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:13,370
Well, well, well.

708
00:46:15,327 --> 00:46:18,109
That's quite a story you've spun for us,
Miss Joyce.

709
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:21,982
Very detailed, and might I say, very graphic.

710
00:46:23,166 --> 00:46:26,101
But let me ask you something,
is any of it true?

711
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,403
Or is it all just a malicious fabrication...

712
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:32,666
designed to discredit
and humiliate the man...

713
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,830
that replaced you as the lead
in the school play?

714
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:40,823
I wouldn't perjure myself, Mr. Nicholl,
not for any reason.

715
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:43,259
I'm sure you wouldn't, Kimberly.

716
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:47,613
But tell me, why do you think you were fired
from the role of Anne Frank?

717
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:53,341
I suppose it was because of something
I said in the cafeteria...

718
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,805
during the International Food Fair...

719
00:46:55,902 --> 00:46:58,936
which I organized to raise money
for the Drama Club, as well as...

720
00:46:59,038 --> 00:47:02,813
foster a spirit of togetherness among
the multicultural community at Roxbury.

721
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:05,333
Would you care to recount this incident
to the court?

722
00:47:05,439 --> 00:47:06,683
Certainly.

723
00:47:07,615 --> 00:47:10,365
It was during lunch hour,
back in September.

724
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,726
The Food Fair was on...

725
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,870
and you and Mr. Anderson
were supervising...

726
00:47:14,975 --> 00:47:16,949
so you had to eat lunch with the students.

727
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,636
<i>You were sitting at a table in the corner...</i>

728
00:47:19,743 --> 00:47:22,231
<i>and Brittany and I could see you
from our table, where we sat...</i>

729
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:25,684
<i>- eating granola and low-fat yogurt.
- Could you hear what we were saying?</i>

730
00:47:25,983 --> 00:47:28,852
<i>No, but you sure looked at us a lot.</i>

731
00:47:30,462 --> 00:47:32,121
That Kimberly Joyce.

732
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:35,764
What about her?

733
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:40,500
She's a very good student.
She's very bright.

734
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:43,773
You sure about that?

735
00:47:44,543 --> 00:47:47,926
Yeah, she's a fantastic actress, as well.

736
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:50,876
Let me tell you something
about Kimberly Joyce.

737
00:47:50,975 --> 00:47:53,758
Last year, her freshman year,
she took a standard IQ test...

738
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,539
obliterated all school records.
Nobody believed it.

739
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,868
They figured she was cheating,
so they made her take it again.

740
00:47:59,967 --> 00:48:03,229
She scored even higher.
Made her take it a third time.

741
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,133
Guess what happened on the third time?
Her test broke the computer.

742
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:11,129
- It broke... She scored that high?
- No, she didn't.

743
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,934
She penciled in those little circles
to spell "fuck you. "

744
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,714
- Does that break the computer?
- My point is this:

745
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,554
You have brains like that,
you have the face of an angel...

746
00:48:22,656 --> 00:48:26,911
throw in a ripe little pubescent body
bursting out of that uniform...

747
00:48:28,768 --> 00:48:30,590
- that spells trouble.
- Okay.

748
00:48:30,688 --> 00:48:34,910
The devil wears a gray skirt, my friend,
and her name is Kimberly Joyce.

749
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:37,789
Earlier this week, in detention...

750
00:48:38,943 --> 00:48:40,983
I could have sworn
she was coming on to me.

751
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,942
Of course she was coming on to you.

752
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:44,828
Do you want to know why
she was coming on to you?

753
00:48:44,928 --> 00:48:47,895
'Cause she knows
you can't do anything about it, that's why.

754
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:49,592
And forget English, Math, Science.

755
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:53,078
For them,
high school is all cock-teasing 101.

756
00:48:53,407 --> 00:48:57,052
And I got news for you.
Those two are on the honor role.

757
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:01,080
I mean, look at them.
Look at them over there.

758
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,939
Whispering. Giggling.

759
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:05,717
You know exactly what they're saying, too.

760
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,328
Brittany, God, Mr. Nicholl is so sexy.

761
00:49:10,623 --> 00:49:13,274
I mean, he's got such a cute ass.

762
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:17,373
You know, one time I saw Mr. Nicholl
when he thought I wasn't looking.

763
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:20,734
He picked a booger out of his nose,
and then he ate it.

764
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:25,757
You know what, Perc?
Any moment now, they're going to walk by...

765
00:49:25,856 --> 00:49:28,605
and they're going to bat their eyelashes,
and they're going to wave.

766
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:30,743
Just the fingers, not the hand.

767
00:49:30,848 --> 00:49:34,426
And they're going to expect us
to respond like big drooling lapdogs...

768
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:37,462
which, ordinarily, we would.
But guess what? Not today.

769
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,022
Because it ends right now.

770
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:43,839
We're going to give them
the barest of acknowledgment.

771
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:46,205
A simple head nod, if they're lucky.

772
00:49:46,304 --> 00:49:50,046
Tonight, they're going to lie in bed,
wide awake...

773
00:49:50,144 --> 00:49:51,834
and they're going to wonder why.

774
00:49:51,936 --> 00:49:55,198
They're going to wonder,
"Where has my power gone?"

775
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:00,981
- Hi, Mr. Anderson.
- Hi, Mr. Nicholl.

776
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,454
- Hi, girls.
- Hi, girls.

777
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,709
God damn it.

778
00:50:12,224 --> 00:50:13,172
Show me, where is it? Come on.

779
00:50:13,984 --> 00:50:16,471
What, do you not speak English?
Come on, show me. Where is it?

780
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:18,845
What? Just show me where Palestine is?

781
00:50:18,944 --> 00:50:20,831
What's going on? Randa, are you okay?

782
00:50:20,928 --> 00:50:23,611
All I'm asking is she locate Palestine
on a map. Okay?

783
00:50:23,712 --> 00:50:25,817
Come on, show me. Where is it?
I mean, where is it?

784
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,055
She can't show me.

785
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,422
'Cause there never has been, and there
never will be any country called Palestine.

786
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,375
Josh Horowitz,
I think it's really low of you...

787
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:35,195
to bring divisive politics
into this Food Fair...

788
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:37,662
when the purpose of it
was to foster a spirit of togetherness...

789
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,418
among Roxbury's international community...

790
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,408
as well as to raise money
for the Drama Club.

791
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:44,187
Yeah? Well, forgive me,
but you were kind of tempting fate...

792
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:46,360
by putting Israel next to Palestine.

793
00:50:46,464 --> 00:50:48,406
I mean,
what kind of fucking diplomacy is that?

794
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:50,203
God help us if you ever become UN Leader.

795
00:50:50,304 --> 00:50:51,481
It'd be like World War III.

796
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:55,032
I don't want to become UN Leader,
I want to become an actress, so there.

797
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:59,838
Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll be a good one,
because right now you're acting like a bitch.

798
00:50:59,968 --> 00:51:02,139
What are you laughing at, Sudan?

799
00:51:04,512 --> 00:51:07,861
And, Josh, at least my dad
isn't a money-grubbing Jew shyster...

800
00:51:07,968 --> 00:51:09,976
who lets criminals go free.

801
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,128
Oops.

802
00:51:17,888 --> 00:51:19,262
Rewind.

803
00:51:20,992 --> 00:51:23,610
- It seems like you run a tight ship here.
- Yes, a very tight ship.

804
00:51:23,712 --> 00:51:26,101
The parents pay handsomely.
They should expect nothing less.

805
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,274
Can you tell us, say, about a typical
complaint you might field from a parent?

806
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:31,067
Complaints are few and far between
at Roxbury.

807
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:33,656
I'm sorry, but we're going to have to end
this conversation today.

808
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,510
If there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask. I like your suit.

809
00:51:36,608 --> 00:51:38,267
- Thanks again.
- Cut.

810
00:51:38,368 --> 00:51:39,929
Lesbian bitch!

811
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:42,683
I know exactly what's going on here.
They gave her a puff piece...

812
00:51:42,785 --> 00:51:46,462
she resents it, and she's digging for dirt.
God knows, she'll find it around here.

813
00:51:46,688 --> 00:51:49,535
Charles, you wanted to see me
about something?

814
00:51:51,521 --> 00:51:54,390
I want you to replace Kimberly Joyce
in the play. Find a new lead.

815
00:51:54,496 --> 00:51:57,845
I can't do that. She's the best actress
in the school. We go up in two weeks.

816
00:51:57,952 --> 00:51:58,934
Well, I'm sorry...

817
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,982
but we can't have our Anne Frank
running around...

818
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:03,706
making anti-Semitic remarks.
That's a level of irony...

819
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:06,264
I just don't want to have happening
under this roof.

820
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:09,947
I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it,
Charles. They're just kids, after all.

821
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,997
Percy, replace her.

822
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:14,846
Now is not the time to court controversy.

823
00:52:15,425 --> 00:52:17,629
- Very well.
- And another thing...

824
00:52:18,688 --> 00:52:21,372
be extra careful to behave yourself.

825
00:52:24,065 --> 00:52:27,513
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

826
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:47,097
We will not tolerate racial slurs at Roxbury.

827
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:49,722
Now, you can use them at any other time...

828
00:52:49,825 --> 00:52:52,214
at home, at the mall,
at rock-'n'- roll concerts...

829
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,841
but when you're under my roof
you will respect the heritage...

830
00:52:54,944 --> 00:52:58,556
of every student and faculty member.
Do I make myself clear?

831
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:00,763
Yes, sir.

832
00:53:02,624 --> 00:53:05,242
The ironic thing is
my dad isn't even tight with money.

833
00:53:05,345 --> 00:53:07,450
I mean, he owns three sports cars,
and he just bought me...

834
00:53:07,553 --> 00:53:09,691
this rare, expensive kind of dog
that only eats tuna fish.

835
00:53:09,793 --> 00:53:11,833
Okay, Josh, you've had your say.

836
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:15,675
Kimberly, is there anything
that you'd like to tell Mr. Horowitz?

837
00:53:17,857 --> 00:53:20,028
I don't know what came over me.

838
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:25,628
My dad is something of a racist,
and I tend to pick things up at home.

839
00:53:27,617 --> 00:53:30,300
Always starts with the parents, doesn't it?

840
00:53:30,401 --> 00:53:33,598
But still, I do think that you owe
Mr. Horowitz an apology.

841
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:37,791
I'm sorry about what I said about your dad.

842
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:40,758
It's okay. You were partly right.

843
00:53:40,865 --> 00:53:43,167
My dad does let criminals go free.

844
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:45,853
He's really good at it.

845
00:53:47,297 --> 00:53:49,663
<i>- Potato latke?
- Too fattening.</i>

846
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:51,159
They're yummy.

847
00:54:07,073 --> 00:54:09,975
Okay. Well, I'm glad
we could smooth that over.

848
00:54:10,593 --> 00:54:13,626
Why don't you two
just hurry on back to class now?

849
00:54:21,153 --> 00:54:23,487
I'm sorry, Kimberly,
my hands are tied on this one.

850
00:54:23,585 --> 00:54:25,974
No, Mr. Anderson, you can't do this.

851
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:29,565
- Playing Anne Frank means so much to me!
- I know.

852
00:54:31,042 --> 00:54:34,238
You know, right before my brother Sean
left for "Operation Iraqi Freedom"...

853
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,119
he gave me a present.
Do you know what it was?

854
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:39,836
<i>- No.
- The Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

855
00:54:46,433 --> 00:54:49,467
Come on,
do you really expect me to believe that?

856
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:55,961
I'm not going to forget this.

857
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,817
You're being really cool
about this, Kimberly.

858
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:16,953
I thought you might be mad.

859
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:20,858
Don't be silly.
I wouldn't let a play ruin our friendship.

860
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:23,995
I'm glad.

861
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,421
<i>Then I helped Brittany dye her hair...</i>

862
00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:30,904
because, as you know,
Anne Frank wasn't a blonde.

863
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:34,076
Yes, I do know that, but thank you.

864
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:37,623
Let me ask you something, Kimberly.
Didn't it make you angry...

865
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:41,691
when Mr. Anderson told you
he was replacing you with Brittany Wells?

866
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:43,744
I don't know.

867
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:48,344
You don't know?

868
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:52,959
Look at that, she doesn't know.
Well, thank God I know.

869
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:56,513
Didn't you want to get back at him?

870
00:55:56,738 --> 00:55:58,047
- No.
- No?

871
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,040
Miss Joyce, isn't it possible
that you are infatuated with Mr. Anderson?

872
00:56:03,521 --> 00:56:06,587
Isn't it possible
that you were trying to seduce him?

873
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:10,105
And that you thought that the play
might even bring you closer to him?

874
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:11,387
No.

875
00:56:13,569 --> 00:56:15,130
Hold that thought.

876
00:56:17,090 --> 00:56:20,439
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now present to you, Exhibit A.

877
00:56:20,674 --> 00:56:22,048
Your Honor.

878
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:27,037
An essay, written by you, Miss Joyce,
during detention with Mr. Anderson...

879
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:29,440
as punishment for talking during his class.

880
00:56:29,537 --> 00:56:32,669
An essay that you read out loud,
as per his request.

881
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:34,941
Isn't this correct, Miss Joyce?

882
00:56:35,041 --> 00:56:37,758
- Yes, that's correct.
- Yes. That's what I thought.

883
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:41,338
Do me a favor, would you?
Read that out loud to the court.

884
00:56:43,842 --> 00:56:46,209
Okay, but I'm kind of embarrassed.

885
00:56:46,305 --> 00:56:48,640
Embarrassed? Well, well, well.

886
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,551
Why are you embarrassed, Kimberly?

887
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:56,156
I wanted to get it done quickly,
and I didn't do a very good job.

888
00:56:56,834 --> 00:56:59,223
I mean, I just, you know,
want to let the court know...

889
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:03,127
that this essay does not necessarily reflect
my writing abilities.

890
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,405
Nobody cares
about your writing abilities, Kimberly.

891
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,872
Just read your essay, please. Thank you.

892
00:57:15,554 --> 00:57:17,758
"Why I deserve to be punished.

893
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:21,053
"I have misbehaved.

894
00:57:21,634 --> 00:57:25,049
"Some adjectives that could be used
to describe my behavior...

895
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:26,845
"include bad...

896
00:57:27,554 --> 00:57:32,027
"naughty, mischievous, nasty...

897
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:35,098
"and downright inconsiderate.

898
00:57:35,714 --> 00:57:38,464
"I should know better than to talk in class.

899
00:57:38,594 --> 00:57:40,667
"My mother always taught me
not to talk too much...

900
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:43,226
"and when I did, she used to spank me.

901
00:57:44,578 --> 00:57:48,124
"She'd spank me so hard that it hurt.

902
00:57:49,282 --> 00:57:51,519
"In conclusion, I have learned my lesson...

903
00:57:51,618 --> 00:57:54,401
"and I promise not to misbehave
in the future.

904
00:57:54,786 --> 00:57:56,215
"But if I do...

905
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,549
"I will gladly accept any punishment...

906
00:58:00,706 --> 00:58:02,561
"you choose to hand down. "

907
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:06,912
So, that's it. I'm done. Can I go?

908
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:10,018
- Yeah.
- Goodie.

909
00:58:12,386 --> 00:58:15,256
I'll take that. That stays here.

910
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:30,203
That's it, I'm done. Can I go?

911
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:38,047
One moment, Your Honor.

912
00:58:42,082 --> 00:58:45,082
- What the fuck was that supposed to prove?
- It wasn't anything like that.

913
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:48,351
I swear to God, it's all in the delivery, Roger.

914
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:57,495
Miss Joyce, do me a favor, would you?
Would you read that again, please?

915
00:58:57,603 --> 00:58:59,708
And this time I'd love for you
to do it seductively.

916
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:03,127
All right? Just try to make the words sexy.

917
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:08,640
You want me to act sexy for you,
Mr. Nicholl?

918
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:12,317
- Mr. Nicholl?
- Some leeway, please, Your Honor.

919
00:59:12,994 --> 00:59:14,271
Very well.

920
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:18,234
Miss Joyce, would you please try
and do what he asks?

921
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:21,209
Please, I appreciate that.

922
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:33,468
Okay, look, I'm really trying,
but I don't know how to be sexy.

923
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:36,091
- I mean, I'm only 15!
- It's okay, dear.

924
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:40,287
Mr. Nicholl, if you have no more questions,
then court is adjourned...

925
00:59:40,387 --> 00:59:42,656
and we'll continue this tomorrow.

926
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,690
Are you all right, dear?

927
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:13,088
Bet you've never seen one like that before.

928
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:16,700
Silly boy, over 60% of guys are circumcised.

929
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,292
Right.

930
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:22,681
I like it. It's cute.

931
01:00:24,419 --> 01:00:27,387
- It is?
- Yes, and you're cute.

932
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:30,233
- I am?
- Yes.

933
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:35,648
- So did you ask him?
- No.

934
01:00:36,547 --> 01:00:40,322
- Josh, you said you would.
- I know, I will. I just...

935
01:00:41,539 --> 01:00:44,157
It doesn't make sense to me.
I don't understand why.

936
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:46,364
It doesn't have to make sense.

937
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,369
All that matters is that I want you to.
It would make me happy.

938
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:54,206
You want to make me happy,
don't you, Josh?

939
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:57,340
- Of course I do, you're amazing.
- I know.

940
01:01:00,419 --> 01:01:02,623
Miss Azzouni, now...

941
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:07,807
you were also present
at this detention in question, were you not?

942
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:12,002
Yes. I finished writing my essay
before Kimberly.

943
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,283
Mr. Anderson took me in the other room
to discuss it.

944
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:18,750
I'm sorry? Another room?

945
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:23,416
There is a small room
beside Mr. Anderson's classroom...

946
01:01:23,907 --> 01:01:25,533
<i>separated by glass.</i>

947
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:33,693
Randa, I'm going to be honest with you.
This essay is unintelligible.

948
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:36,097
You just...

949
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:39,674
Well, you just can't write competently
in the English language.

950
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:43,101
Now, what are we going to do about that?

951
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,817
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

952
01:01:47,395 --> 01:01:50,624
It's not fashionable to send your kids
to a place like this anymore.

953
01:01:50,724 --> 01:01:53,058
Elitism is out.
You want to be a good Hollywood liberal...

954
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:57,246
you send your kids to a public school.
A safe public school, mind you...

955
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:59,802
but one where they can mingle
with the common people.

956
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:02,591
Meanwhile, this relic of an institution
grows every year...

957
01:02:02,692 --> 01:02:06,336
more and more dependent
on wealthy immigrants like yourself...

958
01:02:06,532 --> 01:02:09,150
from countries where elitism
is still very much in...

959
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:10,561
to the point where...

960
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,507
there is a not-so-subtle pressure
being exerted on people like me...

961
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,709
to go easy on people like you.

962
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:20,442
Well, had you gotten virtually
any other teacher at this school...

963
01:02:21,124 --> 01:02:23,393
they'd probably turn a blind eye
to sentences like:

964
01:02:23,492 --> 01:02:25,663
"I must not speaking in class. "

965
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:31,102
Now, I know what you're thinking right now.

966
01:02:31,203 --> 01:02:34,552
You're sitting there, loathing me right now,
aren't you?

967
01:02:35,268 --> 01:02:38,017
Because good grades
are very important to your parents.

968
01:02:38,116 --> 01:02:40,026
They're vitally important.

969
01:02:42,148 --> 01:02:44,515
What are we going to do about that?

970
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:51,745
If your compositional skills don't improve
within the next year...

971
01:02:51,844 --> 01:02:54,211
I will have no trouble failing you.

972
01:02:54,756 --> 01:02:57,057
All right? Do I make myself clear?

973
01:02:58,339 --> 01:02:59,616
Look at me.

974
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:04,602
Now, I know that there's a brain here,
underneath this piece of cloth.

975
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:06,435
And when...

976
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:18,434
Now, here's what we're going to do.

977
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,785
And do you recall
any of the details of this discussion?

978
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,107
- I do not recollect the details. No.
- That's okay.

979
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:31,896
Tell me, do you remember anything...

980
01:03:32,324 --> 01:03:36,121
Mr. Anderson said to you
during that discussion, anything at all?

981
01:03:38,596 --> 01:03:43,266
Well, one thing I remember
is that he told an off-color joke.

982
01:03:46,148 --> 01:03:47,773
An off-color joke?

983
01:03:47,876 --> 01:03:52,000
Mr. Anderson told you an off-color joke.

984
01:03:53,764 --> 01:03:56,131
Could you repeat it for us, please?

985
01:03:57,252 --> 01:04:00,318
- How does an Arab impregnate his wife?
- How?

986
01:04:01,316 --> 01:04:05,594
She lies upon the bed,
he ejaculates upon the wall.

987
01:04:06,085 --> 01:04:09,248
And the rest of the duties
are left to the flies.

988
01:04:14,148 --> 01:04:16,603
And what happened next, Miss Azzouni?

989
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:18,813
Then he said:

990
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,337
"Now I'm going to touch you
on your boobs. "

991
01:04:22,436 --> 01:04:25,851
Boobs? I would never say boobs!
I'm an English teacher.

992
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:30,787
- Breasts, I would say breasts...
- Mr. Anderson, restrain yourself.

993
01:04:30,885 --> 01:04:33,470
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

994
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:36,699
Very well, Mr. Nicholl,
you may begin your cross-examination.

995
01:04:36,805 --> 01:04:39,554
All right, okay. Thank you, Your Honor.

996
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,666
Yeah. Good stuff.

997
01:04:56,676 --> 01:04:59,098
Miss Azzouni, engage me here
a little bit here, would you?

998
01:04:59,204 --> 01:05:00,830
I'm just curious.

999
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:05,017
Which hand did Mr. Anderson
allegedly fondle you with?

1000
01:05:06,372 --> 01:05:07,649
Both hands.

1001
01:05:08,837 --> 01:05:10,113
Both hands?

1002
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:17,565
No more questions.

1003
01:05:21,828 --> 01:05:24,316
I'm nervous about testifying tomorrow.

1004
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:27,937
I'm not very good under pressure.

1005
01:05:28,581 --> 01:05:31,581
Well, all you got to do
is tell the truth, right?

1006
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:33,441
Right.

1007
01:05:33,541 --> 01:05:35,297
So what's there to be nervous about?

1008
01:05:35,397 --> 01:05:39,008
Kimberly and Randa,
they already did a good job on the stand.

1009
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:41,119
Especially Kimberly.

1010
01:05:42,596 --> 01:05:44,254
Man, she was amazing.

1011
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,975
Look, I'm not Kimberly, okay?

1012
01:05:48,356 --> 01:05:52,731
This whole thing is really scary for me,
with the Judge and all the lawyers.

1013
01:05:52,933 --> 01:05:54,624
I'm starting to think it was a bad idea.

1014
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:56,579
What? No, hey.

1015
01:05:57,413 --> 01:05:58,340
Hey, hey.

1016
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:05,469
What Mr. A did to you, to all of you,
was wrong.

1017
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:10,206
Right?

1018
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:12,803
You're right.

1019
01:06:16,165 --> 01:06:17,409
Baby?

1020
01:06:21,157 --> 01:06:22,236
Yeah?

1021
01:06:22,981 --> 01:06:26,112
Did it make you sad
when Kimberly broke up with you?

1022
01:06:27,077 --> 01:06:29,313
You mean, when I broke up with her.

1023
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:33,439
No, when she broke up with you,
'cause you weren't ready to have sex.

1024
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:37,316
What? No way. Is that what she told you?

1025
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:40,065
What, that's not the way it went?

1026
01:06:40,165 --> 01:06:42,401
No, it's not even close.

1027
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:45,306
What do you mean? What happened?

1028
01:06:47,301 --> 01:06:49,690
Well, I heard something...

1029
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,675
that kind of freaked me out...

1030
01:06:53,637 --> 01:06:55,971
and to be honest with you,
it was kind of making me look bad.

1031
01:06:58,469 --> 01:07:01,120
<i>One night, I was over at Kimberly's house...</i>

1032
01:07:01,381 --> 01:07:05,887
<i>and she came out of the bathroom
and started doing this nasty little dance.</i>

1033
01:07:16,613 --> 01:07:19,101
Kimberly, stop it. Kimberly.

1034
01:07:20,741 --> 01:07:23,905
What's the matter, baby?
You don't like what you see?

1035
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,251
Warren Prescott told me what he did to you.

1036
01:07:32,869 --> 01:07:35,487
Are you going to believe everything
that Warren says?

1037
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:37,018
I believe this.

1038
01:07:40,709 --> 01:07:41,855
Okay.

1039
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:45,636
Assuming that it's true...

1040
01:07:46,661 --> 01:07:48,417
why is that a problem?

1041
01:07:49,701 --> 01:07:52,036
If you're good,
I'll let you go where Warren went.

1042
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,305
No, that is not cool, Kimberly.

1043
01:07:54,885 --> 01:07:57,984
I don't take some loser's sloppy seconds,
all right?

1044
01:07:59,685 --> 01:08:02,816
And I don't want to be
with some dirty little whore.

1045
01:08:06,853 --> 01:08:08,642
What did you say to me?

1046
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:12,292
You heard me.

1047
01:08:13,669 --> 01:08:14,913
Slut.

1048
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:25,477
<i>So that was it, I walked out.</i>

1049
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:28,861
Wow. She never told me that.

1050
01:08:30,661 --> 01:08:33,858
It doesn't matter.
Everything happens for a reason.

1051
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:38,212
I mean, even when I was with Kimberly,
I always had a thing for you.

1052
01:08:38,758 --> 01:08:41,125
You know how I used to look at you.

1053
01:08:41,542 --> 01:08:44,030
I can't help but think she knew that.

1054
01:08:46,054 --> 01:08:48,607
She's probably just really embarrassed.

1055
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,212
You're right.

1056
01:08:54,949 --> 01:08:58,495
And she really is being pretty brave
about this whole thing.

1057
01:09:00,005 --> 01:09:03,202
Actually, I think
you should just follow her example.

1058
01:09:03,942 --> 01:09:05,852
You're as brave as she is.

1059
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:16,003
Like Kimberly Joyce
and Randa Azzouni before you...

1060
01:09:16,742 --> 01:09:20,157
you have outlined a disturbing pattern...

1061
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:24,066
of repeated sexual assault and harassment...

1062
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,907
on the part of the defendant, your teacher,
Mr. Anderson.

1063
01:09:29,254 --> 01:09:33,662
Now I have to ask you,
why did you take so long to come forward?

1064
01:09:37,094 --> 01:09:38,523
We were scared.

1065
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:41,436
We were ashamed.

1066
01:09:42,022 --> 01:09:44,869
And what finally made you
break your silence?

1067
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:50,974
When he decided to do it
in front of everybody.

1068
01:09:51,078 --> 01:09:53,566
"Decided to do it in front of everybody. "

1069
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:57,598
Could you repeat for us the incident
that drove you over the edge?

1070
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,642
It was at Drama Club,
after school on a Friday.

1071
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,828
<i>Lee Strasberg, of the famed Actors Studio...</i>

1072
01:10:10,183 --> 01:10:13,216
used to stress the importance
of being able to perform...

1073
01:10:13,318 --> 01:10:15,260
private moments on stage.

1074
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:21,307
Now, acting is about opening yourself up.

1075
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:26,268
It is about freeing yourself from shame,
reticence, inhibition.

1076
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:29,570
It's about laying yourself bare.

1077
01:10:30,598 --> 01:10:33,696
So, Brittany, I want you to show me...

1078
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:36,096
your private moment.

1079
01:10:38,406 --> 01:10:40,545
- Private moment?
- Yes, private moment.

1080
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:42,948
Something that you would do
only in complete privacy.

1081
01:10:43,046 --> 01:10:45,828
Something that no one else
would ever see you do.

1082
01:10:47,078 --> 01:10:48,420
Now, I want you to take a moment.

1083
01:10:48,518 --> 01:10:52,796
Think about what that is.
Then, when you have it, show me.

1084
01:11:00,582 --> 01:11:02,273
I don't want to do that.

1085
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:05,539
Do you want to be Anne Frank?
Do you want to be our lead?

1086
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:07,267
Yes, but I...

1087
01:11:07,367 --> 01:11:09,756
All right then, do it. Stop whining and do it.

1088
01:11:11,238 --> 01:11:13,213
Well, what's he doing here?

1089
01:11:15,847 --> 01:11:17,537
Roger, what are you...

1090
01:11:19,495 --> 01:11:21,535
Nobody's here, Brittany. That's the point.

1091
01:11:21,638 --> 01:11:24,540
None of us are here.
You're alone, by yourself...

1092
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:30,205
Close your eyes. All right?

1093
01:11:31,111 --> 01:11:34,242
Lmagine yourself
in the privacy of your own room...

1094
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,411
the door is locked, it's closed.

1095
01:11:38,214 --> 01:11:40,603
Windows are shut.

1096
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:43,904
Curtains are drawn.

1097
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:47,677
You're all alone.

1098
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:51,814
It's just you.

1099
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:55,613
You're all alone.

1100
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,189
It's just you.

1101
01:12:19,815 --> 01:12:21,222
It's just you.

1102
01:12:42,631 --> 01:12:44,125
I can't do this.

1103
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:46,015
- No way!
- Brittany! Brittany!

1104
01:12:46,183 --> 01:12:49,728
That was very good.
You know, Anne Frank had nowhere to run.

1105
01:12:50,343 --> 01:12:53,791
So you can stay here
and act like a professional...

1106
01:12:53,895 --> 01:12:56,513
or are you going to run and cry,
like a little girl?

1107
01:12:56,935 --> 01:12:59,488
I am a little girl, you fucking pervert!

1108
01:13:04,775 --> 01:13:05,920
Pervert.

1109
01:13:26,183 --> 01:13:27,939
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

1110
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:30,592
Very well. Court is adjourned till Monday.

1111
01:13:36,072 --> 01:13:38,341
- Hello?
- Kimberly, hi, it's Barry.

1112
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:40,864
<i>- Hi, Barry.
- I haven't seen you lately.</i>

1113
01:13:41,927 --> 01:13:45,059
I've actually been thinking.
How can I put this tactfully?

1114
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:49,188
Barry, I never really liked you
all that much...

1115
01:13:49,287 --> 01:13:51,491
<i>and I think we should break up.</i>

1116
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,040
<i>Barry?</i>

1117
01:13:56,423 --> 01:13:58,311
It always goes down easy.

1118
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,807
<i>What?</i>

1119
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:02,278
That was one of the reasons
why beer is better than a woman.

1120
01:14:04,071 --> 01:14:06,111
<i>If it's flat, you can throw it out.</i>

1121
01:14:06,215 --> 01:14:07,622
Okay, Barry...

1122
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:10,719
You don't have to wash it
before it tastes good.

1123
01:14:11,111 --> 01:14:12,638
<i>I've really got to go, okay?</i>

1124
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:14,402
<i>- It's always wet...
- Barry!</i>

1125
01:14:14,695 --> 01:14:17,859
Are you even listening to me?
Did you hear what I said?

1126
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:19,520
<i>Is it another guy?</i>

1127
01:14:26,727 --> 01:14:27,742
Yeah!

1128
01:14:41,127 --> 01:14:42,437
Oh, my God.

1129
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:44,231
Oh, my God.

1130
01:14:45,575 --> 01:14:46,503
Oh, my God.

1131
01:14:49,863 --> 01:14:52,165
I bet you've never seen one of those, before.

1132
01:14:53,191 --> 01:14:55,460
You silly girl, I have one.

1133
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:57,475
Oh, right.

1134
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:01,021
I like it, it's cute.

1135
01:15:02,024 --> 01:15:05,319
- Is it?
- Yes, and you're cute.

1136
01:15:06,664 --> 01:15:08,355
- I am?
- Yes.

1137
01:15:10,536 --> 01:15:13,470
- You're amazing.
- I know.

1138
01:15:20,327 --> 01:15:22,466
Dad? Busy?

1139
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,865
- I'm always busy, Josh.
- Right.

1140
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:28,350
I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

1141
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,604
Put that down, that's a memento.

1142
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:37,474
- What is it, Josh, what is it?
- Sorry.

1143
01:15:38,024 --> 01:15:39,551
Look, it's just...

1144
01:15:40,648 --> 01:15:42,982
I was wondering if you
could help out Mr. Anderson.

1145
01:15:43,688 --> 01:15:47,616
It's really tearing me up inside
watching him go through this trial.

1146
01:15:47,816 --> 01:15:49,125
I mean, he's such a good teacher.

1147
01:15:49,224 --> 01:15:51,613
I can't even remember
how many long sessions...

1148
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,720
that he spent with me after school,
helping me...

1149
01:15:54,952 --> 01:15:56,294
with my math homework.

1150
01:15:56,391 --> 01:15:59,740
I thought Mr. Anderson
was an English and Drama teacher.

1151
01:16:00,168 --> 01:16:01,477
Yeah, but he's really good at math, too.

1152
01:16:01,576 --> 01:16:04,031
Mr. Anderson couldn't afford five minutes
of my time.

1153
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,652
<i>I know that, Dad.
But I was hoping you could do it pro boner.</i>

1154
01:16:07,752 --> 01:16:11,014
<i>Pro bono, Josh, Latin.
And I don't do pro bono.</i>

1155
01:16:11,976 --> 01:16:14,016
But he's innocent, Dad,
these girls are totally lying.

1156
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,779
I got a lot more important cases
on my desk...

1157
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,084
than some high-school tempest in a teapot.

1158
01:16:18,184 --> 01:16:20,071
I know that, Dad, but...

1159
01:16:20,968 --> 01:16:22,877
Look, you know how
you're always apologizing to me...

1160
01:16:22,984 --> 01:16:25,439
about how your work leaves you
so little time to spend with me...

1161
01:16:25,545 --> 01:16:28,130
and watch me growing up,
and so, instead, you're always...

1162
01:16:28,232 --> 01:16:31,461
buying me these rare, expensive
kinds of dogs that only eat tuna fish?

1163
01:16:33,352 --> 01:16:36,134
Well, I think that if you did this favor
for me, Dad...

1164
01:16:36,232 --> 01:16:39,080
it'd go a long way towards
making up for that.

1165
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:43,941
Well, I'll consider it.

1166
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:47,264
Hey.

1167
01:16:49,736 --> 01:16:53,828
With the surprise addition of Larry Horowitz
to Percy Anderson's defense team...

1168
01:16:53,928 --> 01:16:56,928
the Roxbury sex trial
has leapt off the local pages...

1169
01:16:57,032 --> 01:16:59,520
and attained dramatic new proportions.

1170
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,615
Today, the eyes of a nation,
indeed, of other nations...

1171
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,084
will turn to this courthouse
in Beverly Hills...

1172
01:17:06,184 --> 01:17:09,250
where Larry Horowitz,
will make his first court appearance.

1173
01:17:09,352 --> 01:17:13,760
If one emblematic figure, above all others,
has emerged during this trial...

1174
01:17:14,312 --> 01:17:17,989
it would have to be beautiful,
young plaintiff, Kimberly Joyce.

1175
01:17:18,984 --> 01:17:22,051
As a woman,
it's difficult not to feel inspired...

1176
01:17:22,152 --> 01:17:24,323
by her marching into court each day...

1177
01:17:24,424 --> 01:17:26,628
her chin held high, her chest...

1178
01:17:27,529 --> 01:17:29,634
her chest thrust forward.

1179
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,807
A steely determination in her eyes...

1180
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:36,829
like a latter day Joan of Arc,
going off to fight in the Crusade.

1181
01:17:36,969 --> 01:17:38,823
Give me a fucking break.

1182
01:17:43,176 --> 01:17:47,105
Other beneficiaries of the intensified
media attention include me.

1183
01:17:48,712 --> 01:17:51,811
You're all so sweet.
Thank you all for your letters.

1184
01:17:51,912 --> 01:17:54,563
And now,
to answer some of your questions.

1185
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:57,310
Francine Whitmore of Anaheim asks:

1186
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,620
Is this my natural hair color?

1187
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:03,714
Well, Francine,
a lady doesn't reveal her beauty secrets.

1188
01:18:04,617 --> 01:18:09,090
And no, James Foster of Newport Beach,
I'm technically not single.

1189
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,690
But don't give up hope...

1190
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:13,061
because you never know
what might happen in the future.

1191
01:18:17,097 --> 01:18:18,112
Shit.

1192
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,790
Cut! Did you get that? Nadine!

1193
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,247
Mr. Horowitz,
you may begin cross-examination.

1194
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,205
So I've been thinking.

1195
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:48,486
I've been thinking that maybe
it's about time we put a stop to him.

1196
01:18:52,713 --> 01:18:55,648
Let's begin by talking
about career aspirations.

1197
01:18:55,753 --> 01:18:58,339
Randa, as you know,
Brittany and I want to be actresses.

1198
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,059
So where do you see yourself in 10 years?

1199
01:19:01,161 --> 01:19:05,384
I would like to be a doctor, because I think
it is a good thing to help society.

1200
01:19:05,769 --> 01:19:08,354
I would especially like to help the poor.

1201
01:19:09,769 --> 01:19:12,136
Okay. Randa, that's really sweet...

1202
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:15,557
but in America, doctors don't help the poor.

1203
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:20,606
And I hope you're not implying
that actresses don't help society...

1204
01:19:20,713 --> 01:19:22,404
because they often attend charity events...

1205
01:19:22,505 --> 01:19:25,767
and, you know, appear in films
that have important social messages.

1206
01:19:26,793 --> 01:19:29,542
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
- It's okay.

1207
01:19:30,025 --> 01:19:34,083
I just hope that me and Brittany
can persuade you to change your mind.

1208
01:19:34,217 --> 01:19:37,086
Being a doctor
requires an awful lot of schooling...

1209
01:19:37,193 --> 01:19:39,429
whereas the wonderful thing
about being an actress is...

1210
01:19:39,529 --> 01:19:40,958
you don't have to study at all.

1211
01:19:41,386 --> 01:19:43,971
All it takes is talent, determination...

1212
01:19:44,873 --> 01:19:47,742
and sleeping with some people
who you otherwise wouldn't.

1213
01:19:48,073 --> 01:19:49,862
- And the edge.
- Yes.

1214
01:19:51,338 --> 01:19:53,988
Brittany and I often talk about the edge.

1215
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:58,206
See, unfortunately, we're not
the only aspiring actresses in this town.

1216
01:19:58,313 --> 01:20:02,982
It's filled to the brim with competition,
most of whom are equally talented...

1217
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:06,655
and equally as beautiful,
and equally as promiscuous.

1218
01:20:07,721 --> 01:20:10,307
So you need something
to separate yourself from the pack.

1219
01:20:11,177 --> 01:20:12,738
You need the edge.

1220
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,351
This leads us to Mr. Anderson.

1221
01:20:16,457 --> 01:20:17,864
- It does?
- Yes.

1222
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:22,463
Randa, what's the greatest thing
about this country?

1223
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:24,194
Sylvester Stallone?

1224
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:28,166
No. The greatest thing
about this country is freedom.

1225
01:20:29,578 --> 01:20:33,091
And one of those freedoms
is that anybody can sue anybody...

1226
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,168
at any time, over anything.

1227
01:20:36,202 --> 01:20:39,650
And even if your case
is completely unfounded and you lose...

1228
01:20:39,753 --> 01:20:42,852
you can still tarnish
someone's reputation forever.

1229
01:20:42,953 --> 01:20:45,059
You want to sue Mr. Anderson?

1230
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:48,100
The timing's perfect.

1231
01:20:48,201 --> 01:20:51,398
That lesbian reporter's roaming
the hallowed halls of Roxbury.

1232
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:53,504
What if something explosive happened...

1233
01:20:53,609 --> 01:20:56,457
during what was supposed
to be an innocuous little puff piece?

1234
01:20:57,545 --> 01:21:00,993
Something like sexual assault charges?

1235
01:21:02,953 --> 01:21:04,546
Do you suppose that the main players...

1236
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:07,999
might be subject to an enormous amount
of media exposure?

1237
01:21:08,746 --> 01:21:12,358
Do you suppose that it might jump start
their acting careers?

1238
01:21:15,177 --> 01:21:17,544
Okay, what's the worst-case scenario?

1239
01:21:17,641 --> 01:21:20,227
We lose the case, we still get famous...

1240
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:23,718
and Mr. Anderson has to live
with the stigma for the rest of his life.

1241
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:26,212
The rest of his life?

1242
01:21:27,401 --> 01:21:29,605
Brittany, don't pussy out on me.

1243
01:21:30,058 --> 01:21:31,945
Look, he's failing Randa.

1244
01:21:32,041 --> 01:21:32,969
He canned me from the play.

1245
01:21:35,242 --> 01:21:37,511
We all know what he did to you.

1246
01:21:38,474 --> 01:21:40,677
You said you wanted to burn him.

1247
01:21:40,874 --> 01:21:43,744
And the way I see it,
he's already doused himself in gasoline.

1248
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,847
All we have to do is strike a match.

1249
01:21:47,722 --> 01:21:49,696
Will Mr. Anderson be fired?

1250
01:21:50,858 --> 01:21:52,646
In all likelihood, yes.

1251
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:57,311
- Then I am in.
- Bonus.

1252
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:03,493
Would we have to, like, testify?

1253
01:22:03,977 --> 01:22:06,825
Probably not. These things never go to trial.

1254
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:10,694
'Cause you know I'm no good
under pressure.

1255
01:22:15,082 --> 01:22:17,930
Mr. Horowitz,
you may begin cross-examination.

1256
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,072
Miss Wells...

1257
01:22:31,178 --> 01:22:34,309
Okay! It's all a lie, every word is a lie!
But it was Kimberly's idea!

1258
01:22:34,442 --> 01:22:37,311
We were just mad at Mr. Anderson.
We wanted to get back at him!

1259
01:22:41,066 --> 01:22:42,080
Oops.

1260
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:47,779
Rewind?

1261
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,494
Cocktails.

1262
01:23:21,258 --> 01:23:25,350
You lying, backstabbing,
two-faced little cunt!

1263
01:23:25,642 --> 01:23:26,886
Hi, Emily.

1264
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:28,992
Do you have any idea what you've done?

1265
01:23:29,355 --> 01:23:31,362
Do you have any idea how many victims...

1266
01:23:31,466 --> 01:23:33,289
how many real victims
of sexual harassment...

1267
01:23:33,386 --> 01:23:35,753
have just lost all credibility
in the public eye?

1268
01:23:36,331 --> 01:23:38,884
How many are going to be afraid
to come forward now?

1269
01:23:38,986 --> 01:23:40,896
How many are going to continue
to suffer in silence...

1270
01:23:41,002 --> 01:23:43,523
all because of this asinine little stunt
you've pulled?

1271
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:45,987
I don't know, Emily. How many?

1272
01:23:47,018 --> 01:23:48,774
I'm going to bury you.

1273
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:50,945
I beg to differ.

1274
01:23:52,170 --> 01:23:54,112
While all the other little pundits
with microphones...

1275
01:23:54,219 --> 01:23:56,553
are going to be clamoring
for my head on a stick...

1276
01:23:58,155 --> 01:24:00,904
the most popular
and influential reporter in town...

1277
01:24:01,035 --> 01:24:03,490
is going to be marching
to quite the different drum.

1278
01:24:04,842 --> 01:24:07,177
You are going to be my lone champion...

1279
01:24:07,274 --> 01:24:10,820
my staunch defender,
my dyke in shining armor.

1280
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:13,447
And why would I want to do that?

1281
01:24:13,547 --> 01:24:15,750
Because if you don't,
I'll go right to your news director...

1282
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:18,119
and tell him exactly
where his favorite little bloodhound...

1283
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:20,074
had been digging for milk bones.

1284
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:22,505
As far as lapses in journalistic integrity go...

1285
01:24:22,922 --> 01:24:26,948
I'd say that munching underage rug
is way the hell up there.

1286
01:24:27,051 --> 01:24:28,229
Wouldn't you?

1287
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:33,247
Like he's going to believe you.
Everyone knows you're a liar now.

1288
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:34,985
I have proof.

1289
01:24:38,827 --> 01:24:41,315
What did you do? Did you videotape us?

1290
01:24:54,731 --> 01:24:57,152
Do you know I thought
that you were like I was in high school?

1291
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,871
A loner, smarter than everyone else,
just misunderstood. But you're not.

1292
01:25:01,674 --> 01:25:03,562
My God,
you're just another one of the mean ones...

1293
01:25:03,659 --> 01:25:06,026
who called me names,
who made my life miserable.

1294
01:25:06,122 --> 01:25:08,610
My God, you're just another one of those.

1295
01:25:08,715 --> 01:25:10,787
Okay, Emily, listen carefully.

1296
01:25:13,035 --> 01:25:15,402
That is the sound of me not caring.

1297
01:25:15,595 --> 01:25:16,904
I gotta go.

1298
01:25:17,547 --> 01:25:20,132
- You used me.
- Ditto, sister.

1299
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:24,065
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror lately? My God.

1300
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:38,020
You have brought shame upon this family.

1301
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:41,574
So much shame, I cannot express.

1302
01:25:43,659 --> 01:25:45,415
In part, I blame this country.

1303
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:49,225
Its influence. Its moral decay.

1304
01:25:51,499 --> 01:25:53,986
Perhaps it was a mistake to come here.

1305
01:25:55,563 --> 01:25:58,465
But you should have enough strength
to resist.

1306
01:25:58,668 --> 01:26:00,577
That's how we raised you.

1307
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,106
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1308
01:26:05,003 --> 01:26:07,654
You should have
more than enough strength!

1309
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:11,913
Today is as if I have no daughter!

1310
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:14,243
Get up!

1311
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:25,284
<i>The disgraced students
arrived at school today...</i>

1312
01:26:25,388 --> 01:26:27,559
<i>after the end of classes
to collect their belongings.</i>

1313
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:29,896
<i>The three girls
have been suspended indefinitely...</i>

1314
01:26:29,995 --> 01:26:32,416
<i>while the school decides
on disciplinary action.</i>

1315
01:26:32,523 --> 01:26:34,017
<i>The DA's office revealed yesterday...</i>

1316
01:26:34,123 --> 01:26:37,157
<i>that all charges against Percy Anderson
have been dropped.</i>

1317
01:26:37,995 --> 01:26:39,883
I can't believe you lied.

1318
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,340
- Troy...
- Don't touch me!

1319
01:26:44,267 --> 01:26:47,137
I cannot believe
you were up there in court...

1320
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:50,505
saying all those disgusting things
about Mr. Anderson.

1321
01:26:50,763 --> 01:26:53,480
I can't believe you made all that up.
What kind of person are you?

1322
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,652
But the thing in Drama, that was true.
You were there.

1323
01:26:55,756 --> 01:26:59,072
My God, Brittany, he was trying to help you.

1324
01:27:00,683 --> 01:27:03,236
You just throw it back in his face.

1325
01:27:03,532 --> 01:27:05,441
Troy, please don't be mad.

1326
01:27:05,868 --> 01:27:10,341
Mad? I don't want to look at you anymore.

1327
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:13,728
You disgust me.

1328
01:27:14,892 --> 01:27:17,891
You know,
I thought you were different, Brittany.

1329
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,769
But you're not.

1330
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:24,843
We're through.

1331
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:54,467
Does it feel bad?

1332
01:27:57,452 --> 01:28:00,300
Like a hundred little cuts
all over your body?

1333
01:28:03,788 --> 01:28:05,762
You wanna just crawl in the dirt
and stay there...

1334
01:28:05,868 --> 01:28:07,461
where no one can see, don't you?

1335
01:28:11,372 --> 01:28:15,649
Look on the bright side, Brittany.
As an actress...

1336
01:28:17,419 --> 01:28:19,689
whenever you need to feel pain...

1337
01:28:20,972 --> 01:28:23,241
you can look back on this moment.

1338
01:28:25,996 --> 01:28:28,363
You can bottle it up and keep it forever.

1339
01:28:42,828 --> 01:28:44,006
Hurry up.

1340
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:47,171
Whoa, you have any metal on you?
Jewelry, earrings, anything like that?

1341
01:28:47,276 --> 01:28:50,309
See, there you go.
Every day we go through this.

1342
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:54,115
All right, you sure you got everything now?

1343
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:56,773
Everything. All right, go ahead.
Try it one more time.

1344
01:29:00,332 --> 01:29:01,826
Okay. All right.

1345
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:05,442
I'm going to have to ask you
to remove your...

1346
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:07,970
- Is there a problem here?
- This is part of our religion.

1347
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:10,018
Yeah, I understand it's religious,
but the machine...

1348
01:29:10,124 --> 01:29:12,677
Sir, I don't care about your machine.
She is here to get her books.

1349
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,885
Okay, fine, go. You two, stay. Go.

1350
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:20,521
- Just trying to doing my job, sir.
- I understand.

1351
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:21,733
- All right.
- I know that.

1352
01:31:12,109 --> 01:31:14,018
Will you shut the fuck up?

1353
01:31:14,668 --> 01:31:16,840
Enough already! Come on!

1354
01:31:18,252 --> 01:31:19,397
Fuck me!

1355
01:31:22,157 --> 01:31:23,717
Will you stop it!

1356
01:31:26,861 --> 01:31:29,763
Bobo, come here.
Where's the fucking dog? Hey!

1357
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,172
Shit! Bobo!

1358
01:31:33,453 --> 01:31:34,435
Hey!

1359
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:39,811
Hello? I'm trying to think in here.

1360
01:31:41,549 --> 01:31:43,174
I'm trying to do a little work in here!

1361
01:31:43,277 --> 01:31:46,124
Hello? Does anybody think about me?

1362
01:31:47,437 --> 01:31:50,732
Enough already
with the Ludwig-van-fucking-Mozart crap!

1363
01:31:51,181 --> 01:31:52,905
Can't you hear me thinking there?

1364
01:31:53,005 --> 01:31:56,202
I got a job to do! I've got work to do!
Stop it.

1365
01:31:56,621 --> 01:31:58,115
Stop!

1366
01:31:58,605 --> 01:32:00,972
Fuck me in the ass. I'm trying to work!

1367
01:32:01,069 --> 01:32:03,436
Do you not pay attention
to anything but yourself?

1368
01:32:04,013 --> 01:32:06,086
She shouldn't have done that.

1369
01:32:06,253 --> 01:32:07,235
Who?

1370
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:10,051
The diaper head.

1371
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:13,356
Maybe somebody should have given
just a little bit more thought...

1372
01:32:13,453 --> 01:32:15,624
to the consequences of their action.

1373
01:32:15,725 --> 01:32:18,540
Have you any idea,
this little charade you cooked up...

1374
01:32:18,637 --> 01:32:20,393
how it's made me look, huh?

1375
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:25,420
- I'm sorry about your business, Daddy.
- Thank you. I feel so much better.

1376
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:28,554
But I bet you have a lot more
free time now, right?

1377
01:32:28,813 --> 01:32:30,090
Free time?

1378
01:32:30,573 --> 01:32:33,988
She thinks I'm gonna spend the free time
with her. Can you fucking imagine?

1379
01:32:34,093 --> 01:32:38,370
Why would I want to spend any more time
than I have to with a manipulative...

1380
01:32:38,478 --> 01:32:41,674
little twat, like you! You crazy?

1381
01:32:42,381 --> 01:32:44,683
You got a fuzzy little brain in your head,
explain it to her.

1382
01:32:44,781 --> 01:32:46,210
Why would I want to do that?

1383
01:32:53,549 --> 01:32:55,621
You know, there was a time...

1384
01:32:56,909 --> 01:32:59,692
when I actually thought I could protect you.

1385
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:03,430
It just seems so long ago.

1386
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:09,027
Well, fuck me, cocksuckers,
I'm through with that now.

1387
01:33:09,133 --> 01:33:10,246
Okay? It's over.

1388
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:13,132
You can do whatever you want. I don't care!

1389
01:33:13,453 --> 01:33:15,820
You want to join a rock band, fine.
Go ahead.

1390
01:33:15,918 --> 01:33:18,471
Become a hooker, get pregnant,
do drugs, here.

1391
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:20,515
Here's a little something to get you started.

1392
01:33:20,622 --> 01:33:24,550
Come on, you are such a good little man,
I'm going to treat your fuzzy little nose.

1393
01:33:24,654 --> 01:33:28,199
And you are just like your fucking mother,
a cunt.

1394
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:29,670
Come on.

1395
01:33:30,797 --> 01:33:33,219
I don't even like this kind, you asshole!

1396
01:33:33,325 --> 01:33:35,398
Then shove them up your ass!

1397
01:33:36,334 --> 01:33:38,341
Bobo, come on with Daddy.

1398
01:33:42,478 --> 01:33:43,907
Come on, Bobo.

1399
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:04,331
<i>I just think it's horrible
what they put that poor man through.</i>

1400
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:06,885
<i>You have to wonder what kind of homes
these girls are coming from.</i>

1401
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:09,957
<i>I mean, what kind of parents could raise
such horrible little monsters?</i>

1402
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:13,062
<i>Who knows where she got the gun?
I mean, accessibility to firearms...</i>

1403
01:34:13,166 --> 01:34:16,297
<i>is one of the main problems
facing the youth of society today.</i>

1404
01:34:16,654 --> 01:34:18,083
<i>Hold on, I got a call.</i>

1405
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:20,677
<i>So you'll forgive me, loyal viewers,
if I don't clap my hands...</i>

1406
01:34:20,782 --> 01:34:23,531
<i>and join in on another round
of "blame the victim. "</i>

1407
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:26,500
<i>To my eyes,
Kimberly Joyce will always be innocent...</i>

1408
01:34:26,606 --> 01:34:30,119
<i>and more than that, she will be
an American heroine. The blood...</i>

1409
01:34:30,222 --> 01:34:32,164
Kimberly Joyce tried out for Marie-France,
didn't she?

1410
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,507
- Yeah.
- And why didn't we pick her again?

1411
01:34:34,606 --> 01:34:36,711
Didn't stand out.

1412
01:34:36,878 --> 01:34:39,747
- Is it too late to re-cast that role?
- It's never too late.

1413
01:34:39,853 --> 01:34:42,701
Lisa, I need you to find Kimberly Joyce.

1414
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:08,877
Girlfriend.

1415
01:35:09,678 --> 01:35:12,133
Hey. Kathy let me in.

1416
01:35:15,406 --> 01:35:18,603
I'm sorry I haven't called in ages.
I've just been really busy.

1417
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:23,269
Did I tell you I'm moving to my mom's?

1418
01:35:25,518 --> 01:35:27,690
I was talking to Josh Horowitz.

1419
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:30,725
Yeah?

1420
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:35,077
He told me something.

1421
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:39,467
I've been trying to wrap my head around
what it means, but I can't.

1422
01:35:41,743 --> 01:35:43,717
What did he tell you, Brit?

1423
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:49,541
He said you asked him to ask his father
to represent Mr. Anderson.

1424
01:35:52,751 --> 01:35:54,441
And if that's true...

1425
01:35:54,542 --> 01:35:58,022
the only thing it could possibly mean
is that you wanted me to confess.

1426
01:36:00,494 --> 01:36:02,599
So I was trying to think, why?

1427
01:36:05,006 --> 01:36:07,111
But I couldn't find an answer.

1428
01:36:09,775 --> 01:36:12,622
Well, maybe you should think a little harder.

1429
01:36:17,038 --> 01:36:19,591
Was all this really just to get famous?

1430
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:23,144
To get your face on TV?
To be on that stupid show?

1431
01:36:24,335 --> 01:36:25,447
Partly.

1432
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:27,626
Because you're the only one
who got famous.

1433
01:36:27,726 --> 01:36:30,573
Kimberly, everyone's already
forgotten about me.

1434
01:36:30,926 --> 01:36:32,585
Don't sweat it, hon.

1435
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:35,143
Fame is overrated.

1436
01:36:36,014 --> 01:36:37,989
It's so fleeting, you know?

1437
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,922
Heartbreak, on the other hand...

1438
01:36:45,518 --> 01:36:47,406
Heartbreak lasts forever.

1439
01:36:53,998 --> 01:36:55,275
Oh, my God.

1440
01:36:57,742 --> 01:36:58,757
Troy?

1441
01:37:01,519 --> 01:37:03,941
You're not his perfect little angel anymore,
are you?

1442
01:37:04,783 --> 01:37:05,895
Oh, no.

1443
01:37:08,015 --> 01:37:10,535
Now, you're a dirty little whore...

1444
01:37:12,687 --> 01:37:14,061
just like me.

1445
01:37:15,759 --> 01:37:17,450
I've turned you into me.

1446
01:37:22,063 --> 01:37:23,917
You mean, all of this...

1447
01:37:25,934 --> 01:37:28,138
Everything was about a boy?

1448
01:37:29,422 --> 01:37:31,397
Not very original, granted.

1449
01:37:32,654 --> 01:37:36,037
But you know that green-eyed monster
can be a real bitch.

1450
01:37:42,415 --> 01:37:45,098
You never wanted to be Anne Frank,
did you?

1451
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,635
Oh, yes, I did.

1452
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:50,859
And then I wanted to get fired,
establish a motive...

1453
01:37:51,823 --> 01:37:55,271
make everybody think
I had something against Mr. Anderson.

1454
01:37:55,567 --> 01:37:57,607
Then a little accidental racial slur...

1455
01:37:57,711 --> 01:38:00,100
and everything fell into place.

1456
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:03,849
I mean, my God, Brittany...

1457
01:38:04,655 --> 01:38:07,971
it's like the whole world is this orchestra,
and I'm the conductor.

1458
01:38:12,175 --> 01:38:15,142
- I thought you were my friend.
- I was.

1459
01:38:18,415 --> 01:38:20,619
But you stole my boyfriend, Brittany.

1460
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:26,278
But, Kimberly, Randa...

1461
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:29,349
Randa died because of this!

1462
01:38:33,743 --> 01:38:35,815
Every war has its casualties.

1463
01:38:38,191 --> 01:38:39,849
Just ask my brother.

1464
01:38:40,271 --> 01:38:41,547
Oh, my God.

1465
01:38:43,663 --> 01:38:45,354
You're a fucking psycho.

1466
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:53,384
Some things I borrowed from you.

1467
01:38:53,488 --> 01:38:56,335
I never want to speak to you
or see you again.

1468
01:38:56,783 --> 01:38:58,212
You psycho!

1469
01:39:15,887 --> 01:39:18,473
<i>Cody, you are almost as funny
as Jerry Lewis.</i>

1470
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,945
<i>Really?</i>

1471
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:22,857
<i>That's sweet, man.</i>

1472
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:26,596
<i>I feel like I'm going to cry more
than my mom at the end of Beaches.</i>

1473
01:39:26,703 --> 01:39:29,420
<i>Yeah, laugh it up. Go time.</i>

1474
01:39:39,247 --> 01:39:41,549
<i>Just like shooting the ducks in a carnival,
you know?</i>

1475
01:39:43,056 --> 01:39:45,195
<i>They go by in a line, one at a time...</i>

1476
01:39:45,872 --> 01:39:47,781
<i>and you've got your little rifle.</i>

1477
01:39:50,576 --> 01:39:51,983
<i>Bam! Bam! Bam!</i>

1478
01:40:05,328 --> 01:40:07,237
Surely, you must have something to say?

1479
01:40:08,368 --> 01:40:12,361
<i>My family came here for American dream.
We only found nightmare.</i>

1480
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:15,661
<i>- What do you have to say?
- You killed Kenny. You bastard!</i>

1481
01:40:15,888 --> 01:40:18,222
<i>Well, I guess you can light
a fart on fire, huh?</i>

1482
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,694
<i>But I have nothing for you.</i>

1483
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:22,826
<i>It's cool, don't worry about it.</i>

1484
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,586
Wait a moment, maybe I do.
