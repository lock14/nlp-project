1
00:01:29,686 --> 00:01:31,479
Who are you?

2
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:35,650
Hello, I'm Nancy Drew.
It's nice to meet you.

3
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:36,985
May I ask who you are?

4
00:01:38,862 --> 00:01:40,447
- Guess.
- All right.

5
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,158
I'm guessing you two are working
with Lawrence McNabb...

6
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:45,452
...the locksmith,
he gives you the keys...

7
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,038
...and you're responsible
for the recent burglaries.

8
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:51,166
However, you should know
the DA is only interested in McNabb...

9
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,959
You two could make a deal with him.

10
00:01:53,168 --> 00:01:56,922
...and that Charlie the security guard
is about to walk through that door.

11
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:02,010
Hi.

12
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:13,605
Listen to me. I'll get Pastor Murray
to drop the charges...

13
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:15,899
...if you agree to
some kind of counseling.

14
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,567
Anger issues don't just go away.

15
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:20,695
- I don't need a shrink.
- Yeah, you do.

16
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:22,572
He gets cranky when he hasn't eaten.

17
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:24,324
I told him, "Go have a snack."

18
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:27,786
I said, "Before we get here,
you better have a snack."

19
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:30,163
Oh, one summer,
we're on Fire Island...

20
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:32,040
Hey... Not with that story again.

21
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:35,585
Hold on.

22
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:37,045
What's that?

23
00:02:37,462 --> 00:02:39,130
My sleuth kit.

24
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:43,927
Flashlight, fountain pen, notebook,
magnifying glass, fingerprint powder...

25
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:45,929
...digital recorder...

26
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,768
...and one of Hannah's lemon bars.

27
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:01,444
Bess,
is Nancy okay?

28
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:03,113
Are you kidding?
She's loving it.

29
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,615
- Here he is.
- Nancy?

30
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:06,867
Hi, Ned.

31
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:08,869
I had this dream
during my nap today...

32
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:11,663
...you went to California,
met that guy on Smallville...

33
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,791
...and you got amnesia...

34
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:18,044
...and forgot you ever met me,
and then I turned into a squirrel.

35
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,755
Anyway, what do you think that means?

36
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:25,427
Um, Ned, can we talk about
this later? I'm just a little busy.

37
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:27,512
Y eah, sorry.
All right, okay.

38
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,181
Not appropriate, Ned.

39
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,057
You take naps?

40
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:33,351
What's going on?
Is she okay?

41
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:36,396
Hey, now don't worry.
I just talked with her. She's doing fine.

42
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:37,939
Nancy's my best man.

43
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,110
I mean, she would be
if she were on the force.

44
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,491
Fine. Therapy.

45
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,411
Great.
I'll call the DA back. Ha.

46
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,917
I just wanna thank you, Nancy Drew.

47
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:59,211
I've always heard
the nicest things about you...

48
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:02,255
...the way you solve mysteries
and you help people.

49
00:04:02,464 --> 00:04:04,841
Steve?
Please don't thank her for turning us in.

50
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:07,969
I think Crankenstein needs
another lemon bar.

51
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:11,723
I thought the Crankasaurus
was extinct.

52
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,391
I don't know about this.

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,853
Well, I'm sorry, Cranky Doodle Dandy.

54
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:19,231
I can't do this.

55
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,899
Gary, we made a deal.

56
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,901
Deals go wrong.

57
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,278
Hey. Where is she?
We need her.

58
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:27,364
You take that side.

59
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,426
Hey, Gary, look.

60
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,137
Hey!

61
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,266
Let's get out of here.

62
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,476
It's Nancy!

63
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:02,607
Hi, everybody.

64
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,655
Hold it there.
Hold it right there.

65
00:05:26,923 --> 00:05:30,135
Hold on, Nancy.
We got the fire department here.

66
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:32,762
That's all right, chief.
I'll be down in a jiffy.

67
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:35,140
Hang on, Nancy.

68
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,245
Are you okay?

69
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:58,914
I'm fine, Dad. Really.

70
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,042
In the sleuthing business,
this kind of thing happens all the time.

71
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,919
It really isn't a big deal.

72
00:06:04,127 --> 00:06:05,712
It is a big deal.

73
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:10,383
I ran from the courthouse in the middle
of that eviction case, which the judge...

74
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:14,054
...he didn't appreciate.

75
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:15,514
Where is your car?

76
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,099
Around the corner.

77
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,730
Is now a better time?

78
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,566
Because I wanted to give you this.

79
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:29,903
Well, your hunch was right
on the nose, Nancy.

80
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,240
Just wish you could have
clued us in a little earlier.

81
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,366
Safe as usual.

82
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:35,617
All right, Nancy, right here.

83
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:36,993
Hi, Nancy.

84
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,956
Thank you.
Bye.

85
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,124
Nancy, what are we going to do
without you?

86
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,210
It's only for a few months.
I'll be back.

87
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:48,672
The image of your mother.
Do you remember her at all?

88
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,923
No.

89
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:53,969
She was such a lovely woman,
so kind and intelligent.

90
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:55,762
Just like you, Nancy.

91
00:06:59,307 --> 00:07:00,976
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye-bye.

92
00:07:01,184 --> 00:07:03,061
So long, Nancy.

93
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:10,443
Shall we all pray
for her safe journey to California?

94
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,320
Sure.

95
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,448
Dear Lord,
please watch over Nancy Drew...

96
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:18,702
...and protect her as she strives
to solve mysteries...

97
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,373
...that are beyond the abilities
of local law enforcement agencies.

98
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:28,295
Dad, I'm...

99
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:30,881
I want you to promise,
no more sleuthing...

100
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:32,340
...at least while we're in California.

101
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:36,928
You'll go to school, shopping,
spend some time with teenagers.

102
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:40,265
It's what you're supposed to be doing.
Give it a try.

103
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:49,649
You know, I've always picked cases
that help people.

104
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:51,318
- Others first.
- That's right.

105
00:07:51,526 --> 00:07:53,737
But this one is a little different.

106
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:57,490
If everything goes well,
I could start making some real money.

107
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:58,825
We have enough money, Dad.

108
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:00,702
I'll be the judge of that, thank you.

109
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:04,873
At any rate, I'm starting something new.
I can't be worried about...

110
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,088
How you doing, John?

111
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:15,425
Yeah, I'll meet you at the deposition
as soon as my train gets in.

112
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:18,136
Well, we don't have
an airport out here.

113
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:19,596
I wish I was kidding.

114
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,141
This is a terrible development.

115
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,269
What are you gonna do?
You have a mystery to solve in la-la land.

116
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,772
I'll figure something out.

117
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,149
I hope.

118
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:38,365
Ned.

119
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:41,910
With all the commotion,
I didn't get to give you this.

120
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:49,084
I needed a new compass.
The old one's wobbly.

121
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:50,460
Thank you.

122
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,629
In case I'm not with you
on your birthday.

123
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,882
That's so sweet.

124
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:58,260
Ugh, I just don't know
if I'll get to use it.

125
00:08:58,802 --> 00:08:59,928
Why?

126
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:04,516
My dad let me choose the house we're
gonna live in, so I chose one with...

127
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,309
With a mystery.

128
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:10,272
But not just any mystery. One of the
greatest unsolved cases of all time.

129
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,398
Dehlia Draycott.

130
00:09:12,983 --> 00:09:14,860
The movie actress.

131
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:17,654
Before your time.
Twenty-five years ago...

132
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:24,119
...at the height of her fame,
she disappeared for five months.

133
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:26,413
Nobody knew where.

134
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:30,375
And when she came back,
she threw a giant party.

135
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:33,712
She never went downstairs
to greet her guests.

136
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:37,799
She was found floating in the pool.

137
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,050
Dead.

138
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:41,011
Gee, that sounds like fun.

139
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:42,679
I know, right?

140
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:44,764
But I didn't tell my dad
about the house...

141
00:09:44,973 --> 00:09:46,975
...and now he's not letting me
do any sleuthing.

142
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:50,187
There was a hostage situation.
I can kind of see his point, but...

143
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:53,106
Hi, Ned. Bye, Ned.
Gotta scoot, Nancy.

144
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:57,068
Mr. Drew.
Some pfeffernüsse, just in case...

145
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:59,779
...and some ginger cupcakes,
your favorite.

146
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:01,865
You're gonna get hungry,
I know it.

147
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,658
Nancy, hold on.
Thank you so much.

148
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:06,244
Bye, guys.
See you soon.

149
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:09,581
And have a safe train ride, okay?

150
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:10,832
I'll miss you.

151
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,043
Don't get hurt.
Please, you have to keep in contact.

152
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:17,214
Um, Ned? Don't worry
about that guy from Smallville.

153
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,090
- He's not my type.
- Nancy.

154
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,010
You have a type?

155
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:27,098
Chief McGinnis!
I just wanna let you know...

156
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,309
...that I'm not sleuthing anymore. Bye.

157
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:35,565
Nancy Drew not sleuthing anymore?
I don't think so. Ha, ha, ha.

158
00:11:53,852 --> 00:11:56,062
Hi, this is Carson Drew.
I'm running a little late.

159
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:59,691
Dad? Don't you think people who talk
on cell phones, um, miss things?

160
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:02,319
- Like what, hon?
- Like that woman in the street?

161
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:08,366
Uh, Mr. Drew? Nancy?

162
00:12:08,783 --> 00:12:09,826
Yes.

163
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,746
Hi. Thank you so much
for not running me over.

164
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,665
I'm Barbara Barbara,
of Barbara Barbara Realty.

165
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:17,751
You're here.

166
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,128
I'm gonna get right out of your way.

167
00:12:33,058 --> 00:12:34,518
How do you love it?

168
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:43,610
Uh, gorgeous.

169
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:46,821
Welcome.

170
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:57,999
It's not exactly what I had
in mind, especially given the price.

171
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,585
Well, as I told your daughter
on the phone...

172
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,379
...you do pay a premium for my...

173
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,090
Oh, I am such an oaf.

174
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:07,175
Um, as you were saying,
you pay a premium...

175
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:09,678
...for history,
architectural significance.

176
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:12,681
I mean, Dad, look at this woodwork.

177
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:14,766
Yeah, what she said.
Who's this?

178
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:18,937
Dehlia Draycott, the great film legend.
This was her home.

179
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:20,814
Didn't your daughter tell you?

180
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:24,484
We've both been somewhat busy.

181
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,029
Oh, excuse me. Gotta... Yeah.

182
00:13:28,238 --> 00:13:29,489
Hello?

183
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:34,286
Do you know what? With a little
tweaking, you could be adorable.

184
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,788
Um, thank you?

185
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, you're just a makeover
waiting to happen.

186
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,210
I'm gonna give you
the name of my stylist.

187
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,755
Oh, come on, let's go upstairs.
I can't wait to show you.

188
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:50,135
Did you hear something?

189
00:13:51,386 --> 00:13:53,346
I suddenly got a chill.

190
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,944
Have a look around, if you want.

191
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:14,951
Don't be afraid.

192
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,954
Please don't be afraid of me.

193
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,876
I'm here to help you.

194
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,713
You don't understand, I want to...
I want to help you.

195
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:36,014
I love that.
They fall for it every time.

196
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:40,685
That's a projector.
Oh, it's from one of her old movies.

197
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:43,104
There are so many booby traps
all over this house.

198
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:46,107
People get so scared sometimes,
they wet their pants.

199
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,653
Where's the gift shop?

200
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:51,947
That's the spirit.

201
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:55,492
Miss Barbara Barbara, I know I called
asking for a house with a mystery...

202
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,620
...but things have changed, and...

203
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:02,165
It's complicated,
but we're gonna need a different house.

204
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,293
Honey cheeks.
Read the fine print.

205
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,921
No refunds, no exchanges.

206
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,717
And besides, you know, there's nothing
else available, in your price range.

207
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:20,308
I'm gonna use the gents',
then run to that deposition.

208
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:22,602
Watch this.

209
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,278
Something just happened
in the bathroom...

210
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,864
...which I am at a loss to explain.

211
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,366
The house has a haunted theme.

212
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,703
It's like a theme park.
It's so fun, right, Dad?

213
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,371
No.

214
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:47,002
Oh, did I mention?
There's a strange caretaker.

215
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,004
He lives in an apartment down the hill.

216
00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:50,755
What's your name?

217
00:15:50,964 --> 00:15:54,426
Leshing. Let me know
if there's anything I can do for you.

218
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,386
Nancy Drew.
Thank you very much.

219
00:15:57,345 --> 00:16:01,308
Leshy?
We need to talk about the lawn.

220
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:18,408
Dad?

221
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,328
Mr. Leshing?

222
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:50,398
Someone stole my moccasins
and an important folder.

223
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,901
Mysteries just find you, don't they?

224
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,778
I'm letting the professionals
handle this one.

225
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:57,489
I'm on hold with the L.A.P.D.

226
00:16:57,697 --> 00:17:00,534
Calling the police to solve a crime.

227
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:02,077
I like it.

228
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:05,830
It's been 57 minutes.
They must be having a busy night.

229
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:15,423
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.
- I'm fine!

230
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:18,760
A favorite pair of moccasins
and a Pee Chee folder have been stolen.

231
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,846
Please send an officer over
immediately.

232
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:30,856
Someone must have told a joke
over at the precinct.

233
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:33,984
Yeah. That's it.

234
00:17:34,818 --> 00:17:36,069
Because it would be irresponsible...

235
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:38,572
...for a police department
to laugh at a crime.

236
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:41,908
You're right.

237
00:17:54,337 --> 00:17:55,797
Dad?

238
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,393
- Hello?
- Leshing, this is Nancy.

239
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:11,938
I needed to prove your whereabouts.
Go back to sleep.

240
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:30,081
Someone's in the house.

241
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,750
How did you get here so quickly?

242
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,044
If you're accusing me...

243
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:36,755
The attic.

244
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:01,154
How is it possible for someone
to be in the attic...

245
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:04,074
...and escape
while we're coming up the stairs?

246
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:05,534
Is there another staircase?

247
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,036
No.

248
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,247
Do you believe in ghosts, Mr. Leshing?

249
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:12,749
I am a ghost.

250
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,629
The Four Seasons isn't haunted.
What do you say?

251
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:20,131
Dad, you hate hotels.

252
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:24,302
Spa treatments.
Room service.

253
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:27,430
These books must have been Dehlia's.

254
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:29,307
May I borrow some?

255
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:33,395
If it were up to me, I wouldn't
let anybody in the house, period.

256
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:35,689
But you're paying the rent,
so do what you want.

257
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:37,148
I'm sorry, I didn't mean...

258
00:19:37,357 --> 00:19:38,900
Good night.

259
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,242
I like him.

260
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,581
So turns out there's a mystery
here after all.

261
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:57,460
Dad, that mystery stuff is so boring
to me now. I've completely moved on.

262
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:02,591
That was really just a phase, you know,
like papier-mâché or puppets.

263
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,510
It's over, done, finished, gone forever.

264
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,053
Got it.

265
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:20,108
Z, I'm sorry to have vanished like I did.

266
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:22,402
I know you have been looking for me.

267
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:24,905
Something important
happened last week.

268
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:29,701
I can't be the Dehlia I was anymore.
I'm writing a new will.

269
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,663
I need to make provisions
for someone else. D.

270
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:39,586
D is Dehlia, but who's Z?
Who's the "someone else"?

271
00:20:40,629 --> 00:20:41,671
No.

272
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:45,217
You' re not sleuthing.
No, sirree.

273
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:48,345
You' re just reading a letter
that happens to be a major clue...

274
00:20:48,553 --> 00:20:50,347
...in a fantastically famous mystery.

275
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:52,307
That means nothing to you.

276
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,726
You're gonna go to bed
and be reasonable, Nancy.

277
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:58,146
You're going to a new school.
You're gonna make wonderful friends.

278
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:01,691
You're a normal teenager.
You really are.

279
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,485
Yeah.

280
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:51,658
Yes.

281
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:52,993
The quadratic formula:

282
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:55,495
Negative-B plus or minus
the square root of B-squared...

283
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:58,623
...minus four A-C, all over two A.

284
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:21,688
I only had enough time
for 12 flying buttresses.

285
00:22:21,897 --> 00:22:23,773
But in actuality, there are 26.

286
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:30,530
Then I'll be brief.
O happy dagger!

287
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:31,698
Thank you. Please.

288
00:22:31,907 --> 00:22:35,118
This is thy sheath.
There rust, and let me die.

289
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:37,954
The show is Pippin.
And I just wanted your name.

290
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:12,656
Hey, baby. How you doing?

291
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:44,688
- Hi.
- Hello.

292
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:48,233
Hi, I noticed you were wearing
penny loafers.

293
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:51,653
Did your podiatrist suggest them
or are you being ironic?

294
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:53,238
I like old-fashioned things.

295
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,198
Oh, we've noticed.

296
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:58,326
Penny loafers are practical.

297
00:23:58,451 --> 00:24:03,331
Well, we may be on the brink
of a penny loafer fashion moment...

298
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:05,834
...or not.

299
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,466
That was awesome.

300
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:17,637
- Give that cupcake back.
- Shut up.

301
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:20,348
Come on.

302
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,519
That's a good cupcake.

303
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:26,897
Principal Fineman, I feel strongly...

304
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:30,650
...students should be given a more
nutritious alternative in the cafeteria.

305
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:31,902
Perhaps a salad bar.

306
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:35,030
A salad bar. Terrific idea.

307
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:37,949
Hi. I think the principal
wants to yell at me or something?

308
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:40,368
Let's see. Oh, yes.

309
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:43,914
There may be lead paint in
the shed next to the volleyball courts...

310
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:47,250
...but I can't be certain until
the lab report comes back.

311
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:49,836
Lead paint.
That's bad, right?

312
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:51,713
Very bad.

313
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,007
But there's no need to panic.

314
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,677
Finally, I urge you
to offer a course in CPR.

315
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:01,932
I noticed it wasn't
part of your curriculum.

316
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:04,559
I'm certified and I have found
great peace of mind...

317
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,645
...knowing I may
save a life someday.

318
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:14,861
So hot, so hot, so hot, hot!

319
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:34,381
Yeah, we know we're hot
Sorry that you're not

320
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:36,883
We go
Ching, ching, ching, ching

321
00:25:37,092 --> 00:25:41,555
Cha-ching, where's the money?
Cha-ching, where's the money?

322
00:25:51,356 --> 00:25:52,399
Oh, my God!
Corky!

323
00:25:52,607 --> 00:25:55,026
Oh, my God. No, no, no.
No, my brother's choking!

324
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:00,031
My brother's choking!
Does anyone know CPR?

325
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,575
Does anyone know CPR?

326
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,286
I do. I know CPR.

327
00:26:04,494 --> 00:26:06,496
Excuse me.

328
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:15,046
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

329
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:24,097
Oh, my God.

330
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:39,237
Oh, you idiot!

331
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:44,534
You were supposed to kiss her.
Lip-lock. That was the plan.

332
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,757
I'm looking forward to the journey.

333
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:06,259
And I don't care
if a woman unaccompanied...

334
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:09,054
...is considered to be shameful.

335
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:14,684
I've done nothing wrong.
My heart is...

336
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:17,812
Yes? Your heart is?

337
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,481
Cut.

338
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:22,609
I'm sorry.

339
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,402
Well, I don't know how much more time.

340
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:28,448
And action.

341
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,995
I'm looking forward to the journey...

342
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:36,581
...and I don't care that...

343
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,918
- I feel sick. I need to stop.
- Cut.

344
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:47,759
What are you doing?

345
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:50,136
I'm sorry.

346
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:53,056
The door was unlocked.

347
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:56,601
The shutters had rusted closed,
and the bulbs were all burnt-out.

348
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:58,478
Oh, leave it on.

349
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,988
I haven't been here
since the night she...

350
00:30:09,656 --> 00:30:11,741
You were here the night she died?

351
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:16,121
How long did you work for her?

352
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:19,958
Year I got out of the service,
I went to work at the studio.

353
00:30:21,835 --> 00:30:24,963
They sent me over here
to project a film for her...

354
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:28,300
...and she asked me to stay
and take care of her, so I did.

355
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,927
That was 1971.

356
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:35,307
When she disappeared,
did you know where she was?

357
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:38,101
No.

358
00:30:40,729 --> 00:30:45,317
She never married
and she seemed to be very private...

359
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:50,113
...but there must have been a...
There must have been a man...

360
00:30:50,822 --> 00:30:51,990
Someone she loved?

361
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,747
Every man who met her
fell in love with her.

362
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:01,458
It just couldn't be helped.

363
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,048
I just don't know
if she ever felt love herself.

364
00:32:00,267 --> 00:32:04,563
Hi. Yeah, I'm sorry
about the weirdness the other day.

365
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:08,525
I have to say,
my feelings were a little bruised.

366
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:12,696
But, thank you, Corky.
An apology is the sign of a gentleman.

367
00:32:12,904 --> 00:32:14,656
Inga roped me into the shenanigans.

368
00:32:14,781 --> 00:32:17,576
She's my sister,
but I also think she might be the devil.

369
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:20,495
Also, you know, I thought
if you gave me mouth-to-mouth...

370
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:23,957
...it would be a fantastic way for us
to get to know each other.

371
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:26,126
The truth is, you're awesome.

372
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:29,171
By the way, did you know
there's a mystery to this house?

373
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:31,756
I know.

374
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:35,010
I only recently discovered...

375
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:37,095
...that movies aren't shot
from beginning to end.

376
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:39,181
So I took the last movie
she ever made...

377
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:42,726
...and reassembled the shots
in the order they were photographed.

378
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:48,023
Okay.

379
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:50,734
I just noticed something strange.

380
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:55,238
The last month before she disappeared,
she's only shown from here up.

381
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:01,161
Maybe she was pregnant.

382
00:33:01,703 --> 00:33:04,706
She didn't have any kids.
Never married and no kids.

383
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:06,583
It's just a hunch.

384
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:11,588
Also, the photograph in this magazine
is dated just after her reappearance.

385
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:13,256
There's an X on her robe.

386
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:16,176
I believe that insignia will tell us
where she was hiding.

387
00:33:16,301 --> 00:33:19,304
I've called the hospitals and hotels
that include the letter X...

388
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:21,515
...but so far, nothing.

389
00:33:23,058 --> 00:33:25,143
I need to talk to someone
who's an expert in clothing.

390
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:27,229
Oh, and one more thing.

391
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:31,816
She's often with this man,
but he's always obscured.

392
00:33:32,025 --> 00:33:35,695
A hand at the edge of a picture,
a silhouette...

393
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:37,781
...even a blur.

394
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:42,577
I think she called him Z.
I have to find out who this man is.

395
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,414
I just have to solve this case.

396
00:33:48,416 --> 00:33:49,334
What do you think?

397
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:53,630
I think the ability to sleuth
is an attractive quality in a woman.

398
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:06,977
Hey, don't they have a Costume
Department on the set of every film?

399
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:10,188
Yeah, but you should know
that movie people are kind of crazy.

400
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:11,982
Oh, goodness.
How crazy can they be?

401
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,108
Really crazy.

402
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:14,359
Dude, are we on yet?

403
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,570
No, I gotta be on one more...

404
00:34:17,612 --> 00:34:18,738
You' re fine.

405
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:21,449
- Oh, I just had a question.
- And I'm all out of answers.

406
00:34:21,658 --> 00:34:23,952
You look '50s. Go to set.

407
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,246
- But I was just wondering if maybe...
- Now!

408
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:28,123
Here we go. Okay, we're moving.

409
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:31,459
We're moving, people.
We're on our way.

410
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,670
We are moving!

411
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:36,256
MAN Hey, guys,
this is good. They got the feed up.

412
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:41,052
All right, let's just shoot the rehearsal.
Has anybody seen Mr. Fancy-Pants?

413
00:34:41,261 --> 00:34:43,471
Right here, you idiot.

414
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,557
Ah, nickname, I love a nickname.

415
00:34:45,765 --> 00:34:48,143
It's not a nickname, Andy.
It's not a nickname.

416
00:34:48,268 --> 00:34:49,936
You really are an idiot.

417
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:51,688
All right.
Copy that. On our way.

418
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:53,565
Okay, we're shooting the rehearsal!

419
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:56,610
Stop with the bowing.
Excuse me, sir. No, sir. No, I...

420
00:34:56,818 --> 00:35:00,238
By the way, it's "action,"
not "begin the acting."

421
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:01,615
When you're right, you're right.

422
00:35:01,823 --> 00:35:02,741
Action.

423
00:35:02,949 --> 00:35:05,452
Locking it up! Last looks, everybody.
Last looks.

424
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,662
- Walking away. Walking away.
- Quiet, please.

425
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:10,248
And we're rolling.

426
00:35:10,457 --> 00:35:11,499
Rolling!
We're rolling!

427
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:14,544
You're cute.
Thank you.

428
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:18,507
Okay, you hate crime, and action!

429
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,675
Hold him right there, boys.

430
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:26,431
Spider Weintraub.
As I live and breathe.

431
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,976
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney...

432
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:31,520
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but...

433
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:34,856
- What?
- I'm sorry. This just feels inauthentic.

434
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:36,107
Feels what?

435
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:38,401
Well, the scene takes place
in the '50s...

436
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,070
...but you're reading Miranda
to the suspect.

437
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:45,825
Excuse me. Why in the name of sweet
Christmas is this tiny person talking?

438
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:52,082
Well, reading of Miranda
upon arrest wasn't law until '63.

439
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,625
Is that right?

440
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,710
The scene is still delicious, either way.

441
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,839
- What's your name, hon?
- Uh, Nancy Drew.

442
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:01,341
I'm Bruce.

443
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:04,386
All right, I'll tell you what, why
don't you direct the movie, Nancy Drew?

444
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:07,180
Oh, my God!

445
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:08,640
Should we cut?

446
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,436
Listen, Nancy, would you consider,
you know, directing this film?

447
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:17,816
Because we can
get rid of this guy in a second.

448
00:36:18,149 --> 00:36:20,944
Is there a law against common courtesy
in Los Angeles?

449
00:36:21,152 --> 00:36:23,780
Courtesy is so awesome.
I'm really into it.

450
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:25,532
In my book, courtesy counts.

451
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,034
I'd like to read that book, Nancy.

452
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:39,087
It's not an X.
They're palm trees.

453
00:36:39,421 --> 00:36:43,049
Okay. What does that mean?

454
00:36:46,094 --> 00:36:47,637
The insignia on her robe.

455
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:50,056
It's, um...

456
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:53,059
Something Palms.

457
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:56,313
Oh, now I get it.
Just kidding, I don't.

458
00:36:56,521 --> 00:37:01,109
Southern Pines.
California Hot Springs. No.

459
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:04,112
Twin Palms Bungalows and Spa.

460
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:24,466
There was a fire some 20 years ago
and all the records were burned.

461
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:28,094
And on top of that,
I'm afraid our guest list is confidential.

462
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:34,684
Where's the closest hospital?

463
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:40,398
All the children born in one week
24 years ago?

464
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,443
Yes. Well, all the ones given up
for adoption.

465
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:46,446
The birth mother,
she may have left money for the child...

466
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:48,532
I'm sorry, but those records
are sealed.

467
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,742
Only a court order
can open those records.

468
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:53,745
And only by a child seeking a parent.
Are you the child?

469
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,913
No.

470
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:57,916
But, um, thank you, anyway.

471
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:04,589
Here's a blondie for your trouble.

472
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,320
Did...? Did you make these?

473
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:33,159
No. Hannah, our housekeeper
back in River Heights, did.

474
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:36,204
She sent over a tin.
She's a wonderful baker.

475
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,207
It's so weird.
My mother made these when I was a kid.

476
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:42,127
I haven't had one in years.

477
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,175
It's so perfectly moist.

478
00:38:49,551 --> 00:38:50,468
Come here.

479
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:04,149
The county recommends a pediatrician
to new adoptive parents.

480
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,569
The doctor's files aren't sealed.
This might help.

481
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:14,159
- Thank you.
- And you didn't get that from me.

482
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:21,958
Ha. Twenty-four years ago.
Wow, that is so long ago.

483
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:26,963
Yes. It would have been
a first appointment, a newborn.

484
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:31,051
I know it seems a little "disorganisized"
but I know where everything is.

485
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,767
Ow.

486
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:45,106
Right there. Here it is.
There were two newborns that week.

487
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,400
No, make that three.

488
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:51,279
Oh, but I don't think
I can release any information.

489
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:52,405
Let me call headquarters.

490
00:39:53,865 --> 00:39:55,867
Ha, ha, maybe that's them. Hello?

491
00:39:56,076 --> 00:39:57,118
Hey, girl. It's Jimmy.

492
00:39:57,327 --> 00:40:00,872
Oh, Jimmy. Yeah, no, I was looking
for it, then I found it. I found it.

493
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:02,749
I did find it and it's...

494
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:05,752
That's not it, but it's pink.
And it wasn't...

495
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:07,629
No, it wasn't where
I thought it was...

496
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,549
- I think it's yellow.
- Because I put it somewhere else.

497
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:14,302
Yeah. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
I'm gonna have to call you ba...

498
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:16,388
I'm gonna have to call you back.

499
00:40:16,596 --> 00:40:20,976
Ha. Nice try, squirt. Nice try.

500
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:52,674
Hello, I'm looking for Jane Brighton.

501
00:40:53,425 --> 00:40:54,551
Are you Jane Brighton?

502
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,428
Are you Martine Dahlberg?

503
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:58,096
Yeah. Why?

504
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,390
I was just wondering,
were you adopted?

505
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,850
Are you Susan Thabit?

506
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:04,352
Were you adopted?

507
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:06,855
- Are you Martine Dahlberg?
- Yes.

508
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,106
Were you adopted?

509
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:09,774
Hello...

510
00:41:09,983 --> 00:41:11,026
Can I help you?

511
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:13,028
Sorry, no.

512
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:16,239
No.

513
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,658
No.

514
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:47,103
Hello?
Um, is there a Jane Brighton here?

515
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:50,857
Ugh, that depends on who's asking.

516
00:41:50,982 --> 00:41:53,068
Were you adopted?

517
00:41:54,736 --> 00:41:56,404
Yeah.

518
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,536
Who are you?

519
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:10,669
You're who I'm looking for.

520
00:42:11,419 --> 00:42:12,462
I am?

521
00:42:15,048 --> 00:42:16,091
Hi.

522
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:24,015
You're kidding.

523
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:26,434
Did your parents tell you
that you were adopted?

524
00:42:26,852 --> 00:42:30,188
It wasn't hard to figure out.
I mean, I didn't look anything like them.

525
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:34,442
My mother passed away,
and then my father...

526
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:36,528
I had to get away from him.

527
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:40,407
Uh, I left home early.

528
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:42,993
Dehlia Draycott.

529
00:42:45,704 --> 00:42:47,789
Dehlia may have made a
provision for you.

530
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:50,500
If we prove you're her daughter,
there may be some money.

531
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:55,005
Is this some kind of a practical joke?

532
00:42:55,213 --> 00:42:57,924
Oh, no. I don't joke.

533
00:42:58,758 --> 00:43:01,970
I get that a lot.
I'm 12, but I skipped a few grades.

534
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,847
Because you were ahead academically?

535
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:06,766
Heck, no. There just wasn't
any action in junior high...

536
00:43:06,892 --> 00:43:09,186
...so my dad made a few calls.

537
00:43:09,394 --> 00:43:12,606
Anyway, I was wondering
if we could do, like, a dinner thing?

538
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:15,025
Like, Saturday-ish?
Not a date.

539
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:17,194
Corky, you've been really nice to me...

540
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:19,613
I'll show you the sights.
We'll have a few laughs.

541
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,781
...but there's this guy
in River Heights.

542
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:24,492
Oh, ouch. Okay.

543
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:27,621
Well, you still need to eat,
and it's not a date.

544
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,915
Okay. Seeing as how it's not a date...

545
00:43:39,841 --> 00:43:42,010
What was th...?
Go. Go, go, go.

546
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:43,386
That car, it almost hit us.

547
00:43:43,595 --> 00:43:47,015
Hurry! Go, go, go!
Hey!

548
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,937
I wonder who tried to kill us.

549
00:43:52,145 --> 00:43:55,899
Yeah, I'm wondering that too.
In fact, I'm kind of freaking out about it.

550
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:59,110
Well, usually when someone
tries to kill me...

551
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:01,947
...it's because I'm onto something.

552
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:04,241
Oh, you have a cut.

553
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:07,577
There were dealer plates on the SUV.

554
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:10,163
I made note of the make,
year and model.

555
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:14,960
Plus, the damage sustained from hitting
the barrier could help us identify it too.

556
00:44:17,462 --> 00:44:19,464
You're just not like the other girls,
Nancy.

557
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:32,394
Hello?

558
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:36,439
Do not look into this
Dehlia Draycott business.

559
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:39,985
If you proceed, you will be harmed.
Do you understand?

560
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:43,947
We' re not interested
in mudslide insurance...

561
00:44:44,155 --> 00:44:46,575
...but, um, thank you for calling.
Have a nice day.

562
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:00,422
Whoa, what's this?

563
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,758
I apologize, sir.
Allow me to introduce myself.

564
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:07,095
My name is Nancy Drew.
It's very nice to make your acquaintance.

565
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:09,598
I've been trying to set up
an appointment, but...

566
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:13,894
Posture, eye contact.
Pay attention, people, that's breeding.

567
00:45:14,102 --> 00:45:17,731
I was just wondering if I could have five
minutes to discuss something with you.

568
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:20,567
Any time at all.
Here's my card.

569
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,660
Thank you.

570
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,954
It's about one of your clients,
a movie star.

571
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,499
Ha, ha, all my clients
are movie stars, muffin.

572
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:39,211
Well, I may have found
some evidence suggesting that...

573
00:45:39,419 --> 00:45:42,130
- Astonishing.
- Um, It may imply that...

574
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,798
Absolutely astonishing.

575
00:45:45,592 --> 00:45:46,718
As I was saying...

576
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:48,929
I'm very disappointed, senator.

577
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:52,682
Well, as you know,
you do owe me a favor or two.

578
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:56,520
Well, talk to somebody else
on your staff.

579
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:58,396
Maybe they can help you out on this.

580
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:05,487
Jane? Are you there?

581
00:46:06,446 --> 00:46:09,574
Hi. I saw the lawyers who represent
the estate today and they...

582
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:11,660
It's all right.
I don't need any help.

583
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,871
What? Don't you wanna know
if you're Dehlia's daughter?

584
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,374
Just leave us alone, okay?

585
00:46:17,582 --> 00:46:20,710
You seem like a really nice person.
I'm sorry.

586
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:43,024
The will is in the Chinese box.

587
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:46,361
So there is a will.

588
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:02,836
See for yourself.

589
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:13,471
Miss Draycott collected chinoiserie.

590
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,642
Last year, the owner sold off the most
valuable pieces, against my wishes.

591
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,145
Do you remember
the name of the dealer?

592
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,230
You ask a lot of questions.

593
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:27,444
Is it this place? I noticed the ad
was circled. Do they have the box?

594
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:29,446
Let me tell you something, young lady.

595
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:33,074
Everyone who has tried to piece
this thing together has run into trouble.

596
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,662
Hello?

597
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:42,876
So you should be getting an early
birthday present/reward thing...

598
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:46,630
...for going along with my
"no sleuthing while in California" thing.

599
00:47:47,047 --> 00:47:48,215
Dad, you shouldn't have.

600
00:47:48,423 --> 00:47:50,926
- I don't really deserve it.
- Yes, you do.

601
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,512
I know it hasn't been easy for you...

602
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,805
...and this'll make me feel less guilty.

603
00:47:56,973 --> 00:47:58,725
But what is it?

604
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:01,561
Uh, just walk outside.

605
00:48:03,438 --> 00:48:06,983
Hi. My sister dropped me off
and now she won't go away.

606
00:48:08,026 --> 00:48:09,069
Leave!

607
00:48:09,277 --> 00:48:12,280
My roadster.
Dad, how did you get it here?

608
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:13,949
Happy almost-your-birthday.

609
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,785
Ned.
You drove this all the way here?

610
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:19,704
Uh, yeah, it wouldn't fit
in my suitcase.

611
00:48:19,913 --> 00:48:22,916
Huh, I've missed this car so much...

612
00:48:23,041 --> 00:48:25,335
...and you.
I've missed the car and you.

613
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:31,258
Oh, Ned, Corky. Corky, Ned.

614
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,760
Ned is my...

615
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:36,388
...really good friend
from River Heights.

616
00:48:36,596 --> 00:48:39,808
River Heights, right.
That's in one of those fly-over states.

617
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,310
Wait. Did I interrupt something?

618
00:48:42,644 --> 00:48:44,938
Yes, actually. You did.

619
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:47,941
Hello?

620
00:48:48,066 --> 00:48:50,652
- Hello? Nancy?
- Oh, Dad. Thank you so much.

621
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,445
We have to go.

622
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:57,534
Corky's going on a date with her?

623
00:48:57,742 --> 00:49:01,830
Whoa, Nancy Weirdo has,
like, two dates.

624
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,749
Oh, that other one is cute.

625
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:08,086
I don't usually go for the
just-back-from-slopping-the-hogs type...

626
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:11,506
...but, ha, he's cute.

627
00:49:31,026 --> 00:49:33,612
Hello.
Would you like to order some drinks?

628
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,114
I'll have a glass of milk, please.

629
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,702
Ah, milk. How refreshingly wholesome.
I'll have the exact same thing.

630
00:49:42,162 --> 00:49:43,205
Who is this person?

631
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,707
Nancy and I met,
and things just clicked.

632
00:49:46,124 --> 00:49:48,627
We laugh, we talk.
We keep it real.

633
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:51,129
- Keep it real?
- We're basically best friends.

634
00:49:51,338 --> 00:49:53,215
It's funny
that she never mentioned you.

635
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,928
Hey, buddy, she wants your drink order.

636
00:49:59,054 --> 00:50:01,473
Um, can I get an iced latte?

637
00:50:01,973 --> 00:50:04,392
hNo latte in Chinese restaurant, silly.

638
00:50:05,018 --> 00:50:09,272
Yeah, silly.
No latte in the Chinese restaurant.

639
00:50:09,481 --> 00:50:10,524
Don't talk to me.

640
00:50:10,649 --> 00:50:13,652
All right.
Wow, this is fun, huh?

641
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,488
Ned and I have known
each other since second grade.

642
00:50:16,696 --> 00:50:19,699
He helped me solve the mystery
of the missing chalkboard erasers.

643
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:21,701
It was a janitor.

644
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,621
Oh, fantastic.

645
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:29,501
Oh, my gosh.
How funny.

646
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:33,046
Here we are and here you are.
Hi, what's your name?

647
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:34,297
Ned?

648
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:36,174
You're not sure?

649
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:39,427
No. I mean, yes, I'm sure.

650
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:40,554
Why are you here?

651
00:50:41,179 --> 00:50:42,556
Why are you here?

652
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:43,807
Why are you here?

653
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:48,270
Hey, hey, guys, don't gang up on me.
I'm sensitive.

654
00:51:00,282 --> 00:51:05,287
Hello. I'm looking for a box.
That is, one in particular.

655
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,538
What kind of box?

656
00:51:07,873 --> 00:51:08,915
Chinese?

657
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:14,754
Well, you've come to the right place.

658
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,300
So this is why
you wanted Chinese food.

659
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:22,053
What are you guys doing in here?
This is so nonlinear.

660
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:24,764
Everybody pick a row.
Check inside each box.

661
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:26,641
We're looking for a will.

662
00:51:30,312 --> 00:51:31,771
- Wait, what's over there?
- Hey.

663
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,315
Ned, did you see this box yet?

664
00:51:33,732 --> 00:51:34,774
Nothing there.

665
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:37,277
No, no, no. Don't... Don't touch.
Corky.

666
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:41,865
Hey, watch the top.
That is very expensive.

667
00:51:46,786 --> 00:51:48,955
Hey there. Come here.
You see this? It's big.

668
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:50,957
Put that down.

669
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:57,297
What? You think you're funny?
Do you think you're funny?

670
00:51:57,506 --> 00:51:59,299
So not cute.

671
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:05,555
There is one more.

672
00:52:19,528 --> 00:52:23,573
So, Nance, what's the deal
with you and Ned?

673
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:24,950
Do you hear something?

674
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:27,452
No, I mean, are you two like a thing?

675
00:52:30,038 --> 00:52:31,831
Excuse me,
I have to defuse this bomb.

676
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,835
Ugh, no kidding.
Love is a battlefield.

677
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:14,249
Nancy.

678
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,417
That's the SUV
that tried to run us down.

679
00:53:57,542 --> 00:53:58,793
The side's damaged. Come on.

680
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,962
What was that?
Are you okay? What was that?

681
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:04,424
- Hurry, we're losing them.
- Oh, so you meant literally a bomb.

682
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:07,010
What was that?
What was that? Are you okay?

683
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:08,261
Hello?

684
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:15,685
They turned up that street!

685
00:54:15,894 --> 00:54:18,063
Hold on. I thought we were
driving away from them.

686
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:19,648
That's why I got in the car.

687
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:21,525
- Buckled up?
- I'm fine.

688
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,947
Buckling up.

689
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:36,206
Say we do catch up with them,
what happens then?

690
00:54:37,165 --> 00:54:38,208
Seriously.

691
00:54:38,416 --> 00:54:41,211
It gets my goat when
someone tries to kill me. It's so rude.

692
00:54:41,419 --> 00:54:43,213
But it only makes me
wanna try harder.

693
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:44,548
Then let the horses run.

694
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:47,175
We will go the posted speed limit
and no faster.

695
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:56,226
Everybody in the universe
drives over the speed limit, Nancy.

696
00:54:56,434 --> 00:54:59,145
Nancy is trying to say
the ends do not justify the means.

697
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:00,814
Your means will lose them.

698
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:03,859
It's important to judge the ends
and the means independently...

699
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,110
...to do what's right.

700
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:08,029
Didn't you promise your father
that you wouldn't sleuth?

701
00:55:11,449 --> 00:55:13,952
Aren't you breaking that promise?

702
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,251
What are you gonna do?

703
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,171
I have to stop working on this case.

704
00:55:24,379 --> 00:55:26,173
I have to stop and be normal.

705
00:55:43,064 --> 00:55:44,191
What's this?

706
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:49,529
Oh, just normal stuff.
Normal teenage stuff.

707
00:55:51,072 --> 00:55:53,366
Okay. Carry on.

708
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:58,705
- He just pinched me!
- Deal with it.

709
00:55:58,914 --> 00:56:01,833
If we're gonna baby-sit him,
we should get paid.

710
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:04,419
Ned, why is your shirt all wrinkled?

711
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,922
Because my closet's 6 inches deep.

712
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:10,050
That's not possible.
How could...?

713
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:13,178
Show me.

714
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,268
What are you guys doing?

715
00:56:21,436 --> 00:56:23,730
"Hey, Corky.
We're super glad you asked.

716
00:56:23,939 --> 00:56:25,690
Would you like to tag along? "

717
00:56:29,444 --> 00:56:33,615
Seriously. Oh, God.
What is going on?

718
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:39,663
I just fell down.

719
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:43,834
But I'm fine.

720
00:56:46,878 --> 00:56:49,589
I still don't know what's going on.

721
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,305
Whenever you feel like letting me know.

722
00:57:17,826 --> 00:57:20,036
A secret passageway.

723
00:57:20,328 --> 00:57:23,039
So this is how the intruder
has been getting upstairs.

724
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:24,916
This is nuts.

725
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:28,253
Ned, will you get my flashlight?
It's in my kit.

726
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,798
Wouldn't this be considered sleuthing?

727
00:57:32,424 --> 00:57:35,343
Who are we kidding?
I can't stop.

728
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:38,180
Once I find the will
and determine the identity of Z...

729
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,600
...I'll tell my father everything.
He'll understand.

730
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,728
I mean, how else
am I gonna help Jane?

731
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:46,313
It's important.

732
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:49,649
Don't you think?

733
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,444
Yeah.

734
00:58:24,351 --> 00:58:26,645
What was that?

735
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,441
I think we just had an earthquake.

736
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:38,031
Hello?

737
00:58:43,537 --> 00:58:45,330
Nancy.

738
00:58:49,709 --> 00:58:51,670
Are you all right?

739
00:58:51,878 --> 00:58:52,921
Where are you?

740
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,549
I'm in the basement.

741
00:59:00,428 --> 00:59:02,430
Do you see anything?

742
00:59:04,933 --> 00:59:06,601
I found a tunnel and I'm going in.

743
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,396
If I'm not back in 10 minutes,
something bad's happened.

744
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:12,941
I don't think that was a joke.

745
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,973
I lay there on the ground
Who will wind the clock when I'm away

746
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:47,976
Hi.

747
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:53,523
A tunnel in the laundry room.

748
00:59:53,732 --> 00:59:55,901
What the hell is that all about?

749
00:59:56,109 --> 00:59:58,403
John Leshing.
He's a tenant in this building.

750
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:00,822
He's the caretaker
of the Dehlia Draycott estate.

751
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:03,200
If anyone knows about the tunnel,
he does.

752
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:06,536
That man has always
given me the willies.

753
01:00:06,661 --> 01:00:10,081
The drowning-kittens type.
You know what I mean?

754
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:23,136
Hi. These are for you two.

755
01:00:23,637 --> 01:00:26,139
- Here you go.
- Okay.

756
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:30,310
These are for you two.

757
01:00:35,023 --> 01:00:36,775
I hope you attend.

758
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:47,619
I know that she's weird,
but we have to go.

759
01:00:47,827 --> 01:00:49,079
Why?

760
01:00:49,287 --> 01:00:52,415
Ned, my future husband,
is gonna be there.

761
01:00:57,003 --> 01:00:58,880
Jane? It's me, Nancy.

762
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:02,634
I was wondering if you and Allie
wanted to come to a party.

763
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:17,148
Oh, my goodness.

764
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:27,242
Wow, guys, your streamers look great.

765
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:29,035
Let's see yours.

766
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:36,835
Yeah, yours are all right.

767
01:01:37,377 --> 01:01:39,337
Downloading's cool...

768
01:01:40,088 --> 01:01:41,840
...but nothing sounds like vinyl.

769
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:45,177
You couldn't be more right
if you tried, Nancy.

770
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:56,855
Yeah.

771
01:01:58,857 --> 01:01:59,900
- Hi.
- Hi.

772
01:02:00,108 --> 01:02:02,819
I brought a few friends.
I hope you don't mind, all right?

773
01:02:02,903 --> 01:02:04,279
No.

774
01:02:07,616 --> 01:02:12,078
Oh, I didn't get the memo
about it being a retarded theme.

775
01:02:12,287 --> 01:02:13,455
Hey, Ned.

776
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:14,706
Hi.

777
01:02:14,915 --> 01:02:17,417
Oh, can I take your coat or...?

778
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:18,960
Okay.

779
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,422
Um, refreshments
are in the dining room.

780
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:25,342
We'll be having a taffy pull later, guys.

781
01:02:28,053 --> 01:02:29,930
Come on in.
Hi.

782
01:02:30,138 --> 01:02:32,098
Refreshments in the dining room.

783
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:37,020
Oh, hello.
Hi. Oh, you look lovely.

784
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,907
Leshing, come quick!

785
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:01,711
So did you grow up in River Depths?
Tell me about it. Is there a river?

786
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,548
River Heights.
Uh, yeah, there's a river.

787
01:03:04,756 --> 01:03:09,010
Oh, I knew that. I totally knew that.
How did I know that? Ha, ha, ha.

788
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:11,930
Hey. Hey.

789
01:03:12,138 --> 01:03:13,390
Oh, you wanna dance, right?

790
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:20,605
Hi.

791
01:03:20,814 --> 01:03:24,442
Oh, I just wanted to ask you if you knew
about the secret passageway.

792
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,444
I think you got your answer.

793
01:03:29,155 --> 01:03:30,407
Are you Z?

794
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:37,497
Miss Drew, I suggest you rejoin
your guests and enjoy the party.

795
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:49,801
Hold on.

796
01:03:51,344 --> 01:03:52,387
Hello?

797
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:55,015
I warned
you, drop this Draycott business.

798
01:03:55,223 --> 01:03:56,266
Who is this?

799
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:04,399
- Please, stop calling here.
- Nancy?

800
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:07,736
Oh, hi, Dad.
Where are you?

801
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:09,487
I'm going to be even later

802
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:11,281
to your party than I said.
I'm sorry, honey.

803
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:13,867
Is everything all right?
Sounds a little crazy there.

804
01:04:14,075 --> 01:04:16,161
Y eah, everything's totally mellow.

805
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:20,540
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely. Hurry home.

806
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:34,095
Happy birthday, Nancy.

807
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:38,266
Back off, man.

808
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,447
Somebody call 911.

809
01:04:52,572 --> 01:04:55,575
You! You know CPR, come on,
do something. Trish is choking!

810
01:04:57,035 --> 01:04:59,037
This is not a joke.

811
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:03,083
Out of the way, out of the way.
Coming through.

812
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:05,919
Oh, my God. Do something,
do something. Somebody call 911!

813
01:05:06,127 --> 01:05:07,462
They'll be here in 10 minutes.

814
01:05:10,382 --> 01:05:11,758
Does she have any allergies?

815
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:14,886
She's insanely allergic to peanuts,
but she didn't eat anything.

816
01:05:15,095 --> 01:05:18,098
I had a peanut butter cookie,
and we were making out.

817
01:05:18,306 --> 01:05:19,683
Oh, my God.

818
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:21,852
I need a knife and a ballpoint pen.

819
01:05:22,477 --> 01:05:24,145
Here.
Here you go.

820
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:28,024
Everybody, unless you've had
advanced emergency medical training...

821
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:30,402
...you must never attempt this
on your own.

822
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,080
Holy crap.

823
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:48,962
You know, I have to admit...

824
01:05:49,171 --> 01:05:54,384
...I thought you were some insane,
freak, idiot person before, but you're not.

825
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:55,760
You're pretty terrific.

826
01:05:56,469 --> 01:05:58,680
Anyone can learn
emergency medical procedures.

827
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:01,266
Uh, I'm talking about
how great the party was.

828
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,351
Saving Trish's life was fantastic also.

829
01:06:04,311 --> 01:06:08,273
Anyways, I'd like to take you
and your little friend Ned out shopping.

830
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:10,233
You really do need a decent outfit.

831
01:06:14,946 --> 01:06:16,698
What happened?

832
01:06:16,907 --> 01:06:20,035
It was a lively party.
Almost everyone had a good time.

833
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,329
I take it you're Nancy's father.
That's right.

834
01:06:22,537 --> 01:06:24,539
We responded to a complaint
from a neighbor.

835
01:06:25,457 --> 01:06:26,625
Dad, this is Sergeant Billings.

836
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:29,753
No, no, no.
Let me say something.

837
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:31,838
You had a wild party.

838
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:35,467
You blew it out when Dad was MIA.

839
01:06:35,675 --> 01:06:38,386
Damage was done.
Things went amuck. I get it.

840
01:06:42,474 --> 01:06:43,391
Congratulations.

841
01:06:44,017 --> 01:06:47,979
Getting rowdy is part of being
a normal, non-sleuthing teenager.

842
01:06:50,899 --> 01:06:53,109
All right. That's a first.

843
01:06:59,157 --> 01:07:01,660
Come on. Come on.

844
01:07:09,042 --> 01:07:12,295
Hi. Obviously someone here
needs a little help with their look.

845
01:07:12,504 --> 01:07:14,589
Oh, it's not that bad.

846
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:16,758
Oh, please, it's a fashion teardown.

847
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:20,720
You have some nice pieces.
They're just not really working together.

848
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,266
Me? I was talking about her.

849
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:26,893
Oh, sorry.

850
01:07:27,185 --> 01:07:30,230
Wow, where did you get that dress?

851
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:35,026
Um, I made it from one
of my mother's patterns.

852
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:39,614
Oh, it is just darling.
I love the sincerity.

853
01:07:39,823 --> 01:07:41,366
I have to take your picture.

854
01:07:41,575 --> 01:07:45,954
You know what? I just remembered
how much I really hate this store.

855
01:07:46,997 --> 01:07:48,039
Excuse me?

856
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:52,752
I wish you could stay longer.

857
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:55,046
My mom said if I stayed
past the weekend...

858
01:07:55,255 --> 01:07:56,590
...that she'd turn my room into a den.

859
01:07:57,132 --> 01:07:58,049
Really?

860
01:07:58,592 --> 01:08:00,552
Anyway, Nancy,
I just want you to know...

861
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:02,429
...that I'm not interested
in that Inga person.

862
01:08:03,805 --> 01:08:05,974
In fact, she scares me.

863
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:09,936
And that if you like this Porky guy...

864
01:08:10,145 --> 01:08:11,605
Corky.

865
01:08:11,813 --> 01:08:13,481
...it's all right with me.

866
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:15,901
Ned, he's 12.

867
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:18,695
You just seem to really like
having him around.

868
01:08:19,946 --> 01:08:21,406
Ned, can I ask you a question?

869
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,493
Can you tell when a girl
is thinking how much she likes you...

870
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:29,122
...wondering if you like her, thinking
how important it is how you feel...

871
01:08:29,247 --> 01:08:32,250
...before she says anything more
about how she feels about you...

872
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:35,504
...because she's already saying
how she feels in her own way?

873
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:36,963
Can you repeat the question?

874
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:44,137
Your cab's here.
Sorry to see you go, Ned.

875
01:08:45,305 --> 01:08:47,057
I'll, uh, see you soon.

876
01:08:52,604 --> 01:08:54,064
Bye, Ned.

877
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:27,222
Jane, are you all right?

878
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:32,227
No. Child Protective Services, they...
They took her. They took Allie.

879
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,564
They said I was an unfit parent,
but it isn't true.

880
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:37,732
I didn't do any
of the things that they said.

881
01:09:38,358 --> 01:09:40,777
Uh, come in, come in.

882
01:09:44,531 --> 01:09:46,616
You're always able to help people.

883
01:09:46,825 --> 01:09:47,742
I can certainly try.

884
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:49,744
Why don't you come
downtown tomorrow?

885
01:09:49,953 --> 01:09:52,747
I will. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

886
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:56,418
Sure. What's the connection?
How did you two meet?

887
01:09:59,754 --> 01:10:02,674
I'm Dehlia Draycott's daughter.

888
01:10:04,759 --> 01:10:06,094
You're what? Wait.

889
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:09,848
Dad, it's so late.
Jane's tired and so am I.

890
01:10:09,973 --> 01:10:13,393
Let's go over all this in the morning,
in the promising light of a new day.

891
01:10:13,602 --> 01:10:15,061
Right.
Have you been sleuthing?

892
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:17,564
Dad, do you really think
I've been sleuthing?

893
01:10:17,772 --> 01:10:20,275
- That's not answering my question.
- You're not answering mine.

894
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:21,651
- Your what?
- What?

895
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,777
- What?
- What?

896
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:24,571
I'm going to bed.

897
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:28,533
Good night.

898
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,622
Uh, listen, I have to tell you
something.

899
01:10:33,747 --> 01:10:37,792
Right after you first found me, someone
came to my apartment. Uh, a man.

900
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:42,088
He said if I ever tried to prove that I was
Dehlia's daughter, that I would regret it.

901
01:10:42,297 --> 01:10:45,008
That's why I was afraid
to talk to you that time.

902
01:10:45,091 --> 01:10:49,262
- What did he look like?
- He was big...

903
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:53,850
Dark hair. Scary.

904
01:10:56,269 --> 01:11:01,358
And he had one pale blue eye
and one very, very dark.

905
01:11:20,752 --> 01:11:23,880
Someone is filing grievances
against you, but I don't know who yet.

906
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:27,008
But it isn't true.
None of it happened.

907
01:11:27,217 --> 01:11:29,511
How can they just take a kid
away from its mother?

908
01:11:29,636 --> 01:11:33,265
I believe you. And I think a judge
will too. It just takes time.

909
01:11:33,473 --> 01:11:36,101
We'll get her back.
I promise you.

910
01:11:36,309 --> 01:11:40,772
Now, is there anyone
who might have something against you?

911
01:11:41,815 --> 01:11:44,442
Dad, look,
there's something I need to tell you.

912
01:11:44,651 --> 01:11:45,986
It has to do with this whole...

913
01:11:46,194 --> 01:11:47,863
Carson!

914
01:11:47,988 --> 01:11:49,030
Nancy.

915
01:11:49,239 --> 01:11:52,868
After Jane's little revelation, I found out
who the lawyer for the estate was...

916
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,327
...and I gave him a call.

917
01:11:55,078 --> 01:11:57,873
He and I are going to talk privately.
Do you have your car?

918
01:11:58,415 --> 01:12:00,500
Down the block.
What are you two...?

919
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:03,086
Dinner, tonight.
I've got a lot of questions...

920
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:05,797
...and I think you
just might have the answers.

921
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:13,221
Feel like some hot cocoa?

922
01:12:20,103 --> 01:12:23,023
...Channel presents
The Life and Death of Dehlia Draycott.

923
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:25,734
It's so weird.
I never used to think about her at all...

924
01:12:25,942 --> 01:12:27,402
...and now I see her everywhere.

925
01:12:33,033 --> 01:12:35,118
What if I am an unfit mother?

926
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,913
I don't know what I'm doing.
No one taught me what to do.

927
01:12:38,038 --> 01:12:39,080
Jane...

928
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:42,834
Nancy, I don't think you understand
what it's like growing up without a mom.

929
01:12:43,752 --> 01:12:46,254
Actually, my mother died
when I was very young.

930
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:49,090
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

931
01:12:49,925 --> 01:12:51,593
I didn't know.

932
01:12:52,511 --> 01:12:54,179
You've been so nice to me.

933
01:12:56,056 --> 01:12:58,975
Sometimes,
I think I can remember her.

934
01:12:59,184 --> 01:13:01,394
But I never know
if what I'm remembering...

935
01:13:01,603 --> 01:13:04,105
...is something I saw in a picture...

936
01:13:04,314 --> 01:13:05,982
...or just made up.

937
01:13:07,108 --> 01:13:08,985
She's, um...

938
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:12,447
She's a mystery.

939
01:13:17,118 --> 01:13:19,412
Someone in the village told me

940
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:22,332
that the will is in the Chinese box.

941
01:13:26,628 --> 01:13:28,088
Wait a minute.

942
01:13:37,264 --> 01:13:38,390
What are we looking for?

943
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:40,475
A clue.

944
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:42,269
It's empty.

945
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:45,480
You must make the dragon bow.

946
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:57,993
The will.

947
01:13:58,118 --> 01:13:59,661
I must've fallen asleep when I heard this.

948
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:01,121
I've finally found it.

949
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:03,748
Dehlia used a clue
from one of her movies...

950
01:14:03,957 --> 01:14:05,917
...to show someone
where to find the will.

951
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,128
Now all I have to do
is make the dragon bow.

952
01:14:08,336 --> 01:14:09,671
Okay, you lost me at "dragon."

953
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:11,965
I'll be back later.

954
01:14:14,176 --> 01:14:19,389
Hello? Hello, Mr. Louie?
Are you in there?

955
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:22,184
Hello?

956
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,854
I'm sorry to interrupt your dinner...

957
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:27,731
...but this means so much
to two of my friends.

958
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:29,399
It's fine.

959
01:14:41,286 --> 01:14:43,038
It's the will.

960
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,751
If you want it, you can have it.

961
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:50,962
Huh, thank you so much.

962
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:58,678
"I give all my property and assets
to my daughter born July 28th, 1981."

963
01:14:58,887 --> 01:15:00,555
I knew it.

964
01:15:08,396 --> 01:15:10,148
Dad. I have to talk to you.

965
01:15:10,357 --> 01:15:11,942
What number are you calling from?

966
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:13,902
My cell phone.
The one you gave me.

967
01:15:14,027 --> 01:15:15,362
I didn't give you a cell phone.

968
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:24,663
Honey?

969
01:15:24,871 --> 01:15:27,791
I have to get off this phone.
Everything's fine. See you tonight.

970
01:15:27,999 --> 01:15:29,543
Nancy...

971
01:16:43,074 --> 01:16:45,243
So they're the ones
who've been breaking in.

972
01:17:03,178 --> 01:17:06,640
Oh, Mary, you're exaggerating.

973
01:17:06,848 --> 01:17:09,226
No one blames you for Henry's death.

974
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,311
Least of all Jezebel.

975
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:21,530
You've got to stop.
It's not your fault, Mary.

976
01:17:22,572 --> 01:17:26,034
You do believe that, don't you, baby?

977
01:17:33,124 --> 01:17:36,670
You don't think I was born bad,
do you?

978
01:17:38,004 --> 01:17:42,926
I could never care
if you were. Mary, I love you.

979
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:10,954
Go check on her.

980
01:18:11,162 --> 01:18:13,456
Wait. I want to see this part.

981
01:18:13,582 --> 01:18:16,084
Kids will love it
just for making chocolate pasta

982
01:18:16,293 --> 01:18:17,836
for those delicious desserts.

983
01:18:18,044 --> 01:18:21,590
Besides pasta, you can also make
pie crust, cinnamon rolls...

984
01:19:36,998 --> 01:19:37,916
She's not there.

985
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:42,087
- Look again.
She's not there.

986
01:19:50,762 --> 01:19:52,097
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

987
01:19:53,682 --> 01:19:55,559
Go get her!

988
01:20:07,112 --> 01:20:08,697
Hey!

989
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:13,577
Hey.

990
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:17,247
She's getting away! Jump!

991
01:20:18,290 --> 01:20:19,833
Go, go, get the car.

992
01:20:20,584 --> 01:20:22,544
You idiots.

993
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,262
Right there.

994
01:21:17,516 --> 01:21:20,519
- Hi, Dad.
- Are you okay? What happened?

995
01:21:21,353 --> 01:21:23,355
Just your run-of-the-mill car accident.

996
01:21:24,064 --> 01:21:27,192
I swerved out of control
because, um...

997
01:21:28,235 --> 01:21:30,946
Because men were chasing me.
I've been working on a case.

998
01:21:31,154 --> 01:21:33,448
Uh, I'm gonna give you two
some time.

999
01:21:33,573 --> 01:21:35,450
Thank you.

1000
01:21:36,368 --> 01:21:38,995
- I started to tell you today.
- You could have been killed.

1001
01:21:39,204 --> 01:21:40,121
Do you realize that?

1002
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:45,126
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- This is a very dangerous city.

1003
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:49,089
- The world is not like River Heights.
- I know.

1004
01:21:49,297 --> 01:21:52,634
I mean, I tried to be normal.
I really tried.

1005
01:21:52,759 --> 01:21:56,179
I just start working on something
and I can't stop.

1006
01:21:56,721 --> 01:21:58,473
I wonder where you got that from.

1007
01:22:00,892 --> 01:22:04,104
I mean, the idea of a girl out there
without her mom...

1008
01:22:05,897 --> 01:22:09,109
Dehlia wanted to leave Jane the estate,
and I found the will.

1009
01:22:09,651 --> 01:22:12,571
Like you always say, "Others first."

1010
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:14,739
I just wish that
you'd talked to me about this.

1011
01:22:15,699 --> 01:22:19,035
I'll be okay, Dad.
We'll work it out. You're my guy.

1012
01:22:22,163 --> 01:22:24,541
- Hey, kiddo.
- Mr. Biedermeyer.

1013
01:22:24,749 --> 01:22:27,669
Uh, your father and I were going over
some business when we heard.

1014
01:22:28,295 --> 01:22:29,671
I hope you're all right.

1015
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,006
I'm fine.

1016
01:22:31,548 --> 01:22:32,465
Good.

1017
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:35,594
He's offered me some consulting work.
I can do it from home...

1018
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:38,722
...so we can go back to River Heights.

1019
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:40,599
And he pays a lot.

1020
01:22:47,397 --> 01:22:50,317
You know, I couldn't help but
overhear before about the mystery.

1021
01:22:50,525 --> 01:22:53,028
- Did you ever find the will?
- I did.

1022
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:55,739
Dehlia used one of her movies as a clue.

1023
01:22:55,947 --> 01:22:57,073
It was hidden...

1024
01:22:57,282 --> 01:22:59,784
...in the secret compartment
of a Chinese box.

1025
01:22:59,993 --> 01:23:02,704
Nancy always gets
to the bottom of things.

1026
01:23:02,913 --> 01:23:06,249
Well, my firm would certainly
be interested in seeing that will.

1027
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:09,920
You know, Mr. Biedermeyer
wasn't always just Dehlia's lawyer.

1028
01:23:10,128 --> 01:23:12,714
He was her manager as well,
from the start.

1029
01:23:12,839 --> 01:23:14,174
He made her who she was.

1030
01:23:16,051 --> 01:23:19,387
Then he brought her account
to his law firm, and...

1031
01:23:19,513 --> 01:23:22,933
Well, it's time to sign
on the dotted line.

1032
01:23:28,563 --> 01:23:31,816
That's, uh, quite a signature.

1033
01:23:32,025 --> 01:23:34,945
It's my middle initial.
For Zachary.

1034
01:23:35,153 --> 01:23:37,030
Z.

1035
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:49,626
Where is the will?

1036
01:23:58,093 --> 01:23:59,553
Where is it, honey?
Do you know?

1037
01:24:01,096 --> 01:24:04,015
You know, this is a little awkward.

1038
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:07,769
His firm stands to lose
more than a little income...

1039
01:24:07,894 --> 01:24:10,397
...if the money from the will
really does go to Jane.

1040
01:24:12,482 --> 01:24:14,442
Dad, we have to get out of this car now.

1041
01:24:14,985 --> 01:24:16,528
Why?

1042
01:24:16,736 --> 01:24:19,573
Excuse me, sir,
can you please stop the car?

1043
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:24,452
Nancy!

1044
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:30,709
Nancy!

1045
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:35,922
Dad, get away from them!

1046
01:24:45,432 --> 01:24:47,184
Excuse me, miss?

1047
01:24:47,309 --> 01:24:50,020
Oh, hello, honey.

1048
01:24:51,062 --> 01:24:54,482
Oh, the phone's over there, honey.

1049
01:24:59,696 --> 01:25:01,364
Sergeant Billings.

1050
01:25:01,573 --> 01:25:04,492
Do you know if a Dashiel Biedermeyer
rented in this building?

1051
01:25:05,035 --> 01:25:06,786
No. No, he owns it.

1052
01:25:06,995 --> 01:25:08,580
He owns the house you're in too.

1053
01:25:08,788 --> 01:25:10,540
He's a very rich man.

1054
01:25:14,836 --> 01:25:16,171
There she is.

1055
01:25:16,379 --> 01:25:18,590
Um, is there a back door anywhere?

1056
01:25:18,798 --> 01:25:21,176
Yes, honey, right over there.

1057
01:25:21,301 --> 01:25:24,012
Tell Sergeant Billings
to send a car to the house.

1058
01:25:31,311 --> 01:25:32,771
Get her!

1059
01:25:35,565 --> 01:25:37,359
Open up!

1060
01:25:37,776 --> 01:25:40,070
Open this door!

1061
01:25:41,112 --> 01:25:42,989
- Break it down.
- Come here.

1062
01:25:56,002 --> 01:25:58,421
Where's the will?

1063
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:00,298
I don't think I should say.

1064
01:26:00,507 --> 01:26:02,801
It's my insurance
that you won't hurt me.

1065
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,720
I'll squeeze it out of you.

1066
01:26:07,889 --> 01:26:09,474
Tell me something first.

1067
01:26:12,602 --> 01:26:14,980
I'm just really curious.

1068
01:26:15,188 --> 01:26:17,816
Why did you kill Dehlia?

1069
01:26:19,693 --> 01:26:23,655
After she gave up the baby,
she went kind of crazy.

1070
01:26:23,864 --> 01:26:27,701
She was gonna quit the business
and run off with that caretaker.

1071
01:26:27,826 --> 01:26:29,995
He was the father.

1072
01:26:30,203 --> 01:26:34,499
Whatever. She was my only client.
She was gonna fire me.

1073
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:38,128
I spent 20 years of my life
building up her career.

1074
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,338
I got mad.
I reacted violently.

1075
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:43,884
I felt kind of bad about it for a while,
but I'm okay with it now.

1076
01:26:45,552 --> 01:26:47,721
Leshing is Jane's father.

1077
01:26:47,846 --> 01:26:48,972
Does he know about the baby?

1078
01:26:49,181 --> 01:26:51,266
It doesn't matter!
Now where is the will?

1079
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:53,768
It's right here.

1080
01:27:03,069 --> 01:27:04,613
Come here.

1081
01:27:06,072 --> 01:27:08,992
Give it to me!
Give me the will!

1082
01:27:33,808 --> 01:27:36,728
Ah, ah, ah, just do it.

1083
01:27:37,979 --> 01:27:41,858
If you shoot me, it'll leave all
sorts of evidence. Very messy.

1084
01:27:47,781 --> 01:27:51,034
Strangulation leaves
a traceable handprint.

1085
01:27:52,702 --> 01:27:54,162
What do you suggest?

1086
01:27:54,371 --> 01:27:55,288
The best way to kill me?

1087
01:27:56,456 --> 01:27:58,333
Hm, let me think about that...

1088
01:27:58,542 --> 01:28:00,710
Enough of this crap.

1089
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:04,673
Put the gun down.
Hey!

1090
01:28:16,977 --> 01:28:19,813
I'm just
really curious. Why did you kill Dehlia?

1091
01:28:21,064 --> 01:28:22,399
After she gave up the baby...

1092
01:28:22,607 --> 01:28:24,067
...she went kind of crazy.

1093
01:28:25,527 --> 01:28:27,195
She was gonna quit the business and...

1094
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,655
Oh, my God!

1095
01:28:28,989 --> 01:28:30,115
Nancy?

1096
01:28:31,283 --> 01:28:33,368
Oh, my gosh,
you won't believe what's happened.

1097
01:28:33,577 --> 01:28:38,164
Hey, Mr. Biedermeyer. Inga Veinshtein.
I'm in water polo with Courtney.

1098
01:28:38,582 --> 01:28:40,041
Your granddaughter.

1099
01:28:40,876 --> 01:28:43,253
Yeah. I remember you.

1100
01:28:43,587 --> 01:28:45,755
Hey, Lurch, digging a hole
or something?

1101
01:28:45,964 --> 01:28:49,634
- Here. Okay. We had to show you this.
- Oh, my goodness!

1102
01:28:49,843 --> 01:28:51,386
It's called "The New Sincerity."

1103
01:28:51,928 --> 01:28:53,889
Yeah, I'm on the forefront.

1104
01:28:54,014 --> 01:28:56,391
I see something I think is cute,
I start wearing it...

1105
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,476
...and in like five seconds,
it's a total trend.

1106
01:28:58,685 --> 01:28:59,853
Penny-loafer fashion moment.

1107
01:29:02,147 --> 01:29:03,398
Oh, I need to borrow that coat.

1108
01:29:05,275 --> 01:29:07,027
Leshing, thank you so much.

1109
01:29:08,403 --> 01:29:11,114
You're welcome. Nancy.

1110
01:29:11,948 --> 01:29:14,326
There's something you should know.
It's about Jane.

1111
01:29:16,411 --> 01:29:17,454
She's your daughter.

1112
01:29:22,584 --> 01:29:25,921
Hey, you with the shovel.
No. It's him.

1113
01:29:26,129 --> 01:29:27,255
Have you seen my father?

1114
01:29:27,464 --> 01:29:28,715
It's a party!

1115
01:29:28,924 --> 01:29:31,218
Nancy, darling, are you okay?

1116
01:29:31,426 --> 01:29:32,594
Oh, good, good.

1117
01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:34,763
- Oh, hi, honey. How are you?
- Hi, Mr. Drew.

1118
01:29:34,971 --> 01:29:37,891
I was locked in a trunk. What happened?
Are you okay?

1119
01:29:38,099 --> 01:29:39,142
Yeah, I'm fine.

1120
01:29:40,519 --> 01:29:43,522
Okay, let's get him up.
All right, easy, easy, easy.

1121
01:29:43,647 --> 01:29:46,358
Looks like my new job
might not work out now.

1122
01:29:46,566 --> 01:29:48,527
Yeah. Maybe not.

1123
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:51,029
So, what exactly happened?

1124
01:29:52,197 --> 01:29:54,991
Dad, do you really wanna know?

1125
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,243
Yeah.

1126
01:29:59,579 --> 01:30:00,622
Do I?

1127
01:30:16,388 --> 01:30:18,056
I don't know what to say.

1128
01:31:06,104 --> 01:31:10,692
Nancy, I want you to know
I appreciate how hard it was...

1129
01:31:11,026 --> 01:31:12,485
...for you to do the right thing.

1130
01:31:15,614 --> 01:31:17,157
I'm very proud of you.

1131
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,627
You know, Barbara Barbara
Realty would be delighted...

1132
01:31:28,835 --> 01:31:31,338
...to continue to rent
this property for you.

1133
01:31:31,463 --> 01:31:32,714
Thanks, but no, thanks.

1134
01:31:32,923 --> 01:31:35,091
Well, what are you gonna do
with this place?

1135
01:31:35,217 --> 01:31:39,387
I'm gonna live here, with my kid
and anyone else who needs a place.

1136
01:31:39,596 --> 01:31:42,390
Well, I think maybe you and I
should talk this over before you make...

1137
01:31:42,599 --> 01:31:45,101
Feel free to leave at any time.

1138
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:10,544
Allie. Allie. Come here.

1139
01:32:40,073 --> 01:32:42,993
There it is.
Just like clockwork.

1140
01:32:43,201 --> 01:32:44,119
What?

1141
01:32:44,953 --> 01:32:46,121
Postpartum depression.

1142
01:32:47,455 --> 01:32:49,249
You're sad the case is over.

1143
01:32:50,292 --> 01:32:52,460
That's ridiculous.
I'm glad it all worked out.

1144
01:32:53,003 --> 01:32:55,505
You're only happy
when there's trouble.

1145
01:32:56,339 --> 01:32:58,508
This I know for sure.

1146
01:32:58,633 --> 01:33:03,096
But that's who you are
and it's all right with me.

1147
01:33:03,305 --> 01:33:04,764
Ned, that's so sweet.

1148
01:33:18,945 --> 01:33:20,822
- Nancy?
- Yes?

1149
01:33:21,031 --> 01:33:23,742
Phone call.
Long distance from Scotland.

1150
01:33:23,867 --> 01:33:28,246
Something about the Loch Ness monster
and some missing diamonds.

1151
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:30,832
Another case.
