00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,132
<i>The Pacific Ocean</i>
<i>between California and Hawaii</i>

2
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:56,687
<i>is the loneliest stretch</i>
<i>of water in the world.</i>

3
00:00:56,788 --> 00:01:01,942
<i>A century ago, this was a
rarely-traveled route to paradise.</i>

4
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:06,663
<i>Now it's a race course for the
Indianapolis 500 of the open ocean.</i>

5
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:12,686
<i>An athletic test of speed and
endurance known as the Transpac.</i>

6
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:17,240
<i>Roy Disney knows</i>
<i>these waters well,</i>

7
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:19,609
<i>with two wins and two</i>
<i>record-breaking passages</i>

8
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,379
<i>over the course</i>
<i>of 16 Transpacs.</i>

9
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:25,515
<i>Now he's giving the next</i>
<i>generation an opportunity</i>

10
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:27,768
<i>by offering a bunch of rookies</i>
<i>the chance of a lifetime.</i>

11
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,455
<i>Thirty hopefuls were chosen to try
out for a new Transpac campaign</i>

12
00:01:32,557 --> 00:01:35,525
<i>to be called the</i> Morning Light.

13
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:39,789
<i>A team of judges pushed them</i>
<i>hard for a week,</i>

14
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,230
<i>and by the end the 15 best</i>
<i>and brightest had emerged.</i>

15
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:45,007
We think you ought
to come to Hawaii.

16
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:47,431
- No way!
- Whoo!

17
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,268
<i>The 15 sailors will</i>
<i>train for six months</i>

18
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:53,070
<i>in the big winds</i>
<i>and big seas off Hawaii</i>

19
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:57,409
<i>before choosing a crew of 11 to race</i>
<i>from California to Diamond Head.</i>

20
00:01:57,447 --> 00:01:59,574
<i>They will face more than 70 competitors,</i>

21
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:03,642
<i>and they'll try to match the legendary</i>
<i>crew of</i> Argonaut <i>from 1969,</i>

22
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:07,486
<i>another bunch of teenagers</i>
<i>who borrowed their dad's boat</i>

23
00:02:07,523 --> 00:02:09,582
<i>and won it all.</i>

24
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,492
<i>This is the story of</i> Morning Light.

25
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:26,302
<i> This is gonna be my first story.</i>

26
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,171
<i>This is gonna be an epic story.</i>

27
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:35,009
<i>This is gonna probably</i>
<i>be my favorite story.</i>

28
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:38,680
<i>How it all began for Jesse Fielding</i>
<i>on the ocean, hopefully...</i>

29
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:42,157
<i>... uh, or it could just be a big flop.</i>

30
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,081
<i>Some of us are ready</i>
<i>for the full boot camp.</i>

31
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:11,712
<i>Others feel as though they may</i>
<i>be above the whole thing.</i>

32
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:15,087
<i>Everyone has to grow together</i>
<i>before this race begins.</i>

33
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:24,856
<i>The</i> Morning Light,
<i>although a true experience</i>

34
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:27,096
<i>for 15 young adults in Hawaii,</i>

35
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:30,071
<i>is also a very serious trial</i>
<i>to see if we can measure up.</i>

36
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:37,403
<i>We all wanted a chance to prove</i>
<i>ourselves, to race against the best.</i>

37
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>Once the race starts in California, all</i>
<i>that matters is the Diamond Head buoy.</i>

38
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:18,285
- Hey, Roy.
- Hey, come on in.

39
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:20,414
- Welcome to Hawaii.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:20,456 --> 00:04:22,856
First of all, there's 15 of you
here in the room,

41
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:26,225
and you know that only 11 of you
can go in the boat.

42
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:28,856
It's up to you to decide
who stays and who goes.

43
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:33,096
I just don't want you thinkin'
this is some kind of a game.

44
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:36,229
Right out the window there
is the Diamond Head buoy.

45
00:04:36,772 --> 00:04:41,072
That's the finish line
of a 2,500-mile open-ocean race.

46
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:45,437
It's dangerous out there.

47
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:49,673
One mistake could really
put your lives at risk.

48
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:54,281
I always tell my crew, if you fall
overboard, consider it a death sentence.

49
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:57,053
But we're gonna train you
to have a shot at winning,

50
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:59,891
and we're gonna train you
to be safe out there.

51
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:03,990
I just hope you'll understand
it's really about the journey.

52
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,661
I think it's gonna change
every one of your lives.

53
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:26,082
There you go, guys.
There's your weapon.

54
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,789
Sweet.

55
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:32,021
Oh, wow. That is unreal!

56
00:05:32,061 --> 00:05:35,519
- This is absurd!
- That's pretty sick.

57
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,934
That was a significant
event for the kids.

58
00:05:38,968 --> 00:05:41,630
Kind of like when
you give a kid the car keys.

59
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:46,438
We gave them the keys to this, you know,
stripped-out racing machine.

60
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:49,967
- Oh, sweet!
- Unreal.

61
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:52,776
<i>Morning Light</i> is a TP52.

62
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:55,443
It's a 52-foot boat
that's very fast for its size.

63
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:59,477
It was originally designed to be
perfectly suited for the Transpac.

64
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,658
It's gonna get really cozy.

65
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:10,962
<i> I've never done an ocean race</i>
<i>before, so I don't know that feeling</i>

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,265
<i>of being absolutely alone</i>
<i>in the middle of the ocean.</i>

67
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:17,830
My parents are both doctors.
I always figured I would be a doctor,

68
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,171
but I get queasy
at the sight of blood, so...

69
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:26,076
<i> I just really have a fire</i>
<i>in my heart to go and sail,</i>

70
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:29,243
<i>and my parents support</i>
<i>my sailing a hundred percent.</i>

71
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,244
<i>I've spent my whole life</i>
<i>sailing in dinghies.</i>

72
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,813
<i>Really, it's all the same as a dinghy.</i>

73
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:39,226
<i>Just more purchases, more power, and</i>
<i>more systems to get around the power.</i>

74
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,767
<i>It was the first day out</i>
<i>and I was on the wheel.</i>

75
00:06:46,802 --> 00:06:49,600
<i>I've been asked what it's like</i>
<i>to be a girl on this team.</i>

76
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:55,042
<i>I always say I have long hair and shave</i>
<i>my legs and that's the only difference.</i>

77
00:06:55,077 --> 00:06:59,013
<i>But at the end of the day, sometimes</i>
<i>I feel like I have more to prove.</i>

78
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:01,608
<i>I have to really show that I'm worth it.</i>

79
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,212
<i>It's such a big boat I'm like, "I can't</i>
<i>steer on these waves, " but I can.</i>

80
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,685
Yeah! Yeah!

81
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:18,289
I would hope that I could be the skipper
or the helmsman on board.

82
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:21,895
I think that I may be
qualified enough to do that,

83
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:25,100
but whoever it is will have
earned the spot and deserve it.

84
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:27,234
It's gonna be intense.

85
00:07:33,182 --> 00:07:35,912
<i>... Kalanianaole Highway from Kailua.</i>

86
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,851
<i>Waimanalo is clear across the Pali.</i>

87
00:07:37,887 --> 00:07:41,050
<i>Kamehameha to Kahe Ko'olau.</i>
<i>Looking good on the Likelike.</i>

88
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,251
<i>Your morning traffic,</i>
<i>I'm Danielle Tucker,</i>

89
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:46,261
<i>Hawaiian 105,</i>
<i>your Hawaiian music station.</i>

90
00:07:49,632 --> 00:07:51,930
I'm really cranky this morning.

91
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:55,661
Looks like you're struggling
to put the bread through.

92
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,634
Just so you know,
I like green eggs and ham.

93
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:01,734
OK, it's 6:30.

94
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:09,910
<i> My name is Graham</i>
<i>Brant-Zawadzki and this is my journal.</i>

95
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:13,912
<i>Our first week here</i>
<i>was brutal but awesome.</i>

96
00:08:13,956 --> 00:08:16,220
Good. Nice and quick, nice and quick.

97
00:08:16,258 --> 00:08:18,988
<i> Janelle, our trainer,</i>
<i>is rad, but she kicks our asses.</i>

98
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:22,964
And rest back on your right leg.
Overhead.

99
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:27,196
Stand on your right leg first.
Yeah, start on one side first.

100
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:30,797
OK. Quick on those toes.

101
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,298
Yeah.

102
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:37,801
<i> We've got to get in</i>
<i>better shape. This is a powerful boat</i>

103
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:40,782
<i>and sailing her is going</i>
<i>to be physically demanding.</i>

104
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,819
Whoo-hoo!

105
00:08:45,855 --> 00:08:49,018
We went through an extensive
safety-at-sea course

106
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:51,219
that's never been done in this country.

107
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,785
<i> Most of what</i>
<i>we learned was really cool.</i>

108
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,888
<i>Either it was totally new information,</i>

109
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,866
<i>or it took things most of us thought</i>
<i>we knew into greater depth.</i>

110
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:01,699
Should I wait or do it ahead?

111
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,810
The Coast Guard was hugely supportive,

112
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:13,246
and they actually
took a rescue helicopter out

113
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:15,182
and sent in a rescue swimmer.

114
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,218
<i> Swimmer in the water.</i>
<i>Swimmer in the water.</i>

115
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,959
<i> The experience showed</i>
<i>me how intense the situation can get,</i>

116
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:30,591
<i>even in a totally controlled</i>
<i>environment and calm sea state.</i>

117
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:35,498
<i>I think the most important</i>
<i>thing I learned is how much</i>

118
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:38,098
<i>I never, ever wanna be stuck</i>
<i>in a life raft.</i>

119
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,971
<i> Robbie Kane, January tenth.</i>

120
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:49,109
<i>I used to think</i>
<i>I was invincible on a boat.</i>

121
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:53,019
<i>I soon realized how stupid</i>
<i>it is to think that way.</i>

122
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:00,751
<i>The boat I helped run lost the bowman</i>
<i>overboard in the Block Island race.</i>

123
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:04,924
<i>His name was Jamie Boeckel.</i>

124
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:11,264
<i>Realizing that a pro of that level</i>
<i>died that easily really scared me.</i>

125
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:21,115
<i>To lose a life because someone isn't</i>
<i>trained in safety is just pathetic.</i>

126
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,255
I think they will be
the safest team out there.

127
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:31,385
But any time you leave the dock
and you go to sea, there's danger.

128
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,228
But whatever happens,
you will finish that race.

129
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:44,598
<i> By day two</i>
<i>of the race, we'll be so far offshore</i>

130
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,541
<i>there's not a helicopter</i>
<i>in the world that can save us.</i>

131
00:10:47,576 --> 00:10:52,070
<i>We are sailing by ourselves</i>
<i>across the Pacific Ocean.</i>

132
00:10:52,114 --> 00:10:54,912
Everyone on this boat needs
to be the best that they can be.

133
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,747
This is no joke.

134
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:02,048
We have to... Whoa!

135
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,888
<i> My navigational background,</i>

136
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:06,292
<i>being out at sea in the Middle East</i>
<i>for three months,</i>

137
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:07,989
<i>I think that's gonna help.</i>

138
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,056
All right, I'll check SailMail,
come up, talk to you and Stan.

139
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,124
I'll be up in a bit.

140
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:15,000
<i> I'm putting my life on hold</i>
<i>for a year to do this.</i>

141
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:18,529
<i>Some people at the Merchant Marine</i>
<i>Academy are not too happy about that.</i>

142
00:11:18,574 --> 00:11:21,008
I'm very, very, very lucky to be here.

143
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:24,342
Ready to jibe!
Jibing!

144
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:27,177
OK, main's out, main's out!

145
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:30,310
- Oh, no.
- It's not in yet.

146
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:32,286
Start pullin' big.
Big and hard.

147
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:33,618
- Ease back.
- Hold.

148
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:36,250
Uh, we might have to go
back on this one, boys.

149
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:39,261
Let's go back. Jibing back.

150
00:11:40,729 --> 00:11:43,562
Sheet it in really hard
to bring the nose down.

151
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,624
<i> Jeremy is a badass.</i>

152
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:48,159

when I used to get salt in my hair...

154
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:59,207
I used to have long hair but it wouldn't
go down. It used to just go straight up.

155
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:01,045
OK, stand by.

156
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,983
<i> I was born into sailing.</i>

157
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,748

Stacking the boat.

160
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,258
<i>So I have a lot of shoes to fill.</i>

161
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,590
Bring it on, guys.

162
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:16,724
When I get on a boat, I sort of...
I'm a bit of a control freak.

163
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,867
- Set that kite in.
- <i> Kit Will. Kit is rad.</i>

164
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:24,600
<i>He's really mellow, which I think</i>
<i>some people see as shy.</i>

165
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,406
<i>And I really hope that people will see</i>
<i>how valuable an asset he is to the team.</i>

166
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:31,675
Kit's invisible. You know,
he may be the first guy on the crew

167
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,705
that I would ask
to go on the ocean race,

168
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:36,013
'cause he has all the characteristics

169
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:38,713
- of a rock-solid offshore sailor.
- Trim.

170
00:12:38,754 --> 00:12:42,053
<i> I was about ten, telling</i>
<i>my parents I really loved sailing.</i>

171
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:44,924
<i>It's how I related to the world, really,</i>

172
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,952
<i>feeling like you're connected</i>
<i>to the wind through the sails.</i>

173
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:50,863
There's something about
that connection that's amazing.

174
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:54,460
It's a ratchet.
That is the key to every winch.

175
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:57,472
<i> We're gonna be out there</i>
<i>for maybe ten days, on our own,</i>

176
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,235
<i>If something breaks, we have to fix it.</i>

177
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:01,105
And chances are something will break.

178
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:04,112
So remember, you've gotta go
around the Pacific high.

179
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:06,774
In the center of the Pacific
high there's no wind at all.

180
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:09,249
If you go into the high,
you're gonna stop.

181
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:12,481
It was an interesting group.
They had dinghy experience,

182
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,613
they're plenty smart.

183
00:13:13,655 --> 00:13:16,351
That's correct.
That's your secondary fuel filter.

184
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:17,950
Right on. You got it.

185
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:21,451
But, in fact, none of this crew had,
you know, crossed an ocean.

186
00:13:23,332 --> 00:13:25,129
- Whoo!
- Nice!

187
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:29,365
You get right, run your sail.

188
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:36,570
<i> Steve has enormous potential</i>
<i>as a sailor,</i>

189
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,773
<i>and the least amount of experience.</i>

190
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:42,683
<i> I don't think</i>
<i>I'm the least experienced.</i>

191
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:45,243
<i>Person who has been sailing</i>
<i>least is Graham, two years,</i>

192
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,983
<i>and I think I'm next in line</i>
<i>with three years.</i>

193
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:55,630
Do you know what it's like
to go in the water with your clothes on?

194
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,825
Well, that's what's gonna happen today.

195
00:13:57,866 --> 00:14:01,029
You're gonna wear your shoes
and you're gonna wear what you have on.

196
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:04,527
So you're gonna swim down
to that end, come back here,

197
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,269
and you're gonna tread water
for five minutes.

198
00:14:20,322 --> 00:14:23,655
<i> I had a hard time doing</i>
<i>the swim test back in California.</i>

199
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:27,154
<i>I was very nervous.</i>

200
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:34,264
- Keep coming.
- Almost there.

201
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:35,895
You're almost there.

202
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:49,940
You're almost there.

203
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:51,680
Help him, help him.

204
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,123
OK, guys. Out of the pool.
Nice job, everybody.

205
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:11,332
<i> It is really emotional for me.</i>
<i>My mother passed recently.</i>

206
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:14,274
<i>She passed in February this year.</i>

207
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,573
You're gonna go home
to Baltimore.

208
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,136
You're gonna learn how to swim

209
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,444
'cause when you get to Hawaii,
you better be ready...

210
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,506
Holy...

211
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,646
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

212
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:29,818
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. Very serious.

213
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:31,849
Oh, my God. Oh...

214
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:34,590
<i> First thing I thought of</i>
<i>was my mother.</i>

215
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,432
I don't know. I just know
she's proud of me, man.

216
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:48,306
Ah...

217
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:52,712
<i> You only get</i>
<i>certain opportunities in life,</i>

218
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:57,412
<i>and if you don't hop on 'em,</i>
<i>they'll go like that.</i>

219
00:15:57,452 --> 00:15:59,886
<i>I live with my sister,</i>
<i>and my nieces and nephews.</i>

220
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,618
<i>I don't even grasp the whole concept of,</i>
<i>you know, like,</i>

221
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:04,023
<i>sailing through the ocean,</i>

222
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:07,051
<i>and I'm quite sure that</i>
<i>they probably don't either.</i>

223
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,791
<i>I think they do have, somewhat,</i>
<i>a fear for me, you know.</i>

224
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:12,698
Could be a chance that, you
know, I might not make it back.

225
00:16:16,972 --> 00:16:20,601
So what we're gonna do is, we're gonna
sail upwind, we're gonna set a kite.

226
00:16:20,642 --> 00:16:24,169
We're gonna have six people on deck. The
rest are gonna be down in your bunks,

227
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:27,613
and we're gonna simulate
a man overboard with a kite up.

228
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:31,714
Steve's gonna jump over the side.
He very nicely volunteered.

229
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:39,193
<i> January 21st.</i>
<i>I think the best way to overcome fear</i>

230
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:40,785
<i>is to face it head-on.</i>

231
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:52,306
Anytime, Steve.

232
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:54,002
Go, buddy.

233
00:16:55,043 --> 00:16:57,739
- Help!
- Man overboard!

234
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,606
Pointing, pointing.
Got him. Got him.

235
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,448
Pull him along, right?
I got him.

236
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,716
- Don't look back.
- Still have him?

237
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:09,690
<i> You hit the water,</i>
<i>it takes five seconds to come up.</i>

238
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,285
<i>Then you see the boat,</i>
<i>and it's like a half a mile away.</i>

239
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:13,851
OK, kite down.

240
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:16,193
<i> In good breeze,</i>
<i>every second counts,</i>

241
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:19,428
<i>especially when you're hauling ass</i>
<i>doing 18 knots with the kite up.</i>

242
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:21,527
Wait. What are you doing?

243
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,834
<i> It's not like you can</i>
<i>pull the hand brake</i>

244
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:25,305
<i>and spin the boat on a dime.</i>

245
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:35,215
OK, gotcha.

246
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,218
Hold on, hold on.
You need...

247
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,413
Come on, guys. Main in.

248
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:42,355
- He's out of sight.
- I got ya. He's right here.

249
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:50,025
Come on. Turn!

250
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:52,499
Here it comes!

251
00:17:52,534 --> 00:17:55,526
All right, two big guys,
we're gonna pick him up.

252
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:59,469
Off our bow.

253
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:08,142
- Throw him a line!
- Gotta be long.

254
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,626
- Welcome back, man.
- Good job!

255
00:18:20,662 --> 00:18:22,789
Yeah!

256
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,799
<i> All I remember</i>

257
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,324
<i>is feeling a sense of</i>
<i>accomplishment as a group</i>

258
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:29,599
<i>that we got Steve back on that boat,</i>

259
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:32,038
<i>and that he had conquered</i>
<i>a big hurdle in his life.</i>

260
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:40,913
<i>In a real race,</i>
<i>at night, in bad weather,</i>

261
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:45,010
<i>that training exercise</i>
<i>will always be in the back of my head.</i>

262
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:48,889
I thought we got back there
pretty quickly.

263
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:51,017
Definitely, like,
you realize how quickly

264
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,993
you get away from somebody
with a chute up.

265
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:56,464
So, you were pointin' at the ring,
right? But she still couldn't see me?

266
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:59,797
I mean, I could see a little bit
of fleck on the top of a wave.

267
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:01,393
But you went out of sight,

268
00:19:01,436 --> 00:19:03,631
- I wanna say a minute. Not even.
- Wow.

269
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:08,234
<i> We're a team of 15.</i>
<i>Every single person deserves to race.</i>

270
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:10,301
<i>We can't all go. Only 11.</i>

271
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:15,248
<i> We as a team will be picking</i>
<i>the four who stay behind.</i>

272
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:20,380
<i>As the youngest team member, this has</i>
<i>been extremely nerve-racking for me.</i>

273
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,656
Bring me back in, Chris.

274
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:29,687
Guys, I'd like to practice
some jibes, if we got the time.

275
00:19:29,731 --> 00:19:32,894
- Let's pre-check.
- We're gonna go real slow.

276
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:36,028
All right, clear to jibe.
Jibing.

277
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:40,508
<i> Jibes are the turns that you</i>
<i>have to do in order to get downwind,</i>

278
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:43,170
<i>because the boat can't sail</i>
<i>directly downwind.</i>

279
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,907
<i>So instead you sail</i>
<i>40 degrees one way,</i>

280
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:51,579
<i>turn, or you jibe, and then you sail 40</i>
<i>degrees off the wind the other way.</i>

281
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,712
<i>Tacks are similar.</i>

282
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:55,780
<i>Tacks are the turns that you have to do</i>
<i>when you're going upwind.</i>

283
00:19:55,824 --> 00:19:58,384
OK, we're sailing again.

284
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:02,157
Sailing's always been
a complex sport. It's not that simple.

285
00:20:02,197 --> 00:20:04,688
I mean, you could
stay in it for a lifetime

286
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:08,794
and never have it completely
figured out or perfected.

287
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,704
What is that?
Push it a little!

288
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,476
Little bit too wimpy.

289
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,206
<i>P.S., whoever said big boats are</i>

290
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:21,181
<i>just like dinghies is full of it.</i>

291
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:25,380
<i>Screwups, kites in the water,</i>
<i>kites exploding.</i>

292
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,548
<i>We need to sort</i>
<i>these issues out ourselves</i>

293
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,024
<i>and learn to deal with them</i>
<i>before this race begins.</i>

294
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,118
- Oops!
- Don't tear it!

295
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:36,494
Without a team being totally focused
in one positive direction,

296
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:38,192
you're not gonna be successful.

297
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,133
First aid kit? Stocked.

298
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,602
Paper towels? Check.
Toilet paper? Check.

299
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:44,764
Coffee? Check. Soap?

300
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:49,175
Just make darn sure
we've got enough life jackets.

301
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:53,443
We wanted the kids to be very familiar
with finishing a Transpac race.

302
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:56,450
So we had them sail over to Molokai,

303
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:59,920
down the Molokai Channel
and then come into Diamond Head.

304
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:02,981
OK. Let's go. You guys ready?

305
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:06,983
We had sent them off overnight
by themselves completely.

306
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:16,293
Let's finish this race up
and get outta here!

307
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,403
<i> My first overnight.</i>

308
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:30,944
<i>It was scary, wet, there was</i>
<i>a lot of awkward flailing,</i>

309
00:21:30,986 --> 00:21:34,149
<i>and I passed out</i>
<i>before we finished.</i>

310
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:38,825
<i>A few other kids just</i>
<i>puked the whole time.</i>

311
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:42,595
<i>That trip seriously</i>
<i>took it out of the whole team,</i>

312
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:45,065
<i>and that was just</i>
<i>over 24 hours.</i>

313
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,729
<i>We were sloppy</i>
<i>and out of shape.</i>

314
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,228
<i> They'd show up with the boat</i>
<i>trashed. You know, everything a mess.</i>

315
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:55,801
They hadn't really taken on, you know,
this offshore seamanship.

316
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,835
And they weren't
in any kind of condition

317
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,279
to be able to continue sailing
the way you have to

318
00:22:00,315 --> 00:22:03,478
when you cross an ocean.

319
00:22:03,518 --> 00:22:06,578
<i> At the current pace</i>
<i>we will not be ready.</i>

320
00:22:08,223 --> 00:22:11,420
<i>We're beginning to realize</i>
<i>the need to push ourselves harder.</i>

321
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:14,155
If we're gonna have these coaches,
let's not waste them.

322
00:22:14,195 --> 00:22:16,026
Let's use them to their full...

323
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,827
Even if you think it's obvious.

324
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:20,460
It could be something
that's obvious, but...

325
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:23,335
...half of us wouldn't know,
the people that do don't care.

326
00:22:23,371 --> 00:22:25,066
The best thing is...

327
00:22:25,106 --> 00:22:29,634
<i> Everything hinges</i>
<i>on the skipper and the leader.</i>

328
00:22:29,678 --> 00:22:32,647
<i>On an hourly basis, they will decide</i>
<i>our fate on the</i> Morning Light.

329
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:35,479
I want to say one thing for, um, Genny.

330
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:39,078
'Cause there's been a lot of times
where we've been hanging out as a group,

331
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,987
and if Genny says,
"Hey, we need to be there now,"

332
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:44,548
everyone's like, picks up
their bags and we go.

333
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:48,619
Her organization definitely keeps us all
together. I definitely agree with that.

334
00:22:48,663 --> 00:22:51,655
<i> The way to get good</i>
<i>at making those decisions</i>

335
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,826
<i>is to be placed in them.</i>

336
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:56,394
Who's gonna go in to shore?
Are we ready?

337
00:22:56,438 --> 00:23:00,306
Yeah. I got it blowing.
Blow it! Yeah!

338
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:06,047
Mike Sanderson, who just won
the around-the-world race,

339
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:08,572
he came in for a week to train the kids.

340
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:11,141
<i> The second that Moose</i>
<i>stepped on the boat,</i>

341
00:23:11,186 --> 00:23:12,949
<i>we realized how unprepared we were,</i>

342
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:15,752
<i>how much we had to learn,</i>
<i>and how much he could teach us.</i>

343
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,384
Faster, faster, faster,
faster, faster. Let it go.

344
00:23:22,864 --> 00:23:26,766
They're not rock stars yet. You know,
they're not professional sailors.

345
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:27,961
Pull back.

346
00:23:28,003 --> 00:23:31,598
<i> We need to prove to</i>
<i>ourselves that we can sail this boat.</i>

347
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:34,665
You're controlling the thing.
You call, all right?

348
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:37,542
One minute, Towiller,
keep talking to me.

349
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:40,776
Yeah, and smoke it. Smoke it.

350
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:42,942
Nice one.
Basic dilemma. Yeah, baby.

351
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:46,385
Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming,
keep coming, keep coming.

352
00:23:47,022 --> 00:23:48,046
Go, Jeremy.

353
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,927
<i> I had never been</i>
<i>part of a team</i>

354
00:23:52,961 --> 00:23:54,861
<i>that wants it more than</i> Morning Light.

355
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:59,866
<i>I've raced in five countries,</i>
<i>endless practices on all types of boats</i>

356
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:04,634
<i>and this was my favorite day</i>
<i>of sailing I've ever had.</i>

357
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:24,290
<i> I wish, at least,</i>
<i>it was a good story.</i>

358
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:27,351
<i>I wish I could say I'd jumped</i>
<i>off a cliff into the shallows</i>

359
00:24:28,129 --> 00:24:30,757
<i>or was attacked by a shark</i>
<i>while kite-surfing.</i>

360
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,996
<i>Something really fun and off-the-wall.</i>

361
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:39,830
She didn't take our advice. She went off
snowboarding between sessions.

362
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:41,933
I said, "You sure
you wanna do that, Genny?"

363
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:45,139
And she said, "Oh, don't worry,
Robbie. I'll be fine."

364
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:51,147
<i> I sat down and cried.</i>

365
00:24:51,186 --> 00:24:53,347
<i>All I knew was that it hurt,</i>

366
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:58,655
<i>and the major implications</i>
<i>of having broken myself.</i>

367
00:24:58,693 --> 00:25:01,457
We wanted the kids
to go offshore for three days.

368
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:03,964
Then they would meet us in Hilo.

369
00:25:03,998 --> 00:25:08,094
She wanted to participate
a lot more than we allowed her to.

370
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:10,434
In fact, we didn't allow her
to do anything.

371
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:15,402
Good luck!

372
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:17,673
<i> Disappointment.</i>

373
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:19,907
<i>Frustration. Loneliness.</i>

374
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:22,917
- Bye, guys!
- Bye!

375
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:37,097
<i> We are now at the stage where</i>
<i>we can sail 24-hour overnight sprints.</i>

376
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:41,364
<i>However, our race</i>
<i>can be up to ten days long.</i>

377
00:25:41,402 --> 00:25:43,802
<i>The Hilo trip will help us</i>
<i>get into a rhythm</i>

378
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:46,705
<i>of racing at sea</i>
<i>for several days at a time.</i>

379
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,305
<i> Everyone gets seasick.</i>

380
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,342
<i>I don't care if you've sailed</i>
<i>around the world, everyone does.</i>

381
00:25:58,386 --> 00:26:02,755
<i>You're just so uncomfortable.</i>
<i>Your bones ache, you can't think,</i>

382
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,348
<i>you wanna just die.</i>

383
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:05,950
Ah!

384
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:07,621
I'm gonna give you...

385
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:09,823
<i> Down below it's hot,</i>

386
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:12,856
<i>it's humid, it's wet, it smells.</i>

387
00:26:12,901 --> 00:26:15,665
<i>For a navigator who's trying</i>
<i>to stare at a computer,</i>

388
00:26:15,703 --> 00:26:17,364
<i>and you're banging in the waves,</i>

389
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:21,239
<i>I don't care how tough you are,</i>
<i>you're gonna get sick.</i>

390
00:26:27,782 --> 00:26:30,080
<i> We kept the boat</i>
<i>in solid condition</i>

391
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:32,814
<i>throughout three days</i>
<i>of extreme upwind sailing.</i>

392
00:26:33,888 --> 00:26:36,686
<i>My stress level was at an all-time high.</i>

393
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:39,090
It sucks being here!

394
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:42,790
<i> They showed up in Hilo</i>
<i>after an absolutely heinous trip.</i>

395
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:46,630
And beating in 30 to 40 knots
in horrible seas.

396
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:50,160
<i>Oh, and the boat's in perfect shape.</i>
<i>Everything's neat as a pin.</i>

397
00:26:52,006 --> 00:26:53,769
Hey, Genny.

398
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:55,605
- You guys miss me?
- Mm-hmm.

399
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,578
It was probably good
you didn't come, on a serious note.

400
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:00,308
It was... it was rough.

401
00:27:00,348 --> 00:27:02,612
- Did people fall over?
- A lot of people yakked.

402
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,776
Never going downwind.

403
00:27:03,818 --> 00:27:05,581
<i>My hands are swollen and sore.</i>

404
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,783
<i>My fingers are bent in</i>
<i>from holding on to sheets for so long.</i>

405
00:27:08,823 --> 00:27:12,054
<i>My legs are weak,</i>
<i>and my cuts are infected.</i>

406
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:14,823
I was like, "This is
ridiculous. Not doing anything..."

407
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:18,628
<i> When I landed in Hilo,</i>
<i>I felt like I'd climbed a mountain</i>

408
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:21,191
<i>or broke through a wall.</i>

409
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,637
<i> The team's progressing,</i>
<i>and I'm just stagnant.</i>

410
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:41,110
<i> The way back from Hilo</i>
<i>is an opportunity for downwind sailing.</i>

411
00:27:42,757 --> 00:27:46,921
<i>It'll be a good test</i>
<i>because the Transpac is all downwind.</i>

412
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:49,759
It was perfect conditions.
It was all night long.

413
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:54,166
You know, hairball sailing
the whole way. You know, 30, 35 knots.

414
00:27:54,202 --> 00:27:55,794
And it was just wild.

415
00:28:01,242 --> 00:28:03,506
It was perfect practice
for the kids.

416
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,978
We took 'em just down
the north side of Molokai

417
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,982
and on in through the Molokai Channel,

418
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:10,450
just like the finish for the Transpac.

419
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:36,801
<i> I know I've probably ruined</i>
<i>my chances of being the skipper.</i>

420
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:39,472
<i>Now I just have to hope</i>
<i>I'll still make the race.</i>

421
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:56,961
<i> Genny's a great sailor</i>
<i>and won't have any trouble</i>

422
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:59,489
<i>getting back to sailing the boat</i>
<i>when she recovers.</i>

423
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:01,331
<i>I don't think she should be punished,</i>

424
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:04,133
<i>because having to miss out</i>
<i>on all the sailing this session</i>

425
00:29:04,172 --> 00:29:06,333
<i>is way more punishment</i>
<i>than anyone deserves.</i>

426
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,342
<i>So, yeah, it sucks all around.</i>

427
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:15,305
By the end of it, the kids
were pretty comfortable

428
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,217
with sailing their boat
in a ton of breeze, and it was clear

429
00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:21,847
that they were gonna
come into it saying, "Bring it on."

430
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:35,634
<i>There was one thing</i>
<i>they weren't quite ready for:</i>

431
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,264
<i>Picking the 11</i>
<i>who would sail the race.</i>

432
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:43,210
I just think that we should
maybe see who wants to be a skipper,

433
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:46,407
as opposed to throwing everybody out
and having a random discussion.

434
00:29:46,447 --> 00:29:49,814
Maybe just put your hand up if you want
to be a skipper, I don't know.

435
00:29:49,851 --> 00:29:51,785
Raise your hand
if you wanna be a skipper.

436
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:56,547
<i> The skipper is the ultimate</i>
<i>leader, the final decision maker,</i>

437
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:58,752
<i>the top in the hierarchy of control.</i>

438
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:01,762
Uh, to start off, just with the past
few passages, um...

439
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:05,732
Just Jeremy, uh, the way he puts
everything, is very professional.

440
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,895
So Jeremy is definitely my vote.

441
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:12,463
I have complete confidence
in Jeremy as the skipper.

442
00:30:12,507 --> 00:30:14,099
Troll, hands down.

443
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:15,507
Yeah, Troll.
Troll, yeah.

444
00:30:15,543 --> 00:30:17,909
Aussie's got my vote, too.

445
00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:21,176
Uh, Troll...

446
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,850
I definitely want you to be the skipper

447
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:27,184
because the crap you say
when...... goes wrong

448
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,916
is just so funny.

449
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:31,322
It's funny. So, I mean, I think, like...

450
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,759
<i> I didn't expect</i>
<i>the decision to be unanimous.</i>

451
00:30:33,795 --> 00:30:36,457
I'm just gonna say it.
I love sailing with all of you guys.

452
00:30:36,497 --> 00:30:39,057
I-I respect every one of you so much.

453
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,797
And it would be a huge honor...

454
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:46,170
<i> I feel like, when the decision</i>
<i>was made, I aged ten years.</i>

455
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:50,166
<i> We had lived, sailed,</i>
<i>and partied together for four months.</i>

456
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:53,305
<i>That made this process that much harder.</i>

457
00:30:53,347 --> 00:30:55,611
<i> After Jeremy</i>
<i>was selected as the skipper,</i>

458
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,084
<i>he elected to consult with Piet.</i>

459
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:01,054
So here's the first question.

460
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:03,522
<i> The two of them</i>
<i>began bringing in</i>

461
00:31:03,558 --> 00:31:05,082
<i>chosen team members one by one.</i>

462
00:31:05,126 --> 00:31:08,027
<i>I can't describe how stressful it was.</i>

463
00:31:08,062 --> 00:31:11,554
Two watch captains
would be you and Schubert.

464
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,534
<i>Underneath the skipper</i>
<i>are the watch captains.</i>

465
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:17,367
<i>They are essentially</i>
<i>the skipper of their watch.</i>

466
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:21,699
<i>Not only was I not a key player,</i>

467
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,642
<i>I was now sitting, sweating,</i>

468
00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:25,578
<i>hoping just to still make the team.</i>

469
00:31:30,852 --> 00:31:33,719
<i> Every person</i>
<i>on this team deserves to race.</i>

470
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,985
<i>Even if I am lucky enough</i>
<i>to actually go on the race,</i>

471
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:39,185
<i>it would be hard for me to know</i>
<i>that I'd be taking the place</i>

472
00:31:39,227 --> 00:31:42,162
<i>of someone else</i>
<i>who absolutely deserved to go.</i>

473
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:45,222
Graham doesn't have
a lot of hours sailing.

474
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:48,758
If we choose him, we'll have to put
a lot of hours into him.

475
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:50,100
Mm-hmm.

476
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:53,368
Right, Robbie knows his bow team.

477
00:31:53,407 --> 00:31:56,672
He knows who he wants to get backed up.
We need him in here for this decision.

478
00:31:56,711 --> 00:31:58,872
How long do you
think this is gonna take tonight?

479
00:31:58,913 --> 00:32:01,541
- Hours.
- When did we start?

480
00:32:01,582 --> 00:32:03,812
- I think it's going quick.
- Yeah.

481
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:06,081
- Seven-thirty-ish?
- It's 9:10 now.

482
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,055
Turtle, you've gotta be here
because you...

483
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,888
That's... It's the front of your boat
and we gotta know...

484
00:32:11,926 --> 00:32:14,895
<i>Robbie Kane was next to go in,</i>
<i>and then Jesse made it.</i>

485
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:18,296
We, uh... We want you on the boat
for the Transpac.

486
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:20,664
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine, dude.

487
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:22,225
I'm focused in, man.

488
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:26,767
<i> Towiller got called in,</i>
<i>and that left four spots,</i>

489
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:28,741
<i>with eight of us still waiting.</i>

490
00:32:28,776 --> 00:32:31,267
We think
you got a great personality.

491
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:33,542
We think you're very focused.

492
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:36,311
And you can drive a boat very nicely.

493
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,374
Thanks.

494
00:32:38,553 --> 00:32:40,748
We've kept her
out of here for a reason.

495
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:44,583
We can't hold her back.
She's on our boat.

496
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,718
Come on, you injured soldier.

497
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:50,626
<i> The relief on my face</i>
<i>must have been palpable.</i>

498
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:52,132
<i>They still wanted me.</i>

499
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:54,293
We expect you to heal,
not break any more arms.

500
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:56,132
- No more skiing, snowboarding.
- No more skiing.

501
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:58,662
<i>Chris Welch followed Genny.</i>

502
00:32:58,706 --> 00:33:00,333
Awesome. I'm in.

503
00:33:00,374 --> 00:33:02,137
Sign me up!

504
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:04,508
- Do you want to... Yeah?
- Oh, yeah! Yeah!

505
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,775
<i>And finally Branning was called in.</i>

506
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:11,413
- How is it out there?
- Quiet.

507
00:33:15,723 --> 00:33:18,954
<i> Five of us were left in</i>
<i>the kitchen waiting for one more spot.</i>

508
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:25,495
OK, guys, everyone else.
OK, guys.

509
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,025
So, we brought you all in.

510
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,100
At the end of the day,
we all are the...

511
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:36,337
Still the team, like I said.
But, um...

512
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:39,346
For this race, uh,
w-we want to take Graham on the boat

513
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,283
just because we think, uh,
his strengths that offer us

514
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:46,411
match what we're missing on the boat.

515
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:49,856
Um, I think it's awesome

516
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,189
that Graham has been sailing for,
like... two years, right?

517
00:33:53,227 --> 00:33:57,323
And, like, to see him,
like, just skyrocket,

518
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:59,663
he'd be on this level...
I think that's really awesome

519
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,531
that you guys can see his improvement.

520
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:07,000
<i> It's almost impossible</i>
<i>to explain how unhappy I was.</i>

521
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:10,800
<i>I wanted to call a cab,</i>
<i>go to the airport,</i>

522
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,836
<i>fly standby out of that place.</i>

523
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,974
If I didn't think, like, the weight
would slow us down that much,

524
00:34:16,017 --> 00:34:18,815
I'd throw another life raft on the boat.

525
00:34:18,853 --> 00:34:22,118
But you know this was gonna happen
since the start.

526
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:28,756
<i> I didn't understand</i>
<i>Jeremy's choice at the time.</i>

527
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,061
<i>I don't think I ever will.</i>

528
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:38,304
OK, here's our wave.
Easing into it!

529
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,939
Didn't see that comin'.

530
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:47,379
Get the spinnaker ready!

531
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:50,483
<i> Eleven spots on the boat</i>
<i>for the race.</i>

532
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:54,282
<i>The other four will be alternates.</i>

533
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:57,449
<i>They have to be ready to go</i>
<i>in case someone gets hurt.</i>

534
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,020
<i> The next day, I went out</i>
<i>on the water with something to prove.</i>

535
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:04,122
OK, transfer!

536
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:06,258
<i> And I did some of</i>
<i>the best sailing that day.</i>

537
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,530
<i>Probably the best sailing</i>
<i>of my entire life.</i>

538
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:11,936
Ooh! Nice one, guys.

539
00:35:11,972 --> 00:35:14,133
Here we go.

540
00:35:18,646 --> 00:35:20,477
Help me, now.

541
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:25,250
Kit is just the sort of person
you want offshore.

542
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:26,810
You know, eyes open, mouth shut,

543
00:35:26,854 --> 00:35:29,948
and totally responsible and committed.

544
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,017
And I was astonished when he wasn't
selected by the kids for their team.

545
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:41,594
<i> Kit's like that silent guy</i>
<i>on the boat.</i>

546
00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:44,934
<i>You never really notice him</i>
<i>until you're forced to.</i>

547
00:35:44,972 --> 00:35:46,940
<i>He never has a problem.</i>
<i>He does his job.</i>

548
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:49,306
<i>He does it so efficiently,</i>
<i>you don't notice him.</i>

549
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:51,834
<i>So he's the type of guy</i>
<i>who can just slip through.</i>

550
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:54,712
- Ready on take-in.
- Clear on the halyard! Jibe!

551
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,912
<i> Graham's team spirit</i>
<i>is just incredible.</i>

552
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,854
<i>It's so vital to the team.</i>

553
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,915
<i> We have the team</i>
<i>we are going to have.</i>

554
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,259
<i>And although it is not perfect,</i>
<i>nothing ever is in this world.</i>

555
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:12,993
Good jibe, guys! Good jibe on
the main. Good jibe on the sheet.

556
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:18,069
Hook down.

557
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,673
<i>After four months in Hawaii,</i>

558
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:26,544
<i>we packed up the boat</i>
<i>and headed back to the mainland.</i>

559
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:47,030
<i> By the time the boat was</i>
<i>set up in California, my cast was off.</i>

560
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:50,059
<i>My arm was a little weak,</i>
<i>but I was ready to go.</i>

561
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:56,607
Bear food.

562
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:00,846
There's another TP52,

563
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:03,907
brand-new boat, <i>Samba Pa Ti.</i>

564
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:09,178
It's a team of very,
very highly trained professionals.

565
00:37:11,025 --> 00:37:13,585
<i>Samba's</i> gonna be
their toughest competition.

566
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:17,063
<i> They've sailed</i>
<i>more miles than I have on my used car.</i>

567
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:18,530
<i>That's a lot of miles.</i>

568
00:37:20,167 --> 00:37:22,829
These boats are powerful.
They're only 52 feet long,

569
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,667
but they go a lot faster than the sleds

570
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:27,173
and the maxi boats of the '70s or '80s.

571
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,233
Uh, we feel very confident in the ocean.

572
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:31,244
That's where we...
a lot of us grew up.

573
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:35,681
Samba <i>represents a lot</i>
<i>of veteran ocean-racing experience.</i>

574
00:37:35,716 --> 00:37:40,016
<i>We'll have to navigate better,</i>
<i>and we'll have to sail the boat harder.</i>

575
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:42,545
If it's breezy,
and if you have big seas,

576
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:46,356
you're gonna have to be a crew that, uh,
can handle a boat in the open ocean.

577
00:37:46,393 --> 00:37:49,260
And for inexperienced people,
that's a big challenge.

578
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:55,964
<i> Just days before the race,</i>
<i>we got a surprise.</i>

579
00:37:57,338 --> 00:37:58,862
Hey, BZ, you got a minute?

580
00:37:58,906 --> 00:38:02,808
<i> I didn't know if I should</i>
<i>do it, or how I should do it.</i>

581
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:06,677
<i>It was the hardest thing</i>
<i>I've ever had to do in my life.</i>

582
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:13,909
OK, guys, pretty much there's just been
some thoughts going through my head.

583
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:17,823
You know, you knew when you,
uh, made me skipper,

584
00:38:17,858 --> 00:38:21,487
if I see a way to get there
any faster or...

585
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:23,257
...you know...

586
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:27,930
So I've, uh, made a change to the crew.

587
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:31,062
And, um, BZ's now...

588
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:33,437
Uh, now alternate.

589
00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:36,238
And, uh, Kit's gonna be
coming on the boat.

590
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:40,509
It's... It's, uh... I don't know,
it's pretty tough.

591
00:38:40,547 --> 00:38:43,107
I just want to say I think
it's the right thing to do.

592
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,086
I think Kit deserved it.
And he's an awesome sailor, so...

593
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,146
You guys are better off with him.

594
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:52,491
That was why we chose you, man.

595
00:38:52,526 --> 00:38:54,357
You're an amazing team player.

596
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,160
We're gonna miss you.

597
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:04,596
It's like breaking up
with your girlfriend.

598
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:07,129
I know. I'm waiting for
the slap...

599
00:39:09,877 --> 00:39:12,607
Graham's a bit more tasteful
than the girls I go out with.

600
00:39:12,646 --> 00:39:15,114
That's for sure.

601
00:39:18,218 --> 00:39:22,052
<i> We had come to the end</i>
<i>of a long, intense six months.</i>

602
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:24,990
<i>The night before the race,</i>
<i>we got a really nice surprise.</i>

603
00:39:25,826 --> 00:39:27,987
Dim the lights.

604
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:35,297
- Very cool.
- That's awesome.

605
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:39,204
<i> I think everyone was on</i>
<i>edge in terms of anticipation.</i>

606
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,173
<i>There was a lot</i>
<i>of energy in the room.</i>

607
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,010
Oh, my God!

608
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,020
Ah!

609
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:04,724
Yeah!

610
00:40:07,668 --> 00:40:11,502
<i> Mark,</i>
<i>we're so very, very proud of you.</i>

611
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:14,905
<i>We always knew that you would be</i>
<i>sailing home one day.</i>

612
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:17,570
<i>Good luck, and enjoy the ride.</i>

613
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:20,546
<i>Genny girl, there have been Tullochs</i>
<i>on the Pacific Ocean before.</i>

614
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:23,675
<i>Your grandfather sailed</i>
<i>square riggers there</i>

615
00:40:23,717 --> 00:40:26,049
<i>more than 150 years ago.</i>

616
00:40:26,086 --> 00:40:30,580
<i>And now it's another Tulloch crossing</i>
<i>the Pacific Ocean, this time on a race.</i>

617
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:33,957
<i>We hope you have fun.</i>
<i>We hope you make lots of friends.</i>

618
00:40:33,994 --> 00:40:36,963
<i>And make sure you don't hit</i>
<i>any whales on the way over.</i>

619
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:38,157
<i>Take care and good luck.</i>

620
00:40:38,198 --> 00:40:40,564
<i> Everyone</i>
<i>was happy to hear from their families.</i>

621
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:42,466
- <i> Hi, Christopher.</i>
- Oh, Mom.

622
00:40:42,503 --> 00:40:44,471
<i>I'm very happy</i>
<i>and excited for you...</i>

623
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:46,769
<i>They are the root of who we are.</i>

624
00:40:46,807 --> 00:40:49,173
<i>We love you from</i>
<i>the bottom of our hearts.</i>

625
00:40:49,209 --> 00:40:51,643
<i>And, as your father would say,</i>

626
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:55,045
<i>sail fast and stay on course.</i>

627
00:40:55,082 --> 00:40:58,245
<i>Well, Robbie,</i>
<i>beyond "good luck," be careful.</i>

628
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:00,685
<i>Uh, like any parent, re...</i>
<i>be real careful.</i>

629
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:04,088
<i> There was a common</i>
<i>message of being safe, sailing fast,</i>

630
00:41:04,124 --> 00:41:06,558
<i>and giving it all we can.</i>

631
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,424
<i>Enjoy every minute of it.</i>

632
00:41:08,462 --> 00:41:11,431
<i>And, uh, just give 'em hell.</i>

633
00:41:11,465 --> 00:41:14,730
<i>Jesse MacGowan Baker</i>
<i>Ferguson Fielding... </i>

634
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:18,431
<i>... you and your mom were so close,</i>
<i>you shared a birthday.</i>

635
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,030
<i>And you had one more birthday...</i>

636
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:22,907
<i> It was reassuring.</i>
<i>But I don't need a reminder</i>

637
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:24,968
<i>that my mom is with me on a daily basis.</i>

638
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:28,574
<i>She wrote to you:</i>

639
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:31,982
<i>"Think you can, believe you can,</i>

640
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,748
<i>and you will.</i>

641
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:36,688
<i>Your mother. September '97. "

642
00:41:37,958 --> 00:41:40,654
<i> I don't normally like to</i>
<i>share that side with people...</i>

643
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,725
<i>... but in this case it felt right.</i>

644
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:47,666
<i>Good luck, Jesse.</i>
<i>Uh, I hope you have a good time</i>

645
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:50,727
<i>and that you ask 'em</i>
<i>if I should get a haircut.</i>

646
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:56,969
<i>I'll see you when you get there.</i>

647
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,377
<i>Hope you have some good stories.</i>
<i>Uh... good luck.</i>

648
00:42:08,122 --> 00:42:10,955
<i>Now leaving</i>
<i>Rainbow Harbor:</i> Skylark,

649
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:14,427
<i>the Santa Cruz 70 out of</i>
<i>Newport Beach, California.</i>

650
00:42:14,461 --> 00:42:18,420
<i>Godspeed,</i> Skylark.
<i>And aloha!</i>

651
00:42:18,465 --> 00:42:22,834
<i>That dock was crawling with guys</i>
<i>we've all read about or heard about.</i>

652
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:24,838
<i>It's like getting</i>
<i>to hit a bucket of balls</i>

653
00:42:24,872 --> 00:42:26,965
<i>on the same driving range</i>
<i>as Tiger Woods.</i>

654
00:42:28,342 --> 00:42:30,708
<i>We've had our sights set</i>
<i>on trying to beat</i> Samba.

655
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:33,235
<i>But we are the underdogs.</i>

656
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,306
<i> Next boat leaving,</i>
Samba Pa Ti.

657
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:45,382
<i> I'm sick of practicing</i>
<i>and preparing. I'm chomping at the bit.</i>

658
00:42:45,425 --> 00:42:47,916
<i>Hawaii's closer than we think,</i>
<i>so it'll be important</i>

659
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:49,519
<i>to push 100 percent all the time.</i>

660
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:51,588
OK, Chris.
Thanks for your help.

661
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,862
- We'll wait for you.
- Can I have a hug?

662
00:42:57,905 --> 00:42:59,429
- Ahh!
- Bring it in.

663
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:02,937
All right.

664
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:09,413
Let's do this.

665
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,882
Next up, a boat you've been
reading about just a little bit,

666
00:43:15,923 --> 00:43:18,084
<i>Morning Light!</i>

667
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:22,561
Go! Yay!

668
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:27,226
Godspeed, <i>Morning Light.</i>
And aloha!

669
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:31,169
<i> It's pretty powerful</i>
<i>to realize this boat</i>

670
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:33,765
<i>is the center of the earth</i>
<i>for us, and now this is home.</i>

671
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:38,267
<i>These, uh, crew members, they're</i>
<i>everything, you know. Everything.</i>

672
00:43:43,817 --> 00:43:45,512
<i> Attention, Transpac racers.</i>

673
00:43:45,552 --> 00:43:48,521
- <i>Five minutes to the start.</i>
- Got it. Five minutes.

674
00:43:52,426 --> 00:43:54,894
OK, why don't you go down
below. Kit, you're up.

675
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:56,418
Want me to grind?
You want me to grind?

676
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:58,260
- Nah.
- All right.

677
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:01,461
- How long?
- Two-twenty.

678
00:44:08,709 --> 00:44:12,236
- One-twenty.
- <i> Twenty seconds to P flag down.</i>

679
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:13,974
Are we starting on port?

680
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:18,309
One minute!

681
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,654
- Don't worry, guys.
- Forty seconds.

682
00:44:21,688 --> 00:44:24,248
A little pressure here.
A little pressure.

683
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:25,656
Twenty-five seconds.

684
00:44:28,996 --> 00:44:30,793
Holding on the line.

685
00:44:30,831 --> 00:44:32,526
- Get it set.
- Line, Robbie!

686
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,600
- Ten!
- <i> Nine.</i>

687
00:44:35,636 --> 00:44:38,298
- Get it up now.
- Eight, seven, six...

688
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:40,329
...five...
- <i>... four...</i>

689
00:44:40,374 --> 00:44:43,366
...three, two, one!

690
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,843
<i> Now.</i>

691
00:44:47,948 --> 00:44:49,313
Medium down.

692
00:44:52,152 --> 00:44:53,847
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

693
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,980
Hey! Yes!

694
00:45:01,828 --> 00:45:03,728
I remember it
being very adventurous,

695
00:45:03,764 --> 00:45:05,959
- the first time I crossed an ocean.
- Come on, Towiller.

696
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:09,935
These guys, they're getting to grow
and learn at a very similar age group.

697
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:13,064
That's a fantastic opportunity,
and I wish something like this

698
00:45:13,106 --> 00:45:15,301
had popped up for me when I was 21.

699
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:38,657
- Well, here we are at Transpac 2007.
- Yeah!

700
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:41,930
Upwind.
Did a few sail changes.

701
00:45:41,968 --> 00:45:46,064
Now I'm ready to, uh, set a kite,
and take my shirt off, and go downwind.

702
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,649
I had to start the race
down below. It was so light.

703
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:59,618
I started thinking,
"I'm already missing the small things:

704
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:01,780
Cheese pizza, HBO,

705
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:04,086
that beautiful woman
from Gladstone's."

706
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,886
The whole mindset
in offshore sailing

707
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,899
is you start to find
what your limits are.

708
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:14,457
How far can you push yourself,

709
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,264
how many hours can you
work without rest,

710
00:46:16,303 --> 00:46:18,396
how long can you go without food?

711
00:46:18,438 --> 00:46:22,272
And mentally you have the ability
to set your mind on infinity.

712
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:24,072
That's a winning combination.

713
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,352
<i> No family and friends</i>
<i>from back home.</i>

714
00:46:41,395 --> 00:46:44,558
- <i> No Starbucks.</i>
- <i> No music.</i>

715
00:46:44,598 --> 00:46:48,090
- <i> No movies.</i>
- <i> No surfing.</i>

716
00:46:50,404 --> 00:46:52,634
<i>All that matters is</i>
<i>the Diamond Head buoy.</i>

717
00:47:02,149 --> 00:47:04,811
lt... It feels amazing
to be on this boat.

718
00:47:04,851 --> 00:47:09,652
Being on a crew with a bunch of young
kids is kinda the coolest thing,

719
00:47:09,689 --> 00:47:11,657
'cause you really build a team

720
00:47:11,691 --> 00:47:13,716
and not just sail with a bunch of guys

721
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,058
who are telling you
what to do all the time,

722
00:47:16,096 --> 00:47:18,428
but you all kind of feel
like you're part of it

723
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:21,764
and feel like we have a shot
at doing really well in this race.

724
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,675
Piet and Jeremy and I, we're at a very
big decision-making point right now,

725
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:40,151
we need to choose between
the northern and southern route.

726
00:47:40,187 --> 00:47:41,620
There's no middle-of-the-road route.

727
00:47:41,655 --> 00:47:43,885
'Cause we have a local
weak high-pressure

728
00:47:43,924 --> 00:47:48,088
that has been living in the middle of
the wing existing tracks for Transpac.

729
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:52,559
The history of the race
has always been the team

730
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:54,624
that makes that choice
at the right time,

731
00:47:54,668 --> 00:47:56,636
whether it's to go south, to go north.

732
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,969
It's a defining moment, and it's
one of those moments you back up,

733
00:48:00,006 --> 00:48:01,997
and that's where
the race is won and lost.

734
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:04,010
What I'm saying is,
you know, if we're...

735
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:07,013
If we're gonna be in the synoptic,
we're on the southern route...

736
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:11,074
They really gotta make sure
that they stay in the pack,

737
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:12,641
don't make some dumb mistake

738
00:48:12,686 --> 00:48:15,314
which suddenly drops them
a few miles behind,

739
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:16,982
and then they're on the back foot.

740
00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:20,550
They don't need to be leading,
they just need to be in the hunt.

741
00:48:20,594 --> 00:48:25,190
Everything we've always learned and
talked about is not to get that close.

742
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:27,666
Jeremy, what do you think?

743
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,929
South.

744
00:48:28,969 --> 00:48:32,336
We just wanna stay away
from this, uh, high.

745
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:41,411
Big fish last night
jumped out of the water,

746
00:48:41,448 --> 00:48:43,678
- hit the sail right there.
- Hit the sail, I know.

747
00:48:43,717 --> 00:48:45,878
What about that whale?
That was a whale, wasn't it?

748
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:46,943
I thought so.

749
00:48:46,987 --> 00:48:49,421
Ten feet from our boat.
Trim on.

750
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:54,592
Trim? Trim?

751
00:48:54,628 --> 00:48:55,652
Trim.

752
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,222
You gotta use
your big girl voice.

753
00:48:58,265 --> 00:48:59,755
Hold there.

754
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:04,763
It's the first morning,
the sun just came up.

755
00:49:04,804 --> 00:49:07,773
At sunset last night
we could see ten, 15 boats,

756
00:49:07,807 --> 00:49:09,968
and now we've got no one in sight.

757
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:11,637
Position report comes out
in a little while,

758
00:49:11,678 --> 00:49:13,441
we'll see how we're doing
against our competitors.

759
00:49:14,881 --> 00:49:16,576
<i>Alaska Eagle, Alaska Eagle,</i>

760
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:20,609
this is <i>Morning Light</i> Whiskey Delta
Delta five one seven eight.

761
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:24,090
Morning Light, <i>have you loud</i>
<i>and clear. Welcome and good morning.</i>

762
00:49:24,124 --> 00:49:25,955
<i>Your position.</i>

763
00:49:25,992 --> 00:49:29,723
Thirty-two one-nine north.

764
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:33,255
One-one-nine five-six west.

765
00:49:34,234 --> 00:49:36,259
Morning Light,
<i>thank you very much.</i>

766
00:49:38,538 --> 00:49:39,630
Where are they?

767
00:49:39,673 --> 00:49:41,766
<i>Samba Pa Ti's</i>
range and bearing.

768
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:44,777
Range: 20 miles.
Bearing: 223.

769
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:46,278
So they're going up.

770
00:49:46,313 --> 00:49:48,679
Directly ahead of us,
20 miles. Yeah.

771
00:49:48,715 --> 00:49:51,548
- They're 19 miles ahead.
- Yeah.

772
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:56,618
We need to know who's goin'
north and who's goin' south.

773
00:50:00,794 --> 00:50:02,557
You see what's for dinner?

774
00:50:06,466 --> 00:50:09,162
Eleven forty-one on Monday,

775
00:50:09,202 --> 00:50:11,432
and, uh, that means lunchtime.

776
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:15,100
So, the first gourmet meal

777
00:50:15,141 --> 00:50:17,575
of this big event

778
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:20,171
will be, uh,
beef stroganoff with noodles.

779
00:50:20,213 --> 00:50:22,306
My favorite.

780
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:25,785
This southerly route
doesn't look so good. It's nine knots.

781
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:31,919
I wanna go fast.
That's 20 knots up there right now.

782
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:35,655
- What, going north?
- Going more northerly, yeah.

783
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:38,323
It's like taking
a right turn right now.

784
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:40,390
It's all in or nothing, man.

785
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:42,731
Figure I could just ask right now.

786
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:45,067
I mean, it's been an hour
since we've been...

787
00:50:45,105 --> 00:50:47,938
Started this discussion,
you know.

788
00:50:47,974 --> 00:50:50,807
We haven't heard from them
what we should be doing.

789
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:56,009
I think I should just start smashing
my foot on the deck.

790
00:50:56,049 --> 00:50:58,609
- That's not... Uh, yeah.
- No, they hate that.

791
00:50:58,652 --> 00:50:59,676
Yeah.

792
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:04,613
- What do you guys think?
- If we do this,

793
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:06,182
this is the whole race right here.

794
00:51:10,597 --> 00:51:13,361
Here we go, guys.
Let's go!

795
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,595
Are we basically deciding
to go north now, or...

796
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:16,659
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

797
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:19,231
What's the heading? 245?

798
00:51:19,272 --> 00:51:21,570
Hey, lads!
We're going north.

799
00:51:21,608 --> 00:51:23,200
- Ease the sheets!
- Full upwind.

800
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:24,574
North. Full upwind.

801
00:51:33,553 --> 00:51:36,852
This is a slow way
to go across the Pacific, huh?

802
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:42,657
Are we going to Alaska?

803
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:48,162
About 12 hours later,
the kids changed their mind

804
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:49,498
and they headed north again.

805
00:51:50,537 --> 00:51:53,904
What it told me was that, you know,
there was somebody home on the boat.

806
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,376
They were thinking, they were making
decisions, they were doing stuff.

807
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,877
Then they headed north again.

808
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,211
You know what I just thought
of, but I don't know why?

809
00:52:06,252 --> 00:52:08,652
You know why the Chevy Nova
didn't work in Mexico?

810
00:52:08,688 --> 00:52:10,212
Yeah. All right.

811
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:13,555
'Cause <i>"no va"</i>
means, like, "no go."

812
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:15,424
Why'd you buy a car
called the "no go"?

813
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:27,000
Freakin' dying. Quickly.

814
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:33,510
No way.
This wind's just gonna die.

815
00:52:53,633 --> 00:52:55,726
"Graham,
the race has been slow.

816
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:58,033
I'm sure you're aware of this.

817
00:52:58,071 --> 00:53:01,268
The brain trust has just indicated
that the next 18 hours or so

818
00:53:01,307 --> 00:53:03,400
may dictate the entire
outcome of the race.

819
00:53:03,443 --> 00:53:06,640
I hope your fingers are crossed
and you're following along at home

820
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:09,580
in Hawaii or wherever you are
at this present point in time.

821
00:53:09,616 --> 00:53:11,584
My feet are just starting to smell.

822
00:53:11,618 --> 00:53:14,587
I'm using precious off-watch time
to communicate with you.

823
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:16,316
I guess that's all for now.

824
00:53:16,356 --> 00:53:18,722
Adios from the nerve center.
Talk to you later."

825
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:29,492
This is bad.
Real bad.

826
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,106
You think this is the first
time this has happened in the Transpac?

827
00:53:39,412 --> 00:53:41,846
It'll be one that
they're gonna remember,

828
00:53:41,881 --> 00:53:44,850
- and Stan's gonna harken back to.
- Yeah, this is crazy.

829
00:53:44,884 --> 00:53:47,853
Any way you approach this race,
you have to slice through that.

830
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:49,650
That turn's gonna cost us.

831
00:53:51,024 --> 00:53:52,992
No use talking about it now.

832
00:54:12,912 --> 00:54:15,904
Oh, this is painful
circumstances right now.

833
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:18,417
We've got our opponents
out to the south of us

834
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:21,477
who are screaming along with a kite.

835
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:24,354
Guys out to the north
of us are in more breeze.

836
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:36,428
This is frustrating.

837
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:50,572
We took a gamble.

838
00:54:52,018 --> 00:54:55,112
It was a big move at the time.

839
00:54:55,154 --> 00:54:57,952
Now we're fighting for the past two days
to get out of it.

840
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:01,660
And we should've pretended
we were on train tracks

841
00:55:01,694 --> 00:55:04,185
and just trusted it.
Didn't look this light.

842
00:55:06,032 --> 00:55:09,798
But it is, and here we are.
Can't escape it now.

843
00:55:16,843 --> 00:55:20,244
- We should've known better.
- Yeah.

844
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,612
We can second-guess
ourselves all the way home.

845
00:55:24,117 --> 00:55:27,814
We'll be lucky to make it
to Hawaii in ten days, now.

846
00:55:34,594 --> 00:55:36,289
I got a question for ya.

847
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:37,694
- Yeah?
- Are we effed?

848
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,493
- Huh?
- Are we effed?

849
00:55:39,532 --> 00:55:41,557
- We don't think so. Yeah.
- Really?

850
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:44,331
You think... you think
that we can reel in <i>Samba?</i>

851
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:46,031
Uh, we'll see.

852
00:55:46,072 --> 00:55:48,302
We're not, like,
out in the middle of nowhere?

853
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:50,571
- No, we're not.
- You sure?

854
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:06,921
Big wind shift
here, guys.

855
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,689
Come on.
Let's do this.

856
00:56:08,728 --> 00:56:10,787
OK, tacking the boat.

857
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,320
Going to Hawaii.

858
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:15,066
Finally!

859
00:56:17,036 --> 00:56:19,197
We're almost
pointing at the mark.

860
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:26,402
Guys, when you have dinner,
clean your stuff, please.

861
00:56:26,446 --> 00:56:28,710
- Oh! Oh-ho!
- Whoo!

862
00:56:37,023 --> 00:56:38,854
It's Wednesday morning.

863
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:41,917
Uh, just got done doin' the roll call.

864
00:56:41,961 --> 00:56:43,895
Not to be, like, uh, Debbie Downer,

865
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,626
I thought we were gonna be smoked
after yesterday.

866
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:51,702
Did you hear from Branning,
the position report?

867
00:56:51,738 --> 00:56:53,831
- Brought some standings.
- Eh.

868
00:56:55,675 --> 00:56:59,111
We're first in division, 21 st in fleet.

869
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,779
And <i>Samba's,</i> uh, second in division,
22nd in fleet.

870
00:57:03,816 --> 00:57:07,047
We have 1,742 miles to go,

871
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:09,850
and they got 1,742 miles to go.

872
00:57:12,759 --> 00:57:14,693
Did anybody see that comin'?

873
00:57:14,727 --> 00:57:16,194
Branning, you the man.

874
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:17,753
Hi.

875
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:21,466
Hi.

876
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:23,799
Twelve hours ago we were all wrecked.

877
00:57:23,836 --> 00:57:26,737
Branning was ready to quit
sailing altogether.

878
00:57:26,773 --> 00:57:30,607
Very stressful.
Think I lost some hair.

879
00:57:31,511 --> 00:57:33,536
It was pretty miserable.

880
00:57:33,579 --> 00:57:36,707
We were over on port deck
going very slow.

881
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:39,741
Now we've, uh, tacked over
onto starboard,

882
00:57:39,786 --> 00:57:42,220
and blue sky, it's beautiful.

883
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:46,055
Bit of a difference.
Sailing pretty good today.

884
00:57:46,092 --> 00:57:49,289
Emotional roller coaster through
and through, this bloody race.

885
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:10,849
Hey, Towiller.
We need you on deck, mate.

886
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:13,249
- Coming.
- And you, too, Branning.

887
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:27,427
- OK, you guys ready?
- Yeah. Ready in the pit.

888
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:29,935
Hoist when ready, guys.

889
00:58:29,969 --> 00:58:33,769
- Bring it over.
- Go for it, go, go, go!

890
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,938
Hold there, Towiller.

891
00:58:42,982 --> 00:58:45,143
Ease. Ease, Towill.

892
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:52,555
It's startin' to feel more
what I pictured Transpac to be like.

893
00:58:52,592 --> 00:58:56,551
We're going to, going to Hawaii,
and we're back in the game.

894
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,726
We're gonna need
another human up here.

895
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:05,168
- ... more brace?
- More brace.

896
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,475
Piet, where's our <i>Morning Light</i>
logo on this kite?

897
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:13,274
Get Charlie up.
Isn't he in charge of sails?

898
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,711
The first kite we hoist in the Transpac
doesn't even have one.

899
00:59:30,029 --> 00:59:32,657
<i> "Charles.</i>
<i>Thanks for the contact.</i>

900
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:35,326
<i>Hawaii is fun.</i>

901
00:59:36,602 --> 00:59:38,467
<i>The Red Sox just won the World Series.</i>

902
00:59:38,504 --> 00:59:40,734
<i>And tell Welchy</i>
<i>the stock market burned down.</i>

903
00:59:40,773 --> 00:59:43,674
<i>I'm sorry, but there are</i>
<i>no more stocks. Period.</i>

904
00:59:44,844 --> 00:59:47,540
<i>Looks like you guys are going balls-out</i>
<i>on your route so far.</i>

905
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,207
<i>Hope you're rationing.</i>

906
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:52,149
<i>Everyone's either gonna say you're</i>
<i>brilliant or redheaded.</i>

907
00:59:52,185 --> 00:59:53,777
<i>But tell Fancypants not to worry.</i>

908
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:56,219
<i>Statistics show that</i>
<i>30 percent of redheads..."</i>

909
00:59:58,925 --> 01:00:01,086
We had a beautiful sunset tonight.

910
01:00:01,127 --> 01:00:04,688
If you look over here,
you can see the-the moon, um,

911
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,494
just glistening at the top of the...

912
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:09,558
Top of the clouds as it's setting,

913
01:00:09,602 --> 01:00:13,561
and we've just got the slightest
little crescent new moon

914
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:15,233
and it's absolutely beautiful.

915
01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:19,108
It's making a little spotlight
down on the water and...

916
01:00:19,145 --> 01:00:21,170
Beautiful stuff out here, man.

917
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:33,788
I just got an e-mail
from Graham. He wrote back.

918
01:00:33,826 --> 01:00:35,953
Our race so far,
he wishes he was with us.

919
01:00:35,995 --> 01:00:39,522
Clearly he's checking the grids, not
that he knows exactly what they mean.

920
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:41,965
He's into it and,
based on our track,

921
01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:45,368
people are gonna either think we're
brilliant or a bunch of redheads.

922
01:00:45,404 --> 01:00:47,599
But, redheads tend to...

923
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,108
Thirty percent of all redheads
turn out to live...

924
01:00:50,142 --> 01:00:51,905
...healthy, productive lives
or something.

925
01:00:51,944 --> 01:00:54,469
- Yes.
- But, yeah, he seems in good spirits.

926
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:55,878
- Trim up.
- Good.

927
01:00:55,915 --> 01:00:57,678
That's good.
That's really good.

928
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:02,415
Whoo! It's a scorcher!

929
01:01:02,455 --> 01:01:05,686
It's gonna be a "Triple-H" day:
hazy, hot, and humid.

930
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:09,183
I gotta take a shower...
I gotta do some sort of bathing today.

931
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,627
Today was the first day
where it's really hot.

932
01:01:15,668 --> 01:01:19,900
Woke up and it was sweaty and nasty
down below, which is not very fun.

933
01:01:19,939 --> 01:01:21,736
We share bunks downstairs,

934
01:01:21,774 --> 01:01:24,709
so your person opposite you
gets a little too smelly,

935
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:26,803
then, you know, it's miserable.

936
01:01:32,351 --> 01:01:35,548
<i>Big Michiganders Gone Wild.</i>

937
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:43,052
I think a little shower,
brushing your teeth,

938
01:01:43,095 --> 01:01:45,928
besides the health part of it,
just kinda keeps you going.

939
01:01:45,965 --> 01:01:48,490
I mean, it's a... freshens you up.

940
01:01:57,176 --> 01:02:00,805
Today was awesome. I got a shower,
I got to shave...

941
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:02,746
Got a hot date tonight, Genny?

942
01:02:02,782 --> 01:02:06,149
I groomed myself
while all the boys watched.

943
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:10,747
No, I'm just kidding. Um, but it was
sweet to finally get a shower today.

944
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:13,816
And then, obviously, all the...
all the... Trim.

945
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:17,090
Um, I feel like

946
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:20,496
we're all in a pretty good mood
and we're all clean and happy.

947
01:02:26,939 --> 01:02:31,103
Our competition, <i>Samba,</i>
is, uh, right above us,

948
01:02:31,143 --> 01:02:34,909
so there's a lot of pressure
on the bow team at nighttime.

949
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:39,111
Tonight's gonna be a big opportunity
for either one of us to push away.

950
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:44,589
Nighttime racing is, uh,
where you can really make huge gains.

951
01:02:44,623 --> 01:02:46,454
And it's hard to see your competitors.

952
01:02:46,492 --> 01:02:50,053
They can, uh, pull a maneuver
without you seeing.

953
01:02:51,997 --> 01:02:55,194
Last night was our first night
with the spinnaker, and it feels off.

954
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:58,203
We just need to kinda get with it.
Everyone was running around

955
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:01,468
like chickens with their heads
cut off, including myself.

956
01:03:01,507 --> 01:03:06,604
If we go to sleep for two hours
we could lose seven miles like that.

957
01:03:06,645 --> 01:03:09,671
These guys on <i>Samba,</i>
they're all fantastic sailors.

958
01:03:09,715 --> 01:03:12,275
And, you know, we're all
really new to it, I guess.

959
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,152
And we've gotta really make sure that
we, you know, try and keep our edge.

960
01:03:16,188 --> 01:03:17,883
Who knows?
You might see us tonight

961
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:20,323
jibing a couple of times
on random shifts,

962
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,623
just to get away
from these guys to windward

963
01:03:22,661 --> 01:03:24,424
and catch 'em
with their pants down.

964
01:03:24,463 --> 01:03:26,556
I like where your head's at.

965
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:27,623
Yeah.

966
01:03:30,903 --> 01:03:32,837
This is pretty much, I guess,

967
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:36,069
as about as far away from land
as you can get anywhere on the planet,

968
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:38,906
- where we are right now.
- Yeah. Halfway point.

969
01:03:39,879 --> 01:03:41,574
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

970
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:06,930
<i>Samba Pa Ti,</i> we just saw. We can see
their running lights right over there.

971
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:09,065
They're behind us and going south.

972
01:04:12,511 --> 01:04:15,674
So it's Day Six,
we just saw <i>Samba,</i>

973
01:04:15,714 --> 01:04:17,841
and we're less than
a mile away from them.

974
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:27,389
<i>Samba's</i> come astern of us
and jibed right on our line.

975
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,828
Trim up.

976
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:37,496
The pressure's really been up.

977
01:04:37,536 --> 01:04:39,970
The... the intensity
on the boat is super high.

978
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:41,996
We're just pushing, pushing,
pushing all the time.

979
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:43,065
Hold.

980
01:05:10,236 --> 01:05:12,864
Trim up.
Big trim, big trim.

981
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,413
Nice.

982
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,440
I can't believe
that boat's right there.

983
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:57,449
How close do you think they are?

984
01:05:57,483 --> 01:06:00,281
Quarter of a mile?
Not even 200 yards?

985
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:02,879
Nice to have someone
right there to push you.

986
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:08,787
Just think, we're making 'em
work for their money today.

987
01:06:08,827 --> 01:06:09,851
- Yup.
- Yeah.

988
01:06:09,895 --> 01:06:11,328
Don't stop.

989
01:06:11,363 --> 01:06:12,853
Ooh. Bolt.

990
01:06:14,266 --> 01:06:16,962
It's a thousand miles
into the race.

991
01:06:17,002 --> 01:06:19,903
<i>Samba's</i> closer to us now
than they were at the starting line.

992
01:06:19,939 --> 01:06:23,670
Trim up. Pull back.

993
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:26,735
Wow. Doing 13 knots.
The whole Pacific.

994
01:06:26,779 --> 01:06:28,838
The boat, two boat lengths from you.

995
01:06:30,983 --> 01:06:32,746
I'm gonna be a pro sailor.

996
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:35,845
Forget landscape design,
I'm doing this for the rest of my life.

997
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:07,116
I think the owner's
on the wheel.

998
01:07:09,688 --> 01:07:11,918
Lock it. Big trim, big trim,
big trim, big trim.

999
01:07:11,957 --> 01:07:13,720
No, no, no, not now, not now.

1000
01:07:13,759 --> 01:07:16,387
- Got it. Hold.
- Just keep your cool, Piet.

1001
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:22,194
We just got rolled,
unfortunately.

1002
01:07:22,234 --> 01:07:24,259
Pretty bloody close.

1003
01:07:25,904 --> 01:07:28,134
I can see the smiles
on their faces.

1004
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:32,740
That one guy
gave us the thumbs up.

1005
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:34,143
That's pretty cool.

1006
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,145
What are they doing here?

1007
01:07:40,452 --> 01:07:43,888
- And not that right now.
- Nah, they're filling the space left.

1008
01:07:43,922 --> 01:07:46,857
- They only have one sheet on.
- Yeah, that would verify it.

1009
01:07:46,892 --> 01:07:48,416
- Trim.
- Yeah.

1010
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,155
We'll take a fast-way line to Hawaii.

1011
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,958
Bold. What's going on?

1012
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:55,931
- Wow, look at that.
- What are they doing?

1013
01:07:55,968 --> 01:07:58,402
They're animals,
and they even got Kilroy out.

1014
01:07:58,437 --> 01:08:00,029
I think they lost a halyard.

1015
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:01,835
They lost their kite.

1016
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:04,502
They got something
on the rudder, I don't know.

1017
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:24,195
We had a sea serpent.
And it was wrapped around our rudder.

1018
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:26,094
And they looked at us like we were nuts.

1019
01:08:26,131 --> 01:08:27,655
We went a little bit to leeward.

1020
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:29,725
I haven't had that kind of experience

1021
01:08:29,768 --> 01:08:32,259
with another boat
in the middle of the ocean before.

1022
01:08:34,039 --> 01:08:36,234
That was a super
professional move.

1023
01:08:36,275 --> 01:08:37,435
What happened?

1024
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:39,205
They thought they
had something on their rudder,

1025
01:08:39,244 --> 01:08:41,337
so they went kite down
on deck, staysail in.

1026
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:44,440
Back down, staysail out.
Bow down, kite up. See ya.

1027
01:08:49,054 --> 01:08:51,887
- God.
- They're kinda truckin'.

1028
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:54,757
It's like they can't sail at night,
but then the day comes

1029
01:08:54,793 --> 01:08:57,626
and they're like, "OK,
I guess we'll start sailing again."

1030
01:08:57,663 --> 01:08:58,994
Then they sail pretty well.

1031
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:01,363
I feel like
they gain at night.

1032
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:06,967
<i> It's been</i>
<i>a really intense 24 hours.</i>

1033
01:09:07,005 --> 01:09:09,496
<i>We've got these pro sailors,</i>
<i>this super-fast boat.</i>

1034
01:09:09,541 --> 01:09:12,237
<i>And actually have crossed paths</i>
<i>with them this morning</i>

1035
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:14,541
<i>and then fallen behind them</i>
<i>in two big maneuvers,</i>

1036
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,447
<i>and then now to be beating them</i>
<i>again after the last 12 hours.</i>

1037
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:20,577
<i>It's really keeping us motivated</i>
<i>and keeping us going.</i>

1038
01:09:24,156 --> 01:09:27,023
To give you an example
of what we're up against,

1039
01:09:27,059 --> 01:09:29,323
the navigator for <i>Samba...</i>

1040
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:32,455
...wrote the program
that we use to navigate,

1041
01:09:32,498 --> 01:09:34,989
that all the boats use
to navigate in the Volvo,

1042
01:09:35,033 --> 01:09:38,196
the around-the-world races,
in the America's Cup, stuff like that.

1043
01:09:38,237 --> 01:09:40,671
- So...
- It's cool to be racing against him,

1044
01:09:40,706 --> 01:09:42,833
have him right there.
Thinking with him.

1045
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,638
That was a cool feeling.

1046
01:09:44,676 --> 01:09:46,906
What is <i>Samba Pa Ti?</i>
Is it a song or something?

1047
01:09:46,945 --> 01:09:49,607
<i>Samba Pa Ti</i> is a great song
by Carlos Santana.

1048
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:51,206
Trim.

1049
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,740
Hold that.

1050
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:55,414
Trim, Bear, trim.

1051
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:58,317
Pull.

1052
01:09:58,357 --> 01:10:01,918
I can't keep
trimming it like this.

1053
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,861
It's... you're... You require a lot more
trim than most people,

1054
01:10:04,897 --> 01:10:08,162
and it's exhausting.
I know you're trying to do the fastest,

1055
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,226
but... we're just going to
have to rotate more or something.

1056
01:10:12,604 --> 01:10:13,866
Trim.

1057
01:10:15,808 --> 01:10:17,173
- Pull.
- Damn.

1058
01:10:18,844 --> 01:10:21,472
She's drunk on estrogen.

1059
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:23,242
Put her down.

1060
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,810
How would you feel if you were
the only guy on an all-girl boat?

1061
01:10:27,853 --> 01:10:30,481
I'll take miserable
for 100, Alex.

1062
01:10:32,124 --> 01:10:36,754
We think Genny's had the better deal
than we would on the other end.

1063
01:10:36,795 --> 01:10:39,229
Who wants to
with his hands crossed?

1064
01:10:39,264 --> 01:10:43,030
This is like a fireside
session here, a fireside chat.

1065
01:10:43,068 --> 01:10:45,366
Well, really, hmm, uh...

1066
01:10:45,404 --> 01:10:48,498
You know, obviously none of us
know exactly how it is to be Genny,

1067
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,735
but it's got to be
a little more difficult...

1068
01:10:50,776 --> 01:10:53,142
Genny takes it pretty well
for being the only girl.

1069
01:10:53,178 --> 01:10:55,237
Spectacular. She's a trouper.

1070
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,612
Not meaning to be mean,
but we give her a lot of...

1071
01:10:57,649 --> 01:11:00,948
...just, you know, out of,
being, you know, teammates.

1072
01:11:00,986 --> 01:11:04,012
It would be very interesting to see,
you know...

1073
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:05,921
To be on the opposite
side of... of...

1074
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:07,823
I wouldn't
want to do it at all.

1075
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,590
Dude, if I could do this again
with 15 girls, I'd do it.

1076
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:14,429
- It wouldn't be the same.
- It wouldn't be.

1077
01:11:14,466 --> 01:11:16,229
Little does
<i>Samba</i> know what

1078
01:11:16,268 --> 01:11:17,895
we're talking about
while we were drag racing.

1079
01:11:25,277 --> 01:11:27,905
Y'all have seen
the standings this morning.

1080
01:11:27,946 --> 01:11:29,379
We're still in good shape.

1081
01:11:29,414 --> 01:11:32,178
Believe it or not, even with <i>Samba's</i>
advantage right now

1082
01:11:32,217 --> 01:11:33,980
we still have them uncorrected.

1083
01:11:34,019 --> 01:11:36,954
But they are making a charge for it,
and we have to, too.

1084
01:11:36,989 --> 01:11:40,390
Let's not give in.
We're in second place.

1085
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:42,825
<i>Samba</i> is just there, the big trophy.

1086
01:11:42,861 --> 01:11:45,625
So, let's just get our heads high,

1087
01:11:45,664 --> 01:11:48,690
and let's just push into this. OK, guys?

1088
01:11:55,641 --> 01:11:58,804
- Shoops, did they just jibe?
- Yes.

1089
01:11:58,844 --> 01:12:01,210
- They did?
- Yes.

1090
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:04,608
Gutsiest move I ever saw.

1091
01:12:08,687 --> 01:12:10,314
Shoops, take the wheel, mate.

1092
01:12:10,355 --> 01:12:13,586
B-Man. Jess. You're not
rolling that, are you?

1093
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:14,649
No. No.

1094
01:12:14,693 --> 01:12:16,854
Chuck it in the bag.
B-Man, I need you up here.

1095
01:12:18,897 --> 01:12:20,558
B-man, I said I needed you, mate.

1096
01:12:20,599 --> 01:12:21,759
That's not what I heard.

1097
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,166
- Yes, it is.
- I can't hear ya.

1098
01:12:24,202 --> 01:12:25,430
Come here.

1099
01:12:28,674 --> 01:12:31,234
Why have they jibed already?

1100
01:12:31,276 --> 01:12:32,903
What are you not telling me?

1101
01:12:35,213 --> 01:12:38,979
- His tack's at 290.
- The pressure's over there.

1102
01:12:39,017 --> 01:12:40,985
Is it worth taking it to get there?

1103
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,181
The Troll Nazi's back.

1104
01:12:44,222 --> 01:12:46,850
The thing is,
you can't get pissed though.

1105
01:12:46,892 --> 01:12:48,826
- He, uh...
- It's always a good point.

1106
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:51,090
It's always in the interest of speed.

1107
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:58,835
OK, guys.
We cleared for a jibe? Let's do it.

1108
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,565
Let it go. Let it pass.

1109
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:06,405
Smoothly, guys.
Make every movement smooth. OK?

1110
01:13:06,445 --> 01:13:08,743
I say it so many times.

1111
01:13:16,855 --> 01:13:19,085
<i>Samba</i> looked pretty far away.

1112
01:13:19,124 --> 01:13:21,820
I just want them to go away.

1113
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:24,226
So we can go back to sailing again.

1114
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:32,634
Day nine.

1115
01:13:33,472 --> 01:13:35,702
Eleven... twent... Elev...

1116
01:13:35,741 --> 01:13:37,572
I got 11:30.

1117
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:40,772
And this race is taking way too long.

1118
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:46,375
I'll talk about food, how about I talk
about that? All right.

1119
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:49,585
Well, today's the last day
of full meals.

1120
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:51,714
So tomorrow
we're starting the rations.

1121
01:13:51,757 --> 01:13:54,920
So we've got... five meals.

1122
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,455
And if that's three days,
then it's two meals a day.

1123
01:14:00,499 --> 01:14:04,629
So if we're doing two meals a day,
we should do it like 6am and 6pm.

1124
01:14:04,669 --> 01:14:06,227
- Yeah.
- Is that cool?

1125
01:14:06,271 --> 01:14:07,738
- Yeah.
- All right.

1126
01:14:15,981 --> 01:14:17,949
Captain,
you ready for it now?

1127
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,817
- Uh-uh. I'm eating dirt.
- It's really bad.

1128
01:14:28,527 --> 01:14:32,224
- Ah, that's not doing it.
- There's nothing else.

1129
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,824
Do it with five of these in your mouth.

1130
01:14:39,805 --> 01:14:43,332
Yeah, there ya go.
Get rid of the aftertaste.

1131
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:46,105
Uh, one of our little hobbies
that we've kinda picked up

1132
01:14:46,144 --> 01:14:49,011
is talking about the instantaneous
cravings that we have.

1133
01:14:49,047 --> 01:14:51,675
Tuna salad sandwich.

1134
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:53,741
Chocolate chip cookies
dipped in milk.

1135
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:58,119
Dirt, tofu and... Uh.

1136
01:14:58,156 --> 01:15:01,319
- Jars of peanut butter.
- Peanut butter?

1137
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:03,350
They just...
...protein.

1138
01:15:03,395 --> 01:15:06,694
Leave it out in the sun.
You get a peanut butter milkshake.

1139
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:07,755
Look at the camera.

1140
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:09,630
Hadn't eaten since
yesterday at 6:30.

1141
01:15:09,668 --> 01:15:12,159
It was awesome.
I didn't even chew.

1142
01:15:12,204 --> 01:15:16,573
I felt like my dog, Jake. When he eats,
he doesn't breathe, he just chews.

1143
01:15:16,608 --> 01:15:19,873
Eh, about half of it's chewed...
like, he chews about half.

1144
01:15:19,911 --> 01:15:23,711
Swallows the other half. No breathing
through the entire process.

1145
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:26,080
Am I getting my point across?

1146
01:15:26,118 --> 01:15:28,746
This is how desperate we are for food.

1147
01:15:28,787 --> 01:15:32,723
We will eat the worst meal we've ever
had just because we're hungry,

1148
01:15:32,757 --> 01:15:35,021
and we won't have another meal
for eight hours.

1149
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,324
Forcing it down your throat,
and at the end of it,

1150
01:15:37,362 --> 01:15:39,023
you feel like you're gonna throw up.

1151
01:15:39,064 --> 01:15:40,725
Bunch of us
are craving Reese's

1152
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:45,065
and different types of pizza,
and Chinese food so.

1153
01:15:45,103 --> 01:15:48,231
Chicken teriyaki
makes me want to vomit now.

1154
01:16:13,231 --> 01:16:14,459
<i> Hey, guys.</i>

1155
01:16:14,499 --> 01:16:17,332
<i>Steve-O wants to know</i>
<i>what's taking so long.</i>

1156
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:20,861
<i>Oh, and ask Turtle if he'd rather have</i>
<i>a nice tall glass of Baileys</i>

1157
01:16:20,906 --> 01:16:23,534
<i>at the dock instead of a mai tai.</i>

1158
01:16:23,575 --> 01:16:27,067
<i>Don't worry about</i> Samba, <i>you guys can</i>
<i>lose them in those shoals up ahead.</i>

1159
01:16:27,112 --> 01:16:30,343
<i>If you don't know what that's from,</i>
<i>we're not friends anymore.</i>

1160
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:34,819
<i>Godspeed</i> M.L., <i>stay fast</i>
<i>and don't eat each other.</i>

1161
01:16:34,853 --> 01:16:36,878
Signed, Pirate.

1162
01:16:53,872 --> 01:16:56,705
I'm a lucky bastard.
I'm lucky.

1163
01:17:05,817 --> 01:17:09,253
Are you sure we're headed west?

1164
01:17:09,287 --> 01:17:12,450
Hawaii can't possibly
be this far away. Come on.

1165
01:17:12,490 --> 01:17:14,458
Nothing's this far from land.

1166
01:17:14,492 --> 01:17:17,222
This is just stupid.
This is bad placement.

1167
01:17:17,262 --> 01:17:19,526
Why would you put islands
this far away from?

1168
01:17:19,564 --> 01:17:22,192
Get Towiller up here.
Tell him to find Hawaii.

1169
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:24,998
Towiller, we need to pull
your house out the water.

1170
01:17:25,036 --> 01:17:27,470
Hello there!

1171
01:17:33,578 --> 01:17:36,706
We sail, like, it's
a considerable part of the race

1172
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:40,411
with <i>Samba</i> within ten miles
the whole time.

1173
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:45,253
Last night they split
and went 120 miles to the south of us.

1174
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:48,748
I mean, we're really far away
and they're all by themselves.

1175
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:53,362
We just felt that if we could
get south, we'd get better breeze.

1176
01:17:53,398 --> 01:17:56,799
Based upon the numbers, it wasn't
one of these, you know, roll the dice.

1177
01:17:56,835 --> 01:17:59,770
Yeah, like when you look
at these guys down here, <i>Samba Pa Ti,</i>

1178
01:17:59,804 --> 01:18:02,170
it looks like we've been given
a lottery ticket.

1179
01:18:02,207 --> 01:18:05,040
So I'm not, um, opposed
to just taking this down

1180
01:18:05,076 --> 01:18:06,907
and getting just in front of their nose.

1181
01:18:06,945 --> 01:18:10,381
And if it lifts... we're clean.
They're behind us.

1182
01:18:10,415 --> 01:18:14,044
If it knocks, we're on the mark.
In the bank.

1183
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:16,178
- Yeah.
- In the bank.

1184
01:18:16,221 --> 01:18:19,657
- Hang on to your butts.
- Oh.

1185
01:18:19,691 --> 01:18:21,124
Let's get these guys.

1186
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:28,292
- Roll call is a dogfight.
- Is it?

1187
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,528
It's a friggin' dogfight.

1188
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:41,805
I'm gonna catch this boat up
in front of us, like it was my business.

1189
01:18:41,846 --> 01:18:45,873
We want both trophies. We want
to be the first TP52, and we want to...

1190
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:50,183
Trim! ...win our... win our division
as well. That would be sweet.

1191
01:19:09,074 --> 01:19:11,542
Have you seen
the squall over here?

1192
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:13,908
Tropical squalls
can be critical.

1193
01:19:13,945 --> 01:19:17,745
You can gain dramatically
on competitors by playing the squalls.

1194
01:19:17,782 --> 01:19:19,181
There we go.

1195
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:21,651
Twenty knots.
That's directed to the reef.

1196
01:19:23,088 --> 01:19:25,249
The sky's about to go boom.

1197
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:30,250
- Who's the boom king?
- I'm the boom king!

1198
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:31,922
Oh, baby!

1199
01:19:33,031 --> 01:19:36,194
- Hey, mister!
- Twenty-four knots.

1200
01:19:36,234 --> 01:19:38,668
Hey, well,
why don't you just race, guy?

1201
01:19:38,703 --> 01:19:42,195
- We're like modern pirates.
- Pirates, man.

1202
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,936
We don't even own this boat.

1203
01:19:44,976 --> 01:19:48,969
Breaking up
like an '80s band, baby.

1204
01:19:49,013 --> 01:19:51,140
They'll have a comeback tour.

1205
01:19:51,182 --> 01:19:52,206
Of course.

1206
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,946
That's how
<i>Behind the Music</i> always ends.

1207
01:19:54,986 --> 01:19:57,216
Yep, it was fun
while it lasted.

1208
01:19:59,124 --> 01:20:02,025
Rainbow, baby.
It's getting close.

1209
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,756
Let's keep it
going fast. All day.

1210
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:16,003
- I think I see land.
- Yeah.

1211
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,440
- Whoo.
- I think I see a volcano.

1212
01:20:18,476 --> 01:20:21,309
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

1213
01:20:21,346 --> 01:20:24,645
Yeah, you can just see the edge of Maui
right on the bow right now.

1214
01:20:27,152 --> 01:20:28,915
That's Maui.

1215
01:20:28,953 --> 01:20:31,319
Are we less than 12 hours?

1216
01:20:31,356 --> 01:20:34,519
I'm going to the top of the rig
one last time.

1217
01:20:34,559 --> 01:20:37,187
One last time, forever.

1218
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:39,788
Turtle, let's take you
to the paradise city.

1219
01:20:44,035 --> 01:20:46,799
Oh, my God.
It feels so good.

1220
01:20:46,838 --> 01:20:49,534
Gotta love it. Whoo!

1221
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:54,341
Maui right behind us.

1222
01:20:54,379 --> 01:20:56,813
Very, very excited to be back home.

1223
01:20:56,848 --> 01:20:59,476
Been 11 days of just seeing the horizon,

1224
01:20:59,517 --> 01:21:02,008
we're finally seeing the islands.

1225
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:06,188
And... I...

1226
01:21:06,224 --> 01:21:08,692
...really have a lot to say,
and I just can't say it.

1227
01:21:08,726 --> 01:21:10,284
Um...

1228
01:21:25,076 --> 01:21:26,668
Whoo!

1229
01:21:26,711 --> 01:21:29,179
A little happy
little Turtle up there.

1230
01:21:29,214 --> 01:21:31,580
Break out the inscription tool!

1231
01:21:31,616 --> 01:21:33,516
Spike yourself away!

1232
01:21:33,551 --> 01:21:34,984
I'm lovin' this!

1233
01:21:52,737 --> 01:21:55,706
So here we are,
we're in the famous Molokai Channel.

1234
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:58,470
It feels really good to be here.

1235
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:01,877
We, uh... we don't really know
where our competitors are,

1236
01:22:01,913 --> 01:22:06,145
'cause all the tracking devices
are lost or malfunctioning.

1237
01:22:06,184 --> 01:22:11,622
So we're sort of coming down here with
our eyes closed on our competitors.

1238
01:22:11,656 --> 01:22:13,886
One thing these guys
are gonna have to be conscious of

1239
01:22:13,925 --> 01:22:16,018
is what we call "channel fever."

1240
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:19,154
There's a good chance
that they'll be a little over-tired

1241
01:22:19,197 --> 01:22:22,394
and a little overexcited and they'll
starting to be thinking about...

1242
01:22:22,433 --> 01:22:24,458
Uh, about hitting the dock.

1243
01:22:25,203 --> 01:22:27,068
I'm excited to see my family.

1244
01:22:27,105 --> 01:22:32,304
All I wanna do is go to Oahu.
I just wanna get to Honolulu.

1245
01:22:32,343 --> 01:22:35,835
Dude, I want mai tais.
Would anybody like an espresso?

1246
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:40,078
I'm making some downstairs.

1247
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:43,383
This race has been won
and lost on the last day before.

1248
01:22:43,421 --> 01:22:45,616
You know what's really
interesting right now?

1249
01:22:45,657 --> 01:22:47,181
I'm coming down to the finish

1250
01:22:47,225 --> 01:22:50,991
and I have planned for nothing
after this finish.

1251
01:22:51,029 --> 01:22:53,793
This finish has been
my, like, whole year,

1252
01:22:53,831 --> 01:22:56,095
like, my whole life up to this point.

1253
01:23:05,777 --> 01:23:09,474

1256
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:16,580
I'm sure Mr. Kilroy thought that,

1257
01:23:16,621 --> 01:23:20,887
he had a superior crew, superior boat,
and would beat them handily.

1258
01:23:20,925 --> 01:23:23,416
But, that's not the way it came out.

1259
01:23:23,461 --> 01:23:25,827
It was just give
and take for quite a while.

1260
01:23:25,863 --> 01:23:28,889
I think it was Robbie Naismith
saying, "Come on, guys.

1261
01:23:28,933 --> 01:23:32,425
We can't let these kids beat us. We
couldn't live with that on our rsum."

1262
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:34,495
You know, saying it kiddingly,
but, yeah,

1263
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:36,530
you know, that's just sailboat racing.

1264
01:23:36,574 --> 01:23:38,166

1269
01:23:50,555 --> 01:23:52,716
It's sort
of mind-blowing for me.

1270
01:23:52,757 --> 01:23:55,351
I just take it all in, especially now,

1271
01:23:55,393 --> 01:23:56,985
ten miles from the finish line.

1272
01:23:57,028 --> 01:23:59,258
You, uh... you can't
really contemplate it.

1273
01:24:02,567 --> 01:24:04,000
It's pretty heavy.

1274
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:12,067
Now I'm gonna go steer my boat home
for the last time ever.

1275
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:53,373
Keep trimming, Towiller.
Not there yet, mate.

1276
01:24:56,254 --> 01:24:58,245
- Pull string in.
- Pull!

1277
01:24:58,289 --> 01:25:00,120
- It's there.
- Red buoy!

1278
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:03,992
See that red buoy? You were a dinghy
sailor before, weren't you?

1279
01:25:04,028 --> 01:25:08,590
- It's there.
- Oh!

1280
01:25:15,773 --> 01:25:17,934
- You ready?
- Ready.

1281
01:25:22,146 --> 01:25:25,172
Wow, this is gonna be sick!

1282
01:25:34,926 --> 01:25:36,291
Here we go, home!

1283
01:25:36,327 --> 01:25:38,795
Oh! We made it!

1284
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:40,263
Not yet, not yet.

01:26:25,376 --> 01:26:27,003
Nice work, you guys.

01:26:27,044 --> 01:26:30,571

1291
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:00,500
it changed me for the rest of my life,

1292
01:27:00,545 --> 01:27:02,877
but I don't think
I knew that at the time.

01:27:16,761 --> 01:27:18,956
It's about the journey.

1298
01:27:26,771 --> 01:27:29,001
<i>This is gonna be an epic story.</i>

1299
01:27:31,242 --> 01:27:33,540
<i>This is gonna be our first story.</i>

1300
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:38,180
<i>This is gonna be probably</i>
<i>our favorite story.</i>

1301
01:27:39,183 --> 01:27:40,650
<i>How it all began.</i>

1302
01:28:04,609 --> 01:28:07,544
Here we are, day 14
of the <i>Morning Light</i> adventure,

1303
01:28:07,578 --> 01:28:09,546
except this time, we're on land.

1304
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:12,140
Finally, believe it or not, we're here.

1305
01:28:12,183 --> 01:28:14,549
Wow. It's, uh...

1306
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:18,914
Yeah. I'm not gonna be
able to, uh...

1307
01:28:18,956 --> 01:28:22,323
I don't think I could find a team
like this ever again, so...

1308
01:28:24,228 --> 01:28:28,722
...it's, uh... Yeah, it's...

1309
01:28:28,766 --> 01:28:31,997
It's emotional. These guys are...

1310
01:28:32,036 --> 01:28:33,469
Hang on.

1311
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:50,019
Yeah.
I need a minute.

1312
01:29:00,731 --> 01:29:05,293
Sad! Oh, I'm so sad.

1313
01:29:05,336 --> 01:29:08,169
Yeah.

1314
01:29:11,142 --> 01:29:13,303
Wow.

1315
01:29:13,344 --> 01:29:15,369
If they put this
in the film, I'll kill 'em.

1316
01:29:15,413 --> 01:29:18,109
- Of course it's going in.
- Yeah.

1317
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:20,413
I was just telling Robbie,
I was like, you know,

1318
01:29:20,451 --> 01:29:23,716
I thought I was gonna be all broken up
and upset when you're leavin',

1319
01:29:23,754 --> 01:29:26,382
but... I'm gonna see all you
guys again in like a month

1320
01:29:26,424 --> 01:29:28,255
and like, constantly after that.

1321
01:29:28,292 --> 01:29:30,658
- I'm not worried about it at all.
- Yeah.

1322
01:29:30,695 --> 01:29:32,925
Once again, BZ to the rescue.

1323
01:29:32,964 --> 01:29:37,060
Just a sign-off to my team.
Last day as skipper.

1324
01:29:39,036 --> 01:29:41,266
Last day, uh, steering my boat,

1325
01:29:42,773 --> 01:29:44,900
and, uh, let's go for a ride.

1326
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:50,212
OK, boys! Let's go.
One last time.

1327
01:29:50,247 --> 01:29:52,010
Together.

1328
01:29:57,855 --> 01:30:01,552
<i> When the race was over,</i>
<i>it basically was over for us.</i>

1329
01:30:01,592 --> 01:30:03,583
<i>We had spent so long with each other</i>

1330
01:30:03,627 --> 01:30:06,425
<i>and the finish was what we had</i>
<i>always dreamed of and hoped for</i>

1331
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:09,399
<i>and wished for and then</i>
<i>we crossed the finish line,</i>

1332
01:30:09,433 --> 01:30:13,369
<i>and it was like, "What next?</i>
<i>Wh-Where do we go from here?"</i>

1333
01:30:24,215 --> 01:30:28,117
<i> The best thing was just</i>
<i>this sense of accomplishment at the end.</i>

1334
01:30:28,152 --> 01:30:31,519
<i>If we had won the race we would have</i>
<i>thought that the Transpac was easy.</i>

1335
01:30:31,555 --> 01:30:33,250
<i>You have to respect that race a lot.</i>

1336
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:35,622
<i>It's a long distance and a lot goes on.</i>

1337
01:30:43,067 --> 01:30:45,627
<i> The biggest thing</i>
<i>I learned from the project</i>

1338
01:30:45,669 --> 01:30:49,571
<i>has just been the real value in teamwork</i>
<i>and how special it is</i>

1339
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:52,474
<i>when 15 people can come together</i>
<i>and accomplish something</i>

1340
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:55,604
<i>that no one of us</i>
<i>could have done on our own.</i>

1341
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:10,089
<i>The days you go out</i>
<i>and everything goes the way you planned</i>

1342
01:31:10,127 --> 01:31:12,152
<i>and everything goes perfectly,</i>
<i>you learn nothing from.</i>

1343
01:31:12,196 --> 01:31:14,130
<i>It's the days you go out</i>
<i>then everything falls apart,</i>

1344
01:31:14,165 --> 01:31:15,689
<i>that's when you learn the most.</i>

1345
01:31:15,733 --> 01:31:19,032
<i>And I really learned that</i>
<i>in a very literal way on</i> Morning Light

1346
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,470
<i>and really kind of changed</i>
<i>my whole outlook on life.</i>

1347
01:31:27,845 --> 01:31:29,506
<i> You realize</i>
<i>what's important to you.</i>

1348
01:31:29,547 --> 01:31:33,176
<i>To be able to pack my whole life</i>
<i>in a small bag for ten days,</i>

1349
01:31:33,217 --> 01:31:35,515
<i>just those things</i>
<i>and being on the ocean,</i>

1350
01:31:35,553 --> 01:31:37,987
<i>was probably the happiest</i>
<i>ten days of my life.</i>

1351
01:31:48,866 --> 01:31:51,198
<i> Being on an ocean</i>
<i>is about as close</i>

1352
01:31:51,235 --> 01:31:54,398
<i>as you can put together</i>
<i>peace and fear.</i>

1353
01:31:55,773 --> 01:31:59,539
<i>It's absolutely peaceful</i>
<i>and it's just so beautiful...</i>

1354
01:31:59,577 --> 01:32:01,807
<i>... but, man,</i>
<i>it can go bad pretty quickly.</i>

1355
01:32:01,846 --> 01:32:05,009
<i>I think we were about as well prepared</i>
<i>as we could be for anything.</i>

1356
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:22,026
<i> You...</i>
<i>You realize, out on the ocean,</i>

1357
01:32:22,066 --> 01:32:25,968
<i>it's... it's a different type of life,</i>
<i>and it gives you a new respect.</i>

1358
01:32:26,003 --> 01:32:28,494
<i>Kind of hard to explain.</i>
<i>It's like you feel in power,</i>

1359
01:32:28,539 --> 01:32:30,166
<i>like you've conquered somethin'</i>

1360
01:32:30,207 --> 01:32:33,643
<i>that you know a lot of people</i>
<i>haven't had the chance to do.</i>

1361
01:32:33,677 --> 01:32:36,043
<i>You feel very fortunate</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

1362
01:32:48,259 --> 01:32:50,352
<i> Pretty much what</i>
Morning Light <i>did for me</i>

1363
01:32:50,394 --> 01:32:52,988
<i>is it opened a lot</i>
<i>of boundaries that I had.</i>

1364
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:57,467
<i>My grades have improved at college,</i>
<i>my work has improved on land</i>

1365
01:32:57,501 --> 01:32:59,935
<i>and now I feel like</i>
<i>I can just get out there</i>

1366
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:02,632
<i>and anything that I apply myself,</i>
<i>I can do.</i>

1367
01:33:13,617 --> 01:33:15,949
<i> You know,</i>
<i>whenever I see my teammates,</i>

1368
01:33:15,986 --> 01:33:18,318
<i>they'll always be</i>
<i>these special people to me.</i>

1369
01:33:18,355 --> 01:33:20,346
<i>We could be in the middle</i>
<i>of New York City,</i>

1370
01:33:20,391 --> 01:33:23,189
<i>we could be in Shanghai,</i>
<i>we could be hikin' on a mountain,</i>

1371
01:33:23,227 --> 01:33:27,027
<i>and we're still gonna have a connection</i>
<i>that no one else around us shares,</i>

1372
01:33:27,064 --> 01:33:29,225
<i>and that's a special feeling.</i>

1373
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,623
Take two!

1374
