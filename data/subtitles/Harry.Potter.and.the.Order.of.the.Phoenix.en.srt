Harry Potter and the
Order of the Phoenix

3
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,137
It's just too hot today isn't it?

4
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:56,929
And it's going to get even worse.

5
00:00:56,972 --> 00:00:59,640
temperatures up in the mid 30s Celsius.

6
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:03,853
And at night should go
up even, and perhaps...

7
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:11,819
Alright, lets go home.

8
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:15,031
What a lovely day.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,120
Do we have to? We do.

10
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:36,135
Hey big D. Beat up another 10 year old?

11
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:38,555
This one deserved
it. - Ya. - Ya.

12
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,350
5 against 1, very brave.
Well you're the one to talk?

13
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,978
moaning in your sleep every night.

14
00:01:45,603 --> 00:01:48,649
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

15
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:53,611
Don't kill Cedric.

16
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,783
Who's Cedric? Your boyfriend? Shut up.

17
00:01:58,325 --> 00:02:02,078
He's going to kill me, mom.

18
00:02:02,328 --> 00:02:05,165
Where is your mom?

19
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:08,585
Where is your mom, Potter?

20
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,628
Is she dead?

21
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:13,757
Is she dead?!

22
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:15,925
Is she dead...

23
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:31,692
What's going on?

24
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,360
What's going on here?

25
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:36,320
What are you doing?

26
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,615
I'm not doing anything.

27
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,909
Dudley, come on!

28
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,539
Run!

29
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,752
Dudley, run!

30
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:10,957
Expecto Patronum!

31
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,112
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:50,872
Took for the riddle wand,
Harry. They might come back.

33
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,336
Dementors in little
Winchik. What's next?

34
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:57,463
Whole world's in top sterny.

35
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,255
I don't understand. How did you know...

36
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,884
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:04,970
Dumbledore? You know Dumbledore?
- yea.

38
00:05:05,678 --> 00:05:08,766
After You-Know-Who killed that
poor Diggory boy last year.

39
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:12,435
Did you expect him to let
you go wandering around alone?

40
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,271
Good Lord, they told
me you're intelligent.

41
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:18,233
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,319
Soon someone will be in touch with you.

43
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,821
Whatever happens, don't freak out.

44
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:34,332
It is hot. That's it, too hot.

45
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:36,209
The heat is suffocating...

46
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,877
Dudley?

47
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:39,963
Is that you?

48
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,093
Dudley?

49
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:46,595
Vernon, come quick!

50
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:49,973
We need to take him to a hospital.

51
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,643
Who did that with you, son?

52
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,646
Happy, are we now?

53
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:01,860
You finally done it. You
finally driven Dudley.

54
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,821
Vernon, don't you say that.

55
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:06,156
Just look at him, Petunia.

56
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,408
Our boy has gone yumpie.

57
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,827
I've reach my limit, you hear?

58
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:15,374
This is the last I'm gonna
take you and your losses.

59
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:31,348
Dear Mr. Potter

60
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:34,225
The Ministry has received intelligence.

61
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:37,062
That at 6:23 this evening...

62
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:42,276
You performed the Petrunas Charm
in the presence of a muggle.

63
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:45,987
As a clear violation of the decree...

64
00:06:45,987 --> 00:06:49,158
for the reasonable restriction
of Underage Sorcery,

65
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,286
you are hereby expelled
from Hogwarts School.

66
00:06:56,122 --> 00:07:00,252
Hope that you are well, Mafilda Hopker.

67
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,925
Justice.

68
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:43,062
Sorry, Hedwig.

69
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,106
Hygienist, these muggles.

70
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,109
Tonks, for God's sake.

71
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,825
Professor Moody, what're you doing here?

72
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:57,244
To rescue you of course.

73
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:03,000
Where are we going? That I'm
just expelled from school.

74
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,543
Not yet.

75
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,668
Kingsley, you take front.

76
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,754
But the letter said...

77
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:09,089
Dumbledore has persuaded
the Minister to suspend it.

78
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,966
It's about your formal hearing.

79
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,176
A hearing?

80
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:13,302
Don't worry, Harry.

81
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,386
We'll explain everything when
we get back to headquarters.

82
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:18,432
Shh, not here, Nymphadora.

83
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,686
Don't call me Nymphadora.

84
00:09:28,274 --> 00:09:29,942
Stay in formation everyone.

85
00:09:29,985 --> 00:09:33,197
Don't digress if one of us was killed.

86
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:26,332
Come on.

87
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:07,832
In you go, son.

88
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,772
It is time to enter in action.

89
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,691
It is the first sorcerer's thought.

90
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,567
He thinks with your return...

91
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,528
Talk a little lower

92
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:41,115
He grew stronger by the
minute. We have to act now.

93
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:47,246
- Harry!
- Mrs. Weasley!

94
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,251
Thank God, you're alright.

95
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,635
Bit pity. I'm afraid, dinner, we're gonna
have to wait after the meeting finish.

96
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:02,513
Look. No time to explain.

97
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:04,639
Straight upstairs.
First door on the left.

98
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,892
Yeah.

99
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:17,653
What kind of scum would
let it in to her house.

100
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,240
why my mistress, what
would he tell the creature?

101
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,119
What a shame

102
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,806
Do not worry, madame.
The creature is here.

103
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,730
Harry.

104
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,359
You alright? We've heard
of the Dementors attack.

105
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,111
You must tell us everything.
Let him breath, Hermione.

106
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:04,450
And this hearing at the
Ministry, it's just outrageous.

107
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,495
They can't expel you.
It's completely unfair.

108
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,206
Yeah. That's a lot
going around these days.

109
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:16,919
So what is this place?

110
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,797
It's headquarters.

111
00:13:18,838 --> 00:13:20,716
The Order of The Phoenix.

112
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,592
It's a secret society.

113
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:24,635
Dumbledore formed it back
in the first, You-Know-Who.

114
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:27,806
You couldn't write any of
this in your letter I suppose?

115
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,225
Whole summer without a scrap of news.

116
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,355
We thought to write, really, I did.

117
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,277
Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

118
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,155
Dumbledore said that?

119
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,451
But why he want to keep me
in the dark? Maybe I can help.

120
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,495
Afterall, I'm the one who
saw Voldermort returned.

121
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:51,746
I'm the one he fought with.

122
00:13:52,246 --> 00:13:53,665
I'm the one who saw
Cedric Diggory get killed.

123
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:57,086
Harry.
Don't be so uptight.

124
00:13:57,794 --> 00:13:59,046
Let it out.

125
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:00,589
Anyway, we heard the chatting.

126
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,759
Only had something more interesting.

127
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,302
Harry has the right to know.

128
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:09,347
If it wasn't him, no one know he's back.

129
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,558
He's hardly a child, Molly.

130
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,144
But not an adult either.

131
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:17,230
He's not James, Sirius.

132
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,691
He's not your son.

133
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,484
I'm good at it.

134
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:22,360
No one else he's got.

135
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,071
He's got me.

136
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,865
Potter will grow up into a criminal.

137
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:29,993
Just like his Godfather.

138
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,370
Stay out of this, Severus.

139
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,831
Why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,179
Hermione, I hate your cat.

141
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:55,184
We'll be eating down in the kitchen.

142
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,605
Just because you're
allowed to use magic now,

143
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,899
does not mean you have to whip
your wands out for everything.

144
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,067
Hi, mom.

145
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,029
You hungry, Harry?

146
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,323
You sure you're alright, Harry?

147
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,743
Harry Potter.

148
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,038
Sirius.

149
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,422
It is very peculiar. It seems that your
hearing at the Ministry...

150
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:27,216
is to be before the entire Withem.

151
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:29,677
I don't understand why is the
Ministry of Magic go against me.

152
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,638
Show him.

153
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,724
He'd find out soon enough.

154
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,692
"The Boy Who Lies?"

155
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,028
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

156
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,779
"Fudge: All Is Well"

157
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,657
Fudge is using all his power.

158
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:53,159
Including his influence
at the Daily Prophet.

159
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,331
Smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord
has returned. - Why?

160
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,958
The Minister thinks
Dumbledore's after his job.

161
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,129
But that's insane. No one in the right
mind would believe that Dumbledore...

162
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,965
Excatly the point. Fudge
isn't in his right mind.

163
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:09,342
He's been twisted and walked by fear.

164
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,306
Fear makes people do a lot of things.
The last time Voldermort gain power...

165
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,559
He almost destroyed
everything we hold on stand.

166
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,105
Now he has returned, I'm afraid the
Minister will do almost anything...

167
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:25,400
to avoid facing the terrifying truth.

168
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:29,738
We think Voldermort wants
to build up his army again.

169
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:35,034
14 years ago he had huge
armies in his command.

170
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,538
Not just witches to wizards

171
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,623
But a lot of dark creatures.

172
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,294
He's been recruiting, we've
been attempted to do the same.

173
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,799
But gathering followers isn't
the only thing he's interested.

174
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:58,182
We believe Voldermort
may be after something.

175
00:16:58,182 --> 00:16:59,393
Sirius.

176
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,648
Something he didn't have last time.

177
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,444
You mean, like a weapon?

178
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,699
No, that's enough. He's just a boy!

179
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:16,993
You say much more, you might as
well inducting him to the Order.

180
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,287
Good. I want to join.

181
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,205
If Voldermort's recruiting
the army then I want to fight.

182
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,804
Harry.

183
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,972
You are hereby expelled.

184
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:40,058
Before the whole Withom.

185
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:53,072
The trains. Underground.

186
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,156
Genius of the muggles.

187
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:14,218
Here we are.

188
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,056
I've never use this entrance before.

189
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,723
It should be fun.

190
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,895
I'll just get my money.

191
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:12,276
"Dubledore
- Deaf or Dangerous?"

192
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:36,215
Good morning, Arthur.

193
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,300
Morning, Bob.

194
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:43,015
Inter Department Memos.

195
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,518
Used to use owls.

196
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,193
Thank you, Kingsley.

197
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,989
- They changed schedule of your audience.
- When is it?

198
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,366
In 5 minutes.

199
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,251
Mysteries department.

200
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,926
Minister, you is going to
do what is right, is not it?

201
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,761
Yes, the dream oughts to...

202
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:32,940
Mind you, in the audience only
talks when they talk to you.

203
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,482
Keep calm

204
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:36,317
It did nothing wrong.

205
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,947
As they say at bundles:
"The truth is going to appear".

206
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,490
Yes?

207
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,326
Fear that can't come in.

208
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,205
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,337
Diciplinary Hearing of 12th August,

210
00:20:56,337 --> 00:20:59,633
into offences commited
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:03,386
resident at no. 4,
Privet drive, Winshik,

212
00:21:03,386 --> 00:21:05,013
solicitor Cornelius Fudge...

213
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,101
Witness for Defense.

214
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,894
Albus Persidol Wilfred...

215
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,981
Brown Dumbledore.

216
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,277
You got our message that
the time and place...

217
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,404
of the hearing has
been changed, did you?

218
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,865
I must have missed it.

219
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:27,118
But by mistake, I arrived at
the Ministry 3 hours early.

220
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,705
Charges?

221
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:33,959
The charges against the
accused are as follows...

222
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,626
that he did knowingly,

223
00:21:35,626 --> 00:21:38,297
and in full aware this
legality of his action...

224
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,217
but use the Petrunas Charm
in the presence of a muggle.

225
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,805
Do you deny producing said Petrun?

226
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,892
And you were aware that you're
forbidden from using magic...

227
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,478
outside school while
under the age of 17?

228
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,772
Yes, of course, but...

229
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,025
Dear witches and wizards

230
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,194
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

231
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,990
Dementors? In Little Winchik?

232
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,619
That's very clever.

233
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:13,582
Muggles can't see
Dementors, can they, boy?

234
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,211
I'm not lying. There were
2 of them. If I hadn't...

235
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:18,461
Enough!

236
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:22,965
I'm sorry to interrupt what have
showed in a very well heard story.

237
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:25,844
But since you can produce
not witnesses of the event...

238
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:31,224
I admit, Minister. Where
as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,980
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,652
What did they look like?

241
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,200
One of them was very large,
and the other one was skinny.

242
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,328
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:52,453 --> 00:22:54,707
Alright. They are big.

244
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,836
Clothed.

245
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,672
Then... everything went cold.

246
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:06,300
Like all of the happiness
had gone from the world.

247
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,428
Now, look here.

248
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:11,597
Dementors don't just wander
into a muggle suburban.

249
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:13,307
Happen to cross with a wizard.

250
00:23:13,307 --> 00:23:15,685
The odds are termolecule.

251
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,105
I don't think anyone would've believe...

252
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,481
that the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

253
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,279
I'm sure I must've
misunderstood you, professor

254
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,367
Dementors are after all, under
the control of Ministry of Magics.

255
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:36,707
So silly but it sounded,
for moment as though,

256
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:41,420
you're suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

257
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,256
That would be disturbing
indeed, Madam Under-Secretary.

258
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:48,760
Which claim for the Ministry
to put a full scale enquiry...

259
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,472
into why the 2 Dementors were
surveiling far from Azkaban...

260
00:23:52,513 --> 00:23:55,351
and why they attack
without the authorization?

261
00:23:56,434 --> 00:24:01,230
Of course there is someone
who might be behind the attack.

262
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,069
Cornelius, I employ you to see wiz.

263
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,449
The evidence the Dark Lord have
returned is incontrovertible.

264
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:13,117
He's not back!

265
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:22,377
In the matter of Harry Potter

266
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,338
The Law say in this states,

267
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:30,760
that magic may be used before
muggles in life threatening situation.

268
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,222
Laws can be changed if
necessary, Dubledore.

269
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:37,558
Really? To bring up tight
older folk criminal trial...

270
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:40,729
to deal with a simple
matter of Underage Magic?

271
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,115
Raise, in favor of conviction.

272
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:06,797
Those in favor of clearing
the accuse of all charges.

273
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:23,021
Clear up all charges.

274
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,734
Professor!

275
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,751
Badfoot, are you barking mad?

276
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,086
It is going to deteriorate
all the operation.

277
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,056
Sirius, what are you doing
here? If someone sees you...

278
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,891
I had to see you off tonight.

279
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,311
What's life without a little risk?

280
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:06,606
I don't want to see you get
trapped back into Azkaban.

281
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,358
Don't worry about me.

282
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:13,238
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

283
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,788
Orginal Order of the Phoenix.

284
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,415
Marlene McKenine.

285
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,795
She was killed 2 weeks
after this was taken.

286
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,798
Voldermort wiped out her entire family.

287
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,299
Franklin and Ellis Longbottom.

288
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,094
Neville's parents.

289
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:38,596
They suffered a foughtless death.

290
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,227
It's been 14 years.

291
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:48,315
There isn't a day goes
by I don't miss your dad.

292
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,405
Do you really think there's
gonna be a war, Sirius?

293
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,911
It feels like it did before.

294
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,000
You keep it.

295
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:12,172
Anyway, I suppose you're
the young ones now.

296
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,679
Bye...

297
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,349
Hi, Harry Potter.

298
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,732
I suppose the Ministry don't
let you walk out free, Potter.

299
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,233
You better enjoy while you can.

300
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,403
Or else a prison in Azkaban
will have your name on it.

301
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,575
what I talked you

302
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,868
- Completely crazy.
- Stay far from me!

303
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,163
It is Malfoy.

304
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,916
what it waited?

305
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:51,896
Hi guys.

306
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:53,606
Hi, Neville.

307
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,622
What is it?

308
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,626
That. Pulling the carriage.

309
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,381
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

310
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,425
It's moving itself, like always.

311
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,275
You are not mad.

312
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,529
I can see them too.

313
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,200
You're just the sane as I am.

314
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,290
Everyone, this is Lunanut...

315
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,253
Luna Lovegood.

316
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:03,509
Interesting necklace.

317
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,346
It's a charm actually.

318
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:10,267
Keeps away the Naragos.

319
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,732
I'm hungry. I hope there's a pudding.

320
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,069
What's a Naragos?

321
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,112
No idea.

322
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,502
Good evening, children.

323
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,964
Now we have 2 changes
in staff this year.

324
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,009
Please welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank.

325
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,596
Who'd be taking care
of magical creatures,

326
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,349
while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leaves.

327
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:57,815
We're also pleased to welcome our
new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher,

328
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,273
Professor Dolores Umbridge.

329
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:04,613
I'm sure you all will join me in
wishing the professor good luck.

330
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:09,867
I assume as care taken of
Mr. Filch is to remind you...

331
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,505
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

332
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:26,593
Thank you, headmaster for
those kind words of welcome.

333
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:33,558
And how lovely to see all
your bright, happy faces...

334
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,644
smiling up to me.

335
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:41,066
I'm sure we'll all going
to be very good friends.

336
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,152
That's likely. -That's likely.

337
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:49,615
The Ministry of Magic,
has always considered...

338
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:52,911
the education of young
witches and wizards...

339
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,330
to be a vital importance.

340
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:00,294
Although each headmaster
has brought something new...

341
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,378
to this historic school.

342
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:11,096
Progress of the seek of
progress must be dicovered.

343
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,976
Let us preserve what must be preserved.

344
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,730
Perfect what can't be perfected...

345
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:25,943
And proove actism, in
order to beat pro-imitate.

346
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,453
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.

347
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,538
That really was constant minimizing.

348
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,749
Minimizing? What?

349
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,044
What does it mean?

350
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:48,092
Means the Ministry interfering Hogwarts.

351
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:12,156
Dean, Seamus, good holiday?

352
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,326
Better than Seamus' actually.

353
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,538
My mom didn't want me
to come back this year.

354
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,082
Why not?

355
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,250
Let me see, because of you.

356
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,461
The Daily Prophet has been saying
a lot of things about you, Harry.

357
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,587
And about Dumbledore.

358
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,673
Your mom believes them?

359
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,174
Well, nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

360
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,260
Well, I guess you should read the
Prophet like your stupid mother.

361
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,886
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

362
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,513
Don't you dare tell me.

363
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,182
I'll never let go anyone
that calls me a liar.

364
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,224
What's going on?

365
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,434
He is what's going on.

366
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:44,314
Do you believe him?
Yeah, I do.

367
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,776
Does anyone else got
a problem with Harry?

368
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,493
You alright?
Fine.

369
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,372
Seamus was backout there.

370
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,459
He'll go through it. We'll see.

371
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,169
I said I'm fine, Ron.

372
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:13,302
Alright. I just leave
you to your thought, huh?

373
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,375
Harry...

374
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,936
Come on, Seamus, go on, get it

375
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,413
Good morning, children

376
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:29,253
Ordinary Wizarding Level Examinations

377
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,885
Well, commonly known as... OWLS

378
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,722
Study hard and you'll be awarded

379
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:45,978
Failed to do so, and the
consequences maybe... severe

380
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,864
Your previous instruction subjects
have been disturbingly uneven

381
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,614
But please to know from now on...

382
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:02,494
You'll be following
a carefully structured

383
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,956
Ministry approved
course of defensive magic

384
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:06,873
Yes?

385
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,293
.. there isn't something about
using the defensive spells

386
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,795
Using spells?

387
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,882
Why would you need
spells in my classroom?

388
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,842
We aren't using magics

389
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:23,514
You'll be learning about defensive
spells in a secure, risks-free way

390
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,768
We're gonna be attacked,
it won't be risks-free

391
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,855
Do raise their hands
when speak in my class

392
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,860
It's the view of the ministry

393
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,155
That a theoretical
knowledge'll be sufficient...

394
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,782
To get you thru your
examinations, which after all...

395
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:44,369
Is what schools are all about

396
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:47,456
And how's theories supposed
to prepare us for out there?

397
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,291
There's nothing out there, dear

398
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:53,128
Who do you imagine'd attack
children like yourselves?

399
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,755
I don't know, maybe Lord Voldermort

400
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,516
Noe let's don't make this quiet plan

401
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:08,476
very clear.

402
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:12,815
You've been told...

403
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:16,860
That a certain dark wizard
is at large once again

404
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,530
This's a lie

405
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:24,201
This isn't a lie, I saw him, I
fought.. -Detention, Mr Potter

406
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,827
So, according to your say,
Diggory dropped of his own?

407
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,329
Then second you, Cedrico
Diggory fell dead why he wanted.

408
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,789
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident

409
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,916
He was murdered, Voldermort
killed him, you must know that

410
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,170
Enough... enough!

411
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:39,507
See me later, Mr Potter... my office

412
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:04,867
Come in

413
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,998
Good evening, Mr Potter

414
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,251
Sit

415
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:25,137
You're gonna be doing some
lines for me today, Mr Potter

416
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,264
No, not with your quill

417
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,101
Cause you're gonna be using
a rather special 1 of mine

418
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,192
Now...

419
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,985
I want you to write:

420
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,199
"I should not tell lies".

421
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:48,994
How many times?

422
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:51,454
See...

423
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,041
the enough for the message penetrate.

424
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,836
You haven't given me any ink

425
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:00,713
You won't need any inks

426
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,295
"I should not tell lies".

427
00:39:50,931 --> 00:39:51,974
Well?

428
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,190
Nothing

429
00:40:01,483 --> 00:40:02,735
That's rite

430
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,572
Because you know deep down

431
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,701
You deserved to be punished

432
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,536
Don't you, Mr Potter?

433
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,543
Go on

434
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,971
Diving snack box

435
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,014
It'll get you outta class

436
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:36,768
Let's take hours of
pleasures outta school boredom

437
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,396
You want for another?

438
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,983
I'm not asking you to write for me

439
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:46,362
I'm just busy studying this stupid exams

440
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:48,905
I'll do the introductions for you

441
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:52,492
Hermione, you're the most
wonderful person I've ever known

442
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,536
I'll never be rude to you again

443
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,413
Only I bet you will

444
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,626
What's wrong with your hand?

445
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,753
Nothing

446
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,840
The other hand

447
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,594
You've gotta tell Dumbledore

448
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,222
No, Dumbledore's got
enough in his mind rite now

449
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,101
Anyway I won't get
Umbridge's satisfaction

450
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:19,394
Bloody hell she was torturing you

451
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,521
If your parents know about this...

452
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,190
Yeah, I haven't got any parents, have I?

453
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:28,445
Harry, you've gotta report this

454
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,949
- It's very simple...
- No, is not.

455
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,869
Hermione, be what it
may is not that simple.

456
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,579
You don't understand.

457
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,251
But I want to understand.

458
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:00,936
Dear Malfoot, I hope you're allright

459
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,980
It's getting cooler here

460
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,398
Winter's definitely on the way

461
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:13,114
Despite I've been back to Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever

462
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,411
I know you but all
people will understand

463
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,280
Hello Harry Potter

464
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:59,202
Your feet, aren't you cold?

465
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,579
A bit

466
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:06,085
Unfortunately of my shoes
of mystery have disappeared

467
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,713
Suspect who Narguilйs
be for trбs of this.

468
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,971
What are they?

469
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:19,639
The Carl Pastro

470
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,351
They're gentle really, but...

471
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:26,271
People avoid them
because, they've been...

472
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,775
Different

473
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,947
Why can't the others see?

474
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,909
They can only been by
people who's in death

475
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,331
So you know someone who's gone?

476
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,708
My mum

477
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,628
She was quiet an extraordinary witch

478
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,965
She did a lot of experiments though

479
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,717
One day 1 of her spells went badly wrong

480
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:57,885
I was 9

481
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,429
I'm sorry

482
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,264
It wasn't that hard

483
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,643
I do feel very sad about it sometimes

484
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,978
But I have a dad

485
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,655
By the way my dad and i believe you

486
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,197
And you fought him

487
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:21,409
Everything's extremely tough for
you consipring against Dumbledore

488
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:25,204
Thanks, seems that
you're the only who does

489
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:27,666
I don't think that's true

490
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,211
But I suppose that's the way
he wants you if you feel.

491
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,505
What do you mean?

492
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,634
If I were the other one

493
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:40,929
I don't want you to feel
crowd from anyone else

494
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:47,561
Because if it's just you alone...
you aren't much as a threat

495
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:04,369
Would you ever stop eating?

496
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,579
I'm hungry

497
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:11,626
Harry

498
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,005
Can I join you?

499
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:20,344
Prof, what exactly are you insinuating?

500
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:23,429
And you requesting when
I punished my students

501
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,184
You conformed to prescribe
disciplinary practices

502
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,769
Seems silly but certain...

503
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:33,773
That you're questioning my
authority in my own classroom

504
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:35,275
Minerva

505
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,695
Not at all, Dolores

506
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,322
Just their medieval methods.

507
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:42,949
I'm sorry, dear

508
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,869
But to question my practices
is to question the ministry

509
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,998
And by extension, the minister himself

510
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,916
I'm a tolerant woman

511
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:55,045
But the 1 thing I won't
stand for is disloyalty

512
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,713
It is disloyalty.

513
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:00,675
Disloyalty?

514
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:06,097
Things at Hogwarts are
far worse than I feared

515
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,726
.. will take immediate actions

516
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:22,655
What happened to Dumbledore?

517
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:25,242
Umbridge revolutionised
the teaching of defence

518
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:41,967
To repress the seriously falling
standards of Hagwarts school

519
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,768
Just 1 question

520
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:56,315
You've been in this post
for how long exactly?

521
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,824
It registered before for the position in
the Defense against Arts of the Darkness.

522
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:09,619
Is that correct?
Yes

523
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,581
But you were unsuccessful

524
00:47:14,333 --> 00:47:15,958
Obviously

525
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,244
Would you predict
something, please?

526
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,123
I'm sorry

527
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:01,213
Move their mouths.

528
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:10,931
1 tiny apocalypse?

529
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,023
Pity

530
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:23,235
No, wait... I think
1 do see something, yes

531
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:24,862
I saw something dark

532
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:29,032
You're in a great danger

533
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:32,577
Good

534
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,297
Cho, what's going on?

535
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,467
It's professor, Trelawney

536
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,914
16 years I've been here to teach

537
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,708
Hogwarts is my home

538
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,005
You can't do this

539
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,759
Actually I can

540
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,059
Minerva

541
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,853
Something you'd like to say, dear?

542
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:42,481
Oh there're several
things I'd like to say

543
00:49:43,065 --> 00:49:45,108
Dear... calm.

544
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:00,498
Prof McGonagall

545
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,793
May I ask you to escort
Sybil back inside?

546
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:06,380
Sybil, come here

547
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,382
Thank you, Dumbledore

548
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,429
Dumbledore, may I remind you

549
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:18,599
Under the tone of educational decree
#23 as it acted by the minister

550
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,978
You've the right to dismiss my teacher

551
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:25,606
But you don't have the authority
to banish them from the garden

552
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,110
That power remained with the headmaster

553
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,989
For now

554
00:50:38,704 --> 00:50:40,664
Don't you have studying to do?

555
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,373
Professor?

556
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,126
Professor?

557
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:48,463
Professor Dumbledore? Professor?

558
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,382
Professor Dumbledore?

559
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,978
That cursed gargul.

560
00:51:04,855 --> 00:51:06,648
We aren't learning
how to defend ourselves

561
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,193
We aren't learning how to pass our OWLS

562
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,278
She's taking over the entire school

563
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:17,326
Security's and will remian
the ministry's top priority

564
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:20,496
Furthermore, we've convincing evidence

565
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:24,041
That these disappearances
are the work of...

566
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:27,628
The notorious mass
murderer, Sirius Black...

567
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,961
Harry

568
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,755
Sirius

569
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:33,884
What are you doing here?

570
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:34,927
Return your letter

571
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,137
You said you're worried about Umbridge

572
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:40,682
What's she doing? Trying to
train you to kill the half-breed?

573
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:42,726
She isn't letting us to use magic at all

574
00:51:42,726 --> 00:51:44,436
I'm not surprised

575
00:51:44,436 --> 00:51:48,523
The latest intelligence says that
Fudge doesn't wanna train in combat

576
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:49,817
Combat?

577
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:52,695
He afraid we're forming
some sort of wizard army?

578
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:54,362
This's exactly what he thinks

579
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:58,324
That Dumbledore is assembling his
own forces to take on the ministry

580
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,619
He's becoming more crack on the edge

581
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:06,791
The others wouldn't want
me to tell you this, Harry

582
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:09,836
Things aren't going well at all, the order

583
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:12,338
Fudge's blocking the truth

584
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,885
These disappearances are the
same, that's how it started before

585
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:20,972
Voldermort is on the move

586
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,349
What do we do?

587
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:27,396
Someone is coming, I'm
sorry I can't be more help

588
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:32,568
But for now, it looks
like you're on your own

589
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,536
He's out there isn't he?

590
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:48,166
We've gotta be able to defend ourselves

591
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:53,422
If Umbridge refuses to teach
us how we need someone who'll

592
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,340
Harry

593
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:23,242
This is mad, who wants
me teach anything?

594
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,371
I'm a nut, remember?

595
00:53:26,538 --> 00:53:28,666
You can't be any worse than her, anyway

596
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:30,958
Thanks, Ron

597
00:53:31,168 --> 00:53:32,670
Anything, mate

598
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,630
Who supposed to make this?

599
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,882
Just we're

600
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:44,972
Not as bad

601
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,771
Well, at least safer than being tracked

602
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:52,940
Hey come back here

603
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,824
Hi.

604
00:54:02,324 --> 00:54:03,534
So...

605
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:05,619
We know why we're here

606
00:54:05,661 --> 00:54:07,121
We need a teacher

607
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:10,164
Proper teacher

608
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:14,711
One has really experienced to
defend himself against the dark arts

609
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:15,920
Why? -Why?

610
00:54:16,422 --> 00:54:18,757
Because You-knows-who
it came back, idiot.

611
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,842
So as Harry says

612
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:22,635
So Dumbledore says before Harry said?

613
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,762
The point is where's the proof?

614
00:54:26,974 --> 00:54:30,561
Perhaps Harry could tell us
more about Diggory got killed

615
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:34,898
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric

616
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,067
That isn't why you're
here, or we can clear up now

617
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:40,945
Come on Hermione, let's go,
these are some sorts freaks

618
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,407
Is that true you can teach us chant?

619
00:54:46,952 --> 00:54:48,077
Yes.

620
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,373
I've seen it

621
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:54,083
I don't know you can do that?

622
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:56,378
He killed a Basalese...

623
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,047
With a sword in Dumbledore's office

624
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:08,181
And last year he really
did fight who went to flash

625
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:10,684
Wait

626
00:55:11,226 --> 00:55:14,855
Those sound great when you
say it like that, but...

627
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,483
In fact, I was just lucky

628
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:19,568
I didn't know what I was
doing half of the time

629
00:55:19,568 --> 00:55:21,778
I nearly always had help

630
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,239
He's just being modest
- No, Hermione, I'm not

631
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:32,039
Facing these stuff in real
life isn't like in school

632
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:36,751
It isn't like you made a mistake
you can try just try again tomorrow

633
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,503
But out there

634
00:55:39,338 --> 00:55:42,675
When you're a second
away from being murdered

635
00:55:42,675 --> 00:55:45,760
Or watching a friend
die rite before your eyes

636
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:51,141
You don't know how it's like

637
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,777
You're rite, Harry, we don't

638
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,864
That's why we need your help

639
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:08,992
Because the one we try of beating...

640
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:12,996
Voldermort

641
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,793
He's coming back?

642
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:40,273
"Dumbledore Army"

643
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:43,652
1st we need to find a place
where Umbridge won't find out

644
00:56:43,652 --> 00:56:45,278
That's too small

645
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:48,239
- The prohibited forest?
- It is not going to come out right

646
00:56:48,574 --> 00:56:51,577
Harry, what happened if
Umbridge does find out?

647
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:56,539
Who cares? I mean...
it"s exciting, isn't it?

648
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,250
Breaking the rules

649
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:01,128
Who are you and what did
with Hermione Granger?

650
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:05,215
Finally, at least know a thing
certainly of this meeting.

651
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:06,759
Which?

652
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,929
For the next few days we should...

653
00:57:14,057 --> 00:57:18,269
All come to this place and practise

654
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:23,900
We gotta make sure Umbridge
won't find out this place

655
00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:36,163
All student organisations disbanded

656
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:39,750
Watch way you're going

657
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,711
You've done it
It where is going Longbottom?

658
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:20,958
You got Neville.

659
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:23,251
You found the Room Needs.

660
00:58:24,003 --> 00:58:25,170
Which room?

661
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,422
This's also called
come-and-go-room

662
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:31,217
The room only appears when
a person's immediate needs

663
00:58:31,677 --> 00:58:34,012
And always is equiped
with that it is needed

664
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:37,599
So, you really needed a toilet?

665
00:58:39,434 --> 00:58:41,019
Charming really

666
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:42,646
But yes.

667
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:44,898
It is this the idea.

668
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:46,150
It's great

669
00:58:46,483 --> 00:58:49,027
Just like Hogwarts wants to fight back

670
00:59:01,248 --> 00:59:02,373
Expelliarm...

671
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:13,052
You're just flourishing your
stick too much, try like this

672
00:59:13,052 --> 00:59:14,135
Expelliarmus!

673
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:18,724
Would you please copy
your whole text 4 times

674
00:59:19,016 --> 00:59:21,976
To ensure maximum attention

675
00:59:22,436 --> 00:59:24,228
You don't need to talk

676
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:26,315
I think it's more like it

677
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:27,733
Expelliarmus.

678
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:29,108
Ron, awake

679
00:59:41,914 --> 00:59:44,833
Stunning is one of the sorceries
more useful in your arsenal.

680
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:47,710
It is an essential artifice
for the sorcerer, so...

681
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,045
Run on, Nigel.

682
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:51,090
Give it your best shot.

683
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:58,889
Expelliarmus!

684
01:00:04,894 --> 01:00:07,231
Not to bad.
Good, not bad... at all

685
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:17,115
Don't worry about,
Hermione, we'll go lightly

686
01:00:17,157 --> 01:00:18,826
Thanks, Ron

687
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,414
- Come on Ron.
- Come on Ron.

688
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:24,998
Come on Ron.

689
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:26,583
She was already, Ron.

690
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:46,394
Thank you -Shut up

691
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:48,396
I let her do that

692
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,773
She wouldn't be bothered.

693
01:00:53,902 --> 01:00:55,862
It's really my intention

694
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:17,217
"All students will
submit to questioning"

695
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:18,885
"about activities illicit suspicions".

696
01:01:20,762 --> 01:01:23,724
Come on, do you want a cup of tea?

697
01:01:25,851 --> 01:01:29,355
Focus on the fixed point, try again

698
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:31,981
Expelliarmus!

699
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,195
Very good, keep the concentration.

700
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:40,282
Right.

701
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:43,117
a little higher

702
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:48,331
I'm ok...

703
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:54,420
I'm ok...

704
01:02:15,525 --> 01:02:17,235
The ones that they want to join

705
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:19,697
to the Brigade Inquisitorial
for extra credit,

706
01:02:19,697 --> 01:02:22,574
it owes if register
in the High Magic room.

707
01:02:22,615 --> 01:02:23,867
Reducio!

708
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:32,835
Working hard is important, there's
something be out this even more...

709
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:34,753
Believing in yourself

710
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:36,672
Expelliarmus.

711
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:41,135
Think of this, every
great wizard in history

712
01:02:41,135 --> 01:02:42,677
Started out...

713
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:47,849
Nothing more than what
we're now... students

714
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:51,394
If they can do it, why not us?

715
01:03:01,864 --> 01:03:03,907
Expelliarmus.

716
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,675
Expelliarmus.

717
01:03:42,028 --> 01:03:43,112
Expelliarmus.

718
01:03:47,242 --> 01:03:49,369
Fantastic, well done, mate

719
01:03:53,248 --> 01:03:55,583
So, that's it for this lesson

720
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:59,338
We aren't gonna be meeting
again until after the holidays

721
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,590
So just keep practising
on your own best you can

722
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:05,635
And well done, everyone,
great great work

723
01:04:30,244 --> 01:04:31,661
We see us in the communal room, Harry.

724
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:34,831
- Thank you very much, Harry.
- Not at all

725
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,043
Merry Christmas

726
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:39,670
- Thank you very much
- It was not anything.

727
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,838
Merry Christmas

728
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:42,338
Thanks. Merry Christmas

729
01:04:46,677 --> 01:04:48,052
We was thinking, Harry.

730
01:04:48,094 --> 01:04:50,556
We could place some vomitilhas
in the Umbridge's Tea.

731
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:53,224
Or Febricolate. You say
with some full furuncles..

732
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:55,936
Sounds great, guys, would you excuse me?

733
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:08,699
Are you all right?

734
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:12,494
I heard Umbridge gave you
a hard time the other day

735
01:05:12,536 --> 01:05:14,079
Yeah, I'm ok

736
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:17,750
It's worth it

737
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:25,632
Just... learning all these

738
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:29,094
Made me wonder maybe he would...

739
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:33,264
Cedric... gave me all these stuff

740
01:05:34,182 --> 01:05:36,059
He was really good

741
01:05:37,644 --> 01:05:39,813
It was just Voldermort was better

742
01:05:44,693 --> 01:05:46,778
You're a really good teacher, Harry

743
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:50,449
I've never been interested
in any of these before

744
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,793
A visgo.

745
01:06:04,463 --> 01:06:07,548
It probably is full of Narguilйs.

746
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:10,135
what Sгo Narguilйs?

747
01:06:11,094 --> 01:06:12,679
I do not have idea.

748
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:35,577
Well, how was it?

749
01:06:36,452 --> 01:06:40,541
I mean she was sorta crying

750
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:42,501
Not that bad, are you?

751
01:06:42,835 --> 01:06:46,130
I'm sure Harry's kisisng's
more than satisfactory

752
01:06:48,715 --> 01:06:51,175
Cho's been half of the
time crying these days

753
01:06:51,217 --> 01:06:53,846
I bet a longer kiss will cheer her up

754
01:06:54,972 --> 01:06:57,474
You don't know how she must be feeling?

755
01:07:03,856 --> 01:07:06,275
It stands to reason that
she is in sad by the Cedrico.

756
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:09,652
Confused to like Harry, it
feels blamed by tк him kissed.

757
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:13,072
In conflict with Umbridge who wants
fire her mother of the Ministry.

758
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:16,784
And afraid of do not pass in the NOMS
for being so worried about everything.

759
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:21,206
A person can not feel all this

760
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:22,583
She would explode.

761
01:07:22,623 --> 01:07:26,295
That is because your emotional side
it belongs to the size of a teaspoon

762
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:53,030
Voldemort ought to be behind something.

763
01:07:53,947 --> 01:07:56,784
Something that he did not
get the last time

764
01:07:58,327 --> 01:07:59,411
Harry!

765
01:08:34,697 --> 01:08:37,573
In the dream, where you standing
next to the victim?

766
01:08:38,492 --> 01:08:41,537
- Or looking down at the scene?
- Neighter one.

767
01:08:41,703 --> 01:08:42,912
It was as...

768
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:46,291
Professor, can you tell what's
happening?

769
01:08:46,291 --> 01:08:47,458
Everardo.

770
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,211
Arthur is the watchman tonight

771
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:51,337
I assured him who are
the right people.

772
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,463
- Sir..
- Please!

773
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:55,634
Go to your portrait in Grimmauld Place.

774
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:58,470
Tell them that Arthur
Weasley is seriously wounded.

775
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:02,390
And that his sons are going to
arrive there soon, at portal key.

776
01:09:02,975 --> 01:09:04,726
they are already theTarget.

777
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:06,645
It was close but they
think it's going to survive.

778
01:09:06,686 --> 01:09:09,314
Once again the Lord of the Darkness
i did not acquire it.

779
01:09:09,314 --> 01:09:10,940
Look at me!

780
01:09:17,948 --> 01:09:20,743
what is happening to with me?

781
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,170
It wish to see me, director?

782
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:32,880
I'm afraight it can't wait.

783
01:09:34,088 --> 01:09:35,506
Not untill the morning.

784
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:38,469
Otherwise, we will be vulnerable.

785
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:48,645
It seems that there is a connection in
the mind of the Lord of the Darkness

786
01:09:48,686 --> 01:09:52,065
Whaether he is aware of the
connection, i don't know

787
01:09:52,315 --> 01:09:54,984
Lets Pray that he continue not to know

788
01:09:55,444 --> 01:09:57,029
It means, if he knows about her...

789
01:09:57,904 --> 01:10:00,823
he will be able to read my mind?

790
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:02,743
Read. Control.

791
01:10:03,993 --> 01:10:05,537
Go mad.

792
01:10:07,122 --> 01:10:10,167
It formerly was common
the Lord of the Darkness,

793
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,212
have the pleasure invading
the mind of her victims.

794
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:17,298
Creating projected images for
torturб them until the madness.

795
01:10:17,925 --> 01:10:22,345
Only after extracting the last
sanity drop.

796
01:10:22,345 --> 01:10:26,516
Only when it did them implore
by the death, he finally killed

797
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:30,854
Used right Oclumкncia's Power,

798
01:10:30,854 --> 01:10:33,983
it can protegк him of
access or influence.

799
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:38,194
Nestas classes I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

800
01:10:38,695 --> 01:10:42,157
And you will attempt to resist.

801
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,202
Prepare yourself.

802
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:46,828
Legilimens!

803
01:10:51,166 --> 01:10:52,376
It is your curse.

804
01:10:55,045 --> 01:10:57,296
Concentrate, Potter!

805
01:10:57,756 --> 01:10:58,923
Concentration.

806
01:11:26,201 --> 01:11:27,493
Merry Christmas

807
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:30,372
There go we!

808
01:11:30,872 --> 01:11:32,416
Daddy came back.

809
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:33,542
Thanks.

810
01:11:36,712 --> 01:11:40,548
Sit down, everybody, sit
down, now's time for presents

811
01:11:40,548 --> 01:11:42,717
An artistic box for Ron.

812
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:44,386
A great box for you.

813
01:11:44,386 --> 01:11:45,470
And...

814
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:50,434
They will go, Abram.

815
01:11:50,434 --> 01:11:51,894
I want to see their the guy.

816
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:55,104
- Try.
- Thank you, mother, is perfect.

817
01:11:55,104 --> 01:11:57,940
- It was what you wanted, actually
- It is.

818
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,234
- Well that, mother.
- It is.

819
01:11:59,443 --> 01:12:00,610
It was good.

820
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:02,154
We go personal, we will do this way.

821
01:12:02,904 --> 01:12:04,405
Harry, Harry.

822
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:07,201
There you are.

823
01:12:08,577 --> 01:12:10,371
Happy Christmas -Thanks

824
01:12:10,912 --> 01:12:12,872
- It seizes that.
- Thanks.

825
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:14,750
Now the daddy. what is the of the daddy?

826
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:16,793
- Thanks.
- Did all of them win?

827
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:18,420
- A toast!
- Fred, George,

828
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,463
- Hermione sees if...
- A Christmas toast!

829
01:12:20,963 --> 01:12:22,632
To Mr. Harry Potter.

830
01:12:24,551 --> 01:12:27,512
Without him, I wouln't be here

831
01:12:30,932 --> 01:12:33,101
- Harry!
- Harry!

832
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:34,435
Harry!

833
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,314
That is delicious.

834
01:12:37,314 --> 01:12:40,900
- I am going to want more of this.
- But daddy, no...

835
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:43,654
I don't understand why
he didn't wanna wear that

836
01:12:45,029 --> 01:12:47,198
Because I keep seeming
an idiot, because of this

837
01:12:47,198 --> 01:12:49,076
Not more than the usual.

838
01:12:57,542 --> 01:13:01,546
arrogant brat stopped
there is courageous.

839
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:07,051
Harry Potter, the boy
who stopped the dark lord

840
01:13:07,386 --> 01:13:10,930
Friend of Muggle, traitor of friends...

841
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:13,600
- If my poor loves
- Monster!

842
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:16,770
reager enough of your vile!
Away with you.

843
01:13:17,145 --> 01:13:18,814
Okay, boss.

844
01:13:18,814 --> 01:13:23,444
Monster lives to serve the
noble house of Black.

845
01:13:24,194 --> 01:13:25,654
Sorry about that

846
01:13:26,613 --> 01:13:29,867
He never was very pleasing.
Even when I was boy.

847
01:13:30,743 --> 01:13:32,202
at least, not with me.

848
01:13:33,828 --> 01:13:35,831
The what? Were you created here?

849
01:13:35,956 --> 01:13:37,666
This is my parents' house.

850
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:41,962
For Dumbledore's
Headquarters for the order

851
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:46,466
Maybe the only useful
place I've been able to do

852
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,929
This's the Black's family tree

853
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,806
My cousin

854
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,518
I hated too much.

855
01:13:57,019 --> 01:14:01,314
My parents pure blood

856
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,488
My mother tried another way

857
01:14:10,615 --> 01:14:11,992
charming woman.

858
01:14:13,868 --> 01:14:15,119
I was 16

859
01:14:16,454 --> 01:14:18,039
Where did you go?

860
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:21,585
Close to my dads.

861
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:24,921
I always was welcome at Potters.

862
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,425
I've seen so much of you, Harry

863
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:31,679
You and i are so pretty much alike.

864
01:14:33,096 --> 01:14:34,806
I'm not that sure.

865
01:14:36,225 --> 01:14:38,185
Sirius, when I was...

866
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:44,774
When I saw Mr Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching

867
01:14:45,274 --> 01:14:47,778
I was the snake.

868
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:51,823
And afterwards at Dumbledore's office

869
01:14:51,948 --> 01:14:54,534
There was a moment
when I... I wanted to...

870
01:14:59,581 --> 01:15:02,626
This connection between
me and Voldermort

871
01:15:03,127 --> 01:15:07,381
The reason for it... is that
I'm the coming one like him

872
01:15:08,256 --> 01:15:10,967
I just feel so angry all the time

873
01:15:11,385 --> 01:15:12,886
The whole time.

874
01:15:15,305 --> 01:15:17,725
And what if everything
that I've been thru

875
01:15:18,182 --> 01:15:20,810
something gave wrong within me?

876
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,479
Inside me what if I'm becoming bad?

877
01:15:24,648 --> 01:15:27,318
I want you to listen to
me very carefully, Harry

878
01:15:29,194 --> 01:15:31,863
You aren't a bad person

879
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:36,659
You're a good person
that bad things happen to

880
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:39,579
Do you understand?

881
01:15:41,664 --> 01:15:47,462
The world isn't spliting
to good people and deaths

882
01:15:47,462 --> 01:15:50,673
People got both bright and dark inside

883
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:55,011
What matters is about choose the right1

884
01:15:57,514 --> 01:15:59,224
That is what we really are.

885
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,229
Harry, we got to get going.

886
01:16:07,358 --> 01:16:11,153
When all these are over,
we'll be a proper family

887
01:16:11,862 --> 01:16:13,113
You are going to see.

888
01:16:52,152 --> 01:16:53,444
It did same?

889
01:16:53,779 --> 01:16:54,863
Harry!

890
01:16:55,072 --> 01:16:57,865
Harry... Hagrid's back

891
01:17:01,744 --> 01:17:03,079
I'm sorry.

892
01:17:18,177 --> 01:17:20,555
I am going to talk that by last time

893
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,350
I order you to tell
me where have you been?

894
01:17:24,393 --> 01:17:26,811
I told you, I've been away for my health

895
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:28,814
- Your health?
- Yes.

896
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:30,858
A bid of fresh air, you know?

897
01:17:31,149 --> 01:17:33,234
Oh yes, as game keeper

898
01:17:33,234 --> 01:17:36,363
Fresh air must be difficult to come by

899
01:17:38,323 --> 01:17:41,201
If I were you, I shouldn't get
too used to being back in fact...

900
01:17:41,201 --> 01:17:44,329
I might not be unpacking at all

901
01:18:01,889 --> 01:18:03,931
That is top secret, right?

902
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:08,436
Dumbledore sending me
to party with the giants

903
01:18:08,436 --> 01:18:09,604
Giant?

904
01:18:11,273 --> 01:18:12,565
Did you find them

905
01:18:12,565 --> 01:18:15,319
Well, they aren't that hard
to be found, to be honest

906
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:16,737
They are so great, are not they?

907
01:18:17,445 --> 01:18:20,282
I talked to them to join the class

908
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:23,452
But I wasn't the only one
who tried to win them over

909
01:18:24,036 --> 01:18:25,953
- Guests of the death.
- Yes.

910
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:29,750
Trying to persuade them
to join you know whom

911
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:33,087
I gave him Dumbledore's mesage

912
01:18:33,087 --> 01:18:36,297
Supposed someone'll remember
he was great to, I supposed

913
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:44,305
- And did they do that to you
- Not exactly.

914
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,519
Go on, you have it, Dolvy dog

915
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:08,122
It's strange out there,
just like last time

916
01:19:09,497 --> 01:19:11,166
There is a storm coming, Harry.

917
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,461
We all must be ready when it does

918
01:19:49,997 --> 01:19:53,207
We confirm that 10 prisoners
extremely dangerous,

919
01:19:53,207 --> 01:19:56,462
at the beginning of
night yesterday's escaped.

920
01:19:56,462 --> 01:20:00,298
Of course the Prime minister
bundle was warned of the danger.

921
01:20:00,298 --> 01:20:02,926
We have a great suspicion,

922
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:06,387
We strongly suspect the
breakout was planed

923
01:20:06,387 --> 01:20:09,850
By a man who's experience in Azkaban

924
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,729
Notorious mass murderer, Sirius Black

925
01:20:15,564 --> 01:20:19,193
He is cousin of the
fugitive, Belatrix Lestrange.

926
01:20:23,529 --> 01:20:24,657
"Mass breakout from Azkaban"

927
01:20:30,871 --> 01:20:32,956
Dumbledore warned Fudge of this
was going to happen

928
01:20:33,414 --> 01:20:36,042
He is going to finish killing
for not facing the truth.

929
01:20:36,918 --> 01:20:37,961
Harry.

930
01:20:39,253 --> 01:20:43,384
I... I wanna apologize

931
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:48,012
Now until my mother tells that
the Prophet is not so right.

932
01:20:49,055 --> 01:20:52,434
So, what I'm really
trying to say is that...

933
01:20:53,143 --> 01:20:54,560
I believe in you.

934
01:21:01,068 --> 01:21:02,194
Neville?

935
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,292
14 years ago

936
01:21:18,085 --> 01:21:22,171
A death eater named Bellatric Lestrange

937
01:21:22,715 --> 01:21:25,466
Used to excruciate my parents

938
01:21:26,217 --> 01:21:28,886
She tortured them, trying to get info

939
01:21:30,471 --> 01:21:32,265
they did not say anything.

940
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,520
I'm very proud of being son.

941
01:21:38,063 --> 01:21:41,692
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for anyone to notice yet

942
01:21:47,989 --> 01:21:50,242
We will make them proud, Neville.

943
01:21:50,617 --> 01:21:52,036
That is a promise.

944
01:21:56,789 --> 01:22:01,502
Make it a part of your memory, to be
the happiest thing to remember

945
01:22:01,502 --> 01:22:03,881
Keep trying, Simas.

946
01:22:04,465 --> 01:22:06,132
Right, it's your time now.

947
01:22:06,425 --> 01:22:08,301
Expecto Patronum!

948
01:22:08,676 --> 01:22:12,139
A fully proto is the
most difficult to achieve

949
01:22:12,139 --> 01:22:16,769
A shield form's also been equally used

950
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,813
Fantastic Gina.

951
01:22:20,189 --> 01:22:24,693
Just remember, it can protect
you as long as you're focus

952
01:22:24,693 --> 01:22:26,194
Just concentrate Luna.

953
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:33,534
- Think of happy things.
- Expecto Patronum.

954
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:37,038
I'm trying - I know, you're doing good

955
01:22:37,831 --> 01:22:41,835
This is a very advanced sorcery people,
and you all are doing fine

956
01:23:27,381 --> 01:23:29,257
I'll make short work of it

957
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:32,720
Hello Potter

958
01:23:33,011 --> 01:23:33,845
Maxim bombard!

959
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,198
Get them

960
01:23:53,323 --> 01:23:56,577
I've been watching them for weeks.
Assembling Dumbledore's Army

961
01:23:57,118 --> 01:24:00,413
Proved, that's what I've been
telling you right from the beginning

962
01:24:01,957 --> 01:24:05,085
All your fear's coming back, you
know who, this isnt just all of it

963
01:24:06,127 --> 01:24:08,588
We saw your lies for what they where.

964
01:24:08,796 --> 01:24:12,091
A smoke screen for your attempt
to seek control of the Ministry.

965
01:24:12,216 --> 01:24:13,636
Naturally - No Professor

966
01:24:13,761 --> 01:24:15,511
He had nothing to do with that,
it was me

967
01:24:15,845 --> 01:24:18,056
Most noble of you Harry trying to
suit me

968
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,643
As it's pointed out,
the name clearly says:

969
01:24:21,225 --> 01:24:23,729
Dumbledores army,
not Potters.

970
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:26,649
I instructed Harry to
form this organization.

971
01:24:26,856 --> 01:24:30,819
And I, i alone i'm responsible
for the activities.

972
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:32,904
Send an owl to the Daily Prophet.

973
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:35,323
If we hurry we'll still make
the morning edition.

974
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:40,119
Dolores, Saveboat, you'll
escort Dumbledore...

975
01:24:40,662 --> 01:24:42,163
To Azkaban.

976
01:24:43,207 --> 01:24:48,087
To await trial for
conspiracy and seducing.

977
01:24:48,252 --> 01:24:51,256
Ahh.. I thought it might
hit this little snag

978
01:24:53,007 --> 01:24:56,552
You seem to be laboring under the
illusion, that i'll be going to...

979
01:24:56,845 --> 01:24:58,389
What is the frase?

980
01:24:58,596 --> 01:25:00,099
Come Quietly,

981
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:01,891
Well i can tell you this...

982
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:05,229
I've no intention of going to Azkaban

983
01:25:05,229 --> 01:25:06,396
You'll...!

984
01:25:06,771 --> 01:25:08,023
Get him!

985
01:25:23,122 --> 01:25:24,957
You may not like this minister,

986
01:25:25,623 --> 01:25:27,417
but you can't deny...

987
01:25:28,543 --> 01:25:30,628
Dumbledore's got style

988
01:25:49,856 --> 01:25:52,109
Dolores UMBRIDGE SUBSTITTUl
TARGET DUMBLEDORE...

989
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:54,235
LIKE DIRECTOR OF THE SCHOOL OF HOGWARTS.

990
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:59,490
Boys and girls can't get closer
then 8 inches of each other

991
01:25:59,824 --> 01:26:03,912
The ones that want to join me in
the Brigade Inquisitorial...

992
01:26:04,203 --> 01:26:07,832
Should repress several illicit activities.

993
01:26:20,429 --> 01:26:21,680
Watch out!

994
01:26:21,805 --> 01:26:22,972
Please

995
01:27:23,533 --> 01:27:24,618
Harry.

996
01:27:32,126 --> 01:27:33,585
You did all you could.

997
01:27:33,877 --> 01:27:35,878
Nobody could go against the
old hag.

998
01:27:35,878 --> 01:27:38,047
Even Dumbledore didn't see it coming

999
01:27:39,007 --> 01:27:41,217
Harry, if it's anyone's faults it's ours

1000
01:27:41,592 --> 01:27:43,345
Yea you would say that.

1001
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,221
But I agreed.

1002
01:27:46,222 --> 01:27:49,935
I tried so hard to help but managed
to make things worse.

1003
01:27:52,729 --> 01:27:54,605
Well It don't matter anymore.

1004
01:27:56,065 --> 01:28:00,112
Because I don't want to play
anymore i cared too much.

1005
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:03,032
The more you care the more you lose.

1006
01:28:03,573 --> 01:28:06,034
- Maybe this is better.
- Then what?

1007
01:28:09,203 --> 01:28:10,622
It goes alone.

1008
01:28:17,378 --> 01:28:18,671
Hagrid.

1009
01:28:21,634 --> 01:28:23,719
what is he doing?
where are you taking us?

1010
01:28:24,511 --> 01:28:26,764
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

1011
01:28:36,148 --> 01:28:38,399
I never seen the centaurs so worried

1012
01:28:38,817 --> 01:28:40,903
They're dangerous enough
when they sit tight

1013
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,157
If the ministry restricts
their territories once more...

1014
01:28:45,157 --> 01:28:47,701
they're going to have a full uprising
on there hands.

1015
01:28:47,701 --> 01:28:49,161
Hagrid, what's going on?

1016
01:28:49,286 --> 01:28:51,997
I'm sorry to be so mysterious

1017
01:28:51,997 --> 01:28:54,041
I won't be bothering
you at all with that...

1018
01:28:54,582 --> 01:28:56,126
With Dumbledore gone...

1019
01:28:57,502 --> 01:29:00,546
And getting the sack any day now

1020
01:29:00,965 --> 01:29:04,259
Well I just couldn't leave
without telling somebody about it

1021
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:08,972
Grope!

1022
01:29:11,934 --> 01:29:13,810
Down here, you great baboon

1023
01:29:20,359 --> 01:29:21,402
Grope.

1024
01:29:22,903 --> 01:29:24,529
I brought you some company.

1025
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:39,086
I couldn't just leave him because...

1026
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:41,337
because he is my brother.

1027
01:29:41,462 --> 01:29:42,672
Wow!

1028
01:29:42,881 --> 01:29:44,507
Half brother realy

1029
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:47,720
He is completely harmless as i said

1030
01:29:48,804 --> 01:29:50,346
I thought it to him!

1031
01:29:51,597 --> 01:29:54,393
Grope that's not polite - Please do something

1032
01:29:54,393 --> 01:29:56,561
We talked about this,
you don't just grab?

1033
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,980
She's your new friend,
Hermione

1034
01:29:59,355 --> 01:30:00,440
Grope!

1035
01:30:04,903 --> 01:30:06,113
Grope!

1036
01:30:08,448 --> 01:30:10,408
Put me down

1037
01:30:15,163 --> 01:30:16,332
Now!

1038
01:30:28,217 --> 01:30:29,552
You're allright?

1039
01:30:31,471 --> 01:30:35,475
Fine, he just has a firm hand, that's all

1040
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,020
I think you've got an admirer

1041
01:30:41,023 --> 01:30:43,149
You just stay away from her, all right?

1042
01:31:14,097 --> 01:31:16,100
He gets his own food and all

1043
01:31:17,976 --> 01:31:21,104
It's company he needs when I'm gone

1044
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:24,274
You'll look after him, wont you?

1045
01:31:25,317 --> 01:31:27,694
I'm the only family he's got.

1046
01:31:39,957 --> 01:31:41,833
Feeling sentimental?

1047
01:31:45,045 --> 01:31:48,256
That's privat

1048
01:31:48,631 --> 01:31:52,219
Not to me and not to the dark lord
if you don't improve

1049
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:57,224
Every memory he has access to
is what he wants and he'll use it

1050
01:31:57,224 --> 01:32:02,604
As a weapon against you, you wont
last 2 seconds if he invates your mind

1051
01:32:04,064 --> 01:32:05,899
Youre just like your father.

1052
01:32:06,899 --> 01:32:08,527
Lazy, arrogant

1053
01:32:08,527 --> 01:32:10,612
Don't say a word against my father

1054
01:32:10,612 --> 01:32:12,280
- You're weak!
- I'm not weak!

1055
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,614
Then prove it

1056
01:32:13,865 --> 01:32:18,078
Control your emotions,
discipline your mind

1057
01:32:21,914 --> 01:32:23,207
Legilimens.

1058
01:32:30,466 --> 01:32:31,550
Harry.

1059
01:32:31,591 --> 01:32:32,760
Sirius!

1060
01:32:34,094 --> 01:32:35,386
Touching.

1061
01:32:35,845 --> 01:32:37,014
Stop it.

1062
01:32:38,056 --> 01:32:40,309
Is this what you call, control?

1063
01:32:40,725 --> 01:32:43,186
We've been practising for
hours, can we just rest?

1064
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:47,149
The dark lord isn't resting

1065
01:32:47,774 --> 01:32:49,234
You're just like him, you're 2 of a kind

1066
01:32:49,275 --> 01:32:53,113
Sentimental children,
do a little whining...

1067
01:32:53,154 --> 01:32:55,740
About how bitterly unfair
your lives have been

1068
01:32:55,740 --> 01:32:59,161
It may have escaped
unnoticed, but life isn't fair

1069
01:32:59,203 --> 01:33:03,207
Your pleased father knew that
in fact he frequently...

1070
01:33:03,207 --> 01:33:06,752
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1071
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:09,046
- Legil...
- I protect!

1072
01:33:14,717 --> 01:33:16,220
Let's go, Rabicho.

1073
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:17,261
Snape!

1074
01:33:17,554 --> 01:33:18,930
Expelliarmus.

1075
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:20,932
- Good, Tiago.
- Good, Tiago, continues!

1076
01:33:20,932 --> 01:33:21,891
Father.

1077
01:33:21,891 --> 01:33:23,018
Offside.

1078
01:33:23,018 --> 01:33:25,395
- Snotty!
- Snotty!

1079
01:33:25,395 --> 01:33:26,479
Right.

1080
01:33:26,521 --> 01:33:28,899
Who it wants to see me take
the pants of the Snotty.

1081
01:33:31,234 --> 01:33:32,444
Enough!

1082
01:33:34,404 --> 01:33:35,572
Enough!

1083
01:33:44,581 --> 01:33:47,292
Your lesson has gone to an end

1084
01:33:47,376 --> 01:33:48,627
It's not...

1085
01:33:48,836 --> 01:33:51,337
Get out!

1086
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:11,942
- What is your name?
- Michael.

1087
01:34:11,942 --> 01:34:13,735
Your hand is going to be good.

1088
01:34:13,902 --> 01:34:16,113
The ink is not as bad as it seems.

1089
01:34:16,363 --> 01:34:18,823
See? it is already vanishing.

1090
01:34:19,283 --> 01:34:21,076
Hardly can see ours

1091
01:34:21,493 --> 01:34:23,703
And the pain stops after a time.

1092
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:31,086
As I told you once before Mr. Potter,

1093
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,797
Naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1094
01:34:38,761 --> 01:34:40,011
You know Jorge...

1095
01:34:40,179 --> 01:34:43,806
I've always thought a
picture outside the world

1096
01:34:44,057 --> 01:34:47,935
Fred, I think exactly the same

1097
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:49,938
"OWL Examinations"

1098
01:34:51,939 --> 01:34:53,942
REGULATION 572 OF THE MAGIC
USE. ONLY NAVY BLUE INK

1099
01:36:12,354 --> 01:36:13,479
There it goes!

1100
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:41,257
I'm ready when you are

1101
01:38:05,759 --> 01:38:08,554
I need that prophecy.

1102
01:38:08,886 --> 01:38:11,015
You're gonna've to kill me

1103
01:38:12,432 --> 01:38:13,391
I will

1104
01:38:13,391 --> 01:38:15,935
But 1st you have to help me

1105
01:38:34,329 --> 01:38:35,456
Sirius.

1106
01:38:35,997 --> 01:38:38,125
Harry, are you sure? - I saw it

1107
01:38:38,207 --> 01:38:39,835
It was like with Mr. Weasley.

1108
01:38:39,835 --> 01:38:42,128
It's the same door I've
been dreaming about...

1109
01:38:42,128 --> 01:38:43,963
I just couldn't remember
where I've seen it before

1110
01:38:43,963 --> 01:38:46,550
Sirius said Voldermort
asked for something

1111
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:48,344
Something he didn't know how to ask

1112
01:38:48,344 --> 01:38:51,471
- And it is in the Mysteries Department.
- Harry, please listen.

1113
01:38:53,431 --> 01:38:55,643
What if Voldermort made you see this?

1114
01:38:56,726 --> 01:38:57,394
He's using Sirius because
he's trying to get you

1115
01:38:59,479 --> 01:39:03,192
What if he is? I'm supposed
to just let him die?

1116
01:39:03,817 --> 01:39:06,612
Hermione, he's the only
family I've got left

1117
01:39:10,198 --> 01:39:11,574
what we will do?

1118
01:39:12,368 --> 01:39:14,243
We will use Flu's Chain.

1119
01:39:14,243 --> 01:39:16,579
But Umbridge is watching
all the chimneys.

1120
01:39:16,622 --> 01:39:17,914
Not all.

1121
01:39:20,917 --> 01:39:22,293
It's unlocked.

1122
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:35,556
Warn the others

1123
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,184
You pirou? We go with you.

1124
01:39:37,184 --> 01:39:38,685
It's to dangerous.

1125
01:39:39,603 --> 01:39:43,481
When are you gonna get it through
your head?

1126
01:39:43,481 --> 01:39:46,025
I Bet you are.

1127
01:39:46,777 --> 01:39:49,238
Potter's trying to
help the Weasley girl.

1128
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:56,119
You were going to
Dumbledore, weren't you?

1129
01:39:56,119 --> 01:39:57,328
Liar!

1130
01:39:57,662 --> 01:39:59,872
You sent for me director?

1131
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,166
Snape, yes.

1132
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:04,586
The time has come for him to answers
whether he wants to or not.

1133
01:40:05,003 --> 01:40:06,630
You bring the serum of truth?

1134
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:10,341
I'm afraid you've used i all up
on the rest of students.

1135
01:40:10,341 --> 01:40:12,302
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1136
01:40:17,099 --> 01:40:18,975
Unless you wish to poison
him, I assure you...

1137
01:40:18,975 --> 01:40:22,354
I would have the greatest
sympathy if you did.

1138
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:25,399
I can't help you.

1139
01:40:28,234 --> 01:40:30,112
He caught Petfoot.

1140
01:40:31,113 --> 01:40:34,115
He has Petfoot at the
place where he's hiding.

1141
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:36,618
Petfoot? Who is Petfoot?

1142
01:40:36,618 --> 01:40:38,537
What is it? What is he
talking about, Snape?

1143
01:40:45,793 --> 01:40:47,212
Nore do i.

1144
01:40:52,216 --> 01:40:53,385
Very well

1145
01:40:54,927 --> 01:40:56,680
Oh, you got no choice, Potter.

1146
01:40:57,765 --> 01:41:00,475
As this is an issue
of Ministry Security,

1147
01:41:00,684 --> 01:41:05,146
you leave me with no alternative.

1148
01:41:06,564 --> 01:41:08,900
The Cruciatas Curse will
be used on your tongue.

1149
01:41:08,942 --> 01:41:10,194
That's illegal.

1150
01:41:10,194 --> 01:41:13,655
What Fudge doesn't know won't hurt him.

1151
01:41:21,037 --> 01:41:22,372
Tell her Harry!

1152
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:25,376
tell me the what?

1153
01:41:26,835 --> 01:41:30,965
Well, if you're not telling
her where it is, I will.

1154
01:41:32,006 --> 01:41:33,550
Where what is?

1155
01:41:35,301 --> 01:41:36,886
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1156
01:41:42,643 --> 01:41:45,229
- How much further?
- Not far

1157
01:41:45,854 --> 01:41:50,525
Had to be, so students
wouldn't find it in anyway.

1158
01:41:55,154 --> 01:41:57,949
- what you doing?
- Improvising.

1159
01:42:07,333 --> 01:42:08,543
Well?

1160
01:42:10,128 --> 01:42:11,755
Where is this weapon?

1161
01:42:16,176 --> 01:42:19,012
There is no weapon, is there?

1162
01:42:22,474 --> 01:42:24,268
You tried to trick me

1163
01:42:28,939 --> 01:42:31,108
Just you know...

1164
01:42:32,025 --> 01:42:35,738
I hate children.

1165
01:42:49,877 --> 01:42:51,920
You have no Business here, Centaur

1166
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,713
This is a Ministry matter.

1167
01:42:57,134 --> 01:43:00,386
Lower your weapons, I warn you.

1168
01:43:00,595 --> 01:43:04,725
Under the law, as creatures
of mere human intelligence...

1169
01:43:06,393 --> 01:43:09,938
How dare you, filthy crossbreed

1170
01:43:10,396 --> 01:43:11,981
Incarcerous!

1171
01:43:23,868 --> 01:43:26,663
Please Stop, please

1172
01:43:26,663 --> 01:43:28,039
Please

1173
01:43:28,039 --> 01:43:29,332
Not enough!

1174
01:43:29,582 --> 01:43:31,877
I will have order!

1175
01:43:47,434 --> 01:43:49,811
Stop, it is not his fault!

1176
01:43:50,436 --> 01:43:52,314
He don't understand.

1177
01:43:59,154 --> 01:44:00,698
Potter, do something

1178
01:44:00,738 --> 01:44:02,783
Talk for them who I
did not do for hardly!

1179
01:44:02,783 --> 01:44:06,662
I'm sorry, Professor.
I must not tell lies.

1180
01:44:06,662 --> 01:44:08,079
what are doing?

1181
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:12,501
I am Under-Secretary Dolores Umbridge.

1182
01:44:12,542 --> 01:44:14,502
Let me go

1183
01:44:17,588 --> 01:44:18,841
Thanks, Grope.

1184
01:44:19,675 --> 01:44:22,344
Hermione, Hermione, Sirius.

1185
01:44:30,269 --> 01:44:31,895
How did you get away?

1186
01:44:31,895 --> 01:44:33,980
The puking pastille. It wasn't pretty.

1187
01:44:34,314 --> 01:44:36,608
I told them I was hungry
and wanted some sweets.

1188
01:44:36,649 --> 01:44:39,360
Of course they tell me to bug off.

1189
01:44:40,029 --> 01:44:41,363
Very smart, Rony.

1190
01:44:42,405 --> 01:44:43,532
- Sometimes I am.
- It was brilliant!

1191
01:44:43,698 --> 01:44:47,077
He was brilliant. So,
how're we getting to London?

1192
01:44:48,494 --> 01:44:51,414
Look, it's not I don't
appreciate everything you've done.

1193
01:44:51,539 --> 01:44:54,792
But, I got you into
enough trouble as it is.

1194
01:44:57,921 --> 01:44:58,631
Dumbledore's army is supposed
to be doing something real.

1195
01:44:59,047 --> 01:45:00,923
Or were they just words for you?

1196
01:45:03,176 --> 01:45:05,804
Maybe you don't have to
do this all by yourself.

1197
01:45:09,475 --> 01:45:11,351
So how are we going to get to London?

1198
01:45:12,935 --> 01:45:14,563
Flying it is clear.

1199
01:46:07,365 --> 01:46:09,618
Mysteries department.

1200
01:46:18,502 --> 01:46:20,671
This is it.

1201
01:47:14,224 --> 01:47:18,854
92, 93, 94, 95.

1202
01:47:33,868 --> 01:47:35,328
It should be here.

1203
01:47:35,953 --> 01:47:37,163
Harry.

1204
01:47:39,082 --> 01:47:40,833
This has your name on it.

1205
01:48:06,275 --> 01:48:10,989
The one with the power marches
to vanish the Dark Lord.

1206
01:48:11,698 --> 01:48:14,618
And the Dark Lord shall
name him the same.

1207
01:48:14,618 --> 01:48:17,621
But he'll show him the
power of the Dark Lord.

1208
01:48:23,002 --> 01:48:27,588
Neither one could live
or the other one survives.

1209
01:48:28,881 --> 01:48:29,966
Harry!

1210
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,978
Where is Sirius?

1211
01:48:41,185 --> 01:48:43,564
You better wish you could
tell the difference...

1212
01:48:43,939 --> 01:48:50,945
between dreams... and reality.

1213
01:48:53,032 --> 01:48:57,411
You saw only what the Dark
Lord wanted you to see.

1214
01:48:58,703 --> 01:49:00,497
Now give me to Prophecy.

1215
01:49:00,538 --> 01:49:02,457
If you're ready to toss, I'll break it.

1216
01:49:05,461 --> 01:49:07,421
He knows how to play.

1217
01:49:07,755 --> 01:49:12,342
Itty bitty baby... Potter.

1218
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:15,637
It is Belatrix Lestrange.

1219
01:49:15,970 --> 01:49:17,597
It is Neville Longbottom, he?

1220
01:49:18,306 --> 01:49:22,101
- How will be their parents?
- Better now that will be avenged.

1221
01:49:24,395 --> 01:49:29,359
Everybody just calm down, can we?

1222
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:33,905
All we want is that prophecy.

1223
01:49:33,905 --> 01:49:36,408
Why did Voldermort made
me to come and get this?

1224
01:49:36,408 --> 01:49:38,202
You dare speak his name.

1225
01:49:39,328 --> 01:49:41,246
You filthy halfbreed.

1226
01:49:41,246 --> 01:49:45,042
It's all right. He's
just a curious child.

1227
01:49:45,876 --> 01:49:51,047
Prophecy can only be retrieved
by those who know it.

1228
01:49:51,547 --> 01:49:53,884
Which is lucky for you, really.

1229
01:49:58,305 --> 01:50:00,431
Already we asked these questions

1230
01:50:00,724 --> 01:50:05,645
What was the riesen of the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1231
01:50:06,814 --> 01:50:12,194
Why he was unable to kill
you when you're just infant?

1232
01:50:14,445 --> 01:50:19,158
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1233
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:24,747
All the answers are there,
Potter, in your hand.

1234
01:50:26,082 --> 01:50:30,087
All you have to do is give it to me.

1235
01:50:31,046 --> 01:50:33,381
I can show you everything.

1236
01:50:41,097 --> 01:50:42,975
I've waited 14 years.

1237
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,935
I know.

1238
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:47,895
I think I can wait a little more.

1239
01:50:47,895 --> 01:50:49,105
Now!

1240
01:50:49,105 --> 01:50:50,356
- Estupefaзa!
- Estupefaзa!

1241
01:51:06,957 --> 01:51:08,292
*

1242
01:51:14,672 --> 01:51:16,550
Petrificus Totalus.

1243
01:51:16,759 --> 01:51:18,135
Very good, Neville.

1244
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:28,561
Estupefaзa!

1245
01:51:30,396 --> 01:51:32,358
- Estupefaзa!
- Estupefaзa!

1246
01:51:42,951 --> 01:51:44,243
Estupefaзa!

1247
01:51:52,586 --> 01:51:54,003
Reducto!

1248
01:52:10,688 --> 01:52:12,523
We will come back for the door!

1249
01:52:46,931 --> 01:52:48,475
Mysteries department.

1250
01:52:49,018 --> 01:52:50,978
They chose the right name, it?

1251
01:52:56,692 --> 01:52:58,027
Voices...

1252
01:52:59,153 --> 01:53:00,738
They understand what they are telling?

1253
01:53:02,823 --> 01:53:07,286
No one's heard any voices,
Harry. Let's get out of here.

1254
01:53:07,744 --> 01:53:09,412
I also hear them

1255
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:15,210
Harry, that's just an empty walkway.

1256
01:53:17,962 --> 01:53:19,297
Please, Harry!

1257
01:53:20,131 --> 01:53:21,591
Get behind me!

1258
01:54:07,805 --> 01:54:10,056
Did you actually believe...

1259
01:54:10,599 --> 01:54:14,353
that you're brave enough and..

1260
01:54:15,311 --> 01:54:21,109
You children stand a chance against us?

1261
01:54:25,613 --> 01:54:29,243
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1262
01:54:32,078 --> 01:54:35,666
Give me the Prophecy now.

1263
01:54:36,708 --> 01:54:40,587
Or watch your friends... die!

1264
01:54:53,975 --> 01:54:57,020
Do not give it to him, Harry!

1265
01:55:20,627 --> 01:55:22,880
Get away from my Godson.

1266
01:55:53,827 --> 01:55:56,956
Listen to me, you just
get everyone out of here.

1267
01:55:56,997 --> 01:55:59,082
Do what? No. I'm going to stay with you.

1268
01:55:59,082 --> 01:56:01,460
Harry, you turned out beautifully.

1269
01:56:02,293 --> 01:56:04,171
Lets take care of it for now.

1270
01:56:32,573 --> 01:56:33,742
Expelliarmus!

1271
01:56:34,076 --> 01:56:35,327
Very good, Tiago!

1272
01:56:42,835 --> 01:56:44,168
Avra Kadavra!

1273
01:57:31,257 --> 01:57:33,676
I killed Sirius Black!

1274
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:36,220
Did you come to catch me

1275
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:37,514
Crucio!

1276
01:57:49,484 --> 01:57:51,904
You want me, Harry.

1277
01:57:52,863 --> 01:57:56,992
She killed him. She deserves it.

1278
01:58:00,621 --> 01:58:03,039
You know the sorcery, Harry.

1279
01:58:15,260 --> 01:58:16,386
Do!

1280
01:58:24,853 --> 01:58:26,980
So weak.

1281
01:58:34,738 --> 01:58:37,365
It was foolish of you to
come here tonight, Tom.

1282
01:58:38,033 --> 01:58:40,286
aurores are already on way.

1283
01:58:40,286 --> 01:58:42,371
When they arrive, I
already will have party.

1284
01:58:42,578 --> 01:58:43,872
And you...

1285
01:58:45,873 --> 01:58:47,376
I will be dead.

1286
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:05,430
You lost, gaffer.

1287
02:01:24,073 --> 02:01:26,034
Harry.

1288
02:01:27,953 --> 02:01:29,329
So weak.

1289
02:01:30,204 --> 02:01:32,123
So vulnerable.

1290
02:01:37,003 --> 02:01:39,340
Look at me.

1291
02:01:40,798 --> 02:01:42,926
Harry, it isn't who you were like.

1292
02:01:44,677 --> 02:01:47,640
It's who you are not.

1293
02:01:51,143 --> 02:01:53,186
Harry.

1294
02:02:26,261 --> 02:02:28,055
You're the one who's weak.

1295
02:02:28,555 --> 02:02:32,184
You can't understand love or friendship.

1296
02:02:35,145 --> 02:02:37,314
I feel sorry for you.

1297
02:03:02,381 --> 02:03:05,134
You are a fool, Harry Potter.

1298
02:03:07,011 --> 02:03:10,346
And now you will lose everything.

1299
02:03:26,154 --> 02:03:28,489
He's back.

1300
02:03:41,127 --> 02:03:44,965
"Dumbledore, Potter Vindicated"

1301
02:03:45,966 --> 02:03:50,136
"Umbridge Suspended
Pending Investigation"

1302
02:03:55,809 --> 02:03:59,313
Hogwarts Headmaster Reinstated

1303
02:04:35,682 --> 02:04:40,020
I know how you feel, Harry.
No you don't

1304
02:04:44,233 --> 02:04:47,069
It's my fault.
No the fault is mine

1305
02:04:47,485 --> 02:04:50,823
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1306
02:04:51,323 --> 02:04:54,909
before Voldermort made
a connection between you.

1307
02:04:56,119 --> 02:04:58,831
I thought making a distance
for myself from you,

1308
02:04:59,122 --> 02:05:04,670
like I had all year, he'll be less tempted,
and therefor you be more protected

1309
02:05:07,797 --> 02:05:10,091
The Prophecy said:

1310
02:05:11,844 --> 02:05:14,930
Neither one could live
or the other one survives.

1311
02:05:17,056 --> 02:05:22,854
It means, one of us i's gonna
kill the other at the end.

1312
02:05:25,274 --> 02:05:26,399
Yes.

1313
02:05:27,067 --> 02:05:28,777
why didn't he tell me

1314
02:05:29,235 --> 02:05:32,238
The same reason why
you tryed to save Sirius.

1315
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:34,742
Same as your friends helping to
save you.

1316
02:05:36,368 --> 02:05:39,162
After all these years,
after all you've suffered,

1317
02:05:39,203 --> 02:05:41,039
I didn't wanna cause you anymore pain.

1318
02:05:44,417 --> 02:05:46,420
I worry too much about you.

1319
02:06:11,694 --> 02:06:13,572
Why aren't you at the party? *****

1320
02:06:14,113 --> 02:06:15,990
I lost all my things.

1321
02:06:16,367 --> 02:06:19,036
Probably people have been hiding them.

1322
02:06:19,036 --> 02:06:20,287
That is horrible.

1323
02:06:20,287 --> 02:06:21,622
It's only a joke.

1324
02:06:22,206 --> 02:06:25,167
But since this is the last night,
I really do need them back.

1325
02:06:25,833 --> 02:06:27,670
You want me to help search?

1326
02:06:31,297 --> 02:06:33,801
I'm sorry about your Godfather, Harry.

1327
02:06:41,516 --> 02:06:43,810
You sure you don't
want any help looking?

1328
02:06:43,851 --> 02:06:45,270
All right

1329
02:06:45,604 --> 02:06:48,189
Anyway, my mom always said...

1330
02:06:48,189 --> 02:06:51,734
Things we lose have a way
coming back to us in the end.

1331
02:06:55,363 --> 02:06:57,949
Not always in the way we expect.

1332
02:07:00,034 --> 02:07:02,037
I think I am going to eat pudding.

1333
02:07:36,779 --> 02:07:39,324
I've been thinking about
what Dumbledore said to me.

1334
02:07:40,993 --> 02:07:42,161
What's that?

1335
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:45,622
The thing about fighting battles,

1336
02:07:46,122 --> 02:07:48,792
We've got one thing
Voldermort doesn't have.

1337
02:07:49,501 --> 02:07:50,586
Yea?

1338
02:07:52,962 --> 02:07:55,841
Something worth fighting for.

1339
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,090
