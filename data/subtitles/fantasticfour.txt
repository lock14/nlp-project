1
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,681
<i>Typical of Victor Von Doom...</i>

2
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,683
to build a 30-foot statue
of himself.

3
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,745
Well, it's obviously aimed at first-time visitors
to create feelings of smallness...

4
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:39,757
inadequacy.

5
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,021
Good thing
it ain't workin'.

6
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:46,825
Reed, what are we doing here?
This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science.

7
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:49,332
This wasn't our first stop,
in case you forgot.

8
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:54,031
Besides, Victor's not that bad.
He's just a little... larger than life.

9
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:08,044
- Hi, Reed Richards and Ben Grimm-
- Executive elevator. Top floor.

10
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,890
What's it take to get
a smile around this joint?

11
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,987
<i>Von Doom Industries, at the forefront...</i>

12
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,227
<i>of aerospace technology
and biomedical engineering-</i>

13
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,770
<i>The unparalleled leader
in government defense systems.</i>

14
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,771
<i>My research suggests...</i>

15
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:30,274
that exposure to
a high-energy cosmic storm...

16
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,276
borne
on solar winds...

17
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,676
might have triggered the evolution
of early planetary life.

18
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,288
In six weeks
another cloud...

19
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:38,796
In six weeks another cloud...

20
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,800
with the same elemental profile...

21
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,199
will pass Earth's orbit.

22
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:45,204
A study, conducted in space...

23
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,206
could fundamentally advance
our knowledge...

24
00:03:47,308 --> 00:03:49,436
about the structure
of the human genome...

25
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:51,512
<i>cure countless diseases,
extend human life...</i>

26
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:55,070
<i>give kids a chance to live longer,
stronger, healthier-</i>

27
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,674
<i>Turn it off. Please.</i>

28
00:03:57,786 --> 00:04:00,754
- I don't think I've explained my proposal fully.
- No, I think you have.

29
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,622
Same old Reed- always stretching,
reaching for the stars...

30
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:06,626
with the weight of the world
on his back.

31
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:09,526
But dreams don't pay the bills,
do they?

32
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:13,225
You remember,
when we were in school...

33
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,269
we talked about working together.

34
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,031
Well, that's what
I was about to explain.

35
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:20,768
<i>The storm is deadly...</i>

36
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,002
<i>but the shields
on your station's control room...</i>

37
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,079
<i>are designed to protect
any occupants inside.</i>

38
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:32,581
So, it's not just my money you want.
It's my toys.

39
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:37,216
<i>Tell me, if NASA doesn't trust you,
then why should I?</i>

40
00:04:40,528 --> 00:04:43,965
That's my job-
to stay a step ahead...

41
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:47,728
to know what other men don't.

42
00:04:47,836 --> 00:04:50,896
- I can't take this.
- Ben, this is business. Just work.

43
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:54,406
He's right, Ben-
It is just business.

44
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,603
<i>I think you both know
my director of genetic research...</i>

45
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,612
<i>Susan Storm.</i>

46
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,817
One more thing he's got.

47
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,012
<i>- Hey, Susie.
- Hey.</i>

48
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:10,682
Oh, it's so nice to see you.
How's Debbie?

49
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,692
- Great.
- Great.

50
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:16,661
- Uh, how have you been?
- Never better.

51
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,531
- This isn't gonna be a problem, is it?
- Oh, not at all.

52
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,762
<i>- No, I-
- Good.</i>

53
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:25,771
Then you are just in time...

54
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:27,966
to hear the great Reed Richards...

55
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:30,043
<i>ask me for help.</i>

56
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:34,779
You made a lot of folks at M.I.T.
feel like a junior high science fair...

57
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:38,283
so you'll excuse me
if I savor the moment.

58
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:40,286
You back this mission...

59
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,949
and I'll sign over a fair percentage
of any applications-

60
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:46,391
The number is 75,
and its applications and patents.

61
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:49,487
- What about his firstborn?
- Ben.

62
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:51,497
Come on.

63
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,002
Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough
to keep the lights on a while, isn't it?

64
00:05:56,103 --> 00:05:59,504
Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage
on the Baxter Building.

65
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,406
Deal?

66
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:13,083
Well, then, to our future.

67
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,158
Together.

68
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,194
It's funny how things turn out,
isn't it?

69
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:23,855
Hilarious.

70
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:29,459
He knew about NASA.
Maybe he made the call to shut us down.

71
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,471
Ben, think about all the people
we can help if this works. Huh?

72
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:35,441
Look, we got what we wanted.
That's enough.

73
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:38,911
A few days in space. It'll be great.
What's the worst that can happen?

74
00:06:43,584 --> 00:06:46,781
If Reed's right, this little trip
could double our stock offerings.

75
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:48,913
And if he's not?

76
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,855
Reed's always right.

77
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,292
Good thing he doesn't always know
what he's got.

78
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:05,038
Reed, you should know those solar winds
have been picking up speed.

79
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,471
- I factored them into my coordinates.
- Right.

80
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:09,567
Of course you did.
In theory.

81
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:12,704
- It's a little different once you're out there.
- I can assure you-

82
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:15,077
When are we leaving?

83
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,442
I'll be scheduling the launch.

84
00:07:18,552 --> 00:07:21,454
You can call me in the morning
for resources and crew.

85
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:24,047
- I think I remember the number.
- It's been changed.

86
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,293
I was hoping Ben
could pilot the mission.

87
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,562
We already have a pilot
on our payroll.

88
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,105
But you're welcome to ride shotgun.
Remember my brotherJohnny?

89
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:58,957
<i>Can't do it. Cannot do it.</i>

90
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,959
External S.R.B.'s,
orbital system engines.

91
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:03,529
- It's just like the shuttle you flew-
- No!

92
00:08:03,632 --> 00:08:06,533
- I cannot take orders from the underwear model.
- Oh, come on, now.

93
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:10,196
That wingnut washed out of NASA for
sneaking two Victoria's Secret wannabes...

94
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:12,363
into a flight simulator.

95
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:15,704
- Youthful high spirits.
- They crashed it into a wall.

96
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,675
A flight simulator.

97
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:21,146
When have I ever asked you to do something
you absolutely said you could not do?

98
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,841
Five times.

99
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:26,216
- I had it at four.
- Well, this makes five.

100
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,197
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

101
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,790
<i>Commencing launch sequence
in six hours.</i>

102
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:43,563
I miss you already, Debs.

103
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:45,503
<i>Captain on the bridge.!</i>

104
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:49,067
Digital camera- $254.

105
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:51,644
Memory stick- $59.

106
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:54,874
The look on your hard-ass
former C.O.'s face...

107
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:58,850
when he finds out he's
your junior officer- priceless.

108
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:03,220
Thank you. That's so sweet.

109
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,190
I can handle this ship.

110
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:07,658
I can even handle
Mr. Blond Ambition.

111
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:10,559
<i>But I don't know if I should be flying
or doing Swan Lake in these suits.</i>

112
00:09:10,664 --> 00:09:12,565
Who the hell came up with these?

113
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,067
Victor did.

114
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,936
The synthetics act as a second skin,
adapting to your body's individual needs.

115
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,100
<i>See, now that means it keeps
the hot stuffhot and the cool stuff cool.</i>

116
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,072
Wow. Fantastic.

117
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:30,582
Material made from self-regulating,
unstable molecules.

118
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:33,051
I've been working on
a formula for this.

119
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:37,086
Great minds think alike.

120
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,057
- Here you go, Ben.
- Thanks, sweetie.

121
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,130
<i>Reed.</i>

122
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:18,898
<i>E. T.A. until cosmic event, nine hours.</i>

123
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,900
If you're good, maybe next time
Daddy'll let you drive.

124
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:25,200
You keep talkin',
and there won't be a next time.

125
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,509
Long way
from the projection booth...

126
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,044
at the Hayden Planetarium,
isn't it?

127
00:10:34,849 --> 00:10:37,078
Yes.

128
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:39,244
Yes, it is.

129
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:44,322
We can monitor the cloud's approach
and observe the tests from here.

130
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:46,326
Is it safe?

131
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:49,419
The shields on the station
should protect us.

132
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,328
- "Should"?
- What's the matter, Ben?

133
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,834
Getting paranoid in your old age?

134
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:58,371
Let's start loading those samples.
Get your suit ready, Ben.

135
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:03,534
So I see you're still doing
all the heavy lifting.

136
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:06,636
Maybe you should have stayed in the lab.
Fieldwork never suited you.

137
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:10,774
<i>He does the talkin'.
I do the walkin'. Got it?</i>

138
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:14,154
So, take a walk, Ben.

139
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:17,655
Actually, if you'll all excuse me,
I need to borrow Susan...

140
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,522
<i>for a moment.</i>

141
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,365
Sure.

142
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:30,736
Please tell me your guy's not trying
to rekindle things with my sister again.

143
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:33,068
Of course not.
It's strictly business.

144
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:36,234
Yes, well, his eyes
say differently, don't they?

145
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:39,336
Hey. Two hearts
got busted last time.

146
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,346
Maybe she's not over it either.

147
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:43,383
Wow, Dr. Phil, that's deep.

148
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:45,884
Let's think about that.

149
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:49,479
<i>You got Victor-
more money than God, stud of the year-</i>

150
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:52,491
and you got Reed,
world's dumbest smart guy...

151
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:54,494
worth less than a postage stamp.

152
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,495
That's a real toss-up.

153
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:58,532
Don't trouble your tiny little mind.

154
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,999
Don't wander off now, boy.

155
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:05,835
<i>Securing air lock chamber.</i>

156
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,125
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

157
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:29,525
I understand the business reasons.

158
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:33,292
Well, when you're
looking at your future...

159
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,801
it doesn't hurt
to find closure about the past.

160
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:43,500
Susan, every man dreams he'll meet
a woman he can give the world to.

161
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,274
In my case,
it's not just a metaphor.

162
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:54,221
<i>Opening viewing station shield.</i>

163
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:26,409
That can't be right.

164
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,457
<i>Event threshold
in T-minus nine minutes, 47 seconds.</i>

165
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:34,254
<i>That's impossible.
It should be seven hours.</i>

166
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,332
We've been together
two years now.

167
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:42,926
It's been a good two years, Victor.

168
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:45,129
The company's accomplished so much.

169
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,730
Right. Of course. The company.

170
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,809
But I've come to realize...

171
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:53,846
that all the accomplishments in the world mean
nothing without someone to share them with.

172
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:58,647
- Um-
- I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.

173
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:02,688
- Now it's time to take the biggest step of all.
- Victor-

174
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:06,157
If it helps,
think of this as a... promotion.

175
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,524
Victor, I-

176
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,995
I have four words.

177
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,000
Four little words that can change
our lives forever.

178
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:16,297
<i>The cloud is accelerating.!</i>

179
00:14:16,403 --> 00:14:18,701
We've got minutes until it hits,
not hours.

180
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:23,139
<i>- Victor, that storm is deadly. We need to abort.
- Get a grip, Reed.</i>

181
00:14:23,244 --> 00:14:26,838
We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve
at the first glitch. Just close the shields.

182
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:28,847
- Ben is still out there.
- So reel him in.

183
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,818
<i>We came here to do a job,
so let's do it. Quickly.</i>

184
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:37,413
Victor, Reed's right.
We have less than six minutes.

185
00:14:40,028 --> 00:14:42,690
- Ben, get inside now!
- What's going on?

186
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:45,061
I ain't done arrangin'
your flowers yet, egghead.

187
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,657
<i>Ben, turn around.</i>

188
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:59,110
- Guys, I'm not gonna make it.
- You gotta jump!

189
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:01,408
<i>It's the only way.!</i>

190
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,077
<i>- What are you doing?
- Closing the shields.</i>

191
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:09,712
- You can't just leave them out there.
- Watch me.

192
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,424
You can't help them
any more than I can!

193
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:15,995
I can try.

194
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:33,605
Come on, Ben! You got this!

195
00:15:35,082 --> 00:15:37,051
Johnny, get ready to close the portal.

196
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:06,715
- You okay?
- Oh. Yeah.

197
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:12,826
Ben! Ben!

198
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:17,230
Ben!

199
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:30,441
<i>Wake up. Ben.</i>

200
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:33,449
Hey, rise and shine, big boy.
How you feeling?

201
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,679
<i>- Where am I?
- Back on Earth.</i>

202
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:39,186
We're in quarantine.
Victor's medical facility.

203
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:41,190
<i>Reed? Sue?</i>

204
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,692
Oh, they're fine.
Everybody else is fine.

205
00:17:44,795 --> 00:17:46,694
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

206
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:51,266
I swear to you, Ben, they've done
everything humanly possible.

207
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:54,769
The best plastic surgeons in the world
are here, Ben. You had the best.

208
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:58,035
<i>- Give me that mirror.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.</i>

209
00:17:58,142 --> 00:18:01,042
<i>- They said the shock alone-
- I said, give me that goddamn mirror.!</i>

210
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:04,603
Okay, Ben.
Just be strong.

211
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,935
<i>Unfortunately, the doctors just
couldn't do anything to fix your face.</i>

212
00:18:17,845 --> 00:18:20,278
Hey. Nice do.

213
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,644
Likin' the grandpa look.

214
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:24,717
What?

215
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:36,121
<i>Reporter ] You've been charged
with moving science a little too fast.</i>

216
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,060
By whom, my competitors?

217
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,963
<i>Danger is always part of this.</i>

218
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:44,298
- How's she doing?
- Stable.

219
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,234
And her vitals are strong.

220
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:49,240
Blood panels show no irradiation.
Good.

221
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:52,903
- You'll step up this protocol-
- Every four hours, yes.

222
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:54,913
We know what we're doing.

223
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,915
<i>Another day of observation, and you're all clear.</i>

224
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,757
She's allergic to orchids.
Put the sunflowers by her bed.

225
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,827
<i>They're her favorites.</i>

226
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,113
<i>Well, Victor...</i>

227
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,648
the bank would like
to congratulate you...

228
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,015
<i>on the fastest free-fall
since the Depression.</i>

229
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,681
- We can't even give your stock away.
- Ned, I can turn this around.

230
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,280
You're going to have to, Victor,
or we pull out.

231
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:45,130
- You have a week.
- You're enjoying this, aren't you, Ned?

232
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:51,537
One week.

233
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,090
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do we think we're going?</i>

234
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:26,194
<i>I don't know if we've noticed, but the sickest
runs this side of the Alps are right outside.</i>

235
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:30,333
Yeah, I've noticed. But there are rules here.
You can't leave until we-

236
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,276
Until we've finished the tests. I know.
I've never been good with rules.

237
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,940
You let me know
how those come out.

238
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,143
- Do you wanna help me with the zipper?
- This is not a ski resort.

239
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,981
Not yet.

240
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,682
Luckily, Grandma still sends care packages.
It's amazing.

241
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,281
- For an 80-year-old woman, you'd be surpri-
- You are trouble.

242
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:49,794
<i>Mmm. "Trouble"is my middle name.</i>

243
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,057
- Oh, you're hot.
- Why, thank you. So are you.

244
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,156
- And I'm not afraid to cry.
- No, I mean you feel a little feverish.

245
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:58,395
I've never felt better in my life.
My God, you smell good.

246
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:00,972
- When do you get off work?
- 4:00, but I-

247
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:04,167
Tell you what. You meet me at 4:01
at the top of the mountain.

248
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,676
That'll give you
a minute to freshen up.

249
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,974
This is yours. That's mine.

250
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:11,209
Nurses!

251
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:18,883
<i>How long was I out?</i>

252
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,892
Hey. Three days.

253
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:23,690
I was worried about you.
How are you feeling?

254
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,696
Solid.

255
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,758
Uh, it was a close one, though, huh?
What was that about?

256
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:32,701
I don't know.

257
00:21:32,806 --> 00:21:34,705
I really don't know.

258
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:38,938
I've been going over the figures again and again,
and they all add up.

259
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:41,945
I just don't understand.
Maybe I should've aborted-

260
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:45,175
Reed, it was a freak of nature.
You couldn't have possibly predicted it.

261
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:48,516
Let it go.

262
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:51,419
You know, you live through
something like this...

263
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,855
<i>it really makes you appreciate
having the right woman in your life.</i>

264
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,294
- Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect.
- I'm not talking about Debbie.

265
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,531
What? Come on.

266
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:04,432
She's got a good thing with Victor.

267
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:08,132
- He's smart, he's powerful, he's successful-
- Maybe you should date him then.

268
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,143
Ben, she ended up
with the right guy.

269
00:22:12,244 --> 00:22:15,042
Things worked out for the best.

270
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:20,311
Do I have to do everything myself?

271
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:44,342
You should stay to the right.
The left might give you trouble.

272
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:47,345
- I think we should drop, like, 10 more feet.
- Good.

273
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:49,744
Last one down
springs for room service!

274
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:52,613
Whoo-hoo!

275
00:22:57,557 --> 00:22:59,457
My future wife!

276
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:07,462
Whoo-hoo!

277
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:22,773
Whoo!

278
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:27,680
You're losing!

279
00:23:27,787 --> 00:23:30,255
All right, no more kid stuff.

280
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:33,554
Check this out!

281
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:43,363
- You're on fire!
- Thanks! You're pretty good too!

282
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:46,438
<i>No! You're on fire.! Look!</i>

283
00:23:49,142 --> 00:23:51,405
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

284
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,884
Whoa-ohh!

285
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:22,700
Care to join me?

286
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,778
I can only stay for one drink.
I have to meet Victor.

287
00:24:32,884 --> 00:24:35,580
Oh. Wouldn't want
to keep Vic waiting.

288
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:37,848
Reed, what are you doing here?

289
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:40,892
I thought-

290
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:45,061
<i>Great.!
Uh, maybe you can join us.</i>

291
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:47,689
<i>- How's the I.P.O. now?
- It's fallen.</i>

292
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,734
We're looking at low 20s.
It's a good number, considering the fallout from-

293
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:52,805
From Reed's disaster?

294
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:57,239
<i>Get me on the a. m. shows,
Larry King, cover of the Journal.</i>

295
00:24:57,343 --> 00:25:00,642
Gonna have to do something
about this scar.

296
00:25:00,747 --> 00:25:04,410
Make sure they only shoot me
from my left side.

297
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:07,417
Actually, uh, the scar's tracking well.

298
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,920
People seem to think
it humanizes you.

299
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:12,991
And that's a good thing?

300
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:19,086
Maybe you should get some rest.

301
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:21,097
Later.

302
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,599
First I have some unfinished business.

303
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,000
A deal that needs closing.

304
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:28,664
Sir, I have always wondered-
Why Sue?

305
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:31,675
<i>You could have any other woman
in the world.</i>

306
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:35,338
That's why. Because I could
have any other woman.

307
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:39,111
No, let me tell the story! Let me tell the story!

308
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:41,345
Oh-

309
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:45,583
<i>Wow.</i>

310
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:48,160
<i>You all right?</i>

311
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,194
Bad shrimp.

312
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:52,457
I think I'd better go lie down.

313
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:54,192
Excuse me.

314
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,028
Oh, God.

315
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:15,345
<i>So, are you feeling better?</i>

316
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:17,855
Yes. Thank you.

317
00:26:17,957 --> 00:26:20,356
Good.

318
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,554
That's, uh, good.

319
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:28,133
You always had a way with words.

320
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:34,305
Uh-Wow.

321
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:37,672
I should be going, 'cause, uh...

322
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:39,676
I have to meet Victor.

323
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:42,406
I'm really happy for you and Victor.

324
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:44,914
You're really happy
for me and Victor?

325
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:48,680
I can tell you guys are enjoying
what was the best part of our relationship.

326
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:50,881
- Which was?
- Passion.

327
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,756
For science.

328
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:57,557
You are such a dork, Reed.

329
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:01,190
You never got it,
and you never will.

330
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:03,996
- What did I say?
- Unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.

331
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,663
I just wanted
to let you know that I was-

332
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,708
It's been two years, and all you can say
is you're happy for me and some other guy?

333
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:12,106
<i>Victor may be a lot of things...</i>

334
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:15,112
<i>but at least he's not afraid
to fight for what he wants.</i>

335
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:18,444
It's nice to be wanted
sometimes, Reed...

336
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:23,619
to be seen and heard.

337
00:27:25,324 --> 00:27:27,291
Look at me.

338
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,728
I can't.

339
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,923
- What do you mean, you can't? Look at me!
- Sue, look at your hands.

340
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:56,153
Hey! You guys-

341
00:27:56,255 --> 00:27:59,622
Hey. You are never gonna believe
what just happened to me.

342
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:01,817
What?

343
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:04,726
Oh. Well, I can explain this.

344
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:34,959
It has to be the cloud.
It's fundamentally altered our D.N.A.

345
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,961
Let's not jump to conclusions.

346
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:39,861
We need a massive amount of evidence
before making that leap.

347
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:41,957
<i>Whoa.! Guys, look.</i>

348
00:28:51,844 --> 00:28:55,336
<i>Now, picture that, but everywhere.!</i>

349
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,982
<i>It was everywhere.!</i>

350
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,815
What?

351
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:04,821
The cloud has fundamentally
altered our D.N.A.

352
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,289
Cool!

353
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:10,487
- And you know what, guys? I think I was flying.
- We need to find Ben.

354
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:19,470
I said cut it out,Johnny.

355
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,631
- Still getting the hang of it.
- Hey, Ben! It's Reed!

356
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,867
- Stop.
- All right.

357
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:25,534
- All right?
- Yes!

358
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,738
- God! What's wrong with you?
- God! What?

359
00:29:27,846 --> 00:29:31,009
Sue, do you know the code?

360
00:29:37,323 --> 00:29:39,018
Hey, Ben! Open up!

361
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,652
- You all right, Ben?
- Hey, does somebody have keys to these doors?

362
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,662
<i>Anybody?</i>

363
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:47,198
<i>Just break the glass.
It can't be that thick.</i>

364
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:32,305
That's gross.

365
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:39,349
<i>Ben?</i>

366
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:42,512
Look! Look, look, look, look!

367
00:30:44,222 --> 00:30:46,656
What is that thing?

368
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:52,160
<i>What's going on?
What happened in here?</i>

369
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:55,664
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine. Just a few scrapes, that's all.

370
00:30:55,768 --> 00:31:00,500
<i>Ben did this. He's had some kind of
reaction to exposure from the cloud.</i>

371
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,096
<i>We all have, um, different symptoms.</i>

372
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,108
Symptoms?

373
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:08,338
- Victor, um, I should have-
- Just find him.

374
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:13,184
Anybody got any ideas
where the big guy's going?

375
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,490
<i>He's going home.</i>

376
00:31:55,394 --> 00:31:58,989
Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me.

377
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:10,138
Little buttons! Hello, Operator?

378
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:16,776
<i>- Hello?
- Debs? It's me.</i>

379
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:20,510
Ben? Are you all right?
You sound a little different.

380
00:32:20,618 --> 00:32:23,519
- Uh, listen, I need you to come out front.
- Out front?

381
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,489
<i>You're home, baby?</i>

382
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:29,560
Yeah.

383
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:32,357
I got a surprise for you.

384
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:38,500
Yeah, I got a little one for you too.

385
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,740
<i>Ben?</i>

386
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:47,244
Where are you?

387
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:49,246
I'm over here.

388
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:52,681
Don't come any closer for a sec, okay?

389
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:56,049
<i>It's gonna-
It's gonna be a bit of a shock.</i>

390
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:58,349
Honey, what's going on?

391
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:00,823
Debs...

392
00:33:00,925 --> 00:33:03,917
remember w-when we used to say...

393
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:06,759
together forever,
no matter what?

394
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:09,266
Yeah?

395
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:13,265
Baby, you're scaring me.

396
00:33:26,986 --> 00:33:30,046
- Oh, my God.
- Deb.

397
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:33,090
It's me. It's still me.
It was the accident.

398
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:35,125
- Let me explain.
- No! Don't touch me!

399
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:38,059
Debs!

400
00:33:38,163 --> 00:33:40,290
<i>What are you doin', lady?</i>

401
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,164
<i>Hey.! I'm callin'the police.!</i>

402
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:45,827
<i>Everybody all right?</i>

403
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:48,838
<i>I saw him.! It's that guy over there.!</i>

404
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:51,432
<i>What the hell's going on out there?</i>

405
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:21,105
Oh, yeah, Ben.
A few days in space. It'll be great.

406
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:24,369
What's the worst that could happen?

407
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:29,213
Hey, little guy.

408
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:31,681
You're not afraid of me, are ya?

409
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,887
Perfect.

410
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:43,460
Thanks.

411
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:58,173
<i>Hey!</i>

412
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:02,610
- You think you got problems?
You take a good look, pal.

413
00:35:02,715 --> 00:35:05,478
Huh. How bad could it be, right?

414
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,710
I don't think you-

415
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,688
Okay, pal, take it easy.

416
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:15,657
No, no, no. Don't go out there.
I said stop, you fruitcake!

417
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,730
No, no, no. Come closer.

418
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:20,923
That's further! Come closer!

419
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:23,762
I said stop! No, no, no!

420
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,166
Whoa!

421
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,103
<i>Feet.!</i>

422
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,210
Whoa!

423
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:48,918
Come here!

424
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,311
All right.

425
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,945
Calm down.

426
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:19,422
You wanna be scared?
Fine!

427
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:32,224
- Give me a couple tow trucks.
- Get back! Get back!

428
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:35,568
<i>Get back in your vehicles.!
We'll tell you when you can go.!</i>

429
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:38,472
- What are we gonna do now?
- We're not gonna get past these guys.

430
00:36:38,577 --> 00:36:40,476
But you could.

431
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:47,349
Sorry about the truck, pal.
Come on.

432
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:51,320
<i>A little help here.
You wanna hit the button, sir?</i>

433
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,447
Stuck.

434
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,619
Sue, your clothes. Lose them.

435
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:58,286
Oh. Right.

436
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:00,661
This is so wrong.

437
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:06,795
<i>What?</i>

438
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,702
Oh!

439
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:11,275
- Wow. You've been working out.
- Shut up!

440
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:16,110
All right.

441
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,179
All right, freeze!

442
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:22,949
Now,just, uh-

443
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:25,682
just put the man
in the seat down!

444
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:28,960
Do it!

445
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:36,690
<i>Any more great ideas? Why don't you strip
down and have 100 people stare at you?</i>

446
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:38,702
<i>- Sue.
- What?</i>

447
00:37:40,072 --> 00:37:43,132
Oh. Hmph!

448
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:45,802
I'm gonna need therapy.

449
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:49,380
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

450
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,012
<i>Excuse me. Coming through.</i>

451
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:01,186
<i>Right now, uh,
just back away from him.</i>

452
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:04,525
<i>And, uh, I want you...</i>

453
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,030
<i>to put your hands
on your head right-</i>

454
00:38:13,972 --> 00:38:15,563
954 approaching scene.

455
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:18,438
- I still can't believe you made me do that.
- We got through, didn't we?

456
00:38:18,543 --> 00:38:20,443
Just find Ben.

457
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:23,947
<i>Stay back of the bridge.!</i>

458
00:38:27,286 --> 00:38:29,617
Ben! Ben!

459
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:39,130
<i>Mom.! Mom?</i>

460
00:38:53,077 --> 00:38:55,876
Whoa!

461
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,311
Stay here, okay?

462
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:29,346
<i>Coming.! Hold on.!</i>

463
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,153
No, you-

464
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:49,431
don't.

465
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,105
No!

466
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,320
<i>Hang on!</i>

467
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:21,197
- Huh?
- I got ya.

468
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:03,172
<i>This is the police.!
Get down on the ground.!</i>

469
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:05,106
<i>Don't shoot.! He's a hero.!</i>

470
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,577
<i>Get down on the ground now.!</i>

471
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,911
<i>Ben!</i>

472
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,686
Whoo-hoo!

473
00:42:26,692 --> 00:42:28,592
I swear to you...

474
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:31,094
I will do everything in my power...

475
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,596
until there is not a breath left in me-

476
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,967
You're gonna be Ben again.

477
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:44,338
<i>- How 'bout this guy?
- I don't know.</i>

478
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:47,309
<i>I tell you what-
I never seen nothin'like him before.</i>

479
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:49,208
I told you I felt fine.

480
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:53,143
Where are your ears?

481
00:42:55,987 --> 00:43:00,548
- There are some folks outside that want to talk to you.
- We're not going public.

482
00:43:00,659 --> 00:43:03,059
- We're scientists, not celebrities.
- It's too late, son.

483
00:43:04,096 --> 00:43:05,653
Look.

484
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:08,561
- When a New York Fire Department ladder truck...
- See that?

485
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:10,567
became part of the tragedy.

486
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,228
<i>But the rescue itself is not the story.</i>

487
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:15,771
<i>One of the four stretched
to an amazing length-</i>

488
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:18,706
That's what they're calling you-
the Fantastic Four.

489
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:21,244
- Cool!
- No, wait! Where are you going?

490
00:43:21,346 --> 00:43:23,074
- I'm gonna go talk to 'em.
- No!

491
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:26,708
- We should think this through.
- That's great. Brainstorm.

492
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:30,219
<i>Where is it? Left?</i>

493
00:43:30,322 --> 00:43:33,382
Get back here right now!Johnny!

494
00:43:35,193 --> 00:43:38,492
Settle down!

495
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:42,262
Do you believe this?

496
00:43:42,367 --> 00:43:44,561
- Which one of you is the leader?
- That would be me.

497
00:43:44,668 --> 00:43:47,228
No, seriously.

498
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:50,697
Okay, son, you're on.

499
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,911
Uh...

500
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:02,748
during our recent mission
to the Von Doom space station...

501
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:07,681
we were exposed to
as-yet unidentified radioactive energy.

502
00:44:07,793 --> 00:44:09,851
- What happened on the bridge?
- How can you stretch?

503
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,929
- Is it true you can fly?
- Yeah, I'm working on it. It's actually difficult-

504
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:16,090
No, actually, we do not know
much more than you do at this point.

505
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:20,467
Uh, sir, Larry King just canceled.

506
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:22,972
Apparently there's a bigger story.

507
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:24,768
NASDAQ was up 9.9-

508
00:44:24,876 --> 00:44:27,639
Bravest-
Actually, here they come now.

509
00:44:27,746 --> 00:44:30,077
<i>You had to see it
to believe it, folks. The man-</i>

510
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:31,876
named the Fantastic Four-

511
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:34,884
We will be going directly to our lab
to diagnose our symptoms.

512
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:36,976
<i>Symptoms? Is this some kind of disease?</i>

513
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:39,454
No! No, no, no.
It's not a disease.

514
00:44:39,557 --> 00:44:44,153
Symptoms? If having special powers
is a disease, then, yeah, we got it bad.

515
00:44:44,262 --> 00:44:46,389
Excuse me.
That thing doesn't look so fantastic.

516
00:44:46,498 --> 00:44:48,398
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero.

517
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,967
What he means is,
every team needs a mascot.

518
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:53,833
A new day is dawning.

519
00:44:53,938 --> 00:44:56,737
<i>The day of the Fantastic Four.!</i>

520
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:03,978
<i>Look- Look, we went up to space
to find a way to understand D.N.A...</i>

521
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:07,847
<i>cure disease, save lives.</i>

522
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:12,788
Well, now it's our D.N.A.,
our "disease," our lives on the line.

523
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:15,018
Thank you.
No more questions.

524
00:45:16,728 --> 00:45:19,094
This is how you turn things around?

525
00:45:19,197 --> 00:45:21,097
These freaks on the front page...

526
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,463
your company's in the obituaries?

527
00:45:23,568 --> 00:45:26,469
<i>- I was planning to use the publicity-
- The board's in agreement.</i>

528
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,539
- The bank's lost enough already.
- Wait a minute.

529
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:31,768
It's too late, Victor.

530
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:35,539
Do you know how much money
I've invested in this company?

531
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:38,480
Victor, stop.
This isn't a negotiation.

532
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:40,983
<i>It's a notification.</i>

533
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:43,054
<i>We're pulling out.</i>

534
00:46:24,762 --> 00:46:27,231
Is all that for you, Dr. Richards?

535
00:46:27,331 --> 00:46:28,856
I'm afraid so.

536
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:35,233
Come on, Ben. Smile.
They wanna like you, bud. Say hi.

537
00:46:37,775 --> 00:46:41,007
Uh, don't do drugs!

538
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,619
Welcome back to the Baxter,
Dr. Richards.

539
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:57,751
I've got the usual for you.

540
00:46:57,862 --> 00:47:01,126
- Good to have you back, sir.
- Thanks, Willie.

541
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:05,034
We had a tough year.

542
00:47:05,135 --> 00:47:07,934
Yeah, like, nine straight.

543
00:47:20,585 --> 00:47:23,485
Either we're moving
really fast or not at all.

544
00:47:31,396 --> 00:47:33,489
I'll take the stairs.

545
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,942
How come Ben can't turn it
on and off like we can?

546
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:48,807
That's what we're here to find out.

547
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:53,315
- If it happened to him- - What? You mean,
like, we won't be able to turn it off either?

548
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:57,148
- That would save time. Ha!
- You wanna walk around on fire the rest of your life?

549
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:59,849
- Is that a trick question?
- Grow up.

550
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,653
Come on. Am I the only guy
who thinks this is cool?

551
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,663
We should stay here until we can
define the extent of our changes...

552
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:10,166
and figure out how to reverse them.

553
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:12,168
Whoa.

554
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:14,670
<i>Believe it or not, he lives here.</i>

555
00:48:14,773 --> 00:48:19,141
<i>But I have to warn you,
it's gonna be a little crowded in some areas.</i>

556
00:48:22,547 --> 00:48:26,005
So, what do you think?

557
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:28,016
I don't know, Reed.

558
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:31,019
I think you might be bringing
your work home with you.

559
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:35,023
Come on. Let me show
you guys where you'll be staying.

560
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:36,922
Busy guy.

561
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:43,965
- Hi, everybody.
- Mr. Von Doom!

562
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:46,663
Would you like to comment
on the recent failure of your I.P.O.?

563
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:48,739
<i>What about the rumors of a takeover?</i>

564
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,987
<i>God, I was so worried about you.</i>

565
00:49:12,097 --> 00:49:13,826
<i>Victor.</i>

566
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:17,833
- I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to call.
- Please.

567
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:20,666
<i>No apologies.</i>

568
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:23,831
I've arranged for your things
to be moved to one of my condos.

569
00:49:23,942 --> 00:49:26,239
- You'll have round-the-clock care.
- Thank you.

570
00:49:26,344 --> 00:49:30,838
That's very generous of you, but I think
I should stay here with my brother...

571
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:32,746
until we get a handle on things.

572
00:49:32,851 --> 00:49:35,581
Susan, I think you should
let my doctors have a look at you.

573
00:49:35,686 --> 00:49:37,244
<i>Victor.</i>

574
00:49:38,822 --> 00:49:41,291
What are you doing here?

575
00:49:41,391 --> 00:49:44,293
I'm starting to wonder
the same thing.

576
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:48,297
- How much do you know about what happened to you?
- Not much.

577
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:52,460
- We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
- You let me know what I can do.

578
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,266
We're all in this together now.

579
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:06,527
<i>Victor, wait.</i>

580
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:09,625
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
the mission didn't go as planned.

581
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:12,364
Didn't go as planned?

582
00:50:12,472 --> 00:50:16,340
<i>It was a catastrophe.
You ruined the lives of four people.</i>

583
00:50:16,443 --> 00:50:19,139
With all due respect, we're both to blame.
I told you to abort.

584
00:50:19,246 --> 00:50:21,043
Abort?

585
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:24,809
I put my company, my name,
billions of dollars on the line.

586
00:50:24,918 --> 00:50:28,045
- I will not let you make me look like a fool.
- If we could understand-

587
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:31,282
I don't want to understand it!
This isn't one of your science projects!

588
00:50:31,391 --> 00:50:33,985
I just want to fix it, fast!

589
00:50:34,094 --> 00:50:36,722
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

590
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,132
No.

591
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:46,204
No problem, Ben.

592
00:50:46,306 --> 00:50:50,766
Just pay your damn electric bill
and get to work on finding a cure.

593
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:19,630
Whoa!

594
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:21,706
Wow!

595
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,771
He's heating up from his core.

596
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,746
<i>And his vitals are completely normal.</i>

597
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:33,079
<i>If we're going to identify
the source of the mutation...</i>

598
00:51:33,186 --> 00:51:35,085
<i>we need to isolate
your recombinant D.N.A...</i>

599
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:37,588
so we can activate
positional genomes.

600
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,056
- Huh?
- We have to do a physical to see what got zapped.

601
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,458
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?

602
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:46,157
<i>His internal organs are completely solid.</i>

603
00:51:48,601 --> 00:51:52,594
How bad is it?
You know, I used to smoke.

604
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:56,804
<i>It's not invisibility per se.</i>

605
00:51:56,909 --> 00:51:59,811
<i>You should be able to bend light
around other objects, even people...</i>

606
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:03,246
if you could control
your emotional state better.

607
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:07,411
- Excuse me? - If you had more
self-control, you could locate the trigger.

608
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:10,489
Can you remember
your exact emotions on the bridge?

609
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:13,657
Anger.

610
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,695
Rage. Frustration.

611
00:52:16,795 --> 00:52:20,197
Okay, is there any way to duplicate
that feeling? Some memory or-

612
00:52:21,934 --> 00:52:24,335
I'm sure I can
come up with something.

613
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:27,338
- You feel anything?
- Nope.

614
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,465
Okay.

615
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,112
It's hotter than I anticipated.

616
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:40,014
- Johnny, back it down.
- I can go hotter!

617
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:41,882
<i>Johnny,just back it down.!</i>

618
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:53,329
Johnny, back it down right now!

619
00:52:53,432 --> 00:52:55,798
Johnny!

620
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:57,835
Ohh!

621
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:01,838
<i>Buzz-kill.!</i>

622
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,840
<i>You guys are crampin'my style.!</i>

623
00:53:03,943 --> 00:53:06,467
Johnny, you were at 4,000 Kelvin.

624
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:09,980
- Any hotter, and you're approaching supernova.
- Sweet!

625
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:12,516
No, not sweet.
That's the temperature of the sun.

626
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:14,518
<i>Not only could you kill yourself...</i>

627
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:17,715
<i>but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere
and destroy all human life.</i>

628
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:19,724
Got it.

629
00:53:19,826 --> 00:53:21,987
Supernova- bad.

630
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:30,869
How's that coming?

631
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:38,041
Oh, I'm so sorry.

632
00:53:38,143 --> 00:53:40,043
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

633
00:53:40,146 --> 00:53:42,045
- You sure?
- Yep.

634
00:53:42,148 --> 00:53:44,047
I, um-

635
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:47,550
You probably thought that was
some form of latent hostility.

636
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:50,623
What in the world
would give me that idea?

637
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:57,094
I mean, you broke up with me, right?

638
00:53:57,197 --> 00:53:59,630
<i>- Are you kidding?
- No.</i>

639
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:02,360
I distinctly remember
you walked out my door, ergo-

640
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:05,733
I was ready for the next step.
You weren't. Ergo, I walked.

641
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,103
It was a little more complicated
than that.

642
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:10,108
I just wanted
to share an apartment.

643
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,576
What was so complicated about that?

644
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:14,943
<i>- There were a lot of variables to consider.
- No, there weren't.</i>

645
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:17,175
There was you and me.

646
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:21,378
No variables, no math.
It was actually the simplest thing in the world.

647
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:24,389
- But like always, Reed, your head got in the way.
- No, it didn't.

648
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:27,324
Then what was it?

649
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:31,295
Did you feel anything when I left?

650
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,893
Do you feel anything right now?

651
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:38,061
<i>Hey, guys.!</i>

652
00:54:41,673 --> 00:54:44,141
I think we have a serious problem.

653
00:54:57,722 --> 00:54:59,280
Thank you.

654
00:54:59,391 --> 00:55:04,226
- How are you feeling?
- Fine. I'm good.

655
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:10,398
Thank you for
coming out to see me.

656
00:55:10,503 --> 00:55:14,666
- You said it was urgent, so-
- It is.

657
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:18,505
There's, uh, something
we need to talk about.

658
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:23,047
Something I need
to ask you.

659
00:55:23,148 --> 00:55:28,882
Victor, wait a second. Um, I appreciate
everything you've done for me...

660
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:32,253
- but I think it's a bad idea for us to get involved.
- Just listen.

661
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:35,885
What are you doing?

662
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:38,623
I didn't bring you here...

663
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:41,528
to talk about us.

664
00:55:41,634 --> 00:55:44,568
Please, this is business.

665
00:55:50,543 --> 00:55:54,309
I need to know, how close is Reed
to finding a cure?

666
00:55:54,413 --> 00:55:57,849
He's been working
'round the clock.

667
00:55:57,949 --> 00:56:01,579
- The data needs to be tested and
analyzed before- - Same old Reed.

668
00:56:01,686 --> 00:56:05,282
All analysis, no action.

669
00:56:05,391 --> 00:56:08,086
Wasn't that the problem
with you two?

670
00:56:08,193 --> 00:56:12,630
If the molecules aren't stable, it could
make us worse- maybe even kill us.

671
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:15,757
Then why is Reed
dragging his feet?

672
00:56:17,302 --> 00:56:21,864
Maybe he likes having
his prize specimen under a glass.

673
00:56:21,974 --> 00:56:24,135
It's ironic,
isn't it?

674
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:28,269
You're finally the perfect woman for him
because you're his science project.

675
00:56:29,914 --> 00:56:33,179
- Please don't make this a personal matter.
- I think you already have.

676
00:56:34,586 --> 00:56:37,612
Victor, we can't do anything
until the research is ready.

677
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:42,525
"We"?

678
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:01,871
Don't forget who
you work for, Susan.

679
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:05,382
So get to work
and do your job.

680
00:57:33,378 --> 00:57:36,405
I wish my wife
would disappear.

681
00:57:43,856 --> 00:57:45,847
<i>So, what's the prognosis?</i>

682
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:50,394
<i>Your tissue,your organs,your entire
biophysical structure is changing.</i>

683
00:57:50,496 --> 00:57:52,896
<i>Every system is still
functioning somehow.</i>

684
00:57:52,998 --> 00:57:54,898
And it's changing into?

685
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,231
I don't really know.
Some kind of organic metallic alloy.

686
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:02,431
Stronger than titanium
or carbon steel.

687
00:58:02,541 --> 00:58:04,065
<i>Harder than diamonds.</i>

688
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:07,737
Like the shields
Reed said would protect us.

689
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:13,501
How long?

690
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:16,733
At this rate, the infection could be
complete in two, maybe three weeks.

691
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:18,737
What do you mean, complete?

692
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,739
I wish I could tell you.

693
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:24,242
I can't pretend to know
what we're dealing with here.

694
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:26,938
- I'll have to notify the C.D.C.
- What?

695
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:29,675
<i>- The Center for Disease Control.
- I know what it is.</i>

696
00:58:29,784 --> 00:58:33,083
If this thing is contagious,
we may have a big problem on our hands.

697
00:58:33,186 --> 00:58:35,485
<i>I'm talking about an epidemic here.</i>

698
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,557
Look at me.

699
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:43,862
I have a life. I'm the... face
of a billion-dollar company.

700
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:48,056
We need to keep this confidential.

701
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:51,934
Victor, this disease is progressive,
degenerative. I have to notify someone.

702
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:54,735
That's terrible news.

703
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:05,552
I think I'll get a second opinion.

704
00:59:34,315 --> 00:59:37,579
<i>Our uniforms were exposed
to the storm, like us...</i>

705
00:59:37,684 --> 00:59:39,585
so they can transform like us...

706
00:59:39,686 --> 00:59:42,815
becoming invisible, changing size on demand
or remaining impervious to flame.

707
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:45,585
You guys look like an '80s rock band.

708
00:59:45,693 --> 00:59:47,557
You know, Ben,
this material stretches.

709
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:50,460
I'm sure I can figure out a way to make it fit.

710
00:59:50,565 --> 00:59:52,465
I wouldn't be caught dead
wearing that.

711
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:55,467
I love these costumes! They're missing
something, though. Needs, like, spice-

712
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,027
- They're not costumes.
- You can't use your powers in public,Johnny.

713
00:59:59,139 --> 01:00:01,199
You guys are worse than NASA.

714
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:03,208
<i>Johnny-</i>

715
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:04,972
Maybe it's missing a utility belt.

716
01:00:06,364 --> 01:00:09,594
If we can build a machine to recreate
the storm, we can reverse the polarity.

717
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:13,295
- And reverse the mutations.
- Curing countless diseases, not just ours.

718
01:00:13,403 --> 01:00:15,371
But we're the focus,
right, Reed?

719
01:00:15,472 --> 01:00:18,635
<i>- Reed?
- Yeah, of course. Of course.</i>

720
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:21,507
<i>And you're sure you can
control this thing?</i>

721
01:00:21,612 --> 01:00:24,103
- Because last time it didn't work out so well.
- With the right amount...

722
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:26,114
of energy we can stabilize
the storm.

723
01:00:26,217 --> 01:00:29,208
Maybe tie in
to the city grid.

724
01:00:33,157 --> 01:00:35,625
You know, you really
need a janitor.

725
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:40,791
I bet this is what it looks like
inside your head.

726
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:46,967
- Oh!
- Sue!

727
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:04,411
<i>That's okay.</i>

728
01:01:04,521 --> 01:01:06,922
- My fault.
- No problem.

729
01:01:08,425 --> 01:01:12,054
- Hi.
- Hi.

730
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:22,494
- Did it just get really hot in here?
- Yeah. It-Yeah.

731
01:01:22,606 --> 01:01:25,972
It's weird.

732
01:01:26,076 --> 01:01:28,737
Yeah, it's-Whoo.

733
01:01:28,846 --> 01:01:31,211
Whoo!

734
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:36,014
- Is this your floor?
- No. I was gonna- It's broken or somethin'.

735
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:38,918
- You guys goin' up?
- Is it hot in here?

736
01:01:39,023 --> 01:01:41,184
Yes.

737
01:01:42,425 --> 01:01:44,393
Listen, I'll call you
about that drink, okay?

738
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:47,054
- Good-bye.
- Bye-bye.

739
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:51,163
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

740
01:01:51,268 --> 01:01:54,567
It's like a sauna in here.

741
01:01:54,672 --> 01:01:57,003
It's been like this
all day.

742
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:04,706
<i>There you go.
There's your change.</i>

743
01:02:05,849 --> 01:02:07,750
<i>Can I help you, buddy?</i>

744
01:02:07,851 --> 01:02:09,581
<i>- Oh, my-
- It's Sue Storm.!</i>

745
01:02:09,686 --> 01:02:11,916
<i>- It's the Invisible Woman!
- Hey,you're right.!</i>

746
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:15,548
<i>Sue Storm.! It is you.!
Listen, my kid loves you.!</i>

747
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,626
I can't believe
I'm doing this again!

748
01:02:38,932 --> 01:02:42,664
All right, I'm here. Let's make this quick.
I got places to go today.

749
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:45,534
Oh, wait. I don't go anywhere.

750
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,802
Johnny, it's imperative that we
stay inside for the foreseeable future.

751
01:02:49,909 --> 01:02:52,503
<i>I know, I know, Reed, but when you
said that last time my brain hurt a week.</i>

752
01:02:52,612 --> 01:02:54,672
Johnny, it's too dangerous
for you to be in public.

753
01:02:54,782 --> 01:02:56,579
You've been saying that for years.

754
01:02:56,684 --> 01:02:59,481
What worries me
is that our powers are evolving.

755
01:02:59,586 --> 01:03:03,751
<i>I know. I know!
I am so close to flying, guys, I can taste it.</i>

756
01:03:03,858 --> 01:03:06,155
- You can't fly.
- Yet.

757
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,820
- Johnny, can you put that napkin out?
- Oh,Jesus.

758
01:03:10,931 --> 01:03:13,525
What's going on?
How you gonna cure us?

759
01:03:13,634 --> 01:03:17,195
I'm gonna build a machine
to re-create the storm.

760
01:03:17,304 --> 01:03:20,739
<i>The cosmic rays will travel
from this generator to this chamber.</i>

761
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,740
<i>What, no pop-ups?</i>

762
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,175
<i>If I can reverse the wave signal-</i>

763
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:28,009
It'll return us back to normal.

764
01:03:28,114 --> 01:03:31,846
<i>- Huh.
- Right. But what are the risks?</i>

765
01:03:31,952 --> 01:03:35,045
Even a small miscalculation could
increase our symptoms exponentially.

766
01:03:35,155 --> 01:03:37,784
Or perhaps even kill us.

767
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:40,382
<i>Now, dying- that's bad, right?</i>

768
01:03:40,494 --> 01:03:43,394
<i>I say wejust let sleeping dogs lie, guys.</i>

769
01:03:43,496 --> 01:03:46,465
- So, how long till this contraption's up and runnin'?
- It's hard to say.

770
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:48,693
- How long, Reed?
- I don't know-

771
01:03:48,802 --> 01:03:50,735
<i>You don't know?</i>

772
01:03:50,838 --> 01:03:52,896
<i>- You don't want this to get worse.
- Worse than that?</i>

773
01:03:53,007 --> 01:03:55,737
<i>Guys, look, we're gonna
be stuck here for a while.</i>

774
01:03:55,842 --> 01:03:58,744
<i>So let's just try and get along.</i>

01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:34,309
What's wrong?

847
01:11:38,012 --> 01:11:39,604
<i>Cheering ]
- He didn't.</i>

848
01:11:39,715 --> 01:11:41,909
Oh, yes, he did!
Flame boy never listens!

849
01:11:43,735 --> 01:11:45,100
What did he do to his uniform?

850
01:11:45,203 --> 01:11:47,899
<i>Woman ]
You've made history in Moto-X.</i>

851
01:11:48,006 --> 01:11:51,463
- I've gotta ask you about this outfit.
- It's Armani meets astronaut.

852
01:11:51,576 --> 01:11:55,376
- So, what are your superhero names?
- They call me the Human Torch.

853
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:57,448
Ladies call me Torch.

854
01:11:57,548 --> 01:12:00,484
<i>- What about the rest of the team?
- That's the Invisible Girl.</i>

855
01:12:00,585 --> 01:12:04,145
- "Girl"?
- Reed Richards? I hear you call him Mr. Fantastic.

856
01:12:04,256 --> 01:12:06,554
- Could have been worse.
- I guess.

857
01:12:06,658 --> 01:12:10,252
<i>Is it true what they say, that he
can expand any part ofhis anatomy?</i>

858
01:12:10,362 --> 01:12:12,261
Whoo!

859
01:12:12,363 --> 01:12:15,457
<i>I've always found him to be a little limp.</i>

860
01:12:15,567 --> 01:12:18,229
<i>What is that?
What do you call that thing?</i>

861
01:12:18,336 --> 01:12:21,065
<i>That's it. The Thing.</i>

862
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,503
<i>You think this is bad?
You should have seen him before.</i>

863
01:12:23,608 --> 01:12:26,805
Okay, now I'm gonna go kill him.

864
01:12:30,515 --> 01:12:33,416
- Sweet,Johnny!
- I love you,Johnny.

865
01:12:33,518 --> 01:12:35,485
There he is.

866
01:12:41,626 --> 01:12:44,527
- Johnny-
- Look, can we talk about this later, guys?

867
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:47,529
No, we can't.
What are you thinking?

868
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:49,497
Where's my ride?

869
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:02,708
<i>You think that's funny, Pebbles?</i>

870
01:13:02,814 --> 01:13:05,873
Johnny! You gave us names?
You don't think!

871
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:08,179
So now you're the face
of the Fantastic Four?

872
01:13:08,286 --> 01:13:09,844
A face that's about to be broken!

873
01:13:09,954 --> 01:13:13,788
This isn't permanent. We need to
be careful until we're normal again.

874
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:17,328
What if I don't want to be normal?
I didn't turn into a monster!

875
01:13:21,632 --> 01:13:24,158
<i>Johnny, say you're sorry.</i>

876
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:29,439
Huh? Did you just-

877
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:36,179
- That's it, Tinker Bell! You wanna fly? Then fly!
- No, Ben.

878
01:13:41,619 --> 01:13:44,588
<i>Wait a minute, guys.</i>

879
01:13:44,689 --> 01:13:48,055
<i>- Ben, don't do this.
- Let's see if we can get blood from a stone.</i>

880
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:49,989
Let's see. Bring it, Burnout!

881
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:52,756
You two need a time-out!

882
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,497
- Talk to Blockhead. He started it!
- I don't care!

883
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:59,762
Damn it,Johnny!

884
01:13:59,871 --> 01:14:01,395
Ben, wait!

885
01:14:01,506 --> 01:14:03,337
What?

886
01:14:06,478 --> 01:14:09,503
You need to control yourself
and think before you act.

887
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:13,175
Yeah, but that's your problem-
you always think, you never act.

888
01:14:13,283 --> 01:14:16,845
<i>What if we got these powers for a reason?
What if it's like some higher calling?</i>

889
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:20,618
- Higher calling? Like getting girls and making money?
- Is there any higher?

890
01:14:20,725 --> 01:14:23,716
You know what, Reed?
This is who we are.

891
01:14:23,828 --> 01:14:25,728
Accept it.

892
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:27,559
Or better yet...

893
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:29,634
enjoy it.

894
01:14:32,904 --> 01:14:35,805
<i>- Wait, Ben! Slow down!
- Hey, check it out.!</i>

895
01:14:35,907 --> 01:14:37,806
He didn't mean it.

896
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:41,072
- You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead.
- It ain't him.

897
01:14:41,179 --> 01:14:43,078
<i>It's them.!</i>

898
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,081
I can't live like this.

899
01:14:45,182 --> 01:14:48,083
Just give Reed a little more time.
You know how he works.

900
01:14:48,185 --> 01:14:50,586
Analyzing every little step
before he takes one.

901
01:14:50,689 --> 01:14:53,283
- It's easy for you to be patient.
- No, it's not!

902
01:14:54,525 --> 01:14:57,586
I thought I was done
waiting for Reed, but I-

903
01:14:59,764 --> 01:15:01,663
We're all in this together, Ben.

904
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:03,563
Together?

905
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:05,568
Susie, look at me.

906
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:08,137
You got no idea what I'd-

907
01:15:09,673 --> 01:15:12,972
what I'd give to be invisible.

908
01:15:28,225 --> 01:15:30,524
Thank you, gentlemen.

909
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:33,859
I'm just going to pick up a few things...

910
01:15:33,965 --> 01:15:35,932
<i>for some friends.</i>

911
01:15:53,417 --> 01:15:55,386
Perfect.

912
01:16:23,113 --> 01:16:25,742
That's not funny.

913
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:27,750
<i>This is Ben Grimm here...</i>

914
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:32,551
the first mook from Brooklyn to go
into outer space, so pay him some respect.

915
01:16:32,657 --> 01:16:35,989
<i>- Just give me the usual, and I'm out.
- All right.</i>

916
01:16:36,094 --> 01:16:37,993
Make it a double.

917
01:16:38,095 --> 01:16:40,064
<i>Make it a triple.</i>

918
01:16:41,832 --> 01:16:43,766
Put it on my tab, Ernie.

919
01:16:43,868 --> 01:16:45,768
<i>- You got it, sweetheart.
- Appreciate it.</i>

920
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:47,860
No problem.

921
01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:54,743
<i>It's okay, Ben.</i>

922
01:16:54,845 --> 01:16:57,872
If there's a God, He hates me.

923
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:00,882
She... is not so into hate.

924
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:04,011
If you could see me,
you wouldn't be saying that.

925
01:17:04,122 --> 01:17:07,613
Then let me see you. Can I?

926
01:17:12,329 --> 01:17:13,921
<i>It's okay.</i>

927
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:20,003
Whoa.

928
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:24,637
Wow.

929
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,546
Huh.

930
01:17:37,454 --> 01:17:39,479
So sad.

931
01:17:43,027 --> 01:17:46,895
Hey, now, being different
isn't always a bad thing.

932
01:17:48,632 --> 01:17:51,625
Trust me.
This ain't one of them times.

933
01:17:53,872 --> 01:17:56,340
Not if you don't want it to be.

934
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,966
All right, Ernie,
I'm outta here.

935
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:01,978
- I'll take you.
- See you later, Benny.

936
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:11,654
I'm Alicia, by the way.

937
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:17,587
<i>Thanks, Ernie.</i>

938
01:19:25,779 --> 01:19:28,680
<i>Reed got what he wanted...</i>

939
01:19:28,782 --> 01:19:31,909
and everything he wanted...

940
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:33,985
he took from me.

941
01:19:38,643 --> 01:19:40,507
Now it's time...

942
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,636
to take it back.

943
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:49,515
<i>But first I need to get rid
ofhis... bodyguard.</i>

944
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:05,201
This seat taken?

945
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:09,170
What are you doin' here?

946
01:20:09,273 --> 01:20:11,399
I was worried about you.

947
01:20:11,507 --> 01:20:15,103
You were worried about me? That's sweet.

948
01:20:15,212 --> 01:20:18,078
Come on. Let me buy you
something to eat.

949
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:22,918
Looks like you could
use the company.

950
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:28,957
Reed?

951
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:36,465
I was just resting my eyes.

952
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,966
So I see.

953
01:20:39,069 --> 01:20:41,037
The new readouts
look very promising.

954
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:43,037
Not promising enough.

955
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:45,073
When are the next tests?

956
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:48,439
I've run out of plants.

957
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,307
So I was thinking maybe...

958
01:20:54,318 --> 01:20:56,217
<i>there's always me.</i>

959
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:59,153
No. It's too soon.

960
01:20:59,256 --> 01:21:01,224
- Reed.
- I should get back to work.

961
01:21:01,324 --> 01:21:03,143
You need a break.

962
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,699
- Sue, not now. Please.
- Come on. Let's go.

963
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:14,010
<i>Remember our first date here?
God, I was nervous.</i>

964
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:18,386
You know, I bribed the projectionist
ten bucks to keep the place open late.

965
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,856
- Really? I gave him 20.
- Mm.

966
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:24,895
- No. No way.
- Yeah. Yeah.

967
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,033
<i>- I didn't want that night to end.
- Oh, Sue.</i>

968
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:36,162
You were right.
It wasn't complicated.

969
01:21:36,275 --> 01:21:38,573
I just wasn't ready to-

970
01:21:38,677 --> 01:21:41,670
<i>You always talked about
how you liked the kind of man...</i>

971
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,805
who could approach you,
speak his mind.

972
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:46,010
One who wasn't afraid to tell you
exactly what he wanted.

973
01:21:46,118 --> 01:21:50,521
I did... but I wanted you
to be that man.

974
01:21:50,622 --> 01:21:54,114
Why didn't you
say something?

975
01:21:54,226 --> 01:21:58,027
Reed, I'm saying it now.

976
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:10,234
That's my nose, genius.

977
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,243
Remember this place?

978
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,939
Of course. This is where
I first asked you out.

979
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,140
I think it was me
that asked you.

980
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,057
Oh. Right.

981
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:23,365
Well, you can be a little intimidating.

982
01:22:23,472 --> 01:22:25,963
A girl can grow old waiting around
for you to take charge.

983
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:29,203
- Well, we can't all be as bold as-
- As who? Victor?

984
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,740
You know,
there is no me and Victor.

985
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:36,970
Never was.

986
01:22:38,604 --> 01:22:41,903
Well, I guess that's what I thought
you always wanted.

987
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,177
A stronger man.

988
01:22:50,615 --> 01:22:53,243
I did, Reed.
But I wanted you to be that man.

989
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,628
Well, why didn't you say so?

990
01:22:56,738 --> 01:23:00,503
I guess it kind of would have
defeated the purpose.

991
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:04,479
But I'm saying it now.

992
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,014
So take charge.

993
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,448
That's not fair.

994
01:23:22,997 --> 01:23:24,966
Excuse me.

995
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,470
I know it's not easy.

996
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,405
Life hasn't changed that much
for Reed, Sue orJohnny.

997
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,943
At least they can still go out in public.
But for you-

998
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:41,208
If you're tryin' to cheer me up, you're doin'
a hell of a job. Know what I mean, Scarface?

999
01:23:41,315 --> 01:23:44,216
I'm just saying I know what it's like
to lose something that you love...

1000
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:47,220
to see it slip away
and know it's never coming back.

1001
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:51,314
Look, Reed is gonna
fix me up. Okay?

1002
01:23:52,426 --> 01:23:55,328
For your sake,
I hope you're right.

1003
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:59,662
<i>Look, he's a brilliant man. We should all
trust that he's working as hard as he can.</i>

1004
01:23:59,768 --> 01:24:01,895
<i>You're his best friend.</i>

1005
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:05,530
So what possible reason could he have
for taking his time?

1006
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:12,377
I mean, other than
spending more time with Sue.

1007
01:24:36,621 --> 01:24:38,588
<i>I figured the only way
for me to get you in here...</i>

1008
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:40,988
was to put that
in the window.

1009
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:43,583
How'd you know
it was me?

1010
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:47,092
'Cause I'm blind,
not deaf.

1011
01:24:49,868 --> 01:24:53,429
So, what do you think?

1012
01:24:56,475 --> 01:24:58,908
Eyebrows are a little big.

1013
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:05,043
Please.
You have to come in.

1014
01:25:06,952 --> 01:25:10,444
Whoa! I'm not up
for a party.

1015
01:25:10,555 --> 01:25:13,752
- I'm not dressed.
- Relax. It's casual.

1016
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:17,851
Well, what I mean is,
I'm a little... dusty.

1017
01:25:19,096 --> 01:25:22,088
I can take care of that.
Come on.

1018
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:06,970
Those your puppets too?

1019
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:09,069
Those are my stepdad's.

1020
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:11,444
I try to stick to more
mature work-

1021
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:15,247
the kind that brings
big, strong men into the door.

1022
01:26:15,353 --> 01:26:17,685
You could've just put out an ad
in the personals.

1023
01:26:17,788 --> 01:26:20,587
Oh, yeah. "Sensual blind chick...

1024
01:26:20,692 --> 01:26:25,025
seeks deep, spiritual connection
with a two-ton, rock-hard he-man. "

1025
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:28,622
Hey! This ain't permanent.

1026
01:26:28,733 --> 01:26:31,963
My friend Reed's
lookin' for a cure.

1027
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:34,162
I hope.

1028
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:36,296
You feel okay
to me, Benny.

1029
01:26:36,408 --> 01:26:39,809
Oh, you don't know what it's like
to be out there, walkin' around...

1030
01:26:39,911 --> 01:26:43,141
like some kind of circus freak,
people starin' at ya...

1031
01:26:43,247 --> 01:26:47,377
- whisperin'.
- Yeah. I wouldn't know anything about that.

1032
01:26:47,484 --> 01:26:51,478
- I-I- - How many astronauts did
you know growing up in Brooklyn?

1033
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:54,319
- Uh-
- None. Right?

1034
01:26:54,426 --> 01:26:57,987
But you dared to be different.

1035
01:26:58,095 --> 01:27:01,224
You didn't care what
anybody else did or said...

1036
01:27:01,332 --> 01:27:03,528
or thought.

1037
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:06,159
So why start now?

1038
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:10,507
You gonna let me finish?

1039
01:27:13,078 --> 01:27:16,672
Yeah. Why not?

1040
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:19,180
Good...

1041
01:27:19,283 --> 01:27:22,219
'cause we got
a party to get to.

1042
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:24,913
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1043
01:27:25,023 --> 01:27:27,354
Hi, guys.

1044
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:31,725
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1045
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:38,835
Hey, guys, I'm sorry. I gotta take a rain check.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1046
01:27:41,573 --> 01:27:43,871
Need a ride?

1047
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:04,292
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, no.

1048
01:28:04,395 --> 01:28:06,556
Gotta take care
of the fans, right?

1049
01:28:06,664 --> 01:28:08,929
Look, I built my business
knowing what people want.

1050
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:13,060
- Right now, people want you.
- Thank you, Victor. I'm flattered.

1051
01:28:13,171 --> 01:28:15,867
<i>- We don't wanna let the people down.
- No, we don't.</i>

1052
01:28:15,974 --> 01:28:18,703
Which is why we need to strike
while the iron's hot.

1053
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:20,936
I'm talking video games,
action figures.

1054
01:28:21,046 --> 01:28:23,070
<i>- Sponsors.
- Action figures?</i>

1055
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:25,479
- Really? -
Hmm. - Mm-hmm.

1056
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,149
You talk to Reed
and Sue about this?

1057
01:28:30,255 --> 01:28:33,052
Johnny, let's
be honest here.

1058
01:28:33,158 --> 01:28:35,489
<i>Reed, Sue, Ben-
Good people, all...</i>

1059
01:28:35,592 --> 01:28:38,083
<i>but stars?</i>

1060
01:28:38,195 --> 01:28:43,690
I don't wanna break up the band,
but you're the one that people want.

1061
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:45,895
- That's right, baby. It's all about you.
- Mm.

1062
01:28:46,003 --> 01:28:48,131
Don't you think
it's time to go solo?

1063
01:28:52,143 --> 01:28:54,270
Take the car for a spin.

1064
01:28:55,779 --> 01:29:00,011
<i>Think about it.
Is this the life you want?</i>

1065
01:29:00,118 --> 01:29:05,680
Or would you rather live in Reed's lab?

1066
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:16,332
Hi. So this is it.

1067
01:29:19,304 --> 01:29:21,533
You okay?

1068
01:29:21,639 --> 01:29:23,765
- I guess so.
- Good.

1069
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:25,934
Come on in.
Check it out.

1070
01:29:26,043 --> 01:29:29,639
<i>I'm gonna get us some
beers or wine or somethin'.</i>

1071
01:29:29,747 --> 01:29:32,148
They always let the blind girl
to the head of the line.

1072
01:29:34,519 --> 01:29:37,681
Oh, hi!
Thanks.

1073
01:29:43,427 --> 01:29:48,229
<i>I don't know about this one.
It lacks a certain realism.</i>

1074
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:57,032
<i>She's always had a thing for runaways
and strays, but this is ridiculous.</i>

1075
01:29:57,141 --> 01:29:59,576
I know. Does she really think
these sculptures are gonna sell?

1076
01:29:59,676 --> 01:30:02,770
Who would want this thing in their house?
The girl's a one-woman charity.

1077
01:30:02,881 --> 01:30:04,849
Mm.

1078
01:30:34,813 --> 01:30:37,475
Benny?

1079
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,051
<i>It's true.</i>

1080
01:30:45,789 --> 01:30:47,519
Yeah.

1081
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:49,592
I have that effect
on people.

1082
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:54,194
<i>- Ben.
- Oh.!</i>

1083
01:30:54,298 --> 01:30:58,234
So you remember my name
now, do ya?

1084
01:30:58,336 --> 01:31:03,000
Well, do you also remember what you swore
to do with every breath in your body?

1085
01:31:03,106 --> 01:31:05,097
We're working
as hard as we can.

1086
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:07,576
Yeah, I can tell.

1087
01:31:09,012 --> 01:31:12,106
- Victor was right.
- Victor?

1088
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:15,118
I don't know if this thing will change us back
or make us worse.

1089
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:17,744
I need you to be patient
for a little while longer.

1090
01:31:17,855 --> 01:31:20,756
<i>- Reed, look at me!
- I am looking! That's why I can't make a mistake!</i>

1091
01:31:20,859 --> 01:31:23,725
I've gotta get it right,
and it's not right yet!

1092
01:31:23,828 --> 01:31:27,559
I spent my whole life protecting you,
and for what?

1093
01:31:27,664 --> 01:31:30,963
So you could play Twister with your girlfriend
while I'm the Freak of the Week?

1094
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:35,449
- Ben, stop it!
- You stay out of this, Susie.

1095
01:31:35,557 --> 01:31:37,617
Stop it, or I will.

1096
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,159
Get off me, Rubber Boy!

1097
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:43,454
<i>You guys, quit it.!</i>

1098
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:46,395
<i>Ben.!</i>

1099
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,943
Calm down!

1100
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:01,381
Calm down!

1101
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:19,327
Good thing you're flexible enough
to watch your own back...

1102
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:28,743
'cause I ain't doin' it no more.

1103
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:34,707
You two are on your own.

1104
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,460
Hey, look what
the marketing guys gave me.

1105
01:32:47,563 --> 01:32:49,895
Check it out. Listen.
You'll love this.

1106
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:52,399
It's clobberin' time!

1107
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:54,400
It's catchy. Right?

1108
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,835
Isn't that great?

1109
01:32:56,939 --> 01:32:59,873
It's clobberin't-

1110
01:32:59,975 --> 01:33:02,273
That was the prototype!

1111
01:33:07,382 --> 01:33:09,283
Ben!

1112
01:33:09,385 --> 01:33:11,784
- Johnny, have you seen Ben?
- Yeah. Sunshine just left.

1113
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:13,787
Look, Sue, I'm sorry.

1114
01:33:13,889 --> 01:33:16,914
I can't stay in this freak show.
I gotta get back to the real world.

1115
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:18,788
You're calling that the real world?

1116
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:21,385
You're not Mom.
Don't talk to me like I'm a little boy.

1117
01:33:21,497 --> 01:33:24,295
Maybe I would if you stopped
acting like one.

1118
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:27,493
Do you even hear yourself?
Who do you think you are?

1119
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:31,595
Why is everyone on my ass? If you guys
are jealous, fine. I didn't expect it from you.

1120
01:33:31,707 --> 01:33:34,608
You really think those people out there
care about you?

1121
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:36,609
You're just a fad to them,Johnny.

1122
01:33:36,712 --> 01:33:39,840
Let's try something new.
You live your life, I'll live mine.

1123
01:33:41,483 --> 01:33:43,451
Sound good?

1124
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:46,578
<i>Oh, andjust for the record-</i>

1125
01:33:46,689 --> 01:33:48,657
They love me!

1126
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:33,100
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1127
01:34:33,202 --> 01:34:35,170
Reed.

1128
01:35:15,677 --> 01:35:17,908
Oh, my God, Reed.
What did you do?

1129
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:20,537
- I can make it work.
- No!

1130
01:35:20,649 --> 01:35:24,106
I need more power
to control the storm.

1131
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:26,380
<i>- More power?
- You need a doctor.</i>

1132
01:35:26,488 --> 01:35:28,387
- Come with me.
- Sue-

1133
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,980
<i>- One more try.
- You need rest.</i>

1134
01:35:31,092 --> 01:35:33,653
Leonard? Bring Ben Grimm
to the Baxter Building.

1135
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:59,166
<i>Mr. Grimm?</i>

1136
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:01,738
They need you
back at the Baxter Building.

1137
01:36:01,838 --> 01:36:04,569
<i>It's Reed.</i>

1138
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:19,786
Thank you. Want another one?

1139
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:22,881
You want one more?

1140
01:36:22,993 --> 01:36:27,430
All right!

1141
01:36:35,506 --> 01:36:38,065
Thank you.

1142
01:36:49,319 --> 01:36:53,119
Hey. Johnny Storm.
Human Torch.

1143
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:55,488
Listen, you wanna
get outta here?

1144
01:36:59,863 --> 01:37:03,525
- Is this your boyfriend?
- Is that all you do?

1145
01:37:03,634 --> 01:37:07,934
Bar tricks, stealing chicks.

1146
01:37:11,942 --> 01:37:17,743
What are you doin'?
You could've burned somebody.

1147
01:37:17,847 --> 01:37:20,975
You know, if I had your powers,
I'd be doin' somethin' with it...

1148
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:24,782
not wastin' my time
doin' cheap tricks in bars.

1149
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,219
<i>Ben. Come in.</i>

1150
01:38:01,324 --> 01:38:03,122
What is this?
Where's Reed?

1151
01:38:03,226 --> 01:38:06,685
Where do you think?
With Sue.

1152
01:38:06,796 --> 01:38:09,060
<i>I'll take it from here,
Leonard.</i>

1153
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:11,489
Uh, yes, sir.

1154
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:18,115
What do you want, Vic?

1155
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,989
To help you.

1156
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:23,587
The machine is ready.

1157
01:38:23,698 --> 01:38:27,463
- But Reed said it wouldn't be-
- He also said we'd avoid that storm in space.

1158
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:30,628
But we all know
how that turned out.

1159
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:34,402
He couldn't generate enough power
for the machine to reach critical mass.

1160
01:38:34,509 --> 01:38:37,966
Yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic.

1161
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:41,139
- And you can?
- Yes.

1162
01:38:44,786 --> 01:38:47,118
Tell me...

1163
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:50,190
do you want to be Ben Grimm again?

1164
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:36,529
Oh, thank you!

1165
01:40:38,733 --> 01:40:40,701
Vic?

1166
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:45,005
Vic?

1167
01:40:49,409 --> 01:40:51,377
Vic!

1168
01:40:54,582 --> 01:40:56,550
Vic, it worked!

1169
01:41:00,255 --> 01:41:02,222
Vic?

1170
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:06,954
<i>Everyone thought I was safe
behind those shields.</i>

1171
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:10,757
Oh, my God.

1172
01:41:12,432 --> 01:41:15,265
- The machine worked for me. It can work for you too.
- Oh, it did.

1173
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:17,667
It worked perfectly.

1174
01:41:19,274 --> 01:41:21,173
You planned this.

1175
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:23,608
I've always wanted power.

1176
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:26,737
Now I have an unlimited supply.

1177
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:29,748
And no Thing to stand in your way.

1178
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:31,751
Take a good look, Ben.

1179
01:41:31,853 --> 01:41:35,686
This is what a man looks like
who embraces his destiny.

1180
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,921
<i>One down, three to go.</i>

1181
01:41:43,096 --> 01:41:45,462
Vic?

1182
01:41:45,567 --> 01:41:48,001
Right on cue.

1183
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:50,467
<i>Ben?</i>

1184
01:41:50,572 --> 01:41:53,472
- What did you do?
- Exactly what I said I would.

1185
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:56,135
I built a better, stronger being...

1186
01:41:57,545 --> 01:41:59,809
and outsmarted
the great Reed Richards.

1187
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:02,780
If you've exposed yourself to the storm,
you're endangering your life.

1188
01:42:02,884 --> 01:42:06,649
- You need help.
- You always know best.

1189
01:42:08,256 --> 01:42:09,814
<i>So tell me...</i>

1190
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:12,721
what happens
when you super-heat rubber?

1191
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:48,728
<i>Mr. Von Doom. Are you okay?</i>

1192
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,764
Never better,Jimmy.

1193
01:43:02,710 --> 01:43:06,167
Why the long face?
Let's talk in my office.

1194
01:43:26,301 --> 01:43:28,895
Ben! Ben!

1195
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:32,962
<i>- Sue.!
- Johnny! The machine worked!</i>

1196
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:35,405
<i>Give me a hand.!</i>

1197
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:37,409
- Come on.
- Ben!

1198
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:39,412
Get his arm.

1199
01:43:41,515 --> 01:43:44,417
You all right, Ben?
Put him on the step.

1200
01:43:44,519 --> 01:43:47,317
What happened, big guy?
I leave you for five minutes-

1201
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:49,322
The machine.

1202
01:43:49,423 --> 01:43:51,551
Vic used it on himself.

1203
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:54,252
He was affected
by the cloud like us.

1204
01:43:54,362 --> 01:43:57,524
- Where's Reed?
- Vic must have taken him.

1205
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:04,993
Dr. Richards,
allow me to begin your lesson-

1206
01:44:05,105 --> 01:44:07,573
<i>Chemistry 101.</i>

1207
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:10,743
<i>What happens to rubber...</i>

1208
01:44:10,845 --> 01:44:12,744
<i>when it's super-cooled?</i>

1209
01:44:15,783 --> 01:44:17,682
<i>Hmm? Give up?</i>

1210
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,189
That's not like you, Reed.

1211
01:44:27,328 --> 01:44:31,127
After all, we're both doctors.

1212
01:44:34,469 --> 01:44:36,368
Painful?

1213
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,769
You don't know
the meaning of the word.

1214
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:49,550
Just a little something
from our defense contracts.

1215
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:58,524
<i>Let's check in on the rest
of the family, shall we?</i>

1216
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:08,568
Oh, no.

1217
01:45:08,668 --> 01:45:11,865
<i>- We gotta get out ofhere.
- I got an idea.</i>

1218
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,997
- Don't even think about it.
- Never do.

1219
01:45:14,108 --> 01:45:18,067
<i>What are you doing?
Johnny, no.!</i>

1220
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:24,981
Come on! Come on, come on!

1221
01:45:25,086 --> 01:45:27,020
Flame on!

1222
01:45:29,689 --> 01:45:31,385
Whoo-hoo!

1223
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,163
- We have to help Reed.
- It's too dangerous for you now. You have to stay here.

1224
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:47,908
What did I do?

1225
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:03,248
Whoa!

1226
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:09,162
Whoa!

1227
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:26,646
Come on! Think!

1228
01:46:48,569 --> 01:46:51,595
Two down, two to go.

1229
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:06,444
- Sue.
- Shh.

1230
01:47:08,189 --> 01:47:10,350
What has he done to you?

1231
01:47:10,457 --> 01:47:12,483
How romantic.

1232
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:15,858
Victor, please.

1233
01:47:15,962 --> 01:47:17,863
Call me Doom.

1234
01:47:17,965 --> 01:47:20,524
The machine works.

1235
01:47:20,635 --> 01:47:23,865
<i>It worked on Ben. It can work on you.
We can turn you back.</i>

1236
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,939
Do you really think fate turned us into gods
so we could refuse these gifts?

1237
01:47:27,041 --> 01:47:30,100
Victor, you always thought
you were a god. Now back off.

1238
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:32,805
Susan, let's not fight.

1239
01:47:32,913 --> 01:47:35,144
No, let's.

1240
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:40,851
Susan, you're fired!

1241
01:47:43,724 --> 01:47:47,181
To think I was about
to share my life with you.

1242
01:47:50,096 --> 01:47:53,328
Marco.

1243
01:47:54,435 --> 01:47:56,198
<i>Polo.</i>

1244
01:47:56,304 --> 01:47:59,033
Marc-

1245
01:48:09,417 --> 01:48:12,351
Did you say good-bye
to your brotherJohnny?

1246
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:18,347
<i>It's time to end this.</i>

1247
01:48:20,427 --> 01:48:23,055
<i>No, Vic. It's clobberin'time.!</i>

1248
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:34,774
Damn, I been waitin' to do that.

1249
01:48:34,875 --> 01:48:37,672
<i>Susie. You okay?</i>

1250
01:48:38,712 --> 01:48:40,703
Victor ain't that bad, huh? Hmph.

1251
01:48:42,382 --> 01:48:44,613
He's just a little
larger than life, right?

1252
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:47,744
Maybe next time
you'll listen to me before-

1253
01:48:48,722 --> 01:48:50,384
Ben!

1254
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:41,407
Sorry, ladies.

1255
01:49:41,509 --> 01:49:44,171
- Stop the car! Stop the car!
- Pull over?

1256
01:49:44,278 --> 01:49:46,802
The brakes!

1257
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:55,954
<i>This is the police.!</i>

1258
01:49:56,056 --> 01:49:59,958
<i>Put your hands up
and step down from the vehicle.!</i>

1259
01:50:02,762 --> 01:50:04,594
<i>Take him out.!</i>

1260
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:13,537
Ladies, I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

1261
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:17,304
- The transmission sticks.
- Not gonna be a problem!

1262
01:50:49,844 --> 01:50:52,641
Good-bye, Ben.

1263
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:56,774
<i>I can't let you do that.</i>

1264
01:50:57,818 --> 01:51:00,082
Reed?

1265
01:51:00,186 --> 01:51:02,677
I'll be right with you.

1266
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:11,230
Hello, Susan.

1267
01:51:13,466 --> 01:51:15,332
You three are pathetic.

1268
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:26,612
You missed me.

1269
01:51:27,814 --> 01:51:30,783
Had a little relapse, huh?

1270
01:51:30,885 --> 01:51:32,613
Welcome back.

1271
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,619
This is gonna be fun.

1272
01:51:55,208 --> 01:51:58,770
<i>I can't hold it.!</i>

1273
01:52:10,157 --> 01:52:11,920
Johnny! Supernova!

1274
01:52:12,025 --> 01:52:14,323
- I thought we agreed that was bad!
- Now!

1275
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:19,057
- Ben!
- Gotcha!

1276
01:52:27,006 --> 01:52:28,804
Sue! Think you can contain it?

1277
01:52:39,886 --> 01:52:41,912
Flame on, kid.

1278
01:53:07,146 --> 01:53:11,810
Is that the best you can do? A little heat?

1279
01:53:11,918 --> 01:53:13,978
<i>Time for your lesson- Chem 101.</i>

1280
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:16,555
What happens when you
rapidly cool hot metal?

1281
01:53:18,658 --> 01:53:20,627
<i>Ben.!</i>

1282
01:54:01,435 --> 01:54:03,061
Whoa.

1283
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:13,371
You done good, kid.

1284
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:15,380
Come on.

1285
01:54:16,917 --> 01:54:18,817
Sue, are you okay?

1286
01:54:18,918 --> 01:54:20,819
Yeah.

1287
01:54:27,394 --> 01:54:29,362
Man, I love this job.

1288
01:54:31,465 --> 01:54:32,898
Job, huh?

1289
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,434
Well, we do have the suits.

1290
01:54:48,247 --> 01:54:48,346
<i>Group Singing ]</i>

1291
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:50,782
<i>Group Singing ]</i>

1292
01:54:57,890 --> 01:55:00,256
- Ladies, your drinks.
- I don't think we need another.

1293
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,795
- Just one more.
- Thank you so much.

1294
01:55:02,895 --> 01:55:04,796
Cheers.

1295
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:10,336
Oh. Oh! I need names and shots.
Bartender!

1296
01:55:10,436 --> 01:55:13,634
Custom-made-
36-quadruple "E."

1297
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:16,904
<i>Look, I've been crunching
the numbers on the machine...</i>

1298
01:55:17,011 --> 01:55:18,807
and if I could rework the power-

1299
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:21,073
Forget about it, egghead.
I'm good as is.

1300
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:23,341
Better than good, baby.

1301
01:55:23,449 --> 01:55:27,546
You just need to work on your touch.

1302
01:55:27,654 --> 01:55:29,814
Mmm, I like the sound of that.

1303
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:36,157
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

1304
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:40,990
Thanks.

1305
01:55:46,707 --> 01:55:50,268
I found a broken gasket
from space.

1306
01:55:50,377 --> 01:55:53,278
A gasket? Reed, come on.
We're at a party.

1307
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:56,542
And if one of us were to wear it-

1308
01:56:04,123 --> 01:56:06,057
No more thinking.

1309
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:08,957
No more variables.

1310
01:56:12,332 --> 01:56:14,128
<i>Sue Storm...</i>

1311
01:56:14,234 --> 01:56:17,168
will you marry me?

1312
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:30,814
Sue, you kinda need to...

1313
01:56:30,917 --> 01:56:32,818
say something.

1314
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:35,912
Oh! Yes. Yes.

1315
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:45,828
That's my nose, genius.

1316
01:56:45,932 --> 01:56:47,900
These are my lips.

1317
01:56:52,206 --> 01:56:54,400
<i>Aww. She's kissin'him.</i>

1318
01:56:54,507 --> 01:56:56,771
<i>They're so cute.!</i>

1319
01:56:56,877 --> 01:56:59,368
<i>- Congratulations.!
- About time,you guys.</i>

1320
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:04,109
Hey, no more wisecracks
about the way I look.

1321
01:57:04,217 --> 01:57:08,244
Hey, call me Mr. Sensitivity.

1322
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:11,483
Okay, wide load coming through!
Everybody move! He's huge!

1323
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:16,355
- Come here, Mr. Sensitive.
- Flame on!

1324
01:57:19,365 --> 01:57:21,333
Show-off!

1325
01:57:49,363 --> 01:57:51,262
How long will it be?

1326
01:57:51,364 --> 01:57:53,332
Should be about 12 days.

1327
01:57:56,970 --> 01:57:59,939
Aw, come on.
What's wrong with this thing?

1328
01:58:05,378 --> 01:58:07,573
Ready.
