1
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,168
Don’t jump in the pool.

2
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,879
The water we put in
next week for the summer.

3
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,809
...in South Vietnam
ground war.

4
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,688
The U.S. Command reports 148
Americans killed in the war last week,

5
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,817
the lowest weekly figure in six
months. 1,612 Americans were...

6
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,111
...they barely look
like they've been warned.

7
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,863
There was exchange
of fire south of

8
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,240
the Sea of Galilee and
across the Suez Canal.

9
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,327
These exchanges and raids are
now a daily part of Israeli life,

10
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,621
and the country is
prepared for anything.

11
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,541
NBC news correspondent,
David Burrington, reports.

12
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,211
In spite of all
the border turmoil,

13
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,299
Israeli intelligence officers do
not expect all-out war this summer

14
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,801
unless the Arab
nations get reckless.

15
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,678
And that's the
main worry here,

16
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,222
that Arab frustration
will suddenly explode...

17
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,768
In a day
of intensive activity,

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,937
Captain Neil Armstrong
and his crew

19
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,148
entered the final
phase of preparations

20
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,151
for the July 16th
launch of Apollo 11.

21
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,361
NASA officials report

22
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,823
that the third and final day of
launching pad tests proceeded smoothly,

23
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,366
while inside
the training center,

24
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,370
the astronauts performed simulated
moon walks in their space suits.

25
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,877
What? Excuse me. I can't possibly stay.

26
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,713
This establishment isn't
fit for human habitation.

27
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,633
Fine, go. Yes, well, here's your key.

28
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,636
It didn't fit the lock, but
the door was open in any case.

29
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,555
You went into the room?
I did, yes.

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,766
And now I must insist
on you returning my $8.

31
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,060
After you already
used the room?

32
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,395
What kind of scam
are you running?

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,813
And besides...

34
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,275
Well, this is ridiculous!

35
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,902
The so-called air
conditioner was just

36
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,862
an empty plastic
box in the window.

37
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:03,033
The room was filthy. Indeed, I
discovered a small hair on the pillow.

38
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,118
There wasn't even
a towel in the bathroom.

39
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,621
Ma.
What?

40
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,831
Please, we're late already.

41
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,834
My son,
thank God you're here.

42
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,462
This man is threatening me for a refund!

43
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,976
I'm sorry. You're over $5,000
in arrears on the mortgage.

44
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,436
The home office is
breathing down my neck.

45
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,064
Mr. Spiers,
the El Monaco Resort...

46
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,565
It's a resort now?

47
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,736
...and Motel is my
parents' lifeblood.

48
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,862
With the addition
of the swimming pool

49
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,614
and these new town-wide
marketing initiatives...

50
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,116
Initiatives?

51
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,785
As you know, I have been
elected the President

52
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,953
of the Bethel
Chamber of Commerce.

53
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,455
The youngest president
in their history.

54
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,209
We've decided to erect a tourist
information booth, right off 17B.

55
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,544
I have agreed, on behalf
of the El Monaco,

56
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,796
to lease at no cost some
road frontage to the endeavor,

57
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,133
which should coincidentally drive
heavy tourist traffic right to our door.

58
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,385
In addition...
Please, Elliot,

59
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,637
you know I do everything I can to help.

60
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,931
We even bought one
of your paintings.

61
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,310
But don't try to sell me
on those singles weekends

62
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,437
or the culture festival
or whatever other schemes

63
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,397
were supposed to dig
you out last summer.

64
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,525
We've decided to go classical
with the festival this year,

65
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,528
maybe a string quartet, more
contemporary, like Morton Feldman?

66
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,364
Very avant-garde. And we've got
a theater troupe in the barn.

67
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,533
You have a theater
troupe in the barn?

68
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:32,080
The Earthlight Players.
Vassar graduates, some of them.

69
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,874
They live in the barn?

70
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,044
They do everything
in the barn.

71
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,838
You haven't seen the sign? What sign?

72
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,964
The sign in
front of the barn.

73
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,634
Mr. Spiers, my God, please.
We come here, begging,

74
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,345
begging for mercy,
and what do you give us?

75
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,805
This fixation about the barn.
What is it with you and the barn?

76
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,933
I was just... I'm an old woman,
Mr. Spiers. I've suffered.

77
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,896
I walked here all the way
from Minsk, in Russia,

78
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,025
in 20-foot snow drifts,
1,000 miles across Siberia.

79
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,445
I escaped the pogroms,
the Tsar's secret police,

80
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,531
with nothing but cold
potatoes in my pockets.

81
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,034
Mrs. Teichberg, please...
And for what?

82
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,204
For more persecution!
It's because we're Jewish.

83
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,790
I know it, isn't it?
Mrs. Teichberg, please.

84
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,375
This is the Catskills.

85
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,419
Half the summer colonies are
Jewish, they're all our clients.

86
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,799
Until the day they need you,
and then on goes the gas!

87
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,801
Ma,
calm down, please?

88
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,763
Jackson, just give us
a couple of months.

89
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,350
The summer season's coming up, I
honestly do have some real money

90
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,560
owed me from my interior
design business in the city.

91
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,609
Please?

92
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:53,036
Mother-son ballroom class will
start immediately after, at 11:00.

93
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,082
That's kinder-dancing for
the kiddies in 10 minutes.

94
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,959
Dad, you gotta
get Ma to lay off

95
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,878
the Nazi stuff and
let me handle this.

96
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,840
You think I can tell
your mother what to do?

97
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,386
I gotta get back to the city.
I'll see you Friday.

98
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,721
We'll get the money.

99
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,183
Let them take
this miserable dump.

100
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,561
I'll die in peace,
in Florida.

101
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,990
Mr. Tiber.
George.

102
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,285
I admitted your sister
some time ago. Thanks.

103
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,745
And some gentlemen
from the moving company.

104
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,080
Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,960
There you are.
Hi, Sis.

106
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,049
How did it go
at the bank?

107
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:53,847
How do you think it went? Till
the end of the summer, that's it.

108
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,183
What about the money
those mobsters owe you

109
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,059
for that nightclub
you designed?

110
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,315
They have a surprisingly strict
policy about paying designers.

111
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,774
They don't.

112
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,944
You want some
more paintings?

113
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,323
No, I already have 10 of them.
And you know Joe hates them.

114
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,035
Of course you're broke,

115
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,330
after all the money you've sunk
into that hellhole of theirs.

116
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:22,000
And I bet Ma's never even
said a word of thanks, has she?

117
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,295
No, but I can sense it.

118
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,923
The special way she
sometimes looks at me

119
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,425
with just her left eye,
you know.

120
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,512
Elliot. Now is your time

121
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,680
to go to California
like you've always wanted,

122
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:40,727
to paint and design. Be free, stop
throwing your life away up there.

123
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,981
I can't give up on them now. Why not?

124
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,901
I'm the one they
still want around.

125
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,362
I guess that means they
love me more than you.

126
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,824
That must be a great
consolation to you.

127
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,341
Dad, that's bleach
for laundry.

128
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,302
It kills the germs.
What's the difference?

129
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,436
Elli? What? What are you
doing with those sheets?

130
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,898
They're dirty.
Let me see. Nothing.

131
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,234
Those two, they didn't do nothing
in there. Shake them, put them back.

132
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,486
But, Ma...
Electricity, detergent,

133
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,655
who's paying
for all that?

134
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,621
And you, theater girl,
get back in the barn!

135
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,250
All of you!

136
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,544
Lazy people.

137
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,009
Let's call to order.
Come on, everyone.

138
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,681
Last meeting, we all said we'd each
bring some new ideas to the table.

139
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,438
Well, okay.

140
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,151
We got a lot of dairy farms
around here, right?

141
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,280
And a fair number of bulls.

142
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,615
Okay, you've all
heard of the running

143
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,075
of the bulls in
that town in Spain,

144
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,453
Pampoona.
Pamplona.

145
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,747
Well, no one's doing
one in the Catskills.

146
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,124
Seems to be a big
draw over there.

147
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,211
It would be very amusing
to see all those Jews

148
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,172
from Levitsky's
summer colony,

149
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,967
you know, the ones with the
black top hats and the curls,

150
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,471
running for their lives
chased by our local livestock.

151
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,849
Wouldn't that be
a wonderful sight!

152
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,645
We're writing it all down.

153
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,359
Any other ideas?
What about the monorail?

154
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,861
Marge, you can't bring
that up in every meeting.

155
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,614
I've written
to the Governor,

156
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,116
but I think a letter from
the entire Chamber of Commerce

157
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,202
would be much
more effective.

158
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,330
A monorail linking downtown
New York to White Lake

159
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,124
would be a tremendous spur
to the local economy.

160
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,835
Jesus. Look, people, I said I
would come back to these meetings

161
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,838
if you could stay out of
cuckoo land, just once.

162
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,300
We have some serious local
issues, serious business to do.

163
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,843
Such as?

164
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,428
For starters,

165
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,971
I need a permit
for the town landing

166
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,557
for a fish-toss
tournament next month.

167
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,520
I knew it. I knew it. You're just
back here for your own purposes.

168
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,565
Now, come on, Marge. All right,
let's see the application.

169
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,942
I got it here.

170
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,284
Yeah, that's all
in order. $1.

171
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,664
Here you go.

172
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,459
And I've got my
application for our annual

173
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,962
El Monaco summer
music and art event,

174
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,505
which will also inaugurate
the first season

175
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,465
of the tourist
information kiosk.

176
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,343
Annie, if your grandson and his
friends want to play again this year,

177
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,970
tell them to
give me a call.

178
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,264
Okay.

179
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,475
Do I hear a motion to
approve these permits?

180
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,854
I so move.
Okay. Seconded?

181
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,315
Seconded?

182
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,820
Oh, for crying
out loud, seconded.

183
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,167
Good night.
Good night.

184
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,296
Good night, Annie.
Night, Elliot.

185
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,798
See you, Elliot.

186
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,341
Bye, everyone.
Night, Elliot.

187
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,303
Good night, Carol. Fuck! Fuck!
Take him down, motherfuckers!

188
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,806
Jesus! Billy, get back in the car.

189
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,017
What?
Back in the car.

190
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,855
Hey, Billy, you're back.
That's great.

191
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,316
Yeah.

192
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,862
Staying with big brother Dan
and his beautiful wife Carol here

193
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,113
till I get my own pad.

194
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,531
Yeah, 'cause
little brother Billy

195
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,283
made a tiny little
pit stop in Bangkok

196
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,452
and blew all his Army pay.
Didn't he, Billy?

197
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:14,834
Bangkok, man.
Fucking Bangkok.

198
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,378
Come on, we gotta go.

199
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,425
Great seeing you
back home, Billy.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,865
Hey, Elliot.
Dave.

201
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,033
The usual?

202
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,660
Extra bacon, please.
You got it.

203
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,161
Hey, Elliot.
Max.

204
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,205
I hear you've moved
up here permanently.

205
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,290
Just helping Mom and
Dad for the season.

206
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,044
Well, I hope you have
another one of your festivals.

207
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,297
Miriam and I just love listening
to your records out on that lawn.

208
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,175
Sure, Max. This year, I'm going
to try to get a live quartet.

209
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,177
Looks like you're gonna
have some competition.

210
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,888
What, there's a recall vote
down at the Chamber of Commerce?

211
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,682
This says here
that Wallkill's

212
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,684
gonna have
a music festival, too.

213
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,310
Some hippie thing
got thrown out of Woodstock

214
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,771
so they've set
themselves up in Wallkill.

215
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,316
Wow, Janis Joplin.

216
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,194
Guess that beats playing a
bunch of records on a lawn.

217
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,489
Then again, it'll probably turn
into some kind of antiwar riot.

218
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,449
Let Wallkill have them.

219
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,994
Extra bacon.

220
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,204
You want your receipt?

221
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,372
Thanks, Dave.

222
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,291
See you later.
See you tomorrow, Max.

223
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,933
No, no, no,
that's horrible.

224
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,729
Tonight's dinner
will be roast turkey

225
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,564
and for dessert,
an apple tart.

226
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,529
I killed it!

227
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,406
That clock was
our mother's.

228
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,618
Your mother.
Your mother.

229
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,496
Maybe I didn't break it. Maybe
it only looks like I broke it.

230
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,918
Maybe we only think we
exist, when really we don't.

231
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,002
Hi, Elliot.

232
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,013
Thank you, Elliot.

233
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,640
It hasn't been touched
since my glory days

234
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,767
in the Midwood
High School band.

235
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,772
How's the show shaping up?
We're really getting into it.

236
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,524
Great. Hope you guys
are prepared.

237
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,778
You're probably gonna
outnumber the audience.

238
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,656
Only takes one extra soul
to make it theater, man.

239
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,200
And theater
is transformation.

240
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,287
But it's hard,
concentrating.

241
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,998
Concentrating on?

242
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,961
We're just,
I don't know, hungry.

243
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,796
Hungry? As in...

244
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,883
Yeah,
as in hungry, you know.

245
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,844
For, like, foodstuffs.

246
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:18,142
You don't have any potatoes
or sunflower seeds or anything?

247
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,189
I can barter some
very special grass. No.

248
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,441
Me and grass,
you don't want to know.

249
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,987
But let me see what I
can steal from my mom

250
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,322
and you guys can pay us
after the first show.

251
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,075
Or not, I guess.

252
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,162
Front row seats, man.
On the house, for you.

253
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,332
I'm bored! I'm bored! I'm bored!

254
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,252
That house was ours,
not his.

255
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,670
But he took out
that mortgage,

256
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,630
and now his wife
has all the money.

257
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,341
I can't take it any longer!
I can't! I can't!

258
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,846
Please throw me out, just
throw me out! I can't take it!

259
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,783
Hello?
Hey, Elliot.

260
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,913
Steven, hi. What are you
doing calling long distance?

261
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,249
I just made bail.

262
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,377
The pigs raided the bar
again. Can you believe it?

263
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:31,382
But you should come back. I think
we're going to have another riot.

264
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,594
Come up here. You can start
a riot here in White Lake.

265
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,804
It would be wild.

266
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,932
I was just calling,
you know.

267
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,435
New York hasn't been
as much fun without you.

268
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,480
I mean, it hasn't been as depressing,
but, you know, in a fun way.

269
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,483
So, me and Marcus, we're hitching
a ride with the art dealer.

270
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,817
Do you remember him?

271
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,820
The one with the doll
collection? Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

272
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,240
We're moving to San
Francisco, man. You wanna join?

273
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,662
Elliot? You there?

274
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,333
Yeah, I'm still here.

275
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,089
Hey, thanks for the call.
It's good to hear your voice.

276
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,927
And drop me a line
when you get there, okay?

277
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,887
Okay.

278
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,829
Elli. There's something
moving in the bushes!

279
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,473
Take cover, man.
Billy.

280
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,976
What is it?
We're surrounded, man.

281
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,812
Can't you feel it?

282
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,981
It's like, when
the radio was busted,

283
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,233
and we fragged
that fucking sergeant,

284
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,528
so then they just
leave us out here.

285
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,406
But someone's gotta go back
and call in air support,

286
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,657
'cause I gotta
stay with O'Connor.

287
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,993
He doesn't have
any feet, man.

288
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,954
It's okay, Billy.

289
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,540
The radio's working
in the office.

290
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,918
I can call from there.
And you can cover me, right?

291
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,298
And I'll do some
recon with the squad,

292
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:39,010
they can send up
some reinforcements,

293
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,679
and the VC
will never see me.

294
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,681
And I can call in
the coordinates.

295
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,100
What the fuck you
talking about, Elliot?

296
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,269
I don't know.

297
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,107
I thought maybe I could be in
your flashback or something.

298
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,194
If it made you
feel any better.

299
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,030
That's cool.

300
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,620
You all right?

301
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,636
Man, I am fucked up.

302
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,517
You think I should take those
pills they gave me at the VA?

303
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,312
I should probably just
take those fucking pills,

304
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,148
but then I just
sleep all the time,

305
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,985
and then there's the
fucking nightmares. Fuck.

306
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,162
Never thought I'd end
up back here. Me neither.

307
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,087
I'm thinking, maybe I
should do another tour.

308
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,381
That doesn't sound
like such a good idea.

309
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,929
Over in 'Nam, I'm fucking normal.
Do you know what I'm saying?

310
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,643
Hey, you should join up.

311
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,019
Me?
Yeah.

312
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,730
No. They wouldn't
take me even if I wanted.

313
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,607
Yeah?
Flat feet.

314
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,238
Right. Feet.

315
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,699
Fuck.

316
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,244
Yeah, you're not fucking
normal, Elliot. No.

317
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,579
I guess not.

318
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,379
All I know is we're
fucking surrounded here.

319
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,565
Eat.

320
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,844
Thank you, Elliot.

321
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,723
For the backdrops you painted for
all of us. Everybody loves the colors.

322
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,893
It's like a Mandela. Actually,
it's not like a Mandela.

323
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:37,772
Well, the colors,
it's more like M&M'S.

324
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,774
You're welcome, Dev.

325
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,110
Hey, you guys
want some? Cholent?

326
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,241
Maybe next time.

327
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,661
No, I'm cool.

328
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,791
Hey, man,
what's up with this?

329
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,793
The festival.
The locals killed it.

330
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,127
They pulled the permit.

331
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,504
In Wallkill?

332
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,591
The Wallkillians killed it. Bummer, man.

333
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:10,137
We were all hoping to score
some tickets and go over for it.

334
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:15,851
Could have been beautiful. Joan
Baez, Grateful Dead, The Who.

335
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,687
Maybe even Dylan.
Yeah, Dylan.

336
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Dylan.

337
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,485
Can I get that
paper for a sec?

338
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,824
Is everything
all right, Elliot?

339
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,038
Operator.

340
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,249
Hi, Alice. Can you connect
me with something called

341
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,585
the Woodstock Ventures
in New York City,

342
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,755
a gentleman by
the name of Michael Lang.

343
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,260
Elli! What is this
with the sheets?

344
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,971
What does it look like? I'm
making a big cross on the lawn!

345
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:56,434
With the clean sheets?
Jake, our boy's gone crazy!

346
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,437
Making a Ku Klux Klan
rally on our property!

347
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,981
No, it's so they can find us. Who?

348
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,343
Hey, man. Good to see you. Hi.

349
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,514
You don't remember
me, Elli?

350
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,517
Do we know each other?
Bensonhurst, 73rd Street.

351
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,520
I lived down the street from
you, man. We played stickball.

352
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,523
I'm Michael Lang,
you're Elli Teichberg.

353
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,360
Yeah, yeah, I kind of
remember, yeah. Mrs. Teichberg.

354
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,864
Hey, it's Michael, from
the neighborhood. Excuse me.

355
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,576
You! Cover your parts!
We have company!

356
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:43,207
In the barn. Get in the
barn! All of you! In!

357
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,751
Get inside!
Far out.

358
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,256
So, here we are.
Right.

359
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,049
Yes, as I mentioned
on the phone...

360
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,510
You have a permit.
That's very cool, Elli.

361
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,432
It's a start.

362
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,935
Very cool.

363
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
Please.

364
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,273
Mr. Teichberg.

365
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,926
Hey, people!
Welcome to Elliot's place.

366
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,596
Hey, Elli, can we
take a look around?

367
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,015
Of course, I'll show
you the whole place.

368
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,235
You've got some
open land here, right?

369
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,821
Absolutely,
just up here and down.

370
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,790
So...

371
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,601
Shit!

372
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,107
Michael, for Christ's sake,
it's a swamp.

373
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,320
Maybe we could get some bulldozers
in here and level it, right?

374
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,405
You're kidding me.
He owns it.

375
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,034
He's got a permit. He's the
President of the Chamber of Commerce.

376
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,329
And because of that you wanna
drown thousands of kids in a swamp?

377
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,831
Look, honestly, you guys can
do whatever you want to here.

378
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,708
That's fine
with us, really.

379
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,335
You could... For example,
you could detonate

380
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,878
an incredible amount
of explosives

381
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,214
and it would dry
everything out immediately.

382
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,716
And then you could just compact
the ashes down, you know,

383
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,094
and people could
sit on that.

384
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,600
Radical thinking, Elliot. I assume
you got a permit for that, too?

385
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,563
Or... Okay,
we get some big cranes

386
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,484
and hang, like, a parachute over the
field, and everyone could sit on it.

387
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,568
No?

388
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,530
How about you just
nuke the whole place?

389
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,449
Hey, don't lose
that creativity, man.

390
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,497
Jake, they are leaving!

391
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,919
Elli, have you offered
accommodation to everyone?

392
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,755
We may not have vacancy for
everyone, as the season is...

393
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,884
Ma, they're not staying.
Stay! Stay! Look.

394
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,638
My husband is
bringing refreshments.

395
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,266
Here. Thank you, Mrs. Teichberg.

396
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,020
Here. Try some of this.

397
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:56,692
It is the best chocolate milk in
New York. Made just down the road.

398
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,448
Have some water.
Or some chocolate milk.

399
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,662
What's his name? Or her. Lou.

400
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:13,208
Wow. That is excellent
chocolate milk.

401
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,044
Yeah, it comes from
the local cows. Far out.

402
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,340
They eat local grass. That
must be some healthy grass.

403
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,052
And there's a lot of it,
in big fields,

404
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,138
just a couple of miles
down the road from us.

405
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,608
I've always been a big supporter
of Elliot, here in Bethel,

406
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,444
and I always enjoy his
music festival every summer.

407
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:45,157
That's why we're here. Miriam and
I donate the yogurt and the milk.

408
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,619
It's fate.

409
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,038
It's beautiful.

410
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,918
Although some of the local
young people, the music they play

411
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,880
can be a little trying, if
you know what I mean, honestly.

412
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,591
Yeah, but it's the effort
that counts, isn't it, Miriam?

413
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,551
And they do
enjoy themselves.

414
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,929
There's a lot of joy
in music, Mr. Yasgur.

415
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,892
And we'd love to bring that joy to
your beautiful farm, wouldn't we?

416
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,775
Now, I know it's going to be
something of an imposition,

417
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,984
but we're more than
willing to do anything...

418
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,112
You say you want to
use these fields here?

419
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,448
Then you'll be needing the
land beside the barns as well,

420
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,076
I'm guessing,
for access to the roads.

421
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,744
And parking.

422
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,872
Probably best
across 17B.

423
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,835
I own the piece down the road,
but there are a couple of lots.

424
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,297
You'll probably want to
avoid dealing with the Browns.

425
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,926
And you'll clean up after
yourselves, I'm hoping.

426
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,344
Of course.

427
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,556
Well,

428
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,310
would $5,000
do it for you?

429
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,898
Five?

430
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,859
But you'll have to tidy up,
and you'll have to pay

431
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,361
for any damaged crops,
of course.

432
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,954
Sure, Max.
That sounds fine.

433
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,125
Good. Wonderful.

434
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,629
Well, why don't you all come into
the house for some chocolate milk?

435
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,465
Far out.

436
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,419
You know, we're gonna need
a place for people to crash

437
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,004
while we prepare
the festival.

438
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,589
Your place looks
pretty cool.

439
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,675
How many vacant rooms do you
have for the next couple of weeks?

440
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,220
Well, it depends on
how you define room.

441
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,972
You know, how many
people can crash with you.

442
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,432
What do you guys charge?

443
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:19,436
Let's see. It's $8 a night,
but that can be for doubles,

444
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,480
and we give a weekly
discount, of course.

445
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,692
Plus the cabins, you can
get cots, so four people,

446
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,235
about 150, I'd say.

447
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,113
You can get about 200 people.
Hey, man, let's make it easy.

448
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,325
Why don't we just buy the
El Monaco out for the season?

449
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:35,786
Just figure out the costs, write
it down, and we'll take a look.

450
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,954
And if we don't
use all the rooms,

451
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,246
you can rent out
the free ones.

452
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,998
We need to keep some cleanup
crews around afterwards.

453
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,375
And if you've got
some bigger spaces,

454
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,918
for offices,
that kind of thing.

455
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,295
We need to put in some phones and
have some space to park vehicles.

456
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,047
You know where we're going?

457
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,219
There you go.
That's the...

458
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,348
Looks like we can work
with this, Elli. Cool.

459
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:01,061
You know, I was thinking, I've got
that theater troupe in the barn.

460
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,813
A theater troupe
in the barn?

461
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,650
Yeah, the Earthlight Players.
It's okay if they stay, right?

462
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,237
Maybe you guys could find some
work for them or something.

463
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,572
They could really
use the pay.

464
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:16,660
They're all hired, man. Not
a problem. Great. Thanks.

465
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,999
And I hope you don't mind,
but we like to pay cash

466
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,961
in advance.

467
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,889
And not only that, he made me a local
community liaison for the festival,

468
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,559
and we're going to be the
exclusive local ticket agency, too.

469
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:44,354
They think at least 5,000 people
are gonna buy tickets, or more.

470
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,275
Five thousand coming
here to White Lake?

471
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,361
Elli, you're an idiot.

472
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,280
Twenty people, thirty,
okay, for a weekend.

473
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,365
But 1,000, 5,000?
They'll steal everything.

474
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,200
Ma... We'll be sued in
court by the neighbors.

475
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,204
What kind of meshuga, hairy, barefoot
person comes here in a heliocoptic

476
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,707
that we should lay our good white
sheets on the grass and ruin them,

477
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,126
and then plot and
revolutionize to take our hotel.

478
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,544
Ma, he pays cash.

479
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,671
Everyone pays cash here,
you shnook!

480
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,257
No, Ma, really.
Open it.

481
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,843
Open it.

482
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,975
That's $5,000 for the rent, and another
$5,000 for my services as liaison.

483
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,727
Plus, think of the money we're
gonna make off of commissions

484
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,604
From the ticket sales!
And also...

485
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,195
El Monaco International
Casino and Bar Mitzvah Center.

486
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,197
Elliot?
Hey, Max.

487
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:39,034
Hi. Well, the phone hasn't
stopped ringing since you left.

488
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,744
And they're saying...
I know.

489
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,330
...thousands of people might
be coming to this thing. Yeah.

490
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,248
Well, you know,
that's gonna cost

491
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,084
quite a bit to put
things back in order,

492
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,879
and to get the cows situated and
so forth. I can understand, sure.

493
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,839
Now, Elliot,
you know I don't wish

494
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,758
to mess up your festival.
You know that.

495
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,220
'Cause I think what was done to
those young people in Wallkill

496
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,932
was just plain wrong. But
I've been talking with Miriam,

497
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,060
and we think if you could just
go back and tell those people...

498
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,438
How much? Seventy-five
thousand. Not a penny less.

499
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,442
Okay, I'll let them know.

500
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,363
Okay, good. Bye-bye.

501
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,992
What?

502
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,871
Don't spend any of that money.
That was Max. The deal's off.

503
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,624
What? Impossible!

504
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,418
Ma. Ma. Ma.

505
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,713
Elli, don't try to stop her.
She can't get far.

506
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,342
And I read in the papers,
you've already sold

507
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:40,387
thousands of tickets,
and that's a lot.

508
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,805
And so you'll be
needing to use,

509
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,933
practically, my whole place
here, not just the alfalfa fields.

510
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,727
Now, wait a second.
I mean, I could...

511
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,649
I mean, I could buy a farm for the
kind of money you're asking for.

512
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,317
I could buy five farms.

513
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,278
From what I read in
the papers, Mr. Roberts,

514
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,655
you've already spent a
million dollars in Wallkill,

515
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,825
and you've only got until
the 15th until your festival.

516
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,286
Now, I'm sure a wealthy
young man such as yourself

517
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,705
could, indeed,
buy a lot of farms.

518
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,040
But that's neither here nor
there. All I'm saying is...

519
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,919
Yeah, all you're saying is that
you've got us over a barrel.

520
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,839
Well, if I didn't, you wouldn't
be on your second carton

521
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,425
of chocolate milk
now, would you?

522
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,137
But I tell you this, fellas, when
you make a deal with me, it's a deal.

523
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,639
Okay? So long as you promise
to put things back in order,

524
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,725
I'll stand by you 100%.

525
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,018
These people
are my neighbors,

526
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,686
and I know how
to deal with them.

527
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,981
I won't let them run you off
like they did in Wallkill,

528
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:36,443
'cause this is my land,
and let's just see them try.

529
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,072
Wow, Max, that is very
cool. And you're right.

530
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,574
We're going to
have a lot of people

531
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,034
come here and
enjoy your place.

532
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:48,038
Michael, if I may, I wouldn't
describe $75,000 as cool.

533
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,706
$5,000 is cool.

534
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,958
Hey, it's your bread, guys.

535
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,170
I'm just trying to put you
together here with Max's vision.

536
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:01,509
Right. Look, Max, if we were
willing to consider doing this,

537
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,386
you're really gonna have to
let us make it work.

538
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:07,390
Mike, listen, really, if this
doesn't shake out with Max...

539
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,392
I'm sure we're
gonna be fine.

540
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,938
John and Joel and Max, they're
all gonna come together.

541
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:14,981
I can feel it.

542
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,276
Good vibes.

543
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,613
He won't let them near it.
Smithson? Who's Smithson?

544
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,241
I don't own the property down
there. You don't own the property?

545
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,409
I own this
and I own that,

546
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,038
which reminds me, I'm sure you'll
be willing to put up a bond,

547
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:34,376
just in case there's damage.
I was thinking $75,000.

548
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,711
Fuck!
A $75,000 bond, too?

549
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,424
Can I ask you a question? Please.

550
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:45,553
Is Mike for real?
I mean, he's so relaxed.

551
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:51,101
Michael, yeah,
he's totally real,

552
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,980
so long as
the cash is real.

553
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,607
And the cash is real so long
as John and Joel are real.

554
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,069
And I guess John and Joel
are gonna stay real because,

555
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:05,365
between us, they've already
sold 100,000 tickets.

556
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,246
And who wants 100,000 freaks
coming after them for refunds?

557
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,292
So Mikey is trying
to sell those six acres.

558
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,252
It's got a lake?
Yeah.

559
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,895
Hey, Dave.
I'll have the usual.

560
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:40,025
Geez, sorry, Elliot. I
think we're out of the usual.

561
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:47,365
Out of the usual?
Wow, that's unusual.

562
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,410
For crying out loud, Elliot.
How could you?

563
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,041
Okay, then I'll try
the waffles.

564
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,514
"To ensure three days of peace
and music, we've left Wallkill

565
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,725
"and are now in
White Lake, New York.

566
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,729
"Certain people of Wallkill decided
to try to run us out of town.

567
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:23,401
"Our new site, it's twice the
size of our original site. "

568
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,236
You did this, Teichberg.

569
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,238
You know what those hippies
are gonna do to our town?

570
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,782
They'll be high on drugs.

571
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,576
Robbing us by day and
raping the cattle at night.

572
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,246
We ought to run you Jews
out of town. You and Yasgur.

573
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,416
We're gonna boycott Yasgur's
milk. Shut the hotel down, too.

574
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,962
Get out of here, you hippie.
You're disgusting, Elliot.

575
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,802
You know what, Elliot?
You're not the only...

576
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,889
Elliot! God bless you.
Hi, Annie.

577
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,766
You can't imagine
what happened this morning.

578
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,685
What? I'm fully booked! Every room!

579
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,396
Yeah, me, too.
For the first time

580
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,314
since Herb died.
Thank you, Elliot.

581
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,066
You're welcome.
Thank you, Elliot.

582
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,031
Hi.

583
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,373
Those motherfuckers in
there wanna fuck you up, huh?

584
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,750
That seems to be
the sense I'm getting.

585
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:26,172
Well, you're gonna have to carve
some fucking hearts out, man.

586
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,884
Fry them on a stick
over a fire pit

587
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:33,346
and then sit down and eat
them, before those motherfuckers

588
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,557
do the aforesaid
fucking to you, man!

589
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,058
Billy, can you just stop
with the motherfucking this

590
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,185
and motherfucking that.
Please?

591
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,774
Fuck.
Yeah. Fuck.

592
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,826
This could really
be a down trip.

593
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,912
My brother and his wife, they're
getting fucking organized.

594
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,122
Then what should I do?

595
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,709
Get fucking organized
yourself. Rally your troops.

596
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,045
Do I have troops?
Fuck, yeah.

597
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,675
You got your mom, don't you?
She's a fucking battalion.

598
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,388
And the Chamber of Commerce. This
whole thing is about commerce, right?

599
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,891
Right on!
Right on.

600
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:26,524
I'm off to HQ.
At ease, men... Man.

601
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,577
Go fry those fuckers.
Elliot!

602
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:06,481
We were in Wallkill.

603
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,025
Hanging with some friends,
making the scene.

604
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:12,737
Rapping on each other. And
they said this is where it's at.

605
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,949
So we rode our thumbs
up here. Can you dig it?

606
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,661
Elli, help.

607
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,289
It's these two.
They want a hole.

608
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,832
To dig their thumbs.

609
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,461
After they hit each other,
they made a scene in Wallkill!

610
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,922
What are they
talking about?

611
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,467
Just looking to score,
you know, the magic tickets.

612
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,179
Dad, get the tickets.
To the festival.

613
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,783
Okay, Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

614
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,579
Heading back up
to that first step.

615
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,040
But it's adequate
to get back up.

616
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,877
Roger. We copy. Takes a
pretty good little jump.

617
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,557
Hey. Hi, Tisha. What is it?

618
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,393
You've got
a couple of visitors.

619
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,200
Hello? What can
I do for you?

620
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,493
Mr. Teichberg?
Yes.

621
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:46,914
Here. That's 47 citations. Wiring,
plumbing, health code violations.

622
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,833
Quite a place
you've got here.

623
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,795
It's humble, but it's home.
Away from home, I mean.

624
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,507
And here's 14 more fire code.
You're way over the occupancy limits.

625
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,301
You've got five days
to pay up and repair

626
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,470
or else we're shutting
you down for good.

627
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,221
Have a nice day.

628
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,993
What's going on?

629
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,162
Your mother says we
can triple our money.

630
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,955
Three times the rooms.

631
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,499
You're kidding me.

632
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:35,129
They don't seem to mind. Honest.
These people, they like it.

633
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,548
I'm finished here,
you start on the bunking.

634
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,468
I don't know. White Lake
sounds better than Wallkill.

635
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,345
Don't ask me why
they call it Woodstock.

636
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,389
Everyone's gonna drive
to the fucking real Woodstock

637
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,182
and be really bummed
when they get there.

638
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,644
DOT's letting us put signage
up. Just not on the Thruway yet.

639
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,229
But we're working on it.
We're gonna want to run lines

640
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,355
all the way
back to the fence.

641
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,690
Can you trench here?

642
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,442
No, man. Everything,
water pipes, juice,

643
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,069
all the cables
gotta run aboveground.

644
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,279
I got the specs from
Hanley, for the speakers.

645
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,531
That's a lot of juice.

646
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,033
When Hendrix lights up, there won't
be a bird left in Sullivan County.

647
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,452
Hey, I spoke to Wavy Gravy
and the Hog Farmers.

648
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,537
Wavy?
Yeah.

649
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,290
His real name's Hugh. He's
got 80 freaks, the Hog Farmers.

650
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,626
They've got a commune
in the desert.

651
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,045
They drop more acid
than Timothy Leary.

652
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,423
There's 80 of them coming
in on a jumbo jet next week.

653
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,718
Hey, man, I can't find
the keys to my room.

654
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,219
Ask my mom.

655
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,055
Hey, how's your room?
Fine, man.

656
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,516
Trip tents? Yeah, where
the kids can come down...

657
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:31,227
From the trip. Wait, wait.
What have you got here?

658
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,812
No, no.
Don't put it down there.

659
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,064
He and his people are willing
to work with you on security.

660
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,192
You know, they really like your
non-confrontational approach.

661
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,320
You know, they wanna
call it a "Please Force. "

662
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,031
Not sure how Fabbri's
going to like that moniker.

663
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,783
We're still going
to need real police.

664
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,996
Hey, Mike,
do you have a second?

665
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,831
I'm just feeling
a little anxious.

666
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,374
Did Tisha tell you about
these code violations?

667
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,792
Hey, Elliot. Just the
man I wanted to see.

668
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,210
You know,
I'm getting the feeling

669
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,587
that we're really
going to be able to use

670
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,880
your community
relations skills.

671
00:45:58,964 --> 00:45:59,922
My what skills?

672
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,466
Because, Elli, the rumors
are already swirling,

673
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,968
and we need to put a local
face on the reality here.

674
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,429
And you, Elli,
are a local face.

675
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,765
I'm a local face, yes,
but about these violations.

676
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,850
There's not a hotel around for
miles that could pass inspection.

677
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,686
Those inspector dudes?
Don't worry about that, Elli.

678
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:17,106
Tisha told me all about those
guys. Just give us the papers.

679
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,692
We've got some
heavy lawyers. Right?

680
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,154
Heavy lawyers. Right.

681
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,864
Because right now,
Elli, I need you to focus

682
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,532
on the positive message
that we're sending.

683
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,951
You know, rapping with
the local townspeople,

684
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,454
finding some time
with some of the papers here.

685
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,998
Wait, you mean like
a press conference?

686
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:39,170
A press conference. Yeah.
Radical idea, Elli. I love it.

687
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,798
No, actually, you don't.
Me and public speaking,

688
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,050
I can guarantee you,
not one of my strong suits.

689
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,259
I'm speaking from
experience here.

690
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,970
Hey, Michael. Hey. I
want you to meet somebody.

691
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,472
Let me introduce
you to Reverend Don.

692
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,140
He's helping with
our community outreach

693
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,308
and he'd love it if
you could help him

694
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,977
get to know the locals. Hi.
It's really great to meet you.

695
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,229
I don't know how
much Michael's told you,

696
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:57,563
but we're thinking
of putting on

697
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,482
a little free concert
for the local people here,

698
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,275
and we thought it
would be a great idea to

699
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,860
include a scene from
your theater company.

700
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,862
Do you think
they'd be open to it?

701
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:08,991
Yeah, they'd love that. But
you said it's for the locals?

702
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,078
Because the play's
very contemporary. Cool.

703
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,914
Hey, hey, you guys,
the phones are alive.

704
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,252
Mike.

705
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,382
Hey, your dad wants you.

706
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,613
I'll get some paint, but they're
just going to do it again.

707
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,825
They set foot here again,
I break their heads.

708
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,743
Dad, let me call...

709
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,789
Call who? That little
putz in the green shirt,

710
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,624
he's the son of
that state trooper.

711
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,295
I could boil him and his
putz of a father in tar.

712
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:06,048
Just, Dad, let's just get this
painted before Mom sees it.

713
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:08,801
Then you can start
warming up the tar.

714
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,862
Thanks.

715
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,031
Put some more of
those in the cooler.

716
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,158
Dad, this is all we got.

717
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,409
You didn't order more?

718
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,828
I did. And I called Karpen's,
too, for the kitchen.

719
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,538
I asked them all to
bring 10 times our usual.

720
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,706
Well, when they
come tomorrow,

721
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,833
you tell them to
bring 20 times more.

722
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,793
No, 30 times.

723
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,296
Where are we
going to put it all?

724
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,050
These people, they eat
and drink like animals,

725
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,887
and there's more of
them every minute.

726
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:58,517
It doesn't matter where we
put it. It'll be gone in a day.

727
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,063
Yes?
Couple of Buds, please.

728
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,106
$2. Thank you.

729
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,863
You got that thing working? Yeah.

730
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,782
Don't touch those wires.

731
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,035
Let's see what you got
to put on. Nothing much.

732
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:30,424
Judy Garland live. Haven't
heard this in a long time.

733
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,681
It's hard to
believe she's gone.

734
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,476
Actually, I can believe
it. I met her once.

735
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,561
Wow. Was she fun?

736
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,147
She was brimming over.

737
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:47,984
I'm Elliot.

738
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:52,822
Hey. Paul. Construction. You
seen the stage we're building?

739
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,490
No.
It's huge.

740
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:57,034
Wow. Do you want
another beer?

741
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,120
No, thanks.
I've got a thing going

742
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,330
with some Lebanese Red
right now.

743
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,583
Your old man doesn't mind
if we light up in here?

744
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,336
He can't smell.
Too much roofing tar.

745
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:15,469
Cool.

746
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,265
More. More, come on.

747
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,436
Okay, okay.
Good. Good, good, good.

748
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,443
$40.
Ma.

749
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:35,448
Ma. Tisha says you're trying to charge
extra for pillows and soap again.

750
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,242
We talked about this.

751
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,952
Don't accuse me!

752
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,913
I got nothing to sell anyway,
not even toilet paper!

753
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,623
Which leads me to ask, where
do you think all these people

754
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,625
you're renting space to are
going to do their business?

755
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,919
You've got to stop, Ma.
Enough with the money.

756
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,047
We just paid
off the mortgage.

757
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,382
Think about it!
Can't you just be happy?

758
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,760
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

759
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,845
Hey!
No! No!

760
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,806
No shtupping in the bushes! Ma, come on.

761
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,059
Come on.

762
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,603
Excuse me, when does
the ticket office open?

763
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,313
Not yet! Soon!

764
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,529
Good morning. You must be
the lovely wife and child.

765
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,407
What's up, Dad?

766
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,159
We were just
telling your pops here

767
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,621
it looks like you guys are
getting some nice business.

768
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,789
Yeah?

769
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,583
So, it looks like
you can use some help.

770
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,794
He's talking
nonsense, Elli.

771
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:35,341
Something about exclusive
transportation and security for $10,000.

772
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,972
I get it. No, you
don't get it. We get it.

773
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,018
You got live entertainment
happening here, beverages, etcetera.

774
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:51,440
Yeah. We cover the hotels around the
racetrack in Monticello. We cover you.

775
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,068
And what if I say
you don't?

776
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,321
Charlie, what do we
do if he says we don't?

777
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:01,200
You're trespassers. Get
out, or I make you get out.

778
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,952
Is that so?

779
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,121
You hear this?

780
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,832
Enough with these bums!

781
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,252
Dad, what're you doing? Stop.

782
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,921
Hey, come on. Hey!
No, stop!

783
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,801
Come on, get...
Christ almighty!

784
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,521
Go on.
Get out of here!

785
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,149
Jesus! You people
are like animals.

786
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,862
Get out!
Get out of my property!

787
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,531
I'll show you!

788
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,909
Get off my property!

789
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,372
Get out! Don't try
to come back here!

790
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,749
Next time we
won't be so nice!

791
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,840
My arthritis is killing me. I told
you not to stand at the bar all night.

792
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,842
Dad, Ma,
you're superheroes.

793
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,219
Far out.

794
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,596
You didn't
tell me anything.

795
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,973
How would you know what
I tell you? You're deaf.

796
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,298
Hey, Elliot.
Hey.

797
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:41,634
What do you think
of the mess we're making?

798
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,803
It's...
Wonderful, isn't it?

799
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,847
It is. Yeah, Max.

800
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,892
I'm just sorry everyone
in town hates our guts now.

801
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,019
Yours more than mine.
If that's even possible.

802
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:55,606
Sorry? Hell,
these kids are fantastic.

803
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,734
I've heard more thank yous and
pleases in the past three days

804
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:01,946
than I've heard in a
lifetime from those shmucks.

805
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,490
And believe me,
no matter what they tell you,

806
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,409
they're all trying to make
money off this thing, too.

807
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,246
I saw Bob charge
a dollar to fill a bottle

808
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,248
with water for
one of these kids.

809
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,832
A dollar?
Yeah, can you believe it?

810
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,628
A dollar. For water. Geez.

811
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,288
Four extra.

812
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,874
Four.
Yeah.

813
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,802
Elliot. You're
Elliot Tiber, right?

814
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,429
Yeah, that's me.

815
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,764
How can I help you, Miss... Vilma.

816
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,309
Vetty Von Vilma,
but you can call me Vilma.

817
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,477
Vilma.
What brings you here?

818
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,980
I'm supposed to
say hi from Steve.

819
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,774
Steve?
From the Village?

820
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,444
Steven?
He's gone now.

821
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,780
Off to San Francisco with a flower
in his hair on his sugar daddy's lap.

822
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:30,242
Yeah. Actually, my ex-sugar daddy.

823
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,120
Good riddance. He does
like them mean and rich,

824
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,497
doesn't he, our Steven?
He's very...

825
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:39,543
Anyhow, he said you might be starting
some sort of a gay resort here.

826
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:44,006
Well, resorting as well as
reclining is my specialty.

827
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,508
And as I was on my way to
visit my mother in Buffalo,

828
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,344
I thought I'd stop by.

829
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:51,013
Look what I stumbled into.

830
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:55,684
By the way, those clowns you and
your dear parents chased off...

831
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,395
Not nice people. I know.

832
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,857
I was playing the horses,
if you know what I mean,

833
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,193
over by the racetrack
in Monticello.

834
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,861
Nice bedroom community,
actually,

835
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,739
until that bunch tried to
confiscate my earnings.

836
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,533
You think they'll
be back? Here?

837
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:16,163
All I can say is you need
help. What kind of help?

838
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,422
That's nothing. You should
see what I'm packing up here.

839
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,926
My God.
I know.

840
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,762
But keeping to the subject
at hand for the moment,

841
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:36,308
you do need some real security
around here. And you're real security?

842
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,895
What?
Well, you don't look...

843
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,524
Okay, I may be a grandfather,
but... You're a grandfather?

844
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:47,069
I married young, the night
before I shipped out for Korea.

845
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,655
You were in Korea? Semper
fi, you little prick.

846
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,490
Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps.

847
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,826
No kidding.
Yeah.

848
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:01,750
That's me with the cigar. The
other one was the love of my life.

849
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,420
Killed. Sniper.

850
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:07,673
I went out on patrol, found
the Chinese pissant who did it,

851
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,050
and broke his neck with
my own hands. Jesus.

852
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,427
Actually, I made
that last part up.

853
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,262
But I would have if I'd gotten
a hold of the son of a bitch,

854
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,347
and I'd do it today
if I found him.

855
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:21,311
Vilma, you're hired.
Thank you.

856
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,939
Welcome aboard.
You won't regret it.

857
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:29,361
Do you need some kind of
uniform? I've got uniforms, baby.

858
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:49,882
Hey, Elliot.
She's a beautiful ride.

859
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,385
Great way to
commute to Max's.

860
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,807
That's a nice suit. It's
for the press. Conference.

861
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,392
Sure.

862
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,438
You okay?
A little nervous.

863
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:05,856
Got just the thing.

864
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,863
You know, actually, I'm
feeling a little nauseous.

865
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,908
Hey, grass is a perfect
cure for nausea.

866
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,660
Really?
Seriously.

867
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,579
Well...

868
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,083
Yeah.

869
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,253
It's good shit.
Very good shit.

870
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,676
...and in these next few days
before the concert,

871
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,845
we'll also provide
daily briefings

872
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,014
and we're all here to
provide any follow up.

873
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:42,893
But without further delay,
here is Mr. Elliot Tiber,

874
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,478
the proprietor of
the El Monaco,

875
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,688
President of the Bethel
Chamber of Commerce,

876
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:50,609
and a community liaison for
Woodstock Ventures. Mr. Tiber.

877
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,908
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen of the press.

878
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,827
Do you have a legal permit
for the concert in White Lake?

879
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:07,668
There will be a music and arts festival
held here on August 15th, 16th, and 17th,

880
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:10,212
part of my ongoing yearly
music and arts festivals

881
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:14,091
that have made White Lake the truly
international cultural center that it is.

882
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,134
As evidenced by the fact that
you wonderful ladies and gentlemen

883
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,345
of the press are
here to report on it.

884
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,389
I have been proud to be the
artistic director of the festival

885
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,307
in its prior incarnations,
and I hope that...

886
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:25,018
Yes, but do you have a
legal permit for the concert?

887
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,231
Of course.

888
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,276
Need I remind you,
I am the President.

889
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,737
I am the President of the
Bethel Chamber of Commerce.

890
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,658
Would a leading civic leader
such as myself break his own laws?

891
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,368
That doesn't make sense.

892
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,829
Do you realize that the
police are now estimating

893
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:48,041
that perhaps as many as 100,000
people will attend the concert?

894
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,503
What will your people here in
White Lake think of 100,000 hippies

895
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,589
and what they
will do to the town?

896
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,510
My people?
You say my people.

897
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:02,556
Native White Lakians
cannot be considered people,

898
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,351
you know,
mine or anyone else's.

899
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,441
Can you tell us something
about these free programs

900
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,735
for the local community
happening this week?

901
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:17,863
Will there be a cap on
the number of tickets sold,

902
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,700
and how will you deal with
people showing up without tickets?

903
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,122
You are asking
about freedom.

904
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,750
The very essence
of the enterprise,

905
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,253
of all enterprise,
especially free enterprise.

906
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,841
And freedom
could be considered,

907
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:42,929
and is often considered, you know, to
be just another word for being free.

908
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:49,061
Therefore, there will be no train to
freedom. Train has already left the station.

909
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:56,234
How can the music be free when the
people of White Lake are enchained?

910
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:01,031
If one song is not free,
then all songs are not free.

911
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:05,327
That is why we are going to
free all the songs in White Lake.

912
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:08,205
Any idea what the hell
is going on here?

913
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:19,466
Wow, Elliot.
You stood strong up there.

914
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,594
That freedom rap, yeah.
That was heavy.

915
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,349
Thanks, Mike. You smell good.
Like an apple fritter.

916
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,851
Far out.

917
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:04,803
What's happening?

918
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:08,181
Didn't you hear?
It's free, man.

919
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:11,309
Come on.
The concert's free.

920
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,567
Come on, let's go.
Stop. Here.

921
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,611
That's it.
That's it.

922
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:28,243
Come on. Let's go. Let's
go. Come on, let's go.

923
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:30,412
Dad!

924
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:33,832
Let's go.

925
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,086
Come on.
We've got an artist here.

926
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:42,424
He's been out here two
hours already. Won't budge.

927
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,510
All right, come on.
Come here. Just wait.

928
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,638
All right. Hold it!

929
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,363
Your dad says
you're a painter.

930
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,074
When did he say that?

931
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:13,580
I had him give me a tour of the property,
you know, getting a lay of the land.

932
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,543
He talked a lot about you,
about Brooklyn.

933
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:26,259
He showed me some of his favorite
places, the oaks down by the lake.

934
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,054
Nice.

935
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,305
Wait.

936
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:34,476
Are you sure that was my dad?
Maybe it was somebody else's?

937
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,315
I mean, he doesn't have any
favorite places here, he hates it.

938
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,691
He doesn't talk.

939
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:46,863
I didn't say it was therapy or
anything, you know. It was just chatting.

940
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,574
Chatting?
His mind must be going.

941
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:55,497
Don't worry, Elliot.
I'll keep an eye on him.

942
01:03:56,499 --> 01:04:00,418
If he starts to laugh or smile
or anything suspicious like that,

943
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,254
I'll let you know.

944
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,882
Yeah. You do that.

945
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:15,725
In fact, I have to go collect
his bat, we've got dawn patrol.

946
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,563
Vilma?

947
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:29,239
Does my dad know,
you know, what you are?

948
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,245
Elliot.

949
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,081
I know what I am.

950
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:42,377
That does make it easier for
everyone else, doesn't it?

951
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,558
After the concert, we've got
tables set up near the barn.

952
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,768
I understand your mother
is preparing her specialty.

953
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,186
Cholent? Oh, no.

954
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,397
And the Ladies Auxiliary
has made dessert.

955
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,232
We just have to make sure
somebody rations them.

956
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,401
There's a lot of hungry
kids out there.

957
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:09,571
Don, I just want to say,
I have a feeling.

958
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,239
Feelings?
Feelings are good.

959
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,409
Get over to the south field,
find what-is-his-name,

960
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:15,827
and round up all those...

961
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,830
They don't really know where
to put all the sunflower seeds.

962
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,541
How many sunflower seeds
did they buy?

963
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:27,797
How many sunflower seeds can you get into
the back of a triple-axle trailer truck?

964
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,133
I'm not sure. I'm sorry. We
actually have another meeting...

965
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,344
Everybody's working
hard for...

966
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,720
Yes. Very hard.

967
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,348
Hey, John.
That's him.

968
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,558
That's the prick who told
everyone that the concert's free.

969
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:39,726
Fuck the alfalfa...

970
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,938
Considering that we haven't
managed to build a ticket booth yet,

971
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,439
can't really
argue with him.

972
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:47,192
It's incredible. Knocking down
the walls, and all kinds of stuff.

973
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,735
Well, we gotta make
some space in here, but...

974
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,196
Doris? Doris,
he doesn't... Doris?

975
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,365
He doesn't even know
what a purchase order is.

976
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:55,241
I'm trying to help organize
moving everybody

977
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,494
from here in the horseshoe
up to the site.

978
01:05:57,578 --> 01:06:00,413
Trucks, trailers,
everything, gotta go.

979
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,957
Gonna miss this place.

980
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:05,085
Yeah, well,
we'll keep some rooms here.

981
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:08,380
The one concern is the big
towers for the speakers.

982
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,466
They're not staying up?
No, they're good. Solid.

983
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:16,888
It's just that if there's rain,
lightning, well, might get a little...

984
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,598
A little what?

985
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,350
Electrical.
We're working on it.

986
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:23,103
Yeah, we don't wanna
fry too much of the audience.

987
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,605
Yeah, that's a good point,
Joel. Thank you, John.

988
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:29,025
Hey. It's August.
It's not gonna rain.

989
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,486
Remember, okay?
Rice, bananas,

990
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,822
anything that's gonna
keep them from shitting.

991
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,241
Because I'm worried
about our toilet numbers.

992
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:57,178
Now we're together nearly
every single day, singin'

993
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,102
We're so happy and that's
how we're gonna stay, singin'

994
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:11,067
No, no one stole the car, I just
gotta keep it for a few days.

995
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,569
Sure, it's legal.

996
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:16,990
Everything is fine, Mom. Don't worry.
I've met so many beautiful people here.

997
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:40,221
Thank you.
Hairy Pretzel, thank you.

998
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,599
It's so great that you have
let us share your music

999
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:45,727
with all your friends and your
parents, here in White Lake.

1000
01:07:45,811 --> 01:07:47,353
Now we would like
to introduce to you

1001
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,482
the resident theater artists,
here at the El Monaco this summer,

1002
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,150
the Earthlight Players,

1003
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:55,528
who have adapted Anton
Chekhov's classic, Three Sisters,

1004
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:59,407
to a contemporary,
happening interpretation,

1005
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:03,244
and they would like now to share
a part of that experience with you.

1006
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,830
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Earthlight Players.

1007
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:22,347
Artifice and imagination!
Truth and fiction!

1008
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,891
The players play!

1009
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:29,687
But you, the audience,
you sit and judge.

1010
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,731
You sit and judge.
You sit and judge.

1011
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,151
But the revolution requires
the roles must be reversed!

1012
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,197
The players
are the judges now.

1013
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:44,702
Your revelry must end, and your
souls will be bared for all to see.

1014
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:49,124
Christ who died for you,
but not for me!

1015
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,875
Now we are Christ!

1016
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,380
Our nakedness
will reveal your own.

1017
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:59,217
Indecent legions of decency!
Indecent legions of decency!

1018
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,178
Fascist pornographers!
Fascist pornographers!

1019
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,140
Racist warmongers!
Racist warmongers!

1020
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,476
Republican cocksuckers!
Republican cocksuckers!

1021
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,478
Indecent legions of decency!
Indecent legions of decency!

1022
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:14,440
Fascist pornographers!
Fascist pornographers!

1023
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:18,987
Put your clothes back on.

1024
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,701
Billy. Billy.
Jesus Christ.

1025
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,332
Racist warmongers!

1026
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:38,089
Fascist pornographers!
Fascist pornographers!

1027
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,258
Billy!

1028
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,428
Billy!
Get your ass down here!

1029
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,139
Get your ass down here!

1030
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:51,394
Billy!

1031
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,793
Everything is gone...
Annie?

1032
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,420
Elliot. Namaste.

1033
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,923
Hi, Elliot.
Namaste, dear Elliot.

1034
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,472
Hey, Georgette.
How are we doing?

1035
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:11,015
Hey, Elliot.
Hey, guys.

1036
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,103
Hey.

1037
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,896
Here.
Hey.

1038
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,147
Thanks.
All right.

1039
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:20,692
Where we going with these?
Barn.

1040
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:24,696
Stan and your theater guy set
up some medical volunteers.

1041
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,782
The combination of the bare
feet and the brown acid...

1042
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:29,409
Real.
Yeah.

1043
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:34,414
Anyway, I hope you don't mind, we
just were grabbing everything we can.

1044
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:36,291
And your mom gave me
these blankets.

1045
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,085
My mom? Gave?

1046
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,462
Yeah. She's cool.

1047
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,308
Hey.

1048
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:55,393
Hey, Dad?

1049
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:57,812
Dad.

1050
01:11:57,896 --> 01:12:00,273
The New York State Thruway
has been backed up all the way

1051
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,608
from the George Washington
Bridge to the Catskills exits,

1052
01:12:02,693 --> 01:12:05,153
and from there,
it's basically a parking lot.

1053
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,988
Police are now planning
to put into effect

1054
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:10,199
a first-ever emergency
closing of the entire Thruway.

1055
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,994
We go now to John Stevens,
who is in the field...

1056
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:14,746
Ma, you okay?

1057
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,748
The nisht-gute...

1058
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,458
Evil!

1059
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,169
You seen the chicken legs
on some of these hairy people?

1060
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,713
Mom, they're kids,
not evil spirits.

1061
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:25,006
You don't know!

1062
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:29,302
They've made all the roads one-way
now, Elli, one-way just to Max's.

1063
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,720
God forbid,
what if your father

1064
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:32,680
should have a heart attack
from all this running around?

1065
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,599
He couldn't get
to the hospital.

1066
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,185
You're really worried
about him, aren't you?

1067
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:40,646
Him? It's you
who brought this.

1068
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:43,149
How will you live
with the guilt?

1069
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:07,507
Hit him in the kisser, hit him
in the guts, nine, ten, out!

1070
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,017
Hey. Give me three.

1071
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,602
How you doing, Dad?

1072
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,312
How should I be doing?

1073
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:25,650
I haven't slept in three days, my hip
is killing me, and the beer's warm.

1074
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:30,154
So, you're good? Yeah, I'm
good. Hand me that bottle.

1075
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:33,616
You're ready for one?

1076
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,035
I thought you'd never ask.

1077
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:39,330
How you doing, kid?

1078
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:43,793
I haven't slept in three
days, the beer's warm,

1079
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:46,796
I'm actually not making this
up, but my hip is killing me.

1080
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,172
So, you're good?

1081
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,696
Come on, Elliot.

1082
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:18,596
I'm standing near the
intersection of Route 17B and 55,

1083
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,350
where state authorities now estimate
that perhaps half a million kids

1084
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,227
have already made it
to the White Lake area,

1085
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:27,688
and there's another million trying to
get here who will just never make it,

1086
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:31,442
putting upstate communities in an
uproar at this major hippie invasion.

1087
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,031
Bob!

1088
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:39,450
What's this all about?

1089
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:43,454
We got the permit pulled, you idiot!
We're shutting this thing down!

1090
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,666
But there's a half a million
people over at Max's.

1091
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,000
How do you think
they're gonna react?

1092
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,127
That's the same thing
the cops said...

1093
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,464
Before they laughed at us
as if we were children.

1094
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,800
So we're doing it
ourselves!

1095
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:56,968
Right.

1096
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:00,805
Hi, Elliot!

1097
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:10,648
Come on.

1098
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,693
Not so tough anymore,
are you?

1099
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,278
Come on, you.

1100
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,321
Go to hell!

1101
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,575
Fuck you, old man!

1102
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:21,993
You get off my property,

1103
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,036
you thugs.
You faggot freak.

1104
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,418
Hippie lover!

1105
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:41,429
This is where
we rinse the sheets.

1106
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,226
Hey, brother.

1107
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,120
You hear that?

1108
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:08,873
It's starting.

1109
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:28,601
Elli,

1110
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,854
you should go.

1111
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,482
What?

1112
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:35,691
To Max's.

1113
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:37,485
I can't.
You guys would...

1114
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,695
We can take care
of things here.

1115
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,365
Dad...
You go.

1116
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,077
Go see this thing.

1117
01:17:47,621 --> 01:17:48,621
Go.

1118
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:52,249
See what the center
of the universe looks like.

1119
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,885
Yeah, sure.

1120
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:31,205
Bet you thought you were just gonna
drive right up to the thing, huh?

1121
01:18:31,331 --> 01:18:33,874
Actually, my family,
we own the motel here.

1122
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,459
The El Monaco, huh?

1123
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:38,504
So you're the guy they're all
blaming for bringing all this here.

1124
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:42,091
Governor just declared this
whole county a disaster area.

1125
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:46,887
Yeah, it's a disaster. I'm
the disaster guy, officially.

1126
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:51,225
No kidding. I was looking
forward to just coming up here

1127
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,978
and clubbing a bunch of
hippies over the head.

1128
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,814
But instead,
I don't know.

1129
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,066
I must be getting
high off the fumes.

1130
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,192
Peace, man.

1131
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,738
See what I mean?

1132
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:04,989
Groovy.

1133
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,992
I think I'm gonna head over
and check it all out.

1134
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,870
On foot? It’ll take you
all afternoon with this crowd.

1135
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:12,079
Here.

1136
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,247
Thanks.

1137
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,370
Officer.

1138
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,166
What do you say to all those
young men fighting in Vietnam

1139
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,501
while you're here
enjoying yourselves?

1140
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:43,921
We're waging peace, man. We're
teaching peace to the world.

1141
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:47,049
You think they're gonna understand
that? While they're bleeding and dying?

1142
01:20:47,133 --> 01:20:48,717
Why won't they...

1143
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,761
Find your buddy, girls!

1144
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:00,479
The innocent people
of North Vietnam...

1145
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:02,940
Bombs for peace!
Bombs for peace!

1146
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,109
War bombs for peace!
War bombs for peace!

1147
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,489
Yeah,
dream on there, buddy.

1148
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:12,116
Hey, it could happen.

1149
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:30,885
I know you can do it.
Come on, just for fun.

1150
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:35,264
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Sister.

1151
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:36,515
Peace to you.

1152
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,683
Thank you.

1153
01:21:37,767 --> 01:21:38,767
God bless you.

1154
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,722
Come on, burn them, sisters!

1155
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:18,682
Burn your bras and read this!

1156
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,859
You've gotta join
this demonstration.

1157
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:33,322
Stop the pollution.
Keep our rivers clean.

1158
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,126
Hey, man.

1159
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:30,004
Hey.
Hey.

1160
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,755
You look thirsty.

1161
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:34,008
I am.

1162
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,513
Thanks.

1163
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:52,234
Have you guys been down
to see the festival yet?

1164
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:54,987
We're cool,
and we'll get there again.

1165
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,948
We got to the top of the hill,
and looked down at the sea,

1166
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:02,703
and the tiny little people on stage
with their waves of tiny electric voices.

1167
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:07,124
Like ants making thunder,
man. It was cool.

1168
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,878
But you couldn't really tell
who was jamming down there.

1169
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,129
And we left our trip
in the car.

1170
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:16,508
And the shit they're passing
around down there, not quality.

1171
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,303
Ours is beautiful.

1172
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:25,559
I see you have California
plates. Is that where you're from?

1173
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:27,186
There, and New Mexico...

1174
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:28,896
And Oregon.

1175
01:24:29,856 --> 01:24:31,482
You're from everywhere.

1176
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:32,983
We're from everywhere.

1177
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,444
You're from everywhere.

1178
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,738
I'm from here.

1179
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:40,574
You're from here, man.

1180
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:41,742
That's so cool.

1181
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:45,370
I guess so.

1182
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,166
Man,
you're amazingly from here.

1183
01:24:54,714 --> 01:24:59,510
Here, man,
take a ride to here and now.

1184
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:02,262
Eight miles high.

1185
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:07,726
I'm actually
a little afraid of heights.

1186
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,857
What the heck.

1187
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,128
Hey.

1188
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,380
Come on in, sit.

1189
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:12,457
So...

1190
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:15,210
Yeah?

1191
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,338
You sure that was acid?

1192
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,090
I didn't really taste any...

1193
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,092
It just takes a while.

1194
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:26,763
Hey, let's listen to some
of our own sounds.

1195
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,561
What? What's that?

1196
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,606
Hey, it's okay.
Just breathe.

1197
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,983
Hey, it's okay,
just breathe.

1198
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:03,694
It's okay, just breathe.
Just breathe.

1199
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:28,010
Hey, it's okay.

1200
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:30,929
It's okay.

1201
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,910
Just breathe.

1202
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,672
Where are my arms?

1203
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:08,383
Where's my arm?
It's right here.

1204
01:29:21,939 --> 01:29:23,440
Just breathe.

1205
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:30,132
Hey. Let's go down to
the ocean. Let's go swim.

1206
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:25,121
Elliot. You look well.

1207
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,708
I want you to meet the ladies
from St. Paul's in Liberty.

1208
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,669
They made 5,000 sandwiches!

1209
01:32:30,753 --> 01:32:32,420
Vilma,
don't exaggerate.

1210
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:33,672
We made 4,000.

1211
01:32:33,756 --> 01:32:37,467
Honey, please. Anything more
than one is a miracle in my book.

1212
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:50,313
My God! Look at him! Where
have you been all day and night?

1213
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,524
How was the concert?

1214
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:57,988
Well, I met some friends
on the way there.

1215
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:02,450
It was great.
It was great.

1216
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,413
Are you hungry?

1217
01:33:06,497 --> 01:33:07,581
I'm starving.

1218
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:25,140
So I was thinking,
when this is over...

1219
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:26,516
What a mess.

1220
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:29,227
It'll take months
to clean up.

1221
01:33:31,022 --> 01:33:34,024
We can keep some of these
new people on, right?

1222
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:37,068
We can afford the help now.

1223
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,865
And with the place paid off,

1224
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,661
maybe it's time you thought
about some permanent staff.

1225
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:52,167
Some people to help run the
place, make some improvements.

1226
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:58,548
What are you talking about?
That's why we have you.

1227
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:07,474
I'm just saying. I was thinking when
this is over, with all the money now,

1228
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,976
I could take a trip. And where
did you get those pajamas?

1229
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,354
You're not going anywhere
dressed like that.

1230
01:34:21,572 --> 01:34:28,119
We've made brownies. Wonderful
brownies. Very special brownies. Elliot?

1231
01:34:29,246 --> 01:34:30,830
We'll take a pass.

1232
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:35,418
Right.

1233
01:34:43,427 --> 01:34:45,136
You see, Jake?
That's just like him.

1234
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:47,180
He doesn't want dessert, but
does he think to ask his mother?

1235
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:49,516
You know what?
That's enough.

1236
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:54,104
You know, I'm the only one here,
out of hundreds and hundreds

1237
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:58,858
and hundreds of thousands of people,
who's having breakfast with his parents!

1238
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,863
Do you think Janis Joplin's mom is
standing backstage telling her to tuck her,

1239
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,408
I don't know, her whiskey bottle
back into her pocket or something?

1240
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:09,327
Or Jimi Hendrix's mom is
telling him to wash his hair?

1241
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:12,580
I'm gonna lie down, then I'm going
to Max's and I'm gonna enjoy myself.

1242
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:15,875
And you know what? Go ahead. I'd
love to see you eat a brownie.

1243
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,752
You should have two!

1244
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:32,267
Elli!

1245
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,244
Hey, Elliot.
Hey.

1246
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:53,580
See you guys later.

1247
01:36:10,389 --> 01:36:11,514
Billy?

1248
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:17,604
Man,
I remember this hill.

1249
01:36:19,648 --> 01:36:23,193
Remember remember, or, like,
Vietnam flashback remember?

1250
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:27,197
Remember remember, man.

1251
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:35,872
Homecoming. Senior year. We
fucking massacred Monticello.

1252
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:42,253
I caught like three touchdown
passes. Rum and Cokes.

1253
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:48,134
And we fucking tipped
three of Yasgur's cows,

1254
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:51,846
man, right there,
at the top of that hill.

1255
01:36:54,558 --> 01:36:56,518
And Shirley Livingstone,

1256
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:01,397
man, right there,
at the top of that hill.

1257
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:04,275
Wait a second.
That was you?

1258
01:37:06,654 --> 01:37:07,695
Was.

1259
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:13,618
Is.

1260
01:37:16,872 --> 01:37:19,999
And that's
the Shirley Livingstone,

1261
01:37:20,084 --> 01:37:21,918
the one who works
at the animal hospital?

1262
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:27,340
Yeah.

1263
01:37:29,593 --> 01:37:31,386
We were engaged, man.

1264
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:40,687
Come on, man.
I love this fucking hill.

1265
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:20,018
Billy!

1266
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,299
I love this hill!

1267
01:38:51,383 --> 01:38:53,134
We love this hill!

1268
01:39:08,525 --> 01:39:10,985
The prodigal son returns.

1269
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:16,699
Well, you know,

1270
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:23,539
I didn't quite,
you know, go.

1271
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:27,043
I got it.

1272
01:39:29,171 --> 01:39:31,839
I'm happy to see you,
Elliot. Come on.

1273
01:39:33,258 --> 01:39:36,260
I want you to meet some
very, very groovy people.

1274
01:39:41,433 --> 01:39:43,768
You gave them
the hash brownies?

1275
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:46,396
They told me
you said I should.

1276
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:48,815
How many?

1277
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:49,983
Four each.

1278
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:03,162
Elliot! My baby!

1279
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:05,707
Her baby!

1280
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:14,298
My little baby. My filthy baby
boy. Give Mamma some of that dirt.

1281
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,178
Dad.

1282
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:30,977
She got up in her sleep,
walked over there and...

1283
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:32,979
What's with the money?

1284
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:35,565
We've been depositing everything
that's come in this week.

1285
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:37,859
Where did
all that come from?

1286
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:53,082
Ma, what the hell?

1287
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,251
Don't come near me,
you two.

1288
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:57,879
But what...
This is mine.

1289
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:00,756
It's my savings
for 20 years.

1290
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,968
It's my savings.

1291
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:09,265
Jesus,
how much you got there?

1292
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:12,101
None of your business.

1293
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:25,990
$97,000.

1294
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:28,868
Dad, did you know
about this?

1295
01:43:28,952 --> 01:43:30,703
You think she'd tell me?

1296
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:40,796
You'd have let
the bank foreclose?

1297
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:45,426
Let me put all my earnings
into this place.

1298
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:48,971
And you...

1299
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:54,227
Elli.

1300
01:43:56,313 --> 01:44:00,691
Why does it matter?
We're rich now.

1301
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,139
Elli, I was scared.

1302
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:39,855
Mom.

1303
01:44:45,028 --> 01:44:47,697
I've got to fix your father his lunch.

1304
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:03,713
Hey, man. What do you
think of the kids here?

1305
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:08,050
I think it's great. I got one here
myself and I got one in Vietnam,

1306
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,553
and I wish he were
here in the mud.

1307
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:24,233
Hey, Elliot.
What?

1308
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:27,278
Just come around.
Stay on the wood.

1309
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:38,039
Yeah,
everything's electric now.

1310
01:45:42,919 --> 01:45:44,545
What are you up to?

1311
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:47,214
Thought I'd try to see
the concert finally.

1312
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:53,804
Maybe later. They can't get
anyone to play right now.

1313
01:45:53,889 --> 01:45:55,723
There's too many shocks.

1314
01:45:55,807 --> 01:45:56,849
That's a bummer.

1315
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:02,104
How's your day going?

1316
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,486
Yeah.

1317
01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:13,866
No, no.
My family, you know...

1318
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:14,992
Sorry.

1319
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:19,455
It's trivial compared to what
you guys are going through.

1320
01:46:21,291 --> 01:46:25,461
Maybe it's the most important thing
happening in the whole universe.

1321
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:27,421
How do you know?

1322
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:31,050
I'm pretty sure it's trivial,
you know, in perspective.

1323
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:35,930
Perspective is what
shuts out the universe.

1324
01:46:37,099 --> 01:46:39,975
Everyone with their
little perspective.

1325
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:43,270
It keeps the love out.

1326
01:46:47,692 --> 01:46:53,906
I'm so tired. I'm starting to talk
like that swami what's-his-face.

1327
01:46:56,034 --> 01:46:57,284
Far out.

1328
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:05,042
Anyway, I'll see you.

1329
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:46,959
Yes?

1330
01:47:56,386 --> 01:47:57,720
Come on in.

1331
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,645
You're up early.

1332
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,690
I couldn't sleep.

1333
01:48:12,068 --> 01:48:13,360
Hey, Dad.

1334
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:19,450
I was gonna come say
goodbye. I hope that's okay.

1335
01:48:22,662 --> 01:48:23,787
Listen.

1336
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:27,583
Sit.

1337
01:48:44,893 --> 01:48:47,186
A month ago,
I was a dying man.

1338
01:48:50,815 --> 01:48:55,027
I would think to myself, "It's
nice of Elli to come back here

1339
01:48:55,111 --> 01:48:57,238
"to tend to a dying man. "

1340
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:02,284
Who knows?
Maybe tomorrow I'll be dead.

1341
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:06,247
But now,

1342
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:10,751
I'm alive.

1343
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:15,130
You understand?

1344
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:19,218
No.

1345
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:28,102
It's because of you.
Because of you I'm alive.

1346
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:35,150
And what should I want now, but
for you, my son, to live, too?

1347
01:49:38,822 --> 01:49:40,864
That's not so much to ask.

1348
01:49:43,868 --> 01:49:45,995
No, it isn't.

1349
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:53,085
They're all starting to
leave, the young people.

1350
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:59,550
Who knows where?
They don't even know.

1351
01:50:01,469 --> 01:50:05,431
And now you're one of them.
You go.

1352
01:50:09,394 --> 01:50:14,106
I'll stay in touch.
I'll be back.

1353
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:19,945
Yeah, sure you will.

1354
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:26,076
Elliot.

1355
01:50:27,537 --> 01:50:29,246
My hip, my...

1356
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:45,179
Elli, that business
with your mother...

1357
01:50:45,263 --> 01:50:47,264
Don't worry about it.

1358
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:49,558
No.

1359
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:53,812
Dad, can you just
tell me one thing?

1360
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:55,981
What?

1361
01:50:56,066 --> 01:50:57,066
How have you done it?

1362
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:01,904
I mean, how have you lived
with her more than 40 years?

1363
01:51:05,283 --> 01:51:06,659
I love her.

1364
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:16,478
Hey, Mike.
Elli, you made it.

1365
01:52:16,855 --> 01:52:20,733
Yeah, finally.
It's amazing.

1366
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:23,694
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1367
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:36,665
Hey, thanks for calling and welcoming
us to your international resort, man.

1368
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:40,377
The whole world came, and now
everyone's pulling together.

1369
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,007
Yeah. It's all just like
you said, Mike, isn't it?

1370
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:51,138
Yeah, three days
of peace and music.

1371
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:56,852
So what happens now?

1372
01:52:58,521 --> 01:52:59,938
Man, who knows?

1373
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,859
Everybody's gotta chase
the money now, right?

1374
01:53:03,943 --> 01:53:04,943
Yeah.

1375
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:08,614
We're all probably gonna sue
each other, but that's cool.

1376
01:53:09,574 --> 01:53:11,366
We'll figure it out.

1377
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:15,329
What about you?

1378
01:53:15,997 --> 01:53:19,708
I don't know.
I put all my stuff in my car.

1379
01:53:20,835 --> 01:53:24,171
Hey, that's a sign.

1380
01:53:31,596 --> 01:53:35,474
If your car moves, come look me
up. I'm going to San Francisco.

1381
01:53:35,558 --> 01:53:37,142
Me and Chip
and some of the guys,

1382
01:53:37,227 --> 01:53:40,270
we're gonna help out
with a truly free concert.

1383
01:53:40,563 --> 01:53:42,898
It's gonna be even more
beautiful than this one.

1384
01:53:42,982 --> 01:53:44,483
Wow.
Yeah.

1385
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:48,153
The Rolling Stones.

1386
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:49,238
Rolling Stones?

1387
01:53:49,989 --> 01:53:52,491
Yeah, Stones.

1388
01:53:56,037 --> 01:53:57,412
Beautiful.

1389
01:54:05,922 --> 01:54:12,177
Beautiful.
