"CITY OF MEN"

DEAD END HILL
RIO DE JANEIRO

3
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:04,004
Shit, Fasto.
It's fucking hot today.

4
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:06,339
Hot, my ass.
A gangsta never feels the heat.

5
00:03:06,915 --> 00:03:08,610
- Sure is hot, man.
- Hot as hell.

6
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:11,944
- Fucking sun...
- It's damn hot.

7
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:21,617
Beach time!

8
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:25,165
- You crazy?
- Down to the beach, man.

9
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:27,230
That's asking for trouble, brother.

10
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,266
I'm putting on my suit, dude.

11
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,734
- You serious, Midnight?
- You bet, Tina.

12
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,500
Use the hose, bro.
I'll even hold it for you.

13
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,269
What's that, Fasto?
You'll hold my hose?

14
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,912
Hey, man,
he wants to hold my hose!

15
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:41,945
Fuck off!

16
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:46,316
Come on, let's go to the beach.

17
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:51,148
You wanna go for a swim?
Okay, buddy.

18
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:53,459
That's why I like you, bro.

19
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:57,153
Tina, go get the walkie-talkies
and guns in the shack.

20
00:03:57,899 --> 00:04:00,527
Bette, tell the cops
we're coming through.

21
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:03,898
You wanna swim?
You got it, bro!

22
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,999
Hey, Wallace!

23
00:04:56,124 --> 00:04:57,216
Ace!

24
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,720
Wake up, honey!

25
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:06,422
I gotta go to work.
Look after Clayton, okay?

26
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:09,964
I'll be back tonight.
Bye! Love you...

27
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:25,049
- Hey, Ace! What's up?
- Hey, how's it going?

28
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:26,982
Remember what today is?
The 3rd!

29
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,323
- Look over there!
- Where are they going?

30
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:33,323
- Let's go see.
- I can't, man. I got Clayton.

31
00:05:33,528 --> 00:05:35,155
Well, later!

32
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,338
Come on!

33
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:48,770
Wallace! Wait!

34
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,652
- Bikinis and nice asses...
- Yeah...

35
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,650
Bikinis and asses!

36
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,894
Bet you can't pick one up...

37
00:06:08,096 --> 00:06:09,427
Look at her, son...

38
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,190
Your sister Tina's gotten so thin.

39
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:35,485
Down to beach!

40
00:06:36,457 --> 00:06:39,483
So, Midnight, what about those
soccer shirts for the boys?

41
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:42,424
We'll talk about it later.
Okay, coach?

42
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,465
You stand guard here.
And you, over there.

43
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:50,395
I'll call you when we're
ready to come back up.

44
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:06,884
- I'm in for a dive.
- The sun feels great, Midnight!

45
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:08,578
I'd prefer a private beach.

46
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:11,553
- Private!
- Sure, just order one on the hill!

47
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,388
You're asking for it!
You'd have to take care of it for me.

48
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:20,033
Carry all the sand up...

49
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,800
Come with daddy...

50
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:27,998
- It sure is hot.
- Tell me about it!

51
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:32,909
All these guards just so your cousin
can go swimming!

52
00:07:33,114 --> 00:07:36,106
Midnight hasn't left the hill
in 3 years.

53
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,612
So what's the set up, Fasto?

54
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,584
- Two up there...
- Two up there!

55
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,758
- One at the kiosk.
- One at the kiosk there!

56
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,086
Two others behind us.

57
00:07:47,295 --> 00:07:48,956
- The kid, by the road.
- Eyes peeled!

58
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:50,687
Do your job, guys!

59
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:53,423
Midnight, check out
that Japanese babe!

60
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:55,625
- And the dark-haired chick!
- I like her!

61
00:07:55,836 --> 00:07:58,771
Too bad, me too.

62
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,565
Shit, you want them all!

63
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,733
Okay, I'll take
the Japanese one.

64
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:05,037
That's cool, bro.

65
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:08,079
- Hold this...
- Hey, I wanna go in too.

66
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:11,183
- I need you to watch these.
- Come on, man.

67
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:13,114
Watch them.

68
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:39,709
- Hey, Wallace.
- What's up?

69
00:08:39,914 --> 00:08:43,247
- How are things?
- Cool, man.

70
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:46,815
Look, Ace. Fasto even put
a soldier up on the rock.

71
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:50,583
Wow, I really dig that Camila.
She sure is cute.

72
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,053
Wallace, listen to me.

73
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,354
Forget about her.
Fiel never lets her out of his sight.

74
00:08:55,563 --> 00:09:00,262
So watch out,
she could mean trouble.

75
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:02,936
- I'll find a way.
- Really?

76
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:04,995
Where's Clayton?

77
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:09,502
- Let's go swim!
- Let's go in, Wallace.

78
00:09:10,244 --> 00:09:12,303
- See you, Wallace.
- See you.

79
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,045
Tina, watch this for me.

80
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:16,841
You're my shadow now?

81
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,900
It's good to be Midnight!

82
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,726
I'm pissed off, Fiel.

83
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:38,899
That Midnight is a real asshole.

84
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,269
- Keep cool.
- A real asshole. How you doing, bro?

85
00:09:42,476 --> 00:09:46,344
Look at this, I stole it.
It's cool, man. Listen...

86
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:49,015
- What is it, a radio?
- MP3, dude.

87
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,721
Yesterday was the 2nd, wasn't it?

88
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,550
- Yeah.
- Day of the Dead.

89
00:09:57,758 --> 00:10:00,090
So today's the 3rd.

90
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:03,223
- That's clever, Ace.
- It's the 3rd, man!

91
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:08,793
- Right! Happy birthday!
- My birthday!

92
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:10,994
Happy birthday to you...

93
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:15,039
Hey, wait! That means
my birthday's next month!

94
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:16,903
Put it here!

95
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:20,342
- Damn! 18 years old!
- Yeah, both of us!

96
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:25,976
Ever notice that rich kids,
at 18, they get to drive.

97
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
And poor kids?
They get to go to work.

98
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,686
That sucks.

99
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,792
I'm 18 and I've only screwed
one girl in my life.

100
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:36,588
And on top of that, it's my wife!
Jesus, man...

101
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:41,095
And Cristiane got pregnant
the first time.

102
00:10:42,002 --> 00:10:43,799
Just my luck.

103
00:10:44,105 --> 00:10:47,268
Hey, Caju!
Watch the kid!

104
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:52,137
I'll be 18 and I don't even know
who my father is.

105
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:58,241
Even worse, it'll be marked on
my ID forever "father unknown".

106
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:00,352
Forget that business
about your father.

107
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:03,819
Look at me.
I forgot mine ages ago.

108
00:11:04,024 --> 00:11:06,993
I can't, Ace. I just can't.

109
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:08,454
Let's go chill in the water.

110
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,857
Come on...

111
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:16,462
Hey, got any Proibid? O CDs?

112
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:19,399
- Yeah, good stuff.
- What about Pagode music?

113
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:22,405
- Sure, I got... I got everything.
- Shit!

114
00:11:23,477 --> 00:11:24,944
- That guy!
- What?

115
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:27,979
I think he's my father.
But I'm not sure.

116
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:30,777
Yeah, the spitting image!

117
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:33,043
- He's not sure either.
- Go on...

118
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:35,654
Only my mother knows
for sure, I think.

119
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:39,519
- For sure? Go talk to him!
- No way! You kidding?

120
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,560
- You sure look alike!
- Stop it!

121
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:50,103
Hey, mister!

122
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:53,805
Hey, kid! Come here!

123
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:59,579
- How are you, Wallace?
- Hi!

124
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,542
- How's your mom?
- Okay, I guess.

125
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,643
- How's school?
- Great, they're on strike.

126
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,113
On strike, that's great?

127
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,082
- Something I can do, Wallace?
- No.

128
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,697
- Ace?
- What?

129
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,266
- I have an idea.
- What?

130
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,597
An idea, man!
C'mon, let's go!

131
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,267
- Just say it's for the papers.
- What papers?

132
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:29,909
The ID papers.

133
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,305
- What's this about?
- You'll see.

134
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:56,229
You know his name, grandma!
Tell me!

135
00:12:56,437 --> 00:13:00,203
He never even showed up
when you were born.

136
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:03,809
He went to play soccer,
your mother was in pain.

137
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:08,471
I asked Pedreira to go get him,
but he hasn't shown up since.

138
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,450
So what, grandma?
Just tell me, please.

139
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:16,089
Dona Elvira,
he just needs the name for his ID.

140
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,288
- Wasn't he a waiter?
- Shut up, woman!

141
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,427
My dad was a waiter?

142
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:24,788
Your father was a bum.
He didn't work, he slept all day.

143
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:29,902
What use is a father who doesn't
care if his son is dead or alive?

144
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:32,163
Oh, shit! Clayton!

145
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,051
Let's go see who's there.

146
00:13:53,427 --> 00:13:54,917
Uncle Fasto...

147
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,065
Hey, Fasto! It's time to go.
Game's over.

148
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:02,099
- Quit playing, Fasto. Here...
- What's up with that, Midnight?

149
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,368
Watch the kid.
There's your Uncle Fasto.

150
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,337
- Where's Ace?
- Watch the kid.

151
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:10,200
It's Ace's son.

152
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:14,146
Now he's yours, you take him!

153
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:17,012
- He looks just like you, man!
- The boy is ours, now.

154
00:14:17,217 --> 00:14:21,119
- We'll return him in the hill.
- Okay, we're outta here, then.

155
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:47,511
Where's the kid?

156
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,412
Nothing, man!

157
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:54,877
I left him with Caju!
Let's go!

158
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:57,485
Caju, where's Clayton?

159
00:14:58,225 --> 00:15:00,284
- How would I know?
- He was with you.

160
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:03,952
- With me? Are you kidding?
- You're such a prick!

161
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:05,153
Prick!

162
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:11,102
Airplane, airplane!

163
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:12,772
A header!

164
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:15,366
Pass the ball to the boy.

165
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,711
- Have you seen Clayton?
- A little black kid.

166
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:22,074
Kick it! Kick it!

167
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,316
A little back kid.
He's my son.

168
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:27,686
Kick it!

169
00:15:33,594 --> 00:15:35,357
Give him to me...

170
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:40,328
Get back in the game!
Back in the game!

171
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:54,236
Remember, Goiano?
Great team, weren't they?

172
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:55,142
Sure...

173
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:58,250
- An all-star team.
- Sure, Pedreira...

174
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,317
Too bad you never let me play.

175
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:03,786
Why ask me for money?
Ask the guys who played.

176
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:06,753
Shirts for the boys,
won't ruin you, will it?

177
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,690
- What is this?
- Give him to his mother.

178
00:16:10,364 --> 00:16:12,389
- What happened?
- We'll talk later.

179
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,759
We're not done!

180
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,134
What's wrong, Clayton?
What have they done to you?

181
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:19,202
Where's your father?

182
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:24,377
- Have you seen Clayton?
- In there.

183
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:26,045
In there?

184
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:30,409
My son...
Where were you?

185
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:32,082
- Where was he?
- How would I know?

186
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,914
You're the father.
That's a good one!

187
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:37,317
It's okay...

188
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,983
It's over now.

189
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:43,721
Shall we go home?

190
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,023
- Want to go home?
- Yes.

191
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:49,794
- Let's go then. Don't cry.
- Mommy! Mommy!

192
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:52,130
- Here's mommy.
- Son!

193
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:54,204
What happened, sweetie?

194
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:57,343
- It was awful...
- At least you know that much!

195
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,774
I didn't mean to...

196
00:17:05,786 --> 00:17:07,720
Have you decided about Cristiane?

197
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,411
I think...

198
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,890
I don't want to have the kid.

199
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:15,357
But the money I scraped together
won't get us into a clinic.

200
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:20,329
So what are you going to do?

201
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,525
I don't know, man.
I'm too young to be a father.

202
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:29,039
I'll stop seeing Cristiane
for a while.

203
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:32,875
And let her
bring the kid up alone?

204
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:37,710
Let the kid grow up
without a father?

205
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,788
What use is a father anyway?

206
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,252
I wish I had a father...

207
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,689
to teach me how to do things...

208
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,661
to take me to school.

209
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:09,980
So your son will be like us,
without a father?

210
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:14,187
Having to get by on his own?

211
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:17,416
Always getting into trouble?

212
00:18:30,137 --> 00:18:31,695
So how's my nephew?

213
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:35,369
In '87, I'd given up playing.
I was the coach.

214
00:18:35,576 --> 00:18:39,444
- Who are the other guys?
- They were all on the team.

215
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:41,942
Did you know my father?

216
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:43,810
No, I didn't.

217
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:47,885
Wasn't he one of them?

218
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:51,421
Most of those guys are
either dead or have left the hill.

219
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:55,254
My grandma said when I was born
she told you to get my dad.

220
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:58,260
She must be going senile.
Your dad's not there.

221
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:02,233
- Were any of them waiters?
- I don't know.

222
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:07,063
I got an idea...

223
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:10,573
Goiano, you pay for Tiquinho's
shirt, he's the star player.

224
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,677
Then I'll go hit up the others.

225
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,939
- It's just $ 10 for one shirt.
- $ 15.

226
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:17,343
- 10 or 15?
- 15.

227
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:20,145
- Who are these guys?
- I don't remember this guy.

228
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:22,288
This is Helinho.

229
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:24,980
That was my brother, Edson.

230
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,183
Helinho, were any of them waiters?

231
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:29,419
Waiters?
I don't think so.

232
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,258
- Is that you, Zeze?
- No, I'm not bowlegged.

233
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:36,232
- Was anyone a waiter?
- A waiter? No...

234
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,734
- Wait! Heraldo was a waiter.
- Heraldo?

235
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:43,035
- He joined the team later.
- He was a waiter and on the team?

236
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:46,245
Hey, Ace!

237
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,038
- Well?
- Well what?

238
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:49,476
- Tell me...
- No way...

239
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:51,947
- C'mon, man!
- I'll think about it.

240
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,552
- You have to pay.
- Like hell!

241
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:57,724
Okay, take it easy.
Your father's name is Heraldo, bro.

242
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,893
- Heraldo?
- Heraldo.

243
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,424
Heraldo.

244
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:04,756
He plays over at
Aterro do Flamengo.

245
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:06,660
It's a team of waiters.

246
00:20:07,901 --> 00:20:09,027
Heraldo...

247
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:11,960
Now, now!

248
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:14,474
Get it, get it!

249
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,574
- Shoot!
- A goal kick!

250
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:19,211
Fullback or forward?

251
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:23,643
Who, your dad? Probably the goalie,
if he plays like you.

252
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:28,054
Look, that must be him!
You guys have the same style.

253
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:31,190
It's hereditary,
you'll have the same potbelly!

254
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:33,553
A huge one!

255
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,758
Game's over, let's go see.

256
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:39,631
See you all next week! Thanks!

257
00:20:43,236 --> 00:20:44,362
Are you Heraldo?

258
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:46,061
No, I'm Bira.

259
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:48,070
- What's your name?
- Vadinho.

260
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:51,343
- Do you know anyone named Heraldo?
- No.

261
00:20:51,878 --> 00:20:53,436
- Do you know Heraldo?
- Geraldo?

262
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:56,912
- I know many Geraldos. Which one?
- No, Heraldo, the waiter.

263
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:58,345
Don't know him.

264
00:20:58,552 --> 00:21:01,214
- Do you know anyone named Heraldo?
- Heraldo?

265
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:04,416
- Heraldo Coutinho?
- No, Heraldo, waiter.

266
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:06,888
Exactly.
What do you want with him?

267
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,756
Wallace's father is a friend of his.

268
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:12,955
He wants to be a waiter,
so he thought Heraldo could help.

269
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,464
Your dad hasn't seen him
in a while, has he?

270
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:16,658
It's been a while.

271
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,397
If Heraldo gets him any job,
it'll be at the prison cafeteria.

272
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:24,004
He's in jail for what happened
at the Fiery Bull.

273
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:27,112
- The Fiery Bull?
- The famous steakhouse. Remember?

274
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:31,182
He got 20 years.
Last I heard, he was in Frei Caneca.

275
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,780
Sorry about that.

276
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:36,317
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

277
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,418
Let's forget it.

278
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:42,356
What? You wait 18 for this
and now you chicken out?

279
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:45,258
Yeah, but I didn't think
I'd find him here.

280
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,325
What if he's dead?

281
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:50,431
Don't talk like that!
Come on.

282
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,628
He walked out of here
7 months ago.

283
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,898
- He's on parole.
- What'd he do?

284
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:57,906
- What?
- What was his crime?

285
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:00,011
- Who are you?
- His son.

286
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:07,652
Hello? Hi.

287
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:10,487
Yes, okay.

288
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:22,201
Heraldo Coutinho got 20 years
for manslaughter. He did 15.

289
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:24,996
Manslaughter? Robbery?

290
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,570
Yes, and murder.

291
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,402
He was a killer and a thief.

292
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,201
Let's go.

293
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:33,445
Cheer up.

294
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:36,407
You got his picture now...

295
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:58,798
- How are you?
- How are you?

296
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:02,033
Let's sit.

297
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:05,076
Hi, Fiel.

298
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:09,440
What's the matter?

299
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,750
It's too complicated.

300
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:13,743
Go on...

301
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:21,088
- Do you have a father?
- No.

302
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:23,356
Nor a mother.

303
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,767
- Wanna listen?
- Sure.

304
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:06,596
- Who was that bitch, Midnight?
- Some chick... What an ass...

305
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,202
Get him, Fasto!

306
00:24:10,644 --> 00:24:13,112
And in broad daylight.

307
00:24:14,748 --> 00:24:17,911
You mug someone, Fiel,
and then bring the cops here?

308
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:20,916
- You fucked up, man.
- You ass, you wanna die?

309
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:23,850
Well, Fiel?

310
00:24:27,627 --> 00:24:30,425
Don't make a sound.
Your MP and your purse.

311
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,461
Quick!
Give them to me!

312
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,531
Hands on the car.

313
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,701
- Let's talk.
- Talk about what?

314
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:40,134
I can get you money
up on Dead End Hill.

315
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,638
- Please, man. I swear...
- We'll see!

316
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:45,304
You fucked up big time!

317
00:24:46,012 --> 00:24:49,209
Come on, Midnight, please.
All they want is money.

318
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,413
Who's paying the cops?

319
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:58,683
Please, Midnight. Just give them
the money, brother.

320
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:00,223
Listen...

321
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,987
Some people learn the first time,
some the second time.

322
00:25:04,197 --> 00:25:06,392
And some never learn, dude.

323
00:25:06,866 --> 00:25:08,663
You never learn, Fiel!

324
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:12,933
- Dammit!
- Please, Midnight! Don't kill me, bro!

325
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,538
Let's get going, Fiel.
Get up!

326
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:17,232
Please, Fasto!
Please don't kill me!

327
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:19,935
Get up.
You're gonna die.

328
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:24,246
Stupid ass!

329
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,191
One more, Ceara.

330
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,798
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

331
00:25:46,172 --> 00:25:48,436
- One less.
- One less.

332
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:49,768
- Hey, Ace.
- Hey!

333
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:51,273
- Hi, Ceara.
- Hi, Fininho.

334
00:25:51,478 --> 00:25:53,912
- They killed Fiel.
- Fiel?

335
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:57,411
- What'd he do?
- I don't know, man.

336
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:00,476
Why Fiel, of all people?

337
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:03,514
See this CD player?

338
00:26:04,257 --> 00:26:05,884
He sold it to me...

339
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:08,057
for cheap, really cheap.

340
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:10,759
Things are getting crazy.

341
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,259
Life goes on, bro.

342
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:31,413
What's the matter?

343
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,813
Your cousin had my brother killed.

344
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,250
They threw his body
into the quarry.

345
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:42,421
Did you see?

346
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:50,260
I want to bury him.

347
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:54,105
I'll help you.

348
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:57,534
He was all I had.

349
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:23,232
Fiel's not here, Camila.

350
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:41,348
Want to wait out the rain
in the guardhouse?

351
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:43,249
- I don't think so.
- Come on, it's starting to pour.

352
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:45,219
It'll be okay.

353
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:25,387
Come here! Quick!

354
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:29,959
I'm ready now.

355
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:09,964
Ace...
He shouldn't have seen me.

356
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:20,181
Don't let up!

357
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:23,717
Come on, Fasto!

358
00:29:27,227 --> 00:29:29,092
You guys are shit!

359
00:29:29,662 --> 00:29:31,994
- Goal!
- Shit!

360
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:40,571
Shut up for a second...

361
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:44,072
Hey, Fasto.
That punk Ace saw me.

362
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:47,902
- It wasn't my fault.
- Okay, all right. Okay...

363
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:50,079
- Let's play!
- Who was that?

364
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:53,015
- Some playboy from the beach.
- What'd he want?

365
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:54,709
What'd he want?
The usual.

366
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:57,419
You doing home delivery now?

367
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,949
- You keeping tabs on me?
- Nobody's keeping tabs.

368
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,991
I told him to fuck off.
Let's play.

369
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:06,063
Who gave that playboy
your number?

370
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:11,770
Vasco, the guy's hurting, man.

371
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:15,202
Yeah, Midnight.
He's really hooked, can't get enough.

372
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:17,239
- Vasco, like the team?
- Yeah.

373
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:19,274
Then take this!
Flamengo scores!

374
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:22,643
Fuck!

375
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:26,148
Way to go! Fuck Vasco!

376
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:28,513
Flamengo is the bomb!

377
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:33,521
SMOKE HILL

378
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:56,479
Fasto!
What's up, boss?

379
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:58,674
This is Breque.
His hood is cool.

380
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:02,514
We appreciate your help, buddy.

381
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:07,021
This is the plan to return to
Dead End Hill and kill Midnight.

382
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:10,387
You can count on me,
and my weapons.

383
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:12,758
I'll back you up.

384
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,700
- What the hell?
- How's it going?

385
00:31:25,912 --> 00:31:30,246
- Man, I think I saw Fiel.
- Shit, Ace! Alive?

386
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,281
Yes.
I'm being punished by God.

387
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:36,182
- Does Fiel know you saw him?
- I think so.

388
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,717
Are you going to see your dad
at the parole office?

389
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:43,418
- I don't know.
- Lf you go, let me know.

390
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,724
- Sure.
- About Fiel...

391
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,423
...lips sealed, okay?
- Of course.

392
00:31:48,635 --> 00:31:50,694
- It's serious.
- I know.

393
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:53,734
- You free?
- Yeah.

394
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:56,468
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- You free or not?

395
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:58,143
No, sorry.

396
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:03,715
Now, "d" equals "m" over "v"...

397
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:06,045
Camila!

398
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,210
Excuse me, teacher.

399
00:32:09,355 --> 00:32:12,552
- What are you doing here?
- Your brother's alive.

400
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,454
- What?
- Your brother's alive.

401
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:18,290
- Don't joke about this.
- I'm not joking.

402
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:22,567
I want to see him.
Where is he? How do you know?

403
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,168
Ace saw him.

404
00:32:32,178 --> 00:32:35,045
Camila, I couldn't tell you I was alive,
it was too dangerous.

405
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:38,873
We're waiting here to go in
and retake Dead End Hill.

406
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,950
So stay alert, girl.

407
00:32:41,354 --> 00:32:45,848
Stay home and lay low.

408
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:49,085
You know how these things work.

409
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:52,329
Hang up, man! You gonna
talk to your chick all day?

410
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:53,794
Talk to you later...

411
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,934
Fasto, it's getting outta control.

412
00:32:56,135 --> 00:32:58,569
Even my sister is onto things.

413
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:01,934
That punk Ace has been
shooting his mouth off.

414
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:04,701
Midnight's no fool, man.

415
00:33:05,078 --> 00:33:06,511
You know what?

416
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:08,977
Ace is a fucking moron.

417
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,316
But don't worry, bro...

418
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:13,212
Oh, Cris!

419
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,984
When we go in,
he'll be the first to die.

420
00:33:16,456 --> 00:33:18,947
- It's so good, I'm gonna die, Ace.
- No you're not...

421
00:33:19,158 --> 00:33:21,388
- Go on, Cris.
- Don't stop...

422
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:25,363
Oh, Ace...

423
00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:28,133
Yeah, keep going.
Keep moving that way...

424
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:49,555
Wow, Ace!

425
00:33:49,756 --> 00:33:52,520
- Did you like it?
- Where'd you learn to do that?

426
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:55,353
I don't learn, I invent.

427
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:24,653
- It was like you were someone else.
- Why? You been with someone else?

428
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,950
No, and you?

429
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,628
Me? I'd rather die.

430
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,229
Never in my life...

431
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:35,194
Want a smoothie?

432
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:44,400
Hey, baby...

433
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,674
Where's the blender?

434
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:49,307
- I sold it.
- You sold it?

435
00:34:49,515 --> 00:34:52,882
- I needed some money.
- What for?

436
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:55,713
Praise Jesus! Hallelujah!

437
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:59,517
If you give from the heart, you'll
receive a thousand times more!

438
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,556
I asked God for something
and had to make an offering.

439
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:05,219
- A $ 30 offering.
- What did you ask?

440
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:08,332
Cris, remember the job in S? O Paulo?

441
00:35:08,601 --> 00:35:12,093
I think I'll take it,
but only if you come with me.

442
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:15,466
- What about my son?
- Cris, in one year...

443
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:18,235
you can make 30 grand!

444
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:19,741
$ 30, OOO?

445
00:35:19,946 --> 00:35:22,278
Trust in the Lord!
He will provide...

446
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:25,177
30, OOO, Lord.
But 30, OOO here in Rio...

447
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:29,912
with my son and my husband, Lord.
Is that too much to ask?

448
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:32,716
- For a job.
- What job?

449
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:37,095
I think I might go
to S? O Paulo for a year.

450
00:35:37,296 --> 00:35:39,093
Are you kidding?

451
00:35:39,432 --> 00:35:41,730
When I come back,
we can buy our house.

452
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:44,732
And you'll leave me with Clayton?

453
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:47,272
You're the father, Ace.

454
00:36:03,022 --> 00:36:05,820
Cristiane...

455
00:36:06,158 --> 00:36:08,149
Hush!

456
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:10,957
Are you the father?

457
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:14,225
Yes.

458
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,867
- Want to hold your son?
- No, thanks, ma'am.

459
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:18,536
- Go on...
- No, please...

460
00:36:18,738 --> 00:36:21,536
Here, hold your son.

461
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,949
Are you afraid?

462
00:37:03,816 --> 00:37:06,410
Did I tell you?
Cris wants to go to S? O Paulo.

463
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:10,214
It's always about her and Clayton.
But what about me?

464
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:15,156
- Nobody's ever looked after me.
- Well, thanks a lot, buddy!

465
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:17,591
It's true, you've lent me a hand.

466
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:19,264
More than just a hand!

467
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:22,730
Yeah, but what I mean is,
I'm always looking after Clayton.

468
00:37:23,069 --> 00:37:24,764
When will I ever get a break?

469
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:27,371
Better hurry,
we got that parole thing...

470
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:29,700
I gotta look after you too?

471
00:37:29,909 --> 00:37:30,898
DEAD END MARKET

472
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:36,575
- There's Grandpa. Go to auntie.
- What are you up to?

473
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:40,411
Wallace is turning 18 and
he needs to get his ID card.

474
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,018
And you?

475
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:44,655
Well, I have to go
because of the line.

476
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:47,519
- Go where?
- To the ID place.

477
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:52,027
That way, one stands in line
while the other pays the fee.

478
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,325
You only have to watch him
till the daycare opens.

479
00:37:55,534 --> 00:37:57,468
Once your son grows up...

480
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,605
we won't have to swallow
your lies anymore.

481
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:36,070
Are you Heraldo?

482
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:40,068
- Why?
- This is Wallace.

483
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,746
He's your son.

484
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,683
You're Wallace?

485
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:58,754
- Who are you?
- I'm Ace. Luis Claudio, Jr.

486
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:02,124
- You look just like your dad.
- What?

487
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:04,495
The next ten!

488
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:06,602
Can I wait for you here?

489
00:39:08,908 --> 00:39:10,933
Can't you see where I am?

490
00:39:12,044 --> 00:39:16,811
No way, kid. I have nothing
to give you, nothing to offer.

491
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:30,996
- Who'll use this one?
- They're coming.

492
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:33,188
- Undo the safety...
- Hey, Midnight.

493
00:39:33,399 --> 00:39:35,458
You know how?
You take this one.

494
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:38,831
- Cool.
- Use this gun...

495
00:39:39,438 --> 00:39:42,339
We're gonna kill Fasto.
Got that?

496
00:39:43,943 --> 00:39:46,309
What can the kids do?
Little man, come here.

497
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:49,413
Show the kids the fireworks,
they can keep watch.

498
00:39:49,615 --> 00:39:51,606
- Okay.
- Good, thanks, bro.

499
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:53,842
We're a good team.

500
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:55,213
Where's the other rifle?

501
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:58,356
- Let's give it to him.
- To him?

502
00:39:58,557 --> 00:40:01,720
- Right, not a rifle, not for him.
- No way.

503
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:03,827
Okay, give him a pistol.

504
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:07,562
Point it down.
It's to kill Fasto. Know him?

505
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:10,132
- That fucker?
- Exactly. You kill him.

506
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:13,237
Midnight, he's not ready for that.

507
00:40:13,439 --> 00:40:14,906
Because he's your brother?

508
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:16,802
Is that why he's not ready?

509
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:19,534
Sure he is, Tina!

510
00:40:19,745 --> 00:40:22,043
Cut it out, Tina.

511
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:26,014
- Why are you doing this, Midnight?
- Doing what, Tina?

512
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:28,142
You're sure to get killed.

513
00:40:28,587 --> 00:40:30,452
He's with the dealers now, Ace.

514
00:40:30,656 --> 00:40:33,557
- What's up with you?
- I wanna fight for our hill.

515
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:36,726
- You're a dope.
- Giving guns to 15-year-olds.

516
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,123
Can you believe it?

517
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,323
Stay out of it. They'll just
use you and throw you out.

518
00:40:42,535 --> 00:40:44,935
- Oh yeah?
- Think about your dad.

519
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:48,504
I'm gonna fight, Ace.
The hill is fucking ours!

520
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:50,773
What an ass...

521
00:40:51,644 --> 00:40:53,168
This little bitch is Fiel's sister.

522
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:56,274
And that weasel is in cahoots
with Fasto.

523
00:40:56,815 --> 00:40:59,045
You little punk-ass!

524
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,378
You shouldn't mess with gangsters.

525
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,612
Cut off her hair, quick!

526
00:41:03,822 --> 00:41:06,791
You crying, little girl?
I'm gonna cut this one...

527
00:41:06,992 --> 00:41:08,823
Here.

528
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:12,329
Cut it.
This is a tough one!

529
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:15,125
- Where'd you get hair like this?
- Done!

530
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:16,961
What's a weasel's sister
called, Tina?

531
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:19,865
- A weaselet.
- Gotta pay.

532
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:26,474
That's my sister in the cab.

533
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,705
At least they didn't kill her.

534
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:38,315
At least they didn't kill you.
We'll be back home soon.

535
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,586
- How much, bro?
- 25.

536
00:41:43,562 --> 00:41:45,894
Here's 30, give me back 5.

537
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:53,267
WEASEL

538
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,524
He's on parole, ma'am.

539
00:42:13,726 --> 00:42:16,058
He'd be so happy
to see his grandson.

540
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,225
I know, he's been in jail
for over 15 years.

541
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:21,695
He doesn't know
about his grandson.

542
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:23,765
Okay.

543
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,860
- Dad!
- What?

544
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,573
Come here.

545
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,942
And then the chick said
he couldn't get it up...

546
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:44,879
Wait here...

547
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:49,127
Hey, Wallace, how you doing?
Happy birthday, buddy!

548
00:42:49,328 --> 00:42:51,888
You crazy?
It's in two weeks.

549
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:54,065
Really?
Here's a present anyway.

550
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:55,528
What is it?

551
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:58,828
- Your father's address.
- How'd you get it?

552
00:42:59,038 --> 00:43:01,666
Hey, I'm Ace, remember?

553
00:43:04,443 --> 00:43:07,037
There it is, man, number 301.

554
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:13,712
Aren't you going?

555
00:43:15,354 --> 00:43:17,151
I'll go then.

556
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:32,493
Ouch!

557
00:43:37,443 --> 00:43:39,638
- Who is it?
- It's me.

558
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:46,575
Can I talk to you, sir?

559
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:48,986
What do you want, kid?

560
00:43:49,188 --> 00:43:50,985
It's about your son.

561
00:43:57,596 --> 00:44:00,861
Look, he's turning 18.

562
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:02,891
So what?

563
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:06,429
Well...
We're having a party for him.

564
00:44:06,805 --> 00:44:08,363
Fine. Happy birthday.

565
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,734
At the field, next Saturday.

566
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:14,674
- You should come.
- Lf I'm alive, I'll show up.

567
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,408
You'll be alive. You can make up
for the 17 others you missed.

568
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:40,037
I told your dad
we were having a party.

569
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:42,139
What party, man?

570
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:44,707
I didn't know what to say,
so I made it up.

571
00:44:45,677 --> 00:44:49,238
You're crazy, man.
What are we gonna do now?

572
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:52,008
Do I have to think of everything?

573
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:55,846
I can't have a party
without Camila.

574
00:44:56,889 --> 00:44:59,858
That's between you
and your cousin Midnight.

575
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:31,519
- Here, boss.
- Crazy, man!

576
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:33,787
This is good stuff.

577
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:41,396
- Get this rifle.
- And a pistol.

578
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:50,975
I love you so much, my son.

579
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:56,504
You're doing the right thing.
God be with you.

580
00:46:37,656 --> 00:46:39,214
Let's go, Little Pel?!
Play hard!

581
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:42,359
Goal! Goal!

582
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:44,923
Over here!
Coc? O, go! Little Pel?!

583
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:47,054
Press him, Coc? O!

584
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,941
Over here, Coc? O!

585
00:46:58,577 --> 00:47:00,909
Yeah, Coc? O, that's great!

586
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:08,815
Let's score now!

587
00:47:09,688 --> 00:47:13,454
Run! Run, boys!
Quick, run!

588
00:47:14,693 --> 00:47:17,093
You're the first to die,
you motherfucker!

589
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,525
- It's Fasto! Let's go!
- Move!

590
00:47:23,735 --> 00:47:24,759
Kill Fasto!

591
00:47:32,244 --> 00:47:34,075
Show your faces!
Fasto is here, you fuckers!

592
00:47:46,725 --> 00:47:48,386
Move it!

593
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:51,492
Move it!
For fuck's sake!

594
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:56,364
Hurry, in here!

595
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,934
Run!

596
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:14,777
Stay alert!

597
00:48:15,554 --> 00:48:17,818
You're making too much noise!

598
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:19,915
Shut up!

599
00:48:23,996 --> 00:48:27,557
He got away, dammit!
Keep your eyes open!

600
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:29,165
Move out!

601
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:31,268
- Run.
- Run!

602
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,862
Shoot 'em!

603
00:48:37,743 --> 00:48:40,405
Quick, up here!

604
00:48:46,518 --> 00:48:48,918
- There, there!
- Fuck!

605
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:51,580
Stay alert!

606
00:48:53,191 --> 00:48:54,749
It's getting bad!
Let's split.

607
00:48:55,027 --> 00:48:56,995
No way!
We're gonna kill the motherfuckers.

608
00:48:57,195 --> 00:49:00,323
They have machine guns!
They'll massacre us!

609
00:49:01,366 --> 00:49:02,958
- Let's go, Midnight.
- Down here!

610
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:05,227
Down this way!

611
00:49:07,372 --> 00:49:10,000
That's his grandma's house,
watch out!

612
00:49:12,577 --> 00:49:14,943
Let's split!

613
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:18,844
- Where's Midnight?
- What is this?

614
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:20,584
Move! Get out!

615
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,915
- Where's my grandson?
- As good as dead!

616
00:49:24,122 --> 00:49:26,852
Anyone in his family
has to leave the hill.

617
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:28,856
Burn the place down!
More alcohol!

618
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:31,529
Pour alcohol on everything!

619
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:52,743
Cris!

620
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:21,841
- You're destroying our lives.
- It's for our house, for Clayton.

621
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:24,140
You want me
to bring Clayton up alone?

622
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,815
My dad and Valeria
are helping you.

623
00:50:27,018 --> 00:50:28,610
But it's a mother's job.

624
00:50:34,059 --> 00:50:36,584
It's my grandmother!
Open up!

625
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,828
I have to go
or I'll miss my plane.

626
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,027
I paid the overdue rent.
Now it's up to you.

627
00:50:46,271 --> 00:50:47,670
But Cris...

628
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,609
Grandma!
Where are you going?

629
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,335
I'm leaving.
I can't live here anymore.

630
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:56,673
You should leave too.
You're his cousin.

631
00:50:56,882 --> 00:50:58,873
Okay, grandma, calm down.

632
00:50:59,084 --> 00:51:00,244
- Calm down?
- I found my dad.

633
00:51:00,452 --> 00:51:02,545
Cris, I can't care
for Clayton alone.

634
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:06,284
Look after yourself, Wallace.

635
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,217
He's your son,
you can't leave him.

636
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:11,987
You're the one
who's leaving him!

637
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:15,364
Cris, don't do this to me!
Please!

638
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,601
- Cris left me, man.
- I can't stay in the hill.

639
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:27,745
She left me with Clayton.

640
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:37,317
- Where are you sleeping tonight?
- The guardhouse. Want to come?

641
00:51:37,689 --> 00:51:39,247
No, that's okay.

642
00:51:40,192 --> 00:51:41,625
See you.

643
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:44,022
You can sleep at your father's.

644
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,924
I'll see...

645
00:51:46,164 --> 00:51:48,064
- See you later.
- See you.

646
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:56,764
Go, go. Stay alert.

647
00:51:57,576 --> 00:51:59,806
Careful there, Midnight.

648
00:52:01,913 --> 00:52:03,744
Fuck!
It's Fasto's guys!

649
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:06,441
Head for the tunnel!

650
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:16,360
- Run, Midnight! Run, it's Fasto!
- Midnight, it's Fasto.

651
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:19,026
Stop the car!

652
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:21,664
Stop the fucking car!

653
00:52:21,867 --> 00:52:23,528
Let's go!

654
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:33,404
Fuck!

655
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:38,207
Keep your cool, Midnight!

656
00:52:39,718 --> 00:52:41,549
Let's go, quick!

657
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:48,792
Come on! I'll take you on!
Motherfuckers!

658
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:50,791
Stop, you fucking asshole!

659
00:52:53,899 --> 00:52:56,459
Get the fuck out!

660
00:52:56,668 --> 00:52:58,636
Get out, fucker!

661
00:52:58,837 --> 00:53:01,431
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

662
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,301
Get out!
Out of the car!

663
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:10,338
I'm gonna kill you!
Freeze! Stay there, fucker!

664
00:53:10,548 --> 00:53:12,175
I'm the boss here!

665
00:53:12,384 --> 00:53:15,615
Let's go! Get in!

666
00:53:17,589 --> 00:53:19,682
Get in the car!

667
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:21,552
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

668
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,489
Let's get outta here!

669
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,622
Step on it! Go!

670
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,021
Fuck you all!
The hill is mine!

671
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:06,433
Please protect our homes, Jesus.

672
00:55:24,582 --> 00:55:27,881
BALD HILL

673
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:39,129
- Hey, Midnight.
- Hey, bro.

674
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:45,066
Appreciate your help, man.

675
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,665
When we take back our hill,
we'll repay you.

676
00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:48,998
- Was it Fasto?
- Yes.

677
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:52,176
I told you so many times.
Right is right, wrong is wrong.

678
00:55:52,377 --> 00:55:54,038
I finally gave up.

679
00:55:54,245 --> 00:55:56,770
Bebez? O!
Get rid of that car, for chrissake!

680
00:55:56,981 --> 00:56:00,144
I told you, bro,
that guy's a fucking Judas!

681
00:56:00,585 --> 00:56:03,452
One thing I fucking hate,
Midnight, is a Judas.

682
00:56:03,922 --> 00:56:05,947
If anyone here is a Judas,
he's dead!

683
00:56:06,157 --> 00:56:07,624
Pisses me off.

684
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:11,523
Relax, bro.
We can chill at the party later.

685
00:56:11,729 --> 00:56:15,221
Help these guys here!
They're messed up.

686
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:17,993
When we get more guns,
we'll take the hill back.

687
00:56:18,203 --> 00:56:21,798
- I told you to kill the motherfucker.
- Thanks, bro, really.

688
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:25,772
Fuck, if I ever catch that guy...

689
00:56:36,554 --> 00:56:37,578
Good morning, sir.

690
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:40,849
You were late again.
The place was unattended.

691
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:45,257
- There was a gang war on the hill.
- That's your problem, not mine.

692
00:56:45,463 --> 00:56:48,557
It was a real war,
you probably saw it on TV.

693
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:51,633
You're fired.
Go collect your pay.

694
00:56:51,836 --> 00:56:53,827
But sir...

695
00:57:33,845 --> 00:57:35,369
- They're out to kill you.
- Me?

696
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,912
Fasto came for you.
Look what they did.

697
00:57:38,116 --> 00:57:40,380
I swore you wouldn't
be back here.

698
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:41,745
I was working.

699
00:57:41,953 --> 00:57:44,080
They think you're with Midnight.

700
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:46,120
I didn't even know...

701
00:57:50,662 --> 00:57:52,027
Where is he?

702
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,554
Out the back...

703
00:57:54,098 --> 00:57:55,793
Get him!

704
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:18,813
Your doorbell's busted.

705
00:59:19,617 --> 00:59:21,312
Where's your friend?

706
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:22,918
- Who, Ace?
- Yeah.

707
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,715
I don't know.
We parted ways.

708
00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:36,092
You know how to fix that?

709
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:38,895
Electricity? No...

710
00:59:39,437 --> 00:59:40,563
I don't either.

711
00:59:40,772 --> 00:59:42,797
May I use your bathroom?

712
00:59:47,145 --> 00:59:49,170
At the end of the hall.

713
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,847
Excuse me...

714
01:00:39,364 --> 01:00:42,959
- Hear about the war on the hill?
- I heard on the radio.

715
01:00:43,568 --> 01:00:48,699
Things got ugly. My cousin,
Midnight, was the boss up there.

716
01:00:49,707 --> 01:00:51,504
The other guys
took back the hill.

717
01:00:51,709 --> 01:00:54,269
Our whole family had to split.

718
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:56,909
- Sheila's kid?
- What?

719
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:58,309
Sheila, your aunt.

720
01:00:58,683 --> 01:01:01,151
Your mother only
had one sister, right?

721
01:01:01,352 --> 01:01:03,547
You knew my aunt?

722
01:01:04,188 --> 01:01:05,985
I went out with her.

723
01:01:06,524 --> 01:01:08,617
You went out
with my mother's sister?

724
01:01:08,826 --> 01:01:12,284
So? You mean you never
went out with two sisters?

725
01:01:13,765 --> 01:01:16,233
Not at the same time,
one after the other.

726
01:01:18,369 --> 01:01:20,337
Is she still pretty?

727
01:01:22,106 --> 01:01:23,573
I see.

728
01:01:26,344 --> 01:01:28,244
You hungry?

729
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,172
Have one...

730
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,864
Who took your cousin's place?

731
01:01:40,236 --> 01:01:42,363
A guy named Fasto.

732
01:01:42,572 --> 01:01:46,668
He was with Midnight,
but joined another gang.

733
01:01:46,876 --> 01:01:49,436
He's a fucking traitor.

734
01:01:50,279 --> 01:01:51,507
Traitor?

735
01:01:51,714 --> 01:01:53,682
A fucking traitor.

736
01:01:53,883 --> 01:01:56,875
But he won't last long.
Traitors die young.

737
01:01:59,655 --> 01:02:01,680
Some get away.

738
01:02:12,068 --> 01:02:13,467
Well, I'm going...

739
01:02:13,669 --> 01:02:15,227
Okay.

740
01:02:19,008 --> 01:02:21,169
Can I stay here?

741
01:02:22,845 --> 01:02:24,642
Afraid not, kid.

742
01:02:26,182 --> 01:02:29,242
I have other people living here.
There's no room.

743
01:02:32,155 --> 01:02:34,089
Just one night, man.

744
01:02:36,826 --> 01:02:39,920
Then the girl jumped on me
and began kissing me...

745
01:02:40,129 --> 01:02:43,064
I totally didn't expect it!
She tore off my clothes.

746
01:02:43,266 --> 01:02:46,895
I thought,
"Wow, this is my lucky day!"

747
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:51,898
Keep quiet, kid.

748
01:02:55,511 --> 01:02:57,411
Get back there.

749
01:02:57,914 --> 01:03:00,178
- Who is it?
- Me, Ace.

750
01:03:00,383 --> 01:03:02,044
Hey, Ace!

751
01:03:02,452 --> 01:03:05,114
- This isn't a hotel, kid.
- Can I talk to him?

752
01:03:05,321 --> 01:03:08,051
Make it quick,
I don't want that guy in here.

753
01:03:08,257 --> 01:03:09,724
Okay.

754
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,025
- What's up?
- Hey, how are you?

755
01:03:13,229 --> 01:03:15,561
Not great, man,
I got nowhere to sleep.

756
01:03:15,765 --> 01:03:17,357
You're not working tonight?

757
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:20,001
I lost my job.
Can I sleep here?

758
01:03:20,203 --> 01:03:22,899
That's bad news.
What about Nestor's place?

759
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:26,200
- Can't go there.
- What's going on, Wallace?

760
01:03:26,843 --> 01:03:28,868
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

761
01:03:29,078 --> 01:03:31,273
- But why not?
- I can't, man.

762
01:03:31,581 --> 01:03:34,345
You want to talk,
go somewhere else, Wallace.

763
01:03:35,651 --> 01:03:37,243
Try Caju's place, man.

764
01:03:42,225 --> 01:03:44,819
You staying or going with him?

765
01:03:53,536 --> 01:03:55,231
Hey, Ace...

766
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:33,298
What are you doing over here?

767
01:05:33,502 --> 01:05:35,163
You miss us already, Ace?

768
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:37,168
- I'm homeless, man.
- You're what?

769
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:40,501
- Crash with us up on the slab.
- Come on...

770
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:42,302
Thanks.

771
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:48,213
Ace!

772
01:05:49,418 --> 01:05:51,818
What's up, man?
Come on up!

773
01:05:53,389 --> 01:05:54,856
It was awful.

774
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:57,851
They trashed Cris' father's store.

775
01:05:58,094 --> 01:06:00,585
The worst part is,
I don't even know what I did.

776
01:06:00,796 --> 01:06:02,161
Listen, man...

777
01:06:02,365 --> 01:06:04,333
Don't worry,
you know everyone here.

778
01:06:04,533 --> 01:06:08,469
Stay with us on Bald Hill.
We'll help you anyway we can.

779
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:09,433
No, thanks.

780
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:13,336
Here are some sheets
and a change of clothes.

781
01:06:14,076 --> 01:06:15,805
- Thanks.
- Sure.

782
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:18,577
- Good night.
- Good night.

783
01:06:19,649 --> 01:06:24,609
Take your smile out of my way

784
01:06:25,521 --> 01:06:30,390
Let me go by with my pain

785
01:06:31,427 --> 01:06:36,626
If ########m a thorn to you today

786
01:06:37,466 --> 01:06:42,199
Thorns can't hurt flowers

787
01:06:43,806 --> 01:06:49,438
I made a mistake
Wedding my soul to yours

788
01:06:49,645 --> 01:06:55,106
The sun cannot live
Alongside the moon

789
01:07:06,162 --> 01:07:07,993
What the hell?

790
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,495
What are you doing, kid?

791
01:07:13,035 --> 01:07:16,368
- Trying to fix it.
- But you don't know how.

792
01:07:17,006 --> 01:07:18,974
- Shit!
- Turn that thing off.

793
01:07:19,442 --> 01:07:22,639
- Sorry, man.
- Trying to burn the building down, kid?

794
01:07:25,114 --> 01:07:26,206
Who is this boy?

795
01:07:27,116 --> 01:07:31,246
Don't tell me it's your nephew.
That's what old fags say.

796
01:07:31,454 --> 01:07:33,445
I'm not his nephew!

797
01:07:33,656 --> 01:07:36,648
Not an electrician either.
Look what you've done.

798
01:07:36,926 --> 01:07:38,325
It's a mess.

799
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:40,858
- You're not ready?
- I'll get dressed.

800
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:42,690
We're late.

801
01:07:43,099 --> 01:07:45,067
Wait for me downstairs.

802
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:55,473
- Eat something, Ace.
- No, you eat...

803
01:07:55,678 --> 01:07:58,545
Don't worry about me,
I've already eaten. Go on...

804
01:07:58,748 --> 01:08:00,147
Okay, thanks.

805
01:08:01,584 --> 01:08:03,575
How about going
through the woods?

806
01:08:03,786 --> 01:08:08,917
Let's think about it. We have to
come up with a good plan.

807
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:11,326
Hey, Ace!
You here too, buddy?

808
01:08:11,994 --> 01:08:13,723
Just for a while, okay?

809
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:16,397
- Sure. We'll talk later, okay?
- Okay.

810
01:08:16,599 --> 01:08:18,362
Okay, everyone?

811
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:21,468
- Okay, boss!
- Keep it up!

812
01:08:21,837 --> 01:08:23,600
Awesome party here
on Friday, Caju...

813
01:08:23,806 --> 01:08:26,934
with lots of hot chicks,
right guys?

814
01:08:27,243 --> 01:08:29,177
- You going, Ace?
- Not me.

815
01:08:29,378 --> 01:08:32,609
Such a pussy!
Have some fun. Funk music...

816
01:08:34,283 --> 01:08:37,377
Show him, shorty.
Show him how it's done!

817
01:08:41,123 --> 01:08:42,750
C'mon, Ace,
let's have some fun!

818
01:08:42,958 --> 01:08:45,825
- You call that dancing?
- How is it then?

819
01:08:46,028 --> 01:08:47,017
Okay! Okay!

820
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:50,096
What the hell was that, Caju?
Ace, let's party!

821
01:08:50,299 --> 01:08:53,166
Look at you, girls think
you're good-looking, man!

822
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:55,929
I don't feel like dancing.

823
01:08:57,973 --> 01:09:02,535
Get a whiff of this

824
01:09:05,614 --> 01:09:07,241
It's spreading like an epidemic

825
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:09,077
And if you haven't heard

826
01:09:09,285 --> 01:09:11,014
About the funk train

827
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,812
Everybody wants in

828
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:16,355
When the hill starts rocking

829
01:09:16,559 --> 01:09:18,390
Everybody goes wild

830
01:09:18,594 --> 01:09:21,256
To the sound of funk train

831
01:09:28,404 --> 01:09:31,202
Hey, DJ!

832
01:09:31,407 --> 01:09:33,500
In God we trust!

833
01:09:33,709 --> 01:09:35,870
All you gangsters, life is crazy!

834
01:09:36,078 --> 01:09:39,013
We want Midnight back
on Dead End Hill...

835
01:09:39,215 --> 01:09:41,206
Heavyweight...

836
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:43,385
Like Afghanistan

837
01:09:43,652 --> 01:09:45,415
Back to Dead End Hill
With Midnight's Gang

838
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:47,748
Midnight and his crew

839
01:09:47,957 --> 01:09:51,688
Fasto, the traitor, decided to rebel

840
01:09:51,894 --> 01:09:55,523
Midnight is back
To send you straight to hell

841
01:09:55,731 --> 01:09:57,596
Heavyweight...

842
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,859
Like Afghanistan

843
01:10:00,236 --> 01:10:02,101
With Bir? O's gang

844
01:10:02,304 --> 01:10:03,771
And Midnight's crew...

845
01:10:03,973 --> 01:10:05,634
And Midnight's crew...

846
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:07,604
And Midnight's crew!

847
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,801
And Midnight's crew...

848
01:10:10,012 --> 01:10:14,346
That's right!
You did your part!

849
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:17,314
My man, Bir? O!
Glad to be here with you!

850
01:10:25,995 --> 01:10:27,189
Here's the Pel? Dribble!

851
01:10:27,696 --> 01:10:30,028
He passes behind!
The fullback sucks!

852
01:10:30,232 --> 01:10:32,200
Goal!

853
01:10:36,672 --> 01:10:39,140
Your party's tomorrow, isn't it?

854
01:10:39,341 --> 01:10:40,239
What party?

855
01:10:40,442 --> 01:10:41,841
Tomorrow is Saturday, the 6th.

856
01:10:42,044 --> 01:10:44,410
- Were you going?
- Of course!

857
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,673
I can't go back to the hill
because of the gang war.

858
01:10:49,919 --> 01:10:52,581
- Want a glass of water?
- Sure.

859
01:11:08,938 --> 01:11:11,668
Here, buy yourself something,
some clothes.

860
01:11:11,874 --> 01:11:13,603
- Wow, $ 20O?
- Is that enough?

861
01:11:13,809 --> 01:11:17,210
Yeah! Who's Roberto
Carvalho de Mello, though?

862
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:20,873
My client.

863
01:11:21,116 --> 01:11:22,640
What kind of client?

864
01:11:22,851 --> 01:11:25,081
I buy building materials for him.

865
01:11:25,287 --> 01:11:27,721
Oh, okay. Thanks.

866
01:11:28,157 --> 01:11:32,059
Bring your girlfriend
over for dinner tomorrow.

867
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:33,888
She's at Dead End Hill.

868
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:37,827
Her brother's with the enemy.
I can't even talk to her.

869
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:41,867
I'll invite Ace, he's more
than a friend. He's a brother.

870
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:46,073
No, not him.

871
01:11:52,314 --> 01:11:55,875
Think about it, three guys
eating together! No way!

872
01:11:58,187 --> 01:12:00,382
Don't you know any other girls?

873
01:12:00,589 --> 01:12:02,181
I'll see...

874
01:12:17,106 --> 01:12:19,006
- Heraldo...
- What?

875
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,471
Thanks for the present.

876
01:12:22,478 --> 01:12:24,139
No problem.

877
01:12:24,813 --> 01:12:26,747
Can I ask one more favor?

878
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,380
Go ahead...

879
01:12:32,588 --> 01:12:34,351
Heraldo Tome Coutinho.

880
01:12:34,723 --> 01:12:37,385
So you're now
Wallace Silva Coutinho.

881
01:12:40,195 --> 01:12:41,822
Here you go.

882
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,191
Let's go.

883
01:12:46,602 --> 01:12:49,901
If you're not doing anything later,
come over, I'll make dinner.

884
01:12:50,105 --> 01:12:52,733
- Sure, but I'll be there before you.
- Okay. Got the key?

885
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:53,703
No.

886
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:55,900
- Here.
- Thanks.

887
01:12:56,378 --> 01:12:57,868
18 years old!

888
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,479
Yeah...

889
01:13:00,015 --> 01:13:01,141
What now?

890
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:05,844
I'm going to look for a job,
a career, responsibility.

891
01:13:06,255 --> 01:13:08,189
- I meant, right now.
- Oh, right now!

892
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:12,724
Buy some CDs, some clothes,
spend all this cash.

893
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:14,292
- You do that.
- See you.

894
01:13:30,245 --> 01:13:32,236
I rounded it up to $ 20O.

895
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:34,245
You can keep the change, okay?

896
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,213
Your phone number
on the back, please.

897
01:13:36,418 --> 01:13:40,354
I don't have one.
When I do, you'll be the first to know.

898
01:13:40,556 --> 01:13:42,319
Write your address, then.

899
01:13:42,758 --> 01:13:44,555
Will you come visit me?

900
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:54,902
Midnight, the hardware has arrived.

901
01:13:55,204 --> 01:13:56,296
Open it up.

902
01:13:56,505 --> 01:13:59,099
The ammunition too.
Quick! My finger's itching.

903
01:13:59,308 --> 01:14:00,969
Where's the machine guns?

904
01:14:01,176 --> 01:14:03,041
Check this out, man!

905
01:14:03,245 --> 01:14:05,236
Here, kid, take this pistol.

906
01:14:06,148 --> 01:14:08,480
- And you?
- Call the other guys.

907
01:14:08,684 --> 01:14:13,644
- Check this one out, Midnight.
- Cool!

908
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:17,087
Hey, Caju, I put batteries
in the walkie-talkies.

909
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:18,816
Good.

910
01:14:19,595 --> 01:14:21,187
- What's that?
- A map.

911
01:14:21,396 --> 01:14:24,365
Some of the guys don't know
their way around.

912
01:14:24,733 --> 01:14:28,533
Look, here's the soccer field,
and here's the stairway.

913
01:14:28,737 --> 01:14:30,796
That's not where the field is.

914
01:14:31,006 --> 01:14:32,974
You're all mixed up.

915
01:14:33,175 --> 01:14:35,302
- It's not right?
- It's over here!

916
01:14:37,146 --> 01:14:39,842
- Fix it for me.
- I'll make another map.

917
01:14:40,616 --> 01:14:43,551
- Okay, make 5 copies.
- 5? What for, man?

918
01:14:43,752 --> 01:14:47,244
And do it fast!
Midnight wanted them yesterday!

919
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:49,847
What a pain in the ass!

920
01:14:52,027 --> 01:14:53,995
- For children or adults?
- Whatever.

921
01:14:54,196 --> 01:14:55,322
For children, then.

922
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:57,123
Let me put a note in it.

923
01:14:58,734 --> 01:15:00,133
Deliver it now, please.

924
01:15:09,711 --> 01:15:11,736
It's for Miss Camila.

925
01:15:13,282 --> 01:15:14,681
Camila!

926
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:18,651
Delivery for the lady.

927
01:15:19,321 --> 01:15:20,845
I didn't order anything.

928
01:15:21,056 --> 01:15:22,614
You crippled or what?

929
01:15:30,165 --> 01:15:32,497
- No, don't...
- Let me see...

930
01:15:33,368 --> 01:15:34,960
You look nice.

931
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:46,947
Is that a new backpack?

932
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:50,016
My dad gave it to me.
You like it?

933
01:15:50,519 --> 01:15:51,781
I like it.

934
01:15:56,558 --> 01:15:58,924
Ace is in deep trouble.

935
01:15:59,127 --> 01:16:01,118
I know.

936
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:05,296
He came to my dad's place
and I let him down.

937
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,468
- No, not that.
- What, then?

938
01:16:10,005 --> 01:16:13,600
Fiel thinks Ace told Midnight
he was alive.

939
01:16:13,809 --> 01:16:17,768
But he only told me,
and I only told you.

940
01:16:18,614 --> 01:16:21,947
- So Fasto is out to kill Ace.
- What are you talking about?

941
01:16:22,551 --> 01:16:24,280
And Ace is now with Midnight.

942
01:16:24,486 --> 01:16:26,249
I got something for you.

943
01:16:28,323 --> 01:16:31,292
Ace? He'd never do that.

944
01:16:32,027 --> 01:16:34,587
- No, thanks, man.
- You're with us now.

945
01:16:34,796 --> 01:16:36,661
I was just helping out.

946
01:16:36,865 --> 01:16:40,028
I saw you needed a hand,
and you let me stay here...

947
01:16:40,235 --> 01:16:41,668
so it was like an exchange.

948
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:45,203
It's not that simple.
You came. You chose to stay.

949
01:16:45,407 --> 01:16:48,570
- Where is he?
- I think he's on Bald Hill.

950
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:50,940
I better go get him.

951
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:54,637
- No, don't.
- This is serious, I have to go.

952
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:59,081
- I've never fired a gun.
- Then you better learn fast.

953
01:17:06,228 --> 01:17:08,924
You know who first
put a gun in my hand?

954
01:17:10,332 --> 01:17:12,197
Your father.

955
01:17:13,035 --> 01:17:16,368
It was your father's gun.
I was just a kid.

956
01:17:16,571 --> 01:17:19,005
He was a security guard
in a steakhouse.

957
01:17:19,775 --> 01:17:21,367
We'd go by at night.

958
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,304
- Hey, kids!
- Me and my gang...

959
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:26,811
- You're getting spoiled.
- He'd give us lots of food.

960
01:17:27,015 --> 01:17:32,214
I was a little punk.
I bugged him to let me use his. 38...

961
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:34,651
to shoot cats in the parking lot.

962
01:17:40,362 --> 01:17:42,296
We shot them all and
had enough barbeque...

963
01:17:42,497 --> 01:17:44,362
for the whole week!

964
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:46,728
Real sinister.

965
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:50,167
Your dad was a cool guy.

966
01:17:50,372 --> 01:17:53,864
A big black guy, a real man.
He was really cool.

967
01:17:54,843 --> 01:17:56,367
He had a gun like this one.

968
01:17:56,678 --> 01:17:58,873
A black. 38,just like this one.

969
01:17:59,581 --> 01:18:01,708
Here, feel it, man.

970
01:18:04,353 --> 01:18:06,184
Where was this steakhouse?

971
01:18:06,388 --> 01:18:09,880
Over in S? O Conrado.
Closed down a long time ago.

972
01:18:10,092 --> 01:18:11,559
It's gone now.

973
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,489
What was it called?

974
01:18:13,829 --> 01:18:16,662
Shit, man, I don't remember...

975
01:18:16,865 --> 01:18:21,131
It was... Something with bull...
The Fine Bull?

976
01:18:21,403 --> 01:18:23,428
The Fighting Bull...
Something like that.

977
01:18:23,638 --> 01:18:25,128
The Fiery Bull?

978
01:18:25,774 --> 01:18:28,072
Shit, yeah, that's it.

979
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:31,871
The Fiery Bull. Haven't heard
that name in a long time.

980
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,139
How long ago was that?

981
01:18:34,383 --> 01:18:37,648
A while back, I was 7 or 8.

982
01:18:44,359 --> 01:18:47,453
Come back here!

983
01:18:49,164 --> 01:18:52,497
One thing I'll never forgive...

984
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:54,726
is what they did to your dad.

985
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:59,498
They set him up
and shot him in the back.

986
01:19:00,142 --> 01:19:02,474
Only a fucking traitor
would do that.

987
01:19:03,712 --> 01:19:07,239
Did you know Wallace's father
shot a man in that steakhouse?

988
01:19:07,449 --> 01:19:09,644
- Whose father?
- Wallace's.

989
01:19:12,087 --> 01:19:13,384
No way, man.

990
01:19:15,424 --> 01:19:16,823
That's crazy.

991
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:20,392
You're imagining things.
Forget about it.

992
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,303
Wallace!

993
01:20:04,172 --> 01:20:07,573
- They're after us!
- Not me, you!

994
01:20:07,776 --> 01:20:09,641
You mean you're not gonna
help me?

995
01:20:09,845 --> 01:20:12,780
It's your problem,
solve it yourself.

996
01:20:13,014 --> 01:20:15,881
Aren't you my friend?
You ditching me, partner?

997
01:20:16,785 --> 01:20:18,116
We'll do it my way?

998
01:20:18,453 --> 01:20:20,353
We'll do it your way.

999
01:20:31,333 --> 01:20:33,665
- What's that kid doing here?
- No idea, boss.

1000
01:20:33,869 --> 01:20:35,769
- What do you want?
- It's cool, man.

1001
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:37,939
- Speak.
- I wanna see Midnight.

1002
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,971
- Who are you?
- His cousin.

1003
01:20:40,308 --> 01:20:43,436
So? Everyone around here
is somebody's cousin.

1004
01:20:43,645 --> 01:20:47,411
I'm also looking for Ace,
a black guy from Dead End Hill.

1005
01:20:48,049 --> 01:20:50,040
- The funk dancer?
- I don't know.

1006
01:20:50,252 --> 01:20:53,585
A black guy, big eyes,
a mouthful of teeth.

1007
01:20:53,822 --> 01:20:55,187
Never stops talking.

1008
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:57,881
Yeah, that's gotta be him.
What is he to you?

1009
01:20:58,093 --> 01:21:00,027
He's my partner, my brother.

1010
01:21:00,228 --> 01:21:03,459
It's cool, Dimas.
He's with us.

1011
01:21:03,665 --> 01:21:05,189
Okay, then...

1012
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,661
Everything okay, buddy?

1013
01:21:14,309 --> 01:21:17,938
He's cool,
he's always been our friend.

1014
01:21:19,948 --> 01:21:22,678
- Why are you here?
- I came to talk to you.

1015
01:21:22,884 --> 01:21:25,182
What?
You squealed to that girl.

1016
01:21:25,387 --> 01:21:27,548
He's her brother,
what else could I do?

1017
01:21:27,756 --> 01:21:31,556
Her brother happens to be Fiel.
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

1018
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,126
- I didn't mean to, man.
- You didn't?

1019
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:36,490
I couldn't lie!
Her brother was alive.

1020
01:21:36,698 --> 01:21:37,756
You didn't mean to?

1021
01:21:37,966 --> 01:21:39,763
Like your dad
didn't mean to kill mine?

1022
01:21:39,968 --> 01:21:42,095
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

1023
01:21:42,304 --> 01:21:44,704
Ask your dad who he killed!

1024
01:21:44,906 --> 01:21:48,239
Ask him if the guy he killed
was the steakhouse guard.

1025
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:51,477
Ask him if the guy he killed
was my father!

1026
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,977
Come on, Ace...

1027
01:21:53,181 --> 01:21:55,547
- Come on?
- Calm down.

1028
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,308
Who killed whose father?

1029
01:21:57,519 --> 01:22:00,647
C'mon, let's go.
Let's get outta here.

1030
01:22:00,855 --> 01:22:04,484
Outta here? You go!
You don't like it here, playboy?

1031
01:22:04,693 --> 01:22:06,524
Then beat it!

1032
01:22:06,728 --> 01:22:09,629
- Look at the playboy!
- Beat it!

1033
01:22:09,831 --> 01:22:11,890
Beat it, sucker!

1034
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,295
Get out, asshole!

1035
01:22:16,471 --> 01:22:17,904
Fuck off...

1036
01:22:47,902 --> 01:22:50,393
Stay alert.

1037
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:58,570
Stay close, like flesh and bone.
We'll go in through the front.

1038
01:23:00,715 --> 01:23:05,209
Hey, kid. The fun starts now,
and you're in.

1039
01:23:05,987 --> 01:23:09,184
We're gonna take back
what belongs to us, okay?

1040
01:23:09,391 --> 01:23:11,052
In God we trust.

1041
01:23:11,259 --> 01:23:12,817
We're in this together, Ace.

1042
01:23:25,373 --> 01:23:26,704
My boy!

1043
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:29,203
Happy birthday to you...

1044
01:23:29,411 --> 01:23:32,039
Did you kill Ace's father?

1045
01:23:33,615 --> 01:23:34,775
Did you kill Ace's father?

1046
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:37,051
Faith in God!

1047
01:23:37,252 --> 01:23:40,847
Let's take down those traitors!

1048
01:23:41,056 --> 01:23:43,149
Midnight, we're gonna
take it back!

1049
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:44,723
In God we trust, brother!

1050
01:23:44,926 --> 01:23:47,087
We're gonna get Fasto!

1051
01:23:47,295 --> 01:23:49,889
Come in the car with me, Ace.

1052
01:23:50,098 --> 01:23:54,091
Stop dreaming about
your mother and move!

1053
01:23:57,038 --> 01:23:58,403
Tell me!

1054
01:23:58,606 --> 01:24:00,130
Did you kill his father?

1055
01:24:08,483 --> 01:24:09,780
Sit down.

1056
01:24:17,826 --> 01:24:19,987
We were friends, see?

1057
01:24:21,529 --> 01:24:22,996
We worked together.

1058
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:30,671
He'd left the hill. He was living
somewhere else with another woman.

1059
01:24:31,373 --> 01:24:34,103
I wasn't with your mother
anymore either.

1060
01:24:37,212 --> 01:24:39,146
I set up this job
with some guys.

1061
01:24:40,014 --> 01:24:43,177
Shit, keep it down, man!
Open that thing up, dammit!

1062
01:24:43,385 --> 01:24:45,717
He was the first guy I asked.

1063
01:24:45,987 --> 01:24:48,182
But he was real stubborn.

1064
01:24:50,658 --> 01:24:52,888
So we decided to do it
on his day off.

1065
01:24:54,195 --> 01:24:58,564
He wasn't supposed to be there, but
he was crazy about the cleaning girl.

1066
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:08,107
I had no choice.

1067
01:25:11,513 --> 01:25:13,640
- What are you doing?
- Luiz? O, you're here?

1068
01:25:13,848 --> 01:25:15,577
Heraldo, are you crazy, man?

1069
01:25:15,784 --> 01:25:17,308
Let's talk. Don't move.

1070
01:25:17,519 --> 01:25:19,316
He came out shooting at me.

1071
01:25:19,521 --> 01:25:23,787
Fuck, Luiz? O! Stop!

1072
01:25:28,163 --> 01:25:30,324
He was going to kill me.

1073
01:25:33,101 --> 01:25:35,797
So I defended myself.

1074
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,366
The guy was my friend.

1075
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:47,414
I didn't want to kill a friend.

1076
01:25:50,452 --> 01:25:53,182
I had to shoot,
it was either him or me.

1077
01:25:56,257 --> 01:26:00,216
I got 20 years, and did 15.

1078
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,998
15 years in jail,
you have no idea.

1079
01:26:24,152 --> 01:26:26,450
I'm going to buy cigarettes.

1080
01:26:53,147 --> 01:26:54,136
Police!

1081
01:26:54,349 --> 01:26:55,782
- Easy, man.
- Don't move!

1082
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:57,415
Pull up your shirt.

1083
01:26:57,619 --> 01:26:59,246
Sit down, kid.

1084
01:27:00,855 --> 01:27:02,152
- Where's Heraldo?
- I don't know.

1085
01:27:02,357 --> 01:27:04,518
- Where the fuck is he?!
- I don't know!

1086
01:27:04,726 --> 01:27:07,456
Look! Stolen cards and checks.

1087
01:27:23,244 --> 01:27:25,178
It's him!

1088
01:27:33,488 --> 01:27:35,353
Stop!

1089
01:27:35,557 --> 01:27:37,855
Freeze!

1090
01:27:43,498 --> 01:27:46,262
You piece of shit!

1091
01:27:46,467 --> 01:27:48,628
What are you going to do now?

1092
01:27:48,836 --> 01:27:51,498
Move!

1093
01:27:51,706 --> 01:27:55,472
I said I'd get you, didn't I?

1094
01:27:55,677 --> 01:27:59,943
You're going to fucking
rot in jail, buddy!

1095
01:28:00,148 --> 01:28:01,672
Let's go!

1096
01:28:02,317 --> 01:28:04,979
You're back to jail!

1097
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:39,113
I want action!
I want Fasto fucking dead!

1098
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,983
We have plenty of ammo,
so everyone do their job. Got that?

1099
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:46,092
Don't hurt the locals.

1100
01:28:46,394 --> 01:28:48,385
Save your bullets for Fasto.

1101
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:50,564
- The hill is ours.
- Victory!

1102
01:28:50,765 --> 01:28:51,857
Ace...

1103
01:28:52,066 --> 01:28:55,058
What are you dreaming about now?
We're in this together!

1104
01:28:55,436 --> 01:28:57,267
The hill is fucking ours!

1105
01:28:57,472 --> 01:28:59,997
Let's do it, brother!

1106
01:29:00,608 --> 01:29:02,633
- Bir? O!
- Let's do it!

1107
01:29:04,846 --> 01:29:08,145
Fasto is fucking finished!
Midnight is the boss!

1108
01:29:25,566 --> 01:29:26,828
- Hey, Bir? O...
- What?

1109
01:29:27,035 --> 01:29:29,902
You go through here and
we'll meet at the Taliba, bro.

1110
01:29:30,104 --> 01:29:32,402
- Alright.
- Victory!

1111
01:29:32,607 --> 01:29:34,507
- You come with me...
- Stay alert!

1112
01:29:34,709 --> 01:29:36,609
- Where are you, Bebez? O?
- Let's go.

1113
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:39,302
Come with me! Over here!

1114
01:29:43,818 --> 01:29:45,979
Come on!
Down that alley there!

1115
01:29:46,187 --> 01:29:48,883
One on the left, one on the right.

1116
01:29:49,090 --> 01:29:51,456
Full attention, man.

1117
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:55,522
Bir? O, come with me.
The hill is ours!

1118
01:30:11,012 --> 01:30:14,038
Come, come. Over here.

1119
01:30:15,583 --> 01:30:17,107
Watch your back there.

1120
01:30:18,553 --> 01:30:20,180
Shit!
We're surrounded!

1121
01:30:53,054 --> 01:30:54,919
Turn off your lights, man!

1122
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,891
Stupid ass!

1123
01:31:04,899 --> 01:31:06,958
You fucker!

1124
01:31:20,581 --> 01:31:22,606
- Shit, Midnight!
- We're fucked!

1125
01:31:22,817 --> 01:31:24,375
Let's go!

1126
01:31:25,553 --> 01:31:27,020
That fucker!

1127
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,793
- Shit, man.
- What?

1128
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:42,868
Let's go up...

1129
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:45,095
We're going up!

1130
01:31:45,306 --> 01:31:47,399
Meet up at the top.

1131
01:32:13,968 --> 01:32:17,699
Easy, man...

1132
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:21,864
Ace?

1133
01:32:22,076 --> 01:32:25,011
He's over there.
Go, get out!

1134
01:32:38,726 --> 01:32:40,284
Hey, Ace...

1135
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:42,686
Let's get outta here, man.

1136
01:32:43,097 --> 01:32:45,622
- Come on, Ace!
- Get out?

1137
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:47,733
Whose fault is it that I'm here?

1138
01:32:47,935 --> 01:32:50,699
Whose fault is it?

1139
01:32:51,205 --> 01:32:52,365
Tell me!

1140
01:32:53,307 --> 01:32:55,605
I know my father killed yours.

1141
01:32:56,077 --> 01:32:57,908
But it was in self-defense!

1142
01:32:58,112 --> 01:33:01,707
Self-defense?
My father was shot in the back.

1143
01:33:02,049 --> 01:33:05,507
- Shot in the back?
- He put a bullet in his back.

1144
01:33:06,587 --> 01:33:08,714
What do you mean?

1145
01:33:08,923 --> 01:33:11,323
He'd never have done that.
They were friends.

1146
01:33:11,525 --> 01:33:14,858
Friends? Like you're my friend?

1147
01:33:15,062 --> 01:33:17,929
What are you doing?

1148
01:33:23,070 --> 01:33:24,867
Come on, Ace.

1149
01:33:27,141 --> 01:33:29,405
Am I not your friend?

1150
01:33:31,012 --> 01:33:32,639
I'm not your friend?

1151
01:33:32,847 --> 01:33:34,576
Then shoot me.

1152
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:37,980
Shoot me.

1153
01:33:58,773 --> 01:34:01,333
Let's get outta here.

1154
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:03,442
Let's go, Ace.

1155
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:10,314
If you die,
your son will be like us.

1156
01:34:11,218 --> 01:34:13,880
Fatherless.

1157
01:34:15,289 --> 01:34:17,382
Is that what you want?

1158
01:34:23,898 --> 01:34:25,422
Let's go, Ace.

1159
01:35:02,536 --> 01:35:04,333
Wait up.

1160
01:35:06,107 --> 01:35:07,597
Go.

1161
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:16,940
- Where's everyone?
- Things are bad, bro.

1162
01:35:17,151 --> 01:35:20,052
We've killed most of them.
The hill is ours already.

1163
01:35:20,254 --> 01:35:21,778
Did you kill Midnight?

1164
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:24,856
I killed that asshole
and had his body dumped.

1165
01:35:25,059 --> 01:35:27,084
Everyone be careful now!

1166
01:35:27,428 --> 01:35:32,195
We wiped them out.
Let's go up to the top now.

1167
01:35:35,803 --> 01:35:37,100
Shit!

1168
01:35:40,107 --> 01:35:43,133
- Shit! They killed Fasto!
- Fasto? Fasto!

1169
01:35:43,344 --> 01:35:45,778
They killed the boss, man!

1170
01:36:02,263 --> 01:36:04,288
- Daddy's coming.
- Give him to me.

1171
01:36:04,498 --> 01:36:06,523
Come here, son.

1172
01:36:13,574 --> 01:36:16,634
Calm down, calm down.

1173
01:36:28,622 --> 01:36:31,318
Sit down over here.

1174
01:36:32,526 --> 01:36:33,925
I love you.

1175
01:36:34,628 --> 01:36:37,358
From now on, it's you and me.

1176
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:42,935
I'm going to bring you up,
take care of you.

1177
01:36:46,807 --> 01:36:49,037
Now it's just the two of us.

1178
01:36:56,484 --> 01:36:59,749
We can't stay on the hill
anymore, Cris. It's anarchy.

1179
01:37:00,221 --> 01:37:02,451
I'll handle things
till you get back.

1180
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:06,489
I'm taking Clayton.
Il call you when I find a place.

1181
01:37:06,694 --> 01:37:08,218
Where will you take him?

1182
01:37:08,429 --> 01:37:11,455
Wherever I go.
He's my son.

1183
01:37:11,799 --> 01:37:13,892
Love you.

1184
01:37:15,569 --> 01:37:18,436
Let's go.
Say bye-bye to auntie.

1185
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:19,970
Say bye!

1186
01:37:27,781 --> 01:37:30,545
Go now. God bless you.

1187
01:37:50,437 --> 01:37:53,770
Take the message to Camila.
Here's $ 1 for you.

1188
01:37:53,974 --> 01:37:56,465
- I'm there!
- Hurry, and don't stop.

1189
01:37:56,677 --> 01:37:58,269
Let's go.

1190
01:37:59,313 --> 01:38:01,110
C'mon, let's go!

1191
01:38:50,965 --> 01:38:53,365
"I don't know
how long it will be.

1192
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:57,702
But now you're in there
and i'm out here.

1193
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:01,036
Away from the place
where Iwas born...

1194
01:39:02,042 --> 01:39:04,806
the place where
everyone knows me...

1195
01:39:06,213 --> 01:39:09,046
where everyone knows who I am.

1196
01:39:11,885 --> 01:39:14,353
Away from the place
that used to be mine. "

1197
01:39:23,163 --> 01:39:25,063
What now, Ace?

1198
01:39:25,699 --> 01:39:27,360
What now, Wallace?

1199
01:39:27,568 --> 01:39:29,365
What now, Clayton?

1200
01:39:32,906 --> 01:39:35,841
Let's go to my dad's place.
I have the key.

1201
01:39:36,243 --> 01:39:38,108
Why not?

1202
01:39:40,014 --> 01:39:43,814
Clayton, don't worry 'cause
I'm gonna teach you all I know.

1203
01:39:44,518 --> 01:39:45,917
- Let's cross.
- Okay.

1204
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,850
Clayton, before you cross the street,
you have to look both ways.

1205
01:39:49,056 --> 01:39:51,456
First this way, then that way.

1206
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,717
Let's go.
