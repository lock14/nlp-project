00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000
<i>Nacho! Nacho!</i>

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,900
<i>Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!</i>

3
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
For you.

4
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,300
One for you.

5
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
For you.

6
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
One for you.

7
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,400
One for you.

8
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,200
How come we can't ever have
just, like, a salad?

9
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Be grateful, Juan Pablo.

10
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,300
Today is especially delicious.

11
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,300
Orphans, smile and be happy,

12
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,200
for God has blessed us
with a new teacher.

13
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,800
She hails from
the Oaxaca Parish Convent

14
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,600
of the Immaculate Heart
Sisters Lady Mountains

15
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
of Guadalupe.

16
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,200
Sister Encarnación.

17
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,100
Thank you, Brother.

18
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,100
Children, today I want to tell you
a story about Isabel.

19
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,900
Okay, new game.

20
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,900
-Go get it!
-Hey, that's my ball!

21
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Sister.

22
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,500
I'm Ignacio.

23
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,300
God be with you, Ignacio.

24
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,000
Anyways,

25
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,600
I was wondering
if you would like to join me

26
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,600
in my quarters this night for some toast.

27
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,200
Look alive!

28
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,900
There is a man sick with influenza.
I need for you to pay him a visit, huh?

29
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
-But the sister and I...
-You are always complaining

30
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,300
of never having priestly duties.

31
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,300
Here is your big duty, huh?

32
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Go now,

33
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,200
so that Sister and I may talk
of holy things.

34
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
I like your cow.

35
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,900
Where is he?

36
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,900
Holy Father, please receive this man
to your kingdom.

37
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Thank you for coming here today.

38
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,900
This man lived a good life.

39
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,500
He had a wonderful woman,

40
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,000
a lush garden,

41
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
and a collection
of Russian nesting dolls.

42
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,300
May he rest in peace.

43
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,300
Okay.

44
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,400
Hey!

45
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,400
Ramses...

46
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,800
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

47
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
GRAND PRIZE $200

48
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,900
ENTER TODAY

49
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,900
<i>Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!</i>

50
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,600
Okay.

51
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,300
How's it going?

52
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,900
It's very late, Ignacio.

53
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,400
Give me a second.

54
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,900
Good toast.

55
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
So,

56
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,700
<i>everyone calls you güero.</i>

57
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,800
My mother was a Lutheran missionary
from Scandinavia

58
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,000
and my father, a deacon from Mexico.

59
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,500
They tried to convert each other,

60
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,900
but they got married instead.

61
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,900
And then they died.

62
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,900
So anyways, let's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

63
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,300
Tell me,

64
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
who is this Encarnación?

65
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,500
Well,

66
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,600
my favorite color is light tan.

67
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,400
My favorite animal is puppies.

68
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,500
I like serving the Lord.

69
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
Hiking.

70
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,100
Play volleyball.

71
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,800
You gotta be kidding me.

72
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,600
Everything you just said
is my favorite thing to do

73
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
every day.

74
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,800
So, you enjoy yourself here
at the Brotherhood?

75
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,500
The children, I love the children.
They are my heart.

76
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,100
But to tell you the truth,

77
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
the brothers make me cook stew
and stuff all day,

78
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
but they don't give me money
for fresh ingredients.

79
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,200
And they don't think I know a buttload
of crap about the Gospel, but I do.

80
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,900
Okay?

81
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,400
Today, I saw a man in town.

82
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,600
People were throwing daisies at him
and giving him goodies.

83
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,900
Sometimes I would like
that kind of respect.

84
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
Who was this man?

85
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,100
<i>Well, to tell you the truth,
he was a luchador.</i>

86
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,900
Wrestling is ungodly, Ignacio.

87
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,700
People cheer for him,
but he is a false idol.

88
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,100
Whatever.

89
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,100
Be patient, Brother.

90
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,400
This, too, shall pass.

91
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,200
What is this?

92
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
Leftovers.

93
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,000
Enjoy.

94
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,100
There is no flavor.

95
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,500
There are no spices.
Where are the chips?

96
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
Somebody stole them.

97
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Did you not tell them
that they were the Lord's chips?

98
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,900
I was trying to...

99
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,200
-You are useless, Ignacio.
-Silence, Brothers.

100
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,700
This is the worst lunch I ever had.

101
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,600
Your only job is to cook.

102
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,900
Do you not realize
I have had diarrhea since Easters?

103
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay.

104
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,300
Maybe I am not meant for these duties.

105
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,800
Cooking duty. Dead guy duty.

106
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,400
Maybe it's time for me
to get a better duty.

107
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,200
I think your food is good.

108
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,500
I am the gatekeeper of my own destiny,

109
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,300
and I will have my glory day
in the hot sun.

110
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,900
Okay?

111
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
See you.

112
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Hey! Listen to me! Hey!

113
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,900
<i>Mucho take it easy. I need your help.</i>

114
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
Take out the legs!

115
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,000
Listen to me!

116
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,600
Today, I have the chance of a lifetime,
but first I need a man.

117
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,900
Get off me!

118
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,900
Don't you see?

119
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,800
Your skills plus my skills
in the ring, tag team.

120
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,900
You're crazy!

121
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,700
Aren't you tired
of getting dirt kicked in your face?

122
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,900
I am!

123
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,100
Don't you want a little taste of the glory?

124
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,100
See what it tastes like?

125
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,300
No!

126
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,700
lf we win, we get 200 pesos!

127
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,700
Chancho!

128
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,300
Chancho!

129
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,400
Chancho, I need to borrow
some sweats.

130
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you leaving us?

131
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,900
No, Chancho, I would never leave you.

132
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,900
I just need to borrow some sweats.

133
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,700
NEW WRESTLERS TOURNAMENT

134
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,300
His hair. We bet his hair.

135
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,200
What?

136
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,200
You can take the Stallion.

137
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,400
I'll take the Pony.

138
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,700
I can't wrestle him.

139
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,800
But you are tall and fast like a gazelle.
You can do it.

140
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,600
Pray to the Lord for strength.

141
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,400
I don't believe in God,
I believe in science.

142
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,300
You have not been baptized?

143
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,500
Hey. How you doing?

144
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,000
He's good.

145
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,100
Hello!

146
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm talking to you. I will come.

147
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,000
Save me a piece of that corn.

148
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,200
Save me a piece of that corn for later.

149
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,200
Hey. Take it easy.

150
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,200
Come on, Esqueleto!

151
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,600
Okay.

152
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
No problem. We are dancing.

153
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,200
That didn't hurt!

154
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,100
And then I disappear!

155
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,500
Taste it. Yes! I'm going to pull you.

156
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,000
The shoe!

157
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,200
Anaconda squeeze.

158
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
Okay.

159
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,300
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

160
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Semental! Semental!
Semental! Semental!

161
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,500
Those guys were
a couple of wussies, huh?

162
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,700
They scalped my hairs, okay?

163
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,900
-I look hideous.
-Come on, baby.

164
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,200
And you gave them permission
to hurt me like this.

165
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,700
But I couldn't have anybody see
my face, Steven, come on.

166
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,600
Tonight,

167
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,200
I felt something deep inside me,

168
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,400
I've never felt before.

169
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Do you remember that one time

170
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,600
when everyone was shouting my name

171
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,500
and I used my strength
to rip my blouse?

172
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Yeah.

173
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,100
And I saw them
knock you unconscious, all right?

174
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,600
What's this?

175
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's money. What did you think?

176
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,000
But we lost.

177
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,100
We all get a piece.

178
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,700
Listen,

179
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,300
the people, they like you guys.

180
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,900
Come back next week,
and I will get another fight for you.

181
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,000
Chancho.

182
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,100
When you are a man

183
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,800
sometimes you wear stretchy pants

184
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,800
in your room.

185
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,600
It's for fun.

186
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,200
Don't worry. I won't tell nobody.

187
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,800
I'm a little concerned right now.

188
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,400
About your salvation and stuff.

189
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,800
How come you have not been baptized?

190
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,600
Because I never got around to it, okay?

191
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,700
I don't know why you always
have to be judging me

192
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,700
because I only believe in science.

193
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,700
But tonight,

194
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,300
we are going up
against Satan's Cavemen.

195
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,100
And I just thought
it would be a good idea if you...

196
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Praise the Lord!

197
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Hey, we're not allowed to watch that.

198
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,900
Hey! Hey!

199
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,700
Tag me!

200
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,300
What? What are you doing?

201
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
No, no, no, no! No, no!

202
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,500
Ignacio.

203
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,500
<i>No! No, no, no! No, no, no!</i>

204
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,800
What the...

205
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,100
Move!

206
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,000
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

207
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

208
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,000
Chancho! Put him down!

209
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,300
-Fight! Fight!
-Put him down, Chancho! Stop it!

210
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,400
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Please, stop it!

211
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,200
Break it up! Break it up! Break it up!

212
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,600
What's wrong with you?

213
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,800
But, Sister,

214
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,300
<i>they are just niños trying
to release their wiggles.</i>

215
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,100
Ignacio, they are wrestling
in a sacred place.

216
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,200
Okay, orphans, listen to me.
Listen to Ignacio.

217
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,000
I know it is fun to wrestle.

218
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
A nice pile-drive to the face,

219
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,700
or a punch to the face,

220
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,400
but you cannot do it.

221
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,200
Because it is in the Bible
not to wrestle your neighbor.

222
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,300
So you've never wrestled?

223
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,900
Me? No, come on. Don't be crazy.

224
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,000
Listen, I know the wrestlers
get all the fancy ladies,

225
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,400
and the clothes,

226
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,700
and the free creams and lotions,

227
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,400
but my life is good.

228
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
Really good.

229
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,500
I get to wake up every morning
at 5:00 a.m. and make some soup.

230
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,000
It's the best. I love it.

231
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,600
I get to lay in a bed by myself
all of my life.

232
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
It's fantastic.

233
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Go.

234
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,500
Go away!

235
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,100
Read some books!

236
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,500
Have you ever had feelings for a nun?

237
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,300
No way.

238
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,300
There is this nun.

239
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,800
I just wish I could take off this robe
so she could see how strong I am.

240
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,700
Well, bring her
to our next wrestling match.

241
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,500
Yeah, right.

242
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,400
Then I'll get kicked
out of the monastery.

243
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,800
I have an idea.

244
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Tell me.

245
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,300
Take her on a date tonight

246
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,500
and I will bring some of my friends
to beat you up,

247
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,600
but we will let you win.

248
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,100
So where are you taking me?

249
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,600
Well, Sister, I saw a bum here today.

250
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,500
There were two bums,

251
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,200
and I said to myself,

252
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,600
''Let's talk to these guys
about the Gospel.''

253
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,200
Well, where are they?

254
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,000
I don't see them.

255
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,900
They should be coming by.

256
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,700
Where is your robe, Ignacio?

257
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,200
It was stinky.

258
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,900
But these are my recreation clothes.

259
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,700
-They look expensive.
-Thank you.

260
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,800
I mean, yes,

261
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,800
they may have
the appearance of riches,

262
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,400
but beneath the clothes, we find a man.

263
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,900
And beneath a man,

264
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,600
we find his nucleus.

265
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,400
-Nucleus?
-Yes.

266
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,700
Listen, I don't like the way
those guys just looked at you.

267
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,700
Hey! Can't you see this woman's a nun?

268
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,600
And if you guys
have a problem with that,

269
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,700
well, you can just fight me.

270
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Okay.

271
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,500
You ready?

272
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,800
You messed with
the wrong guy this time.

273
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,800
You ever seen these moves? Huh?

274
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
You see these moves? Huh?

275
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,000
You think you gonna... Huh?

276
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,700
-Come on!
-This way. I think he's over here.

277
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,100
Surprise.

278
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Get that corn out of my face!

279
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,300
Release! Release!

280
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,200
I looked like a fool last night!
What took you so long?

281
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,500
It's no use.

282
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,700
I wanna be a great fighter,

283
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,300
but I can't even beat
a couple of guys in the street.

284
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Nacho.

285
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,400
I think I know someone
who can help you.

286
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,300
-The Lord?
-No.

287
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,700
He's a water gypsy.

288
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,400
He know wheres to find eagle eggs.

289
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,800
Eagle eggs?

290
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,700
I'm not listening to you. You're crazy.

291
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,500
Nacho, I'm telling you. This is for reals.

292
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,000
His eagle eggs possess
magical powers.

293
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,300
You could become the greatest fighter
who ever lived.

294
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,400
In order for you to become empowered

295
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,800
by the eagle,

296
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,200
you must climb that cliff,

297
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
find the egg,

298
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
crack open one of them,

299
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,400
and then swallow the yolk.

300
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,300
So, what you're saying to me

301
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
is if I can eat this yolk,

302
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,400
my moves will become
the best in the whole world.

303
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,300
Definitely.

304
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,700
High five.

305
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,500
-Summon your eagle powers.
-What do you think I am doing?

306
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,200
Eagle powers, come to me!

307
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,700
Please!

308
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,500
Tag. Tag! Tag!

309
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,500
Those eggs were a lie, Steven.

310
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,400
A lie!

311
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,600
They gave me no eagle powers!

312
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,100
They gave me no nutrients!

313
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,300
Sorry.

314
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,100
I don't want to get paid to lose.

315
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,300
I want to win!

316
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
I need professional help.

317
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,400
I need Ramses.

318
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,300
He's the best.

319
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,100
We need to get in
with him and his buddies.

320
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,200
We must learn their ways.

321
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,700
But they are pros.
They only hang out with each other.

322
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,700
Then we must go pro!

323
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,800
But going pro is not that easy.
It's political, obviously.

324
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,300
<i>My area, amigo.</i>

325
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,400
You see that guy over there?

326
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,400
<i>His name is Señor Ramon.</i>

327
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,400
He's Ramses' manager

328
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,600
and he owns all of the big arenas.

329
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,600
He's having a party tomorrow night.

330
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,300
We need to go and show him
we mean business,

331
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,100
that we are ready for the big leagues.

332
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Over there in the tree
is a chipmunk nest.

333
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,100
Here we have the corn.
The best in the city. It's delicious.

334
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,100
That is where I get the day-old chips,
over in a secret place.

335
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,700
And that is a crazy lady.

336
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,700
So now you got a little taste
of what I do.

337
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,600
It's pretty dang exciting, huh?

338
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,300
Ramses!

339
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,000
-How do you know him?
-He's the best.

340
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,500
No, he's not.

341
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
May I have his autograph?

342
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,500
Please?

343
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,000
Okay. Let me see what I can do.

344
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,500
Ramses.

345
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,800
How are you?

346
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,600
Hi.

347
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,600
I was wondering
if the children could get a

348
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,400
signature from you and maybe a picture.

349
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,200
Listen, the kids are orphans.

350
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,300
They like you. You are the best.

351
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,500
This party's gonna be crazy.

352
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,000
I mean, we're gonna be pros.

353
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,800
Feel it.

354
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,100
Go on. I made them.

355
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,000
Go lay down.

356
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,900
Ignacio, I've been looking for you.

357
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,400
-Where have you been?
-I've been here.

358
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,800
I've been sleeping.

359
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,400
In a frilly shirt and slacks?

360
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,700
They are my PJs.

361
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,000
Can I come in?

362
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,700
No, people might get
the wrong idea about you.

363
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,700
Like maybe you are a floozy.

364
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,500
Ignacio, I was in the kitchen

365
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,900
and there's no food
for tomorrow's breakfast.

366
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,300
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

367
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,600
-But when?
-Good night.

368
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,200
Hey, let go my blouse.

369
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,000
We are wrestlers, too. We are invited.

370
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,000
-Give me a boost.
-Okay.

371
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,800
Hey. What about me?

372
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,900
I don't think I can lift you.

373
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,700
You are too fat.

374
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,400
Good luck.

375
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,100
<i>Señor Ramon.</i>

376
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,000
<i>-Who are you?
-I am Esqueleto, the luchador.</i>

377
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,000
<i>Everybody is a luchador, mi amigo.</i>

378
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,400
I think that me and my friend
are ready to go pro.

379
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,100
Ramses, would you like to fight
this man in the ring?

380
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,500
So you want to make a name
for yourself, horseface?

381
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,900
Win the Battle Jam next week.

382
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,000
The winner will fight Ramses
in exhibition

383
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,100
in front of 5,000 people.

384
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,500
Then you will be a pro.

385
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,800
I forgive you.

386
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,900
Come here, soldier.

387
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,600
How did you get up here so fast?

388
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,200
Secret tunnels.

389
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,400
Some say wrestlers make bad lovers.

390
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,500
That they save themselves for the ring.

391
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,300
Huh?

392
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,800
I love you.

393
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,100
Sing!

394
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,100
Sing something for Ramses!

395
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,700
Okay, my friend, this one's yours.

396
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,000
What?

397
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,900
This one yours.

398
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,400
<i>I am singing at the party</i>

399
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,000
<i>I am singing</i>

400
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,900
<i>It's my turn to sing at the party</i>

401
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,000
<i>Everyone is dancing</i>

402
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,000
<i>Happy party</i>

403
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,500
<i>But Ramses is not dancing
He does not dance at the parties</i>

404
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,500
<i>Ramses is number one
He knows the secrets of desire</i>

405
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,100
<i>Ramses is the one
He puts the people all on fire</i>

406
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,800
<i>Ramses</i>

407
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,100
Steven!

408
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,500
Come here.

409
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,500
That party was lame.

410
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,900
I hate that place.

411
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,700
Hey!

412
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,200
Take it easy.

413
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,700
It sucks to be me right now!

414
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,900
-How come?
-How come you think?

415
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,300
I used to really like Ramses.
I wanted to become him.

416
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,600
But it turns out he's a real douche.

417
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,100
Well, win the Battle Jam this week
and you can fight him yourself.

418
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,900
Forget it.

419
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,800
What?

420
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,400
Because I can't go on living a lie.

421
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,400
Earth to Steven.

422
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,800
I'm a friar.

423
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,700
I'm not for that world.

424
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,200
The orphans, they need me,
and I have forsaken them.

425
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,400
I got no groceries for breakfast
because of you!

426
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,700
I'm sick of hearing
about your stupid orphans.

427
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,700
-What did you just say?
-I hate orphans.

428
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,400
-Say it again to my face.
-I hate them!

429
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,800
Come again?

430
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,600
I hate all the orphans
in the whole world.

431
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I'm not listening to you.

432
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,700
You only believe in science.
That's probably why we never win.

433
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,900
We never win because you are fat.

434
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,800
<i>Buenos días, Sister.</i>

435
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,700
So, what you cooking?

436
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,700
Breakfast.

437
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,800
Ignacio, you have a responsibility
to these children.

438
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,600
I know.

439
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,300
Well, where have you been?

440
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,100
I've been gone because I had
a lot of church-y opportunities lately,

441
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,900
outside of the orphanage.

442
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,200
Like what? Where were you last night?

443
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,600
To tell you the truth,
I went to a wrestling match.

444
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,100
You went to watch a wrestling match?

445
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,000
Kind of.

446
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,900
You are a man of the cloth.

447
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,500
<i>Lucha libre, it's a sin.</i>

448
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,200
But why?

449
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,700
Because those men fight for vanity,

450
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,600
for money,

451
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,400
for false pride.

452
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,700
Yes, it's terrible. Terrible.

453
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,700
But is it always a sin to fight?

454
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,500
No.

455
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
lf you fight for something noble,

456
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,800
or for someone who needs your help,

457
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,000
only then will God bless you in battle.

458
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,000
You must pray for forgiveness.

459
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,300
Excuse me, Ignacio.

460
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,100
<i>Precious Father,</i>

461
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,100
<i>why have you given me
this desire to wrestle</i>

462
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,800
<i>and then made me
such a stinky warrior?</i>

463
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,300
<i>Have I focused too much on my boots
and all my fame and my stretchy pants?</i>

464
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,400
<i>Wait a second.</i>

465
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,500
<i>Maybe you want me to fight
and give everything I win</i>

466
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,300
<i>to the little ones who have nothing</i>

467
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,100
<i>so they can have better foods
and a better life.</i>

468
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,600
<i>Yeah, maybe that.</i>

469
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
<i>Okay, if I win tonight at the Battle Jam,</i>

470
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,100
<i>I will know that you bless my mission</i>

471
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,700
<i>and that you want me to be
a wrestling servant of you.</i>

472
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,200
<i>I smell cookies.</i>

473
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,300
Flame! Flame!

474
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,600
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

475
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,500
Roll, you fool!

476
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,800
Flame, flame, flame!

477
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,100
Yes, it's true!

478
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,300
<i>I am Nacho, the luchador.</i>

479
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:05,900
Who?

480
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,300
Maybe you have seen me on TV.

481
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,500
Nacho!

482
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,300
No. This is forbidden.

483
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,300
I knew it.

484
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,500
He is not a man of God.

485
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,700
Tonight,

486
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,000
I will fight
the seven strongest men in town,

487
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,000
maybe the world,

488
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,700
and I will win

489
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,700
because our Heavenly Father
will be in the ring with me.

490
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,900
And he and I will win 10,000 pesos.

491
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,400
And with it,

492
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,900
I will buy the orphans a big bus

493
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,700
to go on field trips to parks
and places like that.

494
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:02,700
I'm serious!

495
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,900
Nipple twist!

496
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,200
You can't win them all.

497
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,200
Nacho!

498
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,200
Where are you going?

499
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,400
There is no place for me
in this world, Chanchito.

500
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I don't belong out there

501
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,700
and I don't belong in here,

502
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,600
so I'm going into the wilderness,

503
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,200
probably to die.

504
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,600
Well, you might need this.

505
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,700
My mother gave it to me
before she died.

506
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,800
<i>It was her lucky machete.
You can have it.</i>

507
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,300
I hope to see you again, little Chancho.

508
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,000
Maybe in the next life.

509
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,100
How did you find me here?

510
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:55,300
I saw you from the village.

511
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,200
I have some news.

512
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,500
Silencio isn't going to be able
to fight Ramses.

513
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,600
He got injured.

514
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,900
Silencio bruised his bunions.

515
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,400
They are swollen really hard.

516
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,300
He's not gonna be able to fight tonight.

517
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,500
You were second place.

518
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,900
You get to fight Ramses.

519
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,000
But I have given up wrestling.

520
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,800
Nacho, you are a great fighter.

521
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,700
And you got something
none of these guys have.

522
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,100
The childrens need a real hero.

523
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,800
But I thought you hated
all the orphans in the whole world.

524
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,500
Not anymore.

525
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,500
I like them.

526
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:40,300
And they need you, Nacho.

527
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,500
Okay.

528
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,600
<i>Dear Sister, I know
you probably hate my guts by now</i>

529
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,700
<i>and already believe that I must have
died long ago in the wilderness.</i>

530
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,300
<i>But you are wrong, I'm still alive.</i>

531
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,700
<i>Tonight I'll be fighting
the greatest wrestler who ever lived,</i>

532
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,300
<i>the great Ramses.</i>

533
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,700
<i>I know you don't like wrestling,</i>

534
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,000
<i>but know that I am leaving
all my monies to the orphans.</i>

535
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:05,300
<i>And if I die in the ring, know that
I always loved you as a brother in God.</i>

536
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,200
<i>Ignacio.</i>

537
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,600
<i>P.S. lf we didn't end up taking
our vows of celibacy,</i>

538
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,200
<i>we could maybe get married
and have a family with some niños.</i>

539
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,100
<i>But, you know, whatever.</i>

540
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,400
<i>Hug, hug, kiss, kiss,</i>

541
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,900
<i>hug, hug, big kiss,</i>

542
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:30,000
<i>little hug, kiss, kiss, little kiss.</i>

543
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,600
Ramses is the number one.

544
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,800
His legs are number one.

545
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,400
His eyes are number one.

546
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,000
His muscles are number one.

547
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,200
Ramses is the number one.

548
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,800
While I was in the wilderness

549
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,500
I wrote a song for Encarnación

550
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,300
in my mind.

551
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,300
-Shall I sing it for you?
-Sure.

552
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:13,300
<i>When the fantasy has ended</i>

553
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,900
<i>And all the children are gone</i>

554
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,300
<i>Something good inside me</i>

555
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,600
<i>Helps me to carry on</i>

556
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:28,500
<i>I ate some bugs
I ate some grass</i>

557
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,300
<i>I used my hand
To wipe my tears</i>

558
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,300
<i>To kiss your mouth
I'd break my vow</i>

559
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,000
<i>No, no, no
No, no, no way, José</i>

560
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,400
<i>Unless you want to</i>

561
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,600
<i>Then we'd break our vows together</i>

562
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,200
<i>Encarnación</i>

563
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,500
<i>Encarnación</i>

564
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,200
<i>Encarnación</i>

565
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,500
<i>Encarnación</i>

566
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,800
They are ready for you now.

567
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:42,800
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

568
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,400
Maybe we should pray.

569
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,300
Dear Lord, please bless Nacho
with nutrients and strength.

570
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,100
-Amen.
-Amen.

571
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,800
Ramses! Ramses! Ramses! Ramses!

572
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,800
Ramses! Ramses!

573
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,600
High five.

574
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,900
Take it easy.

575
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,300
Go, go, go, go, go.

576
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:20,800
Nacho! Nacho! Nacho! Nacho!

577
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:23,000
Nacho! Nacho!

578
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,900
Okay. Vertebrae kick!

579
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,200
Timber!

580
01:23:58,500 --> 01:23:59,800
I did it!

581
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,400
Hey! We did it!

582
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,900
Yes!

583
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,400
Yes!

584
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,500
-Yes!
-Yes!

585
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,800
Yes!
