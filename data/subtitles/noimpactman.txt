1
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:13,913
We’re trying to live in the city
causing no environmental impact...

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,346
and I write about it in noimpactman.com.

3
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,048
We're just cutting down too many trees.

4
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,525
We need the trees to save the planet.

5
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:30,924
And the polar bears.

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,767
I'm trying to live a life in line with my values.

7
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,061
Oh, fuck.

8
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,217
People are intent on replacing
the American way...

9
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,191
with wind power and tree-bark burgers.

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,251
Like this one New York family, the Beavans...

11
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:06,731
who are five months into a yearlong quest
to live without impacting the environment.

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,028
The rules?

13
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,935
No toilet paper,
no incandescent bulbs or disposable razors...

14
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,439
or magazines or newspapers, television...

15
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,840
planes, trains, automobiles,
elevators, plastic bags...

16
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,277
or shopping for anything new.

17
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,280
They're poisoning our capitalist society.

18
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,717
And here now to defend himself is the
patriarch of these eco-Mansons, Colin Beavan.

19
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,118
Mr. Beavan,
thank you so much for joining us.

20
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:35,451
Joining us now is the writer and
self-proclaimed No Impact Man, Colin Beavan.

21
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:40,488
We begin tonight with one man, his family
and a radical experiment to help the planet.

22
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:45,630
With more than 40%ofthe public now
convinced that humans cause global warming-

23
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:49,664
I just thought, "What if I actually tried
not to hurt the environment?

24
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,972
What would that feel like?

25
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,740
Is it possible?

26
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,303
Is it practical?"

27
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,865
One of the things
that I as a writer have wanted-

28
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,401
because my last two books were history books-
is to become more of an activist writer.

29
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,913
In some sort of humble way,
I want to have some sense...

30
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,109
that my writing is helping the world.

31
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,578
For the next year, my wife, baby daughter and I
while living in the middle of New York City...

32
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,353
are going to attempt to live without making
any net impact on the environment.

33
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,453
Ultimately this means we'll create no trash,
so no take-out food...

34
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,591
emit no carbon dioxide,
so no driving or flying...

35
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,465
pour no toxins in the water,
so no laundry detergent...

36
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:55,065
buy no produce from distant lands,
so no New Zealand fruit.

37
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,338
Not to mention no elevators,
no subway, no products in packaging...

38
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,244
no plastics,
no air conditioning, no TV, no paper-

39
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,807
Anyway, so that's-

40
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,011
That's kind of like a summary of the project.

41
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:28,168
Colin told me what the project would be,
and my honest reaction-

42
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,507
I was really excited that he had an idea
that he was excited about.

43
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,605
'Cause that was, overall,
the most important thing.

44
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,708
I thought, "As long as we're doing all these
things, why don't we throw in...

45
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,516
my two current addictions,"
which are shopping and reality TV.

46
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,252
I'm a reality-TV aficionado,
addict and expert.

47
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,353
Look at her face right now.

48
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,625
It's good.

49
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,901
I've had a really intense
relationship with retail.

50
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,771
Catherine Malandrino sample sale.

51
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,106
Jean Paul Gaultier-So fun.

52
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,204
And I'll see you at midnight,
and then we'll have dinner at 2:00 a.m.

53
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,215
Marc Jacobs is, like-

54
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:15,050
"I'm married, I'm a mom, but I'm still trying
to work it a little bit."

55
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:18,613
I'm a high-fructose
corn syrup-addicted, you know...

56
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,821
screen-addicted, meat-eating girl.

57
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,921
I would say that I was not
an environmentalist.

58
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,729
I would say that I was the typical, like,
consuming-

59
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,894
I'm a consumer.

60
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,939
I'm a take-out junkie.

61
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,872
You were scared of not being
able to consume for a year.

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,377
Yeah, I was. You're right.

63
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,743
So you tried to do all your year’s consuming
in one week.

64
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,145
I dropped a paycheck.

65
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,118
- Chloe boots. That was a lot.
- How much?

66
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,587
- I'm appalled at myself.
- Can you say how much though?

67
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,921
That's appalling.

68
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,654
That's just-
I can't even- I'm embarrassed.

69
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,792
- This was the last hurrah.
- This was the binge.

70
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,859
- I got you.
- Yeah. That's the bill of the binge.

71
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,461
Yeah, I was laughing 'cause I was just
looking for necessities.

72
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,599
- That was like Custer's last stand right there-
- Okay.

73
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,045
spending all my money on silly things.

74
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,047
I don't care how much you spend.

75
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,606
This particular spending has to do with-

76
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,619
- Your project.
- no impact.

77
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,383
- I thought it was our project.
- Oh, yeah.

78
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,357
It's "No Impact Man."
It's his book, and it's his project.

79
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,951
And he's No Impact Man, but in order-

80
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,520
But the project is. Our family is doing this.

81
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,173
Two weeks ago, on day one of the project...

82
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,078
we stopped using
carbon-producing transportation...

83
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,248
which means no airplanes,
no subways, no taxis and no elevators.

84
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,249
People say, "Well, why get so extreme...

85
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,227
'cause not everybody is gonna get
so extreme," and this kind of thing.

86
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,856
It's to experience
the whole gamut of things...

87
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,129
to see, well, what really
are we willing to give up?

88
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,194
At the end, we'll come out of it and see
what are we willing to keep.

89
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,705
What are we not?
What was too hard? What wasn't too hard?

90
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,611
The paradigm is, "reduce, reuse, recycle. "

91
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,619
So the first thing is, reduce-
Reduce our consumption, right?

92
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:31,851
Oh, I think to myself,
"You know, of course I can’t do without this.

93
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,222
I can't do without that. "

94
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,285
So the idea is,
"Okay, let's do without it all.”

95
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,595
- Come to see how big the TV is.
- Yeah. Come on in.

96
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,300
They're gonna take the TV away.

97
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:51,104
And we're just gonna not have a TV.
We're gonna be TV-less people.

98
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,476
- Yeah.
- Mommy's a little bit addicted to the TV.

99
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,843
I'm gonna be 40 this summer, and there
were just so many things about the way...

100
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:07,826
that I was living my life- especially
with Isabella- that I wanted to change.

101
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,919
I had my blood tested really in depth...

102
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,056
and it showed that if I didn't change
the way that I was eating...

103
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:18,729
I was on my way to diabetes
and had a low thyroid and-

104
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,039
And then that kind of comingled
with my 40th birthday...

105
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,010
is kind of like that moment in life...

106
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:29,536
when I think, "Well, what do I want
the second half of my life to look like?"

107
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,979
Since the first half is done.
Tick tock.

108
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,390
The project works in phases.

109
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,325
I'm not a trained environmentalist,
so I'm learning as I go.

110
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,988
Right now we're really working on our trash.

111
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:49,160
The average American creates
1,600 pounds of trash a year.

112
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,294
We're trying to reduce that to zero.

113
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,613
See that Hawthorne Valley Farm?
Certified organic biodynamic.

114
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm gonna see if we can all, as a family,
go stay on that farm for a few days...

115
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,287
and volunteer and stuff.

116
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,290
Is that okay?

117
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,555
Yeah, babe, that sounds like a great idea.

118
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,291
The majority of our trash is
food packaging and food waste.

119
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:24,200
The good thing about the farmers' market
is that most of the food is sold unpackaged...

120
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,535
so it's easy to shop there
and not make trash.

121
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,405
- No environmental impact?
- Yeah. Causing no environmental impact.

122
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,376
- Really?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,572
- Then you can't have this bag.
- Thank you!

124
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,911
How do I say this
without sounding like a dick?

125
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,419
I get upset to see things
individually wrapped in plastic.

126
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,579
You know what? Are the worm people here?

127
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,557
- What do you need the worms for?
- Well, can I tell you about it after?

128
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,493
Basically, the worms make it compost faster.

129
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,431
Honey, I'm not into that at all.

130
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,693
Okay. We can talk about it.

131
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,128
- Michelle?
- Yeah?

132
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,433
Wanna come see the worms?

133
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,240
See 'em wiggling around in there, Mom?

134
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,544
- Yeah. How do you make sure they don't get out?
- They can't get out.

135
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,779
- Wait. Is there no cover?
- Of course there's a cover.

136
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,345
- Let's cover it up.
- Wait. Isabella's looking at 'em.

137
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,891
Okay. Nature.

138
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,457
Mom doesn't really like nature,
but Dad likes nature.

139
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:32,565
So, diaper cover-

140
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,300
Made from wool-
Organic wool.

141
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,969
Nicely treated lambs.
I checked into all this.

142
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,610
There's five different techniques.

143
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:49,212
And there's the bikini fold
and the angel fold, and so whatever.

144
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,483
We're gonna try the angel fold.

145
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,491
There's confusion over...

146
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,393
whether cloth diapers or disposable diapers
are better for the environment...

147
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,991
and the industry-founded studies
suggest that it's the same.

148
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:07,404
But the fact is that we put 49 million
plastic diapers a day in the landfills.

149
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:11,307
It's the third-largest source
of trash in the landfills.

150
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,845
Does it feel different, honey?

151
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,939
- It's too fun.
- It's too fun.

152
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,280
Let's see.

153
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,377
Hey, hey!

154
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,423
Look at you.

155
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,757
- The green-century babe.
- Yeah.

156
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,353
Yeah.

157
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:36,259
We come here every Sunday
for breakfast, and we love it.

158
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,031
But as a part of our-

159
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,835
Colin- our no-impact project-

160
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:46,241
with phasing out
everything, including restaurants-

161
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,975
so this is our last supper at Pastis...

162
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,246
and our last supper
in a restaurant together as a family, right?

163
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,846
We're gonna eat food
only from within 250 miles...

164
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:00,221
so it's not that Pastis,
per se, is a problem, but-

165
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,954
For example, the wheat in the bread...

166
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,521
probably comes from the Great Plains,
way far away...

167
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,033
so it's-

168
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:14,505
That's what the problem will be
that the food comes from all over the place...

169
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,541
and we're trying to eat locally.

170
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:22,536
We can eat what we have except for the spices
because the spices would last all year.

171
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,944
Onions are not a problem.
Garlic is not a problem.

172
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,714
Squash is not a problem.

173
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,881
Potatoes are not a problem.

174
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,084
We had leek and potato soup
last week for three days.

175
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,651
I've gone off meat...

176
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,129
but I still have been eating fish,
so last night I started...

177
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,032
no meat, no fish, no nothing.

178
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:47,368
Out of everything- Out of the stairs
and the scooter and the no garbage-

179
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,670
I've definitely found
the food to be the hardest.

180
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,269
It's still hard.
I just wanna go get a baked good.

181
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,075
Why do you think foods are hardest for you?

182
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,685
Because I can't eat anything
that tastes good.

183
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,752
We're stuck now
with cabbage and root vegetables...

184
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,955
until the winter's over and the spring comes.

185
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,558
Hi, Ryan. I 'm gonna come back
in a little while to get some milk.

186
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,864
I've got too much to carry already.

187
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,303
We'll see ya.

188
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,966
The guy that I usually
give my egg cartons to isn't here.

189
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,773
The transportation of food creates
a lot of carbon emissions.

190
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,474
Here in the United States,
the average piece of food...

191
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,245
has traveled 1,500 miles
from the farm to the plate.

192
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,549
These guys have great apples.

193
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,146
I 'm wondering what your favorite is.

194
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,124
The winesaps'll knock your socks off.

195
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:44,993
There's also lots of other reasons
for eating local, like preserving our farmlands.

196
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,560
And the reason we're vegetarian is...

197
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:51,501
worldwide, meat-eating is responsible
for more greenhouse gases...

198
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,164
than anything else, including transportation.

199
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,136
There's no locally grown coffee,
so I have to cut it out...

200
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,579
so today's my last hurrah
with the iced quad espressos.

201
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,948
I'm worried that I'm gonna have a slip,
that I'm not gonna be able to do it...

202
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,385
and then I'm worried
about the wrath of Colin.

203
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,348
Because it really bothers him
when I have slips...

204
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:17,020
because it makes him feel
like the project is going to pot.

205
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,259
Basically, this is easy for Colin,
and just murder for me-

206
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,266
The food and the caffeine.

207
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,997
That's Mommy's third and last
iced quad espresso.

208
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,039
Prepare for takeoff.

209
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,003
Feelin' good.

210
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,069
Oh, my God. Much better.

211
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,895
Part of eating local...

212
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:54,990
is about getting to know the farmers
that you're getting your food from.

213
00:13:55,067 --> 00:14:00,733
So we're gonna go see Ronny
at Ronnybrook Farm and all his little cows.

214
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,239
This is the first time
I've been on any sort of...

215
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:11,045
non-self-propelled transportation for...

216
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,383
more than a month.

217
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,911
So it's kind of fun. Choo-choo.

218
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,129
Every cow has a name.

219
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,463
This is Thelma. Hi, girl.

220
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,769
Is your relationship
with the animals part of why you do it?

221
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:37,274
That's the reason we started doing it.

222
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,836
My wife tells me that when my son was born,
I had to milk the cows.

223
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,144
I couldn't take her to the hospital.

224
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,878
I didn't remember that one.

225
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,385
Let's talk about organic.

226
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,789
You don't have the "organic" label.

227
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,920
Why don’t you, and what do you think about
the organic label and-

228
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,125
Well, I think "organic" is a good thing.

229
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,069
The one thing that I am opposed to as organic
is not being able to treat your cows.

230
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,196
Right.

231
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,107
That's the only thing
that I couldn't subscribe to.

232
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,701
Which is what? Explain that to me.

233
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,476
Well, if a cow gets sick,
you can't use any antibiotics.

234
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,985
That's the problem I have
is lettin' cows die.

235
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,046
These have been the same cows
for generations.

236
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,614
Wow.

237
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,217
Hi, honey.

238
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:35,066
So let me ask you this. So everything you're
saying- So let's go to the other end.

239
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,763
People are onboard the organic marketing bus.

240
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,863
The most important thing-
the reason local is important-

241
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,876
is I want to make the food chain legible.

242
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,970
If I’m gonna buy a grape from you,
I wanna go see what you’re doing.

243
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,848
You might not be certified organic,
but everything you do is organic or better.

244
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,079
In milk, it only has to be-

245
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,248
it only has to be local...

246
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,316
and you have to go see
the treatment of those animals.

247
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,361
You gotta go see it.

248
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,764
This is an entirely local-food frittata.

249
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,369
Now, the root vegetables
come from an upstate farm.

250
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,778
Red cabbage- Also upstate New York.

251
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,214
Eggs and cheese-

252
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,684
It's from upstate New York too.

253
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,548
- Did you hear the phone ring?
- I did.

254
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,556
- That was Robin.
- Yeah?

255
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:37,755
And basically, the deal is that the wanna
try and make this the cover story.

256
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,229
Yeah.

257
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:43,496
But early Monday morning at 7:00 a.m.,
Robin needs to have the new draft in his hand.

258
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,299
So I'm...

259
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,502
feeling so debilitated
by my caffeine withdrawal...

260
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,635
that I feel like it's gonna affect my work.

261
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,509
- Uh-huh.
- I feel like this is a really important story.

262
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,846
This is what I think.
Why don’t you wait until whenever-

263
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,545
- When are you gonna start doing the work?
- After our dinner party.

264
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,214
Why don’t you wait
till then, and then you can decide.

265
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,150
You've gotta be kidding me.

266
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,788
I feel like my head
is about to pop off my body.

267
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,265
It's gonna help me through the process,
and I feel like it's gonna be stressful...

268
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,327
and so why not avail myself of that help?

269
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,531
Just a second.

270
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,872
What you really mean is,
you want some coffee right now.

271
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,174
- It's got nothing to do-
- I'm gonna take the dog out.

272
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,909
-Juice up.
- That's what you really-

273
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,248
Yeah, I wanna go use. I wanna go on a run.

274
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,379
- Well, I don't care.
- But you do care.

275
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,185
- Well, you know-
- I only eat local food. I don't create any garbage.

276
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,196
- I don't eat anything-
- Wait, wait.

277
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,529
You only eat local food,
but who provides it...

278
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,795
gets up in the morning
and makes you breakfast every day-

279
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,858
- You.
- does your lunch-

280
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,564
- You.
- does your dinner-

281
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,836
- That wasn't the point.
- Then washes the dishes when it's all done?

282
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,139
I wash the dishes.

283
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:03,944
What really happened is, Robin called you up,
and you thought, "Oh, this is an excuse."

284
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,815
So you’re gonna have your-You're mad at me.

285
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,320
And I'm telling you that I'm gonna go
take care of myself.

286
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,823
You're putting words in my mouth.
I never said I was mad.

287
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:17,885
I am now going to go take care of myself
and get an iced quad espresso, and maybe two.

288
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,952
I don't know.

289
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,331
I don't want to let everyone down,
or let myself down.

290
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,835
I use this spicy olive oil,
and it's the remnants of our olive oil...

291
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,470
'cause pretty soon
we won't be able to use olive oil.

292
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,776
- And you're going to do without power here?
- Eventually.

293
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,443
Well, what about power
in somebody else's apartment?

294
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,976
If somebody were to invite us
to watch TV at their house, we'd say yes...

295
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,750
'cause it was a social occasion.

296
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,791
I'm not begging, but close.

297
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,688
- Clothing?
- Used clothes are allowed.

298
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:56,598
No new materials, but Michelle,
I think, wants to go cold turkey.

299
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,126
For the whole year.
I'm not gonna buy anything all year.

300
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,368
It's been really great letting it go,
'cause I've been able to rethink everything.

301
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,933
What do I use? What don't I use?

302
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,447
'Cause Colin's out of style anyway.

303
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,212
We're the superficial friends.

304
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,850
Second syllable.

305
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,447
Good job.

306
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,785
At first, because it was our habit
to watch TV, we missed it.

307
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,524
And now that space is filled...

308
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,999
with being in the moment,
with friends and each other.

309
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,642
I 'm making cornmeal porridge...

310
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,552
which we have a lot, even though Michelle
doesn't like it that much...

311
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,114
because there's not that much
we can get locally.

312
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,425
So cornmeal porridge is what it is.

313
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,066
My apple.

314
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,441
- Okay, give Mommy a kiss good-bye.
- I love you.

315
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,243
I'll see you later, okay, honey?
I'm gonna go to work.

316
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:36,097
And I put a post on the blog
called "How We Avoid Making Trash."

317
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:39,137
"No Indian food in throwaway take-out tubs.

318
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,866
No Chinese food in plastic throwaway tubs.

319
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,374
No Italian food in plastic throwaway tubs.

320
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,378
No soda cans. No water in plastic bottles.

321
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,711
Canceling our magazine
and newspaper subscriptions.

322
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,774
Putting an end
to the junk mail tree killing."

323
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,616
I'm calling up the companies...

324
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,920
to ask them not to send them to us anymore.

325
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:05,589
"Returning egg and berry cartons to the
vendors at the farmers' market for reuse.

326
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,827
Buying milk in returnable, reusable bottles.

327
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,495
Carrying my ultra-cool,
reusable cup and water bottle...

328
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,335
which is a glass jar
I diverted from the landfill.

329
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:20,102
Using baking soda from a recyclable
container to brush my teeth.

330
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,674
Switching to real- meaning cloth- diapers.

331
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,082
Shopping for food only from the bulk bins...

332
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:30,280
and from the local farmers' market,
where food is unpackaged and fresh."

333
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,256
If I want what's inside this box,
why do I need the box?

334
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,520
And inside the box, there's a bag.

335
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,792
"No throwaway plastic razors
and blade cartridges.

336
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,528
Using old clothes for rags
around the apartment instead of paper towels.

337
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,968
Keeping a worm bin
to compost our food scraps...

338
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,131
into nourishment
that can be returned to the earth...

339
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:52,540
instead of toxins
that seep from the landfills."

340
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,841
Here. Look at this.

341
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:59,350
They're gonna eat, I think you told me,
three pounds of food material-

342
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,976
A week. Yeah.

343
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,989
Before the project started, we took four days
where we saved all our trash.

344
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,322
There was 90 gallons in four days,
which is kind of disgusting.

345
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,860
This is our combined trash for a week.

346
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:24,032
- Okay, so, we've done the trash phase.
- Yeah.

347
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,771
- And we've done the local-eating phase.
- Yeah.

348
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,575
And now we're moving
into the sustainable consumption phase.

349
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,516
But what about transportation
and all the other stuff we’ve done?

350
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,917
Yes, but those
aren't part of the phases.

351
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,150
- So now we're moving into-
- Okay.

352
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:47,858
Making sure that we don't have any environmental
impact through purchasing, basically.

353
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,267
So the first rule is,
don't buy new products. Okay?

354
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,431
But we can borrow, rent or buy used.

355
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,600
Do you have to go to the potty?

356
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,610
Do you have to go to the potty?

357
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,669
Do you want some toilet paper?

358
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,615
Actually, we're out of toilet paper.

359
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,878
Honey, do we have any toilet paper?

360
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,685
One thing that's really, really hard
is for a consumer...

361
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,021
to figure out what's okay to buy
and what's not okay to buy...

362
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,754
and what should be disposable
and what's not disposable, right?

363
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,764
- Yeah.
- So that research is really, really hard to do...

364
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,823
- and nobody can do it all.
- Yeah.

365
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:27,270
But if you just cut out
consuming the things you don't really need-

366
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,330
- Yeah.
-you've already done it.

367
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,933
- Yeah!
- You don't have to do the research.

368
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,038
So if you discover that really you don't
need toilet paper, you can just reuse cloths-

369
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:40,016
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You don't have to buy toilet paper...

370
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,553
and you don't have to do the research
about toilet paper.

371
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,988
You get it?

372
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,752
- Yeah.
- Do we really want to be this graphic?

373
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,817
'Cause-

374
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,227
The thing about it is,
is you don't know until you try.

375
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,822
I feel like I'm gonna lose my job.

376
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:01,171
The public health mockery of us
is just gonna be-

377
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,673
- It's a one-year experiment.
- Right.

378
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,370
Isn't it making you,
No Impact Man, so fringe and wacko...

379
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,347
that you’ll just be discounted
as a fringe wacko?

380
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,007
I'm just asking rhetorically.

381
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,916
But if I tried it,
and I found out that it works...

382
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,853
and it's environmentally better
and it's no problem...

383
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:23,088
and it can be done just as hygienically,
then I don't see why it would cheapen it.

384
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:27,359
But if I don't try it,
I won't know at all.

385
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,669
- You see?
- Oh, Frankie.

386
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,472
What's bad about toilet paper?

387
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,873
We need our trees to absorb carbon dioxide...

388
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,710
but instead we're cutting 'em down
to make toilet paper.

389
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,375
So part of our experiment is just to ask...

390
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,783
do we have to be a disposable culture?

391
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,788
Right? And toilet pa-

392
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:55,884
And it's extreme, because we're looking
at every angle of that "disposableness."

393
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,124
Because the throwaway culture itself
is really a big problem.

394
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,188
And actually, if we were-

395
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,258
Maybe we can get away
from everything that's throwaway.

396
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,235
Tonight I was, like,
"Okay, well, if you’re gonna ask me to do this...

397
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:15,143
then I should be getting a prize, a coupon
or a voucher, redeemable for something."

398
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,374
But I don't really want anything.

399
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,576
And then the next thought was-

400
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:24,884
I felt this sadness for the wanting part
of me kind of dying a little bit...

401
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:26,947
and it felt like there was just a hole there.

402
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,526
So what is left?

403
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,565
- What's that?
- It's all the stuff that we're gonna give away.

404
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,540
From cleaning out the closets.

405
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,098
Okay, ready?

406
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,450
This is called "inventory reduction."

407
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,419
I've never, ever been here before
where there's been a Marc Jacobs bag.

408
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:08,193
- You already have that exact same bag.
- No, I don't, honey.

409
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,427
- You don't?
- Honey, I have the white Sophia.

410
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,062
- And what's that?
- That's not white.

411
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:16,073
It's a kind of taupe,
and it's a totally different bag.

412
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,582
Maybe ours was a little bigger.
I don't know.

413
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,955
But, anyway, it just reminds me of our TV.

414
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,503
You're on New York public radio,
WNYC, FM and AM, New York...

415
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,470
and wnyc.org.

416
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,303
Mostly sunny skies in Central Park at 10:00.

417
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,334
My first guest today is No Impact Man.

418
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:58,007
Colin Beavan just walked
up 24 flights of stairs...

419
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,142
accompanied by your host, who is not proud-

420
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:04,621
or tired- to avoid consuming
electricity in an elevator.

421
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,782
For those of you who happen to have
the New York Times around...

422
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,486
take out section F,
the House and Home section.

423
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,928
There's a big, green-tinted picture
of Colin Beavan's apartment...

424
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,932
with his wife and daughter and everything.

425
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,926
One of the biggest pictures I've ever seen
in the New York Times-

426
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,838
of one of the littlest apartments I've ever
seen in the New York Times.

427
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,841
I rode home from The Brian Lehrer Show,
and I thought...

428
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,104
"I'm gonna go see if any of my friends saw
the New York Times story...

429
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,112
and e-mailed me to say congratulations"...

430
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,480
and there was 150 e-mails.

431
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:37,988
The subject line says things like
"Greetings from The Today Show.”

432
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:41,719
Hi. This is Mary Knowles.
I'm a producer for Bill Maher.

433
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,454
At first I was excited...

434
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,055
but then when I saw how many requests
there were, and I didn't know what to do...

435
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:51,466
I went from excited to scared out of my mind.

436
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,495
Hi, Colin. My name is Celia Converse.
I work with the Discovery Channel.

437
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,734
Hi, Mr. Beavan. My name is Abian Agradge...

438
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:01,336
and I'm calling from Al Jazeera in English,
based out of Washington, D. C..

439
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,814
People contacting me
from Australia, Colombia, Germany, Italy-

440
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:09,582
Time Out Kids is doing a story
about families that live in New York-

441
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,020
Sort of eco-effective,
environmental green families.

442
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,184
- Can you turn yourself more towards me?
- Oh, my God-

443
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,249
You see?

444
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:23,058
Not to mention, like, Italian television,
Japanese television.

445
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,659
Interview request from a newspaper in France.

446
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,838
Before we started this project,
Michelle and I-

447
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,847
Sir, you were talking about the philosophy.
What's behind No Impact Man?

448
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,577
I kind of am always thinking
about collective action.

449
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,778
What we as a society should do.

450
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,083
The laws that should be changed.

451
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,921
But one of the things I've always been
weak on as a liberal is individual action.

452
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,926
Why do I have to wait
for Congress to do something?

453
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:53,691
Why do I have to wait for big business to do
something? Why don't I do something?

454
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,893
The Times, though, makes it sound like
part change the world...

455
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,663
part gimmick for your next book.

456
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,968
- Do you cop to that?
- Yeah, I totally cop to that.

457
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,235
I am who I am. This is what I do.

458
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,767
But If I can take the energy
of who I am as a person...

459
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:11,543
and point that energy in a direction that-
I say this most humbly-

460
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,983
and point that energy in a direction
that can help the world...

461
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,453
then it's better than pointing it
in another direction.

462
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:22,286
This is what the New York Times reporter
says about the project at the end.

463
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,296
"It may seem at best like a scene
from an old-fashioned situation comedy...

464
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:30,460
and at worst an ethically murky
exercise in self-promotion"-

465
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:34,266
So she wrote basically that
the range of possibilities...

466
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,433
was that it's bad, or it's really bad.

467
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,443
To a reader it was really funny.

468
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,709
From my point of view, it undermines
the opportunity to cause people to think.

469
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:50,844
What if we called it "The Year I Lost 20
Pounds Without Going to the Gym Once"?

470
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:56,087
Or "The Year We Didn't Watch TV and We
Became Much Better Parents as a Result"?

471
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,688
Or if we called it
"The Year We Ate Locally and Seasonally...

472
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:03,325
and It Ended Up Reversing
My Wife’s Pre-diabetic Condition"?

473
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,632
There are actual benefits
to living environmentally.

474
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,000
So this is the readers' opinions, right?

475
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:18,371
379 comments.
Apparently it's a huge number of comments.

476
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,383
"Sacrifice now or sacrifice later.

477
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,885
I'm already doing a lot,
but plan to do a lot more."

478
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,856
Then there is this one.
"I can't wait to wipe my ass with this book."

479
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,792
This one says, "DTMFA, Michelle."

480
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:35,026
Which I'm guessing
stands for "Dump the motherfucking asshole."

481
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:41,060
Gawker is a site that kind of parodies
and sends things up that are in the media.

482
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:47,078
"Colin quietly weeps on the toilet
too moist to move, and too proud to wipe."

483
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,239
That was great. But the comments-

484
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:54,046
"My first impulse
was to rake these people with Uzi fire...

485
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,144
while screaming,
'Is that enough impact for you?"'

486
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,349
I started-
I doubted myself for a little while.

487
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,325
I think I'm doing something worthwhile,
but maybe I'm not.

488
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,327
Maybe one, it's philosophically wrong.

489
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:08,798
Because I've also got e-mails
from some environmentalists that say...

490
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,597
"Crazy people like you
give the rest of us a bad name."

491
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:16,436
Could I potentially be making
completely the wrong decisions?

492
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,569
Yeah, but-

493
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,079
I'm just trying-

494
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,913
I just try to ask myself
to do what my cons-

495
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,443
I try to follow
the dictates of my conscience.

496
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,824
I know that I can't back out now,
and I'm not gonna back out on you...

497
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,627
but it's making me not want to do it.

498
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,631
I think that it's create-
We've been reading the blogs and stuff like that.

499
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,638
One person at work has come up-

500
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,970
Who I really like.
She's a friend of mine, but I guess she-

501
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,976
Everywhere she goes,
people were talking about it-

502
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,445
Basically how we're
bourgeoise fucks and crazy...

503
00:31:56,514 --> 00:32:00,541
and she spends all her time defending me.

504
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,085
Then one guy said...

505
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:07,318
"My wife has instructed me
to never, ever shake your hand."

506
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:12,921
And she went on all night
about the hygiene and-

507
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:16,956
I understand why people would criticize.
I just don't get why they hate us.

508
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:19,503
- I don't think they hate us.
- I don't get that.

509
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,935
Completely coincidentally,
Colin and I were invited to brunch...

510
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:31,641
by this woman Kerry,
because she's a food writer.

511
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:37,348
And it turns out, at the end of the brunch
that I discover that-

512
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:42,485
She comes clean with the fact
that she had written negatively about us...

513
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,960
and had been
one of our haters on the Web.

514
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,699
She claims that she's
changed her mind about us. I don't know.

515
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,700
Let me see if I can pull this up.

516
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,929
I have been dreading this moment.
I was afraid you were gonna ask.

517
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,331
You're a sport.

518
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:55,770
Oh, God.

519
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,709
"No Impact Man is, in fact, having an impact
but probably not the one he intended.

520
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,246
Once upon a time, virtue was its own reward.

521
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:07,478
Now a vow of voluntary simplicity is just
another entrepreneurial enterprise.

522
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,521
The fact that No Impact Man's
ostentation embrace of all things organic...

523
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,786
did not come about in,
well, an organic fashion, is what bothers me.

524
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,022
While No Impact Man runs around air-drying
his ass for posterity...

525
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:21,793
less flamboyant folks are leading lives
of quiet inspiration."

526
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,666
- Yeah, I questioned his sincerity and his motives.
- Yes.

527
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:32,540
And there was a "gee whillikers" quality to
the posts that rubbed me the wrong way.

528
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,272
Your criticism,
in the context of the criticism...

529
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:40,079
is very, very mild.

530
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,143
I didn't quite get why people hated us
or why it was such a-

531
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,416
- I have a theory.
- I didn't quite get it.

532
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,221
Based on my own experience with this kind
of thing, to a much lesser extent...

533
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,855
but I think that a lot of this really
touches a nerve for people.

534
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,332
Aside from making people
feel guilty and defensive...

535
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,838
about their consumer habits...

536
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,339
people are very traumatized...

537
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:07,401
if you suggest that
they should make do without something.

538
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,345
The notion of going without-

539
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,873
- The notion of "I need it."
- Yeah. I need this.

540
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:17,182
Or I don't need it,
but I want it, and why shouldn't I have it?

541
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:20,520
This is being a good American.

542
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:47,480
Part of local foods about connecting
with the way the food is grown...

543
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,884
so I talked to the local community garden...

544
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,151
and the waiting list for having your own plot
is long, like years and years.

545
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:57,524
But it turns out that there is only one person
in the community garden who grows vegetables.

546
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,529
Everybody else grows flowers.

547
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,590
And he was actually willing
to take me on and to mentor me.

548
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,795
You gonna help us in the garden?

549
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,031
- Yeah.
- You wanna grow things?

550
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,040
That's my friend Mayer.

551
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,100
Be careful. That's a rosebush.
That has thorns.

552
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,146
That has sharp things.

553
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:20,583
- Let's talk about what we hope to do today.
- Yep.

554
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,347
This little plot is gonna be parsley.

555
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:27,790
Just kind of broadcast it
over this rectangle.

556
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:31,989
And cover it to the depth that it says to,
and whatever else.

557
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,958
Want me to tell you what I'm doing?

558
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,833
We're gonna put some plants in there.

559
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,169
So I'm breaking up the soil
so that the plants can grow.

560
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,176
I thought gardening
was supposed to be hard work, Mayer.

561
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,509
It is. I did a lot
of the most labor-intensive-

562
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,514
- When you spread the manure?
- Yeah.

563
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:55,348
- Right.
- When I dug the whole fuckin' place up last fall.

564
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,717
I'm takin' these seeds, right?

565
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,881
And I'm gonna put 'em in the ground.

566
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:04,690
Mayer, we're going to go spend
four days up at Hawthorne Valley Farm.

567
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,526
There whole thing is that everything
on the farm is recycled.

568
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,657
- Yes.
- It's all self-contained.

569
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,567
Yes. I called them up, and the whole family-

570
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,164
Me and Isabella and Michelle-
It's gonna be our holiday.

571
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,174
- That's great.
- Yeah.

572
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,654
I feel like we should talk
about having another kid.

573
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,895
But I know that you don’t want another kid...

574
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,895
so I feel like that means
we're probably aren't gonna have another kid.

575
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:54,102
When we had Isabella,
I felt like you really wanted a baby...

576
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,772
and what I wanted for my life could have-

577
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:58,906
I just couldn't keep that from you.

578
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:03,283
And I was willing to take the leap with you
from that because I felt like-

579
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,288
Also it's funny 'cause we have this history.

580
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,190
I was scared to get married too, and I would
say to you, "Are we doing the right thing?"

581
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,194
And you said yes, and I trust-

582
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:15,130
I trusted you,
and for me, it's totally the right thing.

583
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,532
But when I think about
having a second child-

584
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,061
Whose career is it that's gonna get-

585
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,300
Whose work's gonna get sidelined?

586
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,309
'Cause you’re totally riding high at work.

587
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,744
If we were to have a second child,
are you willing to give up that work?

588
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,612
I don't have to-
That's so-Well, that's so-

589
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:35,379
I don't have to give up my job
to have a second child.

590
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,044
I don't know why you’re bringing-

591
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:42,115
I don't really feel like
my work has anything to do with it, really.

592
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,127
It does.

593
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:48,598
Because the point is I wanna know
if we were to have a second child- Right?

594
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,600
I don't particularly want a sec-

595
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,761
I don't want a second child. Right?

596
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:56,170
But before we even begin to consider it...

597
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,868
there is not much flexibility
in our schedules, right?

598
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:03,004
So what I'm asking you is,
where is the flexibility gonna come from?

599
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,014
It'll come from me.

600
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:22,757
Okay. I've collected all the cleaning
products we have in the house already.

601
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,495
Standard cleaning products
contain all sorts of chemicals...

602
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:28,663
that aren't good for us, and they're not good
for the environment either.

603
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:32,869
And they end up getting flushed down
our drains and into the water supply.

604
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,877
What we're looking at here...

605
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,678
are a lot of things that are marketed...

606
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:42,651
as natural and not harming
the environment already...

607
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,316
because we've been
on the project for a while now.

608
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,256
They do not allow you
to refill the bottles...

609
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,424
and for the purposes of this project,
we don't use disposable products.

610
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,489
And people say, "Well, what about recycling?"

611
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,899
But the fact of the matter
is that plastic recycling...

612
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,769
is not as good as it's made out to be.

613
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,775
It's better than nothing,
but it's still not perfect.

614
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,176
So the people call it "down cycling"
rather than recycling...

615
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:13,046
'cause it goes down in quality every time,
and then becomes toxic.

616
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,051
As we've been running out of stuff, I've-

617
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,249
We've save the empty bottles
so that we can...

618
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,814
put our homemade cleaning products
in the empty bottles.

619
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,185
All our cleaning products
can be made from these things-

620
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,890
White vinegar, baking soda...

621
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:31,332
castile soap...

622
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,427
and borax.

623
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,470
How do you tell if it’s really clean?

624
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,033
But it feels like it-

625
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,081
It feels the same
as though I'm using a regular cleaner.

626
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,852
Hey, poop, you know
what I'm doing right now, right?

627
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,916
- I'm gettin' rid of all the cosmetics.
- My cosmetics?

628
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,225
- Well, aren't we supposed to do that?
- You mean my makeup and stuff?

629
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,288
Well, I thought so, but I don't know.

630
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,300
What are you doin' about your makeup?

631
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,359
What are you doing?
You're gonna throw all that stuff out?

632
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,371
Well, no, I wasn't gonna throw it out.

633
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,931
I was gonna put it in this box
till the year’s over.

634
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,069
Okay. Just let me know.

635
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,449
We have to put all this stuff in this box.

636
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,815
Can you help me?

637
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,098
- Honey?
- Yeah?

638
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,966
Leave that bottle that says "fresh" on it.
I'll take care of it.

639
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,504
I already left that for you.

640
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,274
Okay, empty.

641
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,469
- It empty.
- I know. I need that.

642
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,981
'Cause you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
make shampoo and put it in there.

643
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,186
A few days ago I blogged about the fact...

644
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:00,348
that we were gettin' rid of the electricity,
and I asked for suggestions.

645
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,086
And I gave a list of all the things
I needed help with...

646
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,822
and one of the things was laundry.

647
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,729
And somebody e-mailed me and said that they
used to do their laundry...

648
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,131
in the bathtub,
and they would just walk on it.

649
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,670
And that sounded good to me.

650
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,302
You wanna do it too?

651
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,137
Now we go backwards.

652
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,673
Mom?

653
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,717
We're doing the laundry.

654
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,946
I wanna do it myself.

655
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,250
You wanna do it yourself?
But I'm worried you'll fall over.

656
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,282
Don't fall over.

657
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,055
What are you cleaning these clothes with?

658
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,062
Castile-

659
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,032
I told you not to fall.
I told you not to fall.

660
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,831
- What's in there?
- Castile soap and borax.

661
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,838
- What's borax?
- It's natural.

662
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,840
It's all natural laundry stuff.

663
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,967
- You wanna get in?
- Yes.

664
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,505
- A laundry.
- You're doin' the laundry.

665
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,182
When she goes to college,
she's gonna be-

666
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,721
You made the water so cold.

667
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:08,588
- Well, they've been soakin' for three hours.
- Well, this isn't fun.

668
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,991
Come on. It's like crushing grapes.

669
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,359
Come on, get it clean, kids.

670
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,228
- I see something troublesome.
- Troublesome? What?

671
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,428
- Okay. That's all right.
- See? Always lookin' for trouble.

672
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:23,997
- A laundry.
- We're all doing a laundry.

673
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,884
Don’t your friends think you’re insane?

674
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,782
And I'm trying to imagine-

675
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,913
When they come over
for supper at your house...

676
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:42,015
for parsnips or whatever it is
you have lying around.

677
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:43,650
What do your friends say about this?

678
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,924
With no napkins and no toilet paper.

679
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,090
Could you do it?

680
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,634
Nobody has to do what I do.

681
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,432
That's not the important thing.
What I'm doing brings attention to the issue.

682
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,235
But all of us should just learn
to do what we can do.

683
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,242
You're now-What? Five and a half months in.

684
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,940
Next step is to get rid of electricity
and live by daylight alone in New York City.

685
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,278
Saturday-There's a switch in my apartment...

686
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,284
which is the circuit breaker
for the whole apartment.

687
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,982
We're having a little party for our friends,
and we're gonna click the switch off, so, yeah.

688
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,287
We should let everybody know
we're gonna be following Colin...

689
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,453
throughout this long year.

690
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,932
I was gonna get some spinach...

691
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,630
but now that the electricity's going off,
I realize I can't buy a lot of stuff.

692
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:32,642
I gotta just buy for the next couple of days
because everything will just spoil.

693
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,946
Tonight we're switching off
the electricity...

694
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,983
and I haven't really thought about it,
but I actually feel-

695
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,625
We're moving into the sixth month...

696
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,633
and I'm starting to really
get into the dividends...

697
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,635
and the benefits are really
starting to pour in...

698
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,399
so I'm actually kind of excited,
but I'm sure that-

699
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,306
Talk to me in a day,
and I might be just miserable.

700
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,867
Let's just talk a little bit about
what it's gonna be like.

701
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:13,008
Well, there's gonna be a transition period
that's hard like everything else.

702
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:26,187
Hi. Hi, baby.

703
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,788
- How are you?
- How's it goin'?

704
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,993
- Hello! How are you?
- Hi.

705
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:33,229
"Composed of post-consumer
recycled materials.

706
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,567
Help us help the planet."
Is that not good enough?

707
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,909
Tell me what’s wrong with it.

708
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,911
- It's a disposable cup.
- Yes.

709
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,913
- Non-recyclable top.
- Yes.

710
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,142
And the jacket, and then the-

711
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,207
And then you have two cups, in fact,
it looks like.

712
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:51,982
- You've broken every rule.
- Every rule there is. Okay.

713
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,753
Have you guys seen our new refrigerator?

714
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,590
- You want one, don't you?
- What's the story?

715
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,324
- What's it called?
- It's called a pot in a pot.

716
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,925
It was invented for use in Nigeria.

717
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:07,163
And the idea is that the-

718
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,432
The water evaporates from the-

719
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,805
The sand in between the two pots is wet,
and the water evaporates...

720
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:16,073
and the energy of evaporation
is taken from the inner pot...

721
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,011
which causes it to cool down.

722
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,174
And, for example, a tomato-

723
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:25,381
which would only last
in Nigeria two days after picking-

724
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,617
in this thing would last three weeks.

725
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:31,627
And there's a glass of water in there right now,
so we're gonna see if the glass and water-

726
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,720
See, I thought that was part
of the refrigeration.

727
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,890
No, the glass of water’s
in there 'cause we're gonna see...

728
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,991
at the end of the night,
if the glass of water’s cold.

729
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,263
I thought that was like
the nuclear core-

730
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,308
that drove the whole thing.

731
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,866
- Nuclear energy.
- It's not. Okay.

732
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,039
- I got the gist of it.
- Oh, yeah?

733
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,549
And are these from the farmers' market?

734
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,710
Yes.

735
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,016
Okay, here we go.

736
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:02,715
-Just sit.
- We're fine.

737
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,728
It's colder, but it's not that cold.

738
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:28,873
Futz with it, I suppose, and see
if there’s a way to make it a bit colder.

739
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,919
This has become my Four Seasons.

740
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:46,519
I have my lights.

741
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,191
Somebody comes in, empties my garbage.

742
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,565
And there's, you know...

743
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:56,595
plenty of heat and electricity
and air conditioning.

744
00:47:56,673 --> 00:48:01,440
So now my huge treat has become...

745
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,445
the ice. I'm gonna go show you.

746
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,504
Technically, the ice
shouldn't be allowed either...

747
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,072
but I...

748
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,116
allow myself the ice.

749
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,150
It's really good.
It's tap- New York City tap.

750
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,458
So it's just as good as bottled water.

751
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,862
Probably cleaner and better
than a lot of bottled waters.

752
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:30,733
It's good to get the ice- But to get it
really cold, you have to wait a little bit.

753
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,741
You guys, I wanna run a story by you.

754
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:37,872
Basically, I got a really good,
juicy inside dope today.

755
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,746
It's kind of like a "what went wrong" story.

756
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,216
They focused on their weaknesses.

757
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,811
They totally neglected
and under invested in their strengths.

758
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:48,756
At this point, I just have to just report
the thing to death, right?

759
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:53,057
And then see what we have midday Monday.

760
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,121
- This is a very big story.
- I know.

761
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:59,828
This is the first story where I didn't even
think about having to do it without caffeine.

762
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:03,771
I'm making some progress.
I'm making some progress.

763
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,678
Honey?

764
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,718
Do you remember where you put the matches?

765
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,649
Wait. Hang on. Hang on. Here they are.

766
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,323
I got 'em.

767
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,724
It's kind of really our first
night without the electricity...

768
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,134
'cause last night we had people over, and we
had the electricity for most of the night.

769
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,380
Are you down?

770
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,813
Are you mad at me?

771
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,187
What is it, babe?

772
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,395
It's stupid.

773
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,924
- What, the project's stupid?
- Well, the going without electricity.

774
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,631
Who's gonna go without electricity?
That's dumb.

775
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,406
So that's what's really bothering you?
You're afraid that-

776
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:18,175
I just think it's gonna be-
I feel like it's a pain in the ass.

777
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:20,341
It kind of is.

778
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,885
- Can't argue with you there.
- I don't know.

779
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:26,445
I just feel like
the whole project's a curio-

780
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,549
maybe a curiosity...

781
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,856
but not-

782
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,932
Everybody will have moved on by the time
the book comes out, and-

783
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,531
It's just gonna be another irrelevant book.

784
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:44,438
Let's just say it turns out
that it's totally stupid.

785
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,170
Right? Okay, I don't think that.

786
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,974
But just worst-case scenario.

787
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:54,313
So we had a ball.

788
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,444
We've had a ball doing it so far.
It's been hard, but it's been fun, hasn't it?

789
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,817
Yeah, it's been fun.

790
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:32,147
New York Public Radio,
WNYC, FM and AM New York and wnyc.org.

791
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,661
And the heat index issue
is not just a warning.

792
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,162
The heat is here.

793
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:45,065
It's already 84 degrees,
and it's only six minutes after 10-

794
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,261
That's gross.

795
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:57,576
I got home yesterday,
and there was flies all over the apartment.

796
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,387
There was a bunch of flies
reproducing in my worm bin...

797
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:13,418
and every time I opened the worm bin,
more baby flies flew out.

798
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,803
Oh, my God. Look at 'em.

799
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,035
Oh, my God.

800
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,614
By the way, look at this.

801
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:43,125
It's all earth. See?

802
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,604
I didn't think that it would work.

803
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,670
It just doesn't work, okay?

804
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,717
There's a reason why
people have refrigerators.

805
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,325
The truth is I'm just mad because I'm-

806
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:21,456
I'm just devastated about that Google
information about getting pregnant.

807
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:26,432
The statistics are so low,
and I'm basically turning 40-

808
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,631
and note the gray hair-

809
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,834
and I just feel devastated about it.

810
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,811
And I feel in a sense that somebody like me
would have a five-percent chance...

811
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,871
Iike in any given-

812
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:43,613
It's gonna work out your way anyway
because the chances are so low.

813
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,958
I totally hear that you're sad,
and I totally understand...

814
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:54,554
but it feels like a reality show for me,
discussing this issue on camera.

815
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:58,499
I thought that you wanted
to know how I felt about the pot in the pot.

816
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,402
Well, that's- I totally wanted to know
how you feel about the pot in the pot.

817
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,030
This is how I feel about it.

818
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:08,100
Our whole thing was that we were gonna
totally support...

819
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:11,079
who the other person wanted to become, right?

820
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:15,743
We were gonna kind of be onboard
for each other's dreams.

821
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,277
This is important to you
that we don't have a fridge.

822
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,950
Right?

823
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,653
I'm onboard with that,
and then I feel really bummed...

824
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:29,290
because I feel like we're
putting all this energy on your dream, right?

825
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,529
And then I'm like-

826
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,802
I'm totally willing to work with you
and talk to you...

827
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:42,140
about the prospect of having another child
and see where we get to in talking.

828
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,841
But if you’re connecting it
to the project, I-

829
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:49,248
It's tied together for me.
They're totally connected.

830
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,480
So if they’re not connected for you, then-

831
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:56,355
If I've got this right, you feel as though
you support me, but I don't support you.

832
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,360
I don't support your dreams.

833
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:02,660
I feel like this is my biggest,
most important, most precious thing.

834
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,893
- Right.
- And I feel like-

835
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:09,800
Yeah, you don't wanna do it, so-

836
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:13,832
So it's kind of like no. The answer's no.

837
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:17,813
Well, I want to want what you want.

838
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:22,181
But I don't feel like
it would be good for our family...

839
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,119
for me to just say,
"Okay, you want it, so I'll do it"...

840
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,156
when I have such strong feelings about it.

841
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,162
Do you wanna move this out then?

842
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,633
That's okay, honey. We're just gonna leave
that there just for now, okay?

843
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,199
Okay.

844
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,871
The pot in the pot has been moved out.

845
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:53,245
And this is our latest refrigerator.

846
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:57,548
To keep it cold,
I mooched ice off of my neighbor Hilary.

847
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,924
Do you need to come and get it every day?
Or how do you wanna-

848
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:08,793
I think this will last
a little while in the cooler.

849
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:12,357
Yeah. I hope so. I think so.

850
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,369
- Okay.
- Can I carry the bag?

851
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,962
Yeah, yeah.
You can carry the bag. Let's put the freezer-

852
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:21,637
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

853
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,736
- Say thank you to Hilary, honey.
- Thank you.

854
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,748
Bye. You're welcome. Bye, sweetie.

855
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,587
Okay. Perfect.

856
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:38,388
We're gonna take the ice pack
and put it right on top...

857
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,895
so that your milk stays nice and cold.

858
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,831
And you wanna just drop the cubes on there?

859
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,131
Drop 'em? One by one?

860
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,194
One by one.

861
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,974
The refrigerator is my bottom.

862
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:04,110
The pot in the pot. And now the-

863
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,917
I don't know what I hate more-
the pot in the pot or this.

864
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,480
I'm not sure.

865
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,757
Just mooching power and ice cubes.

866
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,024
So I kind of don't get it.

867
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,861
I'm kind of like, "What?"

868
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,436
Say, "Bye, wacko fridge."

869
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,802
Bye, wacko fridge.

870
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,273
Who cheats more-you or Colin?

871
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:39,253
I'm sure I have to cheat more.
Like this.

872
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,790
I tried a vegetable dye at home,
but it was a disaster.

873
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:43,792
- Right.
- He doesn't really cheat.

874
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,829
He'll bend the rules a little,
but that to him wouldn't be a cheat.

875
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,161
There's no trips this year
because we can't go anywhere.

876
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,565
So he decides that we're
gonna make an exception...

877
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,162
and we're gonna go up to the farm
where they grow all our food.

878
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,208
We walked to Penn Station with our luggage.

879
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,266
This is when the slip started.

880
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,403
I go to Dunkin' Donuts.
There's this huge line.

881
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,211
I give the lady this huge tip, and I'm like,
"Could you refill this glass twice?"

882
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:10,377
I get two huge decafs,
and I knock them back at Dunkin' Donuts.

883
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,785
- Hooking you up.
- And there's 10 people behind me.

884
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:16,724
But I gave her such a good tip
that she was just my girl for a while.

885
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,023
But I was like-

886
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:22,189
I don't wanna be putting our energy
into the pot in the pot.

887
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:23,630
I wanna be having another kid.

888
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,464
I don't wanna spend my vacation on a farm.

889
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,106
When we got married,
I was like, "Look, Colin, I'll marry you.

890
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,648
But there's one thing. I don't like camping.

891
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,707
I'm never going camping with you."

892
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,981
But now our whole house
has turned into a campground.

893
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,579
And also I don't really like nature.

894
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:51,058
And now for our vacation,
we're going into nature.

895
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:57,225
We're gonna see and work with all the food
that we eat from the farmers' market.

896
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,427
This is the farm where it comes from.

897
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,774
Hi. A cow. Cow.

898
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:13,282
- You can put your hand out and touch him.
- Hi, cow.

899
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,180
Thank you so much for having us.

900
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,981
- My pleasure.
- We're having the best time already.

901
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,113
We've only been here for an hour.

902
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,522
As you work to steward this land...

903
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,262
you are growing a very vital...

904
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,804
dynamic being...

905
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,272
that's in balance.

906
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,605
It's a closed-loop system.

907
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,305
The cows eat the grass.

908
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:48,544
They give you milk,
but they also give you manure.

909
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:51,985
The manure's composted.
It becomes the fertility.

910
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:56,492
We make about 400 tons of compost per year.

911
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,925
And smell it.

912
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:02,453
Yeah, it just smells like earth.
It smells like my worm bin, actually.

913
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:09,398
You say though a lot that this kind of is
the realization of his values?

914
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,633
- Yeah.
- Do you-

915
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,733
How do you feel about it now,
six months into that?

916
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,404
- Do you still-
- I feel like there's no going back.

917
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:20,245
There's no going back. Right? Right?

918
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,479
This is for our family.
It's not just about the project.

919
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,986
- Where are you from?
- I live in the city.

920
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:31,288
I hope to be more of a help
than a hindrance.

921
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,487
Let's go!

922
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:42,598
That's Henry. That's the Bull.
Come on, Henry. Let's go.

923
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,970
It's good to escort Henry into the barn.

924
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:50,177
The night before we left, the farmer and Colin
were having a conversation.

925
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,477
They were talking about how the valley once
was populated with sheep.

926
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:57,952
And they were also talking about how people
could devolve into animals.

927
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:03,358
And I just felt so transported
by this conversation.

928
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,771
And we went to bed that night
with the beautiful farm air...

929
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,534
and the beautiful farmhouse
with the beautiful people...

930
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:21,441
who treated us like we were family...

931
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,639
and I dreamt that I was one of the sheep.

932
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:27,239
It's weird, 'cause
my grandparents were farmers.

933
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,307
They were homesteaders.

934
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:33,048
And I started feeling like-
I feel like my family...

935
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,249
left something back there.

936
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:38,191
And I was like,
"I feel like I'm going back to get it."

937
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:43,323
When I listened to the farmer
talking about the herd...

938
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:47,836
and how sometimes that something will happen
to one of the cattle but the herd goes on...

939
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,998
I just felt like I woke up.

940
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:54,373
I felt like I got
to reconnect with something.

941
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,562
A company loaned me
this solar panel for the project.

942
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:26,006
I can't change the way that electricity
is delivered to my house.

943
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,110
- You got it?
- Yeah.

944
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,112
The solar panel will provide
just enough electricity...

945
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,445
so that I can power my computer
and write my blog.

946
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,247
But what's really interesting
about this phase...

947
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,483
is that it's the first time
that I've realized...

948
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:45,220
that it's not about using as little
as we can possibly use...

949
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:50,664
but finding a way to get what I need
in a sustainable way.

950
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:55,568
And that's what we need to do
with my electricity, with the solar panel.

951
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,936
But that's also what we need to do
with our systems.

952
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,669
We just need to figure out
how to get people what they need...

953
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:02,802
in a way that doesn't harm the planet.

954
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,191
Tell that guy to get out of the bike lane.

955
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:24,523
Do you wanna know what I gave her
for her 40th birthday?

956
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,468
No birth control. You know what I'm saying?

957
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:31,666
We call it Russian Roulette.

958
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,733
Now the question is, is
it click-click or bang-bang?

959
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,746
If it's bang-bang, I die, she lives.

960
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,512
Watch out on your right for a lunatic.

961
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:51,993
My blog post today was about
opportunities in the crisis.

962
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:55,224
Imagine if we made the city nicer to live in.

963
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,790
So the two comments on the post so far are:

964
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,166
"Let's be realistic.”

965
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:04,570
You can't make
a city nice, so forget it.

966
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,904
There's such a lack of idealism.

967
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,843
But I think realism’s got us where we are.
You know what I'm saying?

968
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,538
That helps.

969
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,311
You okay, Michelle?

970
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,552
- Watch out, honey.
- I know. I know.

971
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,864
- It's so quiet.
- I know.

972
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:38,065
- That's Fort Tilden over there?
- Yeah.

973
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,605
Oh, my God. This is like the Hamptons.

974
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,045
- It's better than the Hamptons.
- 'Cause there's no one here.

975
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:54,412
Oh, my God. How radical is this?

976
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,426
And this is still New York City.
We're in New York City.

977
01:04:58,494 --> 01:04:59,927
Bug!

978
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,563
Will you go swimming with me?

979
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,799
To me, it's amazing how resilient nature is.

980
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,140
There's sandpipers on this beach,
and everybody's trying to survive.

981
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:20,478
And there's these sand crabs,
and they're in New York City.

982
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:23,245
- You see the two of ‘em?
- Yep, I see it.

983
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,412
Yep. I see.

984
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:31,890
People keep talking about,
"What's the hardest thing?"

985
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:34,054
"Are you depriving yourself?"

986
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,428
As though all these aspects
of the project are hard.

987
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,729
But it's not about deprivation.

988
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,202
It's not about not taking care of yourself.
It's the opposite.

989
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:47,402
It's about seeing is it possible
to have a good life...

990
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,103
without wasting so much.

991
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:59,749
Colin met this amazing woman at the
farmers’ market who loaned us her tricycle.

992
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,915
We can roll. It totally changed our life.

993
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:11,528
We have no TV, no lights,
no electricity, no air conditioning.

994
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,330
These were all the things
that kept us inside.

995
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:18,601
We're kind of forced
out of the apartment all the time now.

996
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:24,613
The days feel like they just last forever.

997
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:30,943
- What are those?
- They're fireflies.

998
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,011
They light.

999
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:47,627
- You playing gin rummy?
- Playing gin rummy.

1000
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,762
Now, I wanna show you something, okay?

1001
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:54,333
This is what you call "kicking Dad's ass."

1002
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:56,344
Okay?

1003
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:01,178
We're coming from vastly different spaces.

1004
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:06,552
No one is ever gonna be as naive-

1005
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:11,582
naively hopeful and naively optimistic
as we were in the late '60s.

1006
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,759
But I think there might
be something kind of similar...

1007
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,822
but more muted that's happening now.

1008
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,334
Not in the same way at all.

1009
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,598
But I feel like there's a certain...

1010
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,908
quiet beginning of a rebellion happening.

1011
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:36,244
The other thing is to point out
is this on the garlic.

1012
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:41,721
This is called a scape-S-C-A-P-E.

1013
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:45,659
I would suggest you take home
one or two of those.

1014
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,754
- Okay.
- These are the beans.

1015
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,800
You can see how they're
grabbing the pole.

1016
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,801
- And see this?
- Yeah.

1017
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,894
It's starting to make tomatoes.

1018
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:06,109
Are you overall optimistic about humankind,
or skeptical?

1019
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:10,619
I'm of the belief that it's always 50/50.

1020
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:11,710
Right.

1021
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:15,746
- That, in fact, some things are getting better.
- Right.

1022
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,816
Some things are getting worse.

1023
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,289
Yeah.

1024
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:26,096
Every time you try to do something right,
no matter what level you're on-

1025
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:31,003
- Right.
- there are unforeseen results.

1026
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,703
My hesitation about your work...

1027
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:38,269
is that it enables people
to fool themselves-

1028
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:41,407
that all they have to do
is change the light bulb-

1029
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,681
and recycle their plastic bag.

1030
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:49,986
Well, as long as they feel that way,
no politician will pick it up.

1031
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:55,554
And I feel that it's completely true,
that it's both.

1032
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,622
You need to have-

1033
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,691
I think that there's a tremendous-

1034
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,759
If you have a political stance...

1035
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:06,706
then there's a tremendous integrity to living
in a way that reflects that political stance.

1036
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:09,744
- At the risk of being too personal, but-
- Right.

1037
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,339
It's not. It's just the facts.

1038
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,975
- Michelle writes for Business Week.
- Yes.

1039
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:19,452
Millions of trees are cut down
on a regular basis...

1040
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:24,357
in order to promote the thoroughly
fallacious propaganda...

1041
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,793
that American corporate capitalism...

1042
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:31,560
is good for the people- good for you and me.

1043
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:35,263
Now, if it’s your contention...

1044
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:39,239
that she makes up for it, that evens out...

1045
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:43,608
because she doesn't take the elevator
in your Fifth Avenue co-op...

1046
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,080
I have to say you’re
either dishonest or delusional.

1047
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,218
There's definitely an irony...

1048
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,818
or a paradox involved in that, but-

1049
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,590
Where did all this crap come from?

1050
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:05,225
American corporate capitalism did all of it.

1051
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:07,997
If anybody really thought...

1052
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:11,631
that you were gonna have an impact there...

1053
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,540
you wouldn't be getting
the attention you're getting.

1054
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:26,621
And here's our No Impact Man, Colin Beavan
in the No Impact S.U.V.

1055
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:28,680
Wait a minute. I got to check this out.

1056
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,783
You may be on my show, but I'm not here
to spread your particular gospel.

1057
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,523
'Cause I think what you're doing
is extremely dangerous, okay?

1058
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,795
Oh, there we go. That's good.

1059
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:47,740
- Now I've got you all set up so I can see you.
- I can see a little bit.

1060
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,744
- A little bit.
- A little bit.

1061
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,474
I'm gonna hold something up
for you to see more.

1062
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,982
- It's disgusting.
- No, it's not.

1063
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,881
It looks like shit from here.

1064
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,284
Yeah, it is shit. It's worm shit.

1065
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:20,099
I think that my only connection
to food before the project was eating it.

1066
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,770
I really ate all my food
pretty much at restaurants...

1067
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,406
or out of take-out containers.

1068
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:29,110
I never cooked it. I never prepared it.

1069
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:30,583
I never thought about it.

1070
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:33,281
I never composted it.
I never thought about the waste.

1071
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,786
Now that I go to the farmers' market,
I know all the people who grow our food.

1072
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:42,763
I kind of have this little desire
to take it to the next level.

1073
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:47,796
I'm seeing today as just the first succession,
the first lesson.

1074
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,304
So we're gonna just make some-

1075
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,499
I'm just thinking
of a few things that we can make.

1076
01:11:52,574 --> 01:11:55,509
So start with the green beans.

1077
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,942
Just snap off just this end.

1078
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,879
- So snap off the kind of uglier end-this end.
- Exactly.

1079
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:03,782
See? Here are the dandelion greens.
I'm gonna just snip the ends off.

1080
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:06,548
- I'm just gonna cut off the end. Okay?
- Okay.

1081
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,081
- Great.
- Nicely done.

1082
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:20,224
Preheat it to 375, but honestly,
I might turn it up a little towards the end.

1083
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:22,736
I'm gonna make coffee, but I
know you don't want any, right?

1084
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:26,206
Oh, yeah. I'll have a little.
Yeah. I can have just a little bit.

1085
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,675
But there's a reason
why I can only have a little bit.

1086
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,837
I wonder if you guys can guess the reason.

1087
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:33,780
-Just have a little bit of coffee.
- Are you pregnant?

1088
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,840
Oh, my God. You are?

1089
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,587
- Oh, my God! That's so great!
- I know.

1090
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:42,988
Oh, my God.

1091
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:46,255
I'm so happy for you.

1092
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:50,563
- I wanna go out.
- Dad's gonna take you out, love.

1093
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,501
Dad's gonna take you out.

1094
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,594
I'm just gonna put them on.

1095
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,662
I love tomatoes.

1096
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:03,269
I'm making dinner tonight,
and I've actually never made dinner for us.

1097
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:06,439
Do you want me to show you
how to get that oven to get to 350 or 375?

1098
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,449
It's a little tricky.

1099
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,714
- Why don’t you just do the oven to 350, 375?
- Okay.

1100
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:15,245
Yep. Yep. Okay. That's a good trick.

1101
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:18,919
Okay, and then if you wanna be sure,
there's a thermometer down there.

1102
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,588
- Oh, that's nice.
- It tells you what the temperature of the oven is.

1103
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:26,293
- We really love our eggplant.
- We really love our egg.

1104
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:31,135
It might not work out,
but you have to learn and grow.

1105
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:33,868
Tonight, I'm just focused on trying to learn
how to roast the vegetables.

1106
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:35,705
Bye! Bye.

1107
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:39,439
I feel a little performance anxiety.

1108
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,946
I wonder if I should cut these off or-

1109
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:45,043
I feel really nauseous.

1110
01:13:55,631 --> 01:14:01,194
My whole life I've been looking for gurus
or this program or that thing or-

1111
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,398
I've always been kind of like looking
for something.

1112
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:09,103
I feel like we're looking for that thing together,
and we're kind of like finding some of it.

1113
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:15,312
I have to admit that there were times
when I was this asshole.

1114
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,352
I had a lot of moments.

1115
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:21,116
Now I think what he's doing is so cool.

1116
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:24,387
I get a big kick out of him.
I just think he's, like-

1117
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34,192
Not quite done yet.

1118
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:40,833
- Madame and monsieur.
- Oui.

1119
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:53,009
- More cheese on my bread, please.
- More cheese on your bread?

1120
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,763
Just the idea that you can park with
other things besides cars.

1121
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:14,332
The idea is, why are we dedicating this land
to cars instead of people?

1122
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:19,210
Could you imagine if this extended
all the way up to Seventh Avenue?

1123
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,716
We started the positive
impact stage of the project.

1124
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,548
The idea is no net environmental impact.

1125
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:29,990
So that's reduce our negative impact
and increase our positive impact.

1126
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,688
And it's not meant to be scientific.

1127
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:35,229
It's just meant to be philosophical.

1128
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:39,097
Can I live on this planet
doing more good than harm?

1129
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,230
I've been helping with a research project...

1130
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:47,674
to do with putting oysters back in the Hudson
River, which will filter the water.

1131
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:52,403
I went cleaning out tree pits in the Bronx.

1132
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:58,010
I was, like, "What a crock of shit
No Impact Man is as a project."

1133
01:15:58,086 --> 01:16:02,682
There's this network of people
who have been working on this stuffforever.

1134
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:05,750
Once you no longer live in the ignorance...

1135
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,796
that when you throw something away,
it actually goes away-

1136
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,855
It's just a really difficult thing...

1137
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:14,630
because, yes, your piece of trash comes
to a community like this where it's processed.

1138
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,434
Most people, as they consume...

1139
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:24,570
don't understand what the real costs
of those goods are.

1140
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,807
The pollution that was created to make it.

1141
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,248
The health effects
that were associated with it.

1142
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:32,412
We're the point sources
for all the greenhouse gases...

1143
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:35,251
that everybody's trying to curb right now.

1144
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,149
I think that we should
be spending more time...

1145
01:16:38,226 --> 01:16:42,424
recognizing that people's lives
are being compromised every single day...

1146
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,658
and have been for decades.

1147
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:54,770
1 2,000 trucks a day
go through that neighborhood.

1148
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:59,746
The diesel particulates in the air
are causing asthma in kids...

1149
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:02,147
causing brain damage in kids.

1150
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:06,176
When I started this project, I just thought
I was just gonna make less garbage...

1151
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:09,690
not travel so much,
and "wouldn't I be a hero" sort of thing.

1152
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,692
And I-

1153
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,354
I guess I wasn't so clear
on how many issues it was gonna open up.

1154
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,420
I'm not talking about the polar bears.

1155
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:19,194
I'm not talking about the people
in faraway island communities...

1156
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:21,929
who are gonna be hurt
when the ocean levels rise.

1157
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:25,906
I'm talking about people
who already are living with the effects...

1158
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,704
of our over-consumptive society.

1159
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,210
If you’d asked me nine months ago...

1160
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:40,550
would I ever have my baby be on a bike,
and I would say no.

1161
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:42,715
Absolutely not. That's insane.

1162
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:45,316
And I remember going off
on the bike messengers.

1163
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:48,090
"Those fucking bike messengers.
They're fucking insane."

1164
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:50,927
And "Anybody who would
ride a bike in New York is fucking insane."

1165
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:55,698
And "They're making it really unsafe-
the bikers- for us car people...

1166
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:59,502
Iike SUV renters, they're making it
really fucking unsafe for us."

1167
01:17:59,574 --> 01:18:01,565
And that's my world view.

1168
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:06,345
And now my world view
has completely flipped on its head.

1169
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:09,851
The streets have totally been taken over,
and they're not for people.

1170
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:14,654
And then the rapacious consumption
for consumption's sake...

1171
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,757
and the coma that that induces.

1172
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:28,931
I'm just rethinking everything
in terms of what’s important.

1173
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:32,872
Do you feel that moving forward...

1174
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,341
that you’ll somehow-

1175
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,777
You feel like there's some other way
of considering your decisions?

1176
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,042
Yeah. I mean-

1177
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:44,347
You know, well, now-

1178
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:47,911
What am I gonna do,
just say, "Well, I don't care"?

1179
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:24,482
Fixing it so that we get the most...

1180
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,918
sun that we can.

1181
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,690
A big question at the center
of the No Impact experiment...

1182
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,498
was whether one person can make a difference.

1183
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,574
One of the things
that I really get worried about...

1184
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:44,772
when people talk about the fact
that individual action is not important...

1185
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:48,907
is that the thing about individual action
is that it causes people to be engaged.

1186
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,786
Our society is not set up
to live sustainably.

1187
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:56,449
We need more mass transit,
higher-efficiency vehicles...

1188
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:59,255
no more coal-burning power plants.

1189
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,318
These are hard changes.

1190
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:04,790
The International Panel on Climate Change...

1191
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:09,428
says that we need an 80% cut
in carbon emissions by 2050.

1192
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,700
That's huge.

1193
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:16,376
As your constituent,
the first thing that I wanted to do...

1194
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,571
was I wanted to thank you
for sponsoring the energy bill, because-

1195
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,740
- You're welcome.
- that gives us a good-

1196
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,306
Good solid bill.

1197
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:26,218
Using less is a start, but it's not enough.

1198
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:30,691
We need to demand that our systems
become sustainable.

1199
01:20:34,763 --> 01:20:37,664
You can rock here. Let me rock you, okay?

1200
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:40,200
Do you wanna rock while you look at Frankie?

1201
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,236
We told Isabella...

1202
01:20:42,304 --> 01:20:46,468
we thought Michelle had a baby in her tummy,
but we were wrong.

1203
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:48,566
She didn't actually.

1204
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:52,101
I guess it was the second time
we went to the doctor.

1205
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,375
The first time we went to the doctor,
everything was fine.

1206
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,612
And then the second time
we went to the doctor-

1207
01:20:57,686 --> 01:21:00,382
- Well, it wasn't that every-
- there was no heartbeat.

1208
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:04,289
Yeah. The second-
There wasn't one. There was no heartbeat.

1209
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,154
Where are you going?

1210
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:22,267
From the perspective of the story, it would
have been the perfect ender of the story.

1211
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:27,714
I finally kind of cross over into No Impact...

1212
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:31,013
and really embrace it,
and that's what Colin really wanted.

1213
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:34,146
And then I got pregnant,
and that's what I would have really wanted.

1214
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:38,158
And then the project winds down.
It's all kind of in this really great bow.

1215
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,387
And it's not a bow.

1216
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:43,295
It's a big loose end.

1217
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,423
So it's a loose end.

1218
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:52,873
It's a narrative loose end
and a spiritual loose end.

1219
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:54,932
Just a loose end.

1220
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:58,036
A lot of loose ends in life.

1221
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:01,872
I think we’ll probably try again.

1222
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:06,610
They're like rainbows.

1223
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,679
Is that like rainbows on your feet?

1224
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,748
Rainbows on my feet.

1225
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:20,796
The official swan song of the garden
is when you turn the soil over in the fall.

1226
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:25,067
That's the official end of the season.

1227
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,609
It's kind of interesting,
because we're coming back...

1228
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:33,477
to the food that we were eating
when the project started...

1229
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:37,644
which is squash
and root vegetables and stuff like that.

1230
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:41,177
And, similarly, the garden is getting turned.

1231
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:44,350
So you actually-You kind of-

1232
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:48,692
It's not like you turn the calendar page,
and you can tell that a year has passed.

1233
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:51,459
You feel that a year has passed...

1234
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:55,299
because you’re recognizing
something about the Earth.

1235
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:01,374
We're so disconnected, I think, in the city
from the natural rhythms.

1236
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:05,743
I didn't know this before, but it's actually
a great pleasure to be connected.

1237
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:28,900
It's freezing in here.

1238
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:36,710
It's November 7,
and we're almost done, and I'm cold.

1239
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:38,837
So a lot of times what I do is I-

1240
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:41,279
See, I've just got home from work.
I'm wearing a suit.

1241
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:46,719
But I come in here,
and I get in the covers.

1242
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:51,316
I spend a lot of time
under the covers when it's cold.

1243
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:52,826
We don't talk about it ending.

1244
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:55,454
It's funny because we're gonna be
separated when it ends.

1245
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,761
Because when it ends, for me, I'm getting
on a plane to go see my parents...

1246
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,267
who I haven't seen in a year.

1247
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:04,328
And Colin will be here,
and I'm taking Isabella.

1248
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,897
So we- It's funny.

1249
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:11,969
We haven't really talked about it.

1250
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,880
But everybody on the outside
asks me about it.

1251
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:18,510
- Hello?
- What's up, sugar pop?

1252
01:24:18,586 --> 01:24:21,316
There's not any light in here.

1253
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:22,856
I can't see.

1254
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:25,893
I'm looking forward to reading
in bed with Isabella...

1255
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:29,452
with ample illumination.

1256
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,522
Ample illumination.

1257
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:38,529
You're not tired, are you?

1258
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:43,941
Next week,
there's this school thing happening at NYU.

1259
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:47,539
Something like 200 NYU students
are gonna try and live No Impact for a week.

1260
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,549
I think that's so cool.

1261
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:54,919
So on Sunday, I go, and we have kind
of a workshop about how to do it.

1262
01:24:54,989 --> 01:25:00,052
And then the following Monday,
I go and I give a big talk.

1263
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:08,525
Room 206.

1264
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:15,404
And this week, as you experiment, I think
you're gonna see that it's not so bad.

1265
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:17,672
My experiment only lasts two more weeks.

1266
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:21,579
As I come out of the extreme, some of this
stuff that we've given up, we'll take back.

1267
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,674
But that fact is
that the balance will be there.

1268
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:28,950
We are gonna be substantially
causing less environmental impact...

1269
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:33,289
and without adversely
affecting our happiness.

1270
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:38,025
The fact of the matter is that if only I change,
it's not gonna make a difference.

1271
01:25:38,099 --> 01:25:41,796
But the hope is that if each of us
as individuals change...

1272
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:45,033
it's going to inspire everybody to change.

1273
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:49,702
So I believe the most radical political act
there is, is to be an optimist.

1274
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:52,177
The most radical political act
there is, is to believe that if I change...

1275
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:54,181
other people will follow suit.

1276
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:59,277
The reason why I'm here
is because a first-grader called Olive...

1277
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:02,812
wrote to me on my blog
and asked me if I would come.

1278
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:06,657
People ask me, "If I can just do
one thing, what should it be?

1279
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:09,993
Not use plastic bags
or not use plastic cups?"

1280
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:13,865
I would say if there
was only one thing to do...

1281
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:16,904
it would be to volunteer
with an environmental organization.

1282
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:19,997
Part of the reason for that
is because there's community.

1283
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:24,704
I believe very strongly that a lot of the
environmental problems in our planet...

1284
01:26:24,779 --> 01:26:27,179
have come because
of the breakdown of community.

1285
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:30,740
Because without community,
none of us feel accountable to anybody else.

1286
01:26:30,818 --> 01:26:33,912
All of us are interconnected
on many levels.

1287
01:26:33,988 --> 01:26:37,754
If you’re religious, then you
understand that at a religious level.

1288
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:43,024
But even if you’re just practical,
you can see that we're interconnected.

1289
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:47,033
If I splash a puddle and you're
standing next to it, it splashes you.

1290
01:26:47,101 --> 01:26:51,265
If I make pollution,
you have to breathe it in.

1291
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:55,503
My mind wants to tell me that I'm
the only one that's important, you know?

1292
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:59,604
So I have to keep teaching myself over and
over and over again that that's not true.

1293
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:03,982
And then when you turn the light on,
are all the lights gonna go on?

1294
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,577
Most of them. I tried to set it up
so most of the lights come on.

1295
01:27:06,654 --> 01:27:08,645
As soon as you do that,
they're all gonna go on?

1296
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,850
No. I have to do a few flicks.

1297
01:27:10,925 --> 01:27:12,859
'Cause there's more than one circuit breaker.

1298
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:16,954
So you have to hit three circuit breakers,
and then they all will be on?

1299
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:20,558
- Yes.
- So we should light this. Okay.

1300
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:23,927
It's been-

1301
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:25,996
Well, it hasn't really been a year...

1302
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:29,168
because the electricity phase started
around month six.

1303
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,610
So it's been six months
since we've had electricity.

1304
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,978
So it's gratitude for small pleasures.

1305
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:53,056
There we go.

1306
01:28:02,644 --> 01:28:06,842
I have to say I was really skeptical
about a lot of things in the beginning.

1307
01:28:06,914 --> 01:28:08,848
And I thought they were insane
and really stupid.

1308
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:12,511
And I hated and resented you,
alternatively, for them.

1309
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:15,750
But I really, really wanna keep the biking.

1310
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:21,420
I wanna keep as much
as we possibly can the no garbage.

1311
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:24,693
And I really, really
wanna keep the farmers' market.

1312
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:30,863
I wanna be a vegetarian, but I wanna be-

1313
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:33,168
I wanna have a hot dog now and then.

1314
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:38,810
I would be a vege-
a "vegehogian" or a "vegedogian."

1315
01:28:43,885 --> 01:28:48,481
I'd like to not have TV in the house,
but I can't wait to go to the movies.

1316
01:28:48,556 --> 01:28:50,888
And when we're on vacation, that thing is on.

1317
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:54,718
- There are some things I have some issues with.
- Yeah?

1318
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:56,821
Why can't we take those worms back?

1319
01:28:56,898 --> 01:29:00,129
Because they do make
"Lord of the Fleas" in the kitchen.

1320
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:04,638
And also there are some things that we're
just not gonna be able to do maybe...

1321
01:29:04,706 --> 01:29:07,675
and that might be one of them.

1322
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:10,677
'Cause I get to make
some decisions around here.
