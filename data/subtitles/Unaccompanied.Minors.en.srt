1
00:00:37,653 --> 00:00:39,689
-Santa.
-The big man himself.

2
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,689
Now, Charlie, you're gonna be okay
this year, right?

3
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:44,922
Never been better, Dad.

4
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:47,207
Who do we have here?

5
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:48,842
You're up.

6
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:54,843
Santa. l can't believe it's really you.

7
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:01,053
lt's all right, everybody.
Happens every year.

8
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:16,446
-Okay, go. Prove it.
-Okay.

9
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:26,811
-Santa, my friends and l have a bet.
-About what?

10
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,445
l was right, you're hot!

11
00:01:29,613 --> 00:01:32,605
You guys owe me a soy half-caf
with a mocha shot!

12
00:01:32,973 --> 00:01:34,247
Can you get me a discount?

13
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:44,646
Mom, l'm 1 1 .

14
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,452
l'll look like a loser
getting my picture with Santa.

15
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:49,922
You'll look like someone
who's grounded if you don't.

16
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:52,084
Now go sit on Santa's lap. Go.

17
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:02,202
Hands off, fat boy!

18
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,723
l don't wanna see Santa!

19
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:15,212
Then let's just go, okay?

20
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:17,762
-l don't wanna go!
-Then get on Santa's lap.

21
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,651
l don't wanna!

22
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:23,202
Somebody's not being a very good girl.

23
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,365
l might have to put coal
in your stocking this year.

24
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:30,083
Nice work. Did they send you
to school for that?

25
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:32,323
Okay, look, Katherine.

26
00:02:32,493 --> 00:02:34,484
Nothing's gonna happen. See?

27
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:37,046
-Everything's okay.
-Oh, my God.

28
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:40,922
That dorky kid from the AV squad
is getting his picture taken with Santa.

29
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,883
Why do we have to spend Christmas
with Dad, anyway?

30
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:01,645
He's gonna be working
the whole time.

31
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:04,281
Honey, l know that
this is all hard on you. . .

32
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,603
. . .but you are
the man of the family now.

33
00:03:06,773 --> 00:03:09,526
Your sister is counting on you
to make this a good Christmas.

34
00:03:09,693 --> 00:03:12,002
Honey, please, just take care of her.

35
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:13,652
Oh, excuse me?

36
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:17,772
My children are traveling without me
and they told me that l should--

37
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:21,209
l got two unaccompanied minors!

38
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:24,566
Welcome to the friendly skies,
underage travelers.

39
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,611
Hey, look what we have here.
The wings. And wings for you.

40
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,241
All right, let's go experience
the wonders of flight.

41
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:34,247
While we're young. Yes.
We have to walk. There you go.

42
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,085
lt's happening.

43
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,721
-l love you, Katie.
-l love you, Mom.

44
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:40,008
l love you, Spencer.

45
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:43,004
Please focus.

46
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,771
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Hoover International Airport.

47
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,971
-How come we're not in Pennsylvania?
-We have to change planes.

48
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,522
But l liked our plane.

49
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,566
Hey. So you guys
are the Davenports, right?

50
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:11,322
All right. My name is Zach and l'll be
taking care of you during your layover.

51
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:12,642
And give me five!

52
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,972
Follow me this way. Man.

53
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,764
Where are all the Christmas decorations?

54
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,049
Well, our boss
doesn't really like Christmas. . .

55
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:26,124
. . .so he locked
all the decorations away.

56
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:31,003
But he did let us put up a few things.
For example, you see that over there?

57
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:35,166
That green thing is a Christmas tree,
and those red thingies are holly.

58
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,732
lt doesn't feel like Christmas.

59
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:40,488
Yeah, l kind of agree with you.
But that's the way Mr. Porter wanted it.

60
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:43,372
-Who's Mr. Porter?
-He's the head of Passenger Relations.

61
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,445
And between you and me,
l don't really think he likes passengers. . .

62
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:48,171
. . .or holidays, really.

63
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,527
He sounds mean.

64
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:52,253
Yeah. lt really depends
on what mood he's in.

65
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:54,927
Smell the air, Hoffman.
Do you know what that is?

66
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,129
Cinnabons, Mr. Porter?

67
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:00,808
Freedom. lt's my first Christmas off
in 1 5 years.

68
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,487
Just me, a Hawaiian resort. . .

69
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:06,531
. . .and no complaining passengers
to deal with.

70
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:08,331
You know who will be complaining now?

71
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:10,324
Me. l'll be complaining about everything.

72
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:13,132
And they'll just have to stand there
and listen to me. . .

73
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,602
. . .because it's their job, not mine.

74
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,333
-Sounds like fun, sir.
-Oh, it's more than fun.

75
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:20,609
lt's my vacation.

76
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:23,209
Well, aloha, suckers.

77
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:27,290
Aloha. All flights to Hawaii
have been canceled due to heavy snow.

78
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,728
We apologize for any inconvenience.

79
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:40,290
And Merry Christmas to me.

80
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:46,607
-Twenty inches of snow have fallen--
-This is easily the storm of the--

81
00:05:46,773 --> 00:05:49,207
-Worst blizzard we've--
-Ten foot drifts have been--

82
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:51,841
After Christmas, head
to Hoover International Airport...

83
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:54,891
...for the first-ever unclaimed
baggage warehouse sale.

84
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,931
You never know what you might find.
Clothes, toys, electronics.

85
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:00,687
If someone's lost it, you can buy it.
Also don 't forget--

86
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:02,844
Oh, no. Did you bite your tongue again?

87
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,447
When l wrote Santa,
l forgot to tell him. . .

88
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:09,891
. . .that we were gonna be at Dad's house
all the way in Pennsylvania.

89
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:11,805
How is he gonna find us now?

90
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:14,123
Oh, you mean that Santa guy
that you're scared of?

91
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:16,443
Him? l mean, he's not even gonn--

92
00:06:19,893 --> 00:06:22,726
He'll find you. The tooth fairy
gave him directions.

93
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,246
She works with NORAD.

94
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:29,208
Spencer, NORAD says that Santa's
gonna be at this airport at 4:29.

95
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,646
So that means if we lived here. . .

96
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,327
. . .Santa would bring me
my new doll at 4:30.

97
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:39,362
Guys. We have a problem.

98
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,764
Attention, passengers. All flights
out of Hoover International Airport...

99
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,811
...have been suspended
due to blizzard conditions.

100
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,204
The weather service is forecasting
extremely heavy snow and high winds...

101
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,364
...until tomorrow morning--

102
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,846
My wife's gonna kill me, man.
l gotta get out of here.

103
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,605
We apologize for any inconvenience.

104
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,086
Where are we going?

105
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:06,403
Somewhere really fun.

106
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:09,367
Are we going to prison?

107
00:07:09,533 --> 00:07:13,128
No. We're gonna have fun with all the
other kids who are flying by themselves.

108
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:16,683
Welcome to the
Unaccompanied Minors Room.

109
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:35,851
Oh, man.
lt's like Lord of the Flies in here.

110
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:37,652
Help us!

111
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:40,566
Zach, we're flight attendants,
not riot police.

112
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:42,724
You've got to find someone else
to take over.

113
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,282
You guys, there is no one else.
The storm is huge.

114
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:48,331
Think of it like being in the air
with a normal passenger load. . .

115
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,963
. . .and secure all exits and discourage
anybody from going to the restroom.

116
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,930
-Oh, come on, you guys.
-Have fun, Zach!

117
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:58,210
Where's your Christmas spirit?
l mean, look at them, they're so cute.

118
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,963
l don't think Santa's
gonna find us in here.

119
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:17,491
l think l bought defective M&M's.
You know, some of these are W's.

120
00:08:17,653 --> 00:08:20,611
Oh, come on, Val, lighten up, you know?
lt's Christm--

121
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:23,241
l know you're worried about the kids.
They're fine.

122
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:26,086
lt's Christmas Eve.
We're gonna do more decorating--

123
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:29,290
No. No. Judy, you don't have
any more decorating to do.

124
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:32,286
l have to finish. l have six more boxes
of lights in the garage.

125
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:35,365
-This is creepy.
-You're just poisonous, aren't you?

126
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:37,365
Thanks for being such a great sister.

127
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,127
The Weather Service is calling it
the Storm of the Century.

128
00:08:40,293 --> 00:08:43,365
It's the biggest blizzard to hit
the middle of the country in decades.

129
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,807
We're talking nasty.

130
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:47,965
It's already grounded all flights
in and out of the Midwest....

131
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:49,327
Oh, no! The kids!

132
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:53,451
Can we change planes now?

133
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,445
Okay, yeah, l can do this. All right.

134
00:08:57,613 --> 00:09:00,889
-Kids love me. l'm all right. l'm good.
-Excuse me, sir?

135
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:03,931
Didn't l tell you this was fun?
Look how many kids are here.

136
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,168
Get us out of here.

137
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,722
Why would you wanna do that?
lt's great down here.

138
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:12,090
Look, watch this. Hey, can l get
you guys' attention, please?

139
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,527
Okay.

140
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:16,651
All right, accidents happen.
All right, that one was full!

141
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,572
Straw in the eye.
Straw in the eye.

142
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:24,047
Santa's watching!
He's not very happy about this!

143
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:27,285
-He's not going to come to your house!
-Amateurs.

144
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:31,490
-l bet he's psycho.
-l heard he tore a kid in half once.

145
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,690
-Go poke him.
-No, you go poke him.

146
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,168
We could call Mom.

147
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:52,251
Yeah, well, she wouldn't drive
2000 miles to pick us up.

148
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:53,448
Then let's call Dad.

149
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,604
Yeah, he wouldn't drive
four feet to get us.

150
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,003
Pardon me, do your parents
happen to be divorced?

151
00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:00,004
-What?
-l'm Charlie Goldfinch.

152
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:02,733
l'm conducting a poll
about flying solo this time of year.

153
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,043
Being divorced is number one.
Being Jewish. . .

154
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:07,124
. . .and visiting your grandparents
is second.

155
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:09,648
And then there are the rich kids.

156
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:12,964
But they're not statistically significant.

157
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:16,330
-Oh, burn.
-Good times, you guys. All right.

158
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:20,801
Okay.

159
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:27,366
Her name's Grace Conrad.
l admire your taste.

160
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:31,048
She's out of your league, but if
you talk to her, l'll admire your pluck.

161
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,444
So, what about you two?
Divorce or Judaism?

162
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:37,326
-lt's really none of your business.
-Divorced? Me too.

163
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:41,128
Polls are a great way to learn about
your fellow man. Thanks for your time.

164
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:43,932
This place is weird.

165
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:48,247
Could be worse.

166
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:52,645
Okay, Simon says flush your cell phone.

167
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:56,571
ls this bathroom out of order?

168
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:59,252
No.

169
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:04,967
Must escape the sound of running water.

170
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:09,249
Read them and weep, boys.

171
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:14,051
Texas Hold 'Em. Excellent game.

172
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:16,249
-What, you play?
-Only all the time.

173
00:11:16,453 --> 00:11:17,442
No, you don't.

174
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:20,002
Yeah, l do. She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

175
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:23,688
l play all the time and l win.
We think she's adopted.

176
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:25,206
You're adopted, underpants!

177
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,286
-Underpants.
-Nice jacket. Abercrombie?

178
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,365
Please. lt's Dior.
Why? ls yours from A & F?

179
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:33,330
Our mom bought it for him at Kmart.

180
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:40,002
Yeah. l gotta take her to get some food.
Her blood sugar's low, right?

181
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,892
No! l wanna watch them play cards,
noodle-head!

182
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,085
Yeah. Let her watch, noodle-head.

183
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:48,807
See you, Kmart.

184
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:50,367
Deal me in.

185
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:56,085
You want your dolly back, you big baby?
You're gonna cry, huh?

186
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:58,721
Hey, guys, check this out.

187
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:03,483
lt's borderline urgent now, sir.

188
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:07,089
l cannot let you leave the room. Why
don't you wait for maintenance to fix it?

189
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:08,925
No, no, no.

190
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:14,171
Juice box in my back. l am laying
on a juice box.

191
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:18,645
Sometimes l see my brother kissing
his hand in his bedroom like this.

192
00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:21,407
Awkward.

193
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:25,771
Did the door just open? l know the door
just opened. l can feel fresh air.

194
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:27,810
-l know someone's walking out.
-Morons.

195
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,726
-Okay, who farted?
-You can't leave without an attendant.

196
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,645
-Where are you going?
-Out.

197
00:12:36,013 --> 00:12:39,130
This goes against everything
l believe in, but l gotta pee!

198
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,568
Wait, who's going to pee?

199
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:44,122
Hey, keep the door closed!
Who's walking out?

200
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:45,728
You better keep that--

201
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,571
Oh, no.

202
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,610
Oh, you worry me, honey.
You worry me.

203
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,122
l gotta call Sam.

204
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,968
Val, please. Why don't you relax?
l know exactly what you need.

205
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,523
A nice steaming cup
of my wonderful hot chocolate.

206
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:08,049
l've had three already.
And it's 80 degrees outside!

207
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:10,010
Are you trying to kill me?

208
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:12,767
Well, no.

209
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,845
Judy, my children are trapped
in an airport on Christmas Eve.

210
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:18,243
Do you have any idea
how miserable they must be?

211
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:23,171
Finally.

212
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,765
Where's that kid who had to pee?

213
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:32,366
-Sam Davenport. Clean Earth Society.
-Hi, Sam, it's Val.

214
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:35,286
Hey, Val. l'm heading to the airport
now to pick up the kids.

215
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:37,125
-You're not gonna be able to.
-What?

216
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,807
-They're not gonna be able to fly in!
-Val, calm down.

217
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,884
-There's a blizzard--
-lt's not snowing out.

218
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,532
Yes, it is.

219
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,006
-Sure their flight's canceled?
-Would Al Roker make that up?

220
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:49,243
No, no. l guess Al Roker wouldn't lie.

221
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,485
I'm gonna drive all night to get them.
And don 't make that face.

222
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:01,528
l would like a table for one
in the no-little-sisters section, please.

223
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:03,923
Aren't you a little young
to be flying by yourself?

224
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,287
Not at all.

225
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,684
No. No kids' menu.

226
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,485
No, no, no. No crayons either.

227
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,289
Welcome to the High Flyer's Club,
Miss Conrad.

228
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,205
Thank you.

229
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,007
Gadgets.

230
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,684
Bingo.

231
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:46,810
Yes.

232
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,362
Cheese. Condiments.

233
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,451
Caviar.

234
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:57,052
Nachos. My mom
never lets me eat those.

235
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,402
So an order of those.

236
00:14:58,573 --> 00:15:02,088
She's banned all sodas from the house,
so extra-, extra-, extra-large root beer.

237
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,483
My mom never let me eat
mozzarella sticks.

238
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,883
Mine either. Two orders. On to dessert.

239
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:08,645
You don't have a tapeworm, do you?

240
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,524
Oh, yeah.

241
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:16,726
Travel is so exhausting,
don't you think, girls?

242
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,361
Left, left. Yes.

243
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,206
How you doing?

244
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:31,131
Take it, backup singers!

245
00:16:35,813 --> 00:16:38,043
Sweet Jehoshaphat.

246
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:39,202
He did it.

247
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,926
Freeze!

248
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,729
Freeze! Hey!

249
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:48,849
Excuse me, are you unaccompanied?

250
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,203
l'm single. Who's asking?

251
00:16:51,853 --> 00:16:53,764
They are.

252
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:58,171
Are you gonna let me get dressed,
or should l just walk out of here naked?

253
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,363
Okay, airport food's that much, huh?

254
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:15,405
-l am so gonna kill you.
-lt was good service.

255
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:18,043
lt seemed like he would--

256
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,925
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

257
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:24,402
He didn't even eat the mozzarella sticks.

258
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:27,362
-Eat my dust!
-Stop it, kid.

259
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,046
Look out!

260
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:31,167
Get her!

261
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,483
Coming through!

262
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:39,845
Security Five, I have
an unattended vehicle outside here.

263
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:48,006
Hi, officer.

264
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:50,129
l think you're doing a great job.

265
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:52,488
-Both of you.
-Hey, kid, hop in!

266
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:54,928
l don't normally do this, officers. Sorry!

267
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,962
Hey, bro. Hi, Mom, Dad.

268
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:13,365
You guys, this vacation was awesome.
l just wanna thank you.

269
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:18,567
-Grace?
-There they are!

270
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,883
-You. Wait for me!
-Stop!

271
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,450
Man, Harvard's never gonna accept me
with a police record.

272
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,365
And l'm not going to
community college.

273
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,125
Charlie?

274
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:30,727
What are you guys doing?
That's an official--

275
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,372
-Get them!
-Let's go!

276
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:35,847
l've always wanted to do this. Go!

277
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,931
Charlie, you might
wanna get on the cart.

278
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,166
Oh, this is a bad idea!

279
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:51,683
Nicely done.

280
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:53,923
When did you get here?

281
00:19:05,413 --> 00:19:08,246
l get the feeling we are going
to be in huge trouble.

282
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:11,445
Not with me behind the wheel. Hang on!

283
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:18,565
Right turn!

284
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,612
Well, that was fun.

285
00:19:33,053 --> 00:19:34,327
Welcome home.

286
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,404
Where are my friends?

287
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:39,531
Oh, man. Where's my sister?

288
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:44,244
They went where all the good little boys
and girls go for Christmas.

289
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:47,686
They went somewhere nice.

290
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:49,970
Where, you ask?

291
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:53,808
Why, the comfortable and festive. . .

292
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,726
. . .Hoover lnternational Lodge.

293
00:19:56,893 --> 00:20:02,411
Which is just a few thousand yards
down from this delightful little room.

294
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:06,522
Which now smells like a horse died in it.

295
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,530
Oh, so we're going to the lodge?

296
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,971
l think l have an answer
to your question.

297
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,966
Are you out of
your juice-drinking little minds?

298
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,811
Have you looked outside lately?

299
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:23,363
The roads are blocked
because there is a little thing. . .

300
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,205
. . .called a blizzard going on.

301
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:29,525
That's when the sky opens up
and lots of snow falls. . .

302
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:32,332
. . .and makes it hard for people
to do things.

303
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,850
Like fly to Hawaii, for instance.

304
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,891
Who's going to Hawaii?

305
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,805
Not me.

306
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,404
Not anymore.

307
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:45,724
Sir, l gotta get down to my sister.
She's gonna be freaked without me.

308
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,685
Will she be freaked?

309
00:20:47,853 --> 00:20:51,368
l'm betting she's gonna be stoked
that people are taking care of her. . .

310
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,923
. . .and she doesn't have to wait around
for her brother, who abandoned her.

311
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,601
So where are we staying?

312
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,968
What's wrong with right here?

313
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,851
lt smells like a horse died in it.

314
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:03,731
That's exactly the kind of place. . .

315
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:07,522
. . .l thought a bunch of
juvenile delinquents would love to stay.

316
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,251
Watch it, Dr. Evil.

317
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,210
Oh, no, did l offend you?

318
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,568
Well, l don't know what else
to call someone. . .

319
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:16,531
. . .who commits grand theft auto,
reckless driving. . .

320
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,129
. . .and destruction of property
all in the course of 1 0 minutes.

321
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:22,682
Someone cooler than you'll ever be.

322
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,366
That's fantastic.

323
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:29,172
l didn't know we had
Ellen DeGeneres in the house.

324
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,810
And what about a young man. . .

325
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:34,646
. . .who orders the heart-attack special
and can't pay for it?

326
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:40,163
Or a girl who exfoliates herself
all over the airport lounge?

327
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:44,729
Then, the abominable snowman. . .

328
00:21:44,893 --> 00:21:47,168
. . .who transforms
the Emergency Equipment Center. . .

329
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:51,525
. . .into his own private amusement park
and then blames it on Aquaman?

330
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:54,412
Aren't you a little too old
to be playing with dolls?

331
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:56,644
l mean, what are you, like 40?

332
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:59,812
Actually, Beef is 1 2, sir.

333
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:02,569
Good Lord.

334
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:07,363
And Charlie Goldfinch. . .

335
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:10,892
. . .my most frequent underage flyer.

336
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:14,122
And formerly model passenger.

337
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,449
Karaoke, son?

338
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,571
Was it worth it?

339
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,885
l had a song in my heart.

340
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,603
Oh, my gosh, l'm a juvie.

341
00:22:26,573 --> 00:22:30,532
l think you can all see that l have
a very compelling case. . .

342
00:22:30,693 --> 00:22:36,165
. . .to keep you here in the U.M.
on Christmas Eve.

343
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:40,282
But who's gonna take care of them?

344
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:43,645
You are, Van Bourke.

345
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:46,407
And unless you enjoy unemployment. . .

346
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,725
. . .you'll make sure they don't
get out of this room again.

347
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:04,088
The phone lines at the airport
are still down.

348
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:07,086
Just call Spencer's cell phone.
Why don't you do that?

349
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,767
Sam talked me out of getting him one.

350
00:23:09,933 --> 00:23:13,687
He said millions of them
were polluting landfills already.

351
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:16,048
He's never gonna make it
from Pennsylvania.

352
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:18,727
There's just no way.
He doesn't even have a real car!

353
00:23:19,533 --> 00:23:21,524
You married a guy with a vegetable car.

354
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:28,002
This is good. This is good!
Me and you on the roads. Two guys.

355
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,882
l don't imagine there are gonna be many
biodiesel depots open Christmas Eve. . .

356
00:23:32,053 --> 00:23:37,207
. . .so l packed you a little holiday meal.
l hope you like vegetarian.

357
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:42,565
l hope you like vegetarian.

358
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:48,967
Katherine can't have Christmas morning
without Santa Claus.

359
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:51,442
Let's go.

360
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,692
Road trip!

361
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:13,446
l got the last rooms. We'll have to pack
the sky brats in like sardines.

362
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:16,571
l wanna go home. l don't wanna
get packed in like a sardine.

363
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,564
Santa's never gonna find me here.

364
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:22,407
l didn't understand a word of that.

365
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:25,402
So, little girl. . .

366
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:28,610
. . .how would you like to stay
with Mary Lynn and me?

367
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:30,526
Who's Mary Lynn?

368
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:34,728
Only the world's sweetest
sweetie pie, that's who.

369
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:42,047
Hi. l'm Mary Lynn. We're gonna
have loads of fun together.

370
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:47,082
Okay. You listen, and you listen good.

371
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:50,484
l've never had a little sister,
so you're gonna be my test run.

372
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,008
l am going to braid your hair, little girl.

373
00:24:53,173 --> 00:24:56,449
And even if you try to say no,
you'll face the consequences.

374
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:59,002
Get it? Got it? Good!

375
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:04,805
So there is some good news.

376
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:08,443
Your cots are ready.

377
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:12,484
Yeah, l'll be right back.

378
00:25:17,973 --> 00:25:20,441
This is so not the Christmas
l had in mind.

379
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:22,331
Oh, poor baby.

380
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:25,007
l bet you have nice Christmases,
don't you, rich kid?

381
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:29,645
Where does your family go?
Paris? London? Fiji?

382
00:25:29,813 --> 00:25:33,601
Please. Fiji's a zoo this time of year.
We go skiing in Utah.

383
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,206
Are your folks still together?

384
00:25:35,853 --> 00:25:37,002
Yeah.

385
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:39,733
-Then l hate you.
-l'm not wild about you either.

386
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:44,171
Well, l love Christmas.
And l'm Jewish.

387
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,161
My mom's boyfriend says. . .

388
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:50,008
. . .that Christmas is when
Frosty the Snowman fights the devil.

389
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,211
lt talks.

390
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,442
-l'm getting out of here.
-What are you talking about?

391
00:25:57,613 --> 00:26:00,081
l need to get to my sister
down at the hotel.

392
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:02,813
She's expecting Santa's sleigh
to get there at 4:30 a.m. . .

393
00:26:02,973 --> 00:26:06,363
. . .and if l don't get down there,
she's gonna think Santa forgot her.

394
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:08,763
And l can't let that happen.
So who's with me?

395
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:11,531
How would you get us out of here?

396
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:14,648
l got an idea.

397
00:26:18,173 --> 00:26:21,722
-This is not gonna work.
-This is so junior high.

398
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:23,645
l know. lt's cool, isn't it?

399
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:27,203
Attention, Zach Van Bourke.
Please report to the Information Desk.

400
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:30,251
You're wanted at the Information Desk.

401
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:39,050
All right, guys. Well, l'll be right back.

402
00:26:39,213 --> 00:26:42,569
You guys stay. Please.

403
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,808
Great plan, Kmart.
Really thought that one out.

404
00:27:00,293 --> 00:27:01,885
That was only part of the plan.

405
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,206
Hey.

406
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,686
Hey.

407
00:27:11,893 --> 00:27:13,292
l'm here.

408
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,925
Yeah.

409
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:23,925
You know what?
lt's been really cool hanging out.

410
00:27:24,093 --> 00:27:25,685
But l'm gonna go back to the book.

411
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:28,084
l'm Zach Van Bourke. You paged me?

412
00:27:29,373 --> 00:27:32,012
Yeah. You got a phone message
from some kids.

413
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:36,007
-l do?
-Yeah. They said:

414
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:41,445
''Goodbye. ''

415
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:48,244
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no!

416
00:27:57,053 --> 00:28:00,125
You're right.
That was so junior high.

417
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:03,565
Operation Save Christmas is a go.

418
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:08,525
Looking good, baby, looking good!

419
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:12,003
Who needs four-wheel drive
when you've got the power of clean?

420
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:17,171
Hey! Get out of the way, grandma!

421
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:21,688
Fossil-fuel junkie.

422
00:28:21,853 --> 00:28:23,491
Gasoholic.

423
00:28:23,653 --> 00:28:25,723
Enjoy the hangover!

424
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:35,890
l wonder where the fire is.

425
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:46,525
Doesn't she look just darling?

426
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,087
Excuse me, lady.

427
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:52,129
l need to be at-- l need to get it--

428
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:55,962
l need to be at a chimney at 4:30
because l need to meet Santa.

429
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:59,046
Girls?
The pilots are down in the restaurant. . .

430
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:00,851
. . .and they wanna buy us dinner.

431
00:29:01,013 --> 00:29:04,972
Captain Cohen's down there.
Never too late for a fifth husband.

432
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:06,202
Let's go, girls!

433
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:08,731
The kids.

434
00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:14,608
Don't worry, ma'am, l'm a certified
babysitter. l get paid 50 cents an hour.

435
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:18,682
Mary Lynn, there's a 20 in this for you.

436
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,413
Captain Cohen, here l come.

437
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:25,648
Oh, no, you don't.

438
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:28,008
You are not going anywhere. . .

439
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:32,530
. . .because l am going to give you
a makeover.

440
00:29:32,693 --> 00:29:35,526
An extreme makeover.

441
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:39,572
They're children.

442
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:42,531
Don't tell me you can't find them.
They're little tiny people.

443
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,251
Get back.

444
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,049
Do you know what the word
''security'' means?

445
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:49,010
From the Latin, securitas?

446
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:52,324
As in ''secure the building
from children running amuck. ''

447
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:53,926
Mr. Porter. . .

448
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,961
. . .as long as the kids are in the airport,
they're safe.

449
00:29:57,133 --> 00:30:00,011
lf you chase them,
it's just gonna make things worse.

450
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,970
Oh, yeah. That's right, Van Bourke.

451
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,489
That would be much more tragic
than me getting fired.

452
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:07,609
Now, you help me find those kids. . .

453
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,082
. . .or l'm gonna lock you
in the U.M. Room all night.

454
00:30:10,253 --> 00:30:11,527
How do you like them apples?

455
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,251
Oh, my gosh, we're fugitives.

456
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:14,766
Shut up.

457
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:19,885
What, they call the National Guard?

458
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:22,408
lf you get me sent back to that room,
you're dead.

459
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:25,406
What are you gonna do, rich girl?
Have your daddy hire a hit man?

460
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:28,326
Maybe l'll just have him
break your dad out of jail.

461
00:30:31,493 --> 00:30:34,769
Girl fight. Girl fight.
Oh, my gosh, it's a girl fight.

462
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,005
No, no, no. Don't, don't, don't.
Please, no, no, no.

463
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:43,204
l saw this on cable once
but then my dad blocked the channel.

464
00:30:45,453 --> 00:30:47,250
'Tis the season to be j--

465
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,051
That's gonna hurt when l pee.

466
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:53,243
Oh, my gosh. Kid, are you okay?

467
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,525
l'm fine.

468
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:59,369
Look, l'm really sorry.
l just don't like being touched, okay?

469
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:02,088
Got it. Won't happen again.

470
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:03,242
You know what, guys?

471
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:07,247
lf we are ever gonna get down
to that hotel, we have to be a team.

472
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:10,564
You know, we have to think like a team.

473
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:12,963
We have to act like a team,
talk like a team.

474
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:16,330
We have to walk like a team,
fight like a team and be like a team. . .

475
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:19,530
. . .because we are the U.M. Team.

476
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:29,761
Yeah. What do we do first?

477
00:31:33,053 --> 00:31:35,692
l'll get your sister a Christmas tree.

478
00:31:43,773 --> 00:31:45,684
We're never gonna see him again,
are we?

479
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:49,050
-Probably not.
-Okay, if l may interject.

480
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:51,050
lf we wanna get out of this airport. . .

481
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:54,649
. . .our best bet would be the lower level,
northeast corner. . .

482
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:58,044
. . .behind the baggage claim.
Security's thin at this time of night.

483
00:31:58,213 --> 00:31:59,532
And how do you know that?

484
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:03,051
l fly out of Hoover lnternational
every week.

485
00:32:11,773 --> 00:32:16,005
There.
Now it's time to brush your teeth.

486
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:18,243
-l'm not a doll, Mary Lynn.
-No.

487
00:32:18,413 --> 00:32:20,563
You're way better. You can talk.

488
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:23,611
And l don't even
have to pull a stupid string.

489
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:26,892
Now open up.

490
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:29,123
But, Mary Lynn,
l already brushed my teeth.

491
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,609
Did you tell the kids
l was coming to get them?

492
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:34,525
-No.
-Why not?

493
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:37,605
Because Spencer doesn't
have a cell phone, remember?

494
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:39,843
l didn't want the kids
getting their hopes up. . .

495
00:32:40,013 --> 00:32:41,844
. . .in case your car
doesn't make it there.

496
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:43,850
Hey, the biomobile rocks, okay?

497
00:32:44,013 --> 00:32:45,765
l have enough fuel in the back seat. . .

498
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,003
. . .to get me to Florida and back
if l wanted to.

499
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:51,449
Well, I hope you're not talking
on one of those roadside pay phones.

500
00:32:51,893 --> 00:32:55,408
l read that all kinds of freak accidents
happen there by the shoulder.

501
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,165
Wait, wait. Honey.

502
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:00,006
You have to stop reading
those dumb tabloids, okay?

503
00:33:00,173 --> 00:33:02,733
You know they make those stories up.

504
00:33:16,813 --> 00:33:18,405
Oh, boy.

505
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:22,805
Zooey, you gotta toughen this kid up.

506
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:25,771
Oh, Ernie. Beef's only 1 2.

507
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,970
Twelve. Exactly.
He still plays with a doll.

508
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:33,092
Have you seen the kids that pick on him?
He should be eating them for breakfast.

509
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:35,369
lt's your ex-husband's fault.

510
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:39,448
Ninny. lf it was up to me, l'd drop
this kid in the middle of the woods. . .

511
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:41,843
. . .give him a knife
and a book of matches.

512
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:44,732
Let him find his way home,
the way my old man did it to me.

513
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:47,652
Men are made, not born.

514
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:49,246
Merry Christmas.

515
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,922
Take me with you, Santa.

516
00:33:56,453 --> 00:34:00,605
Aquaman, men are made, not born.

517
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:10,726
-My deal.
-Mr. Yakamora.

518
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:13,407
Hey, it's a dog. Are you hungry?

519
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:16,963
Okay. So the exit we're looking for
is right behind that door.

520
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:19,363
We need a distraction
to get them away from there.

521
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:22,411
No Christmas dinner for you, Cujo.

522
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:26,769
-Yeah, keep barking, right.
-l think we found it.

523
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:34,763
Okay, kids.

524
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:37,527
Let's follow your crumbs.

525
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:42,329
-lt's almost gone.
-Forget the dog. Come on, keep dealing.

526
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:44,245
We only got a half-hour for lunch.

527
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:52,332
So this guy gives me his bag.
lt was so heavy. . . .

528
00:35:01,053 --> 00:35:03,203
Hey, man. Why don't you share
your lunch with him?

529
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:06,683
Okay, doggie.
You can have the last piece.

530
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:08,252
Not.

531
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,085
Not gonna get it.

532
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:33,452
Oh, man.

533
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:39,924
-Van Bourke, get after that dog.
-What?

534
00:35:40,093 --> 00:35:41,367
-The dog.
-Okay.

535
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:42,886
That's him, guys. Hide.

536
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,613
-What the hell is going on here?
-The dog got out.

537
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:47,286
-How?
-We don't know.

538
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,768
Trapped like rats.

539
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:06,412
No. Zip.

540
00:36:06,573 --> 00:36:08,723
Hello?

541
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:12,369
Anybody in here?

542
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:14,610
Oh, candy.

543
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,924
Anybody under 6 feet tall?

544
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:22,247
Anybody who isn't
traveling with an adult?

545
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:30,008
Olly olly oxen free?

546
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:36,968
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

547
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:39,411
Hello?

548
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,205
Sir? Hi.

549
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,603
Yeah, that dog just took a dump
in the promenade. . .

550
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:52,651
-. . .and its owner wants to talk to you.
-The nightmare has begun.

551
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:55,129
Search this room from top to bottom. . .

552
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,808
. . .and let me know the minute you find
anybody. Van Bourke, come with me.

553
00:36:59,773 --> 00:37:01,491
Mr. Porter.

554
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:06,885
-What is this doing here?
-Unclaimed.

555
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:08,611
Well, get it back to the warehouse.

556
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:11,763
Do l have to do everything around here?

557
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:21,532
My candy.

558
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:24,644
Oh, gosh.

559
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:27,085
-Let's go get some coffee.
-Let's go.

560
00:37:31,773 --> 00:37:33,604
-What's the matter?
-Charlie is in there.

561
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:36,162
-What?
-Turn it off.

562
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:39,088
There's no key. Charlie!

563
00:37:40,173 --> 00:37:41,731
Why, hello.

564
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,443
-Donna, what are you doing?
-Come back!

565
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:45,887
l gotta save him!

566
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:49,927
lt's not so bad in here. Oh, no!

567
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,526
Charli--

568
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,648
-Help!
-Donna!

569
00:37:57,853 --> 00:37:59,525
l hope this is going someplace nice.

570
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:02,567
Charlie!

571
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,971
You follow her, okay? l'll take him.

572
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,407
-Got it.
-Good.

573
00:38:15,373 --> 00:38:17,568
l should have gone to the bathroom.

574
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:18,961
Help me!

575
00:38:20,493 --> 00:38:22,404
You've gotta be kidding me.

576
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:35,810
Well, that doesn't sound good.

577
00:38:46,853 --> 00:38:48,002
Oh, that's gotta hurt.

578
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:49,401
That hurt.

579
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:55,449
-Charlie.
-Donna, is that you?

580
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:57,331
Charlie, are you--?

581
00:39:06,573 --> 00:39:08,325
-Go.
-Okay.

582
00:39:19,453 --> 00:39:20,966
l got you, Charlie.

583
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,085
Charlie, are you okay?

584
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:27,370
l'd be better if you'd
get your knee off my spleen.

585
00:39:29,053 --> 00:39:31,851
-Oh, no.
-Hang on, Charlie!

586
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,362
Donna, Charlie.

587
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:38,728
Are you guys okay?
Please tell me you're okay.

588
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:42,203
Donna? Your knee's
in an even worse place this time.

589
00:39:42,373 --> 00:39:44,489
Oh, thanks.

590
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:47,850
You guys, look.

591
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:50,087
Where are we?

592
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:52,483
This would be
the unclaimed-baggage warehouse.

593
00:39:52,653 --> 00:39:53,927
l saw this place on TV.

594
00:39:54,093 --> 00:39:57,768
Oh, my gosh. There's at least 50 years'
worth of unclaimed luggage in this place.

595
00:39:57,933 --> 00:39:59,844
Please, someone, tell me it's beautiful.

596
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:02,404
Hey, Spencer. Looks like your sister's. . .

597
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:06,168
. . .not the only one who's gonna
get a good Christmas this year.

598
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:10,611
-Somebody wanna unzip me?
-Sure. Sorry.

599
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:26,852
Cool.

600
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,005
Oh, boy.

601
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:54,881
No! Please don't kill me.

602
00:41:55,053 --> 00:41:58,966
That was a friendly honk, meant
only to respectfully attract attention.

603
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:03,808
Oh, hey. Sorry to scare you.
l was just about to carve a beaver.

604
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:07,693
Carve a beaver. Got it. Got it.

605
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:12,443
Hey, do you guys sell biodiesel here?

606
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,765
We got regular diesel and unleaded gas.
That's about it.

607
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:20,130
Unless you want a statue of Lincoln
carved out of a telephone pole.

608
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:24,972
What harm could one tank of diesel do?

609
00:42:30,573 --> 00:42:31,926
What have l done?

610
00:42:41,773 --> 00:42:43,843
Oh, thank God.

611
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:57,767
That doesn't look good.

612
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:25,331
So, what's the cool things you found?

613
00:43:26,413 --> 00:43:27,562
Say hello to my surfboard.

614
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,048
l found a walkie-talkie family pack.

615
00:43:30,213 --> 00:43:32,283
lt has cameras and video screens
inside of them.

616
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:34,728
Oh, l just took a video
of the inside of my ear. . .

617
00:43:34,893 --> 00:43:36,884
. . .using a penlight and a macro lens.

618
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:39,965
Now, who wants to see my ear canal?
Come on.

619
00:43:41,573 --> 00:43:42,688
No, thank you.

620
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,652
l'll watch it, then.

621
00:43:46,613 --> 00:43:49,764
Spencer? Anything you wanna tell us?

622
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:53,209
Oh, this. lt's for my sister.
She loves princesses.

623
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:56,291
Then why don't you give her
the rich girl over there?

624
00:43:58,413 --> 00:43:59,971
Kidding.

625
00:44:00,613 --> 00:44:02,046
What'd you find?

626
00:44:02,213 --> 00:44:04,966
You know, l have no idea,
but how cool does it look?

627
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:07,124
Hey, that's an 8-track tape player.

628
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:10,366
According to the Massachusetts
8-Track Collector Magazine. . .

629
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:13,491
. . .l have the largest collection
of cassettes in the state.

630
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:15,689
But l don't mean to brag.

631
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:18,885
This is one of my favorites.

632
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:20,725
Could this night get any better?

633
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:33,411
What is he doing?

634
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:52,730
What are you doing?

635
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:29,453
-Hoffman.
-Shut up.

636
00:45:29,933 --> 00:45:31,685
Hoffman.

637
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:34,208
Not now.

638
00:45:34,693 --> 00:45:37,161
Hoffman, l think you should
take a look at this.

639
00:45:38,613 --> 00:45:39,932
This better be good.

640
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:43,612
What in the sam hill?

641
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:55,848
Oh, Charles.

642
00:45:57,613 --> 00:45:59,569
Hey.

643
00:46:00,173 --> 00:46:02,562
Yeah, Charles.

644
00:46:04,013 --> 00:46:05,492
Hey, hey, hey.

645
00:46:05,653 --> 00:46:08,645
Look, l saved him, l'll dance with him.

646
00:46:09,693 --> 00:46:11,206
Okay.

647
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,286
Hey, you let me touch you.

648
00:46:13,453 --> 00:46:15,364
l'm touching you, kid.
Don't get any ideas.

649
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:17,842
l can still take you down.

650
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:21,441
All right, Kmart, let's see what you got.

651
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,126
Okay.

652
00:46:28,173 --> 00:46:30,733
You realize if you tell anyone
about that photo you saw. . .

653
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:32,963
-. . .l'll have to kill you.
-Right. Lips sealed.

654
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:34,885
Not telling anyone, l swear.

655
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:37,012
Good.

656
00:46:37,973 --> 00:46:41,283
-lt was a nice picture, though. l liked it.
-Nice try.

657
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:44,923
No, l mean, l think girls
look really good in glasses.

658
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:47,527
Not that you don't
look good without them, of course.

659
00:46:47,693 --> 00:46:49,923
l mean, that's not what l meant at all,
you know?

660
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:52,653
-l was a dork.
-Hey, join the club.

661
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:56,483
You're not a dork. You just. . . .

662
00:46:56,653 --> 00:46:59,725
You just need someone doing
better PR for you than your sister.

663
00:47:01,413 --> 00:47:04,485
Are you gonna pass out or something?

664
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:08,646
Oh, man. l mean, we gotta go.

665
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:15,368
You know what, guys? We gotta go.
My sister's expecting Santa's sleigh soon.

666
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:17,603
We don't know
how we're getting to the hotel.

667
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:21,527
Why do you need a hotel when you got
a nice concrete room to go back to?

668
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:24,889
-Run!
-They're on the move, boys.

669
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:28,568
Don't lose them in here.
Van Bourke, guard the door.

670
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:31,201
But it's Christmas Eve, sir.
Can you just. . .

671
00:47:31,373 --> 00:47:32,931
. . .leave them alone?

672
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,732
Split up, split up!

673
00:47:44,373 --> 00:47:46,728
We might wanna
get off the main road here.

674
00:47:47,253 --> 00:47:50,450
-Grace, come on.
-Dirty. Okay.

675
00:48:00,413 --> 00:48:03,803
Okay, nobody panic.
Nobody panic. Nobody panic!

676
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:05,571
Donna, l have a confession.

677
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:08,372
l was never a good runner.
l can't even do the running man.

678
00:48:08,533 --> 00:48:12,321
You smart guys are all the same:
Good on test day, bad on fight day.

679
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,563
Follow me, men.

680
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:19,808
Watch out for your footing, guys.
l don't want anyone falling behind.

681
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:23,685
There's the door.

682
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,006
You guys, look, it's the hotel.

683
00:48:26,733 --> 00:48:27,961
Oh, boy.

684
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:31,250
Move it, moron.
They're escaping out the back.

685
00:48:31,853 --> 00:48:34,845
-lt's the Hoover lnternational Lodge.
-We need to get down there.

686
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:38,329
How? You got four snowmobiles?

687
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:43,286
Watch the Winter Olympics?

688
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:47,006
Wait, wait, wait.

689
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:48,765
Wait.

690
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:50,886
What are you doing?

691
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,044
We're going to the hotel
to find Spencer's sister.

692
00:48:53,213 --> 00:48:55,249
Way to go. Anything else
you wanna tell him?

693
00:48:55,413 --> 00:48:57,768
Van Dork, l'm afraid you know
too much now.

694
00:48:57,933 --> 00:48:59,366
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Okay, now go!

695
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:01,603
Wait, l promise l won't talk.
Please let me out!

696
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,047
Hey! Hey!

697
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:10,325
Last one down the hill is a fired apple.

698
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,483
We seem to be moving a tad rapidly.

699
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,372
Tree! Watch out!

700
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:52,209
-Pine needles!
-Nice steering, Tex.

701
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:57,721
l usually like to try to avoid cliches,
but we've got some company.

702
00:50:04,973 --> 00:50:07,203
More trees!

703
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:12,009
Take evasive action, boys!
Steer around the trees.

704
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,244
How do we steer?

705
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:27,288
You know, if l wasn't so utterly terrified,
l might be having fun.

706
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,006
Drift!

707
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,244
My butt!

708
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:44,768
Cowabunga!

709
00:50:48,093 --> 00:50:49,731
Sweet Jehoshaphat!

710
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,406
Look out, he's gonna hit us!

711
00:50:57,573 --> 00:50:59,450
Lean left!

712
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:07,722
l'm coming, Mr. Porter!

713
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:09,724
This is all wonderful fun. . .

714
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:12,327
. . .but you do realize the enormous
amount of trouble. . .

715
00:51:12,493 --> 00:51:14,484
. . .you're gonna be in
when l catch you, right?

716
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,086
Not if l can help it. Paddle!

717
00:51:19,693 --> 00:51:21,365
Oh, you wanna speed up, huh?

718
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:22,932
Okay!

719
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:25,845
Wait for me!

720
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:32,206
Not to be a stick in the mud. . .

721
00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:34,841
. . .but we're moving
at a very dangerous rate of speed.

722
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:38,130
-l'd like to second that interjection!
-Keep paddling until l say when!

723
00:51:38,293 --> 00:51:40,682
Please tell me you're gonna stop
at the hotel!

724
00:51:40,853 --> 00:51:43,651
Yeah, we are, but you're not!
Hit the brakes!

725
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:45,963
Hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes!

726
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:50,327
Unbelievable.

727
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,893
l don't get paid enough for this!

728
00:51:55,053 --> 00:51:57,886
Holy cow!

729
00:52:00,373 --> 00:52:02,489
Well, this should be interesting.

730
00:52:05,453 --> 00:52:07,284
Darn.

731
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:11,963
Van Dork, aren't you coming with us?

732
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:14,249
No, you guys do what you gotta do.

733
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:17,086
l'm just gonna sit here and you know. . .

734
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:19,285
. . .throw up for a little bit.

735
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:21,405
-Go.
-Spencer.

736
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:24,326
-Yeah?
-Be careful, okay?

737
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:26,769
You guys are acting like
you had too much sugar.

738
00:52:26,933 --> 00:52:29,401
Don't worry, Van Bourke. We're okay.

739
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:31,131
Wait up, you guys.

740
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:40,493
Guard cat.

741
00:53:11,101 --> 00:53:13,296
You were a worthy opponent.

742
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:29,292
Ain't it a little past your bedtime, sonny?

743
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,219
l want a Christmas tree.

744
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:33,773
What about that little one?

745
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:39,657
What do l look like,
freaking Charlie Brown?

746
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:42,217
This big one's expensive.
You got any money?

747
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:56,377
-Sunday potluck, don't forget!
-All right, partner, see you there!

748
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:58,253
You wanna come in for some eggnog?

749
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:00,220
Oh, man.

750
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:02,571
How am l gonna get to my kids now?

751
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:04,930
Your kids?

752
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:08,895
No, sir. No kid should be alone
on Christmas Eve. Not in an airport.

753
00:54:09,101 --> 00:54:12,810
l really appreciate it.
However l can repay you, just name it.

754
00:54:14,661 --> 00:54:15,810
Oh, no.

755
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:18,819
The mayor left it off for an oil change,
but he's out of town.

756
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:21,854
You use it to pick up your kids
and head back here.

757
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:23,813
l'll get you a rental car
in the morning.

758
00:54:24,021 --> 00:54:26,216
l can't drive that thing.
lt gets terrible mileage.

759
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:29,219
l'd loan you my Caddy, but squirrels
ate through the brake lines.

760
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:31,218
l'm afraid this is your only choice.

761
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:35,060
Depends how much you wanna
see your kids.

762
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:39,013
Forgive me, brother squirrel.

763
00:54:44,141 --> 00:54:45,460
Oh, man.

764
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:49,730
l hope the boys in the Sierra Club
don't see me in this.

765
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:51,369
Thanks.

766
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:53,139
Okay, so my sister is in room 424.

767
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:56,617
We've got like 1 4 minutes and--
Thirteen.

768
00:55:00,061 --> 00:55:03,610
Okay. Now l'm mad.

769
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:05,579
Elevator.

770
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:09,978
-What are you doing? Get in.
-We'll take care of him. Get your sister.

771
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,217
Here, take these walkies.
You'll need them.

772
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:13,740
Don't you kids know. . .

773
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:17,377
. . .that you're supposed
to be good on Christmas Eve?

774
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,812
Physician, heal thyself!

775
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:22,170
lt's Shakespeare.

776
00:55:22,381 --> 00:55:25,020
Man, you're no end of help
in a fight, are you?

777
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:30,574
Oh, well. Maybe next Christmas
will be better than this one.

778
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:34,490
Sir, l advise you not to do that.

779
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:38,060
Punk, watch this.

780
00:55:40,821 --> 00:55:42,891
Thanks for the tip.

781
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:47,893
Oh, perfect. Now everything hurts.

782
00:55:48,821 --> 00:55:51,289
My contacts are going crazy.

783
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:57,058
Once a dork. . .

784
00:55:58,101 --> 00:55:59,500
. . .always a dork.

785
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:01,740
You are so not a dork.

786
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:08,132
Kid!

787
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:11,580
-Hey, kid!
-Santa's sleigh arrives in nine minutes.

788
00:56:11,741 --> 00:56:14,733
-We gotta find her.
-lt's time to pluck your eyebrows.

789
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:17,933
-ls my sister Katherine in there?
-Who wants to know?

790
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,369
Her brother wants to know.

791
00:56:19,581 --> 00:56:22,493
Well, l'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

792
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:26,573
Let me handle this.

793
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:30,896
Move!

794
00:56:34,501 --> 00:56:35,695
Oh, no.

795
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:39,220
Room service! Room service!

796
00:56:39,421 --> 00:56:41,571
Hey! No! Stop that!

797
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:46,218
Stop. Stop that.
You're gonna get me in trouble!

798
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:50,336
There were some kids running wild
in the hall. . .

799
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:53,294
. . .and l was just trying to stop them.

800
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,173
lt wasn't me.

801
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:57,654
lt sounded like you.

802
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:01,376
They're very talented children.

803
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:06,860
l'm just gonna go find the children.

804
00:57:07,581 --> 00:57:08,980
Right now!

805
00:57:09,181 --> 00:57:12,173
-Charlie, where are you?
-Engaged with the enemy at the moment.

806
00:57:12,381 --> 00:57:15,259
-Taking evasive action.
-We think Spencer's sister is downstairs.

807
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:18,419
-We need you to keep the coast clear.
-Roger that.

808
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:21,693
Donna, time for Han Solo
and the Death Star.

809
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:23,414
Trust me. lt's a nerd thing.

810
00:57:29,181 --> 00:57:32,253
You've gotta be kidding me.
Not a Star Wars move.

811
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:37,774
Oh, no, no, no.

812
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:40,256
-No!
-Room service! Room Service.

813
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:42,850
-No!
-Room service! Get your free food here!

814
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:48,061
Now, l know this looks bad, but. . . .

815
00:57:48,261 --> 00:57:51,094
And now so do you.

816
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:53,300
Oh, no.

817
00:58:17,781 --> 00:58:19,817
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

818
00:58:27,741 --> 00:58:29,777
Don't you just wanna take a picture?

819
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:34,332
Oh, you're all in so much trouble.

820
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,452
Just don't wake up my sister, okay?

821
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:39,133
Any more requests?

822
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:40,490
Milk and cookies?

823
00:58:40,701 --> 00:58:43,499
A jail cell with a view?

824
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:47,660
Mr. Porter, now, l know you probably
don't want to hear this. . .

825
00:58:47,821 --> 00:58:52,212
. . .but l think that maybe you should just
let these kids stay at the hotel.

826
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:58,209
-lt's Christmas.
-ls that your sage advice, Van Bourke?

827
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:02,300
l will take your opinion
into consideration one day. . .

828
00:59:02,461 --> 00:59:06,215
. . .when l actually care what you think.

829
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:13,093
Oliver. . .

830
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:17,500
. . .as soon as l get these kids
back on their planes, l quit.

831
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:25,540
March.

832
00:59:31,741 --> 00:59:34,096
Sir, are you taking us to the U.M. room?

833
00:59:34,301 --> 00:59:37,293
l would never do that to you
on Christmas morning.

834
00:59:37,501 --> 00:59:39,059
-Really?
-No.

835
00:59:39,461 --> 00:59:42,692
You'll all be much happier
here in your own private rooms.

836
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:45,980
-Private rooms?
-You don't expect me to let you. . .

837
00:59:46,141 --> 00:59:49,531
. . .stay together, plan your next assault
on me and my airport?

838
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:52,175
lt's ''my airport and l. ''

839
00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:57,011
Hey, get this, Strunk and White,
''me and my airport'' is correct.

840
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,900
-Dang.
-Oh, and by the way. . .

841
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:04,417
. . .all those stranded passengers
you saw sleeping in the gate area?

842
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:08,660
There are too many of them
and not enough planes leaving.

843
01:00:08,821 --> 01:00:11,381
So l thought
since they followed all the rules. . .

844
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:15,210
. . .and since you have such nice,
comfortable rooms to stay in. . .

845
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:18,219
. . .that you wouldn't mind
if l bumped you from your flights. . .

846
01:00:18,421 --> 01:00:20,093
. . .and let them go instead.

847
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:21,620
-Sir.
-Don't worry.

848
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:25,860
You'll be able to leave this afternoon
or by this evening.

849
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:28,939
-Tomorrow for sure.
-You can't do that.

850
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:34,370
As a matter of fact,
it's one of the few things l can do.

851
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:36,493
Lock them up.

852
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:51,219
l'll be in my office watching
your every move on camera.

853
01:00:51,421 --> 01:00:54,060
There'll be guards posted
outside your doors.

854
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:56,013
lf you find your way out of here. . .

855
01:00:56,221 --> 01:00:59,816
. . .l'll be the first to congratulate you
and admit defeat. . .

856
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:03,297
. . .because you will have accomplished
the impossible.

857
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:08,499
Good luck.

858
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,460
Hey, guys.

859
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:12,818
Thanks for all the help with my sister.

860
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:16,377
You know, I'm sorry that
all your Christmases have to be ruined...

861
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:17,980
. . .because of me.

862
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:22,497
We probably won 't see each other again
after our flights leave, so I just...

863
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:26,332
. . .wanted to say
that l had a really good time. . .

864
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:29,101
...and that I think we make
a pretty awesome family.

865
01:02:29,261 --> 01:02:32,697
Maybe the thing is it's just none of
our families are meant to stay together...

866
01:02:32,901 --> 01:02:34,095
... you know?
Maybe that's it.

867
01:02:34,301 --> 01:02:36,053
Except for you, Grace.

868
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:40,935
Actually, that's not totally true.

869
01:02:41,501 --> 01:02:43,651
l thought your parents weren't divorced.

870
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:49,299
Well, not from each other,
but they sort of divorced me.

871
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:51,735
What do you mean?

872
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:55,214
They just don't seem
to like it when l'm around.

873
01:02:56,901 --> 01:03:00,610
That's why they travel all the time.
They're in Paris right now.

874
01:03:01,341 --> 01:03:05,539
-So is that where you're going?
-No. l'm already home.

875
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:13,059
l live 20 minutes from here.
l flew in today from boarding school.

876
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:17,857
l figured it'd be more fun hanging at the
airport than sitting home with my nanny.

877
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:21,656
She wanted Christmas off anyway.

878
01:03:25,461 --> 01:03:27,850
Now l'm really depressed.

879
01:03:34,581 --> 01:03:36,458
You guys have vents in your ceiling?

880
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:40,657
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

881
01:03:40,861 --> 01:03:43,773
-Then l'm getting us out of here.
-Spencer.

882
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:45,937
That guy's watching us on the cameras.

883
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:47,813
He'll see everything we do.

884
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:57,291
Not if he doesn't see what we're doing.

885
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,861
Just go to sleep, you little monsters.

886
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:29,053
-Okay, phase one finished?
-Check.

887
01:04:29,261 --> 01:04:30,410
-Check.
-Check.

888
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:31,690
Okay. On to phase two.

889
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:34,980
What was the worst Christmas gift
you ever got?

890
01:04:35,181 --> 01:04:38,730
That's easy. My brother Frank gave me
the same Christmas present for 1 4 years.

891
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:40,340
Hated it.

892
01:04:40,581 --> 01:04:42,412
-What was it?
-A punch in the head.

893
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:44,733
Ready? Go.

894
01:04:48,341 --> 01:04:49,854
What the. . .?

895
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:57,138
Stupid cheap cameras.

896
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:14,098
Doesn't get any better than this.

897
01:05:23,901 --> 01:05:26,210
Oh, we're supposed
to take away chairs.

898
01:05:36,221 --> 01:05:38,052
-l win!
-Can l say something to you?

899
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:40,138
What?

900
01:05:40,341 --> 01:05:42,172
Who needs Hawaii?

901
01:05:49,341 --> 01:05:50,820
What?

902
01:06:03,301 --> 01:06:06,054
Donna? Are you okay?

903
01:06:06,261 --> 01:06:08,092
lt's really small in here.

904
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:10,417
l know. lt's great, isn't it?

905
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:14,136
Charlie, just because you compensate for
your abandonment issues by squeezing. . .

906
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:18,380
. . .yourself into small, womb-like spaces
doesn't mean everybody else does.

907
01:06:19,981 --> 01:06:22,097
What?
My mom's a psychologist.

908
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:24,892
Donna, l won't let anything
happen to you.

909
01:06:25,101 --> 01:06:26,420
l promise.

910
01:06:27,501 --> 01:06:29,298
Thanks.

911
01:06:35,301 --> 01:06:38,259
Oh, Charlie, you didn't.

912
01:06:38,901 --> 01:06:42,098
Sorry, l get nervous.
l had a hot dog when l got off the plane.

913
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:43,939
Oh, Charlie.

914
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:47,531
Yeah, can we hold all of those until
we're out of the confined space, please?

915
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:49,060
Will do.

916
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:02,537
-Where are you going?
-The food court's this way.

917
01:07:02,741 --> 01:07:05,858
Trust me.
A few hundred yards and l'll be--

918
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:09,817
Charlie!

919
01:07:10,021 --> 01:07:11,852
Charlie, please tell me you're okay.

920
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:16,414
Hey, Donna.
l told you l'd get you out of there.

921
01:07:19,261 --> 01:07:22,651
This is where Mr. Porter
put all the Christmas decorations.

922
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,253
Hey, hey!

923
01:07:28,981 --> 01:07:30,460
Wake up!

924
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:33,419
Wake up! Check the rooms, you idiots!

925
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,817
Does this mean we can go on break?

926
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:09,254
All clear.

927
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:15,696
l don't think any planes. . .

928
01:08:15,901 --> 01:08:17,778
-. . .are gonna be flying today.
-Nope.

929
01:08:18,301 --> 01:08:20,417
Looks like we'll be spending
another day together.

930
01:08:22,621 --> 01:08:24,100
Sounds good to me.

931
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:37,300
ls that. . .?

932
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:46,173
Oh, my gosh.

933
01:08:58,461 --> 01:09:01,453
Man, wasn't easy getting this
through security.

934
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:09,050
lt's Christmas.

935
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:11,172
You know what, guys?

936
01:09:12,221 --> 01:09:14,098
l've got an idea.

937
01:09:28,021 --> 01:09:29,818
Let's do this.

938
01:09:37,661 --> 01:09:39,697
And then l said, ''That is my food. ''

939
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,939
Donna, how did you get here?

940
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:44,339
Van Bourke. . .

941
01:09:45,701 --> 01:09:47,020
. . .we need your help.

942
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:53,770
l need a list of all the kids
traveling with families. . .

943
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,017
. . .and the passengers
traveling by themselves.

944
01:09:56,221 --> 01:09:58,974
Okay, this one's mine
and that one's yours. Okay?

945
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:02,813
Can you also get the unaccompanied
minors back here at 7 a.m.?

946
01:10:05,421 --> 01:10:06,536
Oh, one more thing.

947
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:24,100
l guess l owe you a congratulations.

948
01:10:24,301 --> 01:10:25,939
As promised.

949
01:10:26,821 --> 01:10:29,051
Who trained you kids, the Navy SEALs?

950
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,971
Look, sir, just-- Divorce kids are
more resourceful than others, that's all.

951
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:36,180
Any chance you can tell me
what you're up to now?

952
01:10:36,621 --> 01:10:39,010
Something nice. You know, nothing bad.
l promise.

953
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:42,577
Any chance of you trusting me
and not locking us up again?

954
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:45,500
l was just doing my job.
You do know that, right?

955
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:50,733
Just like l've just been doing my job
every Christmas for the past 1 5 years.

956
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:53,651
Bet your family hates it
that you work on Christmas.

957
01:10:53,861 --> 01:10:57,740
Not much of a problem,
since my wife left five Christmases ago.

958
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:01,456
That why you don't put up
the decorations?

959
01:11:01,661 --> 01:11:04,733
Well, let's just say
they don't remind me of happy times.

960
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,016
We were just, you know,
trying to have a Christmas.

961
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:10,860
-We thought you'd care.
-Why would l care?

962
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:13,894
This is an airport.
You're passengers.

963
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:17,776
-So?
-So passengers leave.

964
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:20,220
There's one thing l don't get.

965
01:11:20,701 --> 01:11:22,180
l bump you off your planes. . .

966
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:25,613
. . .and l keep you
from your families at Christmas.

967
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:29,890
Why do you guys seem
almost happy?

968
01:11:31,181 --> 01:11:33,137
Because you didn't keep us
from our family.

969
01:11:33,341 --> 01:11:35,172
At least, not our new family.

970
01:11:38,261 --> 01:11:39,660
Right.

971
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:42,660
l got it.

972
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:46,253
Mr. Porter.

973
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,734
We got you something.

974
01:11:49,941 --> 01:11:52,216
Sorry we wrecked your vacation.

975
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,299
Almost there.
Highway mileage, not city mileage.

976
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:28,061
Highway mileage, not city--
Oh, come on!

977
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:32,737
Why?! l've already filled you up
five times!

978
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:37,696
How can you drink so much?!
You yellow monster!

979
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:06,889
Good morning.

980
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:11,613
Merry Christmas! Everybody up!

981
01:13:45,461 --> 01:13:47,213
Happy holidays, everyone.

982
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,020
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

983
01:14:17,341 --> 01:14:18,660
Spencer.

984
01:14:18,861 --> 01:14:21,295
-Spencer, Spencer.
-Oh, whoa, hi.

985
01:14:23,061 --> 01:14:24,619
Spencer, look what Santa brought me.

986
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:26,493
He even brought back Sir Poops-A-Lot.

987
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:28,175
Santa's a nice guy, huh?

988
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,620
Santa came back.

989
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:38,256
lt's Santa.

990
01:14:39,781 --> 01:14:42,579
-Who is that?
-l thought you knew.

991
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:48,253
l hope you've all been
good little boys and girls.

992
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:51,937
Okay. Okay. Stay with me.

993
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:53,690
-Yes.
-Santa.

994
01:14:53,901 --> 01:14:55,493
Get me a chair, you idiot.

995
01:14:57,421 --> 01:15:00,891
-Here you go, Santa, sir.
-Yes. Thank you.

996
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:04,577
l'm looking for Owen Marks.

997
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:05,930
l'm Owen Marks.

998
01:15:06,141 --> 01:15:10,737
-Well, merry Christmas, Owen Marks.
-Thanks, Santa.

999
01:15:10,941 --> 01:15:13,774
Oh, you're welcome, Owen.
Merry Christmas.

1000
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:16,290
You're not, like, gonna be scared
of him now, are you?

1001
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:18,014
Not after the night l just had.

1002
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:20,177
Wait! Wait, wait, wait for me!
Wait for me.

1003
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:22,337
l wanna help. l wanna help.

1004
01:15:22,621 --> 01:15:24,771
-Merry Christmas.
-All right. Merry Christmas.

1005
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:28,176
Man, l'm glad you guys
already have a Santa Claus.

1006
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:30,099
There was a dead mouse in my costume.

1007
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:35,379
-Dad?
-Daddy! Daddy!

1008
01:15:35,581 --> 01:15:38,493
Merry Christmas, pumpkin!

1009
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,657
You drove from Pennsylvania for us?

1010
01:15:41,141 --> 01:15:43,530
Of course l did, Spence. l'm your dad.

1011
01:15:43,741 --> 01:15:46,653
Through a blizzard? ln your car?

1012
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:50,099
Yeah. Actually, l. . . .

1013
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:51,450
l drove a Humvee.

1014
01:15:51,661 --> 01:15:55,540
A Hummer! You drove a Hummer
from Pennsylvania. . .

1015
01:15:55,741 --> 01:15:57,379
. . .in a blizzard just to see us.

1016
01:15:57,581 --> 01:16:00,653
Yeah, yeah. But, hey, let's just
talk about happy things, shall we?

1017
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:03,659
l take back everything
l ever said about you.

1018
01:16:05,181 --> 01:16:07,741
Wait, what--? What kind of things
did you say about me?

1019
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:09,210
Alan Davies!

1020
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:14,776

1021
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:16,573
Actually, it's--

1022
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:18,170
Sorry, l'm 36.

1023
01:16:18,381 --> 01:16:21,930
You're at an airport alone
on Christmas morning, aren't you?

1024
01:16:22,621 --> 01:16:23,849
Yes, Santa, l am.

1025
01:16:24,061 --> 01:16:28,577
Well, Alan, come on over
and get your present from Santa.

1026
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,981
Awesome. l'd love a present.

1027
01:16:35,461 --> 01:16:38,419
-A basketball.
-Oh, l love basketball!

1028
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:42,817
Check this out. l used to be an all-star.
Hey, can you throw that back?

1029
01:16:44,221 --> 01:16:48,180
l have a lot of presents to give away,
but before l do. . .

1030
01:16:48,381 --> 01:16:50,531
. . .l just wanna thank
my friends over there. . .

1031
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:52,572
. . .for setting all this up.

1032
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,339
lf they actually worked for Santa. . .

1033
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:56,816
. . .they'd be fired so fast
their heads would spin.

1034
01:16:57,661 --> 01:17:00,971
But they did a wonderful job
here this morning.

1035
01:17:01,181 --> 01:17:04,332
And since they did,
l want them to know. . .

1036
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:08,329
. . .that they'll be flying out of here
first thing this morning!

1037
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,260
Merry Christmas!

1038
01:17:12,941 --> 01:17:16,092
-You're friends with Santa?
-Yeah.

1039
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:17,690

1040
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:37,574
Hi.

1041
01:17:38,141 --> 01:17:39,210
Do you like dolls?

1042
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:43,531
l don't know.
Not as much as l used to, l guess.

1043
01:17:43,741 --> 01:17:45,413
l am 1 2, you know.

1044
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:49,292
Did you know that l found
that Christmas tree?

1045
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:54,178
You did? How?

1046
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:57,130
Let me tell you a little story
about a man called Beef.

1047
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,099
Okay.

1048
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:03,773
lt all started on a cold, stormy night.

1049
01:18:03,981 --> 01:18:06,859
Me and Aquaman started trudging
through the snow.

1050
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:08,973
Yeah. Yeah, Mom. We're fine.

1051
01:18:09,181 --> 01:18:12,969
You know, it turned out that it wasn't
such a bad night after all, you know?

1052
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:18,410
ln fact it was. . . .
lt was actually pretty great.

1053
01:18:18,781 --> 01:18:20,294
So. . . .

1054
01:18:20,501 --> 01:18:23,538
Yeah, l'll call again
when l get to Dad's house.

1055
01:18:24,781 --> 01:18:26,260
Mom?

1056
01:18:27,101 --> 01:18:28,216
l. . . .

1057
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:29,934
l love you.

1058
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,536
Her name is Lady Sleeps-A-Lot.

1059
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:45,980
Oh, Val, what's wrong?

1060
01:18:46,141 --> 01:18:49,099
Oh, my gosh. Are the kids okay?

1061
01:18:49,301 --> 01:18:51,861
-Honey?
-lt's Spencer.

1062
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:53,700
Well, is he all right?

1063
01:18:54,621 --> 01:18:57,931
He said that he loved me.

1064
01:19:00,261 --> 01:19:03,890
Oh, criminy, Val.
You need to start dating more.

1065
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:06,820
Do you know how ridiculous you look?

1066
01:19:07,901 --> 01:19:09,380
Really.

1067
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:20,332
So it's all right if l call you sometime?

1068
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:23,689
Why do you think l gave you
my phone number, goofball?

1069
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:33,460
lt was nice meeting you, Donna.
You're a very special young lady.

1070
01:19:43,101 --> 01:19:45,171
Man, you're so hot!

1071
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,012
Yeah, l know.

1072
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:52,172
Other side. The middle.

1073
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:54,417
Down low. Too slow.

1074
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:58,580
l should have noticed because ''too slow''
rhymes with ''down low. ''

1075
01:19:59,101 --> 01:20:00,819
Why didn't l see that coming?

1076
01:20:01,021 --> 01:20:02,898
Well, hope you have a nice Christmas.

1077
01:20:04,061 --> 01:20:05,176
How could l not?

1078
01:20:05,381 --> 01:20:09,420
Got the whole place to myself.
More fruitcake and eggnog for me.

1079
01:20:13,421 --> 01:20:16,413
Yeah, you know, l was sort of thinking.

1080
01:20:16,621 --> 01:20:19,613
Maybe if you don't wanna go home
quite yet. . .

1081
01:20:19,821 --> 01:20:21,732

1084
01:20:32,621 --> 01:20:34,498
Took you long enough, noodle-head.

1085
01:20:35,501 --> 01:20:36,980
Come on.

1086
01:20:42,061 --> 01:20:44,177
Oh, hey.
You guys have any money for gas?

1087
