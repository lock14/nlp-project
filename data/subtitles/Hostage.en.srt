1
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:36,928
I need to talk to that motherfucker!
You hear me?

2
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,472
I want to talk to that fucker right now!

3
00:03:39,473 --> 00:03:42,934
I want that motherfucker!

4
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,657
You find that bastard now
or I am gonna...

5
00:03:57,658 --> 00:04:01,452
I'm gonna shoot my whore wife
and I'm gonna shoot the boy!

6
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,913
Joe, just relax.

7
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:06,249
Relax, we're looking
for your wife's boyfriend

8
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,418
and I'm gonna find him, all right?
- You want to help me?

9
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:13,423
Which one do I shoot first? Do I shoot
the whore, or do I shoot the whore's boy?

10
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,091
<i>Huh? You help me choose!</i>

11
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:19,095
No, no, Joe,
nobody wants to hear gunshots in there.

12
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,931
You scare us all out here.

13
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:24,100
Now look,
I've been trying to help you all day.

14
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:26,936
All right, You want me to help you,
you gotta help me.

15
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:28,855
<i>You don't know what it's like, man.</i>

16
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,440
<i>You do not know what it's like.</i>

17
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:33,484
You do not know what I've been through.
You don't know what I'm going through.

18
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,570
<i>You don't think I got the balls, do you?</i>

19
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:38,197
I know you got the balls, Joe.

20
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:42,952
No, you don't think I'm gonna do it.
- Joe, you got the gun.

21
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:46,414
You can do whatever you want.

22
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,172
I feel so tired, man.
When in Christ am I gonna sleep?

23
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:58,718
I know you're tired, Joe.
You've been up all night.

24
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,262
Come on. Let me come down there.

25
00:05:01,263 --> 00:05:03,389
What do you say?
- No! No, no!

26
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,852
<i>Fuck you!</i>

27
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:27,622
You all right?

28
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,499
I hate this fucking guy,

29
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,751
Jeff, I'm leaning toward an entry,

30
00:05:31,752 --> 00:05:36,506
We know the boy's in his room, If we move
now, we got a 100% chance of saving him,

31
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:39,842
We're giving up on the mom?
- She's 20% at best,

32
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:43,012
Jeff, we gotta move on the boy,
It's the only choice,

33
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:46,849
This one's getting away from him,
- Shrink-wrap, don't talk like I'm not here,

34
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,686
We've been here for 16 hours,
- Fucking new guy,

35
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:52,313
Everybody calm down,
We're all tired,

36
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:55,275
I'd just steer Joe away from the subject
of choice, Choosing represents...

37
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:57,193
Tell me something I don't fucking know,

38
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:59,195
Wait, wait,

39
00:05:59,196 --> 00:06:00,947
I hear crying,
- The boy's awake,

40
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,783
We've gotta keep the boy in his bedroom,

41
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:07,245
<i>Shut up, Sean, Shut up!</i>

42
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:15,336
Hey, Joe, It's me, Jeff, I'm back on,

43
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,547
Listen, let Sean's mom
take care of him, all right?

44
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:20,049
He's such a little shit, you know?
He's a little shit.

45
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,136
He's probably hungry,
'cause he wakes up and he just whines...

46
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,555
Tell you what, Let me do you a favor,
...till that bitch feeds him.

47
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:28,641
Find out what Sean likes to eat,
and I'll send it in,

48
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:31,494
Him and his mom can eat in the bedroom
while me and you fix this thing,

49
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:33,187
What do you say?
- Sean!

50
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:37,275
The cops want to know
what you want to eat, so get in here.

51
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:41,112
The boy's moving from his bedroom,
- Get in here!

52
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:44,574
Our guys put him at 80%,

53
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,749
<i>Hello?</i>

54
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,542
Sean,

55
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:57,295
<i>Hey, this is Jeff Talley.</i>

56
00:06:57,296 --> 00:07:01,382
Son, I need you to move back
to your bedroom, OK? Right now.

57
00:07:01,383 --> 00:07:03,134
Mr, Talley?
- Yes?

58
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:06,596
Are you gonna save us?

59
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,392
Yeah, Sean, I'm gonna save you,

60
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:23,112
Now I know why you couldn't choose,

61
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:26,908
It's because God
decided everything already.

62
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,118
<i>Me and the whore are gonna go to hell.</i>

63
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:35,458
No, Joe, Just... Look, relax, Just relax,
- But my boy's gonna go to heaven.

64
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,294
<i>I'm sorry, Jeff.</i>

65
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:41,756
<i>Joe, listen,</i>

66
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,552
Come on, Joe, Pick it up, Pick it up,

67
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:50,014
I hear ringing,
- Pick it up,

68
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,101
It's just ringing,
- Pick it up, Joe,

69
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:55,603
Jeff? He's saying something,

70
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:57,438
We got movement!
- Fuck!

71
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,023
Where's your shot?
- We lost the shot,

72
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:01,317
Where do you want it?
- Side one, opening two,

73
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,195
I'll put him there,
- O my God, at the end of this day,

74
00:08:04,196 --> 00:08:09,284
I'm heartily thankful
for all the graces I've received.

75
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:13,121
I'm so sorry for all the sins
I've committed against you.

76
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:16,583
<i>Please forgive me, O God.</i>

77
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:20,503
And graciously protect me
at the end of this night.

78
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:24,966
Blessed Virgin Mary, my heavenly mother,
please take me under your protection.

79
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,676
<i>Joe! Hey, it's me, Jeff...</i>

80
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:29,304
<i>And St. Joseph.</i>

81
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:30,596
I'm outside your house!

82
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,515
<i>Saints of God, please pray for me.</i>

83
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:34,684
Just come to the window
and talk to me! Come on!

84
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:38,271
Amen.
- It's me, Jeff! Just come on!

85
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:43,359
Joe, only God has the right to decide
who lives and who dies!

86
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,780
And he hasn't decided!

87
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:51,284
Joe! It doesn't have to end now!
I know you can hear me!

88
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:53,202
Joe, just come to the window
and talk to me!

89
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:56,122
Come on, pray with me,
I'll pray with you, Come on,

90
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:59,417
Come on, Just shoot me, Shoot me,

91
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:03,379
Come on, I'm right here, Just come to
the window, Come on, I know this prayer,

92
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,882
St, Joseph, dear God...

93
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:09,344
<i>Joe!</i>

94
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:39,374
Fuck,

95
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,502
Sean?

96
00:09:42,503 --> 00:09:45,964
Sean?

97
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:50,677
Medic!

98
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,789
Everybody stand down,
Get the EMTs,

99
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,761
'Cause it's not fair,
My life sucks since Dad moved up here,

100
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:16,220
We've all had
to make adjustments,

101
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,388
It's just as hard on your father,

102
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:20,850
Oh, bullshit, Mom, He loves it here,
He thinks Bristo Camino's nice,

103
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,268
<i>Can we talk about this in the car?</i>

104
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,854
No, Mom,
Why can't you tell him to come back to LA?

105
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:26,522
<i>His job is here, Amanda,</i>

106
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:28,608
His home is here,
and when we visit, it's our home too,

107
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:31,486
It's not my home
and it'll never be my home!

108
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:34,530
Mom, don't you get it?
I fucking hate it here!

109
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:37,867
Don't swear, and keep your voice down,
- What about me?

110
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:40,954
Bathroom's free,

111
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:44,540
Why don't you guys
just get divorced?

112
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,961
Freezie, come on,

113
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,806
It's OK, I'm not finished with it yet,

114
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,774
Sorry for all the shouting,

115
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:13,695
Well... She had to get me to hear her
somehow, didn't she?

116
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:16,572
This is getting really, really hard,
you know?

117
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:18,157
I just wish you would talk to me,

118
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:20,576
How am I not talking to you?
I'm talking to you right now,

119
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:22,161
It would be nice
to know what you're thinking,

120
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:25,915
I'm thinking
that I'm a half-hour late for work,

121
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:31,880
Well, at least explain again
to your daughter why you took this job,

122
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,471
See you next weekend,

123
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:50,816
Hey,

124
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:56,946
Look, I don't know
what pisses you off more,

125
00:12:56,947 --> 00:13:00,408
Me or my Tater-Tot casserole,

126
00:13:01,702 --> 00:13:04,787
Amanda,

127
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:08,250
Amanda,

128
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,711
<i>Aman...</i>

129
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:26,768
This yours?

130
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:31,022
Dennis,

131
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,360
Smooth,

132
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:37,278
Hey, that's, like, a $ 200 ticket,
- Shut up,

133
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,782
You got $ 200? Huh?
- Shut up, Kevin,

134
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:45,537
Green light,

135
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:04,347
If you have four dollars, you can't
give him seven, So you have to borrow,

136
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:08,768
Yeah, but... so you're...
If you're studying borrowing,

137
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,021
you have to know
exactly how much you're borrowing,

138
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:13,940
OK, Bye,

139
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:15,900
Can I go hang at the Plaza tonight?
- The Plaza?

140
00:14:15,901 --> 00:14:19,028
Yeah, just friends, It might be a movie,
- Can we have Mr, Kim's tonight?

141
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:21,197
Can you wait?
- Oh, Mr, Kim we have on speed dial,

142
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,032
I'm hungry,
- I'm talking,

143
00:14:23,033 --> 00:14:27,912
I'm ordering, Hello, yes, I wanted to
put in an order, please, to pick up,

144
00:14:27,913 --> 00:14:30,290
What about homework?
- Done,

145
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,042
<i>Ha, I almost believe that,</i>

146
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:34,877
Yeah, We'd like to order...

147
00:14:34,878 --> 00:14:37,046
Well, what would we like to order?

148
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,549
<i>Kev, do the Dew, In super size,</i>

149
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,259
<i>Hey, why do I always gotta go?</i>

150
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,387
If I'm buying, you're flying,
Get out of the truck,

151
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:47,807
You should listen to your brother,
- Give me some money then,

152
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:51,269
It's in the box,

153
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,941
What's that for? Dennis?

154
00:14:56,942 --> 00:15:00,403
Check the car, Check the car, Mars,

155
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,417
Hey, I know her,

156
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:18,212
I mean... I don't know her,
I've seen her around,

157
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:21,800
You know where she lives?
- No,

158
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:40,610
Oh, you think it's funny?

159
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:43,613
Rich bitch driving in her daddy's Escalade,

160
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:47,075
Fuck you,

161
00:16:01,382 --> 00:16:04,592
Hello, Louise,
- Afternoon, Chief,

162
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,302
Who's in the field?

163
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:10,306
Ruiz and Kovaks are working
a TC over on Monte Verde,

164
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:14,519
Two units, one fender bender,
Hope she's 18,

165
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,313
Afternoon, Chief,
- Bill,

166
00:16:17,314 --> 00:16:19,816
Mikey, Very dynamic wheels,

167
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,359
Casual Monday?
- Well, Chief, I...

168
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,236
How do you expect
to be taken seriously as a cop

169
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:25,321
if you're gonna wear
sneakers to work, kid?

170
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:29,033
I'm sorry, Chief, It won't happen again,
- That's what you said on Casual Sunday,

171
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:32,496
It was the play-offs,
- Yeah,

172
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:35,790
What do you say we rename today
Low-crime Monday?

173
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,168
Followed by what?
- Low-crime Tuesday,

174
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:42,589
That's right,

175
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,468
Low-crime Tuesday,

176
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:54,035
Yes, I would say
Brenda's looking very good,

177
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,245
Fine, Couple of minutes,

178
00:17:56,246 --> 00:17:57,497
Daddy?

179
00:17:57,498 --> 00:18:01,918
Uh, can you give me just a second?
My son just walked in,

180
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,170
What's this attached to my ear?

181
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:06,255
A phone,
- Why is it attached to my ear?

182
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:09,676
'Cause you're talking on it?
- Which means you are...

183
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:12,845
Interrupting your conversation?
- That's my genius,

184
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:16,099
OK, Mr, Genius, What I'd like is
all your homework done, on my desk,

185
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,268
before any more television, Sound good?

186
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,520
God...
- I know,

187
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:23,606
How about getting
the doors there for me, champ?

188
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,317
Appreciate it, One, and then...
- The other,

189
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:29,780
Yeah, Thanks, champ,

190
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:36,411
OK, I am ready
to loan you Heaven Can Wait.

191
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:41,416
What time would you like me to drop it?

192
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:45,378
OK,

193
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:53,053
Done,

194
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,275
I like it,

195
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:10,570
Let's just go to the movies,

196
00:19:10,571 --> 00:19:12,697
We're gonna go to the movies,

197
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,408
But first we're gonna take daddy's car,
- No, man,

198
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:20,664
Dennis, this is way worse
than any shit you've done before,

199
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:29,923
Stay in the truck, OK?

200
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,596
Dad, you're such a dinosaur!

201
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:39,182
All right, All I'm saying
is that there are men out there,

202
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:41,225
Men, Not the boys I go to school with,

203
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:43,519
Right, Men, OK?

204
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,985
Men see this sort of outfit
as a sexual invitation, That's all I'm saying,

205
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:08,419
Looking for something?
- Empty,

206
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,172
Ooh, how'd that happen?

207
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:15,301
Look, how's this?
If I change what I'm wearing,

208
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:19,764
will you give me $40 for tonight?
- If that doesn't remind me of your mother,

209
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,183
How about you change
what you're wearing,

210
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:26,062
then we talk about the $40 afterwards, OK?

211
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,427
Hey, Hey,

212
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,889
Door,

213
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:13,693
Say it again, rich bitch, Huh?

214
00:21:13,694 --> 00:21:17,155
Say Fuck you,

215
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,431
Tommy?

216
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:46,309
Tommy, what...
- Hey, don't move,

217
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,895
No, No,
- Don't move, man,

218
00:21:48,896 --> 00:21:52,690
What do you want?
- Who else is in the house?

219
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,984
Nobody,

220
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:56,653
<i>Daddy!</i>

221
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:57,987
Tommy...
- Where's mommy?

222
00:21:57,988 --> 00:22:00,281
Huh? Where's mommy?

223
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:02,116
<i>My wife's dead,</i>

224
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:05,579
Mars, the door,

225
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:24,890
You really should listen to your brother,

226
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:27,976
Shit!
- What are you doing?

227
00:22:27,977 --> 00:22:29,978
I told you to stay in the fucking truck,

228
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:36,276
Dennis, man, you can't do this,
- I told you, don't use my fucking name,

229
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:39,153
Where are the keys?
- Keys?

230
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:41,114
Where are the fucking car keys?
- In my office,

231
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,573
Office, Go, Come on, let's go,

232
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:45,785
All right,
It's gonna be OK,

233
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:49,247
I like your shirt,

234
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:53,251
By the way,
Carol's answering a silent alarm,

235
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:55,920
Says there's a suspicious vehicle out front,

236
00:22:55,921 --> 00:23:00,383
All right, Let's get her some backup,
See who's in the area,

237
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:04,638
Bristo 23 and 29er, 15 requesting backup,

238
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:08,766
<i>Ruiz, Kovaks, are you out there?</i>

239
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:13,021
Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.

240
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:16,441
Bristo 23 and 29er,
15 requesting backup.

241
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,652
Louise, what's the address on that alarm?
I'm gonna go check it out myself,

242
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:22,238
Daddy, just give them the keys,
- I'm gonna give them the keys, honey,

243
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,531
<i>I just need to be certain...</i>

244
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,659
What is that? What the fuck is that?
- The front gate,

245
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,620
It's a cop, Dennis, it's a cop,
- Shit!

246
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:32,248
It's OK, I know her, Just be cool,
- Shit, shit, shit, shit!

247
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,584
It's OK, I can just...
- Shut the fuck up!

248
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:38,212
Calm down, OK? I can talk
to the police officer from here using that,

249
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:44,928
I can tell her that everything's fine,
Then she'll go, and then you can go,

250
00:23:53,646 --> 00:23:55,021
<i>Hello?</i>

251
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:59,484
Afternoon. This is Officer Flores
with the Bristo Camino Police Department.

252
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:02,528
We're answering a silent alarm,
Is everything OK in there?

253
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,823
I'm sorry. We must have
accidentally tripped the alarm.

254
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:08,576
I understand, sir,
These things happen all the time,

255
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:11,120
But there's an abandoned
pickup truck on your street,

256
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,497
Have you seen who it might belong to?

257
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:16,292
Oh, no, it's not abandoned. There's
a guy here fixing the air conditioning.

258
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,211
<i>I'm sure everything's OK,</i>

259
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:20,129
<i>Could you come outside, please?</i>

260
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,133
Say something,
- Officer, my son's got a fever,

261
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:27,136
I've got the pediatrician on hold. Do you
really need me to come down there?

262
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:31,808
15, please respond.
- Bristo base, this is 15, Come back,

263
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:35,311
Carol, be advised
there's a felony want on that red pickup.

264
00:24:35,312 --> 00:24:42,569
The vehicle's suspected of being involved
in a carjacking last week in Valencia...

265
00:24:56,292 --> 00:25:00,045
Mars! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking shit!

266
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:17,145
<i>Shit!</i>

267
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:20,857
Code three!
I'm taking fire, I'm taking fire!

268
00:25:20,858 --> 00:25:23,276
Get on the fucking couch!
I gotta fucking think, man,

269
00:25:23,277 --> 00:25:25,987
Fuck! Shit,
- Dennis, in my desk I have contacts

270
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:28,364
for lawyers and judges,

271
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:31,993
I can help you get out of this, Dennis,
- Fuck! Don't say my fucking name!

272
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:34,704
No! No!
- Dennis! Dennis! Dennis!

273
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:36,122
Stop it!

274
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:40,084
Daddy, no! Daddy, wake up!

275
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:43,505
Fuck you,

276
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:47,133
<i>Flores is down. Flores is down!</i>

277
00:25:47,134 --> 00:25:51,096
Heads down, heads down,
I'm coming up to...

278
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,021
Hector, you all right?
- Jesus!

279
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,735
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

280
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:08,112
They ran your truck, dawg,
They know we've been jacking cars,

281
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:10,490
Shit,
- Attention, you in the house.

282
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:14,410
This is Chief Talley
of the Bristo Camino Police Department.

283
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:18,289
I'm gonna bring my car closer
so I can evacuate the injured officer,

284
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,627
I am not coming in the house,
I repeat: I am not coming in the house,

285
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:24,420
Do not shoot me,

286
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:27,883
<i>Do not shoot at me.</i>

287
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:34,681
Carol, come on, Give me your hand,

288
00:26:34,682 --> 00:26:36,224
Hang on, Come on,

289
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:39,102
Come on,

290
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:43,690
Just hang on, Hang on,

291
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,780
<i>Hey,</i>

292
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:38,244
Pull yourself together,
Put this in the back of one of the cars,

293
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,706
Go on,

294
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:50,506
<i>ETA on the sheriff is 15 minutes.</i>

295
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:55,303
Deputy in charge is Captain Shoemaker,
negotiator is Wil Bechler.

296
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:56,512
<i>Thanks, Louise,</i>

297
00:27:56,513 --> 00:27:59,265
Truck's registered
to a Mary Anne Kelly of Agua Dulce,

298
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,934
We're still trying to track her down,

299
00:28:00,935 --> 00:28:04,854
But a neighbor told us she lives with
her two teenage boys, Dennis and Kevin,

300
00:28:04,855 --> 00:28:10,819
And the neighbor also told us
that Dennis has some juvenile history,

301
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,363
<i>You're gonna go to jail,</i>

302
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:15,198
You're all gonna go to jail,
- Enough!

303
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,699
Why won't you just leave us alone?
- Tie 'em up,

304
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,369
Tie 'em up with what?
- I don't know, Just figure something out,

305
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,120
Tie 'em up, Go upstairs, Let's go,

306
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:23,206
I'm not leaving my father,

307
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:28,294
I'm gonna take care of him, I'm gonna get
some ice for his head, maybe a pillow,

308
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:31,214
It's OK,
- Come on, let's go,

309
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:34,676
<i>Let's go,</i>

310
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:46,896
Yeah?

311
00:28:46,897 --> 00:28:53,195
Since you're answering the phone,
I'm going to assume this is Dennis.

312
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:56,823
I'll take that as a yes,

313
00:28:56,824 --> 00:29:00,535
This is Jeff Talley, Dennis,
I'm with the local police,

314
00:29:00,536 --> 00:29:02,495
You the man in charge in there?

315
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:05,331
Yeah, I'm in charge,

316
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:06,749
<i>All right.</i>

317
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,210
Then you can tell me who shot my cop,

318
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:14,508
Was it you, or Kevin?
- No... no, don't put that on us,

319
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:17,510
I want to talk to Mr, Smith for a minute,

320
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:20,138
I want to hear from him
that everything's OK inside the house,

321
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:23,975
Fuck you, I'm running this shit,

322
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:26,102
You talk to me,
- That's right, Dennis.

323
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:28,438
<i>You are running this shit.</i>

324
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:32,191
Tell me you're the man in charge, that'll
be your responsibility. You understand?

325
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:35,486
Fuck you.
Don't try and play me.

326
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,864
You get us a helicopter
to fly us out of this shit.

327
00:29:37,865 --> 00:29:39,616
I'm just a local paper-pusher, Dennis,

328
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:42,368
Get me a fucking helicopter
before I start shooting people.

329
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:45,831
Be cool, Dennis, Be cool,

330
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,042
Nobody wants to hear guns go off in there,

331
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:53,588
You tell me you didn't shoot my cop?
All right, I believe you,

332
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:56,299
But nobody's gonna be able to help you
if you start hurting people in there,

333
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,927
You understand?
- Just get me what I want.

334
00:29:59,928 --> 00:30:04,224
I'm not the guy, Dennis,
- Then get me the guy!

335
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:13,149
Louise, come back,
- Go, Chief.

336
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,694
Confirmed the entire Smith family
is inside the house,

337
00:30:16,695 --> 00:30:20,574
along with two suspects, possibly a third,

338
00:30:30,834 --> 00:30:34,296
You want a hit?

339
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:41,970
OK,

340
00:30:52,106 --> 00:30:55,108
Can't get out this way,
- We can't get out this way, either,

341
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:56,943
Hey, Dennis, Dennis,
- What?

342
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:58,194
Dennis,
- What?

343
00:30:58,195 --> 00:31:00,822
That cop... Mars just started shooting,

344
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:02,740
You know what, Kevin? Mars had a reason,

345
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:03,700
Had a reason?
- Yeah,

346
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:07,662
Dennis, you've known that guy,
like, three weeks, and he just shot a cop,

347
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:09,372
Whose fault
do you think that was, Kevin? Huh?

348
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:10,498
He shot a cop,
- Huh?

349
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,918
Maybe you should've stayed in the truck,
If you'd listened, you could've warned us,

350
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,634
You could've lied to the cop, Done
something other than fucking this shit up,

351
00:31:24,346 --> 00:31:26,723
There's no way out up here,

352
00:31:26,724 --> 00:31:29,559
Hey, you guys
gotta come see this shit,

353
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,478
Kitchen, Driveway,

354
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:35,941
And office right there,

355
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:41,863
Holy shit,

356
00:31:47,703 --> 00:31:50,079
... apparently
a hostage situation is unfolding.

357
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,711
We have no further information,
other than the pictures that you see here.

358
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:16,064
Fuckin' rich people,

359
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:31,788
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

360
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:35,250
This is bad, No, this is bad!

361
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,391
Fuckin' rich people,

362
00:33:00,943 --> 00:33:04,404
<i>Put it back,</i>

363
00:33:05,572 --> 00:33:07,824
Claustrophobic?
- Try fuckedophobic,

364
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:11,286
Mars, Mars, Kevin,

365
00:33:19,003 --> 00:33:22,464
Fucking check this out,

366
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:09,219
Hi. This is Walter Smith. You've reached
my voice mail. Please leave a message.

367
00:34:15,517 --> 00:34:18,853
We have a problem,
I can't get to the accountant,

368
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:21,230
I know, I'm watching it on TV,

369
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:24,859
We must get control of this situation,
We have nine hours until the hand-off,

370
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,986
Bristo Camino
has a very small police department,

371
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:30,323
so we have requested the assistance
of Ventura County Sheriff's Department,

372
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:31,741
<i>who will be here shortly.</i>

373
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:33,326
<i>Chief, we understand the dead officer...</i>

374
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:35,453
Would you stop it?
- We need to help Daddy,

375
00:34:35,454 --> 00:34:38,998
Shut up, Watch the TV,
That's the police, OK? They're gonna help,

376
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,917
We gotta cut the tape,
- Shut up,

377
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,837
Roll together, OK? Off the bed, Then, like,
maybe we can get what's under the bed,

378
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:48,257
Under my bed? What's under my bed?
- Your bong, We can break it,

379
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:51,845
What? You've been sneaking in my room?

380
00:34:55,933 --> 00:34:58,601
Come on, hurry, Faster, You gotta do it,
- I'm trying,

381
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:00,103
<i>Wait, shh,</i>

382
00:35:00,104 --> 00:35:02,272
Christ, What are you guys doing?
You didn't hear that?

383
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:03,773
All right, come on, Fight with me now,

384
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:06,276
Stop screaming, you little gerbil...
- Help! Help!

385
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:09,654
Jesus Christ, You're kidding me,
Are you kidding me?

386
00:35:09,655 --> 00:35:12,824
The kid... Cut him, yeah, Cut him,
The kid weighs, like, 30 pounds,

387
00:35:12,825 --> 00:35:16,119
Are you kidding me? Tie him up, OK?
Tie him up in his own room,

388
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,038
Please try doing it right, OK?
Please do it right,

389
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:20,290
You get the girl,
- It'll be OK!

390
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,752
Do it right without dickin' it up,

391
00:35:26,297 --> 00:35:29,758
What about my brother?

392
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:32,844
Don't worry about him,

393
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:35,680
You cold?

394
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:38,141
No,

395
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:40,143
I'm Marshall,

396
00:35:40,144 --> 00:35:42,395
What's your name?

397
00:35:42,396 --> 00:35:44,981
Jennifer,

398
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:48,443
Please,

399
00:35:56,785 --> 00:36:00,247
Please,

400
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:34,656
<i>... the situation is under control...</i>

401
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:39,828
Jeff Talley, Chief of Police,

402
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:07,165
Asked for the helicopter yet?
- Right from the jump,

403
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:09,626
Might want to get a minister
or a priest up here,

404
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:13,088
Like riding a bike, isn't it?

405
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:15,548
Want to talk to him?
- Robby!

406
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:19,010
Got me that dedicated line yet?

407
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:22,847
You miss LA?

408
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:26,685
Five minutes,
scout team, five minutes,

409
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:32,774
Speed dial one?
- Yeah,

410
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:40,531
Yeah?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley,

411
00:38:40,532 --> 00:38:44,744
I'm gonna introduce you to Wil Bechler
from the Sheriff's Department,

412
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:46,996
Are you ready to talk to him?

413
00:38:46,997 --> 00:38:49,624
<i>Is he the guy?</i>

414
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:53,378
Yeah, Dennis, This is the guy,

415
00:38:53,379 --> 00:38:55,129
Hang on,

416
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:58,592
Good luck, I'll see you around,

417
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:04,931
Captain Shoemaker? Captain?

418
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:06,516
Thank you for coming up,
- Thanks, Jeff,

419
00:39:06,517 --> 00:39:10,562
Anything you need, give me a call,
- Got it,

420
00:39:48,475 --> 00:39:51,185
<i>... apparent hostage situation is unfolding.</i>

421
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:55,773
Well, Jim, details are still a bit incomplete
right now, but here's what we know so far.

422
00:39:55,774 --> 00:40:00,069
Earlier today, a police officer
was shot and killed while in...

423
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,405
Hey, How you doing? It's me,

424
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:05,199
You guys almost home?

425
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,910
<i>Actually, we're still at your place.</i>

426
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:11,331
After you left, Amanda and I,
we had another fight,

427
00:40:11,332 --> 00:40:15,960
She turned on the TV.
We've been watching it all.

428
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:18,379
<i>Well...</i>

429
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,923
I turned it over to County,
so I'm not there anymore,

430
00:40:20,924 --> 00:40:25,428
Look, I know you're busy,
but can you stop by for a little bit?

431
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:28,598
I think I can, yeah,

432
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,476
I have to go by Carol's,

433
00:40:31,477 --> 00:40:33,728
She had a kid,

434
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:36,272
<i>It's not your fault she's dead, Jeff.</i>

435
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:39,609
<i>You know?</i>

436
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:42,862
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

437
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:46,324
Yeah,

438
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:53,206
So, what was the argument about?
- Oh, you know. What it's always about.

439
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,875
She's afraid we're gonna get divorced,

440
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:59,045
<i>What do you think, Jane?</i>

441
00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:01,839
<i>You think we're gonna get divorced?</i>

442
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,134
No.
- Good, Me neither,

443
00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:09,722
So, I'll see you in a minute,
- OK.

444
00:41:09,723 --> 00:41:11,641
Say hi to Amanda,
- I will.

445
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:15,103
OK,
- I love you.

446
00:41:23,862 --> 00:41:27,324
Whoo!

447
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:42,422
<i>Drive,</i>

448
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:19,727
I know you're scared, but as long as
you don't do anything stupid,

449
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:23,774
we're not gonna hurt you,
Do you understand?

450
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:26,943
What do you want?

451
00:43:26,944 --> 00:43:32,532
I want you to put your hands
on the roof of the car,

452
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:48,507
Pardon me,

453
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:57,015
Now, would you mind putting your left
hand through the steering wheel, please?

454
00:44:01,478 --> 00:44:04,063
Now bring me the right,

455
00:44:04,064 --> 00:44:07,526
Good,

456
00:44:08,652 --> 00:44:11,195
Good,

457
00:44:11,196 --> 00:44:14,365
Now the guy behind you
is gonna take hold of you,

458
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:19,412
Don't struggle, It's for your own good,
Please,

459
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:28,296
Eyes in the rearview mirror, Now,

460
00:44:30,174 --> 00:44:33,802
Daddy!
- Jane! Amanda!

461
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:52,320
I know, I know, I know,

462
00:44:52,696 --> 00:44:55,365
But at least they're still alive,

463
00:44:55,366 --> 00:45:00,162
From this point on,
you control what happens to them,

464
00:45:02,081 --> 00:45:05,208
Can we let you go?

465
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:08,670
Can you be calm?

466
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,511
Good, Good,

467
00:45:19,723 --> 00:45:25,478
Now, listen to me, I want you
to go back to Walter Smith's house,

468
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:31,067
There's a DVD inside Walter Smith's
house that belongs to me,

469
00:45:31,068 --> 00:45:32,735
I'm no longer in command,

470
00:45:32,736 --> 00:45:38,032
You are going to reassume command
until my people arrive to finish the job,

471
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:41,869
You're not gonna let anyone
go into the house or anything come out,

472
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,455
Are you with me so far?

473
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:47,583
How am I gonna do that?

474
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:52,923
You... are the famous Jeff Talley,

475
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:57,802
Ten years SWAT,
seven years prime hostage negotiator,

476
00:45:57,803 --> 00:46:01,223
You'll figure it out,

477
00:46:03,142 --> 00:46:08,896
When this white phone rings,
it'll be me with further instructions,

478
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:13,109
If you deviate from the plan one little bit,

479
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,195
I will kill your wife,

480
00:46:16,196 --> 00:46:19,658
And then I will kill your child,

481
00:46:20,284 --> 00:46:25,163
But when I have what I want,
you get your family back,

482
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,627
Here,

483
00:46:30,628 --> 00:46:34,964
Now, you wait until our van is gone
before you uncuff yourself,

484
00:46:34,965 --> 00:46:38,426
Let's bring this home, Talley,

485
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:40,863
Yeah?
- We have a boy on the line.

486
00:47:40,864 --> 00:47:43,533
<i>And he says he's Tommy Smith.</i>

487
00:47:43,534 --> 00:47:45,410
I was gonna turn him over to the Sheriff's,

488
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:49,163
but he says he saw you on TV
and he wants to speak with you,

489
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:52,041
All right, Louise. Put him on.
- Hold on,

490
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:55,545
You're the man on TV?
- Yes, Tommy, this is the man on TV,

491
00:47:55,546 --> 00:47:57,630
The guy called Dennis hit my dad,
and now he's...

492
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:00,341
Slow down, slow down, slow down,
Slow down, Tommy, Slow down,

493
00:48:00,342 --> 00:48:02,218
I'm really, really scared,
and you gotta help us.

494
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:05,305
Slow down and take it easy,

495
00:48:05,306 --> 00:48:07,098
Was your dad shot?

496
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,892
Dennis hit him
a bunch of times with his gun.

497
00:48:09,893 --> 00:48:11,853
He hit my dad.
- Tommy, Tommy, Tommy!

498
00:48:11,854 --> 00:48:14,814
He needs a doctor.
- Try and talk quietly, OK?

499
00:48:14,815 --> 00:48:16,524
Just take it easy,
- OK.

500
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:19,152
All right,
Are you in a safe place?

501
00:48:19,153 --> 00:48:22,614
I'm in my bedroom.
They think I'm tied up, but I got free.

502
00:48:22,615 --> 00:48:26,784
Wait, Tommy,
How do you know they can't hear you?

503
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:30,288
'Cause I can see them
on the security channel.

504
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:33,041
Tell me everything you can see on the TV,

505
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:35,126
I see Dennis,

506
00:48:35,127 --> 00:48:37,462
I see Kevin,

507
00:48:37,463 --> 00:48:39,255
I see trees,

508
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:42,717
<i>I see army men.</i>

509
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:45,762
I see... the Mars guy...

510
00:48:45,763 --> 00:48:49,224
<i>Wait, Tommy.</i>

511
00:48:50,643 --> 00:48:52,852
Tell me about Mars,

512
00:48:52,853 --> 00:48:55,313
Captain Shoemaker?
- Get me an aerial shot ASAP,

513
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,397
This is Shoemaker,

514
00:48:56,398 --> 00:48:58,274
They're watching you
on the outside cameras.

515
00:48:58,275 --> 00:48:59,067
<i>Chief Talley?</i>

516
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:01,235
The suspects inside the house
are watching you,

517
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:03,988
They're watching every move you make,
- Where did you get this information?

518
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:10,036
If I were you I'd be thinking about
what to do with that information,

519
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:15,500
Mikey, Yeah, it's me, Listen to me,

520
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:17,961
Yeah, Chief,

521
00:49:17,962 --> 00:49:20,838
Yeah, the snipers are shifting positions,

522
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:23,466
<i>Louise? Louise, come back,</i>

523
00:49:23,467 --> 00:49:25,969
Come on, Louise, Where's that patch?
- I'm locked out.

524
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,137
It's a dedicated line, Chief,
They won't let me cut in,

525
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:30,807
What about Walter Smith's cell phone?
Did you get that?

526
00:49:30,808 --> 00:49:33,059
<i>Uh... yes. Yes, I got it.</i>

527
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,646
OK, go,
- It's 805-459...

528
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:40,775
Dennis, you know what I'm hearing?
I'm hearing your dad's a real son of a bitch,

529
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:42,568
<i>No, we're fucking done, OK?</i>

530
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:45,822
All I want is my fucking helicopter
to fly me the fuck out of here,

531
00:49:45,823 --> 00:49:47,156
You got that, fuckhead?

532
00:49:47,157 --> 00:49:50,619
<i>Dennis, listen, I...</i>

533
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:58,001
Hi. This is Walter Smith.
You've reached my voice mail.

534
00:49:58,002 --> 00:50:01,463
Shit,
- Please leave a message.

535
00:50:04,258 --> 00:50:07,761
Come on, Dennis, Pick it up, Come on,

536
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,701
He keeps ringing,

537
00:50:49,386 --> 00:50:52,055
Hello?
- Dennis, this is Jeff Talley.

538
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:55,892
Listen to me, Watch the security channel,

539
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:57,268
<i>Dennis, can you hear me?</i>

540
00:50:57,269 --> 00:50:59,896
Yeah, I don't really know
what you're talking about,

541
00:50:59,897 --> 00:51:01,689
The hell you don't!
Shut up and listen to me!

542
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:05,568
Just watch the TV.
Just keep watching the outside cameras.

543
00:51:05,569 --> 00:51:07,236
Yeah, what am I supposed to be seeing?
- Shut up!

544
00:51:07,237 --> 00:51:10,406
Get your ass on the floor
and watch the outside cameras, Dennis,

545
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:13,869
I'm watching, OK? I'm watching,

546
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,581
What?

547
00:51:18,582 --> 00:51:22,043
What? What are they doing?

548
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:26,506
What?
- Talk to me, Dennis.

549
00:51:26,507 --> 00:51:30,259
Yeah, Yeah, I'm here,
- Listen to me. Listen to me carefully.

550
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,428
The Sheriff's playbook
is to make you dead.

551
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:33,972
First they're gonna
shoot out those cameras,

552
00:51:33,973 --> 00:51:35,890
and then they're gonna shoot you.
Am I clear?

553
00:51:35,891 --> 00:51:38,351
What are you talking about?
- I'm trying to save your life!

554
00:51:38,352 --> 00:51:42,814
I don't understand what...
- Shut up! I'm trying to save your life.

555
00:51:42,815 --> 00:51:44,941
But you said you weren't the guy,

556
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,776
<i>I am the guy, Dennis,</i>

557
00:51:46,777 --> 00:51:50,238
<i>I am the guy.</i>

558
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:03,376
TAC sergeant,
pull your people back 50 yards,

559
00:52:03,377 --> 00:52:05,628
Hold it, You turned
authority of this situation over,

560
00:52:05,629 --> 00:52:07,463
I'm reassuming command,
What are you waiting for?

561
00:52:07,464 --> 00:52:09,632
Disregard,
You don't give orders to my men,

562
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:12,468
Now, ten minutes ago you called and
told me to shoot out the cameras, Now...

563
00:52:12,469 --> 00:52:15,805
You shot out the cameras?

564
00:52:15,806 --> 00:52:19,475
I give you great intel like that and you
just piss it away? Way to go, big time,

565
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,561
I am not gonna let you step back in
after you stepped out,

566
00:52:21,562 --> 00:52:22,770
This is my town,
- Captain Shoemaker!

567
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:24,314
I invited you into my jurisdiction,

568
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:27,483
Dennis says he doesn't trust me anymore,

569
00:52:27,484 --> 00:52:29,986
Says he's gonna shoot a hostage
if he doesn't talk to Talley,

570
00:52:29,987 --> 00:52:32,363
right now,

571
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:34,532
The name of the shooter
in the house is Mars,

572
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:36,784
You're gonna want to
run that through your database,

573
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:39,162
Your next question is:
How did I get that information?

574
00:52:39,163 --> 00:52:44,918
The little boy in the house called me
on his sister's cell phone,

575
00:52:56,805 --> 00:53:00,267
Chief?

576
00:53:01,518 --> 00:53:04,980
Chief? You OK?

577
00:53:05,189 --> 00:53:08,650
Go on back up top, kid,

578
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:33,341
Hey, Dennis, it's Jeff,
Everybody OK in there?

579
00:53:33,342 --> 00:53:39,389
We're buggin' in here, man,
- I know. I know. I'm trying to help.

580
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:43,142
Dennis, I really need
to talk to Walter Smith,

581
00:53:43,143 --> 00:53:46,605
Smith's not talking,

582
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:51,693
Is Smith not talking
because you won't let him?

583
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:54,237
Or is he not talking because he can't?
- It's not my fault.

584
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:56,906
I've hit people harder
and they haven't fallen!

585
00:53:56,907 --> 00:53:58,366
<i>I know. I understand.</i>

586
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:00,743
You're under a lot of pressure in there,

587
00:54:00,744 --> 00:54:04,789
But come on, man,
I just saved your life, and you know it,

588
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:09,210
All I'm asking
is that you help me save his life,

589
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:12,672
Come on,

590
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:19,846
He wants me to give up the old man,

591
00:54:19,847 --> 00:54:21,764
Yeah, Yeah,

592
00:54:21,765 --> 00:54:25,768
It's your spin,
- Yeah, Good idea,

593
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:29,731
It's not a wise move,
We don't have enough information,

594
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:31,441
Look, I want to help,

595
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:34,777
But I am not gonna let you
do something that draws fire on my men,

596
00:54:34,778 --> 00:54:38,615
You want to help me? Turn the lights off,

597
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,911
Get the bird out of here,

598
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:48,291
Please,

599
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:58,343
Mikey, I'm behind the command post,
Come on up here, will you?

600
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:01,804
I'm for breaking all the rules -
but one,

601
00:55:01,805 --> 00:55:05,642
Now, Dennis already broke it off with me,
If you get shot, we are all...

602
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:09,104
I'm trying to save a life, Wil,

603
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:11,606
Yeah, Chief?

604
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:14,275
Who we got on EMTs, Mike?
- There's, like, seven units,

605
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:16,194
Names, Mikey, Names,
- OK, Uh...

606
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:19,572
There's Hoffman, there's Latona,
Ridley, Jackson...

607
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:23,201
Ridley, Get Ridley up here,
Tell him to strip,

608
00:55:23,202 --> 00:55:24,577
OK,
- You too,

609
00:55:24,578 --> 00:55:27,163
Wait...

610
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:30,792
Me too what?
- Strip, You're driving,

611
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,263
Sniper one to Control,
Ambulance is 20 yards from the gate,

612
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:47,726
<i>No activity.</i>

613
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:18,006
Oh, shit,

614
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:39,569
Come on,

615
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:45,742
He's MOI, Let's load and go,

616
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:47,577
OK, On three, Ready?
- Yeah,

617
00:56:47,578 --> 00:56:50,246
One, two...

618
00:56:50,247 --> 00:56:53,708
<i>Three,</i>

619
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,431
Bang,

620
00:57:15,105 --> 00:57:18,567
Come on,

621
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,780
<i>Go, Mikey, go,</i>

622
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,794
Mike, stop right here,
- What, Chief?

623
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:41,256
<i>Stop the goddamn ambulance!</i>

624
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:44,634
Everybody OK?
- Jeff, what are you doing?

625
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:46,469
We're gonna wake him up,
- What?

626
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:48,096
We're gonna wake him up,
and you're gonna do it,

627
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:51,140
He's fixed and dilated,
He could have brain damage, for all I know,

628
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:52,642
We're going to the hospital,
- Wake up,

629
00:57:52,643 --> 00:57:54,060
Hey, Jeff...
- Wake up, Smith,

630
00:57:54,061 --> 00:57:56,187
What the hell are you doing?
- Get your fuckin' hands off me!

631
00:57:56,188 --> 00:57:57,438
You want me to write this up? Do you?

632
00:57:57,439 --> 00:58:00,024
I'll put this in the report...
- Goddammit!

633
00:58:00,025 --> 00:58:03,069
Give him the smelling salts,
Give him a shot of epinephrine,

634
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,697
I need him for one minute,
I gotta ask him one question,

635
00:58:05,698 --> 00:58:08,616
He can't answer you!

636
00:58:08,617 --> 00:58:10,785
Then just give him the drugs,

637
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:14,247
I am not gonna give this man a shot,

638
00:58:15,082 --> 00:58:17,166
Jeff, Jeff!

639
00:58:17,167 --> 00:58:20,920
Get your gun, then,
Get your gun and pull the trigger,

640
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:23,840
Goddammit, I need your help!
- Do you want to kill him?

641
00:58:23,841 --> 00:58:28,553
Go ahead, kill him,
Come on, Come on, That what you want?

642
00:58:28,554 --> 00:58:31,097
I want your help, Bob,

643
00:58:31,098 --> 00:58:33,850
No, Jeff, No,

644
00:58:33,851 --> 00:58:37,312
What you're doing can kill this man,

645
00:58:38,022 --> 00:58:41,483
<i>Fuck,</i>

646
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:48,906
What you've been seeing
is footage taken only minutes ago.

647
00:58:48,907 --> 00:58:51,576
We're not yet sure exactly who
the rescued hostage is,

648
00:58:51,577 --> 00:58:53,494
<i>but it appears to be an adult male.</i>

649
00:58:53,495 --> 00:58:56,414
If our sources are correct,
it could be Walter Smith,

650
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:58,207
<i>owner of the home...</i>

651
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:00,585
Smith is on his way to the hospital,

652
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:02,378
<i>Smith worries me.</i>

653
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:04,464
He knows his place in the food chain,
He'll be good,

654
00:59:04,465 --> 00:59:07,383
And so do we.
If we don't deliver that DVD,

655
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:09,969
<i>we're going to need the accountant alive.</i>

656
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,682
Now get somebody over there
and make sure we don't lose him,

657
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:18,353
<i>Visiting hours are now over.</i>

658
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,982
Triage,

659
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:28,738
Someone at the information booth
is asking for Walter Smith,

660
00:59:30,324 --> 00:59:33,785
Hello?

661
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:37,956
I need to ask if you're
a member of the Smith family,

662
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:40,083
I'm sorry, but I'm only
permitted to inform you

663
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:42,085
that Mr, Smith was deceased on arrival,

664
00:59:42,086 --> 00:59:44,170
and that all other inquiries
must be made tomorrow morning

665
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:45,672
through the county coroner's office,

666
00:59:45,673 --> 00:59:48,716
<i>If you'd like, I could give you the...</i>

667
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:52,179
Hello?

668
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:30,758
Shit,

669
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:33,553
You good?
- Hell, no, I'm not good, Jeff,

670
01:00:33,554 --> 01:00:37,640
The man needs a hospital,
Damn, man, what the hell's going on?

671
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:41,144
It's not just his life you're saving,

672
01:00:46,692 --> 01:00:53,698
Stay off the radio, You want to get
in touch with me, call me on my cell phone,

673
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:01,956
What?
- Did I not say

674
01:01:01,957 --> 01:01:04,375
<i>nobody was to go in or out of the house?</i>

675
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:05,960
<i>Now Smith is dead.</i>

676
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:09,505
What do you care if Smith's dead?
You said all you wanted was a DVD,

677
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:14,677
Dumb fuck. You wait for my people
or I will cut your daughter's heart out.

678
01:01:14,678 --> 01:01:17,055
Fuck you,

679
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:19,974
Go ahead, Kill my family,

680
01:01:19,975 --> 01:01:21,643
Kill me,

681
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,270
But before you do,
I'm gonna get in Smith's house,

682
01:01:24,271 --> 01:01:27,106
I'm gonna box up
all that dead motherfucker's DVDs,

683
01:01:27,107 --> 01:01:29,192
and you and the feds
can bid on 'em on eBay,

684
01:01:29,193 --> 01:01:32,654
How's that, smart fuck?

685
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:37,116
I guess we still need each other,
don't we?

686
01:01:37,117 --> 01:01:38,993
Yeah,

687
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:41,371
I guess we do,

688
01:01:41,372 --> 01:01:44,875
<i>This isn't Los Angeles, Jeffrey.</i>

689
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:51,256
You don't want another dead child
on your conscience.

690
01:01:51,382 --> 01:01:53,800
<i>Now we're almost home, you and me.</i>

691
01:01:53,801 --> 01:01:57,470
<i>So keep your shit together.</i>

692
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,681
Yeah,

693
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,143
You too,

694
01:02:06,897 --> 01:02:10,358
Fuck,

695
01:02:11,402 --> 01:02:15,405
Hey, We take the Benjamins,
we use the rope, we climb up over the rock,

696
01:02:15,406 --> 01:02:20,159
That's so stupid, They got
helicopters, They got night vision and shit,

697
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,954
Don't be a dumb-ass,
We're not gonna walk out the front door,

698
01:02:22,955 --> 01:02:24,872
How you gonna
get the Benjamins up the rock?

699
01:02:24,873 --> 01:02:27,875
What are you gonna do?
You've done nothing! Do something!

700
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:30,253
You think we're gonna
get out of this? Are you crazy?

701
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:35,883
Then do anything, Anything!
Do something, Kevin, Huh? Something,

702
01:02:35,884 --> 01:02:41,181
I want to hear your plan,
Please, tell me your plan, Please,

703
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:46,436
Burn it,
- What?

704
01:02:46,437 --> 01:02:49,355
The house, We burn it,

705
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:54,736
Lots of smoke,
Helicopters can't see through smoke,

706
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:02,494
What about the brother and sister?

707
01:03:03,746 --> 01:03:07,207
Huh?

708
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:11,461
Huh? What about the brother and sister?

709
01:03:11,462 --> 01:03:14,923
You're not killing any more people,

710
01:03:22,806 --> 01:03:25,975
Classic foster product,
At three years old, Marshall Krupcheck

711
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:29,103
witnesses daddy kill mommy,
then sees daddy kill himself,

712
01:03:29,104 --> 01:03:31,856
You can guess the rest, Look at this,

713
01:03:31,857 --> 01:03:33,775
He was only 17 at the time,

714
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:37,529
The clerk, he's trying to say something,

715
01:03:41,575 --> 01:03:45,036
He's saying, Help me,
- Yeah,

716
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:51,835
Why is he standing there?
Why is he just standing there?

717
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:59,926
He's not just standing there,

718
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,762
He's watching him die,

719
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:06,224
<i>We're talking to the wrong guy,</i>

720
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:42,052
<i>It sucks your mom died,</i>

721
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,724
My mom, she just...

722
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:51,144
She just walked out on my old man,

723
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,610
And he just, like... died,

724
01:04:58,819 --> 01:05:02,280
He died of a broken heart,

725
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:33,228
I know you're scared,

726
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:38,692
But I'm scared too,

727
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:47,534
You want some?

728
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,562
What's the best day of your life?

729
01:06:16,355 --> 01:06:19,816
You don't know?

730
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:23,403
Mine's today,

731
01:06:52,516 --> 01:06:55,476
That's my girl,

732
01:06:55,477 --> 01:06:58,939
That's my girl,

733
01:07:01,525 --> 01:07:03,651
Go, Louise,
- It's Tommy Smith again.

734
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,737
Yeah, put him on,

735
01:07:05,738 --> 01:07:08,239
Tommy,
you're talking to Chief Talley.

736
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,658
Hey, Tommy, How you doing, buddy?

737
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,660
OK.
- Where are you?

738
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,164
I'm in my secret place.
- Where's your secret place, Tommy?

739
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,458
<i>It's kind of like this tunnel place.</i>

740
01:07:18,459 --> 01:07:20,668
Got plans on the house yet?
- I found it above my...

741
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,503
Tommy... Tommy, listen to me, buddy,

742
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:25,131
What exactly is in your secret place?

743
01:07:25,132 --> 01:07:27,675
Has it got, like,
pipes and wires running through it?

744
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:30,970
Yeah,
- He's in the crawlspace,

745
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:33,640
Where does your secret space lead to,
Tommy?

746
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:35,850
Like, everywhere,

747
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:38,937
Chief Talley?
- Yeah, I'm still here, Tommy,

748
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:42,858
Dennis... he found my daddy's Benjamins,

749
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,735
What's a Benjamin?

750
01:07:45,736 --> 01:07:49,155
A Benjamin
is a hundred-dollar bill, Tommy,

751
01:07:49,156 --> 01:07:51,491
How many Benjamins
does your daddy have?

752
01:07:51,492 --> 01:07:55,078
<i>Two big bags,</i>

753
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:58,498
Chief Talley?
- Yeah, Tommy?

754
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,377
Is my daddy gonna be OK?

755
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:07,256
Yeah, son, A good friend of mine
is watching over him,

756
01:08:07,257 --> 01:08:10,551
Tommy, I need you to go back
to your room right now, OK?

757
01:08:10,552 --> 01:08:11,636
OK,

758
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:14,555
Did you turn your sister's cell phone
on vibrate like I told you?

759
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:16,599
Yeah.
- Good boy,

760
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,018
<i>Wait for me to call you back, OK?</i>

761
01:08:19,019 --> 01:08:22,481
OK,
- All right.

762
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:25,608
I gotta get better plans to this house,
- s

763
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:29,070
Where's Shoemaker?

764
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:34,117
Yeah,
- It's about Walter Smith.

765
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:37,537
What happened?
- He's awake.

766
01:08:38,038 --> 01:08:40,873
I gave him the shot,
- OK.

767
01:08:40,874 --> 01:08:44,336
<i>Thanks.</i>

768
01:08:46,672 --> 01:08:49,549
Mr, Smith, my name is Jeff Talley,

769
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:52,927
I'm the chief of police
here in Bristo Camino,

770
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:56,347
I've been talking to your son, Tommy,

771
01:08:56,348 --> 01:09:01,227
He's still inside the house,
along with his sister Jennifer,

772
01:09:01,228 --> 01:09:06,399
I know you know the kind of young men
they're dealing with,

773
01:09:08,986 --> 01:09:12,447
I need that DVD, Mr, Smith,

774
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,909
You know what I'm talking about,

775
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,746
You save my children,

776
01:09:19,747 --> 01:09:23,250
Of course I want to save your family,

777
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,383
But the only way I can do it
is if I get that DVD,

778
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:46,022
<i>Heaven Can Wait.</i>

779
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:48,691
Where is it?

780
01:09:48,692 --> 01:09:52,154
<i>Office.</i>

781
01:10:08,629 --> 01:10:09,712
Tommy,

782
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:12,966
You OK, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm fine,

783
01:10:12,967 --> 01:10:15,677
<i>Good.</i>

784
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:19,681
Tommy, I have to ask you
a grown-up question now, OK?

785
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,349
OK,

786
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,851
If you could do it safely,

787
01:10:23,852 --> 01:10:28,607
and only if you could do it safely,

788
01:10:29,984 --> 01:10:33,027
could you get into your daddy's office
without anyone seeing you?

789
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:36,072
I guess so, But my daddy says
I'm never ever supposed to go in there,

790
01:10:36,073 --> 01:10:38,199
Shh, Keep your voice down, buddy,

791
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,535
Keep your voice down, Remember?

792
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,997
<i>OK. OK.</i>

793
01:10:47,418 --> 01:10:50,545
Tommy, do you like to play video games?
- Yeah,

794
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,088
<i>Do you?</i>

795
01:10:52,089 --> 01:10:54,173
What kind of games do you play?

796
01:10:54,174 --> 01:11:00,471
I like Monster Jam,
I play Bounty Hunter, I play Wubba Zorg...

797
01:11:00,472 --> 01:11:03,725
Wubba Zorg, I know Wubba Zorg,

798
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,311
I know that game,

799
01:11:06,312 --> 01:11:08,771
That means you know
who Agent Zero is, right?

800
01:11:08,772 --> 01:11:11,733
<i>Yeah.</i>

801
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,819
What do you think
Agent Zero would do right now?

802
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:17,238
Do you think he would say
never ever, Tommy?

803
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,781
No, he wouldn't say never,

804
01:11:18,782 --> 01:11:23,328
Agent Zero would help Captain Wubba
save Planet Xenon,

805
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:27,916
Are you like Captain...
Are you like Captain Wubba?

806
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:31,252
<i>And my house is Planet Xenon.</i>

807
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,963
And Captain Wubba's
gonna save Planet Xenon,

808
01:11:33,964 --> 01:11:37,425
<i>Right?</i>

809
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:48,562
Yeah, Tommy,

810
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:52,524
Captain Wubba's
gonna save Planet Xenon,

811
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:54,525
<i>But I need your help.</i>

812
01:11:54,526 --> 01:11:57,528
Well, the most efficient entry point
is here, The pool area,

813
01:11:57,529 --> 01:12:01,491
Four-man team ropes in, Silent entry
through one of the skylights here,

814
01:12:01,492 --> 01:12:03,076
All right,

815
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:07,080
I put the doer and the two boys here in the
courtyard, I keep the two kids in the house,

816
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:11,125
How much time you need for the play?
- Two minutes,

817
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,378
Say you can get
the hostages to the pool area,

818
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:16,798
How are you gonna get all three suspects
to this side of the house?

819
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:21,595
Well, we're about to jump off that bridge,
aren't we?

820
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,725
Yeah?
- I'm coming up.

821
01:12:27,726 --> 01:12:30,853
What?
- You and I are gonna talk.

822
01:12:30,854 --> 01:12:34,274
<i>Make sure you're alone.</i>

823
01:13:05,973 --> 01:13:08,266
Dennis?

824
01:13:08,267 --> 01:13:11,728
Dennis?

825
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:15,189
What do you want?

826
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:18,610
You by yourself?

827
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:21,696
Yeah,

828
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,990
We got a problem, Dennis,

829
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:25,950
Oh, yeah?

830
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:29,329
Yeah,

831
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:32,791
Walter Smith just died,

832
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:38,921
Hear what I said?

833
01:13:38,922 --> 01:13:42,008
Yeah,

834
01:13:42,009 --> 01:13:47,889
I know Mars killed my cop,
but Smith's death is on you, man,

835
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:53,394
Things just got a lot more complicated,
didn't they, Dennis?

836
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:57,440
Not to mention the fact
that helicopters are very expensive,

837
01:13:57,441 --> 01:14:01,403
Gotta pay for the fuel, the pilot...

838
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,572
chief of police,

839
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,951
You know what cops do
when they retire, Dennis?

840
01:14:07,952 --> 01:14:10,286
They play golf,

841
01:14:10,287 --> 01:14:14,624
I don't want to play golf,
I hate fucking golf,

842
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:18,920
I want a house on the golf course,

843
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:22,382
I want that,

844
01:14:22,549 --> 01:14:26,428
Walter Smith talked to me before he died,

845
01:14:27,388 --> 01:14:29,305
I know about the money,

846
01:14:29,306 --> 01:14:33,184
I don't know shit about money, man, I don't
know shit about what you're talking about,

847
01:14:33,185 --> 01:14:35,270
I'm talking about a transaction,

848
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:40,358
You want a helicopter,
I want a house on the golf course,

849
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:46,614
Fifty thousand,

850
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,825
Maybe you can negotiate
with the sheriffs for that,

851
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:50,827
No, No!

852
01:14:50,828 --> 01:14:54,122
No,

853
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:57,584
Shit,

854
01:14:57,793 --> 01:15:00,378
Half,

855
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:03,840
I'll give you half, OK?

856
01:15:04,675 --> 01:15:09,053
That's, like... two million, OK?
Half is good,

857
01:15:09,054 --> 01:15:13,099
All right, Sell it to your crew,

858
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,560
Jennifer and Tommy stay in the house,

859
01:15:15,561 --> 01:15:18,688
The three of you
down here in the courtyard,

860
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:21,316
I'll trade the helicopter for the cash,

861
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:23,985
How do I know
the pilot's not gonna shoot me?

862
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,447
Let me worry about the pilot,

863
01:15:27,573 --> 01:15:30,908
You just make sure he gets that bag,
understand?

864
01:15:30,909 --> 01:15:33,578
Yeah,

865
01:15:33,579 --> 01:15:37,040
Half an hour,

866
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:07,446
<i>Heaven... Can... Wait.</i>

867
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:34,055
I'm the one who did this, I'm
the one who had the balls, I made the deal,

868
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,723
<i>Fine, Whatever, Just get us out,</i>

869
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,767
I'm getting us out, Kevin,
What do you think I'm doing?

870
01:16:37,768 --> 01:16:41,229
You're just making it worse,
- Look, I always take care of you,

871
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:43,064
Bullshit,

872
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,441
That's the way it is, Kevin,
Always has been and always will be,

873
01:16:45,442 --> 01:16:47,819
Always, OK?

874
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:50,905
What... What if they just want
to get us outside just to shoot us?

875
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,740
They could have killed us,
like, a million times, Kev,

876
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,867
But they didn't,
because Talley wants to get paid,

877
01:16:54,868 --> 01:16:59,164
Yeah, Get paid and then shoot us,

878
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,583
<i>We're leaving,</i>

879
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:06,046
Wait, Leaving where?

880
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:10,258
We're going on a helicopter ride,

881
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:13,219
No, No, I don't want to,

882
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:15,430
I'm not your girl,

883
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:20,060
I'm not going anywhere with you,
I'm not leaving...

884
01:17:30,362 --> 01:17:33,824
You're my girl,

885
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:39,287
And my girl comes with me,

886
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:44,500
Red team ropes in,
Upon entry, our packages should be here,

887
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:48,046
This indoor pool area, Any questions?

888
01:18:14,073 --> 01:18:15,823
It's all there!

889
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,409
Two million,
- OK, Let's go,

890
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,828
Where's...

891
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:25,083
What's this?
This wasn't what we discussed,

892
01:18:25,084 --> 01:18:27,210
This wasn't what we talked about,

893
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:31,130
Three people in the chopper,
That's all it can carry, Dennis,

894
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:35,176
I thought you were the man in charge,
Isn't that what you told me?

895
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:38,388
You said, I'm the man,
- I am the man! I am in charge!

896
01:18:38,389 --> 01:18:40,682
Prove it,
- Mars, leave her!

897
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:43,351
Jenny and I aren't going nowhere,

898
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:47,188
Dennis, The man that owns
this house is a criminal,

899
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:50,149
So are his friends,
This money belongs to them,

900
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:52,860
You want more money?
- They'll come after you and fuckin' kill you,

901
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,028
You want more fucking money?

902
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,155
You just chose
the wrong house on the wrong day,

903
01:18:56,156 --> 01:18:57,532
I'm not lying,
- Bullshit,

904
01:18:57,533 --> 01:19:01,452
The only thing
I lied to you about was Smith,

905
01:19:01,453 --> 01:19:03,997
He's not dead, You didn't kill anybody,

906
01:19:03,998 --> 01:19:06,416
That means that you and your brother
can still beat the hard shit,

907
01:19:06,417 --> 01:19:10,003
Just walk out of here with me,
Put those guns down and walk out now,

908
01:19:10,004 --> 01:19:12,130
Come on, don't let him fuck this up,
- Dennis, it's fucked,

909
01:19:12,131 --> 01:19:14,007
They're gonna shoot us
as soon as we get through the gate,

910
01:19:14,008 --> 01:19:15,633
You're lying to me!
- Shoot him,

911
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:18,886
What the fuck is that?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

912
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,389
Shoot him!

913
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:22,807
I'm gonna turn around,
- You will not,

914
01:19:22,808 --> 01:19:24,892
I'm gonna turn around
and walk out of here,

915
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:28,438
And I will call you on the phone,
- Dennis, come on, Come on, Den,

916
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:32,651
Shoot him!
- Dennis, Dennis, don't,

917
01:19:40,117 --> 01:19:42,243
We can go,
- Let him go,

918
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:44,329
Fuck you,
- Come on, Kevin, Come with me,

919
01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:45,913
Grab the bags,
- Come on,

920
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:48,875
Get the goddamn bags,
Get the bags!

921
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:51,210
God damn it, Dennis!

922
01:19:51,211 --> 01:19:55,006
Dennis...
- I am in charge,

923
01:19:55,007 --> 01:19:57,759
<i>Please, please, we need help!</i>

924
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,595
Please help us!

925
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:01,929
No, please! Please!

926
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:05,434
No, please! Help! No!

927
01:20:10,648 --> 01:20:12,732
Stand down, Stand down,

928
01:20:12,733 --> 01:20:16,194
Kids are in the house,

929
01:20:30,084 --> 01:20:33,545
<i>I fucking hate you.</i>

930
01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:47,850
I want to go,

931
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:50,270
Please,

932
01:20:50,271 --> 01:20:53,732
I want to go,

933
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:02,323
I'm your brother,
- I said I've fucking had it,

934
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:07,454
I'm your brother!
So you gotta choose, Me or Mars,

935
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:16,254
I choose the money,

936
01:21:16,255 --> 01:21:18,631
Oh, You choose the money,

937
01:21:18,632 --> 01:21:22,093
You choose the money?

938
01:21:28,601 --> 01:21:32,062
What do you think of that?
- Done?

939
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,540
Chief Talley,

940
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:55,501
The situation
has clearly gotten away from you,

941
01:21:55,502 --> 01:21:57,420
Your flagrant disregard for protocol

942
01:21:57,421 --> 01:22:01,549
has unnecessarily placed yourself
and my officers in the line of fire,

943
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:07,722
My opinion? You remain in command,
there's a probability of a negative outcome,

944
01:22:07,723 --> 01:22:09,515
Jeff!

945
01:22:09,516 --> 01:22:12,060
What are you doing?
- No, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff,

946
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:15,897
You've just made it easier, Chief,
You're done, You're finished,

947
01:22:15,898 --> 01:22:22,446
Chief Talley? The FBI's here at
the barricade and they're asking for you.

948
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,261
Where's Chief Talley?

949
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,472
Laura Shoemaker, Sheriff's Department,
I'm in command,

950
01:22:49,473 --> 01:22:52,267
Are you Talley?

951
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:55,186
Walter Smith and his family are witnesses
under federal protection,

952
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:59,649
Chief, the US government would like to
thank you for your service and cooperation,

953
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:01,442
Chief, move, now,

954
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,653
Chief Talley is no longer in command here,

955
01:23:03,654 --> 01:23:07,115
This is a federal matter now, ma'am,

956
01:23:07,825 --> 01:23:11,286
Get in,

957
01:23:34,602 --> 01:23:38,063
That would be the white phone,

958
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,281
Ah...

959
01:23:56,290 --> 01:24:00,084
Yeah,
- You're almost home, Talley.

960
01:24:00,085 --> 01:24:04,589
All you have to do is stay put
and leave the rest to my men.

961
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:08,301
When they recover the DVD,
you recover your family.

962
01:24:08,302 --> 01:24:11,763
Counterfeit feds,

963
01:24:12,222 --> 01:24:14,515
Must be very expensive,

964
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:16,267
<i>Maybe they're real,</i>

965
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:18,102
<i>and maybe not.</i>

966
01:24:18,103 --> 01:24:22,065
<i>The less you know, the better for you.</i>

967
01:24:49,468 --> 01:24:52,929
Don't fucking touch me,

968
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:09,029
Look, when all this shit's done, it's just
gonna be you and me again, OK, Kev?

969
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:16,203
And with this kind of cake...

970
01:25:16,287 --> 01:25:20,916
I mean, rich people
always got a way out, you know?

971
01:25:24,461 --> 01:25:27,255
Come on, let me see how bad it is,

972
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:30,049
Kev,

973
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:32,260
God damn it, there are kids in that house,

974
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:35,013
Turn this into a smash-and-grab job
and people are gonna get killed,

975
01:25:35,014 --> 01:25:38,266
You have your instructions, I have mine,
We'll leave it at that,

976
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:43,063
Come any closer to the house
and your family is dead,

977
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,135
It's over,

978
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:17,597
I'm taking them and going,

979
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,850
OK,

980
01:26:20,851 --> 01:26:23,353
You gotta go, huh?

981
01:26:23,354 --> 01:26:26,815
Go,

982
01:26:40,788 --> 01:26:41,955
Shit!

983
01:26:41,956 --> 01:26:43,831
Shit, Shit,

984
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:46,000
They shot him, They shot him,

985
01:26:46,001 --> 01:26:51,965
I'm sorry, Kevin, I'm really sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

986
01:26:52,925 --> 01:26:54,258
Shit!

987
01:26:54,259 --> 01:26:57,470
Mars, they shot Kevin! Mars!

988
01:26:57,471 --> 01:27:00,223
Dennis,
- Mars?

989
01:27:00,224 --> 01:27:02,892
Please, do something, Please,

990
01:27:02,893 --> 01:27:05,186
Please, please, please...

991
01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:08,648
I am,
- What?

992
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,573
<i>Come on, hurry!</i>

993
01:27:58,574 --> 01:28:00,491
Hurry, please!

994
01:28:00,492 --> 01:28:03,578
Come on, hurry! Faster! Come on!

995
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:07,040
<i>Hurry, Hurry!</i>

996
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:12,838
Tommy! Run, Tommy, run!

997
01:28:18,469 --> 01:28:20,553
Shoot him, Tommy! Shoot him!

998
01:28:20,554 --> 01:28:24,015
Shoot him!

999
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:31,856
Tommy, shoot him! Shoot him!

1000
01:28:31,857 --> 01:28:35,485
Shoot him, Tommy! Shoot him! Shoot him!

1001
01:28:40,449 --> 01:28:42,784
Do it,

1002
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:46,246
Please, Do it,

1003
01:28:54,588 --> 01:28:58,049
Safety first,

1004
01:29:02,846 --> 01:29:06,308
Come on!

1005
01:29:08,435 --> 01:29:11,897
Come on, come on! Follow me!

1006
01:29:16,193 --> 01:29:19,654
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1007
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:29,080
Come on, Tommy,
Pick it up, kid, Come on,

1008
01:29:29,081 --> 01:29:30,999
Come on, Tommy, pick it up,
- Chief Talley?

1009
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,334
Who are you talking to?
- Tommy, where are you?

1010
01:29:33,335 --> 01:29:35,837
He's coming!
- Run away!

1011
01:29:35,838 --> 01:29:38,506
Tommy, Tommy, can you hear me?

1012
01:29:38,507 --> 01:29:41,968
<i>Answer me, Tommy.</i>

1013
01:29:42,052 --> 01:29:45,514
Go faster, go faster,
- Come on,

1014
01:29:47,683 --> 01:29:51,478
Come on, This way,

1015
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:57,692
Oh, Jesus,

1016
01:29:57,693 --> 01:30:00,028
No!

1017
01:30:00,029 --> 01:30:03,949
Come on, you've gotta go faster!
Come on!

1018
01:30:03,949 --> 01:30:07,410
Go, go! He's coming,

1019
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:12,165
Tommy!

1020
01:30:34,772 --> 01:30:36,731
Tommy, answer me,

1021
01:30:36,732 --> 01:30:40,193
<i>Answer me, Tommy!</i>

1022
01:30:46,742 --> 01:30:50,454
It's OK, He can't see us,

1023
01:30:50,996 --> 01:30:54,458
He can't see us,

1024
01:31:05,302 --> 01:31:08,889
Oh, my God,
Oh, my God! No! No!

1025
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:24,172
Christ!

1026
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:04,105
Chief Talley!
- You did very good, You did really good,

1027
01:34:04,106 --> 01:34:05,273
OK,

1028
01:34:05,274 --> 01:34:07,942
Jennifer, come on,
We have to leave right now,

1029
01:34:07,943 --> 01:34:09,944
Come on, Get that shower on in there, Go,

1030
01:34:09,945 --> 01:34:11,654
Get the shower on, get some towels wet,
- I found them,

1031
01:34:11,655 --> 01:34:13,906
Get 'em soaked,
Tommy, come on, Come on,

1032
01:34:13,907 --> 01:34:16,743
I've got your special movies,
- Oh, my God,

1033
01:34:16,744 --> 01:34:19,621
You were very brave,
But it's not over, right?

1034
01:34:19,622 --> 01:34:25,752
Go help your sister, We're still
in trouble, all right? Hurry, please,

1035
01:34:38,474 --> 01:34:41,935
Fuck!

1036
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:54,114
<i>Come on, come on, Get down,</i>

1037
01:34:57,993 --> 01:35:01,455
Gun - down,

1038
01:35:05,918 --> 01:35:09,379
Turn around, slowly,

1039
01:35:10,923 --> 01:35:13,007
Nobody leaves till I get what I need,

1040
01:35:13,008 --> 01:35:16,470
Just let 'em get to the front door,

1041
01:35:48,377 --> 01:35:51,838
Just let 'em go,

1042
01:37:04,703 --> 01:37:08,165
<i>Down, Get down!</i>

1043
01:37:24,139 --> 01:37:27,601
Come on,

1044
01:37:55,462 --> 01:37:58,256
Thanks for everything, man,
How bad?

1045
01:37:58,257 --> 01:38:00,550
You could be bleeding to death,
we wouldn't even know it,

1046
01:38:00,551 --> 01:38:03,469
<i>You gotta get to a hospital, Jeff, Now,</i>

1047
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:06,932
No time,

1048
01:38:09,518 --> 01:38:10,560
Yeah?

1049
01:38:10,561 --> 01:38:15,273
Do you know how bad you have
fucked this up? Your family is dead!

1050
01:38:15,274 --> 01:38:16,816
Shut up,
- They are fucking dead.

1051
01:38:16,817 --> 01:38:19,193
Shut up,
Just shut up and listen to this,

1052
01:38:19,194 --> 01:38:21,904
Fuck! Talk,
- It's me,

1053
01:38:21,905 --> 01:38:25,367
This is Walter Smith,

1054
01:38:26,869 --> 01:38:30,330
Now what?

1055
01:38:42,259 --> 01:38:45,720
Look out the window,

1056
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:12,580
Listen to me, I...
I don't even know who these people are,

1057
01:39:12,581 --> 01:39:15,041
Or what they do, I cook the books,

1058
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:19,796
You know, set up shell companies,
offshore accounts,

1059
01:39:19,797 --> 01:39:24,759
And then I would encrypt it onto a disk
and leave it at the drop point,

1060
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:28,221
I mean...

1061
01:39:28,514 --> 01:39:31,975
It was never face to face,

1062
01:40:58,646 --> 01:41:02,107
I want to see my family,

1063
01:41:38,644 --> 01:41:41,604
<i>Jane? Amanda?</i>

1064
01:41:41,605 --> 01:41:43,606
Shh, Shh,

1065
01:41:43,607 --> 01:41:46,859
It's OK, baby,

1066
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:50,906
We're gonna be out of here
in just a minute,

1067
01:41:55,286 --> 01:42:00,623
Now, only the famous Jeff Talley
could come up with a rig like that,

1068
01:42:00,624 --> 01:42:04,085
And I see you've taken a bullet,

1069
01:42:04,253 --> 01:42:08,506
Walter, you're looking
fairly banged-up as well,

1070
01:42:08,507 --> 01:42:12,302
How do I know you still have what I need?

1071
01:42:12,428 --> 01:42:15,305
Trinidad...
- Wait,

1072
01:42:15,306 --> 01:42:19,100
Go ahead,
- Trinidad Mercantile, Dominican Republic,

1073
01:42:19,101 --> 01:42:21,436
Uh... Michelangelo Sister Trust,

1074
01:42:21,437 --> 01:42:27,984
The account number's Brenda 65007265,

1075
01:42:27,985 --> 01:42:29,444
<i>... 65,</i>

1076
01:42:29,445 --> 01:42:31,946
Um... Um...

1077
01:42:31,947 --> 01:42:33,781
Dutch Antilles National...
- Shut up,

1078
01:42:33,782 --> 01:42:37,994
Dutch Antilles...
- Shut up, Walter,

1079
01:42:37,995 --> 01:42:40,079
You're good,
- OK,

1080
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,457
You can let 'em leave now, right?

1081
01:42:42,458 --> 01:42:45,251
Just let my family leave,
Walk 'em to the door,

1082
01:42:45,252 --> 01:42:48,713
I leave with 'em, Smith stays here,

1083
01:42:48,964 --> 01:42:52,425
Everybody's happy,

1084
01:42:57,222 --> 01:42:59,766
I haven't seen your face,

1085
01:42:59,767 --> 01:43:02,143
I haven't seen any of your faces!

1086
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:07,065
<i>I leave you alone, you leave me alone,</i>

1087
01:43:10,235 --> 01:43:13,488
You're negotiating?
Is that what this is, Talley?

1088
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:16,824
You're gonna wear me down?

1089
01:43:16,825 --> 01:43:19,494
I'm just trying to bring us all home,

1090
01:43:19,495 --> 01:43:24,832
Cut Walter loose, Send him over next
to me, and we will disappear into the day,

1091
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:27,418
Let them go,
I'll stay here, Just let them go,

1092
01:43:27,419 --> 01:43:31,339
You get this one thing: I don't bargain,

1093
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,384
I give, You take, That's it,

1094
01:43:34,385 --> 01:43:37,804
Cut him loose,

1095
01:43:45,062 --> 01:43:48,523
Good,

1096
01:43:48,857 --> 01:43:51,526
Hands, Hands up, in the air,

1097
01:43:51,527 --> 01:43:55,863
Oh, you're a fucking dead man,
You're a fucking dead man!

1098
01:43:55,864 --> 01:43:58,616
Thank you very fucking much,
He hasn't seen your face?

1099
01:43:58,617 --> 01:44:01,202
He's seen my face!
- My family hasn't seen his face,

1100
01:44:01,203 --> 01:44:03,288
What are you waiting for? Kill him!
- They didn't see his face,

1101
01:44:03,289 --> 01:44:04,414
Come on,

1102
01:44:04,415 --> 01:44:07,000
My family hasn't seen Walter Smith's face!
Just let 'em go!

1103
01:44:07,001 --> 01:44:10,378
Come on, what are you waiting for?
- Just let 'em leave! Just let 'em go now!

1104
01:44:10,379 --> 01:44:14,966
Goddammit, kill him!

1105
01:45:42,137 --> 01:45:45,599
<i>Daddy.</i>
