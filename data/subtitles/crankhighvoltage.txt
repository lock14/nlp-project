1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.000

2
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,960
In a story so bizarre...

3
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,599
...I can scarcely believe
the events I'm reporting...

4
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,000
...and yet corroborated
by a dozen eyewitnesses...

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,319
...a white male apparently fell
from the sky...

6
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,359
...above downtown
Los Angeles today...

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,799
...landed in the middle
of a busy intersection...

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,039
...destroying one vehicle
and hospitalizing its elderly driver...

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,920
...and was removed from the scene...

10
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,159
...before emergency personnel
could respond.

11
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,680
Without a body, the police have yet
to piece together events of a day...

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,680
...that can only be described
as implausible.

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,319
Reports of a body
landing in the Boyle Heights area...

14
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,120
...have yet to be confirmed,
and are being treated...

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
...as the bullshit they most likely are.

16
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,639
You big cock English.

17
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,639
Strong like horse.

18
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
Fuck that.

19
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
That's not so bad.

20
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,399
Nice.

21
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,680
Pick up, Eve.

22
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,159
The number you have reached
is not in service.

23
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,680
Fuck.

24
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,639
Shit.

25
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,720
You lost?

26
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,959
Nope.

27
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,839
Shit.

28
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,199
On your knees, Slim.

29
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,920
Okay, Chow Mein.

30
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,519
- Who do you work for?
- Fuck you, Chelios.

31
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,399
Fucking grunt.

32
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,080
You found me in quite an unpleasant
mood this morning, mate.

33
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Now, I'm gonna ask you this question
one time.

34
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,759
Who's gots my fucking
strawberry tart?

35
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,679
Capiche?

36
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,360
Just spit the fucking name out.

37
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,919
Johnny Vang!

38
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,639
Johnny fucking Vang?
Johnny fucking Vang?

39
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,480
- Good boy. Where?
- Cypress Social Club!

40
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,600
Cypress- Cypress Social Club.

41
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,240
Now, you're sure about that, ain't you?

42
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,440
Good boy. Thanks for coming.

43
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,360
Now, you can keep that.

44
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,000
Fuck.

45
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,879
Hello. Doc Miles.

46
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,960
Yeah, Doc, it's Chev.

47
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,120
Jesus H. Chelios.

48
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,559
You gotta be kidding me.

49
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Listen. I'm deadly
fucking serious, Doc.

50
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,200
These Triad motherfuckers
cut out my fucking heart...

51
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,399
...and put in one of those
artificial jobs.

52
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,559
You got an artificial heart?

53
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,799
You think I'm having a fucking laugh?

54
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,240
No, but you gotta admit,
it's a little out there.

55
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,799
- You take your fucking time, Doc.
- You don't have any time.

56
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,320
They're not designed to keep you alive
more than a couple of days.

57
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,399
- And don't do anything strenuous.
- Yeah, sure, Doc. No problem.

58
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,039
So, what's my next fucking move?

59
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,919
We gotta get a real heart put in you,
preferably your own.

60
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,600
- I'm on it.
- Okay, you're on it.

61
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,759
- Doc, Jesus fucking Christ!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

62
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,080
Let me- Does that thing
have a belt battery pack?

63
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
- Check.
- How many bars are showing?

64
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,360
- One.
- Shit. That's better than none, I guess.

65
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,159
Look, what they did you with
is an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

66
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,759
It's got an internal battery that'll
pick up once the belt battery dies.

67
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,600
It's like a reserve tank.

68
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,519
Once the internal battery takes over,
you got one fucking hour.

69
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,600
The internal battery
charges wirelessly...

70
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,360
...through a transcutaneous
energy-transfer system.

71
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:15,360
Two coils-
There's one internal, one external.

72
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,200
- that transmit via a magnetic force
across the skin...

73
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
...without piercing the surface.

74
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,840
The internal coil receives power
and sends it to the controller device.

75
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,559
Does this make any fucking sense
to you, Chevy?

76
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,039
It's fucking Greek, Doc.

77
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,080
Greek.

78
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,759
Look, you gotta keep your body
electrically charged...

79
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,480
- ... to keep that piece of shit pumping.
- Copy that.

80
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,240
- Hey, Chev?
- Yeah.

81
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,639
- I'm stoked you're alive, dude.
- I'll get back to you, Doc.

82
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,879
Yeah. Call me.

83
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,120
Fuck.

84
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Hey, hey, hey! That's a nice car.

85
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
Don't suppose you know where
the Cypress Social Club is, do you?

86
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,480
Man, fuck that shit, puto.
Let's race, ése.

87
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,240
Don't you tempt me, fucker.

88
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
What I need from you is directions.

89
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,559
Shit.

90
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,639
Damn, dog. You good, ése?

91
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,480
Tiger fucking Woods.

92
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,720
Never better.

93
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,519
Greatest day of my fucking life.

94
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,080
You couldn't point me in the direction
of the Cypress Social Club, could you?

95
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,440
Well, you ain't too far.

96
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,960
Go down Orange for, like, 2 miles,
and then you're there, homes.

97
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,000
You mind giving me a jump?

98
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,559
Just juice me.

99
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,039
Anybody know
where's the fucking Social Club?

100
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:36,159
Donde esta la Social Club?

101
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,240
Buenos nachos, white boy.

102
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,639
This is a fucking social club?

103
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,519
You Johnny Vang?

104
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,320
Go.

105
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,880
- Get lost, bitch.
- Fuck you.

106
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,880
- What?
- Where's Johnny Vang?

107
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
You looking to get your ass killed?

108
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,680
- Wrong expression.
- You ain't tapping my ass.

109
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,000
There you go, cupcake.

110
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,119
Fucking no balling
for me today, thanks.

111
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,920
There goes my ride!

112
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,759
What is that? Fucking cunt-onese?

113
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,920
I'd rather stick my dick in a blender.

114
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,960
Sticky me.

115
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,960
Hey!

116
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,200
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

117
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,480
Where?

118
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,000
Hey, dude, why do you run?

119
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,640
Wait for me!

120
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
Get out of the fucking car!

121
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,759
- Out!
- Get your own station wagon, asshole!

122
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,319
Get the fuck off!

123
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,680
Damn.

124
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,160
Fuck.

125
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,799
You taking it too fast with me.

126
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,759
- Which way?
- I want you to take it slow.

127
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,519
Which way?

128
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,680
Hey! Hey.

129
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,839
You didn't ask name.

130
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,839
Shut up a minute, for fuck's sake.

131
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,160
Where is he?

132
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,200
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

133
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,160
Motherfucker!

134
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,119
Baby.

135
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,200
Motherfucking Chelios!

136
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,359
You like sushi, Chinese man?

137
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:09,240
How the fuck am I supposed
to know what kind of "ese" you is...

138
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
...you slanty-eyed fuck?

139
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,400
Check it out.

140
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,279
Sushi.

141
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,440
Hey, Chico.

142
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,400
We can make a deal, huh?

143
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,160
Oh, yeah.

144
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,279
Come on. Come on.

145
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,119
My girl.

146
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,400
Eve.

147
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,920
Eve?

148
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,319
Here, baby.

149
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,839
Eve?

150
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,799
Chev?

151
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,200
Hey, I need you to take your
fucking hands off Lemon now, man.

152
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,440
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

153
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,039
Who the fuck are you?
You know this guy, Lemon?

154
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,039
Lemon.

155
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,799
You were dead.

156
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
I'm-

157
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,160
I'm so confused right now.

158
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,839
- What's that ticking sound?
- Yeah, what is that sound?

159
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You're kind of weird, tick-man.
It's time for you to go.

160
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
- Randy?
- Randy?

161
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,000
Come here.

162
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:48,079
Not you. Babe, it's-

163
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,359
Who the fuck is that?

164
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,319
Some whore.

165
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Fuck, no. Fuck.

166
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,000
- Look, she's helping me find my heart.
- What?

167
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,319
Go away. Come on, let's go.

168
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,759
Baby.

169
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,599
What?

170
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,759
Oh, you dozy cunt.

171
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,799
Baby-

172
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:24,119
No.

173
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,119
We need his ass alive.

174
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,440
Chev Chelios,
let's save some bullets, dude.

175
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,599
Put that away.
We've all had a drink.

176
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,920
Should I duck?

177
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,759
Yeah.

178
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,680
Shall we bypass the formalities?

179
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,839
Of course.

180
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,519
Who do you work for, and what
the fuck do they want with me?

181
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,960
El Huron.

182
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,279
English. Who's the fucking El Huton?

183
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,480
It's The Ferret.

184
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,200
He wants you alive,
so he can watch you die.

185
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,200
Oh, yeah?

186
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:58,880
- Why?
- I don't know.

187
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,000
Doesn't everybody?

188
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,920
Shut up.

189
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
You lucky bastard.

190
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,559
Eve, let's go.

191
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,640
Get on the floor now!

192
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Turn around.

193
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,680
Oh, it's on now.

194
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,440
- No! Stop! Stop!
- Put her down.

195
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,359
Stop it!

196
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,680
No!

197
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
Why didn't you call me?

198
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,359
Like fuck I didn't.
Didn't you get my message?

199
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,799
No. Where have you been
for the last three months?

200
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,039
I thought you were dead.

201
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,960
I fell a mile out of a helicopter,
that's all. True story.

202
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,759
No way. You know what?
That's totally possible.

203
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,519
I saw this video on YouTube...

204
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,839
...where this guy's parachute doesn't
open, he falls 14,000 feet...

205
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,160
...and he lives.

206
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,240
Yes, baby, I know it's possible,
because I fucking did it!

207
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,720
- Quit it.
- Since when were you on the Internet?

208
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,039
A lot of things have changed
since you died.

209
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,799
I didn't fucking die.

210
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Well, that's besides the point, isn't it?

211
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,720
Hey!

212
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:52,920
- Where are we going, Chev?
- I don't know.

213
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,200
I need to find that slob from the club,
the one with the red cooler.

214
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,480
Are you talking about Johnny Vang?

215
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,640
- You know Johnny Vang?
- I know his ass.

216
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,240
He's got the box with him all the time.

217
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
That box, I need it.

218
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,720
I can bet on my grandma's coochie
he's at the horse track.

219
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,039
Dude, you gonna put Johnny Vang
on ice?

220
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,920
- Maybe.
- That's so fucking sexy.

221
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,920
- Fucking dead.
- Didn't they cuff you?

222
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,519
Damn it. Do me.

223
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,759
I'll do you.

224
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,559
Bitch.

225
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,119
Atta girl. I gotta call Doc.
I need that cell phone.

226
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,279
Why didn't you just say it?
I have a cell phone.

227
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,200
Here.

228
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,519
You got a cell phone.

229
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,039
I got you, okay?

230
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,279
You gotta work for the things that-

231
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,000
- Chevy?
- I lost the belt battery, Doc.

232
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,880
- How long ago?
- Over an hour.

233
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,119
Jesus Christ. That's not fucking
possible, Chevy. You should be d-

234
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,759
Fuck it. Never mind. Look.

235
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,359
It's a wireless system, so any low-level
electrical shock to your skin...

236
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,599
...should juice it at least temporarily.

237
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:29,759
Hey, Chev?
I'm a certified heart surgeon.

238
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,400
Well, I was.

239
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,039
Lost my license after I fucked up
my ex-wife's...

240
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,920
...vaginal rejuvenation procedure.

241
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,400
That's irrelevant right now.

242
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,279
The point is, if you can get your heart,
I'm sure I can put it back in for you.

243
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,400
I'll be in touch when I find that Chinese
cocksucker that's got me pump.

244
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,480
Bet you even had
to choose between-

245
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,319
Chinese.

246
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,160
Sharon, I just shut down, okay?
I couldn't think. I couldn't feel.

247
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,160
Hey, Chocolate? Would you get
off your fat ass and get dressed?

248
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,240
Why?

249
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:06,359
Is Doc Miles gonna
have to choke a bitch?

250
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:09,960
You know that I was waiting
for those results too?

251
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,920
- I needed to put things in perspective.
- Oh, you needed? You needed?

252
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,799
I think I know who we're dealing with.

253
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,319
Hell no, we won't blow.

254
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,559
Hell no, we won't suck.

255
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,920
Hell no, we won't blow.

256
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:27,000
Hell no, we won't suck.

257
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:33,440
Move! Jesus. Shit.

258
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,039
What the fuck!

259
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,559
Shit.

260
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,279
That's right. You're gonna pay me!

261
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,720
We want to make a living.

262
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,720
You carry weapons,
we carry weapons in our pants.

263
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,200
We're sick and tired of this.

264
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,799
Pay me my fucking wages,
motherfuckers.

265
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,680
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

266
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,039
They need their money.

267
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,720
You want me to fuck this car?

268
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,480
- Suck my fucking tits.
- Get off the car.

269
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,480
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back.

270
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,240
- Hi.
- Give me my money.

271
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,720
We're sick and tired of this.

272
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,519
Just because it's porn
doesn't mean we don't wanna do it.

273
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,240
This is a weird scene. We've got
pissed-off beaver. I'm in pursuit.

274
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,119
Cunt.

275
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,680
Sit.

276
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,400
Good-

277
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:45,680
- I'm just making sure.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

278
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,680
Well, he's gotta know who's in charge.

279
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,119
Dude, come on.

280
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,559
- He's gonna eat somebody's baby-
- Chill.

281
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,400
- You're gonna get sued.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

282
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,240
Whatever. I wanted a cat.

283
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,880
Fuck.

284
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,119
- See? Way better than a cat, man.
- Whatever.

285
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,279
Who's this fucking asshole?

286
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,960
You pair of sausage noodles.

287
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,279
How do you sleep at night?

288
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,119
I'm from PETA.
This is animal cruelty, you fuckers.

289
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:18,160
- Give that back, you liberal freak.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,799
- Fucking shame on you two. I tell you.
- That's $250.

291
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,240
- Pair of cunts. Press the button.
- Take it back.

292
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,960
- Hit him.
- Listen-

293
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,079
- Disgusting.
- Morning.

294
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,920
Mom would be so proud.

295
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,640
- Sorry about that. Give me that thing.
- No.

296
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,680
Yeah, there you go. Go on.

297
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,680
You don't press that button,
you're going.

298
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,000
- I'm pressing it.
- Press it!

299
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,079
Come on, what's the matter?
Fucking wake up.

300
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,960
- Make him press the button, you-
- Give him the fucking-

301
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,079
- What are you, fucking useless?
- Hey!

302
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,000
Stop right there!

303
00:32:58,839 --> 00:32:59,839
Oh, shit.

304
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,640
See? He lost it. I told you.

305
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:11,519
Get him off!

306
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,799
Will our insurance cover that?

307
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,200
- Get down!
- Cover your head!

308
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,400
- On the ground!
- What the fuck is around your neck?

309
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

310
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,000
Kaylo?

311
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,519
- Get on.
- Both of you down on the ground now!

312
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,200
Kaylo, I thought you were dead.

313
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,839
My name's Venus. I'm from Hollywood.

314
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,240
Kaylo was my brother.

315
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,159
Brother? No shit.

316
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,639
Hey, what the fuck
did you hit me for anyway?

317
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,440
I have a condition.
FBT, Full Body Tourette's.

318
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,639
I can't control myself.

319
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,880
Jesus! Fuck!

320
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,280
God! What the-?

321
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,119
Motherfuck.

322
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,280
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about your brother.

323
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,760
I need to get to the
Hollywood Park racetrack...

324
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,599
...and I mean right the fuck now.

325
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,280
What's the matter,
you hurting or something?

326
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,639
- Is that where they're at?
- Who?

327
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,000
The sucker that killed my brother.
You're Chev "the cheese" Chelios?

328
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,320
The sickest motherfucker that ever
vaporized a motherfucker, right?

329
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,840
- Yeah. That's me.
- Yeah. So when you get those suckers-

330
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,559
Get a grip of yourself.
It's already done.

331
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,480
It's done.

332
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,599
I already took care
of the ones that did Kaylo.

333
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,079
- But- All of them?
- All of them.

334
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,440
D- E-A-D. Brown Bread.

335
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,760
- Right Said Fred?
- Simply Red.

336
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,480
I see.

337
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,159
Don't look so gloomy, Elvis.

338
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,800
I can assure you
they did not die pleasantly.

339
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,000
No. You don't understand.

340
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,840
It's a matter of honor.

341
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,679
It should have been me
to avenge my brother's death.

342
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Well, so long, Chelios.

343
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,320
My brain hurts.

344
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,760
There is one that I never got to,
on account of I could never find him.

345
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,840
- The one that calls himself The Ferret.
- El Huron?

346
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:54,079
- You know him?
- No.

347
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,000
- That means "the ferret" in Spanish.
- Right. Yeah, I knew that.

348
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,639
Listen, you want to find the dude that
made your brother dead, you find him.

349
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,880
Chev?

350
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,280
Racetrack.

351
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,039
You're here.

352
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,320
That you, Chelios?

353
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,320
- I'm running on empty, Doc.
- Same here, buddy.

354
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm gonna need to stick my dick
in a socket.

355
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,079
- I don't recommend that. But friction-
- Friction?

356
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,599
Yeah. Skin-on-skin contact
creates static electricity.

357
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,000
You're kidding me, right?

358
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:12,599
Dude, the friction of two like objects
causes a transfer of electrons.

359
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Science 101, Chevy.

360
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,840
Probably ditched that class. I did.

361
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,920
Find someone to rub against.
It's gonna help.

362
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,760
Well, it's not gonna hurt.

363
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,440
Terrific race.

364
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
That's a great horse, mate.

365
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,280
What the fuck, man?

366
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,480
- What the fuck?
- You did it.

367
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,000
Mate, that was all you.

368
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:57,320
Yo, man.

369
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,800
Fucking Doc.

370
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,280
Hey there, mister.
Somebody stop him! Stop him.

371
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,519
- Chev.
- No!

372
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,840
The horse! The horse!

373
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,119
Get out of there!

374
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,840
Please.

375
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,840
Hey. Wait, wait. Chill out.
He's just had too many drinks.

376
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:40,000
I got him. Okay?
Go about your business.

377
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,039
- All right.
- Honey, let's go.

378
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:44,039
- My heart.
- Oh, I love you too.

379
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,800
Honey, come on. Over here.

380
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,960
Are you okay?

381
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,960
Is it the Chinese poison?

382
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,360
Friction.

383
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,519
Doc said friction.

384
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,880
Chev.

385
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:12,239
Friction.

386
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,239
Friction?

387
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,719
- I'll give you friction.
- Yeah.

388
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,079
Yeah.

389
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,679
- Babe, what are you doing?
- I know how this game works.

390
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,239
- Oh, yeah. It's working, baby.
- Okay.

391
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,719
Yeah. Fuck.

392
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,079
Keep going, doll.

393
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,400
Rub it, baby.

394
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,599
- Yeah, rub it.
- Fucking good.

395
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,199
Rub it!

396
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:44,400
- Oh, my God. It's gross.
- Hey!

397
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,760
No.

398
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,679
Oh, baby.

399
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,239
Fuck, it's working, Eve.

400
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,719
Oh, smash it fucking good, babe.
Come on.

401
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,119
Come on, you motherfucker.

402
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,039
You fucking nailed it, Doc.

403
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,719
You fucking got it, doctor!

404
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,599
- I got it!
- Come on, doctor!

405
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,760
Come on, babe, let's switch.

406
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,480
Give the kitty some cream, baby.

407
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,760
Give the kitty some more cream.
Move your-

408
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,159
Fucking it!

409
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,000
I fucking love you. I love you so much.

410
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,199
Eve.

411
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,320
Stop!

412
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,480
Yo, help us out, man!

413
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,079
Door number 6.

414
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,400
Come on, man!

415
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,280
Fucking useless.

416
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800
Yeah?

417
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, you ain't no
Ralph Macchio yourself, Chev!

418
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:10,119
Go!

419
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,480
Oh, fuck!

420
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,400
Did I drop some change,
or did I hear a chink?

421
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,559
Oh, my God!

422
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,840
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck me?

423
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,400
Give me the fucking box!

424
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,760
Fuck you, Chelios!

425
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
Get in.

426
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:19,519
- Chev Chelios.
- Don motherfucking Kim.

427
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,039
So you pull my lily-white ass
out of the hot grease again.

428
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,800
Please, don't thank me.

429
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't think I shall. I'm not sure
if you're aware of this, Jeeves...

430
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:36,039
...but your slant-eyed associates
have taken something...

431
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,679
...of extreme value to me.

432
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,559
And I intend to get it back.

433
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,400
You know what you are,
Chev Chelios?

434
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,239
Tell me.

435
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,559
You are a shit magnet.

436
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,760
Your friend has the gay condition.

437
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,920
And now, where were we?

438
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,719
You were about to tell me
exactly who's got what I need and why.

439
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,159
You may have heard
of the name Poon Dong.

440
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,920
- Only in dirty limericks.
- The patriarch of our organization.

441
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,239
Said to be 100 years old.

442
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,880
Considered to be more god than man
by the Triad gangs.

443
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:35,199
But several months ago,
word had spread out...

444
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,760
...that Poon Dong
had taken gravely ill.

445
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,440
And without a heart transplant,
he only had a few days left to live.

446
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,639
- I see.
- Of course, that was unacceptable.

447
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,559
Many would have given their hearts...

448
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,920
...from their own breasts
to save the life of Poon Dong.

449
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:58,360
But not me. Fuck that.

450
00:45:58,559 --> 00:45:59,599
But many.

451
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,960
Then word spread out
that there was a man...

452
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:04,559
...who had a heart so powerful
that he was capable...

453
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,920
...of surviving even our most deadliest
of poisons.

454
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,079
- The Chinese shit.
- Yes.

455
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:18,880
It was you, Chev Chelios.

456
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,400
It was your heart that Poon Dong
chose to replace his own.

457
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,639
One more question.

458
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,119
Who the fuck is El Huron, The Ferret?

459
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,440
And how is he involved with all this?

460
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:33,400
The Ferret?

461
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:47,119
Let's just say our organizations
have a history of conflicting interests.

462
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,199
I see.

463
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,000
Well, it's mighty white of you
to help me out like this.

464
00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:53,599
Now, if you don't mind.

465
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,239
Who said I was helping you out?

466
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,199
My reward for returning you
to Poon Dong will be great.

467
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,280
- So this is how it is.
- This is how it is.

468
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:37,639
Chicken and broccoli.

469
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,280
- Dude, are you all right?
- Never better.

470
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,599
Fish Halman here, bringing you
breaking on-the-scenes coverage...

471
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,039
...of an explosion of mayhem,
and lewd behavior...

472
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,119
...that has swept the Long Beach area.

473
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,960
Our viewers may remember
a similar series of incidents...

474
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,960
...which took place
three months back...

475
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,719
...involving this unidentified man.

476
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,079
Police are now confirming
that today's events...

477
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,400
...are the work
of that very same psychotic deviant.

478
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:58,559
Ted Garcia is standing by
in Hollywood Park with a live report.

479
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:00,519
- Take it away, Ted.
- Thanks, Fish.

480
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,599
I'm standing here
with a group of people-

481
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,440
Families, seniors,
and degenerate gamblers.

482
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,039
- that are shocked and traumatized by
what they've witnessed here today...

483
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,199
...when what started as a sunny,
Southern California afternoon...

484
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,239
...at the races turned, without warning,
into a public, open-air porno.

485
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,920
Did you say porno, Ted?

486
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:20,280
Straight up, Fish.

487
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,199
I'd like you to meet Glenda Lansing
of Hawaiian Gardens.

488
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,800
Glenda says she had an all-too-
up-close-and-personal encounter...

489
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,599
...with the suspect just moments
before the shocking incident occurred.

490
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,599
That bastard had his filthy hands
all over me.

491
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,639
Can you describe exactly
what happened?

492
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,119
I never saw a bastard
who wanted it so bad.

493
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,840
He put his filthy hands
on every part of me.

494
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:46,880
Okay, that's a little too much
information for this broadcast.

495
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:49,079
Can you describe
the man that assaulted you?

496
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:51,639
He looked like that fella
from the movies.

497
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,679
The T-Bag.

498
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,159
T- Bag?

499
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,360
You know, the Trainspotted fella?

500
00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:01,039
- Built like a brick shit house.
- All right, ma'am.

501
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,159
You know that kind of language
is not gonna fly on TV.

502
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,559
That son of a bitch.

503
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,000
He treated me like his hot little whore.

504
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,400
Explain to me...

505
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,639
...how you let this motherfucker
get away.

506
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,559
He just went buck wild
and killed everybody.

507
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,960
But not you.

508
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:26,559
I just got lucky, eh?

509
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,400
You know the drill, bitch.

510
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,360
Do it.

511
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,599
Do it!

512
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,519
Now the other one.

513
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:41,480
You got yourself another chance.

514
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,480
I don't think you'll fuck it up next time.

515
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:47,679
Now go get yourself a Band-Aid.

516
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,119
And go get me
fucking Chelios, cabron!

517
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,639
That's the last time.
The last time that son of a bitch...

518
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,760
...leaves me with my ass in the wind
in front of 8,000 people!

519
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,119
- Lemon. Hey, hey, hey!
- Randy?

520
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,639
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

521
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,199
It's about the dude.

522
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,360
What dude?

523
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,000
- The asshole.
- What about him?

524
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:29,440
He's on every channel. The guy's
a fucking psycho killer, baby.

525
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,199
Every cop in this city's looking for him,
not to mention the fucking beaners.

526
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,039
- The fucking Orientals.
- So?

527
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,480
So? So?
So the heat's on the street...

528
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:39,599
...and that dude's
playing for keeps, baby.

529
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,039
I have no idea
what the hell you just said.

530
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:44,199
- Look. Lemon. Lemon, look.
- What?

531
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,920
I know we've all been down our
dark roads in the past, okay, babe?

532
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,519
I need my hair did, my nails did.
You ain't gave me no money.

533
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:54,320
Where you been at, Randy?

534
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:56,480
If I ever catch you with another bitch...

535
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:58,880
Well, you do got a big-ass dick
for a white boy.

536
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,519
Anyway, look, the point is,
you're my lady now, all right?

537
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:08,400
I don't think it's safe
for you to be out there with that-

538
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,559
That sick fucko running wild right now.

539
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,400
- You can say that again.
- Look, look.

540
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,840
Listen to me.
Here's what I think we should do.

541
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,800
- What, Randy?
- All right, I say we go to the fuzz.

542
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,719
We tell them everything.
We come clean.

543
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,800
- What?
- The fuzz, all right?

544
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,239
I mean, I'd kill this guy myself,
but I got two strikes against me.

545
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,360
- Let go of me.
- Look, baby.

546
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:31,920
All right? I'm trying to be cool to you,
but I will drop the hammer.

547
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,079
You want me to drop the hammer,
baby?

548
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,679
I'm in no mood today, Randy!

549
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,840
Lemon!

550
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,440
Freeze!

551
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:05,639
Hey!

552
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,440
Now, spread it.

553
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,800
All right, let's go.

554
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:14,960
Against the car.

555
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,320
Don't leave no skid marks, nigga.

556
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,719
- Work that ass, baby.
- Ride that shit, big sexy!

557
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,000
Put your arm up, son.

558
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,960
Eight seconds, nigga! Yeah.

559
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:52,000
Oh, my God.

560
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,679
- Hello.
- Orlando?

561
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,599
Venus! What is up, my man?

562
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,000
Where you been, man?
I ain't seen your ass since-

563
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:02,760
We was all of us broken up about what
happened to your brother. You okay?

564
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,920
- Orlando, I need your help.
- Venus, come on.

565
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:06,679
You my nigga. Can't get no bigger.

566
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,239
L.A. Underground,
we're like a family, man.

567
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,639
We a freak-ass family,
but we family, all right?

568
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,599
- We look out for our own. What?
- I'm looking for a man called The Ferret.

569
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,800
El Huron.

570
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,880
Shit.

571
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,559
Ferret?

572
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:30,199
Oh, great.

573
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,840
Hydrated, man! Keep him hydrated!

574
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,719
- Step on it!
- Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in.

575
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:42,000
Fuck.

576
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:43,880
This is an ambulance, you fuckhead!

577
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,039
Keep hydrating those organs!

578
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:49,719
- Hold it in!
- Jesus.

579
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,719
What are you doing?
This is an ambulance!

580
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,559
Right, motherfucker. I'm aware of that.
I'm in need of emergency services.

581
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,159
Yeah, we have got a guy
in the back of the ambulance!

582
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,679
Get him out of here, man.

583
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,000
- That's one of Don Kim's blokes.
- This man is in critical condition.

584
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,880
- Get out of here.
- I'm aware of that.

585
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:06,599
I'm the fucker that put him there.

586
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,880
- Now...
- Okay, he's got a gun!

587
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:10,920
- You're my physician.
- Okay.

588
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:14,079
I'm in need of an external lithium
battery belt...

589
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,400
...for an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

590
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,239
- Might you have such a thing?
- We're gonna lose it, Bronc.

591
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,920
- Please, look, this guy is fucking dying.
- Don't worry about him.

592
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,920
He's not gonna make it.

593
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,800
- Now, about my battery.
- Yeah, you said the Avicor TAH.

594
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,679
Yeah, we got it. But why?

595
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,599
- Holy shit.
- Chop, chop.

596
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,760
Okay.

597
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:47,079
- He's fucking dead, man.
- Do you mind?

598
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,679
- You ready for this shit?
- Do it then.

599
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,039
Turn the fucking thing on.

600
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:07,039
Feels like crack.

601
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:08,239
Yeah, but better.

602
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,320
You know, those things
aren't designed for strenuous activity.

603
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,440
Tell me about it.

604
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,280
- Stop the fucking ambulance!
- Dude, we got to go to the hospital.

605
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,760
Fuck!

606
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,920
Bing fucking Crosby.

607
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,880
Breathe out. Raise your buttocks
upward by first walking-

608
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:44,800
Come on, down with that doggie.

609
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,840
Down dog-

610
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,760
- Hello.
- Doc, I'm close.

611
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,760
So am I.
Chev, can this wait a second?

612
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,760
I think I've found that motherfucker
that's got my organ.

613
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,440
I think I got the skinny on that Triad
geezer from my girls on the street.

614
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,000
Old news. I'll get back to you
when I have the tart.

615
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:02,000
Chevy, wait!

616
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,519
Chev Chelios!

617
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,559
Fucking clowns.

618
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:55,239
Cunt!

619
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,280
It's completely normal
to be freaked out...

620
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,239
...when someone has a gun
at your head.

621
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,159
- I would have shit myself.
- I still have nightmares.

622
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,159
Everybody has nightmares.

623
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,360
The point is, by coming here
and talking with me...

624
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,079
...you made a choice
to confront your issues and lick them.

625
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,280
I can't even leave
my fucking apartment. I-

626
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,599
Every time I go up to leave the door,
I see the guy with the gun.

627
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,840
- I'm having a really bad day.
- Oh, shit.

628
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,800
Tell me you got epinephrine
in this fucking cart.

629
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,000
Think about it like this, Engleson.

630
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:32,679
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

631
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,119
You gotta go out and enjoy it.

632
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,800
Knock back a couple of beers,
hit a titty bar.

633
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,440
- Excuse me?
- Have some smelly snatch rubbed...

634
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:44,880
...in your face.
You gotta get out there, man.

635
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah. I've gotta do it.

636
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:49,280
I'm gonna go and tackle the world.

637
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,280
No, don't tackle the world.

638
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,880
Tackle a fucking whore.
Get your dick wet.

639
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:57,239
- Yeah.
- Dip your wick into life a little bit.

640
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,079
- Have some fun.
- Yeah.

641
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,480
I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna
floss my teeth with some pubes.

642
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:05,760
- Oh, now you're on it.
- Thanks, doctor.

643
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,280
- Oh, my pleasure.
- No, no, no.

644
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,639
The pleasure's all mine.

645
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,360
I'm done with fear.

646
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:14,719
My life begins today.

647
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,760
Fuck!

648
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,559
Hey, maybe we better call 911.

649
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,320
Where's my box?

650
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,159
Five more like that, and your brains
will be strawberry jelly.

651
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,280
You can't look in that box!

652
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,840
The key and the fucking combo.

653
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,360
No!

654
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:37,920
Do it.

655
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,679
That's better.

656
01:03:57,079 --> 01:03:59,519
This isn't my fucking pumper!

657
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,119
What is that?

658
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,400
What kind of sick freak carries
something like this around in a box?

659
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:13,360
I am shocked to my fucking core.

660
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:16,239
You've got some deep problems,
motherfucker.

661
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,159
What the fuck is that?

662
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:36,079
Fucking gotta come back
and fucking gotta find out...

663
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:37,599
...what the fuck is this?

664
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,599
What the fuck is-?

665
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,320
- Hello.
- Doc.

666
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:45,920
When you hung up on me, I was trying
to fucking tell you something.

667
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,079
Your heart was transplanted
three weeks ago...

668
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:49,760
...into that Shaolin motherfucker.

669
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,920
- Fucking great. Now what?
- I'm on it.

670
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:55,360
Poon Dong is still in L.A.
And if I'm right...

671
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:58,280
...he's got what you need in pristine,
working condition...

672
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,719
...beating inside his chest.

673
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,440
- Good. Where do I find him?
- Don't worry about it.

674
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:03,920
I got people on the street.

675
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,920
Good luck with that, Doc.
I'll try it my way.

676
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,440
Come here, you.

677
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:26,960
Up you get.

678
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,760
Okay, darling, one last dance.

679
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:33,559
Where's the fucking old man?

680
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:49,320
What old man?

681
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,679
Hey. Hey. I got 5 dollars
that says you blow me for 20 bucks.

682
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,679
Oh, stop. Stop right here.
Stop right here.

683
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,239
Hey, baby.

684
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,840
Hey.

685
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,559
- Hey, baby. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay, baby.

686
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:19,920
- Yeah?
- How you doing?

687
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:21,360
What you need?

688
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:24,679
You know what I need.

689
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,679
Come on. Come on, Daddy.

690
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,199
Fuck you, Chelios.

691
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,000
Tell me what he's like
when he's at home.

692
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,519
When he's home, he's like a ghost.

693
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,559
He just plays those video games
all day, all night.

694
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,880
- Video games?
- All day.

695
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:08,239
And you let him do that?

696
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:13,320
I mean, you did buy the games
for him, yeah?

697
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,760
Of course.

698
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,880
Why should I deny my son?

699
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,960
- How are you today, Chev?
- I'm golden, sir.

700
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:23,920
Your mom tells me that you've
been getting into quite a bit of trouble.

701
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,159
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

702
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,519
- Regretfully, that's true.
- What kind of trouble?

703
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,039
Fighting, talking back, pinching.

704
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:35,440
Pinching what?

705
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,440
Televisions, stereo components,
books from the library.

706
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,920
- That's not all.
- No, sir.

707
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:45,039
Also a till from a restaurant
and one car.

708
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:47,559
- A toy car?
- No, sir.

709
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:49,239
A BMW Z1.

710
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,840
Hey, sit.

711
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,039
People, people, all right.

712
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:58,559
I hear you've been having
quite a bit of trouble at school too.

713
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:05,400
Chelios.

714
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,079
Nothing I can't handle, sir.

715
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:16,039
- I have a lot of piss and vinegar.
- He's hyperactive.

716
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:17,239
Oh, shit, Mom.

717
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,560
You want to watch your
dirty little mouth, son.

718
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,880
- We tried giving him Ritalin, but-
- Chev?

719
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:23,800
I sold it.

720
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,439
With all this energy,
you've never thought about...

721
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,600
...I don't know, trying out for sports?

722
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:44,840
- I like to run.
- Chev, where's Dad?

723
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:48,560
I never met the wanker.
He died before I was born.

724
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:53,159
What do you think he'd say
if he saw you acting out like this?

725
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:54,399
Don't know, sir.

726
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,000
If he were here now,
and he asked you:

727
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:01,159
"Why the bloody hell
do you do the things you do, son?"

728
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,199
- What would you tell him?
- Don't know, sir.

729
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:06,680
- Bored, I guess.
- Bored, he guesses.

730
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,840
- Bored? Bored?
- Shut up.

731
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,800
We're gonna take a short break now.

732
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,600
And when we return,
we are gonna find out...

733
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,359
...what makes you tick, little man.

734
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,720
Hey.

735
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,239
You okay? Wake up.

736
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,079
Wake up.

737
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:18,079
Ria, baby.

738
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:20,199
What happened to you?

739
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,880
What are you doing out here?

740
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,039
What you out here for?

741
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:38,359
I'm looking for the man
that killed my brother.

742
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:44,199
Yeah.

743
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,720
I have to go.

744
01:10:57,359 --> 01:10:59,600
I might not come back.

745
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,640
Give the girls kisses
and hugs from me.

746
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,239
I kiss and hug all the pussy.
You go kill cocksucker.

747
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:21,840
Some boyfriend you got there,
Ms. Lydon.

748
01:11:22,039 --> 01:11:24,319
He lied to you
for six months regarding his work?

749
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:28,840
Which I guess wouldn't be such
a big deal if he wasn't a hired killer.

750
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,720
He made you a target
for the South American mob...

751
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,319
...for kidnapping, torture, or worse.

752
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:37,119
He sexually humiliated you
in front of what...

753
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:39,079
...I don't know, half of Los Angeles?

754
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:40,840
Twice.

755
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,159
Twice. And then left you there
to take the rap?

756
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:46,800
And now you can add an arrest
and a police record...

757
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,439
...to a list of wonderful things
Mr. Chelios has brought to your life.

758
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,800
Help me out here, sweetheart, okay?

759
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:58,079
Because-
Because I'm a little bit confused.

760
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:04,760
Why the fuck do you continue
to protect this asshole?

761
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,960
That's a dicky question.

762
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,199
Besides, I don't know
who you're talking about.

763
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,560
I mean, I'd like to see you fall
out of a helicopter and live.

764
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,199
What?

765
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,079
It looks like you made bail.

766
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,720
- Great. Can I have my stuff back?
- Yeah.

767
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,359
Yeah. Just a-
Just one little piece of advice.

768
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,039
Wake the fuck up
and smell what's burning.

769
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:30,760
Fuck.

770
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,880
Hola, Chev.

771
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:45,600
I take it you're the greasy fucker
that's been hunting me all day.

772
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,800
The Ferret.

773
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,159
Some people know me
by this fucking name.

774
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:53,399
And many men have died
cursing the name of El Huron...

775
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,079
...as they choked on their own blood,
and the blood of their families.

776
01:13:57,279 --> 01:13:58,920
Colorful geezer.

777
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:03,199
I was born with another name.

778
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:05,640
The name of my father.

779
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:10,239
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking hell.

780
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,479
And my father's father's.

781
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,119
We're all very sad.

782
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:18,439
And the name...

783
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:21,239
...that I share...

784
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:23,760
...with my two brothers...

785
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,039
...Alejandro...

786
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:31,920
...Ricardo...

787
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,600
Verona.

788
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:46,000
Oh, I can tell, while I dig, dig, dig...

789
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,880
...that you had no idea
that there was a third brother.

790
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:54,560
Nope. That fact escaped me.

791
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,880
What I assure you of, is I would have
made it a fucking hat trick.

792
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:00,479
I got a trick or three for you, cabron.

793
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,560
I'm gonna make you wish
that you was never a man.

794
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,800
If you want to kill me,
you get on with it.

795
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,800
What's the rush, Chelios?

796
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,920
I know someone
who's going to love to watch this.

797
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,760
You.

798
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,840
- You got the donor?
- Like you got a boner.

799
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,840
Hey, baby.

800
01:16:10,039 --> 01:16:13,119
You always say you want
to be more spontaneous.

801
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:14,760
Cowboy.

802
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,000
We gonna go back to my place.

803
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:18,960
- Yeah.
- That sounds good.

804
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,399
Ricardo never wanted
my money, Chelios.

805
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,600
He was too stubborn.

806
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,039
Wanted to make his own way.

807
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:32,720
Now I think he likes
what my money can buy.

808
01:16:33,319 --> 01:16:36,279
The technology to keep his brain alive.

809
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,319
Not forever.

810
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:41,720
But long enough to watch you die.

811
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:07,279
Yo, Ferret. This ain't Roots, man.

812
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:09,159
Yeah?

813
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:11,159
Hey, cabron.

814
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,159
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

815
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,000
You killed my brother, motherfucker.
Prepare to die.

816
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,199
Fuck you, Chelios.

817
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,760
This way, sugar.

818
01:18:58,039 --> 01:19:01,880
Confucius say, "Karma's a bitch. "

819
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,960
Hello, Ricky.

820
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:25,520
Why do we go on like this, Ricky?

821
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,359
Hurting each other.

822
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:30,960
Water?

823
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,439
Did you say water?

824
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,600
H20?

825
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,319
Coming right up.

826
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,640
Chev Chelios. Chev.

827
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,159
Chev.

828
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:22,479
Chev. Chev!

829
01:24:17,159 --> 01:24:18,960
Cut the battery.

830
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:20,880
Battery's out.

831
01:25:01,239 --> 01:25:02,560
Paddles. Give me the paddles.

832
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,800
What's going on?

833
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:09,800
Chevy? Clear!

834
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,720
Fuck!

835
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,079
- Shit!
- No! God! No.

836
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:18,880
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

837
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:20,920
What the fuck?

838
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:24,039
Jesus.

839
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:28,800
It's so hard to keep a straight face.

840
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,239
Sorry, Ches.

841
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:19,119
Stay on the marker!

842
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:21,119
- Let's go.
- Body parts ready?

843
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:24,079
- Yes.
- All right.

844
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:25,279
Here we go!

845
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:27,199
- And- You set there?
- Ready?

846
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:29,920
And action, Mike!

847
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:35,000
Andrew!

848
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:48,319
Go! Go, Lance! Run, Lance!

849
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:16,560
Action, Manny!

850
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:19,239
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

851
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:21,039
You think these muscles are free?

852
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:23,199
You think this cock's for free?

853
01:28:23,399 --> 01:28:26,520
No way! No scabs, no crabs!

854
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,840
No scabs, no crabs!

855
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,359
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back!

856
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,920
I'm gonna bang your prisoner!

857
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,279
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

858
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,000
Look at Jason and say it.

859
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:42,359
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

860
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,359
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

861
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,640
Yeah! Yeah!

862
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,479
Fuck you!

863
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,920
I take it you're the faggot
that's been hunting me all day?

864
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:56,079
No.

865
01:29:56,279 --> 01:29:57,800
The faggot.

866
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,600
The faggot. Oh, sorry. The Ferret.

867
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,560
No dough, no blow!
No dough, no blow!

868
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,319
Dicks like this don't come for free!

869
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,520
Lips like this don't come for free.

870
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,840
That's what I meant to say.

871
01:31:08,439 --> 01:31:11,159
I meant lips like this
don't come for free.

01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:12,720
All right, keep going.

873
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,279
Oh, a horse.

874
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,279
What?

875
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:23,399
I never had it that way before.

876
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,840
- Let us kiss for a second.
- Okay.

877
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,880
Yeah.

878
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:22,319
And here we go. And action!

879
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,760
Water.

880
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,479
Fuck, you need a few mints.

881
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,159
- Holy shit.
- Unbelievable.

882
01:35:07,319 --> 01:35:10,520

- Holy shit. Fuck.

883
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,520
That was fucking awesome.

884
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,960
- Let's cradle the balls on that.
- Good job, buddy.

885
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,039
- I'm sure we got it.

886
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:18,359
- Yeah.
- Good job, brother.

887
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,439
- You okay?
- Yeah.

888
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,720
Fuck, that was hot.
