Tony Fingleton: In australia in the 1950s,
Water changed that.
It kept you alive and safe...
At least for a little while.
I was about to swim the whole length underwater!
Why'd you do that?
We have to go and meet dad.
John: We don't have to if we don't want to.
I'm the oldest, and I said we go!
That's me--tony Fingleton.
I was the next-oldest after harold, jr.
Then came john, ronald, and diane.
Hi, mr. O'brien!
Our world was the pool, the wharves,
Our mother and our father.
Look! There's dad! Come on!
Dad!
Dad! Dad!
I was always a little afraid of my father.
From my earliest memory
There was nothing I could do that pleased him.
I just never connected with him.
So I fell between the cracks.
Hey, dad!
Look at you mob of rat bags.
How are ya?
Hello, dad. Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, dad! Dad!
Dad! Dad!
Throw it to me, dad! Dad, come on!
Okay, give me some distance. Kick it to me!
Dad! Dad!
Harold, jr: How's that, dad?
How'd I do, dad?
You're good.
Am I as good as you?
Oh, you'll catch up.
Diane: I'm tired.
Oh! You all right? Yeah.
Billie: Dora? Oh, there you are.
I thought you were gonna stop by
And have a cuppa with me.
Oh, I am, I'm just finishing the last load.
Uh-uh. You've chosen a great day to do this job.
I'll hand-deliver it.
Aren't you hot in that dress?
Kids: Hi, billie! Hi.
I brought you round a little something.
Oh, it's lovely.
There was an overrun at the factory.
Oh, thank you.
Diane, look at this.
That'd make a nice dress for you, eh?
I don't suppose I could convince you
To make a frock for yourself.
  yes.
How about that cuppa?
Diane: No, billie, dad's coming.
Oh, well, I'm on my way.
Heaven forbid your mum should have a friend to talk to.
Billie.
The materials... You know.
Oh. It's okay.
Stop by and have that tea when you can sneak out.
Hi, billie. Hey.
Hi, billie. Hey there.
Tony: Where's the football?
See ya, harold.
Harold, jr: Hurry up. Come on!
Did you manage to see the grocer?
Because, uh, it was a bit unpleasant yesterday.
It's okay. I paid him every penny.
Oh...That's good.
There was nothing left over,
So I couldn't get you anything...Special.
Harold, jr: Get out of the way. You're short.
Diane: I'm gonna get a bucket!
What's going on? It's their anniversary.
What's got into you?
I know you didn't get me a present.
Why don't you sing me a song instead?
Do you remember the one I sang
On the night we first went out?
No, I don't.
Well, I was drunk.
Uh-huh.
¶ when irish eyes ¶
¶ are smiling ¶
¶ sure it's like a moon-- ¶ hello.
I'm not gonna make a mug of myself in front of the kids.
It wouldn't be for the first time.
Diane: What are you doing?
He's singin' me a song.
Well, go on, dad, sing it.
  want some water?
¶ in the lilt of irish laughter ¶
¶ you can hear the angels sing ¶
¶ when irish hearts are happy ¶
¶ all the world seems bright and gay ¶
Come on, sweetheart.
¶ and when irish eyes are smiling ¶
You stood on my toes, you can sit down.
¶ sure they steal ¶
¶ your heart ¶
¶ away ¶
That's good.
That's lovely.
That's all. I'm gonna have a cup of tea.
Harold: I just don't understand what you're on about!
Tony: Dad's moods could swing wildly.
And those moods dominated our lives.
Don't go around telling people we can't pay our bills!
Dora: I just thought we could use some extra money.
You want more money, you go paint the bloody house!
Peace didn't last long.
Nope.
  ron.
We've got the pool all to ourselves.
I'm gonna break the water.
[all shouting excitedly]
Come on, ronald, get out of the way!
Whoa-ho!
  dora: I love that.
I love the minute waltz.
Come on, you poofter.
I'm playing this for mum.
Oh, goody. Saint tony.
Ahh-ohh!
You do what I want, or else.
Tony: Dad.
Dad!
Dad.
Dad.
Harold slammed my fingers in the piano.
Then he punched me right in the stomach.
Did you punch him back?
Well, give him a smack in the mouth.
But I can't.
Right, come on.
All right, touch gloves.
Now, keep 'em up in front of your face.
That's good. Now circle round each other.
Now move in. Left to the head.
Another one.
Good.
Keep your gloves up.
What are you doing? Hit him.
What are you crying for?
Ha! You are. You're crying.
I'm not.
You are now.
Don't worry about it. Get in there.
Oh, for christ's sake.
Get up!
I think he's better at football.
Mum! Come on, you little poofter,
Get up and fight! Don't be such a sissy.
I'm not a sissy. You are.
Come on, you little piano player. Huh? Saint tony?
Harold: Good duck. Yeah, into the kidneys!
Yeah! Good, harold. Ha ha ha ha!
Good! Good! That's it!
Give him a right. That's it!
Stop it! Harold, stop it, leave him alone!
Harold, leave him alone! Leave him alone!
Harold!
Are you mad?!
You want him to grow up to be a fairy? Oh, shut up, harold.
He's got to learn to defend himself.
You're always sticking up for him. Bastard.
You're far too overprotective. That's your trouble.
Get inside.
Come on.
Okay, drop me.
Duck.
  you're a champ.
If harold, jr. Felt like
The worst brother you could have,
John was the best.
Harold was a real bastard to do that to you.
And so was dad.
I wish I could be good at something. Anything.
At least better than harold at something. Maybe then.
Yeah, I'd like to see harold win book prize for best student.
Dad could care less about that, anyway.
I've made your breakfast, harold.
I've made your breakfast.
Is dad okay?
Hmm.
It's not your fault he's got no work, mum.
If you want to be alone, I've brought your breakfast in here.
You know what you can do with your breakfast.
That'd be a great waste of good food.
Get out and leave me alone. No. No.
I've gone to the trouble to make your breakfast for you,
You may as well have it!
Christ!
Jesus christ!
Ohh!
You cow!
Come here!
Dora! Dad, leave her alone!
Dad!
Come back in here, you cow!
Get off me, you little bastards!
Get off!
Diane: Dad! Dad!
Dad!
Dad.
What?
You got egg in your hair.
Have I?
Yes.
A-ha ha!
Okay. All right.
You got me.
You look gorgeous.
I know.
There's three new boats in the wharves, harold.
Looks like there's plenty of work for next month or so.
Well, thank christ.
Morning, mrs. Gilroy.
Well, I might have a bath, maybe a bit of breakfast.
Eggs and beans'd be nice. Want some, tommy?
Yeah, all right.
But if it's all the same to you, could I have mine on a plate?
Hey!
Come on in the house.
The way to dad's heart was to be good at sports.
I was no better at football than I was at boxing.
Hey, score any points in the game?
For the other team, maybe.
Harold: Bloody hopeless.
He did his best, harold.
Too much piano, I'd say, dora.
Dad, come swimming with us.
You never come swimming with us.
No, you kids are all right by yourself.
I hate the smell of chlorine.
Go swim with them. Come on, dad.
You fancy yourself as esther williams now,
Do you? Harold.
Got it!
I didn't bring a coin. Give me yours.
No, why should I?
'cause I said so.
Get your own!
What are ya? Huh? You little poofter!
[harold, jr. And tony arguing]
Poofter.
I'm not a poofter. Don't call me that, all right?
Do you always swim as well as that?
As well as what?
That.
Oh. Yeah, I guess.
It's good.
Oh, thanks. Well, we're here all day long.
We play around, you know.
Have you seen john? He's faster than me at free-style.
John.
Swim over here.
Harold: Get out.
Line up on the blocks.
Swim to the other end when is say"go."
I'm not swimmin' anywhere.
Who asked you?
Get on your marks...
Get set...
Go!
That's not too bad.
You should watch tony do the backstroke, dad.
Okay, show me.
You go with him, free-style.
Bloody hell.
I want both of you back here at five.
We're gonna do some training.
But I've got a piano lesson.
Not anymore, you don't. That's enough poofter stuff.
We're doing something serious.
All right, come on. Wake up.
Rise and shine. What time is it?
Twenty to 6:00. Time to get up.
The pool opens at 6:00, we're gonna be there to open it.
Ohh!
Good. Three seconds off yesterday.
Backstroke's definitely your stroke.
And nobody's gonna take that away from you.
Man: On your blocks!
Now we'll see what he's made of.
You watch john.
Take your marks...
A good turn.
He's good, isn't he?
Come on, boy.
Yes. He's gonna do it, dad.
Come on, boy!
Come on!
Come on! Go, john!
Come on!
Go, john!
We've done it! We've done it!
You little beauty!
You bloody little ripper!
Harold, that's enough.
What? Everybody's lookin' at you.
John! Good on ya, boy!
Harold. You bloody little ripper!
Sit down.
Oh, for christ's sake.
You made a fool of yourself.
Here. Come on, come on.
Photographer: That's it, son.
What's it say?
I hope I can win too, mum.
Hey!
Well done.
Come on, tony!
Oh, he won! Just.
It was clear that dad lived through john's early success.
I may have won my race,
But it was john's picture that went up on the wall.
Is that straight?
Do you think it's big enough?
I feel like I ought to be lighting candles
In front of it or something.
Oh.
[mass being said in latin]
I'm sorry we're late. The tram got stuck.
That's all right, but, uh...
Shh.
You wanted to talk to me?
About my boys, brother.
I know who they are.
I want them to come to your school.
It's the best school in brisbane.
I see.
But I can't afford to send 'em here.
In nomeni patris et filii
Spiritus sancti.
Do you want to win the interschool swimming championships this year?
And the year after that?
Take my boys.
John's the best swimmer his age in australia.
I know. Tony's the state champion.
Et cum spiritu tuo.
Oh, harold,
Father dillon is hearing confession right after mass.
Is he? That's nice.
Probably been a while?
I'll pop along... Next week.
Since you're here--
And since your boys will be coming here...
With no tuition fees, though?
No fees.
Pax vobiscum.
Father dillon is right this way.
Hot in here, isn't it?
Not for us protestants.
Hope father dillon's got plenty of time.
Come on. Come on.
Faster!
Faster!
How'd we do, dad?
Well, don't stop. Go back.
We kept training...
And winning.
And training...
And winning.
Not a lot changed over the next five years.
We trained, we swam,
We won.
Okay. Hop out.
That's all you need to do today.
I want you to stay sharp.
Feels good, dad.
That's 'cause you're number one, john.
You're the one that's gonna kill 'em all.
Come on.
Dad and the other workers were always after a fairer deal.
Strikes were common and often ugly.
And the police always seemed to be on the boss's side.
Man: You bloodsuckers!
I thought it was you.
Surely you remember.
You got the wrong bloke, mate.
No. Right bloke, son.
I even remember how much I paid ya.
You and your mother.
Dora.
Everybody stay.
Harold, wait.
I...
Oh, my god.
Tony: It's dad.
What's wrong?
There's nothing wrong with him. He's drunk.
Dad?
John, take ron and diane to bed, will you?
What happened? Get out of here.
Just get away.
I'm all right.
Here. Put these in the fridge.
Oh, dad! Careful.
It's all right. That's a boy.
Don't worry about it. I'll clean it up.
Shouldn't we put him to bed?
What are you looking for?
I've got it.
Hey...Come on.
Dad, you've had enough.
No, I...
When I was your age...
I was tougher.
What are you talking about?
Harold: You're far too weak.
You make me feel ashamed.
I wish you didn't exist.
Oh, tony. Come to bed.
They were a bunch of animals.
Bastards.
Harold, what happened?
What happened today, huh?
What happened? How'd you get that mark on your face?
Coppers came out and, um...
Uh...
I think I fell over.
Coppers...
Was it..?
It was all so long ago.
T-they were animals.
And my mother...
My mother, she was there.
They were animals!
What?
You're a very good woman, dora.
Where's tony?
You need to--
It's pretty bad this drinking of dads, isn't it, mum?
Well, he used to drink...
Before you kids were born.
Why did he say that to me last night?
I don't know.
I think he was just trying to lash out at somebody.
You know, anyone.
It's usually me.
You just happened to be there.
He doesn't care about me, does he?
Oh, darling, don't think that.
It was the drink talking.
He's a very difficult man.
He is.
W-what he said, it--
It didn't have anything to do with--
No, no. Forget what he said.
He's damaged.
His mother was a terrible drunk.
She used to bring men back to their room
At the hotel
For money, you know?
And he was in there.
I don't know what went on, but, um...
Well, I think he had to do some pretty...
Awful things to survive, you know?
Hates himself for it.
Anyway...
Are you as strong as I think you are?
I'm no good at football and boxing--
No, I don't mean that.
I mean up here...
In the head.
You've got to be so strong up there.
He doesn't matter.
You matter.
Even dad wouldn't say something like that.
Well, he did.
All I know is he'd never say anything like that to you or harold.
I guess you've just got to forget it.
Would you be able to forget it?
You know I'd never do anything to hurt you.
Ever.
I know.
Hubby still on strike?
Oh, hello. Yes.
We think it'll be over soon.
You know I can't give you anymore credit?
The boss'll come down on me if I do.
If it were up to me...
Yes. Put them back.
Put them back now.
Sorry. I'll just put these apples back.
Don't go in, mum. Nothing good'll come of it.
We'll see about that, won't we?
Hey, what're you doin' here?
Men's-only bar, missus.
Would you step aside, please?
If I have to go and get the police to come in here, I will.
Judging by the look of you, I'm sure they'd want to have a word with you anyway.
Would you come home now?
Oh, look, your kid's picture is in the paper,
And that's all it means to you, a place to put a glass of beer?
Dora, go home.
Not until you come with me.
Man: Leave your old man alone, missus,
He deserves to have his fun.
What about my fun, eh?
You should all be home with your wives and your children.
Your wives would love to have some of what you've spent here today.
Imagine, she might even get herself a decent pair of shoes!
You're makin' a fool out of me.
Go home. I'll be there in a minute.
Go on!
You should all be ashamed of yourselves, the lot of you!
You know, sometimes I don't mine when dad's drinking.
Why would you say that?
It's awful when he's drinking.
I know. I meant when we're training ourselves,
We don't have to work so hard.
I get tired of all this.
Well, you've got the australian championships in two weeks.
  you better--
Harold: Pick up the pace.
I don't want anymore bludging round here.
On your blocks.
Want an apple? Yeah, thanks.
G'day, mate.
Hey, how are ya?
To swim for australia and have to beat
The best of the best.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
John was just too young to compete.
Oh, there's tony.
You're from queensland, right?
Yeah.
Backstroke. Fingleton?
Yeah, that's right. You gonna win?
Well, I hope so.
Here. Here, tony.
Thanks.
Oh, there she is. Dawn fraser.
She's going to be the best of them all, isn't she?
Yes!
Come on!
I think he's gonna do it!
Go, tony!
Go, tony!
Yes! He won!
Your son's just won the junior championship.
Wait'll these mugs see what you can do.
Thanks, rod. Thank you.
Congratulations, tony.
Thanks, dawn.
This is my brother, john.
Nice to meet you.
Well, congratulations.
Dawn, I'm tony's trainer, harold Fingleton.
Pleasure.
So, do you think you're going to get a couple of gold for us
At the olympics in melbourne?
One would be nice.
John's gonna be there in four year's time.
I think he's got it in him.
Well, tony's not so bad, either.
He has to watch his times.
Here's my mother.
She wants me to get all the autographs I can.
Sign one for me? Me?
Yeah. You're a champ.
All right.
We've got to have our picture taken, too, so...
Great. We'll all come. John.
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
I think it's just the australian champs.
Sorry, mate.
Where's john?
I'm here.
I've been down at the pool.
You're not there again.
I know. I took the day off.
Who said you could do that?
I did.
State championships are no joke.
Those kids are going to skin you alive.
Dad, not one of them has ever beaten me.
Kid from bundaberg's pretty good. No, I can handle him.
Dad, I'm just pacing myself, all right?
I can still win it.
Fifth.
You dirty, little cur.
I'm sorry dad. They were too good.
They weren't too good. They trained. You didn't.
I don't think you've got the guts to workout enough.
You think you're lord muck. You just have to show up to win.
You find somebody else to train you.
Because you and me are through!
¶ when irish eyes...¶
¶...All the world ¶
¶...Eyes are smiling ¶
Surely you remember...
Harold: You got the wrong bloke, mate.
No. Right bloke, son.
Remember?
It's just like the old days, ain't it?
Harold: Brains of a complete idiot!
No, I don't.
You talk a whole lot of drivel!
Oh, that's it. Go on.
...Bunch of no-hopers.
Who are you calli" a no-hoper?
You're the biggest no-hoper of the lot.
What have you ever done that was so great?
Bringin' you in the world for starters
Wasn't so great, you useless little bludger.
Oh, yeah? Well, all we ever hear about
Is how bloody great you were at football.
What do you got to prove it?
You're nothin'. That's what you are. You're nothin'.
I want you to go to bed. No, I'm not going to go to bed.
What would you know, huh?
Who do you think you are? You sit in your little chair,
And all you do is judge people!
Leave him alone!
Harold: You animal!
Get off him!
Oh, my finger!
Oh, you've got my finger!
You've hurt mum!
Get a cloth!
Somebody get my purse. You gotta go to the hospital!
Stay there!
Mum!
Diane: Mum, are you all right?
Yeah, she's fine. Thanks for asking.
She's got 15 stitches, and lucky to have the bloody finger at all!
What are you reading?
It's hamlet.
Do you wanna win this championship next month or not?
You can both do an extra mile for the next three weeks
To make up for all your bludging.
Those kids who beat you last year
Are gonna be as keen as mustard to do it again this year.
Beat you to the other end. No way!
Okay. Come back.
Flat out.
Back stroke. Both of you.
I think you should go down and train by yourself
At the valley baths right up to the race.
It'll give you a week to get used to the feel
Of the length of the pool.
Yeah, all right. What about john?
I'll keep him at spring hill.
I think he needs to work on his turns.
All right.
Okay, guys. Let's get cracking.
How's the training been? It's strange not seeing how you're doing.
It's going good. Yeah?
Are you gonna win today or what?
I hope so. We'll see.
I'll see you, later.
All right. See ya.
Has anyone seen john?
No, man.
Tony.
You lose something, tony?
Uh, yeah. I'm just looking for john.
We do this funny handshake. Don't worry, it doesn't matter.
Mum, what's going on?
I don't know.
Is he in the program?
No, I've looked.
He did it!
He's the one. I knew it.
Just a small change in plan.
Swimmer: Hey!
Swimmers: Oh!
Do you reckon could swim from here to america?
Are you just going to sit here feeling sorry for yourself?
No. John's the star.
He's a... Better swimmer than me.
He always was.
He's good, mum.
John's number one.
You know, it's just one race.
There's gonna be plenty of races for you.
Mum, it's too late, all right?
How many years have I been swimming?
I wanted to win a medal. I wanted to be a champion
And win a medal at the olympics.
You know?
You know, I wanted to be somebody.
You think you're nobody, hmm?
Winning a medal isn't going to change that--
Mum, it's not about that!
All right? I've wanted...
I had this plan, all right? I thought that maybe
If I could get to the top of the swimming
It would lead to something, and then I could get--
I could--I could just go!
You've got to be very strong up here in the head, okay?
Listen...
Oh, my darling boy...
I love you. I love you.
I'm so proud of you.
Me, too.
Oh, my darling boy.
Only you can make something of yourself.
Not your father and not me.
And if swimming is what you're after,
Then there's always next year.
But, you know, there might be something
Completely different for you.
Nothing to do with swimming.
That'll, you know...
Get you out of here.
If that's what you want.
Faster...
Harder.
Tony, come in for a beer.
No. No, I don't...
I've got to get...
So, are you training up?
Yeah, yeah.
Better you than me, mate.
I suppose.
You know, you've made my life bloody misery at times when we were kids.
You reckon?
Yeah, I do reckon.
'cause you used to piss me off.
Did I?
Yeah, you did. You were such a bloody saint.
So goody-good.
I wasn't goody-goody. I was just me.
At least I didn't duke it out on everyone the way you you did.
What do you expect? I had to take care of myself, didn't I?
Not after all that swimming stuff.
Is that why you tried to out-drink him?
Think you're pretty bloody smart, don't ya?
Eh?
Even though I knew I could beat the bejeezus out of you as a kid,
You were always a fighter.
You never give up, do ya?
I don't know.
Maybe one of these days I'll stop banging my head against the wall.
You know, being a fighter isn't about slugging it out in the ring.
You know that?
You should do this on your own, tony.
Show dad what you're made of.
You goin'? Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah. Go get 'em.
Okay?
I'm sure I'll be at the championships next month.
They're going to be tough, but I can handle myself.
Always have.
Tony, it's a day of the big grudge match
Between you two brothers.
How about a few words before the race?
How 'bout a few words after the race?
Thanks, mate.
I don't know that I can stand this competition between the two of them.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Man: Take your marks!
John's falling back.
What? John's falling back.
Mum, tony's got the lead!
Good on you, tony.
You beat me.
Didn't beat you... Beat him.
He's finished.
Dad...
Well...
You just threw it all away.
I didn't throw it away!
Maybe I didn't want it.
Tony wanted it.
You threw it all away like a mongrel dog.
And you could've been the best in the country.
Well, now maybe tony is.
You know, he could win the australian championships next month.
That's his dream!
It's not my dream!
Go home to your mother.
Harold: You wanted five kids.
Dora: What-- what have they done? What have we done--
What have they done?
Why was I in an orphanage? I had parents.
Why would they put me in there with those sick animals.
I tell ya, I should've played...
I should've played football, but, oh, no.
No, no, not for harold Fingleton.
Dora wanted to have five kids.
Jesus christ! You've had enough!
Give me that! I want you to stop drinking now!
What do you want?
Stop it!
Don't be an idiot. Let it go. Let it go!
Are you okay?
Can't stand this anymore.
You can do whatever you like.
Dora.
Dora.
John?
John?
What?
What?
Harold: Dora?
What's he saying? Shh shh.
Wake up!
Stupid woman.
Where's mum?
Mum?
Mum, wake up.
Mum?
Mum? Wake up! What have you done?
Sleeping pills.
We've got to get her up!
Help me get her up! Roll her over.
Help me get her up! We've got to make her get up!
We've got to make her walk. She won't wake up.
Use your feet, mum. Diane: Mum!
No, you can't lie down.
Tony, do you know what you're doing?
Diane, go and get a blanket.
Do we make her-- how do we make her throw up?
Mum! Mum, wake up!
Wake up! Get up!
Roll over.
We've got to call an ambulance.
Don't let her rest no matter what happens, all right?
Throw water on her! Just don't let her sleep!
We've pumped everything we could out of her stomach.
Now, her throat will be sore,
But she'll be fine.
She can sleep if she wants to?
All right. Thank you.
I don't know what we'd all do without you, mum.
Please just let me know if you feel like that,
All right?
I will, darling.
I had to do something.
Not that.
Anything but that.
Well, I've tried everything else.
Not everything else.
I know what you're driving at.
I will leave him, if, uh...
If he doesn't stop.
Well, let's not talk about it.
I'll wait till you kids are all grown up and don't need me.
Which will be never.
Darling, boy.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mitchell... Which one's he?
Come on, tony! Come on, come on!
So, who's plannin' on comin' in second to me?
You'll have to do a lot better than that with me, mate.
I've been psyched out by experts.
Take your marks!
Come on, tony!
Come on, tony!
That's it, tony! Come on!
He's gonna win!
He won.
Well done!
Yes!
We've got an australian champion in the family.
Good on ya, kid.
That's it? Good on ya, kid?
What do you want me to say?
You've been... Pushing these kids...
For years to do what tony just did.
You couldn't even be bothered
Going to see the biggest race of his life.
I'm finished with all that.
What's he ever done to you?
You all right, dad?
No.
I'm fine.
Is there anything I can do for you?
No.
Tony?
Listen...
You... You...
Go to bed.
Dad...
Dad, I want you to see this.
I'm the best
In australia at something.
Maybe one of the best backstroke swimmers in the world.
You were the best in australia, were ya?
Yeah.
Oh...
Look, I'm sorry
You had such a tough life as a kid.
And I'm sorry about the depression,
And how you didn't play football for australia,
But--but, dad, this...
This is my life...
And you... You're a part of it, dad.
It's for you.
I know you wanted it to be john,
But it's me who's done it.
It's me.
That's nothing to do with me.
I won the australian championship.
It's good, isn't it, dad?
It's good, isn't it, dad?
Feels good, dad.
What's this you're watching?
Oh, is that president kennedy?
Yeah.
Isn't he lovely?
He's at some function at the harvard.
That's were he went to university.
Looks like a nice place.
So far from brisbane. It might as well be on the moon.
Reporter: In the small town of ayr in northern queensland,
The australian swimming team is hard at training
For the upcoming empire games trials in melbourne,
Which will determine the team selection
For the games in perth.
And we all say, "good luck to you boys!"
There's tony. Hi, tony. He's so lucky being--
Luck's got nothing to do with it you know that very well.
Oh, there's murray rose.
Oh, he's so...
So... So blonde.
Tony looks well.
I wish I were on that team.
Don't you bother about that.
Dinnertime.
Diane, come on.
Dad, I reckon I can take him on.
You wanna take another crack?
Why not?
It's the big time, son.
Empire games outside the olympics is as big as it gets.
I wanna do it.
I don't think this is a good idea.
You want me to win, don't you? I want you to win.
I just don't want tony to lose.
Pool, 6:00 a.M.
We'll be there to open it.
Your brother's looking pretty good in the water.
Always did.
He wanted to know if I'd room with him at the empire games.
I can win this.
Here to there and back.
Announcer: Men's 100-meter backstroke event
Should be a very close race.
On your marks!
Announcer: Picking up their pace.
Tony Fingleton and jason saunders
Are leading by half a body length...
Where's john, you bastard?
...And john Fingleton in lane 6.
Go, son. It's a very tight race.
Shh shh.
Announcer: They're picking up their pace...
It's saunders, vincent, and the Fingleton brothers.
Could these brothers be going to the games?
No. Here comes saunders...
There's nothing between saunders and Fingleton.
The crowd is going wild.
Here they come!
Saunders has just beat Fingleton... Which one, you mongrel?
We're waiting for the final results.
Followed by vincent in lane 3
And the other Fingleton in lane 6.
It's john. He came 4th.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Tony made it.
Tony did it!
Tony made it! He did it!
Yeah!
Yes!
Oh, harold, he did. Tony's in the empire games.
You have to be excited for him.
Yep. The kid did it.
Ron: Empire games! That's fantastic!
Diane: Come on, mum!
Come on!
Pa: T.A.A. Welcomes our australian team
Heading off to perth for the empire games.
Good luck to you all.
Look, I know how much you wanted to make the team.
I never thought I'd actually make it,
But I always thought you would.
Dad made it hard on both of us doing what he did.
I wish I'd known what was going on. Why..?
Why didn't you tell me?
Dad didn't want me to tell you.
I'd have told you.
Since then it hasn't been the same, has it?
Dad thought it was the only way I could win.
I want us to be friends again.
Okay?
The way we used to be.
You're my brother.
I love ya.
John...
They gave you a full scholarship?
Yeah. Tuition, board, the whole thing.
All I had to do was scream for u.S.C.
Which I wanted to do anyway.
Will you marry me, murray?
You could probably get one, too.
A full scholarship!
Yeah. There's u.C.L.A., harvard, yale...
Harvard? Best college in the u.S.A.
Yeah, I know. That's where president kennedy went.
You need to write to the dean of admissions.
He'll help you.
Can I have one of your swimsuits?
One of my--
Okay.
They look better with you in them.
Reporter: And here comes the australian team,
Marching proudly into the stadium
With a magnificent reception from the crowd.
And in the presence
Of all the competitors,
The officials, the spectators,
I declare the vii british
Empire and commonwealth games...
Open.
Ron, let it be-- I'm trying to get a clear picture!
Leave it alone!
That's it, that's it.
I can't see. There's tony.
He's going to win. I know it.
He looks good.
He looks like he's going to spew.
On your marks!
Come on, mate.
Come on, tony.
Come on, tony.
That's his fastest split ever.
He won!
Ha ha ha!
Check the times.
Missed by a tenth of a second.
But he won a silver medal! He still won a silver medal!
Oh, my god!
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Um...
Well, I'm just cutting out this thing of tony...
Give it to me! It's mine! Give it to me!
Jesus!
Harold...
Harold, just put the album...
Just--just put it down.
Come here! Come here!
Leave me alone! Uhh! Uhh!
Aah!
Dora!
Dora!
Get back inside!
Come here!
Reporter: Here comes the plane carrying brisbane's own
Tony Fingleton,
Silver medallist at the empire games
And dual australian champion.
I was so proud when I saw you
Getting off the plane.
Mum.
It's on!
...One of australia's great swimmers,
Tony Fingleton.
Well, tony, with two australian championships...
Harold, your kid's on the tv!
What's it like having a kid as australian champ?
What are your plans? More training for the tokyo olympics next year?
I guess so. I've also got something interesting I'm waiting to hear about.
It could be exciting, a big change, but I don't know yet.
Whatever it is, good luck, tony,
And welcome home.
I suppose I ought to give it to you.
Give me what?
It came last week.
"dear mr. Fingleton, "I'm delighted to inform you
"that the committee on admissions and financial aid
"has voted to off you a place in harvard.
"please accept our personal congratulations
For your outstanding achievements."
I'm in.
They want to give me a full scholarship to harvard!
I'm in!
I don't want you to go.
You don't want me to go? Mum!
Do you have any idea what this means?
I don't want you to go, either.
Come on! Come on!
You can't be serious! This is a full scholarship!
Hi.
America is straight ahead as far as you can go
And a bit to the left.
You think I'm deserting you, don't you?
No.
Mum, I have to go.
You know I can't turn my back on this.
Yeah. I'm just gonna miss you, that's all.
I think I've lost you, anyhow.
You're not going to come back.
Mum, it's only for four years.
I am coming back.
Yeah...
You're my hero.  
Do you know that?
I'll be okay.  
You sure? Yeah, yeah.
No more...
No.
No, he can't hurt me anymore.
That's all fine.
Knowing you're going to harvard makes everything fine.
Harvard! Imagine!
I wonder if you'll see president kennedy?
And that beautiful thing, his wife?
And all those american girls.
They're so...Beautiful.
I know you have to do this.
I know you...I know you have to get away from this.
I'm okay. I don't matter.
Mum, you do matter. I really, I truly don't matter.
You do.
I'm just...
I'm just a bit frightened, that's all.
I'm just a bit frightened of the future.
[chopin's minute waltz playing]
G'day.
Tony.
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.
Make yourself at home.
My back's been giving me hell.
Chopin's minute waltz.
Some russian drongo.
Seems to be taking him hours.
There's a beer in the fridge if you want one.
Oh, no. I'm fine.
There's only one.
It's a bit of a test.
All right.
How're you doing?
Nine weeks...
Four days.
Well, pretty good, dad.
Uh, my boat leaves tonight.
Yeah, so I hear.
Yeah.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
Harvard.
Certainly didn't see that one coming.
Well, it's the swimming that got me there.
Yeah.
You're good at it.
Thanks.
It means a lot to hear you say that to me.
Dad, I had a choice.
It was the olympics or harvard.
I was um...
Gonna take a walk.
Do you wanna come? Yeah.
My boat leaves from here tonight.
Yeah. I won't be coming down.
Your mother knows that.
Hi, bruce. Hi, howard.
Do you remember the first time you took me to the pool, dad?
Put me in the water?
I do. At the old spring hill baths.
I remember being terrified of drowning.
You had me there, and then you just...
You just let me go.
I remember that. Yeah.
But I didn't go under, I floated.
And then, uh...
And then I swam away from you.
And I swam away...
Across to the other side, maybe, but...
I should go. I've got things to do.
I'm going to go and chat to a couple of mates.
Yeah.
You've got guts.
Is there anything I can do for you, dad?
No.
I'll be okay.
Don't give up on me, son.
Tony: It's funny how the stumbling blocks of life
Can help make us better people.
I never had the support of my father,
But in the end that's what gave me the strength
To seek something more than I could've ever imagined...
Something in another world.
Your event was today. I was just looking at the results.
Bet you wish you were there, too, huh?
No. I'm exactly where I wanna be.
Here? I wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world.
Be nice to win an olympic medal, though, huh?
Someone once told me that if you're a nobody without a medal,
You're still a nobody with one.
Would you do us a favor?
Thanks.
Young tony: We've got the pool all to ourselves.
Yay!
Whoa!
Dora: Are you as strong as I think you are?
...In the head.
John: You know I'd never do anything to hurt you.
Harold, jr: You were always a fighter.
Show dad what you're made of.
Harold: Backstroke's definitely your strength,
That's good!
And nobody's going to take that away from you.
Dora: Only you can make something of yourself,
Not your father and not me.
Look at your time!
That was the swim of your life, man.
