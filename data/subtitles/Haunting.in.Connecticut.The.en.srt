4
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,089
<i>I love you, Lisa. I love you, Lisa.</i>

5
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,083
<i>I love you so much.</i>

6
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,845
<i>Listen to me, Lisa.</i>

7
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,411
<i>Hey, Lisa.</i>

8
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,767
<i>I have something to tell you, Lisa.</i>

9
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,330
<i>Listen to me.</i>

10
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,085
<i>I have something to tell you, Lisa.</i>

11
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,686
<i>I have Something
to tell you, Lisa.</i>

12
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,847
Mama?

13
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,729
Oh, God!

14
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,208
What are you doing up, sweetie?

15
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,764
Did you have another bad dream?

16
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,644
I dreamed about a swing.

17
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,922
Is there one at the new house?

18
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,204
Well, if there isn't,

19
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,567
I bet your daddy might just
put one up for you.

20
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,524
Come on.
Let's go get some breakfast, okay?

21
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,762
- I'll meet you in there.
- Okay.

22
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,803
What does the new house look like?

23
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,369
It's way out in the country

24
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,728
and there's just lots of room for you to play.

25
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,131
Can we bring my bike?

26
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,242
Of course we can bring
your bike, sweetie.

27
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,368
Even though <i>I</i> don't know
how to ride it yet?

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,240
You are gonna have lots of places
to learn how to ride your bike.

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,687
Hey! Heidi!
- Daddy!

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,887
- You done good, Daddy.
- Why, thank you.

31
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,168
What about you, huh? What do you think?

32
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,765
Who lived there before?

33
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,921
Nobody, honey.

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,764
That's why the bank gave us
such a good deal, right?

35
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,365
Why, thank you, Mama.

36
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,770
Well, maybe you'd rather live in there?

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,048
- No.
- That can be arranged.

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,691
- No, thank you.
- You could have the whole place to yourself.

39
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,370
- Nope. No, nope!
- Teddy bear could have his own room.

40
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,120
Come on, let's go. I'll race you! Come on!

41
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,363
Go, go, go! Race Mama!

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,884
The hell, baby?

43
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,809
You can't find a clearer station than that?

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,370
We're out in the boondocks, babe.

45
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,442
We're lucky we get running water.
Thank you.

46
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,726
Well, we don't need water,

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
- that's what beer is for.
- Mm-hmm.

48
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,643
- My beer, by the way.
- Uh-uh.

49
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,929
You! Git! God! Shoo!

50
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,730
Git!

51
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,570
You think that's funny, do you?

52
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,281
Aunt Joyce!

53
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,330
Aunt Joyce!

54
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,087
Kid, you grow like a weed!

55
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,800
Hi!

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,446
Look at you, Miss Homeowner.

57
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,400
Well, that didn't take long.

58
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,931
No suitcase?

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,402
- I am not a freeloader, Andy.
- Today or historically?

60
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,290
Stop it, Andy.
Joyce is just here to wish us well.

61
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,645
Is that so?

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,808
It's a goddamn curse
being right all the time.

63
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,931
It truly is.

64
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,324
It didn't work outwith Ray.

65
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,006
Was he the married one or the drunk?

66
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,643
Bit of both, turns out.

67
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,084
- What about you? Are you...
- Eleven weeks sober.

68
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,249
- Shit, call Guinness.

69
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,244
On second thought
that's probably a bad idea.

70
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,369
I've got alimony coming in.

71
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,644
I wanna be near family.

72
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,850
Well, find a place near here, just not here.

73
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,566
Who lives over there?

74
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,802
That's just some old wreck
someone left behind.

75
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,881
I'm gonna haul it away.

76
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,564
A girl lives down there.

77
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,681
Nobody lives around here, baby.

78
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,046
When did you see a girl?

79
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,246
Just now.

80
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,690
You know, I've lived in worse.

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,929
"Near here but not here," right?

82
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,565
You did say that, babe.

83
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,126
Stop it.

84
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,605
Mama?

85
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,091
Why are you crying?

86
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,482
It's nothing, sweetie. Nothing.

87
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,248
Aunt Joyce is out front,

88
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,967
so go say good night
and I'll come tuck you in, okay?

89
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,685
Okay.

90
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,645
Mama's crying.

91
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,122
Do you know why she gets sad?

92
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,804
Your mama gets feelings sometimes.

93
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,561
Feelings she doesn't much care for.

94
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,050
What kind of feelings?

95
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,010
Tell you what. I want you to try something
for me. Can you do that?

96
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,011
Look out there.

97
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,246
At what?

98
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,287
Don't really focus
on anything specific. Just...

99
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,690
Take it all in.

100
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,966
Feel anything?

101
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,965
<i>Help us...</i>

102
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,521
I think so.

103
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,850
And sometimes...

104
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,529
I see things.

105
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,570
That's because you were
born with a veil, sweetie.

106
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,643
Just like your mama and me. And our mama.

107
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,326
What's a veil?

108
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,961
It means that when you were born,

109
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,651
you had a sheen over your face,
like a wedding veil.

110
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,564
And sometimes folks
born that way have a gift.

111
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,846
They can...

112
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,090
They can sense certain things
that other people can't.

113
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,323
Mama never said anything about it.

114
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,530
Your mama doesn't like this kind of
talk of gifts and feelings.

115
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,050
So let's just keep this conversation
between us, okay?

116
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,009
Now run to bed. Please.

117
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,241
Love you.

118
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,890
I love you, too.

119
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,971
I know, Mama.

120
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,202
<i>Listen to me, Lisa.</i>

121
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,402
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

122
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,002
<i>Listen to me, Lisa.</i>

123
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,162
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

124
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,563
<i>Just be a good girl</i>

125
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,321
<i>and listen to your mother.</i>

126
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,084
<i>Listen to me!</i>

127
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,440
Lisa.

128
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,169
It's 6:00 a.m.

129
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,169
How long you been in here this time?

130
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,328
You saw something again, didn't you?

131
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,121
Here.

132
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,364
If these pills ain't working, we sure
as hell shouldn't keep paying for them.

133
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,445
They're working.

134
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,410
Just gets a little tricky
when they wear off, that's all.

135
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,163
You should finish getting dressed.
You'll be late for work.

136
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,607
- All right, darling.
- Thank you.

137
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,365
Careful, Heidi.

138
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,167
- You need any help?
- I can do it.

139
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,361
Okay.

140
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,201
All right.

141
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,164
Hey, neighbor.

142
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,000
Heidi's been gone an hour
and I don't know where she is.

143
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,927
- Well, she's probably just wandering.
- Heidi is not a wanderer.

144
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,321
That's 'cause she's never had anywhere
to wander to. Now she does.

145
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,084
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

146
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,361
Heidi!

147
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,842
Baby, where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

148
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,331
I'm not supposed to say.

149
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,641
Who said that?

150
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,768
Damn it, Heidi, who told you that?

151
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,401
Mr. Gordy.

152
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
Who's Mr. Gordy?

153
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,766
An old man I met.

154
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,401
He said there was a swing set in the woods,
just like in my dream.

155
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,130
Remember, Mama?

156
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,841
Okay.

157
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,251
Okay, come here.

158
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,049
Joyce, get Andy on the phone.

159
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,851
This is it.

160
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,287
Mr. Gordy told me there was a swing here.

161
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,522
Well, babe, I don't see a swing.

162
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,206
I'll be damned.

163
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,045
There may not be a swing here now,
but there used to be.

164
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,402
- Jesus.
- Walk much?

165
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,041
Babe, did this Mr. Gordy
say anything else to you?

166
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,966
He said there's money buried in the garden.

167
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,081
Okay.

168
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,124
Okay, sweetie, I want you
to do something for me.

169
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,407
How much money?

170
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,201
If this Mr. Gordy
ever comes up to you again

171
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,046
I want you to scream as loud as you can.
You understand me?

172
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,121
Okay.

173
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,211
Let's go.

174
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,850
Andy?

175
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,209
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

176
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,648
They think you're a bad man.

177
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,011
You're not.

178
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,881
- Are you?
- Heidi?

179
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,487
Was that Mr. Gordy you were talking to?

180
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,167
<i>Heidi, why didn't you tell us
that you had an imaginary friend?</i>

181
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,323
<i>Mr. Gordy's not imaginary.
He talks to me.</i>

182
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,210
<i>I was standing right there watching,
there's nobody outside.</i>

183
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,170
- Mr. Gordy's real.
- Heidi, stop it.

184
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,969
I don't wanna hear any more talk about
this Mr. Gordy. Do you understand?

185
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,971
Seeing things that aren't there, it's just

186
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,088
not a road that you wanna go down.

187
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,570
Good night, okay?

188
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,531
What the hell, Joyce?

189
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,331
You've been here a week and Heidi's already
seeing invisible friends?

190
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,682
Turns out this Mr. Gordy...

191
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,961
He's up here.

192
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,560
And you, encouraging her, coming out here,
digging up my garden,

193
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,251
going on some wild goose...

194
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,324
Don't <i>be</i> afraid.

195
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,130
<i>Let them in.</i>

196
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,521
Good Lord, woman.

197
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,370
What'd you do, rob a shopping mall?

198
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,290
Courtesy of my new sugar daddy, Mr. Gordy.

199
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,363
Did you tell Heidi
where the money came from?

200
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,091
No. And neither will you.

201
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,961
I'm sure there's lots of stuff buried
in these parts.

202
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,520
That doesn't mean that there's a Mr. Gordy.

203
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,926
I beg to differ.

204
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,526
Did you look at the deed to your house?
The previous owner?

205
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,525
Yeah, the bank owned it.

206
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,285
Before that. Check it out.

207
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,723
Straight from the county assessor.

208
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,731
Look at the name at the bottom.

209
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,449
The Gordy family owned all this land
going back 200 years,

210
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,205
and this J.S. Gordy was the last one.

211
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,323
Then the bank got it in the '70s.

212
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,449
Ask me how they got it.

213
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,529
Okay, you're gonna get
one shot at this, all right?

214
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,085
If this doesn't go the way
I think it's gonna go,

215
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,446
I'll never bring it up again.

216
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,206
Deal.

217
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,088
Heidi? Come out here a second.

218
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,771
I am looking for a husband for you.

219
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,642
They're all old. You marry them.

220
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,202
- Good girl.
- Okay, pick a winner for me.

221
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,400
But look at them all carefully first.
Can you do that?

222
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,650
You see something, Heidi?

223
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,366
You know that man?

224
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,730
That's Mr. Gordy.

225
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,401
Okay.

226
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,611
Told you he was real.

227
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,409
I told you and you didn't believe me.

228
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,006
Damn it.

229
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,003
My daughter is not conversing
with the dead.

230
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,482
She picked Mr. Gordy's face
out of 50 pictures. Explain that.

231
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,688
That's just your influence coming out in her.

232
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,810
You know what, I don't want you talking
about any of this with Heidi anymore.

233
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,963
You hear me? She is my daughter.
She can talk about it with me.

234
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,044
Why would she? You don't listen.

235
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,163
You just tell her what's what,
just like you did with me.

236
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,163
You needed it. You know what, you still do.

237
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,004
I suppose I'd be better off
numbing myself with pills?

238
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,560
- Stop it.
- What, you don't think I know?

239
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,849
That was Mama's trick, too.

240
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,084
And that worked out beautifully for her.

241
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,128
Joyce, go home.

242
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,568
There's nothing wrong with Heidi.

243
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,891
You know what it is, Lisa.

244
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,051
It's starting for her.

245
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,051
Heidi?

246
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,731
Are you awake?

247
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,966
<i>When I hear
of</i> a <i>family moving to town,</i>

248
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,724
<i>I visit to see if they've found a church yet.</i>

249
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,643
Because I happen to preside over one.

250
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,921
Oh.

251
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,287
Folks around here had been wondering

252
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,125
when this rather special
piece of property would sell.

253
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,727
Yeah? What's special about it?

254
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,641
Aside from it being overgrown as all hell?

255
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,046
Andy Wyrick.

256
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,610
Pastor Jordan Wells.

257
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,681
The property is special because
back around the time of the Civil War,

258
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,764
it was the Station Master's land.
But I'm sure you knew that.

259
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,524
What, like a rail road?

260
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,126
No tracks on this land.

261
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,567
No, it wasn't that kind of rail road.

262
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,484
Do you mean, like,
the Underground Railroad?

263
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,169
The folks who helped escaped slaves
make it up north? Wow.

264
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,011
That's right. Those people
were known as station masters

265
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,689
and one of the most well-known
lived right here on your land.

266
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,967
He actually hid slaves on our property?

267
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,081
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,562
Hundreds of men, women and children
passed right through here

269
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,008
with nothing but the clothes on their back
and the light of the moon to guide them.

270
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,605
They didn't have flashlights?

271
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,240
No, sweetie.

272
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,529
They couldn't even use lanterns.

273
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,329
The moonlight was the only light
that they ever saw.

274
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,087
It was the light of freedom
in the Promised Land.

275
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,842
The Station Master
was an extraordinary man.

276
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,527
Entire generations of families
would not exist

277
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,968
if it was not for the Station Master
and this piece of land.

278
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,291
So,

279
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,011
don't be surprised if you get visitors
from time to time.

280
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,491
Living ones, I hope.

281
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,530
- As opposed to?
- Andy's just having a little fun.

282
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,808
- I do that.
- Well, if you do get any visitors,

283
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,169
I hope you'll be more welcoming than
the previous owner, J.S. Gordy, was.

284
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,289
He didn't exactly share his ancestor's

285
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,930
hospitable nature.

286
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,283
Between you and me

287
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,284
there was something seriously off
about that man.

288
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,885
Mr. Gordy's nice to me.

289
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,288
- Look, Pastor...
- Sweetie.

290
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,931
We'd better get our day started.

291
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,806
Hello?

292
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,286
<i>Help us.</i>

293
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,944
<i>Help us.</i>

294
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,285
Mr. Gordy!

295
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,565
What is that?

296
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,325
Tell me what it is!

297
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,161
- Heidi?
- Mr. Gordy!

298
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,840
Heidi!

299
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,324
You know what?

300
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,325
I think there is an invisible man around here.

301
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,125
It's me.

302
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,966
Did you miss your daddy?

303
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,087
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

304
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,321
Right answer.

305
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,920
I've got a little surprise for you.

306
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,527
- What is it?
- Oh, you'll find out. Come on.

307
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,291
Look what I found in the back of
your daddy's truck.

308
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,203
Heidi, meet Chief.

309
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,965
Oh, my God!

310
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,166
Daddy, I love him!

311
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,686
Am I the greatest father
in the world or what?

312
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,091
- You'll do.
- Thank you.

313
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,491
I love you.

314
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,960
Remember to bring Chief's bowl
back in the house after he's done.

315
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,284
Where's Chief?

316
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,326
Oh, for God's sake. Chief!

317
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,561
Chief!

318
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,287
Chief!

319
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,165
Damn dog.

320
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,045
Come on.

321
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,171
It's gonna be all right.

322
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,841
Chief!

323
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,445
Chief sounds hurt.

324
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,764
Hey, Heidi, why don't you just sit down
right here for a second?

325
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,331
Okay? And...

326
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,325
Don't move.

327
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,926
Be right back.

328
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,370
- Chief!

329
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,402
Hey! Here, boy!

330
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,291
Chief!

331
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,447
Chief.

332
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,886
How'd you get in there, boy?

333
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,560
Daddy?

334
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,090
Heidi.

335
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,366
All right, watch out, boy.

336
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,451
What the hell?

337
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,491
Daddy?

338
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,721
<i>Heidi.</i>

339
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,760
<i>Heidi.</i>

340
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,081
<i>Help us.</i>

341
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,491
Heidi?

342
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,365
Heidi!

343
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,403
<i>Help us.</i>

344
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,450
Damn it!

345
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,209
I thought I told you to sit tight.

346
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,727
What are you hollerin' about over here?

347
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,526
Come on.

348
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,411
Let's get you home.

349
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,011
Hey, babe.

350
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,801
- You figure out what this thing is yet?
- Yeah.

351
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,931
It's a trap.

352
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,766
See, you bait that chamber there.

353
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,530
Animals, they get in

354
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,250
and they can't get back out.

355
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,044
They get weak and starve.

356
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,565
Easy pickings.

357
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,887
Then you get them back out through here.

358
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,491
The back door.

359
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,688
There's gotta be a better way to hunt.

360
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,801
That's just cruel.

361
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,211
No, it's smart.

362
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,770
If you're a taxidermist.

363
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,048
Already found three more of 'em
in the woods.

364
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,771
I figure they made good money
for someone, back in...

365
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,487
Well, whenever the hell
they still used locks like these.

366
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,488
Well, smash them all up so Chief
doesn't get stuck in them again.

367
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,210
Or Heidi, for that matter.

368
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,645
<i>I love you, Lisa.</i>

369
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,370
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

370
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,765
<i>Let them in.</i>

371
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,126
<i>Let them in.</i>

372
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,485
Hey.

373
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,886
- What's going on, hon?
- Nothing.

374
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,205
I have a bike.

375
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,450
Do you?

376
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,570
It's pretty.

377
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,369
It's purpley.

378
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,450
What do you mean?

379
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,129
Really? People are coming?

380
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,484
What kind of people?

381
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,649
Who are you talking to now?

382
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,445
Mr. Gordy.

383
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,406
Is that right?

384
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,924
Well, ask him where there's more money.

385
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,003
I can't. He's gone.

386
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,211
Next time then.

387
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,609
He said there's people coming.

388
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,081
Who?

389
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,809
I swear, Heidi, we should take you
and Mr. Gordy on the road.

390
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,965
Who's there?

391
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,442
Stay behind me.

392
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,130
I got an ax.

393
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,610
Hello?

394
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,165
What the hell is this place?

395
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,725
Do you see her, too?

396
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,241
Yeah.

397
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,162
Mama Kay? Whoa.

398
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,926
It's okay.

399
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,850
My name's Prentiss.
This is my grandmother, Mama Kay.

400
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,321
- Is this your property?
- That you're trespassing on, yes.

401
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,687
We were told we could come back here.

402
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,285
Yeah. Bullshit. By who?

403
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,526
Woman in the trailer.

404
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,163
Said she's your sister. Sold us this.

405
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,126
Sister-in-law.

406
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,727
What is that?

407
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,165
The shoofly.

408
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,929
Prentiss?

409
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,801
Now help me sit on down.

410
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,407
I wanna visit with the little one.

411
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,171
Come on, little one.

412
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,164
Be all right, young man.

413
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,961
All right, you gonna tell me
why you came all the way out here

414
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,849
just to buy some ratty old quilt?

415
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,641
A long time ago, when this quilt
was hung out here in these woods,

416
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,643
it meant it was safe to approach.

417
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,770
Safe for who?

418
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,730
Mama Kay's ancestors for one. Mine too.

419
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,521
Do you even know
where you're living at, Mr...

420
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,886
Andy.

421
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,446
Our pastor said we might get visitors.
Something about an Underground Railroad.

422
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,524
This was one of the stations.

423
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,290
Mama Kay's always
wanted to visit this place.

424
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,530
The guy saved a lot of lives, I reckon.

425
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,922
And he deserved better than
what happened to him.

426
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,611
You don't need eyes to see, little one.

427
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,524
But you already know that.

428
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,161
What do you mean?

429
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,811
You asked your father

430
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,008
if he saw me.

431
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,249
Now, that makes you some kind of special.

432
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,171
My mama says I'm not supposed to
talk about that.

433
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,086
But you have to be careful
with a gift like that.

434
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,249
Because sometimes

435
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,603
the devil looks a gentleman.

436
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,642
You're telling me

437
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,724
all that took place on my property?

438
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,041
Yes, sir.

439
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,811
Right here.

440
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,280
Guess your pastor left that part out.

441
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,441
Yeah.

442
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,280
Family meeting.

443
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,961
Whoa.

444
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,762
Not you, kiddo.
You stay outside for a minute, all right?

445
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,251
Okay, Daddy.

446
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,730
Sit down, Joyce.

447
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,764
<i>That man told Daddy
what happened here, didn't he?</i>

448
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,126
<i>Why can't I know?</i>

449
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,089
<i>It's just not a story
for little girls, sweetie.</i>

450
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,288
I'm a big girl. You always say that.

451
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,324
You remember Pastor Wells
talking about the Station Master?

452
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,891
<i>Well, back when he owned all this land,</i>

453
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,009
<i>he was what's called a taxidermist.</i>

454
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,881
<i>He also did something that
he didn't tell anybody.</i>

455
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,644
He would help hide people
who were in trouble.

456
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,926
<i>People like Mama Kay's great-aunt, Nell,</i>

457
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,207
<i>and her fiancé, Levi.</i>

458
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,122
<i>You see, Nell and Levi had fallen in love</i>

459
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,164
and had dreams of getting married
once they were safe

460
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,526
and free.

461
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,840
How the hell did people
even find their way out here?

462
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,043
There were guides called conductors
who helped them.

463
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,491
And these quilts, they were a code
from the Station Master

464
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,921
telling them where he'd meet them.

465
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,207
- Look here, you see this tree?
- Yeah.

466
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,811
There it is, down there. The meeting place.

467
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,920
The Station Master would come get them
and take them to a hiding place

468
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,810
somewhere on this property
until it was safe to move on.

469
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,049
Well, some of the other land owners, they

470
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,207
<i>found out what the Station Master
had been doing.</i>

471
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,010
<i>Well, they didn't like it very much.</i>

472
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,009
<i>So they did some</i>

473
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,206
<i>very unkind things to him.</i>

474
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,647
They hurt him just for helping people?

475
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,882
They didn't see it that way, sweetie.

476
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,291
<i>What happened to Nell?</i>

477
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,124
Did she make it up north?

478
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,804
Nell and Levi never arrived.

479
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,650
No one knows what happened to them.

480
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,562
<i>I told you something bad
happened here.</i>

481
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,850
No, it was a long time ago.
All that evil is over and done with now.

482
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,251
It's still here, Mama.

483
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,522
I can feel it. It's in the woods.

484
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,523
- It's coming for me.
- No, it's not.

485
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,810
Heidi...

486
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,444
It's all in your head.

487
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,410
- It's not real.
- But Mr. Gordy said...

488
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,651
There is no Mr. Gordy.

489
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,122
Heidi, listen to me. You have to fight this.

490
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,166
- You have to put it out of your head or...
- I'll be like you?

491
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,725
Dry off.

492
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,201
If you loved me, you'd believe me.

493
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,286
It's because I love you that I can't, baby.

494
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,648
I don't hear you getting out of that tub.

495
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,090
Heidi Wyrick, don't make me
come back in there.

496
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,609
Heidi, what is taking so long?

497
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,281
Heidi?

498
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,442
Oh, my God, Heidi! Oh, my God! Oh, God!

499
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,603
Okay, okay, okay!

500
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,762
Come on, baby! Cough it up!

501
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,766
Heidi!

502
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,761
Lisa!

503
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,087
Heidi!

504
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,766
Andy.

505
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,041
What happened?

506
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,566
She was convulsing and unconscious.

507
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,928
And vomiting sawdust and insects?

508
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,481
- Andy.
- Are you on any medication, Mrs. Wyrick?

509
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,484
You didn't see what I saw. I saw her.
You weren't there.

510
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,085
Heidi.

511
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,481
- Do you remember any of this?
- Yeah, baby.

512
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,722
I didn't dry off like I was supposed to.

513
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,049
So Mama pulled me out of the tub real hard.

514
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,884
I'm sorry, that's not what happened.

515
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,088
I think they've been through
enough for tonight.

516
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,807
Come on.

517
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,642
Just tell me exactly what
we're supposed to do here.

518
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,167
If you want my advice,
I suggest you consult with a psychiatrist.

519
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,284
Or a priest.

520
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,241
Thanks.

521
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,646
- Andy...
- Let's let Heidi rest up a sec.

522
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,329
It's hard when people don't believe you.

523
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,964
Isn't it?

524
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,410
Really, Lisa?
We're possessed by the devil now?

525
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,484
Good Lord, people,
it's a blessing, not an exorcism.

526
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,285
Please.

527
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,051
Hi.

528
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,043
Lord, we pray this night

529
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,202
for the soul of an innocent child

530
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,806
and the banishment of evil from this land.

531
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,608
I want you to pray with me now.
Can you do that?

532
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,082
In the name of the Father

533
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,528
I ask for the cleansing of fear and sickness

534
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,251
from the mind and the soul of this child.

535
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,883
I ask that you fill Heidi with the warmth
of your love into her heart

536
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,329
and that you call upon your angels
to watch over her

537
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,402
and protect her from danger.

538
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,162
Mom and Dad, would you lean down
and lay her back for me, please?

539
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,449
In the name of the Son,

540
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,921
call upon your righteous hand

541
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,289
to rid this place of all evil
that may roam here.

542
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,331
<i>Help us.</i>

543
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,285
I ask that you bless this child

544
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,246
in the name of the Holy Ghost...

545
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,083
The souls of the lost,

546
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,562
forsaken and forgotten,

547
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,322
and let your cleansing light
shine down upon this place

548
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,086
and upon this little girl now and forever.

549
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,161
Amen.

550
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,051
Amen.

551
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,604
Amen.

552
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,486
May God's love fill your heart, child,

553
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,121
and give you peace for all of your days.

554
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,721
Now that wasn't so bad, was it?

555
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,924
You did great.

556
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,480
Mama?

557
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,922
Pastor sent you away.

558
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,201
<i>Lisa!</i>

559
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,247
- Andy.
- Heidi's gone.

560
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,486
- What?

561
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,963
Call the cops.

562
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,600
Heidi!

563
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,765
Heidi!

564
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,807
Heidi!

565
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,040
Heidi!

566
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,846
Heidi!

567
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,285
Daddy!

568
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,330
Daddy!

569
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,966
Heidi!

570
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,324
Daddy!

571
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,962
- Any sign of her yet?
- No.

572
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,046
Heidi!

573
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,001
Heidi!

574
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,005
- Daddy!
- Heidi!

575
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,731
- Help me!
- Where are you, baby?

576
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,450
Down in the hole!

577
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,081
What hole?

578
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,246
Down here!

579
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,371
Daddy!

580
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,125
Oh, my God.

581
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,767
Heidi.

582
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,889
I can't get out, Daddy. I can't get out.

583
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,291
Sit tight, Heidi. I gotta find
a way to get down there, baby.

584
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,361
No!

585
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,042
<i>Heidi.</i>

586
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,366
Please!

587
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,725
Please!

588
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,521
Shit!

589
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,247
Please don't leave me
down here with them, Daddy!

590
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,366
With who, Heidi?

591
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,290
Heidi!

592
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,722
Mr. Gordy? Is that you?

593
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,083
- Daddy, help me!
- Coming!

594
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,201
Daddy!

595
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,645
Heidi!

596
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,731
Daddy!

597
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,080
Daddy!

598
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,964
<i>Heidi.</i>

599
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,082
<i>Heidi.</i>

600
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,687
Oh, my God.

601
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,086
Heidi!

602
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,805
- Daddy, hurry!
- Heidi, heads up. Coming down.

603
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,086
Daddy, hurry!

604
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,927
Help!

605
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,001
Watch out.

606
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,891
Daddy!

607
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,166
I'm coming, baby!

608
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,565
Heidi!

609
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,966
Heidi?

610
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,171
- Daddy!
- Heidi!

611
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,686
Jesus.

612
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,888
How the hell did you get down here, baby?

613
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,841
What the hell?

614
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,443
This is where the Station Master hid them.

615
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,200
Unbelievable.

616
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,646
How the hell did you find this place, Heidi?

617
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,245
The girl showed me.

618
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,720
Is that the one that you said
was down here with you?

619
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,804
No.

620
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,401
I think something else
is down here, too, Daddy.

621
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,684
I don't want to be here anymore.

622
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,291
That makes two of us.

623
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,283
<i>Most Pine Mountain
residents know the story of the Station Master</i>

624
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:46,364
<i>who helped slaves escape to freedom
as part of the Underground Railroad.</i>

625
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,643
<i>But last night, a young local girl
uncovered a sad, unknown chapter</i>

626
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,722
<i>in the saga right in her own backyard.</i>

627
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,326
<i>What authorities believe
are the remains of five males...</i>

628
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,289
<i>...discovered in an underground chamber</i>

629
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,727
<i>beneath the ruins
of the Station Master's cabin.</i>

630
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,964
<i>Now, the Station Master,
also known as Jefferson Gordy</i>

631
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,691
<i>was the great-grandfather
of the late J.S. Gordy,</i>

632
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,091
<i>who died in 1978.</i>

633
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,845
<i>For all the lives that were
saved by the Underground Railroad</i>

634
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,161
<i>there were also many folks
who didn't make it,</i>

635
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,840
<i>who just went missing.</i>

636
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,646
<i>And today's discovery is a tragic reminder
of how dangerous it really was.</i>

637
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,963
<i>In this particular case,
when the Station Master was murdered,</i>

638
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,407
<i>there was no one to let
the slaves out, who were waiting below...</i>

639
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,686
Will you please turn it off?

640
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,683
<i>...and they probably starved to death
down there.</i>

641
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,330
<i>Reporting live...</i>

642
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,529
You think that's Mama Kay's family?

643
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,730
They said five males, so I doubt it.

644
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,526
Hey.

645
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,886
What are you doing up?

646
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,530
I don't want to live here anymore.

647
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,728
It's all right now, Heidi.

648
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,723
The things that we saw,

649
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,450
they've moved on.

650
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,603
Their spirits aren't trapped anymore
because of you.

651
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,331
Joyce, please. Spirits?

652
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,721
Don't you understand
what's happened here, Lisa?

653
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,404
Those people in the chamber
wanted to be found.

654
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,084
That's what this has all been about.

655
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,130
Now they're free,

656
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:04,125
and there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

657
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,322
Mr. Gordy said it's not safe here.

658
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,729
You've seen Mr. Gordy tonight?

659
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,962
He said I shouldn't have
gone down in that hole.

660
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,209
He said I let something bad come out.

661
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,329
Okay, it is time for you to go back to bed.

662
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,124
Heidi Wyrick, you follow me right now.

663
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,248
We can't be here anymore, Mama.

664
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,244
I went in the hole and the bad man saw me.

665
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,485
He knows we're here now and he's coming.

666
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,684
What bad man, sweetie?

667
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,684
The Station Master.

668
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,446
- I let him out, Mama.
- Well, Mr. Gordy is wrong,

669
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,251
because you know very well
that the Station Master was a good man.

670
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,090
No, he wasn't.

671
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,846
Andy, will you please tell her
that there is nothing to be afraid of?

672
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,721
Mr. Gordy said there was money buried
in the garden, Lisa, and there was.

673
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,448
He said that

674
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,205
something terrible happened here. It did.

675
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,082
For something in Heidi's mind,
Mr. Gordy is sure as hell right a lot.

676
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,969
Are you telling me that suddenly
you believe all this?

677
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,328
I believe there was a cave
full of skeletons on our land, Lisa.

678
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,804
Is there a...

679
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,921
A "bad man" down there, too?
Hell if I know, but,

680
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,967
I say we pack up the truck

681
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,566
and we haul our asses outta here
before we find out.

682
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,000
Heidi.

683
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,486
Andy.

684
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,284
I mean, you can't be serious.

685
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,171
We don't have anywhere to go.
I mean, where are we...

686
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,480
Where are we gonna go?

687
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,248
Baby, I...

688
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,004
I'm sick.

689
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,882
- Heidi and I are sick...
- You're fine.

690
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,122
Heidi's fine.

691
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,131
Tell me something.

692
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,008
How the hell did Heidi get down
in that hole?

693
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,890
Even if she could lift that slab,
which she can't,

694
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,247
it's a 25-foot drop after that.

695
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,731
She didn't have a scratch on her.

696
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,923
Did you ever think that
maybe Joyce is right?

697
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,451
Crazy Joyce.

698
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,087
That this isn't some kind of disease,

699
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,004
but I don't know, it's...

700
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,127
A Sift?

701
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,407
A Sift?

702
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:58,404
You try seeing what I see
and you call it a gift.

703
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,005
I'm just saying maybe it is.

704
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,801
<i>And I'm done letting you tell our daughter</i>

705
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,166
<i>that she's sick,</i>

706
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,971
that she's got some mental disorder.

707
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,247
I love you, I do,

708
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,481
but...

709
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,124
I won't

710
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,202
let Heidi live like this.

711
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,680
You understand me?

712
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,361
- I won't do it.
- Andy, please.

713
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,571
Look, I have seen enough to know
that it ain't up here.

714
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,811
It's out there.

715
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,408
Maybe it's trying to tell us something.

716
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,445
Maybe you should try listening.

717
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,285
It's sure gonna be lonely here
without you guys.

718
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,091
You should leave, too. This is a bad place.

719
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,811
No, sweetie, it was a bad place.

720
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,531
Now it's not. Because of you.

721
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,043
- I'm gonna miss you, baby girl.
- Gonna miss you, too.

722
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,968
Hey, Chief. Come on, buddy.

723
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,447
Jump up.

724
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,521
Good boy.

725
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,567
Good boy.

726
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,201
Hey.

727
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,521
Chief!

728
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,402
Chief! Hey!

729
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,004
Where the hell's that damn dog going?

730
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,890
Daddy, we need to leave right now.

731
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,123
Without your mama?
Yeah, I'm not sure how she'd take that.

732
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,690
It's all right. Let me go find Chief.

733
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,207
Be right back. Stay here and lock the door.

734
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,965
Chief!

735
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,040
Chief! Here, boy!

736
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,690
<i>Heidi.</i>

737
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,965
Lisa?

738
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,881
Hello?

739
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,323
Why are you here?

740
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,688
Heidi. Heidi!

741
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,446
Heidi!

742
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,404
Andy.

743
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:54,281
Oh, my God.

744
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,721
Heidi!

745
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,571
Oh, God... No, no!

746
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,804
Heidi!

747
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,686
Heidi!

748
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,489
- Heidi!
- Lisa!

749
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,802
Oh, Andy! Heidi's gone!

750
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,488
Check Joyce's. Check Joyce's!

751
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,809
Joyce!

752
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,321
Heidi!

753
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,161
Heidi!

754
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,486
Damn it!

755
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:54,881
Joyce!

756
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,961
Heidi!

757
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,601
Heidi!

758
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,885
Joyce!

759
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,524
Come on! Heidi!

760
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,161
Joyce!

761
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,884
Joyce, Heidi's missing!

762
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,081
Joyce.

763
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,241
Joyce!

764
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,321
Let me in!

765
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,366
Joyce!

766
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,525
Joyce!

767
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,245
Oh, my God!

768
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,483
Oh, my God!

769
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,520
Oh, my God!

770
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,608
Joyce, Joyce, can you hear me, Joyce?

771
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,011
Joyce?

772
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,930
Joyce!

773
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,731
Joyce, please! Heidi's been taken.

774
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,329
Where is she?

775
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,760
Joyce!

776
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,162
With him.

777
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,244
"With him"?

778
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,926
Who's "him"?

779
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,521
Joyce, who's "him"?

780
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,806
No. Not tonight.

781
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,291
No.

782
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,000
Not tonight.

783
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,690
Lisa.

784
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,286
Don't.

785
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,249
Where's my little girl?

786
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,725
They know.

787
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,444
Who's "they," Joyce?

788
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,885
Tell me.

789
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,291
Who's "they"?

790
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,561
Go.

791
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,086
Okay.

792
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,730
Heidi?

793
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,281
Heidi!

794
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,161
Heidi?

795
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,045
Heidi?

796
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,121
Heidi?

797
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:20,886
Heidi?

798
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,524
Heidi!

799
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,245
<i>It's a trap.</i>

800
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,485
<i>The animals can get in,
but they can't get back out.</i>

801
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:49,847
<i>They get weak and starve. Easy pickings.</i>

802
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,645
<i>Then you get them back out through here.</i>

803
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,490
<i>The back door.</i>

804
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,011
Oh, God!

805
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,608
Heidi?

806
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,410
Heidi, baby?

807
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,085
Are you in here?

808
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,083
<i>You remember Pastor Wells talking
about the Station Master?</i>

809
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,728
<i>Well, back when he owned all this land,</i>

810
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,043
<i>he was also what's called a taxidermist.</i>

811
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,123
- Mama?
- Heidi!

812
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,364
Heidi, are you okay?

813
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,487
Are you okay? I'm here.

814
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,723
It's okay, just listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?

815
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,969
- Mama?
- Okay.

816
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,451
Mama.

817
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,327
Okay.

818
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,289
Okay, hold on to me. Hold on.

819
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,768
<i>Help us.</i>

820
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,401
Okay.

821
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,970
<i>Help us!</i>

822
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,484
Can you stand up?

823
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,921
Okay.

824
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,449
Okay. Careful.

825
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,891
Okay, put your head down.

826
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,091
Okay.

827
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,322
We're gonna climb, okay?
It's gonna be okay.

828
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,842
Okay, hold on right there.

829
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,081
Okay?

830
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,491
You can do it.

831
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:21,166
Heidi!

832
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,241
Andy!

833
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,766
Oh, my God.

834
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:28,930
<i>Lisa.</i>

835
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,603
<i>Listen to me, Lisa.</i>

836
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,440
Mama.

837
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,244
<i>You have to let them in.</i>

838
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,245
<i>Help us.</i>

839
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:39,846
<i>Let them in.</i>

840
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:41,564
<i>You don't listen.</i>

841
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,803
<i>Did you ever think that
maybe Joyce is right?</i>

842
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,406
<i>Maybe this isn't a disease,
but maybe it's a gift?</i>

843
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,244
<i>Those people in that chamber
wanted to be found.</i>

844
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,765
<i>That's what this has all been about.</i>

845
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,051
<i>Now they're free.</i>

846
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,767
<i>Because of you.</i>

847
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,604
<i>If these pills ain't working,</i>

848
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,967
<i>we sure as hell shouldn't keep
paying for them.</i>

849
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,565
<i>They're working.</i>

850
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,007
<i>Just gets a little tricky
when they wear off, that's all.</i>

851
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,809
<i>Let them in.</i>

852
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,361
<i>I'll be back for you.</i>

853
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,923
<i>You know very well that
the Station Master was a good man.</i>

854
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,840
<i>No, he wasn't.</i>

855
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,365
<i>I love you, Lisa.</i>

856
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,928
<i>Nell and Levi never arrived.</i>

857
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,809
<i>No one knows what happened to them.</i>

858
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,767
- Mama!
- Heidi!

859
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,808
Oh, my God, are you okay?

860
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,810
Are you okay?

861
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,531
Where's your daddy? Who pulled me out?

862
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,531
It's okay.

863
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:46,841
- It's okay.
- Heidi!

864
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,121
Daddy!

865
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:52,850
Oh, thank God. Thank God!

866
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,203
- You all right? You all right?
- Yeah.

867
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,130
Mr. Gordy?

868
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,001
Goddamn it.

869
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,162
You know the tire's supposed to go
below the branch, right?

870
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,685
You know what?

871
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,841
I don't wanna hear it.

872
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,843
No, it's all right, Andy. Heidi's gonna love it.

873
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,685
Every girl wants her own
dirty rubber nest up a tree.

874
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,441
Nobody likes you!

875
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,126
This ain't over.

876
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,320
Do you think Mr. Gordy knew
what his granddaddy did?

877
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:14,284
Probably why he didn't want anybody
on his property.

878
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,570
He wanted the Station Master to be
remembered for the people that he saved,

879
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:20,610
not the ones he...

880
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:22,361
Kept.

881
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,448
I keep thinking
about Mama Kay's family.

882
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,288
Well, they are in a better place.

883
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,444
That much I do know.
