No, you've already had some.
Go away!
Come on, Pramod.
You have to go to class.
- They want to meet you.
- Me? What do you mean?
- They want to meet you.
- Why?
I don't know.
They just want to meet you.
The CEO is Danish. He wants to shake
your hand before giving us the money.
Perhaps he doesn't trust us Indians.
- Let him come, I'll shake his hand.
- They want you to go to Copenhagen.
I know what he wants,
but I'm not going there.
"This is the cat..."
"...that killed the rat."
It's not possible.
I can't leave the kids.
"That lay in the house..."
"...that Jack built."
Pramod has a birthday soon.
It's not possible, Mrs. Shaw.
"That worried the cat..."
"...that killed the rat."
And then I have to go all the way to
Denmark to shake somebody's hand.
He'll take a photo of me and show
all his rich friends he's done good.
This is not up for discussion.
- I have to think about it.
- No, you won't think about it.
You will go, wear a suit, get
a haircut, behave nice and smile.
Please, Jacob.
You know as well as I do
that this is our last chance.
Otherwise we'll have to close down.
Then these children will
have nowhere to go.
They'll be on the streets.
Please.
You owe the children that much.
This is our last chance.
Are there only rich people
where you are going?
- Yes.
- No one is poor?
- No. Some have more than others.
- If I was rich, I'd be happy.
- I know, but people there are idiots.
- You hate all the rich, Mr. Jacob.
Is it because the houses are far
apart that people are far apart?
I'll tell you all about it
when I get back, right?
What's wrong? Pramod?
You're not coming back.
I know it.
I promise that I'll be back
for your birthday.
I told you so.
Pramod, come on.
Go away! Go away!
- Come on...
- Just go away!
Mr. Jacob!
- Why do you have to go?
- Because I have to.
I have to go home
and get some money.
So we can buy new books, medicine
and food. And help all the others.
Do you promise to come
to my birthday?
I swear. And I'll be calling you
every other day.
Okay?
And that's not going to be a lot of
times, because I'll be home in 8 days.
Perhaps you can take me
there one day.
Perhaps.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
"In the yard, a flock of sparrows
saw him and began to shout:"
"Tit tit! Tit tit!
Oh, look at Nils Goosey-boy."
"Look at Thumbietot!
Look at Nils Holgersen Thumbietot!"
"Cock-a-doodle-do,
cried the cock."
"Cock-a-doodle-do!"
"Then the hens came.
Peck, peck, peck..."
We'll stop here for tonight.
You have to sleep.
Into bed with you.
Sleep tight.
Good night.
Good night, Morten.
Good night, Martin.
It will be fun to see
what important thing I forgot.
Yes, it will be lovely.
As long as there's food and wine,
everything will be fine.
- You're not nervous at all?
- No, I'm looking at it as a test.
- Of what?
- Anna will marry many times.
The first wedding is always hard.
With a little luck, it will be okay.
Jørgen... Jørgen?
Yes?
- Mother, aren't you in bed?
- I can't get on line.
Don't speak to me like I'm senile.
Why can't I get online?
There's poker in three minutes.
Why did we have to get
that damn wireless network?
But it's working now. Thank you.
- Sleep tight.
- Don't stay up all night.
Sorry.
- Could we teach her to knock first?
- I've tried, but she's senile.
Only when she wants to be.
- I'll send her to a home tomorrow.
- Do you promise?
- Come back soon.
- Bye, Jacob.
- Bye bye.
- Bye, Mr. Jacob.
That's me.
- May I take your bag?
- No, thanks.
Please step inside.

- Jacob Pedersen?
- That's me.
Christian Refner,
I'm here to pick you up.
Do you have a coat?
No? Then let's go.
- The room's okay?
- It's fine.
It used to be a department store.
Funny isn't it?
- So, Jacob with a C or a K?
- It's with a C.
I'm Christian with a C too.
- So you're meeting Jørgen?
- Yes.
- Do you know him well?
- He's my father-in-law.
- Or will be on Saturday.
- Congratulations.
Jørgen's fantastic.
He's brilliant, really brilliant.
- People often fear him, but don't.
- Good.
He's worth over a billion
and started out flat broke.
- But you can't tell.
- That he started flat broke?
No, no...
- Jacob Pedersen is here.
- Have a seat. Just for a moment.
- It was nice to meet you, Jacob.
- Same here. Good luck.
Give my regards to Jørgen.
Hi.
- Busy?
- A little.
- That looks nice on you.
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day, okay? Bye.
- Bye.
Jacob.
Welcome.
My name is Jørgen Hansson.
- Jacob.
- This way.
Was the flight okay?
Good.
This is where we live.
You can see Sweden on a clear day.
If you feel like it, that is.
A drink?
No thanks.
Cheers.
Cheers.
You have a video that can give me
a sense of what goes on there.
It will take more than
a video to show you that.
Meaning?
Bombay has over
a million child prostitutes.
Four or five times that
suffer from malnutrition.
They're not on the video.
Then there are those who die
every day of... Well, what...
Minor illnesses, minor infections...
Completely minor things -
- that could be cured for tiny sums
if one only had the will.
We've developed a sort
of priority list...
You're an angry man. That's good.
It gives you a lot of drive.
The educational supplies we need
include books, tables, chairs, beds -
- but what we need most
urgently is medicine.
Eventually we'd like to...
Yes, yes.
We'd like to take twice
as many off the streets.
- Would you like one?
- No, thanks.
We'd like to take in twice as many
and vaccinate them -
- which could be done all for less
than five kroner a day.
And we'd like to change
our food program...
- Do they all sleep in the same room?
- We have 45 at the moment.
We go to an area, and in two minutes,
40-50 kids gather, who we then feed.
But after five minutes,
there are 500 kids.
- I don't need to see more.
- The new kids...
It's an extremely impressive project
you have established.
Very impressive.
I've looked at different ways
I might be able to help.
Thank you very much.
In all, I found five different projects.
Yours is one of the most interesting.
Thank you. We're glad to hear it.
But may I ask you why?
Like I said...
It's a good project.
I was thinking of an annual donation
of one million dollars for four years.
But I need more time
to think through -
- which projects I want
to get involved with.
So don't get your hopes up
too high.
Okay... I was given
a different impression.
Then let's look at the papers
again, because...
No, no. Let's forget the boring
paperwork until Monday.
We'll have lunch and I'll let
you know what I've decided.
- I've got a busy weekend coming up.
- So I've heard.
I spoke to the guy that drove me
here. He's marrying your daughter?
- Yes, Christian. You're not married?
- No.
- Got any family here?
- No, I don't.
Then come to the wedding tomorrow.
It's a huge wedding. I don't know
half of the guests myself.
- It would be nice.
- I need to...
You don't have any other plans.
We're through.
See you tomorrow?
We're looking forward to it.
- Then I can get to know you.
- Thanks for your time.
- Hey, dad!
- How are you?
Were you jumping on
the trampoline? Can I see?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Everything okay?
Except that Annette
can't cope with the stress.
Then now's not the time
to say another guest is coming.
A business contact from India.
You better do it gently... in stages.
Hello, hello.
Have you changed your mind?
There's still time.
- Yes, come on... You've got time.
- You're just jealous.
Yes, of course.
You're much too beautiful for him.
Will you love and honor her,
for better or for worse -
- in good times and bad -
- as husband and wife
til death do you part?
Yes.
And now I ask you,
Anna Louise Hansson -
- do you take Christian Refner
as your lawfully wedded husband?
- Yes.
- Will you love and honor...
- I'm very sorry.
- That's okay.
Those who before us have pledged
to live as man and wife -
- confirming before God
and those assembled here -
- their solemn vows,
I therefore pronounce you -
- man and wife.
Don't throw them yet.
Come here. I'll show you...
- Hi.
- Hi, Jacob.
- Doing well?
- Yes.
- Hi. Welcome.
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.
- I see.
Have you met Anna?
You must.
- This is Jacob, who I told you about.
- Congratulations.
Christian.
This is Christian's mother.
There you are.
Care for a drink?
Yes, please.
- Cheers. Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Can I play?
- Yes! Are you any good?
Good?! I'm the best.
Aren't you playing together?
I stand not just before you, Anna -
- but also my boss
and father-in-law, Jørgen -
- and Helene and, of course,
the rest of you.
Anna, we met at Jørgen's firm
when it was in the suburbs.
I didn't dare speak to you because
you were the boss's daughter.
Then one day you needed
to borrow 1000 kroner.
Jørgen wasn't there
and so I had to lend it to you.
You'd think he was marrying Jørgen.
But Jørgen and Helene,
I would like -
- to thank you for the way you've
welcomed me into the family.
I know you think it's early
for Anna to marry -
- but please know
that it feels very right to me.
Anna, I love you more than all the
world. I'm thrilled you'll have me.
Please toast to my beautiful bride -
- and her fantastic family
who have welcomed me so kindly -
- Jørgen, Helene, the twins...
Cheers.
Christian's lovely, don't you think?
He's nice.
- He's so cute.
- Cute? Maybe.
- I dated him before Anna.
- Was he your boyfriend?
But Anna gets whatever she wants.
It's not traditional for the bride
to give a speech -
- but everything's gone
so well so far.
I know Mom's waiting for something
to go horribly wrong.
I'll do it now
so that you can relax.
My speech isn't for you, Christian.
I love you and you know it.
I couldn't be happier than I am today.
And don't worry.
I'll pay back the 1000 kroner.
But I'd like to thank
Mom and Dad.
Mom, I know we argue
a lot now and then -
- but you are the best,
the most loving -
- and the most loyal person
I have ever met.
And Dad...
When I turned 18
a few years ago -
- you had to tell me that you weren't
my real father... genetically.
You told me how Mom
had known another man -
- and we didn't talk for
almost six months.
It wasn't until I met Christian
that I began to understand -
- why you did what you did.
You did it to protect me, so I'd have a
mother and father like everyone else.
I've had a dad.
You've been the best father
anyone could ever wish for.
And if I could have chosen,
I would have chosen you, Dad -
- whether you're my father or not.
So I would like to say thank you.
Thank you for today
and for everything.
And thanks for being the way you are
for as long as I can remember.
So I'd like to propose
a toast for Mom and Dad -
- the loveliest couple here tonight.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Hi.
Why are you sitting here
all by yourself?
Because I want to.
Weren't you ever taught not to
abandon a lady with 7 old maids?
Listen, I've got a plan.
If you wait a little
and I wait a little -
- we could go into town
after they dance.
You and me. I know a place where
they make fruit with drinks in them.
- You could come along.
- I don't think so.
I'd like to be alone
for a while, okay?
- I mean it.
- Yes.
I won't tell anyone if you come along.
I won't tell Anna.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- No.
- Are you angry?
- Are you stupid?
Go away!
I don't know what
the hell to think, Helene.
- About what?
- Too much fits together too well.
But then I think -
- you wouldn't have
done that to me.
I'd like to talk,
but not right now.
I simply can't believe
you've done this to me.
I haven't done anything.
What have I done?
Is she my daughter?
Of course not. She is mine and
Jørgen's. What were you thinking?
- Is she my daughter?
- I'll call tomorrow.
- I asked you a question!
- I'll call you tomorrow!
Won't you come to bed?
- Why did you do it, Jørgen?
- Do what?
I didn't know it was him, Helene.
It's just too much of a coincidence.
- He shouldn't have come.
- No.
But we can't control
everything in the world.
Hi, it's 602 again.
Do I have any messages now?
Fine.
Thanks.
- That's nice.
- Let me have a look?
- It's got small swastikas on it.
- They're not swastikas.
It's wonderful.
It's from...
- It's from Allan and Kristina.
- One of our really good lawyers.
He'll be fired for giving
such an ugly vase, right?
- Put it over there.
- It goes in the basement.
I have to talk to Helene.
Listen, I don't like this either,
but I need to talk to her now.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
Wait here.
Helene, we have a guest.
- Wanna play football?
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming yesterday.
- My pleasure.
- Can we offer you something?
- No. Helene, can we talk?
- I was going to call.
- But you didn't. Do you have a minute?
Of course.
Yes.
- Let's go out to the kitchen.
- Good idea. Let's go to the kitchen.
- Or would you rather be alone?
- No, I'd like you to come.
Boys, stay with Anna
and grandmother.
- Jørgen, is everything okay?
- Yes, unpack your presents.
All this running to and fro.
You old grump...
- Did you lose again?
- Yes.
Don't come here like this. You should
have waited for me to call you.
- You didn't call. You didn't call!
- Don't come here and intimidate me!
I waited all day. Who are you?
How can you stand yourself?
We tried to contact you several
times, but we couldn't find you.
Come on. You're filthy rich.
You could have hired an army.
It abviously took more
than an army to find you.
To find a junkie drinking
in India with hookers.
You hid my daughter for 20 years
because I cheated once?
Do you really think
that's why, Jacob?
Because you cheated once?
You're a very small person.
- What are you telling me?
- You're not listening.
- Then tell me. Tell me!
- Let's all calm down a little.
Why didn't you tell me
you were pregnant?
- We'd have figured something out.
- I didn't know until I got back.
I met Jørgen and...
No, Jacob, I don't owe you anything.
You don't owe...
Aren't we talking about your daughter?
- Shouldn't she know her father?
- She has a father, a good father.
I don't know what the hell to say.
What you did is so wrong.
You know that, right?
But you have to tell her.
You owe her and you owe me.
She doesn't give a shit.
You are so infuriating.
Is that the language you use
in this house?
I just think that it would be good
if you told her.
If you don't, I will.
I'm going to see what's going on.
We thought he was dead.
- We didn't think he existed.
- You're still lying.
No, I'm not lying. Jørgen tried to
find him in India lots of times.
He never reacted and so we
assumed that he wasn't...
- I don't have time for this, Mom.
- Jacob was a big, immature child!
He fucked everything with a pulse.
He was drinking himself to death.
He did drugs. He had grand ideas,
but did nothing.
He probably means well,
but you can't trust him.
- He wants to save everyone, but...
- I don't care if he's fucked a goat.
I have a right to know
who my father is.
- You can't manipulate people like that.
- We're not.
Fuck off and leave us alone!
Not right now.
You're far out.
What's Jørgen's reaction?
Anna?
- Should I come along?
- No.
I'll wait here, okay?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like to come in?
I mean, please come in.
Thanks.
I don't know what to say.
It's a little new to me.
For me too.
Didn't you know I existed?
I'm sorry.
You shouldn't say sorry. You're the
only one who can't be blamed.
- Would you like a Coke?
- Yes, please.
I think we've got one here.
- There aren't any more. Some water?
- That's fine.
- He's nice... Christian.
- Yes, Christian.
He's waiting in the car.
- Mom said you were dead.
- Well, okay.
But apparently I'm not.
Would you like a glass?
It's a little tight. It needs a...
How long are you staying?
Do you have time to meet?
Yes.
I'd like that very much.
- I'm here all the time.
- I could call.
Yes.
- Or I could give you my number.
- If you've got one, I'd like that.
- Now you know I exist.
- Yes.
I've got a pencil and some paper.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
I better go now.
Bye.
I'II be home very soon.
Do I have any brothers or sisters?
- No, not really.
- What do you mean?
There's a little boy at
the orphanage called Pramod.
- Pramod?
- Pramod, yes.
I've taken care of him
since he was a baby.
- How old is he now?
- He'll turn eight in precisely a week.
He's this big. He's tiny,
but he want's to be a footballer.
Maybe it's stupid, but I brought some
pictures, if you'd like to see them.
Yes, please.
Here I'm taking a bath.
That's Lennart,
my first boyfriend.
He had a moped.
- But he didn't want me.
- Why not?
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.
You can't do that!
That was in Italy.
That's Da... Jørgen.
Was I silly to bring them?
No, I'd like to see them all.
What happened back then?
Why didn't you come home?
I just didn't.
We had broken up.
And you were drunk
all the time, right?
Yeah.
And you did her friend?
Yep, I think I actually did that.
- Would you like dessert?
- Yes, please.
Jacob, I am glad you came anyway.
I thought it all through yesterday -
- and I became convinced
we must continue.
You would like to continue?
As though nothing's happened?
Yes, it fits even better now.
- Well, let's try then.
- Are you hungry?
We need some lunch.
We're going to lunch.
Wasn't it strange meeting
her again... Helene?
Yes.
Don't you think she's ageing well?
She's still extremely beautiful.
Cheers!
Cheers.
Why was I at that wedding, Jørgen?
You knew.
I didn't know.
I didn't know you were that Jacob.
- I don't believe that.
- Well I can't change anything now.
What do you want?
- The honest or the official answer?
- I'd like the honest answer.
I'm just a good person.
There's not much in this.
We better complain.
- I don't need any more.
- We need another bottle.
It's the best way to get to know
people. Another bottle.
- I don't think that would be wise.
- You're not paid to think.
Either bring another bottle
or bring your boss.
Understand?
Or should I ask him to translate?
- I need to go.
- Why? We'd like another drink.
- What's the problem?
- We need a bottle of schnapps.
We can't serve you
when you're so drunk.
So drunk?
I've only just gotten started.
- It's a policy we have.
- A policy?
A policy?
That's a damned bad argument.
If you want to get on in the world,
you need to make decisions.
When you break policies,
you show decisiveness.
Yes, and I think you should go home.
You stupid, little asshole.
Who do you think you're talking to?
- Run off and get another bottle.
- Jorgen, we'll go somewhere else.
I'm not the only one that's drunk.
Coming?
