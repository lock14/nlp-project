be an intervention in Cuba
by Unites States armed forces.

4
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,171
This government will do
everything it possibly can

5
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:59,526
and I think it can meet
it's responsibilities

6
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:02,731
to make sure that there are no
Americans involved in any actions

7
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:04,185
inside Cuba.

8
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:47,930
Excuse me sir.

9
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,728
Do you have change for a dollar?

10
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:57,646
Thank you sir.

11
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:58,606
You're welcome

12
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:33,008
From our friends on Wall Street.

13
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,249

14
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:35,687
Right away.

15
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:49,596
Cardinal is interested.

16
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,913
So the weatherman says

17
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:01,873
Sunday is the perfect day

18
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,601
for a trip to the beach.

19
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,082
I hope you can still dance Edward.

20
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:08,771
In a couple of days we will be doing

21
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,972
the cha cha in El Comandante's bedroom.

22
00:04:10,973 --> 00:04:12,892
I'll try to remember to bring
my dancing shoes, Richard.

23
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:15,574
Good morning Ray.

24
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,630
Mr. Hayes.

25
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:22,388
Miami.

26
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,399
And our Op center off Guatemala.

27
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:27,391
Pack a bathing suit Mr. Brocco.

28
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,543
We're going for a swim.

29
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:31,857
What do you make of
our chances for success?

30
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:35,479
If we get the support
that we've been promised

31
00:04:36,328 --> 00:04:37,671
I'd say it's fairly certain.

32
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:40,199
But if there are any doubts

33
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,486
I can still put out the fire.

34
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:43,405
It's gone beyond that.

35
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,065

Everybody is waiting for the good news.

39
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:54,931
Godspeed!

40
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,627

00:04:58,914 --> 00:04:59,873
We'll go fishing.

43
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:06,104
Yes sir.

44
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,505
He's been put on notice.

45
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:11,163
In Cuba,

46
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,247
sometime before dawn,

47
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,815
The invading forces' B-26 bombers

48
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,260
give air cover to men
landing on the beach.

49
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:22,457
As the sun rises

50
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,144
there is a surprised attack
from Castro's air force.

51
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,948
The B-26s are shot down.

52
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,673
Without air cover, the anti-Castro
forces' ships are attacked.

53
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:35,167
And the men are cut
off from their supplies.

54
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,374
The situation looks dire.

55
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,328
Where is the air support!

56
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,014
Where the hell is the Navy.

57
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:48,098
Would you throw something into
this vital point of the battle.

58
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,623

Two thousand militia
attacking blue beach

61
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,088
from east to west.

62
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,949
We need

63
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:07,886
close air support immediately!

64
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:12,888
Well, I am destroying all my
equipment and communications.

65
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:14,610
I have nothing with which to fight.

66
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:15,951
I'm going to the woods.

67
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:17,367
I cannot wait for you.

68
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:18,416
I'm going to the woods.

69
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,917
They knew where to find us.

70
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,959
There's a stranger in our house.

71
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,041
I love you.

72
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,568
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

73
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:58,253
You are safe here with me.

74
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:10,162
I love you.

People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,326
You are safe here with me.

81
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:53,209
The president is saying they're going
to break the CIA into a thousand pieces.

82
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,285
Somebody on your desk
gave away the store.

83
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:01,616
Told the Soviets where to
find you at the Bay of Pigs.

84
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,087
You've got a problem very close to home.

85
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:09,375
There will be an extensive house
cleaning on your side of the street.

86
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,227
Fucking cigarette.

87
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,344
Are there any regulars
that can fit me anymore?

88
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,330
They didn't get it all.

89
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:27,583
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,446
Be careful.

91
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,030
Your name is on a must worry list.

92
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,115
Right at the very top.

93
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,734
You forgot your hat.

94
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,472
Somebody left a package
at my doorstep last night.

95
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,112
Have tech wash them right away.

96
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,283
I've been trying to reach you.

97
00:10:25,284 --> 00:10:26,242
Well, I haven't been staying
at the compound. ?????

98
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,427
I heard there was a setback.

99
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:34,718
Sometimes the best laid
plans of mice and men.

100
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:37,948
Be very careful.

101
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,467
I'll be fine. You worry too much.

102
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:42,871
Just please be careful.

103
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:43,831
Everything is fine.

104

Not a word to anyone.

112
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,663
How does it feel being a woman.

113
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:25,910

you've all taken an oath

118
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:33,716

119
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:35,704

to become members of

121
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,595
America's most secret society.

122

I don't think this is for me.

133
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,387
You can't take it personally.

134
00:14:25,388 --> 00:14:27,306
Getting pissed on is
personal Mr. Russell.

135
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:28,266
So I take it very personal.

136
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:31,116
Edward!

137
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:32,267
We're all in this together.

138
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:34,674

We're brothers for life.

Tell us Mr. Wilson, brother to brother

141
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,138
something you've never
told anyone before.

142
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:52,321
Your most guarded secret.

143
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,666
Something you will
need to trust us with.

144
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,726
It was the 4th of July, 1925.

145
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,729
I was six.

146
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,325
I was playing tag with a friend of mine.

147
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:14,076
and I tried to get away from him

148
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,254
so I ran up the stairs
into my parents room.

149
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:18,927
And I hid in a closet.

150
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:23,946
I looked at my father's clothes

151
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,598
and hanging there was
his admirals jacket.

152
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,418
And then I heard a sound.

153
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,912
and I saw my father

154
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,192
and I must have made a
noise because he turned

155
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:38,919
and came into the closet
and opened the door.

156
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:42,903
Have you ever made up a story Edward?

157
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:45,825
Told your friends something
you knew wasn't true?

158
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,197
And you know that if they found out...

159
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:49,668
they wouldn't like you anymore.

160
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,213
Why?

161
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:53,458
Because you lied to them.

162
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,695
You understand?

163
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,543
And he asked me if I knew was trust was.

164
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,757
And I said... trust is when
you feel safe with someone.

165
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,362
Like with my friends.

166
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:06,106
Like with you and mother.

167
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,066
And then he said.

168
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,986
Don't ever lie.

169
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:12,198
You shouldn't lie to your friends.

170
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,116
They won't trust you.

171
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:16,903
And you will have nothing.

172
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,672
And you'll never be safe.

173
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:26,014
He told me to go downstairs
and watch the fireworks.

174
00:16:27,882 --> 00:16:28,841
Because they'd started.

175
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,744
And then he shut the door.

176
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:44,453
The sound of the gunshot was very
different from the sound of the fireworks.

177
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,715
And even at six years old I new
there was a big big difference.

178
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,509
There was a lot of blood.

179
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:53,418
Father?

180
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:57,758
And in his left hand he held a note

181
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,276
that was sealed.

182
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:04,186
I don’t know why, buy I took the
note and I put it in my pocket.

183
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:07,826
I always said it was an accident.

184
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:12,040
It wasn't and accident.

185
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,091
My father killed himself.

00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:30,928
Congratulations Mr.
Wilson. I'm Richard Hayes.

188
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:33,058
Master of secrets and orders.

189
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:38,559
What did the note say?

190
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,438
I told you I never read the note.

191
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:42,723
You didn't read the note?

192
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:45,906
No.

193
00:17:50,807 --> 00:17:52,150
My father said your father

194
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:55,315
was going to be appointed
Secretary of the Navy

195
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:59,136
until his loyalty

196
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:01,074
was brought under question.

197
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,738
We're not going to have a
problem with your loyalty are we?

198
00:18:12,427 --> 00:18:13,386
And yet ...

199
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:14,824
a certain word

200
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,360
a glance, a guise,

201
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,147
will mirror never show?

202
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,699
reflecting not my gaze

203
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,906
but my uncertain question caught

204
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:25,593
inside a shadow of our shifting eyes.

205
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,890
That really is quite elegant Mr. Wilson

206
00:18:33,218 --> 00:18:34,464
Good order. Very precise.

207
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:37,156
Feeling of the unknown.

208
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:41,379
Fine poetry is the music of mathematics.

209
00:18:42,796 --> 00:18:44,043
Numbers.

210
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:45,029
Singing.

211
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:47,303
You have to look behind the words

212
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,643
to understand their meaning.

213
00:18:51,968 --> 00:18:53,886
Right. Well, good night gentlemen.

214
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:56,512
Mr. Wilson

215
00:18:56,896 --> 00:19:00,156
May I see you in my
office for a few words?

216
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:05,272
I am recommending you as editor of
our poetry magazine, The Politicus.

217
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,088
I'm honored. Thank you.

218
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,719
I appreciate your faith in me.

219
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:13,500
Never be ashamed of
your abilities, Edward.

220
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:30,592
Isn't there a picture that used to sit

221
00:19:30,593 --> 00:19:33,374
on the mantle there, and there
was a group of soldiers...

222
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:36,192
It's my father's Crimean War regiment.

223
00:19:36,193 --> 00:19:37,152
The ?????

224
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:38,869
I remember.

225
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm having it mended.

226
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,942
I remembered it because it
reminded me of my father.

227
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:46,285
He was in the war.

228
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:51,994
I think we're being watched.

229
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:54,655
Watched? What do you mean?

230
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:56,529
There's a man in a hat.

231
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:05,513
I don't see anybody.

232
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:10,195
You know. There's so much I'd
like to share with you Edward.

233
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,208
and I hardly know
anything about you at all.

234
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,660
Other that you being a
particularly bright student.

235
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,413
I feel that we have a

236
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:24,899
kind of kindred spirit.

237
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:29,577
I really should be going.

238
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:31,496
No. I've started to write something.

239
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:33,347
Perhaps you'd like to hear it?

240
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,361
A bud has burst on the upper bough

241
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,815
the linnet sang in my heart today

242
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:49,667
I know where the pale green grasses show

243
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:52,793
By a tiny runnel, off the way,

244
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:55,156
And the earth is wet.

245
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,745
A cuckoo said in my brain.

246
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,078
Not yet. Not yet.

247
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:03,081
I haven't finished it.

248
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:28,261
Excuse me.

249
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:31,952
Excuse me.

250
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,053
Please.

251
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,441
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:42,497
I can't hear.

253
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,547
What's your name?

254
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,287
Edward.

255
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:02,584
I'm sorry. Would you say it again?

256
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,901
I have to read your lips.

257
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,802
Edward.

258
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:09,233
Hello. Edward.

259
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,791
I'm Laura.

260
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:12,656
I'm sorry.

261
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:14,383
Would you say that again?

262
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,484
There isn't one person in a hundred

263
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:44,923
who would walk by a hat on a bench

264
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:46,267
without giving it a second look.

265
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:49,586
That says a lot about you Mr. Wilson.

266
00:22:49,587 --> 00:22:51,120
You don't distract easily.

267
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:54,938
She's a very pretty girl.

268
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:58,505
Sam Murach. I'm with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

269
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,646
Mind if I walk along with you?

270
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,738
I had a chance to have a talk
with a fraternity brother of yours.

271
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:13,273
John Russell. The senator's son.

272
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,306
John said you might help us.

273
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:18,077
You're friendly with Dr. Fredericks?

274
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,379
He's my thesis advisor
if that's what you mean.

275
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,010
He's been recruiting faculty members

276
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,642
and students to join an organization

277
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:25,177
called the American-German
Cultural Committee.

278
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:27,374
It's a Nazi front.

279
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,334
Does he talk to you about that?

280
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,136
I'm a poetry student Mr. Murach.

281
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:36,083
I'm not political.

282
00:23:36,235 --> 00:23:38,153
We'd be very interested in
finding out the names of some

283
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:39,593
of the other organizers
for the cultural committee.

284
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:43,513
Are you asking me to
spy on Dr. Fredericks?

285
00:23:43,876 --> 00:23:45,603
I'm asking you to be a good citizen.

286
00:23:53,138 --> 00:23:54,288
You blow that thing up it'll be fine.

287
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:03,687
I'll be seeing you.

288
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:09,647
In Poland, Hitler watches German
regiments steam across the river San.

289
00:24:10,153 --> 00:24:11,400
This was part of the river line

290
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,470
which the invading army
forced in its flanking drive

291
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,814
through southern Poland.

292
00:24:16,678 --> 00:24:19,459
The Nazi Fuehrer make a quick
tour in the conquered nation

293
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,241
among the soldiers in captured towns.

294
00:24:23,184 --> 00:24:25,965
Hitler has given the
word of War and War it is.

295
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,363
Poland has been guaranteed
by Great Britain.... ?????

296
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:31,434
It is a great privilege to have
with us here tonight Mr. Haupt.

297
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:33,464
The Fuehrer’s education minister.

298
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:34,655
Mr. Haupt.

299
00:24:35,231 --> 00:24:36,407
Good evening.

300
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,367
Thank you Dr. Fredericks,

301
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:40,149
and members of the
American-German cultural committee

302
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,356
for giving me the opportunity
to come to you here.

303
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,316
Germany has always been a country....

304
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,309
Excuse me.

305
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,742
Someone's in here!

306
00:25:57,084 --> 00:25:58,523
Are you enjoying yourself Edward?

307
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,483
Very much so.

308
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,018
I'd like you to meet,

309
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,936
Mr. Haupt.

310
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:06,611
Dr. Manheim

311
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,625
Yes. We met.

312
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:09,832
I've been asked by the faculty chairman

313
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,558
to relinquish my post here at Yale.

314
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,402
Now, you'll hear many

315
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,992
reasons to what caused my departure.

316
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:20,059
Suffice is to say

317
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,978
I'm leaving with my name intact.

318
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,175
Good luck in your endeavors.

319
00:26:31,564 --> 00:26:33,098
Oh, Edward.

320
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:37,891
What did I do to deserve this?

321
00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:40,609
Have you such little regard for me

322
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,568
that you betray me for my

323
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:42,528
political beliefs?

324
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:44,981
You know and I know

325
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,195
Trumbull Stickney wrote
that poem in 1902.

326
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,388
You were my teacher.

327
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:53,550
You betrayed me.

328
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:05,058
<i>piano playing</i>

329
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,170
I thought we were going to a party.

330
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:23,720
You want to protect me
from them. Don't you?

331
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,170
No.

332
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:26,534
You think they will make fun of me....

333
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,528
That's not it. That's not true.

334
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:30,338
It's OK.

335
00:27:37,815 --> 00:27:39,733
I'm happy to be with you.

336
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:49,859
Would you like to dance?

337
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,538
I'm not a very good dancer.

338
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:54,368
That's alright. I'm not
a good dancer either.

339
00:28:05,276 --> 00:28:07,194
How does this song go?

340
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,476
Blue sky

341
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:19,769
smiling at me

342
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:26,825
nothing but blue sky

343
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:31,763
do I see.

344
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,626
Excuse me everybody,
I have an announcement.

345
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:44,403
I've just been told England and
France declared war on Germany.

346
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:47,598
But please continue dancing
and enjoying our music

347
00:28:48,334 --> 00:28:50,155
and I'll update you as
information comes in.

348
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:51,339
Thank you.

349
00:29:05,672 --> 00:29:07,590
Before long, we'll be at war too.

350
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,519
Would you like to get a room for us.

351
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:54,202
Turn down the light.

352
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:06,822
I can't.

353
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,658
I can't.

354
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:27,756
Good night.

355
00:30:28,223 --> 00:30:29,182
Good night.

356
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:41,022
Thank you Edward.

357
00:30:42,612 --> 00:30:43,571
For what?

358
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:45,645
For being so nice.

359
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:15,498
In view of the fact we're taking a

360
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:18,089
propaganda lambasting around the world

361
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,721
Why is it not useful, Sir

362
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:21,448
for us to explore with you

363
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:25,188
the real facts behind
this or our motivations.

364
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:27,388
There's an old saying that a

365
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:30,330
victory has a hundred fathers
and defeat is an orphan.

366
00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:31,894
And I wouldn't be surprised if...

367
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:37,876
Hello Edward.

368
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:43,558
What are you doing here.

369
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:45,128
There are only a handful of us

370
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:46,568
until moment zero

371
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,965
who know where we were
going to land in Cuba.

372
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:51,911
One of us couldn't keep a secret.

373
00:31:54,137 --> 00:31:55,561
I know it wasn't me.

374
00:31:56,454 --> 00:31:59,043
Mr. Allen ask for
the Zapata list of personnel

375
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,770
who participated in the operation.

376
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:04,238
I don't have one.

377
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,240
Tell Mr. Allen I give
him the list personally.

378
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:07,273
We're in the same boat together.

379
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:10,816
A leaking boat.

380
00:32:10,817 --> 00:32:12,735
Don't ever think we're in
the same boat Mr. Hayes.

381
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:14,270
We're either going to sink or swim.

382
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:16,374
Together

383
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:19,793
People like us..

384
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:22,209
we don't let each other drown.

385
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:34,370
I've said as much as I
feel can be usefully said

386
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,619
by me.

387
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,113
In regard to the events
of the past few days.

388
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:39,683
through the statements,

389
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:42,549
detailed discussions.

390
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:44,151
I'm not to....

391
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,405
Mother. Father.

392
00:32:58,163 --> 00:32:59,889
This is Edward Wilson.

393
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:00,849
Mrs. Russell.

394
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:01,809
Senator.

395
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,344
Yes. It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

396
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,285
Phillip and Toddy Allen.

397
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:09,832
Mr. Allen was president
of Bones class of '12.

398
00:33:10,141 --> 00:33:11,388
Welcome to our little clubhouse.

399
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:12,347
Thank you.

400
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:13,307
Where's Clover?

401
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:14,724
Ah. There she is.

402
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:20,037
This is my sister Clover.

403
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:22,715
Hello. I'm Edward.

404
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:24,634
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

405
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:28,593
Bonesmen.

406
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,176
All here!

407
00:33:32,598 --> 00:33:34,134
Reverend Collin will offer grace.

408
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:36,273
Bonesmen first. Dear God...

409
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:37,424
God second

410
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:40,494
we thank you for guiding
the Evans' family trust

411
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,892
in the care of our beloved island.

412
00:33:43,528 --> 00:33:46,788
So that we may come here with
our families and our friends

413
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:49,282
In comfort and in privacy.

414
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:58,432
He said he was going to ask me to dance.

415
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:01,458
Here we go.

416
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:19,160
Don't you dance Mr. Wilson.

417
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:20,515
Nobody asked me.

418
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:22,544
Oh.

419
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:25,792
Well.

420
00:34:26,796 --> 00:34:28,522
I think I will take my chances.

421
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:31,763
I'm asking you.

422
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:52,345
John is very fond of you.

423
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,975
And I am very fond of him.

424
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,595
He's talking of going off
to fight with the English.

425
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,002
My father isn't particularly
pleased about it. Because

426
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,335
He's one of the organizers
of America First.

427
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,143
I'm not very good for an
isolationist's son to go off to war

428
00:35:06,144 --> 00:35:06,816
what if....

429
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:08,752
Your brother John is a
man of great conviction.

430
00:35:09,713 --> 00:35:10,863
I admire him.

431
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:11,823
What about you Mr. Wilson?

432
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:12,783
What do you believe in?

433
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,289
Are you in school?

434
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:26,643
You don't say very much. Do you?

435
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:29,236
When there is something worth saying...

436
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:32,218
Oh!

437
00:35:32,323 --> 00:35:33,186
Well.

438
00:35:33,187 --> 00:35:34,146
I think I'm going to like you.

439
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,313
Mr. Hayes.

440
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,939
Gentlemen.

441
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,757
General William Sullivan.

442
00:35:52,863 --> 00:35:54,206
Mr. Edward Wilson.

443
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,166
It's a great honor sir.

444
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,989
I'd get up and shake your hand

445
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,812
but my fucking feet are killing me.

446
00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:01,402
Something about too much
sugar in my blood and my urine.

447
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,345
So when do you boys start
your pissing contest?

448
00:36:06,304 --> 00:36:08,606
I'll excuse myself.

449
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,505
Thank you Phillip.

450
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,693
Why don't you sit down.

451
00:36:29,392 --> 00:36:32,077
You understand that whatever we
discuss here doesn’t leave this room?

452
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:34,431
Of course.

453
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,999
We'll eventually get
involved in this war.

454
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,959
Not because we want to

455
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,919
but because we have to

456
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,879
and we should.

457
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:44,996
And the president has asked me to look
into creating a foreign intelligence service

458
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:45,956
and if that happens

459
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:48,643
I'll be looking for patriotic,
honorable, bright young men,

460
00:36:48,644 --> 00:36:51,233
from the right backgrounds to
manage the various departments.

461
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:53,728
In other words no Jews or negroes

462
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:55,455
and very few Catholics.

463
00:36:55,456 --> 00:36:56,894
That's only because I'm a Catholic.

464
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:02,401
You'd be trained and commissioned
in the Army and posted overseas.

465
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:05,758
If it's something you’re interested in you'd
have to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice.

466
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:10,217
I don't want your answer
now. Just think about it.

467
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:14,180
But this isn't a bunch of fraternity boys
sitting around playing with their pricks.

468
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,549
This is for real.

469
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:16,851
For America.

470
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:23,709
Let’s go.

471
00:37:26,935 --> 00:37:27,894
Have fun.

472
00:37:28,174 --> 00:37:29,133
Behave yourselves.

473
00:37:34,827 --> 00:37:36,936
I'm supposed to be looking
for the perfect husband.

474
00:37:37,884 --> 00:37:39,706
Are you the perfect husband Mr. Wilson?

475
00:37:41,148 --> 00:37:42,682
Perfect in every way.

476
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:50,176
Then is there some reason that you won't

477
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,709
put your arm around me?

478
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,991
You are the one...

479
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:08,565
I like this.

480
00:38:08,878 --> 00:38:10,700
Very smart.

481
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:16,646
... or under the sun.

482
00:38:19,374 --> 00:38:20,333
Whether near to me

483
00:38:23,436 --> 00:38:25,929
Do you have a problem
with woman Mr. Bones.

484
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:00,799
Do you love me?

485
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,759
What?

486
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,720
Tell me you love me.

487
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,179
Do you love me.

488
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,139
I love you. I love you.

489
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,099
No. I still don't believe you.

490
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:10,807
Say it. Say it.

491
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:12,243
Look at me.

492
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:13,247
Stop. Stop.

493
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:14,910
I love you.

494
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:33,852
As soon as the world comes to
it's senses, I'm going to travel.

495
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,631
London. Paris. Rome.

496
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,639
You can come with me.

497
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:51,726
Is everything alright?

498
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:57,552
Fine.

499
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,290
We are worlds apart.

500
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,149
What do you mean?

501
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,125
I feel like I'm just a curiosity to you.

502
00:40:10,584 --> 00:40:11,543
That. That is not. That's not true.

503
00:40:12,835 --> 00:40:13,794
I feel like

504
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,149
I'm not real to you.

505
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,109
That is not true.

506
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,332
Anyway...

507
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:18,953
That's not how I feel about you.

508
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,417
Edward.

509
00:40:46,455 --> 00:40:47,414
John?

510
00:40:48,172 --> 00:40:49,131
I've been looking everywhere for you.

511
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:56,828
My sister.

512
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,788
She's pregnant

513
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:10,576
I know you'll do what's expected of you.

514
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:21,685
Do you Edward L. Wilson

515
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,947
take Margaret N. Russell

516
00:41:24,874 --> 00:41:26,791
to be your lawfully wedded wife.

517
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,989
to love, honor and cherish

518
00:41:30,513 --> 00:41:32,431
in sickness and in health

519
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:36,274
in good times and in bad times

520
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:37,494
until death do you apart.

521
00:41:38,003 --> 00:41:38,962
I do.

522
00:41:39,654 --> 00:41:41,572
I now pronounce you man and wife.

523
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:58,668
A man if uniform want to see you.

524
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:00,624
Excuse me mother.

525
00:42:02,317 --> 00:42:03,468
Did your mother or I ever
tell you where we ....

526
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:08,843
Mr. Edward Wilson.

527
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:10,910
We need to speak alone sir.

528
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,669
Would you like to sit down?

529
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,629
No. Thank you sir.

530
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,549
General Sullivan sends his regards.

531
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:19,375
and to ask you if your still interested
in seeing the rest of the World.

532
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,280
Yes I...I certainly would be.

533
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:26,278
Good afternoon sir.

534
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:27,717
Thank you.

535
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:46,563
My orders came through.

536
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,523
I'll be going overseas.

537
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:51,094
When?

538
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:54,320
In one week.

539
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,688
What are you going to do Edward?

540
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:58,002
Save the World?

541
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,310
Your are safe here with me.

542
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,445
The photograph is particularly dark.

543
00:43:22,908 --> 00:43:24,826
As we can see there is a Caucasian man

544
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:26,169
and a negro woman.

545
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,188
The resolution breaks
down pretty quickly.

546
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,510
The film stock is definitely Russian.

547
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:32,653
Low grade.

548
00:43:35,357 --> 00:43:36,796
One of the areas we've been focusing on

549
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:37,756
is the mosquito netting...

550
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:39,737
The mosquito netting is predominantly in

551
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,210
Africa, southeast Asia,
any tropical climate.

552
00:43:43,211 --> 00:43:44,841
The window curtains here

553
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:48,773
have a distinctive pattern
on them of Baobab trees.

554
00:43:48,774 --> 00:43:50,596
Also seen in Africa.

555
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:52,459
Next to the curtains

556
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,090
we can see the building's ballestry.

557
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:57,135
There's a pigeon here. It's
kind of hard to make out.

558
00:43:57,756 --> 00:43:59,003
Pigeons are mostly found in urban areas

559
00:43:59,004 --> 00:43:59,963
town squares...

560
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,800
If you listen closely
you will hear an airplane.

561
00:44:05,048 --> 00:44:06,295
We've washed it out.

562
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:11,312
By the sound of the
thrust of the jet engines

563
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:13,423
we can determine that
it's a plane taking off

564
00:44:13,424 --> 00:44:14,958
no more than 1000 feet off the ground.

565
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:17,165
Which would further
suggest a large urban area.

566
00:44:17,643 --> 00:44:18,890
On a section of the tape

567
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:20,137
when you clear up background noise

568
00:44:20,138 --> 00:44:21,960
you can hear a female voice.

569
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:22,920
I love you.

570
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,394
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

571
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:28,097
Your are safe here.

572
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:29,998
Assuming we're talking
about the same woman,

573
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:32,026
the linguists tell us
her accent is French.

574
00:44:34,157 --> 00:44:36,305
There's one word here
we can't make it out yet.

575
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,686
There is an unidentifiable
noise washing her out.

576
00:44:42,518 --> 00:44:44,660
Placed throughout the
recording at a high frequency

577
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:46,843
suggests an air raid siren of some sort.

578
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:49,456
We're going to keep playing with it.

579
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:56,668
This is the time fore
everyone to stand together

580
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,075
and hold firm

581
00:44:58,561 --> 00:44:59,664
as they are doing.

582
00:44:59,987 --> 00:45:01,689
I express my admiration

583
00:45:02,268 --> 00:45:03,348
for the exemplary manner

584
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:07,221
in which all the air raid
precaution services of London

585
00:45:07,222 --> 00:45:08,181
are being discharged.

586
00:45:08,182 --> 00:45:09,141
May I help you?

587
00:45:09,805 --> 00:45:10,102
Yes.

588
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:12,516
I here to see the tailor
about a fitting for a new suit.

589
00:45:12,618 --> 00:45:15,459
Certainly, and what kind of suit
would you be interested this evening?

590
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,419
A tweed or worsted.

591
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,378
Perhaps a nice gabardine.

592
00:45:17,379 --> 00:45:19,641
Perhaps, a worsted and a tweed.

593
00:45:19,642 --> 00:45:20,810
Both single breasted?

594
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:21,553
Yes.

595
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:22,932
Two or three buns, sir.

596
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:24,003
Three buns.

597
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:28,690
If you might come this way, please sir.

598
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:39,943
Please.  Our senior tailor
will be right with you, sir.

599
00:45:40,006 --> 00:45:40,965
Thank you.

600
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:51,700
Welcome to London.

601
00:45:54,275 --> 00:45:56,024
You're going to have to learn

602
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:57,846
as quickly and thoroughly as  possible

603
00:45:57,847 --> 00:46:00,123
the English system of intelligence.

604
00:46:00,231 --> 00:46:03,369
The black cards, particularly
counter intelligence.

605
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,941
The uses of information, disinformation

606
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:09,727
and how their use is ultimately...

607
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:11,131
power.

608
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,558
They've agreed to open
their operations to us.

609
00:46:20,026 --> 00:46:21,588
They can't win the war without us

610
00:46:21,662 --> 00:46:23,060
but they don't really want us here.

611
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:26,626
Intelligence, is their mother's
milk and they don't like sharing

612
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,812
the royal tit with people
that don't have titles.

613
00:46:30,029 --> 00:46:31,947
Your London tutor is
waiting to meet you.

614
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:33,489
This way sir.

615
00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:01,509
I should've know better
that to use Stickney.

616
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:03,831
Job well done Mr. Wilson.

617
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:06,110
You blew a two year operation for me.

618
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,034
I told general Sullivan
to keep an eye on you.

619
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:10,823
Just as well, really.

620
00:47:11,636 --> 00:47:15,077
I was beginning to long for
the bone chilling cold of home.

621
00:47:19,399 --> 00:47:20,581
It isn't personal.

622
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:27,097
Mr. Carlson.

623
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:28,888
Is this the American Trade Bureau?

624
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:29,944
Which product?

625
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:33,746
Dried goods.

626
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:35,436
You’re late.

627
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:36,704
Yeah. That's what my mother said.

628
00:47:39,686 --> 00:47:40,785
Raymond Ducca Brocco,

629
00:47:40,786 --> 00:47:43,608
born may 8th, 1907, New York City.

630
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:45,430
St. Ignatius High School,

631
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:46,390
Fordham University.

632
00:47:46,391 --> 00:47:47,350
Married Anita Delveccio.

633
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:48,310
2 children...

634
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:49,270
Stephanie and David.

635
00:47:54,816 --> 00:47:56,421
Six foot two, 182 pounds,

636
00:47:56,422 --> 00:47:57,380
black hair, brown eyes,

637
00:47:57,381 --> 00:47:58,906
military record, 5 years,

638
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,985
intelligence.

639
00:48:00,434 --> 00:48:01,668
Anything you'd like to add?

640
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:03,140
You want to look up my ass too?

641
00:48:05,142 --> 00:48:06,833
You're working for me Sergeant Brocco.

642
00:48:06,834 --> 00:48:07,793
I'm working for the
Unites States government...

643
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:09,868
In this office I am the
United States government.

644
00:48:09,894 --> 00:48:11,818
You're pretty sure of yourself
for somebody who just began...

645
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:13,731
They wouldn't tell me your name.

646
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,316
Then how do you know you're
not in the wrong place.

647
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:18,031
They said you were a serious SOB
that didn't have any a sense of humor.

648
00:48:18,889 --> 00:48:19,649
Can't be two of you.

649
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,331
<i>phone rings</i>

650
00:48:29,966 --> 00:48:30,997
Are you going to answering it.

651
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:32,686
Depends if I'm working
for you or if I'm not.

652
00:48:32,757 --> 00:48:34,899
One of your jobs, sergeant,
is answering the telephone.

653
00:48:36,418 --> 00:48:37,292
Yes sir.

654
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:43,686
Use your tradecraft well,

655
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,941
particularly in the
use of black propaganda.

656
00:48:46,281 --> 00:48:47,913
and the ingredient known as playback.

657
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:50,831
Understanding how effectively
your own disinformation

658
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,112
is actually working on the enemy.

659
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:55,593
It's almost four.

660
00:48:55,745 --> 00:48:57,416
How do you spell syphilis.
Is it one L or two.

661
00:48:57,709 --> 00:48:59,237
Syphilis.

662
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:00,595
One....I think.

663
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,551
It's vital to penetrate the
enemies intelligent services.

664
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,488
Push them into an
unreal world, as it were.

665
00:49:08,582 --> 00:49:09,717
Doctor in England today

666
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,935
announced that medical records taken
from Adolf Hitler's personal physician

667
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:14,064
Dr. Theodore Morell

668
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:16,452
reveal that Mr. Hitler
had contracted syphilis

669
00:49:16,485 --> 00:49:19,879
while serving the German armed
forces during World War I.

670
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:22,278
The very qualities that make
a good intelligence officer

671
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:24,406
a suspicions mind

672
00:49:24,903 --> 00:49:26,794
a love of complexity and detail,

673
00:49:27,189 --> 00:49:30,109
are the very qualities of
someone you've been observing.

674
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,982
Good evening Lord Cooper.

675
00:49:43,153 --> 00:49:45,370
I have some information that
might be of some interest to you.

676
00:49:45,404 --> 00:49:48,854
The mental facility to detect
conspiracies and betrayal

677
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:52,542
are the same qualities most likely
to corrode natural judgment.

678
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:55,576
Everything that seems clear is bent

679
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:58,202
and everything that seems bent is clear.

680
00:49:58,235 --> 00:50:01,211
Trapped in reflections
you must learn to recognize

681
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:03,660
when a lie masquerades as the truth.

682
00:50:03,694 --> 00:50:05,693
And then deal with it efficiently,

683
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:06,940
dispassionately.

684
00:50:07,242 --> 00:50:09,627
We know you've been passing
information to the German high command.

685
00:50:09,628 --> 00:50:11,605
Don't give anyone time to think.

686
00:50:11,606 --> 00:50:13,973
Now, I'm going to offer
you one of two choices.

687
00:50:13,974 --> 00:50:15,757
You set the tone of the discussion.

688
00:50:15,758 --> 00:50:16,717
And quickly come to the point.

689
00:50:17,303 --> 00:50:21,104
Either you can be executed for treason
or you can continue to spy for the enemy

690
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:23,439
and provide them with the
information we provide you.

691
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,479
Pass this on to your German friends

692
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:26,821
and if I find out it wasn't done

693
00:50:26,854 --> 00:50:27,833
there won't be a second chance.

694
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:29,867
You, quite simply, behave as a spy.

695
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:30,803
Do we understand each other?

696
00:50:30,804 --> 00:50:33,049
How do we know he won't
be working for two master?

697
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:34,317
Precisely?

698
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:35,619
We don't.

699
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,041
How do I know if I can even trust you.

700
00:50:38,074 --> 00:50:39,050
You won't.

701
00:50:40,217 --> 00:50:43,248
I mean, I hope you're lucky enough
you'll meet someone you trust.

702
00:50:44,076 --> 00:50:45,404
I've got to say....

703
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,375
I haven't.

704
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:53,546
You must be young Edward.

705
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:55,927
Dr. Frederick has told
me so much about you.

706
00:50:56,438 --> 00:50:57,268
Arch Cummings.

707
00:50:57,286 --> 00:50:57,962
Nice to meet you.

708
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,774
Nice to meet you.

709
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:01,759
I understand we are like
minded on many things

710
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,403
Good school boys. Yale. Cambridge.

711
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:06,402
Dreamers.

712
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,929
They say he's been an
exceptional intelligence officer.

713
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:12,913
You have to have a steady mind and

714
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,308
and an unwavering sense of
belief in what you're doing

715
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,440
and to be a hopeless romantic.

Hello.

720
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:41,324
Yes, Yeah Ah, Yes. I can hear you.

721

Thank you for telling me.

722
00:51:48,118 --> 00:51:48,848
Good bye.

723
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:54,737
We had a boy.

724
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:58,667
Would you mind if we called him Edward?

725
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:00,818
If we called him Edward Jr?

726
00:52:01,479 --> 00:52:03,134
I love that. I think it's perfect.

727
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:05,061
Fit of a king.

728
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:08,285
That's what I was
thinking. Fit for a king.

729
00:52:08,323 --> 00:52:09,124
You like Edward?

730
00:52:10,967 --> 00:52:12,275
Oh. I think he likes it.

saving the World and keeping us safe?

733
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:19,606
Sometimes.

734
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:22,805
What color are his eyes?

735
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,519
<i>static</i>

736
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:28,012
Hello? Hello?

737
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:37,798
When he's old enough
you can read it to him.

738
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:39,348
It's a first edition.

739
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,594
Charles Dickens. A Christmas
Carol. It was my fathers'.

740
00:52:42,691 --> 00:52:45,335
He would read it to me when I was a boy.

741
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:46,939
Thank you.

742
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:51,388
I had an unfortunate discovery today.

743
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:57,513
A man that works for me said just as at my
door I found out he had given a rose to a woman.

744
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,265
with a small note, the rose was quite lovely.

745
00:53:00,266 --> 00:53:01,344
An Abyssinian rose.

746
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,104
With stem neatly wrapped in silk paper

747
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:05,666
quite beautiful and touching.

748
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:07,247
Save for the fact

749
00:53:07,535 --> 00:53:11,009
that the paper was filled with
secret writing for her German friends

750
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,901
detailing changes to the
American order of battle here.

751
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:16,248
Excuse me sir.

752
00:53:17,911 --> 00:53:19,027
Thank you.

753
00:53:19,123 --> 00:53:19,987
Thank you sir.

754
00:53:21,108 --> 00:53:22,565
How did the Irish poet say it?

755
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:23,525
Hmm?

756
00:53:23,526 --> 00:53:25,234
E'er friend for today,

757
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:28,030
is tomorrow's heartbreak

758
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,732
Do you know what my deepest fear is?

759
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:33,291
That I will end up....friendless.

760
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:35,240
Completely alone.

761
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,972
I think you two know each other.

762
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:41,947
Richard!

763
00:53:42,007 --> 00:53:42,758
Hello Edward.

764
00:53:42,759 --> 00:53:43,718
I didn't expect to see you.

765
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:46,264
Mr. Hayes has come over to work
with us in special operations.

766
00:53:46,904 --> 00:53:50,388
I hope you don't mind I invited
him to join our conversation.

767
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:03,938
I'm afraid our dear English teacher has
a bad habit of making easy friendships.

768
00:54:07,295 --> 00:54:09,924
You know, of course, about
his ridiculous sexual tastes.

769
00:54:14,945 --> 00:54:18,184
I'm afraid he is not being very
discriminating in his partners.

770
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:22,142
Some people are extremely
worried about his exposure.

771
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:29,466
I hope you two can help sort this
rather delicate matter out for us.

772
00:54:43,892 --> 00:54:46,186
Seem to me to be a
problem for the Bristish.

773
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,301
Why are we involved?

774
00:54:49,814 --> 00:54:51,931
The British are a civilized people.

775
00:54:52,827 --> 00:54:54,117
They don't ????? their own.

776
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:55,859
They have somebody do it for them.

777
00:54:58,258 --> 00:54:59,846
So why are you telling me.

778
00:55:00,845 --> 00:55:02,794
I'm giving you an opportunity to handle it.

779
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,323
Or somebody else will.

780
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:22,775
I'm sorry you've been brought into this.

781
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:27,810
If the headmaster won't listen to
reason who might want to tie your shoe.

782
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:31,594
Sorry it has to be this way.

783
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:35,029
It's not something I'm happy
about having to be doing.

784
00:55:47,795 --> 00:55:49,470
Have you thought at all about

785
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,064
maybe going back to
teaching again? Sometime?

786
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,631
They are concerned about my
personal associations.  Aren't they?

787
00:55:57,210 --> 00:55:59,642
Cambridge boys stick together like glue.

788
00:56:00,938 --> 00:56:03,290
I'm far too democratic in my taste for them.

789
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,090
They like pressed trousers
and proper buttons.

790
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:09,961
No.

791
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:12,571
I've done all the
teaching I intend to do.

792
00:56:13,643 --> 00:56:15,016
I am who I am.

793
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,027
I'll suffer that.

794
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,273
Please. You've given them all the service that you can.

795
00:56:27,038 --> 00:56:28,165
It's time to retire.

796
00:56:31,895 --> 00:56:33,899
The good schoolboy will be close by.

797
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:36,676
You won't want to know my response.

798
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:41,281
I understand.

799
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:42,957
If you want to tie your shoe.

800
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,396
It's a dirty business Edward.

801
00:56:47,397 --> 00:56:50,177
I've been part of it for far too long.

802
00:57:09,683 --> 00:57:13,304
You might want to think about getting
yourself a new pair of shoes Edward.

803
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,717
There's a wonderful shop at St. James'.

804
00:57:17,718 --> 00:57:19,468
Mr. Pendingbones.

805
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:22,053
He's boot maker to the king.

806
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:23,770
But then....

807
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:26,019
I suppose we all  are in our own way, aren’t we?

808
00:57:26,785 --> 00:57:28,019
boot makers to kings.

809
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:34,734
Get out while you still can.

810
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:41,078
While you still believe.

811
00:59:22,451 --> 00:59:23,957
I'm sorry.

812
00:59:31,874 --> 00:59:33,657
He knew too much.

813
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:38,879
You understand?

814
01:00:06,114 --> 01:00:07,673
It appears the word we couldn't make out

815
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:10,401
had it's sound wave significantly
clipped by whoever made this tape.

816
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:13,340
We restored it by amplifying specific frequencies

817
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:14,300
seen on the oscilloscope.

818
01:00:15,722 --> 01:00:17,334
Cochinos is Spanish for pigs.

819
01:00:17,335 --> 01:00:18,294
Let me hear it again.

820
01:00:23,509 --> 01:00:24,639
<i>cochinos</i>

821
01:00:25,051 --> 01:00:28,648
And the siren noise we couldn't
pinpoint before were hiding church bells.

822
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,759
For some reason other noises
were added to distort the bells.

823
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,239
In the makeup table's mirror

824
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,800
we can actually make out the
reflection of a church steeple

825
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:42,017
whose three belfries correspond
with the bells you hear.

826
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:46,995
The volume indicates that the church is across the street.

827
01:00:46,996 --> 01:00:48,813
Again, possibly on a town square.

828
01:00:49,718 --> 01:00:52,375
On the night stand, we can see a clock radio.

829
01:00:54,146 --> 01:00:56,066
It reads almost 10 o'clock

830
01:00:56,257 --> 01:00:58,016
which would correspond
with the church bells.

831
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:00,769
I also have audio of the ceiling fan.

832
01:01:02,113 --> 01:01:04,975
It's a four blade standard ceiling
fan. We don't know where it's from.

833
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:07,218
There is something here....

834
01:01:08,393 --> 01:01:09,671
could be nothing significant.

835
01:01:09,672 --> 01:01:11,537
Maybe a candle, a paper weight.

836
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:15,264
Or it may be something personal that we
can identify the people in the room with.

837
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:18,160
We are going to wash it
again. Maybe see what's there.

838
01:01:19,787 --> 01:01:21,103
How long till there some

839
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,654
definition as to exactly where we are?

840
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:27,338
We're going as quickly as we can sir.

841
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:39,407
How are Clover and your little boy?

842
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:41,348
Good. Thank you. You
know he is almost five.

843
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:44,492
You may ????? for yourself in London.

844
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:47,061
The World War is over.

845
01:01:47,295 --> 01:01:49,343
The war for the World has just begun

846
01:01:49,297 --> 01:01:50,384
and in every liberated country

847
01:01:50,385 --> 01:01:52,153
there will be a battle
between us and the Russians

848
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,295
for their hearts and minds.

849
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:57,313
Since we dropped the Bomb

850
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,296
they're feeling a little
short between the legs.

851
01:01:59,321 --> 01:02:01,591
But the Russians still live in the nineteenth century.

852
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:02,550
Beets and potatoes.

853
01:02:03,709 --> 01:02:05,126
All that will change dramatically.

854
01:02:05,127 --> 01:02:07,092
But right now, they're gobbling up territory

855
01:02:07,325 --> 01:02:09,105
taking home every
scientist they can steal.

856
01:02:09,595 --> 01:02:11,334
In ten years, they'll have a Bomb.

857
01:02:12,123 --> 01:02:15,095
We have to get anyone that can
be useful to us out of Berlin

858
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:15,773
before they do.

859
01:02:21,188 --> 01:02:22,413
Churchill was right.

860
01:02:23,503 --> 01:02:25,779
We shouldn't have stopped
marching until we reached Moscow.

861
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,483
They're from Switzerland.

862
01:02:30,484 --> 01:02:33,574
I had them sent, with a pouch, to Berlin.

863
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:35,561
They're a weakness of mine.

864
01:02:35,562 --> 01:02:38,374
When I was a child, my mother would
always reward me with a chocolate.

865
01:02:41,588 --> 01:02:42,865
It's a dreadful habit.

866
01:02:43,387 --> 01:02:45,351
The chocolates or seeking approval?

867
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:47,446
Both.

868
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:53,000
He was an officer it the Abwehr,
German military intelligence.

869
01:02:56,024 --> 01:03:00,069
He says he knows the location of certain
Nazi V-2 rocket scientist in hiding.

870
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,444
Ask him where he wants to go.

871
01:03:05,558 --> 01:03:07,786
He wants to go to Chicago.
He has relatives there.

872
01:03:08,463 --> 01:03:10,669
Tell him if he provides us
with the names and locations

873
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:13,446
of the scientists I'll
arrange an exit visa for him.

874
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:15,551
As soon as he serves his purpose,

875
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:16,971
turn him over to the Nazi catchers.

876
01:03:27,814 --> 01:03:29,242
The next ????? is a group commander

877
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:31,127
would like to speak with you about asylum.

878
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,975
It's very ugly, isn't it?

879
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:40,719
It isn't meant to be jewelry.

880
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:44,362
I lost the sound in one ear, altogether.

881
01:03:44,617 --> 01:03:47,693
I can hear with the help of the apparatus

882
01:03:47,694 --> 01:03:49,749
out of this ear, but they
say in one year or so....

883
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:51,243
You hardly notice it's there.

884
01:03:57,683 --> 01:04:00,252
The Russians are interested
in making a prisoner swap.

885
01:04:25,271 --> 01:04:29,582
We're prepare to offer you some
Jewish scientists liberated in the east

886
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:32,690
for some Nazi scientists
living here in Berlin.

887
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,455
These are the names
we're willing to discuss.

888
01:05:17,684 --> 01:05:20,851
I understand your
cryptonym for me is Ulysses.

889
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:25,396
Isn't that from the James
Joyce book or the Greek myth.

890
01:05:31,382 --> 01:05:33,730
Do you what our code name is for you?

891
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,452
Mother.

892
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:46,578
A took the first hot bath
yesterday I've taken in three years.

893
01:05:47,248 --> 01:05:49,177
Since the siege of Stalingrad.

894
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,933
I sat for hours...

895
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:55,966
looking out the window,

896
01:05:56,964 --> 01:05:58,221
soaking.

897
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:12,572
When I was a soldier

898
01:06:12,573 --> 01:06:14,258
my fingers we're frost bitten.

899
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:17,679
Since then, when I get cold

900
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,079
there is a pain.

901
01:06:23,464 --> 01:06:25,074
Maybe you shouldn't live in Russia.

902
01:06:27,345 --> 01:06:29,203
We all have our weaknesses.

903
01:06:31,464 --> 01:06:32,681
What is yours?

904
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:37,826
I had heard you were silent.

905
01:06:39,582 --> 01:06:41,084
Made of stone, they said.

906
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:44,185
What is the expression?

907
01:06:45,812 --> 01:06:47,436
The silence is deafening.

908
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:53,367
You're going to be a formidable

909
01:06:54,283 --> 01:06:55,824
adversary, Mother.

910
01:07:04,836 --> 01:07:07,127
I look forward to our association.

911
01:07:09,302 --> 01:07:11,623
I hope it lasts for a long time.

912
01:07:26,966 --> 01:07:28,311
I love you.

913
01:07:29,316 --> 01:07:32,157
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

914
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,988
You are safe here with me.

915
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:36,779
We were able to make
out the brand of the fan.

916
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,440
It's called a ?????. It's Belgian.

917
01:07:40,234 --> 01:07:41,704
The object on the night stand

918
01:07:42,286 --> 01:07:44,185
we're still trying to find out what this is.

919
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:47,134
We just can't get any
more definition out of it.

920
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:53,817
Who is this?

921
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,729
Who is this?

922
01:07:58,379 --> 01:07:59,306
Hello father.

923
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,278
You have a birthday coming up.

924
01:08:01,586 --> 01:08:03,029
I'm going to be five soon.

925
01:08:03,802 --> 01:08:05,622
Well you're a big boy.

926
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,712
?????

927
01:08:13,095 --> 01:08:14,268
Is your mother there?

928
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:16,042
What? I can't hear you.

929
01:08:18,634 --> 01:08:19,793
Is your mother there?

930
01:08:20,634 --> 01:08:22,638
She's getting dressed
to go out with her friend.

931
01:08:22,639 --> 01:08:23,957
He has a new car.

932
01:08:24,257 --> 01:08:25,401
He lets me drive with him.

933
01:08:28,412 --> 01:08:30,035
Hello Mr. Wilson, this is Edna.

934
01:08:30,036 --> 01:08:31,548
Mrs. Wilson is upstairs.

935
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:32,755
She's getting ready for dinner.

936
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:34,591
I'll tell her you are on the phone.

937
01:08:37,299 --> 01:08:38,342
I'll call back.

938
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,233
<i>door knocking</i>

939
01:08:45,973 --> 01:08:47,004
Pardon me.

940
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:50,084
Do you need me for anything else?

941
01:08:50,504 --> 01:08:51,846
No. Thank you.

942
01:08:52,573 --> 01:08:53,069
Guten Nacht.

943
01:08:53,356 --> 01:08:54,326
Guten Nacht.

944
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,230
Do you ever eat Mr. Wilson.

945
01:09:03,254 --> 01:09:04,150
I like to cook.

946
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:06,526
Would you like a home cooked meal?

947
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,963
Have you ever read Ovid's
Metamorphosis in the original Latin?

948
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:20,313
It's quite beautiful.

949
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:25,984
I grabbed the pile of dust

950
01:09:25,985 --> 01:09:26,944
and holding it up

951
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,996
foolishly ask for as many
birthdays as the grains of dust.

952
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,680
I forgot to ask that they be years of youth.

953
01:09:36,527 --> 01:09:37,040
Bravo

954
01:09:50,277 --> 01:09:51,642
I should be going.

955
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:01,355
Would you like to stay?

956
01:10:04,752 --> 01:10:05,780
Would you like me to.

957
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:08,986
I would like you to very much.

958
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:20,367
Maybe we can go somewhere together?

959
01:10:21,436 --> 01:10:23,199
The lakes in Bavaria are so beautiful.

960
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:26,765
There was an inn there before the war.

961
01:10:26,766 --> 01:10:28,565
where they served
breakfast in bed all day.

962
01:10:52,049 --> 01:10:53,008
Yena ?????

963
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,551
I hope you never go home.

964
01:11:00,864 --> 01:11:02,490
Bavaria is a really beautiful place.

965
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:05,756
I was born there.

966
01:11:05,757 --> 01:11:06,881
My grandmother

967
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:08,595
lived there.

968
01:11:09,716 --> 01:11:10,839
I really miss her.

969
01:11:13,045 --> 01:11:14,034
Why don't we go.

970
01:11:28,877 --> 01:11:31,160
I let a stranger into our house.

971
01:11:33,057 --> 01:11:34,655
<i>door knocking</i>

972
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:39,364
Dies da?

973
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,409
Danka.

974
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:41,114
Mother. Father is here.

975
01:12:41,643 --> 01:12:42,418
Mother.

976
01:12:48,938 --> 01:12:50,061
Hello Edward.

977
01:12:51,724 --> 01:12:52,596
Hello Clover.

978
01:12:56,389 --> 01:12:57,306
I ah.

979
01:12:59,702 --> 01:13:01,180
I like to be called Margaret now.

980
01:13:05,178 --> 01:13:06,478
It's very nice to see you.

981
01:13:08,776 --> 01:13:10,060
It's good to see you too.

982
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:14,767
I made something or you.

983
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:20,200
You see?

984
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:21,545
It's a ship.

985
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:24,021
But it's got

986
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:25,852
the flag of England.

987
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:29,742
And then I put a pirate flag there.

988
01:13:31,082 --> 01:13:31,649
And if you like

989
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:33,141
you can count

990
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,197
how many sails are there.

991
01:13:36,228 --> 01:13:37,288
You want to try that?

992
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,416
Fifteen.

993
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:45,432
That’s right.

994
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:47,397
Fifteen.

995
01:13:49,305 --> 01:13:50,462
No. No. It's yours.

996
01:13:50,883 --> 01:13:51,633
I made it for you.

997
01:14:06,862 --> 01:14:08,098
If it's alright with you I thought

998
01:14:09,087 --> 01:14:11,178
maybe we could sleep in
separate beds for a while.

999
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:13,195
Just until we can get
to know each other again.

1000
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:16,715
I made up the spare room.

1001
01:14:18,703 --> 01:14:19,392
All right.

1002
01:14:27,976 --> 01:14:29,513
What do you hear from your brother John.

1003
01:14:33,617 --> 01:14:35,543
I thought you knew he was killed in Burma.

1004
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:36,791
In 1944.

1005
01:14:38,989 --> 01:14:40,713
You never mentioned it
in any of your letters.

1006
01:14:43,998 --> 01:14:45,476
There wasn't very much to say.

1007
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,759
Six year is a long time.

1008
01:14:59,514 --> 01:15:00,777
I was lonely.

1009
01:15:00,778 --> 01:15:02,663
And I was with a man, once.

1010
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,205
He wasn't very interesting.

1011
01:15:11,286 --> 01:15:12,793
Were you with anyone?

1012
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:17,218
It was a mistake.

1013
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:36,319
Thank you for the
ship you made.  For me.

1014
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:40,468
Your welcome.

1015
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:43,033
I'm glad you like it.

1016
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:47,094
Mother said you were at the war.

1017
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:50,568
Did you fight? Did you kill anybody?

1018
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:54,871
No.

1019
01:15:58,785 --> 01:15:59,634
Good night.

1020
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,289
Good night.

1021
01:16:20,808 --> 01:16:23,093
Hello Father. Hello Edward. Hello

1022
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,167
Hello dear.

1023
01:16:25,168 --> 01:16:26,750
There is somebody waiting
for you in the den.

1024
01:16:29,244 --> 01:16:29,966
General!

1025
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:33,384
Edward.

1026
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,055
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this.

1027
01:16:37,056 --> 01:16:38,553
You wife kindly helped me to a drink.

1028
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,386
My feet!

1029
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:42,862
I keep cutting off pieces of them.

1030
01:16:43,657 --> 01:16:45,841
It's not dignified for a man
to have to die from the feet up.

1031
01:16:52,334 --> 01:16:55,449
Well, while everybody has been
feeling good about themselves

1032
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,614
the Soviets, without firing a shot
have taken over half the World.

1033
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:00,346
They're breathing down our necks.

1034
01:17:00,623 --> 01:17:02,253
They'll be in our back
yard before you know it.

1035
01:17:02,727 --> 01:17:03,827
So I've been telling the President

1036
01:17:03,985 --> 01:17:06,448
about our need to create a
foreign intelligence service

1037
01:17:06,449 --> 01:17:08,845
one that will do in peace time what
it was asked to do during the war.

1038
01:17:09,986 --> 01:17:11,895
Phillip Allen will be heading the agency

1039
01:17:11,896 --> 01:17:13,214
Richard Hayes will be his exec

1040
01:17:13,247 --> 01:17:14,914
and you'll be taking division C.

1041
01:17:14,915 --> 01:17:17,450
Special operations that
report only to the director.

1042
01:17:18,203 --> 01:17:19,872
It will be limited to overseas, obviously.

1043
01:17:19,873 --> 01:17:21,568
Subversive operations,

1044
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:23,315
intelligence gathering and analysis.

1045
01:17:24,041 --> 01:17:26,480
And I'd be interested in
your thoughts about this.

1046
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,274
Particularly, in your area of
expertise. Counter intelligence.

1047
01:17:31,382 --> 01:17:33,404
I'd be glad to help in any way I can.

1048
01:17:33,986 --> 01:17:34,598
That's all right.

1049
01:17:34,784 --> 01:17:36,854
Edward. Go outside.

1050
01:17:38,143 --> 01:17:39,132
Excuse me sir.

1051
01:17:39,312 --> 01:17:40,232
Margaret.

1052
01:17:49,303 --> 01:17:50,392
Thank you.

1053
01:17:59,248 --> 01:18:03,191
I have to tell you, I have some
real problems with this whole thing.

1054
01:18:03,192 --> 01:18:04,151
Despite how much we need it.

1055
01:18:05,727 --> 01:18:08,710
I'm concerned that too much power
will end up in the hands of too few.

1056
01:18:09,265 --> 01:18:12,722
It's always in someone's best interest
to promote enemies, real or imagined.

1057
01:18:13,017 --> 01:18:15,169
I see this as America's eyes and ears.

1058
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,551
I don't want it to become
it's heart and soul.

1059
01:18:19,373 --> 01:18:21,275
So I told the President,
for this to work

1060
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:23,907
they’re going to have to be some
kind of civilian oversight.

1061
01:18:24,222 --> 01:18:25,192
Oversight?

1062
01:18:26,797 --> 01:18:28,761
How can you have a covert organization

1063
01:18:28,762 --> 01:18:30,203
if you have people
looking over your shoulder?

1064
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:32,040
You know who gave Hitler his power?

1065
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:33,682
The clerks and the book keepers.

1066
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:35,642
The civil servants.

1067
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:38,461
I have this one weakness.

1068
01:18:39,364 --> 01:18:40,483
I believe in a just God.

1069
01:18:41,823 --> 01:18:44,100
I always seem to err on
the side of democracy.

1070
01:18:50,741 --> 01:18:52,903
This must be a nice
place to raise a family.

1071
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:55,044
I never had the time.

1072
01:18:56,563 --> 01:18:57,836
I'll be dead in less than a year.

1073
01:19:00,964 --> 01:19:02,260
I love this country.

1074
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:05,419
We all do sir. We all do.

1075
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:16,550
No matter what anyone tells you,

1076
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:17,975
there'll be no one you can really trust.

1077
01:19:22,684 --> 01:19:25,063
I'm afraid when it's all said and
done we're all just clerks too.

1078
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:47,319
I was under the impression that

1079
01:19:47,352 --> 01:19:49,353
Dr. Ibanez supported a democracy.

1080
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:51,160
I'm afraid he's changed his mind.

1081
01:19:51,726 --> 01:19:53,966
The doctor started to
believe his own propaganda.

1082
01:19:54,216 --> 01:19:55,686
I mean you dream this guy, Edward.

1083
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:56,645
Help, get him elected.

1084
01:19:56,646 --> 01:19:57,873
Those are the Soviets

1085
01:19:57,907 --> 01:20:00,120
International Department
of Central Committee members

1086
01:20:00,121 --> 01:20:01,081
Trudnikov and Kosholnikov.

1087
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:05,634
that have become overly interested
in their natural resources

1088
01:20:05,712 --> 01:20:06,670
particularly coffee.

1089
01:20:08,744 --> 01:20:11,129
Our economic interests
have become compromised.

1090
01:20:11,903 --> 01:20:15,254
To say nothing of the dangers of
a Soviet presence so close to home.

1091
01:20:17,205 --> 01:20:20,090
For security ????? we must
establish our own presence there.

1092
01:20:21,815 --> 01:20:22,560
Stop!

1093
01:20:22,561 --> 01:20:23,520
Can you go back.

1094
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,770
Go. Go back a little bit.

1095
01:20:29,181 --> 01:20:30,285
Run it from there.

1096
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,455
I just thought I saw something.

1097
01:20:46,881 --> 01:20:49,097
I want you two to put your
heads together on this.

1098
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,125
Michael will be going down there

1099
01:20:51,159 --> 01:20:52,758
as an agricultural specialist

1100
01:20:52,759 --> 01:20:54,624
with the Mayan Coffee Company

1101
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:55,376
non official

1102
01:20:56,528 --> 01:20:57,899
He'll be our eyes and ears.

1103
01:20:58,891 --> 01:20:59,548
Congratulations.

1104
01:20:59,586 --> 01:20:59,996
Thank you sir.

1105
01:21:01,175 --> 01:21:01,760
Good luck.

1106
01:21:01,917 --> 01:21:02,606
Thank you.

1107
01:21:03,378 --> 01:21:04,789
I wouldn't wear my
class ring down there.

1108
01:21:05,622 --> 01:21:06,753
Yes sir. Of course.

1109
01:21:06,754 --> 01:21:08,568
I want all intelligence on this

1110
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:10,686
sent directly to me and no one else.

1111
01:21:14,412 --> 01:21:15,921
I believe that's what
you're looking for.

1112
01:21:18,335 --> 01:21:19,480
That'll do it.

1113
01:22:11,007 --> 01:22:12,055
Mr. Wilson.

1114
01:22:12,783 --> 01:22:14,858
This came for you through
the Carlson cover address.

1115
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:17,660
There was no card.

1116
01:23:07,844 --> 01:23:10,148
There's been a potential compromise down south.

1117
01:23:10,971 --> 01:23:12,000
Ulysses

1118
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:15,039
We can't wait another 24 hours.

1119
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,349
If you can guarantee that all assets are in place

1120
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,373
and prepare to move on my order

1121
01:23:18,374 --> 01:23:19,333
I'm prepared to move as well.

1122
01:23:25,055 --> 01:23:25,823
Go back to bed.

1123
01:23:27,408 --> 01:23:28,701
What were you talking about?

1124
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:30,286
It's grown up talk.

1125
01:23:31,836 --> 01:23:33,851
I had a nightmare.

1126
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:35,201
Everything's fine.

1127
01:23:38,503 --> 01:23:40,493
Can you stay with me another minute?

1128
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:45,716
Try to get some sleep.

1129
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:49,903
Yes

1130
01:23:51,437 --> 01:23:53,482
We haven't got time to be sure of this.

1131
01:23:53,483 --> 01:23:54,538
This whole thing hinges on support.

1132
01:23:54,539 --> 01:23:57,764
If we don't have the support I
can't guarantee the outcome.

1133
01:23:57,765 --> 01:23:58,724
I guarantee the support.

1134
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:03,140
That's not a guarantee.
That's not an answer.

1135
01:24:04,464 --> 01:24:07,134
<i>unintelligible conversation</i>

1136
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:18,101
Margaret tells us that
you work for the CIA.

1137
01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:22,822
My wife has a vivid imagination.

1138
01:24:23,556 --> 01:24:25,089
I'm a trade advisor.

1139
01:24:25,139 --> 01:24:25,871
Civil servant.

1140
01:24:35,521 --> 01:24:36,754
Good night.
Good night.

1141
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:45,290
How dare you speak to me that way.

1142
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,249
Don't ever tell anybody

1143
01:24:47,465 --> 01:24:48,604
what I do. How dare you.

1144
01:24:48,605 --> 01:24:49,563
You are never to tell anyone

1145
01:24:50,665 --> 01:24:51,768
what is that I do.

1146
01:24:52,152 --> 01:24:53,579
Never. Do you understand?

1147
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,108
Never. What you do?

1148
01:24:54,109 --> 01:24:55,498
I don't know what you do.

1149
01:24:55,499 --> 01:24:56,458
You leave at 5, you get home at 10

1150
01:24:56,459 --> 01:24:57,417
7 days a week.

1151
01:24:57,418 --> 01:24:59,050
You don't say a dam word to me.

1152
01:24:59,123 --> 01:25:00,073
I live with a ghost.

1153
01:25:00,074 --> 01:25:01,539
I don't know what you do.

1154
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:02,498
<i>phone ringing</i>

1155
01:25:09,357 --> 01:25:10,278
Call back.

1156
01:25:17,876 --> 01:25:18,619
You're ready?

1157
01:25:18,757 --> 01:25:19,602
Launch the operation.

1158
01:25:21,342 --> 01:25:22,315
Say something.

1159
01:25:23,042 --> 01:25:23,618
Say something.

1160
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:25,484
I have to go now.

1161
01:25:25,485 --> 01:25:26,443
Say. Say something.

1162
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:27,403
Talk to me.

1163
01:25:27,404 --> 01:25:27,708
Say something.

1164
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:28,668
Look at me. Say something.

1165
01:25:56,562 --> 01:25:57,585
Remember what I said.

1166
01:25:57,921 --> 01:25:59,385
Don't touch anything.

1167
01:26:03,197 --> 01:26:04,887
Merry Christmas Margaret.

1168
01:26:04,902 --> 01:26:05,582
Edward.

1169
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:06,294
Merry Christmas.

1170
01:26:06,289 --> 01:26:07,766
Is this young Edward?

1171
01:26:07,767 --> 01:26:08,726
Would you like to come inside

1172
01:26:08,727 --> 01:26:11,001
and meet a very special
guest this evening?

1173
01:26:14,276 --> 01:26:16,156
Oh. Santa Claus

1174
01:26:16,914 --> 01:26:18,267
Would you like to meet Santa?

1175
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,030
Toddy is wonderful with children.

1176
01:26:22,031 --> 01:26:23,181
Yes. She is.

1177
01:26:27,004 --> 01:26:28,320
Would you like a drink Edward.

1178
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:29,790
Thank you.

1179
01:26:30,913 --> 01:26:33,047
I believe congratulations are in order.

1180
01:26:34,365 --> 01:26:36,248
The doctor has no more patients.

1181
01:26:36,282 --> 01:26:37,128
The cost of malpractice.

1182
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:41,750
Gentlemen.

1183
01:26:41,827 --> 01:26:42,774
Edward.

1184
01:26:46,191 --> 01:26:46,933
Hello.

1185
01:26:47,649 --> 01:26:48,297
Bill.

1186
01:26:49,013 --> 01:26:49,734
Gentlemen.

1187
01:26:50,737 --> 01:26:52,485
You can all be very proud

1188
01:26:52,486 --> 01:26:54,035
of what you've started.

1189
01:26:57,451 --> 01:26:58,406
Merry Christmas.

1190
01:26:58,407 --> 01:26:59,365
Merry Christmas Bill.

1191
01:27:19,641 --> 01:27:20,584
Say something.

1192
01:27:24,731 --> 01:27:26,041
Surprises are the best part of Christmas

1193
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:26,853
Don't you think?

1194
01:27:27,226 --> 01:27:29,944
How about, games?

1195
01:27:31,744 --> 01:27:34,163
How about, ball games?

1196
01:27:35,568 --> 01:27:36,259
Oh!

1197
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:38,909
Can I get you a towel?

1198
01:27:38,943 --> 01:27:39,436
I'm, I'm so sorry.

1199
01:27:39,947 --> 01:27:40,761
Are you all right?

1200
01:27:41,543 --> 01:27:43,131
All right, you poor thing.

1201
01:27:44,454 --> 01:27:45,862
I think we should go home.

1202
01:27:45,749 --> 01:27:46,409
Lower your voice.

1203
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:47,778
You can use our bathroom if you like.

1204
01:27:47,779 --> 01:27:48,738
I might have some dry clothes.

1205
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:49,410
Thank you.

1206
01:27:49,411 --> 01:27:50,093
Come with me Edward.

1207
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:51,365
It's all right. Come with me.

1208
01:27:52,287 --> 01:27:53,800
Can I help you up Mrs. Wilson?

1209
01:27:55,926 --> 01:27:56,610
No.

1210
01:28:52,758 --> 01:28:54,229
Did you know that Philipp is going to be

1211
01:28:54,256 --> 01:28:56,953
on the Mayan Coffee
Company's board of directors?

1212
01:28:59,721 --> 01:29:02,292
Remember what I said
to you about friends?

1213
01:29:14,829 --> 01:29:16,070
You look good Edward.

1214
01:29:17,149 --> 01:29:18,305
How long has it been?

1215
01:29:18,465 --> 01:29:19,430
Seven, eight years?

1216
01:29:20,725 --> 01:29:21,899
A lot of water under the bridge.

1217
01:29:24,832 --> 01:29:26,933
Carolina and I, we just bought our first house.

1218
01:29:28,878 --> 01:29:29,801
And everything is already broken

1219
01:29:29,725 --> 01:29:31,537
and I spend my weekends fixing things.

1220
01:29:31,935 --> 01:29:33,227
By the time I get everything fixed

1221
01:29:33,311 --> 01:29:35,267
it'll be time to sell the fucking house.

1222
01:29:37,675 --> 01:29:39,685
Maybe you can give me
a heads up on somebody.

1223
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:47,822
You're asking be to give you FBI files

1224
01:29:47,823 --> 01:29:48,782
on an American citizen?

1225
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:49,741
You know I can't do that.

1226
01:29:49,742 --> 01:29:51,567
It’s against the law to spy on citizens.

1227
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:54,358
Keep it.

1228
01:29:55,314 --> 01:29:56,818
Maybe someday you'll change your mind.

1229
01:30:21,062 --> 01:30:22,107
<i>door knocking</i>

1230
01:30:23,798 --> 01:30:24,971
May I come in?

1231
01:30:38,677 --> 01:30:40,733
You know,  I've never been in your office.

1232
01:30:41,958 --> 01:30:43,040
How was the fishing?

1233
01:30:44,499 --> 01:30:45,841
It was a bad year.

1234
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:46,800
The water is too high.

1235
01:30:48,754 --> 01:30:53,420
I understand you wanted to personally give
me the operation Zapata list yourself.

1236
01:30:57,479 --> 01:30:59,207
There isn't one, is there?

1237
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:05,559
You know it was a silent operation.

1238
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,310
It wasn't silent enough.

1239
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:13,230
I've been asked, by the President,

1240
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:15,484
to suggest who we no
longer need with us.

1241
01:31:19,304 --> 01:31:21,464
Who would you recommend, Edward.

1242
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:23,841
I serve at the pleasure
of the director, sir.

1243
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:26,488
I'm just a gate keeper.

1244
01:31:28,508 --> 01:31:30,126
Why is it that people like us

1245
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,283
chose to serve

1246
01:31:32,349 --> 01:31:33,560
for nickels a day.

1247
01:31:33,870 --> 01:31:35,335
In a profession that makes us

1248
01:31:35,598 --> 01:31:37,781
constantly look over our shoulder

1249
01:31:37,782 --> 01:31:39,583
to see who is watching us.

1250
01:31:39,617 --> 01:31:41,242
When will you make your decision?

1251
01:31:44,125 --> 01:31:45,206
Decision?

1252
01:31:49,148 --> 01:31:52,799
I serve at the discretion of the
President of the United States.

1253
01:31:54,202 --> 01:31:56,547
I will do what I think
is best for the country.

1254
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:06,639
It's important that we
find out who's responsible.

1255
01:32:10,077 --> 01:32:10,917
Good night.

1256
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:12,066
Good night.

1257
01:32:24,467 --> 01:32:28,550
At 22:42 call received on Berlin
base chief's operational line

1258
01:32:28,551 --> 01:32:31,245
man says he is senior officer KGB.

1259
01:32:31,246 --> 01:32:32,204
Would not give name.

1260
01:32:33,206 --> 01:32:34,554
Open up. Thanks.

1261
01:32:40,038 --> 01:32:42,964
KGB officer asked when Mr.
Edward Wilson is coming.

1262
01:32:42,998 --> 01:32:45,067
He wants to know Mr.
Edward Wilson's response.

1263
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:47,710
Tell him Mr. Edward Wilson is here

1264
01:32:48,364 --> 01:32:51,292
and would like to know what he
intends to provide us with in return.

1265
01:32:57,683 --> 01:32:59,842
He says, in return for safe journey

1266
01:33:00,056 --> 01:33:01,604
he will provide Mr. Wilson

1267
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:05,429
will clear understanding of
last three losses in Moscow.

1268
01:33:06,185 --> 01:33:09,567
and identities of soviet agents in your country,

1269
01:33:10,562 --> 01:33:12,843
penetrations of Moscow's station.

1270
01:33:13,984 --> 01:33:17,677
Will also speak personally
with Mr. Edward Wilson about

1271
01:33:18,819 --> 01:33:19,945
Ulysses.

1272
01:33:20,933 --> 01:33:23,116
Things that only he knows of Ulysses.

1273
01:33:23,205 --> 01:33:24,293
How he thinks.

1274
01:33:24,327 --> 01:33:25,034
What he plans to do.

1275
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:30,115
And what he wants Mr.
Edward to think he is doing.

1276
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:34,083
To establish bonafides, he will carry with him

1277
01:33:34,084 --> 01:33:39,405
KGB surveillance photographs
of all CIA officers in Moscow.

1278
01:33:41,046 --> 01:33:43,090
I will be more than happy

1279
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:44,362
to take

1280
01:33:45,103 --> 01:33:46,198
polygraph.

1281
01:33:54,370 --> 01:33:55,455
Ulysses.

1282
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:01,507
Ask him what his weakness is.

1283
01:34:15,971 --> 01:34:17,375
The cold.

1284
01:34:19,122 --> 01:34:20,622
Let's get him over here.

1285
01:34:21,585 --> 01:34:22,251
My name

1286
01:34:22,622 --> 01:34:25,118
is Valentin Gregorovich Mironov.

1287
01:34:25,119 --> 01:34:26,078
My children's names

1288
01:34:27,363 --> 01:34:29,042
are Anatoly and Sergei.

1289
01:34:29,043 --> 01:34:30,387
My father played the cello

1290
01:34:30,489 --> 01:34:31,479
I play the violin.

1291
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:32,439
But, you know this.

1292
01:34:33,443 --> 01:34:35,301
I risk my life to come all
the way to tell you this.

1293
01:34:36,339 --> 01:34:37,655
To confirm what you already know.

1294
01:34:37,861 --> 01:34:38,820
You failed the polygraph Mr.Mironov.

1295
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:41,107
You know every Russian fails polygraph.

1296
01:34:42,627 --> 01:34:45,253
Your polygraph doesn't
understand the Russian soul.

1297
01:34:49,513 --> 01:34:51,007
What more do you want?

1298
01:34:51,753 --> 01:34:52,904
I've given you my bonafides.

1299
01:34:53,365 --> 01:34:54,442
The names of agents.

1300
01:34:55,031 --> 01:34:56,330
Who has been compromised.

1301
01:34:56,592 --> 01:34:58,004
Who you need to know about.

1302
01:34:58,897 --> 01:35:01,273
I wanted to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson.

1303
01:35:02,188 --> 01:35:04,199
We were told Mironov was with these men

1304
01:35:04,214 --> 01:35:05,877
the day the photo were taken.

1305
01:35:05,955 --> 01:35:08,231
We're not even sure that any
of the circled men are him.

1306
01:35:08,232 --> 01:35:09,191
I told you these 3 time already.

1307
01:35:09,192 --> 01:35:10,152
?????

1308
01:35:11,574 --> 01:35:13,904
I want to speak to Mr. Edward Wilson.

1309
01:35:18,381 --> 01:35:19,405
I would like some tea.

1310
01:35:23,696 --> 01:35:24,520
The isn't any.

1311
01:35:24,714 --> 01:35:26,395
I get thirsty when I say too much.

1312
01:35:27,074 --> 01:35:30,076
You are going to keep up this
inane questioning for much longer?

1313
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:33,595
There is nothing you've told
us we don’t know, Mr. Mironov.

1314
01:35:35,547 --> 01:35:37,461
I think you better try a little harder.

1315
01:35:37,925 --> 01:35:39,711
I didn't come here to deal with children,

1316
01:35:39,712 --> 01:35:40,671
Mr. Lutz.

1317
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:43,194
Or is it, Mr. Brocco.

1318
01:35:45,896 --> 01:35:47,147
We do our homework too.

1319
01:35:57,346 --> 01:35:59,788
Hello Mr. Mironov. I'm Mr. Wilson.

1320
01:36:04,865 --> 01:36:05,830
Hello.

1321
01:36:05,952 --> 01:36:06,889
Mother.

1322
01:36:09,469 --> 01:36:11,400
Ulysses is obsessed with you.

1323
01:36:11,774 --> 01:36:12,626
Night and day.

1324
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:13,600
You are always on his mind.

1325
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:16,416
He trusts nobody.

1326
01:36:17,115 --> 01:36:18,594
The only one whom he lets close,

1327
01:36:19,082 --> 01:36:19,756
is his aid.

1328
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:20,875
Sasha.

1329
01:36:21,275 --> 01:36:22,393
He is methodical.

1330
01:36:22,426 --> 01:36:24,651
He plans things years in advance.

1331
01:36:25,433 --> 01:36:26,200
For instance

1332
01:36:26,201 --> 01:36:30,044
you should he has developed a friendship with a certain neighbor of yours

1333
01:36:30,803 --> 01:36:31,693
Fidel Castro.

1334
01:36:32,236 --> 01:36:34,420
A young man.  He has high hopes for him.

1335
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:36,470
I understand you had a most

1336
01:36:36,471 --> 01:36:38,419
interesting fish swim your way.

1337
01:36:39,313 --> 01:36:42,383
Mr. Allen thought it may be
possible for me to speak with him.

1338
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,255
With your chaperon of course.

1339
01:36:44,255 --> 01:36:47,323
I brought him a little gift I'm sure he'll appreciate.

1340
01:36:47,337 --> 01:36:48,608
Send Mironov immediately.

1341
01:36:49,755 --> 01:36:52,178
It'll be nice to be closely
working with you again.

1342
01:36:52,179 --> 01:36:54,143
I expect you to show me Washington.

1343
01:36:54,144 --> 01:36:55,997
We can paint the town red together.

1344
01:36:58,441 --> 01:36:59,538
Valentine Mironov.

1345
01:36:59,931 --> 01:37:00,463
Arch Cummings.

1346
01:37:00,918 --> 01:37:03,049
It is a great pleasure to meet you.

1347
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,009
My pleasure.

1348
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:04,810
Now please sit down.

1349
01:37:04,844 --> 01:37:07,299
Nice to have someone like
you on our side of the street.

1350
01:37:09,431 --> 01:37:11,035
I thought you may enjoy this.

1351
01:37:11,036 --> 01:37:12,804
It's something you might appreciate.

1352
01:37:12,805 --> 01:37:14,028
I hope you haven't read it.

1353
01:37:15,907 --> 01:37:16,572
Very clever.

1354
01:37:18,721 --> 01:37:19,649
Thank you.

1355
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:25,025
All Russian is our orchard.

1356
01:37:25,587 --> 01:37:27,719
The land is great and beautiful.

1357
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:29,973
There are many wonderful places in it.

1358
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:32,183
Think Anya.

1359
01:37:32,649 --> 01:37:33,578
Your grandfather.

1360
01:37:33,579 --> 01:37:35,165
Your great grandfather.

1361
01:37:35,212 --> 01:37:36,721
This is very bad translation.

1362
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:39,047
It is much funnier in Russian.

1363
01:38:06,789 --> 01:38:07,846
I'm due at a meeting.

1364
01:38:31,112 --> 01:38:32,076
Are you Laura?

1365
01:38:33,449 --> 01:38:34,256
What?

1366
01:38:34,392 --> 01:38:37,106
Are you Laura? I'm suppose
to offer you a ride.

1367
01:39:00,084 --> 01:39:01,429
Hello Edward.

1368
01:39:03,132 --> 01:39:04,042
Hello Laura.

1369
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:07,457
Why all the mystery?

1370
01:39:10,878 --> 01:39:12,146
Do you have children?

1371
01:39:12,734 --> 01:39:13,768
I have a boy.

1372
01:39:15,426 --> 01:39:16,404
Edward Jr.

1373
01:39:21,758 --> 01:39:23,014
Do you have anybody?

1374
01:39:26,925 --> 01:39:27,523
A cat.

1375
01:39:32,855 --> 01:39:36,542
I often imagine what my life
would have been like with you.

1376
01:39:38,008 --> 01:39:39,213
And what do you imagine?

1377
01:39:40,922 --> 01:39:42,491
I thought you might teach.

1378
01:39:43,808 --> 01:39:45,072
Probably poetry.

1379
01:39:46,905 --> 01:39:50,231
I saw us living in a small college town.

1380
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:06,493
You once said to me you were afraid

1381
01:40:06,568 --> 01:40:09,034
your life was already
planed out for you.

1382
01:40:13,072 --> 01:40:15,057
Are you doing what you want to do?

1383
01:40:17,450 --> 01:40:19,287
Life has been full of surprises.

1384
01:40:44,817 --> 01:40:46,814
You owe me a day at the beach.

1385
01:41:28,801 --> 01:41:30,328
How long do you think you'll be.

1386
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:32,709
As long as it takes.

1387
01:41:37,595 --> 01:41:39,156
I think maybe I'll go ahead.

1388
01:41:39,431 --> 01:41:40,437
All right.

1389
01:41:55,051 --> 01:41:55,967
Mother?

1390
01:41:58,727 --> 01:42:00,551
There's an envelope for you on the desk.

1391
01:42:02,725 --> 01:42:03,583
Hey, you look lovely.

1392
01:42:04,768 --> 01:42:05,332
Thank you.

1393
01:42:51,639 --> 01:42:54,278
It's not enough that you
ignore me our whole life

1394
01:42:54,279 --> 01:42:55,237
you have to humiliate me?

1395
01:42:55,973 --> 01:42:56,885
You disgust me.

1396
01:42:57,748 --> 01:42:58,541
Your disgusting.

1397
01:43:23,672 --> 01:43:25,242
Let’s start from the last ?????

1398
01:43:56,801 --> 01:43:58,359
Mother forgot some of her things.

1399
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:11,960
I'll see you at home.

1400
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:10,387
Are you Laura?

1401
01:45:12,011 --> 01:45:12,564
Yes.

1402
01:45:12,863 --> 01:45:14,439
I was asked to give you this.

1403
01:45:27,985 --> 01:45:31,000
In an unprecedented effort
to improve US-Soviet ties

1404
01:45:31,001 --> 01:45:34,424
premier Khrushchev began his 10
day tour of the United States today.

1405
01:45:34,458 --> 01:45:38,300
The visit will start with a tour by President
Eisenhower of our nation's capital...

1406
01:45:40,643 --> 01:45:42,223
All right. Now set it down.

1407
01:45:56,904 --> 01:45:57,765
It's perfect.

1408
01:46:00,277 --> 01:46:03,215
Our glee club has been chosen to
compete in the national competition.

1409
01:46:05,058 --> 01:46:06,640
Won't you come with me?

1410
01:46:07,891 --> 01:46:08,908
Would you like me to?

1411
01:46:10,146 --> 01:46:10,967
Very much.

1412
01:46:44,616 --> 01:46:45,901
I'll get your things.

1413
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:50,265
It's good to have you home.

1414
01:47:16,045 --> 01:47:16,990
How was your trip?

1415
01:47:17,925 --> 01:47:19,345
As smooth as silk.

1416
01:47:19,805 --> 01:47:24,733
Why FBI escort made the
trip her very pleasant.

1417
01:47:37,315 --> 01:47:38,424
Which one is your son?

1418
01:47:40,409 --> 01:47:41,994
Top row. Third from the right.

1419
01:47:44,187 --> 01:47:46,709
He's a handsome young
man. My congratulations.

1420
01:47:48,724 --> 01:47:51,249
We're particularly concerned about Cuba.

1421
01:47:53,173 --> 01:47:54,022
Your friend.

1422
01:47:55,647 --> 01:47:57,187
He's too close to home.

1423
01:47:57,188 --> 01:47:59,847
You don't appreciate him
breathing down your neck.

1424
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:03,882
If we continue down this road.

1425
01:48:04,601 --> 01:48:06,050
There will be a third World War.

1426
01:48:07,061 --> 01:48:09,171
I don't think either
of us wants a real war.

1427
01:48:09,577 --> 01:48:11,314
What would you do for a living then?

1428
01:48:14,845 --> 01:48:17,157
If he keeps calling attention to himself

1429
01:48:17,158 --> 01:48:18,117
at some point

1430
01:48:18,935 --> 01:48:21,173
we might be forced to
send him a surprise.

1431
01:48:22,016 --> 01:48:24,698
and I don't want that to come
as a surprise to your people.

1432
01:48:24,891 --> 01:48:26,865
He is very important to us.

1433
01:48:27,731 --> 01:48:30,016
We would not like to be surprised.

1434
01:48:35,983 --> 01:48:37,062
Be well.

1435
01:48:40,039 --> 01:48:40,873
Be well.

1436
01:48:57,285 --> 01:48:58,384
I am today

1437
01:48:58,694 --> 01:48:59,781
announcing my candidacy

1438
01:49:00,549 --> 01:49:02,233
for the presidency of the United States.

1439
01:49:03,092 --> 01:49:05,315
The presidency is the most powerful office

1440
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:05,794
in the free World.

1441
01:49:06,595 --> 01:49:09,368
Through its leadership
can come a more vital life

1442
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:11,033
for all of our people.

1443
01:49:11,513 --> 01:49:14,124
In it are centered the
hopes the globe around us

1444
01:49:14,677 --> 01:49:17,194
for freedom and a more secure life.

1445
01:49:17,798 --> 01:49:20,576
Senator Kennedy, if you don't
win the presidential nomination,

1446
01:49:20,577 --> 01:49:21,537
will you accept the vice presidency.

1447
01:49:22,535 --> 01:49:25,744
I shall not, under any condition,
be a candidate for vice president.

1448
01:49:25,745 --> 01:49:30,982
If I fail in this endeavor I shall return
and serve in the United States Senate.

1449
01:49:31,864 --> 01:49:33,788
We have a secure

My name is Valentin Gregorovich Mironov.

1458
01:49:59,876 --> 01:50:02,539
This other man who says he is Valentin Mironov

1459
01:50:02,555 --> 01:50:03,919
is not who he pretends to be.

1460
01:50:04,341 --> 01:50:06,143
Right? His real name is Yuri Modin.

01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:08,740
He was Ulysses right hand

1462
01:50:08,661 --> 01:50:09,824
he is Ulysses'....

1463
01:50:09,941 --> 01:50:12,580
Will you just tell me your real name.

1464
01:50:12,647 --> 01:50:14,942
It is just Ulysses trying to discredit me.

1465
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:22,432

01:50:42,003 --> 01:50:44,156
All I want is my freedom.

1473
01:50:49,806 --> 01:50:50,696
Pick him up.

1474
01:50:52,531 --> 01:50:53,591
Are you alright?

1475
01:50:54,598 --> 01:50:55,273
I'm sorry.

1476
01:50:55,628 --> 01:50:56,675
You see what you made me do?

1477
01:50:57,604 --> 01:50:58,328
Now just

1478
01:50:58,893 --> 01:50:59,722

1479
01:51:03,152 --> 01:51:04,708
Because, we're going to be here

1480
01:51:05,597 --> 01:51:06,619
as long as it takes.

1481
01:51:06,619 --> 01:51:07,578
I already told you.

1482
01:51:07,579 --> 01:51:08,538
I want to know

1483
01:51:08,539 --> 01:51:09,305

your real name.

1487
01:51:11,819 --> 01:51:13,043
Mr.  Please. I'm not lying.

1488
01:51:13,076 --> 01:51:14,308
I'd like to believe you

1489
01:51:14,309 --> 01:51:15,268
but I don’t believe
you. You understand?

1490
01:51:15,269 --> 01:51:17,156
Now tell me your name.

1491
01:51:17,157 --> 01:51:18,116
My name is Mironov.

01:51:19,096 --> 01:51:21,048
It's Valentin Gregorovish Mironov.

1493
01:51:21,049 --> 01:51:21,735
Is that your name?

1494
01:51:22,008 --> 01:51:22,270
Yeah.

1495
01:51:22,299 --> 01:51:23,299
Is that your real name.

1496
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,259
Yes. This is my name.

1497
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:25,219
Tell me your real name.

1498
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:26,178
I told you my name.

1499
01:51:26,179 --> 01:51:27,138
Tell me your name.

1500
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:28,098
I told you a 100 times...

1501
01:51:28,099 --> 01:51:29,057
Because we're not going anywhere

1502
01:51:29,058 --> 01:51:30,017
I just want you to know that

1503
01:51:30,018 --> 01:51:30,977
we are not going anywhere

1504
01:51:30,978 --> 01:51:33,629
Today, tomorrow, next week, next month

1505
01:51:33,630 --> 01:51:35,652
He is your mold, I'm not your mold.

1506
01:51:35,653 --> 01:51:36,393
You understand?

1507
01:51:36,394 --> 01:51:37,642
I'll be right in front of you.

1508
01:51:37,643 --> 01:51:38,314
The same position.

1509
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:40,017
What is your name?

1510
01:51:42,349 --> 01:51:43,026
Tell me your name.

1511
01:51:45,311 --> 01:51:45,999
Tell it.

1512
01:51:46,324 --> 01:51:47,054
Tell it.

1513
01:51:47,022 --> 01:51:47,725
Tell it to me.

1514
01:51:47,856 --> 01:51:48,589
Tell it to me again.

1515
01:51:49,152 --> 01:51:49,836
Tell it to me again.

1516
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:52,906
Tell me your fucking name.

1517
01:52:01,190 --> 01:52:02,919
Shut up! Shut up!

1518
01:52:03,740 --> 01:52:04,418
Tell me your name.

1519
01:52:05,767 --> 01:52:06,580
Tell me your name.

1520
01:52:06,872 --> 01:52:07,567
Tell

1521
01:52:07,706 --> 01:52:08,431
me

1522
01:52:08,596 --> 01:52:09,295
your

1523
01:52:09,202 --> 01:52:09,967
fucking

1524
01:52:09,962 --> 01:52:10,639
name.

1525
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:12,078
Tell me your name.

1526
01:52:12,593 --> 01:52:13,324
Tell me your name.

1527
01:52:16,126 --> 01:52:17,512
Come on. Get it off. Get it off.

1528
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,351
Put him down.

1529
01:52:29,738 --> 01:52:30,552
Your name.

1530
01:52:36,837 --> 01:52:37,817
Tell me your name.

1531
01:52:51,191 --> 01:52:53,853
What is your name?

1532
01:52:54,045 --> 01:52:57,355
Sir, this is Lysergic acid diethylamide.

1533
01:52:58,039 --> 01:52:59,614
It's called LSD.

1534
01:53:01,372 --> 01:53:04,047
We've had some very favorable
results as a truth serum.

1535
01:53:11,682 --> 01:53:13,669
<i>signing in Russian</i>

1536
01:53:26,401 --> 01:53:28,750
<i>speaking Russian</i>

1537
01:54:22,442 --> 01:54:24,069
Soviet power it a myth.

1538
01:54:27,831 --> 01:54:28,938
A freak show.

1539
01:54:29,661 --> 01:54:31,112
There are no spare parts

1540
01:54:31,565 --> 01:54:33,122
nothing is working, nothing

1541
01:54:33,286 --> 01:54:36,496
it's nothing but painted rust.

1542
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,293
But you.

1543
01:54:44,024 --> 01:54:46,178
You need to keep the Russian myth alive

1544
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:49,315
to maintain your military
industrial complex.

1545
01:54:49,890 --> 01:54:52,249
Your system depends on Russia being perceived

1546
01:54:52,361 --> 01:54:53,525
as a mortal threat.

1547
01:54:55,846 --> 01:54:57,123
It's not a threat.

1548
01:54:59,001 --> 01:55:00,505
It was never a threat

1549
01:55:00,506 --> 01:55:03,097
it will never be a threat.

1550
01:55:05,434 --> 01:55:06,470
It is

1551
01:55:07,762 --> 01:55:08,545
a rotted

1552
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:10,486
bloated

1553
01:55:11,933 --> 01:55:12,844
cow.

1554
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:25,522
I am

1555
01:55:26,533 --> 01:55:28,289
Valentin Gregorovish Mironov.

1556
01:55:30,062 --> 01:55:31,465
And I am

1557
01:55:32,314 --> 01:55:33,067
free.

1558
01:55:38,401 --> 01:55:39,423
Shit.

1559
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:40,449
Shit.

1560
01:55:54,489 --> 01:55:55,841
If you would like

1561
01:55:57,207 --> 01:55:59,614
I'd be willing to take
the truth serum at once.

1562
01:56:02,152 --> 01:56:03,326
I've nothing to hide.

1563
01:56:05,806 --> 01:56:07,448
I am who I say I am.

1564
01:56:15,086 --> 01:56:16,167
I know.

1565
01:56:32,467 --> 01:56:34,032
We sent those who are leaving us

1566
01:56:34,033 --> 01:56:36,639
to go into the World, with the knowledge

1567
01:56:37,242 --> 01:56:38,057
wherever they go

1568
01:56:38,797 --> 01:56:39,516
whatever they do

1569
01:56:40,168 --> 01:56:41,337
They will never be alone.

1570
01:56:42,323 --> 01:56:43,921
They will always be one of us.

1571
01:56:44,738 --> 01:56:45,841
And we sing

1572
01:56:45,949 --> 01:56:47,339
Bonesmen, all here.

1573
01:56:47,373 --> 01:56:48,007
All here.

1574
01:56:49,626 --> 01:56:51,405
<i>singing</i>

1575
01:56:58,925 --> 01:57:00,453
I didn't know you smoked.

1576
01:57:01,954 --> 01:57:04,121
There are a few things
you don't know about me.

1577
01:57:12,162 --> 01:57:14,247
I've spoken to a recruiter here.

1578
01:57:15,559 --> 01:57:17,872
I would like, very much, to join CIA.

1579
01:57:19,382 --> 01:57:21,607
There a lot of things you can do, Edward.

1580
01:57:22,765 --> 01:57:24,616
I'd like you to think about this carefully.

1581
01:57:24,617 --> 01:57:25,577
I have thought about it very carefully.

1582
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:26,846
It's what I want to do

1583
01:57:26,908 --> 01:57:27,980
I want to join the agency.

1584
01:57:30,893 --> 01:57:32,308
I want to make you proud of me.

1585
01:57:32,342 --> 01:57:33,434
I am proud of you.

1586
01:57:33,845 --> 01:57:35,576
Well I've made up my mind father.

1587
01:57:38,481 --> 01:57:39,448
You can stop him.

1588
01:57:40,516 --> 01:57:42,338
He doesn't understand what he's getting into

1589
01:57:42,361 --> 01:57:43,330
you can stop him.

1590
01:57:43,331 --> 01:57:44,290
I can't tell him what to do.

1591
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:44,953
Yes you can.

1592
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:45,612
No.

1593
01:57:45,667 --> 01:57:46,260
Yes you can because

1594
01:57:46,856 --> 01:57:47,909
he is doing it for you.

1595
01:57:48,951 --> 01:57:50,382
Because he wants you to be proud of him

1596
01:57:50,394 --> 01:57:51,812
and he wants to feel closer to you.

1597
01:57:51,813 --> 01:57:52,639
You can have them rejected him.

1598
01:57:52,677 --> 01:57:54,122
Absolutely not. I won't do that to him.

1599
01:57:54,123 --> 01:57:55,082
Of course you won't.

1600
01:57:55,083 --> 01:57:56,234
You won't do anything for anyone but yourself.

1601
01:57:57,430 --> 01:57:58,581
That is unfair.

1602
01:57:58,582 --> 01:57:59,540
Unfair.

1603
01:57:59,541 --> 01:58:00,309
That is unfair.

1604
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:01,950
You abandon people when
they need you the most.

1605
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:03,038
I don't abandon people.

1606
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:03,711
You abandon people.

1607
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:04,950
I do not abandon people.

1608
01:58:04,951 --> 01:58:05,622
It's true.

1609
01:58:05,719 --> 01:58:06,391
I've stood by you.

1610
01:58:06,392 --> 01:58:07,202
Stood by me?

1611
01:58:07,203 --> 01:58:08,560
For 22 to years I've stood by you.

1612
01:58:08,561 --> 01:58:09,520
You don't what it is to stand by somebody.

1613
01:58:09,521 --> 01:58:11,463
I've stood by you and I've stood by him.

1614
01:58:11,464 --> 01:58:12,423
You ignored him.

1615
01:58:12,424 --> 01:58:13,786
I've done everything to
be a good father to him.

1616
01:58:13,787 --> 01:58:14,746
You have done no such thing.

1617
01:58:14,747 --> 01:58:16,504
I married you because of him.

1618
01:58:41,192 --> 01:58:42,747
I know you don't love me.

1619
01:58:43,821 --> 01:58:44,692
But you love him.

1620
01:58:45,726 --> 01:58:46,826
And no matter what

1621
01:58:46,827 --> 01:58:48,998
you should stand by him
and you should protect him.

1622
01:58:48,999 --> 01:58:50,818
I don’t need you to tell me
I have to protect my son.

1623
01:58:51,142 --> 01:58:52,563
Promise me that you will protect him.

1624
01:58:56,497 --> 01:58:57,806
I'll protect him.

1625
01:59:02,905 --> 01:59:05,234
Today, in Havana, Fidel Castro expelled

1626
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:06,933
high profile crime figures from Cuba.

1627
01:59:07,325 --> 01:59:09,465
He's taking control of their hotels and casinos.

1628
01:59:09,524 --> 01:59:11,817
Popular vacation destinations
for many Americans.

1629
01:59:12,433 --> 01:59:14,471
Castro has nationalized over a billion dollars

1630
01:59:14,472 --> 01:59:16,236
from US businesses in the past six months.

1631
01:59:16,237 --> 01:59:18,000
And there is not telling what the communist dictator

1632
01:59:18,001 --> 01:59:19,421
I want to see a man about a hat.

1633
01:59:20,269 --> 01:59:22,986
He had 3 casinos down there
until Castro sent them home.

1634
01:59:24,270 --> 01:59:26,036
These people know how to be discreet.

1635
01:59:27,256 --> 01:59:29,113
With the right encouragement, he could help.

1636
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:30,694
And he's very patriotic.

1637
01:59:31,658 --> 01:59:32,174
Jimmy.

1638
01:59:32,978 --> 01:59:33,767
Mr. Carlson.

1639
01:59:35,604 --> 01:59:36,940
Tina. The kids.

1640
01:59:37,162 --> 01:59:38,156
Alright. Come on kids.

1641
01:59:43,957 --> 01:59:44,629
Sit down.

1642
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:46,649
Some water, some coffee, whatever?

1643
01:59:48,152 --> 01:59:49,511
Is there someplace else we could go.

1644
01:59:52,743 --> 01:59:55,175
All right daddy. We're going down to
the beach. We'll be back in a while.

1645
01:59:55,176 --> 01:59:58,657
Make sure they don't go into the
water unless somebody is watching them.

1646
01:59:58,658 --> 02:00:00,266
No, I'm going to let them down.

1647
02:00:00,267 --> 02:00:03,046
Make sure they put their shoes
on. They'll burn their feet.

1648
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:04,455
Yea. We're getting their shoes.

1649
02:00:04,456 --> 02:00:05,977
All right come on. Let’s go.

1650
02:00:10,142 --> 02:00:11,769
So, what do you want
to talk to me about?

1651
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:14,603
The government is about to deport
you, for certain activities.

1652
02:00:15,467 --> 02:00:17,592
I've been in this country
since I'm two months old.

1653
02:00:18,099 --> 02:00:19,812
What’s that make me. Italian?

1654
02:00:20,322 --> 02:00:21,096
I'm American.

1655
02:00:22,294 --> 02:00:23,831
And they are trying to send me back?

1656
02:00:23,914 --> 02:00:26,068
They can have the deportation order reviewed.

1657
02:00:27,992 --> 02:00:29,589
Have you classified as highly sensitive

1658
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:30,832
for national security.

1659
02:00:30,865 --> 02:00:33,103
I can take the government off
your back it you can help us.

1660
02:00:34,178 --> 02:00:35,881
You are the guys that scare me.

1661
02:00:36,994 --> 02:00:38,766
You're the people that make big wars.

1662
02:00:39,177 --> 02:00:41,833
No. We make sure the wars
are small ones, Mr. Palmi.

1663
02:00:43,747 --> 02:00:44,827
Let me ask you something.

1664
02:00:45,909 --> 02:00:48,991
We Italians, we got our
families and we got the church.

1665
02:00:50,482 --> 02:00:52,110
The Irish, they have the homeland.

1666
02:00:53,044 --> 02:00:54,309
The Jews, their tradition.

1667
02:00:55,874 --> 02:00:58,019
Even the niggers. They've got their music.

1668
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:02,084
What about you people, Mr. Carlson?

1669
02:01:02,277 --> 02:01:03,044
What do you have?

1670
02:01:05,382 --> 02:01:06,663
The United States of America.

1671
02:01:07,398 --> 02:01:08,640
The rest of you are just visiting.

1672
02:01:15,983 --> 02:01:19,108
The president wants the noise
level on the operation turned down.

1673
02:01:22,405 --> 02:01:23,810
How many men are involved?

1674
02:01:25,686 --> 02:01:26,568
Fifteen hundred.

1675
02:01:28,841 --> 02:01:31,406
Tell them we are going instead to Bahia de Cochinos.

1676
02:01:31,407 --> 02:01:33,061
Noise level will be way down.

1677
02:01:42,493 --> 02:01:43,653
See you inside.

1678
02:02:03,394 --> 02:02:05,338
Could you hear what
we were talking about?

1679
02:02:05,339 --> 02:02:06,733
No. I didn't hear anything.

1680
02:02:09,481 --> 02:02:11,041
If something was heard.

1681
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:13,068
It has to stay in this room.

1682
02:02:13,909 --> 02:02:14,942
Oh, I know that, father.

1683
02:02:18,917 --> 02:02:19,772
All right.

1684
02:02:36,917 --> 02:02:37,983
Bonesmen.

1685
02:02:39,340 --> 02:02:45,678
All here.

1686
02:02:47,525 --> 02:02:48,517
Agency first.

1687
02:02:49,373 --> 02:02:49,997
God second.

1688
02:02:49,998 --> 02:02:50,957
Thank you Lord.

1689
02:02:50,958 --> 02:02:51,917
For bringing us here safely here

1690
02:02:51,918 --> 02:02:54,666
to be with our brothers
and loved ones again.

1691
02:02:55,544 --> 02:02:57,662
Our prayers are with our brothers

1692
02:02:57,695 --> 02:02:59,680
whom God has seen fit to take

1693
02:02:59,893 --> 02:03:01,205
into his gentle arms this year.

1694
02:03:01,997 --> 02:03:05,119
The honorable Senator
John Russell Senior.

1695
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:07,936
Mr. Stephen Lummis Evans.

1696
02:03:38,526 --> 02:03:40,284
Would you like to dance Clover?

1697
02:03:43,033 --> 02:03:44,881
I haven't been Clover for a long time.

1698
02:04:17,951 --> 02:04:19,956
I'm going to Phoenix
to live with my mother.

1699
02:04:29,761 --> 02:04:31,340
Based on the ringing of the church bells

1700
02:04:31,365 --> 02:04:33,108
we're going to assume the recording was made

1701
02:04:33,188 --> 02:04:34,995
at the same time the photograph was taken.

1702
02:04:34,995 --> 02:04:37,745
We've check the schedules for
flights leaving major airports

1703
02:04:37,779 --> 02:04:40,514
at or around 10 o'clock at
night for a two week period.

1704
02:04:40,988 --> 02:04:42,691
There were flights leaving nine cities.

1705
02:04:43,839 --> 02:04:47,368
Six were places that would also
potentially have a fan made in Belgium.

1706
02:04:47,984 --> 02:04:51,383
Five of those places were also either
tropical or in their summer seasons.

1707
02:04:51,965 --> 02:04:54,306
Three of those were places
where French is spoken.

1708
02:04:55,522 --> 02:04:57,251
We think the tape was made in either

1709
02:04:57,301 --> 02:05:00,699
Dakar,  Abidjan or Congo Leo.

1710
02:07:48,209 --> 02:07:49,272
It is all gone.

1711
02:07:55,127 --> 02:07:56,492
Hello mother.

1712
02:07:58,694 --> 02:07:59,493
Let me show you.

1713
02:08:05,979 --> 02:08:09,076
As you see, no cameras,
no tape recorders.

1714
02:08:11,948 --> 02:08:13,817
There is nothing else to know.

1715
02:08:18,061 --> 02:08:19,517
Can I play something for you?

1716
02:08:25,453 --> 02:08:27,037
Everything is a secret.

1717
02:08:29,836 --> 02:08:31,713
?????

1718
02:08:31,904 --> 02:08:34,534
What was such a big secret
that his own son couldn't know?

1719
02:08:37,448 --> 02:08:38,950
He was standing outside talking.

1720
02:08:40,726 --> 02:08:42,566
I heard something I wasn't supposed to,

1721
02:08:42,593 --> 02:08:44,326
and he knew I'd listened his conversation.

1722
02:08:46,613 --> 02:08:48,635
I heard him say something in Spanish.

1723
02:08:50,548 --> 02:08:51,507
Bahia de Cochinos.

1724
02:08:52,331 --> 02:08:54,207
Bahia de Cochinos.

1725
02:08:55,337 --> 02:08:56,494
I'm afraid of him.

1726
02:08:58,849 --> 02:09:00,861
Your are safe here with me.

1727
02:09:02,461 --> 02:09:05,223
People who really love each
other don't have secrets.

1728
02:09:07,222 --> 02:09:09,236
I have something for you.

1729
02:09:17,834 --> 02:09:19,161
I love you so much.

1730
02:09:21,061 --> 02:09:22,320
I love you so much.

1731
02:09:29,510 --> 02:09:33,118
She's been an active asset
of ours for some time.

1732
02:09:36,527 --> 02:09:37,445
Until now.

1733
02:09:39,523 --> 02:09:40,828
She loves your son.

1734
02:09:45,686 --> 02:09:46,942
Sometimes even

1735
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:48,119
spies fall in love.

1736
02:09:51,784 --> 02:09:53,519
We can protect him.

1737
02:09:54,152 --> 02:09:55,316
Make him safe.

1738
02:09:55,701 --> 02:09:57,406
Nobody would know. Not even him.

1739
02:10:01,548 --> 02:10:04,070
All it would require is for you

1740
02:10:06,291 --> 02:10:06,984
to help us.

1741
02:10:08,753 --> 02:10:10,004
When your help is needed.

1742
02:10:24,818 --> 02:10:26,667
I thought you would like to see this.

1743
02:10:30,887 --> 02:10:33,523
She is a very pretty girl.

1744
02:10:34,063 --> 02:10:36,375
It is easy to see why he fell for her.

1745
02:10:51,588 --> 02:10:54,604
I know it is an extremely
difficult situation for you.

1746
02:10:59,259 --> 02:11:02,058
But I am afraid I'm going to need your answer very soon.

1747
02:11:05,275 --> 02:11:06,987
You must decide

1748
02:11:08,108 --> 02:11:10,172
what is of more importance to you

1749
02:11:12,090 --> 02:11:13,434
your country or

1750
02:11:18,521 --> 02:11:19,310
or your son.

1751
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:50,195
She is not who you think she is.

1752
02:11:52,312 --> 02:11:54,125
She's not a friendly, Edward.

1753
02:11:55,231 --> 02:11:56,210
I don't believe you.

1754
02:11:57,552 --> 02:11:58,882
Why should I believe you?

1755
02:12:00,128 --> 02:12:02,094
You told me yourself not to trust anybody.

1756
02:12:03,711 --> 02:12:05,826
You're the master of creating the truth.

1757
02:12:08,039 --> 02:12:09,049
I love her.

1758
02:12:10,252 --> 02:12:11,503
I've asked her to marry me.

1759
02:12:12,451 --> 02:12:13,945
I will not let you
take that away from me.

1760
02:12:14,178 --> 02:12:15,593
I can't protect you anymore.

1761
02:12:15,594 --> 02:12:16,554
I can't keep you safe.

1762
02:12:16,555 --> 02:12:17,514
Safe?

1763
02:12:20,088 --> 02:12:20,775
Safe?

1764
02:12:19,832 --> 02:12:21,967
I never felt safe.

1765
02:12:21,968 --> 02:12:23,509
I was always frighten.

1766
02:12:23,543 --> 02:12:24,985
I always lived in fear that something

1767
02:12:25,019 --> 02:12:26,178
awful was going to happen to you.

1768
02:12:26,179 --> 02:12:28,169
Or if not, to mother or to me.

1769
02:12:28,274 --> 02:12:30,993
I was always afraid because
everything was a secret.

1770
02:13:47,614 --> 02:13:48,285
Edward.

1771
02:13:48,315 --> 02:13:49,231
Hello, may I come in.

1772
02:13:49,232 --> 02:13:50,191
Yes, of course.

1773
02:13:50,539 --> 02:13:51,875
Is everything all right?

1774
02:13:53,576 --> 02:13:55,198
I was on my way home from work

1775
02:13:55,199 --> 02:13:56,876
and I had this overwhelming desire

1776
02:13:56,877 --> 02:13:58,315
to hear you play the violin.

1777
02:13:58,280 --> 02:13:59,256
Play the violin?

1778
02:14:01,091 --> 02:14:02,518
Edward, I am so tired.

1779
02:14:02,519 --> 02:14:03,986
Can't this way until tomorrow?

1780
02:14:04,145 --> 02:14:05,905
I'd appreciate it if you played it now.

1781
02:14:07,668 --> 02:14:08,428
Now.

1782
02:17:15,102 --> 02:17:17,339
I just wanted to hear something
from you that was true.

1783
02:17:27,283 --> 02:17:28,584
He was careless.

1784
02:17:29,248 --> 02:17:31,803
FBI.  You're under arrest. Stand up.

1785
02:17:33,776 --> 02:17:35,927
Didn't learn how to hide in plain sight.

1786
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:36,887
Where are they taking me?

1787
02:17:37,731 --> 02:17:38,627
I can't go home.

1788
02:17:38,660 --> 02:17:40,443
You know they can trust me anymore.

1789
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:42,413
You know what they will do to me?

1790
02:17:43,115 --> 02:17:44,046
Sorry Edward.

1791
02:17:46,356 --> 02:17:48,210
I truly did like you.

1792
02:17:49,751 --> 02:17:51,150
In another world we actually

1793
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:53,344
would have been quite good friends.

1794
02:17:56,710 --> 02:17:58,127
Hey.  Are you still there mother?

1795
02:17:59,046 --> 02:18:00,651
Your worst fear has come true.

1796
02:18:04,883 --> 02:18:06,573
Alone and friendless.

1797
02:18:09,041 --> 02:18:10,299
Without a country of your own.

1798
02:19:20,172 --> 02:19:22,867
We have a whole new place to fight over.

1799
02:19:25,002 --> 02:19:26,052
The stars.

1800
02:19:31,191 --> 02:19:32,000
Your offer.

1801
02:19:35,847 --> 02:19:37,048
I have to decline.

1802
02:19:48,337 --> 02:19:51,311
You've succeeded in stopping
us from taking back Cuba.

1803
02:19:55,170 --> 02:19:56,497
The damage is done.

1804
02:19:59,953 --> 02:20:01,709
There is no need for you to hurt my son.

1805
02:20:08,276 --> 02:20:09,927
Let’s just leave it between you and me.

1806
02:20:14,676 --> 02:20:15,837
Very well.

1807
02:20:17,965 --> 02:20:18,849
I will wait.

1808
02:20:21,356 --> 02:20:22,875
But there will come a time

1809
02:20:25,448 --> 02:20:27,667
when I will ask you with a problem

1810
02:20:28,817 --> 02:20:30,520
that wouldn't cost you much

1811
02:20:30,657 --> 02:20:32,551
but would be of some value to me.

1812
02:20:36,208 --> 02:20:38,331
You never know what
the future will bring.

1813
02:20:41,144 --> 02:20:42,681
Friends can be enemies

1814
02:20:42,682 --> 02:20:44,378
and enemies friends.

1815
02:21:00,414 --> 02:21:01,679
This girl.

1816
02:21:04,185 --> 02:21:06,134
Neither of us can be sure about her.

1817
02:21:10,005 --> 02:21:12,652
But she's about to be
a part of your family.

1818
02:21:15,521 --> 02:21:17,119
I believe in family.

1819
02:21:22,396 --> 02:21:24,431
You want her to be a
part of your family.

1820
02:21:26,565 --> 02:21:27,505
Don't you?

1821
02:21:51,912 --> 02:21:53,152
It was good to see you.

1822
02:21:56,142 --> 02:21:57,498
We will talk again.

1823
02:21:58,548 --> 02:21:59,491
My dear friend.

1824
02:22:01,690 --> 02:22:03,638
<i>speaking Russian</i>

1825
02:22:08,075 --> 02:22:09,061
Sorry to bother.

1826
02:22:09,289 --> 02:22:11,523
I want to buy a little
souvenir to my daughter.

1827
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:12,430
They have no change.

1828
02:22:12,576 --> 02:22:13,928
<i>speaking Russian</i>

1829
02:22:13,962 --> 02:22:16,407
What does it cost?

1830
02:22:18,359 --> 02:22:19,584
Here. It's a gift.

1831
02:22:19,585 --> 02:22:21,611
Regards from the United
States government.

1832
02:22:23,266 --> 02:22:25,874
It's a cardinal rule to
be generous in a democracy.

1833
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:31,929
Thank you.

1834
02:23:23,599 --> 02:23:24,930
So where is she?

1835
02:23:25,635 --> 02:23:26,941
We are going to meet her at the church.

1836
02:23:27,435 --> 02:23:28,287
I can't wait to meet her.

1837
02:23:32,891 --> 02:23:33,777
Yes. That's good.

1838
02:23:49,176 --> 02:23:50,104
Come on in.

1839
02:23:59,207 --> 02:24:00,053
Hello Margaret.

1840
02:24:05,164 --> 02:24:06,182
Well let's celebrate.

1841
02:24:06,632 --> 02:24:07,591
I'll get some champagne

1842
02:24:14,782 --> 02:24:15,896
How was the flight?

1843
02:24:18,622 --> 02:24:19,663
It was long.

1844
02:24:29,624 --> 02:24:31,282
How do you like living in Phoenix.

1845
02:24:35,571 --> 02:24:37,267
It's the first time I've slept in years.

1846
02:24:41,882 --> 02:24:42,798
Here we go.

1847
02:25:07,774 --> 02:25:08,801
To your happiness.

1848
02:25:09,248 --> 02:25:10,247
To your happiness.

1849
02:26:53,720 --> 02:26:54,571
Your wife.

1850
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:56,522
What have you done.

1851
02:26:59,434 --> 02:27:00,831
Will you go inside mother?

1852
02:27:02,194 --> 02:27:03,757
You can go inside, mother.

1853
02:27:06,047 --> 02:27:07,465
Please, just go in the church.

1854
02:27:17,901 --> 02:27:19,370
She's pregnant.

1855
02:27:37,146 --> 02:27:39,017
You can't know the difference.

1856
02:27:41,383 --> 02:27:42,073
No.

1857
02:27:42,813 --> 02:27:43,833
I love you.

1858
02:27:45,637 --> 02:27:46,581
I love you so much.

1859
02:28:10,708 --> 02:28:11,586
Mr. Wilson?

1860
02:28:11,587 --> 02:28:12,332
Mr. Hayes.

1861
02:28:13,602 --> 02:28:14,830
You've been here before Mother?

1862
02:28:14,831 --> 02:28:15,790
No I haven't.

1863
02:28:16,854 --> 02:28:18,061
Who's idea was that?

1864
02:28:19,283 --> 02:28:20,437
It's classified.

1865
02:28:23,517 --> 02:28:26,127
Mr. Allen has notified
the President he'll resign.

1866
02:28:28,358 --> 02:28:30,161
Something about Swiss bank accounts.

1867
02:28:32,075 --> 02:28:33,546
Where did these come from?

1868
02:28:33,817 --> 02:28:34,556
They were in the car.

1869
02:28:34,896 --> 02:28:36,408
I thought you had them sent down, sir.

1870
02:28:37,497 --> 02:28:38,777
Seems the greedy bastard has

1871
02:28:38,778 --> 02:28:40,504
been hiding money away for years.

1872
02:28:41,426 --> 02:28:42,655
Whoever had the statementsm

1873
02:28:42,830 --> 02:28:44,875
sent it to him in a box of Swiss chocolates.

1874
02:28:47,754 --> 02:28:49,061
Wasn't you, was it.

1875
02:28:52,610 --> 02:28:54,456
The President asked me to become director

1876
02:28:54,514 --> 02:28:56,597
and do a complete
housecleaning at my discretion.

1877
02:28:57,226 --> 02:28:58,410
I need someone I can trust.

1878
02:28:58,788 --> 02:29:01,005
After all, we're still brothers.

1879
02:29:03,132 --> 02:29:05,076
This building doesn't get built without you.

1880
02:29:05,688 --> 02:29:07,155
Your're CIA's heart and soul.

1881
02:29:08,368 --> 02:29:09,256
Who knows.

1882
02:29:09,454 --> 02:29:11,500
You might have a secret about
me in that safe of yours.

1883
02:29:14,083 --> 02:29:15,313
This whole wing

1884
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:17,236
will be your part of the World.

1885
02:29:17,497 --> 02:29:18,496
Counter intelligence.

1886
02:29:19,728 --> 02:29:21,520
Take a look around. I've
got an oversight meeting.

1887
02:29:22,081 --> 02:29:23,000
Can you imagine?

1888
02:29:23,897 --> 02:29:25,195
They think they can look into our closet.

1889
02:29:26,006 --> 02:29:27,150
As if we'll let them.

1890
02:29:30,936 --> 02:29:32,945
I remember a senator once asked me,

1891
02:29:33,882 --> 02:29:35,430
when we talk about CIA

1892
02:29:35,463 --> 02:29:37,473
why we never use the
work THE in front of it.

1893
02:29:38,835 --> 02:29:39,641
And I asked him,

1894
02:29:39,675 --> 02:29:42,055
do you put the work THE in front of God?

1895
02:30:29,450 --> 02:30:30,988
They are right what they said about me.

1896
02:30:32,208 --> 02:30:33,497
I was weak.

1897
02:30:34,588 --> 02:30:35,408
A coward.

1898
02:30:38,854 --> 02:30:40,428
I compromised myself

1899
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:43,403
My honor, my family.

1900
02:30:43,751 --> 02:30:44,563
My country.

1901
02:30:47,725 --> 02:30:49,088
I am ashamed of myself.

1902
02:30:51,362 --> 02:30:52,226
To my wife.

1903
02:30:53,405 --> 02:30:54,853
I'm sorry I've done this to you.

1904
02:30:57,386 --> 02:30:58,013
To my son.

1905
02:30:59,275 --> 02:31:01,404
I hope you will grow to be a courageous man.

1906
02:31:02,605 --> 02:31:03,792
A good husband.

1907
02:31:04,942 --> 02:31:05,785
A good father.

1908
02:31:12,097 --> 02:31:13,686
I hope whatever you decide to do

1909
02:31:13,783 --> 02:31:14,927
you lead a good full life.

1910
02:31:21,405 --> 02:31:22,913
I hope whatever your dreams may be,

1911
02:31:23,745 --> 02:31:24,367
come true.

1912
02:31:27,868 --> 02:31:30,164
Your loving husband and father.

1914
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:34,109
