1
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,267
- Dad, are you awake?
- Yes.

2
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:29,267
It's time to get up.
What do you think?

3
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:32,133
- Is it breakfast time?
- Yes, it sure is.

4
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,567
- Well.
- Better get up.

5
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,501
I need a bite.

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,300
Need your glasses?

7
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Yeah, on the
pillow there.

8
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,100
Dad, I got your breakfast.

9
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,367
Good for you.
It looks delicious.

10
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,033
Do you need anything else?
Piece of toast, cup of coffee?

11
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,067
No, I don't need no
coffee this morning.

12
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,667
I think I'll do with
the orange juice.

13
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,801
- If you need anything, yell.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,167
- Good morning.
- Morning.

15
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,501
So how's your mom
doing today?

16
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,901
She's doing good.

17
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,434
She working yet?

18
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,834
No, she hasn't found anything.

19
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,133
- Good morning.
- Hey, how are you doing today?

20
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,968
- Good. How are you?
- Terrific.

21
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,767
What can I help you
with this morning?

22
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:28,067
I think I'll have...
a twister.

23
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,567
- Okay. Is this for here or to go?
- It'll be for here.

24
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,467
I want to get
a picture.

25
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,567
Okay.

26
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,534
- 'Cause you're my bestest friend.
- Huh?

27
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:47,000
You're my best friend, and I
just need to get a picture of you.

28
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Where do you want me
to stand?

29
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,033
Here's really good.

30
00:03:57,734 --> 00:04:01,767
It's almost too nice to
go in there, you think?

31
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,701
Yeah, let's go back.

32
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,133
- I was talking to Judy yesterday.
- Yeah?

33
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:09,868
She was telling me about the
huge order they have coming in,

34
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,634
which means we're really gonna
have to pump up production.

35
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:16,100
- That's great.
- That's what I thought.

36
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,167
We're already doing
too much as it is.

37
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:20,234
I think so too.

38
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:22,167
They need to get
some more help.

39
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,200
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

40
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,868
So you think tonight
maybe you can give me a ride

41
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:35,400
to my other job
at the shovel factory?

42
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,801
- You know I will.
- Yeah.

43
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:41,067
I always told you if you ever
needed a ride or anything,

44
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,634
all you had to do was ask.

45
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:44,968
I appreciate it.

46
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,534
No problem.

47
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,501
You been out
on a date lately?

48
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:57,234
No, not for a while.

49
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:59,501
No prospects, huh?

50
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,100
No. I've been busy
working pretty much.

51
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,033
I leave here and I only got so much time
before I have to go to the other job, so...

52
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,767
It's about like the rest
of us, I'm telling you.

53
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,767
Plus I gotta work nights,
so if I want to go out at night,

54
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:15,067
I can't do that,
unless I have a day off, so...

55
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,634
- I'm ready for the beaches.
- Yeah?

56
00:07:17,634 --> 00:07:19,634
- Yeah. I want to go to Aruba.
- Oh, yeah?

57
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:23,434
I saw that on TV the other day.
The beaches are great.

58
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:27,467
I think I'm about done.
How about you?

59
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,868
Yeah. I'm gonna
go and smoke.

60
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,000
You talk to
your dad lately?

61
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,334
No, not since
the last time.

62
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:54,133
It's probably...
six months ago.

63
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,534
Where's he at now?

64
00:07:56,534 --> 00:08:00,400
Last I heard he was living
in Arizona, I think,

65
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,567
and, I guess he got
remarried to someone.

66
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,200
I haven't heard
from him since.

67
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,334
<i>Also approved was $29,000</i>

68
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:17,367
<i>to retain Roseanne Buell as the
county's Juvenile Justice liaison.</i>

69
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:20,167
<i>Nearly 22,000 baby boomers
in West Virginia</i>

70
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:23,067
<i>have no health insurance
as they near retirement.</i>

71
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:27,367
<i>A Marshall University study says of
those who participated in the study,</i>

72
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,400
<i>75% say their health
is in excellent or even...</i>

73
00:10:06,434 --> 00:10:08,200
- Hi.
- Hey.

74
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:10,734
How's work?

75
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:13,434
It was all right.
How are you?

76
00:10:13,434 --> 00:10:16,133
I'm all right.
You hungry?

77
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,868
No,
I don't think so.

78
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,934
- I'm just gonna go to bed.
- All right.

79
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:23,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

80
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:55,801
- You ready for your first day?
- Oh, yeah.

81
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,267
- Not nervous or anything?
- No. I'm fine.

82
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:00,467
Okay, that's great.

83
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:03,767
So tell me again,
do you have airbrush experience?

84
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,367
Yeah. I used to airbrush
T-shirts at the mall.

85
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:09,968
Great. When you were doing that, were
you working with other airbrushers,

86
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:13,968
or were you just
waiting on the customers?

87
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:17,167
No. I just worked by myself.
They would bring me what I needed,

88
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,534
bring me the orders,
and I would take care of it.

89
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:22,434
Okay, well, that's really
good. We'll see what happens.

90
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:23,901
Good morning,
everybody.

91
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:27,167
I know you guys are all aware of
the big order that we've got in,

92
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,167
and we've been working hard
to get it done,

93
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:31,367
but we feel like you guys
need some help.

94
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,601
And so here she is.
Her name is Rose.

95
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,434
We were very fortunate
to find Rose

96
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:37,767
in the fact that she has
airbrush experience.

97
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:42,267
She's worked with stencils before, so
she'll be working in the head-painting area.

98
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,534
I'm sure she'll have questions
throughout the day, so please help her.

99
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:47,601
I found Rose,
when we were interviewing her,

100
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,234
to be very sweet
and the consummate team player,

101
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:55,100
so I think she'll fit in really
well with our workforce here.

102
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,367
So I'll let you guys introduce
her through the course of the day,

103
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:02,267
and, please help her out
with anything that she needs.

104
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:04,801
Get to work.

105
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:20,133
You know you got to double-glue those
before you put 'em in the box, right?

106
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,234
Yes, I'm aware of that.

107
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,300
So do either
of you smoke?

108
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,701
- I don't.
- Yeah, I smoke.

109
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you?

110
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,767
Well, when you're done, if you
want to, we can go grab a cigarette.

111
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,601
- Sure.
- Okay.

112
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,801
Where did you used to work?

113
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,100
I used to work
at a nursing home.

114
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,801
And what'd you do there?

115
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,400
I was a professional
ass-wiper.

116
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,968
You know, the bottom,
the CNA.

117
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:07,133
The one that everybody comes to
when something dirty needs done

118
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:09,334
is basically what I did.

119
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:15,634
I took care of people, the people
who can't do for themselves anymore,

120
00:15:15,634 --> 00:15:18,234
you have to do everything
that they can't do:

121
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:21,033
shower them, dress them,
feed them.

122
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:24,133
Just depends on who you have,
what you have to do.

123
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:28,534
It's a hard job that you really,
really have to be dedicated to.

124
00:15:28,534 --> 00:15:33,133
You really have to like what
you're doing or you just can't.

125
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:36,133
'Cause there's, like, days
you go in there and it's just...

126
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,300
You just want to turn around
and walk out, it's that bad.

127
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,133
This isn't as hard
of work, but...

128
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,300
I don't think I'm gonna
like this much better.

129
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:49,033
And what about you?

130
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,501
What was
the question?

131
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:54,067
Where did you work
before you came here?

132
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,767
I used to work maintenance
in an old factory.

133
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,467
That's cool.

134
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm very ready
to get out of this area.

135
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:13,234
Why is that?

136
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:15,801
'Cause there's
nothing here.

137
00:16:17,334 --> 00:16:19,701
I'm living in this little
apartment with my daughter.

138
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,267
She's two.

139
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:24,567
You can't make money in
this area. It's just poor.

140
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,400
Everything's poor.

141
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:32,767
Are you married?

142
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,634
No, I'm not married.

143
00:16:35,634 --> 00:16:37,901
I thought I would be,

144
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:42,200
but things don't always work out
like you think they're going to.

145
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,467
You know.

146
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:46,934
Just another
bad decision.

147
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,234
Yeah.

148
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,701
What are you doing
right after work today?

149
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:04,300
Well, I probably have to...

150
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,367
get home and see my dad.

151
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:09,801
Do you think you might
be able to give me a ride?

152
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:13,133
I have another job that I
have to be at like right after,

153
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,834
but it's not
that far from here.

154
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,534
Okay.

155
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,667
I'd really
appreciate it.

156
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:21,400
No problem.

157
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:27,801
Are you about done?

158
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,667
Yeah, think so.

159
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:35,901
I guess we're gonna
go have a cigarette,

160
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,200
and we'll see you back up
there in a little bit.

161
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,868
Okay.

162
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,200
Ready?

163
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:19,033
Rose?

164
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,400
Where are you?

165
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,334
I'm in the bathroom.

166
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:44,434
Oh, my God, Rose!
What are you doing?

167
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,067
I'm taking a bath.

168
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:51,501
Do you do this
all the time?

169
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:54,067
No, not all the time.

170
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,200
Remember when I told you
I worked in a nursing home?

171
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,868
I sure did.

172
00:19:57,868 --> 00:20:02,167
I got hit in the back with a
tray table by this little old man.

173
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,267
And it messed up my back. I couldn't
pick Jesse up for like a month.

174
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:09,567
But every once in a while my muscles
will contract, and I get really sore.

175
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,534
And this feels
really good.

176
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:13,534
And my apartment
has no bathtub.

177
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:16,767
It just has a shower,
so I take advantage.

178
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,033
But I clean it when I'm done.
I clean after I bathe.

179
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,767
Okay.

180
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,734
I was kind of wondering.

181
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,901
I didn't know what would happen
if we'd get caught.

182
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,901
No. She won't be here
for a long time.

183
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:31,567
Oh, my gosh!

184
00:20:31,567 --> 00:20:35,634
I mean, every room was the
size of my whole living room.

185
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,901
The bedrooms...

186
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:41,133
You could fit my whole house
in two rooms in that house.

187
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,834
I could not believe it.
Gorgeous!

188
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:47,400
Chandeliers coming down
out of the ceiling.

189
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,801
It was unreal.

190
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:52,634
I mean, just fabulous,
fabulous, fabulous.

191
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:56,734
And then... you are not
gonna believe this.

192
00:20:56,734 --> 00:21:01,801
She tells me how particular
this lady is.

193
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:06,033
And then she invites me inside
of this house that she's cleaning.

194
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,367
Guess what.

195
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,934
She was in
the Jacuzzi bathtub...

196
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:13,767
I am not kidding...
taking a bath.

197
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:16,467
- She was supposed to be cleaning it?
- Yes!

198
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,501
- Got sidetracked.
- I'm not kidding.

199
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:21,234
I couldn't believe it.
I thought I was gonna die.

200
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:24,734
All I could think about was that
lady coming home and catching...

201
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:27,400
You know, here I am,
not supposed to be there,

202
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,167
in there checking
her house out,

203
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,100
and there's Rose
in the tub.

204
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,067
And you know,
I thought, "Wow."

205
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:38,100
Yeah, I'd be afraid of 'em
just coming home too early.

206
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,067
I'm not too sure
about her.

207
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,100
- Yeah?
- What do you think?

208
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,334
I don't know.
She seems fine to me.

209
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,400
- You think so?
- Yeah.

210
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,567
She scares me a little.

211
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:51,667
Hmm.

212
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,067
I was working at a restaurant,
and they work day and night.

213
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,934
Turn two different shifts.

214
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:31,100
I just didn't have anybody
to care for him.

215
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,934
It was really rough, and I didn't want
to have to put him in a nursing home.

216
00:23:34,934 --> 00:23:37,000
- The expense for that is huge.
- Yeah, those places...

217
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,100
And you don't want to do that
unless you absolutely have to.

218
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,601
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

219
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,434
Because a lot of times
they're understaffed

220
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,367
or they don't have all the
equipment that they need.

221
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:49,100
You know, you get people in
there that shouldn't be there,

222
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,868
that should be in other
facilities, that are violent.

223
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:54,534
You know, you just, you never
know what you're gonna get.

224
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:57,601
You don't know who they're gonna
put in the room with 'em.

225
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:59,534
You know,
because it's not...

226
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:06,400
The way that they put people together is not
necessarily by what their sickness may be,

227
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,033
like, you know, put two stroke
patients in the same room.

228
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:14,100
Some people might be bedridden, and
some people might be up walking around.

229
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,868
And they get into each other's
things and tear stuff up.

230
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:20,667
- Glad I didn't do that.
- No.

231
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,434
And as far as, like,
management,

232
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:25,667
they're so tight that
what they'll do is take...

233
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:28,868
You know, you might clock out, but if they
see you walking across the parking lot,

234
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:32,968
they'll be like, "Can you come just for
a minute and come help with this or that?"

235
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:36,334
And you end up staying over
an hour or better.

236
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,267
And that happens
three or four days a week.

237
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:40,033
So you don't even get paid.

238
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:42,467
But you need your job,
so what do you say?

239
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,434
- Yeah.
- You're kind of st...

240
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:47,634
You don't want to make
anybody mad, you know.

241
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:50,100
- And they do it to everybody.
- Oh, really?

242
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,434
So everybody kind of
just did it, you know?

243
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:58,400
Wow. I can't imagine
them doing that here.

244
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,501
We're gonna make quota
and get some of that bonus.

245
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:03,968
- Did you guys hear about that?
- No, I haven't heard anything.

246
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:08,400
Yeah, we're gonna get probably about $50
if we meet quota at the end of the week.

247
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,334
I thought
that was great.

248
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:11,934
That's awfully
nice of 'em.

249
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:15,300
Yeah, that'll help me out
a lot with bills and things.

250
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,167
That's what you'd spend it on if you got it?

251
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,400
I probably will just...

252
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,033
I don't know.

253
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:31,467
I haven't really
thought about it.

254
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:33,868
What do you think
you'll spend yours on?

255
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:36,067
I don't know. If the
weather keeps getting nice,

256
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,167
I'll get camping equipment
or something like that.

257
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:42,234
Oh, that sounds like fun.

258
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,367
Well, if you're looking to make
a little bit of extra money,

259
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:50,300
I was wanting to go out
this weekend.

260
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,234
If you want to baby-sit Jesse
for a few hours,

261
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:56,634
I couldn't pay a whole lot, but
I could give you a little bit.

262
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:59,868
- What night?
- Friday night.

263
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:03,200
If that would
work out for you.

264
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,667
Sure. I think I could
do that for you.

265
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:06,834
- Could you?
- Yeah.

266
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,067
- She's really good.
- How old is she?

267
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,567
- She's two.
- Okay.

268
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:15,934
It'll be nice for her too, 'cause it'll
give her somebody else to be around.

269
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,968
She doesn't... She's not around
too many other people.

270
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,834
What's she like to do?

271
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,701
She likes to color
and she likes to read books.

272
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:25,067
Okay.

273
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:28,834
Yeah, and she goes to bed
at 8:00, so more than likely...

274
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:31,601
That's great, 'cause
that way I can sew after...

275
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:34,834
- Oh, yeah.
- That's good, that's good.

276
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:38,667
- Okay, no problem.
- Great. I'm excited now.

277
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:49,367
Are you about done?

278
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,734
Yeah, pretty much.

279
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,968
- Wanna have a smoke?
- Sure.

280
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:49,701
Now, you know I probably
won't be home till about 11:00,

281
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,467
and I left a number hanging on
the refrigerator if you need me.

282
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,133
- I was wondering if you left me a number.
- Yeah, I sure did.

283
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:59,167
- If I need to get ahold of you.
- Yes, I did.

284
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,334
So she should be going to bed in about
a half an hour, usually about 8:00.

285
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,167
About 15 minutes before
you put her to bed,

286
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,834
just give her a few goldfish
crackers and some juice,

287
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:21,767
just enough to put
something in her stomach.

288
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,601
But she should be all right.
She may cry whenever I leave.

289
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:28,400
- Just kind of expect it.
- Okay.

290
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,868
All you have to do is lay her
down and just read her a book,

291
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:34,801
and she'll get her blanket, suck
her thumb and she'll be done.

292
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,801
All right.
That sounds great.

293
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,868
She's pretty easy.

294
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:44,667
Hey, sweetie,
what do you have there?

295
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:50,868
Who's here?

296
00:28:50,868 --> 00:28:52,634
Watch out.

297
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,300
- Hey, come in.
- Hey, come in.

298
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,567
Hello.

299
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:01,767
Come here, sweetie.

300
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,734
Who's the man?

301
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:07,501
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

302
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:17,901
- So, this is your date?
- Yeah.

303
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:20,167
Oh.

304
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:22,934
We're going out tonight
for a little bit.

305
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,968
And, who's driving?

306
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:30,234
I am. I borrowed a...
I borrowed a car off my friend.

307
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:32,334
Oh.

308
00:29:32,334 --> 00:29:35,100
He let me take it out
tonight.

309
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I see.

310
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,434
Can I have a kiss?

311
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:43,334
Mommy's gonna go for a little
bit. Are you gonna be okay?

312
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,601
- No!
- Yes, you will.

313
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:49,400
- I want my baby!
- Okay, you get your baby.

314
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,067
- I guess we're gonna go and...
- Okay.

315
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,601
- What's that?
- It's another baby.

316
00:29:55,601 --> 00:29:58,133
You can take that baby
and go night-night with it.

317
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:02,000
- Love you.
- Mama, I wanna go with you.

318
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,200
No. You're gonna
stay here with Martha.

319
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,100
Yeah. You're gonna have fun.

320
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,701
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!

321
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,901
We'll read a story. Would
you like to read a story?

322
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:16,834
- No!
- I see a really nice book.

323
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,501
Look! She's got a book.
and she's gonna read to you.

324
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:22,767
- No!
- I'll be back in a little bit.

325
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:27,634
- Here, give me a kiss.
- No! I want to go that way!

326
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,601
You might want
to get her now.

327
00:30:29,601 --> 00:30:32,367
I go that way!

328
00:30:32,367 --> 00:30:33,868
- Come here, sweetie.
- No!

329
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:38,200
- Do you want to play with some toys?
- No!

330
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,901
- Well, come on.
- No!

331
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:42,067
Oh, sweetie.

332
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:51,667
Yeah, but seriously, it seems like every
time I think I'm saving a little bit,

333
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:54,334
getting a little bit ahead,
something comes up.

334
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:57,167
- Jesse gets sick.
- Yeah.

335
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:59,167
Have you been able
to save much?

336
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,567
A little bit. I don't have a
checking account or anything, but...

337
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,767
I got drawer change
I've been saving.

338
00:31:04,767 --> 00:31:07,667
- Drawer change, huh?
- Yeah.

339
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,667
Yeah, he's got
his own place,

340
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:13,000
and then Jesse and I
live together.

341
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,100
Yeah, he wasn't ready
for our baby.

342
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,934
He's an artist, and he's very into
his work and what's going on with him.

343
00:31:18,934 --> 00:31:21,868
He doesn't have time, you know,
for anybody else.

344
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,534
But he helps out with her.

345
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:27,667
He baby-sits while I work sometimes,
if he has time, or whatever.

346
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:31,400
That's good. At least he sticks
around a little bit and sees her.

347
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,133
Yeah.
He makes an effort.

348
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,601
So did you finish
high school?

349
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:44,567
No. Actually, I had anxiety,
and I ended up quitting.

350
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,167
What is that?

351
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:49,334
Oh, just when I got around
a lot of people, you know,

352
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:52,567
I'd get a little bit nervous and
sometimes I'd have a panic attack.

353
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:55,133
- Really?
- Yeah.

354
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:58,968
It was pretty bad,
enough to quit.

355
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:02,167
Did you go to a doctor
or anything for that?

356
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:06,033
Yeah, I did at one point,

357
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:09,567
but they just kept prescribing
me pills that didn't work,

358
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:11,834
so I eventually
just quit going

359
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,200
and dealt with it myself,
you know?

360
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,934
There's not much
you can do about it, so...

361
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:19,000
Are you taking anything
right now?

362
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,868
- No.
- No?

363
00:32:21,868 --> 00:32:25,133
And how do you do?
Does that bother you anymore?

364
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,767
It's not as bad now,
you know.

365
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:30,601
Usually, the places I go, there's
not 400 people like school.

366
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:32,033
Yeah.

367
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,634
It's usually when
there's a lot of people.

368
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:37,467
Lately, it's only temporary
when it's bad.

369
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,901
Did you finish high school?

370
00:32:42,901 --> 00:32:45,200
No, I didn't finish.

371
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,601
What happened there?

372
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,601
I got rebellious
in high school.

373
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,667
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

374
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:55,234
Yeah, I ran away,
hitchhiked to Charleston.

375
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,601
- Yeah.
- How old were you then?

376
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,367
- Fifteen.
- Kind of dangerous, isn't it?

377
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:03,467
Yeah, a little bit.

378
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,567
It was fun at the time.

379
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,801
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

380
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:12,234
And look now.

381
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,067
- I'd like to save up and get a car.
- Oh, yeah.

382
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,634
- That's nice to have.
- Yeah.

383
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,968
So where do you live?

384
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:30,634
- I live with my mom right now.
- Oh, really?

385
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:33,868
Yeah. It's just
a matter of money, really.

386
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:36,634
Trying to save up.
It's the easiest way to do it.

387
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:40,133
Yeah, I hear you.

388
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,033
Is your mom home
right now?

389
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:54,367
Well, actually,
I don't know.

390
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,534
Well, would you rather just
like maybe go back there

391
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:03,601
where there's not
so many people?

392
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:05,767
Well, I guess we could, yeah.

393
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:06,934
Okay.

394
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:21,334
Those are very pretty.
Your mom must like jewelry.

395
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,167
Yeah.

396
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,267
Look at that.

397
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:26,667
- It's pretty.
- Yeah.

398
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,067
Oh, we lost it.

399
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,934
- It's a giraffe.
- A giraffe. Oh, okay.

400
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,400
It looks like a dinosaur
a little bit.

401
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,100
- It's a giraffe-dinosaur.
- Yeah.

402
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,467
What's this?

403
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,901
A purple necklace.

404
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,767
- Is that a purple necklace?
- Yeah.

405
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:13,567
Mom, this is Rose.

406
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:16,567
- Hi, Rose. What's up?
- It's nice to meet you.

407
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:19,601
Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.
What are you guys doing?

408
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:23,701
Nothing. This is the girl that they
hired at the factory the other day.

409
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:26,567
- Hi. Kyle told me about you.
- Oh, really?

410
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:29,434
Yeah, he did.
So how do you like it there?

411
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:31,167
It's pretty good.
It's not too bad.

412
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,167
It's busy but,
you know, it's a job.

413
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:35,567
Yeah, jobs really
get that way.

414
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,634
You guys wanna watch this?
It's pretty good.

415
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:41,033
No. I think we're just gonna go hang
out in the bedroom for a little bit.

416
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:43,467
- Okay.
- All right.

417
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,834
Okay.

418
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:50,834
- See you later.
- Bye.

419
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:01,000
This is a pretty interesting
room you have.

420
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:06,968
What's that picture of?

421
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:10,968
That's a tattoo. My friend
drew it for me there.

422
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:14,367
He does tattoos
and stuff.

423
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,234
That is crazy-looking.

424
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:18,567
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I like it.

425
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:20,934
Do you have any tattoos?

426
00:36:20,934 --> 00:36:24,767
Yeah, I got two tattoos
on my arm here.

427
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,667
No kidding.

428
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,367
Are they
exactly the same?

429
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:31,834
Yeah. They're symmetrical.

430
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,968
That's cool.
Are you gonna get any more?

431
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:41,934
Yeah, I'll probably end up
getting up to about here or so.

432
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,634
He'll probably come up with
something good I can put on.

433
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:48,267
A friend of mine in Marietta
did one on my back.

434
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:49,734
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

435
00:36:49,734 --> 00:36:51,767
I'm not ready
for another one though.

436
00:36:51,767 --> 00:36:53,367
Did it hurt or anything?

437
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,200
No, it didn't hurt.

438
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,767
I'm just, I don't know what
else I want that's like forever.

439
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,400
- Yeah.
- You know.

440
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,334
Oh, yeah.
It's definitely permanent.

441
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:05,334
Oh, yeah. Do you like
hanging out in tattoo shops?

442
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:08,367
Yeah. I got a couple friends
that are tattoo artists.

443
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:11,601
Yeah, it is fun.
You meet a lot of people.

444
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:13,501
Yeah.

445
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:16,434
Wow. That's a nice watch.
Where'd you get that?

446
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,868
Thank you.

447
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,734
It was a gift from someone.
I used to clean their house.

448
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,200
Oh, yeah?
Kind of like a tip?

449
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,868
- Yeah, like a big thank-you.
- That's nice of them.

450
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,701
Yeah, it was
very nice of them.

451
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,734
<i>I see you've got a lot of
High Times stuff. Do you smoke?</i>

452
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,033
Yeah, I'm a smoker.

453
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,868
Oh, yeah? I figured.

454
00:37:37,868 --> 00:37:39,200
Yeah, I'm a smoker.

455
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,234
Would your mom get mad
if we smoked in here?

456
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:48,501
I think I can make it
so she won't know.

457
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:51,501
Yeah. I just don't want her
prying in.

458
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,033
Right, yeah.

459
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:54,834
Yeah, I think we can
get away with it.

460
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:57,367
That's cool.

461
00:37:57,367 --> 00:38:00,000
Do you,
want a drink or anything?

462
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,167
You know, that would be good.
Do you have any beer?

463
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:03,767
Yeah, I got a beer.

464
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,167
I'll be right back.

465
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:46,033
Thank you very much.

466
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,601
- Oh, man.
- What?

467
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:02,701
It's starting to get kind of late.
I'm gonna have to get back to Jesse.

468
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:05,801
I told Martha we'd only be
a few hours, but...

469
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:10,300
I'll just let you have this, and you can
save it for another time or later, whatever.

470
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,334
Okay. I'm sure I'll
save it for another time.

471
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:16,567
We can hang out and drink a beer,
and then we're gonna have to take off.

472
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,667
All right, that's cool.

473
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:25,100
So I don't think I wanna go back
in there because of Martha and all.

474
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,868
What about Martha?

475
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,701
I don't know. She gave me a weird
vibe when I was in there earlier

476
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,701
like she was mad at me
or something.

477
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:33,100
For going out with me?

478
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,434
I don't know.
It could be anything.

479
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:38,901
She just gave me a weird vibe
when I was in there earlier.

480
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:43,000
Okay, that's fine.
I did have fun with you though.

481
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,901
Yeah, I did too. Definitely
have to do it again.

482
00:39:48,901 --> 00:39:51,067
Well, just, you know,
get ahold of me.

483
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:54,000
- Yeah, all right.
- I'll see you at work Monday.

484
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,534
- Okay. Talk to you later.
- Bye.

485
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:26,067
So how was your date?

486
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:28,067
Oh, it was all right.

487
00:40:28,067 --> 00:40:30,367
I really wish you guys
would've told me.

488
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,400
Told you what?

489
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,767
That you guys were
going out together.

490
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,767
- Why?
- Well, you could've told...

491
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:41,801
- I felt like an idiot.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

492
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,567
- How was Jesse?
- Jesse was great.

493
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,467
Was she? Did you have
a good time with her?

494
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:47,334
Yeah. She really likes
those necklaces.

495
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:50,434
Yeah, she does.
She's something.

496
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:54,501
Sure is. She went to bed
about like what you said.

497
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,901
Had her juice and her crackers
and went up to bed.

498
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:05,868
- Hey, guess what.
- Hey.

499
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,634
Guess what happened
at my house.

500
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,901
What do you want?

501
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,267
A little bit of money,

502
00:41:14,267 --> 00:41:17,133
a bag of herb...

503
00:41:17,133 --> 00:41:18,801
and the truth.

504
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:20,434
That's about it.

505
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:23,968
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay, cool. Exactly.

506
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,167
- What?
- All the shit that's missing from my house.

507
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:30,534
- Where the fuck is it?
- I was out.

508
00:41:30,534 --> 00:41:35,200
- I wasn't at your house.
- Yeah, I noticed. He's cute.

509
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,234
- He is none of your business.
- Okay, then take his money.

510
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:42,300
- Don't come in my house, in my face...
- Then don't come in my house!

511
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,767
I didn't go in your house
and take your shit, okay?

512
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:49,200
I don't have anything of yours.

513
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,400
You have my car, that you like to drive
around town, that you're so happy with.

514
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,200
- I need the damn car, okay?
- You don't think I need it?

515
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,968
I take Jesse around,
I take her out shopping,

516
00:41:57,968 --> 00:42:00,601
buying her fucking Happy Meals,
all that good shit.

517
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,667
But I can't do it
without my damn money.

518
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:04,801
- I don't have your money.
- Okay.

519
00:42:04,801 --> 00:42:07,501
I don't have your
fucking money, Jake!

520
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,834
It's not here. You can look
around. There's no money.

521
00:42:09,834 --> 00:42:12,367
I have no money,
and I have no weed.

522
00:42:12,367 --> 00:42:15,033
- You're childish.
- You are such a fucking baby.

523
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,100
It's all about Jake. What
Jake wants, what Jake needs.

524
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,167
- I don't have your shit!
- I need my money.

525
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:26,300
Go sell some of your shit
and make some money.

526
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,000
Principle of what?
You coming into my house,

527
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,200
banging on my door late at
night, accusing me of shit?

528
00:42:34,334 --> 00:42:36,367
You need to pick my shit
off the floor.

529
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,200
Pick it up
and give me my money.

530
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,667
Unless you spent it all. At
least did you spend it on Jesse?

531
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:44,100
- Did did you buy her some clothes?
- Get out of my house.

532
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,267
Oh, excuse me.

533
00:42:52,267 --> 00:42:54,367
- Was that Jesse's daddy?
- You know what?

534
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:57,601
Martha, please, just
mind your own business, okay?

535
00:42:57,601 --> 00:42:59,334
Read your book.

536
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,934
Hello, Sergeant.
Detective Taylor.

537
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,767
- Sgt. Davis.
- What do we got?

538
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:08,634
We got a phone call at 6:45
from a neighbor

539
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:11,901
stating that a child had
been crying all night long.

540
00:44:11,901 --> 00:44:15,634
She couldn't get anybody to
answer the door, so she called 911.

541
00:44:15,634 --> 00:44:17,601
We responded, made entry.

542
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:21,167
Once inside, we found a 23-year-old
female on the living room floor

543
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:23,467
by the name
of Rose Hilliard.

544
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:25,534
Okay.
Any sign of forced entry?

545
00:44:25,534 --> 00:44:27,934
- No sign.
- Any sign of robbery?

546
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,734
Doesn't appear to be.

547
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:33,534
- What about a struggle?
- Appears to be a struggle, yes.

548
00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:35,701
- Let's go and take a look.
- Okay.

549
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:42,334
Dad, I've got your breakfast.

550
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:44,934
Well, how nice of you.

551
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:46,734
What are we having,
cereal this morning?

552
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,334
Yeah. Cereal and some juice.

553
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:02,033
Well, you're right, Sarge. There's no
sign of forced entry into the apartment.

554
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:06,501
Doesn't look like a robbery. Her
valuables and her purse are still here.

555
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:14,200
She's got bruising to the neck, which
is consistent with manual strangulation.

556
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,534
She's got petechiae
hemorrhage of the eyes.

557
00:45:16,534 --> 00:45:18,968
- Where's the baby?
- Baby's with the grandmother.

558
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:21,000
- So the baby's safe?
- Yes.

559
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Ross, when you're doing
the fingerprints,

560
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I want you to process the
bruising on her neck for prints.

561
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,701
Okay, sir.

562
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:31,367
What did we find out from
the neighborhood canvass?

563
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,167
Officer Smeeks?

564
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,801
You wanna fill the detective
in on what you know?

565
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:42,200
Okay. Now, I spoke to
three of the neighbors.

566
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:54,267
Hey, Mom, you didn't happen to pick
up any money in my room, did you?

567
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:57,167
No, I didn't.
I haven't been in your room.

568
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,467
- Didn't see in your room.
- All right.

569
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:01,467
Maybe you spent more than
you thought you did.

570
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:06,133
I had a little bit saved up, so I
might have misplaced it or something.

571
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:09,033
I was checking if you were
in there and picked it up.

572
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:12,167
No, haven't been in there.
Haven't seen it.

573
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,601
Was it a lot of money?

574
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:16,167
No, just a little I had
saved up for an emergency.

575
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:36,167
This is a ring that
my mother had given me.

576
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:39,434
When I turned 30, she said I'd be
responsible enough to take care of it.

577
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:41,334
Okay, so it's pretty
sentimental, huh?

578
00:46:41,334 --> 00:46:44,834
Yeah, it is, and this is
my grandmother's broach,

579
00:46:44,834 --> 00:46:46,901
and that was handed down
through the family,

580
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:50,601
and my mother thought she
had gotten that, but I got it.

581
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:52,501
You'll never guess
where this came from.

582
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:53,601
Where's that?

583
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:56,167
I found this in the park
with a metal detector.

584
00:46:56,167 --> 00:46:59,234
- Oh, wow. Nice find.
- I thought that was pretty good.

585
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:20,767
Jake? I'm Det. Taylor
from the police department.

586
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:23,234
I need to talk to you
for a minute. Can I come in?

587
00:47:23,234 --> 00:47:25,167
Is it necessary?

588
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:26,767
It's kind of important.

589
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:29,834
It's about Rose Hilliard.
I need to talk to you about her.

590
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:31,868
All right, man.
Come on in.

591
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:35,634
Right through this door.

592
00:47:35,634 --> 00:47:40,234
- Did you do this on the walls?
- Yeah, yeah, most of it.

593
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:41,601
Very interesting.

594
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:43,367
Some would say.

595
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:44,934
How long have you known Rose?

596
00:47:44,934 --> 00:47:48,400
Oh, man, I've known her
for a while, like...

597
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,567
We were together for at least
a year and a half.

598
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:55,868
Probably altogether, I guess five
years, somewhere around there.

599
00:47:55,868 --> 00:47:58,934
Okay. I guess you share
a child together?

600
00:47:58,934 --> 00:48:01,801
- Yeah.
- What's your daughter's name?

601
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:03,567
- Jesse.
- Okay.

602
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,234
So when was the last time
you saw Rose?

603
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:11,534
- What day is today?
- Saturday.

604
00:48:11,534 --> 00:48:13,934
Just last night.

605
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:16,367
- So it was last night you were over there?
- Yeah, yeah, Friday night.

606
00:48:16,367 --> 00:48:18,834
Do you remember
about what time that was?

607
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,033
Like 11 something.

608
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:23,834
It was later, man, like
she was coming from a date.

609
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,667
Why did you go over there?

610
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:31,300
Because, man, she's ignorant,
and she stole money of mine.

611
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,400
- Did you get to talk to her?
- Yeah, I talked to her.

612
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,801
Was there anybody else there at
the house when you were there?

613
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:40,167
I remember she had
some chick on the couch.

614
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,767
Do you know
who that person was?

615
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:44,467
No, not a clue.

616
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,801
Okay.
What did she look like?

617
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,234
Looked like a person on
a couch, man. I don't know.

618
00:48:51,234 --> 00:48:53,634
- So you didn't pay much attention to her?
- No, man.

619
00:48:53,634 --> 00:48:57,234
Okay. Did you confront Rose
about her taking money from you?

620
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,367
- Hell yeah.
- Did you get into an argument?

621
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,367
I don't know. That's just
kind of how we talk nowadays.

622
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:06,968
- Just tell me...
- Yeah, yeah, man!

623
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:08,801
She took my money.
I wanted my money back.

624
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:10,267
Okay.

625
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:12,267
She wasn't about
to give it to me,

626
00:49:12,267 --> 00:49:15,300
or just even give me satisfaction
of admitting she did it.

627
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,267
Did you guys get into
a screaming match?

628
00:49:17,267 --> 00:49:20,767
No, man. The kid was
sleeping upstairs.

629
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,100
So what happened?

630
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:27,167
I went in and asked her,
"Where's my money?"

631
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:32,100
Like usual, she told me, "I
don't have it. I didn't take it."

632
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,901
She said, "Get the hell
out of my house," and I left.

633
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:37,400
Do you have any idea
why I'm here?

634
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,467
No, man.

635
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:41,100
Rose was murdered.

636
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,567
Whoa. Okay.

637
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,567
Do you have any knowledge
about who did that?

638
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:48,267
No, not me.
I know that much.

639
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:52,267
From looking around your apartment, I can
tell you're a very passionate individual.

640
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:53,934
Artistic and passionate.

641
00:49:53,934 --> 00:49:56,067
Not passionate to beat
her ass or anything,

642
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,501
otherwise you probably would've
heard of me a long time ago.

643
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:00,501
You've never been physical
with her in the past?

644
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:02,334
No, man, not really.

645
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:04,767
So when you left, she was
alive and everything was fine?

646
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:07,100
Well, I wouldn't say
everything was fine,

647
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,868
but she seemed to breathe
and speak and move about.

648
00:50:10,868 --> 00:50:15,300
So while you were there, you didn't get into
any kind of physical altercation with her.

649
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,300
No, man! So you're...
She's dead?

650
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,200
She's dead.

651
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,767
Wow, man.

652
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,634
I need to call some people, man.

653
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:28,567
I need to see
my daughter.

654
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:44,534
The darker the water,
the darker the bait,

655
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:47,133
which doesn't
make any sense at all,

656
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:51,767
but if the water you're going
to be fishing in is real clear,

657
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,534
you'll want
the lighter colors.

658
00:50:53,534 --> 00:50:57,133
...for the spinner rates,
and they lock down.

659
00:50:57,133 --> 00:51:00,767
And then there's little boxes that
you can put whatever you please.

660
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:04,467
Hey, that is nice.
And how much does this run?

661
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,934
$18.95.

662
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:21,400
- Kyle?
- Yeah.

663
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,267
I think you better
come out here.

664
00:51:23,267 --> 00:51:25,501
- Somebody wants to see you.
- All right.

665
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:26,667
It's a cop.

666
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:35,467
How long
have you known Rose?

667
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,801
Oh, probably about
a week now.

668
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:40,567
Okay, and what's
your relationship with her?

669
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:43,801
Well, we worked together,
and we were friends.

670
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:48,000
You know,
we just met, so...

671
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,601
- When was the last time you saw Rose?
- I was with her last night.

672
00:51:51,601 --> 00:51:53,534
Okay. What did you guys do?

673
00:51:53,534 --> 00:51:56,501
We went out
for a couple beers,

674
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:59,267
and we came back here
for a little bit,

675
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:01,767
then I took her home.

676
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:03,968
Was anybody else
with you last night?

677
00:52:03,968 --> 00:52:06,000
- No.
- Okay.

678
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,133
About what time did you
drop her off home last night?

679
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:11,567
It was probably
around 11:00.

680
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:14,167
Okay. During the time
that you were together,

681
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:19,067
did she express any concerns that
someone might want to hurt her?

682
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:21,067
Something happen to her?

683
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:23,467
Yeah. She was murdered
last night.

684
00:52:24,968 --> 00:52:27,434
- What?
- She was murdered.

685
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:30,467
- Where?
- At her home.

686
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:32,601
Do you know of anybody
that would want to hurt her?

687
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:36,067
No. She didn't
say anything.

688
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:41,234
When you say you picked her
What time did you pick her up last night?

689
00:52:41,234 --> 00:52:45,467
It was probably
about 7:00. 6:00 or 7:00.

690
00:52:45,467 --> 00:52:48,901
Did you go into her house
when you stopped to pick her up?

691
00:52:48,901 --> 00:52:49,968
Yeah, I went in.

692
00:52:49,968 --> 00:52:51,634
Was there anybody else there?

693
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:54,400
Yeah. Martha was there.
She was babysitting for her.

694
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,634
Who's Martha?

695
00:52:55,634 --> 00:53:00,067
She's another girl
I work with.

696
00:53:00,067 --> 00:53:02,000
Does she have red hair?

697
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,334
Yeah.

698
00:53:15,334 --> 00:53:18,968
And then I also
sew some doll clothes.

699
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:21,734
You do what?

700
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:24,934
I sew doll clothes in the
evenings for the dolls.

701
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,567
- Really?
- Yeah.

702
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:29,167
It's a lot of fun.

703
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,133
You do that with anybody
or just by yourself?

704
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,868
Just by myself.

705
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:36,534
My dad's at home, and that way
I just spend some time with him.

706
00:53:36,534 --> 00:53:38,901
He usually watches TV
while I sew.

707
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:11,367
- Hi.
- Hi.

708
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:13,601
Is Kyle here?

709
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:17,000
- Yeah.
- Care if I come in?

710
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,167
- Come on in.
- How you doing?

711
00:54:19,167 --> 00:54:21,300
I'm okay.
How are you doing?

712
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,400
Terrific.

713
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,767
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

714
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,300
Okay.

715
00:54:32,033 --> 00:54:34,200
That's nice.

716
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,501
Hang on. I'll get Kyle.

717
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:38,901
Kyle, Martha's here.

718
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,200
- Oh.
- I don't know.

719
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:45,267
- Hi. What are you doing?
- Hey, Martha.

720
00:54:45,267 --> 00:54:49,033
- I've been trying to get ahold of you.
- I've been out all day.

721
00:54:49,033 --> 00:54:52,100
I went to the beauty parlor and
went and bought a couple things.

722
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,934
- Has anybody talked to you yet?
- About what?

723
00:54:54,934 --> 00:54:56,934
About Rose.

724
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:59,033
What about Rose?

725
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:01,901
She was killed
last night.

726
00:55:01,901 --> 00:55:06,200
She was murdered last night.
She was strangled.

727
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,501
- No.
- Yes.

728
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:10,067
- Last night?
- Yeah.

729
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,200
Oh, my God.

730
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,467
There was
a detective here today.

731
00:55:13,467 --> 00:55:15,767
You have got to be kidding me.

732
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:19,834
Yeah. He just came in today
and told us.

733
00:55:19,834 --> 00:55:21,534
He asked me
a bunch of questions.

734
00:55:21,534 --> 00:55:23,100
And this happened
last night.

735
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

736
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:29,734
Yeah, they were asking me because they
thought I was the last one that seen her.

737
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:33,100
- Then I told him you were...
- You brought her home when I was there.

738
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,167
Yeah.

739
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:36,868
You are not gonna
believe this.

740
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:42,000
When I was there last night
after you dropped her off,

741
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,267
this guy started
beating on the door,

742
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:50,567
and she goes to the door and
she opens it up, and he comes in.

743
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:53,234
He came in
screaming and yelling.

744
00:55:53,234 --> 00:55:55,968
She was okay when you left.
I mean, she was by herself.

745
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:59,234
She was fine, yeah.
When I left, she was fine.

746
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:04,234
But if he was waiting out there
when you dropped her off,

747
00:56:04,234 --> 00:56:06,667
he was probably
waiting on me to leave.

748
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:08,701
- Yeah.
- And he went back in there.

749
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:10,634
Oh, my God.

750
00:56:12,334 --> 00:56:15,000
I can't even imagine.

751
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,133
I know.
It happened too fast.

752
00:56:18,133 --> 00:56:19,968
I know.

753
00:56:19,968 --> 00:56:22,701
Well, I got these
for you.

754
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:25,100
Oh, well, thank you.

755
00:56:26,868 --> 00:56:28,133
Thank you, Martha.

756
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:29,834
You're quite welcome.

757
00:56:29,834 --> 00:56:32,667
Yeah, definitely, you have
to call this detective too.

758
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:34,801
Oh, I will. You'll have to
give me the number.

759
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:21,434
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Hello, Martha.

760
00:57:21,434 --> 00:57:23,434
I'm Det. Taylor from
the police department.

761
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:25,901
I need to talk to you about
Rose Hilliard. Can I come in?

762
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,367
Oh, sure. Come on in.

763
00:57:28,367 --> 00:57:30,801
I heard from Kyle today,
and he was telling me

764
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:34,100
that something horrible had happened
to Rose, that she'd been murdered.

765
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,300
- Can I come in and have a seat?
- Sure. This is my father.

766
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,267
Sir, I'm from the police department. I
was just here to talk to your daughter.

767
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:42,234
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

768
00:57:42,234 --> 00:57:46,200
I mean, at first I thought
she was a really sweet girl.

769
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,434
And then the longer
you get to know her,

770
00:57:48,434 --> 00:57:53,000
the pushier she gets and
the more favors she asks for.

771
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,267
I mean, it was just one favor
right after the other one.

772
00:57:56,267 --> 00:57:58,734
Did you feel like she
took advantage of you?

773
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:00,334
A little bit, yeah.

774
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:02,534
Did she do that
to other people?

775
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:06,133
I'm not really sure. It seemed
like she picked on me a lot.

776
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:10,000
She didn't really buddy up
with the other employees.

777
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,534
She'd only been there a week.

778
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,234
Well, in talking with
the witnesses in the area,

779
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:18,968
they indicate that you were the last
one that was seen leaving the residence.

780
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:23,100
Well, I know that...

781
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,701
Well, I don't know.
I probably was.

782
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:27,968
I left after he did.

783
00:58:27,968 --> 00:58:31,367
And that fact that, as far as
the investigation is concerned,

784
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:34,567
you were the last one that
we know that saw her alive.

785
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:36,000
Okay.

786
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,300
At some point, I would like
to get fingerprints from you

787
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,334
to be able to compare to evidence
that we collected at the scene.

788
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:43,400
Well, you know my fingerprints
are gonna be there.

789
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,601
I was there.

790
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:47,000
Right, but there's other
evidence that we have -

791
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,934
- that would only be the killer's.
- Okay.

792
00:58:49,934 --> 00:58:52,534
Would you be willing to come
to the police department tonight

793
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:53,934
and give me
a set of fingerprints?

794
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay. I would have to get
someone to take care of my dad.

795
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And about how long
will that take?

796
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,567
Shouldn't take
more than 15, 20 minutes -

797
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,634
- to get the fingerprints.
- Okay.

798
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:07,267
If you'd be able to do it tonight,
it'd really help with the investigation.

799
00:59:07,267 --> 00:59:09,801
I'll do anything I can to help.

800
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:07,133
- Hello, Martha.
- Detective.

801
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:09,734
Thanks for meeting
with me again.

802
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:12,901
I just got a few more questions
that we need to talk about, -

803
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,901
- if that's okay.
- Okay.

804
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:17,367
Do you care if I record
our conversation?

805
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,067
- No.
- Okay.

806
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:22,534
I'll just go ahead
and start the tape.

807
01:00:22,534 --> 01:00:26,868
What I like for you to do is go over
the events again with me of Friday night.

808
01:00:26,868 --> 01:00:29,567
Do you remember about what time
Kyle came to the house?

809
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,601
No, I don't.

810
01:00:30,601 --> 01:00:32,601
Okay.
Did Kyle come inside?

811
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:33,868
Yes, he did.

812
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:36,000
And did he stay
very long?

813
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,901
No. They, uh...

814
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:43,000
They talked a little bit,
and,...

815
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:47,367
They weren't there very long.

816
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:50,267
- Do you know where they went?
- No, I don't.

817
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:54,334
Okay, so when they left, it was
just you and the small child.

818
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:58,067
- Yes.
- And what did you do that evening?

819
01:00:58,067 --> 01:00:59,767
The child and I just played,

820
01:00:59,767 --> 01:01:03,534
and then I watched some TV
and read some books

821
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:08,667
and gave her some juice,
and she went right to sleep.

822
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:12,934
Rose had told me that it wouldn't take
her very long, and she was very good.

823
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:15,267
Okay. Nothing unusual
happened then?

824
01:01:15,267 --> 01:01:17,801
- No.
- What time did Rose come home?

825
01:01:17,801 --> 01:01:21,033
It was close to 11:00.

826
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:24,634
Okay, and did you
immediately leave or...

827
01:01:24,634 --> 01:01:29,701
No. When she came in, we sat down
and she asked me how Jesse was,

828
01:01:29,701 --> 01:01:32,701
and I asked her
about her date.

829
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:39,200
Then, of course,
that man came to the door.

830
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,434
Yeah, you told me
that an individual came.

831
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:42,767
- Yes.
- It was her ex-boyfriend?

832
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,033
Right. He had been...

833
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:49,567
I guess he had been sitting
outside waiting on her.

834
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:52,501
- And did they argue?
- Yes, they sure did.

835
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:54,501
You told me that they had
gotten into an argument.

836
01:01:54,501 --> 01:01:57,667
Again, tell me
what that was about.

837
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:01,200
He had said that she had stole
some things from the apartment

838
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,901
and some money.

839
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:09,434
How did it end with them?
Did it turn physical?

840
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,667
Well, there was
a lot of yelling and...

841
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,901
I'm not sure
whether he shoved her,

842
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:21,300
but I know she had grabbed ahold of
him to try to get him out the door.

843
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,400
Was she able to get him
out of the house?

844
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,767
It took awhile.

845
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:31,033
Okay. But he did ultimately
leave the apartment.

846
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:32,501
Yes. Yes, he did.

847
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:35,467
Did you see him any more
that night?

848
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:37,934
No. I didn't.

849
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:40,367
I just got in my car and left.

850
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:42,734
Okay, and where did you go
when you left?

851
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:45,667
- I went straight home.
- Okay.

852
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:48,033
And I spoke to your dad
the night that we talked,

853
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:52,601
and he said you came home about
the same time that you're saying.

854
01:02:54,167 --> 01:02:58,000
Is there anything else that
you can tell me at this point?

855
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,267
Well, the thing that,
you know, really bothers me

856
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:05,434
is that he was waiting outside
on her to get home.

857
01:03:06,868 --> 01:03:09,434
So what if he was still there
after I left?

858
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:13,367
Okay. Do you remember
when we talked at your house

859
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:18,000
you indicated to me that you'd do anything
you could to help with this investigation?

860
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,868
Yes, I did.

861
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:23,734
Well, what you need to do is start
telling me the truth about what happened.

862
01:03:23,734 --> 01:03:25,067
So I am.

863
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:29,167
We have got the physical
evidence back from the lab,

864
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:33,100
and it implicates you in
the death of Rose Hilliard.

865
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,968
I don't see how. How?

866
01:03:35,968 --> 01:03:41,234
Your fingerprints were lifted
off the bruises around her neck.

867
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,300
I don't understand it.

868
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,567
Now, Martha, this is the opportunity
for you to help yourself here.

869
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:51,167
Now, either you are
a cold-blooded killer, -

870
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:54,000
- which I don't think is the case...
- No.

871
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,634
or something happened in that
apartment that caused you to do this.

872
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:03,200
There is no doubt
that you did this. None.

873
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,501
But only you can explain to me what happened,

874
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:07,868
and I want you
to do that.

875
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:16,334
I can't. I just...
I don't know.

876
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:21,767
Is there any way that you can explain
your fingerprints around her neck?

877
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:24,734
No, sir. No, sir.

878
01:04:24,734 --> 01:04:26,868
And the neighbors saw you
leave the apartment.

879
01:04:26,868 --> 01:04:28,868
You were the last one
to leave the apartment.

880
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:33,100
The evidence is there.
You will be convicted of this.

881
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,200
You need to tell me the truth
about what happened.

882
01:04:41,234 --> 01:04:43,734
I don't know.
I don't know.

883
01:04:43,734 --> 01:04:46,267
Well, the jury's not
going to believe that.

884
01:04:46,267 --> 01:04:48,300
I want you to look
at these photographs.

885
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:53,167
That what she looks like.
That's what you did you her.

886
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:57,834
A jury's not gonna have sympathy for you
if you don't show some kind of remorse.

887
01:04:57,834 --> 01:05:00,834
Now, it can be explained
how this happened.

888
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:03,601
Maybe you got into an argument with
her, maybe things got out of hand.

889
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:07,100
But only you know that.
She can't tell us.

890
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,234
- I couldn't have done this.
- Well, you did.

891
01:05:10,234 --> 01:05:12,534
No, sir. No. No.

892
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:35,100
Mr. Hightower, I wanted to come over and
talk to you and let you know what's going on.

893
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,767
Okay. I was
wondering about it.

894
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,267
I just finished
talking with Martha,

895
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:42,334
and based upon
my interview with her

896
01:05:42,334 --> 01:05:45,501
and evidence that we
recovered from the scene,

897
01:05:45,501 --> 01:05:48,734
she's been arrested for
the murder of Rose Hilliard.

898
01:05:48,734 --> 01:05:51,701
Is that right?

899
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:55,167
And I wanted to come over and
make you aware of what's going on

900
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:57,567
because you
are her family.

901
01:05:57,567 --> 01:05:59,167
Yes.

902
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:01,701
She's currently
at the jail

903
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:06,000
and that's where she'll be
until there's a hearing date.

904
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,701
What the hell.
Sorry to hear it.

905
01:06:13,701 --> 01:06:15,701
Do you have
any questions for me?

906
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,767
Do you know when
her hearing will be?

907
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:21,334
It'll be fairly soon.

908
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:24,100
And they will give her
an attorney.

909
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:49,701
Hey, Martha.

910
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:53,033
Hi, Kyle. I'm really glad you
came. It's horrible in here.

911
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:54,100
Yeah?

912
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,067
So what's going on?

913
01:06:56,067 --> 01:06:58,200
I don't know.
I don't understand.

914
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,334
I don't even know
why I'm here, really.

915
01:07:00,334 --> 01:07:03,133
And they think
I killed her.

916
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:07,834
Kyle, you know me. You know
I could not have done that.

917
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:12,801
I think... I really...
I think it's Jesse's dad.

918
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:18,634
And I can't... I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

919
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,234
You got to help me, Kyle.

920
01:07:20,234 --> 01:07:24,334
You know that I would
never do anything like this.

921
01:07:24,334 --> 01:07:25,467
Yeah.

922
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:28,534
I don't understand.

923
01:07:28,534 --> 01:07:31,000
And it seemed like
the detective...

924
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,367
They think that I did this,
and I don't see how.

925
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:39,067
I don't see how
that can be right.

926
01:07:39,067 --> 01:07:41,267
I don't know, Martha.

927
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:45,501
I don't understand it.
I don't know.

928
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:48,534
I don't know what,
you know, what I did.

929
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:52,634
I know that I had a really,
really, really bad headache,

930
01:07:52,634 --> 01:07:56,167
and when he started yelling,
I just wanted to go home.

931
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:59,133
And I didn't know
who he was,

932
01:07:59,133 --> 01:08:02,601
and when I tried
to ask her who he was,

933
01:08:02,601 --> 01:08:06,367
she told me to
mind my own business.

934
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:10,367
And that kind of
made me feel bad

935
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:14,567
because, I thought, you know, I thought
I could talk to her like a daughter.

936
01:08:14,567 --> 01:08:17,767
I mean, after all,
she left me with, you know,

937
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:20,501
her most prized
possession: her baby.

938
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:22,200
Yeah.

939
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,133
And she's asked me for
all kinds of favors,

940
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:28,601
and I just didn't think it
was too much to ask who he was.

941
01:08:28,601 --> 01:08:32,601
And she was really mad and
didn't want to talk about it.

942
01:08:34,968 --> 01:08:36,567
I don't know, Martha.

943
01:08:37,868 --> 01:08:40,601
You got to help me, Kyle.
You got to.

944
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:42,968
I mean, I don't
what I can do, but...

945
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,801
I... I don't know
how this happened.

946
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:50,234
We have to figure this out.
We have to.

947
01:08:50,234 --> 01:08:54,901
I didn't do it, Kyle. You know
I wouldn't do anything like that.

948
01:08:54,901 --> 01:08:56,634
Yeah.

949
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:58,701
I don't know, Martha.

950
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:02,801
- I just... I don't understand.
- I don't either.

951
01:09:20,334 --> 01:09:22,067
Good morning, everyone.

952
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:24,834
We've obviously gone through
a very tragic set of events.

953
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:28,367
It is...

954
01:09:28,367 --> 01:09:32,167
But we need move on,
and because of that,

955
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:35,901
we have gone out and we have
hired Kyle's mom, Helen,

956
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:37,501
with the idea that...

957
01:09:37,501 --> 01:09:43,434
She can't take the two ladies'
place because they are, you know...

958
01:09:43,434 --> 01:09:45,234
We had a longtime employee

959
01:09:45,234 --> 01:09:48,234
and we had a short-time employee
who was doing very well,

960
01:09:48,234 --> 01:09:51,234
but we feel like with...

961
01:09:51,234 --> 01:09:53,901
Even though Kyle's mom
doesn't have a lot experience,

962
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:57,968
that you guys can work with her, get
her up to speed just as soon as possible.

963
01:09:57,968 --> 01:09:59,367
Hi.

964
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:03,767
You show me what to do.
I'll do the best I can.

965
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,934
Help you out.

966
01:11:36,734 --> 01:11:38,601
Oh, my God.
