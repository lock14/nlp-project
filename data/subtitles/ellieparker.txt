1
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,514
Cut! No, no.
That's... No.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,012
You're already dead.

3
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,344
-Yeah, but I thought...
-Dead people don't do that.

4
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,852
...it would be better to show
the last struggle for life.

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,684
We're running out of time here.
We really gotta get this.

6
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,285
I'm ready. I'm ready.

7
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,760
Action.

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,062
Oh, fuck!

9
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,736
-Something bit me!
-The CGl disk...

10
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,202
Hi, this is Ellie Parker. You...

11
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,013
Hello, this is Ellie.

Have a great day.

14
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,492
This is Ellie Parker.
This is Ellie Parker.

15
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,532
Leave a message for Ellie.

16
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,662
Hello, this is Ellie Parker.

17
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,529
Leave a message for Ellie, please.

18
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,969
Have a great day.
Good luck.

19
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,078
Hello, this is Ellie Parker.

20
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,455
Okay.

21
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:40,465
This is Ellie. I'd like you to leave
your name and your number...

22
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,000
and a short message. I'll call you
back as soon as I get in. Thank you.

23
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,036
Hello, hi.
Hi, this is Ellie.

24
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,839
Hi, this is Ellie Parker.
I'll call you right back.

25
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,679
This is Parker.

26
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:58,247
Hello, this is Ellie Parker.
Leave a message...

27
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,515
and your number.
Oh, my God.

28
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,585
Okay, go ahead.

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,162
Ellie.

30
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,100
-Hi!
-Hi. Come up.

31
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:23,475
-Hello.
-Hi. Nice to see you.

32
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,200
-Nice to see you.
-Are you ready?

33
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,039
Yeah. I mean, yes.

34
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,414
Just give me one second.

35
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,556
-Okay. Ready?
-Okay.

36
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,118
-Everyone, this is Ellie Parker.
-Hi.

37
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,851
This is Rick Saul, the producer.

38
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:47,329
Leslie Town, the writer.
And Smash, our director.

39
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,094
-I loved the script.
-Thank you. Very nice to meet you.

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,066
Very nice to meet you.

41
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,672
-So, get it started. Should we try?
-Sure.

42
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:07,777
We are only now doing the monologue,
not the first and second scenes.

43
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,788
Oh, okay.

44
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:15,928
So, you just lost your mom
and you're cursing God.

45
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,095
Do you have any questions?

46
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:23,564
No, I'm okay.
Do you have any answers?

47
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,899
Just really take this time
to put yourself in this place.

48
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:37,047
The air is humid.
There's black bugs in the tree.

49
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,842
The... What?

50
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,214
-Locusts?
-Locusts, chopping the...

51
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:49,689
You may be in front of the
old plantation house. It's...

52
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,298
I used to think about you
when he hurt me.

53
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,636
You weren't there.
You never were.

54
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,643
Things were so different then.

55
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,217
The bayou was open...

56
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,822
so free.

57
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:24,426
Sitting on that front porch I looked
into your eyes and stared for hours.

58
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,461
Let me just stop you for a sec.

59
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:32,001
You must remember I'm
taping this on digital video.

60
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,436
So it's very important
that you think very raw.

61
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,371
It's...

62
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:43,748
Just start again and think that
your acting must be very raw...

63
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,110
very...

64
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,919
Got it.

65
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,975
You weren't there.
You never were.

66
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,973
Things were so different then.

67
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,616
The bayou was open...

68
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,116
so free.

69
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:28,592
Sitting on that front porch,
I stared into your eyes for hours.

70
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,030
That terrible night...

71
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,203
when the storm ripped and
screamed through everything.

72
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:47,373
The abuse, the denial,
the redemption!

73
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,047
We shared it all.

74
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,346
You were my rock...

75
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,219
my salvation.

76
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:06,522
You... were me.

77
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,303
And now you're dead, you bitch!

78
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,010
I don't know
if it's possible to go on.

79
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:30,987
I do not will to stand!
Oh, God, damn you to hell!

80
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,385
Why? Why? Why?

81
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,660
Wow! That was wonderful.

82
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,373
Very good, excellent.
Very good.

83
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:53,568
Are you sure? I can try another way.
I mean, this is such a...

84
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,705
How tall are you?

85
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,317
I'm 5'7. This tall.

86
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,621
How tall is Mel?

87
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,323
About this height.

88
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,186
He wears his lifts in his shoes,
so no one will know.

89
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,127
All right, Ellie. That was great.
Thanks for coming.

90
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,562
Okay, thank you. It was nice
to meet you all.

91
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,534
-Thank you.
-I loved the script. It's great.

92
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,600
My keys.

93
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,637
-Bye.
-Bye.

94
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,706
-Was that okay?
-lt was great. It was really great.

95
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,645
I kind of wanted to do
those other scenes.

96
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,579
No, that was everything.
It was totally fine.

97
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,755
-They're really nice.
-Oh, yeah, they're great.

98
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,547
-The director. What was his name?
-Smash.

99
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,521
Cool. He seems interesting.

100
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,229
Well, you'll be hearing from us.
You know, we'll be in touch.

101
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,831
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks. Great to see you again.

102
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,035
-All right.
-All right, see you later.

103
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,540
'Sitting on that front porch,
I stared in your eyes...'

104
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,088
Let me in, fuckers!

105
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,294
Won't you mistrust
Love's gone behind

106
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,001
In between

107
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,412
Oh, fuck!

108
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:53,395
I sucked your cock! I sucked
Vinnie's cock! I sucked them all!

109
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,731
I fucked your cock, I sucked it.

110
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,794
I was there.
I was there.

111
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:06,011
It went okay? So what about
yesterday, did you get feedback?

112
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,276
Fucking tell them that I didn't
fucking respond to them either!

113
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,915
That fucking dick wad!

114
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,981
Hold on, can you?
Dennis, hold on.

115
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,553
Hello. Hi, honey. Where are you?

116
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,521
Baby, I'm just in the car,
driving, on the freeway.

117
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,592
I'm late to my second appointment.

118
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,060
'The Cruel City'. Fuck it,
I don't know what it's called.

119
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,961
It's a piece of shit anyway.

120
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,634
But it's a good part.

121
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,803
Dennis, hi.
Dennis, sorry, I completely forgot.

122
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,875
Maybe you could call and say
I'm gonna be 5 minutes late.

123
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,603
Listen, you know when they said
they didn't respond to me...

124
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,941
was that my look, was that...

125
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,847
what, performance?

126
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,113
All right, I'll call you after,
okay? All right, bye.

127
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,327
I just gotta be some junkie
fucking whore, like New York.

128
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,689
I sucked his cock, Vinnie's cock!
I sucked them all!

129
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,231
Does that accent sound all right?
I'm not good at the Brooklyn thing...

130
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,768
but I did this Southern belle thing
and I fucking nailed it. I was...

131
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:12,945
Don't make me tell you what I've
just been through, okay? 'Cause l...

132
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,807
Vinnie had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

133
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:21,611
Don't make me tell you... Don't make
me tell you what I've been through.

134
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,946
Fuck!

135
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,954
Don't make me tell you
what I've just been through.

136
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,388
Vinnie had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

137
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,225
No... Don't make me tell you
what I've just been through, okay?

138
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,732
'Cause Vinnie had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

139
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,131
Baby, l...

140
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:46,141
You said this before. We've gone
through this. We've gone through it.

141
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,116
What am I supposed to do?
Do you want me to pull over...

142
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,875
and just park and listen to you,
what you have to say...

143
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,386
while I'm on my way to a fucking
audition trying to earn some money?

144
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:04,424
I know. What do you expect me to do?
How can I not get emotional when...

145
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,056
Don't hang up on me! Don't!

146
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,996
Motherfucker!

147
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,408
Vinnie, I sucked your cock.

148
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,705
He had blood all over
his fucking shirt!

149
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,782
You try going from Avenue A to
Belford Stiverson in 1 0 minutes.

150
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,919
You try. You try it.

151
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,264
I sucked his cock.
I sucked his cock.

152
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,173
He had blood
all over his fucking shirt!

153
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,932
I sucked his cock. I sucked it good.

154
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,577
Fuck!.

155
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,658
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you doing? Sign in.

156
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,334
-Great.
-Can I get you some water or coffee?

157
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,129
If I have any coffee,
my head will explode.

158
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,999
Water's fine. Thanks.

159
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,473
Have a seat over here.
I'll get this mess.

160
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,315
-Joann will be right with you.
-Thanks a lot.

161
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,262
-Hi.
-Hi!

162
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,660
You look lovely.

163
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,597
-Thanks.
-Good to see you.

164
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,641
I won't kiss you cause I've got a
cold, I don't want you to catch it.

165
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,402
The director is in Vancouver, we're
going to put you on tape. That okay?

166
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,977
All right. Okay.

167
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:40,584
So you can just take a sit here.
And we'll tape you.

168
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,913
-Okay. So I'm reading with you?
-Yes.

169
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,522
-You get a chance to read the script?
-Yes, I did.

170
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,889
Can we...? Sorry, that light is
really bright. Can we...? Thanks.

171
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,259
-How's that?
-That's great.

172
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,693
Let's see what happens here.

173
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,266
I'm just getting my hair a little...

174
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,102
Do you have any questions?

175
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,104
No, I just... Does she love him
or she sort of...

176
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,934
I would say it's very much
a love-hate relationship.

177
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,011
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
I just wasn't like... sure.

178
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,149
I did this like weird hair
and make-up...

179
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,376
It looks great.
No, I really like it.

180
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,585
A junkie whore.

181
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,656
I should be talking in my American
accent, my New Yorker accent.

182
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,087
-Not right now. Once we go on tape.
-Okay.

183
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,027
-So, ready?
-Yeah. Is it okay if I stand?

184
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,896
Absolutely, I mean...
Trixie can move around and...

185
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:35,334
You do what you want.
Don't worry about it

186
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,935
You should stand up with her.
Trixie?

187
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,805
-I'm almost ready. Here we go.
-Lens cap.

188
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,071
Oh, right, here we go.

189
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,681
Ellie Parker.

190
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:50,749
Okay. I'm ready.

191
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,954
-Goddamn it, you were late!
-There wasn't time!

192
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,322
You try getting from Avenue A to
Belford Stiverson in 1 0 minutes!

193
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,061
You make time.

194
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,533
Don't make me tell you what
I've just been through, okay?

195
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,832
'Cause Vinnie came home with
blood all over his fucking shirt!

196
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:17,077
Don't care if there's blood coming out
of your twat. You fucking be there.

197
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,647
I was there!

198
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:24,083
I sucked his cock, Vinnie's cock,
I sucked your fucking flacid cock!

199
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,084
You were doped up beyond belief,
do you remember?

200
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:36,764
You know the arrangement, you were
late. We're having dinner at Luigi's.

201
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,401
I ain't hungry.

202
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,167
You wouldn't be, you junkie whore.

203
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,344
-That was lovely.
-Are you sure?

204
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,881
We could try it another way,
I mean...

205
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,780
Not for me. Unless you want to.
It was perfect.

206
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,490
In my point of view,
you just nailed it.

207
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,559
Really? Okay. Excellent.
All right, good.

208
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,065
-So, it was nice to see you.
-Well, it was great to see you.

209
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,336
It'd be great to meet the director,
if you think... I love the script.

210
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,538
-You wrote it, right?
-Yeah.

211
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:17,731
Yeah, it's good.
Okay, all right.

212
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,140
That's it for another day.
Okay, have fun.

213
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,440
-You too.
-Bye.

214
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,915
-We'll get back to you the weekend.
-Okay. I'd love to meet the director.

215
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,315
I know. He's really sorry
he couldn't be here.

216
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,288
All right, see you later. Bye.

217
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,637
Sir, I think it's obviously
quite deliberate.

218
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,350
It was the intention of the artist.

219
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,519
The show is called
'Peripheral Perspectives'.

220
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,651
It's supposed to be out of focus.

221
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,658
How could've it gone out of focus
once you got it home?

222
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,661
Would you mind just holding for me
for a minute, please? Dumb fuck!

223
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,001
Oh, darling. Bad day?

224
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:29,310
Look at you.
Come here.

225
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,183
You're going to be fired if you keep
calling people 'stupid fucks'.

226
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,856
I hope I get fired so I can just
dedicate myself to my acting.

227
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,189
What's going on?

228
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,024
I don't know who I am.

229
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:27,100
Nobody knows what they are.
Maybe what you do is who you are.

230
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,438
But I don't know what I'm doing!

231
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,240
Maybe I don't know who I am or...

232
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,680
what I'm doing.

233
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,656
I don't know how anyone
can have a sense of self in this...

234
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,455
fractured modern time
of mediate...

235
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,759
tiranized, fascist, body-obsessed...

236
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:02,200
global domination,
political turmoil, human...

237
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,706
-Okay, Sam.
-...this time of human depravity...

238
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,071
Sam, okay, okay, okay, stop.

239
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,451
Are you okay?

240
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,482
Yeah.

241
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,451
-What the fuck is that?
-Don't even try to understand it.

242
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,887
It's pretty sophisticated piece.

243
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,796
-Go fuck yourself.
-What if I could.

244
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:31,597
Oh, God, I got another audition.

245
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,531
What for?

246
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,037
I don't know, some WB show.

247
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,342
'Undercover Gimnasts'.

248
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,438
Love you.

249
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,507
Well, why aren't l
going out on that?

250
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,498
Thank you!

251
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,743
We want you
lfyour lover's cold

252
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,261
Hey, baby, I didn't know
that you were home.

253
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:43,135
I wasn't. Did you notice that?

254
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,243
I like your hair. I like that.

255
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:54,552
I like the radiating things, and
the antennas, and the butterflies.

256
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,114
That's really nice, I like that.

257
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:00,491
Pink and blue. It's like male/female.
Are you alright?

258
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,360
What?

259
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,257
What did I say? I liked it.
I didn't say I didn't like it.

260
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,416
What?

261
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,580
What's the matter?

262
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,345
Are you mad at me or something?
You wanna talk about it?

263
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,187
I think you broke
my nose here. Hello?

264
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,689
-Come on, man?
-No! You come on, Justin!

265
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:45,664
-'You come on'.
-You're a fucking wanker!

266
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,538
I'm a fucking wanker.

267
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,507
I'm kidding. What are you
so pissed off about?

268
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,015
Come on, don't you wanna play?

269
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,921
Fuck!

270
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,017
Come on!

271
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,297
Man, I came up with this
great song. I just finished it.

272
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,663
It's really cool.

273
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,699
It's like this... Got this
Lynyrd Skynyrd vibe...

274
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:30,271
but I threw a little of Darby Crash,
from the Germs in...

275
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,534
and a little bit of like...

276
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,475
There's some Zeppelin, and there's
a little bit of lggy Pop vibe going.

277
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,706
It kind of goes like this...

278
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,217
Simple pause.

279
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,890
Isn't that fucking cool?
I love that.

280
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,563
I think it can really work,
you know.

281
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,200
Maybe you can help me come up with
another thing, another riff, like:

282
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,302
'l love you' or 'hate you',
whatever...

283
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,167
'cause, you know,
love is about hate too, right?

284
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,569
-It's good, it's good.
-I think so too.

285
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,644
I think I don't want to be
in this relationship anymore.

286
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,450
No, I'm sure I don't wanna be.

287
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,216
But I don't wanna be alone.

288
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,358
I feel suffocated.

289
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,632
What is suffocating you?

290
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,941
This city.

291
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:42,340
It's that I feel like...

292
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:48,076
I'm waiting for my life
to start, you know?

293
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:56,892
Like what's going on now
is all just like a big rehearsal...

294
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,857
for something bigger.

295
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:01,895
It's all temporary. It's just...

296
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:08,396
Maybe I'm scared to start my life.

297
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,275
Are you the part of Ellie that's
scared to let her start her life?

298
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:22,179
I wore dirty clothes...

299
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,918
and then I smelled...

300
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,686
and because they said...

301
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,526
I looked like a kangaroo.

302
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:38,562
Thank you for talking to me today.

303
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,601
We'll talk to you again soon, okay?

304
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,905
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

305
00:25:55,587 --> 00:26:00,081
And I was always on the outside,
always trying to fit in, always...

306
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,385
trying to be accepted, to be
liked and pleasing people.

307
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,119
That's what happens
as an actor in the rooms.

308
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,094
You go into these rooms and...

309
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,663
you audition and you have
to show yourself and...

310
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,535
these people don't like you
and it's like you can't...

311
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,375
you can't be yourself because
you're always being judged.

312
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:31,480
I wish I could be brave enough
to do that in the audition room.

313
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,293
Fuck!

314
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,838
Ellie, you have some mascara...

315
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,570
-Here?
Both eyes.

316
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:58,305
That would've been strange walking
into my next audition...

317
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,382
Iike that.

318
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,487
Oh, God, I hadn't let go
like that in a long time.

319
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,454
-It's good for you.
-lt is. It feels good.

320
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,654
So...

321
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,299
...thank you. It was really good.
-You're welcome.

322
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,332
-I like your sweater.
-Oh, thank you.

323
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:23,570
-It's nice. Where did you get it?
-At Limited.

324
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,139
All right. Oh, good, good.
How much was it?

325
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,747
Oh, gosh... 29 dollars.

326
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,281
That's great. I might just...
Was it just recently?

327
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:40,048
'Cause I've been looking
for a nice cheap sweater that...

328
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,454
You know, a plain black sweater.

329
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,327
So, Wednesday?

330
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,551
-Thank you.
-Anything else?

331
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,361
-That's great.
-Oh, no.

332
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,625
Oh, my God, I'm gonna cum.

333
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,461
Oh, my God!

334
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,003
Oh, God, yeah, like that.

335
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,077
Gosh, like that.

336
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,653
Oh, God. Ellie!

337
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:36,359
Hey, you motherfucker!

338
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,861
Hey, baby.

339
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,702
I tried to call your new cell phone.

340
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,909
Were there any calls for me?

341
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,775
No, no, not one.

342
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,613
Ellie...

343
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,256
Yikes!

344
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,086
You fucking asshole!

345
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,889
-Oh, my God!
-Ellie, wait!

346
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,329
Fuck!

347
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,198
Wait!

348
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,509
Fuck! Fucking...

349
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,251
No, no, no!

350
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,894
Oh, God.

351
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,196
Asshole. Fucking asshole.

352
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,741
I just fucking hit somebody.

353
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,249
-I just...
-You're fucking crazy?

354
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:05,513
-Look at my fucking car!
-I'll call you back.

355
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,022
Oh, my God, look at my car!
What do you...? You're fucking crazy?

356
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,285
-I just hit somebody.
-Can you get off that phone?

357
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:15,260
Fucking hell, I'm really sorry.
I didn't see you, I was on my phone.

358
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,991
You shouldn't fucking drive
while you're talking on the cell.

359
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:22,866
If you wanna talk, go home.
Don't drive and talk on the phone.

360
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,301
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,878
-Do you have pen and paper?
-You have blue stuff on your face.

362
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,814
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

363
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:38,079
Let me just back up.
I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving.

364
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,956
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I've got your number plate.

365
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:46,056
-Do not drive away.
-I promise I won't drive away.

366
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,697
-Wow, my car is fine, so...
-Well, that makes sense.

367
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,968
You wanna try to maybe snap this
back on? Try to drive home.

368
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:00,200
It won't touch here. I'll get...

369
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,190
-Wow, what are these things?
-It's very expensive that dress.

370
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,591
These are my pills, they are
homeopathic, they're for...

371
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,789
healing...

372
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,168
-You're an actress?
-Yes.

373
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,964
-I like your picture.
-Thanks.

374
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,474
I'm incredibly sorry.
I'm really sorry.

375
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:43,251
Don't worry. Don't worry
about this. It's fine, it's cool.

376
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,819
I'll give you my phone number...

377
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,048
Okay, I can't give you my phone
number, but if you give me yours...

378
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,692
-I'll give you mine and...
-I got your license plate...

379
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:54,227
and I'd like your
driver's license number.

380
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,895
-Okay, cool.
-Okay.

381
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,365
-So...
-I'm really sorry.

382
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,400
-I'll give you my phone number.
-Okay, great.

383
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,673
Make sure when you call
say it's about the car accident.

384
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,375
Okay. Are you under
house arrest or something?

385
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,241
No, I'm just...

386
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:15,009
I'm breaking up with
my boyfriend. It's just...

387
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,652
-What did you say you do?
-You didn't ask me.

388
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,188
-Sorry. You asked me.
-I'm a cinematographer.

389
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,553
Oh, really? In films?

390
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,855
No, I want to. I'm shooting
commercials right now.

391
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,431
-Oh, nice.
-But I'd like to shoot films.

392
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,069
Sometimes cinematographers
turn into filmmakers, don't they?

393
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,432
Yeah. There are a lot of people...

394
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,073
who were cinematographers
and now they're filmmakers.

395
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,610
If you wanna do any kind
of experimental ideas...

396
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:48,012
or whatever, shoot it, just
make a short film, I'd love to.

397
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,947
-Really? That's great.
-I'm gonna give you my head shot.

398
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:51,621
Oh, great.

399
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,588
-You look better.
-Well, then don't take this.

400
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,790
Here's the bit with my agent's
number, keep that. Is it an eye?

401
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,262
Can I have an eye? Oh, I like
this part, that's really nice.

402
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,231
-You could do that...
-That's good. But I still...

403
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:38,486
You know, you're welcome
to stay for as long as you need to.

404
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,560
Thanks.

405
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:45,758
At least you won't have to listen
to those stupid songs anymore.

406
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,238
Or have to watch him play guitar.

407
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,235
-That's awful.
-It's like watch him masturbate.

408
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:05,484
That's so beautiful.

409
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:15,358
God, I just wish I could disappear
into some great role, you know?

410
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,535
Not just a cop, or a lawyer,
or a girlfriend.

411
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,500
I wanna play a real person,
you know?

412
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:27,443
God, it's so dry out there.
We really need some rain.

413
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:32,706
You know what would be great?
To play a schizophrenic woman.

414
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:38,553
A blind lesbian anthropologist.

415
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,951
Yeah, yeah. It's the 1 700's, and
she's got dengue fever, and she's...

416
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:49,963
studying baboons.
Wouldn't that be good?

417
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:54,163
-lf I should I hire a lawyer?
-Maybe...

418
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,838
-What's that fucking noise?
-Don't know. Someone should shoot.

419
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,942
I feel like Humpty Dumpty.

420
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,611
Maybe I should hire a publicist.

421
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,587
Maybe I should set myself on fire.

422
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,152
Who?

423
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,555
-Where are you?
-I'm sorry.

424
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,127
You know, I think I'm a little
hypoglycemic. Look at me, shaking.

425
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,598
I need some food, quickly.
I haven't eaten for like 2 hours.

426
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,203
Come on, let's go.

427
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,855
Listen.

428
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,619
-Listen.
-I think it's Justin.

429
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,788
Fuck, Ellie!

430
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,427
-Hi. Let me in.
-No!

431
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,159
-Go away!
-You said you loved me.

432
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,133
-What?
-You said you loved me.

433
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,072
Fuck you! I don't hate
myself enough to love you!

434
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,376
I hate you.
I'm fucking trying to sleep.

435
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,511
Fuck you!

436
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,750
Cock breath, I don't know what kind
of soap opera you think you're in...

437
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,818
Fuck off, you fucking cow.
How's that?

438
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,620
Fuck me? Fuck me?
Fuck you!

439
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,620
Justin. Sam! Honey...

440
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,760
Go, she's coming!
She's coming!

441
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,890
Fuck.

442
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,903
How dare you come here
after what you've done to her...

443
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:13,406
and how dare you call me a cow?
Fuck off!

444
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:14,770
-Fuck off!
-Don't hurt him!

445
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,810
-Get in!
-Are you all right, Justin?

446
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,983
-He has a violent history.
-All right.

447
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,291
I want my green shirt back.

448
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,172
That's good.

449
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,180
He was retarding you, Ellie,
and this...

450
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,582
He was this fucking... It'll be good
for you to stay alone for a while.

451
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:04,090
No, no, no. I'm gonna go
insane if I'm alone.

452
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:07,661
I just wanna be in a relationship
where I can be myself, you know?

453
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:11,629
I don't have to be what I think
the man wants me to be.

454
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:18,174
We live in a place where everyone
is pretending to be someone else.

455
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:23,580
What happens when you start becoming
the person you're pretending to be?

456
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:29,614
Well, I think you become???
the person that wears mini skirts.

457
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,878
That's... I like that.

458
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,820
You know, the thing is it's gonna
be good for your work, Ellie.

459
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,359
This shit informs it, you know that.

460
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,566
Once you get passed it, think about
what it will bring to the roles.

461
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,258
And probably you'll get
better roles from it.

462
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,496
-Don't you think?
-Yeah, you could be right.

463
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,867
Right.

464
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,170
I've got a couple of good rolls.

465
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,176
I wouldn't complain
about those rolls.

466
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,713
What about that roll?
That's one great roll.

467
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,012
Isn't it?
That's a roll I'll never get.

468
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:12,185
No, you'll just get stuck
with old big parts.

469
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:17,964
This is what it must feel like to
have a cock. I wish I had a cock.

470
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,033
Why? That's so unfair!

471
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,240
That's so 70's of you.

472
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:30,473
Remember when the future
was a promise?

473
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,880
Now it's like a threat.

474
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,391
You think I look old?

475
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,357
Don't be ridiculous.

476
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,927
I don't wanna die.

477
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,329
What are you saying?

478
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,433
What are you saying?

479
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,871
What if, what if l... I...

480
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:04,270
dropped dead? What if
I had cancer? What if l...

481
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,346
had an aneurism? What if?

482
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,816
I would be so sad if you died.
I would go to your funeral.

483
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,579
-You do?
-I'd get a new dress.

484
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,792
I'd pound your coffin
and try to scream:

485
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,961
'Get up! Get up!
Give me one last hug!'

486
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,029
-You're making like it's a scene.
-No, I'm just serious.

487
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,496
I don't want a scene. I'm serious.

488
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:28,068
No, I love you, darling.
I love you.

489
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,870
I love you.
You're my best friend.

490
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:39,777
Now just picture you're in a big
bathtub filled with Jell-O right now.

491
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,351
Orange Jell-O.

492
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:48,815
Let every part of yourself
just sink into the floor.

493
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,393
Let go of your Hollywood crap...

494
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:59,067
trying to be Gwyneth Paltrow
or Brad Pitt...

495
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:05,399
your agents,
your casting directors.

496
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,310
Just let them all go up
into a big ball of fire.

497
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:15,084
Okay, now I want you to ask your
creative source to give you an event.

498
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:18,687
An event when
you were 1 0 years-old.

499
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:23,784
You can go right into that event,
as if you were in a time machine.

500
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,928
Really be there.

501
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,092
Good, Ellie.
Let go of the tension on your face.

502
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:34,862
This is not a therapy session.
This is acting.

503
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,150
Good, you're 9 years-old, vomiting.

504
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,184
There's no one there to help you.

505
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,158
Let it all relax.

506
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,363
Look at me.

507
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,723
Lesbian.

508
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,728
-Go!
-Lesbian! Lesbian! Lesbian!

509
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,701
-Good.
-It's not appropriate!

510
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,599
-It's not appropriate!
-Good.

511
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:18,378
And just say like a little scream
into your pillow. A little scream.

512
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:25,117
My little brother was standing there
with one of my Barbies in his hand.

513
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,754
And her hair was on fire.
Stop it, Toby!

514
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,552
And he was burning my curtains.

515
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,456
Beautiful.

516
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,093
That was beautiful.

517
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,534
Then we sit down at the dining
room table, like she tells us to.

518
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:48,074
And she brings
these huge plates. Plates...

519
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:52,146
pilled high: steak, chips...

520
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,818
carrots, peas, like this
enormous amount of food.

521
00:45:56,053 --> 00:46:00,251
And we're like: 'Mom, what are you
doing? What are you doing? No!'

522
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:04,018
And she's like force-feeding us,
putting it in our mouth.

523
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,185
Good, take it and
put it in your mouth.,

524
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,625
'You eat it, girls!
You eat! You must eat!'

525
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:12,825
Take a big handful.
The other handful. Another handful.

526
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:17,404
Good. Big peas.
Spit out the peas. Good.

527
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,269
-And when l...
-Take the peas back, off the plate...

528
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,638
stuff them in and spit them out.

529
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,048
Ellie, don't hold back.
Spit them out.

530
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:31,177
Mush the food. Keep mushing.
Turn that fucking cell phone off.

531
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,654
Is it? Mush it!

532
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:40,328
And we would say: 'Mom, mom,
no, we already had dinner!'

533
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:45,994
We had dinner tonight.
Don't you remember?'

534
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,399
Nice.

535
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,132
Now, get up.
Don't get indulgent.

536
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:55,242
Gesture.

537
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,477
Good, again.

538
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:04,210
Ellie, quiet.
Do the opposite. Opposite.

539
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,615
Good, good.

540
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,382
And now the opposite of that.
Go! Angry!

541
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,157
Give me a hug.

542
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,626
Very good.

543
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,391
Yeah, Ellie!

544
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:22,138
Okay, lastly, we're all gonna
work at animals for about 5 minutes.

545
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,311
A kangaroo. Let's see you hop,
shake your butt.

546
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,252
I'll be right back.

547
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,462
You think Meryl Streep
had to do this shit?

548
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,651
You look very preoccupied.

549
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,018
I'm fine.

550
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,352
You're still there.
What's the matter?

551
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:21,359
Are you bummed
he didn't offer you a line?

552
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:26,562
Everyone had these big
personal events. Mine was lame.

553
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,668
I'm an idiot.

554
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,770
That's ridiculous, Ellie.
You were very, very good today.

555
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:38,710
Easy for you to say.
Yours was huge.

556
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,077
You burned your house down
with your brother.

557
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,583
You never even told me that.

558
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,989
No wonder you're such
a good actress.

559
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:53,629
You have all this shit in your life
that you can just draw off from.

560
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,490
It's deep.

561
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,429
And I'm just like
this shallow bird bath.

562
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,269
-I made it up.
-What?

563
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,674
I made it up, my personal event.

564
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,170
You made up your personal event?

565
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:16,381
Come on, Ellie! You know I like to
practice my American accent in class.

566
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,012
Sometimes I make things up
so I can practice my acting!

567
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:23,417
What's the point? It defeats the
purpose. The whole point is to...

568
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,619
use something that really happened in
your life and put it in your acting.

569
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:33,564
Oh, bullshit. I think the
whole method thing is a wank.

570
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:37,136
I think sense memory
is so self-indulgent.

571
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:42,175
No, see, it's not. You draw
from your life experience...

572
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,346
and you personalize it and put it
into your work. It makes it real...

573
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,641
and it makes it honest.

574
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,977
And that's how
you make a scene work.

575
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,485
Bullshit, Ellie! Sorry!

576
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:59,526
How many times are you gonna cry
about your drunk mother? It's boring!

577
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,666
It's far more real, truthful and
honest if you use your imagination.

578
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,199
And it's limitless.

579
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:15,176
Okay. Let's try something.

580
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,647
Let's put your theory to test.

581
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,076
Let's see who can cry first.

582
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,288
-On the count of three.
-All right.

583
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,559
One, two...

584
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,792
three.

585
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,871
I'm starting to get one.

586
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,842
It's not real. It's crocodile.

587
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,953
Yeah, it is. It's real, right now.
It's gonna spill out in a second.

588
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,283
-You're not crying.
-Yeah, one on the left eye.

589
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:14,530
You see, that's dignifying 'cause l
don't have to use any loud whaling...

590
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,563
and it looks like I'm holding back.

591
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:23,078
-My nose is going too.
-I'm drawing from my own pain.

592
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:27,716
You don't understand, see? Look
at this. You think that's faking it?

593
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,050
I think that gets
a little embarrassing.

594
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:35,589
It's dignifying about holding back
and letting one just spill out...

595
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,226
gently. It's something real, Ellie!

596
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,657
You don't understand.

597
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,264
That shop! You see that shop?

598
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,298
-I wanna go there.
-What?

599
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,403
I wanted to go there for so long.
I'm so glad that that's there.

600
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,698
-Oh, hang on. What...
-Hang on, I can't park here.

601
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,569
I didn't bring my wallet.

602
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,359
Oh, I need a set of tea trays.

603
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,332
-I'll be right out!
-It's okay, we're fine.

604
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,666
Just looking around.

605
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:30,637
I hear Australians.

606
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,345
You guys are everywhere.

607
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,879
If he says 'good day',
I'll kill him.

608
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,520
Good day.

609
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:42,186
-May I help you?
-Oh, my God, hi!

610
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:47,488
-I didn't realize you worked here.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

611
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,596
Hi, how are you?

612
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,834
-I'm good, how are you?
-I'm good.

613
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,169
My car is gonna be fixed
by the end of the day.

614
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:03,001
And I have a dentist
appointment on Thursday.

615
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:09,815
Sam, this is Chris. Chris, right.
He crashed into me last week.

616
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,322
No, no, I'm Tom,
I'm Chris's twin brother.

617
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:18,119
And he look really crashed into.
I heard about you.

618
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,157
Wait.

619
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,056
Funny.

620
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,758
No, I really am Tom,
his twin brother.

621
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,530
Happens all the time. People think
we're the same person, but we're not.

622
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,339
We have different hair.

623
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:36,910
And he drives a Honda Civic, and
I don't drive because I'm epileptic.

624
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,044
So...

625
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:42,013
-Oh, my God.
-What?

626
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:47,250
Wow, you guys look a lot alike.

627
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:52,124
-Yeah. So, how is your car?
-It's good, it's getting fixed.

628
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:56,329
You paid... No, your brother paid
for it, and it will be fixed.

629
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,464
I know he felt real bad about
what happened and...

630
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,837
He's a terrible driver, just awful.
He's always banging into stuff.

631
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:07,009
I'm a better driver than he is
and I don't drive, I'm epileptic.

632
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,610
But it's good to meet you.
I'll tell him I saw you.

633
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,973
-Yes, yes, say hi.
-Sure. It's weird.

634
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,274
-I know, it's weird.
-Yeah, he really...

635
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,486
-I have to go, I got that thing.
-What thing?

636
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:26,188
Sorry, we should go.
She's got a thing, so...

637
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,897
-Well, good luck on your thing.
-Thanks.

638
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,967
-Bye.
-Bye.

639
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,240
Oh, my God!

640
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,145
Shit! Shit!

641
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:53,186
Hi, I'm sorry, I just...
I am Chris, I lied.

642
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,357
I'm sorry. I was embarrassed because
I told you I was a cinematographer.

643
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:01,052
I'm really embarrassed. You busted
me where I work and I feel really...

644
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,495
I'm really ashamed of myself,
I'm really sorry. I just...

645
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,361
I didn't want you to get away.

646
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,696
-Are you an epileptic?
-No, I lied about that too.

647
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,872
-Oh, no!
-Wait, wait!

648
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,632
-Wait!
-I just...

649
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:17,813
I go to AFl and I'm going to be
a cinematographer. And I'm just...

650
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,813
I'm really sorry.
I really like you and...

651
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:26,455
Okay, don't worry.
You're crazy, but it's okay.

652
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,817
I feel really bad.
Can I make it up to you?

653
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,586
Listen, my band's playing tonight.
Well, my friends' band, Dogstart.

654
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,730
They're really good. And l'd
love it if you went with me.

655
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:40,063
-Okay.
-You too. You both can come.

656
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:46,264
So, I have your number. I'll call you
when I get out. It could be great.

657
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,910
She's a very popular girl, you know
that. You're luck she's available.

658
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,637
-Thank you, Sam.
-Really, very.

659
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,110
Bye!

660
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,520
Just your type. Sociopath.

661
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,069
Oh, my God, this is really fake.

662
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,051
3 Vicodin just doesn't do it
for me anymore. At least not orally.

663
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:40,922
Really? Have you tried Norco?

664
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,759
-Were you just talking about Vicodin?
-Pretty good. Yeah.

665
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,060
I love Vicodin.
I'm like Marilyn Monroe.

666
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,635
-Really?
-Oh, my God, wait! Acting class!

667
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,342
-Right.
-What are you doing here?

668
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:57,611
-Of course I'm here.
-Yeah, right. I love your glitter.

669
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:03,214
-It's what drag queens wear?
-Can I have another vodka?

670
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,586
Hey, you guys were great tonight.
That was really cool. How you doing?

671
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,384
-This is my friend Ellie.
-Hi, hi.

672
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:15,223
-And this is Sam.
-That was so great. Really good.

673
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,955
-One second.
-Are you in the band?

674
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,068
-He's in the band too.
-You're in. Nice to meet you.

675
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:26,173
You know what's really funny? So many
people who want to say hello to you.

676
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:30,004
-Yeah? From where?
-Sydney, from the Matrix.

677
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,806
-So many, so many people.
-We're Australian.

678
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,381
-Come with me, please.
-Yeah, sure.

679
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,745
What's up?

680
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,015
-Who?
-I'm so glad you took him out.

681
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:46,092
-Anyway, the concept was fantastic.
-So good. How did you get in acting?

682
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,058
What? What?

683
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,593
What are you doing?

684
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:55,197
You're really, really drunk
and you're embarrassing yourself.

685
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:58,100
-What are you talking about?
-You don't... What are you smoking?

686
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,866
Listen, did you take something.

687
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:07,212
-Don't laugh at me. Did you?
-Yes.

688
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,917
-What did you take?
-Vicodin.

689
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:14,419
I knew you did. You took it out
of my medicine cabinet, didn't you?

690
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,649
Ellie, did you take
a Vicodin out of my...

691
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,454
-You know, I had four there...
-Just loosen up.

692
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:24,098
...that I had been saving.
That's just entitlement.

693
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,562
Oh, my God!

694
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,503
I think Keanu likes me.

695
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:34,268
-You're just transparent.
-I'm sorry.

696
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,206
Obvious.

697
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:45,017
Ellie? Ellie Parker?

698
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,423
Ellie, hey... Give me one minute.

699
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:49,989
-Fuck you!
-No, wait. Wait, come on.

700
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,559
Let me talk to you
about this, please. No, please.

701
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,923
-Rot in hell!
-Ellie, give me a minute!

702
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:00,499
You have a callback. I've been
trying to get in touch with you.

703
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,934
-Don't fuck with me.
-I'm not. It's for 'Delta Breeze'.

704
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:08,007
They really wanna see you on this.
You have a really good shot.

705
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,905
-Wait.
-It's on Friday.

706
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:12,842
-Hello?
-Ellie.

707
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:16,449
-Sam!
-Excuse me. Ellie, Friday!

708
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:20,122
-Oh, my God, where are you?
-I have a ride home.

709
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,089
Which one?

710
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,787
Yeah, all right, bye.

711
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:29,862
-Sam, wait. Slut!
-Hi, sorry. I was looking for you.

712
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:35,799
They kicked me out. I know the guys
and they kicked me out of the place.

713
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,667
This gorilla just grabbed me
and like threw me out.

714
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,706
-I told him I've known them for...
-I lost you, I'm sorry.

715
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,408
You okay? Can I give you
a ride home or something?

716
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:50,415
-No. I just wanna sit here.
-Okay.

717
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,120
-You wanna keep drinking?
-Yeah!

718
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,294
-Wait, can you drive?
-Well, I'm too drunk to walk.

719
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,153
Oh, for a muse of fire...

720
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:33,089
that would ascend
the brightest sky of invention.

721
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:35,456
A kingdom for a stage.

722
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:38,360
A princess to act...

723
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:43,265
and monarchs to behold
this welling scene.

724
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,532
Slut!

725
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:27,021
Well, look what the cat dragged in.

726
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:29,228
What are you auditioning for?

727
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:33,629
'Straight Shooters',
new cop show on Fox!

728
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,831
I didn't get to go on that.

729
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:40,474
Yeah, well, I don't think
you're right for it.

730
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,372
What part is it?

731
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:48,648
Jamie, ex-playmate, now cop.

732
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:53,083
Jamie joined the LAPD because her
daddy was killed in the line of duty!

733
01:04:54,023 --> 01:05:00,428
Jamie's extreme beauty betrays
her will power and feline ambition!

734
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:04,460
Men on the force soon realize she is
a force to be reckoned with...

735
01:05:04,701 --> 01:05:09,195
after she out shoots them all
in a downtown bank robbery.

736
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:12,768
Right?

737
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:15,001
Where's your gun?

738
01:05:16,179 --> 01:05:18,545
Fuck, I don't have a gun!

739
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:21,675
Shit, I need a gun.

740
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:23,319
Good luck.

741
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:26,249
I wanna hear all about last night.
Help yourself to a donut.

742
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,514
I was getting in character.

743
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:33,719
Ellie, I need you to take out
the garbage, like, even once.

744
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:54,715
Girl, no. It's serious,
I'm not lying. He is gay.

745
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:59,415
I know. I know it's so crazy.
Hang on.

746
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,650
-Can you just tell Dennis I'm here?
-Yeah, what's your name?

747
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:05,790
-Ellie Parker.
-Hold on. Virtual Management.

748
01:06:06,029 --> 01:06:07,291
Forget it.

749
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,122
Wait!

750
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:13,226
Excuse me. Excuse me!

751
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:17,137
Miss? Excuse me, miss,
you cannot just walk back here!

752
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:21,776
My name is not 'miss'. Ellie Parker,
and you should know that by now.

753
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,273
Say it.

754
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:25,208
Say my name.

755
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:27,380
-Say it.
-Ellie Parker.

756
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,880
-Hi.
-Why don't we calm down?

757
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:40,061
Come into my office.
Sit, sit.

758
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,626
What is going on with you, I mean...

759
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:50,498
Bursting in here
like a big drama queen.

760
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:54,175
If you were only that good
in your auditions.

761
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,773
I quit.

762
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,112
I quit.

763
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,355
I can't do this anymore, Dennis.

764
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,421
No, I honestly cannot remember...

765
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:18,065
the reasons I wanted to become
an actress in the first place.

766
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:23,404
I used to dream
about being an artist...

767
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:29,334
and enlightening the human
condition, and now this is...

768
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:32,980
It's all a... It's a big...
You know?

769
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:42,119
Ellie, everyone on the team here...

770
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,657
is trying their best
to keep you working.

771
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,361
I don't think
there's any disagreement...

772
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,298
of what an extraordinary
actress you are.

773
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:00,768
People wanna hire confidence.

774
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:06,380
You know,
when you walk in that room...

775
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:11,986
they don't wanna know
about vulnerability or desperation.

776
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:15,486
You know, it just makes them
uncomfortable, that's all.

777
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,489
Did someone say something?

778
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:23,996
No, I just think it's good karma
for us to talk honestly.

779
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:32,607
I think your spirit's been broken
a little bit, and they sense that.

780
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,478
It only reminds them
of their own weaknesses.

781
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,947
Yeah, well, I don't give
a shit anymore.

782
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,119
I don't.

783
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,756
What about that 'Cruel City'?
Did I get a callback on that?

784
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:59,734
Oh, they wanted a name.

785
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:01,233
Who?

786
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,896
-Leslie Bibb.
-Who the fuck is Leslie Bibb?

787
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,368
Who is that?

788
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,043
-You're being hostile.
-I'm bitter too!

789
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,044
You said I'm a good actress.
What is so wrong with me?

790
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:17,252
-What makes me unhirable?
-You're brilliant!

791
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:21,888
You know what?
I want all my head shots...

792
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,219
my compilation tapes,
anything else you might have of mine.

793
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:29,921
Pack it up. I'm done, Dennis.
I'm through!

794
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:35,970
Ellie, I really think you ought
to think about this, I mean...

795
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:40,471
one doesn't make such a big decision
because they had a bad day.

796
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,611
I thought about it a lot, actually.

797
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:47,808
And it is the hardest decision
I ever had to make.

798
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:52,483
Apart from have
or not have an abortion.

799
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,926
Rainbow, I want you to get a box...

800
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:07,295
and collect all of Ellie Parker's
head shots and all of her videotapes.

801
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:13,703
Put them in the box, bring
in the box, hold my calls. Bye.

802
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:18,476
That's it? You're not even going
to try to talk me out of it?

803
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,343
Come on, Dennis,
you can try, you know? I...

804
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:29,280
I cannot interfere in
other people's destiny. I can't.

805
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:47,673
Are you okay?

806
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,708
Vanessa left me.

807
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:54,280
Oh, my God, Dennis!

808
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,051
Sorry.

809
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:00,851
What happened?

810
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,459
Well, she caught me
fucking around on her.

811
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,557
Oh, my God!

812
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:13,166
I don't mean to laugh, l...

813
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,133
I hope you're okay.

814
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:32,487
Thank you. For trying.

815
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:40,187
You look good.

816
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,327
-Really?
-Yeah.

817
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,297
Suspiciously good.

818
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:57,877
Have you had some work done?

819
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,677
-You have, haven't you?
-A tiny, tiny bit.

820
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:07,356
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Dennis!
Let me see!

821
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:11,483
I'm only telling you this 'cause
you're not my client anymore!

822
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:21,698
Good work.

823
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:38,049
Good luck in whatever
you decide to do, Ellie Parker.

824
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,501
Bye, Ellie.

825
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:34,594
Yes, this is your baby, Sebastian.

826
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:39,608
You know how I know it's yours?
Because it's a cancer!

827
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:45,747
It's a like a tumor growing inside
of me! I want it out of me!

828
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:52,342
No, you look at me!
You look at me now!

829
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:58,821
Do you understand?
Please, get away!

830
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:09,897
"The Tides of Passion "
will return after these messages.

831
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:57,952
I know this is out of the blue, but
I just have been thinking about you.

832
01:15:58,821 --> 01:16:01,346
I just feel it's too long
since we've spoken.

833
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,549
There's some changes going on and...
Anyway, I'm just trying to connect.

834
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,261
Pick up!

835
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,726
I've been really busy and...

836
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:13,457
not been able to catch up with
any friends and now it's the time.

837
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:17,069
I owe you so many phone calls
and I know...

838
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:23,204
you're wondering why I'm calling,
but I really wanna speak to you.

839
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:28,178
I want to tell you everything
that's going on and...

840
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,681
see how you're doing...

841
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,683
see if you're all right.

842
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:37,325
I know some great things have
been happening to you, and I just...

843
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,660
I broke up with Justin and...

844
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:50,201
Anyway, please, can you call me?
I really would like to speak to you.

845
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:56,844
I'm really, really sorry
I haven't called. I don't know.

846
01:16:57,079 --> 01:17:00,173
Can you call me, please, Sally?

847
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,510
Hi, Sally, it's me again.
I'm so sorry.

848
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:09,019
You must think I'm a total freak.
I don't know what came over me!

849
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,819
But I'm really fine.
It would be good to see you.

850
01:17:13,062 --> 01:17:16,998
I hope all is going well. I just
wanna, you know, meet the baby...

851
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:21,795
and see how things are going.

852
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,528
Wow, he must be
getting big now, Luke.

853
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:29,036
Luke or was it Luce? Luce...

854
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:35,410
I don't know if it was an old message
or something, but anyway...

855
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,676
I'm returning your call.

856
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,403
Fuck!

857
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,987
Hi, it's Ellie. How are you?

858
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:52,557
Look, I was wondering
what are you doing.

859
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:57,789
Do you... Do you have any time
lately, 'cause I'm free and...

860
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,661
and if you wanted to come over.

861
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:06,302
I... I... Yeah, sure, now?
Now now?

862
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:08,208
Hold on.

863
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:11,802
-Hi, how are you?
-Good, how are you?

864
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:14,208
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

865
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,044
Double kiss. Hey, I'm sorry
about the other night.

866
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:19,311
No, no, it's fine.
It's totally fine.

867
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:20,852
-Come in. Hey, cool bag.
-Thanks.

868
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:25,117
Yeah, it's from Guatemala. I got
it when I visited Central America.

869
01:19:25,361 --> 01:19:28,592
Really? That's interesting.
I'd love to go there.

870
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:32,790
It's great, really incredible.
You'd love to go there.

871
01:19:33,035 --> 01:19:34,866
-Okay, come in.
-Okay.

872
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,096
It's hard to explain,
but I kind of feel...

873
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:44,336
I sort of feel like this huge
sense of relief, you know?

874
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,048
I feel...

875
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,345
Iiberated.

876
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:54,145
But then, on the other hand,
I also feel...

877
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:58,656
sad, you know?

878
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:02,058
Kind of like someone died.

879
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:10,370
I don't know what to do with myself.
I don't know how to be alone and...

880
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:12,233
-I don't know how to be alone either.
-Really?

881
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:16,433
Yeah, I mean... Do you have
a thing like voices in your head?

882
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:19,647
-You mean like...?
-Not like 'kill, kill, kill', like...

883
01:20:19,882 --> 01:20:22,851
Yeah, right.

884
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:26,486
But yeah, that's why I do what
I do, that's why I love to act.

885
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:31,659
It's a creative outlet, it's putting
it somewhere, you know?

886
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:36,355
You wanna hear
something really weird?

887
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:39,328
My therapist has a crush on me.

888
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:45,704
That's kind of what's supposed to
happen a little bit, it's called...

889
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,408
Transference, I know.

890
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:53,506
But this is not that.
This is seriously awkward.

891
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:55,410
I don't know, it's...

892
01:20:56,151 --> 01:21:01,145
I feel like she's undressing me
right there, on the couch.

893
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,917
Every time I'm about to leave I walk
away thinking I'm gonna feel good...

894
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,789
then she says something negative,
as if to say 'Come back, love me.

895
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,430
-Need me, need me, need me.'
-That's what's supposed to happen.

896
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,635
You kind of...

897
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,837
It's a kind of controlled
mini nervous breakdown.

898
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:20,269
I know. Do you wanna know something?
I'll let you in on something.

899
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:24,843
Therapist, the rapist.

900
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:29,010
-What do you mean?
-lt means the same thing.

901
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:33,984
Spell out 'therapist', break it up
to 2 words: 'the rapist'.

902
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:38,185
That's what it means,
that's what she's doing...

903
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,768
That was weird.

904
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:02,810
Well, I'm definitely gay.

905
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:05,680
What?

906
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,223
I wasn't totally sure until now.

907
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:15,920
I've done stuff with guys and women
but I didn't really know.

908
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,724
Thanks a lot for crystallizing it.
I appreciate it.

909
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,128
Are you fucking kidding me?

910
01:22:21,837 --> 01:22:23,634
Wait, I don't...

911
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:26,670
Sorry. I don't have anything.
We used a condom, it's...

912
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:31,073
That's not the point.
Oh, my God. Idiot!

913
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:32,871
Oh, my God!

914
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,913
-I can't believe you!
-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

915
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,948
You have to go, okay?
I can't take this.

916
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:40,586
I didn't mean to do anything fucked
up like that. I'm really sorry.

917
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:44,918
I don't believe this. This is not
happening. How did you...?

918
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,191
-I was thinking about Johnny Depp.
-Oh, my God.

919
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:52,423
I'm embarrassed.
I didn't know that... I didn't know.

920
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:55,660
I can't believe it. I'm an
experiment all of a sudden, right?

921
01:22:56,171 --> 01:23:00,005
Are you 1 5 years-old? You should've
figured this out a long time ago!

922
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:02,103
Who are you?

923
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:06,345
You gotta go, okay? Just get your
fucking clothes and get out of here.

924
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:10,074
Take your shoes
and don't forget your little purse!

925
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:12,484
-It's not a purse, it's a bag.
-It's a purse!

926
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,586
I've seen the same one in Urban
Outfitters in the women's section.

927
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:18,486
That's the closest you'll ever going
to get to Guatemala. Go! Oh, God!

928
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:21,127
-I'm going, I'm sorry.
-I feel violated!

929
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:42,712
You have two new messages.

930
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:46,579
First new message.

931
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:50,314
Hey, Ellie, it's me, Justin. Hi.

932
01:23:51,259 --> 01:23:55,218
I haven't been able to take a dump
since you've been gone.

933
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:59,459
Roses are red
Violets are too

934
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:03,899
I miss you so much
My balls are blue

935
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:08,940
Message erased.
Sent today at 1 2:37.

936
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:11,941
Ellie, this is Dennis.
Don 't hang up.

937
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,944
You got a callback
for "Delta Breeze".

938
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:18,812
I'd love to drag you out of your
retirement. It'd be great to do.

939
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,421
So give me a ring
and we'll set that up, okay?

940
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:24,922
Take care. Bye-bye.

941
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,425
Message saved.

942
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:54,049
Sitting on that front porch,
I stared at your eyes for hours.

943
01:25:22,017 --> 01:25:26,954
That terrible night,
the storm ripped and...

944
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:34,720
Yeah, momma.

945
01:25:53,582 --> 01:25:55,209
Fuck.

946
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,494
Nice dress.

947
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:20,441
Ellie, hi. I'm so glad that
you're here. You look great.

948
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:24,441
-You don't think it's too much?
-No, it's perfect. Let me tell you:

949
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:30,640
it's intense in there. It's been a
sort of a nightmarish movie so far.

950
01:26:30,886 --> 01:26:33,354
I just wanted you to know before
you go in so you can be prepared.

951
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:35,579
-But you look beautiful.
-Thank you.

952
01:26:35,824 --> 01:26:37,121
Really, really.

953
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,917
Everyone, this is Ellie Parker.

954
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,487
Smash, you remember Ellie?

955
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:46,223
So nice to see you again.
These are the new producers.

956
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,695
What happened
to the other producers?

957
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:52,134
We are paying for this movie now.

958
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:56,401
We fired those
plastic Hollywood idiots.

959
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:01,276
Fucking idiots. Plastic.

960
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:04,610
-We are making a real movie.
-Oh, cool.

961
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:06,718
Art.

962
01:27:07,422 --> 01:27:09,549
Not shit art.

963
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:17,226
There's too much light in here.

964
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,537
Do you have the new scene?

965
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:31,439
New scene?

966
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:33,603
Fucking cunt.

967
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,209
Is that a wedding dress?

968
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:39,716
Are you getting married?

969
01:27:41,523 --> 01:27:45,015
Marriage is for beasts!

970
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:53,726
-Look, what new scene? I didn't...
-Very simple, a few lines.

971
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:59,669
They encapsulate
the entire meaning of love.

972
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:02,240
Sorry to spring this on you, Ellie.
If you wanna take a minute...

973
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:07,147
We just wanna see your mouth move.

974
01:28:08,183 --> 01:28:10,947
Eugene's gonna be reading
this with you. Eugene.

975
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,589
Have a seat, right?

976
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,987
Where's the lines? Who has a light?

977
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,271
Far be it from me to air my...

978
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,409
Stop, stop.

979
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:46,417
-There.
-Very nice. Very nice.

980
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:48,282
Much better.

981
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:02,961
Far be it from me to air
my opinion, Mr. O'Malley...

982
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:07,903
but I believe in a single God...

983
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:10,668
and a single nation.

984
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,609
Not two Americas.

985
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:18,711
This is worth fighting for!

986
01:29:25,627 --> 01:29:31,930
You're a lady of mighty fine opinions
and a beautiful woman too.

987
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,066
Why, Mr. O'Malley...

988
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:42,368
it's getting kind of late to be
out without a chaperone.

989
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:50,615
I can see the butterflies!

990
01:29:50,852 --> 01:29:52,786
So pretty.

991
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:56,251
We should head back.

992
01:29:59,794 --> 01:30:05,460
Although I love the swamp at dusk.

993
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:13,868
I miss my husband.

994
01:30:14,109 --> 01:30:16,407
Well, then allow me to comfort you.

995
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:24,617
Oh, Mr. O'Malley.

996
01:30:26,488 --> 01:30:30,219
-That was great. Totally great.
-Great.

997
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,765
That was perfect, Ellie.

998
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,034
Do you know the meaning of love?

999
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:47,497
Love is shit.

1000
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:54,212
Do you guys want her
to do this again? One more time?

1001
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:58,351
Do you guys want her to do this
again? Should we do another...

1002
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:04,249
Come on, Ellie. That was great.

1003
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:06,892
Have fun in Los Angeles.

1004
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:11,559
I am so sorry.

1005
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:16,703
That was really, really good. They're
really weird and kind of intense.

1006
01:31:16,938 --> 01:31:18,997
-Whatever.
-Can I talk to you for a second?

1007
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:23,040
-I need to have some words with you.
-I wanna apologize. I'll be right in.

1008
01:31:23,278 --> 01:31:24,870
-Goodbye, Nellie.
-Ellie.

1009
01:31:26,014 --> 01:31:26,981
Goodbye.

1010
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:32,517
I wanna take you to dinner and talk
about Justin. I am so sorry, Ellie.

1011
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:34,654
I'm sorry.

1012
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,074
Fuck!
