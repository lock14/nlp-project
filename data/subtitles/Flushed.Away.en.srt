1
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:52,480
- Car's here!
- It's 9.00! We'll miss our flight!

2
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:55,240
- Traveller's cheques...
- You have the tickets?

3
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:57,238
- Tabitha, did you feed Roddy?
- Oops.

4
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:59,716
I just know we've forgotten something.

5
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:01,923
Roddy, where are you?

6
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:06,286
We'll be back in a few days, so here's
enough food for you. Here's more.

7
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:08,039
- Tabitha!
- Here's a little more.

8
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:11,244
- I hope you're not overfeeding him.
- Of course not, Mum.

9
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:12,999
- Come on, Tabitha!
- Bye, Roddy.

10
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,966
- We don't want to miss our holiday.
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

11
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:28,596
When the cat's away...

12
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:31,247
...the mice will play!

13
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,636
The holiday starts now, everyone!

14
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,479
Music, maestro!

15
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:46,246
Hey, what are you all standing
around for? I got a big day planned!

16
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:48,204
Let's go, people! Chop-chop!

17
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,127
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

18
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:55,277
Nope. Nope. Nope.

19
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:08,243
Buckle up, everyone.

20
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,680
Fore!

21
00:02:22,927 --> 00:02:24,645
Oops. Sorry.

22
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,126
Game point. Service!

23
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,677
We win! We win, team! We win!

24
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,042
Perfect.

25
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:05,798
Having a good time, darling?

26
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,760
Thank you.

27
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:18,080
See you tomorrow.

28
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:31,436
Good night!

29
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:34,087
Good night! Good night!

30
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,124
Yeah, well. Good night then, Roddy.

31
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:50,799
What was that?

32
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:53,921
Who's there?

33
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,044
Wake up.
I think there's someone in the house.

34
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:59,958
Sarge, wake up!

35
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,796
Approaching enemy lines.

36
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:13,197
- I'm armed and ready.
- At ease, soldier.

37
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,926
Give up your weapons
of mass destruction.

38
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:19,443
Come get me, enemy of freedom!
I'm armed and ready.

39
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:23,156
Tell Mom I... love... her.

40
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,719
They do not, repeat, not,
have food like this in the sewer.

41
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:14,796
A sewer rat!

42
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,161
Who... What... How did you get here?

43
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:23,002
I don't know. One minute I'm in the pub.
Next thing you know, whoosh!

44
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:27,160
It's a burst water main!
Off I go, shooting up the pipes.

45
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:29,681
And, well, here I am.

46
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,361
I have a plunger.
We can shoot you right back.

47
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,235
Do you like seafood?

48
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:37,646
Can I call you a cab?

49
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:40,479
See food! Get it?

50
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,116
Have you got a TV?

51
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:45,198
- Yes, but...
- Say no more!

52
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,039
No. Leave that.

53
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:48,480
Geronimo!

54
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,717
No, don't... touch anything.

55
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:54,083
Would you look at the size
of that monster?!

56
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,845
Careful, mate.
Those aren't chocolate buttons.

57
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,082
It's the match of the century!
The FIFA World Cup Final!

58
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,397
- England. Germany.
- Yes! Boo!

59
00:06:08,487 --> 00:06:10,364
Live this Sunday. Be there.

60
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:13,803
This place is great!
I'm staying here forever!

61
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,286
What?

62
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,720
Game point. Service!

63
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:22,882
We win, we win!
You lose! In your face!

64
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:35,360
Right, my friend. You don't belong here.
I'm afraid it's time for you to leave.

65
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,396
I would not do that if I was you, pal.

66
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:43,162
Let me lay this out for you.
This place is mine now.

67
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:47,081
Sid says, "Jump," you say,
"How high?" Comprende?

68
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,921
Fetch us some Pop-Tarts from the
kitchen, Jeeves. Be snappy about it.

69
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:55,078
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

70
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,566
That's more like it.

71
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,764
But before breakfast is served...

72
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:03,396
...perhaps sir would care
to take a whirl in the Jacuzzi.

73
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:06,126
A Jacuzzi?

74
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:10,766
You're a real gent.

75
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,077
After a hard day
navigating sewer pipes,

76
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:17,604
there's nothing better than relaxing
in a Jacuzzi whirlpool bath.

77
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,121
That looks so inviting.

78
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:22,402
Yes. The water looks perfect!

79
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:26,685
Now you hop in, and I'll press
this lever to get the bubbles going.

80
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,917
Right. In we go!

81
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,925
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

82
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:34,043
I know we got off
on the wrong foot before,

83
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:36,641
but I think we're
gonna get along, don't you?

84
00:07:36,727 --> 00:07:38,126
Swimmingly.

85
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:41,442
Be seeing you.

86
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:45,879
You plonker!

87
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:48,481
You think I don't know a toilet
when I see one?

88
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,717
You were going to flush me down the loo.

89
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,957
No! It's a big Jacuzzi! Deluxe model!

90
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:55,686
Then you won't mind
if I get the bubbles going.

91
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,964
No! Not the lever!
Have mercy! No, I can't swim!

92
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,356
Bon voyage, me old cream cracker!

93
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,438
- Hold your nose!
- You can't do this!

94
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:07,315
You were going to try to flush me.
Let's see how you like it.

95
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:31,399
Have you seen my dad?

96
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,965
Oh, no, I can't swim!
I can't swim! I can't...

97
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:12,440
...swim.

98
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,442
I'm... in... the sewer!

99
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,681
Hello?

100
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,042
Help?

101
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,804
I'm gonna open my eyes and be home.
This is all a bad dream.

102
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,079
I'm not home! I wanna go home!

103
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,919
Shush! Stop it. Roddy!

104
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,362
I want to go home!
Pull yourself together!

105
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:55,244
I can't. I'm frightened.

106
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,283
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

107
00:09:57,367 --> 00:10:02,316
All right, Roddy, old man, you can
get yourself out of here, and you will.

108
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:04,276
Never forget,

109
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,916
the blood of the courageous
James clan flows through your veins.

110
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,878
Extra! Extra!

111
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,356
Read all about it!

112
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,360
A way out! Yes!

113
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:43,121
Hey! That took me 3 years to draw!

114
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,482
I'm terribly sorry. Three years?

115
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,523
I just finished it this morning!

116
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:50,121
Three years?

117
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:53,724
Good grief!

118
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,843
- What is this place?
- Hold the bus!

119
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:06,283
Feed the flies! Tuppence a bag!

120
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,526
It's a real city!

121
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:21,435
My smalls!

122
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:23,199
- Is it a bird?
- Is it a plane?

123
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,562
Is that guy wearing my underpants?

124
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:26,966
Make him move, honey.

125
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,481
Boy, you got a face like a frying pan!

126
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,286
- Come on!
- I don't think he speaks English.

127
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:34,517
He moved! Did you get it?

128
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,044
- Got it!
- Good.

129
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:39,004
Sorry, sorry.

130
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:41,555
- It's coming!
- What? Where? Who?

131
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:43,160
The Great Flood!

132
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:47,798
Those floodgates won't hold forever,
you know! We're doomed!

133
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,242
You think you can back away
from the truth!

134
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:52,921
'Ello, hello, hello.
What's all this then?

135
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:56,443
Thank heavens! A policeman!
This wacko has been chasing after me!

136
00:11:56,527 --> 00:11:57,721
'Morning, Harold.

137
00:11:57,807 --> 00:12:00,401
- 'Morning, Collin. How are you?
- Can't complain.

138
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,365
Keep an eye on this one.
He's a bit of a loony.

139
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:04,800
We're doomed!

140
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:06,479
- Are you kidding me?
- Right.

141
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,479
- Let's give you a police escort home.
- Great!

142
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:13,640
I live in Kensington.
Up there. The surface.

143
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:16,844
Up Top? Oh, no. No, no, no.

144
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:19,316
The humans don't like our sort.

145
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,241
Speak for yourself.
They like me very much up there.

146
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:28,481
I don't like your attitude.
I've got my eye on you, sunshine.

147
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,955
You're trying to get Up Top, me hearty?

148
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:36,441
Yes.

149
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:42,678
There's one person 'round here
might be able to help you. Might.

150
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:43,836
Really?

151
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:47,806
Shady customer.
The captain of the Jammy Dodger.

152
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:51,846
- If you can find it.
- I know where it is!

153
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:03,156
And remember,
the name of the boat's the Jammy Dodger.

154
00:13:03,247 --> 00:13:05,807
Thanks for bringing me this far.

155
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:08,196
You're welcome.

156
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:10,601
See ya!

157
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,285
Beware.

158
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,085
Beware.

159
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:33,326
Hello?

160
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,163
Permission to come aboard?

161
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:39,725
Ahoy there?

162
00:14:04,007 --> 00:14:07,443
Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude,
Mr Captain, Skipper, Thingy.

163
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:11,202
Hey! That's Miss Captain
Skipper Thingy to you.

164
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,283
What are you doing on my boat?

165
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,244
I've had a bad day and need your help.

166
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:19,160
I was thrown out of my own home,
flushed down my own toilet.

167
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:22,159
Thank you, too much information.
I have my own problems.

168
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:24,715
She's around here somewhere!

169
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:27,037
Stay down. And keep quiet.

170
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:32,125
Why? Who are we hiding from?

171
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:35,597
I said quiet! There's rats after me
who'd like to kill me.

172
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:38,121
Well, I'll contain my amazement.

173
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:42,283
All right, all right. Quiet as a mouse.

174
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,879
Over there!

175
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:53,480
You idiot!

176
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:54,920
Sorry about that.

177
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:56,838
I'll be off then.

178
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,441
Sorry.

179
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,318
Sorry. Sorry.

180
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:02,796
Sorry!

181
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,320
We can't let her get away!

182
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:10,284
Come on, Jammy,
me old mate, don't do this to me!

183
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:23,560
Let me go, you pink-eyed freak!

184
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,365
I'm upset now.

185
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:29,317
Whatever's going on, I'm not involved.

186
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,877
I'm an innocent bystander!

187
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,767
Rita, Rita, Rita!

188
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
You thought you could give us the slip.

189
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:45,962
What are you looking at?
Keep still! Come on, then! Right!

190
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,602
Who have we got here?

191
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:53,077
I believe he said
his name was Millicent Bystander.

192
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,797
- Millicent!
- Actually, no...

193
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:59,004
Now, then, where's the ruby, Rita?

194
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,679
The boss wants it back.

195
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,678
I don't have your stupid ruby.

196
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,238
OK, are we going to do it
the easy way...

197
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:07,999
...or the hard way?

198
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,760
I think we should do it
the easy way, don't you, Spike?

199
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,115
All right. Check the tin.

200
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,845
Good girl.

201
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:19,565
See, Whitey, this is how I do it.

202
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,763
Watch and learn, my son. Watch and...

203
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,116
Was it in there?

204
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,675
Right! Rip it up, lads!

205
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:36,962
Hey, you get
your filthy paws off my stuff!

206
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:41,603
It's in here somewhere.
I can feel it in me guts!

207
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:43,518
That'll be last night's curry.

208
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:46,440
I'm the same.
I got a bum like the Japanese flag.

209
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,280
Will you please tell them
I'm not involved in this?

210
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,483
Fine. All right, all right, listen up.

211
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,683
This gentleman,
he's not from around here.

212
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:54,756
Thank you.

213
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,361
- Just look how nicely he's dressed.
- Thank you.

214
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:00,405
And why? Because he's
an international jewel thief!

215
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,717
Precisely. What? No, no!

216
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:05,719
- He stole the ruby from me!
- No, she's lying!

217
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:09,243
All right, all right!
It's time to bring out...

218
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,397
...the Persuader.

219
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:15,797
Your choice, mate. You can talk now

220
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:18,799
or you can talk later.
Ain't that right, Persuader?

221
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:22,038
Yeah, in a much higher voice!

222
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:24,277
The Persuader's alive, Spike!

223
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,244
You'll be singing like a tea kettle.

224
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,238
Good one, Persuader.

225
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,080
I don't even know her!
I don't know anything!

226
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,125
Careful, miss. You'll injure yourself.

227
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,361
I know where it is!

228
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,960
Come on, then. Spit it out!

229
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,605
Don't you dare!

230
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:42,963
Look at her bottom.
Is it me, or is it oddly shaped?

231
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,481
You little snitch.

232
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:48,206
The booty's in the booty.

233
00:17:56,927 --> 00:18:01,045
Thanks, mate! The boss is
gonna be so happy with us.

234
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,077
You're toast.

235
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:09,639
So you're from Up Top?

236
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:12,764
I used to work in a laboratory Up Top.

237
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:15,156
Yeah. Big shampoo job.

238
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:18,284
I was dark grey when we started.

239
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:21,317
Still, it cleared up me dandruff.

240
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:27,155
The World Cup has become the most
popular sporting event in the world.

241
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:29,966
Are you there, boss? We're back.

242
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,515
I've got it, boss.

243
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:35,360
The ruby. I found it.

244
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,723
Technically, Spike,
it was Millicent that found it.

245
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,002
Actually, the name's Roddy.

246
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,716
In exchange for my assistance,
I was hoping you might...

247
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:50,561
You might help me
out of the pickle I'm in.

248
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,081
Hello, Rita.

249
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,520
Hello, handsome.

250
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:01,282
And who is this?
Is your new boyfriend a waiter?

251
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,244
- Boyfriend?!
- Waiter?!

252
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:08,206
The prize returns to me.

253
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,960
Did you imagine
that I'd let you steal it from me?

254
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:17,040
What?! That jewel belongs
to my father, and you know it!

255
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:21,883
Your father? A good-for-nothing
scavenger, just like his daughter!

256
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:24,242
Excuse me. Actually,

257
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:26,238
I'm the one that found your ruby.

258
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:29,364
So... you...

259
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:33,076
Perhaps you'd repay the favour
and help me get home.

260
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,246
Help me!

261
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:37,800
Dispose of them.

262
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:41,323
No, no, no, please!
I just want to get home to Kensington!

263
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,845
Kensington? The Royal Borough?

264
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:47,280
Up Top?

265
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,927
Yes. Up Top.

266
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,366
Huzzah! A man of quality!

267
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:55,244
Finally, somebody gets it.

268
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:58,081
Come, let me show you
my private collection.

269
00:19:58,167 --> 00:20:00,920
I know you'll find it diverting.

270
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,117
My shrine to beauty.

271
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:11,678
Works of high art crafted
in tribute to our beloved Royal Family.

272
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:14,440
Victoria's bust, wrought in porcelain.

273
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:15,960
Classy!

274
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,924
Quite lifelike, wouldn't you say?

275
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:20,199
It's as if she were here.

276
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:22,678
Smooth to the touch.

277
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,756
Easy, tiger.

278
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:28,285
But come! Let us restore the heart

279
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,835
and highlight of my collection...

280
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:35,682
...this ruby. Fallen from
the very brow of ancient kings.

281
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,645
A true crown jewel!

282
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:44,478
Well, what do you think?

283
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,762
He's a madman! Run away!

284
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:49,486
Pardon me. My fly's undone.

285
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:53,804
Well, your ruby certainly is a biggie.

286
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,764
Indeed.

287
00:20:55,847 --> 00:21:00,204
How did it ever find me,
here in the underbelly of the world?

288
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,085
In this dark, low place.

289
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:08,807
Yes. I'd love to see more of your
collection. It's very amusing, but I...

290
00:21:08,927 --> 00:21:10,076
"Amusing"?

291
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:12,679
Didn't you say I'd find it amusing?

292
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:16,442
I said you'd find it diverting,
not amusing!

293
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:20,156
When I said "amusing"
I really meant it in the sense

294
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,717
of the ancient Greek muse,
the goddess of inspiration.

295
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:26,281
Muse.

296
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,644
Smashing.

297
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,764
Heaven help me!

298
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:44,357
Ice him! Ice them both!

299
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:48,159
Let's see if there's
anything good in the fridge.

300
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:52,601
Former enemies, one and all.

301
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:57,715
A catalogue of thieves,
double-crossers and do-gooders.

302
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:03,439
Prepare to meet your maker,
your ice maker.

303
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:06,678
Makes me laugh every time, that one.

304
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:07,995
Shut that door.

305
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,961
Liquid nitrogen!
That will freeze us instantly!

306
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:17,005
There's a paper clip in my back pocket.
See if you can get it.

307
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:18,766
In the pocket, in the pocket!

308
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,638
Blimey, it's cold.

309
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,718
That's why I wore me mittens.

310
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:31,402
Hit men don't wear mittens!
Take them off! You're embarrassing me.

311
00:22:31,487 --> 00:22:34,160
It's all right for you.
You've got little hands.

312
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:36,283
- Got it!
- They don't get as cold.

313
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,722
- I ain't got little hands!
- Yeah, you have.

314
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:40,081
You got lady's hands.

315
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:43,400
They might be small,
but they're lethal weapons.

316
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,000
You got your mother's hands.

317
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,361
Right. Put your hands together.

318
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:52,838
You could have wiped your feet.

319
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,839
Stop squirming!

320
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,366
Goodbye, vermin.

321
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:11,399
Now, let me see the latest addition
to my cubist collection.

322
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:18,479
- What?! Impossible!
- Oi! Kermit!

323
00:23:18,807 --> 00:23:22,800
The prize returns to me!

324
00:23:22,887 --> 00:23:25,355
You big, fat, slimy airbag!

325
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,240
After them!

326
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:32,037
Why are you stopping?
Don't we have a plan?

327
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:33,719
"We"? Who's "we"?

328
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:35,399
You can't just leave me here!

329
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:38,604
Faster, you idiots! They're escaping!

330
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:55,521
No! Not the master cable!

331
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:56,722
We have a plan?

332
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:57,956
Put that back!

333
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:01,202
Wait, wait!
That will never hold both of us.

334
00:24:01,287 --> 00:24:02,959
You're right. Toodle-oo.

335
00:24:03,047 --> 00:24:04,241
Wait!

336
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:05,840
F-f-f-freeze!

337
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:14,443
Don't break! There are things
I want to do, sights I want to see!

338
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,798
That wasn't on the list.

339
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,560
Do something!

340
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:34,359
Keep your legs straight
when you hit the water!

341
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,195
I kept me legs straight, Spike.

342
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:47,602
Good grief, that's high. Quite high.
Rather high. So very, very high.

343
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:54,803
Cool.

344
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:56,721
See you!

345
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:16,801
If she can do it...

346
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,605
Here goes.

347
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,837
And gently down.

348
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:42,640
- My ball.
- It's my ball, it's mine.

349
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:45,116
Rita! Rita!

350
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,401
Where is she? Rita!

351
00:25:52,207 --> 00:25:54,084
Target at twelve o'clock!

352
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,600
Oh, come on!

353
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:02,205
Careful, Whitey.
That's a banana skin.

354
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:07,842
Rita!

355
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,720
Over there!

356
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:30,286
You look pretty ridiculous now,
Millicent.

357
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:36,399
Keep your legs straight!

358
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:51,242
What are you, some kind of rat
boomerang? Give me back my ruby!

359
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:53,318
I haven't got your ruby!

360
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:59,998
OK. Well, now I've got your ruby.

361
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:06,841
Please be careful.

362
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:09,885
That ruby means a lot to me.
It's priceless!

363
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:11,926
Hold on.

364
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:13,635
It's a fake.

365
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:15,797
No, it's blooming not. It's real!

366
00:27:15,887 --> 00:27:17,684
No, no, no, look, it's just glass.

367
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:19,120
- It's real!
- Fake.

368
00:27:19,207 --> 00:27:20,196
- Real!
- Fake.

369
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:21,356
- Real!
- Fake.

370
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:22,721
- Real!
- Fake.

371
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,842
- Real!
- Fake.

372
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:26,487
Look, look, look.
You can tell. Watch this.

373
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,916
There, you see?
You can't break a real ruby.

374
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:37,646
Right. I probably shouldn't
have done that.

375
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,922
Look on the bright side.
I saved your neck.

376
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:43,158
Once The Toad knows it's worthless,
he'll stop chasing you.

377
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,317
Roddy St. James saves the day.

378
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,400
Good grief!

379
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:53,603
You try to do somebody
a favour, and they...

380
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:58,556
A favour?! That ruby
was from Queen Elizabeth's crown!

381
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:01,002
It fell down the drain
of Buckingham Palace!

382
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:03,647
Maybe the Queen wears fake jewellery.

383
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:05,558
Keep still!

384
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,160
Can we just talk about this?

385
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:11,798
Real or not, that ruby was
going to change my life!

386
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,400
Han Chin Chinese takeout.

387
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:15,762
A madwoman's attacking me with crayons!

388
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:18,759
- One chicken chow mein. With wonton?
- No, crayons!

389
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,156
No wonton! You want rice?
Fried or white?

390
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:23,044
Fried. No, wait!

391
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:24,640
You want wonton or what?

392
00:28:24,727 --> 00:28:26,285
Cancel that order.

393
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:28,202
Rita?

394
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:30,243
Just go away, please.

395
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:34,921
I'm sorry.

396
00:28:36,127 --> 00:28:38,118
Sorry?

397
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:41,244
Me and my dad
worked these drains for years.

398
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:44,603
He broke every bone in his body
trying to get that ruby.

399
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:48,560
It was going to be
the answer to all our prayers.

400
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:51,525
Now it turns out it was a stupid fake.

401
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,237
Maybe I can make it up to you.

402
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:58,680
- Get stuffed.
- No, no, no.

403
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,917
I mean it. Back at my place, we've got

404
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:04,602
a jewellery box crammed
with rubies and diamonds. Real ones.

405
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:08,123
All you have to do
is get me home to Kensington...

406
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:12,043
...and I'll make you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

407
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:17,837
How do I know this ain't
just a load of old rubbish?

408
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:21,237
Well, I suppose you'll
just have to trust me.

409
00:29:23,007 --> 00:29:25,157
I must be out of my mind.

410
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:27,715
All right. You've got yourself a deal.

411
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,881
Go on.

412
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:34,241
You too.

413
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:37,525
Your own hand.

414
00:29:47,807 --> 00:29:50,116
Where are those idiots?

415
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:53,165
It's so hard to get
good help these days, my boys.

416
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:56,478
That's right. Come on out, my lovelies.

417
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:59,127
Cheer your old dad up.

418
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:02,165
Poor Daddy, surrounded by filthy rats

419
00:30:02,247 --> 00:30:05,922
in this joyless, sunless void!

420
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,202
But don't worry, little men.

421
00:30:08,287 --> 00:30:11,438
Daddy will get rid of them all! He will.

422
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:14,360
They'll all be deady-weady.

423
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,280
Did you find it?

424
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:22,926
Did you find it?

425
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,845
Well, we got most of it, boss.

426
00:30:27,607 --> 00:30:31,361
Forget the ruby!
It's the master cable that I want.

427
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:34,757
The one that grubby creature Rita took.

428
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,042
Without it, my plan is ruined!

429
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:42,000
OK, chief.
Forget the ruby. Ruby's gone.

430
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:46,205
See? See? Moving on.
We are now your cable guys.

431
00:30:46,287 --> 00:30:48,278
Focused. Cable-centric, boss.

432
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:52,284
You need to be back in time
for the World Cup Final.

433
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,597
Great! Are we watching
the game together?

434
00:30:55,927 --> 00:30:58,122
Just get the cable!

435
00:30:58,207 --> 00:31:00,118
Keep your legs straight!

436
00:31:00,607 --> 00:31:03,326
Are you sure we should be
stopping with goons after us?

437
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:05,875
We aren't gonna get far
without a map, are we?

438
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:09,240
Is that a house?

439
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:12,842
Yes, and it's very dangerous. So...

440
00:31:12,927 --> 00:31:14,565
...why don't you wait here.

441
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:16,683
Waiting here. Excellent idea.

442
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,678
Watch out for the piranha.

443
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,361
Rita!

444
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:29,963
Here you go, Annie. You, Shamus.

445
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:32,561
Mimi, get your finger out of your nose.
Fergus.

446
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,525
- Jojo, no biting.
- That is wild good!

447
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:37,564
Rita!

448
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:42,481
Rita's back!

449
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,922
- Rita!
- Mum! Oh, Mum.

450
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,520
Thank goodness you're safe.

451
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,204
Rita!

452
00:31:52,367 --> 00:31:53,356
Hello, Dad.

453
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:55,403
Give us a hug, girl!

454
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:04,115
Mom, there's a peeping Tom outside!

455
00:32:04,207 --> 00:32:07,677
Tom?! Ohh, it's Tom Jones!

456
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,883
Mother, it's not Tom Jones.

457
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:12,561
That's just my passenger.

458
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:16,322
- He's very good-looking.
- He is not coming in.

459
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:19,039
Soup's on!

460
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:22,238
It's lovely. Thanks, Mum.

461
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,482
So how long have you been
Rita's boyfriend?

462
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,398
He's not my boyfriend.

463
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:36,757
Will you make an honest woman
of my daughter?

464
00:32:36,847 --> 00:32:38,075
Dad!

465
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:41,045
We were thinking of a spring wedding,
right, cream puff?

466
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,766
Look, I want all of you to know he's...

467
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:45,565
Tom Jones!

468
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:49,005
So your name is "Roddy,"
is that right?

469
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:50,884
Yes, that's right. Roddy St. James.

470
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,446
What a beautiful name.

471
00:32:52,527 --> 00:32:54,643
- Hi, Roddy.
- Who might you be, little chap?

472
00:32:54,727 --> 00:32:57,082
- They call me Shocky.
- Why do they call you that?

473
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,635
- Shocky!
- Yes! Got it.

474
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:03,197
Rita, where are you taking
this handsome young man?

475
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:06,203
That's why I need your maps, Dad.

476
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:09,279
Because he's from... Up Top.

477
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,758
Kitchen. Now.

478
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:18,566
Sing us a song, Tom!

479
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:22,997
- I'm not saying it isn't risky.
- But it's impossible, Rita.

480
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:25,885
No one's ever got past
the rapids at Hyde Park.

481
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,686
Dad, Dad! He's gonna pay us.

482
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:32,442
For the last time,
we don't need the money!

483
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,324
A new stove might be nice.

484
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:42,796
- Talkin' about the little lady
- Go, Tom! Go!

485
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,605
- Sing to my heart!
- She's a lady

486
00:33:45,247 --> 00:33:48,125
Talkin' about that old lady

487
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:51,522
And the lady wears big undies

488
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:53,086
Huge undies.

489
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:55,246
Psst! Rita!

490
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,363
It's OK. It's me, Liam.

491
00:33:57,447 --> 00:33:58,766
Quick, in the kitchen.

492
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,326
Look at those moves!

493
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,398
I love you, Tom!

494
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:04,318
This bloke isn't who he says he is.

495
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:08,082
His real name is Millicent Bystander,
an international jewel thief.

496
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:09,998
A mastermind, a super-criminal.

497
00:34:10,087 --> 00:34:12,760
Looks like he crossed The Toad
and got away with it.

498
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,236
But I'm a thinker. I've got a plan.

499
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:19,276
More! More!

500
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:22,841
- That was brilliant!
- Oh, it was nothing.

501
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,361
- So you're from Up Top?
- Yes.

502
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,563
- I've met one of your lot before.
- Really?

503
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:29,365
Used to be some old lady's pet.

504
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:30,800
That's nice.

505
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:34,516
Terribly lonely for him, though.
He had no one to talk to.

506
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:36,438
No one to cuddle with!

507
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:37,960
No one to shocky.

508
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:40,436
That's no life, is it?

509
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:44,557
I'd better get these dishes started.

510
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:47,562
Please, permit me.

511
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:50,036
Oh, you're such a gentleman!

512
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:54,235
Great! So I hand Roddy
over to The Toad

513
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:56,204
and claim the reward.

514
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:59,597
Then we're all sitting pretty
for the rest of our lives. Is that it?

515
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:01,439
The Toad will pay a fortune for him.

516
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:04,121
He's a bad one anyway,
so that's all right, isn't it?

517
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:08,486
You cheeky little monkey. I won't have
no son of mine acting the rat.

518
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,876
We Malones never go back on our word.

519
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:13,276
- He's gonna steal your boat.
- He won't.

520
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,801
- He's stealing your boat.
- He isn't stealing...

521
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:18,082
- He stole your boat.
- What?

522
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,761
He's like Robin Hood in reverse.

523
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,478
Oi! I thought we had a deal!

524
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:26,080
So did I!

525
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:33,517
This is an emergency!
Get out of the way! Emergency!

526
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:37,680
Keep clear! I'm coming, Mr Jones,
I'm coming! Marry me, Mr Jones!

527
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,325
Roddy!

528
00:35:44,047 --> 00:35:46,957
That double-crossing little schemer.
I don't need her.

529
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:49,561
I mean, anyone can get out
and sail. Look at me!

530
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:53,755
All right, Sid,
you're in for a big surprise.

531
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:55,326
Look out!

532
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:57,405
Sorry!

533
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,644
Sid's Tattoo and Hot Dog Parlour.

534
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:04,321
It's Roddy. Remember me?

535
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:06,682
- The butler?
- Roddy!

536
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:10,077
Listen, you! If you're still there
when I get back...

537
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,603
Back? Back?
How will you do that then, Roddy?

538
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,437
- What was that?
- Gotta go, Rodders.

539
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:18,518
If I find one thing out of place...

540
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:41,601
Here's a little song I wrote

541
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:44,679
You might want to sing it note for note

542
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,804
Don't worry

543
00:36:47,887 --> 00:36:49,366
Be happy

544
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:52,286
Don't worry, be happy now

545
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,003
Where are they hiding?

546
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,006
Think. Think.

547
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:06,046
To find a rat,
you got to think like a rat.

548
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:09,115
Hey, guys.

549
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:13,723
I've had a tip-off.
They're heading west to Kensington.

550
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:16,326
Bingo!

551
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:17,840
Scrabble!

552
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:20,441
Enough games. To the ratmobiles!

553
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:24,601
OK, OK. We can fix it.

554
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:26,837
Yes, we can. Obviously...

555
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:31,597
Fairly major burn to the hand.
Smell of burning flesh.

556
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:33,245
Maybe I should just...

557
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:42,441
That really hurt.

558
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:47,396
Just start, you worthless old pile
of rubbish! You useless, unreliable...

559
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:52,242
Untrustworthy, double-crossing,
two-faced, conniving little toe-rag!

560
00:37:57,207 --> 00:38:01,120
So I'm the double-crosser?
Oh, yes, that's rich!

561
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:02,640
I overheard everything.

562
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:06,037
Yes, you and your family
were gonna sell me to The Toad!

563
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:07,879
What?

564
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:11,676
You dipstick! That was
my stupid little brother's plan.

565
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,359
And no one listens to him.

566
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:16,524
Must have missed that part.

567
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:21,442
How could you think I'd sell you out?
When I make a deal, I make a deal.

568
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,441
Your hair's on fire.

569
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:24,642
What?

570
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:29,480
Rita, look...

571
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:34,436
...I'm sorry. I was wrong.
I think we should just put it behind us.

572
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,839
OK. I suppose I can put it behind me.

573
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,638
This is such an overreaction!

574
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:46,481
Rita, you can't just
leave me here on a...

575
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:49,639
On a duck! Up the creek without a...

576
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:54,318
You're getting everything you deserve.
Sneaking around,

577
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:56,716
eavesdropping
on people's conversations.

578
00:38:56,807 --> 00:38:58,923
I was not sneaking around.

579
00:38:59,007 --> 00:39:00,918
Right.

580
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:05,319
I say, you can't really intend
to just strand me like this.

581
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:07,318
You're not that heartless.

582
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:10,117
OK, maybe you are.

583
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:13,244
If you're trying to teach me a lesson,
consider it taught!

584
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:15,283
I'm on a duck, begging!

585
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:29,239
Ice cold Rita

586
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,966
Never did I meet a

587
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:35,756
Girl who's half so cruel
I offered her a jewel

588
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:38,122
But she left me stuck
Stranded on a duck

589
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:41,802
What a shoddy thing to do to Roddy
Me

590
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:44,447
That's Roddy St. James of Kensington

591
00:39:44,527 --> 00:39:46,882
Poor, poor Roddy

592
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,401
Flushed down his own potty

593
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,923
Rita, can't you find it in your heart

594
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,885
To help him?

595
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,037
How mean can one rat be?

596
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:00,197
Ice cold Rita

597
00:40:00,287 --> 00:40:05,077
Won't you be sweeter to me?

598
00:40:09,647 --> 00:40:11,285
Am I forgiven?

599
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,722
No. I was just afraid
you'd sing another verse.

600
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:16,526
Rita, I wasn't eavesdropping,
I swear to you.

601
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:18,404
Oh, really?

602
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:22,522
What were you doing, then, Roddy?

603
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:27,476
I was actually just watching you
with your family...

604
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,364
...and...

605
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:31,438
...thinking how lucky you were.

606
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,356
Lucky? Stuck with you?

607
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,756
So our deal's still on?

608
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:46,644
Sure it is.

609
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:54,527
Look, I really want to
help out around here.

610
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:57,758
Just give me a job.
Anything... engineer, navigator.

611
00:40:57,847 --> 00:40:59,758
I could drive for a bit if you like.

612
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:04,119
Pick on someone your own size!

613
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:06,198
- You heard the captain.
- Get lost!

614
00:41:06,287 --> 00:41:08,847
There's no room
for passengers on this boat.

615
00:41:10,007 --> 00:41:12,760
Let go, you sticky little...

616
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:17,679
I'm the captain, and I say go left.

617
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,281
Would that be port
or starboard, Spike?

618
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:21,595
There they are!

619
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,766
Go get them, lads!

620
00:41:31,487 --> 00:41:32,602
Rita!

621
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:38,520
Wait for it, wait for it... Now!

622
00:41:41,087 --> 00:41:43,555
Have another go if you think
you're fast enough!

623
00:41:46,847 --> 00:41:48,439
Hold on, Roddy!

624
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:50,836
Get that cable, lads!

625
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,276
You may now kiss the bride.

626
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,645
Congratulations, by the way!

627
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:11,802
Rita!

628
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,962
Rita! Can we go a little faster, please?

629
00:42:19,047 --> 00:42:20,958
We don't have to!

630
00:42:22,447 --> 00:42:24,961
Go, go, purple custard!

631
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:40,318
End of the line, Millicent.

632
00:42:46,007 --> 00:42:48,282
- Rita, try and go right!
- What?

633
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:49,482
Just trust me!

634
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,683
I hope you know what you're doing!

635
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,000
Now head for the rope!

636
00:42:55,087 --> 00:42:56,315
OK.

637
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:07,516
Oh, no.

638
00:43:09,727 --> 00:43:11,365
Well done, Roddy!

639
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:13,722
We did it! We did it!

640
00:43:14,607 --> 00:43:15,801
We didn't do it.

641
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:19,685
Can you get me back on the boat?

642
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:26,363
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

643
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:31,399
Are you sure about this, Spike? These
things are supposed to be dangerous.

644
00:43:31,487 --> 00:43:33,557
Danger is my middle name.

645
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:35,683
I thought it was Leslie.

646
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,997
Just thought I'd drop in.

647
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:48,476
Rita, do something quick! Anything!

648
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,444
Hang on tight!

649
00:44:00,487 --> 00:44:01,602
Uh-oh.

650
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,997
Any last requests?

651
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:08,966
Yes. Could you fly quite suddenly
off the boat, screaming like a girl?

652
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:24,918
Oh, dear.

653
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:31,325
Yes!

654
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:43,283
Look out!

655
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:49,479
You darn foreigners!

656
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:58,481
Do you think the boss
will be annoyed with us?

657
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:01,445
You incompetent cheese-eaters!

658
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:03,483
You let them escape?

659
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:09,722
It's obvious I should never have sent
rodents to do an amphibian's job.

660
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:10,922
Where is he?

661
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:12,918
Why is he always late?

662
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:19,478
En garde! Droit! Parry! Thrust!

663
00:45:20,607 --> 00:45:22,040
Le Frog?

664
00:45:28,287 --> 00:45:29,766
Bonjour.

665
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:31,246
You're late, Le Frog.

666
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:35,798
Fashionably late, my annoying
English cousin. I know no other way.

667
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:40,881
Now, listen. Rita and her new accomplice
have stolen something irreplaceable.

668
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,481
It's all right, boss!
We've got another one!

669
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:49,081
A master cable
of unique design and purpose.

670
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,680
I want it back.

671
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,318
Don't worry. I'll get it back for you.

672
00:45:53,407 --> 00:45:56,604
Once it is returned,
my plan will be complete.

673
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:01,363
To wash away, once and for all,
the curse, the scourge of...

674
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:04,881
...rats.

675
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,917
Forgive me, my warty English cousin,

676
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:13,319
but this bizarre obsession
with the rats, it is not good for you.

677
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:17,719
You are becoming
what we French call le fruitcake.

678
00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:23,278
Perhaps you forget that it was a rat
who cast me from paradise!

679
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,803
Oh, please. Not the scrapbook again!

680
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:28,559
My memoirs.

681
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:33,681
Volume one details the dire
and tragic story of my youth.

682
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:35,519
Oh, mon Dieu!

683
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:40,682
Of all the pets in Buckingham Palace,

684
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:43,759
young Prince Charles
fancied me the best.

685
00:46:43,847 --> 00:46:48,398
We would frolic
day after sunny day in royal abandon,

686
00:46:48,487 --> 00:46:52,878
sharing that sweet and magical bond
between boy and toad.

687
00:46:52,967 --> 00:46:55,037
You're gonna make me throw up.

688
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:57,846
We were inseparable until...

689
00:46:57,927 --> 00:46:59,758
...it arrived.

690
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:02,361
That rat!

691
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:05,120
While the poor boy's head was turned,

692
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:10,042
I was cruelly plunged
into a whirlpool of despair.

693
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:15,479
I know, I know. You were flushed
away down the loo, right?

694
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:21,844
Boo-hoo-hoo. It is so dark,

695
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:25,363
so cold, so terrible!

696
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:27,438
You find my pain funny?

697
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:30,246
I find everyone's pain funny but my own.

698
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:31,965
I'm French.

699
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:34,324
Just get the cable!

700
00:47:35,007 --> 00:47:36,281
Henchfrogs!

701
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:40,877
We have a mission.
Let nothing stand in our way.

702
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:43,481
We leave immediately.

703
00:47:44,607 --> 00:47:46,199
What about dinner?

704
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,876
We leave... in five hours.

705
00:47:55,607 --> 00:48:00,397
Love, love, love, love

706
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:06,159
This is quite tasty.

707
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:07,362
Thanks.

708
00:48:07,447 --> 00:48:11,520
Not too bad, considering I only had
an apple, six raisins and a box of rice.

709
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:13,165
Rice?

710
00:48:14,567 --> 00:48:17,206
What's that urge from deep inside?

711
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:20,165
The need to hurl won't be denied

712
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:24,399
That isn't rice
That's maggots you're eating

713
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:27,763
Larva, larva, larva...

714
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:32,721
That explains why it all ran to one side
when I put the salt in.

715
00:48:33,447 --> 00:48:34,641
You know...

716
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:37,757
...I think we did pretty well today.

717
00:48:38,487 --> 00:48:43,003
I suppose maybe I misjudged you a bit.
I mean, you're not...

718
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,362
Do I hear an actual compliment coming?

719
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:48,926
- Never mind.
- No, no, no, say it.

720
00:48:50,047 --> 00:48:54,484
You're not the useless, whiny, stuck-up,
pompous, big girl's blouse I thought.

721
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:56,444
There. Was that so hard?

722
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,843
We better get some rest
if we're gonna get you home tomorrow.

723
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,360
Catch.

724
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:08,678
Tell me about yourself, Roddy.

725
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:11,967
Well, there's not much to tell.

726
00:49:12,287 --> 00:49:16,485
You know all about me, warts and all.
I don't even know what you do.

727
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,125
I'm...

728
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:19,640
I'm in a boy band.

729
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:22,517
Yeah. Yeah, I'm the posh one.

730
00:49:23,247 --> 00:49:24,999
I'm serious.

731
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,841
Tell me about your life Up Top.
Friends, family.

732
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,597
You do have a family, don't you?

733
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:37,363
Of course I do. Brothers, sisters,
cousins. We're quite a clan.

734
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:39,324
You wouldn't believe the fun we have.

735
00:49:39,407 --> 00:49:43,161
Hanging out at the movies,
playing golf, going skiing.

736
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:45,636
It's just so great!

737
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,762
No wonder you want to get home.

738
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:50,995
Yeah.

739
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:55,126
Well, I guess tomorrow
we'll both get what we want.

740
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,446
Good night.

741
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,926
Good night, Roddy.

742
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:03,921
Good night.

743
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:06,366
Good night.

744
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:08,202
Good night.

745
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:09,561
Good night.

746
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:11,046
Good night.

747
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:13,482
Good night, Roddy.

748
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:15,637
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

749
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:38,638
Wakey-wakey!

750
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:40,365
Getting close to Kensington.

751
00:50:40,447 --> 00:50:43,644
Tie down anything loose.
It'll be a bumpy ride.

752
00:50:43,727 --> 00:50:45,558
Aye, aye, captain.

753
00:50:56,967 --> 00:50:59,242
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

754
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:01,246
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

755
00:51:01,327 --> 00:51:02,680
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

756
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:03,961
Bonjour!

757
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:06,003
Who invited you onboard?

758
00:51:06,087 --> 00:51:08,362
Hop it. Hop it!

759
00:51:09,247 --> 00:51:12,717
The English little girly,
she's so aggressive.

760
00:51:13,647 --> 00:51:14,921
Le Frog.

761
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:18,520
I like a woman with a little fire.

762
00:51:21,087 --> 00:51:25,000
You're going to pay for that,
my little chocolate croissant!

763
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:29,126
But first,
a word from our sponsor. Marcel?

764
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,641
I should have known.

765
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:49,083
Well done, Le Frog! I salute you, sir.

766
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:52,566
Now then, Rita, hand it over.

767
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:53,841
Hand what over?

768
00:51:55,327 --> 00:51:58,364
This dance of deception must end.

769
00:51:58,447 --> 00:52:01,245
Return what you have stolen from me.

770
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,079
Enough dancing!

771
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:06,125
I don't have it anymore.
It was a fake anyway.

772
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,356
What?

773
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:09,918
Oh, the ruby.

774
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:17,997
He's cuckoo, but family.

775
00:52:18,087 --> 00:52:19,759
Oh, this is rich.

776
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:22,520
The ruby was a pretty thing.

777
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:26,120
Stop that.

778
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:29,882
But nothing when compared
to the master cable.

779
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,037
The master what?

780
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,276
The cab...

781
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:34,846
Turn.

782
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:41,283
The cable!
The one you're now wearing as a belt.

783
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,358
- If that's all he wants...
- Hang on.

784
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:45,438
What do you want it for anyway?

785
00:52:45,527 --> 00:52:49,725
Oh, you'll see, come
the World Cup Final this afternoon.

786
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:52,921
The World Cup Final?

787
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,755
OK, OK, cousin, take a breath.
Leave it to me.

788
00:52:55,847 --> 00:52:58,998
We'll get your cable, kill the rodents,
then me and my team

789
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:01,078
can settle down to a decent breakfast.

790
00:53:02,207 --> 00:53:04,118
OK, men, to action!

791
00:53:04,207 --> 00:53:06,243
We surrender!

792
00:53:06,327 --> 00:53:10,161
No, not that one, you idiots!
The kung fu thing!

793
00:53:14,487 --> 00:53:15,920
I've got a plan.

794
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:20,316
Go for it.

795
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,681
Fly at twelve o'clock!

796
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:24,356
Oh, bother.

797
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,478
Fools! Grab them!

798
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:37,444
Le Frog! No! Get that cable!

799
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:38,721
Mon Dieu!

800
00:53:38,807 --> 00:53:41,196
You rats, this is not over yet!

801
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:45,357
Roddy! The rapids!

802
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:48,765
Oh, no!

803
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:58,882
En garde!

804
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:03,562
Rita? We're going over!

805
00:54:03,647 --> 00:54:05,239
Do something!

806
00:54:26,367 --> 00:54:27,516
Gotcha!

807
00:54:33,327 --> 00:54:35,443
Au revoir, mon chri!

808
00:54:35,527 --> 00:54:37,677
Take your flippers off me!

809
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:42,724
I have triumphed!

810
00:54:42,807 --> 00:54:47,244
You stupid English, with your
Yorkshire puddings and chips and fish,

811
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:51,161
you thought you could
defeat Le Frog? Un...

812
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:55,676
...deux...

813
00:54:57,847 --> 00:54:58,996
...trois!

814
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:05,358
Nibble for your life!

815
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:15,005
My belt, I think.

816
00:55:15,087 --> 00:55:17,362
You rodents!

817
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:22,157
Goodbye, Jammy, me old mate.

818
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:37,598
We're OK, we're OK, we're OK, we're OK.

819
00:55:37,687 --> 00:55:39,757
Try opening your eyes!

820
00:55:43,447 --> 00:55:44,926
We're over Kensington!

821
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:49,717
Yeah, only a terrifying 900-foot drop
between you and a nice comfortable bed.

822
00:55:49,807 --> 00:55:51,365
Where's your house then?

823
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,199
Right, now. Let me see...

824
00:55:53,687 --> 00:55:56,884
Inverness Gardens, Vicarage Gate,
Kensington High Street.

825
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:58,366
Try and go left.

826
00:55:58,447 --> 00:56:00,438
That's it. Now go right.

827
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:02,839
This is gonna be tricky.

828
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:05,521
Yeah, and everything else
has been a piece of cake.

829
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,325
All right, here we go.

830
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:11,962
Forty-five, 47, 49...

831
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:13,566
...now!

832
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:25,725
Well, I've had softer landings.

833
00:56:31,007 --> 00:56:32,122
We did it.

834
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:34,365
I'm home.

835
00:56:34,447 --> 00:56:37,962
The crew of the Jammy Dodger survives!

836
00:56:38,047 --> 00:56:39,605
Yep.

837
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:41,522
Rita?

838
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:47,761
Oh, of course.
I'm such an idiot. The Dodger.

839
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:49,565
Wasn't your fault, Rod.

840
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:52,363
Quite an adventure, though, wasn't it?

841
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:54,961
Rita, I am so sorry.

842
00:56:56,487 --> 00:56:59,604
But I think I might be able
to cheer you up.

843
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:05,518
Ta-da! As promised,
the Kensington jewels.

844
00:57:06,327 --> 00:57:08,522
A genuine star-cut ruby.

845
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,360
It's just beautiful!

846
00:57:11,447 --> 00:57:12,960
And the best part?

847
00:57:13,527 --> 00:57:14,846
Unbreakable.

848
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:20,924
I don't know what to say.

849
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:24,317
You think it will be enough?
I mean, to take care of your family?

850
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:30,358
And maybe this could be
the Jammy Dodger Mark Two.

851
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:39,203
Well...

852
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:42,318
...I suppose this is it.

853
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:45,719
Thank you... for the lift.

854
00:57:45,807 --> 00:57:47,604
You're welcome.

855
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,519
- Roddy?
- Yes.

856
00:57:51,607 --> 00:57:55,361
I don't suppose you'd have time
to give me a quick tour?

857
00:57:55,447 --> 00:57:56,436
Of course.

858
00:57:56,527 --> 00:57:58,677
I'd love to meet your family.

859
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:03,440
Hello?

860
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:06,920
Hello, hello, hello? Anybody home?

861
00:58:07,007 --> 00:58:09,441
Wouldn't you know it?
All out, every one of them.

862
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,801
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

863
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:19,686
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

864
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:23,197
That's my master bedroom.

865
00:58:23,287 --> 00:58:26,040
- It's a cage.
- No! It's not, actually.

866
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,719
Then why the lock and bars?

867
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:31,436
That's my... home security system.

868
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:36,764
So much to see,
so little time to see it in. Shall we?

869
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,246
Roddy.

870
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:42,161
You're all alone up here, aren't you?

871
00:58:45,527 --> 00:58:47,483
Goal!

872
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:48,716
Who's that?

873
00:58:49,847 --> 00:58:52,725
That would be... my brother!

874
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:55,605
What a game! I can't believe it!

875
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:58,804
He shoots! He scores!
Back of the net! Group hug.

876
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:03,003
- Oh, hello.
- Rita, this is...

877
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:04,315
...Rupert!
- What?

878
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:06,602
Rupert, this is Rita. She's been

879
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:10,282
so looking forward
to meeting my brother.

880
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:13,400
Obviously, there's not
a huge family resemblance.

881
00:59:13,487 --> 00:59:17,526
I rather got the brains and...
Well, actually, I got the looks too,

882
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:19,802
but we're very close,
aren't we, Rupert?

883
00:59:20,167 --> 00:59:22,965
Well, how time flies
when you're having fun! Still...

884
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:24,446
On with the tour, shall we?

885
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,676
Hello, Sid.

886
00:59:25,767 --> 00:59:27,439
Hello, Rita.

887
00:59:27,527 --> 00:59:30,599
- How's your dad?
- Better, yeah. Thanks for asking.

888
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,245
Rupert?

889
00:59:33,847 --> 00:59:36,884
What was that all about?
Come here, you poor little thing.

890
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:40,755
Look at his little face.
You ever seen anything so pathetic?

891
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:42,485
Brothers?

892
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,039
All Mr Lonely has got
is a couple of dolls

893
00:59:47,127 --> 00:59:49,925
and a little wheel
to run around in his cage.

894
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,963
This is too sweet!

895
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,119
What a loser!

896
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:02,278
It's OK, Roddy.

897
01:00:04,207 --> 01:00:05,481
OK?

898
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:09,845
Look at this place, Rita.
Look at my home. It's a palace!

899
01:00:09,927 --> 01:00:13,442
I can do whatever I want
whenever I want to.

900
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,439
I'd say that's a little more
than OK, wouldn't you?

901
01:00:16,527 --> 01:00:19,678
What do I need a family for?
What do I need friends for?

902
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:23,959
I'm sorry, but if you have
everything you need, then...

903
01:00:24,047 --> 01:00:28,484
...I really have to get going. I have
a serious infestation to deal with.

904
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:32,726
I'll say goodbye, then...

905
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:36,244
...Roddy St. James...

906
01:00:36,327 --> 01:00:38,204
...of Kensington.

907
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,517
Lonely

908
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:15,121
I'm Mr Lonely

909
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:17,846
I have nobody

910
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:20,919
For my own

911
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:28,476
Only ten minutes left until halftime.

912
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:31,206
Come on, England! This is fantastic!

913
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,199
A rare attack here by Germany,
but it comes to very little.

914
01:01:35,287 --> 01:01:39,883
Come here, bro!
Rupert's missing his Rodsy-Wodsy.

915
01:01:41,807 --> 01:01:43,559
Here, have a cheese puff.

916
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,559
Have another.

917
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:48,205
Here you go.

918
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,847
No! Duh.
You're supposed to eat them.

919
01:01:50,927 --> 01:01:53,077
Move... over.

920
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,556
- What?
- Move over!

921
01:01:56,527 --> 01:01:59,121
I'll take some of that.

922
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:04,036
Word of advice, mate.
Take it easy with the drink, seriously,

923
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:06,800
or you'll never make it to halftime.

924
01:02:09,007 --> 01:02:10,235
What did you say?

925
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:13,644
The bathroom.
I'm waiting till halftime.

926
01:02:13,727 --> 01:02:15,843
I don't want to miss any of the game.

927
01:02:15,927 --> 01:02:19,283
Halftime. He's waiting till halftime!

928
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:22,245
Those floodgates won't hold forever!

929
01:02:22,887 --> 01:02:25,355
No! Not the master cable!

930
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,524
What do you want it for anyway?

931
01:02:27,607 --> 01:02:31,759
Oh, you'll see, come
the World Cup Final this afternoon.

932
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,727
Half... time.

933
01:02:36,687 --> 01:02:40,475
Half... time.

934
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:44,037
Of course. That's The Toad's plan!
That's why he needs the cable!

935
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:47,358
When everyone goes to the toilet,
the city will be flushed away!

936
01:02:47,447 --> 01:02:49,039
Come with me.

937
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:51,444
What about the game?

938
01:02:51,527 --> 01:02:53,279
And what a game it is!

939
01:02:53,367 --> 01:02:56,245
Oh, a nasty fall there for Ray Bowers.

940
01:02:56,327 --> 01:02:58,318
Can you see all right, Fergus?

941
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,760
Yes, thanks, Mum.

942
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:04,079
Where's your helmets? Which one's
the quarterback? Pick up the ball!

943
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:07,398
These Brits don't know
the first thing about football.

944
01:03:09,007 --> 01:03:12,636
Enjoy your last moments,
you egregious vermin.

945
01:03:12,727 --> 01:03:15,036
I've got Rita, boss! I've got Rita!

946
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:18,119
Get off me, you lab reject!

947
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:19,720
Ha! You missed.

948
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,205
Ah, Rita.

949
01:03:25,287 --> 01:03:28,165
It's so good of you to return the cable.

950
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:29,875
Bonjour.

951
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:36,165
At last! It's mine!

952
01:03:42,447 --> 01:03:44,358
Just take it.

953
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,960
Let there be light!

954
01:03:57,047 --> 01:04:00,676
Please don't flush me, Roddy!
I can't survive down there!

955
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,201
I've gone soft!

956
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:05,755
Sid, I want you to flush me.
I'm going back.

957
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:06,882
Back?

958
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:10,084
Rita's in terrible danger.
Everyone's in terrible danger!

959
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:11,839
Now, you like it here, don't you?

960
01:04:11,927 --> 01:04:15,397
Oh, yes, Roddy.
I like it here very much.

961
01:04:15,487 --> 01:04:18,843
And if I leave you, will you be good
to Tabitha, the little girl?

962
01:04:18,927 --> 01:04:23,205
I'll be as good as gold to her, Roddy.
And I will be the best pet ever!

963
01:04:23,287 --> 01:04:24,686
Then the place is all yours.

964
01:04:24,767 --> 01:04:26,200
- Sweet!
- Great.

965
01:04:26,287 --> 01:04:29,484
Let's get the bubbles going.
I've got a big job to do down there.

966
01:04:29,567 --> 01:04:31,398
Right away, sir!

967
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:33,156
So long, Sid.

968
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:37,559
So long, Rodnick Saint Something
of Someplace or other.

969
01:04:37,647 --> 01:04:39,399
Geronimo!

970
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:45,721
And, lo, a chosen one
shall come down from above,

971
01:04:45,807 --> 01:04:49,686
and he shall be our savior
from the Great Flood!

972
01:04:51,407 --> 01:04:52,635
I'm terribly sorry.

973
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:56,003
Just two minutes left till halftime!
Incredible!

974
01:04:56,087 --> 01:04:58,157
- It's a fantasy start for England.
- Rita!

975
01:04:58,247 --> 01:05:00,636
England leads Germany
by three goals to one.

976
01:05:00,727 --> 01:05:03,719
What an amazing game
this is turning out to be!

977
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:05,957
The grand opening.

978
01:05:14,927 --> 01:05:17,885
And the referee again
has to bring play to a halt.

979
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:19,436
Rita!

980
01:05:19,527 --> 01:05:21,916
Fans for the fans!

981
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:25,363
Extra! Pied Piper
lures thousands to their death!

982
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:27,517
Balloons!

983
01:05:34,047 --> 01:05:35,526
Rita!

984
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:40,282
Rita!

985
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:41,356
Roddy!

986
01:05:41,447 --> 01:05:45,076
I'm sorry. I've been such a fool.
You were right about me and everything.

987
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:48,921
I should have admitted it, but I was
afraid you wouldn't like me anymore.

988
01:05:49,007 --> 01:05:51,680
Do you think we can talk
about this after you rescue me?

989
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:54,281
Of course. There's no time.
When that whistle blows

990
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:57,564
and everyone Up Top goes to the toilet,
it'll flush away the city.

991
01:05:57,647 --> 01:05:59,683
I know. And my family
are all down there.

992
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:01,200
We've got to warn everyone.

993
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:02,720
Stop them!

994
01:06:11,047 --> 01:06:12,162
Oh, dear.

995
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,006
Whoa! Whitey!

996
01:06:20,327 --> 01:06:23,080
I saw an opportunity and I seized it.

997
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:28,360
So you thought you could
make a fool of The Toad, eh?

998
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:32,478
You don't need us for that.

999
01:06:32,567 --> 01:06:35,035
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

1000
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:37,641
Well, I'll be the one laughing

1001
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:41,800
when every last revolting rat
is flushed away!

1002
01:06:41,887 --> 01:06:45,402
For I shall repopulate the city...

1003
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:47,398
...with these!

1004
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:53,002
Nasty.

1005
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:56,602
- Is this the Glorious Amphibian Dawn?
- Anything for you.

1006
01:06:56,687 --> 01:06:57,915
- Can I have a pony?
- No.

1007
01:06:58,007 --> 01:06:59,565
- A puppy?
- We'll talk about it.

1008
01:06:59,647 --> 01:07:01,160
- Can we talk about it now?
- No.

1009
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,477
- Can I have a puppy?
- Me too.

1010
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:06,684
You can't all have puppies!
Please! Daddy's working!

1011
01:07:06,767 --> 01:07:08,962
We need to get down
and pull out that cable.

1012
01:07:09,047 --> 01:07:10,196
How?

1013
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:12,005
It's impossible.

1014
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:16,120
England is winning. Anything's possible.

1015
01:07:19,127 --> 01:07:20,401
Turn it off, Whitey!

1016
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:23,764
- Come on!
- They're getting away!

1017
01:07:26,447 --> 01:07:28,039
Oh. Hi, boss.

1018
01:07:28,847 --> 01:07:31,645
Whitey! They're biting my bottom! Help!

1019
01:07:31,727 --> 01:07:33,445
I'm coming, Spike!

1020
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,083
You fools! Grab them!

1021
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:39,158
Top floor, lingerie, housewares

1022
01:07:39,247 --> 01:07:40,999
and certain doom!

1023
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:57,204
Do I have to do everything myself?!

1024
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:08,759
There goes the whistle for halftime!
We'll be back in a few minutes.

1025
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:13,284
You're too late to do anything!
You and your kind are finished!

1026
01:08:13,367 --> 01:08:17,440
Oh, yeah? Well, come and get us
then, you warty windbag.

1027
01:08:23,887 --> 01:08:25,161
Oh, no!

1028
01:08:38,807 --> 01:08:40,877
The gate. Back this way! Come on!

1029
01:08:42,687 --> 01:08:43,676
Rita!

1030
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:45,962
If I'm going,
you're both coming with me!

1031
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:47,480
Just go, Roddy!

1032
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,036
That's it.

1033
01:08:56,407 --> 01:08:57,556
Roddy!

1034
01:08:57,647 --> 01:08:59,046
Stop moving!

1035
01:08:59,127 --> 01:09:01,960
Come and get me,
you big, slimy airbag!

1036
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:03,876
Roddy, look out!

1037
01:09:05,927 --> 01:09:06,916
Yes!

1038
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:18,722
Le Frog!

1039
01:09:24,087 --> 01:09:25,315
Let's finish this.

1040
01:09:25,407 --> 01:09:26,920
Let me go!

1041
01:09:27,007 --> 01:09:29,316
Goodbye, rat!

1042
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:31,199
Rita!

1043
01:09:38,567 --> 01:09:40,125
Feeling a little tongue-tied?

1044
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:41,276
Impossible!

1045
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:42,720
Toodle-oo.

1046
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:54,686
- Wave! Wave!
- England!

1047
01:09:54,767 --> 01:09:57,076
No, giant wave!

1048
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:02,757
Please work. Please work. Please work!

1049
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:26,606
High five!

1050
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:28,726
Oh, yeah.

1051
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:34,238
Look! It's Roddy and Rita!

1052
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:35,760
Good on you, girl!

1053
01:10:35,847 --> 01:10:38,236
Hooray for Millicent Bystander!

1054
01:10:38,327 --> 01:10:39,840
Millicent!

1055
01:10:39,927 --> 01:10:43,317
Millicent! Millicent! Millicent!

1056
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:45,921
You're a hero, Roddy.

1057
01:10:47,487 --> 01:10:48,636
Big deal.

1058
01:10:51,407 --> 01:10:53,125
You wretched vermin!

1059
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,675
I'll make you pay for this!

1060
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:59,646
Give it a rest, cousin.
And get your kids a puppy.

1061
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:03,716
Rita...

1062
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:09,199
...I was wondering, if you do build
a Jammy Dodger Mark Two...

1063
01:11:10,727 --> 01:11:13,719
...you wouldn't happen to need
a first mate, would you?

1064
01:11:18,647 --> 01:11:22,276
Left a good job in the city

1065
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:28,198
Workin' for the man every night and day

1066
01:11:28,607 --> 01:11:29,881
Rollin'

1067
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:32,686
Rollin' on the river

1068
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:36,316
Rollin' on the river

1069
01:11:38,287 --> 01:11:39,276
OK.

1070
01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:48,036
Hello, Tom! Give us a squeeze!

1071
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:53,116
All right, chaps.

1072
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,159
Big wheel keep on turnin'

1073
01:11:56,807 --> 01:11:59,560
Proud Mary keep on burnin'

1074
01:11:59,647 --> 01:12:02,241
Rollin', rollin'

1075
01:12:02,327 --> 01:12:04,238
Rollin' on the river

1076
01:12:11,287 --> 01:12:12,640
All right

1077
01:12:17,807 --> 01:12:19,923
I love a happy ending.

1078
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:24,159
You've gone soft! I like unhappy
endings, with lots of violence.

1079
01:12:27,527 --> 01:12:30,485
Are you happy now, Spike?

1080
01:12:36,367 --> 01:12:38,278
- Shall we?
- Go for it.

1081
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:40,640
Big wheel keep on turnin'

1082
01:12:41,287 --> 01:12:44,040
Proud Mary keep on burnin'

1083
01:12:58,847 --> 01:13:01,964
- Where are we going?
- I have no idea.

1084
01:13:02,047 --> 01:13:04,800
But we're gonna get there really fast!

1085
01:13:04,887 --> 01:13:07,196
I'm coming, Mr Jones! I'm coming!

1086
01:13:19,887 --> 01:13:22,720
Ah, this is the life.

1087
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:24,678
Roddy, I'm home!

1088
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,076
And I've brought you a new friend!
