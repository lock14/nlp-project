There you are.

177
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,379
Time for his remedies.

178
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,923
Scoot over, child.

179
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,635
VIOLET: 9:00 in the
morning and 7:00 at night.

180
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,763
He takes his pills in powder
form. I'll show you how.

181
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,141
Be sure he drinks it all down.

182
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,394
CAROLINE: What's he taking?
Oh, Coumadin and such.

183
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,522
He gets the tremors sometimes.
Don't let that frighten you.

184
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,276
And a kiss
to make it taste better.

185
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,240
You're scrawnier than I'd
hoped. Prettier, though.

186
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,493
I bet you're all marked up,
aren't you?

187
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,580
Marked up?
Written on.

188
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,415
I know you young people
are always

189
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,584
jabbing yourselves
with ink and needles.

190
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,961
You're written on,
aren't you?

191
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,880
Not where you can see.

192
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,256
Well.

193
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,217
He's to be bathed daily,
his linens changed.

194
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,472
Don't bother with the housework.
I'm the only one that knows how.

195
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,642
How long
have you two lived here?

196
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,604
Let's see.

197
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,816
We came over
from Savannah in '62.

198
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,944
We bought this house
from a brother and a sister.

199
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,490
They'd inherited it a long
time ago, from their parents.

200
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,326
Lived here
since they were children.

201
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,828
There they are.
Martin and Grace.

202
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,289
Charming people.

203
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:43,960
But they fell on hard times,
had to sell.

204
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,670
You keep their picture?

205
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:50,133
Yes. I like to pay my respects
to the memories of this house.

206
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,484
VIOLET:
All right. Come along now.

207
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,951
This is the dining room.

208
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,827
We only use
about half of the rooms.

209
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,163
The others are
for Ben's antique business.

210
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,582
What he couldn't sell,
we stored here.

211
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,335
Except for the attic.

212
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,546
That has crystal and china.

213
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,132
And I keep a very close account
on that, just so as you know.

214
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,763
There are more than
30 rooms in all.

215
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,308
In the old days, they made
a separate key for each room.

216
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,770
For the owner,
they made a skeleton key.

217
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,940
This will open every door.

218
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,900
This one is yours.

219
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,695
I have mine.

220
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,240
Now, the pantry's
right out here.

221
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:59,202
You know, we may have to ask
you to go into town now and then.

222
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,662
Was there a mirror here once?

223
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,418
I noticed in the bathrooms
also there are no mirrors.

224
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,629
Child, when you get as
worn-out and wrinkled as we are,

225
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,256
you don't need
any reminding.

226
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,508
If you want a small one
for your own purposes

227
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,718
that's fine with me.

228
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,470
What'd you do with them?
Put them away.

229
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,353
The boy tells me
you don't smoke.

230
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,399
I do smoke. I smoke a lot
and I enjoy it very much.

231
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,650
I trust that won't
be an issue.

232
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,735
It won't be.

233
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,487
Good. Then for the most part
just realize that

234
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,573
I'll live here as if
you're not in residence.

235
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,160
After all, we're not kin.
Are your parents still alive?

236
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,996
My mom left when I was little.

237
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,082
My dad raised me
and he died last year.

238
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,294
Oh, my. So you cared
for him as well?

239
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,921
I would have.

240
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,758
I just thought
I had more time.

241
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,641
You think too much about
the time you have left,

242
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,518
you don't spend it living.

243
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,397

Oh, fiddlesticks.
Do me a blessing, child.

257
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,749
Will you run up
to the attic for me?

258
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,211
I have some seed packets in a

for the house.

271
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,023
There's a door in the attic
it doesn't work for.

272
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:24,068
Oh, no, the attic,
it's never opened that.

273
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,197
I got my Dixie-Johns.
Why not?

274
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,492

to ask him, child.

to him, won't you?

00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,635
I admire you.

351
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,263
You know, what you do.

352
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,516
Hell, I wouldn't be able to
take care of my own parents.

353
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,767
You'd regret it.

354
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,062
I quit college to help out
with some friends' bands.

355
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,316
Out all night,
always on the road.

356
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,319
My father thought
I was throwing my life away.

357
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,613
So we didn't talk,
didn't visit.

358
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,949
Stubborn and proud,
and that's how we left it.

Yeah.

361
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,459
He was gone before
I even knew he was sick.

362
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,924
I guess he wanted to spare me
from all this.

363
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,802
Is that so wrong?

364
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,806
No one should have
to die alone.

365
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,896
So tell me
what you were gonna tell me.

366
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,230
About Ben.

367
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,490

368
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:10,993
he's asking you
for help?

are getting acquainted.

only woman in my life.

378
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,356
I know no such things,
and remove your perspirations.

379
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,651

And New Orleans is its home.
It started here.

429

shops at a place in Algiers.

Look, you said the house
had a history, right?

431
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,792
Hoodoo is pretty harmless.
Harmless how?

432
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,461
It's psychological,

476
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,238
About 90 years ago

477
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,408
there was a banker here,
his name was Thorpe.

478
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,745
He made his fortune
cheating the poor.

479
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,665
He was a mean man.
He was a cruel man.

480

and couple of servants

and Papa Justify.

man Thorpe, he didn't know

00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,101
that Papa Justify was
a "two-headed doctor. "

485
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,814
He was a conjure man.
So was Cecile.

486
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,442
They believed in...
Hoodoo.

487
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,113
Yeah.

488
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,118
That was their room.

489
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,459
They were famous
all through the bayous.

490
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,130
They healed the sick
and they hurt the mean.

"Hit a straight lick with a
crooked stick," as the coloreds say.

492
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,805
But old Thorpe,
he just saw them as help.

493
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,725
And he worked them
to the bone.

494
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,643
He abused them.

495
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,148

as the story goes

496
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,151
there was a party.

Politicians, sugar barons,
riverboat tycoons.

499
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,207
There was a lot of drinking
and dancing

500
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,627
and a couple of trysts,
I'm sure.

501
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,507
And then, finally, when
it was time to say farewell

502
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,844
some of the guests wanted to
wish goodbye to the children.

503
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,306
But nobody could find them.
They hadn't seen them in hours.

504
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,726
So, being all full of brandy,
they made it a game.
