1
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,252
Are they here yet?

2
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:46,888
Hey, little sleepy head.

3
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,748
Because I'm ready.

4
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,882
You really are ready,
aren't you?

5
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:00,396
Whoa, whoa!
Wait a second! Your coat!

6
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,759
We're all ready for you.

7
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,653
Just need that balloon
payment to unload.

8
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:28,003
We have it. It's just they
called Troy from Titus last night.

9
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:29,956
The ski place?

10
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,774
Do you have the $4,372 or not?

11
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:37,036
It was some emergency
with the lift.

12
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:38,478
And he just took
off out of here

13
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,064
without thinking,
with the money.

14
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:42,216
Completely forgot
you were coming.

15
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,466
So as soon as he gets back...

16
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:45,870
When's he getting back?

17
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:48,456
When you come with the other half,
I'll have it.

18
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,561
You don't get the other half
until I get the cash.

19
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,867
This is the second time
you've dragged me out here.

20
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:55,790
If you can't come up
with it by Christmas,

21
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:58,605
you've lost your
$1,500 deposit.

22
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:01,164
Look, Mr. Versailles,

23
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,588
I've got a good job
at Yankee One Dollar.

24
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:06,250
They're probably going to make
me manager right after Christmas,

25
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,937
so I can definitely
make the payments

26
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,284
if you just leave the house.

27
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,182
Just call me when you have
the balloon payment.

28
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,319
I'll call you.

29
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,846
Where are they going?

30
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,887
I'll get it back.
I promise.

31
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:41,096
You got to get
ready for school.

32
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,249
You're going to miss the bus.

33
00:04:42,288 --> 00:04:44,394
I can get a job, you know.

34
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:45,838
You're 15, T.J.

35
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:47,149
They won't ask any questions.

36
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,613
You're finishing school.

37
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,672
Mom, you think
we can make a living

38
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,014
on what you make
at Yankee Dollar?

39
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:54,889
You're going to school.

40
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,816
I bet I could make
more than you do.

41
00:05:02,192 --> 00:05:04,101
Where's Daddy?

42
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,382
He'll be back.

43
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,302
Aren't we even
going to look for him?

44
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,125
I'm going to work,
and you're going to school.

45
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,273
What, that's it?

46
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,904
Where did he go?

47
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:15,312
On a business trip.

48
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,231
When is he coming home?

49
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:18,574
I don't know, Ricky.

50
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:21,096
I can't believe you're not
even going to look for him.

51
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:22,511
Where? Where do I look?

52
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:23,973
The reservation!

53
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:27,148
He's probably
in Atlantic City by now.

54
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,654
The glove compartment,
that was so stupid.

55
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:34,345
You're going to school.

56
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:36,750
There you go.

57
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:41,100
Hey. Lunch money.

58
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:47,084
Okay.

59
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:50,927
Go on. You're going
to miss the bus.

60
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,201
Oh, fuck.

61
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:41,134
Your next number,
under the O, 66.

62
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,610
Your next number is B8.

63
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,391
Thank you.

64
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:05,771
You're listening to
C- Tribe Radio all day long,

65
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:08,297
number one for music
and information.

66
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,377
Joining me once again is Kenny.
Good morning, Kenny.

67
00:07:10,418 --> 00:07:12,588
Good morning, and
number one for entertainment, as well.

68
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,600
Absolutely.

69
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:17,293
You know, one of the things I like
talking about is local entertainment,

70
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:19,980
and it seems like the Johnson
boys are getting back together,

71
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:21,610
and it looks like
they're gonna be doing

72
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,959
a performance over
at the St. Patrick's Church...

73
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:27,473
Fill it up?

74
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:30,375
No. Just three...

75
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,192
Two, three, four.
$2.74, please.

76
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:35,600
$2.74.

77
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:38,994
No, make that $7.74.

78
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,586
Okay.

79
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:48,625
Did you see a Dodge Spirit
in here last night? Dark green?

80
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:50,151
Spirit? No.

81
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:51,338
But I only worked
until 9:00.

82
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:53,233
You can try asking inside,
if you want.

83
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,372
No, that's okay.

84
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:58,442
Have a nice day.

85
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:02,672
Are made by the
children, and the gifts are only $5.

86
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:04,365
It's all about the kids.

87
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:05,612
Yeah, it's all
about the kids. All the time.

88
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,374
And also...

89
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:29,351
Thank you.

90
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:41,643
Afternoon session is over.

91
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,111
The next session
starts at 6:30.

92
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:44,235
I don't want to play.

93
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,616
I just need to look
around for a second.

94
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,018
You have to pay the $5.

95
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:49,229
Look, I'll stand at the door.

96
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,609
I won't even go inside.

97
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:52,977
I just need to see
if my husband's in there.

98
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:55,400
You have to pay the admission.

99
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:00,529
He's gambling away
the money for our house.

100
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,306
What does he look like?

101
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,134
Long, brown hair.
Tall. Skinny.

102
00:09:08,178 --> 00:09:09,291
Ponytail.

103
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,956
No. He's not in there.

104
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:13,355
Can I just look?

105
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:16,657
Lady, I just told you,
he's not in there.

106
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:33,009
Hey!

107
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:36,140
Hey! Hello! Hey!

108
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:14,601
That's my car.

109
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,793
What are you doing with my car?

110
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,745
That? I found it.

111
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,674
You stole it?
Had the keys in it.

112
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,359
And so you just took it?

113
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:30,514
We'll see what the troopers
have to say about that!

114
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,554
Go ahead. They got
no jurisdiction here.

115
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:34,898
This is Mohawk territory.

116
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:39,211
Troy?

117
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:41,618
You in there?

118
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,809
If you are,
you better come out.

119
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,950
Versailles says that if we get
the money to him by Christmas,

120
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:49,842
we won't lose our deposit.

121
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,698
I think we need
to talk about this, Troy.

122
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:53,804
Come on out.

123
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,046
Troy?

124
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,059
I mean it, honey.
Come on out.

125
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:10,761
The Tribal Police don't like people
shooting holes in other people's houses.

126
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:15,245
This is New York State, so quit the
bullshit and give me my goddamn keys!

127
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:44,043
This camper belongs
to my brother-in-law.

128
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:45,394
He won't like this.

129
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,086
Then you should
quit stealing cars.

130
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,816
I thought it was abandoned.

131
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:51,123
The guy driving it
got on a bus.

132
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,710
A bus? To where?

133
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:57,427
New York. Buffalo.
I'm not sure.

134
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,619
Hello? Yeah, what is it?

135
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:08,948
Well, there's a hard-boiled egg
in the fridge.

136
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,988
Well, then take out the yolk.

137
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:16,206
Look, T.J., I don't have
time for this right now.

138
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,346
No. I'm not looking
for him.

139
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,291
I got to go.

140
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,177
Shit!

141
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:53,171
I'm not leaving it.

142
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,053
I got a friend
who might buy that.

143
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:57,493
It's not for sale.

144
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:00,788
He'll pay more than
it's worth. Maybe 2,000.

145
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,511
Why's that?

146
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:04,495
He's a smuggler.

147
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,397
He's always looking for cars
with button-release trunks.

148
00:13:09,366 --> 00:13:12,399
You don't need
papers or anything.

149
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:15,563
Where does he live?

150
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:17,875
Through the woods.
Not far.

151
00:13:17,909 --> 00:13:19,732
What's in it for you?

152
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:23,245
He'll give me something
for finding it.

153
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,770
If you try anything,
I'm not afraid to use this.

154
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:32,687
Yeah.

155
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:49,259
Turn up there.
Where?

156
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,309
Up at those trees.

157
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:53,587
There's no road.

158
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:55,629
There's a path.

159
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,230
It's not far.

160
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,307
I'm not crossing that.

161
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:11,277
Don't worry.
There's no black ice.

162
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,068
That's Canada.

163
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,932
That's Mohawk land.

164
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,519
The rez is on both
sides of the river.

165
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:18,769
What about the border patrol?

166
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:20,782
There's no border.

167
00:14:21,847 --> 00:14:23,668
I'm still not crossing that.

168
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,131
Don't worry.
It'll hold a Spirit.

169
00:14:25,176 --> 00:14:27,379
I've seen semis cross it.

170
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:30,772
The only other way is
the Cornwall Bridge,

171
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:33,524
and they're not going
to let you take that.

172
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,345
They plow it and everything.

173
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,292
This is so fucking stupid.

174
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,221
Better pick up some speed
to get up the bank.

175
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:34,517
It's just on the other
side of those trees.

176
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,760
Honk the horn.

177
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:08,721
No.

178
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,924
Keep your mouth shut.
Just keep it shut. Okay?

179
00:16:12,793 --> 00:16:14,384
Thunder, shut up!

180
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:16,758
Get back under there!

181
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:22,958
He don't like whites, Lila.

182
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,495
Sorry.
And you're late.

183
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:25,845
I'm sorry.

184
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:28,499
I shouldn't even
be dealing with you.

185
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,549
Count it.

186
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:31,631
What's going on here?

187
00:16:31,673 --> 00:16:33,395
Just count it.

188
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,754
Come on. How much?

189
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:43,790
How much is there?

190
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,994
1,200.

191
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:55,254
Who the fuck are they?

192
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,582
Never mind.

193
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:01,005
I'm not going anywhere until
those people get out of my trunk.

194
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:03,437
I'll give you half.
Now, let's go.

195
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,528
Let's go!

196
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:05,998
I'm not taking them
across the border.

197
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,699
It's a crime.
There's no border here.

198
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,525
This is free trade
between nations.

199
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,576
This isn't a nation.

200
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,176
Let's go.

201
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,132
Why'd your husband leave you?

202
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:35,510
Fuck you.

203
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:38,163
Maybe he wanted
a younger woman.

204
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:41,233
That's what usually happens.

205
00:17:41,272 --> 00:17:44,339
I never have to worry about that.
My husband's dead.

206
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:47,278
He went down
in the river on a run.

207
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:49,328
They never found him.

208
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,566
Probably tangled in the
river weeds somewhere.

209
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:54,029
You better slow down.
There's ruts out here.

210
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,440
You could get us stuck in one.

211
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,974
Keep going.

212
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:06,679
Keep going.

213
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,208
What if the troopers stop us?

214
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,730
They're not going to stop you.
You're white.

215
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,385
Stop and wait for him
to come to the window.

216
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:55,448
Roll down your window.

217
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,161
Count it.

218
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:09,715
1,200.

219
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,361
Let's go.

220
00:19:27,674 --> 00:19:29,779
Stop at those trees.

221
00:19:36,026 --> 00:19:38,164
Now open the door.

222
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:40,339
Open it!

223
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:42,707
Now get out.

224
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,055
You can't have my car.
Get out!

225
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,807
You can't have
my car. No!

226
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:33,840
I told you not to use that
thing when I'm not here.

227
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:36,403
If I get it working,
I can sell it.

228
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:40,119
I don't care. Don't use
that thing when I'm not here!

229
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:43,730
Rent-to-Own called.

230
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,852
They said they're
coming to get the TV

231
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:47,280
if you don't pay
by 4:00 tomorrow.

232
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,124
Did you find him?

233
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:53,270
No.

234
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,986
Where was the car?

235
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:58,394
At the bus stop on the rez.

236
00:20:58,427 --> 00:20:59,672
I bet he went to Atlantic City.

237
00:20:59,707 --> 00:21:00,787
You don't know that.

238
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,354
Yeah, well, you can find out.

239
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,434
Go to the bus station, see what
buses came through last night.

240
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:05,970
And what?
Chase him across the country?

241
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:07,987
Miss work? No.

242
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,684
What happened to your head?

243
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:15,348
Nothing.

244
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:17,624
What, did you get
in a fight with somebody?

245
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,351
It was no big deal.

246
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:21,656
Wait.
You got in a fight?

247
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:25,074
Some Indian chick
tried to steal your dad's car.

248
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:30,390
No way. I say we go back there
and kick some Mohawk ass.

249
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,117
It doesn't matter.

250
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:33,749
Where's your car?

251
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,861
I'll get it tomorrow.

252
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,394
Did you and Ricky eat?

253
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:38,298
That would be
kind of miraculous,

254
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:39,794
since there's
no food in the house.

255
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:41,429
There's food.

256
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,410
Popcorn and TANG?

257
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:14,778
Hi, Lila.
Hi, Mick.

258
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:16,601
How's life at the Bingo Palace?

259
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,125
Good. How's business?

260
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:21,433
Oh, you know.
It's okay.

261
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:24,660
How much for the Sierra?

262
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,748
Come on, Lila.

263
00:22:25,788 --> 00:22:27,643
What? I've been saving up.

264
00:22:27,675 --> 00:22:29,846
You know what.

265
00:22:29,884 --> 00:22:31,707
Does Bernie Littlewolf
run your whole life?

266
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,596
No, but he told me
not to sell you a car.

267
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:36,213
I got to walk up 37 with
semis kicking up snow and mud

268
00:22:36,252 --> 00:22:38,107
in my hair just to get to work.

269
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:41,883
For you, all's I got is
the Civic and the Sundance.

270
00:22:43,036 --> 00:22:45,010
I don't like Civics.

271
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:46,875
I figured.

272
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:51,291
Look, I'll give you
$1,000 for the Sierra.

273
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:52,884
Nothing with a trunk.

274
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:55,096
That thing's been sitting
out there for six months.

275
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:57,304
I don't want Bernie
in my face. Okay?

276
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,381
He doesn't have to know.

277
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:39,669
Chance!

278
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,005
Come back in here before
you freeze your ass off!

279
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:49,236
Chance!

280
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,237
Mommy?

281
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:31,154
What's going to happen to our old
house when we get our new house?

282
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,948
They're going to flatten it
and send it to China.

283
00:24:33,982 --> 00:24:35,805
Then what?

284
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:39,929
They're going to melt it down
and make it into little toys.

285
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:41,723
Then what?

286
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,969
Then they're going
to send them back here

287
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:45,941
so I can sell them
at Yankee Dollar.

288
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,160
Can you get me some?

289
00:24:47,806 --> 00:24:49,627
That's right.
Yes!

290
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:05,107
I'm not eating
this again for dinner.

291
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:08,663
We just have to make it
till my paycheck on Friday.

292
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,363
What about Rent-to-Own?

293
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:11,924
What about them?

294
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,176
They said they're
coming to get the TV

295
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:14,971
if they don't get
a payment by 4:00.

296
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,413
You told me that already.

297
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:18,388
I know.

298
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:31,028
Here.

299
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:35,800
Lunch money.

300
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,391
I still don't see why you won't
just let me get a job with Mitch.

301
00:25:38,431 --> 00:25:39,924
Who's Mitch?

302
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:42,236
He's got this whole business
he runs at school.

303
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,895
He sells pot to kids?

304
00:25:43,934 --> 00:25:47,034
No, Mom, it's computers. Okay?
He fixes computers.

305
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,413
You're 15.

306
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,656
It's not going to happen,
so forget it.

307
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:51,353
This is so stupid!
We're going to lose the TV,

308
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:53,179
while I'm sitting in some Christmas
assembly when I could be out...

309
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:54,741
Your job is looking
after your brother.

310
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:57,269
Who's going to
take care of him?

311
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:05,497
Come on, we're going.

312
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:08,983
Take them with you, honey.
You need them at recess.

313
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:12,894
I still say we go
down to the rez,

314
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:15,511
get the Sentra and
kick some serious butt.

315
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,395
Matt? Could I talk
to you for a minute?

316
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:50,740
I need to come
on full-time.

317
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:53,374
I see you
as a short-timer.

318
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:54,878
What is that?

319
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:57,083
Not here for long,
not really committed.

320
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,388
When I started working here, you
told me it would be six months

321
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:01,310
before I could
come on full-time.

322
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:02,936
That was almost two years ago.

323
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:04,220
That's my opinion.

324
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,053
You know, I mean,
at least I show up.

325
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:11,707
Pat's always late.
She's late now. Late every day.

326
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,377
See you tomorrow.
See you.

327
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:16,821
I want my half.

328
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:22,109
You hear me.
I want my half.

329
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:26,326
I'll give you the money
if you give me the car.

330
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,059
No way.

331
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:32,284
The money's gone.

332
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:40,728
Then I want to get
more of those Chinese.

333
00:28:52,258 --> 00:28:55,038
It's going to cost me
to get that hole fixed.

334
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:56,832
I froze last night.

335
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:58,773
Look, I just need enough
for the balloon payment

336
00:28:58,817 --> 00:29:02,527
for my doublewide, and then I'm
out of this. I'm no criminal.

337
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,449
It's not a crime.

338
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,692
You people can call it
what you want.

339
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:08,183
I just want my double.

340
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:16,544
I don't usually
work with whites.

341
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:23,612
How many bedrooms?

342
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,788
Three. I got kids.

343
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:27,936
How old?

344
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,141
Five and 15.

345
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:32,064
I got a boy.

346
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:33,919
Almost one.

347
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:37,403
He lives with
my mother-in-law.

348
00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:39,484
She stole him from me.

349
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,829
Stole him?

350
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:43,681
Yeah. Right out
of the hospital.

351
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,852
Did you call the cops?

352
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:50,586
Tribal Police don't get
involved in stuff like that.

353
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,305
Get under there!

354
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:07,067
Bernie was asking if I'd
seen you. I told him no.

355
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,000
Thanks.

356
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:09,626
I don't want any
trouble from him, Lila.

357
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:11,454
Don't worry about it.

358
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,377
This guy's been
calling all morning.

359
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,101
He's got two by the old tires.

360
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:16,599
Okay.

361
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,016
What's going on?

362
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:24,253
We got to pick them up.

363
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,868
What the hell is going on?

364
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,729
Keep that thing down.

365
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:02,972
Roll down the window.
See what he wants.

366
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:06,142
- What's going on here?
- Just roll it down.

367
00:31:08,258 --> 00:31:10,527
They don't like
the women driver.

368
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:11,872
Count it.

369
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:13,816
Pop the trunk.

370
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,079
Pop the trunk!

371
00:31:17,506 --> 00:31:18,586
1,200.

372
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,056
Hey!

373
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,537
Get in.

374
00:31:32,482 --> 00:31:34,306
Open it.

375
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,492
This should keep
them from running.

376
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:52,319
Why would they want to run?

377
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:55,005
To get away
from the snakeheads.

378
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:56,767
What's that?

379
00:31:56,802 --> 00:31:58,363
The snakeheads pay
to get them here,

380
00:31:58,403 --> 00:32:01,121
and then they got to
work off what they owe.

381
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:04,703
How much does it cost?

382
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:08,535
40, 50,000. Depends on
where they're coming from.

383
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:10,750
Sometimes they got to work
for years to pay it off.

384
00:32:10,787 --> 00:32:13,569
To get here?
No fucking way.

385
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:25,338
Yes. Yes. Hello.
Is this Mrs. Irene

386
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,288
Three Rivers?

387
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,290
Mrs. Three Rivers,
I have good news.

388
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:36,220
I am the business manager
of Mr. E.F. Three Rivers,

389
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,911
and I have been authorized

390
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:42,209
to inform you that you
have inherited money.

391
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:46,913
$26,750.

392
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:53,598
No, no, you have no obligation
whatsoever, Mrs. Three Rivers.

393
00:32:53,635 --> 00:32:57,464
Just a small
processing fee of $29

394
00:32:57,507 --> 00:33:02,144
will authorize me to send
your first installment

395
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:06,531
of $13,375.

396
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,921
You can place it on
any major credit card.

397
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:14,971
Sure, I can hold.

398
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,026
Yes.

399
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,237
Oh.

400
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:23,999
Okay.

401
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,480
Yes. Which credit card?

402
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:39,711
Are they always there?

403
00:33:39,748 --> 00:33:41,242
Yeah.

404
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,700
They won't stop you unless
you give them a reason to.

405
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,721
You ever been caught?

406
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:46,811
Once.

407
00:33:46,852 --> 00:33:48,575
What happened?

408
00:33:48,612 --> 00:33:52,094
They gave me the choice of paying a
fine or spending three months in jail.

409
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:53,343
What did you do?

410
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:55,103
I paid the fine.

411
00:33:56,003 --> 00:33:58,721
I made it back in two
nights of smuggling,

412
00:33:58,757 --> 00:34:01,058
but back then it was
cigarettes and everybody did it.

413
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:03,613
Some of the troopers
were into it, too.

414
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:05,278
Smuggling?

415
00:34:05,317 --> 00:34:06,746
Yeah.

416
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:17,181
- Count it.
- Right, I know.

417
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,846
Make sure it's right.
I don't want to get stiffed.

418
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:20,411
Then why don't you count it?

419
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:22,362
I got bad eyes.

420
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,121
Looks good.

421
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,791
Shit.

422
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:37,405
You're welcome.

423
00:34:48,996 --> 00:34:50,306
What about mine?

424
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,164
Now we're even.

425
00:35:55,942 --> 00:35:57,634
Um...

426
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,938
My mom told me to give you
her credit card number.

427
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,244
We only take cash
or money orders.

428
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:04,099
Well, she's going
to be a little late.

429
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:06,402
She's got three minutes.

430
00:36:32,742 --> 00:36:36,036
Hey. It's okay, guys.
I got it right here.

431
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:42,844
It's $255.50, right?

432
00:36:45,351 --> 00:36:47,523
Fifty-five.

433
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,490
Mommy!

434
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:57,914
Hey! Come here!

435
00:37:03,271 --> 00:37:05,157
Who wants to go to PC, huh?

436
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,978
Me.
- Mmm-hmm.

437
00:37:07,014 --> 00:37:09,469
You want to go to the Chopper?

438
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,681
Where'd you get that?

439
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:14,304
Matt made me assistant manager.

440
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,755
Buckle you in.

441
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:19,552
No way.

442
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,313
That so hard to believe?

443
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:23,206
It's been, like, two years.

444
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:26,239
Exactly. That's why
he gave me a bonus.

445
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:30,942
Do you want to go
to the Chopper or not?

446
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:34,211
Yeah.

447
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,001
But you better not blow it all

448
00:37:36,038 --> 00:37:39,105
on that bubble bath stuff,
which you never even open.

449
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:42,371
I'm going to use that
sooner than you think,

450
00:37:43,463 --> 00:37:45,733
in a big fancy tub.

451
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,925
Some big changes in
the weather department here.

452
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,228
A clipper system is going
to zip on down from Canada.

453
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:55,132
Temperatures are going to
dip down big time, not only tonight,

454
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:58,371
into tomorrow, as well. But that's
not all. We're expecting anywhere

455
00:37:58,407 --> 00:38:00,797
from 8 to 12 inches
to accumulate.

456
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,838
Winds 25 to 45 miles an hour,

457
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:06,335
and it's going to feel like
it's 30 below out there.

458
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:08,862
Farmers are advised
to bring their livestock in.

459
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:12,034
Now, we'll be back
right after this message.

460
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:17,317
Hot Wheels! Beat that!

461
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:19,686
Want a blast?
Want to crash?

462
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,126
That's what he wants.

463
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,784
What?

464
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:24,612
For Christmas.

465
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:28,324
What is it, again?

466
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:31,675
Hot Wheels Blast
and Crash Track.

467
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:34,369
I'm getting something
even better than that.

468
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:36,414
Yeah? What?

469
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:38,503
The doublewide.

470
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:40,992
Don't mention it to Ricky yet,
just in case.

471
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,657
Yeah,

472
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,862
just in case.

473
00:38:45,096 --> 00:38:46,885
It's for real this time.

474
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:51,585
What about Dad?

475
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:53,512
What about him?

476
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:55,585
What are you going to do?

477
00:38:55,623 --> 00:38:57,599
Why, did he call broke yet?

478
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:01,088
No, but maybe he would
if you weren't so bitter.

479
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,396
Here we go again
with Saint Dad.

480
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,853
That's what I mean, Mom.
You're always on him.

481
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:07,489
"Give me your paycheck.
Where's your receipts?

482
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:08,641
"Do you need a meeting?"

483
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:11,068
He's an addict, T.J.

484
00:39:14,056 --> 00:39:17,090
You're still bitter.

485
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:20,226
I need you and Ricky to put up the
Christmas tree after school tomorrow, okay?

486
00:39:20,264 --> 00:39:23,331
Where are you going?
Christmas shopping.

487
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:31,233
If you would like to
re-record your greeting, press star.

488
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:34,239

To record greeting, press 3.

490

Hi, it's me. Leave a message
and I'll call you back.

491
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:49,416
Hi, it's me.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

492
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:54,371
To change your
personal greeting, press 1.

493
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:56,994
To record greeting, press 3.

494

Hi, it's me. Leave a message.
I'll call you back.

495
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,202
Son of a bitch.

496
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,630
Hi, it's me. Leave a message.
I'll call you back.

497
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,561
Son of a bitch.

498
00:40:40,842 --> 00:40:42,815
Lila! Get up!

499
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:52,742
I got a job for you!

500
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:57,221
There's two people
out sick today.

501
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,329
If we get down there,
you got a job.

502
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:00,547
Huh?

503
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:03,748
Get your jacket.
Let's go. I got coffee.

504
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,878
Where are we going?

505
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:14,695
Get in. I'll tell you
on the way.

506
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:22,954
Rita said you quit.

507
00:41:22,985 --> 00:41:24,393
She fired me.

508
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:25,472
That's not what she told me.

509
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:26,789
Well, she should have.

510
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:29,576
I couldn't see to count the money.
I told you that.

511
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,617
It was coming up
short half the time.

512
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,315
Then get some glasses.

513
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:35,721
They make me carsick.

514
00:41:35,753 --> 00:41:38,054
So where are we going?

515
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,559
The Tribal Council.

516
00:41:39,594 --> 00:41:40,804
They need someone
to answer phones.

517
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:42,467
No! No way!

518
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:43,967
Why? You can't
answer phones?

519
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,398
Not there.
Not with them.

520
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,760
What's that?

521
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,358
I bought it.

522
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:53,800
From who?

523
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,742
Some white lady.

524
00:41:57,577 --> 00:41:58,657
What?

525
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,389
What do you need a car for?

526
00:42:00,425 --> 00:42:01,407
To get to work.

527
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:03,271
So I don't have to walk
in the breakdown lane.

528
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:05,858
Last week,
I almost got hit by a plow.

529
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:06,945
You'll live.

530
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:10,019
And you know what
I'm talking about.

531
00:42:12,938 --> 00:42:15,239
All right, all right.
I'll go.

532
00:42:16,106 --> 00:42:17,829
Let's go!

533
00:42:37,737 --> 00:42:39,429
$3.76.

534
00:42:39,467 --> 00:42:41,255
I got exact.

535
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,887
Do I have any messages?

536
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:16,360
I can't read this.

537
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:24,552
That's a "T."

538
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,692
No, I can't read any of it.

539
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:29,579
I told Bernie I couldn't see.

540
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,795
Never mind.

541
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:35,846
I'll go.

542
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:55,945
We got to go to Wolfmart and get some
anti-freeze, unless you got extra.

543
00:43:55,978 --> 00:43:56,994
Why?

544
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,278
I think you got a leak
in your heater coil.

545
00:43:58,315 --> 00:44:00,007
It's making
your windows fog up.

546
00:44:00,043 --> 00:44:04,166
We better hurry, because I
got nothing for under the tree.

547
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:40,938
Cold snap for tonight

548
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:43,842
with low temperatures dropping down to
19 below Fahrenheit.

549
00:45:43,885 --> 00:45:47,681
Very hazardous for the cars
and also the Ski-Doos.

550
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:49,896
Stay off the roads if you can.

551
00:45:49,932 --> 00:45:54,025
Currently outside our C-Tribe Radio
studios, it's 5 below Fahrenheit.

552
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:01,670
Mohawks don't
celebrate Christmas.

553
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:05,452
You could have fooled me, the way they
were all lined up at Yankee Dollar today.

554
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:07,873
Those are Christians,
the converted.

555
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,858
From what?

556
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,105
The Longhouse ways.

557
00:46:12,717 --> 00:46:16,012
That's messed up,
not having Santa Claus.

558
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:18,380
For the kids, I mean.

559
00:46:19,885 --> 00:46:21,030
The oxygen.

560
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,523
- It's the Blast and Crash Track set.
- Go!

561
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:29,157
You've timed it right
to slam your competition.

562
00:46:29,197 --> 00:46:30,791
So load, lock and launch...

563
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,130
Dad's going to get
me that for Christmas.

564
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:35,304
Yeah? What about
Santa Claus?

565
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:38,757
Santa Claus is going
to get me the house for Christmas.

566
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:40,259
- You got him!
- Yeah!

567
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:50,211
Wait.
They're not Chinese.

568
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:52,775
They're Pakis.

569
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:54,023
What's that mean?

570
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,467
They're from Pakistan.

571
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:56,711
Well, where's that?

572
00:46:56,748 --> 00:46:57,764
I don't know.
What difference does it make?

573
00:46:57,804 --> 00:47:00,009
A big difference.

574
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:05,130
If we wait much longer, we're not going
to be able to get back across the river.

575
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,817
Look, I'm not driving just
anybody across the border.

576
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:09,226
Do you want the money?

577
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:11,913
I want to know
what's in that bag.

578
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:13,956
What's in there?

579
00:47:16,782 --> 00:47:18,342
They don't understand you.

580
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:19,811
Well, if they want
to come here so bad,

581
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:21,610
they should take the time
to learn English.

582
00:47:21,646 --> 00:47:23,784
Hold on a second.

583
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,856
Hold on a second.

584
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:36,994
What are you doing?

585
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:38,599
Just count the money
and let's go.

586
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:41,987
If we get stuck on the river,
it won't matter what's in there.

587
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,338
Let's just hope
they're not the ones

588
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:46,057
that blow themselves
and everyone else up.

589
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,380
We don't have time.

590
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:04,806
Is that a 20 or a 50?

591
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:06,275
50.

592
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:15,884
Shit.

593
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,222
What are you doing?

594
00:48:21,262 --> 00:48:24,393
Nuclear power, poison gas.

595
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:27,300
Who knows what they
might have in there?

596
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:32,715
I'm not going to be
responsible for that.

597
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:40,550
Hey, I'm going to be
a little late. Okay?

598
00:48:40,974 --> 00:48:42,797
I'm at work.

599
00:48:42,862 --> 00:48:44,871
Is Ricky asleep?

600
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:47,338
Put him on.

601
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:51,597
Now listen, Ricky, he's not
coming till you go to sleep.

602
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:54,952
No. Not yet.

603
00:48:55,503 --> 00:48:58,731
He's still flying over Canada.

604
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:00,621
He's not even done
with Canada yet,

605
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:04,103
so he's not coming
until you get to sleep.

606
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:10,757
Hi. Is Mitch there?

607
00:49:12,943 --> 00:49:14,885
Yeah. Hey.

608
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:18,632
No, T.J. From school.

609
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,447
Yeah. Yeah.

610
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:26,637
I was just wondering if you still needed
those numbers we talked about earlier.

611
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,224
'Cause, uh...

612
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:34,152
Only thing is, I don't really have
any wheels at the moment, so...

613
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:38,670
On Moira Road, off of 37.

614
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:41,347
Mmm-hmm.

615
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:43,460
One more thing.

616
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:48,456
Can you go to Kmart and
pick me up a Blast and Crash Track set?

617
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:51,911
Yeah, exactly.

618
00:49:52,847 --> 00:49:55,052
Uh, thanks, man.

619
00:49:55,536 --> 00:49:57,771
T.J., look at me.

620
00:49:57,807 --> 00:49:59,913
Yeah, that's pretty cool, but it's
going to hurt when you sit down.

621
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:03,300
Now, unwrap yourself.
It's dinnertime.

622
00:50:16,655 --> 00:50:19,722
Hey, I'll be
right back. Okay?

623
00:51:07,248 --> 00:51:08,840
They say there's a bag.

624
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,735
It was too heavy.
We had to unload it.

625
00:51:15,217 --> 00:51:18,086
What's the matter with her?
What's she saying?

626
00:51:18,128 --> 00:51:21,193
That bag,
her baby is in the bag.

627
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:28,331
It didn't feel like
there was anything in that bag.

628
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:29,775
We got to go back.

629
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:32,143
I know. I know that.

630
00:51:39,217 --> 00:51:40,646
Hey.

631
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:42,956
This the right one?

632
00:51:42,992 --> 00:51:45,000
Uh, yeah.

633
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,085
Yeah.

634
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:52,748
Thanks, man.
Have a merry one.

635
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:54,409
Okay.

636
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:41,900
Look. There. Tracks.

637
00:52:41,936 --> 00:52:44,358
Where?
Up there.

638
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,396
Slow down.
I don't want to run over it.

639
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:54,255
Stop.
I think it was here.

640
00:53:20,753 --> 00:53:22,664
It's dead.

641
00:53:25,842 --> 00:53:27,664
Oh, my God.

642
00:53:37,554 --> 00:53:39,277
Come on.

643
00:53:58,706 --> 00:54:00,528
It's dead.

644
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:03,663
Tap the bottom of his feet.

645
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,967
Why?

646
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:08,369
That's what they did to get
Ricky breathing when he was born.

647
00:54:08,402 --> 00:54:09,744
I don't want to touch it.

648
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:12,233
I can't hold it and drive.

649
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:18,472
I don't think it matters.

650
00:54:19,539 --> 00:54:21,514
Just hold it next to your body.
Keep him warm.

651
00:54:21,554 --> 00:54:23,563
But it's too late!

652
00:54:23,603 --> 00:54:27,148
Just do it. We can't
give it back to her cold.

653
00:54:57,396 --> 00:55:00,242
Shit! Shit!

654
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:03,592
What do I do?
Calm down! Pull over.

655
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,905
What if he saw us go by
before to the Pioneer?

656
00:55:05,938 --> 00:55:09,168
He's got no reason to stop us, unless you
give him one. Just keep your mouth shut.

657
00:55:09,204 --> 00:55:11,090
What if he searches the car?
What do we say about...

658
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:14,286
He won't!
Just remember, you're white!

659
00:55:35,987 --> 00:55:38,322
License and registration.

660
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,918
Could you step out of the
vehicle, please, ma'am?

661
00:55:51,956 --> 00:55:54,376
I wasn't speeding, was I?

662
00:55:55,155 --> 00:55:56,431
Did I do something?

663
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:59,250
I'm just directing you
to step out of the vehicle.

664
00:55:59,284 --> 00:56:00,690
Okay.

665
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:08,273
Step behind the vehicle.

666
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:17,677
You see that?

667
00:56:18,195 --> 00:56:19,755
Oh!

668
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:23,822
Your left rear parking light,
it's not illuminated.

669
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,762
Oh, I didn't know.

670
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:29,324
I'm going to have to give
you a provisional ticket.

671
00:56:29,396 --> 00:56:32,713
As long as you get it repaired within
48 hours, it won't be a problem.

672
00:56:32,755 --> 00:56:34,447
Thanks.

673
00:56:34,483 --> 00:56:36,425
Who's your friend?

674
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:40,461
She takes care of my kids
when I have to work late.

675
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,987
You can step back
in the vehicle.

676
00:57:10,132 --> 00:57:12,172
We got to take it in.

677
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:16,652
What is it?

678
00:57:17,652 --> 00:57:19,409
It's moving.

679
00:57:19,445 --> 00:57:21,648
What? Are you sure?

680
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:28,813
Hello, little baby.

681
00:57:28,853 --> 00:57:30,958
He was just cold.

682
00:58:20,213 --> 00:58:22,068
We found him.

683
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,195
Come on. Let's go.

684
00:59:08,565 --> 00:59:10,389
He was dead.

685
00:59:12,373 --> 00:59:14,380
He was just cold.

686
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:17,103
He was dead.

687
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:20,237
Okay. Whatever.

688
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:24,717
He was dead.
You brought him back to life.

689
00:59:24,757 --> 00:59:27,572
That was the Creator, not me.

690
00:59:34,389 --> 00:59:35,983
All I know is Kmart is closed,

691
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:38,443
and I got nothing
for under the tree.

692
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:31,280
Here.

693
01:00:33,847 --> 01:00:36,945
Merry Christmas or whatever.

694
01:00:37,494 --> 01:00:39,021
Yeah.

695
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:16,789
Bernie!

696
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:51,534
What's that?

697
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:53,844
Hot Wheels.

698
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,253
Where'd you get it?

699
01:01:55,288 --> 01:01:57,492
I called a friend.

700
01:01:57,721 --> 01:01:59,378
That kid Mitch?

701
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:02,065
It's probably stolen.
It's not stolen.

702
01:02:02,103 --> 01:02:04,853
I don't want you hanging around
with him. That kid is bad news.

703
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,512
It's not like you
were going to get it.

704
01:02:06,552 --> 01:02:07,829
Move it.

705
01:02:07,864 --> 01:02:10,710
Move it! Listen, mister.

706
01:02:10,744 --> 01:02:13,809
I got more important things
to worry about than toys.

707
01:02:13,849 --> 01:02:15,342
I'm trying to get
our doublewide.

708
01:02:15,384 --> 01:02:17,326
Oh, yeah.
I forgot about that.

709
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:19,987
You can lose that attitude.

710
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:24,916
Anyway, Kmart was closed
by the time I got off work.

711
01:02:26,168 --> 01:02:28,143
What's that smell?

712
01:02:29,688 --> 01:02:31,347
Popcorn.

713
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:39,414
Hi, it's me.
I can't get to the phone right now.

714
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,327
Please leave a message.
And, Troy, if it's you, please,

715
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,181
at least let us
know you're alive.

716
01:02:44,215 --> 01:02:46,802
The boys are really
worried about you.

717
01:03:10,393 --> 01:03:11,820
Daddy!

718
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,126
Is there a Ray Eddy here?

719
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:21,168
Yes.

720
01:03:21,849 --> 01:03:23,092
Can I talk to you
outside for a minute?

721
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:25,201
I haven't gotten
that light fixed yet.

722
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,702
It's not about that.

723
01:03:26,746 --> 01:03:28,719
I just have a few questions.

724
01:03:28,762 --> 01:03:31,663
Uh, sure. One second.

725
01:03:35,224 --> 01:03:37,778
I'll be back in a second.

726
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,965
This is about the woman
that was with you.

727
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:44,376
Yeah.

728
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:46,099
How long have you known her?

729
01:03:46,137 --> 01:03:49,585
Not long.
She looks after my kids.

730
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:52,847
She's a smuggler.

731
01:03:52,889 --> 01:03:54,481
Really?

732
01:03:54,521 --> 01:03:56,976
There is that element on the
reservation. I'm sure you know.

733
01:03:57,018 --> 01:03:57,911
Well, I've heard about it.

734
01:03:57,945 --> 01:04:00,726
I had no idea she was involved.

735
01:04:00,762 --> 01:04:02,224
How did you meet her?

736
01:04:02,266 --> 01:04:03,956
Um...

737
01:04:03,994 --> 01:04:08,434
I think there was a sign
for a babysitter at Wolfmart.

738
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:10,416
That's where I get my gas.

739
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,628
I just thought you
should be aware of that.

740
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:15,217
She's known to have brought
illegal aliens into the country.

741
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:17,329
Oh, my God.

742
01:04:17,369 --> 01:04:18,963
If I were you,
I'd get a new babysitter.

743
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:20,824
Absolutely.

744
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,378
Well, you have
an enjoyable holiday.

745
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:25,172
You, too.

746
01:04:43,864 --> 01:04:46,931
T.J., could you
come out here a minute?

747
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:49,621
T.J., get your ass
out here!

748
01:04:57,306 --> 01:04:58,898
What did he want?
Did something happen to Dad?

749
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:00,530
No.

750
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,260
What did he want?

751
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,884
Did you have a fire
here last night?

752
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:08,690
Uh, the pipes froze,
so I fixed them.

753
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,672
You fixed them?

754
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:12,177
Yeah.

755
01:05:12,217 --> 01:05:14,606
Did you use the blowtorch?

756
01:05:14,905 --> 01:05:15,855
Dad did it before...

757
01:05:15,898 --> 01:05:17,686
So you used the blowtorch!

758
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:21,684
Look at this!
We can't live here anymore!

759
01:05:21,722 --> 01:05:23,632
So what?
It's just a tin crapper.

760
01:05:23,675 --> 01:05:26,969
No, this was our house.

761
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:29,851
So, we're getting
a new one, right?

762
01:05:29,882 --> 01:05:31,737
That's it!

763
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,815
Damn it!
No. What are you...

764
01:05:33,849 --> 01:05:37,461
Son of a bitch!
Don't touch it!

765
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:40,208
It's not yours.
Dad gave it to me!

766
01:05:40,251 --> 01:05:41,266
Put it down!

767
01:05:41,306 --> 01:05:42,800
Are you going
to shoot me now, too?

768
01:05:42,842 --> 01:05:44,052
Put it down!
Maybe he didn't like getting shot

769
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:47,025
in his own house!
Maybe that's why he left!

770
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:48,376
That was an accident.
Yeah, some accident!

771
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:51,574
You shot him in the foot!

772
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:54,742
T.J., he spent the food money
on scratch cards.

773
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:56,568
He'd done it before.

774
01:05:56,603 --> 01:05:59,920
Yeah, and he was clean
32 months since then.

775
01:06:02,172 --> 01:06:05,684
Give me that.
No, you can't have it. It's mine.

776
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:07,987
Give it to me!

777
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:22,679
I didn't know any other way
to keep us together.

778
01:06:22,715 --> 01:06:24,373
I mean,

779
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:29,045
he's a good dad
when he's not gambling.

780
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,117
Yeah.

781
01:06:32,347 --> 01:06:34,965
Awesome dad.

782
01:06:35,003 --> 01:06:38,351
Robs us and takes off
a week before Christmas.

783
01:07:31,483 --> 01:07:32,760
I quit smuggling.

784
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:34,487
T.J. Set the trailer
on fire.

785
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:36,498
He didn't mean to,
but the pipes froze

786
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:37,849
and he took out
that damn torch,

787
01:07:37,884 --> 01:07:40,534
which I told him not to touch
when I wasn't there,

788
01:07:40,572 --> 01:07:42,938
and he thawed them out.

789
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:45,755
I got glasses, and I
can see up close now.

790
01:07:45,788 --> 01:07:49,170
There's a hole in my house.
We got to move.

791
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:52,561
I just need one more run
to get the double.

792
01:07:52,603 --> 01:07:55,123
Look, you can have
the Spirit. Okay?

793
01:07:55,163 --> 01:07:56,985
I don't want it.

794
01:07:57,021 --> 01:07:58,963
What is it then?

795
01:07:59,003 --> 01:08:02,681
You still mad about that baby?
'Cause it wasn't my fault.

796
01:08:02,715 --> 01:08:05,978
I mean, who puts their baby
in a duffle bag?

797
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:07,539
You're going to need
a lot of money

798
01:08:07,581 --> 01:08:10,166
to raise that
one-year-old kid.

799
01:08:10,268 --> 01:08:11,793
I got enough.

800
01:08:11,835 --> 01:08:15,130
Yeah, but you still
got to get him.

801
01:08:15,164 --> 01:08:19,190
I'll help you.
You can even borrow my gun.

802
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:50,484
You should see the inside.

803
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:52,856
How many bedrooms?
Three.

804
01:08:52,893 --> 01:08:56,405
And there's a Jacuzzi tub
in the master bathroom.

805
01:08:57,212 --> 01:08:58,226
Wall-to-wall carpet?

806
01:08:58,268 --> 01:08:59,250
Oh, yeah.

807
01:08:59,292 --> 01:09:01,300
But the best thing
is the insulation.

808
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:03,413
Pipes can never freeze.

809
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,493
I'll be right back.

810
01:09:11,453 --> 01:09:15,315
There's never any need
to touch up or repaint these walls.

811
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:18,551
I want to schedule a delivery.

812
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,840
Just give me one sec.

813
01:09:22,876 --> 01:09:25,462
What exactly is it
I can do for you?

814
01:09:26,557 --> 01:09:29,404
It's 3,000, but I want
it delivered tomorrow.

815
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:32,600
You did have a closing date
on Christmas.

816
01:09:33,788 --> 01:09:35,217
I'm here now.

817
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:36,407
You add this to my deposit.

818
01:09:36,445 --> 01:09:37,655
All you have to do is show up.

819
01:09:37,693 --> 01:09:41,685
If I don't have the rest,
you can keep it.

820
01:09:41,725 --> 01:09:45,140
All right, well,
I just need you to sign this paper here,

821
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,149
and you'll be ready to go.
Right there.

822
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,854
I'm sorry about that.

823
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:18,293
Heat wave.

824
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:20,122
You got a run for us, Jimmy?

825
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:22,012
It's pretty slow
after Christmas,

826
01:10:22,046 --> 01:10:24,533
unless you want
to go off the rez.

827
01:10:25,885 --> 01:10:27,128
There's that guy
up in Montreal.

828
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,238
He's usually got heads.

829
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,627
What? You want a job?

830
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:03,931
No, Jimmy sent us.

831
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:09,018
Christy.

832
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:12,886
Put your hands up.

833
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:24,186
They have nothing.

834
01:11:24,222 --> 01:11:25,945
Okay.

835
01:11:51,838 --> 01:11:53,943
Pop the back.

836
01:11:55,615 --> 01:11:57,720
We need to get paid first.

837
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,654
There's only 600 here.

838
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,793
You get the rest
at the drop off.

839
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,686
It's 600 apiece.

840
01:12:18,752 --> 01:12:21,140
You want to make a change now?

841
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,256
It's 1,200.

842
01:12:27,295 --> 01:12:29,751
You want to have a problem?

843
01:12:29,792 --> 01:12:32,060
Huh?

844
01:12:32,095 --> 01:12:35,925
Because it's not a problem for me.
It is a problem for them!

845
01:12:37,023 --> 01:12:38,617
Hey!

846
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,890
Okay. Okay.
We'll take them.

847
01:12:40,927 --> 01:12:42,520
We'll take them with us.
Open the trunk.

848
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:43,420
Let's go!

849
01:12:43,456 --> 01:12:45,081
Just open the trunk.

850
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,381
In.

851
01:12:56,224 --> 01:12:57,597
Bitch.

852
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:01,685
Turn around!
Bruno!

853
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,752
I want the rest.

854
01:13:07,935 --> 01:13:10,073
But I have nothing.

855
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:26,814
Let's go!
Let's get out of here.

856
01:13:26,847 --> 01:13:28,157
I'll give you
the rest of the money.

857
01:13:28,192 --> 01:13:29,599
No. Thanks.

858
01:13:29,632 --> 01:13:32,413
You're going to
get us all killed.

859
01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:37,916
Give it to her.
Give it to her.

860
01:13:56,929 --> 01:13:59,895
He shot me. I'm shot.

861
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,457
I think you're okay.

862
01:14:02,496 --> 01:14:04,186
You should have just
took the money from me.

863
01:14:04,225 --> 01:14:06,680
I'm sick and tired of people
stealing from me. Is it all there?

864
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,215
We got to get
out of here first.

865
01:14:08,256 --> 01:14:10,045
Just count it.
Make sure it's all there.

866
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,087
Okay, okay. All right.

867
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,475
Is it there?

868
01:14:16,512 --> 01:14:17,822
It's all there.

869
01:14:17,855 --> 01:14:19,480
Good.

870
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,171
Slow down a bit. We got to
keep it under the speed limit.

871
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,761
We got to get off this road.

872
01:14:26,976 --> 01:14:29,563
We got to get off this road.

873
01:14:32,545 --> 01:14:34,171
Oh, shit!

874
01:14:38,976 --> 01:14:40,382
Where's the reservation?

875
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:43,231
Just past that pole
right there.

876
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:56,153
What the hell?
We're on the rez.

877
01:14:56,194 --> 01:14:58,398
They can't arrest us, but if they
catch us they can take the money.

878
01:14:58,432 --> 01:14:59,840
Shit!

879
01:15:15,617 --> 01:15:17,505
It's black ice out here.

880
01:15:17,537 --> 01:15:19,194
Will it hold us?

881
01:15:19,233 --> 01:15:20,957
I don't know.

882
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:33,335
Shit.

883
01:16:04,481 --> 01:16:07,131
Get out on your side!
Pop the trunk!

884
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,216
Get the cash.
You got the cash?

885
01:16:08,256 --> 01:16:09,752
Yeah.

886
01:16:10,337 --> 01:16:11,449
Come on. Let's go.

887
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:13,148
Come on, come on.

888
01:16:42,337 --> 01:16:45,087
Hey, Lila!
Over here!

889
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,199
Jimmy, you're not
coming in here.

890
01:17:06,243 --> 01:17:09,112
We just need to
borrow your oven.

891
01:17:17,186 --> 01:17:20,284
We have a situation
with a couple of smugglers.

892
01:17:20,322 --> 01:17:23,170
They tried to go across the river,
but their car went in.

893
01:17:23,203 --> 01:17:26,431
And now the troopers know that
they're on the reservation.

894
01:17:26,466 --> 01:17:27,895
Who are they?

895
01:17:27,938 --> 01:17:30,011
Lila Littlewolf
and some white woman.

896
01:17:30,051 --> 01:17:31,612
What do the troopers want?

897
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:33,756
They want the surrender
of the two illegals.

898
01:17:33,793 --> 01:17:37,088
Second, they want the surrender
of the non-native smuggler.

899
01:17:37,122 --> 01:17:39,610
They really mean to set
an example over here.

900
01:17:39,652 --> 01:17:40,895
Do you know where they are?

901
01:17:40,962 --> 01:17:42,970
Yeah. They're probably
over at Velma's.

902
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:44,636
What about Lila Littlewolf?

903
01:17:44,675 --> 01:17:47,577
You can't start throwing
Mohawks off the rez, Rosalie.

904
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:49,692
She's got a Mohawk son.

905
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:51,618
She cost us a Mohawk son.

906
01:17:51,652 --> 01:17:52,862
Jake was a big boy.

907
01:17:52,899 --> 01:17:54,807
He knew what he was doing.

908
01:18:12,099 --> 01:18:14,400
Jimmy, get out of here.

909
01:18:27,587 --> 01:18:29,563
You, too.

910
01:18:57,347 --> 01:18:59,203
I need my half.

911
01:19:01,796 --> 01:19:04,828
No, no, no.
You stay here. Stay here.

912
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:15,871
Hi, Lila.

913
01:19:17,539 --> 01:19:18,815
Hi, Bernie.

914
01:19:18,851 --> 01:19:20,259
You're in big trouble.

915
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:22,300
The Council voted to expel you.

916
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,282
Expel me?
For five years.

917
01:19:24,323 --> 01:19:25,917
You can appeal,

918
01:19:25,956 --> 01:19:27,744
but I don't think you're going to
be able to change Rosalie's mind.

919
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:31,130
I thought all this was legal
on the reservation.

920
01:19:31,523 --> 01:19:32,768
Look, I got to go.

921
01:19:32,805 --> 01:19:35,073
If she leaves,
they'll turn you in.

922
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:37,180
The troopers want somebody.

923
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,529
But she's a Mohawk.

924
01:19:38,564 --> 01:19:40,091
The chiefs want her out.

925
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:43,743
There's going to be nobody standing
between her and the troopers.

926
01:19:45,765 --> 01:19:48,448
My kids got no one but me.

927
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:51,332
If you leave, she'll
never see her son again.

928
01:19:51,363 --> 01:19:53,252
Let her go.

929
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:55,515
Lila, you're giving up on him.

930
01:19:55,556 --> 01:19:57,694
He's only a year old.

931
01:20:02,277 --> 01:20:04,001
Just go.

932
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:13,979
At least you've got family
to take care of him, you know?

933
01:21:12,902 --> 01:21:17,854
I wanted the baby to have a pretty
new crib, not some hand-me-down.

934
01:21:19,972 --> 01:21:22,493
He wouldn't let me go alone.

935
01:21:25,733 --> 01:21:29,627
I was too fat to fit
behind the steering wheel.

936
01:21:29,670 --> 01:21:32,801
He just wanted to
keep you and Little Jake safe.

937
01:21:37,957 --> 01:21:40,225
Just a couple of months, right?

938
01:21:40,261 --> 01:21:42,466
I got no record, and I'm white.

939
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:46,015
I got baby stuff in the shed.

940
01:21:46,405 --> 01:21:50,431
Get a good used singlewide.

941
01:21:50,757 --> 01:21:53,604
Insulation is the key thing.

942
01:21:55,365 --> 01:21:57,820
Versailles will
give you a hard time,

943
01:21:57,862 --> 01:21:58,940
but that will leave
enough for you

944
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,698
and the boys to live on
for a couple of months.

945
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:06,271
Ricky's allergic to penicillin,

946
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:10,501
and you can't feed him potato
chips all the time. Okay?

947
01:22:13,029 --> 01:22:15,899
But you got to get there quick,

948
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:19,420
'cause T.J.
Will get scared.

949
01:22:19,462 --> 01:22:22,779
And I don't want him
to get scared. Okay?

950
01:22:23,654 --> 01:22:25,181
Okay?

951
01:22:29,061 --> 01:22:30,524
Okay.

952
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:35,037
Don't let Versailles
jerk you around.

953
01:22:35,398 --> 01:22:36,608
You go with her, okay?

954
01:22:36,646 --> 01:22:38,074
Sure.

955
01:22:58,439 --> 01:22:59,485
What do you want?

956
01:22:59,527 --> 01:23:01,152
I need his coat.

957
01:23:04,774 --> 01:23:06,979
Where's his coat?

958
01:23:07,367 --> 01:23:09,570
You can't have him.

959
01:23:10,726 --> 01:23:13,029
You can't have him!

960
01:23:13,605 --> 01:23:15,942
Say goodbye to your Toda.

961
01:23:41,127 --> 01:23:43,778
Speak English?
Speak English?

962
01:23:57,606 --> 01:23:59,844
What happens to them?

963
01:24:00,775 --> 01:24:02,663
They'll probably go back.

964
01:24:02,695 --> 01:24:07,484
But how long for me?
You know, if I confess?

965
01:24:07,528 --> 01:24:11,554
Providing they're not on
a watch list, four months.

966
01:24:15,368 --> 01:24:18,716
I don't think you have
that much to worry about.

967
01:24:19,686 --> 01:24:21,988
Can I have a cigarette?

968
01:24:28,774 --> 01:24:32,353
Is there someone
that I can call for you

969
01:24:32,391 --> 01:24:33,984
to take care of your children?

970
01:24:34,024 --> 01:24:36,032
I got somebody.

971
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:38,756
A relative?

972
01:24:40,264 --> 01:24:41,921
A friend.

973
01:24:42,471 --> 01:24:44,960
But I need to call my kids.

974
01:24:52,743 --> 01:24:54,948
Mom, what did you do?

975
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,396
What? A smuggler?
Holy shit!

976
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,099
Are you in jail?

977
01:25:06,279 --> 01:25:09,247
Yeah, but are you
gonna be in jail?

978
01:25:14,185 --> 01:25:17,796
Yeah, okay. But...
But why? I...

979
01:25:18,503 --> 01:25:19,966
I can do it. I...

980
01:25:20,007 --> 01:25:21,217
I look after him all the time.

981
01:25:21,256 --> 01:25:23,296
I don't see why we need...

982
01:25:24,936 --> 01:25:26,016
Yeah, I'm still here.

983
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:36,640
Hi.

984
01:25:38,185 --> 01:25:39,712
Okay.

985
01:25:49,896 --> 01:25:52,646
Hey, you've got to put the little
pieces up higher or he'll eat them. Okay?

986
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,141
What?

987
01:26:49,322 --> 01:26:52,104
You got a little boy
named Troy Junior?

988
01:26:52,136 --> 01:26:53,926
Yeah.

989
01:26:54,537 --> 01:26:56,064
Troy!

990
01:26:56,841 --> 01:27:00,103
Would you come here?
I want to talk to you.

991
01:27:11,786 --> 01:27:14,435
You know, you did a bad
thing to an old lady,

992
01:27:14,472 --> 01:27:16,774
and I'd like to
introduce her to you

993
01:27:16,809 --> 01:27:19,395
and give you a chance
to apologize.

994
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,993
Because I know you're
probably a good kid,

995
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:23,399
and I know you want
to set this right.

996
01:27:23,434 --> 01:27:25,060
Come on.

997
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:28,422
Tell her you're sorry.

998
01:27:30,154 --> 01:27:31,845
Sorry.

999
01:27:31,881 --> 01:27:33,440
Okay?

1000
01:27:34,985 --> 01:27:38,020
You did good.
Now don't do that again.

1001
01:27:44,681 --> 01:27:47,463
Hey, come here.

1002
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:51,649
Muddy.

1003
01:28:30,793 --> 01:28:32,287
Hey.
