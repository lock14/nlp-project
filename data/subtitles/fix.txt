1
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:05,488
30 years old
and no driver's license.

2
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:07,488
Fucking ridiculous.

3
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:12,984
I could have stayed
and hired another cameraman.

4
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:16,150
Have some jerk with
a shitty camera and no eye shoot it?

5
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:17,894
Forget it.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,965
Look, we'll bail him out,

7
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:24,615
drive him to the rehab,
and drive right back up.

8
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:26,069
We'll just be a little late.

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,557
I don't understand...
the lawyer got a deal...

10
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:31,464
that he got six months in rehab
or three years in prison, and he...

11
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:34,114
And the judge gave him
10 days to enter the rehab,

12
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:36,441
and on the seventh day
he got arrested again.

13
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:37,474
Genius.

14
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,154
What am I supposed to do?
He's my brother.

15
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:41,861
I didn't even know
you had a brother, Milo.

16
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:43,096
I got an idea.

17
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:44,614
We could interview him
about his experiences.

18
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:46,488
No, that's not the film
I'm making. I'm not interested...

19
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,781
in some privileged white kid
who got himself into trouble.

20
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,785
Just because he's white
doesn't make him privileged, Bella!

21
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:52,982
- Stop pigeonholing people!
- I'm not pigeonholing him!

22
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:55,890
He's a victim of the very system
we're trying to expose with our movie!

23
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,134
He's a victim
of his own stupidity.

24
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:00,511
If he doesn't get to
the rehab by 8:00 pm. tomorrow,

25
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:02,085
he's going to prison.

26
00:01:03,387 --> 00:01:05,222
Do you hear that clunking sound?

27
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:07,677
Yeah, my car's been
doing that. I don't know what it is.

28
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:08,944
- Have you checked the oil?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:09,848
When's the last time
you checked the oil?

30
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:11,370
I put veggie oil in it yesterday.

31
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,755
Not veggie oil.
Engine oil.

32
00:01:15,697 --> 00:01:18,927
But what about your mom?
Can't she help him with it?

33
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,402
Our mom
lives in a cave in Greece,

34
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:23,009
our father's dead, our grandmother
has Alzheimer's, and...

35
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,822
don't even ask me
about his friends.

36
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:29,318
God, I hate L.A.!

37
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:32,078
It's so barren.

38
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,331
Just wait
'till you meet him, okay?

39
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:37,500
He's such a character.

40
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:52,319
Milo!

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,323
Sam?

42
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,907
Is that a camera?

43
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,330
- Yeah.
- Ah.

44
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,331
It's okay?

45
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:00,753
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,950
- How ya doing?
- Hi. Uh, cash or credit?

47
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:03,951
Uh... credit.

48
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:06,149
Okay. This... huh.

49
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,025
So, do you mind if I ask you
how you became a bail bondsman?

50
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:11,609
It's a family business.

51
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,711
Sign here, print here, initial.

52
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:16,630
So, uh...
why do you pack that gun?

53
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:18,060
- This?
- Yeah.

54
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:20,522
- Oh, this is a...
- Oh, you don't have to pull it out.

55
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:22,005
insurance policy.

56
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,003
What do you mean?

57
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,626
A lotta people think
bail bondsmen carry the money.

58
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:28,960
We don't.
It's all paper.

59
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:32,802
If a brother doesn't show up to court,
I could go after him.

60
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:36,586
- If I no find him, I go after you!
- Oh, okay!

61
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:41,904
- Like Rambo! Boom!
- Oh, okay, okay.

62
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:42,904
Okay.

63
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:52,017
- All right. Take care.
- All right, then, Leo.

64
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,330
What's up, Leo?!

65
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,568
Each day better than the next.

66
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:00,645
We're in the Volvo right here.

67
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:04,023
Come meet my girlfriend.
Her name's Bella.

68
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:06,604
Drove all the way down here
from San Francisco.

69
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,396
Bella! This is Leo.

70
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:16,235
Hi, Leo!

71
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:22,579
Glad he's so appreciative.

72
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,641
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.

73
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,506
Just finish this,
and we should go.

74
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:05,471
Fuck you!

75
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:09,240
"Fac eu"... means "I'll do it"
in Romanian.

76
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,132
Thank you.

77
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:16,970
So, uh, why were you
arrested this time?

78
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,909
It's 'cause I'm black.

79
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,621
And what happened
to your shoes?

80
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:22,369
I don't know.

81
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,981
You were in a cell barefoot?

82
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,603
They gave me shoes,
but they were awful,

83
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:30,567
so I prefer to go barefoot,
you know?

84
00:04:30,968 --> 00:04:33,263
I was running from the cops, right?

85
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:35,201
I fell over a wall... boom!

86
00:04:35,202 --> 00:04:38,208
Fucked up my ankle,
the pigs caught up to me,

87
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,179
and my slippers were gone.

88
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,217
They were my favorite slippers, too.

89
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:44,215
Blue and a little gold.

90
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:47,937
What happened to your shirt?

91
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:49,868
It's fuckin' hot as balls in here.

92
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,657
I'm cold.

93
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:53,983
My shirt?

94
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:55,696
Fucking cigarettes!

95
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:58,119
I fell asleep
with a lit cigarette in my hand.

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,839
I wake up, and my favorite
fucking pajamas are ruined.

97
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:04,472
I feel sick.

98
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,240
Hey, do you have any laxatives?

99
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:18,183
- No.
- "No," no? Or "what," no?

100
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:20,155
Should we get the check?

101
00:05:20,156 --> 00:05:21,484
Milo, we need
to go to the market.

102
00:05:21,485 --> 00:05:23,221
I need to get laxatives,
cigarettes, and shoes.

103
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,002
Okay, but... can you
do that fast, 'cause we gotta go.

104
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,140
- I saw a market next door.
- OK, let's go, let's go right now.

105
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:29,998
Okay, I'll pay the check.
Just go fast.

106
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,279
- Alright. You want anything?
- Nope.

107
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,921
- You all right, babe?
- Yup.

108
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,801
- Okay, we'll be right back.
- Okay.

109
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,952
It hurts
to see you again like this, Leo.

110
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,828
Still addicted
to the camera, I see.

111
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:41,051
Thought about seeking help?

112
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,087
Admitting you have a problem
is the first step.

113
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:54,379
You're not gonna help me?
You're just gonna film me?

114
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,993
Okay.

115
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,059
Do you have any laxatives?

116
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:07,987
28.50.

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,956
Milo, do you have any money?

118
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:19,498
Did I go the right way?
Is this Anaheim?

119
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:20,398
You're heading the right way.

120
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,301
Okay, pull in right there.

121
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,451
- This is it?
- Yeah.

122
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:25,961
- Oh, perfect! All right, cool.
- I gotta get my car outta the impound.

123
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:27,601
- Left right here.
- Impound?

124
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:28,955
- Yes.
- Oh, this is the impound.

125
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,114
- No, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

126
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,503
- Oh, you have a car?.
- Yes.

127
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:33,901
Alright, perfect, you can drive yourself
to rehab, because we gotta get back...

128
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:35,442
- to San Francisco.
- No, no, no, no!

129
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:37,617
He's not driving himself.
He doesn't have a license, insurance.

130
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:38,904
Look at him.

131
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:41,001
Leo, we're not... we're not getting
your car outta the impound.

132
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,871
What do you want me to do?
You want me to drive both cars?

133
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:45,921
I have a 1960 black Impala.
It's beautiful...

134
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,206
- We're not gonna make it.
- It's a 20,000 dollar car...

135
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,003
- This car's a great car.
- It's a 20,000 dollar car.

136
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:51,801
You can have it to go up north.
I just need you to pay the impound fee.

137
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,951
It's only 800 dollars...
I can't leave my car here, Leo.

138
00:06:53,952 --> 00:06:55,282
What do you want me to do?

139
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:10,006
- It's 800 even?
- Mh-hm.

140
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:16,560
Um, baby, are you sure
this is a good idea?

141
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,824
Are you kidding?
Did you see that car?

142
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:21,702
Yeah, but it seems
kind of crazy to leave my car here.

143
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:24,020
- I don't even know where we are.
- Baby, your car was falling apart.

144
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,927
All right.

145
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,194
I'm gonna go check on the Impala.

146
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,712
No, I'm coming.
Don't leave me. I'm coming.

147
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,860
Fuck!

148
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,276
Do you have a card?
It's okay.

149
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:43,023
Leo, that car is so cool!

150
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:47,330
What's wrong?

151
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:52,044
- Get in.
- Leo, you can't drive.

152
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,244
Get in the car.

153
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:55,001
You can't drive. You don't
have a driver's license or insurance.

154
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:57,104
- I don't have patience for you.
- What're you doing?

155
00:07:57,105 --> 00:07:59,508
Get in the car. I'm gonna show you
how to drive it.

156
00:08:11,046 --> 00:08:13,029
Where're we going, brother?

157
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,174
Shut the fucking camera off, Milo!

158
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,764
Don't fucking tell me
what to do, tell us where we're going!

159
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:19,778
Could you slow down
just a little bit, please?

160
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:23,464
Can we go back, because
I left all of my shit in my car...

161
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:25,845
because I didn't know
you were gonna fucking kidnap us?

162
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:37,515
Hey, yo, what's up, man?

163
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:38,475
How you doing?

164
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:40,301
Hermes wants to
wash that jail off him and shit...

165
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:42,092
'cause he's not feeling too good.

166
00:09:42,093 --> 00:09:43,950
You guys are making
a film about him?

167
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,422
- Who?
- Your brother.

168
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:47,180
- What'd you call him?
- Aw, fuck. My bad.

169
00:09:47,181 --> 00:09:48,591
I called him Hermes, man.

170
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:49,998
He got that name
'cause he's always wearing...

171
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,501
that fancy scarf of his and shit.

172
00:09:51,502 --> 00:09:53,102
Crazy-ass white boy, man.

173
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,639
He keeps a stash of them
in my closet.

174
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,495
No, I'm not making a movie
about my brother.

175
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,870
This camera is just a bad habit.

176
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,842
Tell me about it. We are creatures
of habit, aren't we?

177
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:04,208
Hello there.
They call me Black Aries.

178
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,998
Hi. I'm Bella.

179
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:07,343
Do you mind
if I, uh, take a walk?

180
00:10:07,344 --> 00:10:08,943
Oh, go and do your thing.

181
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:10,736
- Thank you.
- Where you going?

182
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:13,711
I just need to cool off a little.

183
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,864
You mind if I ask you
how you know my brother?

184
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,719
Aw, shit. I know your brother
from back in the day.

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,352
We used to do graffiti together.

186
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:24,336
You can still see
big-ass giant signs...

187
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:27,475
Hermes and Black Aries pieces
everywhere, man.

188
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:30,993
It was a beautiful thing. Lovely.

189
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:34,129
You mind if I ask
how you got injured?

190
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,377
Yeah, sure, man.

191
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:38,193
I was a contractor in Afghanistan.

192
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:40,625
After being a soldier
in the First Gulf War,

193
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:41,936
I realized I'd make
a lot more money

194
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:43,794
working for them damn devils
in the State Department

195
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:45,490
as a mercenary,
you know what I mean?

196
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:46,899
I was in Helmand Province.

197
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,427
You know, that's
the real rowdy side and shit.

198
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:52,877
I was over there doing this thing...
what they call "Crop Substitution".

199
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,411
Man, I'm telling you,
just out of nowhere... boom!

200
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:59,156
Drug lords just hit us real hard,
or some kind of fucking lords, man.

201
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:00,915
They definitely
were running the place.

202
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,484
You must have been
in a lot of pain.

203
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:05,075
But they got some real good
painkillers down there.

204
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:06,475
Real good.

205
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:08,660
We ready?

206
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,420
Yeah,
we're just waiting on Leo.

207
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,604
Shocking.

208
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,780
- Need some help?
- Oh, man, please.

209
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,029
Thank you so much.

210
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,004
I've been meaning to get this place
asphalted and shit, you know.

211
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:19,476
It's going to happen one day.
Thank you so much.

212
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:20,820
- You're good?
- Oh, yeah. I'm good.

213
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,734
Thank you, Bella.

214
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:26,676
What's up?

215
00:11:26,677 --> 00:11:27,637
Milo...

216
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:30,453
- Yes?
- What are we doing?

217
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,791
We're... waiting on my brother.
I told you.

218
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,231
You know what?
Put the camera down.

219
00:11:34,232 --> 00:11:36,214
I wanna talk to you.

220
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:39,575
- Put it down!
- It's down. It's down. It's down.

221
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:42,103
Your brother has some
serious fucking problems, Milo.

222
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:43,190
I know. That's why we're here.

223
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:44,247
Yeah, I get that.
I get that...

224
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,679
but I really thought I was gonna
fucking die in the car back there.

225
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,767
Jesus Christ!

226
00:11:47,768 --> 00:11:49,527
I mean, you didn't tell me
that he was like, like...

227
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:51,544
Like the very same people
we're trying to help with our movie?

228
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:52,600
Oh, please, Milo.

229
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:53,913
I know you're smart enough to know

230
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,440
that there's a difference
between trying to expose

231
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:59,286
a systemic problem that affects
hundreds of thousands of people

232
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:03,289
and risking our lives
for one lone maniac.

233
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,953
That makes sense,
coming from someone

234
00:12:04,954 --> 00:12:09,298
who doesn't speak to her own parents
for political reasons.

235
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,665
Look, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?

236
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,200
Look, my brother's just part
of the package for a few more hours.

237
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,194
Please, just bear with me.

238
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:16,409
- Fine.
- Please?

239
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,978
Fine.

240
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,250
Where is he?

241
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:23,130
Leo, let's move it, man! Come on!

242
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:25,656
I'm gonna wait in the car.

243
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,024
Come on, man.

244
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:30,810
I gotta get my ass to rehab.
Let's go!

245
00:12:30,811 --> 00:12:32,953
Aries!

246
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:36,505
- Whee!
- Oh, come on, man...

247
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,228
Keep looking out, man.

248
00:12:39,229 --> 00:12:41,115
I'm gonna hit the Hollywood sign.

249
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:43,357
Ooh, you better do that shit, man.
Like old times, man.

250
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:45,659
Put me up, too.
Don't forget the Black Aries, baby.

251
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,052
Hey, each day's
better than the next.

252
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,619
It's gonna get better, man.

253
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,634
Or worse. La-la!

254
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:55,548
You drive.
I don't have a license or insurance.

255
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,462
Ha!

256
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,835
Ma'am...
Come on, Milo.

257
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:02,362
You wanted to go so badly.
Andale! Andale!

258
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,120
Which ones?

259
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,782
I don't care what shoes you wear.

260
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,446
Okay, how do I...
how do I get to the rehab?

261
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,677
Come on, which ones you like?

262
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,945
Are we going the right way?
Is this the way to the rehab?

263
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,512
I don't know.
I have to ask my lawyer.

264
00:13:32,513 --> 00:13:33,919
What?
Well, where's that?

265
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,383
It's on the way.
It's only going to take a second.

266
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:37,601
Come on, you're like a sister to me.

267
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:38,689
Which ones do you like better?

268
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,938
I'm not your sister.

269
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:41,377
If I had to choose,
I'd pick the shoes.

270
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,817
The boots are fucking hideous.

271
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:44,416
Are you crazy?
These are endangered stingray.

272
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,952
You asked for my opinion.
I'm telling you.

273
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:48,160
They may even be extinct
after this pair was made.

274
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,081
- Oh, fantastic.
- Look at the eye.

275
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:52,097
- The eye is watching you.
- That's not the eye.

276
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,496
That's their fake eye
for predators.

277
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:56,640
Sorry.

278
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:02,561
What were you doing up
in The City of Brotherly Love, Milo?

279
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:05,377
Prepping a documentary
on the American prison system.

280
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,298
Something you're going
to get to know real well

281
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,740
if we don't get you
to rehab in time.

282
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,682
So, put the camera on me.
I'll tell you how I got busted.

283
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:13,923
Oh, pray tell.

284
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:19,396
You know that park
that we just passed?

285
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:22,467
That park right the fuck there.
The one we just passed?

286
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:23,683
Yeah, yeah.

287
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:27,396
I fell asleep underneath
a picnic table there...

288
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:29,604
Shit, I can't reach the...

289
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:34,019
...and I was awakened to laughter
by a gaggle of giggling girls.

290
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,637
The next thing I know,
they invite me to a pajama party.

291
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:39,109
How old are these girls?

292
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,453
They were, you know?

293
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,661
- I go to their house...
- Where?

294
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,701
That one right there.
I put on my pajamas.

295
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:47,461
And it's on the second story.

296
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:49,189
I'm trying to get used
to my new wheels here.

297
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,284
Ten o'clock, two o'clock, Bella.
It's like a gun... just aim and shoot.

298
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:56,295
I can handle it fine.

299
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,830
We're getting our swivel on,

300
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:00,646
and suddenly,
the chick's boyfriend comes home

301
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,278
and, um, he's not happy.

302
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:05,127
I'm jumping out the fucking window,
I blaze off in the Impala.

303
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:07,304
I'm going a buck-twenty
down Burbank.

304
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:09,383
I hit Chandler, Colfax.

305
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:11,272
The cops are on my ass.

306
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:12,263
So I ditch the car.

307
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:15,072
I'm running down Topanga
in my fucking pajamas.

308
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:18,984
And I, uh...

309
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,160
Where do I go after that?

310
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:24,200
Slam! I fall over a wall
that's connected to an alleyway.

311
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:27,113
10 seconds later I had one
of those Nazis boots on my head.

312
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:30,314
And the rest is,
as they say, a mystery.

313
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:35,370
Wow, but we picked you up,
like, 30 miles away from here

314
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:39,585
all the way
in a place called Calabasas.

315
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:42,827
I don't... well.

316
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:44,812
Maybe it wasn't here.

317
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,922
I don't know.
L.A. looks all the same to me.

318
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:49,643
No shit.

319
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:56,716
- This is for you, Bella.
- What the fuck is that?

320
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:58,411
You look like you need a friend.

321
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:01,896
Bill, Bella.
Bella, Bill.

322
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,060
Vivian!

323
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,883
- Hey.
- Hey.

324
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,322
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:14,861
That's my brother, Milo.

326
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:16,078
- How are you?
- Hello.

327
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,957
He's making a movie,
and he wants you to star in it.

328
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:23,437
I'm sure he does.

329
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:26,414
Harry is waiting on you,
and, boy, he is not happy.

330
00:16:26,415 --> 00:16:27,694
Where have you been?

331
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,388
You know, the usual.

332
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,373
Swimming in the Los Angeles sticks.

333
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:32,877
Has he been treating you well?

334
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:34,798
No, but what else is new, right?

335
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,541
You just give me the order,
and... I'll make him dead.

336
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:39,982
- Really?
- Forget about it!

337
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,798
What do you want?

338
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:45,262
- Let's talk later.
- All right.

339
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:46,926
You smell nice.

340
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,111
Thank you, Leo.

341
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:50,351
Hey, I got you a little gift.

342
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,712
What did you get me?

343
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,313
From my travels.

344
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,264
It's a...

345
00:16:57,265 --> 00:17:00,144
I found it in Nigeria.

346
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:03,954
- And it will bring you luck.
- Thank you.

347
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:07,889
Africa ain't just a country
that gave us Bob Marley.

348
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,713
All right. Follow me.

349
00:17:10,706 --> 00:17:14,546
You don't get it?
It's funny!

350
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:18,833
Vivian, Vivian, mi amor.

351
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,138
Vivian.
Give me a twirl, Vivian.

352
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:22,164
Just one.

353
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:23,251
Come on.

354
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,027
All right.
Have a seat.

355
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,394
Harry's gonna be with you
in a minute.

356
00:17:29,395 --> 00:17:31,953
You're gonna want to put that away.

357
00:17:33,715 --> 00:17:36,595
Milo, she's not fucking around.
Put that away.

358
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:39,187
Five minutes, in and out.
Wait a minute, get a shot of the bear.

359
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:40,851
Quick!

360
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:43,123
Where's Bella?

361
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:44,436
She's waiting in the car.

362
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:48,170
- What?
- She's waiting in the car.

363
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:56,981
Harry...

364
00:17:56,982 --> 00:17:59,571
Hello, Leo.

365
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:02,162
Oh, thank you.

366
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,397
You have my file?

367
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:07,062
Got your file right here, Leo.

368
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:08,278
That camera's not on, is it?

369
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:11,536
- No, no.
- Milo...

370
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,000
- How is your day?
- Excellent, Leo.

371
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,601
- So, Leo.
- Yes.

372
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:27,667
I gotta ask you something, okay?

373
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:30,420
Shoot.

374
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:32,984
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

375
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:36,663
What do you mean?

376
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:40,922
Well, you know, you're fucking me
like a Thai hooker on payday, right?

377
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:42,843
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, a little bit.

378
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:43,835
Well, you know,

379
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:46,264
do you think that that judge
agreed to send you to rehab

380
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,475
because he thinks
you can get rehabilitated?

381
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,371
Are you asking me?

382
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah.

383
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,304
No.

384
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,480
"No"?

385
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:06,651
How about "fuck no"?

386
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:09,723
: How about he agreed
to send you to rehab because of me?

387
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:13,562
Because of Larry K. Rothstein!
Because he knows me!

388
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,485
And with that hanging on the line

389
00:19:15,486 --> 00:19:18,107
and with me making it
abundantly clear to you

390
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:21,245
that my reputation
hangs in the balance,

391
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:26,045
you, in your infinite fucking wisdom,
disappear for three fucking days!

392
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:30,813
Then I find out that you
get arrested in Calabasas?!

393
00:19:30,814 --> 00:19:34,237
So, you tell me,
you shit for fucking brains,

394
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:36,606
don't you think
that I got better things to do

395
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:40,029
than work for you,
you stupid fucking junkie cunt?!

396
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,261
Harry, Harry.

397
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:45,855
Milo, can you go
into the lobby with that?

398
00:19:45,856 --> 00:19:47,167
Yes.

399
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:49,277
Now?

400
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:51,870
I get a little
worked up sometimes

401
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,758
because I really believe in my work.

402
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,806
I know.

403
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:58,528
Now, I want you to be...

404
00:19:58,529 --> 00:19:59,840
clear...

405
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:03,199
absolutely clear
that you're there by 8:00 pm.

406
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,135
And do not forget
the 5,000 in cash,

407
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:11,774
or they will not even admit you.

408
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,792
Got it, H.R.

409
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:15,680
Will do.

410
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,010
Thank you.

411
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:21,697
All right.
Get out of here.

412
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,874
Scared the shit out of my brother
is what you did.

413
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,562
But he's all right.

414
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,906
Leo, where the fuck
are you gonna get $5,000 in cash?

415
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:37,091
I got it covered.

416
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:39,011
Just head down to Mulholland.

417
00:20:39,012 --> 00:20:40,162
You guys want a tan?

418
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,793
What?

419
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:45,892
What are you doing?

420
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:52,324
It's gonna get way darker,
and no skin cancer.

421
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:53,603
It's fucking cool as fuck!

422
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,172
That shit's
gonna make you orange.

423
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:56,868
Wait, is this Mulholland up here?

424
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:59,171
No, keep going straight.
We're gonna hit it.

425
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:01,925
Do I look orange?
No, I look tan.

426
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:05,188
Listen, it contains
a gentle tanning agent

427
00:21:05,189 --> 00:21:07,334
that blends
with your natural skin tone

428
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,285
so your color change is subtle.

429
00:21:09,286 --> 00:21:11,429
See? Subtle, not chalky.

430
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,741
Well, why do you want to be tan?

431
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:15,014
- He wants to be black.
- I am black!

432
00:21:16,454 --> 00:21:18,150
I'm supposed
to be in Hawaii right now,

433
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,797
so... uh, I got to look the part
for the homies in rehab.

434
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:23,143
Wait, you know
the people in rehab?

435
00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:26,119
Yes. It's always the same people
at these places.

436
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,155
Actually, it's where
we first tried heroin.

437
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:43,878
She's a little friendly.

438
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:48,062
- Hello!
- Leo!

439
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:50,215
Hey! It's so nice to see you.

440
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:51,785
Maybe I'll come up and... hi!

441
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:53,673
What're you doing with the camera?
Are you making a movie?

442
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:55,495
Oh, I love cameras!
Get in here!

443
00:21:55,496 --> 00:21:57,384
Hi. I have the most beautiful,
bitchin' house.

444
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:58,632
People just really love my house.

445
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,321
After all, I'm the bad girl.

446
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:03,496
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- Sure, no problem.

447
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:07,562
You, um, are extremely gorgeous.

448
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:09,258
- Would you like some carrot juice?
- Yes!

449
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:11,205
Carrot juice is good.
Why don't you go get some, sweetie?

450
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:14,891
- God, you smell so yum.
- Really?

451
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:16,715
Bella, why don't you come in here
and help me with the carrots?

452
00:22:16,716 --> 00:22:17,994
- Okay.
- Here you go.

453
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:20,007
Thanks.

454
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:25,805
Here comes director Daphne.

455
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:28,427
Come on, don't tickle me.
I'm trying to, like, film here.

456
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:32,107
Oh, wow. Too bad we can't hear
what they're saying, huh?

457
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:35,053
So, what's going on with you, bud?

458
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,653
I'm going to rehab.

459
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,276
Don't laugh at me.
I'm serious.

460
00:22:39,277 --> 00:22:40,236
Really?

461
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:41,868
Yeah. Really.

462
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:46,765
Well, then, why don't we go
have one last going-away party?

463
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:47,820
Cut!

464
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,299
- I told you guys not to worry.
- Yes! Thank you, Daphne!

465
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,222
- 5,000 dollars.
- Bella.

466
00:22:54,223 --> 00:22:56,430
- What?
- The check's made out to you.

467
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:58,319
Let me see.

468
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,379
- It's made out to you.
- What?

469
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,781
Why the fuck
does it have my name on it?

470
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:04,206
Well, actually, it's
from Daphne's husband, Ernie.

471
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:05,804
Daphne doesn't have
a checking account,

472
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:07,337
or at least,
that's what she told me.

473
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:20,430
Ernie's a producer
and an arms dealer on the side. Shh!

474
00:23:22,896 --> 00:23:25,584
Daphne let me borrow his car,
and he's pissed.

475
00:23:32,658 --> 00:23:34,896
So he knows my last name,
thusly, Milo's.

476
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:38,665
- And so on and so on and so forth.
- Can you please stop, really?

477
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:45,232
La, la, la, la, la.
You got your check?

478
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:47,664
Thank you.

479
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:50,065
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

480
00:23:50,066 --> 00:23:51,504
Leo, be careful with that.

481
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:53,426
Nice girl.

482
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:56,366
She's a breeder.

483
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:03,251
What's wrong, man?

484
00:24:03,252 --> 00:24:07,027
Nothing. It's just, like,
nothing has changed.

485
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,939
Nothing.

486
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:12,788
It's like you expect me to be your...

487
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:15,126
...your nurse, your caretaker,
your banker,

488
00:24:15,127 --> 00:24:17,651
whatever else the fuck
I can come up with.

489
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:19,508
Milo, don't.

490
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:24,309
I'm not always going to be there
to bail you out, you know?

491
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,028
- Yeah, you will.
- No, I won't.

492
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:29,398
It's like you have no idea
how your choices affect people.

493
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:34,357
Me or Mom... or Bella now.

494
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,742
Can you stop? Please?

495
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,629
Oh...

496
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,583
What? Is this annoying?

497
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,535
Stop!

498
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:46,806
Stop. Put it away, please.
It's not a toy.

499
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:48,502
Please? Come on.

500
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:50,485
- Now you know what's it's like.
- Fuck you, man!

501
00:24:50,486 --> 00:24:51,703
No, no, no, no...

502
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:53,496
Means "Go fuck yourself' in English!

503
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:56,216
We good?

504
00:24:56,217 --> 00:24:57,207
No.

505
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,151
What do you mean, "no"?

506
00:25:00,152 --> 00:25:03,064
Maybe you should call Ernie.
The thing is useless.

507
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:04,920
I felt like such
a fucking idiot in there.

508
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,872
Hey, have you ever thought
about just fucking giving up

509
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,310
and just doing your time?

510
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:10,226
Kill myself before I go back to jail.

511
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:16,121
I almost got stomped to death
for speaking with a fellow black man.

512
00:25:16,122 --> 00:25:18,067
The white dudes
didn't realize I was Italian.

513
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:22,040
- Where am I going?
- Head up to King's Road.

514
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,183
It's in Hollywood.

515
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,651
Now we stick to burglary?

516
00:25:40,187 --> 00:25:42,428
Max!

517
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:44,955
Open up!

518
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:47,316
Open up, bitch!

519
00:25:53,597 --> 00:25:54,588
Leo?

520
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,022
It's open.

521
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,877
I was still sleeping,
you fucking cunt.

522
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:00,540
How's it going, Max?

523
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:02,300
It's... What the fuck is this?

524
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:03,613
Hello.

525
00:26:03,614 --> 00:26:06,652
Max is going to save a brother
from incarceration, aren't you, Max?

526
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:07,933
MAX: What?

527
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,197
Search that shelf, Troy...

528
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,750
- What, did I wake you?
- Yeah, you woke me.

529
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,703
Well, wakey, wakey,
eggs and bakey.

530
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,655
Max. Bella. Milo.

531
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,317
- Hi.
- Hi.

532
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:25,277
Sit down.

533
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,159
It's okay. Sit. It's okay.

534
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,650
We're friends-ish.

535
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,806
Aren't you going to introduce us
to your friend?

536
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,696
MAX: That's Troy.

537
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,225
Troy, this is Leo, Stephanie.

538
00:26:40,226 --> 00:26:42,399
Bella.

539
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,792
Got a light?

540
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:47,355
No, there's...

541
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:52,128
So, uh...

542
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:56,000
My brother says
you're gonna help him.

543
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:57,505
With what?
Help you with what?

544
00:26:57,506 --> 00:26:58,722
What the fuck do you got...?

545
00:26:58,723 --> 00:27:00,801
What do you want from me, man?

546
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,719
You know what I want, Max.

547
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,960
Oh, come on, man.
You know... you hear,

548
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:08,482
it's not about the fucking $3,000
that I "apparently" owe you?

549
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:10,691
$3,000?!

550
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:11,938
- For what?!
- MAX: Aw, Jesus.

551
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:14,305
It was a fucking drunken night
of backgammon, okay?

552
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:17,345
I was pissed off
my fucking tits and...

553
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:18,498
It was stupid, okay?

554
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:21,251
I'm... I don't own him $3,000.

555
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:25,761
What are you doing, man?
Come on.

556
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:27,684
Giving you an opportunity, Max.

557
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:29,125
I don't have
a fucking housecleaner.

558
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:31,523
One more round,
11 points, double or nothing.

559
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,531
You win, we're even,
I win, six grand...

560
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:37,285
five for rehab,
and one for my brother and his wife.

561
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:39,493
I'm not his wife.
Just his partner.

562
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,534
Most people think
it's a game of luck.

563
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,348
Actually, it's largely
a matter of nerve.

564
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:46,823
Where's your nerve, Max?

565
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:48,294
MAX: Leo, Leo, Leo.
Just listen to me, man.

566
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:50,725
Leo, just listen to me,
okay, buddy?

567
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:52,230
We're not playing
backgammon, okay?

568
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:53,797
I've got no fucking money.

569
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,782
I've got zero money.
There's nothing, okay?

570
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:57,414
Leo, are you listening to me?

571
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:59,591
I mean, I haven't had
a fucking audition in, like, a year.

572
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:02,373
Ask Troy... I haven't had a fucking
phone call in a month from my agent.

573
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:04,004
He's probably fucking dead.

574
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:06,887
You're a fucking actor, Max?

575
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:07,847
Fuck you.

576
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:09,415
What, you want to see
my fucking show reel? I'll put it on.

577
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,439
No, no, it's okay, Max.

578
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,845
I don't want to see
your show reel.

579
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,799
MAX: Listen, listen.
I've got a solution here, okay?

580
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,272
I'm gonna get you guys
an espresso,

581
00:28:15,273 --> 00:28:17,000
and we will calm down
and fucking talk this out.

582
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:18,982
Do you want
an espresso, Stephanie?

583
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:20,742
- Steph...?
- Bella. Yes. Please.

584
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:23,366
MAX: All you guys
are fucking... just relax.

585
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,287
An espresso machine?

586
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,178
MAX:
No, just an espresso.

587
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,480
This is a graduation present
from my mother,

588
00:28:29,481 --> 00:28:32,807
and I'm not gonna give you...
this is my baby, okay?

589
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:34,889
Looks like your baby
is taking a trip, Max.

590
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,777
MAX:
Give me the cup.

591
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:37,992
Leo! Leo, Leo!

592
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:39,944
MAX:
Leo! For fuck's sake, man!

593
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:41,928
You fucking cunt!

594
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,620
I'm a cunt
with a new cappuccino machine!

595
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:47,369
MAX: It's an espresso machine,
you fucking moron!

596
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,386
What the fuck are we doing?
This is insane!

597
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:52,167
I don't know about you, guys,
but I'm collecting on a debt.

598
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:53,674
That baby's worth at least $1,000.

599
00:28:53,675 --> 00:28:56,009
You stole it, Leo!
We're accomplices!

600
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,386
This is fucking bullshit!

601
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,988
I know.
Did you see the look on his face?

602
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,203
You're fucking heartless!

603
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:02,282
It was the only thing he had
in his entire apartment.

604
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,683
It was a present from his mum!

605
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,564
Oh, my God!

606
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:10,633
Look, why don't we just find
somebody to buy this car legally?

607
00:29:10,634 --> 00:29:12,171
That would make
a lot more sense, I think,

608
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,741
than fucking stealing
espresso machines.

609
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:16,335
- That might be tough.
- What do you mean?

610
00:29:16,336 --> 00:29:18,477
I mean, uh, it's complicated.

611
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:20,397
Let me guess.
The car's not really ours.

612
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,989
It belongs to someone
who doesn't exactly exist.

613
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:25,515
- What?!
- What do you mean?

614
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,651
Well,
what're we gonna do?

615
00:29:28,652 --> 00:29:30,502
We're gonna sell the car.
I got a place.

616
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,230
I got to drive it in.
They know me.

617
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:44,017
- Oh, okay.
- I got to drive it in. Yeah.

618
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:58,184
Hey, what's this shit?

619
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,776
That's my brother.
Don't worry about it.

620
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:00,814
What's it for?

621
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,083
He's, he's like Mr. Arty.

622
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:03,903
It's his personal diary.
No one sees it.

623
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:05,745
How you doing?

624
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:14,002
Plus, I got a little surprise.

625
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:16,825
Careful.

626
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:19,942
- Bella, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

627
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,441
Mikey? Will you grab the cups
and the thing?

628
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:28,389
It's the cardboard thing, to the left.

629
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,327
There's cups and saucers.
Yeah, that's it.

630
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,270
Wait till you taste this shit.

631
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,591
What's, uh...?

632
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:41,340
What's going on in there?

633
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,123
Uh...

634
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:47,157
I think they're selling my stolen car.

635
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:50,999
Milo? Can you turn
the camera off?

636
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:53,940
Will you please turn it off?
Turn it off, please, please.

637
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:56,882
What's up?
What's your name?

638
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,800
It's all right if I film?

639
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:00,555
- Yeah, don't trip. It's cool.
- You sure?

640
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,448
Since you're Hermes' brother
and all, it's cool.

641
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:04,366
Cool with you
and your heina over here.

642
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,381
Fools around here call me Diego.

643
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,394
- How do you know my brother?
- Hermes?

644
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:11,147
Everybody know Hermes.

645
00:31:11,148 --> 00:31:12,489
So, you guys jack cars, too,
and shit?

646
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,055
You know, like some
Bonnie-and-Clyde-type shit?

647
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:16,326
No, no, no, no.
That's, that's...

648
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:19,204
...Herme... I mean, Leo...
Hermes' car.

649
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:21,188
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

650
00:31:21,189 --> 00:31:23,107
You wanna hear some crazy shit
about your brother?

651
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,706
Yeah, for sure.

652
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:28,766
Check this out. Like 10 days ago, right,
he bring me a 2004 Maybach.

653
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,077
Cherry.

654
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:31,867
He was up in the hills
with some producer's wife,

655
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:34,585
or some shit, you know,
doing his thing, his Hermes thing.

656
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:36,632
So, he's about to jet,

657
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:39,638
and he sees the keys,
space, missed opportunity, right?

658
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,621
I'm telling you,
this motherfucker's a beast.

659
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:42,611
So, he snatches up the car.

660
00:31:42,612 --> 00:31:45,076
Now, this is a 350,000 dollar car
we're talking about here,

661
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,546
and he's high as a kite.

662
00:31:46,547 --> 00:31:48,304
I mean, loaded.

663
00:31:48,305 --> 00:31:50,606
Balls of steel, man.

664
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:53,390
So, you guys are here
to double your money, too, and shit?

665
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:54,732
Double what money?

666
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:56,618
Hey, check this out, dawg.

667
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:57,931
Be careful
with that footage there,

668
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:00,967
'cause ain't nobody got me
or my operation on tape.

669
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:04,292
You know, it's gonna be worth
a million bucks someday.

670
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:06,884
- All right.
- Hey, D, Bella.

671
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:08,226
From the homeland.

672
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,634
Wow. Thank you.

673
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:10,593
Be careful. It's hot.

674
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:11,714
What the...?

675
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:13,407
- It's your new machine.
- Decaf?

676
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:14,590
You found the way to my heart.

677
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:16,767
Vince... Vince and I
talked it all out.

678
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,996
Let me just grab something
from the car real quick.

679
00:32:39,534 --> 00:32:42,029
What is that?

680
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:47,883
Hey! $3,500 in cash,
plus this beautiful car.

681
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,353
Better than the Impala.

682
00:32:49,354 --> 00:32:52,326
I don't know.
I think I like the Impala better.

683
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:53,572
Are you crazy?

684
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:56,580
This is a classic waiting to happen.
Get in.

685
00:32:56,581 --> 00:32:59,331
- All our shit's in the Impala.
- It's in the trunk. Get in.

686
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:00,640
- Feel that?
- It's ugly.

687
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:03,102
It's like you're
on your favorite sofa, you know?

688
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:04,893
You're gonna fall asleep in seconds.
You'll enjoy it.

689
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:08,092
Milo! Stop filming me,
and get in the fucking car.

690
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:10,172
Hey, Hermes!
I think we're even, bro!

691
00:33:11,418 --> 00:33:14,649
You think you've
got up on me, D, don't you?

692
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,862
See you next week!

693
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,445
Just a minor malfunction.

694
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:22,991
She hums like a kitten.
Get in, Milo.

695
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,380
I think Bella's got to drive, though.

696
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,427
- Why's that?
- Isn't this her car?

697
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:31,213
Borrow?
You didn't borrow shit, Leo!

698
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:34,121
You stole Daphne's husband's car
and took it to a chop shop!

699
00:33:34,122 --> 00:33:37,097
It's not a chop shop.
It's a parts place.

700
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,941
Who do you work for?
The FBl? The CIA? The IRS?

701
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:41,606
How do you expect
to stay out of prison...

702
00:33:41,677 --> 00:33:44,387
- The AARP?
- stealing Israeli arms-dealer's cars...

703
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,468
and selling them
at fucking chop shops?!

704
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:48,895
What did you do with the money
from the Maybach?

705
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:51,041
I spent it.

706
00:33:51,742 --> 00:33:56,218
I can't believe you only got
3,500 dollars and this car for my Impala,

707
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:58,200
which you said
was worth 20,000 dollars.

708
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:01,079
You're not gonna get
Blue Book prices at a parts place.

709
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,702
And this is a beautiful car, Bella.

710
00:34:03,703 --> 00:34:05,748
La-la-la.

711
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:11,311
Leo, where we going
to get the rest of the money?

712
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:14,127
First, let me pay my debt to Bella.

713
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:18,733
I owe her, uh, $800?

714
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:25,832
Hold on.
20, 40, 60, 80...

715
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:29,347
That's 100
for my debt to Bella.

716
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:31,076
Just stop.

717
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:32,548
Just keep your money.

718
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:35,458
Consider it my donation
to the Keep Leo Out of Prison Fund.

719
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:38,378
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

720
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:40,826
We'll probably waste
the next couple hours...

721
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:43,226
trying to make
that 800 dollars back.

722
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:44,956
You married a saint.

723
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,737
We're not married.
I keep telling you that.

724
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:49,815
Whatever you guys are,
she's a saint.

725
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:51,477
- Are you guys hungry?
- No.

726
00:34:51,478 --> 00:34:54,946
Yes! I'm starving. That's what
you can do, you can buy me lunch.

727
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:12,424
This place has the best
octopus dumplings on Earth.

728
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:14,661
Better than in China. I swear.

729
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:16,423
We're in a Vietnamese restaurant.

730
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:19,340
It's both. It's a hybrid.

731
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:22,848
Could you bring us
some Arctic Circle clams...

732
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:24,352
with sesame chili oil,

733
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:27,167
crispy, deep-fried
pork intestines,

734
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:30,557
deep-fried duck tongue
with spicy salt,

735
00:35:30,558 --> 00:35:34,072
half a dozen
hundred-year-old eggs,

736
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:37,911
pan-fried sea cucumber
with supreme gravy,

737
00:35:37,912 --> 00:35:40,311
one order of chicken feet...

738
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:43,059
I always like to do like...

739
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,468
experiments.

740
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:48,304
Su Gong and Hot Pot
with rice noodles.

741
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:51,438
You guys want anything?

742
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:54,604
Leo, we don't have time...

743
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:55,979
Hold that thought.
I got to hit the head.

744
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,898
- Leo, we don't have time.
- Bella, I gotta run.

745
00:35:57,899 --> 00:36:00,776
Can I just get
some noodles or something?

746
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:04,934
Oh, I think we're good.
Thanks.

747
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,532
I can't believe
he ordered all this food.

748
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:07,554
Do you think he's okay?

749
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,603
He's been in there awhile,
like, 20 minutes.

750
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:11,329
As soon as he gets back,

751
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,855
we're gonna drop him off,
we're gonna go to the airport,

752
00:36:13,856 --> 00:36:15,325
we're gonna fly to San Francisco,

753
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:17,789
and we'll be there in time
to do our interviews this afternoon.

754
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,868
I cancelled the interviews.

755
00:36:19,869 --> 00:36:21,114
You did what?

756
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,737
I cancelled the interviews.
Hours ago.

757
00:36:23,738 --> 00:36:25,271
Why would you do that?

758
00:36:25,272 --> 00:36:26,647
Because we were never
gonna make it.

759
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:29,398
And I should have known that
this morning at 5:00 am...

760
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,548
when I agreed to do this.

761
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,052
And you should have known it...

762
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:33,523
because you know
what your brother's like.

763
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,215
You knew we were never
gonna make this happen.

764
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:36,847
You knew we were never
gonna be able to come down here,

765
00:36:36,848 --> 00:36:39,534
swoop him into rehab,
and drive back up there in time.

766
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:43,146
This is our mission now, okay?
We're gonna...

767
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:47,050
Leo, what is your plan?
What do you wanna do?

768
00:36:47,051 --> 00:36:48,967
Milo, come on.
You've been pretty chill all day.

769
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:51,624
Why the sudden bout of anxiety?

770
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:56,421
Bella, you have to try
the hundred-year-old egg.

771
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:01,440
Yeah. It's fermented in straw
and horse urine for, like, 6 months.

772
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:05,950
It is wonderfully,
wonderfully perverse.

773
00:37:05,951 --> 00:37:09,397
A little too perverse for me.
No, thanks.

774
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:11,769
Come on.
Live a little. Bella?

775
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,659
- It smells like ass!
- I dare you, Bella.

776
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,306
Bella, what are you doing?
You're vegan!

777
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,225
She's living life.

778
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,023
I can't believe you're eating that!

779
00:37:27,024 --> 00:37:28,653
Oh, my God.

780
00:37:28,655 --> 00:37:30,445
It's good, right?

781
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,876
Not as bad as you would think.

782
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:36,327
A world without hundred-year-old
eggs is not worth living in.

783
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:40,645
That, and truffles found by dogs
and imported from Italy.

784
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:44,134
- I think pigs find truffles.
- The best are found by dogs.

785
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:45,347
I want to try something else.

786
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:47,010
All right.
How about the chicken feet?

787
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:49,183
If I could, I'd weigh 600 pounds.

788
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,549
I used to weigh 220,
until I started using again.

789
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,637
- What?
- Yeah.

790
00:37:52,638 --> 00:37:54,140
You?
I don't believe it.

791
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:57,086
I lost 60 pounds in 3 months.

792
00:37:57,787 --> 00:38:00,132
What's your secret?

793
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:03,383
I could put you on the diet,
but I don't think you'd be happy.

794
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:04,536
Not likely.

795
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:06,349
Yeah, you don't want
the diet that he's on.

796
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,334
- Pay the check.
- What?

797
00:38:08,335 --> 00:38:09,834
Meet me around back.

798
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:12,073
I may have solved
our money problems.

799
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:17,766
What the fuck?!

800
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,691
I knew there was something
up with this place.

801
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:21,293
That's disgusting!

802
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:24,114
- Our worries are over.
- You stole a dog now?!

803
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:26,037
I bought him, 100%%% legal.

804
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,795
Rescued him from an uncertain fate
as a Lo Mein side dish.

805
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,835
- You did what?!
- It's just 500. Relax.

806
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:34,758
Taco's a champion English Bulldog.

807
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:36,682
He was trained in Germany.
He's a police dog.

808
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:38,606
We'll get 2,000 for him, easy.

809
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,528
Watch.
Taco! Platz!

810
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,972
Platz!

811
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:43,670
Taco, platz!

812
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:45,783
No, he doesn't feel like platzing.

813
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:48,545
Okay, come on, Taco!

814
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:50,308
- Inside! Inside! Come on, Taco!
- Here we go!

815
00:38:50,309 --> 00:38:52,167
- Inside!
- Here we go!

816
00:38:52,168 --> 00:38:53,993
Come on.

817
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:56,397
I can't believe
you bought a fucking dog!

818
00:38:56,398 --> 00:38:58,001
- I think he's cute.
- Oh, my God!

819
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,347
He just slobbered
all over my camera!

820
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:01,688
Oh, no!

821
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:02,681
Oh, fuck!

822
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:04,827
He sneezed!

823
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:08,931
Bella, take a left.

824
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:15,599
- What time is it?
- It's, like, 12 something.

825
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,203
- Perfect.
- What do you mean "perfect"?

826
00:39:17,204 --> 00:39:19,865
Just take a right right here, Bella.

827
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:27,656
- What's going on?!
- These are my boys!

828
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,669
Jesus Christ!

829
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,023
One of them will buy the dog for sure.
Just pull into the gas station.

830
00:39:41,187 --> 00:39:43,876
Jesus Christ.

831
00:39:43,877 --> 00:39:45,827
What the fuck?!

832
00:39:50,868 --> 00:39:53,835
What's up, brother?!

833
00:39:55,282 --> 00:39:57,117
You guys, pull in over there!

834
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:10,442
Qu hubo? Qu pasa, loco?

835
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:13,004
- Nada, homes!
- What's up?

836
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:15,976
What's up with the camera, man?
New reality TV show?

837
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:17,831
Don't mind him.
Don't mind him.

838
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,775
I have this dog.
His name is Ducati.

839
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:23,622
He's born in Italy like me,
trained in Germany.

840
00:40:23,623 --> 00:40:25,639
He's like a 6,000 dollar
police dog.

841
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,814
- Police dog?!
- Yeah. You better watch out!

842
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:30,820
Listen, I'm in a little bit
of a situation.

843
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:33,379
So, I'm willing
to let him go for, like, 2.

844
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,441
200?

845
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:36,785
- 2 stack.
- Damn!

846
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:40,929
I'll give you two bills
right now, ese. Sold.

847
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,873
Can't do it, big homie.
Hey, where's Dizzy at?

848
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:47,040
Dizzy? He's over there.

849
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,928
- Hold Taco a sec.
- Taco?!

850
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:50,685
Ducati!
His nickname's Taco.

851
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:54,773
- Just watch him, all right?
- You're trippin' and lit.

852
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,683
Who's that crazy guy?

853
00:41:23,666 --> 00:41:26,517
Does he really think someone's going
to wanna buy a dog for 2,000 dollars?

854
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,002
This poor dog's
gonna die of heat exhaustion.

855
00:41:30,002 --> 00:41:31,081
Can you
give me the money, man?

856
00:41:31,082 --> 00:41:33,615
We're not gonna have anything left
at the rate you're spending it.

857
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,802
What? You don't trust me?

858
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:35,922
It's not that.

859
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:38,993
It's just that we both saw you give
that guy Dizzy money.

860
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:41,391
I owed him.
It's just 20, relax!

861
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:43,375
And then you went
into the bathroom and... and...

862
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,719
To shit!

863
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,662
You don't know what it's like
trying to come off drugs.

864
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:50,379
- I had the runs, you know? Damn.
- Oh.

865
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,907
- You're such a pushover.
- Who, me?

866
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:54,250
Yeah.

867
00:41:54,251 --> 00:41:56,108
"Oh... oh, okay".

868
00:41:56,109 --> 00:41:58,086
Take a left right up here.

869
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,673
What about Bill?
Does he still live in Venice?

870
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:04,328
- You read my mind.
- Who's Bill?

871
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:05,383
Does he want to buy a dog?

872
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:08,104
Bill is a very rich,
very eccentric family friend.

873
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,267
Leo, are you going to ask him?

874
00:42:19,268 --> 00:42:21,186
No, you ask him.
I'm not going to ask him.

875
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:24,539
All right.
Where the fuck is he?

876
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:42,138
Oh, there you are, Bill.

877
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:43,581
Oh, hey, Milo.

878
00:42:43,582 --> 00:42:45,020
How are you?

879
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,865
- Hope you don't mind the camera.
- BILL: No, I'm used to it.

880
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,818
I wouldn't know you without it.

881
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:52,210
So, um, what are you working on?

882
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:54,392
I'm working on kind of these
ol' mini-handcuffs here,

883
00:42:54,393 --> 00:42:55,734
and I was wondering
if I could make

884
00:42:55,735 --> 00:42:58,486
some thumb-cuff
kind of jewelry, you know?

885
00:42:58,487 --> 00:43:00,436
Just not sure how to...

886
00:43:00,437 --> 00:43:03,158
you know, you can't really put them
like that 'cause you can't do stuff.

887
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,397
I know you
haven't seen much of Leo lately,

888
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:09,489
but he has developed
a bit of a drug problem.

889
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:14,353
Well, you know,
life's been a little easier for you

890
00:43:14,354 --> 00:43:16,784
and a little harder on Leo.

891
00:43:16,785 --> 00:43:22,384
I feel an affinity with Leo,
and I also understand, you know,

892
00:43:22,385 --> 00:43:26,541
what it is to deal with a,
with a drug problem.

893
00:43:26,542 --> 00:43:29,996
I've got a lot of friends
that just ain't here anymore.

894
00:43:29,997 --> 00:43:34,796
A little miscalculation here,
a little error there.

895
00:43:34,797 --> 00:43:39,529
It's not like doing some big,
noble deed to help someone,

896
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,128
but you know that if you don't,
then, you know, he could be dead.

897
00:43:45,129 --> 00:43:47,942
Leo got himself
into a little trouble,

898
00:43:47,943 --> 00:43:51,240
so we've come to ask you
for a little loan.

899
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:55,077
Sure, no problem. 5, 10 dollars?
What can I do?

900
00:43:55,078 --> 00:43:58,658
We gotta get him into rehab,
and we need $2,500.

901
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,988
Well, fuck him!

902
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,139
Hey, Carmen!

903
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,969
Just tie him up.

904
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:03,405
Baby, come here!

905
00:45:03,406 --> 00:45:05,357
Oh!

906
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:06,574
Oh!

907
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:08,174
Oh, my God!

908
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:10,702
Oh, Frederico
said you got arrested.

909
00:45:10,703 --> 00:45:12,332
That it was serious.

910
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,508
Serious is what's going
to happen to Frederico

911
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:16,554
if he keeps telling people
my business.

912
00:45:16,555 --> 00:45:19,462
Leo!
I'm not other people.

913
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:25,382
When did you get out?

914
00:45:25,383 --> 00:45:27,144
I escaped.

915
00:45:27,145 --> 00:45:30,145
Don't tell anyone.

916
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:34,594
Oh...
This is my brother, Milo.

917
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:36,581
Camera crew following you.

918
00:45:36,582 --> 00:45:37,796
Hi!

919
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:39,522
Hi, hi! I'm Milo.

920
00:45:39,523 --> 00:45:42,243
- This is his wife, Bella.
- Hi. Partner, actually.

921
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:44,097
Hi. Carmen.

922
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:45,377
Partner, actually.

923
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:47,006
Come in.

924
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:50,976
God, these paintings are amazing!

925
00:45:50,977 --> 00:45:53,630
Thanks.

926
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:54,879
You did all these?

927
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,063
Wow!

928
00:45:56,064 --> 00:45:57,853
I'm about to have
my first one-woman show.

929
00:45:57,854 --> 00:45:59,389
Oh, that's so cool!

930
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,957
So, Brad's not going to be home
for a couple of hours,

931
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,267
so make yourselves at home.

932
00:46:02,268 --> 00:46:04,474
- So, who's Brad?
- Brad's her boyfriend.

933
00:46:04,475 --> 00:46:07,035
I've never met him...

934
00:46:07,036 --> 00:46:08,955
...and I'm not jealous.

935
00:46:08,956 --> 00:46:12,154
I've been trying to get her to run
away with me to Inner Mongolia.

936
00:46:12,155 --> 00:46:14,968
I'd wear, like,
a black suit with red trim.

937
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:16,632
She'd wear a red veil.

938
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:18,743
There'd be little ponies everywhere.

939
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:23,061
I'm totally "twitter-pated,"
can't you tell?

940
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:24,533
"Twitter-pated," huh?

941
00:46:24,534 --> 00:46:26,613
Ain't you ever seen Bambi?

942
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:31,155
Bye.

943
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:32,466
Hello?

944
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,867
Yes, this is she.
Can you hear me?

945
00:46:34,868 --> 00:46:38,704
Yeah, I don't...
Hold on one second, please.

946
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:42,189
Hi. Yeah, hold on...

947
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,767
What's up, guys?

948
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:49,676
Milo, how about
a little bit of privacy?

949
00:46:49,677 --> 00:46:50,828
- Sorry, sorry!
- Jesus.

950
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:53,105
I'm sorry. Sorry.

951
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,357
There you are!
Leo, get dressed! We gotta go!

952
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:22,019
- Let's go! Come on.
- Oh, okay.

953
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,426
Well, Carmen,
it was so nice to meet you.

954
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:24,834
Thank you for everything.

955
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:29,025
Listen, Leo told me about the little
money problem you guys are having.

956
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:30,944
- Yeah...
- I think I can help.

957
00:47:30,945 --> 00:47:32,576
Really?

958
00:47:32,577 --> 00:47:33,855
I need a shave.

959
00:47:33,856 --> 00:47:35,551
We're not gonna smoke it.

960
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,959
We sell it.

961
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,687
We break it up into four quarters

962
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:41,084
and sell it
for about twelve-fifty a pop.

963
00:47:41,085 --> 00:47:42,523
Yeah, that adds us to 5,000

964
00:47:42,524 --> 00:47:44,413
and turns us
into total drug traffickers.

965
00:47:44,414 --> 00:47:47,004
It sounds worse than it is, but it's
how I paid my way through art school.

966
00:47:47,005 --> 00:47:48,763
- Really?
- It's only pot.

967
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:50,267
It's practically legal
in California, anyway.

968
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,603
Wait. Let's just figure out
if this is our only option.

969
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:54,008
No, it's not legal.
It's not legal.

970
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:55,672
I mean, even if
we had a doctor's note,

971
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:58,711
it wouldn't cover us for transporting
a pound of marijuana.

972
00:47:58,713 --> 00:47:59,767
This is insane.

973
00:47:59,768 --> 00:48:02,519
We do a drug deal,
get me into rehab,

974
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:04,342
and then the student
becomes a teacher.

975
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:06,293
Listen, I have
this lawyer friend up north

976
00:48:06,294 --> 00:48:08,916
who got this guy off
for having 150 plants,

977
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:11,539
and, to top it off, at the end, the
government gave him his plants back.

978
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,107
- Can I have his number?
- It's a she.

979
00:48:13,108 --> 00:48:15,250
See, men get into trouble,
women get them out.

980
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:18,002
- Sound a little familiar?
- Can I have her number?

981
00:48:18,003 --> 00:48:21,042
- I think I might need a new lawyer.
- Listen, you guys, we can do this.

982
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:22,640
It's only a phone call away.

983
00:48:22,641 --> 00:48:24,272
I even know people
who want to buy it.

984
00:48:24,273 --> 00:48:26,798
Let's just focus on selling Taco.
This is becoming...

985
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:29,390
No! No one's gonna want
to buy that stupid dog, Leo, Jesus!

986
00:48:29,391 --> 00:48:30,671
It's not a stupid dog.

987
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:32,108
If I had feelings, I'd be hurt.

988
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,348
You guys, look. Listen.

989
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:36,107
I'll carry the stuff in my purse.

990
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:38,186
If we get busted,
I'll take the responsibility.

991
00:48:38,187 --> 00:48:39,885
You guys just play dumb.

992
00:48:39,886 --> 00:48:42,570
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

993
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:45,673
Whatever.
You know what I think?

994
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:47,399
All right. I'll call him
and see what he says.

995
00:48:47,689 --> 00:48:50,377
Are you seriously okay with this?

996
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:53,544
Milo, I mean, we do our best,
and we hope for the best.

997
00:48:53,545 --> 00:48:56,389
If we get busted,
we're completely fucked.

998
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,077
Milo! I can't believe
you're saying this now!

999
00:48:59,078 --> 00:49:00,356
At this point today,

1000
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:03,173
we have driven a stolen car,
sold the stolen car,

1001
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,836
sold the stolen espresso machine,

1002
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:08,610
and let a convicted felon
buy and use drugs.

1003
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:12,416
Either we commit a crime,
or we watch Leo go to prison.

1004
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:13,505
He's busy now.

1005
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:16,574
He'll call us back in an hour
with the spot to meet him.

1006
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:19,806
All right.

1007
00:49:20,927 --> 00:49:22,973
- We're gonna get you into rehab!
- Let's go swimming.

1008
00:49:22,974 --> 00:49:25,820
Swimming actually
sounds like a good idea.

1009
00:49:25,821 --> 00:49:27,131
Bella, what has gotten into you?

1010
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:29,244
That's why we came down here, right?
To go swimming?

1011
00:49:29,245 --> 00:49:30,968
I don't even recognize you
right now.

1012
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:31,995
Milo, come on!

1013
00:49:31,996 --> 00:49:34,042
There's nothing more we can do
about our shoot today, okay?

1014
00:49:34,043 --> 00:49:35,320
It's fucked.

1015
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:37,913
And at this point, we just have
to wait for Carmen's friend to call,

1016
00:49:37,914 --> 00:49:40,406
and it's hot and I have not showered,
and I'm exhausted,

1017
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:43,095
and, yeah, swimming actually
sounds like a good idea.

1018
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:16,651
Leo?

1019
00:50:16,652 --> 00:50:17,994
- What?
- Let me ask you something.

1020
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:21,130
Do you feel at all guilty
for getting us into this mess?

1021
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:22,793
Let me ask you something.

1022
00:50:22,794 --> 00:50:24,363
When are you gonna stop
living your life

1023
00:50:24,364 --> 00:50:28,162
like one giant fucking
documentary, huh?

1024
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:39,077
- Come on, answer me!
- Answer you?

1025
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,676
You're looking through a lens.

1026
00:50:40,677 --> 00:50:42,852
For fuck's sake,
who am I talking to? You?

1027
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:44,867
You're talking to all of us.
You're talking to her, to her.

1028
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:46,659
You're talking to the camera.
You're talking to me.

1029
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:47,779
Come on! For the record.

1030
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,185
Speak!

1031
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:51,457
I appreciate
you guys came down here.

1032
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,640
Fuck!

1033
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:54,657
I do, but I didn't make you.

1034
00:50:54,658 --> 00:50:55,649
Excuse me?

1035
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,473
I didn't make you guys
come down here.

1036
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:59,808
- I gotta hear this.
- It was your choice.

1037
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,237
Face it... the only reason why
you came down here in the first place

1038
00:51:02,238 --> 00:51:04,824
is you don't want to feel guilty
about not helping out your brother,

1039
00:51:04,825 --> 00:51:05,788
plus the fact...

1040
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:07,195
That's the most warped
reason I've ever heard.

1041
00:51:07,196 --> 00:51:09,818
you still feel bad
about the time you sent me to jail.

1042
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:11,419
That's really
why you're here, isn't it?

1043
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,379
No.

1044
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,883
All right, that's the biggest
fucking piece of horse shit...

1045
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:14,873
I've ever heard.

1046
00:51:14,874 --> 00:51:16,728
I care, he cares, we're here.

1047
00:51:16,729 --> 00:51:18,680
Goddammit, you are
the most ungrateful person

1048
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:20,249
I've ever met in my entire life.

1049
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,335
I can't believe you.

1050
00:51:21,336 --> 00:51:23,223
- Ungrateful?
- Yeah! Ungrateful!

1051
00:51:23,224 --> 00:51:24,214
He doesn't really care.

1052
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,365
What the fuck
are you talking about?!

1053
00:51:25,366 --> 00:51:26,710
How can he not care?!

1054
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:28,725
Listen, he'll call my girlfriend

1055
00:51:28,726 --> 00:51:30,484
and say, "I'm worried
my little brother's dead,"

1056
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:34,579
and she'll say, "Come over
for dinner. Talk to him".

1057
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,266
And he'll say, "Ah, that's okay,
I'll call in a couple weeks".

1058
00:51:37,267 --> 00:51:38,545
- I'm out of town!
- A couple of weeks!

1059
00:51:38,546 --> 00:51:41,169
- I'm out of town!
- You're always out of town, man!

1060
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,513
What does he mean,
"sent me to jail"?

1061
00:51:42,514 --> 00:51:46,223
- I didn't send him to jail.
- The worst idea ever.

1062
00:51:46,224 --> 00:51:49,679
- Next time... I'll kill you.
- What?

1063
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,086
I got arrested at this motel,

1064
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:54,925
and cops said,
"You live over on Laurel Canyon?

1065
00:51:54,926 --> 00:51:58,476
Your brother sent us
three days ago".

1066
00:51:58,477 --> 00:52:01,739
It was your friend who called
saying, "Your brother's gonna die.

1067
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,787
He's been doing speedballs
for 10 days, and he's gonna die,

1068
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,193
and if you want to live with yourself,

1069
00:52:05,194 --> 00:52:06,920
and you know you could have
done something to stop it,

1070
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:08,360
that's up to you".

1071
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:10,889
And what happens
when I get stabbed in jail...

1072
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:13,128
because you called
the fucking cops?

1073
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,686
Does he cop up to that?
To that phone call he made saying,

1074
00:52:15,687 --> 00:52:17,704
"Your brother's gonna die
if you don't call the police"?

1075
00:52:17,705 --> 00:52:19,045
Why didn't he call, then?

1076
00:52:19,046 --> 00:52:21,766
He said, "I'm not his brother.
You are".

1077
00:52:21,767 --> 00:52:23,589
Wow, so, riddle me this, Sherlock...

1078
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,635
What happens
when I find a dirty needle in jail...

1079
00:52:25,636 --> 00:52:28,257
and get some kinda weird disease?

1080
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:29,601
People don't shoot up
in jail, do they?

1081
00:52:29,602 --> 00:52:31,203
What?

1082
00:52:31,204 --> 00:52:32,419
People shoot up in jail?

1083
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,393
Yeah. The whole dorm.
We all share one needle.

1084
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:37,191
I didn't know that.

1085
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:43,958
What you don't know
could fill up the Staples Center.

1086
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,024
- This it?
- This is it.

1087
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,635
- Come on, Taco.
- This is one of his new spots.

1088
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,106
What is this?

1089
00:52:54,107 --> 00:52:55,992
It's his not-so-legal operation.

1090
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:57,144
He used to have one
in Diamond Bar,

1091
00:52:57,145 --> 00:52:59,896
but there was just way
too much heat on the operation.

1092
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:01,177
Cops?

1093
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,873
Feds.

1094
00:53:02,874 --> 00:53:04,823
Do you think he'd
let me come in there and film?

1095
00:53:04,824 --> 00:53:07,216
Um, I doubt it, but I'll ask.

1096
00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:09,878
She's so cool.

1097
00:53:09,879 --> 00:53:12,334
She's nice, huh?

1098
00:53:13,846 --> 00:53:15,378
What the hell
does she see in you?

1099
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:18,384
I don't know.
That's a good question.

1100
00:53:20,052 --> 00:53:22,289
- He said yes.
- He did?

1101
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,065
Yeah. I can't believe your luck.

1102
00:53:32,591 --> 00:53:35,567
- Carmen, my sweet!
- Ivan.

1103
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:39,501
This the man
with movie camera, obviously.

1104
00:53:39,502 --> 00:53:41,994
I used to go to film school
in Ukraine.

1105
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:43,595
Lots of fun those days.

1106
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:45,228
Frederico probably told you

1107
00:53:45,229 --> 00:53:48,874
about Leo's
little scrape with the law.

1108
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:50,889
- Yeah...
- So his lawyer...

1109
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:51,881
Rothstein.

1110
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:53,767
I hooked him up with that guy.

1111
00:53:53,768 --> 00:53:55,560
- Really?
- Yeah.

1112
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:57,442
Yeah.

1113
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,672
He got him into rehab.

1114
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:07,496
Problem is, we're a little light
in the admission-fee area.

1115
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:11,267
- How light?
- 25 hundred.

1116
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:14,562
So, you see...

1117
00:54:14,563 --> 00:54:15,907
We were hoping
you would break us off...

1118
00:54:15,908 --> 00:54:20,384
2,500 in Pretty Pussy product,

1119
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,560
so we can go door-to-door.

1120
00:54:22,561 --> 00:54:24,799
Just to raise the funds for Leo.

1121
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,086
You want me to front you
2,500 of Pretty Pussy.

1122
00:54:29,087 --> 00:54:32,155
No. Not front.

1123
00:54:32,156 --> 00:54:34,452
We want the wholesale rate.

1124
00:54:35,166 --> 00:54:38,139
- Like what you sell it to Petco for!
- What do you guys make here?

1125
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,227
Cat toys.

1126
00:54:39,228 --> 00:54:42,169
For cats.
Toys that cats like.

1127
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,898
Take.

1128
00:54:43,899 --> 00:54:47,319
- That's a big business, huh?
- Big business, cat toys. Take.

1129
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,615
I would never ask,
but you know how I feel about Leo.

1130
00:54:58,068 --> 00:55:01,584
Give tour.

1131
00:55:08,624 --> 00:55:10,482
So...

1132
00:55:10,483 --> 00:55:12,721
What happens in here?

1133
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:15,502
We grow.

1134
00:55:16,302 --> 00:55:17,767
We clip.

1135
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:23,205
And here, they finished.

1136
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:25,100
Do you like to smoke it?

1137
00:55:25,837 --> 00:55:27,914
What do you think?

1138
00:55:27,915 --> 00:55:30,697
You like green.
You match.

1139
00:55:30,698 --> 00:55:32,425
It is the color of money.

1140
00:55:35,721 --> 00:55:37,223
Got it!

1141
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:38,502
Holy shit!

1142
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:42,217
Oh, my God!

1143
00:55:42,218 --> 00:55:43,911
There's this
design studio downtown,

1144
00:55:43,912 --> 00:55:47,013
full of ex-gang members,
graffiti artists, editors.

1145
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,251
Great friends of mine.
They'll want some.

1146
00:55:49,252 --> 00:55:51,426
All right. Let's go.

1147
00:56:21,434 --> 00:56:23,642
- What did you say?
- Who feels like smoking a fatty?

1148
00:56:23,643 --> 00:56:25,399
I do!

1149
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,192
Aren't we risking enough,
like, carrying it?

1150
00:56:27,193 --> 00:56:29,142
Do we have to actually
smoke it in the car?

1151
00:56:29,143 --> 00:56:30,839
It's bad enough
that we're holding all this.

1152
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,504
Come on, Milo.
Such a naysayer.

1153
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:48,234
Look at this.
It's so cool.

1154
00:56:49,297 --> 00:56:52,974
"I believe today
is gonna be a wonderful day.

1155
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:56,399
Each day better than the next.

1156
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,214
I am always in the right place
at the right time".

1157
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:03,853
Can't argue with that.
"My mind has unlimited potential".

1158
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,481
Very true.

1159
00:57:06,411 --> 00:57:08,363
He's down the hall.

1160
00:57:08,364 --> 00:57:09,739
Thanks.

1161
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,330
Sandy, come read
the affirmations with me!

1162
00:57:12,331 --> 00:57:14,622
- Hermes?
- Oh, my...

1163
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,375
What the fuck are you
doing here? How are you?

1164
00:57:21,929 --> 00:57:24,645
- I heard you were upstate.
- I heard you were dead, man.

1165
00:57:24,646 --> 00:57:26,725
- Who told you that?
- Jessica.

1166
00:57:26,726 --> 00:57:28,092
She wants me dead.

1167
00:57:29,031 --> 00:57:30,564
It looks good.

1168
00:57:30,565 --> 00:57:32,549
I mean, what's
with the paparazzi and shit?

1169
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:36,642
Oh, it's just my brother.
He's got issues. Don't worry.

1170
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:37,697
How are you?

1171
00:57:37,698 --> 00:57:39,939
It's like his own personal diary.

1172
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,154
- Don't worry.
- All right.

1173
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:42,144
No one will see it.

1174
00:57:42,145 --> 00:57:44,000
I am very impressed.
Very cool.

1175
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:46,781
Yeah.
I'm a computer designer now.

1176
00:57:46,782 --> 00:57:48,896
Well, I'm trying
to get into rehab myself...

1177
00:57:48,897 --> 00:57:51,933
Well, this ain't it.
This isn't rehab. You're lost.

1178
00:57:53,823 --> 00:57:56,473
And, and, um...

1179
00:57:56,474 --> 00:58:00,379
I'm selling some weed
to raise funds to get into rehab.

1180
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:02,073
So you want some?

1181
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:07,258
No, man.
I don't do drugs anymore.

1182
00:58:07,259 --> 00:58:10,649
I'm three months, five days,
and two hours sober.

1183
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:13,750
- No one's going to see this!
- You know what? I'll sponsor you.

1184
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,508
Okay, you could sponsor me.

1185
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:17,588
Fuck the weed.
Just come check out this dog.

1186
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:19,509
He's a police dog.
His name is Cereberus.

1187
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,781
You're gonna love him.
Come on!

1188
00:58:21,782 --> 00:58:24,307
Did you not read
the "no soliciting" sign at the door?

1189
00:58:24,308 --> 00:58:25,970
Are you gonna report me now?

1190
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:27,218
When was
the last time I saw you?

1191
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:31,859
- Was it at The Coach and Hound?
- Horses! Horses!

1192
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,286
Milo.

1193
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:35,920
No dice. Let's go.

1194
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,806
Y grapes, tambin.

1195
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:41,933
- Y watermelon!
- Y watermelon, sanda!

1196
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:44,236
I knew that, I think.

1197
00:58:44,237 --> 00:58:47,621
- "Watermeloney".
- Gracias.

1198
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,706
Muchas gracias!

1199
00:58:49,707 --> 00:58:52,138
Qu calor! A ver...

1200
00:58:52,139 --> 00:58:53,449
Qu caliente!

1201
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:56,232
No. How do you say "heat"
in Spanish?

1202
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,960
How did it go in there?

1203
00:58:57,961 --> 00:58:58,918
You didn't sell any?!

1204
00:58:58,919 --> 00:59:00,678
No!
Dealing's a tough gig, man.

1205
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:03,103
I'm not made for this shit.

1206
00:59:04,552 --> 00:59:06,533
Copping's a tough gig, lady.

1207
00:59:06,534 --> 00:59:08,869
- Nobody wants to buy weed.
- They want the harder shit.

1208
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:11,010
Right, Leo?

1209
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:14,629
Hey, is this the, uh...?

1210
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,293
Is this the South Central Farm?

1211
00:59:16,294 --> 00:59:17,924
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, what's left of it.

1212
00:59:17,925 --> 00:59:19,521
I read about this.

1213
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:20,961
: That's it now?

1214
00:59:20,962 --> 00:59:22,369
Do you know the story?

1215
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:25,026
Some developer
bought the land 15 years ago,

1216
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:26,976
then the city took it
under eminent domain...

1217
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:29,023
to build a garbage-incinerator site.

1218
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:30,942
The community protested...

1219
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,873
and then built the largest
urban farm in the United States.

1220
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:45,098
Then the developer sued the city
to get his land back, won,

1221
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:47,200
and then refused to sell it
back to the community...

1222
00:59:47,201 --> 00:59:49,708
even though they raised
16 million dollars to get it back.

1223
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,248
People are so deceptive and greedy.

1224
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,795
The only thing you can do
is get as intoxicated as possible...

1225
00:59:55,796 --> 00:59:57,710
until it's all just fucking over.

1226
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:59,716
That's such bullshit!

1227
00:59:59,717 --> 01:00:01,912
You can actually
do something about it!

1228
01:00:01,913 --> 01:00:03,919
Like what?
Make movies?

1229
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,497
For example, yes.

1230
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:17,707
- Can we drive around, and shoot this?
- No. We're in a hurry.

1231
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:20,102
Look at that.
They're pulling out the last tree.

1232
01:00:26,934 --> 01:00:30,426
People go to the movies
to be entertained, that's it.

1233
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:32,034
Nobody wants to be whipped.

1234
01:00:32,035 --> 01:00:34,056
People were protesting that farm
for months.

1235
01:00:34,057 --> 01:00:36,004
The bitch didn't eat
for, like, 28 days.

1236
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:37,271
Please don't call her a bitch.

1237
01:00:37,272 --> 01:00:39,772
Did that make a difference?

1238
01:00:39,773 --> 01:00:41,824
Should have killed the developer.

1239
01:00:41,825 --> 01:00:43,148
Violence just begets violence.

1240
01:00:43,149 --> 01:00:46,110
It'll just perpetuate the cycle
of oppression and inequality.

1241
01:00:46,111 --> 01:00:48,911
- What does that get you?
- Yeah, that's one to grow on.

1242
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:58,227
What?
So, Leo, you're saying...

1243
01:00:58,228 --> 01:00:59,598
he should have
been motivated by fear?

1244
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,481
Fear may be
the one thing stronger than greed.

1245
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:13,001
- Are you all right, Leo?
- Yeah, I'm just cold.

1246
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,366
You're cold?
You're all sweaty.

1247
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,259
- It's freezing.
- It's as hot as balls in here.

1248
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:20,013
- Yeah.
- I'm melting.

1249
01:01:22,006 --> 01:01:24,561
Just hold on a little longer.

1250
01:01:24,862 --> 01:01:28,001
They got good meds in rehab.
You'll do all right.

1251
01:01:28,361 --> 01:01:30,093
I'm serious.

1252
01:01:32,494 --> 01:01:34,240
You're serious.

1253
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:07,996
My life's like that accident.
You're just slowing down to look.

1254
01:02:57,631 --> 01:03:00,006
- Where are we?
- Jordan Downs.

1255
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:03,713
- You think I can film here?
- Yeah, they'd love it.

1256
01:03:03,937 --> 01:03:06,257
- What's Jordan Downs?
- The projects.

1257
01:03:15,336 --> 01:03:18,298
- This is Milo, the cameraman.
- Fuck you!

1258
01:03:19,457 --> 01:03:21,084
This is Bella.

1259
01:03:21,085 --> 01:03:22,682
I can give you
a better name than that.

1260
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:24,377
MAN 2: What's up, baby?
Where the fuck you been, man?

1261
01:03:24,378 --> 01:03:26,815
Leo, what you doing, baby?
Chill out, brother!

1262
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:28,498
You know
I like to come and hang out,

1263
01:03:28,499 --> 01:03:29,839
but I do have a problem.

1264
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,894
You know, you bring problems.

1265
01:03:30,895 --> 01:03:34,074
We'll fuck you up right here.

1266
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:41,258
You know
I wouldn't bullshit you, right?

1267
01:04:03,452 --> 01:04:06,550
Barbeque!
Oh, you guys hungry?

1268
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,967
Yeah, I'm starving.

1269
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:19,780
The one
with the snake-looking ass.

1270
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:22,112
Desert-horse-looking ass.

1271
01:04:22,113 --> 01:04:23,899
This is the don around here.
You see me, man?

1272
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:24,826
This the don.

1273
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:27,767
These my, these my goons
right here, man, making this money.

1274
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:29,142
You see us, man?

1275
01:04:29,143 --> 01:04:31,280
Why don't you tell the world
about Jordan Downs Projects?

1276
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:32,624
Fuck them if they don't love us.

1277
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:33,582
- What's it like here?
- Like hell.

1278
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:35,594
It's like hell.

1279
01:04:35,595 --> 01:04:37,543
It's crazy.
So much shit can happen.

1280
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:39,268
You could get shoot right now, man.

1281
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:41,023
Big homies and shit
just chillin' , you know,

1282
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:42,593
living the good life
out here, though.

1283
01:04:42,594 --> 01:04:44,700
Getting money and shit.
That's all we tryin' to do.

1284
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:46,075
- You feel me?
- Why's it like hell?

1285
01:04:46,076 --> 01:04:47,959
Man, this shit crazy.
Police can come snatch you up.

1286
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,259
Police don't let a nigga live out here.

1287
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,462
- We ain't got no freedom.
- None of that and shit, man.

1288
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:54,539
What do the police
most bother you guys about?

1289
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,232
Shit. Gang injunction.

1290
01:04:56,233 --> 01:04:57,483
- Everything.
- What's that?

1291
01:04:57,484 --> 01:04:58,918
Shit, you can't be
around three people.

1292
01:04:58,919 --> 01:05:00,548
They can come get us right now
if they wanted to.

1293
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:01,857
- For nothing.
- For what?

1294
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:03,646
- For being like this.
- For being too deep.

1295
01:05:03,647 --> 01:05:04,732
Plus, I got purple on.

1296
01:05:04,733 --> 01:05:08,116
- What's the purple signify?
- Grape...

1297
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:09,941
Red and blue make purple.

1298
01:05:09,942 --> 01:05:10,964
You didn't know that?

1299
01:05:10,965 --> 01:05:12,622
Want two crayons to see?

1300
01:05:12,623 --> 01:05:14,348
We definitely gonna sell
this motherfucking weed,

1301
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:15,370
you know what I'm saying?

1302
01:05:15,371 --> 01:05:17,672
I got you. I got some
little hungry cats over there.

1303
01:05:17,673 --> 01:05:19,015
They probably suck that right up.

1304
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:21,043
- You guys play for money?
- Yeah, we shoot for money.

1305
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:24,383
Can you get arrested for gambling?

1306
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:25,948
They can take your money
out your pocket

1307
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:27,672
and the dice and all that.

1308
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,784
We live
for this shit right here, though.

1309
01:05:29,785 --> 01:05:31,940
Living the ghetto life.

1310
01:05:56,015 --> 01:05:57,930
Twelve-fifty for a motherfucking
quarter pound, man.

1311
01:05:57,931 --> 01:06:00,938
That's all we going for, man.
Whatever.

1312
01:06:00,939 --> 01:06:02,721
You want four?

1313
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:04,192
Man, call your bosses, man.

1314
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,461
We don't want to be getting
into this bullshit, man.

1315
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,941
25, big homey.

1316
01:06:14,994 --> 01:06:16,015
We got 23.

1317
01:06:16,016 --> 01:06:17,547
Why you trying to haggle me for this?

1318
01:06:17,548 --> 01:06:19,147
- Do you know where this is from?
- Pull that shit out, man.

1319
01:06:19,148 --> 01:06:20,936
Let them see that, man.
That's real shit.

1320
01:06:20,937 --> 01:06:23,587
Did you smell it?

1321
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:26,634
If you guys want
to do some stuff, man...

1322
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:33,106
She'll come back for the two.

1323
01:06:33,107 --> 01:06:34,195
Two gonna be right now, man.

1324
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:35,984
We got three,
fucking three, man, last week.

1325
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:37,231
She ain't take it, daddy.

1326
01:06:49,691 --> 01:06:52,032
No luck, huh?

1327
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,914
No.

1328
01:06:55,188 --> 01:06:57,309
This is it for me.

1329
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:02,233
You worried
about him going to prison?

1330
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:05,397
Me too.

1331
01:07:08,478 --> 01:07:12,007
I can't believe he never told me
he had a brother.

1332
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:15,712
So, how come
you guys aren't... together?

1333
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:18,254
You know what it's like.

1334
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:20,074
To love an addict?

1335
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:23,092
Yeah, to love an addict.

1336
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:48,543
- You want the real shit, right?
- Follow me.

1337
01:07:48,544 --> 01:07:49,726
Where's Bella?

1338
01:07:49,727 --> 01:07:52,408
- She's in the fucking...
- She's where?

1339
01:07:52,409 --> 01:07:54,422
She's with Carmen.
She'll be fine.

1340
01:07:54,423 --> 01:07:56,339
Leo, we got, like,
an hour left.

1341
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:57,840
You wanna make
a documentary, right?

1342
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,055
Not right now.

1343
01:07:59,056 --> 01:08:00,429
Follow me.

1344
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:01,930
Leo...

1345
01:08:01,931 --> 01:08:04,402
Time's running out, man.
What are we doing here?

1346
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:06,435
I don't wanna make...
I can't film in here.

1347
01:08:06,436 --> 01:08:08,767
Come on in.
These are my friends.

1348
01:08:08,768 --> 01:08:10,124
Come on in!

1349
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:17,244
- I can't talk to these people.
- Just talk to them.

1350
01:08:22,251 --> 01:08:23,657
You Hermes' brother?

1351
01:08:23,658 --> 01:08:25,288
Yeah.

1352
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:26,468
You mind if I film you?

1353
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:29,747
Yeah. You want me to look
in the camera, or what?

1354
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,190
You know, your brother's,
like, an angel.

1355
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:39,025
Takes care of, like,
nine people down here.

1356
01:08:39,026 --> 01:08:42,604
Keeps, like, a constant supply
of clean needles.

1357
01:08:42,605 --> 01:08:44,522
People use
dirty needles otherwise?

1358
01:08:44,523 --> 01:08:46,435
We use whatever
we can get, you know?

1359
01:08:46,436 --> 01:08:49,344
The government
don't give us clean needles.

1360
01:08:49,345 --> 01:08:51,231
They want us dead.

1361
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:53,722
Your brother...

1362
01:08:53,723 --> 01:08:57,110
about two weeks ago, he, uh...

1363
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:59,855
helped a sister buy a house.

1364
01:08:59,856 --> 01:09:01,967
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1365
01:09:01,968 --> 01:09:04,554
Yeah, he, uh...

1366
01:09:04,555 --> 01:09:07,524
See, her baby's daddy O.D.'d, right,

1367
01:09:07,525 --> 01:09:10,337
and left her...

1368
01:09:10,338 --> 01:09:13,372
homeless, and she had, like,
all this debt,

1369
01:09:13,373 --> 01:09:17,110
and he shows up
one day with, like...

1370
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:20,242
like, fuck, 20 G's, man, boom!

1371
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:22,159
- Just gave it to her.
- The Maybach...

1372
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,776
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

1373
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:27,951
Doesn't that just allow people
to keep living like this...

1374
01:09:27,952 --> 01:09:30,689
instead of getting sober
and cleaning up their lives?

1375
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:32,510
- I mean...
- What?

1376
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:34,652
You rather...

1377
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:36,981
they get AIDS?

1378
01:09:36,982 --> 01:09:40,849
Bring it home
to their family and their kids?

1379
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,991
- No.
- You sure you're his brother, man?

1380
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:44,236
That didn't come out right. I mean...

1381
01:09:44,237 --> 01:09:49,878
You'd be surprised how far
a little love and just care goes.

1382
01:09:51,362 --> 01:09:54,556
People need that.

1383
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,591
Come on in.

1384
01:09:57,592 --> 01:10:02,098
- Oh, shit!
- It's okay. You can film this.

1385
01:10:02,099 --> 01:10:05,245
This is like your office, huh?

1386
01:10:06,186 --> 01:10:09,094
What're you doing
with the water?

1387
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:13,659
I'm... uh,
getting ready to cook.

1388
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:16,548
I've never seen this
in real life before.

1389
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:22,369
That is so nasty, dude.

1390
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,989
It's not what it looks like
in the movies at all.

1391
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:38,277
You always see a bunch of guys
getting all euphoric after they fix.

1392
01:10:40,343 --> 01:10:42,879
Bunch of dramatic movie bullshit.

1393
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:49,257
- What does it feel like?
- Used to feel fucking amazing.

1394
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:51,044
Imagine...

1395
01:10:51,045 --> 01:10:52,832
floating on...

1396
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:55,643
a billion tiny satin pillows.

1397
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:59,095
And then imagine,
when you weren't that high,

1398
01:10:59,096 --> 01:11:01,198
what used to just feel normal...

1399
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:05,426
now feels...
lower than you've ever felt before.

1400
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:09,958
It used to give me this... uh,
sense of meaning and oneness...

1401
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:11,299
about everything,

1402
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,719
but...
now I just fix not to get sick.

1403
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,020
I don't even get high anymore.

1404
01:11:17,021 --> 01:11:18,872
A little high.

1405
01:11:22,709 --> 01:11:25,787
Whoa, are you shooting your foot?

1406
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:28,123
Dude, it's all infected.
What're you doing?

1407
01:11:28,124 --> 01:11:30,375
Well, I can't watch.
It makes me nauseous.

1408
01:11:30,376 --> 01:11:32,513
That's right.

1409
01:11:32,514 --> 01:11:36,351
You get nauseous
when you see a papercut.

1410
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:38,340
Come on, man. Let's go.

1411
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:40,215
We'll figure something out.
We'll get you to rehab.

1412
01:11:43,824 --> 01:11:45,408
You don't have to do this.

1413
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:47,070
Dude, we still got,
like, an hour and a half.

1414
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:48,987
We're gonna figure something out.
We always do.

1415
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:51,990
I can just take one more big shot
and go to sleep for good.

1416
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:53,890
No, don't be ridiculous.

1417
01:11:53,891 --> 01:11:55,808
Yeah, and then, uh...

1418
01:11:55,809 --> 01:11:58,211
it'll all be over,
and you'll go back to your life.

1419
01:11:58,212 --> 01:12:00,313
Oh, no.
Don't say that, man.

1420
01:12:00,314 --> 01:12:02,466
Please.

1421
01:12:04,998 --> 01:12:06,663
Come on. Let's go.

1422
01:12:11,718 --> 01:12:13,964
There you guys are!
Where the fuck have you been?

1423
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:16,423
Get in the car.
I have an idea.

1424
01:12:16,424 --> 01:12:17,581
Where we going?

1425
01:12:17,582 --> 01:12:18,991
Come on.
Carmen left with Brad,

1426
01:12:18,992 --> 01:12:21,316
but I got the weed,
and we have a plan.

1427
01:12:28,547 --> 01:12:30,846
What is this place?
Where'd you hear about this?

1428
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:33,913
My new friends in Watts
told me about this guy.

1429
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:36,296
This guy will buy...
anything for anything.

1430
01:12:36,297 --> 01:12:38,334
It's a last-ditch effort.

1431
01:12:38,335 --> 01:12:41,191
We gotta get rid of this weed.
We gotta see if it's gonna work.

1432
01:12:41,192 --> 01:12:42,311
Just follow my lead, okay?

1433
01:12:42,312 --> 01:12:44,261
- Carmen gave you the weed?
- I have an idea. What?

1434
01:12:44,262 --> 01:12:47,008
- Carmen gave you the weed?
- Yeah, it's in the car.

1435
01:12:53,997 --> 01:12:55,906
Do you see a door-bell?

1436
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.

1437
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,005
I got my gloves on...

1438
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,889
Hi! Mr... uh, Shasta?

1439
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:07,976
Yeah, that's right.

1440
01:13:07,977 --> 01:13:10,597
Well, what you be doing here?
What y'all be filming?

1441
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:13,095
- We are, um...
- You got a license for that shit?

1442
01:13:13,096 --> 01:13:16,324
Yeah, absolutely.
Actually... um, we're here...

1443
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,147
Disturbing me on my day of rest.

1444
01:13:18,148 --> 01:13:21,025
I'm so sorry. We're here...
a friend of yours recommended you...

1445
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:23,424
because we're actually
from a new cable reality show,

1446
01:13:23,425 --> 01:13:26,145
and we are doing a segment
on high-rollin' strollers.

1447
01:13:26,146 --> 01:13:27,520
Kind of a "Cribs"- type show.

1448
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:28,702
Ziggy sent you?

1449
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:32,029
It's not Ziggy. It's a friend of yours
actually down in Watts.

1450
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,625
Oh, yeah, that's right. Watts.

1451
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:36,123
That's the real shit. That's
the down low, man. That's the real...

1452
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:38,039
We can maybe come in
and talk some business propositions?

1453
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,575
Yeah that's right.
Watch the feet. Watch the feet.

1454
01:13:39,576 --> 01:13:41,464
Watch the feet. And then,
watch the... bam!... right in the face.

1455
01:13:41,465 --> 01:13:42,453
- Mr. Shasta?
- Yo.

1456
01:13:42,454 --> 01:13:44,310
I just wanna check out your facilities
and see if they qualify.

1457
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:46,933
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry.
My hospitality was all down.

1458
01:13:46,934 --> 01:13:49,364
I was meditating.
I was thinking about Buddha, ganja.

1459
01:13:49,365 --> 01:13:51,173
I was thinking about Yoda.

1460
01:13:51,762 --> 01:13:53,106
Welcome to the Shasta domain.

1461
01:13:53,107 --> 01:13:54,799
That's right. Shasta domain's
always ready for a fight.

1462
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,206
Ready for somebody
to come in here and fight it.

1463
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:57,937
Bam!... right in the face.

1464
01:13:57,938 --> 01:13:59,693
You found the number-one
rolling crib in the house, man.

1465
01:13:59,694 --> 01:14:00,973
This shit is rolling, rolling.

1466
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:02,509
I got my fine piano here.

1467
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:05,130
I got real magical fingers.
You can't hear right now...

1468
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:06,762
Mr. Shasta, we don't actually
have that much time.

1469
01:14:06,763 --> 01:14:08,969
We just need to make sure
you're a high roller.

1470
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:10,443
I am a high roller!

1471
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:13,866
I roll like I'm tall.
And I got TVs.

1472
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:15,910
I can watch
The Brady Bunch, Jetsons,

1473
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:18,021
I can watch all five
big screens at once.

1474
01:14:18,022 --> 01:14:19,557
I got to take this.

1475
01:14:19,558 --> 01:14:20,900
You know,
I be getting calls all the time.

1476
01:14:20,901 --> 01:14:23,459
Oh. Yeah, please,
take your time.

1477
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,967
- Yo, who this?
- Oh, my God!

1478
01:14:26,655 --> 01:14:28,833
No, I had to erase it
because people be calling.

1479
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:31,710
Ich hab" nicht gesagt, Mami,
ich brauch" dein...

1480
01:14:31,711 --> 01:14:34,303
Look, Mom, I'll call you later.
I got people from the television here.

1481
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:35,612
It's really important.

1482
01:14:35,613 --> 01:14:37,467
Ja, ich ruf' dich an spter.

1483
01:14:37,468 --> 01:14:38,908
All right. All right, girl.

1484
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,027
Peace.

1485
01:14:40,028 --> 01:14:42,106
But, as you can see,
we are in the front room here.

1486
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,866
This is where magic be happening...
over here, over here.

1487
01:14:43,867 --> 01:14:45,719
It be happening all around.

1488
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,606
And we are stars.
Everybody's a star.

1489
01:14:47,607 --> 01:14:48,855
Come here.
Check it out, Cameraman.

1490
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:51,253
This right here...
that look beautiful, don't it?

1491
01:14:51,254 --> 01:14:52,406
That is the eye.

1492
01:14:52,407 --> 01:14:57,202
Now, that's made from the skins
of an endangered species of stingray.

1493
01:14:57,203 --> 01:15:00,530
Actually, that's the fake eye
to mislead the predator.

1494
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:02,160
You calling my cover "fake", man?

1495
01:15:02,161 --> 01:15:04,782
I paid, like, beaucoup for that, man.
That's the real deal, right there.

1496
01:15:04,783 --> 01:15:06,220
- That's the real deal.
- The eye is fake.

1497
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:07,853
Don't be coming into my house
and telling me my shit is fake.

1498
01:15:07,854 --> 01:15:10,636
I let everybody in here, and now
you be saying my shit is fake?

1499
01:15:10,637 --> 01:15:12,712
No, Mr. Shasta,
I think he's just admiring that.

1500
01:15:12,713 --> 01:15:14,856
The eye is fake
to mislead the predator.

1501
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:16,296
Okay, I hear
what you're saying, man.

1502
01:15:16,297 --> 01:15:18,214
I was just playin'.
I was just playin'.

1503
01:15:18,215 --> 01:15:19,397
Fantastic.

1504
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:21,574
It's... yeah.
It's, it's, it's... I love it.

1505
01:15:21,575 --> 01:15:22,502
This my baby.

1506
01:15:22,503 --> 01:15:24,389
Shasta, is there any way we could
sit down and have a little chat?

1507
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:28,096
Because we have, I think, an offer
that you might be interested in.

1508
01:15:28,097 --> 01:15:29,185
Oh, yeah, man.

1509
01:15:29,186 --> 01:15:30,657
We could be sitting, like...

1510
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:32,895
you know, let me slip into something
a little more comfortable,

1511
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:35,070
and then, uh, you know,

1512
01:15:35,071 --> 01:15:38,397
we could, uh,
we could talk about shit.

1513
01:15:38,398 --> 01:15:40,220
Please have a seat.
Please, Producer, have a seat.

1514
01:15:40,221 --> 01:15:42,265
Cameraman, come on over.
Don't be shy.

1515
01:15:42,266 --> 01:15:45,913
So tell me... what do you do?

1516
01:15:45,914 --> 01:15:47,255
Well, I'm an artist.

1517
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:49,848
I mean, Shasta's an artist
and producer,

1518
01:15:49,849 --> 01:15:52,951
a rapper, a hip-hopper,
I'm a fighter.

1519
01:15:52,952 --> 01:15:55,574
I know heads in, like,
N.Y.C., L.A., Denver...

1520
01:15:55,575 --> 01:15:57,396
So, how do you make your...?

1521
01:15:57,397 --> 01:15:58,451
I have been blessed,

1522
01:15:58,452 --> 01:15:59,827
I've mean,
bless-ed, blesses, blessings...

1523
01:15:59,828 --> 01:16:01,328
Trust fund?

1524
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:03,856
That's right.
I'm a "Trust-afari". Shast-i.

1525
01:16:03,857 --> 01:16:06,129
So, we may have
some party favors...

1526
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,526
to offer you for your next soiree.

1527
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:11,148
Right, right.
Like firecrackers, like...

1528
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:15,147
My producer here has some tree
that you might be interested in.

1529
01:16:15,148 --> 01:16:16,809
I got... you want to trapeze?

1530
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,696
I got trees outside
that can swing into the pool.

1531
01:16:18,697 --> 01:16:20,521
- We did that at one party.
- Some marijuana.

1532
01:16:20,522 --> 01:16:21,640
Oh, yeah, right!
I was just playin'.

1533
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:23,656
Yeah, that's right! Marijuana!
Shit! Of course!

1534
01:16:23,657 --> 01:16:26,214
I mean, you can't have no party
without no trees!

1535
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:29,474
All right. My partner and I
happened to come across...

1536
01:16:29,475 --> 01:16:33,756
- a pound of medical-grade chronic.
- Oh, my God.

1537
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:37,375
Oh, my God... bless Allah.
Be praised, Rastafari!

1538
01:16:37,376 --> 01:16:38,881
Thank you very much!

1539
01:16:38,882 --> 01:16:40,406
This ain't legal, is it?
Man, we can't be like...

1540
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:42,173
Oh, yeah.
We're talking medical grade.

1541
01:16:42,174 --> 01:16:44,189
Oh, the legal illegal!
The new medical grade!

1542
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:47,067
The new... that shit,
they chemically enhance it.

1543
01:16:47,068 --> 01:16:48,763
- That's really strong.
- Oh, it's strong.

1544
01:16:48,764 --> 01:16:51,833
And I think we can give him a deal,
because, you know?

1545
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:56,773
All right, we're willing to let it go for
156 dollars and 25 cents an ounce.

1546
01:16:58,423 --> 01:17:00,435
- 32 ounces in a pound.
- That's right.

1547
01:17:00,436 --> 01:17:04,338
- 156 times 32 equals 5 G's.
- Right.

1548
01:17:04,339 --> 01:17:06,608
I feel like I'm being...

1549
01:17:06,609 --> 01:17:09,137
BOTH:
Robbed.

1550
01:17:09,138 --> 01:17:10,096
Excuse me one second...

1551
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:12,270
- Are you sure you want...?
- Talk amongst yourselves.

1552
01:17:12,271 --> 01:17:13,550
That's a pretty amazing deal.

1553
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:15,245
- He seems cool.
- We can get way more.

1554
01:17:15,246 --> 01:17:18,475
He's got a very nice house,
and we are in a situation.

1555
01:17:18,476 --> 01:17:21,575
5 G's, one pound...
Let me see... one, five...

1556
01:17:21,576 --> 01:17:24,008
It's gonna be... carry the...

1557
01:17:24,009 --> 01:17:25,256
Um...

1558
01:17:25,257 --> 01:17:26,886
Can you tell me
the numbers again?

1559
01:17:26,887 --> 01:17:29,861
Obviously, we need cash.

1560
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:32,100
- There it is.
- Oh, my God!

1561
01:17:32,101 --> 01:17:33,795
- There you go.
- Oh, my God! That...

1562
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:34,850
Oh, my God!

1563
01:17:34,851 --> 01:17:37,012
Oh...

1564
01:17:38,337 --> 01:17:41,635
Oh, man, that's the sticky-icky!
That's the Bin Laden armpit!

1565
01:17:41,636 --> 01:17:43,647
That's like cave hopping...

1566
01:17:43,648 --> 01:17:47,518
Plus this to seal the deal.
To match your bike.

1567
01:17:47,519 --> 01:17:49,544
Aw, you shouldn't have, man.

1568
01:17:51,262 --> 01:17:52,314
We gotta go.

1569
01:17:52,315 --> 01:17:54,105
You guys are, like,
my nice best friends.

1570
01:17:54,106 --> 01:17:55,864
Come here, you!
Come here!

1571
01:17:55,865 --> 01:17:59,077
Holy shit! Run!
Run before he changes his mind!

1572
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:07,075
I think we're gonna be early, guys!

1573
01:18:07,476 --> 01:18:10,004
Like, 20 minutes early.

1574
01:18:11,731 --> 01:18:13,025
What you eating, Taco?

1575
01:18:13,426 --> 01:18:14,608
What you eating?

1576
01:18:14,609 --> 01:18:16,303
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1577
01:18:16,304 --> 01:18:18,158
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1578
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,971
He just ate the laxatives.

1579
01:18:20,972 --> 01:18:23,018
- What?!
- The Mexican laxatives.

1580
01:18:23,019 --> 01:18:25,706
Oh, my God!
He's gonna have an ass-plosion!

1581
01:18:25,707 --> 01:18:28,778
Poor Taco!
Oh, no, Taco!

1582
01:18:28,779 --> 01:18:30,600
- You better pull over.
- I can't.

1583
01:18:30,601 --> 01:18:32,872
I'm on the fucking freeway.
How am I going to pull over?

1584
01:18:32,873 --> 01:18:35,527
Yeah, that's gonna smell bad.
You're not going to like that at all.

1585
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,946
- What the fuck?
- What? What is that?

1586
01:18:49,887 --> 01:18:52,381
- What?
- Is that a cop?

1587
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:54,908
- Is that for me?
- Shit! Fuck!

1588
01:18:54,909 --> 01:18:56,090
Oh, my God,
we're so fucked!

1589
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:57,433
Was I speeding?

1590
01:18:57,434 --> 01:18:59,258
- Bella, just switch with me.
- No!

1591
01:18:59,259 --> 01:19:01,209
- No, no, no. Be reasonable.
- What? No! Leo!

1592
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:02,840
- Better me than you.
- No! Are you crazy?

1593
01:19:02,841 --> 01:19:03,927
I'm not switching with you!

1594
01:19:03,928 --> 01:19:06,197
You don't wanna fucking go
to prison for a stolen car, Bella!

1595
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:07,829
- I'm not moving!
- You don't want a fucking record!

1596
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,577
I'm a first-time offender.
I'll be fine! Leo!

1597
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:12,594
Stop it! Are you fucking crazy?
Stop it!

1598
01:19:12,595 --> 01:19:13,713
- Leo!
- Are you crazy?!

1599
01:19:13,714 --> 01:19:15,242
We'll just explain to them
what happened... Leo!

1600
01:19:15,243 --> 01:19:17,136
- Just switch with me!
- No Leo! Stop it!

1601
01:19:17,137 --> 01:19:19,438
Get the fuck off of me!

1602
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:21,230
What the fuck are you doing?
This is insane!

1603
01:19:21,231 --> 01:19:24,204
You're gonna go to fucking prison
after everything we've done today?

1604
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:25,293
- Stop!
- Leo, Leo! I got an idea.

1605
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:27,116
Just tell them you're me.
Tell them you're me!

1606
01:19:27,117 --> 01:19:29,577
I've done that. That's why
you don't have a driver's license.

1607
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:30,635
- Stop.
- Just relax.

1608
01:19:30,636 --> 01:19:31,960
No!

1609
01:19:52,127 --> 01:19:53,919
- Do you know why I stopped you?
- No, Officer.

1610
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,912
A couple of reasons...

1611
01:19:54,913 --> 01:19:57,437
your left taillight's out, and you
almost hit two cars back there.

1612
01:19:57,438 --> 01:19:58,685
- I'm sorry, I...
- You been drinking tonight?

1613
01:19:58,686 --> 01:20:01,497
No, it's our dog.
He's been jumping up and down.

1614
01:20:01,498 --> 01:20:03,513
Taco, platz!
Platz!

1615
01:20:03,514 --> 01:20:05,241
Your license and registration.

1616
01:20:05,242 --> 01:20:07,193
I don't have
a license and registration.

1617
01:20:07,194 --> 01:20:10,133
I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.

1618
01:20:10,134 --> 01:20:11,877
Okay.

1619
01:20:20,915 --> 01:20:23,259
Milo, turn it off.

1620
01:20:29,965 --> 01:20:33,867
All right? It's up to you,
but I have 10 minutes to get there.

1621
01:20:33,868 --> 01:20:36,440
We'll walk there.

1622
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,892
My brother and his wife,
they have a dog...

1623
01:20:41,893 --> 01:20:44,836
Hey, shut that camera off now!

1624
01:20:44,837 --> 01:20:46,468
What's going on
with the police dog?

1625
01:20:46,469 --> 01:20:48,418
How did you come up
with a police dog?

1626
01:20:48,419 --> 01:20:50,243
We're trying to raise money
to get into rehab.

1627
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:51,744
We're trying to sell him.

1628
01:20:51,745 --> 01:20:54,399
No one would buy him.

1629
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,430
Actually, he's trained in Germany.

1630
01:21:05,692 --> 01:21:10,882
- Bye, Taco! Bye, Taco!
- Bye, Taco!

1631
01:21:12,598 --> 01:21:14,518
Oh, my God!

1632
01:21:16,085 --> 01:21:19,091
Come on!
We gotta hurry!

1633
01:21:19,092 --> 01:21:21,764
That was insane!

1634
01:21:22,195 --> 01:21:24,179
See?
It's dangerous living with an addict.

1635
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,565
- Now you"re shooting.
- I'm just a casual user, see?

1636
01:21:27,566 --> 01:21:30,703
- I can stop whenever I want.
- Yeah, right.

1637
01:21:30,704 --> 01:21:32,429
Bella, we got 10 minutes.
Come on!

1638
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:34,294
How far is it?

1639
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:43,858
All right, let me get a shot
of the brothers' triumphant arrival.

1640
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:46,086
Do you know
how annoying that is?

1641
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:52,885
We made it!

1642
01:21:52,934 --> 01:21:55,340
Should we come in with you?

1643
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:56,928
- I got it.
- You sure?

1644
01:21:56,929 --> 01:22:00,177
- Yeah.
- You got the money?

1645
01:22:02,305 --> 01:22:04,974
See you in six months.

1646
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:07,962
Each day better than the next, right?

1647
01:22:07,963 --> 01:22:12,556
Exactly. Every day gets worse,
like I always say.

1648
01:22:12,731 --> 01:22:15,268
Bye!

1649
01:22:16,759 --> 01:22:17,779
Bye!

1650
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,701
Hey, hey! What's the matter?

1651
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:20,950
Handshake ain't good enough
for you?

1652
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,989
Tell Carmen I love her.

1653
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:28,928
Bye.

1654
01:22:30,832 --> 01:22:32,697
Thanks.

1655
01:22:44,522 --> 01:22:46,663
Now what we gonna do?

1656
01:22:46,664 --> 01:22:49,447
- We'll figure it out.
- We don't have a car.

1657
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:52,006
- We'll make it back.
- Should we take a bus?

1658
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:55,221
Do they have buses in L.A.?

1659
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,362
Come on!

1660
01:23:17,851 --> 01:23:19,321
Let's see how he's adjusting.

1661
01:23:19,322 --> 01:23:22,003
It's been an hour.

1662
01:23:22,903 --> 01:23:25,091
We just dropped off my brother.

1663
01:23:25,492 --> 01:23:27,304
About an hour ago.

1664
01:23:27,605 --> 01:23:29,747
Leonardo Strombo.
Yeah, Leo!

1665
01:23:29,748 --> 01:23:32,025
I just wanna see
how he's doing.

1666
01:23:35,183 --> 01:23:37,146
What do you mean?

1667
01:23:37,682 --> 01:23:39,738
Okay.

1668
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:42,719
Thank you.

1669
01:23:47,212 --> 01:23:49,499
What happened?

1670
01:23:51,848 --> 01:23:53,873
He left.
