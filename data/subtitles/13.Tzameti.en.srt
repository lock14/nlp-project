2
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,357
So, have you finished?
Yes, that's it.

3
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:53,593
Any other plans?

4
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,749
I've got an address.
I'll go see tomorrow.

5
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:57,478
Where are you going?

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,525
To work.

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,120
It's not too early?

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,556
Recently, I've had to be there early.

9
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,598
So, it's finished?

10
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,436
Yes, that's it.

11
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,432
That's good.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,954
- How much?
- Count!

13
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,525
Jean-François?!

14
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,075
What are you doing there?

15
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,635
Come into the house.

16
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,789
Hear me, Jean-François?

17
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,950
Where are you going, you pig?

18
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,638
Help me!

19
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,548
Who do you think you are,
you animal?

20
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,032
Wake up, asshole!

21
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,281
Wake up, you shit!

22
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:35,565
Wake up!

23
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,353
- What's wrong?
- He's just a pig.

24
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,348
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, he'll be alright soon.

25
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,078
We'll lift him up.

26
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,349
We have to make him run.

27
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,436
Come on.

28
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,445
No, that way.

29
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:55,673
If we don't bring him round,
he's had it.

30
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,045
I think I passed out.

31
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,232
Come on, let's walk a bit.

32
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,565
- Who are you?
- Me?

33
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,594
He's working on the house.
You hired him.

34
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,912
There.

35
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,073
How old are you?

36
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:57,565
22.

37
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,879
That's really something.

38
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:04,159
Some people are 25 or 30...

39
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,717
but to be 22...

40
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,839
that's amazing.

41
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:13,398
Absolutely amazing.

42
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,557
I need to know what to expect.

43
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,469
I'll have lots of money soon.

44
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,639
Who'd give money to such an idiot?

45
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,473
I've already been paid.

46
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:05,435
Remember?

47
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,469
I never understood that.

48
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,469
- You never understood?
- Never.

49
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:13,075
And you never will.

50
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,435
Don't worry your head about it.

51
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,435
Did he give you the advance?

52
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,756
He promised me it in 3 days.

53
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,471
I can help you this weekend
if you want.

54
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,205
That'd be great.

55
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,708
The roof beams need changing.

56
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,871
I'm off. I'm working tonight.

57
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,952
Leaving already?

58
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:45,150
Yeah.

59
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,285
Do you want a coffee?

60
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,436
- Want a coffee?
- No, thanks.

61
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,936
What's it about? Dope?

62
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:20,072
Nothing like that.

63
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,279
That workman up there...

64
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,155
needs his advance, but after that,

65
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,953
I don't know how I'll pay him.

66
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:38,365
Don't you need someone?

67
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,725
No, and it's not my decision.

68
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,992
If it's to make someone pay up,
that's my thing.

69
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:49,076
It's not. I can't tell you any more.

70
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:49,111
I'm not sure I'll make it.

71
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,278
Put in a word for me.

72
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,073
Want to take my place?
I'm not sure they'll need me.

73
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:56,833
I'm stone-broke. I'm on the street.

74
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,994
If it works, I'll help you out.

75
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,594
How long will it take?

76
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:08,472
A day.

77
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,057
You'll earn that much in a day?

78
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:14,434
I doubt I'll get through it.

79
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,953
- It worked last time.
- That was last time.

80
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,273
When do you go?

81
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,519
I don't know. Last month,
they said they'd summon me,

82
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,430
but I haven't heard.

83
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,194
What did he want?

84
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,630
Money.

85
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,357
His business isn't going too well.

86
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:51,195
I don't think there's anything left.

87
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,233
Pity. He paid for your lawyer
when you were in jail.

88
00:09:58,268 --> 00:09:59,960
I haven't forgotten.

89
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,471
- Know what your sister said?
- Don't start.

90
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,832
You belong in prison, nowhere else.

91
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,555
My sister always speaks the truth.

92
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,590
Always...

93
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,912
- How's it going?
- OK.

94
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,070
How long now?

95
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:58,205
10 days.

96
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,437
And the other side?

97
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:02,678
It'll all be finished in 10 days.

98
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,548
Good.

99
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,045
Hello. I think he's had it.

100
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,915
A striped envelope.
No, I couldn't get it back.

101
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,073
I'll send you the photos.

102
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,717
Shit!

103
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,150
Hey, mister!

104
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,389
Where are you?

105
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,792
- What is it?
- Can you help me?

106
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,392
Quick!

107
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,470
What's wrong?

108
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,713
We must break the door down.
He's passed out.

109
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,679
There's an ax on the terrace.

110
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,277
Jean-François!

111
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,279
What're you doing?

112
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,314
What're you doing?

113
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,160
He's dead.

114
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,597
- Aren't you tired?
- A bit.

115
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,635
How's things, Dad?

116
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,550
Fine.

117
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,237
- Hello, madam.
- Hello. Come in.

118
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,832
Go on.

119
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:26,565
Thank you for yesterday.

120
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,549
That's OK. I'm sorry for you.

121
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:32,965
Don't be.

122
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,673
With the quantities he'd been taking,
it was inevitable.

123
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,356
I hope you'll continue the work.

124
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,996
No.

125
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,073
His sister will inherit the house,
so it's not my problem now.

126
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:47,152
Oh?

127
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,188
Look, I'm really sorry.

128
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,639
Who's going to pay me now?

129
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,151
I doubt his sister will ever come.

130
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,918
She'll get an agency
to sell the house.

131
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,592
I never encouraged him
to take that shit.

132
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,039
He doesn't need it anymore.

133
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,281
When are you leaving?

134
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,281
After the funeral.

135
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,710
He was waiting on a job.
Do you know about it?

136
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,519
Maybe the letter will come
before you leave.

137
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,675
It came yesterday.

138
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,990
You've got it?

139
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,125
Can I see it?

140
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,833
There's nothing to see.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.

141
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,117
What'll you do with it?

142
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,270
Get the ticket refunded.

143
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,638
I'll buy it off you.

144
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,350
OK, you can have it.

145
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,475
If it works, I won't forget you.

146
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,915
A train ticket
and a paid hotel bill.

147
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,912
Where was the ticket for?

148
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:26,947
Paris.

149
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,953
The name of the hotel?

150
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,516
That I do remember: Windsor.

151
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,318
What did Pierre Bléreau
intend to do with it?

152
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,798
To replace Jean-François.

153
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:37,205
What does he know?

154
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,472
He just knew there was
a lot of money at stake.

155
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,150
When did they discuss it?

156
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,805
Yesterday morning.

157
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,832
Did anyone go in
other than the police and doctors?

158
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,712
No... Yes, the workman.

159
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,834
I asked him to smash the door

160
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:56,873
to the bathroom.

161
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,596
When did Mr. Godon intend to leave?

162
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,717
Today.

163
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,440
Thank you very much.

164
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,685
Where were you during their talk?

165
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,917
- In the corridor.
- You heard their words?

166
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,758
Of course.

167
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:12,559
Sorry, my brother over there has got it.
He'll show it to you.

168
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:12,205
Come with me, sir.

169
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,676
If you want the ticket,
go see my brother over there.

170
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,432
But you have to be present.

171
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:20,473
Want me to throw you out, asshole?

172
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,079
You're crazy!

173
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,070
What is it, Ludo?

174
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,758
He wants the ticket,
but won't move his fat ass.

175
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,754
Come on, I'll show you his ticket.

176
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,433
- Hello?
- Mr. Godon?

177
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,645
Yeah.

178
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,240
Got a pen and paper?

179
00:24:48,275 --> 00:24:48,275
Just a second.

180
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,158
By noon tomorrow,
go to Gare du Nord. Locker 103.

181
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,756
You'll find a train ticket
with instructions.

182
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,191
The code is 402 #4.

183
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,839
Get out one stop
before the station on the ticket.

184
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,916
Don't forget: one stop before.

185
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,963
Jesus...

186
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,875
Good day, sir. Your ticket, please.

187
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,235
Thank you. Pleasant journey.

188
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,150
His stop's Valen?

189
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,754
- What time?
- 5:08.

190
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,799
I'll see to it.

191
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,753
I need 2 unmarked cars,
Valen? Station, 5:08.

192
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,205
Hello.

193
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,277
- Hello.
- Where to?

194
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:03,834
- Know where that is?
- Yes.

195
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,359
- Is it far?
- It's a fair way.

196
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,509
The number's 375 MHJ 45.

197
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,878
Get out.

198
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,352
Go over there.

199
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,439
- Undress.
- Why?

200
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,192
Gotta search you.

201
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,919
And the rest.

202
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,233
What the hell are you doing?

203
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,633
Get dressed.

204
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,278
I stopped there.

205
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,513
As I did a U-turn,
he went to the sign.

206
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,838
Didn't it seem strange
that he stopped here?

207
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,550
People can stop where they like.

208
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,076
You didn't notice anything else?

209
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:05,190
Nothing in particular.

210
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,799
Go sit down.

211
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,116
- You're here?
- Yeah, guess so.

212
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,478
- Found a player?
- Yeah.

213
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:53,836
- Don't like him?
- I do.

214
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,992
Each to his own!

215
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,834
Who's that?

216
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:14,629
I can explain.

217
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,801
Shut up!

218
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,119
Call José!

219
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,830
Go get José!

220
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,590
Hello, Alain.

221
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,075
This the boy who's playing?

222
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,480
Yes, it's him.

223
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,436
Good...

224
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,598
Brave...

225
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,419
There's only 13 of us. Not many.

226
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:59,038
In Istanbul,
there were 42 of us.

227
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,914
The opening bet was 500,000.

228
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:04,045
How much is it here?

229
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,936
If it's under 100,000,
there's no point.

230
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:11,525
At least, otherwise it's not worth it.

231
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,997
Have you been around the place?
It's not very big.

232
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,230
Well, I'll wait downstairs.

233
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,517
Who's he?

234
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,598
What do you mean?

235
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,511
The guy from the crossroads.

236
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,708
- He had the card.
- I wasn't expecting him.

237
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,080
Jean-François is dead.

238
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,792
What're you talking about?

239
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:56,834
He took an overdose.

240
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,711
Let me see your papers.

241
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,633
Did he tell you about this?

242
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,196
I knew he was waiting
for a letter.

243
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,845
He hoped to earn a lot.

244
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,156
I found it
and followed the instructions.

245
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:32,595
Do you know what it's about?

246
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,595
No idea.

247
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,312
Maybe the cops sent him.

248
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,110
Who would agree to do that?

249
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,358
Maybe they didn't tell him.

250
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,317
That'd mean the cops are watching us
and will show up.

251
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,355
So, it's now or never to get out.

252
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,270
If the cops show up and we've gone,

253
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:12,949
they'll think I ratted.

254
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:15,593
I'd rather be arrested.

255
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,199
- Is your man here?
- Yes, no problem.

256
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,349
- We're about to start.
- Coming.

257
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,272
If I don't suit you, I can leave.

258
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,045
You can't leave now.

259
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,196
What if it doesn't suit me?

260
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,229
You gotta play now.

261
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,794
- How much are you betting?
- Dunno.

262
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,657
What do you think?

263
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:17,514
Dunno. Don't ask me.

264
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,149
I'm gonna bet the minimum.

265
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,792
My cylinder doesn't work.

266
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,112
What's going on?

267
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,153
- His gun won't work.
- So, change it!

268
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,358
Supervisors, hand out
one bullet to each player.

269
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:01,994
I should get my share now.

270
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,269
You've gotta see it through.

271
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,959
Man is only born once
and only dies once.

272
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,358
Get ready!

273
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,357
Nothing else happens.

274
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,199
- Be philosophical.
- Round 1's starting.

275
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,349
You're a descendant of Schopenhauer.

276
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,508
Mr. Schlondorff, go the other side,

277
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,365
please.

278
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,470
OK, I'm going.

279
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,471
Be philosophical about it.

280
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,117
Get ready!

281
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,519
Round 1 is about to start.

282
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,508
Excuse me.

283
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,110
Blow up a head for me.

284
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,793
The audience must step back.

285
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:51,674
Step back... back...

286
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,510
This'll bring you luck.

287
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:56,713
More... Thank you.

288
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,397
Load your cylinder!

289
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,959
Number 13, got a problem?

290
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,312
Problem with your gun?

291
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,319
Got a problem?

292
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,831
Nobody get in the ring.

293
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,114
- Get out.
- He can't load it.

294
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,275
Give it here.

295
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,394
This is to open the cylinder, OK?

296
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,630
OK, that's enough.

297
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,710
Raise your gun!

298
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,318
Spin the cylinder!

299
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,878
More!

300
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,917
Take aim!

301
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,758
Cock the hammer.

302
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,845
Number 13,

303
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,395
don't turn your head.

304
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,594
When the bulb lights up,

305
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,558
you shoot!

306
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,716
Everyone stare at the bulb.

307
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,630
Wait! Wait!

308
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,596
Number 13 didn't shoot.

309
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:28,165
Shoot!

310
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,189
Why won't you shoot? Shoot!

311
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:33,879
Mr. Alain, what's got into your player?

312
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,673
If he doesn't, we'll shoot him,
and you'll get fined!

313
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,511
I'll count to three.

314
00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:43,045
One...

315
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,436
Go on, shoot!

316
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,643
Two...

317
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,754
Hey, get out of the ring.

318
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,114
You finished your scene, you shit?

319
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,876
Shit to you, too!

320
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,039
Don't start that crap again.

321
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:41,874
Why didn't you shoot?

322
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,845
Why didn't you?

323
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,710
You gotta shoot, dammit!

324
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,440
Want some morphine?

325
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:52,365
No, I don't.

326
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,076
Morphine's fuckin' cool.
They all take it.

327
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:59,330
Who's not had his dose?

328
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:01,550
- Us.
- Come on, then.

329
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,112
I bet 500,000 on Number 13.

330
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,165
Get lost!

331
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:35,871
I want to bet on you.

332
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,154
Beat it, you little shit!

333
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,752
I've lost my player.
Can I bet on yours?

334
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:01,752
I want 50% of your cut.

335
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,600
Alright.

336
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,759
Just for this round.

337
00:45:07,794 --> 00:45:07,794
OK.

338
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,072
Put your name down on Number 13.

339
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,789
350 on Number 13.

340
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,755
350 on Number 10.

341
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,615
C'mon, get him up here.

342
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,150
It's OK, he's here.

343
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,911
What are you playing at?
You can't get out of here.

344
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,117
Put your bullets in the cylinder.

345
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:49,765
2 bullets!

346
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,552
Raise your gun!

347
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,269
Spin your cylinder!

348
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,232
More!

349
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,078
Stop!

350
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,205
Take aim!

351
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,437
Cock the hammer!

352
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:20,436
Don't look me in the eyes.

353
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,231
When the bulb lights up,

354
00:47:27,266 --> 00:47:27,266
you shoot!

355
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,037
Shit!

356
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,965
He didn't have time.

357
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,149
The bullet's in the barrel.

358
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,155
Hans!

359
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,517
Come here, Hans.

360
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,517
Go get him.

361
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,955
350 on Number 7.

362
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,033
I lost my player.

363
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,839
I know, it's written here.
Shit happens.

364
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,989
No one will let me bet
on another player.

365
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,436
Why not?

366
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,477
I don't know, I'm bad luck.

367
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,797
What can I do about it?

368
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:07,633
Don't you run this organization?

369
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,393
What's that change?

370
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,509
I'm here to gamble
the 2 million in this case.

371
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,045
It's in your interest.

372
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,756
We don't force anyone into the shit.

373
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,436
You've already killed two.

374
00:49:40,471 --> 00:49:41,632
That's great.

375
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,696
You can make big money.

376
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,513
When you start, you finish.

377
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,915
What's it to you?

378
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,436
1.5 million on Number 6.

379
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:11,677
Very well.

380
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,317
I did well to bet on your player.

381
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,278
You staying with us?

382
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:19,313
No.

383
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,352
With the 2 brothers.

384
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,120
I've gambled the lot.

385
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,470
If I lose,
you'll have to go home alone.

386
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,239
Cut the crap.

387
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,597
Weird... They're brothers.

388
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,437
God, I hate that number!

389
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,032
Forget it, it's nothing.

390
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,439
I said, forget it.

391
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,075
If he kills a third, you get a bonus.

392
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,078
That'd be wonderful.

393
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,758
Gentlemen!

394
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,414
Third round.

395
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,028
Let's go.

396
00:52:00,063 --> 00:52:00,063
Now!

397
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,601
Get up!

398
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,910
Number 8...

399
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,630
Number 3...

400
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,336
Number 11...

401
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,152
Number 11!

402
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,320
Mr. Schlondorff,

403
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,914
your player must get in the ring.

404
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,115
Just a second.

405
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,830
What is it?

406
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,674
Oh, nothing. A touch of diarrhea.

407
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:36,874
Get him up there.

408
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,389
I'm gonna get you.

409
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,885
What a fucker!

410
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,435
What's he playing at?

411
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,033
He better calm down.

412
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,828
Supervisors, hand out the bullets now.

413
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,596
3 bullets per player.

414
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,074
Hand out 3 bullets!

415
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,677
Excuse me, Mr. Schmitt.
Can our player have a chair?

416
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,351
He's in pain.
Mr. André's asking, too.

417
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,113
You shouldn't be here.
Go back to the other side.

418
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,439
Give him a chair.

419
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:27,074
The gamblers must step back.

420
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,037
Sir!

421
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,790
Step back!

422
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,319
What's wrong with him?

423
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,110
He's drugged up.

424
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,394
Take him up to his room.

425
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:51,429
Quick!

426
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,833
Put the bullets in the cylinder!

427
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,459
Raise your gun!

428
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,718
Spin the cylinder!

429
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,599
More!

430
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,456
More!

431
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:21,633
Stop!

432
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,393
Take aim!

433
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,355
Cock the hammer!

434
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,550
When the bulb lights up,

435
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:35,758
you shoot!

436
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,758
Oh, fuckin' hell!

437
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,685
Come.

438
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,597
Come here.

439
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,275
Gentlemen!

440
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,597
We've reached
the final leg of our game.

441
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:08,525
The duel.

442
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:12,075
3 bullets in the cylinder.

443
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:12,110
Here are 4 balls.

444
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,031
2 are white.

445
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:17,757
2 are colored.

446
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,913
The 2 colored balls
indicate the duelists.

447
00:58:23,948 --> 00:58:26,470
I call on Numbers 1, 3, 6, and 13.

448
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,115
So everyone can see,

449
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,710
I want you to open them
above your heads.

450
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,479
I want no ambiguity.

451
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:41,398
Gentlemen, good luck.

452
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,045
Numbers 6 and 13.

453
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,595
Gentlemen, place your bets.

454
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,789
I want to bet on your player.

455
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,108
- He's got no experience.
- Precisely.

456
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,436
I'm always luckier
when I go against logic.

457
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:27,599
80%.

458
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,036
- That's a lot.
- You won't get less.

459
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,193
Well, I'll bet then.

460
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,645
I should get my share now.

461
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,715
The bets are low.
We won't make much.

462
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,078
I know you.

463
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:55,117
I fell...

464
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:58,473
because of you.

465
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,601
What do you mean?

466
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,192
I've been thinking.

467
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,759
I want my share.

468
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,152
Go over to the wall.

469
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,709
You go over to your wall.

470
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,430
It's a piece of shit.

471
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,077
They're all the same.

472
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:01,473
Gentlemen, please.

473
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,388
One...

474
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,357
Two...

475
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,675
Three...

476
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,558
Very good.

477
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,479
OK with me.

478
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,757
Gentlemen, please be silent.

479
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,552
Silence, please.

480
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:42,587
Thank you.

481
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,349
I want the players to step forward.

482
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:25,831
Raise your gun!

483
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,396
Spin the cylinder!

484
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,068
Stop!

485
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,558
Take aim!

486
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,476
When the bulb lights up,

487
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,550
you shoot!

488
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,912
Get ready!

489
01:03:35,365 --> 01:03:35,365
The duel continues

490
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,597
with 4 bullets in the cylinder.

491
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:40,519
One more bullet in the cylinder.

492
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,148
Supervisors, hand each player
an extra bullet.

493
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,005
One, two,

494
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,359
three, four bullets.

495
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:28,392
Players, step forward.

496
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,639
Raise your gun!

497
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,999
Spin the cylinder!

498
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,475
Stop!

499
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,310
Take aim!

500
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,757
When the bulb lights up,

501
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:06,830
you shoot!

502
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,359
It's over, gentlemen.

503
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:37,719
Finished. All over, gentlemen.

504
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,118
Calm down. It's over, finished.

505
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,952
The winner is Number 13.

506
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,313
Bravo! Number 13, bravo!

507
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,758
Here's the winner.

508
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:31,109
Congratulations.

509
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,276
Go get your money.

510
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,028
Thank you.

511
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,836
- Congratulations.
- 850.

512
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,525
Thanks to you,

513
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:16,599
I've won back all I'd lost.

514
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,325
It was far from certain.

515
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,794
I'm not very lucky at the moment.

516
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,108
9...

517
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,516
10...

518
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,757
Give them a wad.

519
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:05,165
You're lucky, you know.

520
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,557
Your opponent already won 3 duels.

521
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,045
What about me?

522
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,595
Not giving me anything?

523
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,956
Got your money?

524
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,637
Yeah.

525
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,232
Are you pleased?

526
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,590
Want a lift?

527
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,117
Where to?

528
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,473
We'll leave you
at the nearest station.

529
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,674
I'll get dressed and wait outside.

530
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,112
- Want a drink?
- No.

531
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,109
Where are you going?

532
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,033
- I'll go with him.
- Go up and get the coats.

533
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:17,917
- See Number 13?
- He took his stuff.

534
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,596
- Where is he?
- Open the trunk.

535
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,956
It was lucky he came.

536
01:10:43,991 --> 01:10:46,753
What'd we have done?

537
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,113
Off you go.

538
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,471
10 euros, please.

539
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,123
Your receipt.

540
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:35,595
Goodbye.

541
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,320
Oh, it's you?

542
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:55,194
Yes, listen.

543
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,191
I sent you a parcel with money in it.

544
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,675
What money?

545
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:03,310
A lot of money.

546
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,596
Who gave it to you? What is all this?

547
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:10,949
I'll tell you when I get back.

548
01:13:10,984 --> 01:13:12,629
When will you be back?

549
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:13,673
No doubt tomorrow.

550
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,111
Why send it?
You could've brought it.

551
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,240
Something might happen before then.

552
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:26,234
It was safer that way.

553
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,430
When you get

554
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,076
the receipt, go get the parcel.

555
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:32,713
What's going on? Where are you?

556
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,792
Don't worry for now.
Everything's fine.

557
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,470
"For now"? Where are you?

558
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,991
I'm calling just in case.
See you soon.

559
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,834
In case of what?

560
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,115
Everything's fine.

561
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:51,630
Take care.

562
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:19,834
Pleasant journey. Bye.

563
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,837
- He's over there.
- OK, thanks.

564
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,195
Police! Please stand up.

565
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:53,194
Raise your arms, please.

566
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,480
Please come with us.

567
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,437
Thanks.

568
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,830
What did you do with the money?

569
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,165
What money?

570
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,590
You're lucky
you came back from there.

571
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,278
I don't know what you mean.

572
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,122
Sit down.

573
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,549
Sit!

574
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,630
I know where you were.

575
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,956
You stole the envelope from Godon's

576
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,552
and you went in his place.

577
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,352
I'm not wrong, am I?

578
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,509
No, that's what happened.

579
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,115
Tell me in detail
what happened there.

580
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,428
Where?

581
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,470
You know very well.
You went for the money.

582
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,316
I didn't make it. I didn't get there.

583
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:53,750
Don't bullshit me.

584
01:17:53,785 --> 01:17:55,150
You'll regret it.

585
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:56,870
I'm telling you the truth.

586
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,151
What car were they in
at the crossroads?

587
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:05,805
A black Peugeot.

588
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,990
What did you say to the driver?

589
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,805
Nothing.

590
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,192
He refused to talk.

591
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,474
He said his job was to get me there.

592
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,958
Where did he drop you?

593
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:18,597
Somewhere in the forest.

594
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,589
What could you see there?

595
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,676
Other guys waiting for us.

596
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,285
Near a car.

597
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:27,672
What did you talk about?

598
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,357
I told them Mr. Godon was dead.

599
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,668
I offered to take his place,
but they refused.

600
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,845
It didn't work out.

601
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,348
They must've decided
I wasn't suitable.

602
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,272
You're lying.

603
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,435
You must've convinced them.

604
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,633
Otherwise you'd be dead now.

605
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:56,953
Who says
they were going to let me live?

606
01:18:56,988 --> 01:18:58,077
I ran away.

607
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,673
Once we'd talked, I saw one guy

608
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,511
pull out his gun, and I ran for it.

609
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,313
Didn't they shoot?

610
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,833
Yes, they ran after me,
shooting at me, but I got away.

611
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:18,592
I ran so much, I broke my heels.

612
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,753
Look.

613
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:36,634
Could you identify them?

614
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,640
Yes, of course.

615
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:45,525
Could you take me
to the place in the forest?

616
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,951
I panicked and ran in the dark.
How could I remember?

617
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,590
You could,
in a car from the crossroads.

618
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,436
No.

619
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:56,645
As I got in,

620
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,752
the driver put a blindfold on me.

621
01:19:59,787 --> 01:19:59,787
You're lying.

622
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:02,798
When I look at you,

623
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,269
I smell the stink of blood.

624
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,556
I've told you everything.

625
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:41,511
You've told me nothing.

626
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:47,271
I had a plan. If you'd got out
at the right station,

627
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,758
I'd have arrested the henchmen

628
01:20:49,793 --> 01:20:49,989
and made them talk.

629
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,993
Now I've lost my only lead.

630
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,637
What's this all about?

631
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,961
It's a dirty business.

632
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,036
A dirty business of murder.

633
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,310
There was another car in the forest.

634
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:17,031
I remember the number.

635
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,736
Tell me.

636
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:28,153
GR 1313.

637
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,276
What make of car was it?

638
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,205
A blue Peugeot 607.

639
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:40,916
But that's all I know, believe me.

640
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,319
10 euros, please.

641
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,600
Thanks. Bye.
