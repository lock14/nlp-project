00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,559
<i>Alaska: vast wilderness of the North.</i>

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,079
<i>Land of great natural
beauty and diversity.</i>

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,879
<i>This is rugged country.</i>

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,279
<i>Land of black gold.</i>

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,079
<i>Alaska's north slope
has been producing oil</i>

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,799
<i>out of Prudhoe Bay since 1968,</i>

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,359
<i>delivering to refineries and ports
800 miles to the south</i>

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,319
<i>through the great
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.</i>

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,239
<i>But another northern region</i>

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,039
<i>known as the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge</i>

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,919
<i>has remained untapped.</i>

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,439
<i>Only once have prospectors
gained access</i>

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,479
<i>to this barren landscape.</i>

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,239
<i>In 1986, the KIK Corporation,</i>

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,799
<i>a partnership between native
and business interests,</i>

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,039
<i>commissioned the drilling of a test well.</i>

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,439
<i>The results of that drilling</i>

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,359
<i>have been a carefully
guarded secret ever since,</i>

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,439
<i>with only a solitary white box</i>

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,359
<i>marking the footprint
where the rig once stood.</i>

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,159
<i>Now, at last, after
an historic vote in Congress,</i>

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,919
<i>the KIK well will reveal her secrets,</i>

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,959
<i>and North Industries will be there.</i>

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,799
<i>Working in consort
with environmental experts,</i>

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,559
<i>North Industries will send
advance teams to map the area</i>

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,500
<i>and determine strategic drilling locations.</i>

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,639
<i>Ice roads will be constructed
to transport the rigs,</i>

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,279
<i>and drill sites and pipelines</i>

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,959
<i>will be operational within the decade.</i>

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,999
<i>One step closer
to energy independence.</i>

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,639
<i>We have got the vision, the experience,</i>

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,879
<i>the know-how.</i>

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,679
<i>North Industries.</i>

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,740
<i>Trust. Risk. Results.</i>

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,479
Jesus Christ, Ed.

37
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,719
I could use a longer runway.

38
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,639
Sounds like a personal problem, Gary.

39
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,079
It's on my list. That's a for-sure.

40
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,479
Go get my gear, will ya?

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,039
<i>- Oy, Ed.
- Motor!</i>

42
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,839
Rise and shine!

43
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,959
Where's Abby?

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,119
Where's my welcoming party?

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,959
<i>A good 30, 40 miles per hour.</i>

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,919
<i>Occasional flurries after midnight...</i>

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,639
Abby, God damn it, you're beautiful.

48
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,239
You took my room!

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,159
I want it back.

50
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,439
With you in it.

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,639
- Hiya, Ed.

52
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,959
- How you doin'?
- A hundred percent, Abs.

53
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,919
A hundred and fifty.

54
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,559
Hey.

55
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,879
Yeah. I put on a few.

56
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,639
- Well, you know...
- Is that Ed Pollack I hear?

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,959
Aw, baby! You sight for sore eyes!

58
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,239
How's that new exercise regime going?

59
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,599
<i>Okay. Put me down.
Dinner's almost ready.</i>

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,839
Lee. Pipe down, will ya?
You're far too excitable.

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,879
Yeah, Lee. Pipe down.

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,719
It is good to see this
team taking shape here.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,479
You know? The big boys,
they send their love.

64
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,719
Everybody's gearing up.

65
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,799
Where's the kid?

66
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,959
<i>Oh, Maxwell is out on the flats.</i>

67
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,519
Should be back by now.

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,359
I'm supposed to keep my eye on him,
you know? For the old man.

69
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,559
Gary's taking off.
He wanted to beat the snow.

70
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,559
Aw. I wanted him to stay for a drink!

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
Hey, Dawn, find some glasses, will ya?

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,959
Boy, he's sure in a hurry.

73
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,359
What ya got in the bag, boss?

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,559
Mind your damn manners, Motor.

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,559
Hey, Dawn, where's those glasses?

76
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,919
<i>Oh. This is Elliot Taylor.</i>

77
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,060
He is doing the impact evaluations.

78
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,839
I thought the new green
flag was named Hoffman.

79
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,660
That's my boss.

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,799
They sent two guys?

81
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,639
This what you were looking for, Motor?

82
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,799
Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,119
A little fish.

84
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
Cigarettes.

85
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,759
This one looks sexy.

86
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,759
<i>Harvest Nights.</i>

87
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,719
Stogies.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,679
Good one, Ed.

89
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,159
And...

90
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,359
more fish.

91
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,159
Is this gonna be Maxwell?

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,159
Hi.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,540
James Hoffman, meet Ed Pollack.

94
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,260
How ya doing?

95
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm doing fine.

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,839
Before your time.

97
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,879
Listen up. This is what I want to say.

98
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,279
Now, I know you've...
all been in a holding pattern,

99
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,199
and I want to apologize for that.

100
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,359
These ice roads have been
a bitch to get in,

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,020
and Hoffman can give you
the reason for that.

102
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,799
It's not cold enough.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,879
Hell, it feels cold as a witch's boob
out here to me.

104
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,159
Well, you need a sustained sub-zero
to build those roads.

105
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,599
Well, then find me some sub-zero!

106
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,159
I mean, we're in fucking Alaska!

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,159
It's the Arctic Circle!
It's the dead of winter here!

108
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,559
Well, that's exactly the problem.

109
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,839
The temperature's
been all over the place.

110
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,959
So, ... how is it
that you come to work for North?

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,799
I mean... you're not the type.

112
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,919
We don't work for North.

113
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,879
We work for the American people

114
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,799
to make sure that North
keeps its end of the bargain up here,

115
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,959
being on this land.

116
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,999
What the American people
want is energy independence.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,319
That's what
the American people want.

118
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,199
Hell, the amount of oil
that they're gonna get out of here

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,999
they could save by inflating their tires
and caulking their windows.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,239
Hoffman knows all that crap.

121
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,399
He's an oil geek.

122
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,079
He was at the Kuwaiti oil field fires.

123
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,319
Right? ... and Valdez?

124
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,220
<i>He was there
when the Titanic went down.</i>

125
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,199
This was a chance for me

126
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,999
to come to the last piece of pristine...
untouched wilderness on the planet

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,679
before we fuck it up.

128
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,100
So if North... is willing to pay me
to be here, then so be it.

129
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,999
Maxwell, you're on my team.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,039
¶ Here we go, Pipe Dogs, here we go ¶

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,439
¶ Here we go, Pipe Dogs ¶

132
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,959
- Hey, Dawn! Dawn!
- Yeah?

133
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,119
<i>- You're gonna be my center over here!
- Okay. You got it.</i>

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,479
Maxwell. I think we're
gonna call you "House" out here.

135
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,879
What do you think of that, Maxwell?

136
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,039
That's okay, Mr. Pollack.

137
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,239
- You can call me Ed. All right, House?
- Yes, sir.

138
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,919
When do I say "hike"?

139
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,279
You're gonna go to the right.
You're gonna go to the left.

140
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,759
- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!

141
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,879
Hut, hut, hut!

142
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,639
I don't even know the fucking rules.

143
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,959
Run, House, run!

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,919
Go!

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,239
Get him!

146
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,199
- Yeah!

147
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,820
- Gimme some love, bro.
- Yeah!

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,279
- I got it!
- You can't kick to yourself!

149
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,159
Go! Run!

150
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,639
It's all right.
He's down. He's down.

151
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,479
Right here! We're here! All right, we're here.

152
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,399
Flag on the play.

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,879
Get off me!

154
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,439
Hike!

155
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,399
1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi,

156
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,239
3 Mississippi, 4 Mississippi!

157
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,199
I got it!

158
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,479
- Yes!
- Whoo!

159
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,519
Yeah, baby!

160
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,999
What happened?

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,239
Hike!

162
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,199
<i>Out! Go long! Go long!</i>

163
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,839
You're a tough
little woman, I'll give you that.

164
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,580
Back! Back!

165
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,159
That's pass interference, Elliot!

166
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,119
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

167
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,239
I didn't see you. The ball...

168
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,479
Are you okay, Elliot?

169
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,759
<i>Okay, okay. Step aside,
House, let's have a look.</i>

170
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,319
<i>- Aw, jeez.
- Oh, fuck.</i>

171
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,159
He just took a little elbow.
Just got a little blood.

172
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,319
Hey, Dawn?

173
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,119
Let's get him inside
and get him fixed up, okay?

174
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,119
All right, come on. Bring him up slow.

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,119
<i>Okay.</i>

176
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,799
All right, you're going to be all right.

177
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,020
<i>¶¶</i>

178
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,239

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,140
<i>¶ My baby don't care for clothes ¶</i>

180
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,879
<i>¶ My baby Just cares for me ¶</i>

181
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,460
<i>¶ My baby don't care for ¶</i>

182
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,180

<i>¶¶</i>

191
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,159
You okay?

192
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,239
Yep.

193
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,559
Ready for the big meeting today?

194
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,759
Sure.

195
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,559
What's it about?

196
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,780
Well, he flew in to talk to you, basically.

197
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,959
Sounds ominous.

198
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,359
You think everything is ominous.

199
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,879
Wasn't this supposed to be
a one-night stand a month ago?

200
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,959
I think you should
hear him out, you know?

201
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,279
He's got a lot riding on this.

202
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,439
This is not a fair conversation.

203
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,599
Let's go, Ab.

204
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,959
I- I'll be right there.

205
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,399
Come on, he must know.

206
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,639
I'm not so sure.

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,060
He sees what he wants to see.

208
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,239
Hey, man.

209
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,959
I got your stuff.

210
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,119
Thanks.

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,559
It's weird. You almost don't need
your gear, right?

212
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,039
Yeah, right.

213
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,199
We just, uh, take it, just in case.

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,359
Hey, have you ever been
out to the KIK well?

215
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,039
Yeah.

216
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,119
I mean, yeah. It's that box.

217
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,719
I mean, I go by it on my way to site 7.

218
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,639
Right.

219
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,519
What's under there?

220
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,039
A pipe?

221
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,679
With a valve on it?

222
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,199
Why?

223
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,679
What's under that?

224
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,359
What?

225
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,999
Nothing.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,599
Wait, you saw the... the...
you know, the North video?

227
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,559
They talked about it.

228
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,479
Yeah. I watched it. Yeah.

229
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,079
Yeah. Whatever.

230
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,839
I mean, I'm gone for what, five weeks?

231
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,359
And she hooks up with this guy?

232
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,199
I mean, Jesus.

233
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,479
I thought Abby was smarter than that.

234
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,559
Hoffman's cool. He's a sharp dude.

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,759
I saw some of his articles.

236
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,439
It's some deep shit, man.

237
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,039
It put me right to sleep.

238
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,599
It's just... It's just
bad judgment on Abby's part,

239
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,759
you know what I'm saying?

240
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,239
She's too young for you, man.

241
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,999
Hey, take it easy, will you?

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,759
<i>Hoffman heading out.</i>

243
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,860
How long have they been
at it, Abby and him?

244
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,119
I don't know, man. Ask her.

245
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,559
Hand me that Allen wrench,
will you, boss?

246
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,999
How long?

247
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,900
Three to four weeks.

248
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,439
It won't last. I'll tell you that much.

249
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,460
I guess he just got lucky.

250
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,439
Here's his thing, you know,

251
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,020
if you want to check it out.

252
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,799
Yeah, this guy's seen it all, hasn't he?

253
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,020
That's him.

254
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,719
Thanks for the Allen wrench,
by the way.

255
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,199
I mean, North thinks
they can win a PR campaign,

256
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,639
hiring greenies to do
the impact statements.

257
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,879
It's a waste of money, you know?

258
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,079
The public is with us on this.

259
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,039
They can see the potential.

260
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,119
They don't need to get bogged down
with a lot of hand wringing.

261
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,559
He thinks there's something off-kilter
going on out here.

262
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,879
Is that what he's telling everybody?

263
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,279
Yeah, the permafrost is melting.

264
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,719
That's what he says.

265
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,599
Haven't you smelled it?

266
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,460
Fucking dick.

267
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,359
<i>Saturday, week 9.</i>

268
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,719

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,959

increase over same week.

278
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,780
Same quadrant average of last five years.

279
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,940
It's you again.

280
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,319
Mess up all my stuff, hmm?

281
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,020
Is that you?

282
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,799
<i>- Beggar.
- Something up here is off.</i>

283
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,620
<i>It's in the numbers, but also I can feel it.</i>

284
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,759
Maxwell, over.

285
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,159
I don't know why they don't
just lay tarmac down

286
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,439
at the start of these projects

287
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,039
instead of fucking around
with these ice roads.

288
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,799
That would be a violation of the terms
that got North Industries onto this land.

289
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,039
Yeah, yeah.

290
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,719
Well, my only concern
is getting my equipment in.

291
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,620
My only recommendation is that we wait
for a sustained temperature drop.

292
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,679
I'll tell you what.

293
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,079
Change of plans.

294
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,799
We're gonna bring the rigs in on rollagons.

295
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,399
Rollagons?

296
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,599
Has that been approved?

297
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,359
Everybody's behind it back at the office.

298
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,639
Nobody wants to miss the season.

299
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,239
That's going to be very expensive.

300
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,999
Rollagons would cause
serious damage to the tundra

301
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,879
with the temperatures this high.

302
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,119
Well, luckily I don't have to have this
discussion with you.

303
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,719
I need Hoffman. Where the fuck is he?

304
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,159
I don't know.

305
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,319
He was coming right back.

306
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,919
Well, I need for him to sign off on this.

307
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,199
This is what I came back here for.

308
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,719
We should be careful
how we handle that.

309
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,679
Hey, Motor, what's up?
We're a little busy here.

310
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,559
Maxwell's not back yet. I'm worried.

311
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,119
The Ski-Doo is acting up.

312
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,980
Maybe it copped out on him.

313
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,719
Hey, Abby, what's going on?

314
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,119
Where the hell have you been?

315
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,839
Maxwell's not back.
He's not answering the walkie.

316
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,119
He's not answering?

317
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,159
Do you need any help?

318
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,639
I wouldn't worry about Maxwell.

319
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,799
The kid could walk from here
to Vegas on his hands.

320
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,639
- Maxwell, do you read?
- Where have you been?

321
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,839
So you guys didn't get
any kind of a sudden wind down here?

322
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,039
Anything strange like that happen?

323
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,319
Yeah.

324
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,559
Yeah, we had a meeting,
and you never showed up.

325
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,719
That was strange.

326
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,079
Lee, let's go!

327
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,020
Look, I am sorry about being late.

328
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,879
We need to talk, you and me.

329
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,340
We don't need the others.

330
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,079
Hoffman, I don't know you,

331
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,719
and I'm not going to try to handle this
with some diplomatic mumbo jumbo.

332
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,119
I'm just going to tell you what I need,
and I'm going to expect you to deliver.

333
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,399
Go ahead.

334
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,039
I got environmental impact statements
I need you to sign,

335
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,559
saying we can bring
the rigs in a rollagons.

336
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,519
What?

337
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,439
The ice roads aren't working.

338
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,100
It's what we gotta do.

339
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,620
<i>Okay.</i>

340
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,420
What, is that a yes?

341
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,559
I'll look at your proposal.

342
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,319
It's not a proposal.

343
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,100
It's an okay I need you to sign.

344
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,420
Ed, I'm not going to sign something
just because you need me to.

345
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,359
I think we should make
sure Maxwell's back safe

346
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,340
before we get into this.

347
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,079
Foster, yeah, he's not biting.

348
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,319
Yeah. Yeah?

349
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,500
We should go through with that.

350
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,980
There you go.

351
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,719
You should call her.

352
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,239
I just tried. Nothing.

353
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,359
These things ever work?

354
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,959
Maxwell was bound to get lost eventually.

355
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,820
Is that right?

356
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,119
He seems overwhelmed.

357
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,439
This whole damn operation
needs an attitude adjustment.

358
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,639
It's unacceptable.

359
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,039
Go ahead.

360
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,159
Hello?

361
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,479
Pollack here.

362
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,479
Hoffman?

363
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,999
No, he's here.

364
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,119
Yeah. Hang on.

365
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,380
Hoffman!

366
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,900
Hoffman!

367
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,919
Foster's on the line.

368
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,479
Make it quick, will you?

369
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,940
Hello.

370
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,060
I'm good.

371
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,180
Really?

372
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,020
Just like that?

373
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,519
Tuesday. Fine.

374
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,060
I'll be out of here.

375
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,559
Visibility is turning to shit out there!

376
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,279
We checked his route,
he abandoned his Ski-Doo.

377
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,239
What?

378
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,199
It started up fine.
He is out there on foot.

379
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,279
Where's his Ski-Doo?

380
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,479
Didn't want to leave him stranded.

381
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,559
We gotta call a plane for a real search.

382
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,319
No way! No way!

383
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,199
That'd mean we'd have
to wait until morning.

384
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,759
No, we do this ourselves,
and we do it now!

385
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,839
I'm not losing a man!

386
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,119
I'm going out there now.

387
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,980
I'll go with you.

388
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,719
Jesus.

389
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,740
House!

390
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,359
You had everybody's
panties in a knot, man.

391
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,799
Hey, are you all right?

392
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,799
I'm... I'm okay.

393
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,599
I- I don't think this works.

394
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,359
According to this thing,
you walked 300 miles.

395
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,639
We looked for you.

396
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,959
So you got lost. I mean, what happened?

397
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,759
- Hot tea.
- Welcome back, man.

398
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,679
You gotta stay in contact, all right?

399
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,159
Let somebody know where you're going.

400
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,679
Standard procedure.

401
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,759
And never, ever turn your walkie off.

402
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,719
It wasn't working.

403
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,380
It was just screeching at me.

404
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,700
Sorry. I'm gonna go lie down.

405
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,959
That boy has got big eye.

406
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,919
He hasn't been out here long enough.

407
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,319
He'll be fine.

408
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,039
They're calling it a promotion.

409
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,519
Can they even do this?

410
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,319
<i>Of course they can.</i>

411
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,439
You don't like the message,
you get a new messenger.

412
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,639
I'm gonna quit.

413
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,879
You should stay on.

414
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,300
Take some notes on this new guy.

415
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,940
You're giving up pretty easy.

416
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,940
Look, man, I've been reporting
on this stuff a long time.

417
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,839
People just don't want to deal with it.

418
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,700
It's tiring.

419
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,199
<i>¶ I won't tell you
I don't need you tonight ¶</i>

420
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,279
<i>¶ Won't pretend I ain't burning inside ¶</i>

421
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,479
<i>¶ Your skin glowing soft
in the silver moonlight ¶</i>

422
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,260
That was intense.

423
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,279
What's up with you?

424
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,599
I'm leaving.

425
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,300
They're pulling me off the project.

426
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,020
I didn't know if you knew.

427
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,380
Why weren't you at that meeting today?

428
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,999
I'm gonna recommend that
they shut the project down.

429
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,999
I don't think they can get those rigs out.

430
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,060
Jim, it's too late for that.

431
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,919
How's Maxwell?

432
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,479
Try to get some food in him, will you?

433
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,020
Work some of your magic.

434
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,679
I figure, take him out here first.

435
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,879
We tell him we're gonna get
the rigs in here in nine days.

436
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,639
They're gonna stay until March,
I don't know, 19th,

437
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,719
and then we're gonna get them over
to the Northeastern site.

438
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,599
I mean, you know, we just tell him that,
you know, like it's a done deal.

439
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,799
Yeah, well, you tell him that, Ed.

440
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,839
I mean, Jesus.

441
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,679
I'll handle him.

442
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,999
Is this...

443
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,399
Is this Maxwell flagging these sits?

444
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,799
What is he, sniffing glue out here or what?

445
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,199
I don't know what this is.

446
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,279
Jesus.

447
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,439
We're gonna have to check
all these sites now.

448
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,719
Yeah, okay.

449
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,639
Lee, this is going to be you.

450
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,999
All of them.

451
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,999
Will do.

452
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,999
Excuse me.

453
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,079
You're gonna have your
work cut out for you.

454
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,799
Yeah, I think this is going
to take more than one of us.

455
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,519
Better you than me.

456
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,559
<i>Oh, nature calls.</i>

457
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,079
So, Hoffman, what do you figure,

458
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,039
we bring the rigs in here on rollagon?

459
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,079
Is that gonna work?

460
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,839
The tundra is barely frozen.

461
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,159
It won't support the weight
of those vehicles.

462
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,719
Well, now...

463
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,199
how do you propose we get
the equipment in here, then?

464
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,679
Maybe you won't get it in.

465
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,999
Maybe you're gonna have
to reconsider your plans.

466
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,199
That's the wrong answer.

467
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,799
<i>It's the CO2 feeding back up.</i>

468
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,879
As the ground warms,

469
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,919
permafrost, all this organic material

470
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,519
that's been frozen for thousands
of years is thawing,

471
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,239
which accelerates the warming.

472
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,479
It's exponential,
what we're talking about here.

473
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,679
What is this, some
global warming bullshit?

474
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,439
I mean, don't you think
it's a little late in the day

475
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,879
to be having that particular debate?

476
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,319
It's not a debate
about global warming, Ed.

477
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,359
It's just what we're
dealing with out here now.

478
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,559
Yeah, well, fortunately,

479
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,119
I don't have to listen to you anymore.

480
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,879
You asked.

481
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,980
Just making conversation.

482
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,079
<i>"Empathy with the land.</i>

483
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,780

484
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,839
<i>"The land is changed.</i>

485
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,959

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,159
<i>"but nature's indifferent to us.</i>

488
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,719
<i>"We fight for our survival, not nature's.</i>

489
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,959
<i>"There's a fierceness in the wind
I've never felt before.</i>

490
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,079
<i>"Something is being unleashed
from the softening permafrost.</i>

491
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,759
<i>"Why do we despise the world

492
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,580
<i>Why so alienated?"</i>

493
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,479
<i>"Why wouldn't the wilderness fight us,</i>

494
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,119
<i>"like any other organism

<i>"The world we grew up in

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,220

505

Something happening, Dawn.

506
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,359
That's brilliant! Do that again!

507
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,340
<i>Very Twilight Zone.</i>

508
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,359
Would either of you like
to comment on the fact

509
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,039
that it's fucking raining out,
February in the Arctic?

510
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,919
I'm freaking, man.

511
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,679
<i>- Uginaca.
- What's that, Dawn?</i>

512
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,719
Well, it means like a familiar friend
acting strangely.

513
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,439
It's how we speak of weather.

514
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,580
It gets worse every year.

515
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,879
What's happening?

516
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,119
What do you say about it, Hoffman?

517
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,839
The climate's changing exponentially.

518
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,599
It's collapsing. It's altering.

519
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,639
I'm talking about
right now, today, what happened?

520
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,519
That's what I'm talking about, today.

521
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,879
It was rain.

522
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,199
For Christ's sake, the temperature's
already dropping back.

523
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,559
It was a fluke.

524
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,279
Well?

525
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,759
He's staring out the window.

526
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,919
He say anything?

527
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,079
No.

528
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,119
Did you tell him I said it was dinnertime?

529
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,599
Yep.

530
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,799
Send him home, Ed.

531
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,879
That's what I say.

532
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,039
He's not going anywhere.

533
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,879
Well, if he doesn't eat, he can't work.

534
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,159
I realize... Jesus Christ.

535
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,559
Can I get a little fucking positivity here?

536
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,079
And wipe your face.

537
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,500
You're pathetic.

538
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,719
You do realize that there are restrictions

539
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,839
on alcohol consumptions
at this station, don't you?

540
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,599
And what about you?
Would you pass a piss test?

541
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,319
And where do you think you're going?

542
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,999
Let him try, Ed.

543
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,999
Yeah. House likes him.

544
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,479
May I come in?

545
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,100
Yeah.

546
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,060
I brought you this.

547
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,679
What happened out there yesterday?

548
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,300
When we lost you?

549
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,340
I don't know.

550
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,380
<i>Out by the KIK well...</i>

551
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,719
it's haunted.

552
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,359
All right. Just... take a deep breath

553
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,639
down on that one there, Maxwell.

554
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,319
We shouldn't be here.

555
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,879
We're grave robbers.

556
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,799
It's coming up from the ground.

557
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,020
Ghosts.

558
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,039
I mean, what is oil anyway but fossils?

559
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,519
Plants and animals from...

560
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,919
whatever... millions of years ago.

561
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,359
Listen. Maxwell.

562
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,820
That's...

563
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,959
Maybe...

564
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,780
this has gotten to be
a little too much for you.

565
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,620
It's pretty intense out here.

566
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,340
You can go home.

567
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,300
Have you thought of that?

568
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,799
I can't.

569
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,860
My... my parents would kill me.

570
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,220
Your parents aren't going to kill you.

571
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,119
It was my father's
idea for me to be here.

572
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:55,039
Satisfy my love of the outdoors
by drilling for oil with Uncle Ed.

573
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,119
Well, maybe your father would listen
if you explained to him.

574
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,140
Have you thought about that?

575
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,839
Man...

576
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,039
eat some food.

577
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,839
I'm telling you!
There's something out there

578
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,079
<i>- that's trying to drive us out of here!
- Okay...</i>

579
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,919
It's like a force, fighting back!

580
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,919
- Maxwell, you gotta...
- No! People need to know! Isn't that your job?

581
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,439
To let people know what the fuck
they're supposed to do here?

582
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,479
What the hell is going on?

583
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,079
- Tell them! Tell them what you know!
- Hey!

584
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,439
- Calm down! You, get the fuck out of here!
- You know what's happening!

585
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,159
You know! You've said things!

586
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,380
- You know what's going on...
- Calm down!

587
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,399
You gonna calm the fuck down?

588
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,039
Yes, sir.

589
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,300
Just need...

590
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,300
I need to rest.

591
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,980
Sorry.

592
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,580
He's resting.

593
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,380
Dawn's got him on something.

594
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,100
What the hell was that in there?

595
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,799
I got Maxwell out here, you know.

596
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,540
Told his old man how good
it would be for him.

597
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,519
Known that kid since the day he was born.

598
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,199
I know, Ed.

599
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,540
It's Hoffman!

600
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,359
I have no idea how you ended up in
the sack with that guy.

601
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,759
But I gotta tell ya,

602
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,159
I consider it a security breach.

603
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,639
We had nothing to hide, Ed.

604
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,199
Everything is by the book.

605
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,860
He works for North.

606
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,660
Every report he does goes through us.

607
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,479
I think you made a big mistake
transferring him out of here.

608
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,279
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let him
or anybody else fuck this up for me!

609
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,879
I had his confidence.
I had my eye on him.

610
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,879
You let me down, Abby.

611
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,380
I did not, Ed.

612
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,260
I mean personally.

613
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,500
I guess that's over with.

614
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,060
Yeah, it is.

615
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,780
Good night.

616
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,980
Sure hope you don't like
the new guy as much.

617
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,679
- Who you got?
- Hmm.

618
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,060
Marshowitz.

619
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,620
Abby.

620
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,780
I'm tired.

621
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,679
Maxwell...

622
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,340
saw something out there.
Something's going on here.

623
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,799
Don't think you need
to get involved with Maxwell.

624
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,799
We'll take care of him.

625
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,540
That sounds ominous.

626
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,220
You know, you're getting awfully vocal
about what we're doing up here.

627
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,020
It's not gonna work with Pollack.

628
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,719
You should've just signed
those impact reports.

629
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,959
Pollack has no idea
what's going on out here.

630
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,719
<i>- Oh, and you do?
- No, I don't, either.</i>

631
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,359
That's why I'd like to
take a giant step backwards

632
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,020
and get some people up here
who can figure out what is going on.

633
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,159
You know your deal with North prohibits you

634
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,519
from saying anything
about this to anyone.

635
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,879
What's that supposed to mean?

636
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,180
Just need to make that clear.

637
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,519
Abby!

638
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,260
You don't feel that something is off here?

639
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,759
Listen, Abby.

640
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,199
You can make a real difference here.

641
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,039
Draw a line in the sand.

642
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,159
If they shut this project down,

643
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,559
the others could be called into question.

644
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,799
You could be part of
a change for the better.

645
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,799
Take your case to North, if you need to.

646
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,519
At this station, we're fighting
to get those rigs in.

647
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,679
Whatever it takes, and on schedule.

648
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,340
What's been going on with us
these last three weeks?

649
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,260
I gotta sleep.

650
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,639
This is on the fritz, too.

651
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,439
We gotta do something to get these systems
up and running, Motor.

652
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,959
I fix stuff around here.

653
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,679
Two hours later, it's broke again.

654
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,519
Maybe we need to get somebody
down here who could figure this shit out.

655
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,860
Hey. Look at this.

656
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,540
How's he doing?

657
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,900
What is this now?

658
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,839
There's my camera, man!

659
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,900
We should thaw the fucker out
and see if he shot anything with it.

660
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,500
God damn it!

661
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,199
Where was he?

662
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,260
Up by the KIK well.

663
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,479
You should have send him home, Ed.

664
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,719
You should have sent him the fuck home!

665
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,319
We'd better call and report this.

666
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,700
- Radio's dead.
- We wait until morning!

667
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,639
Foster's flying in here with what's-his-name.

668
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,399
We get Maxwell flown out by Gary.

669
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,860
That's final!

670
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,079
<i>Ever since I got here,</i>

671
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,839
<i>I could tell that there
was something wrong.</i>

672
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,439
<i>Not the Job. Not the cold.
Not being isolated.</i>

673
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,439
<i>But feeling... how?</i>

674
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,839
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

675
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,940
<i>I've seen something out in the snow.</i>

676
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,780
<i>I want to show you.</i>

677
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,940
Jesus. What's he doing?

678
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,100
<i>Do you see it?</i>

679
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,300
<i>Did you see it?</i>

680
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,620
<i>Did you see it?</i>

681
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,980
<i>Up ahead. They're out now.</i>

682
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,799
<i>Listen! Listen! That!</i>

683
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,319
<i>It...</i>

684
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,820
<i>Dad, do you hear that?</i>

685
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,199
<i>Listen!</i>

686
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,239
<i>Do you see it, Dad?</i>

687
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,399
<i>They're out there!</i>

688
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,020
<i>They're right out there!</i>

689
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,820
<i>You see... you see that?</i>

690
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,519
<i>Do you see it? Do you see it?</i>

691
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,119
All right. That's it.

692
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,279
Ed...

693
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,540
Ed!

694
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,319
You can't burn that!
What the hell do you think you're doing?

695
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,359
Ed! Ed!

696
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,679
I'm in charge here!

697
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,159
And that tape does nobody any good!

698
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,879
Back off, Pollack!

699
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,119
You want his parents to see that?
Is that what you want?

700
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,239
Their kid whacked out?

701
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,959
Wandering around in his birthday suit?

702
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,999
You're out of your mind.
That was evidence, Pollack.

703
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,159
There'll be an investigation!

704
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,319
He wandered off,
and he died of exposure!

705
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,039
Did you hear what he was saying?

706
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,039
You're on the next plane outta here, Elliot!

707
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,439
You and Hoffman! Until then,
you stay out of my way!

708
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,679
We should all be on that plane, Ed.

709
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,319
And what did you put
in his head last night?

710
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,799
Elliott, your nose. Come on. Get inside.

711
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,039
Get inside.

712
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,860
Go, go, go, go, go. Come on.

713
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,559
What do you say, Lee?

714
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,959
<i>Is it the coming of the shinu?</i>

715
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,399
<i>Shinu?</i>

716
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,599
<i>A shinu is a dark spirit.</i>

717
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,159
Sometimes called...

718
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,580
<i>wendigo.</i>

719
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,580
What do you say, Lee?

720
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,119
I believe...

721
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,420
what I see with my own eyes.

722
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,839
God damn it!

723
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,620
Motor.

724
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,399
What are you doing, man?

725
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,639
I have to check the engine.

726
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,199
Just... think... I think...

727
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,879
we might have to get out of here.

728
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,279
Yeah. Yeah. I understand.

729
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,559
Listen, man. Listen.

730
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,780
<i>It's cold out here. Okay?</i>

731
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,559
You should go inside, okay?

732
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,719
- Your hands...
- My hands are fine.

733
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,140
I'm... can hardly feel 'em.

734
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,799
You know what I'm thinking?

735
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,239
I'm thinking maybe you ought
to lay off the hooch just a little bit.

736
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,740
'Cause you're not
thinking so straight.

737
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,399
Look, I'm... I'm headin' down south.

738
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,060
After this winter, I'm...

739
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,140
I've had it. I'm outta here.

740
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,039
I need to talk to you.

741
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,239
Can it wait?

742
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,839
No.

743
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,879
Maxwell's father...

744
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,380
is a friend of mine.

745
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,159
I lost his kid on my watch.

746
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,879
I know. I'm sorry.

747
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,860
It wasn't your fault.

748
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,380
Well, I'm responsible.

749
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,199
For this crew, and everything
that happens to 'em.

750
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,199
Your sorry ass included.

751
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,799
Well, then do the responsible thing

752
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,599
and let's get everybody out of here tonight.

753
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,359
Why? 'Cause you say so?

754
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,639
Because it's not safe.

755
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,359
I think there's
an atmospheric abnormality here

756
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,439
that's affecting everyone's judgment.

757
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,879
I think that's what
happened to Maxwell.

758
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,199
Now Motor is out there
not making any sense, either.

759
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,799
- Don't you start any new shit.
- Look.

760
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,639
It's some sort of low-level sour gas.

761
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,919
It's seeping up out of the ground.

762
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,279
H2S is a half a mile
under the earth's surface.

763
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,959
It doesn't just seep
out of the ground, for Christ's sake.

764
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,159
Do you even know what the fuck
you're talking about?

765
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,679
I say it does. This
permafrost is melting.

766
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,799
Somehow, this hydrogen
sulfide's making its way to the surface

767
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,839
- like a low-level blowout.
- Bullshit!

768
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,679
All right, well.
Then it's some kind of contagion.

769
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,719
<i>Or a virus. Or spores.
I don't know! All right?</i>

770
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,079
I don't know.

771
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,639
But I do know that this
ground's been frozen

772
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,479
for the last 10,000 years.

773
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,919
We have no idea
what's coming out of it.

774
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,399
Do you even realize
you're putting everybody

775
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,940
at risk with this kind of talk?

776
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,239
Have another drink, Pollack.

777
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,700
Fuck you.

778
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,479
I got a series of alarmist ideas.

779
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,039
The warming is melting the tundra.

780
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,039
But then you are worried
about a whole sour gas scenario.

781
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,239
You haven't made yourself clear!

782
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,079
Well, it's a lot of factors.

783
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,319
<i>Okay? All at once.</i>

784
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,399
None of which I fully
understand at this point.

785
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,079
But I think that we should err
on the side of caution.

786
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,060
Well, I can't make a run for it
based on a hunch.

787
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,199
I need evidence.

788
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,079
There's a corpse outside.

789
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,479
That's evidence of something.

790
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,679
Yeah. That's evidence

791
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,999
of a major malfunction
on Maxwell's part.

792
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,159
Well, you should know that Motor
is now totally freaking out.

793
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,679
He's taking apart the Snowcat.

794
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,399
What?

795
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,439
Look, we're all under
a lot of pressure out here.

796
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,340
You guys.

797
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,020
You guys, who?

798
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,319
You. And Pollack.

799
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,100
You're perfect for each other.

800
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,239
I can't email out of here.

801
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,620
You should be packing.

802
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,679
Listen, Elliott,

803
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,879
I want you to come down
to Fairbanks with me.

804
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,759
Staying here's just bullshit.

805
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,119
All right?

806
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,460
And dangerous.

807
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,460
<i>Listen. Listen...</i>

808
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,340
<i>Did you see it?</i>

809
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,559
<i>Did you see it?</i>

810
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,399
<i>They're out there.</i>

811
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,100
<i>Right out there.</i>

812
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,740
<i>Ghosts.</i>

813
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,959
<i>What is oil anyway but fossils?</i>

814
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,980
<i>Plants and animals from...
whatever. Millions of years ago?</i>

815
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,399
<i>We shouldn't be here.</i>

816
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,759
<i>We're grave robbers.</i>

817
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,479
<i>People need to know! Isn't that your Job?</i>

818
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,660
<i>I Just hope this isn't
happening everywhere else.</i>

819
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,439
Abby has decided...

820
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,759
in light of recent goings-on

821
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,239
that we should all ship out of here,

822
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,879
and get our heads checked.

823
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,839
I'm gonna second that motion
for the good of the team.

824
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,159
But make no mistake.
We're coming right back.

825
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,279
We're just gonna go to Deadhorse.

826
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,039
We're gonna get checked out there
in the infirmary.

827
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,119
I want everybody's bags packed.

828
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,319
Just the essentials.

829
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,839
Lee, I want you to go out

830
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,599
and tell Motor what's going on.

831
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,639
Foster and Marshowitz
will be here any minute.

832
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,399
Get Gary to radio for another plane.

833
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,700
It'll be fine.

834
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,639
<i>He is getting that age, right?</i>

835
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,839
Pollack is an animal.
He'll never retire.

836
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,279
He'd go crazy without this job.

837
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,839
My bottom line is he's...
he's just not delivering.

838
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,839
He's all right.

839
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,319
Hey, what about Abby?

840
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,639
What about her?

841
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,500
She's a piece of ass, right?

842
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,700
I got one of those, too.

843
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,300
Wind pick up, Gary?

844
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,879
Doesn't look like
it has a whole crew, huh, Marshowitz?

845
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,999
Ugly as sin out here.

846
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,599
It's pure white nothingness.

847
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,719
It looks like the last place on Earth.

848
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,639
God's country.

849
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,359
North country.

850
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:22,759
Down!

851
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,420
Down! Down!

852
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,740
<i>Oh, my God! Gary!</i>

853
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,180
See if you can get inside!

854
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,599
Foster!
Foster, are you with me?

855
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,759
Can I get on the other side?

856
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,119
Fuck.

857
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,079
Hang on, pal.

858
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,599
Maxwell? How the fuck
did you get over here?

859
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,780
Ed, what are you doing?

860
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,839
- What are you doing?
- Where's Gary?

861
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,039
Did he make it out of there?

862
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,399
Couldn't get him out!

863
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,580
Jesus Christ.

864
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,919
We gotta get Foster out of there!

865
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,759
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

866
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,039
Pull him out! Pull him out!

867
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,119
Easy, guys. Easy.

868
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,439
Lee, I need that fire out now!

869
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,999
Foster. Foster! Stay with me!

870
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,399
Give me the morphine! Come on!

871
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,820
- All right. Let him have it.

872
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,079
That's it.

873
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,079
Hang in there, brother.

874
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,199
<i>- Okay.
- Hang in there.</i>

875
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,479
You're gonna be all right. Hang on.

876
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,599
It's all right, buddy.

877
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,479
Fucking Gary...

878
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,660
Fucking Gary. Right, man.

879
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,820
We gotta stop the bleeding.

880
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,820
See the liver right here.

881
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,500
You gotta get us out of here.

882
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,860
You gotta get us out.

883
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,020
There's no heat.

884
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,220
No electricity.

885
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,399
I have to get some plastic or...

886
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,740
some tarps over these walls...

887
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,879
and move everybody back
through the kitchen...

888
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,580
into Dawn's room.

889
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,879
If they haven't heard
from us by tomorrow,

890
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,199
they'll send another plane.

891
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,319
We can hold out till then.

892
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,900
I don't think so.

893
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,159
What?

894
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,599
There's one snowmobile working.

895
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,540
I could take it to Fort Crow.

896
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,879
Fort Crow? What are you talking about?

897
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,660
It's an Inuit village
19 miles southwest of here.

898
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:00,999
Is the gas in the tank?

899
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,039
It's full.

900
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,839
No, no, we're not leaving the station.

901
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,239
If we stay here, we could
all be dead in the morning.

902
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:14,780
He's right, Ed.

903
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:24,559
It's... 25 miles
to the ice road camps.

904
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,300
It's a flat route.

905
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,399
They're working today.

906
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,039
It's 9:20. They'll be there until 5.

907
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,199
That's what we'll do.

908
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,399
We'll hook up with these guys
and we'll radio for help,

909
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,319
and we'll have somebody
here by nightfall.

910
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,959
I'll go to Fort Crow.

911
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,319
It's closer. They'll have a plane.

912
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,759
It's North's equipment.

913
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,999
We're gonna do it North's way.

914
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,359
If you want to come along,
that'd be fine.

915
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,359
We could use your help.

916
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,119
Two of us doubles our chances.

917
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,839
We better get going.

918
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,439
It's a straight shot!

919
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,740
Straight shot.

920
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,399
Keep this on channel 3.

921
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,599
Yeah.

922
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,020
It should work for a while.

923
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,940
See you tonight.

924
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,359
Abby, you're in charge.

925
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:30,940
Stay strong, everybody.

926
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,340
We'll be back with help.

927
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,780
Won't leave you guys here.

928
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,359
You see that?

929
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,180
What did I tell you?

930
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,279
Hey!

931
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,420
Anybody here?

932
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:54,119
Supposed to be here. This is...

933
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,719
This is Tuesday, isn't it?

934
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,100
All day.

935
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,119
What is going on?

936
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,839
God damn it.

937
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,220
Hey!

938
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,780
No juice at all.

939
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,780
Must have got a ride out of here.

940
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,519
Well?

941
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,679
There's a pumping station
about 25 miles west of here.

942
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,079
No, Ed. Fort Crow
is about 8 or 9 miles south of here.

943
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,799
Ed! Fort Crow is gonna save our ass!

944
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,740
Uhh!

945
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,679
Come on! Fucking piece of shit!

946
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,719
Pollack! Pollack!

947
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,319
What?

948
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,999
We lost all our oil.

949
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,260
She's not gonna start.

950
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,700
Fuck!

951
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,479
All right, Ed, listen.

952
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,479
Fort Crow is 9 miles
south of here, maybe 10.

953
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,439
We got three hours of daylight left.

954
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,220
Let's not squander it.

955
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:13,500
9 miles.

956
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,660
<i>Out there on foot.</i>

957
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,020
God damn it.

958
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,919
He's gone.

959
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,500
Let's cover him up.

960
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,180
Where's Lee?

961
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,759
Pollack! You see that ridge?

962
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,900
Fort Crow is on the other side.

963
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,940
River around here somewhere.

964
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,260
What are you doing?

965
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,500
Think he was one of those drivers?

966
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,340
From the ice road?

967
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,420
Pollack!

968
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,359
Pollack!

969
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,700
Hang on!

970
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,879
Hang on, Pollack!

971
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,399
Pollack!

972
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,740
My foot!

973
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,239
The belt!

974
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,439
Can you grab it?

975
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,439
That's it.

976
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,060
All right.
Hang on a second!

977
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,199
Pull! Pull!

978
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,820
Fuck!

979
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,220
Get it!

980
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,039
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

981
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,079
I can't do it.

982
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,460
Yes, you can. Come on, Pollack.

983
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,140
We gotta get off this ice.
It's not stable.

984
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,660
Come on. Come on.

985
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,460
Come on!

986
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,639
All right. You're doing great!

987
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,719
You're doing great.

988
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,919
Come on, we gotta get this off.

989
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,559
- Shit!
- Ah, fuck, man!

990
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,679
My boot.

991
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:29,919
- Forget about the boot.
- I gotta go get my boot.

992
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,359
No! Forget about the boot, Pollack!
The boot's gone.

993
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,639
Boot's gone.

994
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,919
We gotta get those clothes off you.

995
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:37,999
Thanks, man.

996
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,959
Fucking...

997
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:39,919
I'm fucking burning up.

998
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,839
No, you're not, you're freezing.

999
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,359
Keep moving, keep moving!

1000
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,959
You're gonna make it.

1001
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,559
Let's go. Here we go.

1002
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,060
<i>Okay.</i>

1003
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,820
Come on.

1004
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,820
Atta boy.

1005
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,359
Take it easy with that stuff.

1006
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,700
It doesn't mix well with hypothermia.

1007
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,700
We could die out here.

1008
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,639
That gonna be a boot?

1009
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,980
Yep.

1010
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,940
Anyway, I...

1011
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,239
Well, anyway...

1012
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,500
You know.

1013
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,100
You and Abby.

1014
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,100
I guess I get it.

1015
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,220
She's a...

1016
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,599
She means a lot to me.

1017
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,540
I guess we had our go at it.

1018
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,180
She's a handful.

1019
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,740
Believe in God?

1020
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,599
No.

1021
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,980
Not the way you mean.

1022
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,559
Jesus Christ, Jim.

1023
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:44,060
I would not do what you've
chosen to do up here.

1024
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,439
Whatever god it is that sanctions that,

1025
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,140
then no.

1026
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,500
I'm not a believer.

1027
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:02,799
What's needed out here is a pipeline

1028
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,060
and a base camp...

1029
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,479
and a couple of wells.

1030
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,500
That's what God wants.

1031
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,140
Lee!

1032
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,199
Dawn.

1033
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,159
Dawn?

1034
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,479
Dawn!

1035
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,919
Dawn?

1036
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,719
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1037
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,959
<i>Oh, my God! Motor!</i>

1038
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:48,879
Motor?

1039
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,140
Motor!

1040
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,719
Motor!

1041
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,919
Dawn, what did you do?

1042
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,799
Motor!

1043
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,420
Motor!

1044
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,599
Dawn!

1045
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,919
What's wrong with you?

1046
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:06,879
Dawn!

1047
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:08,999
No!

1048
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,860
Motor.

1049
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,020
God.

1050
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,580
Dawn!

1051
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,660
Dawn!

1052
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,079
Listen up.

1053
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:52,100
This is how it's gotta go.

1054
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,079
I want your boots.

1055
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,279
What?

1056
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,140
I'm in charge here,
and that's the decision.

1057
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,420
What is it?

1058
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,719
Hoffman, what is it?

1059
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,319
I can't tell.

1060
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,220
It's wind!

1061
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,919
Enough of this shit!

1062
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,999
You got into Maxwell's head,
but you're not getting into mine.

1063
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,879
Now I'm not afraid of this place!

1064
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,620
You see it? Do you see it?

1065
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,340
Do you see it?

1066
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,479
Hoffman, you are as crazy
as a shithouse rat.

1067
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,159
Now I'm going for help.
and help is over that rock.

1068
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,959
We gotta stick together.
We can't split up.

1069
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,199
We have no idea what we're dealing with here.

1070
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,719
We gotta watch each others' back.

1071
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,460
You gotta calm down, man!

1072
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,759
Look!

1073
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,620
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

1074
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,799
I don't see anything!

1075
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:04,999
Look!

1076
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,079
The boot! Gimme the boot!

1077
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,199
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

1078
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,620
Crazy bastard, you're making me do this!

1079
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,039
Hoffman, are you there?

1080
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,679
Hoffman, are you there?

1081
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,199
<i>Abby?</i>

1082
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,119
Jim? Are you okay?

1083
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,479
<i>I'm a... I'm a...</i>

1084
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,780
I'm okay.

1085
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,879
<i>Where's Pollack?</i>

1086
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,060
Uh, he took off.

1087
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,780
I'm alone.

1088
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,559
Me, too.

1089
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,359
<i>All right. Well, Just hang on.</i>

1090
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,079
<i>I'm so close.</i>

1091
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,580
<i>I'm so close.</i>

1092
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,039
<i>We're gonna get out of this, Jim.</i>

1093
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,599
You know, daylight's coming,

1094
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,079
and they're gonna
send somebody for us,

1095
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,919
so we're gonna get out of this.

1096
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,039
<i>You're gonna get out,</i>

1097
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,559
<i>and you're gonna tell the
whole world what happened.</i>

1098
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,399
You're going to sound the alarm.

1099
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,799
You're going to tell the whole world.

1100
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,759
And people are gonna
rise up, make change.

1101
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,479
Hell, they might build you a monument.

1102
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,820
Yeah.

1103
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,580
The whole world's gonna
band together, Jim.

1104
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,879
<i>There it is, Abby! Abby!</i>

1105
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,679
<i>I can... I can see the town.</i>

1106
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,399
<i>We're... We're gonna be okay.</i>

1107
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,679
<i>Just hold on.</i>

1108
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,100
<i>Okay.</i>

1109
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,639
Jim, what's happening?

1110
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:56,959
<i>It's Pollack. I think he's fallen.</i>

1111
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,300
Is he... is he alive?

1112
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,879
<i>Abby?</i>

1113
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,439
Jim.

1114
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,079
<i>I can't tell if this is happening.</i>

1115
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,239
Jim?

1116
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,279
Jim, what's happening?

1117
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,399
Jim!

1118
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,479
Jim!

1119
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,220
Jim!

1120
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,319
Shoot it!

1121
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,399
Town's right over there!

1122
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,860
What are you waiting for?

1123
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,060
Mom, I'm home!

1124
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:14,100
No!

1125
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,599
<i>Let's take a look at the big picture.</i>

1126
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,239
<i>We have got a lot to talk about.</i>

1127
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,159
<i>Mother Nature outdoing herself right now.</i>

1128
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,039
<i>Let's take a look up north.</i>

1129
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:36,479
<i>The folks in Buffalo
are watching snow come down today.</i>

1130
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,639
<i>Today they had snow,</i>

1131
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:39,879
<i>but yesterday, a record high of 67 degrees.</i>

1132
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,999
<i>So how do you deal
with those weather swings in Buffalo?</i>

1133
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,359
<i>Mood swings as well, I bet.</i>

1134
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:45,719
<i>Down in Florida, of course,</i>

1135
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:49,799
<i>we've still got that recovery effort going on
for the flooding last week.</i>

1136
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,359
<i>We've got some video here.</i>

1137
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,039
<i>This is, I believe,
Durgin Street in Ormond Beach.</i>

1138
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,759
<i>Wow, those folks Just
really taking a pounding.</i>

1139
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,919
<i>Now we got a couple of storms
up and down the East Coast,</i>

1140
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,119
<i>some flash flooding, and of course,</i>

1141
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:04,199
<i>Cape Cod is hit with
another big winter storm</i>

1142
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,719
<i>that almost split through the bay.</i>

1143
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,999
<i>While that's going on,
we've got bright sunshine</i>

1144
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,879
<i>out in Atlanta, and Phoenix as well.</i>

1145
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,399
<i>It hit 79 in Phoenix.</i>

1146
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,919
<i>That's a record for this time of year.</i>

1147
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,919
<i>Spring dropping in a little early.</i>

1148
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,239
<i>Now, out in Seattle, this is something.</i>

1149
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,999
<i>Seattle. We're getting reports...</i>

1150
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,719
<i>this is no exaggeration...
of hail earlier this morning.</i>

1151
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,439
<i>In some places,
hail reported the size of baseballs.</i>

1152
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,519
<i>For all you Mariners fans
who've Joined us,</i>

1153
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,479
<i>that's one for the record books as well.</i>

1154
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:34,559
<i>So we've got something for you
wherever you are in the country.</i>

1155
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,639
<i>Now, here's something
that's got folks scratching their heads.</i>

1156
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,879
<i>Anchorage, Alaska, 68 degrees...</i>

1157
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,719
<i>In Fairbanks, 71.</i>

1158
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,399
<i>That's correct.
All up and down the state,</i>

1159
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,279
<i>they're dealing with record highs.</i>

1160
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,519
<i>It's caused a lot of problems
for the folks up there.</i>

1161
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,799
<i>They're used to some very bitter winters,</i>

1162
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,199
<i>and a lot of people
scratching their heads...</i>

1163
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:05,220
<i>¶ Tomorrow is gone yesterday ¶</i>

1164
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,359
<i>¶ Silly to try and run faster ¶</i>

1165
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:15,220

1166

<i>¶ And from that look
there on your face ¶</i>

01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,159
<i>¶ I can tell you've been cryin' ¶</i>

1171
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:45,380
<i>¶ Here in this cold light of day ¶</i>

<i>¶ Would a word on us two ¶</i>

1177
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,980
<i>¶ Mean something more to you and me ¶</i>

1178
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:23,679
<i>¶ If we could cut through our lies ¶</i>

1179
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:27,740
<i>¶ And try to catch it in time? ¶</i>

1180
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,020
<i>¶ There's a hole in this heart ¶</i>

1181
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:19,079
<i>¶ But it goes right on beating ¶</i>

1182
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:23,660
<i>¶ Someday I know it's gonna stop ¶</i>

1183
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,679
<i>¶ Till then, I'll go right on breathing ¶</i>

1184
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,780
<i>¶ Said I'm runnin' out of road ¶</i>

1185
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,319
<i>¶ Said I'm runnin' out of road ¶</i>

1186
