1
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,158
Motherfuckers!

2
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,229
Fuck.

3
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,240
Fuck!

4
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,670
We're almost home, buddy!

5
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,430
Whoa!

6
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,949
Whoo!

7
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,749
Hey.

8
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,557
My name's Alan and I bought a giraffe!

9
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,630
He's all mine!

10
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,038
He's super friendly!

11
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,355
Oh, wow.

12
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,918
Look at the giraffe.

13
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,071
Oh, my God. Where do you think it's going?

14
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,869
Whoo!

15
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,271
Oh, my life is great! I have a wonderful life!

16
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:53,230
I have a wonderful life!

17
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,550
Yes, sir. Absolutely, I will.
Thank you so much. No, of course.

18
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,754
No, no. And again, I'm so sorry.

19
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,391
That was the mayor, Alan.

20
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,519
It was an accident.

21
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,793
You said you'd always love me
no matter what I did.

22
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,588
I know and I do. You're my best friend.
But, Alan, why would you buy a giraffe?

23
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,353
I've always wanted one.

24
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,153
I could feed him from my tree house.

25
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,310
Besides, they remind me a lot of myself.

26
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,834
In what way?

27
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,627
They're majestic, pensive and tall.

28
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,755
- Pensive?
- Yeah.

29
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,309
- Where'd you learn that word?
- "Words With Friends."

30
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,947
- What friends, Alan?
- You can set it on random.

31
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:16,029
Alan, aside from the fact
that you shut down a freeway...

32
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,875
...you murdered a wild animal.
It's national news.

33
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,918
You don't want to know the checks
I had to write to fix this.

34
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,831
Oh, please. We're rich.

35
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,274
We are not anything, Alan.

36
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,954
I am well-off. You are my 40-year-old son--

37
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,711
Forty-two. I'm 42!

38
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,189
--42-year-old son who still lives at home.

39
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,670
You are to go back on your medication
or I'm cutting you off.

40
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,552
You're bluffing. When's dinner?

41
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,435
Your mother and I can't take this anymore!

42
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,353
- Well, you might have to.
- I can't do it!

43
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,634
I cannot do this!

44
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,713
I don't care what you say anymore

45
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,677
This is my life

46
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,398
Go ahead with your own life
Leave me alone

47
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,995
Keep it to yourself
It's my life

48
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,595
Alan! Alan!

49
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:18,956
Ave

50
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,831
Maria

51
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,350
My God, he's got the voice of an angel.

52
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,033
It's breathtaking.

53
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,430
Ave

54
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,312
Maria

55
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,992
I can't believe my daddy is dead.

56
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,958
I can think of so many people
I would rather have died first.

57
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,314
Like my mother.

58
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,108
As many of you know...

59
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,636
...my father and l were extremely close.

60
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,077
He was my life partner.

61
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,470
He would often tell me,
almost on a daily basis...

62
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,197
...that l was his favorite child.

63
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,711
I'll always remember the last words
he said to me:

64
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,272
"I'm proud of you, Alan.

65
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,959
Never change."

66
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,878
Well...

67
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,793
...I heard you loud and clear, Daddy.

68
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,350
I will never change.

69
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,158
Never, ever.

70
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,754
Oh, Mom.

71
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,991
Go ahead, chief.

72
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,796
Sid Garner was a beloved husband...

73
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,438
...father and neighbor.

74
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,995
Wow, rough day.

75
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,798
- Yeah, how's Tracy doing?
- Not great.

76
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,996
Her mother's totally on the edge,
and if all this weren't enough...

77
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,879
...apparently Alan's been off his meds
for almost six months.

78
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,188
Oh, boy.

79
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,316
Yeah, it has not been pretty.

80
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,995
- Then there's the whole fucking giraffe thing.
- I thought that was pretty funny.

81
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,912
- What?
- Come on. He killed a giraffe.

82
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,672
Who gives a fuck?

83
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,591
You know, I wasn't gonna say anything,
but Alan's been stopping by my office lately.

84
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,557
You're kidding me. What for?

85
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,191
I don't know. He just sits in the waiting room
and reads Highlights magazine.

86
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,476
Fills in the puzzles, whatever he can,
and then leaves.

87
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,158
Check it out.

88
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,548
Wow.

89
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,913
Jesus, what are you gonna do with him?

90
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,673
Actually,
I wanted to talk to you guys about that.

91
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,274
Linda really wants to stage
an intervention for him.

92
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,192
An intervention? Really?

93
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,077
I think that sounds like a great idea.

94
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,991
Yeah, the thing is...

95
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,676
...she's pretty convinced he won't agree to it
unless all of us are there.

96
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,558
I mean, you know how he is.

97
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,756
I don't know. It seems a little extreme to me.

98
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,633
Oh, God. Look at him now.

99
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,273
Okay, I'm in. When are we doing it?

100
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,077
So we talked to Tracy today...

101
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,549
...and she said that the treatment facility
that they found is really nice.

102
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,597
It's beautiful. I checked it out online.
Great reputation.

103
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,639
Who gives a fuck? It's in Arizona. We gotta
go on like a two-day drive for this shit?

104
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,788
Here we go.

105
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,553
They should just save their money
and send him to fat camp.

106
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,709
- Phil.
- What?

107
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,792
He should lose weight. He'll find a woman.
The dude's lonely.

108
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,712
If he's so lonely, why don't the two of you
spend more time with him?

109
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,110
- No, trust me, you don't want that.
- No. You definitely don't want that.

110
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,110
Come on. He's not that bad.

111
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,077
I mean, what's the worst that's happened?
The tattoo?

112
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,629
Yeah, the tattoo's the worst.

113
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,914
Right?

114
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,913
Definitely. Tattoo was the worst. Nightmare.

115
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,071
Speaking of which, you ever get tested?

116
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,355
Excuse me?

117
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,839
You know, because of the ink.

118
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,354
That went inside you.

119
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,072
I'm fine.

120
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,629
- Take care.
- All right, good luck tomorrow.

121
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,153
Oh, thanks.

122
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,956
- I'll pick you up at 11.
- Perfect.

123
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,154
Thank you so much.

124
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,753
Thanks.

125
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,272
Again, thank you so much
for coming.

126
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,475
Oh, of course.

127
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,393
This is Nico. Nico is a good friend of Alan's.

128
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,518
- What's up, bros?
- Oh, yeah, hey.

129
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,350
And that's Blanca. Blanca's been with us
since Alan was a baby.

130
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,793
- Hello.
- Hello.

131
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,996
And this is Timothy.
Timothy lives across the street.

132
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,558
He and Alan swim together.

133
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,755
- Hey, what's up, little man?
- Hey.

134
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,911
- Why don't you guys take a seat?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,956
Tracy's on her way back
with Alan right now.

136
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,591
Obviously, he has no idea this is coming,
so things might get a little intense.

137
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,193
But, no matter what happens, remember:

138
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,158
This is all about Alan getting better.

139
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,875
Mother, Oreo smoothie, now!

140
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,038
Oh.

141
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,677
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey.

142
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,592
Hey, Timothy.
Little cold for a swim, isn't it?

143
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,552
Oh, wow. Look. You went to the pier today.
How was that?

144
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,630
- We had a great time.
- Yeah.

145
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,678
I played skee ball for, like, 45 minutes.
It was a pretty sick workout.

146
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,511
What's going on?

147
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,274
Uh, ahem, why don't you have a seat, bud?
We just want to talk to you for a sec.

148
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,192
Okay.

149
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,469
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey. Yeah.

150
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,028
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

151
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,308
Oh, you got me.

152
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,633
So, Alan...

153
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,759
...we're all here to tell you
about an awesome place...

154
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,477
...called New Horizons.

155
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,432
That does sound awesome.

156
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,274
Alan, this is an intervention.

157
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,749
A what?

158
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,708


159
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,838
Alan.

160
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,916
"I love you so much. We all do.

161
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,991
But we can't keep lying to each other.

162
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,956
Ever since you were a baby, all I want--"

163
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,315
Oh, my God, is anybody else falling asleep?

164
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,595
Alan, listen.

165
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,068
- No offense, Mom, but you're boring.
- Mr. Alan.

166
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,428
Oh, now you?

167
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,273
"I pick up after you for 30 years.

168
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,274
I cleaned your room.
I see things no one should ever see.

169
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,038
But I pray for you.

170
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,869
- Mr. Alan, everyone--"
- Hey.

171
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,995
- Someone should clean that up.
- Alan.

172
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,118
Alan. You are not well.

173
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,272
You're off your meds and you're
clearly upsetting your whole family.

174
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,591
- That's baloney.
- Alan, if you say yes to this...

175
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,230
...we drive you there today, and I promise
you will come back a changed man.

176
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,594
Who's we? What do you mean, "we"?
Who's we?

177
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,910
We. All of us. Stu, Phil, me, you.

178
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,238
You going, Phil?

179
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,630
I love you, Alan.

180
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,472
Hey, Alan, you hungry?

181
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,517
You wanna get some Arby's?

182
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,272
No, thanks.

183
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,109
You know, I meant to tell you earlier,
that's a really cool vest you got on.

184
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:18,917
Thanks, Phil. It was my dad's.

185
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,399
He died in it.

186
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,833
Whoa.

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,638
That's intense.

188
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,509
Hey, Alan, just want to say what you're
doing is really brave. We're proud of you.

189
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,351
Yeah, you're gonna do great.

190
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,195
Stop the car.
I don't want to do this anymore.

191
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,236
- What?
- I changed my mind.

192
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,153
Alan, you can't change your mind.
Everybody's counting on you.

193
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,879
I'm fine just the way I am.
I want to go home.

194
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,631
Turn the car around. Now, please! I don't--

195
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,633
What the fuck was that?

196
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,234
- Oh, my God! He's doing it on purpose!
- Get out of his way!

197
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,798


198
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,356
- Hey! Hey, get the fuck off!
- You have to exchange information.

199
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,193
- Why?
- Jesus. Phil!

200
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,678
- Phil! Phil!
- Oh, shit!

201
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,554
- Get away from him!
- I'm trying!

202
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,995
- Look out!
- Oh, shit!

203
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,789
Aw, shit! Oh, shit.

204
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,389
Shit!

205
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,908
Go, go, go!

206
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,831
Lock your doors! Doug, lock your doors!

207
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,751
Shit! What's going on?

208
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,519
Get the fuck-- Hang on!

209
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,832
- Help!
- Let go, fucking asshole!

210
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,437
- Stu! We're okay.
- We're in an elevator!

211
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,793
Where are you?

212
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,028
What the fuck is going on?

213
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,272
Please, this is a huge mistake.

214
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,878
You got the wrong guys!

215
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,031
I got the right fucking guys! Get him up.
Pick him up. Put him here.

216
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,118
- You're Black Doug! That's Black Doug!
- Shut the fuck up with that. Shut the fuck up.

217
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,872
Oh, my God. It is.

218
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,397
Alan, tell me right now,
why is Black Doug kidnapping us?

219
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,755
- I said don't call me that shit no more.
- Sorry.

220
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,036
- It ain't Alan's fault.
- Thank you, Black Doug.

221
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,277
- Motherfucker!
- Doug!

222
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,555
- Doug!
- Okay, okay.

223
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,868
- Just Doug, okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,994
Why are you doing this?

225
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,512
Because...

226
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,431
...I told him to.

227
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:44,669
I'm Marshall.

228
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,077
And whether you know it or not...

229
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,075
...we all have something in common.

230
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:55,230
And it all started four years ago
when this moron...

231
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,152
...sold the wrong drugs to this dumb fuck.

232
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:03,950
You have no idea the chain of events
that were set in motion that night...

233
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,634
...in the parking lot of a fucking liquor store.

234
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,548
What up, nigga?

235
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,278
Excuse me?

236
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,749
Chill out, I'm not a cop.
Just in town for the night.

237
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,911
Me and my boys looking to get our freak on.

238
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,036
You sold Alan roofies.

239
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,151
Oh, shit. I must've mixed up the bags.

240
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,594
My fault, Alan.

241
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,637
Damn. Marshall gonna be pissed off at me
on that one.

242
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,673
Damn. Marshall gonna be
pissed off at me on that one.

243
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,313
Marshall?

244
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,277
You're Marshall.

245
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,634
You brought us out here because of that?

246
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,309
You're not here because of that.

247
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,519
You're here because some Chinaman
I never heard of strolls into my town...

248
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,910
...and takes one of my guys off the street.

249
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,672
- Mr. Chow?
- Yes.

250
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,910
Yes, Mr. Leslie fucking Chow.

251
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:10,036
You introduced a virus into my life.

252
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,953
Oh, God, what did he do?

253
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,347
He fucked me in the ass.

254
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,476
Oh, he does that from time to time.

255
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,432
Not literally.

256
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,788
Jesus!

257
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,150
A few weeks after your bullshit, I get word...

258
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:28,880
...this sheik is coming in from Abu Dhabi.

259
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,510
He was looking to make some
less-than-legal investments.

260
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,798
He brought his two wives...

261
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,076
...and $42 million in gold bars.

262
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,189
It was a lay-up.

263
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,712
Get down! Get down!

264
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,868
We took it all.

265
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,634
Two vans, each with 21 million in gold.

266
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,872
My guys split up.

267
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,596
One of them made it back...

268
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,637
...one of them didn't.

269
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,314
Is there a problem, officer?

270
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,038
Not anymore, motherfucker.

271
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,434
Leslie Chow stole $21 million from me...

272
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,919
...on a Tuesday.

273
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,791
Oh, God.

274
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,798
I looked everywhere for him.

275
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,790
But he's gone, no one can find him.

276
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,192
Until the little cockroach
got himself pinched in Bangkok.

277
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,038
Sol pay him a visit.

278
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,194
I offer him a truce.

279
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,910
I won't touch a hair on his head.

280
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,390
I just want him to tell me where my gold is.

281
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,192
He refuses to talk.

282
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,711
Not only does he refuse to talk to me...

283
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,634
...he has no communication with anyone
from the outside...

284
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,028
...except you!

285
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,473
Hey.

286
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,959
It's unfair!

287
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,711
Alan, you been talking to Chow?

288
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,314
- They've been writing letters.
- Hey, those are private!

289
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,634
"Dear Leslie, OMG, the McRib is back!
Why was it ever gone?"

290
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,914
Exactly!

291
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,877
"Dear Alan,
I threw urine on prison guard today.

292
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,076
Blamed it on cellmate. Wish you were here."

293
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,752
Yeah, I wish I could've seen that.

294
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,878
Letter after letter of total nonsense...

295
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,951
...except for one common thread:

296
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,519
You guys!

297
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,509
The wolf pack.

298
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,032
Jesus Christ, Alan.

299
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,633
Five weeks ago, Chow escaped
from maximum security detention.

300
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,479
Oh, fuck.

301
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,518
He stowed aboard a shipping freighter
bound for the West Coast.

302
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,630
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

303
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,836
Alan, if you know where he is,
you tell this man right now.

304
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,876
Phil, I don't know, I swear.
I haven't talked to him in months.

305
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,352
We gotta do it the hard way.

306
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,038
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck? Hey!

307
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,316
- Let's go.
- Hey! No! No! What the fuck?

308
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,595
Whoa, what are you doing?

309
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,752
Doug is my insurance. He stays with me.

310
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,387
You don't give me Chow,
I blow his brains out.

311
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,788
You go to the cops...

312
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:24,394
...I blow his brains out.

313
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,074
That's insane! We don't even know
where the fuck he is!

314
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,991
No one does.

315
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,435
But I figure the wolf pack
has the best chance of finding him.

316
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,634
You have three days.

317
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,712
Get to work.

318
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,076
Can you take Stu instead?

319
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,513
Fuck you, Alan.

320
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,949
Shit.

321
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,433
Shit!

322
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,395
- Alan.
- Yeah, Phil?

323
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,357
I need you to roll over here
and chew off these hand-ties.

324
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,669
Okay.

325
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,038
- Oh.
- Damn it!

326
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,276
Ow. Oh, fuck!

327
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,631
- Got a little too much steam.
- Get off me.

328
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,790
All right, let me just shimmy down.

329
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,150
- Would you just hold still? Hold still!
- Ow.

330
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,548
Help!

331
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,878
Help!

332
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,631
Holy shit.

333
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,229
What are we gonna do, Stu?

334
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
- We're gonna go to the police.
- Oh, no, we're fucking not.

335
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,077
Did you hear that guy?

336
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,638
He will kill Doug, period.

337
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,712
Chow is a cancer.

338
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,109
He's been a cancer
since the first day we met him.

339
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,919
We're gonna hand him over to Marshall
and then it's done.

340
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,229
- Hey, Phil.
- Alan, not now.

341
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,435
But I need you, Stu. I can't do this alone.

342
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,318
Do what alone?
We have no idea where he even is.

343
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,548
- Phil.
- What, Alan?

344
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,153
I was gonna say I got this strange e-mail
the other day.

345
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,630
I wasn't sure what it meant,
but now I think it might be from Chow.

346
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,917
"Fatty, it feels good to be out.

347
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,991
I'm close by. Tell no one. I'll be in touch.

348
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,308
Chow."

349
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,471
This says "Chow." How did you not know
this was from Chow?

350
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,914
At the time, I thought it was "Chow"
like "goodbye."

351
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,672
You know, like, "Chow, arrivederci."

352
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,273
- You know, Sbarro, Papa John's.
- I'm writing him back.

353
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,112
Whoa, wait, wait. Just hold on.

354
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,669
Gonna tell him you're happy he's out
and you'd love to see him.

355
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,910
Ooh, I would love to see him.

356
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,311
Do you even know what's going on?

357
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,154
Yes, I do. Phil's doing all the work,
I'm his assistant...

358
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,914
- ...you're standing there looking like an idiot.
- I'm gonna arrange a meeting...

359
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,877
- ...and we're gonna take him out.
- "Take him out"?

360
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,076
Who says that?
How do we take someone out?

361
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,311
We'll use drugs.

362
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,117
Prescription drugs.

363
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,634
You know, the kind a dentist has access to.

364
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,997
Good luck finding a dentist
who will write fake prescriptions.

365
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,309
Oh, I know one. His name is Stuart Price.

366
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,198
Now let's go find a fucking pharmacy.

367
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,397
Whoo! You just got schooled, son.

368
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,074
Are you coming or not?

369
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,593
I don't like this plan.

370
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,228
Okay, then. Ciao.

371
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,430
I got a pretty dope sense of humor, bro!

372
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,240
This amount with syringes
is just weird. Go check it out.

373
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,828
Everything okay?

374
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,069
Well, it's just a strange request.

375
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,355
This drug in this amount
and a pack of syringes.

376
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,510
- It's just a little weird.
- Yeah.

377
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,432
It's just kind of an emergency, so....

378
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:32,148
See, that right there, and you're acting
all fidgety, plus you look like shit...

379
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,470
...in our business, these are all red flags.

380
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,756
I need to call the doctor,
make sure everything's okay.

381
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,833
Aha. You're in luck, because I actually am
the prescribing doctor.

382
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,194
Oh, boy. Another red flag.

383
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,873
It says here you're a dentist.

384
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,031
Yeah. Doctor of Dental Science.

385
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,672
This is fucked up.

386
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,594
Hey, Dad?

387
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,632
I think we got a live one.

388
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,868
How'd we do?

389
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,792
We did good.
I got Demerol, a pack of syringes...

390
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,837
...and almost lost my dental license.

391
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,830
- What about Chow? Anything?
- No.

392
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,594
Oh, look at this.
He e-mailed me like 20 minutes ago.

393
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,872
Alan, we've been sit--

394
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,393
Give me the phone, please.

395
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,510
- What does it say?
- Oh, wow.

396
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,718
He wants to meet Alan tonight at 8.
It says come alone.

397
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,518
- Come alone where?
- A bus stop.

398
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,828
In Tijuana.

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,398
Tijuana's the bomb.

400
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,834
Oh, fuck.

401
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,230
No, that's perfect.
No, it's like a three-hour drive from here.

402
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,631
Yeah, Stu, try reading a map.

403
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,077
Yeah, Alan, try reading anything ever.

404
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,799
Yeah, Stu, try not having
such big horse teeth.

405
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,955
All right, we need a plan.

406
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,474
They're meeting on a bus bench
in a public place...

407
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,551
...so Alan needs to convince Chow
to go someplace more private.

408
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,190
Someplace where we can sneak up on him
and drug him.

409
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,709
Like where?

410
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,353
I don't know, like an alley.

411
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,794
What about a movie theater?

412
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,117
Fuck, that's actually a great idea.

413
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,470
The lights go down...

414
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,597
...we take the seats behind him,
we jab him and it's fucking done.

415
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,473
I'll jab him if you want.
I've drugged people before.

416
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,232
Yeah, us.

417
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,756
No offense, but we're not letting you handle
any drugs. You'll kill someone.

418
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,432
Oh, please, I'm an expert.

419
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,317
Remember the marshmallows in Thailand?

420
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,548
Yeah?

421
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,996
I made it so you could eat at least three
before hitting a fatal dose.

422
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,673
Wait.

423
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:32,388
So you're saying I would've
died if I had four?

424
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,829
Nobody eats four marshmallows, Stu.

425
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,513
That insane theory is the only reason
I'm still alive?

426
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,114
Yes! And you're welcome, by the way.

427
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:42,588
Don't say "you're welcome"
for almost killing me.

428
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,749
- Fine.
- Thank you.

429
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,717
- You're welcome.
- Goddamn it!

430
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,638
Oh, God.

431
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,717
You know, you were right.

432
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,308
About what?

433
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,517
That place in Arizona.
It's not gonna help him.

434
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,519
There is no facility that can fix this guy.

435
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,032
We're gonna spend the rest of our lives
dealing with him...

436
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,351
...because we're all he has now.

437
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,996
You realize that? We're it.

438
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,512
Oh, shit, check it out.

439
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,994
Is that Chow?

440
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,832
Hey, fat stuff.

441
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,148
- Leslie.
- Uh-uh-uh.

442
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,549
- Act cool. Eyes forward.
- Yeah, okay.

443
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,109
- Anyone follow you?
- No, I don't think so.

444
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,554
Good, good.

445
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,076
Gotta keep low profile right now.
Chow wanted man.

446
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,192
Can't trust anyone.

447
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,192
Quick, give me some sugar.
Come on, come on, come on.

448
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,275
What the fuck?

449
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,351
Did he just kiss him?

450
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,478
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pickle, Alan.

451
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,278
- I need a friend.
- Well, I'm your friend, Leslie.

452
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,240
Exactly. That's why I called you down here.

453
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,198
You're the only person I can trust
in this shit-hole of a life.

454
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,589
That's not true.
Stu and Phil are your friends.

455
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,751
Oh, really?

456
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,313
That's interesting.

457
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,193
Where are they?

458
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,998
- Around.
- Around where?

459
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,275
I don't know.

460
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,191
- Motherfucker! I told you to come alone!
- Leslie.

461
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,348
Shit.

462
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,873
- What happened?
- Is he leaving?

463
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,871
We'll talk more! I'll give you another kiss!

464
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,108
He's coming this way.

465
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,951
Get down. Get down.

466
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,394
- Fuck.
- Leslie!

467
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,391
Oh, fuck.

468
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,030
- Get out of the car, you mutts!
- Leslie, no!

469
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,588
- Get off me, fat clown!
- Chow! Chow, calm down!

470
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,715
- Who sent you?
- No one! No.

471
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,997
- We just wanted to see you!
- Liar! No one wants to see Chow!

472
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,117
No, we-- We miss you.

473
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,919
- What?
- We miss you, Chow!

474
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,275
- That's it.
- Yeah.

475
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,873
We miss you.

476
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,068
You miss me?

477
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,232
So much.

478
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,788
You miss Chow.

479
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,348
Yeah, buddy.

480
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,189
We love you, Chow.

481
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,153
I hurt myself today

482
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,192
To see if I still feel

483
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,236
[focus on the pain

484
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,755
The only thing that's real

485
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,356
What have I become

486
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,635
What the fuck am I watching?

487
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,792
My sweetest friend

488
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,750
Everyone I know

489
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,239
Goes away in the end

490
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,913
- Is that gonna be enough?
- Oh, yeah.

491
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,516
This will take about a minute to kick in.
We'll tell the waitress he's drunk.

492
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,875
By the time we get to the car,
he'll be out cold.

493
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,792
My empire of dirt

494
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,673
I will let you down

495
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:41,197
I will make you hurt

496
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,551
Alan, sit down.

497
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,159
That was really nice, Chow.

498
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:52,388
Thanks, Phil.

499
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,993
The key is to sing from your heart.

500
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,390
So Mexico, huh?
What are you doing down here?

501
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,347
You know, fucking, doing blow.
Same old, same old.

502
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,873
Ooh, I got into cockfighting.

503
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,554
- Oh, cockfighting. That sounds wonderful.
- Yes.

504
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,796
Basically, been killing it down here.

505
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,549
That is just terrific. Right?

506
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,472
I mean, that's terrific.
I think that calls for a toast.

507
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,834
I like that.

508
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,718
- To killing it.
- Killing it.

509
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,915
Yeah, to killing it.

510
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,909


511
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,512
You okay, Chow?

512
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,711
I don't know. You tell me.

513
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,755
So how many rooster birds do you have,
Chow?

514
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,631
- Aah!
- Huh?

515
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,279
- Shh. Act cool or I open his vein.
- Oh, my God.

516
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,198
Why you wanna drug poor Chow?

517
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,396
No, no. It's not what you think.
There's this guy Marshall.

518
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,596
Marshall? How you know that fat fuck?

519
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,469
He says you took his gold. He's got Doug.
He'll kill him unless we bring you back.

520
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,757
It's true! I swear to God, it's true!

521
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,476
Chow. Chow, that's the truth.

522
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,999
Goddamn it!

523
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,199
That motherfucker.

524
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,077
Stu, you okay?

525
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,638
- You all right?
- No.

526
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,553
We're sorry, Chow.

527
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,438
We're sorry.

528
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,432
- We didn't know what else to do.
- Next time, don't lie to Chow.

529
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,875
You're right. You are so right,
and we made a huge mistake.

530
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,837
So, what do we do now?

531
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,269
That depends.

532
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,113
Can I trust you?

533
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,151
What is this place, Chow?

534
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,752
My house.

535
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,710
Chow used to be on top of the world.

536
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,316
Had three beautiful homes
in three different countries.

537
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,554
But this one, my Mexican villa...

538
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,917
...this was my favorite.

539
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,392
And everything got fucked.

540
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,152
Chow go to prison, all my property seized.

541
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,912
My homes...

542
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:06,195
...sold at auction to highest bidders.

543
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,838
But I know something no one else knows.

544
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,554
This house is where l stashed the gold.

545
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,277
- Marshall's gold?
- Yep.

546
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,431
Hid it inside the basement wall.

547
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,036
No one knows it's there.

548
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,077
We're gonna go get it.

549
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,153
Wait. You mean break in?

550
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,867
Look, Marshall wants his gold.

551
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,634
And he's gonna hunt me down
until he gets it.

552
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,597
If we show up without it, he'll kill me.

553
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,637
We're not breaking in anywhere.

554
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,791
Not anywhere, Stu. My house.

555
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,711
It's piece of cake.

556
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,632
I know every square inch of this place.

557
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,590
The best part, the guy we're stealing it from
doesn't even know it's there.

558
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,916
So he'll never know it's gone.

559
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,038
You guys know what's going on, right?

560
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,795
What do you mean?

561
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,396
Well, and please correct me if I'm wrong,
we're not breaking into this house.

562
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,831
This house is too small.

563
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,797
We're breaking into another house.
This is just a model, right?

564
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,518
What? Alan, no!

565
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,599
My chickens!

566
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,353
Oh, shit!

567
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,509
Chow, what the fuck?

568
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,150
Watch out for the claws!
They're trained to kill!

569
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,436
His beak is so sharp!

570
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,588
Ow! Ow!

571
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,394
- Oh, fuck!
- Stay still, I'm trying to help.

572
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,152
- Don't!
- Get it off!

573
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,353
- Fucking bull's-eye!
- Are you out of your mind?

574
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,715
Shoot it! Shoot it! Shoot it!

575
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,679
Stu, the window!

576
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,554
- Get it out!
- Okay, okay!

577
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,039
Get it out!

578
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,277
Shh, shh, shh.

579
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,829
Don't struggle. Let go.

580
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,628
You won a lot of fights, Wallace.

581
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,748
Not this time.

582
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,673
- What the fuck is wrong with those chickens?
- They're angry.

583
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,637
All I feed them is cocaine.

584
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,039
And chicken.

585
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:26,998
That's some house, Chow.

586
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:30,789
It was my Shangri-La. Now it's gone.

587
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:35,871
Could you not spit inside my minivan,
please? Jesus.

588
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,514
Who lives there now?

589
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,193
Some dot-com millionaire. He's never here.

590
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,838
This is a vacation home.

591
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,717
The help doesn't show up on Sundays.

592
00:36:44,199 --> 00:36:46,269
No one there but the guard dogs. Stu?

593
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,068
We'll toss these burgers over the gate,
wait for the Demerol to kick in.

594
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,548
Make sure you put in enough to kill them.

595
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,675
We're not gonna kill the dogs, Chow.

596
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,431
This will knock them out for hours.

597
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:58,795
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you worked for PETA.

598
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,951
- What a pussy.
- Ha-ha-ha.

599
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,713
Alan, take that.

600
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,949
Aah!

601
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,438
- Where are you going?
- You'll see.

602
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,079
Pardon me, little loser.

603
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,557
Excuse me, fucking asshole.

604
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,068
Follow me.

605
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,152
Okay, here's the deal:
two security panels inside.

606
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,880
If you cut only one wire, it triggers alarm.

607
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,996
Place will be crawling with cops.

608
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:00,436
But if you cut wire on both panels
at same time, alarm disabled.

609
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:03,557
Yeah, but how are we gonna get inside
without tripping the alarm?

610
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,358
Check this out.

611
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,755
- Any more stupid questions?
- Whoa.

612
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,432
Now, who's coming with me?

613
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,869
I'll do it.

614
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,389
You wanna tell him?

615
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,628
Oh, um....

616
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,711
Alan, you're just too fat.

617
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,634
Roger that.

618
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,278
Ow. Ahh.

619
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,237
You kicked me, you motherfucker.

620
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:47,114
No, no, no. Don't get up.
Will trip motion detectors.

621
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,394
Stay low like dog.

622
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,436
Okay. Good idea.

623
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,349
- Which way?
- In there. The kitchen.

624
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,193
Aah! What the fuck is that?

625
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,510
Ha, ha.
I'm saying hello. We're dogs, remember?

626
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,195
Hey, Stu?

627
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,679
Check it out.

628
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,594
Oh, my God! So gross!

629
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,309
God! Chow, cut it out!

630
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,036
Okay, I'm here.

631
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,599
Now what?

632
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,909
Pull the cover off so you can see the wires.

633
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,068
Okay.

634
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,507
Okay. Done!

635
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:48,398
Okay, on three, cut the gray wire.

636
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,471
One, two....

637
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,708
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

638
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,347
I don't have a gray wire.
I have red, green and yellow.

639
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:58,228
That's weird. I have light gray,
medium gray, dark gray.

640
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,994
You do?

641
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,594
Motherfucker.

642
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,110
My bad. I'm colorblind.

643
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,268
You're what?

644
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,476
Fuck it, just cut the middle one.

645
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,797
No, my middle one could be different.
The wires are all twisted.

646
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,757
- On three. One, two--
- Chow, stop!

647
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,548
God.

648
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,036
Hold on, I'm coming to you.

649
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,871
What the fuck's taking them so long?

650
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,554
Where'd you get that shirt, the Diesel store?

651
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,713
Phil.

652
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,278
What?

653
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,309
It's a cute top. Where did you get that shirt?

654
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,514
What's the problem?

655
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,199
Just point to the wire you want me to cut.

656
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,476
- This gray one right here.
- Great.

657
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,516
For your information, that's green.

658
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,273
Ooh, tsk, tsk, tsk.

659
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,429
Which one's red?

660
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:50,635
The one in your left hand.

661
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,396
- Wait, which hand is that? I'm also dyslexic.
- What the fuck?

662
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,472
- Where'd you get it?
- I don't know. I'll find out, I'll get you one.

663
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:03,757
There's a cool Diesel store in the mall that
I like to go to. Right next to the food court.

664
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,797
I don't know if it's Diesel.

665
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,038
Looks like a Diesel.

666
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,634
What's the matter with you?

667
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,360
Okay, you're still holding
the one I left you with, right?

668
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:15,748
Pretty much. Heh, heh.

669
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,432
Oh, fuck.

670
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,431
All right. On three!

671
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,628
One...

672
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,434
...two...

673
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,389
...three.

674
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,155
Holy shit, it worked.

675
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,235
All good?

676
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,711
- Easy peasy.
- All right.

677
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,994
You have no idea.

678
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,228
Come on.

679
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,072
Whoops.

680
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,677
- Jesus, be careful, Chow.
- Ha, ha.

681
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,478
Fuck this guy.

682
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,552
Living in my house. Living my life.

683
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,311
Can we just stick to the plan?

684
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,469
Fine.

685
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,596
Ha, ha. Ruined.

686
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,838
He is completely out of control.

687
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,831
Let's just get this done.

688
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:11,634
This way. Come on, come on.

689
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,717
It's buried behind this wall.

690
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,628
- Alan.
- Here you go, boss.

691
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,829
Aah!

692
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,469
Fuck!

693
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,675
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

694
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,431
Just warming up.

695
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,318
It's so heavy. Do we have a lighter one?

696
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,268
- Why don't you just let me do it, Chow?
- Okay. Either way, you or me. Same thing.

697
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,829
You might wanna take your shirt off.
Makes it easier.

698
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,878
- What?
- I've heard that too.

699
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,592
See that? Chow come back for you.

700
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,914
That's the last of it.

701
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:57,992
You sure?

702
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,315
- Yeah.
- You triple sure?

703
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,835
- Yes!
- Good! Heh-heh-heh.

704
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,429
Chow?

705
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,673
Chow?

706
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,389
Chow!

707
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,119
Chow!

708
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:22,833
Chow!

709
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,398
Chow!

710
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,032
Chow, open this fucking door right now!

711
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,992
Chow!

712
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,878
Stuart Price.

713
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,668
No felonies. One arrest:

714
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,829
Las Vegas, Nevada.

715
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,155
Phil Wenneck.

716
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,150
No felonies. One arrest:

717
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,675
Also Las Vegas, Nevada.

718
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,878
Alan Garner.

719
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,278
Is this record accurate?

720
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:42,918
Uh-huh.

721
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,592
I did that. Mm-hm.

722
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,159
Yeah.

723
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,311
Masturbating on a city bus.
Yep, that was me.

724
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,277
Look, we've been here for 5 hours.

725
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,271
We already told your guys everything.

726
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,429


727
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:59,068
You told them a story
about a little Chinese man.

728
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:01,708
Leslie Chow. He's an international criminal.
Look it up.

729
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,632
A little Chinese man that no one in town
has seen or heard of.

730
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,155
The hotel where you say he's staying?
No one there.

731
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,275
Probably because he left town.

732
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,273
That's one theory.

733
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,112
Another theory is that you're lying.

734
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,277
"Lewd behavior, Cracker Barrel,
Christmas Eve."

735
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:28,309
Excuse me.

736
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,916
We're fucking dead.

737
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,432
Why would Mr. Chow do this?

738
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,277
Because he's a greedy piece of shit
who used us.

739
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:46,269
- Yeah, but he's our friend.
- Oh.

740
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,873
Grow up, Alan.

741
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,474
You're free to leave.

742
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:54,789
All the charges have been dropped.

743
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,554
By who?

744
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:58,119
It's your lucky day.

745
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,235
There's a car waiting for you out front.

746
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,030
Come on, let's go.

747
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,552
Oh, Jesus.

748
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,235
What?

749
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,833
I'm sorry.

750
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:19,148
What is this?

751
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:21,427
Get in the car.

752
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,672
Excuse me, sir?

753
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:34,068
Where we headed?

754
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,719
Welcome back.

755
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,432
- What the fuck?
- Let's go, guys.

756
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,077
Out to the back.

757
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,949
- Doug?
- Guys. Careful.

758
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,677
Get your ass back over here.

759
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,670
Leslie Chow never lived here.

760
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,789
You didn't break into his old house.

761
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,871
You broke into my house.

762
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:47,148
I don't understand.

763
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,989
You didn't get back the gold
he stole from me.

764
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,710
You got the other half that he didn't.

765
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,552
Oh, my God!

766
00:48:56,719 --> 00:48:58,994
What, you mean the half he never had?

767
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:01,992
He's a world-class rat,
and you three were his accomplices.

768
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:03,148
- No!
- We had no idea.

769
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,833
We were trying to help you.
We thought you'd be happy!

770
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,831
Thank you so much.

771
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,434
Thank you for ripping me off.

772
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,396
Thank you for desecrating my home!

773
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,278
And thank you for killing my fucking dogs!

774
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,715
We didn't kill your dogs.
They're just tranquilized.

775
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,713
Oh, right.

776
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,394
You don't know.

777
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,393
- Chow snapped their necks on his way out.
- What?

778
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:28,153
And somebody's gotta pay.

779
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,554
- He's right.
- No, no, no! Aah!

780
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,590
My head of security.

781
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,719
Couldn't stop three fuckups and
a Chinaman with a pair of wire cutters.

782
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,268
Unreal.

783
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,072
Aw. Man.

784
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,755
That's okay. I know it's scary.

785
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,275
Hector. Run upstairs and grab a pair
of sweatpants for Alan here.

786
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,153
I'm a 44 slim.

787
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:02,789
Can you bring me a few options?

788
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,637
You found Chow once. Find him again.

789
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,994
And my gold.

790
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,074
Wait.

791
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,311
We don't even have a car.
Chow stole my minivan.

792
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,994
Take the limo. Hector has the keys.

793
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:17,831
And get going.

794
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,436
I'm killing Dougs today.

795
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:29,309
- I never saw anyone get killed before.
- Right?

796
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,436
My God, that was so intense.

797
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,318
I mean, he just fell and then he's dead.

798
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,594
I feel sick.

799
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,987
Me too.

800
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:39,760
Well, maybe we should
get some food, guys.

801
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,554
What are we gonna do?
We have no idea where Chow is.

802
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:47,311
I don't know.

803
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,755
He took your minivan.
We could report it stolen...

804
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,672
...and then they could track him down?

805
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:53,719
It's worth a shot.

806
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:57,197
Oh, fuck!

807
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,838
I left my phone in the minivan.

808
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,318
Well, if you lost your phone, Phil,
l have that Find My Phone app.

809
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,391
We have bigger problems than that, Alan.

810
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,949
No, wait, wait, wait.
If your phone's in the minivan...

811
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,679
...and Chow has the minivan,
then your phone's with Chow!

812
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,478
You heard him.
We have bigger problems than that, Stu.

813
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,516
Alan, give me your phone. Quick.

814
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:16,516
- That's brilliant.
- Yes.

815
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,630
- Wait, what's your password?
- "Hey Phil."

816
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,994
- Yeah?
- No, that's it.

817
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:21,353
- What?
- That's my password.

818
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:22,635
"Hey Phil."

819
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:26,233
It is it.

820
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,827
Phil gets it.

821
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,559
Nothing worse than losing your phone.

822
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,277
You just saw a man get murdered.
Your brother-in-law is kidnapped.

823
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,873
You sure there's nothing worse?

824
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,757
You don't get it, Stu.

825
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,469
You just don't get it, do you?

826
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,278
I have over 60 apps on that phone.

827
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,112
What if I lost my phone?

828
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,670
Do you have any idea how much time
and man-hours it would take...

829
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,478
...to re-download those apps?

830
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:56,557
You are right.
I had not thought of that. Thank you.

831
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,789
Oh, God, it's not always about you, Stu!

832
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,757
It's locating.

833
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:05,514
- Oh, God, of course.
- What?

834
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,228
Where is he?

835
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,798
He's in fucking Vegas.

836
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,315
- Shotgun.
- Oh.

837
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,637
Oh, no.

838
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,757
Hey, Stu?

839
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,518
I don't enjoy talking to you that way.

840
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,956
I don't know why you insist
on making me blow my top.

841
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,675
We've been on
a lot of adventures together...

842
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,114
...but it seems like you haven't
learned anything.

843
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,599
Anything!

844
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,909
You think on it.

845
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,597
I'll be in the limo.

846
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,038
He's okay.

847
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,273
Someone needs to burn this place
to the ground.

848
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,998
I told myself I would never come back.

849
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,711
Well, don't worry.

850
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,835
It all ends tonight.

851
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,038
It says 200 yards up on the right.

852
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,471
And there it is.

853
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:49,958
Amazing.

854
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:02,472
Looks like he ditched it.

855
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,958
- It's open.
- No shit.

856
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,677
Well, look around.

857
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,956
Let's see if he left anything in here.

858
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,152
- I found the Demerol.
- Good. Keep it, we're gonna need it.

859
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,596
I got my phone. No fucking keys, though.

860
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,751
- Alan, anything?
- No, not even the gold.

861
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,030
- Why the fuck would Chow come down here?
- I know, right?

862
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:29,675
Why here?

863
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,199
You can't match
the pure strength and power...

864
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,838
...of John Cena!

865
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,311
- Cena puts Punk down!
- Oh! Ha, ha.

866
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,798
Nice!

867
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,750
Excuse me.
Have you happened to see the driver...

868
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,353
...of that minivan that's out front?
Short Asian guy?

869
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:48,748
Yeah, they're all short.

870
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,434
Ha, ha. That's so true.

871
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,353
Right, but he may have been trying
to pawn some gold.

872
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:57,472
That would be my business, wouldn't it?

873
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,552
I like your T-shirt.

874
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,869
I saw that show at the Forum.

875
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,351
He played "Captain Jack."

876
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,992
Yeah, I heard that was legendary.

877
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:12,559
Woman...

878
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:14,311
...you have no idea.

879
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,913
Try me.

880
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,635
Cassie, I'm hungry.
I thought you ordered Chinese.

881
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:24,559
Mom, I'm with a customer!

882
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:27,393
- You'll eat when I say it's time to eat!
- But the doctor--

883
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:30,313
If you don't reverse that right now,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

884
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,028
She's rude.

885
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:38,474
Thank you.

886
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,710
Yeah, you hear that, Ma? Nobody likes you!

887
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,108
Yeah, keep your mouth shut!

888
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,759
Whoa.

889
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:47,032
You're smart.

890
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:57,355
A Chinese guy came in here earlier.

891
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,112
It was pretty weird.

892
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,032
He pawned a gold brick.

893
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:03,588
The thing's worth 400 grand,
he took 18,000.

894
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,753
- Did he say where he was going?
- I'm sorry, was I talking to you?

895
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:14,952
He said he wanted three things:

896
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,998
He wanted some girls,
some guys and some bath salts.

897
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:21,755
I gave him a card for an escort service
and he took off.

898
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,193
Pretty high-end,
so good luck getting anything out of them.

899
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,152
Thank you.

900
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:24,079
We gotta go. We should go.

901
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:25,831
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

902
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,911
I'll get it, I'll get it. I'll get it.

903
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:12,708
Anything?

904
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,313
No, I'm still on hold.

905
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,114
Oh, look how happy this fucking guy is.

906
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,795
Have you ever witnessed a moment
with that much heat?

907
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,951
I mean, white-hot heat, bro!

908
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:26,829
No, it was pretty intense.

909
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,068
Yeah!

910
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,478
Yeah, it's actually an emergency.

911
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:32,994
He has a thick Asian accent.

912
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,432
I totally get it...

913
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,318
...but this is a highly unusual circumstance
and--

914
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,356
Okay. All right.

915
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,268
It's an escort service.

916
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,157
They're not gonna tell us shit.

917
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,753
Maybe an escort would.

918
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,431
- You still have her number?
- Yeah, but...

919
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:00,192
...it'd be pretty awkward.

920
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,717
It's all we got.

921
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,077
She smiled at me again,
from inside the shop.

922
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,717
Ha, ha. This is the best day of my life.

923
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,708
Hey!

924
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,632
Oh, my God, you guys.

925
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,949
It's been so long.

926
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,751
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.

927
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,559
- You look great.
- So do you! You're pregnant.

928
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,954
I feel so fat.

929
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:25,108
Oh, please.

930
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,793
Do you guys mind taking your shoes off?
I'm a germ freak.

931
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,233
- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

932
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:34,628
Alan.

933
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,710
Alan, what are you doing?

934
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:38,755
Sorry.

935
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:41,710
- Wow, you have a great house.
- Thank you.

936
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,074
I got married a year ago to a surgeon.

937
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:46,673
- Another doctor, can you believe it?
- Another doctor.

938
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,757
His name's Jeff. You guys would love him.

939
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:51,077
Tyler, say hi to Mommy's friends.

940
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:52,509
Hi.

941
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:53,795
- Hey.
- Hey.

942
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,550
Wait, is that the baby?

943
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:57,994
Yeah, time flies, huh?

944
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,235
Wow.

945
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,597
Jade is there a place we could talk
that's a little bit more private?

946
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,751
Let's go in the kitchen.
You guys want coffee?

947
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,989
Perfect.

948
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,958
Hey, you coming?

949
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,315
Is it okay if I go say hello to the little guy?

950
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:14,992
Of course.

951
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,188
Nice stuff.

952
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:39,028
Thanks. Jeff bought it for me.

953
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,076
Jeff. Who's that, your fake dad?

954
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,114
Your name was Carlos once.

955
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,759
Did you know that?

956
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,034


957
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:53,599
Well, it was.

958
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,108
And, frankly, it suits you better.

959
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,349
Okay.

960
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,717
Do you remember me?

961
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,079


962
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,789
Are you my real dad?

963
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:22,708
Yes.

964
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,634
I don't know. You gotta understand,
I've been out of that world a few years now.

965
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,074
Yeah, of course. We totally get that.

966
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:31,958
I mean, Jeff knows everything
and he's cool, but--

967
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:34,110
We're just asking if you can call around...

968
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,510
...just find out if anybody
might know where he is.

969
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,228
We could really use your help.

970
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,039
You used to love it
when I would carry you around.

971
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:46,952
Sometimes I can still feel your little head
on my chest.

972
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,996
So do you like this new Jeff guy?

973
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,998
Yeah, he's nice.

974
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,913
My dad was nice too.
We did everything together.

975
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,916
He was my life partner, heh.

976
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:07,878
I really let him down.

977
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,871
Okay. Wow.

978
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:17,675
Just trust me, you don't want to go
over there, okay? Not this one.

979
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,273
I love you too.

980
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,117
She says there's this crazy Chinese guy...

981
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,032
...and he's holed up in the penthouse suite
of Caesars Palace.

982
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,760
There's girls going in and out,
drugs everywhere....

983
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,956
It sounds like a bad scene.

984
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,757
Hey, Alan?

985
01:02:32,199 --> 01:02:33,632
We gotta go.

986
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:38,159
I gotta go, little man.

987
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,038
It was great talking to you.

988
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:42,474
High five.

989
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:48,516
- It's great to see you.
- You too, Jade.

990
01:02:48,679 --> 01:02:50,556
- Thanks so much for your help.
- Yeah.

991
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,199
That's a great kid you got there.

992
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,713
He is the best.

993
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,108
Alan.

994
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:14,510
Oh, hold on. I have something for you.

995
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:22,188
Perfect.

996
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,509
Oh, please.

997
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:25,909
I'll see you around, Carlos.

998
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,670
- Yeah.
- We got him.

999
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,512
- Great. Where is he?
- Caesars Palace.

1000
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,989
Change of plans.
Tell him we're going to Vegas.

1001
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:38,952
I'm on my way.

1002
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:40,711
There's a spot just outside of town.

1003
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,599
I'll text you the details. Be there at 6 a.m.

1004
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,751
And make sure the little fucker's tied up.

1005
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,114
We don't have him.

1006
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,918
Hey, Marshall, it's Phil.

1007
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,195
Maybe Stu wasn't clear.

1008
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,237
We don't actually have Chow,
we just know where he is.

1009
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,675
Yeah, and we were hoping
that you and your guys...

1010
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,594
- ...could go to Caesars and get him.
- I don't give a fuck what you were hoping.

1011
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,512
The deal is you bring Chow to me.

1012
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:04,911
- Oh, fuck.
- 6 a.m. Or your friend is dead.

1013
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:10,635
Shit.

1014
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,597
Oh, God.

1015
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,358
This place gives me the chills.

1016
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:21,358
I know, right?

1017
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:23,755
It's great to be back.

1018
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,275
- So many good memories.
- Are you kidding me?

1019
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:28,119
Okay, so here's the deal:

1020
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,271
You need a key just to get onto his floor.

1021
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,398
And then once you're there,
he's got security posted at the door.

1022
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:34,992
It's ridiculous.

1023
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:37,036
Let me guess, that's him?

1024
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:41,760
Yep. The one with the strobe lights.

1025
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,472
I got an idea.

1026
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,592
But you're not gonna like it.

1027
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:50,679
It's not gonna work.

1028
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,557
Not with that fucking attitude.

1029
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:55,588
You know this whole place
is made out of marbles?

1030
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,476
Come on. Go, go, go.

1031
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,150
After we stick Chow, Alan and I are
gonna take him down through the lobby.

1032
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:13,675
Be waiting in valet.
Engine running, ready to go.

1033
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,431
Are you sure about this?

1034
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,748
Give me the Demerol.

1035
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,394
See you in 20 minutes.

1036
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:20,594
- Hey, Phil?
- Yeah?

1037
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,748
Don't die.

1038
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,713
All right.

1039
01:05:58,679 --> 01:05:59,907
Are you ready to do this?

1040
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:01,478
Yeah.

1041
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,318
Wait, what are we doing?

1042
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,478
Holy shit.

1043
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:17,914
We're gonna climb down...

1044
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,751
...and then it's about an 8-foot drop
to the balcony.

1045
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:24,396
- All right?
- Yeah.

1046
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,353
No, you spit in your own hand.

1047
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,114
Oh, yeah.

1048
01:06:45,159 --> 01:06:46,878
Dry desert air.

1049
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,873
- Alan, it's fine. You don't need it.
- Okay.

1050
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:05,878
Oh, God.

1051
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,317
- Unh!
- Careful!

1052
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,153
- Phil!
- I'm all right.

1053
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,393
I'm okay!

1054
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:22,717
- Hey, Phil.
- What's wrong?

1055
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,949
Hold on a second.

1056
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:25,347
- What?
- Hold on!

1057
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:27,635
Like, kick yourself out a little bit.

1058
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,835
Alan.

1059
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,273
- Stay still!
- Alan!

1060
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:32,635
Did you get it?

1061
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,710
No. Hold on.

1062
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,275
Ha, that's cool, ha-ha-ha.

1063
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,278
Oh! Fuck me!

1064
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:50,753
Everything all right?

1065
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,159
It's okay!

1066
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,514
It's all right!

1067
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:56,949
I got it! Whoa.

1068
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:01,668
Are you okay?

1069
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,552
Alan, it's your turn.

1070
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:20,519
That's it.

1071
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,153
Phil, I can't. I can't.

1072
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,309
Come on.

1073
01:08:28,279 --> 01:08:29,679
Whoa!

1074
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,068
Alan, you all right?

1075
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:32,434
Phil, call Security!

1076
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,438
- I think it's slipping!
- Just hold on!

1077
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,994
Oh! God!

1078
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:39,070
- You need to calm down.
- I'm slipping, Phil!

1079
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:42,594
Oh! Fuck!

1080
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,871
Oh, shit! You okay?

1081
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:49,230
Help!

1082
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,158
Oh, no.

1083
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,591
I'm gonna die, Phil.

1084
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:01,194
No, you're fine. Just....

1085
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:04,032
Drop down to me.

1086
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,788
No chance.

1087
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:07,918
I'm good up here.

1088
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:10,673
Alan, you can do this. I'll catch you.

1089
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,948
Just...

1090
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,395
...let go.

1091
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,069
That's it. That's it. Just drop straight down.

1092
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,635
But don't push off.

1093
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,668


1094
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,351
- Oh, God!
- Come here!

1095
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,273
Holy fuck!

1096
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,673
You okay?

1097
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,828
Yeah.

1098
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,115
Shit. Oh, fuck.

1099
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,278
I almost died, Phil.

1100
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,430
Come on. I wasn't gonna let you go.
You're my boy.

1101
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,831
And you're my man.

1102
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:56,030
Alan, what are you doing? Alan.

1103
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,387
Okay.

1104
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,077
Let's go get this fucker.

1105
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:25,029
Hey!

1106
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:26,628
Have you seen my--?

1107
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,868
Huh?

1108
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:54,512
Phil!

1109
01:10:55,479 --> 01:10:56,958
Motherfuckers!

1110
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:58,948
Grab the gun!

1111
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:05,957
- Oh, fuck!
- Phil!

1112
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:07,109
Oh.

1113
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:08,679
Phil, you okay?

1114
01:11:10,119 --> 01:11:11,154
Chow!

1115
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,429
Chow!

1116
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,677
Chow, open the fucking door!

1117
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:21,474
Fuck.

1118
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:30,595
Chow, stop.

1119
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:31,748
You motherfuckers!

1120
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,957
Leslie, get down from there! Please!
You're gonna hurt yourself!

1121
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:36,519
Nothing hurts Chow.

1122
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,476
I am invisible!

1123
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:42,755
It's "invincible," and you're not.
You're just out of your fucking mind.

1124
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,989
Now get down from there before you die!

1125
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:46,512
Die?

1126
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:50,957
How do you kill what's already dead?
Heh-heh-heh.

1127
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,708
Oh, fuck!

1128
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,712
Holy....

1129
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,193
Woo-hoo!

1130
01:12:02,119 --> 01:12:03,712
- Hey. You okay?
- No.

1131
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,994
Look up.

1132
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,516
What the fuck is that?

1133
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,271
- That's Chow!
- What?

1134
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:11,792
Follow him.

1135
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,993
Woo-hoo!

1136
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,748
Whoo!

1137
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,516
I love cocaine!

1138
01:12:24,199 --> 01:12:25,474
Out of the way!

1139
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,908
How did this happen?

1140
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:30,911
We had him trapped, and then he jumped!

1141
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:32,559
He's out of his fucking mind!

1142
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,074
I'm out of my fucking mind!

1143
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:39,479
Wow.

1144
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:43,314
So beautiful.

1145
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,868
Stu, do not lose him.

1146
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:48,189
I'm trying.

1147
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:50,993
Whoa!

1148
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,077
Oh, shit.

1149
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:58,796
I believe I can fly

1150
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,112
[believe I can touch the sky

1151
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,599
Think about it every night and day

1152
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,387
We gotta pack up all this gold.
We're taking it with us.

1153
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:12,993
Talk to me, Stu.

1154
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:14,512
I got him.

1155
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,795
Ha, ha. I got him!

1156
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:17,435
Oh, shit!

1157
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,953
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1158
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:25,792
Shit.

1159
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,756
Fuck! I lost him!

1160
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,911
Don't tell me that. You can't lose him!

1161
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:33,469
This is so much harder
than you realize, Phil.

1162
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,118
I'm just a dentist!

1163
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,792
No, Stu, you're a fucking doctor.
Now go get him.

1164
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:46,590
Where the fuck did he go?

1165
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,476
Fuck me!

1166
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,516
I should have thought this through!

1167
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,875
Shit!

1168
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,234
Move!

1169
01:13:58,039 --> 01:13:59,519
- Aah!
- Stu?

1170
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,750
- Chow?
- Stop the fucking car!

1171
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,752
- Stu.
- I can't! The pedal is stuck!

1172
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,113
- What?
- Stu?

1173
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,391
- I can't see!
- Stop, motherfucker!

1174
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:12,597
- Get off!
- Pull over!

1175
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,431
- It won't stop!
- Aah!

1176
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,192
Get off the car!

1177
01:14:16,359 --> 01:14:17,952
I can't see anything!

1178
01:14:18,119 --> 01:14:19,519
Ha-ha-ha. We're gonna die finally.

1179
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:32,198
Holy shit.

1180
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,118
Stu? Stu, what happened?

1181
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:37,317
Stu, what's going on?

1182
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,109
We had an accident, and I think he's dead.

1183
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:41,594
Wait, what?

1184
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,716
I think I killed him.

1185
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,479
Holy shit.

1186
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,233
He's not moving.

1187
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:56,912
Oh, fuck.

1188
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,153
Mr. Chow?

1189
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:07,759
Chow.

1190
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:12,229
Stuart?

1191
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,917
He's alive. He's okay.

1192
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,194
Oh, great.

1193
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:19,113
Put him in the limo and come get us.
We'll meet you at valet.

1194
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:20,507
Yeah, okay.

1195
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,748
Stu.

1196
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,311
That was some ride, huh, pal?

1197
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,234
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

1198
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:29,310
I can't feel my nuts.

1199
01:15:30,119 --> 01:15:32,680
Would you rub them
and make sure they okay?

1200
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:36,150
It's over, Leslie.

1201
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:42,435
Wait.

1202
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,511
Let's make a deal.

1203
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:47,115
Want Chow to blow your dick?

1204
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,073
Come on, Stu.

1205
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:55,395
I could be a good wife to you.

1206
01:15:56,359 --> 01:15:58,270
- No more deals.
- No, wait!

1207
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,671
Let's put the bags in the back seat.

1208
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,238
Trunk's full.

1209
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,110
Hey, guys? I'm feeling better now.

1210
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:39,551
All right, it's the next exit,
then four miles straight into the desert.

1211
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,158
Tell you what:

1212
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:44,948
Let me out, we split the gold four ways.
Everyone wins.

1213
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,470
Marshall gonna kill me!

1214
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,470
My blood will be on your hands!

1215
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,550
You want Chow's ghost haunting you
for rest of your life, Stu?

1216
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,994
Floating over you while you make fuck
on your wife?

1217
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,878
He's not gonna kill you, Chow!
He just wants his gold back!

1218
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:04,998
It's gone.
I blew the first 20 million in Bangkok.

1219
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:08,675
- That's why l had to get the other half.
- Enough, Chow! It's over!

1220
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,319
You motherfucker!

1221
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:13,471
When I get out of this,
I'm gonna rip out your fucking lungs!

1222
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,472
You hear me? You're dead! You're all dead!

1223
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,636
I didn't mean that.

1224
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,154
Chow loses temper sometimes.

1225
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,958
Please. I need help.

1226
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:27,314
I know that now.

1227
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,194
That's the exit.

1228
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:52,677
They're here.

1229
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:57,435
Alan, they're coming, grab the last bag.

1230
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,158
Please, Alan.

1231
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,234
Doug!

1232
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:27,118
Step away from the bags. Let's go!

1233
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:33,109
We good?

1234
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:35,270
- It's all there. I promise.
- Not exactly.

1235
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:37,635
I'm still missing the original half.

1236
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,315
But, no, that's all we have. Chow said
he blew the other half in Bangkok.

1237
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:44,993
Where is he?

1238
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:47,719
He's in the trunk.

1239
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,747
Deal's a deal.

1240
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,716
- Doug.
- Give me the keys.

1241
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,399
What are you gonna do with Chow?

1242
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,751
I just wanna talk to him.

1243
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:04,628
Move.

1244
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:07,679
You all right?

1245
01:19:12,199 --> 01:19:13,712
What the fuck?

1246
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,636
End of conversation.

1247
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,636
Why would you do that?

1248
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,757
Leslie Chow is madness.

1249
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,717
You don't talk to madness.

1250
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,634
If you're lucky, you trap it in the trunk
of your limo and you kill it.

1251
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,275
You did a great thing tonight.

1252
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,636
You should feel good about this.

1253
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:42,837
What the fuck?
You think this is a fucking game?

1254
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,708
Don't, don't, don't!

1255
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,108
Oh, shit!

1256
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,791
Toodle-loo, motherfuckers.

1257
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:01,109
Chow.

1258
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:04,515
Chow. Chow, wait.

1259
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,829
Oh, now you wanna talk, blue eyes?

1260
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:08,951
No more silent treatment?

1261
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:10,917
Leslie. No.

1262
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:12,759
Stay out of this, fatty.

1263
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,353
No, Leslie.

1264
01:20:22,279 --> 01:20:24,510
You shoot Phil, you gotta go through me.

1265
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:25,954
What?

1266
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:35,070
- Alan.
- Quiet.

1267
01:20:35,239 --> 01:20:37,070
I'm in a stare-off.

1268
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:46,798
Today you all live.

1269
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,034
Because one of you was a friend.

1270
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,591
Alan, what did you do?

1271
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:58,317
I unlocked the latch
between the back seat and the trunk.

1272
01:21:00,039 --> 01:21:01,871
And left him his gun?

1273
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,876
Yeah, I didn't think it all the way through.

1274
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,230
He gave Chow a fighting chance.

1275
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,597
That's all I ever need.

1276
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:15,268
Fat fuck.

1277
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,747
It's never easy, is it?

1278
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:23,759
No one wants to see that.

1279
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:26,634
Except for me, but I was born bad.

1280
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,114
Hold on. I have something for you.

1281
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,828
For your loyalty.

1282
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,949
- Oh, no, I don't want this, Mr. Chow.
- Okay, give it back, then. Come on.

1283
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:43,993
Quick! Before Stu smells it.

1284
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:46,519
I don't want it either, Chow.

1285
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,716
Oh, please.
Like a squirrel doesn't want a nut.

1286
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,880
It funny because he's Jewish.

1287
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,158
Don't you get it?

1288
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:05,957
Goddamn it.

1289
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,912
Okay, go on. Get out of here, all of you.

1290
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,077
Hey, chubster, I'll call you in a week.
We'll get together.

1291
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,149
No, Leslie, we can't be friends anymore.

1292
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:27,354
What?

1293
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,079
You're not good for me. It's not healthy.

1294
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:33,993
Alan, you're not thinking straight.

1295
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,233
Let's just talk tomorrow.

1296
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:40,113
Leslie, you're one of the coolest
and nicest guys I've ever met.

1297
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:43,317
And you're smart and you're funny
and everybody loves you.

1298
01:22:43,479 --> 01:22:45,277
Alan. What is this?

1299
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,877
When we get together,
bad things happen and people get hurt.

1300
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:52,872
Yeah, that's the point. It's funny.

1301
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,917
Well, I've gotta make some changes
in my life, and this is one of them.

1302
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,399
I'm sorry.

1303
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,351
Farewell, Leslie Chow.

1304
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:21,797
You're cold as ice.

1305
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,908
Shotgun.

1306
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,551
Everybody okay?

1307
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:29,559
Yeah.

1308
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,275
Alan, you okay?

1309
01:24:33,079 --> 01:24:34,399
Yeah.

1310
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,670
Good. Let's go home.

1311
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,431
Jesus Christ.

1312
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,479
You know what, guys?

1313
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:10,358
You can go ahead without me.
There's something I need to do.

1314
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:14,270
Do you even know how to get home?

1315
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:18,190
Of course I do. I'm a grown man.

1316
01:25:18,359 --> 01:25:19,917
I'll ask a stranger.

1317
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:24,868
Good luck, Alan.

1318
01:25:27,399 --> 01:25:28,992
We'll see you soon.

1319
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,752
Did you know that just a couple blocks
from here...

1320
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,797
...there's a place that looks exactly
like Paris, France?

1321
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:10,229
I can't remember what it's called,
but it's supposed to be magnificent.

1322
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:13,073
It's called Paris Hotel and Casino,
and it is magnificent.

1323
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:14,269
Yeah, that's it.

1324
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:17,351
Well, I'd like to take you to dinner there.
Tonight.

1325
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,916
Oh, sorry. No can do.

1326
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:21,988
Oh, well....

1327
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,275
I'm banned from the casino for life.

1328
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:26,032
Plus 10 years.

1329
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,353
I took Mom there for her birthday,
played a little blackjack.

1330
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,509
She split 10s.

1331
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,636
- Oh.
- I may have overreacted.

1332
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,518
They said it was abuse of an elderly.

1333
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,078
Ha, ha. I've done that.

1334
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,310
Heh. Right? Whatever.

1335
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,319
I can't go back there.

1336
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,073
But, uh...

1337
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:49,869
...Golden Nugget has the best prime rib
in town, if that's....

1338
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:54,077
Well, that sounds glorious.

1339
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,439
I'll send for you at 8:00.

1340
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,478
Is that it?

1341
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:42,550
I saw it once in a pornography.

1342
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,113
Oh.

1343
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:45,878
It's a nice gesture.

1344
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:47,472
But maybe we should wait.

1345
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:48,994
Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

1346
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:57,479
I'll see you at 8.

1347
01:28:21,479 --> 01:28:23,277
You look great, Alan.

1348
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:26,550
What do you think? Hat or no hat?

1349
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:27,868
Uh....

1350
01:28:28,039 --> 01:28:30,189
- Hat. For sure.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1351
01:28:31,399 --> 01:28:33,470
Wow. Who's this guy?

1352
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:35,710
The vest and the cane? I love it.

1353
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,711
Thank you. Cassie picked it out for me.

1354
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,279
You look like Mr. Peanut.

1355
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,873
Yeah, I know, right?
That's what I was going for.

1356
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:44,590
- Maybe we'll just lose it.
- Yeah.

1357
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:47,637
Hey, Alan, I was just talking to Cassie.
She's an amazing woman.

1358
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,274
Oh, thank you for saying that.
She is an amazing woman.

1359
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:52,270
I find her much better than your wives.

1360
01:28:52,439 --> 01:28:53,634
Aw. That's sweet.

1361
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,235
Which reminds me.
Um, we need to talk. Doug?

1362
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,311
All right, listen, fellas.

1363
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:05,189
Now that I'm getting married, I'm gonna be
spending a lot more time with Cassandra.

1364
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:08,875
- Yeah. It's the way it should be.
- No, you slow your roll, Phil, okay?

1365
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:10,029
There's more.

1366
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:12,077
And you're not gonna like this part.

1367
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,788
I must resign from the wolf pack.

1368
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,591
Wow, that's a big step, Alan.

1369
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,748
I know.

1370
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,077
But she's my soul mate.

1371
01:29:27,239 --> 01:29:28,957
And my new best friend.

1372
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,229
Plus, she lets me mount her...

1373
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,908
...which relaxes me.

1374
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,234
Oh, my God.

1375
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:38,311
Alan, maybe never say that part again.

1376
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:40,390
Chillax, Doug, we're all adults here.

1377
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,914
I know you mount my sister.
I've seen it. Many times.

1378
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:44,673
What?

1379
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:46,269
Alan, you are the best.

1380
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:47,634
The point is:

1381
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,033
You need to let me go.

1382
01:29:49,399 --> 01:29:50,752
You in particular.

1383
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,511
I can't be your hero anymore.

1384
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,756
Okay. Sure.

1385
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:02,634
Having said all that...

1386
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,712
...I still would like to get together
on Tuesdays for bowling...

1387
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:08,917
...and alternating Sundays
for general horseplay.

1388
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:11,752
- How about we play all that by ear?
- Alan, it's time.

1389
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,069
Here we go.

1390
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:15,038
Ready?

1391
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,753
I'm ready.

1392
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,677
What the fuck?

1393
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,828
Oh.

1394
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:20,193
Oh, my God.

1395
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,953
You guys.

1396
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:24,350
We're so crazy.

1397
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:28,595
I'm wearing women's underwear. Ha-ha-ha.

1398
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,194
Oh, my God. Ha-ha-ha.

1399
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:34,677
Stu, don't freak out,
but you need to look down.

1400
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,153
What?

1401
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:41,037
Oh, my God!

1402
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:46,154
- Ho-ho-ho.
- Aah!

1403
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:49,797
Oh, fuck!

1404
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:52,550
I have boobies now!

1405
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:53,708
Holy shit!

1406
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,154
It's not funny!

1407
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,115
Alan, what did you do?

1408
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,677
What did you do, Alan?

1409
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,273
The wedding cake.

1410
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:03,588
It was from Leslie.

1411
01:33:05,399 --> 01:33:06,435
Oh, my God.

1412
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,398
We had a sick night, bitches. Heh-heh-heh.
