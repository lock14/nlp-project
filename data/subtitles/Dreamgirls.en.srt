00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,813
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Detroit Theatre</i>

2
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>continues our legendary talent contest
with the indefatigable Stepp Sisters!</i>

3
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,658
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

4
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>Something that'll give me a rise</i>

5
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,914
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

6
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>Like a real nice surprise</i>

7
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,963
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

8
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,757
<i>Something that you have got</i>

9
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,636
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

10
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,222
<i>And it's gonna be real hot</i>

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,560
Ladies, you can't go.

12
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:45,272
What about Jimmy?
What about the show?

13
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,401
Marty, you know I can talk.
Now watch me walk.

14
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,660
Sugar, Jimmy was just being Jimmy.

15
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:02,372
You know he's crazy about you.
Just crazy.

16
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,582
Oh, really?

17
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,002
Well, give the crazy man
a message from me.

18
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,422
Tell him I got his number.
His phone number.

19
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,757
Now, baby...

20
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:15,427
At home, where he lives, with his wife.

21
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,681
Come on, Joann.
We don't have to put up with this shit.

22
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,683
Shit.

23
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,563
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

24
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,484
<i>I'm lookin' for something now</i>

25
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,236
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

26
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,448
<i>I'm lookin' for something now</i>

27
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,911
The unstoppable Stepp Sisters!
Let's hear it!

28
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,956
All right now. Won't be long now, y'all.

29
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,668
Coming your way is the wildest man
in show business, Detroit's own

30
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,796
James "Thunder" Early
will be kicking off

31
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:55,008
his national tour right here
on stage tonight.

32
00:02:55,133 --> 00:03:00,639
Mercy. Mercy, mercy. Ladies? Ladies?
I've got the break of your lives.

33
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,601
The great Jimmy Early is looking
for some backup help tonight...

34
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,563
Now I want you to turn it on
for Little Albert and the Tru-Tones!

35
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,942
<i>Me and my baby goin' downtown</i>

36
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,694
<i>Me and my baby gettin' down tonight</i>

37
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,827
- I'm so sorry, Mr...
- Taylor. Curtis Taylor, Jr.

38
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,705
Look, I know we're late, but my mama
don't like me going out on weeknights.

39
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,708
So I had to wait for her to go to bed.
She's a grade-school teacher.

40
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,001
Who are you?

41
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,005
Deena Jones!
I'm one of The Dreamettes.

42
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,132
You were supposed to go on second.

43
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,302
I know, but my mama wouldn't
go to bed, so I couldn't go out.

44
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,513
Hey, tough luck, kid. The show's over.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,265
Let me lay something on you
right quick, brother.

46
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,975
Check it out, man.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,852
Look, I know you're a great man
and you're the boss with all the ladies,

48
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,396
so I don't want you
coming up weak in here,

49
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,065
but low-rating people, that's not
why you're in this business, right?

50
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,233
No!

51
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:57,737
That's good, so why don't we
give these girls a break tonight?

52
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,409
Okay, I'll put you on last.

53
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,370
- Right after Tiny Joe Dixon.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,039
Excuse me, which one is Tiny?

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,006
<i>We're going downtown</i>

56
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:20,677
<i>Check out the sights</i>

57
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,728
Okay, we're going to get down and dirty
with my man, Mr Tiny Joe Dixon!

58
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,570
<i>Baby, I'm takin' the long way home</i>

59
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,616
<i>'Cause my baby don't live there no more</i>

60
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,160
I got the music to the drummer.

61
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,661
C.C., we're on next.

62
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,080
- Where is Effie?
- I'm right here.

63
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:53,918
God, I need to rest.
Where's our dressing room?

64
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,421
Effie, there's no time for that.
We go on in two minutes.

65
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,631
- What?
- Come on, let's warm up.

66
00:04:58,757 --> 00:04:59,758
<i>Move, move...</i>

67
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,439
We're ruined unless
we can find new wigs.

68
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,691
Why do we need wigs in the first place?

69
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,985
Because we need a look.

70
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,781
- I got it! Turn the wigs around.
- What?

71
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,283
No, really.
Come on, turn the wigs around.

72
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:32,499
Oh, Deena, it's so different.

73
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,629
It's sophisticated looking. Come on!

74
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,592
Frontways or backways,
store-bought hair ain't natural.

75
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,011
And what about these dresses?

76
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,599
I mean, this dress does nothing
for my body.

77
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,476
- You got the same wig I got?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,145
- You got the same dress I got?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,897
Then shut up.

80
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,657
Say, Miss?

81
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,451
I think you look just great.

82
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,999
<i>She left with all her clothes</i>

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,585
<i>Her bedroom in a mess</i>

84
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,883
<i>I don't know why she went away
'cause I gave her all my best</i>

85
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,762
<i>Baby, I'm takin' the long way home</i>

86
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,184
<i>'Cause my baby don't live there no more</i>

87
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,189
- What's the name of your group again?
- The Dreamettes.

88
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,025
Nice, baby.

89
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,860
Yeah.

90
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,259
Let's hear it for Mr Tiny Joe Dixon!

91
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:11,806
And now for our final act of the evening,
the courageous, the curvaceous,

92
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,850
Creamettes!

93
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,977
It's The Dreamettes! The Dreamettes!

94
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,396
<i>Move, move</i>

95
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,732
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

96
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,233
<i>Move, move</i>

97
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,402
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

98
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,070
<i>You better move</i>

99
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,406
<i>You're steppin' on my heart</i>

100
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,907
<i>I said, move</i>

101
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,410
<i>You're tearin' it apart</i>

102
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,661
<i>Please move</i>

103
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>Oh, what am I gonna do?</i>

104
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,874
<i>My heart</i>

105
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,168
<i>Is breakin', breakin' up over you</i>

106
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>You've got such magnetic power</i>

107
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,593
<i>That just keeps holding me down</i>

108
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,554
<i>I feel just like a flower</i>

109
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,805
<i>That you're keeping stuck</i>

110
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,849
<i>in the ground, ground, ground</i>

111
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,810
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

112
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,270
<i>Move it, move it</i>

113
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:00,855
<i>Out of my life</i>

114
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,192
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

115
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,318
<i>Move it, move it</i>

116
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,819
<i>Out of my life</i>

117
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,404
<i>Move, move</i>

118
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,365
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

119
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,285
<i>You are so horribly satanic</i>

120
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>The way you lead me around</i>

121
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,458
<i>I feel just like the Titanic</i>

122
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,336
<i>I'm always going down</i>

123
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,129
<i>Move, move</i>

124
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,340
<i>You're steppin' on my style</i>

125
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,342
<i>You're steppin' on my style
Yes, you are</i>

126
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,010
<i>I said, move, move</i>

127
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,765
<i>I want to breathe for a while</i>

128
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,312
<i>Hey, baby</i>

129
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,065
<i>Get out of my life</i>

130
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,818
<i>There's too much pain and strife</i>

131
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,903
<i>So why don't you pack it up
and move it?</i>

132
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,696
<i>Take the cat, kit and caboodle</i>

133
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:51,948
<i>Take your broken-down car</i>

134
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,199
<i>Your smelly cigar</i>

135
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,284
<i>And just move right out of my</i>

136
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,872
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

137
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,392
Come on! Come on! You can do better!

138
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,187
Let's hear it for the delectable,
defiant Dreamettes!

139
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,912
Hey, Mister. Five dimes
say The Dreamettes don't win.

140
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,083
You got it.
They weren't going to win anyway.

141
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,753
Now remember,
the winner of this year's contest gets

142
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:52,049
a week's paid engagement right here
at the famous Detroit Theatre.

143
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,927
All right now.

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,141
And that very lucky,
very talented star of tomorrow is

145
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,270
Mr Tiny Joe Dixon!

146
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,035
Does this mean
we're not going to be famous now?

147
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,453
Well, not tonight.

148
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,330
Come on, let's go home.

149
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,290
Why?

150
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,043
Because I'm tired
and I got to get up early for work.

151
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,003
I mean, what's the point?

152
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,423
Lorrell, how old were we
when we first started singing together?

153
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,591
Twelve.

154
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,303
And C.C., how many dances
you got dreamed up for us?

155
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,972
How many songs written there
in your notebook?

156
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,515
I don't know. Maybe a hundred.

157
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,812
And, Effie, have you ever met anyone
who could sing as crazy as you?

158
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,147
No.

159
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,232
And still we get nowhere?

160
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,903
So I'm asking you, what's the point?

161
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,322
The point is you don't need
an amateur contest,

162
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,990
because there's nothing
amateur about you.

163
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,368
What you need is a break,
and I'm here to give it to you.

164
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,872
Thirty bucks each
to sing behind Mr Jimmy Early tonight.

165
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,332
Jimmy Early?

166
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,626
And a guaranteed 10-week
engagement on the road

167
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,545
starting tomorrow morning
at $400 a week.

168
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,838
- $400?
- Yes.

169
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,424
- You swear?
- If I'm lying, I'm dying.

170
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,885
By the way, Mr Early said
he'd hire my Aunt Ethel

171
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,762
to watch after you gals
while you're away from home.

172
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,847
Mama's going to love that!

173
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,224
Effie, do you hear this?

174
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,976
We're singing behind
Jimmy Early tonight!

175
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,437
- I don't do backup.
- Come on, girl.

176
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,732
All we got to do is just sing
a few "oohs" and "aahs."

177
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,193
I don't do "oohs" and "aahs."

178
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,903
Now, you look, Effie.

179
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,575
- This could be our big break.
- Singing backup is a trap.

180
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,497
Now, I'm sorry, Mister,
but we cannot accept your offer.

181
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,707
All right, all right, all right.

182
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,126
Look, I know you're good.

183
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,213
And you know you're good, too.
And very talented.

184
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,217
And not only that,
you are a stone cold fox.

185
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,094
But that ain't enough.

186
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,055
A girl like you can get hurt out there
if you ain't got somebody protecting you.

187
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,224
Now, I'm here to do that for you, baby.
But you got to believe me.

188
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,767
You got to trust in me.

189
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,894
I ain't gonna disappoint you.

190
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,772
- Come on, Effie? What do you say?
- Come on, Effie.

191
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,486
- Well, Mr...
- Curtis Taylor, Jr.

192
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,658
Curtis Taylor, Jr, our manager,

193
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,496
says we're singing behind
Mr Jimmy Early tonight!

194
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,831
Oh, baby, I love you!

195
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:32,334
This business sure has got
a lot of ups and downs!

196
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,172
Are you ready for the Thunder Man?

197
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:38,799
Now, he's all the way
down in the basement,

198
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,303
and he ain't coming up
unless he can hear you!

199
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,264
Let's hit it, boys. Showtime.

200
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,601
Hey, Marty, I said no mayonnaise, man.
How many times I got to tell you?

201
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,728
No mayonnaise
on the chicken sandwich!

202
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,563
We got bigger problems, baby.

203
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,815
I warned you to lay off
the women that you work with.

204
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,109
There's plenty other ladies out there.

205
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,652
Well, who got time
to go out and find them, Marty?

206
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,029
I'm always working, baby.

207
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,282
Yeah, 'cause Marty always
keeps you working.

208
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,619
Hell, yeah. That's why I keep letting you
give me the wrong sandwich.

209
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,745
Let's go get this money now.

210
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,373
- Is everything set?
- Yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.

211
00:13:11,498 --> 00:13:13,834
This is a group.
It's either three or nothing.

212
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,419
Hey, man, who is this guy?

213
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,421
My clients always work together.

214
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,090
I know you.
Didn't you sell me my Cadillac?

215
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:22,676
Yeah, yeah. In addition to
my management company,

216
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,511
I have a Cadillac dealership
on Woodward Avenue.

217
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,349
Yeah, well, my kitty needs a tune-up.
And Jimmy only works with two, baby.

218
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,267
Sorry, brother, it's two or nothing.

219
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,905
Those the girls right there?

220
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,116
I think three is gonna work out just fine.

221
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:47,576
Ladies!

222
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,122
Ladies. Ladies, thank you so much.
You're saving Jimmy's life.

223
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:54,208
Thank you so much, ladies.
I'm at your feet.

224
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,960
You see that? I'm at your feet, baby.
Thank you so much.

225
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:01,548
And I'd do anything for y'all. Anything.
You hear what I'm saying? Anything.

226
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,135
Exactly what would you like
Jimmy to do for you, baby?

227
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,431
Well, Mr Early,

228
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,185
you could teach us the song.

229
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,065
<i>Thirteen years</i>

230
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,820

00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,405

249
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,205

<i>It's a heavy load</i>

265
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:52,552
That back there is Harlem.
This is Hollywood.

266
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,889
And you ain't welcome in Hollywood.

267
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,605
Time to bring up the lights!

268
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,984
Yeah, let's see which one of these girls
is going home with Jimmy tonight?

269
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,614
I got a nice, warm bed waiting on you.

270
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,787
All right now. Come on now.
Who wants to sit on Daddy's lap?

271
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,207
Yeah!

272
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:28,547
Mr Early? I don't believe
all this all can be happening to me.

273
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,550
Miracles happen all the time
in the world of R&B, baby.

274
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,719
- What's R&B mean?
- Rough and black.

275
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,435
Mr Early, you're so crazy.

276
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,979
Call me Jimmy, baby. Jimmy.

277
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:49,609
Oh, Mr Jimmy. You're so crazy.

278
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:56,158
That does feel nice.
I mean, it feels funny.

279
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,910
You're married, aren't you?

280
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:01,246
<i>Everybody say yeah</i>

281
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,956
<i>Yeah</i>

282
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,416
<i>Say yeah</i>

283
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,542
<i>Yeah</i>

284
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,044
Everybody knows
Jimmy's married, baby.

285
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:12,007
Then...

286
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,802
Then you get your married hands off!

287
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,734
So it's gonna take two weeks.

288
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:34,154
<i>I faked my way to the top</i>

289
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,530
<i>Round and around</i>

290
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:37,115
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

291
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,533
<i>Round and around</i>

292
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:40,160
<i>I faked my way to the top</i>

293
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,745
<i>Round and around</i>

294
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:43,788
<i>Round and around</i>

295
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,374
<i>You know I faked my way to the top</i>

296
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:47,959
<i>Round and around</i>

297
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:52,756
<i>It's always real, so real</i>

298
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,636
<i>When you're coming down</i>

299
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:02,098
<i>I faked my way, yes, I did</i>

300
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,980
<i>Help me, Jesus</i>

301
00:19:09,105 --> 00:19:11,483
<i>Help, help, help me, Jesus</i>

302
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,490
<i>I faked my way to the top</i>

303
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,878
Did you notice
the seats are periwinkle blue

304
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:34,839
to go along with
your pretty blue dress? And...

305
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:38,385
- Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.

306
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,220
Wayne? Help me out.

307
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,806
Hi.

308
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,599
How can I help you today?

309
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,062
Here. This is our periwinkle blue.
Matches your dress.

310
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:10,083
I'm just saying, you might do better
if you were just a little more, you know...

311
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,545
- Shy? Sugar-sweet, like you?
- Boys seem to like it.

312
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,423
Well, I am not interested
in boys, Deena.

313
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,049
What are you ladies jawing about?

314
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:21,803
Well, Curtis, we were just wondering...

315
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,391
Do you cheat on your wife,
like Mr Jimmy Early?

316
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,977
Hey, Effie! I don't know her.

317
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:33,064
Deena's right.
It's really none of our business.

318
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,233
We don't even know if you're married.

319
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,735
I was married. It didn't work out.

320
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:44,075
Well, was she one of those teeny little
tweety-birds like little Miss Deena here?

321
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,119
Or do you prefer a real woman?

322
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,455
Well, actually, I was raised
by my older sisters,

323
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,748
and they were just as real as you are.

324
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,543
Well, why don't you sit down
and tell me about them?

325
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:56,796
You know, I would love to,
but give me a minute.

326
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,350
It ain't working, Marty.
That faint used to kill 'em.

327
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:11,352
- It used to slay 'em in the aisles.
- Slay 'em in the aisles, baby.

328
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:12,645
But now you got everybody doing it.

329
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,023
You got Otis, J.B.
Everybody doing my shit.

330
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,274
You're right, Jimmy.
Everybody's doing it.

331
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:17,442
Well, who's the original?

332
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,985
Who was the first one to fall down
and start screaming?

333
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,361
- That was you.
- I'm the first!

334
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:23,281
And you killed 'em tonight, baby.
It was beautiful, Jimmy. Beautiful.

335
00:21:23,406 --> 00:21:25,283
Marty, you're full of shit, man.
I need something.

336
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:27,452
Man, I need something...

337
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,454
That's what I need.
Sweet Mother Jesus.

338
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,873
I need that right there!

339
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,125
What you need is a new sound.

340
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,171
What I need is a new Caddy.
That one you sold me is dripping oil.

341
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,718
Hey, Jimmy, you remember C.C.,
Effie's brother?

342
00:21:43,843 --> 00:21:45,803
He's a very talented composer.

343
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,722
<i>Yeah, I remember you.
You wrote that song, Move On.</i>

344
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,432
Move.
The girls be, "Move, move, move."

345
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:50,808
Yeah, that was me, man.

346
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,936
- All right.
- Yeah.

347
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,522
What did you think of that song, Marty?

348
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,901
Well, I think it was kind of...

349
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:03,154
You know...

350
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:09,744
- Kind of boring, I thought.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

351
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,829
It's boring, kid.

352
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:13,748
I'm no kid, mister.

353
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:19,712
I'm sorry, baby,
but when Jimmy's involved,

354
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,839
the song got to have some soul!

355
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:31,641
Damn! Lord have mercy!

356
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,851
Got to have soul!

357
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,023
Soul, gospel, R&B, jazz, blues,

358
00:22:39,148 --> 00:22:41,484
everything else the man
has grabbed from us.

359
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:43,361
Listen, there's got to be a better way
for us to get our music

360
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:44,529
to a broader audience,

361
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,615
only this time
with our artists and our money.

362
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,576
Marty, this man is handing me
a line of crap.

363
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,245
Yeah, I know, baby.

364
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:56,708
<i>Got me a Cadillac
Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

365
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,919
<i>Got me a Cadillac car</i>

366
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,675
<i>Got me a Cadillac
Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

367
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:09,429
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

368
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:17,478
I know what you cats are trying to do,
and you can forget it.

369
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:21,274
James Early ain't no street-corner punk
looking for his first date.

370
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,236
He's an established artist
with a recording contract.

371
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,114
On a shitty local label
that can't get him to the pop charts.

372
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,365
We can't do nothing about that.

373
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,577
All I'm asking is one record, man.
One song with a simple hook.

374
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,997
"Look at me in my pretty car,
makes me feel like a movie star."

375
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,583
You know where all the hits
happen these days? In cars, man.

376
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,295
Songs that make you feel good
while you're driving your automobile.

377
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:44,213
Yeah?

378
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:48,301
Jimmy's fans like taking the bus.

379
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:50,595
Let's hit it, Jimmy.

380
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:56,309
Hey, what do you think about
using that bridge there, baby?

381
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,023
<i>Movin' out</i>

382
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:03,816
<i>Movin' up</i>

383
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:05,276
<i>Movin' on</i>

384
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:06,777
Sounds a little tick-tock, boys.

385
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,154
Let's stay in the pocket.

386
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,907
Going to work! Shut it down!

387
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,701
<i>Recording, Cadillac Car. Take nine.</i>

388
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:16,871
<i>I got me a Cadillac</i>

389
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,372
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

390
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,833
<i>I got me a Cadillac car</i>

391
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,127
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>

392
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:24,629
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

393
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,714
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

394
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,301
<i>I'm on the move</i>

395
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,053
<i>I'm gettin' on</i>

396
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:33,638
<i>I'm breakin' out</i>

397
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,431
<i>And it won't take long</i>

398
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:36,974
<i>Behind the wheel</i>

399
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:38,476
<i>Got a song</i>

400
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,019
<i>Pedal's down</i>

401
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,647
<i>And I'm gone</i>

402
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,902
We've got that coming up
in the next hour,

403
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:50,071
but for now,
let me get a hold of your ear.

404
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:51,822
It's a different sound
for the Thunder Man.

405
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,616
But I think you're gonna enjoy it.

406
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:57,453
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>

407
00:24:57,578 --> 00:24:59,121
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

408
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,249
Oh, my God, Lorrell!
Do you hear that? That's us!

409
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,376
We're on the radio, Curtis!

410
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:07,421
- What's happening?
- Black station, the signal's too weak.

411
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:09,048
Turn this boat around! Hurry up!

412
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:11,300
C.C., fix it! What are you waiting for?

413
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:14,136
<i>Antenna's up</i>

414
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,471
<i>Top is down</i>

415
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:17,056
<i>Peelin' out</i>

416
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,557
<i>Don't care where I'm bound</i>

417
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,184
<i>Got these four wheels</i>

418
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,686
<i>Spinnin' round</i>

419
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,479
<i>Me and my two-tone Caddy</i>

420
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:26,190
<i>Gonna blow this town</i>

421
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:27,775
<i>Movin' out</i>

422
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:32,488
<i>Cadillac Car is No. 8 on the R&B charts,
and No. 98 on the pop charts.</i>

423
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:33,864
<i>Movin' out</i>

424
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:35,533
<i>Movin' up</i>

425
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:36,867
<i>Movin' on</i>

426
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:55,219
<i>Right to the top</i>

427
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,406
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>

428
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,742
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

429
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,412
<i>Got me a Cadillac car</i>

430
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:24,582
<i>Oh, I've got me a Cadillac</i>

431
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,834
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

432
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:31,213
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

433
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:36,302
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

434
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,764
<i>Look at me, mister</i>

435
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:45,936
<i>I'm a star</i>

436
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:54,195
<i>That's Dave & the Sweethearts
with their marvellous</i>

437
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,447
<i>new recording, Cadillac Car.</i>

438
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:08,834
You hear this shit?

439
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:11,212
You hear this shit?

440
00:27:12,338 --> 00:27:14,131
They act like we don't even exist!

441
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:15,758
Is that how it works, Curtis?

442
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:18,093
The man decides he wants something,
he just takes it?

443
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,804
I mean, how can they do that?
That's my song.

444
00:27:21,597 --> 00:27:22,848
Our song.

445
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:25,309
Marty says this happens all the time.
Once something...

446
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:27,061
That's bullshit, man!
He should have protected us!

447
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:30,564
Wake up, brother.
The only one that can protect you is me.

448
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:34,652
<i>Who was the first artist
to sing Hound Dog?</i>

449
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:35,986
Elvis Presley.

450
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,823
Big Mama Thornton. She had
the No. 1 single on the R&B charts,

451
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,991
but white stations wouldn't play it

452
00:27:41,116 --> 00:27:43,452
because to them it was
just another race record.

453
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:47,915
We are gonna make friends with the
most important deejays in this country.

454
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,668
It's strictly pay-for-play with those boys.

455
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:53,087
That takes money. Real money.

456
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:56,840
What is that? Chicken scratch?

457
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,134
Let's get to work.

458
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,971
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

459
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:06,183
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

460
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,729
<i>The smile I had is gone away</i>

461
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:13,190
<i>Those that steal are gonna pay</i>

462
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:19,029
<i>Steppin' to the bad side today</i>

463
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:22,449
<i>I'm telling you now, it's got to end</i>

464
00:28:22,574 --> 00:28:24,827
<i>No more trusting them, my friend</i>

465
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:25,995
<i>Change our style</i>

466
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,204
<i>Change our tone</i>

467
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:29,206
<i>Make the songs we sing our own</i>

468
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:31,875
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

469
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:36,588
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

470
00:28:38,674 --> 00:28:41,135
<i>I'll get you all the breaks you need</i>

471
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,470
<i>In just two years, we'll be in the lead</i>

472
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:45,806
<i>Can't sit back, it's plain to see</i>

473
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:48,058
<i>Open your eyes and trust in me</i>

474
00:28:48,183 --> 00:28:50,394
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

475
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,232
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

476
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,820
<i>I was a man who tried to be good</i>

477
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:02,239
<i>I was always misunderstood</i>

478
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:04,116
<i>You can't play fair or be too meek</i>

479
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:05,617
<i>You gotta get way down</i>

480
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:08,078
<i>and show your danger streak</i>

481
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,332
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

482
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:15,544
Here's a great new song
from Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes.

483
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:17,963
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

484
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:23,510
...a new hit from Jimmy Early
and The Dreamettes.

485
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:26,638
<i>It's called Steppin' to the Bad Side.</i>

486
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:01,548
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
to the Apollo Theatre's legendary stage</i>

487
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:03,801
<i>Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes,</i>

<i>I had to step into the bad side</i>

<i>A man just stole my woman from me</i>

504
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:51,848
<i>He took her down to Tennessee</i>

505
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:53,684
<i>She was the best girl I ever knew</i>

506
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,186
<i>If it wasn't for him, she'd still be true</i>

507
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:58,438
<i>Always been a good man, it's been said</i>

508
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:00,607
<i>When I catch the man
He'll wish he was dead</i>

509
00:31:00,732 --> 00:31:02,818
<i>Men like him make good men mad</i>

510
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:06,488
<i>Starting today I'm gonna be bad</i>

511
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:11,034
<i>I'm steppin' to the bad side</i>

<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

517
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,718
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

518
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:32,806
<i>Steppin' to the bad side today</i>

519
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,394
<i>- Step on
- Step on to the bad side</i>

520
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,146
<i>Step on to the bad side</i>

521
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:41,523
<i>- Step on
- Step on to the bad side</i>

522
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:43,734
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

523
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:47,321
<i>- Step on
- Step on to the bad side</i>

524
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:57,331
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

525
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:03,253
<i>Got to step to the bad side</i>

526
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:12,554
<i>The motor is now cranked up</i>

527
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,765
<i>and we are moving up
the highway of freedom</i>

528
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,850
<i>toward the city of equality.</i>

529
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:20,395
<i>And we can't afford to stop now,</i>

530
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,774
<i>because our nation
has a date with destiny.</i>

531
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:25,692
<i>We must keep moving.</i>

532
00:32:26,443 --> 00:32:29,321
<i>I have a dream this afternoon</i>

533
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:32,157
<i>that one day right here in Detroit,</i>

534
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:35,827
<i>Negroes will be able to buy a house</i>

535
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:38,914
<i>anywhere that their money
will carry them,</i>

536
00:32:39,164 --> 00:32:41,625
<i>and they will be able to get a job.</i>

537
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:46,129
Made my peach cobbler!

538
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:48,048
Curtis!

539
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:51,468
- Hey, baby, you know my sisters.
- Tell me something.

540
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:54,221
Do you think it's right to promote
an amateur performer

541
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:55,972
over a professional?

542
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:57,390
I don't know what this is about.

543
00:32:57,516 --> 00:33:00,685
It's about fairness, Curtis.
It's about people paying their dues.

544
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:05,482
Ain't that what you keep telling me?
"Get in line, Effie. Wait your turn."

545
00:33:06,316 --> 00:33:10,987
So why am I sitting here without
so much as a B-side on the 45

546
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:14,991
when an amateur like
Martin Luther King, Jr

547
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:17,494
gets his own freakin' album?

548
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:19,871
I mean, can he even sing?

549
00:33:33,134 --> 00:33:34,553
All right, that was a good one.

550
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,513
You're a great man, Curtis.

551
00:33:37,347 --> 00:33:39,724
Isn't your brother a great man?

552
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:54,864
<i>Never met a man</i>

553
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:59,077
<i>Quite like you</i>

554
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:03,081
<i>Doin' all he can</i>

555
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:07,335
<i>Makin' my dreams come true</i>

556
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:11,590
<i>You're strong and you're smart</i>

557
00:34:11,715 --> 00:34:13,675
<i>You've taken my heart</i>

558
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,429
<i>And I'll give you the rest of me, too</i>

559
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:20,974
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

560
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:23,560
<i>I love you, I do</i>

561
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:27,939
<i>I love you</i>

562
00:34:29,316 --> 00:34:31,443
<i>Never felt</i>

563
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:35,905
<i>quite like this</i>

564
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,576
Hold it, hold it. I promise
I'll get to all of you in a minute,

565
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:41,995
but right now I need
someone that can type.

566
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,747
Anybody got some
secretarial experience?

567
00:34:43,872 --> 00:34:45,915
- I can do it.
- You? Come on.

568
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,127
What's all this?

569
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:52,339
All right, come in.

570
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:57,927
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

571
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,722
<i>I love you, I do</i>

572
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:05,518
<i>You've got the charm</i>

573
00:35:05,643 --> 00:35:08,980
<i>You simply disarm me every time</i>

574
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:13,276
<i>As long as you drive</i>

575
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:15,945
<i>I'm along for the ride your way</i>

576
00:35:19,657 --> 00:35:21,451
<i>You said it before</i>

577
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:23,244
<i>There won't be a door</i>

578
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:26,289
<i>That's closed to us</i>

579
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:31,336
<i>I'm puttin' all my trust in you</i>

580
00:35:31,836 --> 00:35:37,175
<i>'Cause you, you'll always be true</i>

581
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,677
<i>I never could have known</i>

582
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:43,348
<i>This would be</i>

583
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:47,310
<i>You and you alone</i>

584
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:52,315
<i>All for me</i>

585
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,402
<i>I know you're the best</i>

586
00:35:56,528 --> 00:35:58,446
<i>You've passed every test</i>

587
00:35:58,571 --> 00:36:02,408
<i>It's almost too good to be true</i>

588
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:05,662
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

589
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:07,914
<i>I love you, I do</i>

590
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,880
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

591
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:21,636
<i>I love you, I do</i>

592
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:35,275
C.C. Wrote it for me.

593
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,985
What do you think, Curtis?

594
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:40,530
It's too light.
We want light, but not that light.

595
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:41,739
Not that light?

596
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:44,158
Okay, but when we fix it,
you're gonna put it in the show, right?

597
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:45,285
First things first.

598
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,786
I got to get Jimmy booked
down in Miami,

599
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:48,204
even if I got to buy my own hotel.

600
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:51,040
But you promised I wouldn't spend
my life singing backup, Curtis.

601
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:52,166
And I still promise that.

602
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:55,420
I'm not gonna let this beautiful voice
go to waste.

603
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:58,590
You just got to trust me.

604
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:01,801
- Can we talk about it more tonight?
- All night.

605
00:37:05,722 --> 00:37:07,390
- All right.
- Bye, man.

606
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:09,475
All right.

607
00:37:09,976 --> 00:37:11,811
Boy, you're a real snake.

608
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:14,689
A cheap, second-rate hustler.
Street-corner con artist.

609
00:37:14,814 --> 00:37:17,400
Look, you want to buy a car, Marty?
Why don't we talk about it in my office?

610
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:20,028
I'm away a week,
and you cancel dates behind my back.

611
00:37:20,153 --> 00:37:22,238
I spent six months
setting up this tour for Jimmy.

612
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:24,073
Jimmy's too big for
that Chitlin Circuit shit.

613
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:26,242
I'm trying to get him booked
at the Paradise in Miami.

614
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:27,619
- Miami?
- Miami.

615
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:28,745
You're really drifting out there, chump.

616
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:31,581
You couldn't get Sammy Davis, Jr
in there.

617
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:35,168
That place is so white, they
don't even let our boys park the cars.

618
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:36,919
I got him an audition.

619
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:41,466
- Luck, man. Hustler's luck.
- That's just the beginning.

620
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:43,426
Then we're gonna do the Copa,
the Americana.

621
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:44,927
<i>He could even do American Bandstand.</i>

622
00:37:45,053 --> 00:37:46,554
I've been in this business
too many years

623
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:50,308
- to listen to some hotshot talk bullshit.
- Not bullshit, Marty. Change.

624
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:53,770
I'm talking change. Can't you see?
The time is now.

625
00:37:53,895 --> 00:37:57,440
Jimmy needs a new act, something
classier, with a catchier sound.

626
00:37:57,565 --> 00:37:58,983
That'll go down better with white folks.

627
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:00,276
That'll put him where he should be,

628
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:02,153
making the type of money
he should be making.

629
00:38:02,278 --> 00:38:05,073
He's at the top of the pop charts.
He's hot.

630
00:38:09,077 --> 00:38:11,579
- We can do this for him.
- We?

631
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:13,581
- Yeah, we.
- We do nothing.

632
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,959
Jimmy's mine, so back off, Curtis.
Jimmy's mine.

633
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:19,087
Jimmy don't belong to no one.

634
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:22,256
Are you defending
this car salesman, Jimmy?

635
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:23,883
Can't you see he's using you?

636
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:26,594
Ain't nobody using Jimmy, all right?
Nobody.

637
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:30,223
Who do you think you're
talking to, baby? It's Marty.

638
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,726
The man who found you singing for
pennies when you were 10 years old.

639
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:36,979
It's a whole new day, Marty,
and a brand new Jimmy.

640
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:45,988
You want him, brother? You got him.

641
00:38:46,572 --> 00:38:47,740
I'm through.

642
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:50,785
- Hey, what you doing?
- You can't have it all, baby.

643
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,329
Hey, come on, Marty, don't go.
I want you to stay.

644
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,417
I love you, Jimmy.

645
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:02,046
But you can't have it all.

646
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:14,851
Lady, you got to be Jewish.
Of course, yeah, of course.

647
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:18,020
It's 105 degrees in here, and you're
the only one wearing a mink stole.

648
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:19,730
Hey, my friend, what's your nationality?

649
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:22,400
"Nationality." I know it's a big word.
What are you, Cuban?

650
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,735
Of course. You're Cuban.
You're Cuban, I'm a Jew.

651
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,571
You know, I say this
from the bottom of my heart.

652
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:29,073
A Negro, if he had enough money,
could move into my neighbourhood.

653
00:39:29,198 --> 00:39:30,700
You, not a chance.

654
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:34,078
Tonight, though,
we're here to make history.

655
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:37,790
The first Negro headliners
to ever play Miami Beach.

656
00:39:37,915 --> 00:39:39,292
What do you think of that?

657
00:39:39,417 --> 00:39:41,168
Come on.
It's a very convenient arrangement.

658
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:43,546
These are good people.
I mean, they can sing, they can dance,

659
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:46,799
they can even mop up afterwards.
You can't find help like that.

660
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:51,971
Anyway, please give a warm round
of applause to the very talented

661
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:55,474
Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes!
Come on!

662
00:40:04,108 --> 00:40:07,945
<i>I want you, baby</i>

663
00:40:08,446 --> 00:40:11,782
<i>I want you</i>

664
00:40:11,908 --> 00:40:14,911
<i>And I need you, baby</i>

665
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,539
<i>I need you</i>

666
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:20,124
<i>Oh, baby</i>

667
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:21,792
<i>Baby</i>

668
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,003
<i>You got me on my knees</i>

669
00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:26,422
<i>Got me on my knees</i>

670
00:40:26,547 --> 00:40:28,966
<i>You got me begging</i>

671
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:32,386
<i>Baby, baby</i>

672
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:35,806
<i>Baby, baby</i>

673
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:41,479
<i>Baby, please</i>

674
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:45,983
<i>I know you don't trust</i>

675
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:49,695
<i>the way I feel</i>

676
00:40:51,238 --> 00:40:54,617
<i>You know, we can always create
a younger look for American Bandstand.</i>

677
00:40:54,742 --> 00:40:55,743
Yeah.

678
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:02,166
<i>You got me on my knees</i>

679
00:41:03,918 --> 00:41:06,712
<i>You got me beggin'</i>

680
00:41:06,837 --> 00:41:10,091
<i>Baby, baby</i>

681
00:41:10,257 --> 00:41:12,468
<i>Baby, baby</i>

682
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,433
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

683
00:41:25,564 --> 00:41:28,484
<i>Oh, I want you, baby</i>

684
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:32,321
<i>And I need you, baby</i>

685
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:34,156
<i>Yes, I do</i>

686
00:41:34,281 --> 00:41:36,826
<i>I want you</i>

687
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:42,206
<i>Baby, you got me, baby</i>

688
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:44,542
<i>Now I'm yours, baby</i>

689
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,059
Yes!

690
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:16,615
I love me some Jimmy, but he's
gonna have to stop calling me "baby."

691
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,825
I'm a woman now.

692
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,493
Did you see the man
Curtis was sitting with?

693
00:42:19,785 --> 00:42:23,205
Did you hear what I said, Deena?
I am a woman now.

694
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,624
- Lorrell, I know.
- What do you mean, you know?

695
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:28,752
- Has Jimmy talked?
- He didn't have to.

696
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:31,088
How could you?
Come on, you're just a baby, Lorrell.

697
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:34,967
I am not, Deena. I'm a woman now.
I'm 18, so I'm a woman.

698
00:42:35,092 --> 00:42:37,261
Yeah, she's a mature woman, like me,

699
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:40,264
and she loves Jimmy
just as much as I love Curtis.

700
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:44,101
- It's not wrong when you love someone.
- Is that all you two can think about?

701
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:45,352
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

702
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,272
Well, there's no doubt
my mama brought me up fit.

703
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:52,234
- Deena, you're just jealous.
- Let yourself go just once.

704
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:55,446
It's so wonderful
to have somebody to love.

705
00:42:58,324 --> 00:43:00,075
- You ladies decent?
- Well, I am.

706
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:02,578
- I can't speak for these two.
- Hey, babe.

707
00:43:05,623 --> 00:43:07,875
<i>Curtis, how did it go
with American Bandstand?</i>

708
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,001
Timing's not right.

709
00:43:09,126 --> 00:43:12,004
Well, maybe they'll be more
interested after we play the Copa.

710
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:13,923
- Y'all ain't playing the Copa.
- What?

711
00:43:15,174 --> 00:43:16,759
I'm breaking you and Jimmy up.

712
00:43:16,884 --> 00:43:18,761
I know what you're doing, Curtis!

713
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:20,971
You're breaking us up 'cause
you don't want me with Jimmy.

714
00:43:21,096 --> 00:43:22,556
None of you do!
Because you're all jealous!

715
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:25,225
Well, nothing's breaking me
and Jimmy up! Nothing!

716
00:43:27,227 --> 00:43:29,730
I'm breaking you up because
Jimmy is going back out on the road,

717
00:43:29,855 --> 00:43:31,982
while you stay here
and open your own act.

718
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:33,776
Did you say our own act?

719
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,821
Finally, Curtis! This is what
I've been waiting for. I love you.

720
00:43:38,113 --> 00:43:40,240
Oh, well, honey, I'm fine with that.
I mean, I love me some Jimmy,

721
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:42,242
but I don't want to be singing
behind him the rest of my life.

722
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:44,787
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting The Dreams.

723
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:46,997
The Dreamettes were little girls.
You're women now.

724
00:43:47,122 --> 00:43:49,166
- You see, Deena, I told you!
- We open in a week,

725
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:51,335
so we got a lot of work to do.
We're gonna have a lot of changes.

726
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,962
I'm bringing on Jolly Jenkins
to stage a whole new show.

727
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:56,965
He's done movies, Broadway,
clubs acts, you name it.

728
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:59,677
New wigs, the expensive kind.

729
00:43:59,968 --> 00:44:02,888
Brand-new costumes
to appeal to a younger crowd.

730
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,515
And...

731
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,350
Effie?

732
00:44:07,893 --> 00:44:11,397
- Deena's going to sing lead.
- Deena's doing what?

733
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:14,441
- Lead.
- What do you mean?

734
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:18,737
- I always sing lead. Tell him, C.C.
- We're trying something new, Effie.

735
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:24,493
- You knew about this?
- Curtis and I talked it over.

736
00:44:25,244 --> 00:44:26,787
He said it's only temporary.

737
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:29,748
We finally get the chance
to have our own act

738
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:31,458
and Deena's doing lead?

739
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:33,419
She can't sing like I can.

740
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:35,671
She's right, Curtis. I can't.

741
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:38,424
I don't want to.

742
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:42,803
Now, y'all gonna do what I tell you to do.
This is a new sound with a new look.

743
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:45,597
New look?
Nobody can see her on a record!

744
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,059
The only way we'll be able to change
things is by appealing to kids,

745
00:44:49,184 --> 00:44:50,894
and kids today watch television.

746
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:55,190
So Deena's going to sing in the lead
'cause you like the way she looks?

747
00:45:00,237 --> 00:45:01,405
Am I ugly to you, Curtis?

748
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,867
Baby, come on. You know
how I feel about you. Come on.

749
00:45:06,493 --> 00:45:09,913
- Don't make it personal.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

750
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:12,249
Deena's beautiful and she's
always been beautiful!

751
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:15,043
But I've got the voice, Curtis!
I've got the voice!

752
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:17,337
You can't put me in back! You just can't!

753
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:20,132
Well, you'll be singing backup with me.
What's so wrong with that?

754
00:45:20,257 --> 00:45:22,593
Let Deena do all the work for a change.

755
00:45:22,718 --> 00:45:24,052
Your voice alone is too special.

756
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:27,306
We need a lighter sound
to cross over to the pop charts.

757
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:29,057
It's what we need.

758
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:35,898
<i>What about what I need?</i>

759
00:45:36,607 --> 00:45:39,193
Curtis says it's the
best thing for the group.

760
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:44,114
<i>What about what's best for me?</i>

761
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:46,533
He feels The Dreams can cross over.

762
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,246
<i>What about how I feel?</i>

763
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,292
But when we're famous,
I'll write great things for you.

764
00:45:56,835 --> 00:45:59,338
Effie, do it for me.

765
00:46:00,214 --> 00:46:02,966
<i>What about me?</i>

766
00:46:03,842 --> 00:46:08,013
<i>What about me?</i>

767
00:46:11,558 --> 00:46:17,189
<i>It's more than you</i>

768
00:46:18,106 --> 00:46:21,902
<i>It is more than me</i>

769
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:25,155
<i>No matter what we are</i>

770
00:46:25,572 --> 00:46:28,909
<i>We are a family</i>

771
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:33,830
<i>This dream is for all of us</i>

772
00:46:34,957 --> 00:46:38,251
<i>This one can be real</i>

773
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:43,006
<i>And you can't stop us now</i>

774
00:46:43,256 --> 00:46:47,177
<i>Because of how you feel</i>

775
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:50,889
<i>It's more than you</i>

776
00:46:51,264 --> 00:46:56,186
<i>It is more than me</i>

777
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:59,356
<i>Whatever dreams we have</i>

778
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:03,694
<i>They're for the family</i>

779
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:07,280
<i>We're not alone anymore</i>

780
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:12,244
<i>Now there are others there</i>

781
00:47:13,245 --> 00:47:17,207
<i>And that dream is big enough</i>

782
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:21,294
<i>For all of us to share</i>

783
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,880
<i>So don't think you're going</i>

784
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:27,718
<i>You're not going anywhere</i>

785
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:32,055
<i>You're staying and taking your share</i>

786
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,809
<i>And if you get afraid again</i>

787
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,938
<i>I'll be there</i>

788
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:42,607
<i>We are a family</i>

789
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:46,069
<i>Like a giant tree</i>

790
00:47:46,194 --> 00:47:48,572
<i>Branching out toward the sky</i>

791
00:47:48,697 --> 00:47:51,199
<i>We are a family</i>

792
00:47:51,324 --> 00:47:54,619
<i>We are so much more</i>

793
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:57,164
<i>Than just you and I</i>

794
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,541
<i>We are a family</i>

795
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:01,918
<i>Like a giant tree</i>

796
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:06,757
<i>Growing stronger, growing wiser</i>

797
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:12,053
<i>We are growing</i>

798
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:14,473
<i>free</i>

799
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:18,018
<i>We need you</i>

800
00:48:20,353 --> 00:48:27,277
<i>We are a family</i>

801
00:48:44,794 --> 00:48:45,879
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

802
00:48:46,379 --> 00:48:48,882
<i>the Crystal Room is proud to present</i>

803
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:54,304
<i>the club debut of America's newest
recording stars, The Dreams!</i>

804
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:06,399
<i>Every man has his own special dream</i>

805
00:49:06,524 --> 00:49:09,945
<i>And your dream's
just about to come true</i>

806
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,697
<i>Life's not as bad as it may seem</i>

807
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:14,324
<i>If you open your eyes</i>

808
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:17,410
<i>To what's in front of you</i>

809
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:20,080
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

810
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:22,916
<i>Boys, we'll make you happy</i>

811
00:49:23,041 --> 00:49:24,209
<i>Yeah</i>

812
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:26,253
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

813
00:49:26,378 --> 00:49:30,840
<i>Boys, we'll always care</i>

814
00:49:30,966 --> 00:49:32,926
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

815
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:36,012
<i>Dream girls will never leave you</i>

816
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,847
<i>No, no</i>

817
00:49:37,973 --> 00:49:40,809
<i>And all you got to do is dream, baby</i>

818
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:43,311
<i>We'll be there</i>

819
00:49:44,729 --> 00:49:47,983
<i>Dream</i>

820
00:49:48,108 --> 00:49:51,361
<i>Dream girls will help you
through the night</i>

821
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:54,572
<i>Dream</i>

822
00:49:54,698 --> 00:49:57,993
<i>Dream girls will make you feel all right</i>

823
00:49:58,118 --> 00:50:00,870
<i>Dream girls keep you dreamin'

824
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:05,750
<i>Your dream girls can make

<i>Boys, we'll always...</i>

830
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:18,930
I'm amazed, Mr Taylor.
Much as I love my daughter,

831
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:21,057
I never thought
she had much of a voice.

832
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:24,269
Deena has something better.
She has a quality.

833
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:28,732
- You make her sound like a product.
- Product. I like that.

834
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:32,610
<i>We'll be there</i>

835
00:50:32,736 --> 00:50:36,072
<i>Dream</i>

836
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:39,367
<i>Dream girls will help you to survive</i>

837
00:50:39,492 --> 00:50:42,662
<i>Dream</i>

838
00:50:42,787 --> 00:50:45,999
<i>Dream girls will keep
your fantasies alive</i>

839
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:49,043
<i>Dream girls always love you
and they'll be true</i>

840
00:50:49,169 --> 00:50:52,797
<i>Your dream girl can only
make love to you</i>

841
00:50:52,922 --> 00:50:55,341
<i>I'm not the dream that you had before</i>

842
00:50:55,467 --> 00:51:02,140
<i>I'm the dream that will give you
more and more</i>

843
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:04,058
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

844
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:07,312
<i>Boys, we'll make you happy</i>

845
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:08,938
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

846
00:51:09,063 --> 00:51:10,440
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

847
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:15,236
<i>Boys, we'll always care</i>

848
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:17,447
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

849
00:51:17,572 --> 00:51:19,115
<i>Dream girls</i>

850
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,035
<i>Dream girls will never leave you</i>

851
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,538
<i>And all you got to do is dream</i>

852
00:51:25,663 --> 00:51:28,792
<i>All you got to do is dream</i>

853
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:32,754
<i>All you got to do is dream</i>

854
00:51:32,879 --> 00:51:36,966
<i>Baby, we'll be there</i>

855
00:51:37,091 --> 00:51:38,801
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

856
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:40,678

865
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:32,230
Who was the first one
to wear shiny clothes?

866
00:52:32,355 --> 00:52:35,650
- Little Richard.
- That was me, baby! I started that.

867
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:38,319
You remember that burgundy jacket
I had with the bolt lightning on the back?

868
00:52:38,444 --> 00:52:41,239
Lightning was in glitter.
Glitter's shiny, baby.

People ask me
how I came up with the sound.

876
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:07,557
I tell them it's like
making a great sundae.

877
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:10,059
You start out with two scoops
of ice cream, some sauce,

878
00:53:10,184 --> 00:53:13,896
- and then you put a cherry on top.
- And is Deena the cherry?

879
00:53:15,857 --> 00:53:19,068
Why, Miss Jones is the cherry,
the nuts, the sauce, the cream

880
00:53:19,193 --> 00:53:21,946
- and the banana, too.
- Miss Jones, right here.

You are still too loud.

- If you don't ease up, I'll do it for you.

894
00:54:13,414 --> 00:54:14,832
Maybe we should
just come back in the morning.

895
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:17,210
You know we can't.
The album's already a month late.

00:54:17,335 --> 00:54:18,961
Look, I know you're tired.
You're tired, right?

897
00:54:19,086 --> 00:54:20,546

- Okay.

898
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,131

- You're a liar, Curtis.

906
00:54:54,956 --> 00:54:55,957
You'd better watch your mouth.

907
00:54:56,082 --> 00:54:58,543

- Love me.

00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:45,728

Stay out of this, Lorrell.

01:00:00,094 --> 01:00:01,261

1017
01:00:35,504 --> 01:00:38,006
<i>I'm not building this group

01:00:55,023 --> 01:00:57,234
<i>Cool it, Effie</i>

1026
01:00:57,734 --> 01:00:59,319
<i>This time you know what you done</i>

1027
01:00:59,444 --> 01:01:01,113
So they bought
your black ass, too, huh?

1028
01:01:01,238 --> 01:01:03,448
<i>I said, cool it, Effie</i>

1029
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:05,659
<i>This time you've gone too far</i>

1030
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:07,411
Oh, I can go further! I can go further!

1031
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:10,539
<i>I don't want to stay around this</i>

1032
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:13,917
<i>I'm just breakin' into this business</i>

1033
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:16,712
<i>This is between all of you</i>

1034
01:01:17,212 --> 01:01:20,465
<i>- This is none of my affair
- Yeah?</i>

1035
01:01:20,591 --> 01:01:22,634
<i>Well, it's between you, too
Now, little sister</i>

1036
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:25,178
<i>This snow job is as much your sin</i>

1037
01:01:25,304 --> 01:01:28,181
<i>Look at me! Look at me!</i>

1038
01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:31,059
<i>How much did you put out to get in?</i>

1039
01:01:31,184 --> 01:01:34,646
<i>Now, you watch your mouth
Watch your mouth, Miss Effie White</i>

1040
01:01:34,771 --> 01:01:38,900
<i>'Cause I don't take that talk
from no second-rate diva</i>

1041
01:01:39,026 --> 01:01:40,485
<i>who can't sustain</i>

1042
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:43,947
<i>I'm not feeling well, I've got pain</i>

1043
01:01:44,072 --> 01:01:46,992
<i>Effie, we all got pain!</i>

1044
01:01:47,117 --> 01:01:51,079
<i>For seven years, I've sung with you
I was your sister</i>

1045
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:53,081
<i>You were our trouble</i>

1046
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:58,337
<i>And now you're telling me it's all over</i>

1047
01:01:59,171 --> 01:02:04,718
<i>And now we're telling you it's all over</i>

1048
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:09,222
<i>And now I'm telling you I ain't going</i>

1049
01:02:09,348 --> 01:02:10,849
<i>It's all over</i>

1050
01:02:10,974 --> 01:02:12,434
<i>I ain't going</i>

1051
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,979
<i>It's all over</i>

1052
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:28,325
<i>And I am telling you</i>

1053
01:02:29,409 --> 01:02:32,287
<i>I'm not going</i>

1054
01:02:34,164 --> 01:02:38,460
<i>You're the best man I'll ever know</i>

1055
01:02:38,585 --> 01:02:42,631
<i>There's no way I can ever go</i>

1056
01:02:42,756 --> 01:02:45,342
<i>No, no, there's no way</i>

1057
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:51,056
<i>No, no, no way I'm living without you</i>

1058
01:02:51,223 --> 01:02:55,227
<i>I'm not living without you</i>

1059
01:02:56,019 --> 01:03:00,482
<i>I don't want to be free</i>

1060
01:03:00,774 --> 01:03:04,403
<i>I'm staying, I'm staying</i>

1061
01:03:04,611 --> 01:03:07,280
<i>And you, and you</i>

1062
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:11,868
<i>You're gonna love me</i>

1063
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:20,168
<i>You're gonna love me</i>

1064
01:03:24,422 --> 01:03:28,385
<i>And I am telling you</i>

1065
01:03:28,844 --> 01:03:32,180
<i>I'm not going</i>

1066
01:03:32,305 --> 01:03:36,309
<i>Even though the rough times
are showing</i>

1067
01:03:36,434 --> 01:03:41,731
<i>There's just no way, there's no way</i>

1068
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:44,860
<i>We're part of the same place</i>

1069
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:49,114
<i>We're part of the same time</i>

1070
01:03:50,073 --> 01:03:53,326
<i>We both share the same blood</i>

1071
01:03:54,035 --> 01:03:57,330
<i>We both have the same mind</i>

1072
01:03:58,081 --> 01:04:03,545
<i>And time and time
We've had so much to share</i>

1073
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,673
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no way</i>

1074
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:09,885
<i>I'm not waking up tomorrow morning</i>

1075
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:15,140
<i>And finding that there's nobody there</i>

1076
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,642
<i>Darling, there's no way</i>

1077
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:23,398
<i>No, no, no, no way
I'm living without you</i>

1078
01:04:23,523 --> 01:04:26,234
<i>I'm not living without you</i>

1079
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:29,571
<i>You see, there's just no way</i>

1080
01:04:29,696 --> 01:04:32,449
<i>There's no way</i>

1081
01:04:32,574 --> 01:04:36,036
<i>Please don't go away from me</i>

1082
01:04:36,161 --> 01:04:39,915
<i>Stay with me, stay with me</i>

1083
01:04:40,457 --> 01:04:43,293
<i>Stay, stay and hold me</i>

1084
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,922
<i>Stay, stay and hold me</i>

1085
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:51,760
<i>Please stay and hold me, Mister Man</i>

1086
01:04:51,885 --> 01:04:55,221
<i>Try it, mister, try it, mister</i>

1087
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:58,808
<i>I know you can</i>

1088
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:04,564
<i>Tear down the mountain</i>

1089
01:05:04,689 --> 01:05:08,151
<i>Yell, scream and shout
You can say what you want</i>

1090
01:05:08,276 --> 01:05:10,737
<i>I'm not walking out</i>

1091
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:13,990
<i>Stop all the rivers
Push, strike and kill</i>

1092
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:16,242
<i>I'm not gonna leave you</i>

1093
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:23,291
<i>There's no way I will</i>

1094
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:30,799
<i>And I am telling you</i>

1095
01:05:31,716 --> 01:05:35,970
<i>I'm not going</i>

1096
01:05:36,096 --> 01:05:40,141
<i>You're the best man I'll ever know</i>

1097
01:05:40,266 --> 01:05:43,812
<i>There's no way I could ever, ever go</i>

1098
01:05:43,937 --> 01:05:46,356
<i>No, no, no, no way</i>

1099
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:48,566
<i>No, no, no, no way</i>

1100
01:05:48,692 --> 01:05:51,903
<i>I'm living without you</i>

1101
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:54,072
<i>I'm not living without you</i>

1102
01:05:54,197 --> 01:05:56,658
<i>Not living without you</i>

1103
01:05:56,783 --> 01:06:00,662
<i>I don't want to be free</i>

1104
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:03,957
<i>I'm staying, I'm staying</i>

1105
01:06:04,082 --> 01:06:07,335
<i>And you, and you, and you</i>

1106
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:11,089
<i>You're gonna love me</i>

1107
01:06:15,218 --> 01:06:18,263
<i>You're gonna love me</i>

1108
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:22,183
<i>Yes, you are
Yes, you are</i>

1109
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:26,438
<i>Love me!</i>

1110
01:06:26,896 --> 01:06:28,690
<i>Love me!</i>

1111
01:06:29,149 --> 01:06:31,192
<i>Love me!</i>

1112
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:38,241
<i>Love</i>

1113
01:06:41,578 --> 01:06:48,543
<i>You're gonna love</i>

1114
01:06:53,089 --> 01:07:00,013
<i>me</i>

1115
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:06,603
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the showroom
at Caesar's Palace is proud to present</i>

1116
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:09,063
<i>Deena Jones and The Dreams.</i>

1117
01:07:09,189 --> 01:07:11,357
<i>Love, love me, baby</i>

1118
01:07:11,608 --> 01:07:14,152
<i>Love, love me, child</i>

1119
01:07:14,277 --> 01:07:20,909
<i>'Cause baby, baby, baby
You're driving me wild</i>

1120
01:07:31,085 --> 01:07:32,837
<i>I'm somebody, somebody</i>

1121
01:07:32,962 --> 01:07:36,007
<i>And nobody's gonna hold me down</i>

1122
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:41,512
<i>No, nobody, nobody, nobody's
gonna hold me down</i>

1123
01:07:41,846 --> 01:07:43,222
<i>I'm somebody</i>

1124
01:07:43,348 --> 01:07:45,975
<i>It all started on the streets of Detroit,</i>

1125
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:49,646
<i>where three girls named
Deena, Lorrell and Michelle</i>

1126
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:53,775
<i>dreamed about one day
becoming singing stars.</i>

1127
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,444
<i>Since their triumphant Las Vegas debut,</i>

1128
01:07:56,569 --> 01:08:00,198
<i>they've had No. 1 albums
for each of the last six years.</i>

1129
01:08:00,323 --> 01:08:04,577
<i>And they're showing no signs
of slowing down anytime soon.</i>

1130
01:08:04,702 --> 01:08:07,914
<i>But for Deena Jones,
none of these exciting events compare</i>

1131
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:11,793
<i>to the day she
became Mrs Curtis Taylor, Jr.</i>

1132
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:16,798
<i>With his wife at his side,
Mr Taylor has built his music empire</i>

1133
01:08:16,923 --> 01:08:21,344
<i>into the most successful Afro-American
business in the United States,</i>

1134
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:25,723
<i>producing such sensations
as The Family Funk,</i>

1135
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:27,100
<i>Jimmy Early,</i>

1136
01:08:27,225 --> 01:08:30,478
<i>and the phenomenal
Campbell Connection.</i>

1137
01:08:30,603 --> 01:08:34,649
<i>Deena Jones has conquered
the worlds of music and television.</i>

1138
01:08:34,774 --> 01:08:38,194
<i>And soon, she hopes to take on
her biggest challenge yet,</i>

1139
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:42,073
<i>the epic, untold story
of Cleopatra's early years</i>

1140
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:45,326
<i>all set to the music of today.</i>

1141
01:08:46,577 --> 01:08:52,041
<i>No, nobody, nobody, nobody's
gonna hold me down</i>

1142
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:54,127
<i>I'm somebody</i>

1143
01:08:56,254 --> 01:08:57,547
Thank you.

1144
01:09:07,724 --> 01:09:10,268
- How's my beautiful wife?
- Curtis.

1145
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,021
- I'm not sure how to tell you this.
- Tell me what? Just say it.

1146
01:09:14,147 --> 01:09:16,858
I know how much time
you've invested in this movie.

1147
01:09:17,775 --> 01:09:21,362
But I can't play that part.

1148
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:24,407
I promised you I was gonna
make you a movie star, right?

1149
01:09:24,532 --> 01:09:26,033
<i>Cleopatra is gonna get us there.</i>

1150
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:29,036
I mean, this is the queen of a nation,
not some hooker, junkie, maid.

1151
01:09:29,162 --> 01:09:31,456
I know. I know.
It's a very important story.

1152
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:32,915
And it's more than you.

1153
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,835
Think about all the beautiful black
women that ain't even born yet.

1154
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,212
When they grow up they're gonna say,
"I can play any part I want to.

1155
01:09:38,337 --> 01:09:40,339
"Look at Deena Jones. She did it."

1156
01:09:40,465 --> 01:09:42,884
But it's ridiculous. Come on.

1157
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:45,386
She's 16 years old
for most of the movie.

1158
01:09:45,511 --> 01:09:47,972
Well, baby, you'll always be 16 to me.

1159
01:09:49,056 --> 01:09:50,600
Maybe that's the problem.

1160
01:09:50,725 --> 01:09:53,352
Maybe you just don't see me
for who I am.

1161
01:09:58,357 --> 01:10:01,360
<i>When I first saw you</i>

1162
01:10:03,362 --> 01:10:06,073
<i>I said, "Oh, my"</i>

1163
01:10:07,158 --> 01:10:12,788
<i>I said, "Oh, my, that's a dream</i>

1164
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:15,625
<i>"That's my dream"</i>

1165
01:10:16,083 --> 01:10:18,586
<i>I needed a dream</i>

1166
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:23,424
<i>When it all seemed to go bad</i>

1167
01:10:23,549 --> 01:10:26,427
<i>Then I found you</i>

1168
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:32,433
<i>And I have had the most
beautiful dreams</i>

1169
01:10:32,642 --> 01:10:36,854
<i>Any man's ever had</i>

1170
01:10:37,063 --> 01:10:40,107
<i>When I first saw you</i>

1171
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:44,403
<i>I said, "Oh, my</i>

1172
01:10:44,737 --> 01:10:49,450
<i>"Oh, my, that's my dream</i>

1173
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:52,954
<i>"That's my dream"</i>

1174
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:59,460
<i>I needed a dream to make me strong</i>

1175
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:06,968
<i>You were the only reason I had to go on</i>

1176
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:12,223
<i>You are my dream</i>

1177
01:11:12,556 --> 01:11:17,395
<i>All the things I never knew</i>

1178
01:11:17,645 --> 01:11:19,689
<i>You are my dream</i>

1179
01:11:19,814 --> 01:11:24,735
<i>Who could believe
they could ever come true?</i>

1180
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,071
<i>And who would believe</i>

1181
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:32,785
<i>the world would believe
in my dreams, too?</i>

1182
01:11:38,499 --> 01:11:42,003
<i>When I first saw you</i>

1183
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:46,173
<i>I said, "Oh, my</i>

1184
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:49,802
<i>"Oh, my</i>

1185
01:11:52,888 --> 01:11:59,812
<i>"That's my dream"</i>

1186
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:19,415
- What would make you happy, Deena?
- You know.

1187
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,709
We got plenty of time for that.

1188
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:25,171
Please, Curtis. Let me have your child.

1189
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,890
- Magic, read your book.
- I'm done.

1190
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:38,058
Then read it again!

1191
01:12:39,226 --> 01:12:42,021
Did you look for work this week,
Miss White?

1192
01:12:42,438 --> 01:12:45,316
Mister, you can keep
asking me that question.

1193
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:48,152
But the answer's always
gonna be the same.

1194
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:49,904
The only thing I know how to do is sing.

1195
01:12:50,029 --> 01:12:52,239
And since there ain't nobody
letting me do that no more,

1196
01:12:52,364 --> 01:12:54,492
no, I did not look for a job.

1197
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,163
Have you considered asking
the girl's father for help?

1198
01:13:00,289 --> 01:13:02,082
Magic don't have a father.

1199
01:13:12,051 --> 01:13:13,802
Listen.

1200
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:17,556
<i>I know you have questions</i>

1201
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:20,476
<i>Same ones as me</i>

1202
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:25,606
<i>How long has it been?
How long will it be?</i>

1203
01:13:26,357 --> 01:13:31,528
<i>When will come the morning
to drive the night away?</i>

1204
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:37,493
<i>Tell me, when will come the morning
of a brighter day?</i>

1205
01:13:37,743 --> 01:13:39,954
<i>Yeah</i>

1206
01:13:40,704 --> 01:13:45,626
<i>Patience, little sister</i>

1207
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:50,965
<i>Patience, little brother</i>

1208
01:13:52,091 --> 01:13:55,678
<i>Patience, patience, yeah</i>

1209
01:13:56,637 --> 01:13:59,348
<i>Take each other by the hand</i>

1210
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,685
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1211
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:08,148
<i>Patience, little sisters</i>

1212
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:11,402
<i>Patience...</i>

1213
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:14,947
- It's from your brother.
- Send it back.

1214
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:17,992
- There's cash in here.
- You spend it.

1215
01:14:18,283 --> 01:14:20,160
Effie White, you are a mule.

1216
01:14:20,285 --> 01:14:22,663
Come on, baby, it's time to go to bed.

1217
01:14:22,788 --> 01:14:24,999
Just as stubborn as your mother.

1218
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:27,418
Go home, old man.

1219
01:14:28,544 --> 01:14:29,878
Magic, come on, baby.

1220
01:14:32,006 --> 01:14:36,593
<i>And a mountain to climb</i>

1221
01:14:37,803 --> 01:14:41,515
<i>Patience, patience</i>

1222
01:14:42,433 --> 01:14:45,185
<i>It's gonna take some time</i>

1223
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:47,396
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1224
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:52,943
<i>We must walk in peace</i>

1225
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:54,403
<i>We got to walk in peace</i>

1226
01:14:54,528 --> 01:14:56,697
<i>It's the only</i>

1227
01:14:56,822 --> 01:15:00,159
<i>Only way, yes</i>

1228
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:04,329
<i>If we want to see that morning, yeah</i>

1229
01:15:05,581 --> 01:15:07,249
<i>Of a brighter day</i>

1230
01:15:12,171 --> 01:15:13,797
<i>Patience</i>

1231
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:14,923
<i>Come on!</i>

1232
01:15:15,048 --> 01:15:16,508
<i>Little sister</i>

1233
01:15:17,885 --> 01:15:19,386
<i>Patience</i>

1234
01:15:20,387 --> 01:15:21,764
<i>Little brother</i>

1235
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:27,561
<i>Patience, patience, yeah</i>

1236
01:15:28,228 --> 01:15:30,397
<i>I'm gonna find a way</i>

1237
01:15:31,857 --> 01:15:33,650
Nice to see you, Effie.

1238
01:15:35,027 --> 01:15:37,112
<i>Patience</i>

1239
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:39,323
<i>Little sister</i>

1240
01:15:40,783 --> 01:15:42,284
<i>Patience</i>

1241
01:15:42,868 --> 01:15:44,578
<i>Little brother</i>

1242
01:15:44,703 --> 01:15:48,415
- Teddy, get yourself back to the party.
- I'm waiting for Deena.

1243
01:16:08,852 --> 01:16:12,064
It's good. It's real good.

1244
01:16:12,272 --> 01:16:13,524
We wanted to surprise you, Curtis.

1245
01:16:13,649 --> 01:16:15,776
That's why we went ahead
and recorded it first.

1246
01:16:15,901 --> 01:16:17,778
This is exactly what I need
right now, Curtis.

1247
01:16:17,903 --> 01:16:20,739
It's what you've been always
talking about to me, a new sound!

1248
01:16:20,864 --> 01:16:22,699
Still, it's a message song.

1249
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:28,872
It tells the truth.
People are angry out there.

1250
01:16:28,997 --> 01:16:30,290
I'm angry.

1251
01:16:30,415 --> 01:16:32,960
My brother's over in Vietnam
fighting in a pointless war,

1252
01:16:33,085 --> 01:16:34,795
and I'm angry about it.

1253
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,171
That's right, Curtis.

1254
01:16:36,296 --> 01:16:38,590
Isn't music supposed to express
what people are feeling?

1255
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:40,342
Music is supposed to sell.

1256
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,974
Look, don't worry about it, Jimmy.
We'll find you some new material.

1257
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:49,226
Deena, I want you to meet this guy
out here.

1258
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:53,772
And about the shirt, you should lose it.
It's messing up your image.

1259
01:16:58,485 --> 01:17:00,362
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

1260
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,533
Deena.

1261
01:17:21,842 --> 01:17:25,345
Honey, you don't need to be
doing that stuff right now.

1262
01:17:27,347 --> 01:17:29,683
Come on, brother. It's Christmas.

1263
01:17:30,892 --> 01:17:32,894
Jimmy? Baby?

1264
01:17:43,989 --> 01:17:45,991
I'm not staying around for this.

1265
01:17:52,456 --> 01:17:53,665
Brother...

1266
01:18:22,069 --> 01:18:24,821
Yeah, but what about Holiday?

1267
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:29,576
I had Billie here every winter
from '42 to '58.

1268
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:31,787
Great voice. Bad tipper.

1269
01:18:35,457 --> 01:18:40,504
Well, I tell you, Effie White is the best
singer this town has seen since then.

1270
01:18:40,629 --> 01:18:43,507
Yeah, but the last time she performed,
the girl fell apart.

1271
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:45,008
That was years ago.

1272
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:48,887
She just lost her confidence for a while.
She's different now.

1273
01:18:54,684 --> 01:18:57,646
Max, please. For the old days?

1274
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:00,982
They're gone, Marty.

1275
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:07,280
Sorry, Marty, but the babysitter was late.

1276
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:12,160
Effie White, this is Max Washington.

1277
01:19:12,285 --> 01:19:14,788
Hi, Max.
Marty said you needed a singer.

1278
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:19,292
I was just telling Max
that you're serious about working.

1279
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:21,545
He knows all about you.

1280
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:24,673
You do, huh?
Daddy, you don't know the half.

1281
01:19:24,798 --> 01:19:27,634
One night after you hire me,
we'll sit down and I'll tell you

1282
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:31,221
all about how I blew through
half a million dollars in two years!

1283
01:19:31,346 --> 01:19:33,014
- Hey, come on.
- Drinking.

1284
01:19:33,515 --> 01:19:35,767
You don't want to take up too much
of the man's time.

1285
01:19:35,892 --> 01:19:39,938
- Now, Carl knows all the songs.
- Carl? Where's Bernard?

1286
01:19:40,105 --> 01:19:41,147
He has a job in Evanston.

1287
01:19:41,273 --> 01:19:42,983
But I can't sing
with someone I don't know.

1288
01:19:43,108 --> 01:19:45,193
Effie. You got to.

1289
01:19:45,318 --> 01:19:48,196
Marty, I don't have the time.

1290
01:19:49,322 --> 01:19:51,575
Max, please. Just give me a minute.

1291
01:19:55,954 --> 01:20:00,125
Now, you listen, Effie White.
For four months, I've been your money.

1292
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,043
I've taken you to every club
in this freezing town,

1293
01:20:02,168 --> 01:20:04,588
and I'm telling you that this is it.

1294
01:20:04,713 --> 01:20:09,467
It's time that you stop making excuses
so that you don't have to prove anything.

1295
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:13,596
You're gonna have to start proving it,
just like the rest of us.

1296
01:20:14,097 --> 01:20:16,891
I don't know.
Maybe Curtis was right about you.

1297
01:20:17,475 --> 01:20:20,645
You want all of the privileges
but none of the responsibilities.

1298
01:20:21,771 --> 01:20:24,983
Hey, Max. Thanks anyway, man.
Sorry for wasting your time.

1299
01:20:25,108 --> 01:20:26,943
Do you know the song?

1300
01:20:27,193 --> 01:20:29,154
I told you I didn't want to see her.

1301
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,450
Well, you are, mister. You are.

1302
01:20:36,077 --> 01:20:38,163
<i>Look at me</i>

1303
01:20:38,705 --> 01:20:42,834
<i>Look at me</i>

1304
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:51,009
<i>I am changing</i>

1305
01:20:53,219 --> 01:20:56,306
<i>Trying every way I can</i>

1306
01:20:56,431 --> 01:21:01,353
<i>I am changing</i>

1307
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:05,190
<i>I'll be better than I am</i>

1308
01:21:06,024 --> 01:21:09,444
<i>I'm hoping</i>

1309
01:21:09,569 --> 01:21:11,571
<i>To work it out</i>

1310
01:21:11,696 --> 01:21:15,950
<i>And I know that I can</i>

1311
01:21:16,076 --> 01:21:18,870
<i>But I need you</i>

1312
01:21:18,995 --> 01:21:24,584
<i>I need a hand</i>

1313
01:21:25,251 --> 01:21:29,380
<i>All of my life, I've been a fool</i>

1314
01:21:29,506 --> 01:21:32,801
<i>who said I could do it all alone</i>

1315
01:21:34,052 --> 01:21:37,555
<i>How many good friends
have I already lost?</i>

1316
01:21:38,264 --> 01:21:41,726
<i>And how many dark nights
have I known?</i>

1317
01:21:42,936 --> 01:21:47,107
<i>Walking down that wrong road</i>

1318
01:21:47,232 --> 01:21:50,944
<i>There was nothing I could find</i>

1319
01:21:51,319 --> 01:21:55,782
<i>All those years of darkness</i>

1320
01:21:56,074 --> 01:21:59,244
<i>Could make a person blind</i>

1321
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:05,750
<i>But now I can see I am changing</i>

1322
01:22:07,377 --> 01:22:10,296
<i>Trying every way I can</i>

1323
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:14,968
<i>I am changing</i>

1324
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:19,097
<i>And I'll be better than I am</i>

1325
01:22:20,223 --> 01:22:24,185
<i>But I need a friend</i>

1326
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:29,774
<i>To help me start all over again</i>

1327
01:22:30,775 --> 01:22:34,654
<i>That would be just fine</i>

1328
01:22:35,029 --> 01:22:39,033
<i>I know it's gonna work out this time</i>

1329
01:22:39,742 --> 01:22:43,746
<i>'Cause this time I am</i>

1330
01:22:44,038 --> 01:22:49,377
<i>This time I am</i>

1331
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:58,344
<i>I am changing</i>

1332
01:22:59,512 --> 01:23:02,807
<i>I'll get my life together now</i>

1333
01:23:02,932 --> 01:23:08,313
<i>I am changing</i>

1334
01:23:08,855 --> 01:23:09,897
<i>Yes!</i>

1335
01:23:10,023 --> 01:23:15,361
<i>I know how I'm gonna start again</i>

1336
01:23:16,988 --> 01:23:21,743
<i>I'm gonna leave my past behind</i>

1337
01:23:22,368 --> 01:23:23,995
Right, baby! Sing it loud!

1338
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,833
<i>I'll change my life</i>

1339
01:23:30,627 --> 01:23:34,255
<i>I'll make a vow</i>

1340
01:23:34,464 --> 01:23:41,387
<i>Nothing's gonna stop me</i>

1341
01:23:44,015 --> 01:23:50,938
<i>now</i>

1342
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,951
<i>Tonight, live from the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion in Los Angeles, California,</i>

1343
01:24:04,077 --> 01:24:06,996
<i>it's The Sound of Tomorrow,</i>

1344
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:10,917
<i>celebrating 10 years of hits
from Rainbow Records.</i>

1345
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:13,795
<i>Every day at school, girl</i>

1346
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,297
<i>I see your smiling face</i>

1347
01:24:16,422 --> 01:24:18,633
<i>The teacher tries to call on me</i>

1348
01:24:18,758 --> 01:24:20,510
<i>But I can't concentrate</i>

1349
01:24:20,635 --> 01:24:22,637
Come on, Jimmy, drink this.

1350
01:24:24,347 --> 01:24:27,266
- Five minutes, Mr Early.
- Yeah, all right.

1351
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,021
I thought you were going
to stay clean tonight, baby.

1352
01:24:32,146 --> 01:24:33,940
You know how important this is.

1353
01:24:34,065 --> 01:24:37,276
Yeah, I was doing fine, too, till Melba
came out and messed with me.

1354
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:39,570
All that, "You never take me nowhere,"

1355
01:24:39,695 --> 01:24:42,990
and, "I'm tired of staying in the house
night after night," shit.

1356
01:24:43,116 --> 01:24:46,410
Next thing I know, she's coming
down the stairs in her party dress.

1357
01:24:48,496 --> 01:24:50,248
Wait a minute.

1358
01:24:50,373 --> 01:24:55,044
Are you telling me that your wife is
out there right now?

1359
01:24:55,169 --> 01:24:58,798
What was I supposed to do, baby?
That's why I needed to relax.

1360
01:25:00,633 --> 01:25:04,971
- Here, sugar, have a drink.
- Yeah, help me out here. I'm frazzled.

1361
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,351
You know,
it's our anniversary, too, baby.

1362
01:25:10,476 --> 01:25:12,103
Don't you remember?

1363
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:17,400
- Yeah, I remember that.
- Let me give you a kiss for each year.

1364
01:25:18,192 --> 01:25:19,777
That's sweet.

1365
01:25:20,069 --> 01:25:24,657
One, two, three,

1366
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:29,662
four, five, six,

1367
01:25:30,246 --> 01:25:33,124
seven, eight.

1368
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:41,591
Eight years of unmarried life.

1369
01:25:42,008 --> 01:25:45,636
Hey, come on, now. Don't tell me
we're going to start this shit again.

1370
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:47,513
We'll deal with this
after the show, all right?

1371
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:50,016
Don't you walk out on me, Jimmy Early!

1372
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:52,351
<i>Girl meets boy, boy meets girl</i>

1373
01:25:52,476 --> 01:25:54,645
<i>Fall in love, perfect world</i>

1374
01:25:54,770 --> 01:25:57,023
<i>But if boy and girl never meet</i>

1375
01:25:57,148 --> 01:25:59,859
<i>Then a perfect world can never be</i>

1376
01:25:59,984 --> 01:26:03,613
<i>Come on, girl, I love you!</i>

1377
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:09,201
- I'm going to tell her, baby, I promise!
- But when, Jimmy? When?

1378
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:10,870
Please, I just need
a little more time, all right?

1379
01:26:10,995 --> 01:26:13,831
Time's run out, Jimmy. I get it now.

1380
01:26:13,956 --> 01:26:17,877
- What you talking about?
- You never really loved me.

1381
01:26:18,002 --> 01:26:21,130
Lorrell. Baby, you know I love you.

1382
01:26:21,631 --> 01:26:25,051
I do. But right now, I got a show to do.

1383
01:26:26,302 --> 01:26:29,388
<i>... three, two...</i>

1384
01:26:29,847 --> 01:26:33,893
<i>And now, the mellow sounds
of Jimmy Early.</i>

1385
01:26:41,776 --> 01:26:45,571
<i>I meant you no harm</i>

1386
01:26:46,906 --> 01:26:50,910
<i>I never meant to make you cry</i>

1387
01:26:51,035 --> 01:26:57,041
<i>You were the only one
I've ever loved in my life</i>

1388
01:26:57,416 --> 01:27:01,587
<i>And though it's hard for me to show it</i>

1389
01:27:02,129 --> 01:27:05,174
<i>I've got to let you know it</i>

1390
01:27:06,008 --> 01:27:10,096
<i>'Cause, darling
I love you more each day</i>

1391
01:27:10,596 --> 01:27:13,224
<i>But the words got in my way</i>

1392
01:27:13,349 --> 01:27:17,937
<i>Oh, I meant you no harm</i>

1393
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,483
<i>And I would die</i>

1394
01:27:23,484 --> 01:27:26,195
<i>If you ever said goodbye</i>

1395
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:30,074
<i>I love you
I love you</i>

1396
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:32,284
Hey, hold it.

1397
01:27:32,743 --> 01:27:35,538
I can't do it no more.
I can't sing no more sad songs.

1398
01:27:35,538 --> 01:27:35,955
I can't do it no more.
I can't sing no more sad songs.

1399
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,082
Hey, Curtis, this is supposed to be
your night, right?

1400
01:27:38,207 --> 01:27:40,292
Let's have some happy times.
Right, I'm gonna give you a count-off.

1401
01:27:40,418 --> 01:27:42,044
The rest of you all come in
when I tell you, all right?

1402
01:27:42,169 --> 01:27:43,170
What the hell's he doing?

1403
01:27:43,295 --> 01:27:45,381
One! Two! Three! Hit me!

1404
01:27:49,009 --> 01:27:54,640
Bass man, come on up!
One! Two! Three! Hit me!

1405
01:27:56,183 --> 01:28:00,187
Sound good! Yeah! Saxophone!
On the four!

1406
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:03,190
One! Two! Three! Hit it!

1407
01:28:10,114 --> 01:28:12,950
Come on! Horns! Hit it!

1408
01:28:21,584 --> 01:28:23,460
<i>Hey, Curly, let's rap with Jimmy Early</i>

1409
01:28:23,586 --> 01:28:26,964
<i>Got a home in the hills
Mercedes-Benz, hot swimming pool</i>

1410
01:28:27,089 --> 01:28:28,382
<i>Got lots of friends</i>

1411
01:28:28,507 --> 01:28:30,259
<i>Got clothes by the acre
Credit to spare</i>

1412
01:28:30,384 --> 01:28:32,845
<i>I could wake up tomorrow
and find nobody there</i>

1413
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,264
<i>But Jimmy want more
Jimmy want more</i>

1414
01:28:35,389 --> 01:28:38,142
<i>Jimmy want, Jimmy want
Jimmy want more!</i>

1415
01:28:41,186 --> 01:28:42,187
<i>Listen!</i>

1416
01:28:42,313 --> 01:28:44,398
<i>Jimmy want a rib
Jimmy want a steak</i>

1417
01:28:44,523 --> 01:28:46,525
<i>Jimmy want a piece
of your chocolate cake</i>

1418
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:48,527
<i>But more than all that
Jimmy wants a break</i>

1419
01:28:48,652 --> 01:28:51,322
<i>'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul</i>

1420
01:28:51,447 --> 01:28:53,616
<i>Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul!</i>

1421
01:28:58,203 --> 01:29:00,205
<i>Sooner or later, the time comes around</i>

1422
01:29:00,331 --> 01:29:02,708
<i>For a man to be a man
Take back his sound</i>

1423
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:05,002
<i>I gotta do somethin' to shake things up</i>

1424
01:29:05,127 --> 01:29:07,212
<i>I like Johnny Mathis
But I can't do that stuff</i>

1425
01:29:07,338 --> 01:29:09,673
<i>'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul</i>

1426
01:29:09,798 --> 01:29:12,676
<i>Jimmy got S-O-U-L soul!</i>

1427
01:29:18,766 --> 01:29:20,809
<i>I can't do rock, I can't do roll</i>

1428
01:29:20,935 --> 01:29:23,354
<i>What I can do, baby, is show my soul</i>

1429
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:25,648
<i>'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul</i>

1430
01:29:25,773 --> 01:29:29,068
<i>Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul!</i>

1431
01:29:29,193 --> 01:29:30,319
Take it out.

1432
01:29:43,957 --> 01:29:46,585
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay in your seats.</i>

1433
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:48,420
<i>We're back live in two minutes.</i>

1434
01:29:48,879 --> 01:29:52,424
- What'd you think of my show, baby?
- You made a fool out of yourself.

1435
01:29:52,549 --> 01:29:54,718
What are you talking about, man?
I was just being Jimmy.

1436
01:29:54,843 --> 01:29:57,179
Lorrell, will you please tell him,
if you can?

1437
01:29:57,304 --> 01:30:00,808
Jimmy keeps begging you for something
new, but all you do is ignore him.

1438
01:30:00,933 --> 01:30:02,685
Of course he's confused.

1439
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:06,814
It don't take a whiz to know that only
a desperate man would drop his pants

1440
01:30:06,939 --> 01:30:09,483
in living colour on network television.

1441
01:30:09,608 --> 01:30:10,901
Thanks, Lorrell. You told it like it is.

1442
01:30:11,026 --> 01:30:13,946
Yeah, well, that ain't all
I got to say to you, sugar.

1443
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:15,656
My brother, we're through.

1444
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:17,574
What you talking about?
What do you mean, we're through?

1445
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,159
Come on, Jimmy, your time has passed.

1446
01:30:19,284 --> 01:30:21,912
Hey, man, I got soul!
You can't kill a man with soul!

1447
01:30:22,037 --> 01:30:23,956
Come on, man.
Let's at least end as friends, man.

1448
01:30:24,081 --> 01:30:26,458
If you ever need some help,
just give me a call.

1449
01:30:30,462 --> 01:30:31,922
Whatever.

1450
01:30:32,673 --> 01:30:36,635
Hey, Curtis, I don't beg! I don't crawl!
I'm an original!

1451
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:40,514
Hey, where are you going?
You can't leave me, girl. I love you.

1452
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:47,813
<i>And Lorrell loves Jimmy</i>

1453
01:30:49,606 --> 01:30:54,486
<i>Lorrell loves Jimmy</i>

1454
01:30:56,864 --> 01:31:01,535
<i>Lorrell loves Jimmy</i>

1455
01:31:01,660 --> 01:31:05,998
<i>It's true</i>

1456
01:31:07,207 --> 01:31:14,131
<i>But Lorrell and Jimmy</i>

1457
01:31:14,464 --> 01:31:20,179
<i>are through</i>

1458
01:31:20,679 --> 01:31:24,516
I got a show to do.
Don't you remember, baby?

1459
01:31:29,271 --> 01:31:33,567
<i>And now, please welcome the brightest
star in the Rainbow constellation,</i>

1460
01:31:33,692 --> 01:31:36,737
<i>Deena Jones
with the incredible Dreams!</i>

1461
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:51,084
Hello, America.

1462
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:53,545
What a wonderful evening.

1463
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:55,964
- I love you all.
- I love you, Deena!

1464
01:31:56,089 --> 01:32:00,636
I love you, too.
Curtis, baby, this is for you.

1465
01:32:00,761 --> 01:32:05,057
<i>We are a family, like a giant tree</i>

1466
01:32:05,182 --> 01:32:07,142
<i>Branching out toward the sky</i>

1467
01:32:07,267 --> 01:32:09,061
<i>We are a family</i>

1468
01:32:09,186 --> 01:32:12,230
<i>We are so much more
More than just you and I</i>

1469
01:32:12,356 --> 01:32:14,232
Time to go, Mr Early.

1470
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:21,323
<i>We are growing free</i>

1471
01:32:22,824 --> 01:32:24,242
Yeah!

1472
01:32:42,803 --> 01:32:44,763
You're an incredibly beautiful woman.

1473
01:32:45,597 --> 01:32:48,767
- Thank you, Jerry.
- No, you're too beautiful.

1474
01:32:48,892 --> 01:32:53,355
This movie is about three grifters
heading to Vegas for one final score.

1475
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,108
When Dawn goes down on
that truck driver,

1476
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:58,777
you've got to smell the desperation.

1477
01:32:58,902 --> 01:33:00,862
I know that. That's what I love about her.

1478
01:33:00,987 --> 01:33:03,490
There's no pretence.
No fucking bullshit.

1479
01:33:05,659 --> 01:33:08,370
America's sweetheart here
has got a potty mouth.

1480
01:33:10,122 --> 01:33:13,959
Of course, if I were to become involved,
we have to do a little work on the part.

1481
01:33:14,376 --> 01:33:17,713
What do you mean?
I spent a year on the script, so...

1482
01:33:19,131 --> 01:33:22,259
I know, and it's good.
But she's not real yet.

1483
01:33:22,384 --> 01:33:24,886
To start with,
what kind of name is Dawn?

1484
01:33:25,011 --> 01:33:28,014
I'm from the projects in Detroit and
I ain't ever met a sister named Dawn.

1485
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:31,727
Well, the script's just a blueprint.
It's not written in stone.

1486
01:33:31,852 --> 01:33:36,273
<i>I hear Curtis is still trying to get
that crazy black Cleopatra made.</i>

1487
01:33:36,398 --> 01:33:39,651
Is it true he's got some
mob money tied up in this?

1488
01:33:41,027 --> 01:33:43,822
My husband has his hands full
with the music side right now.

1489
01:33:43,947 --> 01:33:46,491
That's why I didn't want to bother him
with our meeting today.

1490
01:33:50,245 --> 01:33:52,873
So, say we do decide
to get in bed with you on this,

1491
01:33:52,998 --> 01:33:55,208
will Curtis even let you do it?

1492
01:33:55,625 --> 01:33:58,003
I hear he's got you
on a pretty tight leash.

1493
01:33:58,128 --> 01:33:59,796
That won't be a problem, Jerry.

1494
01:34:03,467 --> 01:34:05,635
<i>Step, step, step on over</i>

1495
01:34:06,928 --> 01:34:09,097
<i>Step, step, step on over</i>

1496
01:34:10,390 --> 01:34:12,142
<i>Wanting you, wanting you</i>

1497
01:34:12,267 --> 01:34:14,060
<i>Needing you, needing you</i>

1498
01:34:14,895 --> 01:34:15,937
Shit.

1499
01:34:19,441 --> 01:34:22,402
- Hey.
- I didn't think it was possible, Curtis.

1500
01:34:22,527 --> 01:34:25,405
But I think you can squeeze
even more of the soul out of my music.

1501
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,866
- We just made it danceable, that's all.
- What about the lyrics?

1502
01:34:27,991 --> 01:34:29,951
That rhythm takes all the feeling
out of the music!

1503
01:34:30,118 --> 01:34:32,495
This is what you've been asking for.
A totally new sound.

1504
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:34,789
It's gonna be bigger than R&B
and rock and roll put together!

1505
01:34:34,915 --> 01:34:36,041
People are getting ready to boogie,

1506
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:38,335
and when they do
they're gonna do it to our music.

1507
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:41,463
Your music, Curtis.
It has nothing to do with me.

1508
01:34:41,755 --> 01:34:43,215
Come on, brother,
you know you're my main man.

1509
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:44,758
Kiss my ass,

1510
01:34:45,175 --> 01:34:46,301
brother.

1511
01:34:52,098 --> 01:34:54,226
What the hell is going on now?

1512
01:34:59,522 --> 01:35:01,024
No, no!

1513
01:35:04,277 --> 01:35:07,364
<i>The body was found at the
Tropicana Hotel in Hollywood.</i>

1514
01:35:07,489 --> 01:35:10,575
<i>Police say Mr Early had been dead

1518
01:35:19,793 --> 01:35:22,712
She won't let me see him, Deena.

1519
01:35:23,922 --> 01:35:27,884
She won't let me see my Jimmy.

1520
01:35:28,593 --> 01:35:31,096
<i>Plans are being made to fly the body
back to Detroit</i>

1521
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:32,430
<i>where there will be a private burial.</i>

1522
01:35:32,555 --> 01:35:33,932
What a thing.

1523
01:35:34,683 --> 01:35:36,142
Bad, bad scene.

1524
01:35:37,477 --> 01:35:40,397
Well, thanks for the drink.

1525
01:35:42,148 --> 01:35:44,442
Tell Lorrell I'll stop by tomorrow.

1526
01:35:44,567 --> 01:35:47,570
C.C., man, no matter what troubles
we had, you know, we're still a family.

1527
01:35:47,696 --> 01:35:49,406
That's the most important thing.

1528
01:35:50,657 --> 01:35:51,992
It's over, Curtis.

1529
01:35:52,117 --> 01:35:55,286
Oh, come on, man. Jimmy did this
to himself. You know that.

1530
01:35:57,664 --> 01:35:59,082
Michelle?

1531
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,960
C.C. Can quit. You can't.

1532
01:36:22,772 --> 01:36:24,482
What's a wake?

1533
01:36:24,607 --> 01:36:28,486
It's when friends get together
and share their love for someone.

1534
01:36:28,737 --> 01:36:33,825
- Mama, why are you so slow?
- 'Cause I'm old, baby. I'm old.

1535
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:43,793
Who are you?

1536
01:36:47,046 --> 01:36:48,423
Effie!

1537
01:36:49,174 --> 01:36:50,258
Effie!

1538
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:55,513
- Who's that man?
- That's your uncle, little girl.

1539
01:36:58,391 --> 01:37:00,185
Effie! Shit.

1540
01:37:05,231 --> 01:37:07,734
Jimmy had so much life.

1541
01:37:08,568 --> 01:37:11,654
First time I met him
was right here in this club.

1542
01:37:11,779 --> 01:37:15,575
He wasn't "Thunder" Early then,
just little Jimmy.

1543
01:37:16,534 --> 01:37:21,122
- How old was that boy, Marty?
- I don't know. Probably 12.

1544
01:37:21,247 --> 01:37:25,418
Well, he had hands
the size of a fellow twice his age,

1545
01:37:25,585 --> 01:37:27,879
and he wasn't shy
about using them either.

1546
01:37:28,004 --> 01:37:30,381
Yeah, Jimmy was a real little shit.

1547
01:37:30,924 --> 01:37:32,884
- A real little shit.
- Shit.

1548
01:37:35,929 --> 01:37:40,558
<i>I miss you, old friend</i>

1549
01:37:40,934 --> 01:37:43,102
<i>Can I hold you?</i>

1550
01:37:43,645 --> 01:37:48,566
<i>And though it's been a long time
Old friend</i>

1551
01:37:48,691 --> 01:37:51,903
<i>Do you mind?</i>

1552
01:37:52,445 --> 01:37:57,075
<i>There were so many things</i>

1553
01:37:58,117 --> 01:38:01,746
<i>I wish I had said</i>

1554
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:06,084
<i>I meant to love you</i>

1555
01:38:06,918 --> 01:38:10,505
<i>But I hurt you instead</i>

1556
01:38:11,381 --> 01:38:14,592
<i>I've come here now</i>

1557
01:38:16,511 --> 01:38:19,264
<i>To make amends</i>

1558
01:38:19,389 --> 01:38:22,767
<i>Can I sit down beside you?</i>

1559
01:38:23,142 --> 01:38:27,939
<i>Can we be close again?</i>

1560
01:38:33,945 --> 01:38:35,613
Effie?

1561
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,199
Effie, I'm your brother.
At least you can say hello.

1562
01:38:38,324 --> 01:38:42,620
What gives you the nerve, C.C.,
coming here after all of these years?

1563
01:38:42,745 --> 01:38:44,956
All I can say is I was young
and I made a mistake.

1564
01:38:45,081 --> 01:38:49,794
I won't be used. Not by you,
not by anybody. Never again.

1565
01:38:49,919 --> 01:38:54,257
I promised you I would write you
a hit song. Let me do it for you now.

1566
01:38:54,465 --> 01:38:56,259
I don't need you.

1567
01:38:57,468 --> 01:38:59,512
No, Effie, I need you.

1568
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:05,435
Effie, I have a song and it's good.
It's really good.

1569
01:39:06,602 --> 01:39:08,563
But only if you sing it.

1570
01:39:21,117 --> 01:39:27,999
<i>You want all my love and my devotion</i>

1571
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,256
<i>You want my loving soul</i>

1572
01:39:35,381 --> 01:39:41,012
<i>Right on the line</i>

1573
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:44,974
<i>I have no doubt</i>

1574
01:39:45,099 --> 01:39:50,897
<i>That I could love you forever</i>

1575
01:39:51,022 --> 01:39:55,359
<i>The only trouble is</i>

1576
01:39:56,068 --> 01:39:59,989
<i>You really don't have the time</i>

1577
01:40:00,114 --> 01:40:03,701
<i>You've got one night only</i>

1578
01:40:03,826 --> 01:40:05,870
<i>One night only</i>

1579
01:40:05,995 --> 01:40:09,707
<i>That's all you have to spare</i>

1580
01:40:11,083 --> 01:40:13,711
<i>One night only</i>

1581
01:40:13,836 --> 01:40:18,007
<i>Let's not pretend to care</i>

1582
01:40:21,385 --> 01:40:25,890
<i>One night only
One night only</i>

1583
01:40:26,015 --> 01:40:29,685
<i>Come on, big baby, come on</i>

1584
01:40:31,103 --> 01:40:33,356
<i>One night only</i>

1585
01:40:33,481 --> 01:40:39,820
<i>We only have till dawn</i>

1586
01:40:41,531 --> 01:40:44,617
<i>One night only</i>

1587
01:40:46,452 --> 01:40:50,289
<i>One night only</i>

1588
01:40:51,249 --> 01:40:57,088
<i>One night only</i>

1589
01:40:59,257 --> 01:41:01,342
- Trying to make a fool of me.
- Well, Nicky said that

1590
01:41:01,467 --> 01:41:04,428
the song's only got local distribution.
Detroit stations mostly.

1591
01:41:04,554 --> 01:41:06,013
C.C. Wrote it,
so that means we own it, right?

1592
01:41:06,138 --> 01:41:07,139
Well, technically, yeah.

1593
01:41:07,265 --> 01:41:08,933
Look, I'll get the lawyers
to draw up an agreement,

1594
01:41:09,058 --> 01:41:10,393
we'll demand half the royalties.

1595
01:41:10,518 --> 01:41:12,270
No, no. This is the perfect song
to launch my new sound.

1596
01:41:12,395 --> 01:41:13,938
I want Deena to re-record it
with the girls.

1597
01:41:14,063 --> 01:41:15,439
Come on, Curtis,
the song's already moving.

1598
01:41:15,565 --> 01:41:16,899
If I can buy a hit, I can buy a flop.

1599
01:41:17,024 --> 01:41:19,652
Hey, man. This is Effie's big break.

1600
01:41:21,028 --> 01:41:24,949
- There's other songs.
- It's business. Get on it.

1601
01:41:49,557 --> 01:41:51,517
<i>Come on, baby</i>

1602
01:41:53,561 --> 01:41:55,021
<i>Come on, baby</i>

1603
01:41:58,149 --> 01:41:59,942
<i>One night only</i>

1604
01:42:02,361 --> 01:42:07,158
<i>You want all my love and my devotion</i>

1605
01:42:08,784 --> 01:42:14,123
<i>You want my loving soul
right on the line</i>

1606
01:42:15,374 --> 01:42:17,501
<i>I have no doubt</i>

1607
01:42:17,626 --> 01:42:21,255
<i>That I could love you forever</i>

1608
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:24,508
<i>The only trouble is</i>

1609
01:42:24,633 --> 01:42:27,678
<i>I really don't have the time</i>

1610
01:42:27,803 --> 01:42:31,140
<i>I've got one night only
One night only</i>

1611
01:42:31,265 --> 01:42:34,351
<i>That's all I have to spare</i>

1612
01:42:34,477 --> 01:42:36,103
<i>One night only</i>

1613
01:42:36,228 --> 01:42:39,356
<i>Let's not to pretend to care</i>

1614
01:42:39,482 --> 01:42:44,028
<i>I've got one night only
One night only</i>

1615
01:42:44,153 --> 01:42:46,822
<i>Come on, big baby, come on</i>

1616
01:42:47,448 --> 01:42:48,783
<i>One night only</i>

1617
01:42:48,908 --> 01:42:52,870
<i>We only have till dawn</i>

1618
01:42:53,579 --> 01:42:56,582
<i>We only have till dawn</i>

1619
01:42:58,667 --> 01:43:01,879
<i>One night only
One night only</i>

1620
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:24,318
<i>One night only, yeah</i>

1621
01:43:25,611 --> 01:43:27,321
<i>Come on, come on</i>

1622
01:43:27,446 --> 01:43:29,907
<i>One night only</i>

1623
01:43:43,504 --> 01:43:45,965
Oh, Cecil Osborne.
Cecil Osborne finally committed.

1624
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:48,050
And he's soaking me
for a million bucks, but I don't care,

1625
01:43:48,175 --> 01:43:51,554
<i>because he's great with actors,
Cleopatra is your first movie,</i>

1626
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:54,348
and I don't want anything
but the best for you, sweetheart.

1627
01:43:56,433 --> 01:43:57,560
What's wrong?

1628
01:43:58,269 --> 01:44:01,647
Nothing, Curtis. I guess
I never thought it would really happen.

1629
01:44:01,981 --> 01:44:03,649
You made it happen!

1630
01:44:03,983 --> 01:44:06,944
I mean, you are the queen of disco.

1631
01:44:07,319 --> 01:44:09,154
Maybe I'm just tired.

1632
01:44:09,613 --> 01:44:13,784
<i>Yeah, you got your interviews
and your photo shoot with Vogue,</i>

1633
01:44:14,368 --> 01:44:16,370
private meetings by the pool.

1634
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:22,585
You think I'm stupid?

1635
01:44:24,169 --> 01:44:25,671
When was you gonna tell me?

1636
01:44:26,422 --> 01:44:29,425
I'm sorry, Curtis.
I know I should have talked to you.

1637
01:44:30,092 --> 01:44:32,761
It's just that this part is perfect.

1638
01:44:32,886 --> 01:44:35,431
It's exactly the kind of movie
I should be making.

1639
01:44:36,056 --> 01:44:38,767
Curtis, baby, nobody knows music
the way you do.

1640
01:44:38,892 --> 01:44:40,853
It's in your blood.

1641
01:44:41,478 --> 01:44:42,980
But movies are different.

1642
01:44:52,197 --> 01:44:54,533
Deena, you know why
I chose you to sing lead?

1643
01:44:55,326 --> 01:44:57,202
Because your voice

1644
01:44:58,787 --> 01:45:01,373
has no personality, no depth.

1645
01:45:02,166 --> 01:45:04,084
Except for what I put in it.

1646
01:45:04,209 --> 01:45:06,503
See, nobody knows you like I do.

1647
01:45:06,712 --> 01:45:08,672
Well, they offered me the part
and I'm taking it.

1648
01:45:08,797 --> 01:45:10,966
Do you read contracts,
or are you just pretty?

1649
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:13,594
You can't even take a shit and wipe
your own ass unless I say it's okay.

1650
01:45:13,719 --> 01:45:16,597
- Well, I'll get myself a lawyer.
- What do you think they're gonna do?

1651
01:45:16,722 --> 01:45:18,557
You think them honkies
are gonna wait around

1652
01:45:18,682 --> 01:45:20,059
while you try to drag me into court?

1653
01:45:20,184 --> 01:45:22,227
Forget about it! It's over!

1654
01:45:27,149 --> 01:45:32,196
Listen, I don't want
those men handling you,

1655
01:45:32,404 --> 01:45:34,406
because they don't know how.

1656
01:45:34,698 --> 01:45:35,991
And, Deena,

1657
01:45:38,535 --> 01:45:40,204
I forgive you.

1658
01:45:46,376 --> 01:45:48,962
Curtis will always be here for you.

1659
01:45:51,423 --> 01:45:58,222
<i>Listen to the song here in my heart</i>

1660
01:45:59,014 --> 01:46:05,979
<i>A melody I start but can't complete</i>

1661
01:46:07,106 --> 01:46:13,987
<i>Listen to the sound from deep within</i>

1662
01:46:14,738 --> 01:46:21,203
<i>It's only beginning to find release</i>

1663
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:26,458
<i>Oh, the time has come
for my dreams to be heard</i>

1664
01:46:26,583 --> 01:46:29,253
<i>They will not be pushed aside</i>

1665
01:46:29,378 --> 01:46:32,256
<i>and turned into your own</i>

1666
01:46:32,381 --> 01:46:37,302
<i>All 'cause you won't listen</i>

1667
01:46:38,178 --> 01:46:39,972
<i>Listen</i>

1668
01:46:40,097 --> 01:46:43,559
<i>I am alone at a crossroads</i>

1669
01:46:44,101 --> 01:46:47,479
<i>I'm not at home in my own home</i>

1670
01:46:47,604 --> 01:46:51,400
<i>And I've tried and tried
to say what's on my mind</i>

1671
01:46:51,525 --> 01:46:55,070
<i>You should have known</i>

1672
01:46:55,195 --> 01:46:58,657
<i>Now I'm done believing you</i>

1673
01:46:58,782 --> 01:47:01,451
<i>You don't know what I'm feeling</i>

1674
01:47:01,577 --> 01:47:05,122
<i>I'm more than what you made of me</i>

1675
01:47:05,247 --> 01:47:09,459
<i>I followed the voice you gave to me</i>

1676
01:47:10,168 --> 01:47:16,216
<i>But now I've got to find my own</i>

1677
01:47:16,341 --> 01:47:20,053
<i>You should have listened</i>

1678
01:47:20,846 --> 01:47:24,933
<i>There is someone here inside</i>

1679
01:47:25,058 --> 01:47:27,978
<i>Someone I thought had died</i>

1680
01:47:28,103 --> 01:47:31,607
<i>So long ago</i>

1681
01:47:31,732 --> 01:47:36,820
<i>Oh, I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard</i>

1682
01:47:36,945 --> 01:47:42,534
<i>They will not be pushed aside or worse
into your own</i>

1683
01:47:42,868 --> 01:47:48,123
<i>All 'cause you won't listen</i>

1684
01:47:48,248 --> 01:47:50,042
<i>Listen</i>

1685
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:54,087
<i>I am alone at a crossroads</i>

1686
01:47:54,421 --> 01:47:57,799
<i>I'm not at home in my own home</i>

1687
01:47:57,924 --> 01:48:01,970
<i>And I've tried and tried
to say what's on my mind</i>

1688
01:48:02,095 --> 01:48:04,222
<i>You should have known</i>

1689
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:09,019
<i>Now I'm done believing you</i>

1690
01:48:09,144 --> 01:48:11,772
<i>You don't know what I'm feeling</i>

1691
01:48:11,897 --> 01:48:15,359
<i>I'm more than what you made of me</i>

1692
01:48:15,484 --> 01:48:20,530
<i>I followed the voice you gave to me</i>

1693
01:48:20,655 --> 01:48:23,909
<i>But now I've got to find my own</i>

1694
01:48:24,034 --> 01:48:26,953
<i>I don't know where I belong</i>

1695
01:48:27,079 --> 01:48:31,166
<i>But I'll be moving on</i>

1696
01:48:31,291 --> 01:48:34,711
<i>If you don't</i>

1697
01:48:34,836 --> 01:48:41,760
<i>If you won't listen</i>

1698
01:48:42,177 --> 01:48:46,890
<i>To the song here in my heart</i>

1699
01:48:47,015 --> 01:48:49,643
<i>A melody I start</i>

1700
01:48:49,768 --> 01:48:54,815
<i>But I will complete</i>

1701
01:48:56,108 --> 01:48:59,903
<i>Now I'm done believing you</i>

1702
01:49:00,028 --> 01:49:02,572
<i>You don't know what I'm feeling</i>

1703
01:49:02,697 --> 01:49:06,201
<i>I'm more than what you made of me</i>

1704
01:49:06,326 --> 01:49:10,539
<i>I followed the voice
you think you gave to me</i>

1705
01:49:10,956 --> 01:49:17,379
<i>But now I've got to find my own</i>

1706
01:49:17,796 --> 01:49:24,261
<i>My own</i>

1707
01:49:44,322 --> 01:49:47,284
Marty. Long time.

1708
01:49:47,868 --> 01:49:51,454
Yeah, Curtis.
And you're still a second-class snake.

1709
01:49:52,998 --> 01:49:56,960
First-class to you.
Gentlemen, give me a break.

1710
01:49:57,252 --> 01:49:59,462
Why, Curtis? Did you give Effie one?

1711
01:49:59,588 --> 01:50:03,633
- I could kill you for what you did to her.
- You couldn't kill shit.

1712
01:50:04,092 --> 01:50:05,886
I assume you guys have a reason
for barging in here

1713
01:50:06,011 --> 01:50:07,721
other than to insult me.

1714
01:50:07,846 --> 01:50:11,308
Mr Taylor, we're planning to go
to the federal authorities.

1715
01:50:11,433 --> 01:50:15,729
Yeah, we'll tell the feds how
you killed Effie's record. Payola, man.

1716
01:50:16,313 --> 01:50:18,523
You remember, Curtis, I witnessed it all.

1717
01:50:18,648 --> 01:50:21,359
<i>The whole dirty operation going back
to Steppin' to the Bad Side.</i>

1718
01:50:21,484 --> 01:50:23,236
That's right you did,
but who's going to believe you?

1719
01:50:23,361 --> 01:50:26,448
All you are is a guy that's pissed off
'cause you got fired.

1720
01:50:26,573 --> 01:50:28,700
We have documented evidence,
Mr Taylor.

1721
01:50:28,825 --> 01:50:32,287
Falsified sales records
to cheat investors out of their profits,

1722
01:50:32,412 --> 01:50:36,625
goods-quality merchandise listed
as cutouts to disguise the fraud,

1723
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:38,168
mob-backed loans,

1724
01:50:38,293 --> 01:50:42,297
and a payola operation
stretching back 11 years.

1725
01:50:45,425 --> 01:50:46,718
Who gave you this?

1726
01:50:47,052 --> 01:50:50,639
Believe me, I had no idea
what Curtis was trying to do to you.

1727
01:50:51,181 --> 01:50:54,225
Effie, are you all right?

1728
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:59,856
I'm happy now, Deena.
I have a child who loves me.

1729
01:51:00,148 --> 01:51:04,069
- You have a baby?
- Magic's not exactly a baby anymore.

1730
01:51:06,237 --> 01:51:08,657
She's almost nine now.

1731
01:51:10,075 --> 01:51:14,913
I wanted to tell you.
At the time, I really wanted to tell you.

1732
01:51:16,956 --> 01:51:18,583
Deena, he doesn't know.

1733
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:21,753
Effie, Effie, Effie.

1734
01:51:23,755 --> 01:51:26,716
Well, I see you're just as much trouble
as you ever were.

1735
01:51:26,841 --> 01:51:28,259
Hello, Curtis.

1736
01:51:28,968 --> 01:51:31,179
You haven't changed much, either.

1737
01:51:33,515 --> 01:51:38,353
Actually, I take that back.
You are looking a little heavy, baby.

1738
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:40,772
You could lose some weight.

1739
01:51:49,948 --> 01:51:51,741
I'll deal with you later.

1740
01:51:54,828 --> 01:51:58,289
Mr Taylor agrees it's in everyone's
interest to resolve the situation

1741
01:51:58,415 --> 01:52:01,042
without resorting
to draconian legal measures.

1742
01:52:01,167 --> 01:52:02,168
Say that in English.

1743
01:52:02,293 --> 01:52:05,422
<i>Nationwide distribution of our
version of One Night Only, Effie.</i>

1744
01:52:05,547 --> 01:52:08,675
- On our own label.
- That sounds good to me.

1745
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,928
And remember, Curtis,
if these negotiations fall apart

1746
01:52:12,053 --> 01:52:13,721
you're going straight to jail.

1747
01:52:13,888 --> 01:52:14,931
That's right, Curtis.

1748
01:52:15,056 --> 01:52:18,309
You stopped me once,
but you'll never stop me again.

1749
01:52:19,352 --> 01:52:22,981
<i>'Cause this time</i>

1750
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:30,155
<i>Effie White's gonna</i>

1751
01:52:31,531 --> 01:52:33,032
<i>win</i>

1752
01:52:48,548 --> 01:52:50,842
Deena! Get your ass out here!

1753
01:52:50,967 --> 01:52:52,302
Hello, Curtis.

1754
01:52:52,427 --> 01:52:56,639
Hey, May. What are you doing here?
I mean, I thought you said you hate LA.

1755
01:52:56,764 --> 01:53:01,144
Oh, I do. But my daughter said
she needed me, so I'm here.

1756
01:53:01,644 --> 01:53:03,229
Go wait in the car, Mama.

1757
01:53:06,316 --> 01:53:07,775
That was a dirty trick you pulled on me.

1758
01:53:07,901 --> 01:53:09,861
I had to do something
to stop you, Curtis.

1759
01:53:09,986 --> 01:53:12,989
- How could you do that to Effie?
- I had to do what I had to.

1760
01:53:13,156 --> 01:53:14,198
Where do you think you're going?

1761
01:53:14,324 --> 01:53:17,035
Out looking for a new sound, baby,
just like you.

1762
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:20,538
- You can't leave.
- Why? Because you own me?

1763
01:53:20,788 --> 01:53:24,375
You can sue me.
You can take everything I have!

1764
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:29,464
It don't matter, 'cause I'll start over.
Effie did it and so can I.

1765
01:53:30,173 --> 01:53:33,343
Listen, I'm not living without you.
I love you.

1766
01:53:35,053 --> 01:53:39,307
I'm sorry, Curtis.
I can't do this anymore.

1767
01:53:49,192 --> 01:53:50,985
Goodbye.

1768
01:54:22,433 --> 01:54:23,434
Good to see you, Curtis.

1769
01:54:24,936 --> 01:54:26,479
Mr Taylor?

1770
01:54:26,604 --> 01:54:29,565
Mr Taylor, this must be
a bittersweet night.

1771
01:54:29,691 --> 01:54:32,527
How does it feel
to say goodbye to The Dreams?

1772
01:54:32,652 --> 01:54:34,862
I don't believe in goodbyes, just hellos.

1773
01:54:34,987 --> 01:54:37,865
And I want you all to say hello
to Tania Williams.

1774
01:54:39,575 --> 01:54:43,788
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, back in Detroit
for their farewell performance,</i>

1775
01:54:44,038 --> 01:54:46,374
<i>the incredible Dreams.</i>

1776
01:54:59,804 --> 01:55:02,890
<i>We didn't make forever</i>

1777
01:55:03,015 --> 01:55:06,602
<i>We've each got to go our separate way</i>

1778
01:55:06,727 --> 01:55:10,064
<i>And now we're standing here helpless</i>

1779
01:55:10,189 --> 01:55:13,651
<i>Looking for something to say</i>

1780
01:55:13,776 --> 01:55:17,155
<i>We've been together a long time</i>

1781
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,700
<i>We never thought it would end</i>

1782
01:55:21,075 --> 01:55:24,078
<i>We were always so close to each other</i>

1783
01:55:24,203 --> 01:55:27,123
<i>You were always my friend</i>

1784
01:55:27,248 --> 01:55:31,043
<i>And it's hard to say goodbye, my love</i>

1785
01:55:31,169 --> 01:55:34,547
<i>It's hard to see you cry, my love</i>

1786
01:55:34,672 --> 01:55:37,842
<i>Hard to open up that door</i>

1787
01:55:37,967 --> 01:55:43,556
<i>When you're not sure
what you're going for</i>

1788
01:55:48,769 --> 01:55:52,273
<i>We didn't want this to happen</i>

1789
01:55:52,398 --> 01:55:55,276
<i>But we shouldn't feel sad</i>

1790
01:55:55,401 --> 01:55:58,821
<i>We had a good life together</i>

1791
01:55:58,946 --> 01:56:02,575
<i>Just remember all the times we had</i>

1792
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:06,120
<i>You know I'll always love you</i>

1793
01:56:06,245 --> 01:56:08,998
<i>You know I'll always care</i>

1794
01:56:09,123 --> 01:56:13,085
<i>And no matter how far I may go</i>

1795
01:56:13,211 --> 01:56:18,299
<i>In my heart you'll always be there</i>

1796
01:56:19,467 --> 01:56:22,803
<i>And it's hard to say goodbye, my love</i>

1797
01:56:22,929 --> 01:56:26,265
<i>It's hard to see you cry, my love</i>

1798
01:56:27,266 --> 01:56:30,061
<i>It's hard to open up that door</i>

1799
01:56:30,186 --> 01:56:33,731
<i>When you're not sure
what you're going for</i>

1800
01:56:33,856 --> 01:56:36,609
<i>But we've got to grow
We've got to try</i>

1801
01:56:36,734 --> 01:56:38,903
<i>Though it's hard, so hard</i>

1802
01:56:39,028 --> 01:56:40,947
<i>We have to say goodbye</i>

1803
01:56:41,072 --> 01:56:44,075
<i>We didn't make forever</i>

1804
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:47,411
<i>But I will always love you</i>

1805
01:56:47,536 --> 01:56:50,915
<i>We didn't make forever</i>

1806
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,543
<i>But I will always love you</i>

1807
01:56:54,669 --> 01:56:57,171
<i>It's so hard</i>

1808
01:56:57,296 --> 01:57:00,091
<i>Baby, it's so hard</i>

1809
01:57:01,175 --> 01:57:03,552
<i>It's so hard</i>

1810
01:57:04,261 --> 01:57:06,514
<i>Baby, it's so hard</i>

1811
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:08,057
<i>I'll always love you</i>

1812
01:57:08,182 --> 01:57:10,309
<i>It's so hard</i>

1813
01:57:11,268 --> 01:57:13,729
<i>Baby, it's so hard</i>

1814
01:57:15,398 --> 01:57:17,108
Yeah!

1815
01:57:29,578 --> 01:57:32,707
Well, I guess it's about that time.

1816
01:57:33,165 --> 01:57:34,709
The last song.

1817
01:57:35,209 --> 01:57:38,462
You know, we've been together
a very long time.

1818
01:57:38,587 --> 01:57:41,674
And I promised Lorrell I wouldn't cry.

1819
01:57:42,967 --> 01:57:44,677
And I'm not.

1820
01:57:45,553 --> 01:57:47,471
I'm very happy.

1821
01:57:47,596 --> 01:57:50,307
All of our family is here tonight.

1822
01:57:50,433 --> 01:57:53,269
You know, there really aren't
three Dreams.

1823
01:57:53,394 --> 01:57:55,020
There are four.

1824
01:57:55,396 --> 01:57:58,816
And we're all here
to sing that song for you.

1825
01:57:59,942 --> 01:58:01,110
Effie.

1826
01:58:32,183 --> 01:58:39,106
<i>Every man has his own special dream</i>

1827
01:58:40,191 --> 01:58:46,322
<i>And that dream's
just about to come true</i>

1828
01:58:46,447 --> 01:58:50,576
<i>Life's not as bad as it may seem</i>

1829
01:58:50,701 --> 01:58:56,999
<i>If you open your eyes
to what's in front of you</i>

1830
01:58:57,625 --> 01:59:00,044
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

1831
01:59:00,669 --> 01:59:04,632
<i>Boys, we'll make you happy</i>

1832
01:59:07,426 --> 01:59:10,012
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

1833
01:59:10,387 --> 01:59:14,642
<i>Boys, we'll always care</i>

1834
01:59:14,767 --> 01:59:17,144
<i>We'll always care</i>

1835
01:59:17,269 --> 01:59:19,980
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

1836
01:59:20,105 --> 01:59:23,484
<i>Dream girls will never leave you</i>

1837
01:59:23,609 --> 01:59:26,987
<i>Never, never, never, never,
never leave you</i>

1838
01:59:27,112 --> 01:59:31,367
<i>And all you got to do is dream</i>

1839
01:59:32,243 --> 01:59:35,537
<i>All you got to do is dream</i>

1840
01:59:35,663 --> 01:59:39,750
<i>Just dream and, baby</i>

1841
01:59:40,167 --> 01:59:43,629
<i>we'll be</i>

1842
01:59:46,674 --> 01:59:51,512
<i>there</i>

1843
01:59:55,015 --> 01:59:59,561
<i>We'll be there</i>

1844
02:00:04,858 --> 02:00:10,072
<i>We'll be there</i>

1845
02:00:14,618 --> 02:00:20,124
<i>We'll be there</i>
