1
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:41,138
Legend tells of a
legendary warrior...

2
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:44,368
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,072
He traveled the land in
search of worthy foes.

4
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:05,624
I see you like to chew. Maybe
you should chew on my fist!

5
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:09,223
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

6
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,463
Then he swallowed.
And then he spoke.

7
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,835
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:16,339
Shashabooey!

9
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,141
He was so deadly in fact,

10
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:24,909
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

11
00:01:24,982 --> 00:01:27,177
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

12
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:30,015
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

13
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:33,255
There is no charge
for awesomeness.

14
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:35,952
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:36,027 --> 00:01:37,289
Kablooey!

16
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:40,091
It mattered not how
many foes he faced.

17
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:43,031
They were no match
for his bodacity!

18
00:01:55,546 --> 00:02:00,210
Never before had a panda been so feared!
And so loved.

19
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,781
Even the most heroic
heroes in China,

20
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:06,085
the Furious Five,

21
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:09,092
bowed in respect to
this great master.

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,991
We should hang out.

23
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:12,188
Agreed.

24
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:17,193
But hanging out
would have to wait.

25
00:02:17,268 --> 00:02:21,705
Because when you're facing the
10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

26
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:24,570
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

27
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,401
Po! Get up!

28
00:02:26,477 --> 00:02:28,240
You'll be later for work!

29
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:29,574
What?

30
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:38,351
Po! Get up!

31
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:57,162
Po. What are you doing up there?

32
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,503
Nothing.

33
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:05,777
Monkey! Mantis! Orange!
Viper! Tigress!

34
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,521
Po! Let's go! You're
late for work.

35
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:16,958
Coming!

36
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,497
Sorry, Dad.

37
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:31,406
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

38
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:33,841
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

39
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,402
Nothing. I just had
a crazy dream.

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,708
About what?

41
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,374
What were you dreaming about?

42
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,974
What was I?

43
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,810
I was dreaming about...

44
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:46,845
...noodles.

45
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:50,988
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

46
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:53,622
Yeah. What else would
I be dreaming about?

47
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:56,166
Careful! That soup is sharp.

48
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:57,701
Oh, happy day!

49
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:01,670
My son, finally having
the noodle dream!

50
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:07,067
You don't know how long I've
been waiting for this moment.

51
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:09,009
This is a sign, Po.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,877
A sign of what?

53
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:15,578
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

54
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:17,917
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

55
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:23,120
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

56
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:26,686
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

57
00:04:26,764 --> 00:04:29,426
...who won it from a
friend in mahjong.

58
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,196
Dad, Dad, Dad, it
was just a dream.

59
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,568
No, it was the dream.

60
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,200
We are noodle folk. Broth
runs through our veins.

61
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:42,178
But, Dad, didn't you ever
want to do something else?

62
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:44,111
Something besides noodles?

63
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:47,116
Actually, when I was
young and crazy,

64
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:51,245
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:52,448
Why didn't you?

66
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,286
Because it was a stupid dream.

67
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:58,495
Can you imagine me making tofu?

68
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:00,992
Tofu.

69
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:04,466
No! We all have our
place in this world.

70
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:07,095
Mine is here, and yours is...

71
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,399
I know, is here.

72
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:11,600
No, it's at tables
2, 5, 7, and 12.

73
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,735
Service with a smile.

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,340
Well done, students... if you
were trying to disappoint me.

75
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:50,574
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

76
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:53,549
Orange, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

77
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:55,448
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

78
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,953
It's Master Oogway.
He wants to see you.

79
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:12,302
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:23,079
Why must something be wrong for
me to want to see my old friend?

81
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:25,274
So, nothing's wrong?

82
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:27,977
Well, I didn't say that.

83
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,699
You were saying?

84
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:50,865
I have had a vision.

85
00:06:50,941 --> 00:06:53,671
Tai Lung will return.

86
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:01,176
That is impossible!
He is in prison.

87
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:04,016
Nothing is impossible.

88
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:05,878
Zeng!

89
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:08,288
Fly to Chorh-Gom
prison and tell them

90
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,692
to double the guards, double their
weapons, double everything!

91
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,662
Tai Lung does not
leave that prison!

92
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:15,198
Yes, Master Shifu!

93
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:22,199
One often meets his destiny on
the road he takes to avoid it.

94
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:26,266
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

95
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:27,332
He'll...

96
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:29,709
Your mind is like this
water, my friend.

97
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,216
When it is agitated, it
becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:36,382
But if you allow it to settle...

99
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:39,449
...the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:44,556
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,987
It is time.

102
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:51,797
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:51,869 --> 00:07:56,602
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,141
I don't know.

105
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,903
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:02,813 --> 00:08:03,837
Watch it!

107
00:08:03,914 --> 00:08:05,404
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:09,581
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:10,642
What?

110
00:08:12,756 --> 00:08:16,021
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:20,689
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

112
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:23,824
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

113
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:28,031
This is the greatest day in
kung fu history! Just go!

114
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:30,096
Po! Where are you going?

115
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:33,340
To the Jade Palace.

116
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,708
You're forgetting
your noodle cart.

117
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:40,341
The whole valley will be there, and
you'll sell noodles to all of them.

118
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:41,816
Selling noodles?

119
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:46,922
But, Dad, I was
thinking, maybe I...

120
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,118
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

121
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:57,525
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

122
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:59,296
That's my boy!

123
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,671
I told you that
dream was a sign.

124
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:04,641
Yeah. Glad I had it.

125
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:11,246
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

126
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:13,840
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:51,116
Come on. Come on!

128
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:53,053
Almost there.

129
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:54,283
What?

130
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:57,020
No! Oh, no!

131
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:02,924
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

132
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:10,863
No. I'll bring me
back a souvenir.

133
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,479
It is an historic day.

134
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:19,311
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

135
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:24,252
Yes, and one I feared I
would not live to see.

136
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:26,312
Are your students ready?

137
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,153
Yes, Master Oogway.

138
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:31,055
Know this, old friend.

139
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:35,462
Whomever I choose will not only
bring peace to the valley...

140
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:38,160
...but also to you.

141
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:41,972
Let the tournament begin!

142
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:45,635
Let the tournament begin!

143
00:10:57,087 --> 00:10:58,452
Yeah.

144
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,186
No, no, wait!

145
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,591
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

146
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:05,890
Yes!

147
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,265
Hey! Open the door!

148
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,264
Let me in!

149
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,900
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

150
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,673
it is my great honor to
present to you... Tigress!

151
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:26,910
Viper! Orange! Monkey! Mantis!

152
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,315
The Furious Five!

153
00:11:41,098 --> 00:11:42,565
Yeah, the Furious Five!

154
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:46,199
Warriors, prepare!

155
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,830
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

156
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,237
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

157
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,300
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

158
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:57,739
Look at that.

159
00:11:57,815 --> 00:11:59,806
Hey! Get out of the way!

160
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,351
And finally Master Tigress!

161
00:12:37,788 --> 00:12:42,191
And believe me, citizens, you
have not seen anything yet.

162
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,521
I know!

163
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:48,691
Master Tigress! Face Iron
Ox and his Blades of Death.

164
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:05,548
I sense the Dragon
Warrior is among us.

165
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:13,713
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

166
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:18,319
Master Oogway will now
choose the Dragon Warrior!

167
00:13:19,296 --> 00:13:21,457
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

168
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,223
Yeah.

169
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:41,775
Po!

170
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,786
What are you doing?!

171
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:46,414
What does it look like I'm doing?!
Stop!

172
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,424
I'm going to see the
Dragon Warrior!

173
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:55,858
But I don't understand. You
finally had the noodle dream!

174
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:59,759
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

175
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:06,100
I love kung fu!

176
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:23,124
Come on, son. Let's
get back to work.

177
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,128
OK.

178
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:34,966
Come back!

179
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:00,993
What's going on?

180
00:15:01,765 --> 00:15:03,426
Where?

181
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:07,494
What are you pointing?

182
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,231
OK. Sorry.

183
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:14,777
I just wanted to see who
the Dragon Warrior was.

184
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,779
How interesting.

185
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:20,146
Master, are you pointing at me?

186
00:15:20,217 --> 00:15:22,242
- Him.
- Who?

187
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:26,449
- You.
- Me?

188
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:32,018
The universe has brought
us the Dragon Warrior!

189
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:33,695
- What?
- What?!

190
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:35,459
- What?!
- What?!

191
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:47,936
Stop, wait! Who told you to?

192
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,950
Master Oogway, wait.

193
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:03,326
That flabby panda can't possibly
be the answer to our problem.

194
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,058
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

195
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:08,563
That was just an accident!

196
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:11,396
There are no accidents.

197
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:29,280
Forgive us, Master.
We have failed you.

198
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:32,686
No. If the panda has
not quit by morning

199
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:35,088
then I will have failed you.

200
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:56,107
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

201
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,443
...from Master Shifu.

202
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:04,278
What?!

203
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,685
"Double the guard?!"

204
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:07,553
"Extra precautions?!"

205
00:17:07,624 --> 00:17:09,956
"Your prison may
not be adequate?!"

206
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:16,521
You doubt my prison security?!

207
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,465
Absolutely not.

208
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:21,663
Shifu does. I'm
just the messenger.

209
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:25,367
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

210
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:29,137
Escape from Chorh-Gom
prison is impossible!

211
00:17:34,384 --> 00:17:36,318
Impressive, isn't it?

212
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,084
It's very impressive.

213
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:40,646
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:43,386
One way in, one way out.

215
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,556
One thousand guards
and one prisoner.

216
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:50,156
Yes, except that prisoner...

217
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,928
...is Tai Lung.

218
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,735
Take us down.

219
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:04,611
What are you doing?

220
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,426
Oh, my.

221
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:24,758
Behold Tai Lung.

222
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:29,496
I'm just gonna wait right here.

223
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:33,873
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

224
00:18:33,944 --> 00:18:36,208
Crossbows! At the ready!

225
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,076
Crossbows?

226
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,708
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

227
00:18:40,784 --> 00:18:45,278
Oogway giving someone the <font color="yellow">Dragon
Scroll</font>, and it's not gonna be you.

228
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:47,016
Don't get him mad.

229
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,891
What's he gonna do about it? I've
got him completely immobilized.

230
00:18:56,133 --> 00:19:00,092
Did I step on the
wittle kitty's tail?

231
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:02,037
I'm good. I've seen enough.

232
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:04,472
I'll tell Shifu he has
nothing to worry about.

233
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:05,769
No, he doesn't.

234
00:19:05,842 --> 00:19:08,072
I'll tell him that.

235
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,010
Can we please go now?

236
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:28,497
<font color="red">Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!</font>

237
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:29,738
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,171
Wait a second!

239
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:45,842
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

240
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:52,118
The Sacred Hall of Warriors!
No way!

241
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:54,522
Look at this place.

242
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:01,130
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

243
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,061
The Sword of Heroes!

244
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:08,400
Said to be so sharp you can
cut yourself just by looking.

245
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,136
The Invisible
Trident of Destiny!

246
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:17,975
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

247
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:25,812
No!

248
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,921
The legendary Urn of
Whispering Warriors.

249
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:33,156
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

250
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:37,659
Hello.

251
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:40,066
Have you finished sight-seeing?

252
00:20:40,136 --> 00:20:42,229
Sorry, I should have
come to you first.

253
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,273
My patience is wearing thin.

254
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:47,174
Well, I mean, it's not like
you were going anywhere.

255
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:49,610
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

256
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,703
How's it going?

257
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,214
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

258
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,582
Someone... broke that.

259
00:20:57,654 --> 00:21:00,020
But I'll fix it. Do
you have some...

260
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,185
...glue?

261
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:06,184
A splinter.

262
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:09,255
So you're the legendary
<font color="red">Dragon Warrior?</font>

263
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:12,460
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

264
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:16,266
You are not the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>. You will
never be the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font> until...

265
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:19,274
...you have learned the
secret of the <font color="yellow">Dragon Scroll</font>

266
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:23,912
So, how does this work?

267
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,881
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

268
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:32,245
You think it's that easy? That
I'll just hand you the secret

269
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:34,222
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

270
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,317
One must first master the
highest level of kung fu.

271
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:41,455
And that is impossible if
that one is someone like you.

272
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:42,555
Someone like me?

273
00:21:42,632 --> 00:21:47,296
Yes, look at you! This fat butt!
Flabby arms!

274
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,838
Those are sensitive
in the flabby parts.

275
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:52,739
And this ridiculous belly.

276
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,074
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

277
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:58,307
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

278
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:00,906
Don't stand that close. I
can smell your breath.

279
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,918
Listen, Oogway said I was...

280
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,615
The Wuxi Finger Hold. Not
the Wuxi Finger Hold!

281
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:08,419
Oh, you know this hold?

282
00:22:08,491 --> 00:22:11,153
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

283
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:13,991
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

284
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:17,526
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

285
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,468
The hardest part is
cleaning up afterwards.

286
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:23,665
OK, OK, take it easy.

287
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,174
Now listen closely, panda.

288
00:22:26,242 --> 00:22:29,370
Oogway may have picked you, but
when I'm through with you,

289
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:34,349
I promise you, you're going to
wish he hadn't! Are we clear?

290
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,645
Yeah, we're clear.
We're so clear.

291
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:39,450
Good.

292
00:22:39,522 --> 00:22:41,456
I can't wait to get started.

293
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:23,328
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:24,930
What?

295
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:28,971
- Now?
- Yes, now.

296
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,338
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the <font color="red"> </font>.

297
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,968
Oh, OK, well...

298
00:23:35,044 --> 00:23:39,037
I don't know if I can
do all of those moves.

299
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:41,879
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

300
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:45,785
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

301
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:46,913
What level is that?

302
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,448
Well, I'm not a master, but...

303
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:53,291
...let's just start at zero.
Level zero.

304
00:23:53,363 --> 00:23:57,459
No. There is no such
thing as level zero.

305
00:23:57,534 --> 00:24:00,298
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

306
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:05,507
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

307
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:06,873
But if you insist...

308
00:24:06,943 --> 00:24:09,707
The Furious Five!

309
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,045
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

310
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,880
Go ahead, panda. Show
us what you can do.

311
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:25,125
Are they gonna watch, or should I
wait till they get back to work?

312
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,184
Hit it.

313
00:24:26,296 --> 00:24:30,926
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

314
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,766
So my kung fu might not be as good as...
later on.

315
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:35,964
Just hit it.

316
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:37,932
All right.

317
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:42,309
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

318
00:24:42,378 --> 00:24:45,404
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

319
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:47,677
I'm coming at you
with crazy feet.

320
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,742
Come on. I'm a blur. You've
never seen bear style.

321
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,617
You've only seen praying mantis.

322
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:54,623
Or monkey style.

323
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,623
Or I could come at
you snickety-snake.

324
00:24:57,694 --> 00:25:00,060
Would you hit it!

325
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:02,290
All right. All right.

326
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:11,098
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

327
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:14,104
How's that?

328
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:26,378
That hurts.

329
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:35,557
This will be easier
than I thought.

330
00:25:35,632 --> 00:25:38,123
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

331
00:25:38,968 --> 00:25:40,265
Those are hard!

332
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:46,074
My tenders.

333
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,865
How did I do?

334
00:26:15,939 --> 00:26:19,739
There is now a level zero.

335
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:19,909
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

336
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,207
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

337
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:24,610
What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,979
The poor guy's gonna
get himself killed.

339
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,541
He is so mighty!

340
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:34,454
The Dragon Warrior fell out
of the sky on a ball of fire!

341
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:37,357
When he walks, the
very ground shakes!

342
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:42,627
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,724
Yeah, or could at
least touch his toes.

344
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:47,201
Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:11,561 --> 00:27:12,721
OK.

346
00:27:21,537 --> 00:27:23,164
Great.

347
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:39,613
Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:41,088
I am now.

349
00:27:41,257 --> 00:27:42,656
I was just...

350
00:27:42,725 --> 00:27:44,625
Some day, huh?

351
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:49,097
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

352
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:54,934
I've had a long and rather
disappointing day, so...

353
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:59,005
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

354
00:27:59,108 --> 00:28:01,576
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

355
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:04,444
It's just... Man,
I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:07,210
You guys were amazing at the
Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:07,283 --> 00:28:10,775
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,888
Sorry about that.

359
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,449
Look, you don't belong here.

360
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:23,064
I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:25,623
I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:27,226
My whole life I dreamed of...

363
00:28:27,303 --> 00:28:32,172
No, I meant you don't belong here. I
mean, in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:35,602
Property of Orange.

365
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,543
OK. Right, right.

366
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:40,138
So, you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,013
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,212
We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:48,485
All right. You're awesome. Last
thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:53,488
What was that?

371
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:54,996
I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:57,225
OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,494
Sleep well.

374
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:03,169
That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:07,632
Master Tigress! I didn't
mean to wake you.

376
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:10,406
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

377
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,777
This is your room.

378
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:15,147
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:15,218 --> 00:29:17,584
You're a disgrace to
kung fu, and if you have

380
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:21,282
any respect for who we
are and what we do,

381
00:29:21,624 --> 00:29:23,785
you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:30,859
Big fan!

383
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:42,108
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:44,447 --> 00:29:49,146
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:54,155
I understand. You eat
when you are upset.

386
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:58,216
Upset? I'm not upset. What
makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,895
So why are you so upset?

388
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:10,563
I probably sucked more today than
anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,269
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

390
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:15,435
Probably.

391
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:19,208
And the Five! Man, you should've seen them!
They totally hate me.

392
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:20,271
Totally.

393
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:24,410
How is Shifu ever going to turn
me into the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior?</font>

394
00:30:26,556 --> 00:30:28,456
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:32,085
I've got no claws,
no wings, no venom.

396
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:35,096
Even Mantis has those...
thingies.

397
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:40,100
Maybe I should just quit and
go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,433
Quit, don't quit.

399
00:30:45,508 --> 00:30:49,535
Noodles, don't noodles.

400
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:54,276
You are too concerned with
what was and what will be.

401
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,215
There's a saying:

402
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:58,719
Yesterday is history,

403
00:30:58,821 --> 00:31:01,289
Tomorrow is a mystery,

404
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,418
but today is a gift.

405
00:31:04,493 --> 00:31:07,291
That is why it is
called the present.

406
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:39,659
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

407
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:42,220
To your battle stations!
Go! Go! Go!

408
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:52,600
Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:54,006
Fire!

410
00:31:56,646 --> 00:31:57,670
Fire!

411
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,017
Tai Lung is free! I
must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,923
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

413
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:12,119
Bring it up!

414
00:32:14,864 --> 00:32:16,354
Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:39,144
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:50,120
We're dead. So very, very dead.

417
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:52,885
Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:40,576 --> 00:34:43,272
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

419
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:05,532
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

420
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:10,636
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

421
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:12,731
Fly back there and tell them...

422
00:35:12,808 --> 00:35:16,539
...the real Dragon
Warrior is coming home.

423
00:35:28,524 --> 00:35:30,048
Good morning, Master!

424
00:35:31,527 --> 00:35:33,154
Panda!

425
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:34,218
Panda!

426
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:35,791
Wake up!

427
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,563
He's quit.

428
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:47,634
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

429
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,804
All we can do is resume our
training and trust that in time,

430
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,508
the true <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>
will be revealed.

431
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:56,541
What are you doing here?!

432
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:59,477
Hi! Good morning, Master!

433
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:01,453
I thought I'd warm up a little.

434
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:04,581
You're stuck.

435
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,026
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

436
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,828
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

437
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,834
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

438
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:16,437
Maybe on three. One, two...

439
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:18,700
...three.

440
00:36:20,476 --> 00:36:22,137
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

441
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:25,146
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

442
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:29,514
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

443
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:32,952
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

444
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:36,788
And years longer to
apply it in combat!

445
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:47,726
Put that down!

446
00:36:47,803 --> 00:36:52,297
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

447
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:55,309
Yeah! Excellent.

448
00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:57,305
Let's get started.

449
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:01,480
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

450
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:06,444
I'm sorry, brother. I thought
you said you were ready.

451
00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:09,821
That was awesome!
Let's go again!

452
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:39,120
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

453
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:41,520
Your next opponent will be me.

454
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,353
All right! Yeah, let's go!

455
00:37:45,861 --> 00:37:47,920
Step forth.

456
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:51,455
The true path to victory is to
find your opponent's weakness...

457
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:53,398
...and make him suffer for it.

458
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:54,800
Oh, yeah!

459
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,237
To take his strength and
use it against him...

460
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:00,798
...until he finally falls...

461
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:01,943
...or quits.

462
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:03,935
A real warrior never quits.

463
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:07,210
Don't worry, Master.
I will never quit!

464
00:38:17,593 --> 00:38:20,790
If he's smart, he won't
come back up those steps.

465
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,194
But he will.

466
00:38:22,264 --> 00:38:24,562
He's not going to quit, is he?

467
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:27,397
He's not going to quit
bouncing, I'll tell you that.

468
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,341
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

469
00:38:42,418 --> 00:38:43,442
Trust me, it will.

470
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,148
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

471
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:49,884
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

472
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:50,947
Sure you were.

473
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:55,087
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

474
00:38:56,265 --> 00:38:57,254
I'm over here.

475
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,801
Maybe you should
look at this again.

476
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:03,303
Oh, OK.

477
00:39:06,108 --> 00:39:08,099
Stop it. Stop!

478
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:12,213
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

479
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:16,211
...but if I didn't know better, I'd
say he was trying to get rid of me.

480
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:23,556
I know he can seem
kind of heartless...

481
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:26,161
...but he wasn't
always like that.

482
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:27,559
According to legend,

483
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:32,157
there was once a time when Master
Shifu actually used to smile.

484
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:34,168
- No!
- Yes.

485
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:35,498
But that was before.

486
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:37,562
Before what?

487
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,970
Before Tai Lung.

488
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:41,634
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

489
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,702
Well, if he's going to
stay here, he should know.

490
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,714
Guys, guys, I know
about Tai Lung.

491
00:39:46,782 --> 00:39:52,243
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

492
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:56,485
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

493
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:58,685
He wasn't just a student.

494
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,864
Shifu found him as a cub...

495
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:10,438
...and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:12,808 --> 00:40:15,868
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,243
...Shifu trained him.

498
00:40:19,314 --> 00:40:23,444
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

499
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:26,883
It was never enough
for Tai Lung.

500
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,217
He wanted the <font color="yellow">Dragon Scroll?</font>.

501
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:35,593
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

502
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:39,628
Outraged, Tai Lung laid
waste to the valley.

503
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:44,129
He tried to take the
scroll by force.

504
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:48,802
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

505
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:52,337
But how could he?

506
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:10,659
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he
had never loved anyone before.

507
00:41:18,907 --> 00:41:20,169
Or since.

508
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,517
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

509
00:41:31,587 --> 00:41:33,817
To train the true
<font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

510
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:36,915
And he's stuck with you.

511
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:40,860
A big fat panda who
treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:42,752
That is it!

513
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:45,959
Wait! My fault! I accidentally
tweaked his facial nerve.

514
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:50,871
And may have also
stopped his heart.

515
00:41:54,543 --> 00:41:56,101
Inner peace.

516
00:41:57,379 --> 00:41:59,370
Inner peace.

517
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:04,046
Inner...

518
00:42:05,654 --> 00:42:07,554
Inner peace.

519
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:15,054
Would whoever is making that
flapping sound quiet down?!

520
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,562
Inner...

521
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,231
Oh, Zeng.

522
00:42:26,308 --> 00:42:27,900
Excellent.

523
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:29,910
I could use some
good news right now.

524
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:39,051
Master! Master!

525
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:43,987
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

526
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:46,425
Shifu.

527
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:49,896
There is just news. There
is no good or bad.

528
00:42:49,965 --> 00:42:53,628
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

529
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:57,103
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

530
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:01,304
That is bad news...

531
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:05,710
...if you do not believe that the
<font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font> can stop him.

532
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:10,047
The panda? Master, that panda
is not the Dragon Warrior.

533
00:43:10,118 --> 00:43:13,417
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

534
00:43:13,488 --> 00:43:15,786
There are no accidents.

535
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:20,153
Yes, I know. You've
said that already.

536
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:24,426
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

537
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:25,591
Thrice.

538
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,294
My old friend,

539
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,965
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

540
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,601
until you let go of the
illusion of control.

541
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:37,042
Illusion?

542
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:40,104
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

543
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:43,208
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

544
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:46,550
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

545
00:43:46,622 --> 00:43:49,147
But there are things
we can control.

546
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:53,319
I can control when
the fruit will fall.

547
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:56,091
And I can control...

548
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:59,156
...where to plant the seed.

549
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:01,761
That is no illusion, Master.

550
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:05,396
Yes.

551
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:07,874
But no matter what you do

552
00:44:07,943 --> 00:44:10,878
that seed will grow
to be a peach tree.

553
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:15,815
You may wish for an apple or an
orange, but you will get a peach.

554
00:44:15,884 --> 00:44:19,513
But a peach cannot
defeat Tai Lung!

555
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:22,250
Maybe it can.

556
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:25,122
If you are willing to guide it.

557
00:44:25,193 --> 00:44:27,058
To nurture it.

558
00:44:27,129 --> 00:44:28,528
To believe in it.

559
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:31,065
But how? How?

560
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,101
I need your help, Master.

561
00:44:33,168 --> 00:44:36,865
No, you just need to believe.

562
00:44:37,572 --> 00:44:39,870
Promise me, Shifu.

563
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:43,171
Promise me you will believe.

564
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:46,806
I will try.

565
00:44:47,649 --> 00:44:49,139
Good.

566
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:53,378
My time has come.

567
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,959
You must continue your
journey without me.

568
00:45:00,062 --> 00:45:01,757
What are you? Wait!

569
00:45:03,865 --> 00:45:05,162
Master!

570
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,559
You can't leave me!

571
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,967
You must believe.

572
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,502
Master!

573
00:45:46,942 --> 00:45:49,604
Yeah, so I'm like, "Fine,
you may be a wolf,"

574
00:45:49,678 --> 00:45:52,613
you may be the scariest
bandit in Haijin Province...

575
00:45:52,948 --> 00:45:54,779
"...but you're a lousy tipper."

576
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,785
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

577
00:45:58,653 --> 00:46:00,951
I mean, I didn't
actually say that...

578
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:02,756
...but I thought it...

579
00:46:02,824 --> 00:46:04,587
...in my mind.

580
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:07,719
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

581
00:46:08,296 --> 00:46:10,457
Order up! Hope you like it.

582
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:15,598
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

583
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,970
Try my Dad's Secret Ingredient Soup. He
actually knows the secret ingredient.

584
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:22,441
What do you mean?
This is amazing!

585
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,446
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

586
00:46:25,514 --> 00:46:27,414
Tigress, you've got to try this.

587
00:46:27,482 --> 00:46:31,111
It is said that the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font> can survive for months

588
00:46:31,186 --> 00:46:35,987
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo
leaf and the energy of the universe.

589
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,261
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font> yet.

590
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:46,323
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

591
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:53,833
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

592
00:46:56,611 --> 00:47:00,638
Never be the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font> unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

593
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:05,319
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

594
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:08,220
Work hard, panda, and
maybe someday...

595
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,190
...you will have ears like mine.

596
00:47:11,793 --> 00:47:13,192
That's good.

597
00:47:13,795 --> 00:47:17,196
Ears. It's not working for you? I
thought they were pretty good.

598
00:47:17,532 --> 00:47:18,658
It's Shifu!

599
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:21,566
Of course it's Shifu. What
do you think I'm doing?

600
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:24,963
Master Shifu!

601
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:29,704
You think this is funny?

602
00:47:29,778 --> 00:47:32,747
Tai Lung has escaped and
you're acting like children!

603
00:47:32,814 --> 00:47:35,112
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

604
00:47:35,183 --> 00:47:37,549
and you are the only
one who can stop him.

605
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:43,851
And I was saying you
got no sense of humor.

606
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:46,223
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

607
00:47:46,294 --> 00:47:49,127
What? You're serious?
And I have to?

608
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:53,968
Master Oogway will stop
him, like he did before.

609
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:55,559
Oogway cannot!

610
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:57,470
Not anymore.

611
00:47:58,974 --> 00:48:01,670
Our only hope is the
Dragon Warrior.

612
00:48:01,743 --> 00:48:03,370
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

613
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:07,040
Master, let us stop Tai Lung. This
is what you've trained us for.

614
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:10,676
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

615
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:12,344
It is his!

616
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,546
Where'd he go?

617
00:48:20,896 --> 00:48:24,195
You cannot leave! A real
warrior never quits.

618
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:25,824
Watch me.

619
00:48:28,436 --> 00:48:29,528
Come on.

620
00:48:29,604 --> 00:48:33,438
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I
can't even beat you to the stairs.

621
00:48:33,508 --> 00:48:36,500
You will beat him because
you are the Dragon Warrior.

622
00:48:37,312 --> 00:48:40,577
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

623
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:43,641
From the beginning, you've
tried to get rid of me.

624
00:48:43,718 --> 00:48:46,050
Yes! I was.

625
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:51,252
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

626
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:56,058
You're not my master. And
I'm not the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

627
00:48:56,131 --> 00:49:00,465
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

628
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:02,636
Yeah, I stayed.

629
00:49:02,637 --> 00:49:06,403
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

630
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:10,877
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

631
00:49:10,946 --> 00:49:14,177
than it did every day of
my life just being me.

632
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,484
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

633
00:49:19,821 --> 00:49:22,881
...could make me... not me...

634
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,323
...it was you.

635
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,528
The greatest kung fu
teacher in all of China!

636
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:29,187
But I can change you!

637
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:32,791
I can turn you into the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>!
And I will!

638
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:36,860
Come on. Tai Lung is on
his way here right now.

639
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:40,339
Even if it takes him a hundred
years to get here, how are you...

640
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:44,674
...gonna change this
into the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>?

641
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:47,971
How?

642
00:49:49,617 --> 00:49:50,606
How?

643
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:55,850
- How?!
- I don't know!

644
00:50:03,898 --> 00:50:05,456
I don't know.

645
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,270
That's what I thought.

646
00:50:52,914 --> 00:50:55,075
This is what you trained me for.

647
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:03,212
Tigress!

648
00:51:07,462 --> 00:51:09,259
Don't try and stop me.

649
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,524
We're not trying to stop you.

650
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:14,590
What?

651
00:51:14,669 --> 00:51:16,534
We're coming with you!

652
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:33,238
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

653
00:52:34,482 --> 00:52:35,847
No need to explain.

654
00:52:35,917 --> 00:52:40,081
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

655
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:02,704
Don't tell Monkey.

656
00:53:02,777 --> 00:53:05,940
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

657
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:09,006
No, I mean, how did
you get up there?

658
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:11,847
I don't know. I guess that...

659
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:14,485
I don't know. I was
getting a cookie.

660
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:16,456
Yet you are ten feet
off the ground.

661
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:19,824
And you have done
a perfect spilt.

662
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:22,863
No, this? This is just...

663
00:53:23,598 --> 00:53:24,929
...an accident.

664
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,230
There are no accidents.

665
00:53:32,307 --> 00:53:33,365
Come with me.

666
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:44,818
I know you're trying to be all
mystical and kung fuey...

667
00:53:44,886 --> 00:53:47,616
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

668
00:53:57,532 --> 00:54:00,000
You dragged me...

669
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:01,835
...all the way out here...

670
00:54:01,836 --> 00:54:03,167
...for a bath?

671
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:08,139
Panda...

672
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:11,838
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

673
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:14,105
The Pool of...

674
00:54:14,182 --> 00:54:16,776
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

675
00:54:16,851 --> 00:54:19,046
...of harmony and focus.

676
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,645
This is the birthplace...

677
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:22,985
...of kung fu.

678
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:39,235
Do you want to learn kung fu?

679
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:40,296
Yeah!

680
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:43,640
Then I am your master!

681
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,474
OK!

682
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:47,906
Don't cry.

683
00:54:47,982 --> 00:54:49,313
OK.

684
00:54:55,056 --> 00:54:57,047
When you focus on kung fu,

685
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,252
when you concentrate...

686
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,861
...you stink.

687
00:55:00,862 --> 00:55:02,762
Perhaps that is my fault.

688
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:06,288
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

689
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:09,461
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

690
00:55:09,537 --> 00:55:10,834
...is with this.

691
00:55:10,905 --> 00:55:13,669
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

692
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:15,633
Good.

693
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,406
When you have been
trained, you may eat.

694
00:55:19,847 --> 00:55:21,007
Let us begin.

695
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:32,811
After you, panda.

696
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:34,855
Just like that?

697
00:56:34,922 --> 00:56:38,585
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

698
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:43,153
I vowed to train you, and you have been trained.
You are free to eat.

699
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:50,161
Enjoy.

700
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,172
Hey!

701
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:56,369
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

702
00:56:57,712 --> 00:56:59,179
Hey!

703
00:57:05,453 --> 00:57:07,421
You are free to eat.

704
00:57:07,488 --> 00:57:09,388
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

705
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:37,300
I'm not hungry.

706
00:58:40,915 --> 00:58:42,109
Master.

707
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:13,543
Out it!

708
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:32,562
Where's the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>?

709
00:59:32,633 --> 00:59:35,625
How do you know you're
not looking at her?

710
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:37,898
You think I'm a fool?

711
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:41,601
I know you're not the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.
None of you!

712
00:59:41,676 --> 00:59:44,941
I heard how he fell out of
the sky in a ball of fire.

713
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:49,449
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

714
00:59:49,517 --> 00:59:55,114
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

715
00:59:55,189 --> 00:59:58,283
Finally, a worthy opponent.

716
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:00,850
Our battle will be legendary!

717
01:00:20,848 --> 01:00:22,543
We've got this. Help her.

718
01:00:47,174 --> 01:00:48,163
Monkey!

719
01:00:48,242 --> 01:00:50,073
Go!

720
01:00:50,144 --> 01:00:51,338
What was I thinking?!

721
01:01:01,756 --> 01:01:02,780
Mantis!

722
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:09,462
Now!

723
01:01:55,376 --> 01:01:57,674
Shifu taught you well.

724
01:02:00,648 --> 01:02:02,582
But he didn't teach
you everything.

725
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:08,177
You have done well, panda.

726
01:02:08,255 --> 01:02:11,952
Done well? Done well?

727
01:02:12,026 --> 01:02:13,323
I've done awesome!

728
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:18,226
The Mark of a true
hero is humility.

729
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,995
But, yes, you have done...

730
01:02:21,602 --> 01:02:22,933
...awesome.

731
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:33,510
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

732
01:02:33,581 --> 01:02:37,017
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

733
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:39,075
We were no match for
his nerve attach.

734
01:02:39,153 --> 01:02:41,383
He's gotten stronger.

735
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:43,753
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

736
01:02:44,959 --> 01:02:45,948
He's too fast!

737
01:02:46,026 --> 01:02:47,584
Sorry, Po.

738
01:02:49,663 --> 01:02:51,221
I thought we could stop him.

739
01:02:51,298 --> 01:02:53,129
He could have killed you.

740
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,258
Why didn't he?

741
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:58,738
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

742
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:03,176
It might. I mean, a little.

743
01:03:03,177 --> 01:03:04,405
I'm pretty scared.

744
01:03:04,478 --> 01:03:05,968
You can defeat him, panda!

745
01:03:06,046 --> 01:03:08,981
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

746
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:12,041
They're five masters.
I'm just one me.

747
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:15,486
But you will have the one
thing that no one else does.

748
01:03:20,828 --> 01:03:23,319
You really believe I'm ready?

749
01:03:23,397 --> 01:03:25,058
You are...

750
01:03:25,132 --> 01:03:26,429
...Po.

751
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:18,943
Behold the <font color="yellow">Dragon Scroll</font>.

752
01:04:19,019 --> 01:04:20,953
It is yours.

753
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:23,956
Wait. What happens
when I read it?

754
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:28,051
Legend says you will be able to
hear a butterfly's wing beat.

755
01:04:28,128 --> 01:04:30,358
Really? That's cool.

756
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:33,264
Yes. And see light
in the deepest cave.

757
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:36,235
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

758
01:04:36,904 --> 01:04:38,337
Can I punch through walls?

759
01:04:38,405 --> 01:04:40,771
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

760
01:04:40,841 --> 01:04:42,035
- Will I?
- Focus.

761
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:43,842
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

762
01:04:43,911 --> 01:04:46,812
Read it, Po, and
fulfill your destiny.

763
01:04:46,881 --> 01:04:49,076
Read it and become...

764
01:04:49,149 --> 01:04:50,878
...the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

765
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,224
It's impossible to open.

766
01:05:00,194 --> 01:05:03,425
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

767
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:07,293
Thank you.

768
01:05:07,368 --> 01:05:09,768
I probably loosened
it up for you though.

769
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:12,595
OK, here goes.

770
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:26,279
- It's blank.
- What?!

771
01:05:26,353 --> 01:05:29,948
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

772
01:05:35,663 --> 01:05:38,530
Blank. I don't...

773
01:05:38,632 --> 01:05:40,793
I don't understand.

774
01:05:42,102 --> 01:05:44,798
OK. So, like...

775
01:05:44,872 --> 01:05:48,103
...Oogway was just a crazy
old turtle after all.

776
01:05:48,175 --> 01:05:50,769
No. Oogway was
wiser than us all.

777
01:05:50,844 --> 01:05:54,905
Oh, come on! Face it, he
picked me by accident.

778
01:05:54,982 --> 01:05:59,112
Of course I'm not the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.
Who am I kidding?

779
01:06:00,154 --> 01:06:01,849
But who will stop Tai Lung?

780
01:06:01,922 --> 01:06:04,413
He'll destroy everything
and everyone.

781
01:06:04,491 --> 01:06:06,152
No.

782
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:11,989
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

783
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:14,466
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

784
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:17,231
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

785
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:18,771
for everyone to escape.

786
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:21,273
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

787
01:06:21,342 --> 01:06:24,175
Then I will finally have
paid for my mistake.

788
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:27,238
Listen to me, all of you.

789
01:06:27,314 --> 01:06:30,841
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

790
01:06:30,918 --> 01:06:33,910
I am very proud to
have been your master.

791
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:57,074
We've got to get
them out safely.

792
01:06:57,144 --> 01:06:59,476
Come, little one.
Let's find your mama.

793
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,116
Viper, gather the Southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

794
01:07:03,117 --> 01:07:04,880
Orange, light the way.

795
01:07:23,937 --> 01:07:26,963
Look, it's the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

796
01:07:35,682 --> 01:07:37,081
Hey, Dad.

797
01:07:37,684 --> 01:07:38,981
Po!

798
01:07:44,892 --> 01:07:46,985
Good to have you back, son.

799
01:07:49,463 --> 01:07:50,953
Good to be back.

800
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:52,658
Let's go, Po.

801
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:58,002
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

802
01:07:58,272 --> 01:08:01,764
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

803
01:08:02,109 --> 01:08:04,202
...no longer slices.

804
01:08:04,278 --> 01:08:07,714
Also, I was thinking,
maybe this time

805
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:10,944
we'll have a kitchen you
can actually stand up in.

806
01:08:12,252 --> 01:08:13,446
You like that?

807
01:08:19,593 --> 01:08:24,189
Po, I'm sorry if things
didn't work out.

808
01:08:24,264 --> 01:08:27,290
It just wasn't meant to be.

809
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:33,262
Po, forget everything else.

810
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:35,535
Your destiny still awaits.

811
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:40,376
We are noodle folk. Broth
runs deep through our veins.

812
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:42,745
I don't know, Dad.

813
01:08:42,816 --> 01:08:46,809
Honestly, sometimes I can't
believe I'm actually your son.

814
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:51,282
Po...

815
01:08:51,358 --> 01:08:55,795
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

816
01:08:55,863 --> 01:08:57,922
...a long time ago.

817
01:08:57,998 --> 01:08:59,727
OK.

818
01:09:01,101 --> 01:09:05,231
The secret ingredient of
my Secret Ingredient Soup.

819
01:09:07,975 --> 01:09:12,605
Come here. The secret
ingredient is...

820
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:13,668
...nothing.

821
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:17,583
You heard me. Nothing!

822
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:20,119
There is no secret ingredient!

823
01:09:20,187 --> 01:09:23,247
Wait, wait. It's just
plain old noodle soup?

824
01:09:23,323 --> 01:09:26,190
You don't add some kind of
special sauce or something?

825
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,663
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

826
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:43,832
There is no secret ingredient.

827
01:10:06,433 --> 01:10:09,231
I have come home, Master.

828
01:10:09,303 --> 01:10:12,568
This is no longer your home. And
I am no longer your master.

829
01:10:12,639 --> 01:10:16,575
Oh, yes. You have
a new favorite.

830
01:10:16,643 --> 01:10:19,737
So where is this Po?

831
01:10:21,181 --> 01:10:22,409
Did I scare him off?

832
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:24,814
This battle is
between you and me.

833
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:29,656
So, that is how
it's going to be.

834
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:31,748
That is how it must be.

835
01:10:45,906 --> 01:10:50,468
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

836
01:10:50,544 --> 01:10:52,910
Obeying your master
is not weakness!

837
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,778
You knew I was the
<font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

838
01:10:55,849 --> 01:10:58,010
You always knew.

839
01:10:58,085 --> 01:11:03,022
But when Oogway said
otherwise, what did you do?

840
01:11:04,157 --> 01:11:06,682
What did you do?!

841
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:10,355
Nothing!

842
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:13,263
You were not meant to be the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>!
That was not my fault!

843
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:15,301
Not your fault?!

844
01:11:15,369 --> 01:11:17,428
Who filled my head with dreams?!

845
01:11:17,504 --> 01:11:19,734
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

846
01:11:19,806 --> 01:11:22,536
Who denied me my destiny?!

847
01:11:31,785 --> 01:11:34,379
It was never my
decision to make!

848
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:41,157
It is now.

849
01:11:46,233 --> 01:11:49,999
Give me the scroll!

850
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:51,298
I would rather die.

851
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:44,549
All I ever did, I did
to make you proud!

852
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:47,216
Tell me how proud
you are, Shifu!

853
01:12:48,195 --> 01:12:49,685
Tell me!

854
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:51,959
Tell me!

855
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:05,642
I have... I have always
been proud of you.

856
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:10,113
From the first
moment, I've been...

857
01:13:10,183 --> 01:13:12,481
...proud of you.

858
01:13:12,552 --> 01:13:14,918
And it was my pride...

859
01:13:14,988 --> 01:13:17,013
...that blinded me.

860
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:20,651
I loved you too much to see
what you were becoming...

861
01:13:21,661 --> 01:13:23,925
...what I...

862
01:13:23,997 --> 01:13:25,988
...was turning you into.

863
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,768
I'm...

864
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:29,824
I'm sorry.

865
01:13:38,345 --> 01:13:41,075
I don't want your apology.

866
01:13:41,148 --> 01:13:42,672
I want my scroll!

867
01:13:44,785 --> 01:13:47,117
What?!

868
01:13:47,187 --> 01:13:48,415
Where is it?!

869
01:13:49,423 --> 01:13:54,019
<font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font> has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

870
01:13:55,162 --> 01:13:58,290
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

871
01:13:58,365 --> 01:13:59,696
Never.

872
01:14:00,634 --> 01:14:01,623
Never.

873
01:14:08,575 --> 01:14:09,872
Stairs.

874
01:14:12,312 --> 01:14:14,109
Who are you?

875
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:19,209
Buddy, I am the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

876
01:14:22,222 --> 01:14:23,553
You?

877
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:26,492
Him? He's a panda.

878
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,428
You're a panda. What are you
gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

879
01:14:30,497 --> 01:14:32,431
Don't tempt me.

880
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:36,526
No. I'm gonna use this.

881
01:14:36,603 --> 01:14:38,230
You want it? Come and get it.

882
01:14:39,973 --> 01:14:41,270
Finally!

883
01:15:07,234 --> 01:15:08,701
That scroll is mine!

884
01:16:02,455 --> 01:16:03,479
Lightning!

885
01:16:38,692 --> 01:16:40,683
The scroll has given him power!

886
01:16:41,328 --> 01:16:42,886
No!

887
01:17:19,366 --> 01:17:23,302
Finally! Oh, yes.

888
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:28,239
The power of the
Dragon Scroll is mine!

889
01:17:32,545 --> 01:17:34,570
It's nothing!

890
01:17:36,549 --> 01:17:39,143
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

891
01:17:39,919 --> 01:17:40,943
What?

892
01:17:42,188 --> 01:17:43,985
There is no secret ingredient.

893
01:17:47,527 --> 01:17:48,755
It's just you.

894
01:17:58,538 --> 01:17:59,596
Stop it!

895
01:17:59,673 --> 01:18:01,436
I'm gonna pee.

896
01:18:03,009 --> 01:18:04,636
Don't.

897
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:06,372
Don't! Don't!

898
01:19:13,646 --> 01:19:15,443
You...

899
01:19:15,515 --> 01:19:17,745
...can't defeat me.

900
01:19:22,188 --> 01:19:23,416
You...

901
01:19:24,758 --> 01:19:26,555
...you're just a big...

902
01:19:26,626 --> 01:19:28,218
...fat...

903
01:19:28,294 --> 01:19:29,283
...panda!

904
01:19:30,263 --> 01:19:33,391
I'm not a big fat panda.

905
01:19:33,466 --> 01:19:35,764
I'm the big fat panda.

906
01:19:38,037 --> 01:19:39,470
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

907
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:40,972
Oh, you know this hold?

908
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,999
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

909
01:19:45,078 --> 01:19:46,773
Nope.

910
01:19:46,846 --> 01:19:49,041
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

911
01:20:09,569 --> 01:20:10,797
Look!

912
01:20:11,838 --> 01:20:13,931
The <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

913
01:20:41,401 --> 01:20:46,270
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

914
01:20:48,341 --> 01:20:49,433
Yes!

915
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,268
Thanks, Dad.

916
01:21:01,554 --> 01:21:02,953
Hey, guys.

917
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:09,025
Master.

918
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:10,528
Master.

919
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:15,196
Master?

920
01:21:15,268 --> 01:21:16,735
Master Shifu!

921
01:21:29,782 --> 01:21:31,147
Master!

922
01:21:31,217 --> 01:21:33,310
Shifu, are you OK?!

923
01:21:35,688 --> 01:21:37,087
Po.

924
01:21:37,156 --> 01:21:39,090
You're alive.

925
01:21:39,158 --> 01:21:40,386
Or we're both dead.

926
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:44,396
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

927
01:21:44,464 --> 01:21:45,590
You did?

928
01:21:49,869 --> 01:21:55,603
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

929
01:21:55,675 --> 01:21:59,167
You are the <font color="red">Dragon Warrior</font>.

930
01:21:59,913 --> 01:22:02,381
You have brought peace...

931
01:22:02,448 --> 01:22:05,212
...to this valley...

932
01:22:05,285 --> 01:22:07,480
...and...

933
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:09,180
...and to me.

934
01:22:09,255 --> 01:22:10,517
Thank you.

935
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:15,589
Thank you, Po.

936
01:22:15,662 --> 01:22:18,256
Thank you. Thank you.

937
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:28,764
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

938
01:22:28,841 --> 01:22:31,571
I'm not dying, you idiot!

939
01:22:31,644 --> 01:22:33,612
Dragon Warrior...

940
01:22:34,881 --> 01:22:39,716
...I am simply at peace.
Finally.

941
01:22:42,455 --> 01:22:45,390
So, I should stop talking?

942
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:47,719
If you can.

943
01:23:05,812 --> 01:23:07,404
Want to get something to eat?

944
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,175
Yeah.

945
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:16,800

946
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:20,591
Everybody is kung fu fighting.

947
01:23:21,427 --> 01:23:24,760
Your mind becomes
fast as lightning.

948
01:23:25,765 --> 01:23:29,098
Although the future is a
little bit frightening.

949
01:23:30,269 --> 01:23:33,761
It's the book of your
life that you're writing.

950
01:23:36,876 --> 01:23:39,936

It's the book of your
life that you're writing.

953
01:23:54,961 --> 01:23:57,156
You are a natural.

955
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:59,460
Why is that so hard to see?

956
01:23:59,565 --> 01:24:03,735
Maybe it's just because You
keep on looking at me.

957
01:24:03,736 --> 01:24:07,832
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know.

958
01:24:07,907 --> 01:24:11,809
But sometimes you've got to
go And be your own hero.

959
01:24:11,878 --> 01:24:14,813
Everybody is kung fu fighting.

960

It's the book of your
life that you're writing.

963
01:24:29,829 --> 01:24:34,129
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of Clay.

964
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,296
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way.

965
01:24:38,371 --> 01:24:42,171
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend.

966
01:24:42,241 --> 01:24:46,610
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win.

967
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:49,807
'Cause everybody is
kung fu fighting.
