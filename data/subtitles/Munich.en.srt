1
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,739
Best place we went to
since we've been here.

2
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,109
Definitely, man.

3
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,909
Way to go, buddy.
Brother.

4
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,281
You guys coming back
to my place?
All right. Let's go.

5
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,914
Hey!

6
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,057
Shame, shame.
Closing down the beer garden.

7
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,793
Hundred-meter dash
powered by knackwurst
and lager.

8
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,000
Where are you guys from?

9
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,063
What's your event?

10
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,905
They don't speak English,
man.

11
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:53,042
Let's help them over.
Come on. Up?

12
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,641
Here you go.

13
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,114
Let's go.
I got you. Come on.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,885
Up. Yeah. All right?

15
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,256
You guys take care.
See you.

16
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,063
Take it easy.
See you.

17
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,068
You're taking
the grade tomorrow.

18
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,831
Watch yourself, man.

19
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,231
<i>I'm Jim McKay</i>
<i>speaking to you live...</i>

20
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,793
<i>at this moment,</i>
<i>from ABC headquarters...</i>

21
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:01,068
<i>just outside</i>
<i>the Olympic village</i>
<i>in Munich, West Germany.</i>

22
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,133
<i>The peace of what</i>
<i>have been called</i>
<i>the "serene Olympics"...</i>

23
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,737
<i>was shattered just before dawn</i>
<i>this morning, about 5:00.</i>

24
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,409
<i>There is</i>
<i>great uncertainty about</i>
<i>how many Israelis...</i>

25
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,748
<i>are being held hostage</i>
<i>in the apartment.</i>

26
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,619
<i>It now appears that</i>
<i>Black September has</i>
<i>tossed a piece of paper...</i>

27
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,021
<i>out the window.</i>
<i>A list of demands.</i>

28
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,687
<i>They want what they call</i>
<i>"the Israeli war machine"...</i>

29
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,596
<i>to release 200 Arabs,</i>
<i>which it insists</i>
<i>are political prisoners...</i>

30
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,930
<i>or the hostages</i>
<i>will be killed.</i>

31
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,326
<i>The terrorist communiqué ends</i>
<i>with an appeal...</i>

32
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,497
<i>for revolutionaries</i>
<i>of the world to unite.</i>

33
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:37,632
<i>This is</i>
<i>building number 31.</i>
<i>At this moment...</i>

34
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,540
<i>eight or nine terrified</i>
<i>living human beings...</i>

35
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,514
<i>are being held prisoner.</i>

36
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:47,110
<i>The demands have been many...</i>
<i>There's someone right now.</i>

37
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,718
<i>This certainly has to be</i>
<i>one of the guerrillas.</i>

38
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,055
<i>A man with a stocking mask</i>
<i>on his face. Weird.</i>

39
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,223
<i>What's going on inside</i>
<i>that head and that mind?</i>

40
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,197
<i>Just a short</i>
<i>while ago, there was...</i>

41
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,199
<i>another in this long series</i>
<i>of negotiations.</i>

42
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,795
<i>The spokesman for the group</i>
<i>came out, spoke, went back.</i>

43
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,569
<i>It seems to be a process</i>
<i>of speak and consultation.</i>

44
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,509
<i>Does it mean</i>
<i>it's all right? Or does</i>
<i>it mean it's all over?</i>

45
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,069
<i>Come and get us.</i>

46
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,810
<i>As Peter Jennings indicated,</i>
<i>the German army...</i>

47
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:20,341
<i>because of very</i>
<i>complicated laws...</i>

48
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,250
<i>would not be allowed</i>
<i>to participate.</i>

49
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,519
<i>And there you see an athlete</i>
<i>holding a canvas bag...</i>

50
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,617
<i>in which is obviously</i>
<i>a machine gun.</i>

51
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,526
<i>Peter Jennings, once again,</i>
<i>is stationed...</i>

52
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,894
<i>inside the Olympic village.</i>
<i>With the naked eye, Peter...</i>

53
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,363
<i>what do you see now?</i>

54
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,334
<i>Jim, there are</i>
<i>now a great many...</i>

55
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,930
<i>maybe a dozen already,</i>
<i>of those security men...</i>

56
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,237
<i>in athletic uniforms.</i>

57
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,721
Stop!

58
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,233
<i>It now</i>
<i>appears that the siege</i>
<i>of the apartment building...</i>

59
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,394
<i>where the hostages</i>
<i>are being held has</i>
<i>been called off...</i>

60
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,437
<i>and the German police</i>
<i>are retreating from the area.</i>

61
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,495
<i>Officials seem to have decided</i>
<i>to abandon their plans...</i>

62
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,735
<i>when the leader</i>
<i>of the fedayeen came</i>
<i>out of the building...</i>

63
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,367
<i>and demanded</i>
<i>they call off the siege...</i>

64
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,002
<i>pointing out</i>
<i>that the entire operation...</i>

65
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,170
<i>was being watched</i>
<i>on a television set...</i>

66
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,302
<i>within the apartment.</i>

67
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,779
<i>Apparently, new demands</i>
<i>have been made to move</i>
<i>the fedayeen...</i>

68
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,944
<i>and their hostages,</i>
<i>though it isn't yet known...</i>

69
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,485
<i>when or where</i>
<i>this might occur.</i>

70
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,646
<i>This is Peter.</i>
<i>Do you have something...</i>

71
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,519
<i>to report to us</i>
<i>from where you are?</i>

72
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,185
<i>This is Cosell.</i>
<i>I certainly do, Peter.</i>

73
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:37,321
<i>We have an immense flurry</i>
<i>of action here.</i>

74
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:41,891
<i>Suddenly, in the whole area</i>
<i>between building 20</i>
<i>and building 12...</i>

75
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,194
<i>they have been clearing</i>
<i>out cars.</i>

76
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,331
<i>Obviously wary of an assault</i>
<i>from the German police...</i>

77
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,920
<i>... within</i>
<i>five minutes.</i>

78
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,581
<i>What I'm hearing</i>
<i>from here is that...</i>

79
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:08,185
<i>they're heading to an airport</i>
<i>called Fürstenfeldbruck.</i>

80
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,928
<i>... says the chopper</i>
<i>just landed...</i>

81
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,327
<i>at the back</i>
<i>of the Olympic village here.</i>

82
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,127
<i>Can you see gate number seven?</i>

83
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,963
<i>This is Vance Kolvig.</i>
<i>What I have seen are...</i>

84
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,800
<i>four hostages</i>
<i>in one helicopter...</i>

85
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:22,204
<i>and it looks like</i>
<i>five hostages in</i>
<i>the first helicopter.</i>

86
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,175
<i>Yes, I just got back</i>
<i>a little while ago...</i>

87
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,302
<i>and it was obvious</i>
<i>that something...</i>

88
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,745
<i>quite serious</i>
<i>was going on out there.</i>

89
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,214
<i>Here we are,</i>
<i>outside the gates.</i>
<i>There are armored cars...</i>

90
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,305
<i>police cars...</i>

91
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,884
<i>Police are pouring in through</i>
<i>the gates with lights</i>
<i>flashing...</i>

92
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,218
<i>and here come some more.</i>
<i>Five, six, here comes</i>
<i>another one.</i>

93
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,622
<i>Seven armored cars</i>
<i>have gone in through</i>
<i>the gates now.</i>

94
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,387
<i>They're mounting</i>
<i>a major invasion.</i>

95
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,793
<i>The latest word we get</i>
<i>from the airport is that...</i>

96
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,093
<i>quote, "all hell has broken</i>
<i>loose out there. "</i>

97
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,550
<i>It's just arrived, Peter.</i>
<i>The bus has arrived...</i>

98
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,677
<i>to the helicopters.</i>
<i>We have reports now...</i>

99
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,415
<i>that all the hostages,</i>
<i>all nine hostages are safe.</i>

100
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:14,850
<i>We repeat, we have confirmed,</i>
<i>it's just past 1:00 a.m.</i>

101
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,656
<i>The fighting ceased</i>
<i>at midnight.</i>

102
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,788
<i>Well, that's at least 24</i>
<i>we've seen go in...</i>

103
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,355
<i>and now we can see</i>
<i>the lights flashing...</i>

104
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,096
<i>There was a terrible</i>
<i>battle at the airport,</i>
<i>but the hostages...</i>

105
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,694
<i>somehow the hostages are safe.</i>

106
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,297
<i>And,</i>
<i>according to these reports,</i>
<i>all Arab terrorists...</i>

107
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,103
<i>have died by German gunfire.</i>

108
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,202
<i>Originally it was said</i>
<i>that the hostages were safe...</i>

109
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,373
<i>but now that has been changed.</i>

110
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,644
<i>An Olympic spokesman</i>
<i>said that...</i>

111
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,743
<i>Of the areas</i>
<i>in the world, this is one</i>
<i>of the areas...</i>

112
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,558
<i>They've spent their youth,</i>
<i>their young people...</i>

113
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,061
<i>they've spent all their money</i>
<i>on wars.</i>

114
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,859
<i>Now they have a chance</i>
<i>to build their nations.</i>
<i>These nations...</i>

115
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,525
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>they're compatible.</i>
<i>The Arabs and the Israelis...</i>

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,432
<i>are perfectly compatible</i>
<i>as far as I can tell.</i>

117
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,334
<i>And now, as you say, Peter,</i>
<i>you're quite right.</i>

118
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,634
<i>They've been jolted apart</i>
<i>again, as they were...</i>

119
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,573
<i>seeming to come just a little</i>
<i>closer. Little hope.</i>

120
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,111
<i>We've just gotten</i>
<i>the final word.</i>
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

121
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,773
<i>my father used to say</i>
<i>our greatest hopes</i>
<i>and our worst fears...</i>

122
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:12,341
<i>are seldom realized.</i>
<i>Our worst fears have</i>
<i>been realized tonight.</i>

123
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,251
<i>They've now said</i>
<i>that there were</i>
<i>11 hostages.</i>

124
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,812
<i>Two were killed</i>
<i>in their rooms...</i>

125
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,453
<i>yesterday morning.</i>

126
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,892
<i>Nine were killed</i>
<i>at the airport tonight.</i>

127
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,755
<i>They're all gone.</i>

128
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,092
<i>... before a quiet</i>
<i>crowd of 80,000.</i>

129
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,331
<i>After the ceremony,</i>
<i>the surviving team...</i>

130
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,397
<i>saw the coffins</i>
<i>of their fallen comrades...</i>

131
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:37,238
<i>loaded onto an airplane</i>
<i>to bring them home together.</i>

132
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,904
<i>Enormous crowds also gathered</i>
<i>on Dizengoff Street...</i>

133
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,380
<i>and in Jerusalem on the plaza</i>
<i>in front of the Knesset.</i>

134
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,177
<i>People are weeping,</i>
<i>tearing their clothes.</i>

135
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,948
<i>The funerals,</i>
<i>which will be held</i>
<i>tomorrow in Jerusalem...</i>

136
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,923
<i>are expected to draw</i>
<i>tens of thousands of mourners.</i>

137
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,460

<i>of the members</i>
<i>of the Israeli team...</i>

138

<i>Israel mourns, of course</i>
<i>everyone says prayers...</i>

163
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,206
<i>for the people...</i>

164
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,116
I tried not to think
about you, but I couldn't.

165
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,986
<i>... a very private,</i>
<i>terrible grief in the days</i>
<i>and years to come.</i>

166
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,351
I have the world's most
boring job. What's going
to happen to me?

167
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,255
Well, they were just athletes.
They went to the Olympics.

168
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,299
Look what happened
to them.

169
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,299
What now?

170
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,138
Now we're going
to have a baby.

171
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,312
Eleven names.

172
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,941
Give us the order,
and we'll begin.

173
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,755
It's the same as Eichmann.

174
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,548
We say to these butchers:

175
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,490
"You didn't want
to share this world with us...

176
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,961
"then we don't have
to share this world with you."

177
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,429
There's legitimacy for this.
Am I correct?

178
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,070
Ambushed
and slaughtered again...

179
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,500
while the rest of the world
is playing games,
Olympic torches...

180
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,376
and brass bands
and dead Jews in Germany.

181
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,109
And the world
couldn't care less.

182
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,278
We've responded.
We sent 70 fighter jets.

183
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,513
A response no one heard.

184
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,148
Air strikes on
guerrilla training centers.
That's a response.

185
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,158
No one notices what happens
in the border camps.

186
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,922
Sixty Arabs dead, at least.
Who knows how many wounded.

187
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,428
This is about fixing
the world's attention.

188
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,091
Well, it's not just
a publicity stunt.

189
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,894
Let me remind you.

190
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,328
Ali Hassan Salameh,
he invented Black September.

191
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,370
He is the architect
of the Munich murders.

192
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,101
These people.

193
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,073
They're sworn to destroy us.

194
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,415
Forget peace for now.

195
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,354
We have to show them
we're strong.

196
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,990
We have laws,
we represent civilization.

197
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,355
Some people say
we can't afford
to be civilized.

198
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,761
I've always resisted
such people.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,230
But I don't know
who these maniacs are...

200
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,293
and where they come from.

201
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,005
Palestinians?

202
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,408
They're not recognizable.

203
00:12:59,513 --> 00:13:02,778
You tell me what law
protects people like these.

204
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,350
Today I'm hearing
with new ears.

205
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,423
Every civilization
finds it necessary...

206
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,222
to negotiate compromises
with its own values.

207
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,962
I've made a decision.

208
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,501
The responsibility
is entirely mine.

209
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,606
Avner?
Yes?

210
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,011
We're going to Jerusalem.
Get in.

211
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,408
Come on, sir.

212
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,124
Hello. I'm General Zamir.

213
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,554
Yes.

214
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,823
You swore us in.

215
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,162
My unit,
when I joined Mossad.

216
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,999
I don't remember you.

217
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,399
Of course, I know your father.

218
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,644
Avner.

219
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,649
It's been...
Two years
since I worked for you.

220
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,383
I remember.
Please, sit down.

221
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,956
Harari.

222
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:25,287
General Nadav.

223
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,692
And General Yariv.

224
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,730
How are you?
How is your father?

225
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,567
He's fine. Thank you.

226
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:37,634
Coffee? It's wonderful
to see you again.

227
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:38,836
Sit.

228
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,042
The chief of the Mossad,
two generals...

229
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,880
and the Prime Minister.
Obviously, it's important.

230
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,421
This is something new.

231
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,058
What happened in Munich
changes everything.

232
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,894
We want to ask you.
Will you undertake
a mission?

233
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,831
An important mission.
You will have to
leave the country...

234
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,201
and your family,
maybe for years.

235
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,207
And it is dangerous.
You can't talk
about it to anyone.

236
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,903
Not even your wife.

237
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,909
Now you should
say something.

238
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,043
Do you have any questions?

239
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,489
So, this isn't about
guarding tourists on
El Al jets?

240
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,595
No questions?

241
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,530
Did we mention
how dangerous it is?

242
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,533
You know, my sister
died on Tuesday.

243
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,200
No, I didn't know that.
Cancer.

244
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,972
I couldn't go
to the athletes'
funerals...

245
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,566
because she died.

246
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,975
That upset people,
but she was my sister.

247
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,039
Family matters.

248
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:59,115
Your wife is pregnant.
Yes, seven months.

249
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,385
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

250
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,524
You were one
of my favorite bodyguards.

251
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:06,292
You know,
I like neat, durable men.

252
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,629
You liked having
the son of a hero around.

253
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,270
Truth be told,
you don't look
much like your father.

254
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,466
No?

255
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,942
Your mother
is who you resemble.

256
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,459
Tomorrow morning.

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,366
If you can't decide
in one day...

258
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,828
you can't decide.

259
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:57,179
Her sister died.

260
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,844
But I think she didn't go
to the athletes' funerals...

261
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,614
because some people
are angry at her...

262
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,281
for not negotiating
with the terrorists.

263
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,587
She didn't go
to the funerals...

264
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,895
because she didn't
want to be booed.

265
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:18,335
It's a good sign
you didn't ask questions.

266
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,804
You'll say yes.

267
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,069
I'm your case officer.
My name is Ephraim.

268
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,602
How late in the pregnancy
before you have to stop
having sex?

269
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,167
Labor.

270
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,987
Don't worry about it.
You won't be around.

271
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,088
Will you?

272
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,190
Whatever they want,
make sure they give
you a raise.

273
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,326
I need things for the baby.

274
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,865
I can't live
with refusing this.

275
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,570
Your mother,
she knew what she was doing.

276
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,805
She abandoned you
on that kibbutz.
She didn't abandon me.

277
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,346
My father was missing.

278
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,747
He was in prison,
she was overwhelmed.

279
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,615
Oh, yes.
She did what
anybody would do.

280
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:44,086
Yeah, so she took you
to the kibbutz
and abandoned you.

281
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,449
Now you think Israel
is your mother.

282
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:55,765
So listen.

283
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,894
I'm going to go along
with this, until I don't.

284
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,208
Do you understand me?
I love you.

285
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,740
I'm not the hero's nice wife.

286
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:20,051
First you resign from Mossad.
Your new contract.

287
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,252
It says we do not employ you,
offer you benefits,
or pensions...

288
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,820
or legal aid
or medical assistance.

289
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,864
It's a contract
that there is no contract.

290
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,537
Do I get a copy?
You don't.

291
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,936
Your pension contribution
refund.

292
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,667
You're now officially
unofficial.

293
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,711
Unemployed and uninsured.

294
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,837
You'll open two accounts...

295
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,213
at the Union de Banques Suisse
in Geneva...

296
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,775
on Rue du Commerce.

297
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,380
Operational funds in one box,
in the other your salary...

298
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,651
which you don't take
till the mission ends...

299
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,420
when you get what accumulates.

300
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,326
Also, for each of your men,
you open an account
for his salary.

301
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,390
How many men do I have
for this...
In the operational funds
box...

302
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:05,267
we will deposit
250,000 American dollars.

303
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,568
You take it out,
we put more in.

304
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,903
I want receipts.

305
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,201
You are not working
for the Baron Rothschild.

306
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,576
You're working for Israel,
a small country.

307
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,174
I'm an old Galicianer
from a mud hut in the Ukraine.

308
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,846
And I don't trust Yekke putzes
let loose in Europe...

309
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,082
with unlimited operational
expenses.

310
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,625
I was born in Israel.
I'm not a Yekke.

311
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,355
Where is your grandpa from?
Frankfurt.

312
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,421
You're a Yekke.

313
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,791
Your wife receives monthly
$1,000 in her bank account.

314
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,626
Also, we leave
messages in the box
with the operational funds.

315
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,534
You can leave messages
for us.

316
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:46,373
But there shouldn't be
messages.
I don't care about that.

317
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,676
Bring me receipts,
you got me?
I got you.

318
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,884
Whatever you are doing,
somebody else is paying
for it.

319
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,423
We have 11 Palestinian
names.

320
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,518
Each had a hand
in planning Munich.

321
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,428
You're going to kill them,
11 men, one by one.

322
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:06,759
They're all in Europe now.

323
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,299
You'll stay there
as long as it takes.

324
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,461
Europe only,
not the Arab countries.
That's for us, not you.

325
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,698
And not Eastern Bloc.
Don't upset the Russians.

326
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,205
Who needs it?

327
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,539
You'll have no contact
with us.

328
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,435
You're not going to give me
any information?

329
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,948
We deposit money
from a fund that
doesn't exist...

330
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:27,076
into a box we don't
know about, in a bank
we never set foot in.

331
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,712
We can't help you because
we never heard of you before.

332
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,483
You'll do what
the terrorists do.

333
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:34,822
You think they report back
to home base? They don't.

334
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,052
We want them dead.

335
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,365
Nothing better than
eating something sweet
by the sea.

336
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,333
You can ask questions now.

337
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,369
Am I alone?
Four others.

338
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,538
They know useful things
like cars, documents...

339
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:48,868
cleanup to make sure
you don't...

340
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,101
accidentally
drop your fake passport...

341
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,042
next to the dead body.
You're the team leader.

342
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,377
Who kills the targets?
You do. Who else?

343
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,118
Use guns if you have to,
but the bombs are preferable.

344
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,246
One of your guys
knows how to make them.

345
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,622
We want everyone to read
in <i>Le Monde</i> some famous
Arab terrorist is dead.

346
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,285
Who knows who blew him up?

347
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,795
Why me?
So what's wrong with you?

348
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,723
I'm not an experienced
field operative.

349
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,198
So I'm not known.
Not even I know you now.

350
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,933
And also, I lived in Frankfurt
when I was a kid...

351
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,304
so I'm a Yekke Jew
who knows his way
around Europe.

352
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,640
That's a good reason.
Here's one more.
You're ordinary.

353
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,737
You aren't a sabra
Charles Bronson.

354
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,542
I am a sabra.
I know.

355
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:32,015
I know so much about you.
You're a nice sabra...

356
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:35,111
with a dog and a baby
on the way. You won't
shoot Spanish bellhops.

357
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,179
No bellhops. No civilians.

358
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:39,587
That kind of trouble
we can't afford.

359
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,058
The hard thing will
not be finding them.

360
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,153
Some of them, anyway,
are not so carefully hidden.

361
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,663
The hard thing will be
not punishing yourselves...

362
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,098
by getting caught
or getting killed.

363
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,829
You want the last piece
of baklava?
No.

364
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,065
Smart decision.
You should avoid sweets.

365
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,472
After all, you just signed
away your dental insurance.

366
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,903
<i>This is</i>
<i>Pierre Bouchet,</i>
<i>your captain, speaking.</i>

367
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,576
<i>Welcome aboard Flight SA 74</i>
<i>direct to Geneva.</i>

368
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,950
<i>We are now at a cruising</i>
<i>altitude of 30,000 feet...</i>

369
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,421
<i>and we wish you</i>
<i>a pleasant flight.</i>

370
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,469
Don't shoot.
I don't understand
what you're saying.

371
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,895
Easy, easy, easy.

372
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,973
Press the buzzer
when you're done.

373
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,692
Have a nice day.
Thank you.

374
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,932
I'm not good at it.
No.

375
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,372
Hebrew?
No.

376
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,568
A team leader who cooks.
What a luxury.

377
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,942
Years in the kibbutz kitchen.
You've done this before?

378
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,309
Done what?

379
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,006
Sit. Come on.

380
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,315
Because I joined Mossad
10 minutes ago, and I'm...

381
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:06,116
Look, I want to kill
every one of these pigs,
but...

382
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,386
Thank you.

383
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,156
So, some of you have training
in this kind of...

384
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,323
He sells antiques.
Right here in Frankfurt.

385
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,195
It's a front,
but successful.

386
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,258
I'm a documents
and identities specialist...

387
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,998
with a sharp eye
for early Danish Modern.

388
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,067
And you?

389
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,334
Oh, I make toys.

390
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,703
I thought you made bombs.
Toys, in Brussels.

391
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,406
For bombs,
I had to go to night school.

392
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,681
My wife's expecting.

393
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,413
<i>Mazel tov.</i>
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

394
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,011
Beautiful. When?
Couple of months.

395
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:40,116
Think we'll be done
by then?

396
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,217
Is it Ali Hassan Salameh
we're after?

397
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,760
I mean, that's the job,
right?

398
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,760
We're here to kill
the guy who planned Munich.
Am I right?

399
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,467
It's strange, isn't it,
to think of oneself
as an assassin?

400
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,978
Think of yourself
as something else then.

401
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:05,507
A soldier in a war.
I mean,
you know how to shoot...

402
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,181
to assassinate people, right?

403
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:11,983
<i>Mazels</i> on the baby,
and all that. That's great.

404
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,390
That's just fantastic.
But, I mean...

405
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,226
You make dolls
in a toy shop...

406
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,394
and you shop for sofas...

407
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:24,564
and you,
I don't know what you do.

408
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,832
Me? I worry.

409
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,106
So, why'd they make you
team leader?

410
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,804
Because he really knows
how to cook a brisket.

411
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:01,700
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Andreas.</i>

412
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,371
<i>Surprised?</i>
<i>Surprised?</i>
<i>You punched me.</i>

413
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,433
<i>You broke my jaw, man.</i>
<i>That was 10 years ago.</i>

414
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,707
<i>And you were sleeping</i>
<i>with my girlfriend.</i>

415
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,714
<i>Listen, I'm in town.</i>
<i>Are you around?</i>

416
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,614
<i>Yeah, actually,</i>
<i>I'm here with</i>
<i>my girlfriend.</i>

417
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,118
<i>Do you want to come over?</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>

418
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,509
She's incredible,
isn't she?

419
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,280
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

420
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,720
I miss you, man.
We really used to
love each other.

421
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,954
That was a long time ago.
We were in high school.

422
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,294
I have some names.

423
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,894
Some people I need to find
for my rich American friends.

424
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,339
Give me my money,
Yvonne.

425
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:50,512
One hundred fifty.
One hundred.

426
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:52,075
Cash.

427
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,944
$100,000.

428
00:30:57,623 --> 00:31:00,250
These people I'm looking for,
you don't know them.

429
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,593
We might.
You don't.

430
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,065
But maybe you know someone
who does.

431
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,500
And it's Americans
you work for?

432
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,732
Yes. See?

433
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,929
James Madison.

434
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,568
Americans.

435
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,806
We'll ask some friends.

436
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,210
Hiding?
The Arabs are not hiding.

437
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,647
Munich was a big success
for them.
Oh?

438
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,547
The implications of Munich
for the struggle...

439
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,646
They got everyone's attention.
They're recruiting, making
plans.

440
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,852
Give me a few names.

441
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:40,661
I can't help if I don't know
who you're trying to find.

442
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,496
We'll have to trust.

443
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,660
You have to cross the line.

444
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,929
I trust you. You carry cash
and you don't make speeches.

445
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,907
Nowadays,
everyone makes speeches,
like your friend Andreas.

446
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,604
Talk, talk, talk.

447
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,936
Name me an Arab.

448
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,349
Abu Daoud.

449
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,151
Abu Youssef.

450
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:05,154
Wael Zwaiter.

451
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,624
Kamal Nasser.

452
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,630
Salameh.
Forget Salameh. Too hard.

453
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,564
Wait. Who are these guys?
Why are you trying to find
Arabs?

454
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,157
Sixty thousand per name.
Dollars.

455
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,901
If it's good information.
If it isn't good,
it doesn't cost.

456
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,569
Wael Zwaiter's here,
in Rome.

457
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,608
He just translated
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>
into Italian.

458
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,941
Tomorrow there's a reading.
He's broke.

459
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,775
He has a niece he calls
every day in Damascus.

460
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,115
Are you trying
to join the PLO?

461
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:38,655
We need to talk. Alone.

462
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,423
And also maybe you need people
to help with your work.

463
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,826
Cars. Vans.

464
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:01,410
If you tell anybody
about this, I don't know.

465
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,979
Just don't.

466
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,913
Just don't.

467
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:26,537
Anything you need,
we'll provide.

468
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,796
I need receipts.

469
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,949
Keep talking. Keep talking.

470
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,443
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

471
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,233
Are you Wael Zwaiter?

472
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,668
Yes, and who are you?

473
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,237
Do you know
why we're here?

474
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,981
Are you
Wael Zwaiter?
He said yes already.

475
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:45,717
He already said yes.

476
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:49,916
What are we doing?

477
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:55,833
What do I do?

478
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,231
Do you know why we're here?

479
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,181
What happened?
Why didn't you shoot him?

480
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,815
We shot him.
But I didn't hear a shot.

481
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,757
We shot him eight times,
maybe 10 times.

482
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:25,489
Did you kill him?
He's dead.

483
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,360
He shit his pants.
He's dead.

484
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,840
Drink some wine.
We're celebrating.

485
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,951
That old Pesach story.

486
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,376
The angels are rejoicing...

487
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,947
because the Egyptians
have just drowned
in the Red Sea.

488
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,585
I didn't say we're rejoicing.

489
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,822
I said, "We're celebrating."

490
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,557
And God said to the angels,
"Why are you celebrating?

491
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:38,193
"I've just killed
a multitude of my children."

492
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,760
Mr. Zwaiter.

493
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:45,465
He cost us,
by my calculations,
roughly $352,000.

494
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:50,074
You didn't finish the story.

495
00:40:50,315 --> 00:40:52,373
The angels respond to God.

496
00:40:52,717 --> 00:40:54,445
They say,
"God, we're celebrating...

497
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,146
"because
when the people hear what
happened to the Egyptians...

498
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,746
"they'll understand
your point."

499
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,155
Which was?

500
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,150
Don't fuck with the Jews.

501
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:07,353
I don't know
about the rest of you,
but I'm not celebrating.

502
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,297
I'm goddamn rejoicing.

503
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,563
Here. Put that down.
Put it down. Get up.

504
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,264
No, please.
Come on, dance with me.

505
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,500
Dance with me. Come on.
No.

506
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:18,036
Come on.

507
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,644
Come on. Hey.

508
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,411
This is...
What shall I call you today?

509
00:41:58,382 --> 00:41:59,873
Franz Storsch.

510
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,519
You can call me Louis.

511
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,559
Our service
has been satisfactory?
Pricey.

512
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:15,391
A Jew and a Frenchman.
We could haggle forever,
huh?

513
00:42:15,467 --> 00:42:19,027
I'm not a Jew.
What do you suppose
a ramson is?

514
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:23,204
It's a kind of a wild leek.
Not in season,
but garlic will do.

515
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,875
My papa sometimes loses
track of the seasons.

516
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,969
I know nothing about food.

517
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31,639
Why does he make me shop?

518
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,880
You're wondering
if I'm French Intelligence.

519
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,856
Or CIA or KGB.

520
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,715
Or an agent with a profitable
sideline in information.

521
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,987
I could be anybody.
You could be anybody, too.

522
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,923
Identity.
That's the boring part now.

523
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,561
Here's what isn't boring.

524
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,532
As long as you don't work
for any government...

525
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,371
I'm in private business.
Rich Americans, I heard.

526
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,172
I'm in private business, too.
My family.

527
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:07,175
We can locate almost anyone
for anyone anywhere...

528
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,976
and we are ideologically
promiscuous.

529
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,385
We love everybody,
hate everybody.

530
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,550
I get my feelings confused.

531
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,222
If you're not working
for any government...

532
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,159
we know, or we find...

533
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,460
we don't find, you don't pay.

534
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,865
<i>Initially</i>
<i>it was the intention</i>
<i>of the hijackers...</i>

535
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,336
<i>to bring the Lufthansa</i>
<i>to Munich International</i>
<i>Airport...</i>

536
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,601
<i>and then take onboard</i>
<i>the three prisoners...</i>

537
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,940
<i>at the end of the runway,</i>
<i>where Captain Klausen took</i>
<i>his plane...</i>

538
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,572
<i>while an Arab held</i>
<i>a hand grenade at his head.</i>

539
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,047
Hey, Avner.

540
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,846
A Lufthansa jet was hijacked
coming from Damascus.

541
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,385
The hijackers
demanded the release
of three killers...

542
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,614
who survived Munich...

543
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,987
and the Germans said yes,
instantly.

544
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,255
<i>The Arabs would be flown</i>
<i>by private charter plane</i>
<i>to Zagreb.</i>

545
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,262
Look.
They're free now.

546
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:54,096
They're in Libya.

547
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:04,400
No qualms about rejoicing
on their side, eh?

548
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,806
<i>The Israeli kills the Arabs...</i>

549
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,746
<i>in Egypt, in Jordan,</i>
<i>in Lebanon, in Syria...</i>

550
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,284
Look at them.

551
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,182
They're movie stars.

552
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:20,947
<i>But did you shoot</i>
<i>any of the Israeli</i>
<i>hostages?</i>

553
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:26,630
<i>It's not important to say</i>
<i>if I killed Israelis or not.</i>

554
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,733
We should go to Tripoli.

555
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,297
Kill them.

556
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,195
We don't go
to Arab countries.

557
00:44:32,871 --> 00:44:34,929
We stick to the names
we've been given.

558
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:39,202
Mahmoud Hamshari.

559
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,976
<i>Do you think,</i>
<i>looking back on it now...</i>

560
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,681
<i>that you achieved anything</i>
<i>in the Munich operation?</i>

561
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:55,748
<i>We have made our voice heard</i>
<i>by the world.</i>

562
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,722
<i>Are those your words?</i>

563
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,695
<i>The same thing again.</i>

564
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:06,896
<i>They have made their voice</i>
<i>heard by the universe</i>
<i>or the world...</i>

565
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,938
<i>who has not been hearing</i>
<i>before.</i>

566
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,967
Well, I believe what
he meant by this is...

567
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,775
that now the world
will begin hearing us.

568
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,945
We are, for 24 years,
the world's largest
refugee population.

569
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,114
Our homes taken from us.

570
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,956
Living in camps,
no future, no food.

571
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,360
Nothing decent
for our children.

572
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:36,056
And, so was the attack
in Munich justified?

573
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,869
The PLO condemns
attacks on civilians.

574
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:42,929
Though for 24 years...
Tell your newspaper that.

575
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:46,806
...our civilians have been
attacked by the Israelis
day after day...

576
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:49,847
Tell them about all
the years and years
of Palestinian blood...

577
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,280
spilled by Israel.
And who mourns for us?

578
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,318
You know,
Israel just bombed...

579
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:56,853
two refugee camps
in Syria and Lebanon.

580
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,480
Tell them that...
200 people killed.

581
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,956
Right after Munich
they did this.
It did not begin in Munich.

582
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:05,927
And where does it end?
How will it ever end?

583
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:21,373
I'm sorry,
I need to use your phone.
I need to call my editor.

584
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,038
Yes, yes. Sorry.

585
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,842
You see it.
It's by the window.
Thank you.

586
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,579
This way, please.

587
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,467
This man, we don't know
what he did specifically?

588
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,842
Hamshari arranged
the attempted assassination
of Ben-Gurion...

589
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,643
in Copenhagen
a few years ago.

590
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,478
Now he organizes
for Fatah in France.

591
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,778
He organizes?
Yes.

592
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:43,684
In Tel Aviv they showed you
evidence for this?

593
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,244
Not evidence.
It was more...

594
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,153
this is the story
and I believe them.

595
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:48,748
Why? Don't you?

596
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:51,726
It's a crisis, a war.
You don't have to always...

597
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:54,958
What? Be thinking?
Scrutinize. Yeah, think.

598
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,592
You want to wire Ephraim
and ask for evidence,
you do it.

599
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:59,398
You're on your own.

600
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,934
Okay, I'm done.
Good.

601
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,836
Don't think about it.

602
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:06,501
Okay.

603
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:10,507
So, now, I turn it on.

604
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:15,143
He picks up the phone,
turns on the red light...

605
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:19,213
then I take out the key,
insert it...

606
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,018
and turn.

607
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:27,248
So now we wait
for the red light.

608
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,521
Is the truck
blocking the signal?
No.

609
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,681
Will the remote still work?

610
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,175
Yeah,
it's a powerful transmitter.
Go back to your position.

611
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,871
You can't start improvising
now. Go back to your corner.

612
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,277
Don't worry. It's okay.
It's going to work.

613
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:55,795
Stop!
Stop!

614
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,672
Abort.

615
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,449
Are we on or off?

616
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:05,938
<i>Mahmoud Hamshari?</i>
Yes.

617
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:22,985
He's at the hospital Cochin.

618
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:26,289
I don't know
how badly we hurt him.
They aren't saying.

619
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,092
Why did you put a firecracker
in that phone?

620
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,030
Because I didn't want
to blow up the building.

621
00:54:30,101 --> 00:54:32,592
What do you want from me?
An Arab corpse.

622
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:36,036
Another $200,000, more
or less, to eliminate
target number two.

623
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,632
Yeah, if he's been eliminated.
We should stick with guns.

624
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,677
No one notices a shooting.

625
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,268
Bombs achieve
a double objective.

626
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:44,974
They eliminate targets
and they terrify terrorists.

627
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,483
That only works
when the bombs work.

628
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,744
Lunch?

629
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,394
<i>The Israeli embassy</i>
<i>in London was rocked by</i>
<i>a letter bomb...</i>

630
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,556
<i>shortly after 9:30</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

631
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,065
<i>Dr. Ami Shachori was opening</i>
<i>his morning mail...</i>

632
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:07,262
<i>when the envelope exploded,</i>
<i>killing him instantly.</i>

633
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:11,568
They discovered
seven in a mailroom near
the embassy in Earls Court.

634
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,836
I guess they missed one.
<i>Right after Hanukkah.</i>

635
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:18,672
I guess there was a big pileup
of mail and they got careless.

636
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,048
They found other letters
in Israel, of course.

637
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:26,112
Canada, Argentina, Vienna,
Kinshasa, Paris, Brussels.

638
00:55:26,257 --> 00:55:29,454
Dozens of them, mainly posted
in the Netherlands.

639
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:31,527
It's all Black September.

640
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,927
It's a response, then.

641
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,764
To Hamshari.

642
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,458
And to Zwaiter.

643
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,969
They're talking to us.
We're in dialogue now.

644
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,873
Where are you?

645
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:47,710
I'm in New York,
following a lead.

646
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,771
I'll call again.

647
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,023
Are you going
to visit your father?

648
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:07,054
Why is this taking
so long?

649
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,688
It isn't fast.

650
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,731
We have the best hospitals
in the world.

651
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:16,699
When you were born,
your father was elsewhere.
I was alone.

652
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,534
He was in prison.

653
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,842
Should you be here?

654
00:56:24,248 --> 00:56:25,976
Aren't you on duty?

655
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,108
What are you going to do?
Turn me in?

656
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,251
How is he?

657
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,318
I don't visit
your father so much.

658
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:37,952
Wilma lets him yell at her
all the time.

659
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:39,688
She depresses me.

660
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:46,601
How are you?

661
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:50,702
I'm managing.
Don't worry about me.

662
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,411
I'm proud
of what you are doing.

663
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,211
You don't know
what I'm doing.

664
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:14,353
I look at you and I know
everything I need to know.

665
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:19,059
She is frighteningly
ugly.

666
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,634
She takes after you.

667
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,971
I want you to move,
for a time.

668
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,666
I've arranged a place for us
in Brooklyn.

669
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,974
I can't come back to Israel.
I don't know how long for...

670
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,172
New York?

671
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:34,342
I can see more of you
this way.
New York City?

672
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,288
But I have my family here,
and your parents.

673
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,985
You want my parents
to help raise her?

674
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:46,286
Look what they did to me.

675
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:50,523
Don't you want your daughter
to be an Israeli, Avner?

676
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:54,163
She'll always be an Israeli.

677
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:57,472
Not in Brooklyn.
She'll just be
another homeless Jew.

678
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,974
I can't do what I'm doing
if I can't see you.

679
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:01,773
What are you doing?

680
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:06,378
Don't do it then, Avner.
This is our home.

681
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,315
You're the only home
I ever had.

682
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,278
What?

683
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,617
This is so corny.

684
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:17,092
It wasn't easy for me
to say that.
I bet.

685
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,322
Don't laugh at me then.

686
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:22,159
Why did I have to marry
a sentimentalist?

687
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:24,132
You're ruining my life.

688
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,525
Your mother's teasing me.

689
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:42,284
Look at the waistline bulge
on that guy.

690
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,347
Look at that.
Think he might be armed, eh?

691
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:47,619
As are the Russians.

692
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,222
It's definitely him.

693
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,425
Hussein Abad al-Chir.

694
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:55,523
His room is next to
Israeli newlyweds.

695
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:58,498
They married in Cyprus
because she's not Jewish.

696
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,001
A mixed marriage.

697
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,559
A <i>shande</i> for the <i>goyim.</i>

698
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,902
Yeah, okay.
But let's try not
to blow them up.

699
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,273
The KGB brings him home
every night after dark.

700
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:09,811
He turns on the light,
gets undressed...

701
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,338
turns off the light,
gets into bed,
we blow up the bed.

702
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:18,543
I knew a field agent
who got too scared
to sleep in his bed.

703
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,887
So every night he slept
on the floor of his closet.

704
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:24,588
He still does, every night.

705
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,829
Sleeps in closets.

706
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,956
Now if al-Chir
sleeps in his closet,
we're in trouble.

707
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:33,594
But if he gets in the bed,
his weight arms the device...

708
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,103
it closes the circuit.

709
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:39,407
Then we hit the remote.

710
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,043
Okay.

711
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:50,449
Okay, we're good.
We're good, let's go.

712
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,958
Careful.

713
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:03,523
I've checked into the room
next door.

714
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:07,460
Why?
There are balconies.

715
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:09,699
When he gets into bed...

716
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:12,708
I give the signal
by switching off the light.

717
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:16,311
And if the bomb's too powerful
and you're in the next room?

718
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,806
Well, that won't happen.

719
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,342
Right?

720
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,045
Robert?

721
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:24,313
Robert?
Robert?

722
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:27,056
It won't. No.

723
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,114
Okay.

724
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:31,987
Avner.

725
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:35,664
Boy or girl?

726
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,262
A girl.

727
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:40,800
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

728
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,268
News from Paris.

729
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:50,911
Dr. Hamshari succumbed
to his wounds.

730
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:55,480
So, again, <i>mazel tov,</i> Avner.

731
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:52,132
Steve, shut up.

732
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,753
Hey.

733
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,581
Good evening.

734
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,208
Good evening.

735
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:38,878
Beautiful night.

736
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:40,856
Beautiful night, yeah.

737
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:45,492
Where are you from?
I can't place...
Düsseldorf.

738
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,927
Yes?
I wouldn't have guessed it.

739
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,425
I thought perhaps a Swede.

740
01:02:53,704 --> 01:02:56,570
I taught in Sweden,
Near Eastern languages.

741
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:58,268
Really?

742
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:01,869
Teaching Lebanese
immigrant women
how to clean houses.

743
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,344
In Swedish.

744
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:13,322
Were you here last night?

745
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,782
No. Just checked in.
Just arrived.

746
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:19,990
Don't plan to sleep.

747
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:22,621
They keep at it all night.

748
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:24,860
There, for hours.

749
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:27,333
Take a sleeping pill.
That's okay.

750
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:28,961
I can sleep through anything.
Are you sure?

751
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,233
You don't want to borrow
one of mine?

752
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,967
Thank you very much.
It's okay.
Really?

753
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,099
Yes.

754
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,041
So, good night.

755
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,471
Pleasant dreams.

756
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,353
Wait for the signal.

757
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:29,922
Wait for Avner's light
to go out.

758
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,525
Go! Go! Go!

759
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,576
Oh, my God!
Help!

760
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,019
Oh, my eyes.
My eyes, I can't see.

761
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,085
Can someone help me?

762
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,746
I can't see.

763
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,112
Avner!

764
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,389
Please! Oh, my God!

765
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,431
I can't see.

766
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,831
Can you see?
Yes.

767
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:16,269
The stairs are that way.
Okay.

768
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,570
Go that way.
Come on. Let's go!

769
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,974
<i>It was much too powerful.</i>
<i>Stop it.</i>

770
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,876
<i>You could've blown up</i>
<i>innocent...</i>
<i>Target number three.</i>

771
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,108
<i>Target number three</i>
<i>was not in doubt.</i>

772
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,514
The ceiling
in the lobby cracked.
You nearly demolished...

773
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,108
Avner might have been killed.

774
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,744
The plastique was not
what I asked for.

775
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,516
It couldn't have been
the grade I specified.

776
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:35,614
Someone changed the marking
on the explosive.

777
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:37,659
What if someone changed
the marking?

778
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:39,719
What do you mean?
Louis provided the plastique.

779
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,320
Avner, Louis provided
the explosives?

780
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,889
Yes. Why?
Why are we trusting him?

781
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,793
We have no idea who he is.

782
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:49,867
He's finding our targets.
Yes, but...

783
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,170
But without him,
we'd be nowhere on this!

784
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:55,608
The plastique was
much more powerful
than what I asked for.

785
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:59,181
Someone changed the label.
I could have killed you.

786
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:01,579
For all we know,
Louis works for the PLO.

787
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,119
They're using us to do
internal housecleaning.

788
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:05,242
That's bullshit.

789
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,686
Hey,
whose fishing boat is this?

790
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,192
Louis arranged it.

791
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:50,128
There was nothing wrong
with the explosive.

792
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:53,293
Bomb makers are nervous,
which is understandable.

793
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:54,597
Fear makes them sloppy...

794
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,068
There's nothing wrong
with my bomb maker.

795
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,336
It's your explosives.

796
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:01,876
We found three more
names for you.

797
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,813
Three?
Yes, three.

798
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,349
Thought you'd be pleased.
I am.

799
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:11,844
Who?

800
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:16,456
Kemal Adwan, Kamal Nasser,
and Abu Youssef.

801
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:19,328
Adwan and Abu Youssef.

802
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:21,792
Where?
Lebanon.

803
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:24,327
They're in Beirut.

804
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,595
Adwan, Nasser, Youssef.

805
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,305
Serious characters, huh?

806
01:08:29,372 --> 01:08:31,033
Extremely serious.

807
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,042
Smile, Mr. Storsch.
It's a second Christmas.

808
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,747
I'd like to pay you
a little extra for this.

809
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,476
These three names.

810
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,886
$600,000.

811
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,225
<i>Monsieur</i> Storsch, my group...

812
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,885
we don't care much
for governments...

813
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,429
any governments.

814
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:55,362
We don't work with
or for them.

815
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:57,865
That's an absolute condition
of my theory.

816
01:08:57,934 --> 01:08:59,492
You understand?

817
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:02,560
If I learn that your sudden
generosity was an attempt...

818
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,006
to buy our acquiescence
in your sharing my
information...

819
01:09:06,076 --> 01:09:09,806
with, let us say,
CIA or Ml6 or Mossad...

820
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,905
I don't work for Ml6 or CIA...
You have no idea
who you work for.

821
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:14,176
Trust me. You don't.

822
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:18,820
Lie to me and you will find me
abruptly unreachable...

823
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,887
and unhappy.

824
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:25,286
Let me buy you a drink.
No. You save your money.

825
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,694
At these prices,
you're going to need it.

826
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,029
<i>It's obviously</i>
<i>significant information.</i>

827
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,094
Abu Youssef is like
number three in the whole
Palestinian network.

828
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,099
It's like Arafat, Habash,
and then him.

829
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,141
Of course he's significant.
Thanks for the instruction...

830
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,039
and enthusiasm.
He's the brains
of the fedayeen.

831
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:43,203
I know who he is.
Next to Salameh...

832
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,640
Abu Youssef is the worst guy
we're after, right?

833
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:48,740
And Adwan,
he plans all the actions
in the West Bank, right?

834
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,051
We get the significance.
These are serious targets.

835
01:09:52,122 --> 01:09:53,713
We want to go to Beirut.
No.

836
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,314
You keep away
from the Arab countries.

837
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,757
Mossad and the army
will take care of it.

838
01:09:57,827 --> 01:09:59,795
What is this contraption?

839
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:02,695
You can't send the army.
We won't allow it.

840
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,762
You won't allow it?

841
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,962
Our source doesn't know
we're Mossad.

842
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,436
You aren't Mossad.

843
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:12,134
If commandos go to Beirut,
our source will cut us off.

844
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:15,301
Why don't you
and I go for a walk
and talk about this, alone?

845
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:16,743
The food will get cold.

846
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:18,872
We have to go to Beirut.
We're good at this.

847
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,779
This is our information,
this is our job.

848
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,216
That's touching
in a juvenile sort of way.

849
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:24,844
Listen.
You're doing reasonably well.

850
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:26,649
Reasonably?
You're spending
a lot of money.

851
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:28,155
Well, we expected that.

852
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,551
Lots of people in Mossad
don't know about you.

853
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,163
No one knows.

854
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,891
So everyone's asking,
"Who's killing the fedayeen?

855
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,993
"Is it our guys?
Why weren't we told?"

856
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,230
Big egos. Lots of screaming.

857
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,231
I can maybe include
one or two of you...

858
01:10:46,309 --> 01:10:48,777
but excluding Mossad
or the army is impossible.

859
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:50,176
Accept it.

860
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,577
We will,
but our source won't.

861
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,412
Who is your source?

862
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:57,911
It's time you told me.

863
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:00,012
That, by the way,
is not a request.
It's an order.

864
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,081
You can't order him.
He doesn't work for you.

865
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:04,682
Shut up. I pay you.
You work for me.

866
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:08,024
I work for a metal box
in a bank in Geneva.
The box pays me.

867
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:11,065
You want to find it empty?
I want you to let us
do our work!

868
01:11:11,134 --> 01:11:13,125
What's the matter with you?

869
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:15,966
With all of you?
Grow up and do it quick.

870
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:18,563
This is not a game,
a fucking game.

871
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:21,438
Who has the source?
Where are you getting
your information?

872
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:23,604
Give me his goddamn number!

873
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:26,509
I hope the old lady next door
enjoyed that.

874
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:29,779
She's a little deaf
but I doubt she had
any trouble hearing you.

875
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:35,349
Give me the source
and we'll let you take part.

876
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,587
Let us go to Beirut.

877
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:41,686
After Beirut,
we'll use our source
to find the remaining targets.

878
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,792
Let us do our job.

879
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:30,105
A lot of manpower
to shoot three guys.

880
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,375
Ehud Barak.
Daniel.

881
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:38,270
Go!

882
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:17,114
Where the fuck is he?

883
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,015
Door!

884
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,359
Let's go!
Go!

885
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:32,355
Go! Go!

886
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:35,592
Go!

887
01:15:13,076 --> 01:15:15,510
It's him!
Don't shoot! No!

888
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,091
Fedayeen!

889
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:43,395
Go!

890
01:16:48,304 --> 01:16:51,431
My papa would like
to meet you.
Papa?

891
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,609
My papa.
He runs our little group.

892
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,809
I thought you ran the group.

893
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,306
Everybody works for someone.

894
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,679
I wasn't in Beirut.

895
01:17:03,152 --> 01:17:05,119
Well, someone was there.

896
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:08,645
The Israeli army, according
to every newspaper on Earth.

897
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,453
But you stayed away...

898
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:13,824
after you paid
so extravagantly
for the information.

899
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,556
I don't like to keep
my papa waiting.

900
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:18,860
I need to tell my people
where I'm going.

901
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:20,765
You don't know
where you're going.

902
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:23,738
And you'll need
to wear this.

903
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:26,875
Forget it, Louis.
That's just crazy.

904
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:28,534
We're done here.

905
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:36,144
Shit.

906
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:37,975
Wait!

907
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:40,444
Wait!

908
01:18:26,536 --> 01:18:27,900
We're here.

909
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:49,685
Papa!

910
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:06,262
He's over there.

911
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:21,846
Louis says you're a cook.

912
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:24,015
I know how to cook, yeah.

913
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:25,893
You help me?

914
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:32,994
Bring these there.

915
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:42,506
No, no. Don't wash.
No, no. They will taste
like boiled sponge.

916
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,779
But then why put them
in the sink?

917
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,337
If the juices spurt out,
it's a big mess.

918
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:50,043
The whole kitchen
will smell like piss.

919
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,581
Peel off the fat.

920
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:58,957
Let me see your hands.

921
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,899
Too big for a good cook.

922
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,568
That was my problem, too.
I had been a master...

923
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:10,037
but I have thick, stupid,
butcher's hands just like
yours.

924
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:14,042
Well, we are tragic men.
Butcher's hands, gentle souls.

925
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:30,050
These are going to be
too sour to eat.

926
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:33,591
Skin them and prick them,
boil them in sugar.

927
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:37,627
A little torture,
and you'll see
how nice they are.

928
01:20:38,634 --> 01:20:41,761
You call me "Papa."
I can't do that.

929
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,930
No?
I have a papa already.

930
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:48,007
You are devoted to him?

931
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,942
Am I here because
of what happened
in Beirut?

932
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,503
Your papa must be
proud of his son.

933
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,917
We'll pick a few.
Let the rest ripen.

934
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:00,519
There are so many people
to feed, but...

935
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:02,524
But they are your family.
So you have to feed them.

936
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:05,618
Yes. We don't work
with governments.

937
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:07,721
Louis said. But...

938
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:11,756
But you did
what you did because
you have to feed your family.

939
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,784
I blew up trains,
bridges...

940
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,653
and trucks full of Germans
during the war.

941
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:42,024
My brothers were killed,
my papa and my sister
were both hanged.

942
01:21:43,099 --> 01:21:44,327
She was a young girl.

943
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,836
Papa, the guest doesn't
want to hear your war stories.

944
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:52,301
We paid this price,
so Vichy scum could
be replaced...

945
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:54,206
by Gaullist scum...

946
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:57,804
and the Nazis
could be replaced
by Stalin and America.

947
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,414
We stay away
from governments.

948
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:03,283
We say grace?

949
01:22:03,786 --> 01:22:06,015
Maybe our guest
could lead us.

950
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,359
No, no, no.
It's not required.

951
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:24,166
Our Father, who gives us
obedient and respectful
clients...

952
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:26,875
who obey the rules
according to which
our business thrives...

953
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:32,006
...whose prevarications
and deceptions...

954
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,753
In my despair
I fathered madmen...

955
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:50,722
who dress
like factory workers,
but never do manual labor...

956
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:53,960
and who read nonsense
and spout pompous bullshit...

957
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:57,436
about Algerians
and who love nothing...

958
01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:58,996
not Algerians or French...

959
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,737
or flesh and blood,
or anything living.

960
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:06,444
So I have sympathy
for a man who can say,
"I have a papa"...

961
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:08,341
and who does what he must
for his family.

962
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:16,917
I will say grace.

963
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,059
There's some opinion
you should be punished...

964
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:30,297
for what happened
in Beirut.

965
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:32,596
We didn't know
so many would die.

966
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:36,132
I'm in business with death.
Do you think I'm squeamish?

967
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,945
The world has been rough
with you, with your tribe.

968
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:47,346
It's right to respond roughly
to such treatment.

969
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:53,189
You pay well
and you pay promptly,
so we'll continue together.

970
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:58,094
But no more infractions.
Thank you. You have my word.

971
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:16,975
A few andouillettes
and boudins noirs...

972
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:22,417
black blood sausage
and a Loire cheese,
Selles-sur-Cher.

973
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:26,319
We cover it in ash
to preserve it.
Thank you.

974
01:24:27,863 --> 01:24:29,956
You could have been my son.

975
01:24:32,768 --> 01:24:35,760
But you're not.
Remember that.

976
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:41,233
We'll do business,
but you aren't family.

977
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:32,016
I have a new name for you.

978
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:35,287
I want Ali Hassan Salameh.

979
01:25:38,067 --> 01:25:39,158
No.

980
01:25:40,336 --> 01:25:42,600
You know where he is.
You know where
all the names are.

981
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:45,332
Salameh.
Untouchable.

982
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:48,907
Salameh.

983
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,475
Zaid Muchassi.

984
01:26:02,224 --> 01:26:04,920
Zaid Muchassi is in Athens
in two weeks.

985
01:26:05,528 --> 01:26:08,052
Not one of our names.
Nevertheless.

986
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,822
He is Black September's
KGB contact.

987
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:13,432
Hussein al-Chir
was the KGB contact.

988
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:16,903
Yes. But you put a bomb
under <i>Monsieur</i> al-Chir's
bed in Cyprus...

989
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:20,168
and now he's defunct.
Muchassi is his replacement.

990
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:23,600
I hear he's much tougher
than his predecessor.

991
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:33,010
We offer Muchassi's
whereabouts at the new rate.

992
01:26:33,322 --> 01:26:36,779
What new rate?
Three names for $600,000...

993
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,384
is $200,000 for one name.

994
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:47,159
I need you to find me
a place to work in Athens.

995
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:50,302
Of course. Safe house.

996
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:15,458
Is this Louis's idea
of a joke?

997
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,962
I've had nightmares
that looked like this.

998
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:23,770
So when they explode,
they toss little white
balls of phosphorus...

999
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:27,171
here all around his room.
Each ball, it's like
a little sun.

1000
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:29,211
It burns at around
5,000 degrees.

1001
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:32,145
So the air catches fire.

1002
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:34,980
Everything in the vicinity
melts.

1003
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:36,984
Now, the bad news is
they are grenades...

1004
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:40,248
so I modified them
to use with a remote
detonator.

1005
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,524
I also should mention
that they're quite old...

1006
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:43,579
like World War II.

1007
01:27:44,059 --> 01:27:47,118
Only four were viable.
We should dump the rest.

1008
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:50,926
There's a porter at the hotel
where Muchassi's staying.

1009
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,161
He's gonna let us in the room
when Muchassi goes out.

1010
01:27:53,234 --> 01:27:56,295
Hey. Who provided
these prehistoric
explosives?

1011
01:27:56,372 --> 01:27:59,466
Louis.
Yeah. I'll thank him for that.

1012
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,016
Tallyho.

1013
01:28:37,179 --> 01:28:39,113
Stop! Stop!

1014
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:42,844
PLO! PLO!
ETA! ETA!

1015
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:45,078
Put the gun down
or we'll shoot.

1016
01:28:45,154 --> 01:28:47,987
Basque! Basque!

1017
01:28:50,292 --> 01:28:52,817
Okay.

1018
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:03,502
Put the gun down!
Put it down!

1019
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:12,244
Put it down.

1020
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:40,103
Which French? Louis?
Who are you? English?

1021
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:44,909
Basque. ETA.
Red Army Faction.

1022
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:48,948
He's ANC.
African. African.

1023
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:53,386
We are from Amman.
I'm Ali.

1024
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:58,323
Said. George. Abed.

1025
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:02,394
We paid for two nights.

1026
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,561
He said it was safe.

1027
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:10,470
He told us the same.
Yes. Safe house.

1028
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:13,773
Yes.

1029
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:18,269
So we're safe?

1030
01:30:20,349 --> 01:30:21,440
Safe.

1031
01:30:23,118 --> 01:30:24,779
Everyone is safe.

1032
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:35,682
Eventually the Arab states
will rise against Israel.

1033
01:31:36,358 --> 01:31:39,987
They don't like Palestinians,
but they hate the Jews more.

1034
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:42,856
It won't be like 1967.

1035
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:46,798
The rest of the world
will see by then what
the Israelis do to us.

1036
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:50,703
They won't help when
Egypt and Syria attack.
Even Jordan.

1037
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:53,498
Israel will cease
to exist.

1038
01:31:57,279 --> 01:31:58,268
What?

1039
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:03,440
This is a dream.
You can't take back
a country you never had.

1040
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:05,680
You sound like a Jew.
Fuck you.

1041
01:32:05,753 --> 01:32:08,814
I'm the voice
inside your head telling you
what you already know.

1042
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:11,121
You people have nothing
to bargain with.

1043
01:32:11,726 --> 01:32:13,319
You'll never get
the land back.

1044
01:32:13,395 --> 01:32:17,024
You'll all die old men
in refugee camps
waiting for Palestine.

1045
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:19,692
We have a lot of children.
They'll have children.

1046
01:32:19,768 --> 01:32:21,257
So we can wait forever.

1047
01:32:21,336 --> 01:32:24,896
And if we need to,
we can make the whole
planet unsafe for Jews.

1048
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:27,134
You kill Jews and the world
feels bad for them...

1049
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,609
and thinks you are animals.
Yes.

1050
01:32:29,677 --> 01:32:32,738
But then the world
will see how they've
made us into animals.

1051
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:36,806
They'll start to ask questions
about the conditions
in our cages.

1052
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:41,618
You are Arabs. There are lots
of places for Arabs.

1053
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:45,349
You're a Jew sympathizer.

1054
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:49,328
All you Germans,
you're too soft on Israel.

1055
01:32:50,032 --> 01:32:53,467
Well, you give us money,
but you feel guilty
about Hitler.

1056
01:32:53,534 --> 01:32:55,867
And the Jews exploit
that guilt.

1057
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,902
My father didn't gas
any Jews.

1058
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:05,712
Tell me something, Ali.
What?

1059
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:10,212
Do you really miss
your father's olive trees?

1060
01:33:11,019 --> 01:33:15,149
Do you honestly think
you have to get back
all that... that nothing?

1061
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,520
That chalky soil
and stone huts.

1062
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,460
Is that what you really
want for your children?

1063
01:33:20,529 --> 01:33:22,292
It absolutely is.

1064
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:27,934
It will take a hundred years,
but we'll win.

1065
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:32,628
How long did it take the Jews
to get their own country?

1066
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:36,243
How long did it take
the Germans to make Germany?

1067
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:38,176
And look how well
that worked out.

1068
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:41,180
You don't know what it is
not to have a home.

1069
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,247
That's why you European Reds
don't get it.

1070
01:33:44,853 --> 01:33:48,653
You say, "It's nothing,"
but you have a home
to come back to.

1071
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:52,389
ETA, ANC, IRA...

1072
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:55,588
we all pretend
we care about your
international revolution...

1073
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:57,324
but we don't care.

1074
01:33:58,233 --> 01:34:00,097
We want to be nations.

1075
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:03,298
Home is everything.

1076
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:46,779
No, no, no.
No, I watch.

1077
01:34:47,916 --> 01:34:50,282
You only take money
enclosed in papers, yes?

1078
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:51,682
Of course.

1079
01:35:44,672 --> 01:35:46,037
Look there.

1080
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:50,002
Here they come
in their pumpkin coach.

1081
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:55,805
The Russians and...

1082
01:35:58,987 --> 01:36:00,511
Cinderella.

1083
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,774
Do we detonate
if the other Arabs go
into the room with him?

1084
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:34,048
Why are the Russians waiting?

1085
01:36:35,023 --> 01:36:38,981
Why don't they leave?
They are waiting.

1086
01:36:41,695 --> 01:36:45,496
We are waiting. Stay calm.
Hey, I'm calm.

1087
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:59,939
He's in his room. Do it.
Is he alone?

1088
01:37:00,347 --> 01:37:04,078
How do we know if he's alone?
Just flip the switch. Do it.

1089
01:37:11,426 --> 01:37:12,756
I don't understand it.
What's wrong?

1090
01:37:12,828 --> 01:37:14,625
It's a piece of shit.

1091
01:37:15,863 --> 01:37:18,492
What? Fuck! Not again.
Wait, wait.

1092
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,466
Where's the explosion?
It should've exploded by now.

1093
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:24,931
What's gone wrong?
It's another malfunction.

1094
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,029
You know what?

1095
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:27,971
Or maybe it's delayed...
He has fucked up again!

1096
01:37:28,042 --> 01:37:30,375
Or maybe it could
still blow up.
This is a waste of time!

1097
01:37:30,444 --> 01:37:32,675
Careful with that stuff,
Hans.

1098
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,211
Hans!
Hans, what are you doing?

1099
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:42,051
Hans, get back here!

1100
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,622
Hey, hey!
What is he doing?

1101
01:37:48,697 --> 01:37:50,288
Hans. No, no.

1102
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:20,655
So how long
is he going to be?

1103
01:38:21,863 --> 01:38:23,386
Maybe one hour.

1104
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:25,653
I know you.

1105
01:39:27,429 --> 01:39:29,623
Stop!

1106
01:39:50,118 --> 01:39:52,018
Get in! Head down!

1107
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:28,453
Ali? Ali? Ali?

1108
01:40:34,996 --> 01:40:37,930
Are you incapable of making
something that works?

1109
01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:40,091
Shut up! You shut up!

1110
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:41,725
Does anybody speak Greek?

1111
01:40:41,802 --> 01:40:44,135
Shut him up!
Did we kill a Russian?

1112
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:46,139
That's not good!
Where did you get
your training?

1113
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:49,198
Every single bomb,
every fucking one,
is fucked up.

1114
01:40:49,277 --> 01:40:51,176
I was not trained to do this!

1115
01:40:51,246 --> 01:40:54,545
I was trained
to dismantle bombs,
not to build them!

1116
01:40:57,284 --> 01:40:58,649
Holy shit.

1117
01:40:59,988 --> 01:41:04,048
Shin Bet
wanted bomb dismantlers.
They picked me from the army.

1118
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:05,881
A toy maker.
Give me some money.

1119
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,520
They figured I was good
with small machines.

1120
01:41:09,396 --> 01:41:13,833
But then after Munich,
they asked if I could
build bombs instead.

1121
01:41:15,036 --> 01:41:16,525
So I said yes.

1122
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:26,073
Come on. Here.

1123
01:41:35,155 --> 01:41:37,521
<i>The three</i>
<i>went to the side of</i>
<i>the customs hall...</i>

1124
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:40,618
<i>took out</i>
<i>pieces of their rifles,</i>
<i>and quickly assembled them.</i>

1125
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:43,891
<i>Then they threw hand grenades</i>
<i>into the long queues</i>
<i>of passengers...</i>

1126
01:41:43,965 --> 01:41:47,957
<i>waiting to clear</i>
<i>passport control</i>
<i>and began automatic fire.</i>

1127
01:41:48,036 --> 01:41:50,265
<i>It was all over</i>
<i>in a matter of minutes.</i>

1128
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:52,135
<i>And the firing</i>
<i>was indiscriminate.</i>

1129
01:41:52,207 --> 01:41:53,640
Salameh is in London.

1130
01:41:56,677 --> 01:42:00,204
He goes there periodically
to meet with his CIA contact.

1131
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:04,506
His what?
Salameh works for the CIA.

1132
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:06,881
Bullshit.

1133
01:42:07,055 --> 01:42:09,488
Salameh guarantees
that Black September...

1134
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:11,319
won't touch
American diplomats.

1135
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:14,327
In exchange,
the CIA gives him
lots of money.

1136
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:16,622
And they don't ask
what he uses it for.

1137
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:20,896
Did he tell them
about Munich in advance?

1138
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:22,595
Did the CIA
know about Munich?

1139
01:42:22,670 --> 01:42:25,137
The CIA didn't even know
Black September existed...

1140
01:42:25,206 --> 01:42:26,729
before Munich.

1141
01:42:28,076 --> 01:42:30,237
<i>One of the guerrillas was shot</i>
<i>through the head...</i>

1142
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,538
<i>by a ricochet bullet.</i>

1143
01:42:31,613 --> 01:42:34,104
<i>A second was blown up</i>
<i>by his own hand grenade.</i>

1144
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:36,274
Since then,
he's been busy.

1145
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:38,483
Hasn't he?

1146
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,118
All manner
of costly exercises.

1147
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:44,854
Shooting tourists
in the Athens airport...

1148
01:42:44,926 --> 01:42:47,326
blowing up pharmacies
in Amsterdam...

1149
01:42:47,395 --> 01:42:50,454
and that Mossad agent
in Barcelona before that.

1150
01:42:51,099 --> 01:42:55,627
Europe hasn't been
this interesting since
Napoleon marched to Moscow.

1151
01:42:56,537 --> 01:42:58,664
Do you have to
do that here?

1152
01:42:59,373 --> 01:43:03,104
Salameh is in London.
For the usual price.

1153
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:14,844
We followed him
from his doctor
to his hotel.

1154
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:17,220
He's here for eye treatment.
Salameh. You saw him?

1155
01:43:17,292 --> 01:43:18,588
You followed him?
Yes.

1156
01:43:18,659 --> 01:43:20,854
Wearing sunglasses
in the rain.
Why didn't you shoot him?

1157
01:43:20,929 --> 01:43:22,328
There were bodyguards.
Civilians.

1158
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:23,623
Were they armed?
Yes.

1159
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:26,097
Well then,
they're not civilians.
I'd have done it...

1160
01:43:26,167 --> 01:43:28,067
if you'd give me half a chance
to actually shoot someone.

1161
01:43:28,136 --> 01:43:30,536
I'm the only one who actually
wants to shoot these guys.

1162
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:32,333
Maybe that's why
we never let you do it.

1163
01:43:32,407 --> 01:43:34,636
We only go after our targets.
Since when?

1164
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,404
I mean, why are we worried
about that now?

1165
01:43:36,476 --> 01:43:39,570
Do you have any idea
how many laws we've broken?

1166
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:43,180
It's time
to stop your agonizing.
It's counterproductive.

1167
01:43:43,251 --> 01:43:46,686
Including, incidentally,
the laws of the state
of Israel...

1168
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:48,051
which has no death penalty.

1169
01:43:48,122 --> 01:43:50,716
You know what your problem is,
<i>habibi?</i>

1170
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:52,292
You're disorientated.

1171
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,828
Because the guys
we're killing are dressed
in expensive suits...

1172
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:57,261
and this is London
and not some ugly
Arab village.

1173
01:43:57,332 --> 01:43:59,027
I'm not disoriented.

1174
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:01,568
I'm keeping my sanity
by occasionally reminding
myself...

1175
01:44:01,636 --> 01:44:02,728
that in spite of...

1176
01:44:02,804 --> 01:44:04,567
But it's the same old war
we're fighting...

1177
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:05,900
I'm still,
at least in principle,
a human being.

1178
01:44:05,974 --> 01:44:07,270
...over the same old
scrap of desert!

1179
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:09,742
It's just we've brought
our war to Copenhagen
and Kensington...

1180
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:12,301
and it's not like
these European anti-Semites
don't deserve that.

1181
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:15,645
Unless we learn
to act like them,
we will never defeat them.

1182
01:44:15,716 --> 01:44:17,947
We act like them
all the time.

1183
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:20,315
What, you think
the Palestinians
invented bloodshed?

1184
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:22,855
How do you think we got
control of the land?
By being nice?

1185
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:25,323
Somebody
pull down this man's pants.
See if he's circumcised.

1186
01:44:25,393 --> 01:44:26,917
I think we have a double agent
in our midst.

1187
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:29,657
Don't you dare accuse me
of that!
Stop it!

1188
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:32,631
My son died in '67,
you foul-mouthed
son of a bitch.

1189
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:34,930
Everything you can ask,
I've done for Israel.

1190
01:44:35,002 --> 01:44:38,063
Ask for a reassignment
if this is so distasteful.

1191
01:44:38,139 --> 01:44:40,663
Why, it's not distasteful
to you?
No.

1192
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:44,734
'Cause the only blood that
matters to me is Jewish blood.

1193
01:44:47,314 --> 01:44:50,181
Nice job, eh.
Nice job leading.

1194
01:44:52,287 --> 01:44:54,448
If the bodyguards are armed,
we kill them.

1195
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:57,252
They're armed.
Well, then we kill them!

1196
01:45:43,904 --> 01:45:44,997
Taxi!

1197
01:45:45,139 --> 01:45:46,127
Taxi!

1198
01:46:29,917 --> 01:46:32,613
Roger Burke, you ugly fuck!
What are you doing in London?

1199
01:46:32,686 --> 01:46:34,621
Get your hands off me.

1200
01:46:34,788 --> 01:46:36,949
Put them up.
Put them up,
you fat, wet puss!

1201
01:46:37,024 --> 01:46:38,787
Let's show these limey fucks
what we're made of.

1202
01:46:38,859 --> 01:46:41,555
Hey, wait a minute!
Who the fuck...
Who do you think this is then?

1203
01:46:41,628 --> 01:46:42,926
Roger Burke.
Who do you think this is?

1204
01:46:42,997 --> 01:46:45,829
No, you idiot. That is not...
Lay off him, asshole.

1205
01:46:45,932 --> 01:46:48,595
That's not him. Come on.
It's Roger Burke.

1206
01:46:49,302 --> 01:46:50,462
I'm sorry about my friend,
you know?

1207
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:53,871
He's a fucked-up,
belligerent guy with
a serious drinking problem.

1208
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:57,399
Hey, come here.
Lose it.

1209
01:46:57,478 --> 01:46:59,775
Come on. Calm down!
Hey, calm down.

1210
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:02,372
Hey, come here!
Calm down!

1211
01:47:05,019 --> 01:47:08,546
Back off. Get back!

1212
01:47:08,622 --> 01:47:10,921
Back off! Back off!
Fuck off!

1213
01:47:10,992 --> 01:47:12,458
It's me. All right!

1214
01:47:12,527 --> 01:47:14,756
All right. Come on.
Fuck off!

1215
01:47:15,195 --> 01:47:17,561
It's me, Roger, Orrin!
Come on.

1216
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:21,966
It's me. Remember me? Sorry.
It's all right.

1217
01:47:23,069 --> 01:47:25,300
You should have ducked,
Roger!

1218
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:33,771
Fucking Americans!

1219
01:47:33,847 --> 01:47:35,610
What the fuck is that?
Was it Salameh?

1220
01:47:35,682 --> 01:47:37,844
Yes, of course
it was fucking Salameh!

1221
01:47:59,673 --> 01:48:02,198
I take it she'd
eat you up a bit, huh?

1222
01:48:03,578 --> 01:48:05,170
You old dog.

1223
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:07,208
He's got some ideas.

1224
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:11,073
Oh, the American bloke?
Aren't we all?

1225
01:48:11,519 --> 01:48:14,248
So you've heard these rumors?
These are wild stories.

1226
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:16,289
Wild stories.
Yeah?

1227
01:48:16,356 --> 01:48:17,345
Yeah.

1228
01:48:42,382 --> 01:48:43,542
Can I?

1229
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:55,992
I have to go to bed soon.
I work in the morning.

1230
01:48:56,997 --> 01:48:59,125
What kind of work do you do?

1231
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:04,235
The kind that drives you
to drink.

1232
01:49:05,006 --> 01:49:06,734
We must have the same job,
then.

1233
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:10,438
I love your accent.

1234
01:49:11,444 --> 01:49:13,002
I love your perfume.

1235
01:49:23,524 --> 01:49:25,719
Cuts right through
the smoke.

1236
01:49:27,694 --> 01:49:28,922
Does it?

1237
01:49:30,096 --> 01:49:31,859
It's very nice.

1238
01:49:36,737 --> 01:49:39,899
Look, I don't want
to be forward...

1239
01:49:40,608 --> 01:49:42,199
but it's late...

1240
01:49:42,676 --> 01:49:45,975
and I do have to get up early.

1241
01:49:46,646 --> 01:49:47,806
So...

1242
01:49:49,483 --> 01:49:51,882
So?
So...

1243
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,716
So, you're very nice, and...

1244
01:49:59,225 --> 01:50:01,751
Are you really going
to make me ask?

1245
01:50:08,636 --> 01:50:09,898
I just can't.

1246
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:12,261
Pity.

1247
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:15,769
You're very attractive.
I know.

1248
01:50:18,912 --> 01:50:20,505
If you come to your senses...

1249
01:50:20,581 --> 01:50:23,175
once you get up
to your lonely room...

1250
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:25,408
well, maybe I'll be here.

1251
01:50:26,354 --> 01:50:30,722
Or maybe I'll be in my room,
alone in bed.

1252
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:38,997
Good night.

1253
01:50:58,586 --> 01:51:01,850
The drunk Americans.
You think they were CIA?

1254
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:06,024
They could've been.
For all we know, Louis is CIA.

1255
01:51:06,092 --> 01:51:08,755
They work both sides.
Everyone does.

1256
01:51:08,828 --> 01:51:11,797
Or Louis is Mossad.
Now, maybe he isn't...

1257
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:13,527
but they're using him
to feed us information.

1258
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,193
There's no direct link.

1259
01:51:15,269 --> 01:51:18,136
Or Mossad's giving it to CIA,
which is giving it to Louis...

1260
01:51:18,204 --> 01:51:20,036
and Ephraim's demanding
we give him Louis...

1261
01:51:20,106 --> 01:51:22,597
because he knows
we expect him to do...

1262
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:25,578
Stop chasing the mice
inside your skull.

1263
01:51:30,685 --> 01:51:33,619
You know,
I never thought you'd last.

1264
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:36,823
I thought the same about you.

1265
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:39,621
From the beginning
you seemed so reluctant.

1266
01:51:39,694 --> 01:51:41,559
I was born reluctant.
Ask my mother.

1267
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:43,289
If I can't kvetch,
I can't do my job.

1268
01:51:43,363 --> 01:51:45,332
You ever feel reluctant?

1269
01:51:45,666 --> 01:51:47,930
I'm not comfortable
with confusion.

1270
01:51:49,235 --> 01:51:51,636
I knew guys like you
in the army.

1271
01:51:52,006 --> 01:51:54,565
You'll do any terrifying thing
you're asked to do...

1272
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:56,872
but you have to do it running.

1273
01:51:57,978 --> 01:52:02,210
You think you can outrun
your fears, your doubts.

1274
01:52:04,085 --> 01:52:08,920
The only thing that really
scares you guys is stillness.

1275
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:13,792
But everyone's overtaken,
eventually.

1276
01:52:15,563 --> 01:52:18,157
Now, the mice need a brandy.
Will you join me?

1277
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:20,826
No, I'm going to go upstairs,
straight to bed.

1278
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:22,128
You okay drinking
by yourself?

1279
01:52:22,203 --> 01:52:24,899
It's just a shot
to numb the brain.
Good night.

1280
01:52:28,641 --> 01:52:29,631
Oh.

1281
01:52:30,144 --> 01:52:33,045
Beware of the local
honey trap.
Indeed?

1282
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:36,744
You can't miss her.
You don't want to.

1283
01:52:57,438 --> 01:52:58,597
Hello.

1284
01:52:58,706 --> 01:53:00,900
<i>This is a trunk call</i>
<i>from Mr. Storsch.</i>

1285
01:53:00,975 --> 01:53:02,237
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

1286
01:53:02,309 --> 01:53:05,471
Shit, Avner,
you woke up the baby,
but that's okay... I mean...

1287
01:53:05,546 --> 01:53:06,944
How are you?

1288
01:53:08,082 --> 01:53:09,207
<i>I miss you.</i>

1289
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:13,177
<i>You're in England</i>
<i>or Australia...</i>

1290
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:15,654
<i>or the North Pole...</i>
Yeah, that's right.

1291
01:53:17,725 --> 01:53:19,886
So listen, I was thinking...

1292
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,792
when I'm finished doing
what I'm doing here...

1293
01:53:22,863 --> 01:53:24,524
I want to come to Brooklyn
to see you.

1294
01:53:24,597 --> 01:53:27,395
Brooklyn is depressing.
It's got more churches
than Jerusalem.

1295
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:28,627
Listen to her talk.

1296
01:53:31,305 --> 01:53:34,364
Can you hear me?
Can she hear me?
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1297
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:38,538
<i>Hey. Talk to me.</i>

1298
01:53:41,181 --> 01:53:43,649
<i>Daphna, make her talk.</i>

1299
01:53:54,127 --> 01:53:55,117
Dada.

1300
01:54:00,067 --> 01:54:03,161
Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.
It's your papa.

1301
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:07,331
This is my voice, darling.

1302
01:54:09,643 --> 01:54:12,635
This is what I sound like.
Don't forget, okay?

1303
01:54:14,881 --> 01:54:17,783
Listen, I have to get
her to bed. She's tired.

1304
01:54:17,851 --> 01:54:19,752
<i>She'll dream about you.</i>

1305
01:54:52,286 --> 01:54:56,119
<i>We're standing at</i>
<i>a distance, as instructed</i>
<i>by the terrorists.</i>

1306
01:54:57,323 --> 01:54:59,849
Are we going?
Is it to the airport?

1307
01:54:59,926 --> 01:55:01,189
Can we talk to someone,
just to say...

1308
01:55:01,261 --> 01:55:03,229
Shut up, okay?
Just get on the bus, okay?

1309
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:06,858
Just to tell our families.
Just to say we are all right!

1310
01:55:07,001 --> 01:55:09,765
Everybody, just relax, okay?
Relax! Calm down.

1311
01:55:09,837 --> 01:55:13,932
We will ride this bus
and fly away. After,
you go back to your home...

1312
01:55:14,007 --> 01:55:15,998
or to your Olympic Games.

1313
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:16,894
Carl. You asshole.

1314
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:19,324
I saw her first.

1315
01:57:37,717 --> 01:57:38,877
Carl?

1316
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:19,716
She's Dutch, not political,
entirely business-minded.

1317
01:59:20,253 --> 01:59:22,779
She lives in Hoorn.
She's there now.

1318
01:59:23,390 --> 01:59:25,414
This is dependable
information.

1319
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:27,516
For which you pay nothing.

1320
01:59:27,793 --> 01:59:30,456
We're giving you this.
You understand why?

1321
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:32,795
Because you want me to believe
that you had nothing to do...

1322
01:59:32,865 --> 01:59:34,730
with the murder of my partner.

1323
01:59:34,801 --> 01:59:38,328
We inhabit a world
of intersecting secrecies.

1324
01:59:38,704 --> 01:59:42,231
We live and die at the places
where those secrecies meet.

1325
01:59:42,309 --> 01:59:44,208
That's what we accept.

1326
01:59:45,078 --> 01:59:48,012
We buy information for you
from your enemies.

1327
01:59:49,483 --> 01:59:50,643
This alerts them.

1328
01:59:50,716 --> 01:59:53,015
You're not the only people
looking for names.

1329
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:56,011
You're telling me
I'm being hunted now?

1330
01:59:56,088 --> 01:59:58,989
He's telling you
it's time for you to quit.

1331
01:59:59,059 --> 02:00:02,859
The race is not
to the swift, nor
the battle to the strong...

1332
02:00:02,962 --> 02:00:05,658
but time and chance
happens to them all.

1333
02:00:18,345 --> 02:00:20,108
Evil falls suddenly.

1334
02:00:22,416 --> 02:00:24,440
Who can say when it falls?

1335
02:00:47,841 --> 02:00:50,172
So you're really gonna
kill her?

1336
02:00:51,511 --> 02:00:55,572
All this blood comes back
to us.
Eventually it will work.

1337
02:00:56,015 --> 02:00:58,712
Even if it takes years,
we'll beat them.

1338
02:00:59,752 --> 02:01:01,413
We're Jews, Avner.

1339
02:01:01,988 --> 02:01:04,082
Jews don't do wrong
because our enemies do wrong.

1340
02:01:04,157 --> 02:01:06,625
We can't afford to be
that decent anymore.

1341
02:01:06,726 --> 02:01:08,887
I don't know that
we ever were that decent.

1342
02:01:09,296 --> 02:01:13,198
Suffering thousands of years
of hatred doesn't make you
decent.

1343
02:01:13,466 --> 02:01:17,163
But we're
supposed to be righteous.
That's a beautiful thing.

1344
02:01:17,237 --> 02:01:18,601
That's Jewish.

1345
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:20,832
That's what I knew,
that's what I was taught.

1346
02:01:22,042 --> 02:01:24,805
And now I'm losing it,
and I lose that, that's...

1347
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:27,037
That's...
That's everything.

1348
02:01:27,713 --> 02:01:29,238
That's my soul.

1349
02:01:32,219 --> 02:01:35,381
You need to go rest somewhere.
You don't have to do this one.

1350
02:01:37,623 --> 02:01:39,488
When I need you again,
I'll find you.

1351
02:02:32,945 --> 02:02:35,106
Excuse me. Who are you?

1352
02:02:43,422 --> 02:02:44,912
Do you know why we're here?

1353
02:02:45,625 --> 02:02:47,114
I want to get dressed, okay?

1354
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:56,796
Maybe you want to hire me.
You know how good I am.

1355
02:03:02,109 --> 02:03:03,234
No. Don't.

1356
02:03:04,077 --> 02:03:06,601
It's such a fucking waste
of talent.

1357
02:03:18,225 --> 02:03:20,055
Where're you going?
Stay here.

1358
02:03:20,127 --> 02:03:21,594
Shell. Shell.

1359
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:23,587
Yeah.

1360
02:03:59,533 --> 02:04:00,795
Leave it.

1361
02:04:19,051 --> 02:04:22,215
<i>In seven months</i>
<i>we've killed six</i>
<i>of the 11 names.</i>

1362
02:04:23,023 --> 02:04:25,252
<i>We've killed one replacement.</i>

1363
02:04:25,591 --> 02:04:27,685
<i>One of our targets</i>
<i>is in prison and four...</i>

1364
02:04:27,761 --> 02:04:30,594
<i>including Ali Hassan Salameh,</i>
<i>are at large.</i>

1365
02:04:31,497 --> 02:04:33,523
<i>One of our own has fallen.</i>

1366
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:37,359
<i>Since we began, the other side</i>
<i>has sent letter bombs</i>
<i>to 11 embassies...</i>

1367
02:04:37,436 --> 02:04:39,404
<i>hijacked three planes...</i>

1368
02:04:39,905 --> 02:04:43,534
<i>killed 130 passengers</i>
<i>in Athens and wounded</i>
<i>scores more...</i>

1369
02:04:44,176 --> 02:04:46,805
and killed our military
attaché in Washington.

1370
02:04:46,912 --> 02:04:50,349
Some of it was
done by a Venezuelan
called Carlos the Jackal...

1371
02:04:50,417 --> 02:04:52,317
who replaced Zaid Muchassi...

1372
02:04:52,418 --> 02:04:54,613
who replaced Hussein al-Chir.

1373
02:04:55,755 --> 02:04:59,315
Black September's original
leadership has been decimated.

1374
02:05:01,394 --> 02:05:03,692
But new leaders
are emerging...

1375
02:05:03,963 --> 02:05:06,557
for whom Black September
wasn't violent enough.

1376
02:05:09,569 --> 02:05:12,162
And to dispatch
our six dispatched targets...

1377
02:05:12,238 --> 02:05:15,537
we must have spent something
close to $2 million, right?

1378
02:05:15,609 --> 02:05:18,942
You've been cooking.
Are you expecting company?

1379
02:05:19,845 --> 02:05:22,177
Mrs. Meir
says to the Knesset...

1380
02:05:23,984 --> 02:05:26,612
the world must see
that killing Jews...

1381
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:29,755
will be from now on
an expensive proposition.

1382
02:05:31,992 --> 02:05:34,289
But killing Palestinians
isn't exactly cheap.

1383
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:41,525
If all 11 were dead,
you'd stop?
Yes.

1384
02:05:42,801 --> 02:05:46,898
You're lying.
What about their replacements?

1385
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,474
With each time we kill,
we create six more.

1386
02:05:51,411 --> 02:05:53,207
Maybe they'll have to keep
killing them, then.

1387
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:54,507
Forever.

1388
02:05:55,715 --> 02:05:57,807
Five targets are still alive.

1389
02:05:57,884 --> 02:05:59,875
That's five men
that need to be killed.

1390
02:05:59,953 --> 02:06:02,512
Eventually you forget that
in the beginning you hated
doing it.

1391
02:06:02,588 --> 02:06:04,180
For me personally,
I feel less every day.

1392
02:06:04,256 --> 02:06:06,282
One day I'm going to wake up,
I'm going to kill...

1393
02:06:06,359 --> 02:06:09,350
I'm going to go back to bed,
I'm not going to feel anything
at all.

1394
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:15,595
Hey, Hans? You know there's
a rule in the book against
blind drunks.

1395
02:06:15,868 --> 02:06:17,769
Why don't you stop drinking
and eat something?

1396
02:06:17,837 --> 02:06:21,136
I mean, there's enough food
here to feed Bangladesh.

1397
02:06:24,144 --> 02:06:27,806
I keep seeing that
Dutch woman, you know,
sprawled out like that.

1398
02:06:31,283 --> 02:06:34,185
It's not that I wish
we hadn't killed her.

1399
02:06:34,487 --> 02:06:37,284
I wish I had let you
close up her housecoat.

1400
02:06:37,856 --> 02:06:41,417
Yeah,
but you weren't yourself.

1401
02:06:56,342 --> 02:06:57,502
Avner.

1402
02:07:00,412 --> 02:07:01,402
Avner.

1403
02:07:03,984 --> 02:07:04,972
Avner.

1404
02:07:05,551 --> 02:07:08,543
I went to Hans' flat
above the antique shop...

1405
02:07:09,122 --> 02:07:12,056
just to check up on him
because he was so...

1406
02:07:13,059 --> 02:07:15,926
Anyway, he's gone somewhere,
and I waited all night...

1407
02:07:15,996 --> 02:07:17,622
and he's not come back.

1408
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,912
Knife.

1409
02:07:45,024 --> 02:07:47,050
They didn't take anything.

1410
02:12:09,188 --> 02:12:10,246
What?

1411
02:12:41,186 --> 02:12:42,984
It will be beautiful.

1412
02:12:44,457 --> 02:12:47,914
Ali Hassan Salameh
is in Tarifa on the Spanish
coast.

1413
02:12:48,994 --> 02:12:52,623
He's at a compound
guarded by all the
predictable trouble.

1414
02:12:52,998 --> 02:12:55,729
Bomb makers often die
accidental deaths.

1415
02:12:58,136 --> 02:13:00,435
In Athens
you shot a KGB agent.

1416
02:13:02,542 --> 02:13:05,841
Many people must want
to kill you, <i>Monsieur</i> Storsch.

1417
02:13:06,244 --> 02:13:09,543
But why would I do that?
You pay better than anyone.

1418
02:13:15,087 --> 02:13:17,578
It's dangerous
going after Salameh.

1419
02:13:18,890 --> 02:13:20,756
But he planned
the Munich massacre.

1420
02:13:24,896 --> 02:13:28,627
Eliminate him,
and they'll let you go home.
Don't you think?

1421
02:13:32,137 --> 02:13:33,765
Yes, Louis. I do.

1422
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:40,643
You could have a kitchen
like that someday.

1423
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:47,550
It costs dearly,
but home always does.

1424
02:14:44,243 --> 02:14:46,734
Shit!
It's like a funhouse in there.

1425
02:14:47,546 --> 02:14:49,412
Can you tell how many?

1426
02:15:09,202 --> 02:15:10,600
That's him.

1427
02:15:15,108 --> 02:15:17,302
Are you sure it's him, Avner?

1428
02:15:18,978 --> 02:15:20,740
You have to be sure.

1429
02:16:22,942 --> 02:16:24,636
I'm Avner Kaufman.
We know.

1430
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:27,109
You want to ride with us?
Hop in.

1431
02:16:27,512 --> 02:16:28,810
Please.

1432
02:16:34,654 --> 02:16:37,680
I'm Amos.
This is Avi. Shin Bet.

1433
02:16:38,591 --> 02:16:40,218
We're not supposed to know
who you are...

1434
02:16:41,394 --> 02:16:42,382
because we're not officers.

1435
02:16:42,694 --> 02:16:45,424
We're just shit
and no one tells us shit.

1436
02:16:47,233 --> 02:16:49,861
We've heard about
what you've done.

1437
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:54,101
We want to say
it's an honor
to meet you.

1438
02:16:59,344 --> 02:17:01,404
It's an honor for me,
too.

1439
02:17:10,855 --> 02:17:13,188
I have no problems
with anything you guys did...

1440
02:17:13,259 --> 02:17:16,092
except the woman
on the houseboat
in Hoorn.

1441
02:17:16,728 --> 02:17:18,458
Steve's told us about her.

1442
02:17:18,531 --> 02:17:19,725
We took a leave
of absence...

1443
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:21,129
and killed her
off the company clock.

1444
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:22,257
Don't be an idiot.

1445
02:17:22,334 --> 02:17:25,395
Otherwise, as I said,
we have no problems
with the job you did.

1446
02:17:26,338 --> 02:17:28,466
Except three
of my men died.

1447
02:17:28,540 --> 02:17:29,632
According
to your colleague...

1448
02:17:29,709 --> 02:17:31,835
I should say, emphatically,
according to your colleague...

1449
02:17:31,911 --> 02:17:33,468
not in any way your fault.

1450
02:17:33,546 --> 02:17:34,706
He sings your praises.

1451
02:17:34,780 --> 02:17:37,340
Best guy he ever worked for,
and so on.

1452
02:17:41,254 --> 02:17:44,416
He says this French group...
Louis was his name?

1453
02:17:44,690 --> 02:17:47,716
They sold
the terrorists information
regarding your whereabouts.

1454
02:17:47,792 --> 02:17:49,487
They helped kill your men.

1455
02:17:50,796 --> 02:17:53,059
I know Steve believes that,
but it's not true.

1456
02:17:53,131 --> 02:17:54,429
Tell us who they are.

1457
02:17:57,036 --> 02:17:59,027
They won't work with you.

1458
02:18:00,472 --> 02:18:03,566
It's about loyalty.
You're an Israeli officer.

1459
02:18:03,743 --> 02:18:06,302
That's your only loyalty!
That's it!

1460
02:18:09,347 --> 02:18:10,440
Okay.

1461
02:18:11,916 --> 02:18:14,852
This is General Hofi
of the Northern Command.

1462
02:18:15,021 --> 02:18:16,511
You look good.

1463
02:18:17,222 --> 02:18:20,750
Listen, the Prime Minister
is proud of you and your men.

1464
02:18:20,925 --> 02:18:22,950
She wishes she could tell you
herself, but she can't.

1465
02:18:23,029 --> 02:18:24,962
She never heard of you,
right?

1466
02:18:25,764 --> 02:18:29,222
Good. She says you've done
a great thing for your people.

1467
02:18:29,301 --> 02:18:30,666
For Israel.

1468
02:18:35,106 --> 02:18:37,940
That's it.
There is no medal or anything.

1469
02:18:49,587 --> 02:18:52,647
June 16, 1973.
Avner Kaufman interview.

1470
02:18:55,127 --> 02:18:56,388
Go ahead.

1471
02:19:00,765 --> 02:19:02,756
Tell me what you learned.

1472
02:19:05,737 --> 02:19:07,638
What I learned?
Yes.

1473
02:19:07,872 --> 02:19:09,602
What did you learn?

1474
02:19:12,244 --> 02:19:13,676
For God's sake!

1475
02:19:13,845 --> 02:19:16,211
Tell me the names and numbers
of your sources.

1476
02:19:20,585 --> 02:19:22,075
Avner, tell me.

1477
02:19:22,154 --> 02:19:25,146
Tell me the names and numbers
of your sources.

1478
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:27,753
Please.

1479
02:19:29,028 --> 02:19:31,929
I can have you
court-martialed, and I might.

1480
02:19:32,665 --> 02:19:35,792
You can't.
I don't work for you.

1481
02:19:37,736 --> 02:19:39,227
I don't exist.

1482
02:19:41,574 --> 02:19:44,475
You look terrible.
I'm not good right now.

1483
02:19:47,046 --> 02:19:50,879
You don't
need to tell me anything.
It's taken a lot from you.

1484
02:19:51,584 --> 02:19:55,611
I'm alive, right?
And the rest sorts
itself out.

1485
02:19:57,122 --> 02:20:00,558
I'm not a fool, Avner.
I never said
you were a fool.

1486
02:20:10,636 --> 02:20:14,435
Everyone in Europe died.
Most of my family.

1487
02:20:15,407 --> 02:20:16,897
A huge family.

1488
02:20:20,546 --> 02:20:22,843
I never talked
to you about it.

1489
02:20:23,082 --> 02:20:26,016
I knew.
You knew?
So what was there to say?

1490
02:20:27,486 --> 02:20:29,886
I didn't die,
because I came here.

1491
02:20:30,221 --> 02:20:33,657
When I arrived,
I walked up to the top
of a hill in Jerusalem...

1492
02:20:33,726 --> 02:20:36,661
and prayed for a child.

1493
02:20:36,929 --> 02:20:39,921
I never prayed before,
but I was praying then.

1494
02:20:39,998 --> 02:20:43,263
And I could feel every
one of them praying with me.

1495
02:20:46,806 --> 02:20:48,898
You are what we prayed for.

1496
02:20:50,041 --> 02:20:52,236
What you did,
you did for us.

1497
02:20:52,677 --> 02:20:55,511
You did for your daughter,
but also for us.

1498
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:59,111
Every one of the ones
who died, died wanting this.

1499
02:21:00,753 --> 02:21:04,381
We had to take it,
because no one
will ever give it to us.

1500
02:21:04,522 --> 02:21:07,754
A place to be
a Jew among Jews,
subject to no one.

1501
02:21:09,895 --> 02:21:12,328
I thank God for hearing
my prayer.

1502
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:16,524
Do you want to know, Mama?

1503
02:21:18,069 --> 02:21:20,629
Do you want me to tell you
what I did?

1504
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:23,665
No.

1505
02:21:25,144 --> 02:21:28,579
Whatever it took,
whatever it takes.

1506
02:21:30,483 --> 02:21:35,442
A place on Earth.
We have a place on Earth.

1507
02:21:36,888 --> 02:21:38,150
At last.

1508
02:21:48,032 --> 02:21:50,126
What's this?
Baklava.

1509
02:21:51,003 --> 02:21:54,200
From Rehovot?
The only edible baklava
is from the Arabs in Jaffa.

1510
02:21:54,272 --> 02:21:56,468
Eat it on the plane.
You're too thin.

1511
02:21:56,575 --> 02:21:58,600
I hope it gives you
a bellyache.

1512
02:22:00,045 --> 02:22:01,409
Listen, forget it.

1513
02:22:01,479 --> 02:22:04,175
You go see
your wife, your child,
rest for a few more months.

1514
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:05,978
Then we're gonna put you
back in the field.

1515
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:07,814
Not Europe.
Probably Latin America.

1516
02:22:07,887 --> 02:22:11,084
You think it over.
Rest, Avner.
Then you come back.

1517
02:22:13,359 --> 02:22:14,382
No.

1518
02:22:41,352 --> 02:22:42,444
That's all right.

1519
02:22:42,521 --> 02:22:45,978
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

1520
02:22:46,058 --> 02:22:49,220
Look at that beautiful hair.

1521
02:23:36,208 --> 02:23:37,573
Nightmares?

1522
02:23:38,710 --> 02:23:39,769
Yes.

1523
02:23:43,215 --> 02:23:44,807
Come back to bed.

1524
02:23:47,386 --> 02:23:49,752
I have no idea
where I should be.

1525
02:23:56,128 --> 02:24:00,587
The place is nice.
You've made it really nice.

1526
02:24:01,899 --> 02:24:03,764
The kitchen's too big.

1527
02:25:21,746 --> 02:25:24,375
Sylvie, I need to speak
to your father.

1528
02:25:26,485 --> 02:25:28,009
Is Louis there?

1529
02:25:29,688 --> 02:25:32,417
I need to speak
to your father.
Have him call me.

1530
02:25:32,490 --> 02:25:36,290
212-664-7665.

1531
02:25:36,995 --> 02:25:39,462
I'll wait. He must call me.
I'll wait.

1532
02:25:43,701 --> 02:25:45,226
Am I being hunted?

1533
02:25:45,904 --> 02:25:47,531
<i>Is my family being hunted?</i>

1534
02:25:47,605 --> 02:25:52,566
How is your father?
He's well?
Your family is well?

1535
02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:56,272
I don't know.
How is my family?
Are they well?

1536
02:25:56,347 --> 02:25:57,712
Are they going to be okay?

1537
02:25:57,782 --> 02:26:00,478
I'm sending you a parcel
of sausage and cheese.

1538
02:26:00,619 --> 02:26:03,712
Real cheese.
The kind you can't
find in America.

1539
02:26:03,855 --> 02:26:07,347
It isn't pasteurized,
so it won't taste like shit.

1540
02:26:08,693 --> 02:26:11,685
It's a real pleasure
to hear your voice again.

1541
02:26:12,831 --> 02:26:15,094
I think about you
with concern.

1542
02:26:15,566 --> 02:26:17,158
<i>Do you believe me?</i>

1543
02:26:19,203 --> 02:26:20,192
Avner?

1544
02:26:21,073 --> 02:26:22,938
You believe me, Avner?

1545
02:26:25,144 --> 02:26:26,805
You know my name?

1546
02:26:26,879 --> 02:26:28,403
Of course I do.

1547
02:26:30,082 --> 02:26:32,015
Now, listen to me.
It's important.

1548
02:26:33,417 --> 02:26:36,284
No harm will come to you
from me.

1549
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:04,807
You can't go in there, sir.
It's a restricted area. Sir?

1550
02:27:05,516 --> 02:27:07,644
I tried to stop him.
I don't know who this guy is.

1551
02:27:07,718 --> 02:27:10,279
Security!

1552
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:13,251
If you're Mossad,
you know who I am.

1553
02:27:13,325 --> 02:27:16,191
If you don't,
tell Ephraim Avner
came to see him.

1554
02:27:16,261 --> 02:27:17,693
Being in this room
is by appointment only.

1555
02:27:17,796 --> 02:27:19,286
Shut up and listen to me.

1556
02:27:19,363 --> 02:27:21,888
I won't hesitate to kill
other people's children...

1557
02:27:21,967 --> 02:27:23,992
if you hurt my child.
Understand?
Do I know you, sir?

1558
02:27:24,068 --> 02:27:27,163
Or wives if you hurt my wife,
or fathers if you hurt
my father.

1559
02:27:27,238 --> 02:27:29,468
I don't care.
I'll go to the newspapers.

1560
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:32,441
I'll give every name
of everybody who was
in the meetings.

1561
02:27:32,511 --> 02:27:36,208
I'll tell them everything
if you don't leave
my family alone! Okay?

1562
02:32:05,250 --> 02:32:06,614
I love you.

1563
02:32:31,476 --> 02:32:32,636
Avner.

1564
02:32:38,216 --> 02:32:39,706
Phone for you.

1565
02:32:40,252 --> 02:32:41,718
He's Israeli.

1566
02:32:46,657 --> 02:32:48,989
You think we'd hurt
your family?

1567
02:32:49,426 --> 02:32:52,021
I think anyone is capable
of anything.

1568
02:32:52,430 --> 02:32:54,762
I think you're losing
your mind.

1569
02:32:59,737 --> 02:33:01,501
Did I commit murder?

1570
02:33:04,709 --> 02:33:06,801
I want you to give me proof
that everyone we killed...

1571
02:33:06,878 --> 02:33:07,935
had a hand in Munich.

1572
02:33:08,013 --> 02:33:10,344
I don't discuss such things
with people who don't exist.

1573
02:33:10,415 --> 02:33:12,940
You want to discuss,
come back to existence.

1574
02:33:13,018 --> 02:33:15,042
You want your daughter
to grow up in exile?

1575
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:16,711
I want evidence.

1576
02:33:20,424 --> 02:33:23,791
Professor Hamshari
with the beautiful wife
and child?

1577
02:33:24,129 --> 02:33:27,427
He was implicated
in a failed assassination
attempt on Ben-Gurion.

1578
02:33:27,498 --> 02:33:29,831
He was recruiting
for Fatah France.

1579
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:31,198
You stopped him.

1580
02:33:31,269 --> 02:33:32,792
We should have tried
to bring him to Israel.

1581
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:34,930
And Zwaiter, your harmless
little writer in Rome?

1582
02:33:35,005 --> 02:33:38,236
He was behind the bomb
on El Al flight 76 in 1968.

1583
02:33:38,376 --> 02:33:40,173
He was working
on another bomb
last August.

1584
02:33:40,245 --> 02:33:41,336
I could go on
and on with this.

1585
02:33:41,413 --> 02:33:43,972
According to evidence
nobody has seen.

1586
02:33:44,049 --> 02:33:46,881
If these
people committed crimes,
we should have arrested them.

1587
02:33:46,951 --> 02:33:48,441
Like Eichmann.

1588
02:33:48,953 --> 02:33:50,818
If these guys live,
Israelis die.

1589
02:33:50,888 --> 02:33:54,825
Whatever doubts you have,
Avner, you know this is true.

1590
02:34:04,468 --> 02:34:06,733
You did well,
but you're unhappy.

1591
02:34:06,805 --> 02:34:09,171
I killed seven men.
Not Salameh.

1592
02:34:10,007 --> 02:34:11,475
We'll get him, of course.

1593
02:34:14,745 --> 02:34:16,713
You think you were
the only team?

1594
02:34:17,349 --> 02:34:20,182
It's a big operation.
You were only a part.

1595
02:34:20,451 --> 02:34:22,248
Does that assuage your guilt?

1596
02:34:23,487 --> 02:34:25,388
Did we accomplish
anything at all?

1597
02:34:25,790 --> 02:34:28,554
Every man we killed
has been replaced by worse.

1598
02:34:28,627 --> 02:34:31,424
Why cut my fingernails?
They'll grow back.

1599
02:34:31,695 --> 02:34:34,164
Did we kill to replace
the terrorist leadership...

1600
02:34:34,231 --> 02:34:35,596
or the Palestinian leadership?

1601
02:34:35,666 --> 02:34:37,361
You tell me what we've done.

1602
02:34:37,434 --> 02:34:39,164
You killed them
for the sake of a country...

1603
02:34:39,236 --> 02:34:40,465
you now choose to abandon.

1604
02:34:41,972 --> 02:34:45,875
The country
your mother and father built,
that you were born into.

1605
02:34:45,943 --> 02:34:48,639
You killed them for Munich,
for the future, for peace.

1606
02:34:50,481 --> 02:34:53,610
There's no peace
at the end of this,
no matter what you believe.

1607
02:34:53,684 --> 02:34:56,881
You know this is true.
Here's what I know.

1608
02:34:57,087 --> 02:34:59,078
Your father is sick,
your mother will be alone.

1609
02:34:59,156 --> 02:35:02,353
You're a sabra.
Your wife and daughter
are sabras.

1610
02:35:03,295 --> 02:35:05,489
What I came to say
is this...

1611
02:35:06,698 --> 02:35:08,029
come home.

1612
02:35:22,346 --> 02:35:24,315
Come to my house
for dinner tonight.

1613
02:35:26,150 --> 02:35:28,175
Come on.
You're a Jew,
you're a stranger.

1614
02:35:28,253 --> 02:35:30,880
It's written someplace
or other that I'm meant to...

1615
02:35:30,954 --> 02:35:33,650
ask you to come
and break bread with me.

1616
02:35:34,225 --> 02:35:38,787
So break bread with me,
Ephraim.

1617
02:35:42,766 --> 02:35:43,825
No.
