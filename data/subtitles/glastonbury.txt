WE WANT IT HARDCORE.
BRING IT ON. COME ON.
FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES,
WHEN IT WAS
TRULY AN ISLAND
IN THE FLOODS AND
MARSHES SURROUNDING IT,
GLASTONBURY HAS BEEN
A PLACE OF REFUGE
OR PILGRIMAGE FOR SAINTS,
MYSTICS AND HOLY MEN.
MANY OF THEM SETTLED
THERE AS HERMITS,
FINALLY ADDING
THEIR BONES
TO THE COLLECTION
OF SACRED RELICS.
GLASTONBURY IS
BUILT ON A LEGEND,
THE MOST REMARKABLE
IN CHRISTENDOM.
ACCORDING TO THE SACRED
HISTORIES OF ENGLAND,
IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER
THE CRUCIFIXION
THAT ST. JOSEPH
OF ARIMATHEA
FIRST APPEARED
IN GLASTONBURY.
HE HAD BEEN TO
ENGLAND BEFORE,
TO CORNWALL, DURING HIS
DAYS AS A TIN TRADER.
AND IT'S CLAIMED IN
WEST COUNTRY FOLKLORE
THAT ON ONE OCCASION,
HE BROUGHT WITH HIM HIS
NEPHEW, JESUS CHRIST.
THERE ARE EVEN
LEGENDS WHICH STATE
THAT JESUS HIMSELF
VISITED GLASTONBURY.

"HAVE YOU SEEN
THOSE FUNNY PEOPLE ON THE ROAD?"
I SAID: "NO, WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THEM?"
"WELL," SHE SAID, "THEY
CALL THEM HIPPIES".
I SAID, "REALLY, WHAT
DO THEY LOOK LIKE?"
WELL, WE'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT THE PLACE,
BECAUSE THE VIBES AND
THE LAND AROUND HERE,
SORT OF, ARE VERY NICE
AND PEACEFUL, YOU KNOW?
-THE WHAT?
-THE VIBES.
WHAT'S THAT? -THE VIBRATIONS
FROM THE GROUND, YOU KNOW?
NO, I WENT INTO THE BLUES FESTIVAL
AT THE SHOWGROUND,
THE BATH BLUES FESTIVAL, IN 1970.
I DIDN'T SEE
A FENCE ANYWHERE,
SO I FELL IN LOVE WITH
THE WHOLE IDEA OF IT.
ALL THESE LOVELY PEOPLE,
LOVELY MUSIC,
LOVELY WEATHER,
LOVELY FIELDS AND...

IT SEEMS, I THINK,

SLIGHTLY INCONGRUOUS
TO SITE A FESTIVAL HERE,
IN THE HEART OF
A VERY QUIET,
PEACEFUL
COUNTRYSIDE.
NO, IT'S A SUPER
PLACE FOR IT.
IT'S ABSOLUTELY IDEAL.
THERE'S A KIND OF A
EUPHORIA DOWN HERE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S AWAY
FROM THE AWFUL REALITIES OF LIFE.
IT'S A NICE PLACE.
THE VALE OF AVALON,
AND GLASTONBURY
AND ALL THE MYSTIQUE
SURROUNDING IT,
YOU KNOW, IT'S A
NICE PLACE FOR IT.
YOU MAKE IT SOUND VERY ROMANTIC,
BUT, SURELY HARD CASH IS REALLY

TO DO SOMETHING.

THANK YOU.
WELL, IT WAS A SUCCESS, MUSICALLY.
IT WAS SUPER.
IT WAS A LOVELY DAY.
BUT IT WAS A LOSS,
FINANCIALLY.
I'VE LOST A BIT OF MONEY.
WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN?
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T GOT
COURAGE ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT.
I JUST THINK IT'S GREAT,
SHOULDN'T END. NEVER END.
YOU WANT TO GO ON FOREVER, DO YOU?
YEAH, FOR A
MILLION YEARS.
IT WASN'T REALLY
THE BEST OF FARMS,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
AND HE WAS ALWAYS
KEEN ON MUSIC.
AS A FAMILY,
WE WERE ALWAYS KEEN ON MUSIC,
WEREN'T WE?
-MM-HMM.
WE USED TO SING AROUND
THE PIANO, MOSTLY HYMNS,
BUT THAT WAS
OUR ENTERTAINMENT.
YEAH, THERE IS A
NON-CONFORMIST TRADITION
IN THE WEST COUNTRY
THAT WE WERE KIND OF THE CENTRE OF.
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A LOT OF... UNCLES
THAT WERE METHODIST
MINISTERS AND THINGS.
AND MY FATHER
WAS A PREACHER.
PLEASE DO NOT PISS IN THE DITCHES.
OR IN THE HEDGES.
IT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
FOR ONE PERSON TO DO IT,
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE,
IT ALL GETS INTO
THE DRAINAGE
AND POLLUTES
THE WATERCOURSES
AROUND GLASTONBURY.
AND IT'S ONE OF
THE CONDITIONS
OF GETTING OUR
LICENCE NEXT YEAR
THAT WE SORT IT OUT.
SO IF YOU COULD ALL
PLEASE USE THE TOILET
FACILITIES PROVIDED,
THEN THERE'LL BE
A GLASTONBURY NEXT YEAR.
THERE WERE SOME NEWCOMERS
THAT ACTUALLY CAME
TO THE VILLAGE.
AND THEY SAID, "WHAT
ARE THE EAVISES LIKE?"
"WELL, EAVISES,
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE VERY,
VERY CLEVER,
BUT THEY GOT NO
RESPECT FOR THE LAW".
THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY,
LOOKING AT MY
LICENSING RECORD.
WE WERE WEANED ON
ALL THAT RATHER LEFT-WING,
SORT OF LIBERAL STUFF
ABOUT WAR AND...
ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIBERTY.
BUT THAT'S ALL PART OF
THE METHODIST
BACKGROUND THAT I'VE HAD.
WHEN I SAW PEOPLE
PROTESTING ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR
AND WHAT WITH THE MUSIC
AND WOODSTOCK THING AS WELL,
IT ALL FITTED ME
ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY.
BUT THE SECOND FESTIVAL WAS
THE PYRAMID FESTIVAL IN '71.
AND IT WAS A FREE FESTIVAL.
THE HIPPIES DID
THAT ONE ON THEIR OWN
WITH A CHAP
CALLED ANDREW KERR.
YOU SEE,
WE CAN'T TELL HOW...
WHAT GOOD WILL COME OUT
OF IT UNTIL WE TRY IT.
ANDREW WORKED
FOR RANDOLPH CHURCHILL.
AND ARABELLA, WINSTON
CHURCHILL'S GRANDDAUGHTER,
TURNED UP AS WELL.
SHE WAS 21, AND SHE HAD
RECENTLY COME INTO SOME MONEY.
SO BETWEEN THEM, THEY
MADE IT HAPPEN, BASICALLY.

A LOT OF FEELING
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?
AND IT'S ROMANTIC,
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND...
THOUGH TO THE
HIPPIES, THE GLASTONBURY FAIR
HAS BEEN A TIME OF PEACE
AND HAPPINESS TO EVERYONE,
THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN
ASPECTS OF IT THAT HAVE DISTURBED
WHAT THEY CALL
THE "STRAIGHT" SOCIETY.
THAT'S JUST ABOUT
EVERYONE BUT THEMSELVES.
ASPECTS SUCH AS
THE FREE LOVEMAKING,
THE FERTILITY RITES,
THE NAKED DANCING,
AND MOST OF ALL,
THE DRUG-TAKING.
SOMERSET COUNTY POLICE
DRUG SQUAD
HAVE BEEN MINGLING WITH THE
HIPPIES THROUGHOUT THE FESTIVAL.
AND OTHER POLICE HAVE
BEEN KEEPING AN EYE
ON WHAT'S GOING ON
THROUGH BINOCULARS.
I THOUGHT IT A BIT SCARY,
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL
ON DRUGS AND THINGS.
AND IT WAS VERY ACIDY
IN THOSE DAYS;
A LOT OF ACID AROUND,
YOU KNOW?
THOUGH I REALLY ENJOYED
THE WHOLE FESTIVAL CONCEPT,
AND THE POLITICS
OF IT, YOU KNOW,
THE MOOD OF IT
AND EVERYTHING.
BUT THE DRUGS DIDN'T REALLY
ENTER INTO IT FOR ME.
BECAUSE IN A FUNNY KIND OF WAY
WE'RE QUITE PURITANICAL.
WE DON'T DRINK MUCH AND
REALLY GET MORE PLEASURE
FROM WORKING THAN
YOU DO FROM PARTYING.

LISTEN, I WAS BORN
IN GLASTONBURY.
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.
YOU... YOU'RE JUST
ABUSING ALL THE THINGS
THAT GLASTONIANS
STAND FOR.
WELL, I CAME TO GLASTONBURY
BECAUSE IT'S A
SPIRITUAL CENTRE,
BECAUSE CHRIST
CAME HERE AS A CHILD,
BECAUSE THE HOLY GRAIL
IS BURIED HERE,
AND BECAUSE...
BECAUSE IT'S GLASTONBURY.
I FEEL THAT IT'S
A PERFECT DISGRACE,
AND I OBJECT TO ALL
THE FILTH AND FLIES
THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT
ABOUT OUR HEDGEROWS.
A NUMBER OF THEM DO,
AND I MEAN DO,
SMELL TO HIGH HEAVEN.
IT'S NOT JUST A...
SLIGHT QUESTION OF B.O.,
IT'S REALLY EVIL-SMELLING
IN SOME CASES.
SOMEBODY HAS
TO MAKE A STAND
AGAINST THESE VERY DIRTY,
VERY UNWASHED PEOPLE.
I'M NOT SAYING, OF COURSE, THAT
THEY'RE ALL DIRTY AND ALL UNWASHED,
BUT THEY DO GIVE
A LOT OF OFFENCE.
PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE
FOR VARIOUS REASONS
FOR MANY, MANY CENTURIES.
I DO GET CONCERNED THAT A
MINORITY GROUP LIKE THIS,
WHICH WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO MAKE THEIR HOME HERE,
BEING HOUNDED BY A SECTION OF
THE COMMUNITY OUT OF THE TOWN.
WILL YOU BE GOING TO THE FESTIVAL?
I DON'T KNOW YET.
I MIGHT.
YEAH, I'M GOING
WITH A TOMMY GUN.
YOU'RE GOING WITH
A TOMMY GUN, WHY'S THAT?
HAH!

RIGHT.
SMOKE MORE WEED,
I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH.
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU
AT A LATER DATE.
AT GLASTONBURY, WE
HAVE THE TEEPEE FIELD.
IT ENABLES PEOPLE
TO REALISE, PERHAPS,
THAT WHAT MAKES
PEOPLE HAPPY IN LIFE
ISN'T THE LEVEL OF MATERIAL
CONSUMPTION THAT THEY CAN ENJOY,
BUT ACTUALLY
A CLOSENESS TO NATURE
AND A WEALTH OF
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS AROUND THEM.
THE ETHOS THAT GOES
WITH TEEPEE LIVING
IS REALLY THE NORTH AMERICAN
INDIAN ETHOS
THAT YOU LIVE LIGHTLY
ON THE EARTH.
YOU KNOW, WHAT GANDHI SAID,
"THERE IS ENOUGH
FOR EVERYONE'S NEED,
BUT NOT FOR
EVERYONE'S GREED".
I DON'T THINK IT'S
A HARD LIFESTYLE.
IT'S NOT AS HARD AS GOING TO
WORK AT A JOB YOU DON'T LIKE
FOR 40 YEARS TO PAY
A MORTGAGE ON A HOUSE.
IT INVOLVES HARD WORK
EVERY DAY
IF YOU ARE GOING
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.
NOTHING IS AS SIMPLE
AS FLICKING A SWITCH,
AND YOU'VE GOT
INSTANT ENERGY AND POWER.
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH OUR SOCIETY
AND ITS OVER-HUNGER
FOR ENERGY
THAT'S DRIVING THE WORLD
INTO CLIMATE CHANGE
AND RUNNING OUT
OF RESOURCES.
LIVING IN A TEEPEE,
YOU'RE VERY MUCH MORE IN TOUCH
WITH NATURE ALL THE WAY AROUND.
AT LEAST YOU'RE
AWARE OF IT.
YOU'RE NOT SHUT OFF
FROM IT INSIDE A BOX,
LOOKING AT A BOX
IN THE CORNER OF A BOX.
HERE WE ALL ARE,
BUT WE KNOW
THAT THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS,
YOU KNOW, IN HELICOPTERS,
POLICE, ET CETERA,
ET CETERA,
WHO DON'T SHARE
OUR SENSE OF...
WE JUST WANT TO BE
WITH ONE ANOTHER
AND JUST TO EVOLVE IN A
SLOWLY FEEDBACK SYSTEM.
SO I THINK THAT THE FESTIVAL
IS ACTUALLY AN INTERFACE
BETWEEN A LOVING VIBE
AND A RESENTFUL ONE.
HEY, WE'RE AT THE WATCHTOWERS.
THIS IS BASICALLY
THE GLASTONBURY FENCE.
MORE SECURITY DOWN HERE.

WATCHTOWER THERE.

OUR REAL BREAKTHROUGH,
YOU KNOW,
WAS WHEN MAGGIE THATCHER
CAME TO POWER IN 1979
BECAUSE THERE WAS
A HUGE BACKLASH TO THATCHERISM.
THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY PEOPLE HAD
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES WAS HERE.
SO THEY CAME
HERE IN THOUSANDS
AND WE WENT ON WITH
"MAGGIE OUT", YOU KNOW,
"MAGGIE OUT, OUT, OUT. MAGGIE OUT".
AND LITTLE EMILY WAS A
BABY, SHE SAID, "DADDY?"
SHE SAID, "ARE WE
GOING TO HAVE A MAGGIE OUT TODAY?"
YOU KNOW, SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS
A WAY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF.
SO...
BUT WE WERE ANTI-POLARIS
AND ANTI-CRUISE AT THE TIME.
AND SO I'D PUT
HER ON MY BACK
AND WE'D GO MARCHING.

BECAUSE IT WAS
GROWING SO QUICKLY.
I MEAN 1981,
IT WAS NICE,
ABOUT 20,000 PEOPLE.
BUT IT WAS VIRTUALLY
DOUBLING EVERY TIME WE DID IT.
AND, OF COURSE, THE
COUNCIL CRITICISED ME
AND THEN THEY TOOK ME
TO COURT EVERY YEAR,
AND I WAS PROSECUTED.
SO IT WAS A WHOLE
CAT AND MOUSE THING
ALL THROUGH THE '80s.
ME VERSUS THE COUNCIL.
WELL, QUITE HONESTLY,
THERE'S A BREACH OF HIS CONDITIONS,
FOR HIS MUSIC LICENSE,
CAPACITY CROWD OF 35,000,
HE'S WELL OVER THAT,
SO IN MY OPINION,
WE WOULDN'T BE
DOING OUR DUTY
IF WE DIDN'T PROSECUTE
HIM FOR THAT OFFENCE.
BUT WE'RE VERY PLEASED
THAT IT'S SO SUCCESSFUL.
BUT, UM, YOU CAN'T
REALLY CRITICISE US
FOR DOING
SOMETHING WELL.
QUITE HONESTLY,
I CAN'T SEE HOW WE'RE
GOING TO EVER STOP IT.
I MEAN, IF WE REFUSE TO GIVE THEM
ENTERTAINMENTS LICENSE,
THEY CAN STILL COME
ALONG AND SIT DOWN.
PROVIDING THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY LICENSE,
THEN HE CAN HAVE 100,000
AND THEN, NO WAY COULD
WE DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THE GUY WITH
THE WEE BEARD,
MICHAEL EAVIS IS PUNK
BECAUSE HE HAD, UH,
HE WENT LIKE, "I'M GOING
TO ORGANISE SOMETHING
THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T
WANT ME TO ORGANISE".
OH, I CAN'T
STAND IT.
I'M JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO GO WAZZ BEHIND CAR.
PHOENIX CITY.
NO, THE POLICE DON'T
COME ON THE SITE,
BUT THEY'RE VERY, VERY HELPFUL
OFF-SITE WITH TRAFFIC AND THINGS.
BUT WE NEVER HAVE
THE POLICE ON-SITE.
AFTER ALL, THE PEOPLE
ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME.
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY
FENCES MUCH, YOU KNOW.
THE PEOPLE DO WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO.
THEY'RE FREE TO,
UH, TO ROVE AROUND
AND THEN THAT'S WHY WE
DON'T GET THE PROBLEMS.
PEOPLE ARE BEING STRIP-SEARCHED.
SO WE'RE COMPLAINING
ABOUT POLICE HARASSMENT
IN A PEACEFUL WAY.
THERE'S ONE
FESTIVAL ORGANISER
WHO'S BEEN STOPPED
16 TIMES IN HIS CAR.
YOU KNOW, IT'S
GOT BEYOND A JOKE.
IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
GET OFF THIS BLOODY SITE
WITHOUT FIRST VISITING
THE POLICE STATION.
WE'VE BEEN GETTING
HASSLE OFF THE POLICE
JUST FOR COMING IN
AND OUT OF THE PLACE
TO GET SUPPLIES
AND THINGS.
PEOPLE ARE BEING BUSTED
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.
THIS SUS LAW IS REALLY BAD,
AND FAIR ENOUGH, IT'S BLACKS
WHO ARE USUALLY PICKED ON,
BUT THIS TIME THEY'RE
PICKING ON WHITES AS WELL
AND WE DON'T LIKE IT.
OH, IT'S TEEMING TODAY.
BLOODY HELL.
HAD 120 PEOPLE YESTERDAY.
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT IN
TWO HOURS LAST NIGHT.
IT'S BETTER IF YOU USE
A THICK LINE AS WELL,
BECAUSE SOME OF
THEM ARE 200 POUNDS.
YOU KEEP AN EYE

YOU NEARLY CUT HIS FINGER OFF!
WHY DID YOU PICK
THAT WALLET UP?
I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE
ABLE TO GET SOME DRUGS.
AND THE FUNNY THING
IS THAT THIS EVENT
WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED
IF I'D BEEN ON DRUGS.
IT WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED.
I REALLY HAVEN'T
GOT ANY SYMPATHY
WITH DRUG-TAKING AT ALL.
DO YOU KNOW, I
SPENT THE LAST HOUR
GOING AROUND WITH
OUR OWN DRUG SQUAD,
TAKING DOWN SIGNS
AND CONFISCATING.
I'VE GOT A BOOT
FULL OF STUFF.
AND WE'RE DOING
THAT ALL THE TIME.
I COULD GET... PUT AWAY
FOR THE DRUGS I'VE GOT
IN THE BOOT OF MY CAR.
BUT I'M GOING TO
OBVIOUSLY DISPOSE OF IT, YOU KNOW.
YEAH?
-HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
WHO COME TO
THE FESTIVAL DO TAKE DRUGS?
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
THEY DO OR NOT.

THIS IS GOING TO BE
CALLED WORTHYHENGE.
NO. IT'S NOT
A HENGE AT ALL,
IT'S A STONE CIRCLE.
-RIGHT.
STONEHENGE HAS GOT
BITS ON THE TOP.
STONEHENGE WAS A SPIRITUAL CENTRE
AND IT WAS A
POLITICAL CLAIM
OF "THIS IS
THE PEOPLE'S LAND".
BOUGHT AND LEFT
FOR THE PEOPLE
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO,
LET ALONE BUILT
BY THE PEOPLE
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.
DURING THE YEARS
WHEN STONEHENGE AND GLASTONBURY
WERE RUNNING
AT THE SAME TIME,
THERE WAS A KIND OF
RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO.
THE POORER PEOPLE,
THE RIFF-RAFF,
THE ONES WITH THE DOGS
AND THE BIG TRUCKS AND SO ON
TENDED TO GO TO
STONEHENGE WHICH WAS FREE.
AND IN A WAY THAT WORKED
VERY WELL FOR MICHAEL.
THERE WAS A
BIG CHANGE IN 1980.
THE TRAVELLERS WERE
HAVING A VERY HARD TIME IN SOCIETY.
THERE WERE
LOTS MORE OF THEM
BECAUSE THERE WERE LOTS
MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE.
LOTS MORE JOBLESS PEOPLE.
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY
THE SENSIBLE ONES
WHO CHOSE TO LIVE IN
THE BACK OF A TRUCK
RATHER THAN LIVING IN A CARDBOARD
BOX UNDER A BRIDGE IN LONDON.
THE WHOLE COUNTER-CULTURE
WAS SEEN BY THE THATCHERITES
AS PART OF MAGGIE'S
"ENEMY WITHIN",
JUST LIKE THE MINERS, JUST
LIKE THE PEACE MOVEMENT.
AND THERE WAS A
LOT OF OVERLAP.

SEE WHAT THEY'RE
DOING TO US.
WHEN WE HAD TO LEAVE STONEHENGE
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYWHERE TO GO.
WE MANAGED TO GET DOWN
AS FAR AS GLASTONBURY
AND WE HAD SUCH TROUBLE
WITH THE POLICE AND THE AUTHORITIES
THAT WE ENDED UP
OPENING A GATE
TO THE TOP CORNER OF MICHAEL'S
AND GOING AND SEEING HIM,
AND SAYING, "WELL, WE'RE REALLY
IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION HERE.
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF WE
STAY FOR A FEW DAYS?"
AND BLESS HIM, HE SAID
"YEAH, IT'S OKAY", WE COULD STAY.
SO IN WAYS THAT PEOPLE
WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT
HE'S SHOWN HIS HEART
AND GIVEN, YOU KNOW,
WHEN HE NEEDN'T
HAVE DONE AT ALL.
YEAH, I GAVE THEM
A SPACE AND WE GAVE THEM FOOD
AND WE GAVE THEM TELEPHONE,
BLANKETS AND THINGS.
BUT IT WAS KIND OF REFUGEE
STATUS FOR THOSE PEOPLE, REALLY.
THE COUNCIL SAID
WE HAD TO GET RID OF ALL THE ADULTS
THAT WERE NOT
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
SO WE HAD TO
STAGE AN EXODUS
FOR ALL THESE
BLOKES TO ACTUALLY LEAVE THE SITE.
AND THEY WENT DOWN
TO THE SOMERSET COAST
AND THEY ALL CAME BACK
IN SMALL LITTLE GROUPS
SO THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY'D GONE
BUT IN FACT THEY ALL
CAME BACK AGAIN.
THEY WERE THE FATHERS
OF THE CHILDREN.
SO, I MEAN, THEY HAD TO
BE TOGETHER BASICALLY.
YEAH, WE WERE PLAYING ALL SORTS
OF GAMES WITH THE AUTHORITIES
TO MAKE THE
FESTIVAL SUCCEED.

IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE
POLICE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN INVITED
ONTO THE FESTIVAL SITE
BY THE ORGANISERS.
LIGHT REFRESHMENT.
A HELICOPTER IS BEING USED
IN THE OPERATION FOR THE FIRST TIME.
BUT SOME AT THE FESTIVAL SAY
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN HEAVY-HANDED.
THE POLICE HAVE COME
GLARING OUT OF VANS
AND STUFF LIKE
THAT AT PEOPLE...
IT'S, UH, IT'S NOT
THE RIGHT ATTITUDE FOR A FESTIVAL.
THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF GOOD-NATURED BANTER
BETWEEN THE POLICE AND
THE SITE PEOPLE THERE.
HE DOESN'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
AND HE WANTS TO COME AND PUT SOME
HEAT ON THE SITUATION SO PEOPLE...
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
YOU WOULDN'T
LAST A SECOND WHERE I COME FROM.
THAT'S WHAT HE DID TO ME
WRISTS WITH THE HANDCUFFS.
WRONGFUL ARREST.
SEARCHED ME, DIDN'T FIND NOTHING.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE MASONIC HANDSHAKE.
YOU NEED AN
APPOINTMENT FOR THIS ONE...
AND THE TRAVELLERS'
CULTURE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE.
THERE'S THAT
SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS,
SLIGHTLY
ANARCHISTIC ELEMENT
THAT THERE'S A BIT
OF, SORT OF, MIDDLE AGES ABOUT IT.
THE BIT THAT LEADS TO THE
ENGLISH FREEDOM THING, YOU KNOW,
AND THE STRUGGLING AGAINST
AUTHORITY AND AGAINST CONTROL
AND AGAINST GOVERNMENT AND
POLICE AND ALL THAT KIND OF THINGS.
SO THERE IS QUITE AN
ATTRACTIVE EDGE TO THAT.
BY 1990, THE TRAVELLERS WERE
GETTING QUITE NASTY TO EACH OTHER.
THEY WERE FIGHTING OVER
DRUGS AND OVER GIRLFRIENDS
AND THAT SORT OF THING.
WE DID GET SERIOUS
PROBLEMS WITH THEM.
THE SECURITY PEOPLE WERE
ACTUALLY QUITE CORRUPT THEMSELVES
AND THEY WERE CONFISCATING
DRUGS FROM THE TRAVELLERS.
THEY WERE SELLING THEM ON.
AND WE TRIED TO
SEPARATE THE TWO SITES
AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK.
THEN THE RIOT IN 1990 WAS
REALLY, REALLY UNPLEASANT.
THEY WERE THROWING
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS AT THE SECURITY,
AND THEN THE POLICE CAME
ALONG WITH RIOT SHIELDS.
IT WAS 50,000 POUNDS
WORTH OF DAMAGE
AND THEY BURNT
FIVE LANDROVERS
AND THEY JUST OVERRAN
THE WHOLE PLACE
AND THEY CREATED ANARCHY AND
HATRED AND BITTERNESS AND RESENT...
MIKE EAVIS' BLOOD!
I TOOK THEM ON
FOR FIVE YEARS
AFTER STONEHENGE
HAD CLOSED DOWN.
WE GAVE THEM A SITE,
WE GAVE THEM WATER
AND DID EVERYTHING
FOR THEM AND THINGS AND THEY...
WE TOTALLY FAILED
AT THE END OF THE DAY.
I DECIDED IN 1990,
THAT WAS THE END
OF THE CONVOY.
THIS PLACE HERE IS GETTING
AS BAD AS STONEHENGE
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN.
THE FACT IS, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
IS GO ON THE PILTON SITE.
MR. EAVIS SAYS YOU'RE
NOT GOING ON THE SITE.
WHERE DO WE GO THEN?
WE NEED...
WE NEED SOMEWHERE TO GO.
THERE ARE PLACES YOU CAN
GO ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY.
I THINK THEY WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW
THERE WAS
SOMEWHERE THAT THEY COULD GO TO.
WELL, IF THERE
ISN'T, THERE ISN'T.
I'M NOT GIVING UP NOW.
I GOT THIS FAR. I'M GOING TO GET
IN THERE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
THERE'S NO
TRAVELLERS HERE THIS YEAR.

WE'RE GETTING BETTER
AT IT, YOU KNOW?
WE'RE USING HORSES NOW
IN WHAT WE CALL THE MOAT,
BETWEEN THE TWO FENCES.
WE'VE GOT
GALLOPING HORSES.
AND IT DOES TEND TO PUT
PEOPLE OFF JUMPING THROUGH
WHEN THEY SEE HORSES
RUNNING ABOUT.
COME ON MAN, IT'S ROLF.
-WE GOT TO GO?
-WE GOT TO GO.
THIS IS ROLFY, BABY.
THE MAIN PROBLEM
WAS IN THE YEAR 2000
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE FENCE
CAME DOWN ON A LARGE SCALE.
WE HAD, YOU KNOW, 300,000,
PEOPLE IN HERE.
ROLFY, ROLFY!
ROLFY, ROLFY!
THE ARGUMENT ABOUT NUMBERS
BECAME A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.
TEN PEOPLE KILLED BY
BEING CRUSHED TO DEATH
IN ROTHSKILL
THAT SAME YEAR.
SO ALL THE IDEOLOGY,
ALL THE FREE FESTIVAL MENTALITY
HAD GONE OUT THE
WINDOW BY THEN.
OUT, EAVIS OUT!
SO WE TOOK A YEAR OFF
AND WE ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM.
BUT IN THAT YEAR OFF, THOUGH,
WE DESIGNED THE FENCE.
I JUST SENT A POSTCARD
WITH THE DRAWING OF WHAT
I WANTED THEM TO BUILD
OFF TO TRACKWAY,
THE FENCING ENGINEERS
ON THE MONDAY MORNING
AFTER THE 2000 FESTIVAL.
I WANTED THEM
TO START ON IT
SO THAT I COULD TELL THE
POLICE AND THE COUNCIL
THAT I WAS DEALING
WITH IT.
AND THE MEAN FIDDLER
WERE INVOLVED AS WELL.
THEY GAVE US THE LICENCE
FOR 2002, NO PROBLEM.
GOING TO FESTIVALS, RIGHT, IS
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS TO DO.
AND I'M ALWAYS THINKING
THIS IS NOT MEANINGLESS.
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT GETTING TOGETHER
WE'VE GOT EVERY
RIGHT TO DO.
AND... THEY'RE GOING TO
FUCK US OFF THAT RIGHT.
YOU SEE THAT COMING?
WE'RE GOING TO BE
AWAY, SEPARATED.
YEAH, IT WAS ALL A BIT SHAKY, REALLY.
AND I WAS GETTING BAD PRESS
BECAUSE OF THE
MEAN FIDDLER INVOLVEMENT.

WANT THIS TO CARRY ON AS WELL.
IT SHOULD BE A LOT MORE BACK TO
HOW IT USED TO BE, UH, 20 YEARS AGO.
IT SHOULD BE A LOT
MORE, YOU KNOW,
"PEACE AND LOVE,
MAN", YOU KNOW.
TOO MANY RICH PEOPLE,
NO MORE TRAVELLERS.
IT WAS THEM THAT
STARTED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
SO, THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THEM IN.
THERE'S NO POINT
IN HAVING THE FESTIVAL.
'CAUSE THE SPIRIT'S
GONE FROM IT.
NO HEART IN IT NO MORE.
YEE-HOO!
I THINK I MISS SOME OF THE...
THE CHAOS OF
PREVIOUS YEARS.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WAS
ALL A GOOD THING, BUT, UM...
I THINK IT'S...
IT'S A SANITISED CARICATURE, IN A WAY
OF WHAT IT USED TO BE,
IN SOME WAYS.
BUT IN OTHER WAYS
IT'S VERY GOOD.
I NOW HAVE A
YOUNG DAUGHTER
AND I FEEL SAFE NOW

AND I APPRECIATE
THAT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF
ORGANISATION HAS TO OCCUR.
BUT WE'VE GOT
TO BE VERY CAREFUL
NOT TO BIG-BROTHER
TOO MUCH.
YOU KNOW, BOTTOM-WIPE,
NOSE-CLEAN AND ALL THE REST OF IT.
WE'VE GOT TO
BALANCE THE TWO.
I'M NOT A NEW AGE
TRAVELLER ANYMORE,
I'M A MIDDLE AGE SETTLER.
I'VE MISSED THE TRAVELLERS A BIT.
WE LOST THE EDGE, REALLY.
WE LOST THAT KIND
OF VIBRANT THING.
BUT, I WANT TO
GET THEM INVOLVED
RATHER THAN
JUST SITTING AROUND
BLOCKING UP ROADWAYS

THIS IS LOST VAGUENESS,

IT'S QUITE SORT OF...

-ROY!

-HOW ARE YOU?
-YOU DO LOOK VERY, VERY SMART.

BEEN DRESSED UP POSH LIKE THIS.
ROY, CAN YOU
SHOW US WHAT'S IN THERE?
YOU KNOW A
CHAPEL OF LOVE?
THE CHAPEL HAS EVERYTHING
FROM BOXING TO WEDDINGS.
...AS TO WHY
THESE TWO PERSONS
MAY NOT BE JOINED
TOGETHER IN HOLY MATRIMONY,
WILL THEY PLEASE SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD THEIR PEACE.
-I SHAGGED HER!

WE'VE FOUND A
PLACE IN HISTORY
AS SO MANY THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED HERE...
IN THE LAST 35 YEARS.
AND THE EXPERIENCE HAS
BEEN QUITE PHENOMENAL
FROM THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
AND BECAUSE OF THE VALUES
THAT THE FESTIVAL
BUILDS ITSELF ON
PEOPLE DO REALLY BELIEVE
THAT THEY ARE HAVING
A REALLY GOOD TIME
AND HAVING AN EXPERIENCE
THAT THEY CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE.
SO THEY GO AWAY FROM
HERE EXHILARATED
AND... AND FULL OF HOPE,
YOU KNOW,
FOR THE FUTURE.
