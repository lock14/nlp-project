00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,811
YOU KNOW, IT'S AWAY
FROM THE AWFUL REALITIES OF LIFE.

171
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,429
IT'S A NICE PLACE.

172
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,598
THE VALE OF AVALON,
AND GLASTONBURY

173
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,232
AND ALL THE MYSTIQUE
SURROUNDING IT,

174
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,317
YOU KNOW, IT'S A
NICE PLACE FOR IT.

175
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,105
YOU MAKE IT SOUND VERY ROMANTIC,

176
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:59,358
BUT, SURELY HARD CASH IS REALLY
THE OBJECT OF THE EXERCISE.

177
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,992
WELL, WE'VE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING.

178
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,077
THE FARMING IS
SUCH A DEAD LOSS,

179
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,246
AND WE'VE GOT TO LOOK TO
OTHER WAYS OF MAKING MONEY.

180
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,765
WHAT IS THE ONE THING
THAT'S WORRYING YOU

181
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,468
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT?

182
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,890
HOW MANY ARE GOING
TO GET HERE.

183
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,525
AND HOW MANY GATE-CRASHERS
WE'RE GOING TO GET.

184
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,734
MY MATE MAX'S BAND
WAS KNOCKED OUT,

185
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,819
AND THEY JUST PULLED
IT OFF HIS HAND.

186
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:44,903
IT'S BEEN
ALL STRETCHED.

187
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,988

THANK YOU.

214
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,611
WELL, IT WAS A SUCCESS, MUSICALLY.

215
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:50,696
IT WAS SUPER.

216
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,330
IT WAS A LOVELY DAY.

217
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,415
BUT IT WAS A LOSS,
FINANCIALLY.

218
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:55,033
I'VE LOST A BIT OF MONEY.

219
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,202
WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN?

220
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,922
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T GOT
COURAGE ENOUGH AT THE MOMENT.

221
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,090
I JUST THINK IT'S GREAT,
SHOULDN'T END. NEVER END.

222
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,709
YOU WANT TO GO ON FOREVER, DO YOU?

223
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,877
YEAH, FOR A
MILLION YEARS.

224
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,300
IT WASN'T REALLY
THE BEST OF FARMS,

225
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,934
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

226
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,553
AND HE WAS ALWAYS
KEEN ON MUSIC.

227
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,187
AS A FAMILY,
WE WERE ALWAYS KEEN ON MUSIC,

228
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,272
WEREN'T WE?
-MM-HMM.

229
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,975
WE USED TO SING AROUND
THE PIANO, MOSTLY HYMNS,

230
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,609
BUT THAT WAS
OUR ENTERTAINMENT.

231
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,482
YEAH, THERE IS A
NON-CONFORMIST TRADITION

232
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,650
IN THE WEST COUNTRY
THAT WE WERE KIND OF THE CENTRE OF.

233
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:31,904
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A LOT OF... UNCLES

234
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,623
THAT WERE METHODIST
MINISTERS AND THINGS.

235
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,791
AND MY FATHER
WAS A PREACHER.

236
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,129
PLEASE DO NOT PISS IN THE DITCHES.

237
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,298
OR IN THE HEDGES.

238
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,001
IT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT
FOR ONE PERSON TO DO IT,

239
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:48,720
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE,

240
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,423
IT ALL GETS INTO
THE DRAINAGE

241
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,591
AND POLLUTES
THE WATERCOURSES

242
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,226
AROUND GLASTONBURY.

243
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,845
AND IT'S ONE OF
THE CONDITIONS

244
00:14:56,845 --> 00:15:00,098
OF GETTING OUR
LICENCE NEXT YEAR

245
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,733
THAT WE SORT IT OUT.

246
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,352
SO IF YOU COULD ALL

247
00:15:03,352 --> 00:15:07,155
PLEASE USE THE TOILET
FACILITIES PROVIDED,

248
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,858
THEN THERE'LL BE
A GLASTONBURY NEXT YEAR.

249
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,759
THERE WERE SOME NEWCOMERS

250
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,378
THAT ACTUALLY CAME
TO THE VILLAGE.

251
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:31,546
AND THEY SAID, "WHAT
ARE THE EAVISES LIKE?"

252
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:32,631
"WELL, EAVISES,
YOU KNOW,

253
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,265
THEY'RE VERY,
VERY CLEVER,

254
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,884
BUT THEY GOT NO
RESPECT FOR THE LAW".

255
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,391
THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY,

256
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:44,559
LOOKING AT MY
LICENSING RECORD.

257
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,532
WE WERE WEANED ON
ALL THAT RATHER LEFT-WING,

258
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,785
SORT OF LIBERAL STUFF
ABOUT WAR AND...

259
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,488
ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIBERTY.

260
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,807
BUT THAT'S ALL PART OF

261
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:00,008
THE METHODIST
BACKGROUND THAT I'VE HAD.

262
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,501
WHEN I SAW PEOPLE
PROTESTING ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR

263
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:12,754
AND WHAT WITH THE MUSIC
AND WOODSTOCK THING AS WELL,

264
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:16,008
IT ALL FITTED ME
ABSOLUTELY PERFECTLY.

265
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,261
BUT THE SECOND FESTIVAL WAS
THE PYRAMID FESTIVAL IN '71.

266
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,895
AND IT WAS A FREE FESTIVAL.

267
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,064
THE HIPPIES DID
THAT ONE ON THEIR OWN

268
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,233
WITH A CHAP
CALLED ANDREW KERR.

269
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,487
YOU SEE,
WE CAN'T TELL HOW...

270
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,824
WHAT GOOD WILL COME OUT
OF IT UNTIL WE TRY IT.

271
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,949
ANDREW WORKED
FOR RANDOLPH CHURCHILL.

272
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:43,668
AND ARABELLA, WINSTON
CHURCHILL'S GRANDDAUGHTER,

273
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,287
TURNED UP AS WELL.

274
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,540
SHE WAS 21, AND SHE HAD
RECENTLY COME INTO SOME MONEY.

275
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,259
SO BETWEEN THEM, THEY
MADE IT HAPPEN, BASICALLY.

AND CHILDREN AND...

288
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,689
THERE WAS A LOT OF
LOVE ATTACHED TO IT.

289
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,324
A LOT OF FEELING
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

290
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,112
AND IT'S ROMANTIC,
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND...

291
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,533
THOUGH TO THE
HIPPIES, THE GLASTONBURY FAIR

292
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,787
HAS BEEN A TIME OF PEACE
AND HAPPINESS TO EVERYONE,

293
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,506
THERE HAVE BEEN CERTAIN
ASPECTS OF IT THAT HAVE DISTURBED

294
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,675
WHAT THEY CALL
THE "STRAIGHT" SOCIETY.

295
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,377
THAT'S JUST ABOUT
EVERYONE BUT THEMSELVES.

296
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:19,097
ASPECTS SUCH AS
THE FREE LOVEMAKING,

297
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,716
THE FERTILITY RITES,

298
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:21,800
THE NAKED DANCING,

299
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,519
AND MOST OF ALL,
THE DRUG-TAKING.

300
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,138
SOMERSET COUNTY POLICE
DRUG SQUAD

301
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,857
HAVE BEEN MINGLING WITH THE
HIPPIES THROUGHOUT THE FESTIVAL.

302
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,025
AND OTHER POLICE HAVE
BEEN KEEPING AN EYE

303
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,194
ON WHAT'S GOING ON
THROUGH BINOCULARS.

304
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,532
I THOUGHT IT A BIT SCARY,

305
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,786
BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL
ON DRUGS AND THINGS.

306
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,404
AND IT WAS VERY ACIDY
IN THOSE DAYS;

307
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,038
A LOT OF ACID AROUND,
YOU KNOW?

308
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,079
THOUGH I REALLY ENJOYED
THE WHOLE FESTIVAL CONCEPT,

309
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,163
AND THE POLITICS
OF IT, YOU KNOW,

310
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,332
THE MOOD OF IT
AND EVERYTHING.

311
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,586
BUT THE DRUGS DIDN'T REALLY
ENTER INTO IT FOR ME.

312
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,839
BECAUSE IN A FUNNY KIND OF WAY
WE'RE QUITE PURITANICAL.

313
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,642
WE DON'T DRINK MUCH AND
REALLY GET MORE PLEASURE

314
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,345

PLEASE REMOVE YOURSELVES

330
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,903
LISTEN, I WAS BORN
IN GLASTONBURY.

331
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,071
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

332
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,774
YOU... YOU'RE JUST
ABUSING ALL THE THINGS

333
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,942
THAT GLASTONIANS
STAND FOR.

334
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,787
WELL, I CAME TO GLASTONBURY

335
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,506
BECAUSE IT'S A
SPIRITUAL CENTRE,

336
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,209
BECAUSE CHRIST
CAME HERE AS A CHILD,

337
00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:03,928
BECAUSE THE HOLY GRAIL
IS BURIED HERE,

338
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,013
AND BECAUSE...

339
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,631
BECAUSE IT'S GLASTONBURY.

340
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,800
I FEEL THAT IT'S
A PERFECT DISGRACE,

341
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,434
AND I OBJECT TO ALL
THE FILTH AND FLIES

342
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,053
THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT
ABOUT OUR HEDGEROWS.

343
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,222
A NUMBER OF THEM DO,

344
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,941
AND I MEAN DO,
SMELL TO HIGH HEAVEN.

345
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,644
IT'S NOT JUST A...
SLIGHT QUESTION OF B.O.,

346
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,898
IT'S REALLY EVIL-SMELLING
IN SOME CASES.

347
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:24,532
SOMEBODY HAS
TO MAKE A STAND

348
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,235
AGAINST THESE VERY DIRTY,
VERY UNWASHED PEOPLE.

349
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,954
I'M NOT SAYING, OF COURSE, THAT
THEY'RE ALL DIRTY AND ALL UNWASHED,

350
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,573
BUT THEY DO GIVE
A LOT OF OFFENCE.

351
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,995
PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE
FOR VARIOUS REASONS

352
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:39,163
FOR MANY, MANY CENTURIES.

353
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,967
I DO GET CONCERNED THAT A
MINORITY GROUP LIKE THIS,

354
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,670
WHICH WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO MAKE THEIR HOME HERE,

355
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,924
BEING HOUNDED BY A SECTION OF
THE COMMUNITY OUT OF THE TOWN.

356
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,727
WILL YOU BE GOING TO THE FESTIVAL?

357
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,346
I DON'T KNOW YET.
I MIGHT.

358
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,514
YEAH, I'M GOING
WITH A TOMMY GUN.

359
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,683
YOU'RE GOING WITH
A TOMMY GUN, WHY'S THAT?

360
00:21:58,684 --> 00:21:59,768
HAH!

361
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:03,021
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE FESTIVAL, THEN?

362
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,105

00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,266

GET IN THERE.

393
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,435
RIGHT.

394
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,054
SMOKE MORE WEED,
I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH.

395
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:01,222
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU
AT A LATER DATE.

396
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,799
AT GLASTONBURY, WE
HAVE THE TEEPEE FIELD.

397
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,052
IT ENABLES PEOPLE
TO REALISE, PERHAPS,

398
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,220
THAT WHAT MAKES
PEOPLE HAPPY IN LIFE

399
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:37,558
ISN'T THE LEVEL OF MATERIAL
CONSUMPTION THAT THEY CAN ENJOY,

400
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,261
BUT ACTUALLY
A CLOSENESS TO NATURE

401
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,981
AND A WEALTH OF
HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS AROUND THEM.

402
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,318
THE ETHOS THAT GOES
WITH TEEPEE LIVING

403
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,572
IS REALLY THE NORTH AMERICAN
INDIAN ETHOS

404
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,740
THAT YOU LIVE LIGHTLY
ON THE EARTH.

405
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,628
YOU KNOW, WHAT GANDHI SAID,

406
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:56,429
"THERE IS ENOUGH
FOR EVERYONE'S NEED,

407
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,162
BUT NOT FOR
EVERYONE'S GREED".

408
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:06,838
I DON'T THINK IT'S
A HARD LIFESTYLE.

409
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,625
IT'S NOT AS HARD AS GOING TO
WORK AT A JOB YOU DON'T LIKE

410
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,344
FOR 40 YEARS TO PAY
A MORTGAGE ON A HOUSE.

411
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,766
IT INVOLVES HARD WORK
EVERY DAY

412
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,385
IF YOU ARE GOING
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER.

413
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,722
NOTHING IS AS SIMPLE
AS FLICKING A SWITCH,

414
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:27,976
AND YOU'VE GOT
INSTANT ENERGY AND POWER.

415
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:30,695
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH OUR SOCIETY

416
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,313
AND ITS OVER-HUNGER
FOR ENERGY

417
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,482
THAT'S DRIVING THE WORLD
INTO CLIMATE CHANGE

418
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:36,116
AND RUNNING OUT
OF RESOURCES.

419
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,073
LIVING IN A TEEPEE,

420
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,876
YOU'RE VERY MUCH MORE IN TOUCH
WITH NATURE ALL THE WAY AROUND.

421
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,720
AT LEAST YOU'RE
AWARE OF IT.

422
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,889
YOU'RE NOT SHUT OFF
FROM IT INSIDE A BOX,

423
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,508
LOOKING AT A BOX
IN THE CORNER OF A BOX.

424
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:13,521
HERE WE ALL ARE,
BUT WE KNOW

425
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:16,774
THAT THERE ARE OTHER BEINGS,
YOU KNOW, IN HELICOPTERS,

426
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,409
POLICE, ET CETERA,
ET CETERA,

427
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,112
WHO DON'T SHARE
OUR SENSE OF...

428
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,280
WE JUST WANT TO BE
WITH ONE ANOTHER

429
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:27,084
AND JUST TO EVOLVE IN A
SLOWLY FEEDBACK SYSTEM.

430
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,872
SO I THINK THAT THE FESTIVAL
IS ACTUALLY AN INTERFACE

431
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:34,675
BETWEEN A LOVING VIBE
AND A RESENTFUL ONE.

432
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,462
HEY, WE'RE AT THE WATCHTOWERS.

433
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,716
THIS IS BASICALLY
THE GLASTONBURY FENCE.

434
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:46,053
MORE SECURITY DOWN HERE.

435
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,942

SPECIFICALLY AND DIRECTLY
DEDICATED TO EVERYBODY HERE,

447
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,669
THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
STILL WANT TO LIVE BY THE SWORD...

448
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,476
AND WHO DON'T REALISE THAT

449
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,977
FIGHTING ONLY BRINGS
MORE FIGHTING.

450
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,682
IF YOU WANT PEACE, THERE
IS ONLY ONE WAY TO GET IT.

451
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:07,935
WE COME...

452

AND DO A MILLION MORE GIGS,

463
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:37,391
I'LL NEVER
FORGET THAT, MATE.

464
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:38,476
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,967
I'M SO LOOKING FORWARD

466
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,871
LOVELY WEDDING.

467
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,573

WE'LL PICK YOU UP AND BRING YOU

THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY PEOPLE HAD
TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES WAS HERE.

684
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,444
SO THEY CAME
HERE IN THOUSANDS

685
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:26,079
AND WE WENT ON WITH
"MAGGIE OUT", YOU KNOW,

686
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,782
"MAGGIE OUT, OUT, OUT. MAGGIE OUT".

687
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:30,950
AND LITTLE EMILY WAS A
BABY, SHE SAID, "DADDY?"

688
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:33,670
SHE SAID, "ARE WE
GOING TO HAVE A MAGGIE OUT TODAY?"

689
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,924
YOU KNOW, SHE THOUGHT THAT WAS
A WAY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF.

690
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,626
SO...

691
00:44:39,626 --> 00:44:42,879
BUT WE WERE ANTI-POLARIS
AND ANTI-CRUISE AT THE TIME.

692
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,964
AND SO I'D PUT
HER ON MY BACK

693
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,598
AND WE'D GO MARCHING.

THE IMAGE THAT
CAME TO MY MIND

701
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:15,963
WAS THIS WAS LIKE ONE OF
THE HUGE MEDIEVAL ARMIES

702
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:21,918

WITH ITS TENTS ALL OVER THE FIELDS.

GETS BIGGER.

704
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,678

SEEN IN THIS COUNTRY

705
00:45:31,678 --> 00:45:33,846
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS,

706
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:37,100
IS THE GROWTH IN
THE ARMS INDUSTRIES,

707
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,269
IN TELEPHONE TAPPING,

708
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:43,072

00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:47,944
IN NEW MEASURES CONTROLLING THE
DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS OF OUR PEOPLE.

710
00:45:51,198 --> 00:45:53,366
THERE IS NOW A TIME...

711
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,704
FOR A JUST SELF-RESPECT

712
00:45:57,704 --> 00:46:01,507
TO BE BUILT AGAIN
AMONGST OUR PEOPLE.

713
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,761
THIS HAS NOT ONLY
BEEN A NATION

714
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,464
OF MONEY-MAKERS
AND IMPERIALISTS.

715
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:10,717
IT'S BEEN A NATION OF
INVENTORS, OF WRITERS,

716
00:46:10,717 --> 00:46:13,436
A NATION OF THEATRE
AND MUSICIANS,

717
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,055
AN ALTERNATIVE NATION.

718
00:46:15,055 --> 00:46:17,774
AND IT IS THIS
ALTERNATIVE NATION

719
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,393

759
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,293
WELL, IN THE OLD HIPPY DAYS,

760
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,912
IT WAS ALL AT LOVE AND
PEACE AND FLOWER POWER,

761
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:27,546

SORT OF THING BUT...

763
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,418
BUT NOW IT'S MORE POLITICALLY
ORIENTATED, IN SO MUCH IT'S C.N.D.

764
00:49:32,419 --> 00:49:34,053
IT HASN'T REALLY
CHANGED A LOT.

765
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,222
I THINK THE HIPPIES HAVE HAD THEIR
HAIR CUT AND THEY'VE GOT KIDS NOW

766
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,841
AND ALL THE KIDS ARE HERE.
THEY'RE IN THE PLAY AREA.

I THINK THE NUMBERS CAME

784
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,568
BEFORE WE WERE READY
FOR THEM, REALLY.

785
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,736
BECAUSE IT WAS
GROWING SO QUICKLY.

786
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,371
I MEAN 1981,
IT WAS NICE,

787
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,990
ABOUT 20,000 PEOPLE.

788
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,709
BUT IT WAS VIRTUALLY
DOUBLING EVERY TIME WE DID IT.

789
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,328
AND, OF COURSE, THE
COUNCIL CRITICISED ME

790
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:49,962
AND THEN THEY TOOK ME
TO COURT EVERY YEAR,

791
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,581
AND I WAS PROSECUTED.

792
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,215
SO IT WAS A WHOLE
CAT AND MOUSE THING

793
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,834
ALL THROUGH THE '80s.

794
00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:57,554
ME VERSUS THE COUNCIL.

795
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,256
WELL, QUITE HONESTLY,
THERE'S A BREACH OF HIS CONDITIONS,

796
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,510
FOR HIS MUSIC LICENSE,
CAPACITY CROWD OF 35,000,

797
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,678
HE'S WELL OVER THAT,
SO IN MY OPINION,

798
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:07,313
WE WOULDN'T BE
DOING OUR DUTY

799
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,482
IF WE DIDN'T PROSECUTE
HIM FOR THAT OFFENCE.

800
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,651
BUT WE'RE VERY PLEASED
THAT IT'S SO SUCCESSFUL.

801
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:14,904
BUT, UM, YOU CAN'T
REALLY CRITICISE US

802
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,989
FOR DOING
SOMETHING WELL.

803
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:20,860
QUITE HONESTLY,

804
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:23,029
I CAN'T SEE HOW WE'RE
GOING TO EVER STOP IT.

805
00:51:23,029 --> 00:51:26,282
I MEAN, IF WE REFUSE TO GIVE THEM
ENTERTAINMENTS LICENSE,

806
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:27,917
THEY CAN STILL COME
ALONG AND SIT DOWN.

807
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,086
PROVIDING THEY DON'T
HAVE ANY LICENSE,

808
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,171
THEN HE CAN HAVE 100,000

809
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,339
AND THEN, NO WAY COULD
WE DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

810
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,419
THE GUY WITH
THE WEE BEARD,

811
00:52:19,419 --> 00:52:22,672
MICHAEL EAVIS IS PUNK
BECAUSE HE HAD, UH,

812
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,391
HE WENT LIKE, "I'M GOING
TO ORGANISE SOMETHING

813
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,560
THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T
WANT ME TO ORGANISE".

814
00:52:49,783 --> 00:52:51,417
OH, I CAN'T
STAND IT.

815
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,670
I'M JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO GO WAZZ BEHIND CAR.

816
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,923
PHOENIX CITY.

817
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:23,949
NO, THE POLICE DON'T
COME ON THE SITE,

818
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,203
BUT THEY'RE VERY, VERY HELPFUL
OFF-SITE WITH TRAFFIC AND THINGS.

819
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,822
BUT WE NEVER HAVE
THE POLICE ON-SITE.

820
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:30,456
AFTER ALL, THE PEOPLE
ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

821
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,625
WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY
FENCES MUCH, YOU KNOW.

822
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,244
THE PEOPLE DO WHAT
THEY WANT TO DO.

823
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,963
THEY'RE FREE TO,
UH, TO ROVE AROUND

824
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,665
AND THEN THAT'S WHY WE
DON'T GET THE PROBLEMS.

825
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,834
PEOPLE ARE BEING STRIP-SEARCHED.

826
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:44,003
SO WE'RE COMPLAINING
ABOUT POLICE HARASSMENT

827
00:53:44,004 --> 00:53:45,638
IN A PEACEFUL WAY.

828
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,257
THERE'S ONE
FESTIVAL ORGANISER

829
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,510
WHO'S BEEN STOPPED
16 TIMES IN HIS CAR.

830
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:53,763
YOU KNOW, IT'S
GOT BEYOND A JOKE.

831
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,082
IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME

832
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:56,483
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
GET OFF THIS BLOODY SITE

833
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,101
WITHOUT FIRST VISITING
THE POLICE STATION.

834
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,354
WE'VE BEEN GETTING
HASSLE OFF THE POLICE

835
00:54:01,354 --> 00:54:02,438
JUST FOR COMING IN
AND OUT OF THE PLACE

836
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:04,073
TO GET SUPPLIES
AND THINGS.

837
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,242
PEOPLE ARE BEING BUSTED
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

838
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,861
THIS SUS LAW IS REALLY BAD,

839
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:10,029
AND FAIR ENOUGH, IT'S BLACKS
WHO ARE USUALLY PICKED ON,

840
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,664
BUT THIS TIME THEY'RE
PICKING ON WHITES AS WELL

841
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,749
AND WE DON'T LIKE IT.

842
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,549
OH, IT'S TEEMING TODAY.

843
00:54:53,406 --> 00:54:55,040
BLOODY HELL.

844
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,378
HAD 120 PEOPLE YESTERDAY.

845
00:55:02,082 --> 00:55:04,801
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT IN
TWO HOURS LAST NIGHT.

846
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,969
IT'S BETTER IF YOU USE
A THICK LINE AS WELL,

847
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,054
BECAUSE SOME OF
THEM ARE 200 POUNDS.

848
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,672
YOU KEEP AN EYE
ON THE "W", AARON.

849
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:11,307
PUT YOUR CAP DOWN
ON THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE,

850
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,926
LOOK DEAD
SLY-EYED.

851
00:55:12,926 --> 00:55:15,094
THIS IS ALL WE'VE
DONE FOR FOUR DAYS.

852
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,516
HE'S ONLY LITTLE,
YOU NEARLY CUT HIS FINGER OFF!

853
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,601
WHY DID YOU PICK
THAT WALLET UP?

854
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:23,769
I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE
ABLE TO GET SOME DRUGS.

855
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,488
AND THE FUNNY THING
IS THAT THIS EVENT

856
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,657
WOULD NOT HAVE SUCCEEDED
IF I'D BEEN ON DRUGS.

857
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,191
IT WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED.

858
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:32,995
I REALLY HAVEN'T
GOT ANY SYMPATHY

859
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,614
WITH DRUG-TAKING AT ALL.

860
00:55:34,614 --> 00:55:36,248
DO YOU KNOW, I
SPENT THE LAST HOUR

861
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,417
GOING AROUND WITH
OUR OWN DRUG SQUAD,

862
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:41,120
TAKING DOWN SIGNS
AND CONFISCATING.

863
00:55:41,121 --> 00:55:43,289
I'VE GOT A BOOT
FULL OF STUFF.

864
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,457
AND WE'RE DOING
THAT ALL THE TIME.

865
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:48,177
I COULD GET... PUT AWAY

866
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,346
FOR THE DRUGS I'VE GOT
IN THE BOOT OF MY CAR.

867
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:53,049
BUT I'M GOING TO
OBVIOUSLY DISPOSE OF IT, YOU KNOW.

868
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,768
YEAH?
-HOW DO YOU FEEL

869
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,387
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE

870
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,106
WHO COME TO
THE FESTIVAL DO TAKE DRUGS?

871
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,724
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
THEY DO OR NOT.

872
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,893
I... I SUPPOSE THERE
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE...

873
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,230
THAT DO, I SUPPOSE. -STILL
ARE THEY? DO YOU THINK SO?

874
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,865
SHE WAS OVER THERE
WITH IT, THOUGH.

875
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:12,568
SHE WENT OVER
THAT WAY WITH IT.

876
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:16,906
DO YOU WANT
A BIT OF WINE?

877
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,074

NICE CUP OF

907
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,659
COME ON IN.

908
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:52,335
THE... SHIP.

909
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:10,769
THIS IS GOING TO BE
CALLED WORTHYHENGE.

910
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,404
NO. IT'S NOT
A HENGE AT ALL,

911
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,023
IT'S A STONE CIRCLE.
-RIGHT.

912
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,191
STONEHENGE HAS GOT
BITS ON THE TOP.

913
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:28,120
STONEHENGE WAS A SPIRITUAL CENTRE

914
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:29,755
AND IT WAS A
POLITICAL CLAIM

915
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,924
OF "THIS IS
THE PEOPLE'S LAND".

916
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,543
BOUGHT AND LEFT
FOR THE PEOPLE

917
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:34,627
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO,

918
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:36,795
LET ALONE BUILT
BY THE PEOPLE

919
00:58:36,796 --> 00:58:37,880
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO.

920
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,386
DURING THE YEARS
WHEN STONEHENGE AND GLASTONBURY

921
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,021
WERE RUNNING
AT THE SAME TIME,

922
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:48,724
THERE WAS A KIND OF
RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO.

923
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,893
THE POORER PEOPLE,
THE RIFF-RAFF,

924
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,613
THE ONES WITH THE DOGS
AND THE BIG TRUCKS AND SO ON

925
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,315
TENDED TO GO TO
STONEHENGE WHICH WAS FREE.

926
00:58:56,316 --> 00:58:58,484
AND IN A WAY THAT WORKED
VERY WELL FOR MICHAEL.

927
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,807
THERE WAS A
BIG CHANGE IN 1980.

928
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:27,230
THE TRAVELLERS WERE
HAVING A VERY HARD TIME IN SOCIETY.

929
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,314
THERE WERE
LOTS MORE OF THEM

930
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:31,016
BECAUSE THERE WERE LOTS
MORE HOMELESS PEOPLE.

931
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:32,101
LOTS MORE JOBLESS PEOPLE.

932
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,354
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY
THE SENSIBLE ONES

933
00:59:35,355 --> 00:59:38,074
WHO CHOSE TO LIVE IN
THE BACK OF A TRUCK

934
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,327
RATHER THAN LIVING IN A CARDBOARD
BOX UNDER A BRIDGE IN LONDON.

935
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,749
THE WHOLE COUNTER-CULTURE
WAS SEEN BY THE THATCHERITES

936
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,002
AS PART OF MAGGIE'S
"ENEMY WITHIN",

937
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,256
JUST LIKE THE MINERS, JUST
LIKE THE PEACE MOVEMENT.

938
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,874

LOT OF OVERLAP.

THERE WAS A FEW HUNDRED YARDS
OF FENCING THAT GOT KNOCKED DOWN.

950
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,575
THE AUTHORITIES
DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

951
01:00:29,575 --> 01:00:31,743
AND IT WAS
THOSE SAME PEOPLE

952
01:00:31,744 --> 01:00:33,912
WHO PROVIDED THE NUCLEUS
OF THE CONVOY

953
01:00:33,913 --> 01:00:38,250
THAT WAS DUFFED OVER BY THE POLICE
AT STONEHENGE BEANFIELD IN 1985.

954
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,588
MY KID'S IN HERE!

955
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,841
YOU HAVE NO ESCAPE.

956
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,814
GET OFF ME!

957
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,432
SOMEONE HELP ME!

958
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:54,517
HELP ME!

959
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,658
NOW, YOU STAY
THERE, BOY.

960
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:05,911
ON THE DECK! ON THE DECK!

961
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:06,996
NO.

962
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,080
ON THE DECK!

963
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,699
GET OFF!

964
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,867
NO!

965
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,502
DON'T ARGUE.

966
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,587
SPREAD YOUR LEGS.

967
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,542
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, MATE.
THEY SMASHED ME WINDOWS.

968
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:22,711
THEY HIT ME OVER
THE HEAD WITH TRUNCHEONS!

969
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,880
THEY BLOODY HIT ME
WHEN I WAS ON THE FLOOR!

970
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:27,049
SEE WHAT THEY'RE
DOING TO US.

971
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:33,021
WHEN WE HAD TO LEAVE STONEHENGE

972
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,190
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYWHERE TO GO.

973
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:38,444
WE MANAGED TO GET DOWN
AS FAR AS GLASTONBURY

974
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,697
AND WE HAD SUCH TROUBLE
WITH THE POLICE AND THE AUTHORITIES

975
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,866
THAT WE ENDED UP
OPENING A GATE

976
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,034
TO THE TOP CORNER OF MICHAEL'S
AND GOING AND SEEING HIM,

977
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:50,372
AND SAYING, "WELL, WE'RE REALLY
IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION HERE.

978
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,541
IS IT ALL RIGHT IF WE
STAY FOR A FEW DAYS?"

979
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:56,329
AND BLESS HIM, HE SAID
"YEAH, IT'S OKAY", WE COULD STAY.

980
01:01:56,329 --> 01:02:00,132
SO IN WAYS THAT PEOPLE
WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT

981
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:04,470
HE'S SHOWN HIS HEART
AND GIVEN, YOU KNOW,

982
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,638
WHEN HE NEEDN'T
HAVE DONE AT ALL.

983
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,425
YEAH, I GAVE THEM
A SPACE AND WE GAVE THEM FOOD

984
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,594
AND WE GAVE THEM TELEPHONE,
BLANKETS AND THINGS.

985
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:16,932
BUT IT WAS KIND OF REFUGEE
STATUS FOR THOSE PEOPLE, REALLY.

986
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:20,186
THE COUNCIL SAID
WE HAD TO GET RID OF ALL THE ADULTS

987
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:21,820
THAT WERE NOT
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.

988
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,523
SO WE HAD TO
STAGE AN EXODUS

989
01:02:24,524 --> 01:02:28,777
FOR ALL THESE
BLOKES TO ACTUALLY LEAVE THE SITE.

990
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,580
AND THEY WENT DOWN
TO THE SOMERSET COAST

991
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,749
AND THEY ALL CAME BACK
IN SMALL LITTLE GROUPS

992
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,252
SO THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY'D GONE

993
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:36,953
BUT IN FACT THEY ALL
CAME BACK AGAIN.

994
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,789
THEY WERE THE FATHERS
OF THE CHILDREN.

995
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,509
SO, I MEAN, THEY HAD TO
BE TOGETHER BASICALLY.

996
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,211
YEAH, WE WERE PLAYING ALL SORTS
OF GAMES WITH THE AUTHORITIES

997
01:02:46,212 --> 01:02:48,931

1019
01:04:38,991 --> 01:04:41,710
AND SUCK UP TO PEOPLE'S EGOS
JUST BECAUSE YOUR FACE FITS.

1020
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,329
WE DON'T WANT NONE OF THAT.

1021
01:04:43,329 --> 01:04:45,497
WE WANT EQUALITY.
WE WANT FREEDOM.

1022
01:04:45,498 --> 01:04:47,132
WE WANT TO BE

ON THE SATURDAY NIGHT WHICH
WAS THE SOLSTICE NIGHT,

1042
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:39,718
WHERE THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE CAME

1043
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:41,887

RIGHT THROUGH THE NIGHT,
RIGHT INTO THE DAWN

1046
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,660
IN A WAY IT GAVE US ALL,
ALL US TRAVELLING PEOPLE,

1047
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,294
A SORT OF PRIDE
IN OURSELVES

1048
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,463
THAT WE WERE DOING THE
MOST LIVELY THING IN THE FESTIVAL.

RIGHT, NOW...

1050
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,911
THIS IS
OUR FINALE.

01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,530
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY BAD NEWS.

1052
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,164
YOU SAY
WE'RE BAD NEWS.

1053
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,333
WE'RE THE GOOD
NEWS. WE WERE GOOD REPORTS LOOK,

I'VE BEEN DOING FOR YOU,

1056
01:06:48,021 --> 01:06:49,121
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

1057
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:50,755
YOU INVITED
YOURSELVES HERE.

1058
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:54,009
I GAVE YOU 19, OR
HOWEVER MANY TICKETS TO COME ON.

1059
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,094
I SAID THAT WE'D
LOOK AFTER YOU WELL.

1060
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,262
WE GAVE YOU THE BEST SHOW
YOU'VE HAD HERE FOR YEARS.

1061
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,347
I SAID WE'D LOOK
AFTER YOU WELL.

1062
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,515
WE GAVE YOU
THE ONLY SHOW THAT ISN'T JUST...

1063
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,684
WE FED YOU
FOR SIX WEEKS IN REAL STYLE.

1064
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,303
WE'VE LOOKED
AFTER YOU ALL THE WAY THROUGH

1065
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:05,937
AND OFFERED YOU
500 QUID AS WELL.

1066
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,022
SORRY, MATE. I DON'T CARE.

1067
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,641
ALL WE WANT IS
HALF YOUR MONEY

1068
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:10,275
AND A TENNER IN
OUR POCKETS EACH

1069
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,894
FOR THE WORK
THAT WE PUT IN.

1070
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:14,062
WE SPENT MORE THAN WE'RE
GETTING NOW JUST GETTING HERE,

1071
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,697
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING.
-I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

1072
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,782
I MEAN, YOU
SHOULD HAVE SAID.

1073
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:18,400
WE EXPECTED TO NOT
TO BE OUT OF POCKET.

1074
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,035
I'VE BEEN
RUNNING THIS SHOW FOR 17 YEARS

1075
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,738
AND I'VE BEEN FAIR
AND REASONABLE ALL THAT TIME.

1076
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,906
IF I HADN'T HAVE BEEN,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW, WOULD I?

1077
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,075
I'D HAVE BEEN CUT
TO PIECES BY NOW.

1078
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:30,329
WOULD I HAVE SURVIVED FOR
17 YEARS IF I'D BEEN A CUNT?

1079
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:31,963
WELL, WHY DID
YOU START IT THEN?

1080
01:07:31,964 --> 01:07:33,048
DEPENDS WHAT YOUR MARGIN IS.

1081
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,217
DEPENDS WHAT YOUR
MARGIN IS, YOU KNOW.

1082
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:37,385
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU KNOW,
MICHAEL'S A FARMER,

1083
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,088
AND FARMERS CAN BE NOTORIOUSLY
TIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1084
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,257
WE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD
HAVE PAID US A LITTLE BIT BETTER

1085
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,426
AND HE THOUGHT THAT
HE'D PAID US ENOUGH.

1086
01:07:45,511 --> 01:07:46,595
JOE?

1087
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:48,229
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY GUNS, DID WE?

1088
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,398
OH, SURE YOU HAD.
YOU HAD THAT TOY GUN,

1089
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,017
PLASTIC GUN.
-NO, MAN, NO.

1090
01:07:52,017 --> 01:07:54,736
WHERE DID I
GET THAT FROM? -I DON'T KNOW.

1091
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,905
MAYBE IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE
THAT BUGGERED ME AROUND.

1092
01:07:58,524 --> 01:08:00,158
I'M NOT ASHAMED
OF ANYTHING I DO.

1093
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,861
I MEAN IT'S JUST SO
PETTY, IT REALLY IS.

1094
01:08:02,862 --> 01:08:04,496
WHEN YOU'VE MADE A MILLION
POUNDS, OR WHATEVER YOU MADE,

1095
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,115
HALF A MILLION
POUNDS...

1096
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:09,368
TO GIVE US 500 POUNDS
IS WHAT I CALL PETTY.

1097
01:08:09,368 --> 01:08:11,002
RIGHT.

1098
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,705
AND THAT CONCLUDES THE
MUTOIDS AT GLASTONBURY.

1099
01:08:13,706 --> 01:08:16,425
TEN POUNDS EACH.

1100
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:19,127
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL,
REALLY. -ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

1101
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,296
SO WE'LL SEE YOU IN 2007,
WILL WE? -ABSOLUTELY.

1102
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,931
-YEAH, GOOD.
-GREAT.

1103
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,550
HERE YOU ARE LADS,
HERE'S YOUR TENNERS.

1104

GET IT DOWN YOU.

1105
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:29,438
YOU'VE ALL WORKED HARD
AND HERE YOU GO...

1106
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,522
CHEERS, MATE.

1107
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,141
I'LL TRY NOT TO SPEND IT ALL AT ONCE.

1108
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,225
THERE YOU GO,
A TENNER EACH.

1109
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:34,309

THERE WE ARE.

1110
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,197
I PAID YOU REAL
MONEY THIS TIME.

1111
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,816
OKAY.

1112
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:44,069
THERE'S OUR FUEL,
THERE'S OUR DEBTS, LET'S GO.

1113

IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE
POLICE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN INVITED

1126
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,879
ONTO THE FESTIVAL SITE
BY THE ORGANISERS.

1127
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,302
LIGHT REFRESHMENT.

1128
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,173
A HELICOPTER IS BEING USED
IN THE OPERATION FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1129
01:10:28,173 --> 01:10:31,426
BUT SOME AT THE FESTIVAL SAY
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN HEAVY-HANDED.

1130
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:34,679
THE POLICE HAVE COME
GLARING OUT OF VANS

1131
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,848
AND STUFF LIKE
THAT AT PEOPLE...

1132
01:10:36,849 --> 01:10:40,652
IT'S, UH, IT'S NOT
THE RIGHT ATTITUDE FOR A FESTIVAL.

1133
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,906
THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF GOOD-NATURED BANTER

1134
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:47,693

1135

OR YOU'LL GET FUCKING ARRESTED.

1145
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:27,816
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1146
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,984
THE MASONIC HANDSHAKE.

1147
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,575
YOU NEED AN
APPOINTMENT FOR THIS ONE...

1148
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:45,167
AND THE TRAVELLERS'
CULTURE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE.

1149
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,801
THERE'S THAT
SLIGHTLY DANGEROUS,

1150
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,970
SLIGHTLY
ANARCHISTIC ELEMENT

1151
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:52,224
THAT THERE'S A BIT
OF, SORT OF, MIDDLE AGES ABOUT IT.

1152
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:55,477
THE BIT THAT LEADS TO THE
ENGLISH FREEDOM THING, YOU KNOW,

1153
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,179
AND THE STRUGGLING AGAINST
AUTHORITY AND AGAINST CONTROL

1154
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,899
AND AGAINST GOVERNMENT AND
POLICE AND ALL THAT KIND OF THINGS.

1155
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:03,067
SO THERE IS QUITE AN
ATTRACTIVE EDGE TO THAT.

1156
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:17,165
BY 1990, THE TRAVELLERS WERE
GETTING QUITE NASTY TO EACH OTHER.

1157
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,868
THEY WERE FIGHTING OVER
DRUGS AND OVER GIRLFRIENDS

1158
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,502
AND THAT SORT OF THING.

1159
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,671
WE DID GET SERIOUS
PROBLEMS WITH THEM.

1160
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,627
THE SECURITY PEOPLE WERE
ACTUALLY QUITE CORRUPT THEMSELVES

1161
01:12:29,628 --> 01:12:33,431
AND THEY WERE CONFISCATING
DRUGS FROM THE TRAVELLERS.

1162
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:34,516
THEY WERE SELLING THEM ON.

1163
01:12:36,135 --> 01:12:37,769
AND WE TRIED TO
SEPARATE THE TWO SITES

1164
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,388
AND IT DIDN'T REALLY WORK.

1165
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:46,444
THEN THE RIOT IN 1990 WAS
REALLY, REALLY UNPLEASANT.

1166
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:54,569
THEY WERE THROWING
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS AT THE SECURITY,

1167
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:57,823
AND THEN THE POLICE CAME
ALONG WITH RIOT SHIELDS.

1168
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,217
IT WAS 50,000 POUNDS
WORTH OF DAMAGE

1169
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,836
AND THEY BURNT
FIVE LANDROVERS

1170
01:13:10,836 --> 01:13:13,555
AND THEY JUST OVERRAN
THE WHOLE PLACE

1171
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:17,342
AND THEY CREATED ANARCHY AND
HATRED AND BITTERNESS AND RESENT...

1172
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:19,510
MIKE EAVIS' BLOOD!

1173
01:13:19,511 --> 01:13:21,679
I TOOK THEM ON
FOR FIVE YEARS

1174
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,314
AFTER STONEHENGE
HAD CLOSED DOWN.

1175
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:25,483
WE GAVE THEM A SITE,
WE GAVE THEM WATER

1176
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,186
AND DID EVERYTHING
FOR THEM AND THINGS AND THEY...

1177
01:13:28,187 --> 01:13:29,821
WE TOTALLY FAILED
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

1178
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,158
I DECIDED IN 1990,

1179
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,327
THAT WAS THE END
OF THE CONVOY.

1180
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:38,496
THIS PLACE HERE IS GETTING
AS BAD AS STONEHENGE

1181
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,665
AND IT SHOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO HAPPEN.

1182
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,284
THE FACT IS, WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

1183
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:43,918
IS GO ON THE PILTON SITE.

1184
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,087
MR. EAVIS SAYS YOU'RE
NOT GOING ON THE SITE.

1185
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,706
WHERE DO WE GO THEN?
WE NEED...

1186
01:13:47,706 --> 01:13:49,340
WE NEED SOMEWHERE TO GO.

1187
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:52,043
THERE ARE PLACES YOU CAN
GO ALL ROUND THE COUNTRY.

1188
01:13:52,044 --> 01:13:53,678
I THINK THEY WOULD
LIKE TO KNOW

1189
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,847
THERE WAS
SOMEWHERE THAT THEY COULD GO TO.

1190
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:56,932
WELL, IF THERE
ISN'T, THERE ISN'T.

1191
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,634
I'M NOT GIVING UP NOW.

1192
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:02,303
I GOT THIS FAR. I'M GOING TO GET
IN THERE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

1193
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,057
THERE'S NO
TRAVELLERS HERE THIS YEAR.

1194
01:14:05,057 --> 01:14:06,691

IT'S A GOOD LIFE.

1522
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:39,659
YOU KNOW, I ENJOY IT.

1523
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,828
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL
NOT BE ON THE BBC,

1524
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:44,531
'CAUSE IF IT IS
ON THE BBC, WELL...

1525
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:46,700
FUCK THE BBC.

1526
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,334
GLASTONBURY HAVE
DONE A GOOD JOB

1527
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:50,503
OF KEEPING PEOPLE
OUT THIS YEAR.

1528
01:36:50,504 --> 01:36:52,122
THERE'S NO REBELS
IN HERE THIS YEAR.

1529
01:36:52,122 --> 01:36:53,756
THE FENCE HAS BEEN GOOD.

1530
01:36:53,757 --> 01:36:56,459
EVERYTHING'S
BEEN SORTED RIGHT.

1531
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,094
POLICEMEN BEEN DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

1532
01:36:58,095 --> 01:37:00,797
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
SORTED RIGHT OUT.

1533
01:37:00,798 --> 01:37:02,432
NOBODY'S BEEN HAVING
TOO MUCH ALCOHOL

1534
01:37:02,433 --> 01:37:04,601
AND NOBODY'S BEEN HAVING
TOO MUCH ANYTHING.

1535
01:37:04,602 --> 01:37:06,770
EVERYTHING IS SORTED.

1536
01:37:07,855 --> 01:37:08,939
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT?

1537
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:11,641
I'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE LAST SUNDAY.

1538
01:37:13,277 --> 01:37:15,445
IT IS AN OUTWARD
BOUND EXPERIENCE IN A WAY.

1539
01:37:15,446 --> 01:37:17,614
YOU'RE NOT CLIMBING
MOUNTAINS

1540
01:37:17,615 --> 01:37:19,783
BUT YOU'RE COPING
WITH THE EMOTIONS.

1541
01:37:19,783 --> 01:37:21,951
WHEN YOU DON'T
SLEEP FOR THREE DAYS, THREE NIGHTS,

1542
01:37:21,952 --> 01:37:24,120
IT TAKES A LOT
OUT OF YOU.

1567
01:39:09,843 --> 01:39:13,096

01:42:06,603 --> 01:42:08,771
-SUNDAY MORNING.

1603
01:42:08,772 --> 01:42:10,406
WE'RE GOING TO SEE
ROLF HARRIS NEXT, AREN'T WE?

1604
01:42:10,407 --> 01:42:13,109

01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:14,744
OLLY'S GEAR'S GONE.

1606
01:42:14,745 --> 01:42:17,447
OLLY'S GEAR'S GONE.

1607
01:42:17,447 --> 01:42:18,531
GONE FOR GOOD.

1608
01:42:21,251 --> 01:42:23,953
OH NO, I'VE STILL
GOT SOME MUSHROOMS.

1609
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:44,558
IT WASN'T UNTIL '86

1610
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:47,277
THAT THE FENCE
WENT RIGHT ALL AROUND THE SITE.

1611
01:42:47,277 --> 01:42:49,564
AND THE CHAP THAT
ACTUALLY INSISTED ON THAT

1612
01:42:49,565 --> 01:42:50,965
FOR MENDIP COUNCIL

1613
01:42:51,064 --> 01:42:52,698
GOT AN MBE FOR IT.

1614
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:54,867
SO HE GOT A LOVELY REWARD.

1615
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:01,374
LOADS OF KIDS CAME

OVER THE FENCE.

1617
01:43:02,459 --> 01:43:04,077
AND THEY WERE CITY KIDS

1618
01:43:04,077 --> 01:43:05,711
THAT HAD A LOT
GOING FOR THEM.

1619
01:43:05,712 --> 01:43:07,330
IT WAS KIND OF DANGEROUS

1620
01:43:07,331 --> 01:43:10,050
BUT IT HAD THAT KIND
OF VIBRANT FEEL TO IT.

1621
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:12,218
IT WAS REALLY,
FANTASTICALLY...

1622
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:13,837

WE'RE GETTING BETTER
AT IT, YOU KNOW?

1633
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:48,181
WE'RE USING HORSES NOW
IN WHAT WE CALL THE MOAT,

1634
01:44:48,181 --> 01:44:49,265
BETWEEN THE TWO FENCES.

1635
01:44:49,266 --> 01:44:51,434
WE'VE GOT
GALLOPING HORSES.

1636
01:44:51,435 --> 01:44:54,154
AND IT DOES TEND TO PUT
PEOPLE OFF JUMPING THROUGH

1637
01:44:54,154 --> 01:44:56,856
WHEN THEY SEE HORSES
RUNNING ABOUT.

1638
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:01,194
COME ON MAN, IT'S ROLF.

1639
01:45:01,194 --> 01:45:03,362
-WE GOT TO GO?
-WE GOT TO GO.

1640
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:04,447
THIS IS ROLFY, BABY.

1641
01:45:06,083 --> 01:45:08,251
THE MAIN PROBLEM
WAS IN THE YEAR 2000

1642
01:45:08,251 --> 01:45:10,953
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE FENCE
CAME DOWN ON A LARGE SCALE.

1643
01:45:10,954 --> 01:45:13,673
WE HAD, YOU KNOW, 300,000,
PEOPLE IN HERE.

1644
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:16,376
ROLFY, ROLFY!

1645
01:45:20,714 --> 01:45:23,433
ROLFY, ROLFY!

1646
01:45:28,305 --> 01:45:31,024
THE ARGUMENT ABOUT NUMBERS
BECAME A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

1647
01:45:31,024 --> 01:45:33,192
TEN PEOPLE KILLED BY
BEING CRUSHED TO DEATH

1648
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,811
IN ROTHSKILL
THAT SAME YEAR.

1649
01:45:34,811 --> 01:45:38,614
SO ALL THE IDEOLOGY,
ALL THE FREE FESTIVAL MENTALITY

1650
01:45:38,615 --> 01:45:39,699
HAD GONE OUT THE
WINDOW BY THEN.

1651
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:41,868
OUT, EAVIS OUT!

1652
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:45,121
SO WE TOOK A YEAR OFF
AND WE ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM.

1653
01:45:45,122 --> 01:45:47,290
BUT IN THAT YEAR OFF, THOUGH,
WE DESIGNED THE FENCE.

1654
01:45:47,290 --> 01:45:49,458
I JUST SENT A POSTCARD

1655
01:45:49,459 --> 01:45:52,161
WITH THE DRAWING OF WHAT
I WANTED THEM TO BUILD

1656
01:45:52,162 --> 01:45:54,330
OFF TO TRACKWAY,
THE FENCING ENGINEERS

1657
01:45:54,331 --> 01:45:58,134
ON THE MONDAY MORNING
AFTER THE 2000 FESTIVAL.

1658
01:45:58,135 --> 01:46:00,303
I WANTED THEM
TO START ON IT

1659
01:46:00,303 --> 01:46:03,005
SO THAT I COULD TELL THE
POLICE AND THE COUNCIL

1660
01:46:03,006 --> 01:46:05,174
THAT I WAS DEALING
WITH IT.

1661
01:46:05,175 --> 01:46:07,894
AND THE MEAN FIDDLER
WERE INVOLVED AS WELL.

1662
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:10,596
THEY GAVE US THE LICENCE
FOR 2002, NO PROBLEM.

1663
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:16,019
GOING TO FESTIVALS, RIGHT, IS
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE THINGS TO DO.

1664
01:46:16,019 --> 01:46:19,272
AND I'M ALWAYS THINKING
THIS IS NOT MEANINGLESS.

1665
01:46:19,272 --> 01:46:21,991
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT GETTING TOGETHER

1666
01:46:21,992 --> 01:46:24,160
WE'VE GOT EVERY
RIGHT TO DO.

1667
01:46:24,161 --> 01:46:26,329
AND... THEY'RE GOING TO
FUCK US OFF THAT RIGHT.

1668
01:46:26,329 --> 01:46:27,947
YOU SEE THAT COMING?

1669
01:46:27,948 --> 01:46:30,667
WE'RE GOING TO BE
AWAY, SEPARATED.

1670
01:46:32,285 --> 01:46:34,453
YEAH, IT WAS ALL A BIT SHAKY, REALLY.

1671
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:35,773
AND I WAS GETTING BAD PRESS

1672
01:46:35,774 --> 01:46:37,174

WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE A

I NEVER, I NEVER!

1714
01:48:54,344 --> 01:48:56,512
TYAS TOLD ME,
HE SAID,

1715
01:48:56,513 --> 01:48:58,681
"GET OUT THERE, AND
WHEN YOU SEE THE BBC

1716
01:48:58,682 --> 01:49:00,850
WHACK THEM WITH A STICK!"

1717
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:02,484
YEAH, I DON'T THINK WE'LL
BE SINGING "STRAIGHT TO HELL"...

1718
01:49:02,485 --> 01:49:04,103

RIGHT ON IT.

1720
01:49:05,739 --> 01:49:07,357
I COULD SEE YOU
LAUGHING YOUR HEAD OFF,

1721
01:49:07,357 --> 01:49:09,525
I CAN TELL YOU.

1722
01:49:09,526 --> 01:49:11,694
I SPOKE TO JOE AND HE SAID,

1723
01:49:11,695 --> 01:49:12,463
"I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY, MIKE,

1724
01:49:12,464 --> 01:49:13,764
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE STAGE".

1725
01:49:13,863 --> 01:49:16,031
HE SAID, "I REALLY
LOST IT, I'M AFRAID.

1726
01:49:16,032 --> 01:49:17,666
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY".

1727
01:49:17,667 --> 01:49:19,285
I THINK HE REALLY
REGRETTED IT.

1728
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:23,089
HELLO.

1729
01:49:23,089 --> 01:49:25,257
YOU ALL RIGHT, LADS?

1730
01:49:25,258 --> 01:49:26,876
BUGGER OFF.
YOU'RE NOT WANTED.

1731
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:32,849
SO THE FENCE BECAME KING

A GOOD THING.

1735
01:49:44,227 --> 01:49:45,861
IT'S NICE TO BE
MORE SECURE.

1736
01:49:45,862 --> 01:49:49,115
IT'S NICE TO KNOW THAT YOUR
STUFF'S NOT GOING TO GET ROBBED.

1737
01:49:49,115 --> 01:49:50,733
I REMEMBER THE FENCE AT
GREENHAM AND, YOU KNOW,

1738
01:49:50,734 --> 01:49:52,368
AND I THOUGHT,

1739
01:49:52,369 --> 01:49:53,987
"WHAT THEY NEED
HERE IS...

1740
01:49:53,987 --> 01:49:58,324
A LESBIAN CREW TO TAKE
THE FENCE DOWN, FRANKLY".

1741
01:49:58,325 --> 01:50:00,493
AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE
WANT THIS TO CARRY ON AS WELL.

1742
01:50:00,493 --> 01:50:04,296
IT SHOULD BE A LOT MORE BACK TO
HOW IT USED TO BE, UH, 20 YEARS AGO.

1743
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:05,915
IT SHOULD BE A LOT
MORE, YOU KNOW,

1744
01:50:05,915 --> 01:50:07,549
"PEACE AND LOVE,
MAN", YOU KNOW.

1745
01:50:30,857 --> 01:50:34,110
TOO MANY RICH PEOPLE,
NO MORE TRAVELLERS.

1746
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:36,278
IT WAS THEM THAT
STARTED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1747
01:50:36,279 --> 01:50:37,913
SO, THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO LET THEM IN.

1748
01:50:37,914 --> 01:50:40,082
THERE'S NO POINT
IN HAVING THE FESTIVAL.

1749
01:50:40,083 --> 01:50:41,167
'CAUSE THE SPIRIT'S
GONE FROM IT.

1750
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:43,335
NO HEART IN IT NO MORE.

1751
01:50:55,265 --> 01:50:56,883
YEE-HOO!

1752
01:51:01,771 --> 01:51:03,939
I THINK I MISS SOME OF THE...

1753
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,558
THE CHAOS OF
PREVIOUS YEARS.

1754
01:51:05,558 --> 01:51:08,811
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WAS
ALL A GOOD THING, BUT, UM...

1755
01:51:08,812 --> 01:51:12,615
I THINK IT'S...
IT'S A SANITISED CARICATURE, IN A WAY

1756
01:51:12,615 --> 01:51:14,783
OF WHAT IT USED TO BE,
IN SOME WAYS.

1757
01:51:14,784 --> 01:51:16,402
BUT IN OTHER WAYS
IT'S VERY GOOD.

1758
01:51:16,403 --> 01:51:18,037
I NOW HAVE A
YOUNG DAUGHTER

1759
01:51:18,038 --> 01:51:20,740
AND I FEEL SAFE NOW
WITH HER ON SITE.

1760
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:21,543
AND I APPRECIATE

1761
01:51:21,544 --> 01:51:24,544
THAT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF
ORGANISATION HAS TO OCCUR.

1762
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:26,162
BUT WE'VE GOT
TO BE VERY CAREFUL

1763
01:51:26,162 --> 01:51:28,330
NOT TO BIG-BROTHER
TOO MUCH.

1764
01:51:28,331 --> 01:51:31,050
YOU KNOW, BOTTOM-WIPE,
NOSE-CLEAN AND ALL THE REST OF IT.

1765
01:51:31,051 --> 01:51:33,753
WE'VE GOT TO
BALANCE THE TWO.

1766
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:35,387
I'M NOT A NEW AGE
TRAVELLER ANYMORE,

1767
01:51:35,388 --> 01:51:37,556
I'M A MIDDLE AGE SETTLER.

1768
01:51:39,726 --> 01:51:41,344
I'VE MISSED THE TRAVELLERS A BIT.

1769
01:51:41,344 --> 01:51:42,428
WE LOST THE EDGE, REALLY.

1770
01:51:42,429 --> 01:51:44,597
WE LOST THAT KIND
OF VIBRANT THING.

1771
01:51:44,597 --> 01:51:46,231
BUT, I WANT TO
GET THEM INVOLVED

1772
01:51:46,232 --> 01:51:47,850
RATHER THAN
JUST SITTING AROUND

1773
01:51:47,851 --> 01:51:50,019
BLOCKING UP ROADWAYS
AND STUFF, YOU KNOW.

1774
01:51:50,019 --> 01:51:53,822
THIS IS LOST VAGUENESS,
A FIELD OF ROY.

1775
01:51:53,823 --> 01:51:55,991
THAT WEIRD BEARD.

1776
01:51:55,992 --> 01:51:58,160
HE WAS A CONVOY BOY
IN THE '80s.

1777
01:51:58,161 --> 01:52:00,329
HE GAVE ME LOTS OF GRIEF.

1778
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:03,032
HE WAS THE LEADER OF THE
PACK, THE CONVOY PACK.

1779
01:52:09,005 --> 01:52:11,173
YEAH, THEY'RE ALL
CONVOY FOLK, REALLY.

1780
01:52:11,174 --> 01:52:12,792
IT'S QUITE EDGY,
IT'S QUITE SORT OF...

1781
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:14,960
-DO YOU FEEL MORE...
-ROY!

1782
01:52:14,961 --> 01:52:17,129
HEY, YOU MADE IT
IN THE END.

1783
01:52:17,130 --> 01:52:19,298
-HOW ARE YOU?
-YOU DO LOOK VERY, VERY SMART.

1784
01:52:19,299 --> 01:52:21,467
A TYPICAL TRAVELLER TYPE, HE'S
BEEN DRESSED UP POSH LIKE THIS.

1785
01:52:23,636 --> 01:52:24,720
ROY, CAN YOU
SHOW US WHAT'S IN THERE?

1786
01:52:24,721 --> 01:52:26,355
YOU KNOW A
CHAPEL OF LOVE?

1787
01:52:26,356 --> 01:52:28,524
THE CHAPEL HAS EVERYTHING
FROM BOXING TO WEDDINGS.

1788
01:52:28,525 --> 01:52:30,693
...AS TO WHY
THESE TWO PERSONS

1789
01:52:30,693 --> 01:52:33,946
MAY NOT BE JOINED
TOGETHER IN HOLY MATRIMONY,

1790
01:52:33,947 --> 01:52:38,818
WILL THEY PLEASE SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD THEIR PEACE.

1791
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:42,621
-I SHAGGED HER!
-WHO IS HE?

1792
01:52:42,622 --> 01:52:44,240
I SHAGGED HER!

1793
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:45,874
FUCKING SLAG.

1794
01:52:50,213 --> 01:52:51,831
ARE YOU SURE?

1795
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:53,465
ARE YOU REALLY
SURE ABOUT THIS?

1796
01:52:53,466 --> 01:52:55,084
THAT WASN'T ALL!

1797
01:52:58,888 --> 01:53:00,506

1799
01:53:02,675 --> 01:53:04,309
-NO, NOT A QUAKER.
-OR IS IT... IS IT QUACKERS?

1800
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,928
OR IS IT
QUACKERS?

1801

01:53:22,745 --> 01:53:24,913

1807
01:53:24,914 --> 01:53:27,082
IT'S ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT.

WE'VE FOUND A
PLACE IN HISTORY

2064
02:11:45,047 --> 02:11:48,300
AS SO MANY THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED HERE...

2065
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,934
IN THE LAST 35 YEARS.

2066
02:11:49,935 --> 02:11:53,188

FROM THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

2068
02:11:56,441 --> 02:11:58,059
AND BECAUSE OF THE VALUES

2069
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:00,228
THAT THE FESTIVAL
BUILDS ITSELF ON

2070
02:12:00,228 --> 02:12:01,862
PEOPLE DO REALLY BELIEVE

2071
02:12:01,863 --> 02:12:04,565
THAT THEY ARE HAVING
A REALLY GOOD TIME

2072
02:12:04,566 --> 02:12:07,285
