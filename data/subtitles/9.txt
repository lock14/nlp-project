Domnule Bond?
Da?
Sunt locotenentul Mathis|de la Fortele Speciale de Politie.
Acestea sunt acreditarile mele.
Par a fi in regula.
Veniti cu mine.
Obisnuiau sa spuna ca un spion bun|este un simplu spion,si inauntru si afara.
Trandafiri,figurine de Tanagra si Debussy.
Canta Debussy in fiecare dupa amiaza
de la apus pana era prea intuneric|ca sa mai poata citi notele.
Statea mult timp in cap, manca bomboane.
Isi lasa intestinele in jos|si le spala cu mana.
Ceva ce a invatat|in timpul calatoriei in Tibet.
M, ce ti-a dat?
Am uitat sa mentionez leii.
- Lei si...mai multi lei.|- Suntem inconjurati de lei.
Nu am venit aici|sa fiu devorat de simbolurile monarhiei!
Te avertizez, M, daca este o capcana...
Calmati-va domnilor.|Nu e nici o capcana, va asigur.
Leii sunt doar curiosi.|El are putini vizitatori.
Asta o pot crede.
Un rai veritabil, nu-i asa, domnilor??
Un rai fara Eva este o absurditate.
Un spion bun este doar un spion.
Nu bun. Grozav.
Cel mai mare spion din istorie, domnilor.
Adevaratul, unicul,|originalul James Bond.
- Domnii sunt aici, Sir James.|- Multumesc.
- Dragul meu Bond.|- Dragul meu M.
Ransome, CIA, Sir James.
J-Junior cipher c-clerk in m-my day,|nu-i asa, Ransome?
Yes, sir. JCC, class G, SIC to SCCT.|CIA, Washington DC.
Smernov, KGB, Sir James.
Ah, da. Inspector de teren.
Ikon 988, GPU, sectorul Siberian.
Imi amintesc de individul asta...Lenin, foarte bine.
organizator de prima clasa, gandire da clasa a doua.
Le Grand, Sir James.|Deuxième bureau.
Promovat in sfarsit de la micile vicii?
Arati incredibil de bine, James.
Timpul, dragul meu M,|nu exista intre peretii acestia.
- Astia nu sunt reali.|- Da, un stigat indepartat din infinita noastra lume.
Pe vremea mea|spionajul era o alternativa la razboi.
Spionul era membrul|al unei selecte si imaculate tagme preotesti,
devotat vocational,|sublim dezinteresat.
Aceasta este o descriere palida|a acestui acrobat sexual
insensibil ce lasa |femeile gafaind in urma sa.
-Ce vrei sa spui...|- Stii foarte bine ce vreau sa spun.
Ingamfatul acela|caruia i-ai dat numele si numarul meu.
Dragul meu James,cand ne-ai parasit|eram un departament mic,
sub-finantat, ridicol de prost echipat.
Era esential|ca legenda ta sa fie pastrata.
Fara un James Bond 007,|nimeni nu ne-ar fi respectat.
El si ale lui dispozitive nenorocite.
Trebuie sa ne folosim|de armele timpului nostru.
Am remarcat.
Tu, Ransome, cu acel truc cu garoafa|care s-scuipa cianura.
Ar trebui sa-ti fie rusine.
Rusii au inceput.
Si tu, Smernov,cu un arsenal|ascuns in bocancii aia grotesti.
Asculta-le cum zdrangane.
Si tu, Le Grand,cu otrava|diferita si mortala in fiecare din butonii tai zburatori.
Si tu, M,|cu stilourile tale aruncatoare de flacari.
V-V-Voi sunteti o gluma de spioni, domnilori.
Suntem in ultima jumatate|a secolului 20, Sir James.
- Chiar si tu trebuie sa recunosti.|- De ce ar trebui, daca eu ii pot face fata?
Priviti-mi gradina.|Acolo afara, este un trandafir negru.
Nu rosu inchis, negru.
Ca o aripa de corb in miezul noptii.
N-as schimba nici macar o singura petala|pentru nimic din ce are lumea voastra de oferit,
inclusiv un Aston M-Martin|cu accesorii mortale.
Aveti numai dispret pentru|proletariat, Sir James. Asta stim.
Daca nu v-as cunoaste bine, as spune|ca v-ati pierdut increderea in democratie.
Poti sparge sticla,|dar nu poti opri vremea.
Lucrurile merg rau. Am pierdut 11 agenti|in ultimile 2 saptamani - 7 ucisi, 4 disparuti.
- Tizul meu este printre ei?|- Ar putea foarte bine sa fie maine.
8 dintre ai nostri au primit de lucru -|2 la Pentagon.
- 16.|- KGB este deplorabil.
Nu pot calcula exact cifrele.
Inamicul a patruns|in cele mai secrete cercuri ale noastre.
- Ne citeste gandurile.|- Din ce stim,
este cu ochii pe noi acum.
Sunteti siguri|ca nu este unul sau m-mai multi dintre voi?
- Nu, nu.|- Sigur.
Pana trece pericolul, trebuie|sa fim uniti in apararea tuturor spionilor,
mari sau mici, indiferent de nationalitate.
Necazurile fac oamenii rai si ciudati,|dar de ce, in puterea unitatii voastre,
deranjati un domn|care s-a retras?
Avem nevoie de inspiratia ta de a ne conduce.
Te rugam da-ne beneficiul|incomparabilelor tale puteri de deductie.
- Pentru toti oamenii liberi si iubitori.|- Pentru glorioasa revolutie socialista.
Daca imi permiteti sa intrerup aceasta insiruire de clisee ,
este momentul zilei|pe care l-am stabilit pentru Debussy.
Poate acesta fi omul|care a castigat Victoria Cross la Mafeking?
Eroul de la Ashanti Uprising?
Ce geniu irosit|in serviciul unui imperiu prabusit.
De ce, in apogeul carieirei,|a decis Bond sa se retraga?
Mata Hari, dragul meu.
- Care este legatura?|- Femeia din viata lui.
- Nu pricep.|- A fost dureroasa lui datorie
s-o momeasca dealungul frontierei Spaniei|prin Franta,
unde a abandonat-o|in fata unui detasament de tragatori.
Chiar a iubit-o.
Deci, James?
Imi pare rau, batrane,|dar ce imi ceri e imposibil.
Poate asta i-ti va schimba decizia.
Dosarul meu vorbeste de loialitatea mea.|Dar nu, nici macar pentru ea, McTarry.
Imi pare rau, James.
Acela este semnalul lui McTarry . Fiti gata.
- Zero.|- On.
- Foc!|- Foc!
Mai sus cu 200!
- Centrul catre Baza.|- Spune.
Incepeti cu Smersh Planul B.
Sir James Bond s-a intors, cu moralitatea lui,|juramintele lui, si cu imaginea de celibatar.
Trebuie sa distrugem aceasta imagine.
Riverbank catre Baza.
- Spune.|- Tinta tocmai a intrat in Scotia.
- Castelul lui M catre baza.|- Numele lui M este McTarry. Foloseste-l.
Planul B in functiune.
Castelul lui McTarry complet ocupat  ,|cu o singura modificare.
Agent Mimi este acum vaduva lui M.
Agentul Mimi a impresionat-o pe Lady Fiona?
Ea a fost cel mai bun agent Scotian.
Si asta este tot ce a mai ramas din McTarry.
Sotul dumneavoastra a murit asa cum a trait,|Lady Fiona.In serviciul Majestatii Sale.
M-am gandit ca ar fi|dureroasa mea datorie d-de-a aduce vestile.
Cum ati stiut ca sotul dumneavostra M -|imi pare rau, McTarry - a murit?
- Ni s-a spus.|-Va pot intreba cine v-a spus?
- Grey Piper.|- Cine?
Spune-i lui Sir James despre Grey Piper, lass.
Ori de cate ori un McTarry moare,
el coboara din munti,|over the loch and through the heather,
intonand bocetul clanului.
Noi punem intotdeauna un "tappit-hen" de|"usquebaugh" in fata usilor castelului.
- "Tappit-hen"?|- Un sfert de whisky.
- Este intr-adevar un cimpoier?|- Nu stim.
Dar este acelasi de 600 de ani.
- Nu a mai ramas nimic??|- Ma tem ca nimic despre care sa putem vorbi.
A fost gasita intr-un copac,|100 de metri de unde stateam.
Scoasa, asa cum era,si a zburat ca o p-pasare.
But whether it is an article of apparel
or an anatomical f-feature,|that is the question.
Ar trebui sa-l inmormantam Crestineste?|Just how p-personal is a toupee?
Poate fi privita doar ca o "peruca".
Eliza,pune-o langa celelalte relicve ale gloriei lui McTarry .
We all ken that|our beloved McTarry of the Glen
was a different man in Whitehall.
Dar femeile McTarry nu pun niciodata intrebari.
In conformitate cu traditiile clanului,|cand lordul moare
un tap negru trebuie luat viu|din Ben Tarry de cartre 6 virgine desculte.
Eu insami il sacrific.
Ficele smulg stomacul,|si-l umplu cu maruntaie.
Minunate maruntaie.
Il parjolesc, il fierb, si apoi il servesc.
Si il mananca?
- Duhoare fierbinte.|- Suna d-delicios.
Incepem festinul la miezul noptii,|washin' the haggis down wi' usquebaugh.
One gies strength to the limbs,|the other fire to the blood for dancin'.
- Danseaza?|- The McTarry funeral fling.
"Argar, argar garar goru argar" it goes.
-Foarte m-miscator.|- Ah,dansam pana ne prabusim.
Dupa o pauza de o ora,|cimpoierul ne trezeste
cu melodia din "Away to the Grouse"
si noi plecam|la o memorabila vanatoare de cocosi de munte.
D-Dar nu este sezon de vanatoare|pentru cocosii de munte?
Ori de cate ori moare un McTarry,|se face sezon pentru cocosii de munte.
Eu sunt Heather.
Eu sunt Meg. Baia dumneavoastra e pregatita, Sir James.
- Multumesc.|- La capatul culoarului.
- Sunteti foarte amabile.|- Lasa-ne sa te ajutam.
- Nu,multumesc. M-ma descurc...|- Intotdeauna il ajutam pe Tati.
Cate sunteti aici?|F-fiice,vreau sa spun .
- 11 cu totul.|- 11? O-oh Doamne.
Si ce varste aveti?
Cine este cea mai... Cati ani are cea mai tanara?
- 16.|- Si cea mai in varsta?
19.
Asta inseamna ca sunt doar...?|Ai grija cu rotula mea.
Sunt numai 3 ani|intre voi 11?
Unele dintre noi suntem adoptate.
Inteleg. Usurel.
- In casa asta sunt b-barbati?|- Nimeni in afara de cimpoieri.
Tatalui meu ii plac numai fetitele.
T-Tatal tau a fost|un om d-diferit in Whitehall.
Verific temperatura apei
cum faceam intotdeauna pentru tatal meu.
Obisnuia sa-mi spuna micul lui termometru.
Ei bine? Intra.
- Sa intru?|- Intra!
Esti sigura ca nu te i-inghesui?
Intra.
I-ti place sa fii spalat pe spate?
Multumesc.
- Cum te c-cheama,draga mea?|- Buttercup.
-Cati ani ai?|- 17.
- Mergi la scoala?|- Taticu'ne-a invatat.
Uite. Esti neted ca un bebelus.
Acum,intoarce-te.
In ce clasa esti?
Can ye nae judge that|for yourself, Sir James? 
- Care este material ta preferata?|- Anatomia.
Asta este mediastinum.
Asta este|orbicularis oris.
Asta este Azygos vein.
Asta este articular cartilage,|si astia sunt synovial membranes.
- Corect,corect.|- Se face foarte frig!
- Quite.|- My daddy liked it hotter. 
I am not your d-da... Quite.
Multumesc.
- La latifundie!|- La latifundie!
In dreapta ta, Sir James - Lady Mary,|fiica Lordului Douglas McTarry,
violata de Campbells in 1622.
In legatura cu asta,
Lordul Douglas l-a trimis pe unicul sau fiu Hamish|s-o violeze pe Lady Campbell lassies.
- In acelasi t-timp?|- Cei mai in varsta primii,desigur.
Cum a prezis scriptura.|Primul ia daruit tripleti.
Casatoria lor a inceput|cu o binecuvantare generoasa,
a contract of marriage was entered into
which brought the McTarrys Black Loch,|Ben Torn, the Shags of Raugh,
Glen Noch,|and a good stretch of salmon water.
Toate cele bune.
Am intrebat, ea face...?
Noapte buna, doamnelor.
Nu am avut somn|gandindu-ma la iubita mea.
Toata noaptea am umblat,tarandu-ma ___________All the long night I walk, grovellin' in grief.
Consoleaza-ma, Jamie lad.
Da-mi umarul tau prietenesc ca sa pot plange.
- Dublu, Jamie.|- Zau, doamna!
Prin prezenta declar vaduvia mea|in acord cu traditia McTarry.
lasa-ma sa-ti fiu mangaiere.
Dublu!
A quaint custom, but one more honoured|in the breach than in the observance.
Atunci va trebui sa platesti flautistul!
Flautistul?
M-ai auzit,|you mean-mou'd, ill-willie cuif!
You'll have to pay the piper!
Robin! Jock!
Sandy!
Ai fost provocat la_____ to warsle|cu Sir James.
He wants to warsle.
I haven't warsled for years.|I may be a little out of p-practice.
Play ball!
Ha!|Superbe!
Formidabil!
Splendid! Bravo!
Magnific. Dar...
E surprinzator cat de repede se intorc toate.
Ah, bine. Un mic somn de frumusete|inainte de vanatoare,poate?
Beaters, urmareste-o pe Marie peste ______ the butts.
Eliza, stacu mine|pentru numaratoare.
Oh, iubirea mea este ca un trandafir, rosu
that's newly sprung in June.
- Foc, Mission.|- Roger.
- Fuse alarm missiles.|- Roger.
- Supercharge.|- Roger.
Foc.
Butonul!
Butonul!
Butonul!
- Oh, draga!|- Ce bine ca mi te-ai alaturat.
- Butonul! Butonul!|- Este cu el.
Magnetic! Homing device!
- Care buton este? Lasa-ma sa ma uit!|- Este un cutit in buzunarul meu.
- Vezi!|- Da-mi drumul la maini._____Take off my braces.
Mainile.
Si acum, doamna, daca esti|draguta sa-mi dai cateva raspunsuri.
Ordinele noastre au fost sa te corupem,|_____to befoul your image of yourself.
Failing that, we were to kill you.
- Am vazut.|- Uite! Au gasit butonul.
- Cine ti-a dat aceste ordine?|- Authority.
International Mothers' Help, East Berlin.
Jolly good sport, what?
Esti ranit.
'Tis but a thimbleful.
But heart's blood.
Cu bine, Jamie.
Draga mea.
Din nou. Spune din nou.
James Bond, my jo James.
James Bond, my jo.
Draga mea.
Inca o cerere.
Ultima.
Gandeste-te la mine|ca la a doua femeie din viata ta.
Cea dupa Mata Hari.
Saruta-ma, Jamie.
Saruta-ma de la revedere.
Madam! Esti sigura ca esti pe moarte?
Nu pe moarte, dar renuntand la viata mea.
Ma duc in alta lume.
Este un _____convent dupa acel deal.
Bond parasind Scotia acum.|Am inteles instructiunile.
Jag catre Dairy. Legatura efectuata.
- Pregateste-te sa livrezi laptele.|- Dairy catre Jag. Am inteles.
- Pregateste-te, Remote Control.|- Remote control gata.
Viteza gata. Distanta gata.
- Incepeti ____milk float.|- Contact.
- Distanta 75 yarzi.|- Accelereaza.
- Prima bomba.|- Verificat.
- Gap has widened.|- 30 yarzi.
- Retract detonators.|- Check.
- Tine-le. Este prea aproape.|- Viteza in scadere.
Ignora Jag. Mareste viteza.
- Distanta_____ gauge failing.|- Vizibilitate in scadere. Fara vizibilitate.
Schimb pe control automat.|Buna, Jag. Ma receptionezi?
Reduc viteza. Sunt in linie dreapta.
Jag catre Dairy. Redu viteza acum!
Buna, Jag. Vino aici, Jag.
- Detonators out.|- Out.
Doamne! Moneypenny.|Nu te-ai schimbat decloc.
De fapt,|sunt fata doamnei Moneypenny.
- Ce face draga ta mama?|- Dupoa ce ai plecat, ____ she took the vows.
That seems to be|the in thing to do these days.
Trebuie sa spun, acest loc|imi rascoleste amintiri.
Da,mama mi-a spus cateva dintre ele.
She probably also told you that I'm partial|to jasmine tea. Lapsang Souchong.
Apropo, de cand am venit aici|ai observat ca ma balbai?
- Nu, sir.|- Anunta-ma cand observi.
Nu am timp acum pentru asa ceva.
- Vei avea nevoie de mine la noapte, sir?|- Aproape sigur.
Daca voi prelua acest departamen,|trebuie sa stiu toate secretele lui M.
Nu cele personale, desigur.
- Va urez bine ati revenit, Sir James.|- Multumesc...
- Hadley, sir.|- Bineinteles. Esti...
- Fiul tatalui meu, sir.|- Si unde este tatal tau acum?
- In acelasi loc, sir.|- Asta e incurajator.
Punema-la curent.|Cine in ce misune e?
- Nu e o imagine prea frumoasa.|- De ce e asa de sumbru?
Mi se pare ca au fost lichidati.
Finlanda - injunghiat pana a murit|intr-o sauna pentru femei, sir.
Madrid - ars intr-un bordel, sir.
Si Tokyo, sir -|strangulat intr-o casa de geishe.
Este dezolant ca "agent secret"|a devenit sinonim cu "maniac sexual".
- Apropo, unde este omologul meu?|- A trebuit sa ne descotorosim de el, sir.
Acum face televiziune.
De ce sunt doua steaguri|in Caraibe?
Nu am mai fost in contact pentru o luna,|sir. Nu am fost siguri care a plecat.
- Cine e acolo?|- Nepotul dvs., sir. Jimmy Bond.
Mai mult o dezamagire,|din pacate, micul Jimmy.
Asculta. Nu poti sa ma impusti.
I have a very low threshold of death.
Doctorul meu spune ca nu pot|fi impuscat niciodata.
What if I said I was pregnant?
Pot sa fumez o ultima tigara?|Ma voi lasa in orice zi de acum incolo.
Multumesc.
¡Listos!
Iti dai seama ca asta inseamna|o scrisoare cu repros catre The Times.
¡Apunten!
¡Fuego!
La revedere, fraierilor!
¡Apunten! ¡Fuego!
And so I think|we'd better count him out, sir.
Yes. Hadley, we're up against|an opposition of fiendish ingenuity.
- They make incredible use of women.|- Yes, they tend to nowadays.
Female spies harassed me in Scotland,|female spies chased me to London.
We need an AFSD -|Anti-Female-Spy Device.
We find the one man all women want,|then we train him not to want women.
Toti agentii nostri wantable |au disparut, sir.
Asta e momentul in care intervii tu.|Verifica toate documentele auxiliare.
Toate, sir? O sa dureze toate noaptea.
Mama ta lucra cel mai bine noaptea.
Sa continuam?
- Si care este numele tau?|- Cooper, Big Eyes. Dar spune-mi Coop.
- Ca un cotet de pasari.|- Asta's eu.
- Trebuie sa notez calificarea ta.|- Inaltime 6ft 1/2, 184lb.
Trofee la karate si judo,|detinator al centurii negre Kamasutra.
- Impresionant. Cum traduci asta?|- O sa-ti arat.
I have to check 15 more auxiliaries|in alphabetical...
Call Mr Zacharias and tell him not to|wait up. The vacancy's just been filled.
A first-class performance, Cooper.|Excellent.
- Your primary statistics fit the bill.|- We aim to please, sir.
You will start|your AFSD training immediately.
Moneypenny, get a few dozen girls|for Cooper to start with.
- Moneypenny?|- A few dozen girls...
I appreciate your confidence, sir.
All agents and trainees will now be known|as James Bond 007, including the girls.
Won't that be confusing, sir?
The enemy won't know which way|to turn. You are now James Bond.
Congratulations, 007.
And you, 007... sir.
Good hunting, 007.
Doesn't that do something to you, 007?
It does but I'm being trained to ignore it.|Beauty's only skin-deep.
How about some skin diving?
Not today, Lorelei.
Right. Ting-Ling.
You know that every fifth child|born in the world is Chinese?
- They'll have to keep it up without me.|- Why are you so inscrutable?
- That's meant to be our racket.|- You might be a double agent.
- What would you do if I was?|- Whether you are or not, sayonara.
Next. Shirley.
- You're not Shirley.|- No.
I'm the new secret weapon.
- I've just been perfected.|- Yes, haven't you?
- They've kept me under wraps.|- Lucky them.
What do you do that's so secret?
I don't do anything.|But unless you're one of them, you do.
You're really learning|to put up quite a resistance.
- It goes against my nature.|- I sense that too.
- What are you doing after the exercise?|- Getting my head examined.
Our man in Delhi tells us gold will|be up two points by midday tomorrow.
Buy gold.
- It'll cost you three nuclear warheads.|- Offer two.
Your offer for Rockefeller Center|is accepted.
I've changed my mind. I like London.|What about Lord Nelson's statue?
It was delivered today, Miss Lynd.
My dear Miss Lynd.
- Who are you, sir?|- I am Sir James Bond.
But I thought you were retired, Sir James.
The whole world believes|you were eaten by a shark.
That was no shark,|that was my personal submarine.
But enough of this polite conversation.
- What is the purpose of your visit?|- I desperately need your help.
My dear Sir James, I hardly ever|undertake assignments these days.
I can see why, but I think I can|persuade you to undertake this one.
Your reputation is remarkable.
But believe me when I say|I save all my energies for business.
I have here a writ|for just over £5 million tax arrears.
If you were to be cooperative,
I could arrange easy payments|and a substantial discount?
Perhaps we should discuss|this matter in comfort, Sir James.
Thank you. What a charming outfit that is.
Do you often wear that in the office?
If I wore it in the street,|people might stare.
You said, Sir James, you needed my help.
I did, didn't l? I have a dossier on a man|who works at the Buckingham Club.
His name is Evelyn Tremble.
Mr Evelyn Tremble?
- Yes, that's right.|- Isn't Evelyn a girl's name?
No, it's mine actually.
- Do you know me from somewhere?|- Your book: Tremble On Baccarat.
I've studied it very closely.
At night, in my bed.
Is that where you study it?
There are several passes|you describe in your book
which I don't fully understand.
Which passes are these?
They're all marked. I would|have to have my book. Your book.
And my book is in...
My bed.
You're winning tonight.
I'll send my car for you.
- Yes?|- Hello. It's me, Evelyn Tremble.
Hello, Mr Tremble.|Can you hold on for a moment?
Eric? Don't forget to empty|the deepfreeze first thing in the morning.
Hello, Mr Tremble.|I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,
but I was just seeing someone off.
Come right up, all right? Bye-bye.
- So nice of you to come.|- My pleasure.
This way.
The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't disguise
The look oflove
It's saying so much more|than just words could ever say
And what my heart has heard
Well, it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got the look of love
It's on your face
The look that time can't erase
Hello.
Hello.
That's Lord Nelson, isn't it?
- Yes. Isn't he beautiful?|- Yes.
- And do you know what he said?|- What?
England expects every man|to do his duty.
So he did, yes. But this is Mayfair.|Lord Nelson's in Trafalgar Square surely.
No, not any more. He's mine.|Haven't you read the papers today?
- I don't normally get them quite so early.|- I get 'em before they're printed.
I suppose you can do anything|if you have money.
Why don't you come down to me?
Thank you very much.
Lovely place you've got down there.
Sit here.
I do so like to feel comfortable|whatever I'm doing.
Yes indeed. Yes.|The more relaxed the muscles,
the better the synchronisation|between mind and body.
I should think you're frightfully|synchronised, Mr Tremble.
- Martini?|- What about them?
I was just about to offer you one.
The things I didn't understand|too well in your book. Let me see...
Was it in chapter seven or chapter six?
Chapter six probably.
Though of course|it could have been chapter seven.
Have you got the book|or is it still in your bed?
I believe it is.
Well, we'd better go|right through the book, hadn't we?
Do you get many complaints|from the neighbours?
Do you really think that your system|is completely faultless?
- Which system?|- Your system for winning at baccarat.
Yes, yes.|The Evelyn Tremble system is faultless.
Good. Come on. We have more to do.
More?
I like a man who is able|to retain his own personality,
no matter what the circumstances.
Yes.
No matter how he's dressed.
They say it's the clothes|that make the man.
If we're gonna work together, I have|to know what kind of a man you are.
I thought you might have|gathered a little from...
I want to see what happens when|you put on a different hat, a costume.
You know, that sort of thing.
- You like that sort of thing, eh?|- You'll find clothes in there. Put them on.
Well, if you think it's really necessary.
Unless you'd like to|go around one more time.
One more time?
There is nothing wrong with the British|Army that a damn good swim won't cure.
Now, Evelyn Tremble.
38 years old, born in Highgate.
Hello, sailor.
The wrong one, yes?
Perfect.
Distinguishing birthmark,|little scar on right shoulder,
strawberry-shaped birthmark on left thigh.
Well, there's nothing unusual in that.
No. I myself have|an apricot one on my hip.
Well, I'll show you my strawberry|if you'll show me your apricot.
Author of a book on baccarat.
Have you ever heard of|a man called Le Chiffre?
Yes. An excellent card player.|He once wrote me a fan letter.
Keep your hands there. Perfect. Lovely.
I devoted a chapter to him in my book.|His forte is baccarat.
Beside baccarat, he deals in lechery.
Well, nobody's perfect.
Do you think you can|win against Le Chiffre?
Well, you'll remember that to operate|my system completely free of risk
a stake of £100,000 is required.
Yes, I remember.
Stand still.
I'm gonna give you a 500th at f2.
That's the nicest thing|that anyone's ever said to me.
What would you say if I offered|to stake you in a game against Le Chiffre?
What?
I put up the money, you play the game|and we split 50-50.
- I think I'll go now if you don't mind.|- What's wrong?
I enjoyed the earlier part|of this evening very much.
I shall always remember|the pleasure of your company.
I didn't even mind this dressing-up bit.
But I do mind bloody unnecessary jokes|about the one thing I really know well.
Evelyn, I'm serious. It's because you|know about baccarat that I'm not joking.
You said you needed £100,000?
- It's yours.|- That's fantastic.
But look here. Old Le Chiffre|would never agree to play me.
He's read my book.|He'd recognise my name.
- No, no. Not any more.|- Why?
We have chosen a new name for you.
James Bond.
Welcome to|the James Bond 007 training school.
It's a small Minnox camera, isn't it?|A friend of mine's got one of those.
- It's Mr Bond, isn't it?|- Yes.
If you'd be good enough to sign here, sir.
It's not for me.|It's for the Official Secrets Act.
Of course.
Eyes right!
Eyes front!
- Carry on, Sergeant Major.|- Yes, sir. Mark time!
Halt! About turn.
You really do stock|everything at Harrod's.
Don't pay too much attention.|It's all basic stuff.
It'll be out of date by the January sales.
- Good morning, Johnson.|- Sir!
May I tell you something?
- I'm being followed.|- I know. It's part of the training.
Shadowing people without being seen.
The whole point is I can quite clearly|see the man who is shadowing me.
Oh! Him. Don't worry about him.|He's not one of our trainees.
- He's our security man.|- I see.
Good morning, lnspector.|Don't let me interrupt you.
On the command,|the head is turned thus,
the hat is aimed thus,|the gun is fired thus.
Yes, we're still working on that one.
Now to Agents' Outfitting. Here we are.
- Morning, Q.|- Good morning, Fordyce. New man.
If I could bother you|for the signature, sir.
I shouldn't use that pen.|The moment the nib touches the paper,
it releases a stream of poisonous gas|into the writer's eye.
Good heavens!|What will they think of next?
I won't be going near that.
I suppose it's useful|if you want to send anyone a...
Poison-pen letter.
All our new men say that. I reply "I don't|wish to know that. Kindly leave Ml5."
Yes, sir. We have a very highly developed|sense of humour down here.
It isn't the only thing that's|highly developed down here. Fordyce!
- Wristwatch.|- Sir.
1965 Rolex Oyster Perpetual.
Date indicator and log table|round the outer band.
And a thing that shows you|what shape the moon is.
- Now, this is very important. Try it on.|- Let me help you.
It's your means of reporting to us|and our means of contacting you.
Channel six, Fordyce.
Don't worry too much about him, sir.|Channel six it is, sir.
I don't think I know|which one is which myself now, sir.
Look at your watch|and tell me what you see.
It's five and 20 minutes past 11 .|It's the 14th of March and...
I said channel six, Fordyce.
Well, nobody's perfect.
But it's absolutely amazing!|I've never seen anything like this.
It's a two-way television|and radio wristwatch.
It's an American idea. They got it|from one of their comic strips.
- Good heavens.|- Ah! Tea.
Three lumps.
It's an incredible thing, this.
Which side do you dress, sir?
- I usually dress away from the window.|- It's just some protective clothing, sir.
Let me help you|out of your hampering things.
And it is of course Sanforized, sir,
non-iron, and also available|in chocolate, oyster or clerical grey.
- It's hand-reefed and double-charvered.|- Is it?
- It's a little tight around the...|- Poison capsule compartment?
I'm sure we can let it out above|the switchblade and Geiger counter.
Do what you can, Fordyce.|Your intercom button's in here
with midget transmitters|for short-range contacts.
There's an infrared camera, a tape|recorder in the shoulder padding,
a Beretta in the buttonhole,|and a cute little minigun in the gusset.
Yes. Just one thing.
What happens|if I suddenly need to go somewhere?
In this, sir? You'll find safety|instructions under the left lapel.
Don't worry.|You're in very good hands here.
Now this won't hurt a bit, sir.
- Who g-gave you these orders?|- International Mothers' Help, East Berlin.
There it is, Hadley. Our only clue.|The voice of a beautiful woman.
We've checked it out, sir.|It's a Smersh cover operation, sir.
It supplies baby-sitters and au pair girls|to some of the most important families.
Then it must be infiltrated|by someone absolutely reliable.
- I hope you weren't thinking of me.|- I was thinking of Mata.
- You can't mean Mata Hari, sir.|- No, her daughter Mata Bond.
- Mata Bond, sir?|- Her mother gave her that name
because I happen to be|the child's sort of godfather.
And to think that you knew Mata Hari!|She really was one of the greats.
Yes. Great little dancer, terrible spy.
Whereas young Mata is a terrible dancer.|Might be a great little spy.
It's uncanny. Quite uncanny.|What memories it brings back.
Paris, Berlin, Vienna.|How madly we danced through the night.
- I was disguised as a Hungarian hussar...|- What are you going on about?
You're the very image of your mother|and every bit as beautiful.
You knew my mum?
I am Sir James Bond.
- Daddy!|- My child.
- Snail's egg?|- No, thanks. They don't agree with me.
Well, you're a charmer, aren't you?
You dump me in an orphanage when I'm|three, and now, because you need me...
It really was very difficult.|My career was at its height...
It was a traumatic experience,|I can tell you,
being the illegitimate daughter|of Mata Hari and James Bond.
Still, you do get my monthly paychecks?
Your monthly paychecks|went on analysts' fees.
That's why I came here.|I had to get away from it all.
I had no idea. Well, I must say,|you seem to be very comfortable here.
It's crazy. You want a drag?
No, thank you. I'm trying to give that up.|Who are all these people?
They're the high priests of the temple.|OK, Fred. Hop it.
Extraordinary performance.|They seem to treat you like a goddess.
Well, I am the Celestial Virgin|of the Sacred Altar.
- Figuratively speaking, of course.|- Of course. Some tea.
A cup of tea. Splendid.
It's made from poppy seeds. Two cups of|this and you're stoned out of your mind.
Thank you.
You know, if you weren't my dad,|I think I could fancy you.
Well, that's very good of you, my dear.
- Rather warm in here, don't you think?|- Cool it, Charlie.
So you want me to go to Berlin, huh?
Now, Mata. You remember|the old house on the Feldmannstrasse?
- Where Mum had her dancing school.|- It's become lnternational Mothers' Help.
But that's just a cover|for its real function. It is...
- Does he speak English?|- Hey, Charlie. Speak English?
- No.|- Good.
It is a training centre for what|are commonly referred to as spies.
You are eminently suited|to infiltrate the organisation.
Two weeks' briefing in London|and you're off to Berlin.
You want me to be a spy like Mum, huh?
- Well!|- Family tradition, my dear.
Do I get an exploding briefcase|and a secret transmitter?
- That won't be necessary.|- I have to have some equipment.
Your mother wiped out three divisions|of infantry and five of cavalry and...
Well, frankly, she had|much less equipment than you have.
If you have any problems,|contact London immediately.
- Are there any questions?|- Well, I have got one question.
- How do I get to Berlin?|- Oh, dear! Silly me.
Taxi!
- Where to?|- Berlin.
- East or West?|- West, of course.
Well, that's all right, then.
- Say goodbye to Dad for me.|- Yes. Have a good trip. Jolly good luck.
Get out of it, you lunatic!|What are you trying to do?
Come on! Move. Get out of it.|Get out the way! Go on.
- That'll be £482 15s 9d.|- You'll have to wait.
I've been caught like that before.|I haven't had my dinner yet.
- I don't have any change.|- Here we go.
What about my dinner then, eh?
What a liberty. Any fish and chip shops|round here, mush?
Who are you? What do you want?
I'm here to enrol as a student.
What are your qualifications?
- I am the daughter of Mata Hari.|- Mata Hari!
- You are a liar.|- Am l?
Well, what about this, then?
My little Mata Hari!
- I told you she'd come back!|- Silence! Or I will switch you off.
Not that! Anything but that.
You're even more|fascinating than your mother.
You must be Frau Hoffner,|Mum's teacher.
- I had that honour.|- You must be Polo.
She remembers me, her little Polo.|She remembers me.
- Welcome home.|- Welcome indeed.
Shtum!
The Mata Hari School of Dancing is the|only international school of espionage.
There is no political prejudice here.
We train Russian spies for America|und American spies for Russia.
- Very democratic.|- Very democratic.
Some of the greatest spies in the world|have graduated from this institution.
- Von Grudendorf, Malenvosky...|- Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi.
Here we have|the decoding and cipher class.
We are even training animals|as espionage agents.
We have in the Kremlin|a Russian-speaking parrot
in constant radio communication|with the Pentagon.
Und here is our class|in karate und self-defence.
Excuse me. I have|an important conference to attend.
Polo, you will show Mata to her room.
Please, follow me.
Mata? Allow me.
- Thank you.|- Follow me.
My battery needs recharging.
- Might be your head needs examining.|- No, I had that examined last week.
This is your mother's room. It has not|been opened since she left here in 1916.
You see? Nothing has been touched.
It's a wild room.
Hey, what an enormous bed.
The German army|was very large in those days.
To see you here in your mother's room|brings back such happy memories.
Here.
What's all this about|an important conference, hm?
A representative of Le Chiffre is coming.
Tonight.
Who is Le Chiffre?
Nobody knows.
Not even Le Chiffre.
What's the conference about then, hm?
Le Chiffre is trying to raise money|by selling his unique art collection.
- Why does he need money?|- He is a compulsive gambler, that's why.
Und he is using organisation funds|for his gambling!
- You mean Smersh?|- Smersh!
If he does not pay off his debts,|he will be liquidated.
Liquidated? Who by?
- By them.|- You mean...?
You're so like your mother.|You're driving me mad.
- Well, you haven't got far to go.|- Come to me, my little Mata. Come!
About time you were|back in your box, innit?
You must forgive me.|I lose control of myself.
- I'm a mad fool. Mad.|- You want an argument?
- Remember, forget everything I tell you.|- My lips are sealed.
- Lips! Don't say such words.|- Run along, sonny.
Le Chiffre. Mm-hm.
It's the first john|I've ever gone round with.
There you are.|I have been looking for you.
- It is little Otto.|- Who is he?
One of your mother's lovers.|We often find them lying around.
- Is he dead?|- Hard to tell. He always looked like that.
Come along, child.|The auction is about to begin.
Auction?
Tonight we are selling one of|the finest art collections in Europe.
- Le Chiffre's collection.|- Who is Le Chiffre?
- The man who owns the collection.|- What collection?
- The one to be auctioned.|- Who said anything about an auction?
- You did.|- Who am l?
- Frau Hoffner.|- Never heard of her. You're insane.
- Quite insane.|- I think she's right.
Gentlemen! Please take your seats|and the auction will commence.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, I am here tonight on behalf of|Le Chiffre, of whom you will have heard,
to auction this unique collection|of art treasures.
Are there any specific|bidding instructions?
When we sit, we are bidding.|When we stand, we are not bidding.
We'll do our bidding sitting down.|When we stand up, we're not bidding.
We stand, we bid.|We no stand, we no bid.
And the British representatives?
Well, I don't know actually.|A bit of both, I suppose, really.
- Is that all right with you chaps?|- That's fine.
Very well, gentlemen.
Now then.
This is an extraordinarily|embarrassing item,
one of the classic|blackmail items of all time.
What am I bid for this priceless picture?
£14 10s.
- 300 roubles.|- 300 roubles.
- $1,000.|- $1,000.
- 2 million Chinese dollars.|- 2 million Chinese dollars?
Look at this masterpiece, gentlemen.|Surely we can do better than that.
- Here, what about my fare?|- Get out!
- Here!|- Stop it!
Whatever you do, you must not|let Le Chiffre raise the money.
Who are you?
I'm Carleton Towers of the FO.
- FO?|- The Foreign Office, dear.
Wait outside and keep the motor running.
- 200,000 American dollars!|- £100,000!
- A wagonload of vodka!|- 70 million tons of rice!
- 60 tons of caviar!|- 30 million trucks!
Hey! It's war!
Hello! Hello! Get me the Pentagon!
Hello, Fenella?
I shan't be able to get back|for dinner. A sort of war's broken out.
You should not have done this thing.
Now I will have to kill you.
What are you doing to me?
No!
Positive, negative -|I never know which is which.
Give me those films.
She's got the films!
Grab her! Get her! Get her!
Now look here.
- Taxi!|- Tally-ho!
I'm sorry, madam.
- Let me go! Taxi!|- Over here!
Come on!
- Good Lord! Captain Towers?|- How nice to see you.
This way!
No, no! Down. No.
- Where to, miss?|- London!
- Le Chiffre speaking.|- The scheme was a failure.
And also Dr Noah knows|what you've been up to.
- What now?|- I'll just have to raise the money.
- But how?|- How? By playing baccarat.
But Le Chiffre, what about me?
What's going to happen to me?
Thank you.|And welcome to France, Monsieur Bond.
We don't want our little talk|to be overheard. Get in the car.
Well, there's nothing|to talk about, is there?
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
The point is you must not|allow yourself to become involved.
Don't forget there are many people here|who loathe and despise you.
I have to warn you, Bond,|my instructions are
that you play your game|with Le Chiffre and leave immediately.
No one can be such a perverse idiot|as to assault a customs official.
- It may just be natural talent, sir.|- I have to warn Vesper.
- You mean James Bond 007, sir.|- Yes, yes, yes.
Vesper? James Bond 007?
- Vesper, are you there?|- Hello, Sir James. Yes, I'm here.
I can't see you. Your picture's gone.
No, it hasn't. I was|just getting into the bath.
Vesper, do you think|Tremble could be a double agent?
He has enough trouble being|a single agent. Leave him to me.
Right. Over and out.
Mr Bond?
Missed, Mr Bond.
Yes.
I am Miss Goodthighs.
I can see that.
You've got your cork still in your bottle.
So I have. What are you|going to do about it?
Stick your arm out.
The management of the Hotel Tropical|send their compliments
and hope you will enjoy your stay with us.
I see.
Very sexy pants you're wearing, James.
Yes, they're the new double-O-fronts.
Tell me, Miss Goodthighs,
how much did you tip the porter|to let you in here?
- I just showed him a little kindness.|- How much?
Not too much. He's 83.
It's a good year.
So...
What can I do for you?
The question should be|what can I do for you?
- Have you got any suggestions?|- This, for one.
Tell me about yourself, James.
Well, I've had some|pretty wild times in my life.
Could you move over a bit?|You're lying on my loose change.
James, I need you.
Yes, yes, yes.|Well, I can understand that, my dear.
- I want to know you better.|- You're absolutely right.
My goodness, this is strong shampoo.
This really is.
I think I'd better|freshen up a bit quick.
I'll be back in five minutes.|If I'm not, start without me.
James Bond playing at Casino Royale
He won a lot of money|and a gal at Casino Royale
Oh, he's not really|such a wonderful spy
But winning lots of money|and a gal, he's a fabulous guy
Evelyn! Evelyn!
Evelyn! Evelyn!
Evelyn! Evelyn!
Evelyn, wake up!|Evelyn, what's the matter?
- Wake up! You were drugged.|- What?
- You were drugged.|- Yes, I know I was drugged.
I put the antidote pill in. And then...
Hey, I thought those antidote pills were|supposed to give me 24-hour protection.
- I've got to get Sir James Bond...|- There is no time for that.
Look at you! You're wearing your glasses|and you know you're not supposed to.
James Bond doesn't wear glasses.
Yes, but l... It's just that|I like to see who I'm shooting.
There are only a few hours left|before the game. Now, get freshened up.
Here, what about Miss Goodthighs?
Don't worry. I took care of her.|Now concentrate on the game.
Vesper, I've given this game|a lot of thought.
When I go into that casino tonight,
I'm going to sit down opposite|Le Chiffre, look him in the eye and say...
No cards.
- Neuf à la banque.|- It's amazing! He never loses.
La banque gagne. La partie est terminée.
Quiet. Absolute silence, please.
For this experiment, I require|the assistance of a young lady.
You, madam. Look me in the eyes!
And you, Georges,|keep your eyes on my chips.
I present you with the levitation|of the Princess Ayisha,
an illusion taught to me|by an ancient vegetarian
in the mountain fastnesses of Tibet.
She feels no pain.|My assistants will enshroud her
in this perfectly ordinary paisley shawl.
Now will you all|place your hands on the table?
Now let's get the show off the ground.
Keep your hand in place, madam,|and continue to ascend into thin air.
Don't take your eyes from her,|not one of you.
It is by your perfect concentration
that the young lady|remains floating in thin air.
Excuse me, madam.|Sorry to keep you hanging around.
Monsieur. You wish to make a deposit?
- Yes.|- How much?
- £100,000 sterling.|- One hundred thou...
You can keep the case|with my compliments.
Thank you, monsieur.|Could we have the name, please?
Bond. James Bond.
James B...
- James Bond?|- Yes, James Bond.
Yes. James Bond.
I wonder if you'd be kind enough|to sign my autograph book.
It's not for me, you understand.|It's my little sister.
I wonder if you'd be kind enough
to put your autograph on that receipt|for the £100,000 sterling.
But of course, Mr Bond.
It's not for me, it's for somebody else.
- Now what happens?|- We go to the casino director's office.
Point me. Just point me.
- What's the matter?|- Nothing.
Just a bit different|from the Buckingham Club, that's all.
- Bond has arrived.|- Bond is here. All staff on the alert.
Come in.
Ah! Hello. How nice to see you again.
- May I introduce...|- We have met.
Mr Slymington-Jones, Mr James Bond.
How do you do?|Do make yourself comfortable.
I see you've put a tiger in your office.
Yes. I have several actually.|That one that you so cleverly spotted,
the head on the wall over there,
and the one you're about to trip over.|Do be careful.
Yes.
The man in the white coat is Le Chiffre.
Don't be afraid. It's a one-way mirror.
- Which way?|- That way.
- No card.|- No card.
Neuf à la banque.
Mr Bond, you can watch|Le Chiffre better on here.
He's bought the bank for the evening,|and he's winning consistently.
And showing off|with his magic throughout.
- Why the dark glasses?|- Here.
So if Le Chiffre wears|the same kind of glasses,
he knows every card on the table.
- Infrared glasses.|- The cheat!
Listen, Evelyn.
You win and he will almost certainly|be killed by his organisation.
- But he'd try and avoid that, wouldn't he?|- If you win, yes.
- How?|- By trying to kill you.
- As in dead?|- Yes. But don't worry about that now.
Let's go down there|and you play the game of your life.
Yes, I better had. There may|not be too much more of it left.
- Vesper...|- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
- Well, then. It's all under control now.|- I hope so.
- Well, excuse me.|- Willingly.
Messieurs, faites vos jeux.
I believe you have my name|in a crevice. James Bond.
- Pardon, monsieur?|- Bond. James Bond.
Oh, yes, Mr Bond.
Bond? James Bond?|The name is familiar.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
- I'm flattered you've heard of me.|- I have heard of you,
but not as an expert on baccarat.
Well, I'm sorry you weren't told.
Don't think that went unnoticed, Mr Bond.
I see everything that goes on at this table.
- Nothing escapes me.|- I'm quite sure it doesn't.
But we mustn't forget that
the beggar who is in the marketplace
is completely deaf|insomuch as far as listening
to the song that is coming|from the mockingbird is concerned.
I'm sorry, Mr Bond,|I don't get the connection.
You will.
Sim salabim.
When you're quite ready.
Now I require a perfectly ordinary|gentleman's pocket handkerchief.
From the pocket|of one perfectly ordinary gentleman.
That's the kind of remark|that leads to war.
How much better for all humanity
if all the nations could learn|to live together in peace.
Marvellous!
More!
That's finished, is it?|Fantastic. Wonderful. Incredible.
Incredible, isn't it? Absolutely marvellous.|I've never seen anything like it.
And now if you're ready, Monsieur|Le Chiffre, I would like to play baccarat.
- I use the Evelyn Tremble method.|- You read Tremble.
I thought he'd only published|a few paperback editions.
Well, I have an autographed first edition.
It's a bit dog-eared now, mind you,|but it nevertheless has a certain...
Uninformed quality?
Six à la ponte et neuf à la banque.|La banque gagne.
Aren't you a little|out of your depth, Mr Bond?
In the last 20 minutes I have ruined|two Greeks and a maharajah.
You know, Mr Bond,|we aren't playing for marbles.
The night is young and the rose garden|is already littered with my victims.
Yes, but the beggar in marketplace|are deaf to song of nightingale.
- You amuse me, Mr Bond.|- I'm glad you're enjoying me.
Shall we double the bank?
If it'll improve your game.
Pas de cartes.|No card.
- Sept à la banque.|- He never loses!
Cinq à la ponte. La banque gagne.
What about one for the road?
It looks as though luck isn't|on your side of the road, old man.
She has a habit of moving around.
Then we might as well|double the bank again.
Suppose I were to treble it?
Treble it? You haven't any chips!
I think my credit's good.
Bond credit good.
The bank now stands at 50 million francs.
Very well.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.|It's been nice knowing you.
Pas de cartes.|No card.
- Baccarat.|- He lost!
La ponte gagne.
Goodbye, Monsieur Le Chiffre.|It was nice knowing you.
Let's not say goodbye, Mr Bond.|Let's just say au revoir.
- Lovely!|- Credit my account, would you?
La partie est terminée.
- A remarkable performance, Mr Bond.|- Thank you. Trifle unusual but...
- How would you like the money?|- A cheque in a Swiss bank.
- Would you like the cheque now?|- Yes, now, yes.
I'll tell the cashier.|You can pick it up as you go out.
- Excuse me.|- Willingly.
Mr Bond, what are your movements|for the rest of the evening?
We thought we'd have a bite to eat|and then back to the hotel.
And you're leaving Royale|first thing in the morning.
Are we?
The inspector isn't asking us.|He's telling us.
A police car will escort you|from the hotel to the airport.
- Mr Mathis.|- Yes?
Something's been worrying me.
You're a French police officer|and yet you have a Scots accent.
Aye. It worries me, too.
Haven't by any chance seen|a young lady in a green dress?
Would that be a lady|with a black bag over her head
being manhandled|by two unsavoury gentlemens?
- Could very well be.|- She went that way, sir.
In a car. A very fast car!
- Moss?|- Yes, sir.
- Follow that car!|- Yes, sir.
I'll use Fangio next time. Idiot!
Grand Prix enthusiasts may be worried
by the time it's taken me|to get into this Lotus Formula Three.
They don't realise that although Le Chiffre|thinks he has a faster car than me,
I am faster in my Lotus Formula Three!
Wake up, Mr Bond. Wake up.
Well, now, Mr Bond. You've had|your little victory at the baccarat table.
Now it's my turn. I'm going to|have to have that cheque, Mr Bond.
Smersh is going to be very unhappy.
- You mean you're going to torture me?|- Persuade you, Mr Bond. Persuade you.
Don't worry about that chair with the hole.|It's merely waiting to be reupholstered.
- By me.|- You have an inventive mind, Mr Bond.
But my methods are much more subtle.|They have to be.
- What are you going to do?|- Physically, I'm not going to do anything.
Oh, you're going to nothing me to death.
Torture of the mind. The most|exquisite torture is all in the mind.
I'm going to have to|have that cheque, Mr Bond.
Suppose Mr Bond isn't ready|to give it to you?
You are a tiresome little man.|Let's try another approach.
It's a beauty contest, Mr Bond.
You're supposed to pick the winner.
- Excuse me. Are you Richard Burton?|- No, I'm Peter O'Toole.
Then you're the finest man|that ever breathed.
- God bless you, sir.|- Thank you.
You've changed my plans, Miss Lynd.
But neither you nor Bond will leave here|till I get that cheque!
Mr Tremble?
Never trust a rich spy.
Le Chiffre, you're a fool. Smersh|believed you could win at baccarat.
- All I need is 24 hours!|- It's too late.
Oh, Daddy, I do so long to meet him.|All the girls do. He really turns me on.
- Did that finishing school teach you that?|- No, I taught them.
Now run along and watch|the Changing of the Guard.
- I bet Mummy would have taken me in.|- Mummy took everyone in.
Put me down! Put me down!!
- What is it, a film?|- It must be a commercial.
No time for window-gazing, Moneypenny.|Mata's been kidnapped.
- But...|- That's an unidentified flying object.
And our fastest jets|trying to track it down. Control?
- That's the canteen.|- Control!
Contact all operatives.|We must find out where it lands.
- Air Ministry. They've lost it.|- Lost it? You were right on its tail.
Well, you must have|one plane fast enough... I see.
They stopped building those last week.
I wonder if you'd care to help us.
- Could you come back...|- Do please come in, Sister.
It's our annual collection for needy girls.
Your receipt?
This department has always been|very helpful to needy girls.
That's strange.|We've never had a receipt before.
"They're taking your daughter|to Casino Royale. Sister McTarry."
The Prime Minister, urgently.
Daddy'll come after me.
- That's what we're hopin'.|- You won't get away with this.
Move to the door, Mata Bond.|You are a prisoner of Smersh.
We already have most of your father's|agents here. You will complete the set.
- Looks like a Smersh convention.|- Le directeur wishes to see you.
- It is about your daughter.|- Tactic 4B if necessary.
I will tell him you are here.
Hold it! Back up.
Face the curtains!
March!
You are now entering|the Smersh headquarters of Dr Noah.
Tactic 33A.
Now!
Operation James Bond completed.
Dr Noah, I presume.|Why don't you come out and face me?
Because you are going to|come in and face me.
Sir!
Moneypenny!
This is an historic day|in our saga, Sir James.
The day Smersh finally eliminated|the original James Bond.
- His world will soon follow.|- This is all very impressive.
You might be even more impressed|to meet one of my 1,000 doubles.
Waiting for the moment when|I command them to take over the world.
It's fantastic. May I take a closer look?
It's quite perfect.
- Good Lord! It's my nephew.|- Jimmy Bond?
This explains the Caribbean assignment.|Is this some kind of a joke?
- He can't speak!|- Never could in my presence.
Psychological block he's had since|childhood, based on hero worship.
- He's Dr Noah?|- My nephew the head of Smersh?
I have been bombed, bullied and baited|out of retirement to deal with you?
- Do you suppose he's a junkie?|- Leave this to me.
Now, Jimmy, as your uncle|I really must insist...
- What is it?|- He's put a sheet of glass between us.
I never should have let Nellie|send him to progressive school.
What's that?
Dr Noah's bacillus? Now, Jimmy,|even you wouldn't release germ warfare.
Handle these capsules with care.|Dr Noah's bacillus is highly contagious.
When distributed in the atmosphere|it will make all women beautiful
and destroy all men over 4ft 6.
- Please handle these capsules with care.|- So that's your plan, huh?
A world full of beautiful women|and all men shorter than yourself.
Good evening. All this just to make up|for your feeling of sexual inferiority?
I'm beginning to think|you're a trifle neurotic.
Maybe you can explain. Why was I|abducted and subjected to this?
Because, of all Uncle James's 007s,|you're the most beautiful and desirable.
Do you treat|all the girls you desire this way?
Yes! I undress them and tie them up.|I learned that in the Boy Scouts.
Let me ask you a question.|Do I appear menacing to you at all?
- What are you laughing at?|- Nothing. I just think...
Did you see yourself in the mirror lately?|I think you should.
You are a wretched, grotesque,|ridiculous, insignificant little monster.
Are you saying to me that you find|Uncle James more attractive than I am?
Uncle James? He's a real man. Wow!
Do you realise that anything|Uncle James can do I can do better?
That will be the day.
You're crazy. You are absolutely crazy.
- They called Einstein crazy.|- No one ever called Einstein crazy.
- They would have if he behaved like this.|- People respected Einstein.
Einstein could never have conceived|of something like this.
It looks like an aspirin, it tastes|like an aspirin, but it's not an aspirin.
- It's cyanide.|- This pill contains 400 tiny time pills.
They go off in the body,|forming a chain reaction,
and turn the person|into a walking atomic bomb.
Einstein's bomb was crude.|This is brilliant.
It's crude to tie up women.
In a week it'll be|April Fools' Day, my birthday.
All world leaders will be assassinated|and my doubles will take their places.
In five days' time|I'll be ruler of the Earth.
- How would you like to be my co-ruler?|- Why not?
- Why not? You hate me.|- I don't know.
I'm beginning to wonder|if the real genius of the Bond family
is not right here in the room with me now.
- Why don't you unlock me?|- Yes, I will.
I'll unlock you immediately|and we'll run amok.
If you're too tired, we'll walk amok.
I'm so sorry for all the things I said.|I didn't really mean it.
- Here. Slip into this.|- Just a moment. Be careful.
Yes. I don't want to|damage any of your parts.
Multam.
Multumesc.
Now, turn yourself like a nice fool|while I slip this on.
Da. Da, astept aici.
Aceasta ii va arata lui Sir James odata pentru totdeauna|care din noi are un corp perfect.
The poor boob! Grabeste-te, draga.
Am planuri mari pentru noi.
It's vaporised lysergic acid.|Este foarte exploziv.
Intrati acum in|avionul personal al lui Dr Noah
Unde dragul nostru conducator|a asamblat ____a collection
of the world's|most distinguished doubles.
Avionul spatial a Dr Noah|va ureaza bine ati venit la bord.
A great likeness, isn't she?|I copied her right down to the last...
Doi dintre noi au avut cateva|experiente religioase.
Cum iti place locul asta? Am un|decorator care ma ajuta, dar lucrez cu ea.
Seful vostru|has remoulded ordinary agents
into replicas of the world's greatest|figures in culture, politics and the arts.
- Look! They're uncovered!|- These are not doubles.
These are the real people. I've already|substituted my robots for them.
La acest moment lumea este condusa|de dublurile care sunt sub controlul meu.
Ei bine, asta explica o multime de lucruri.
Your rain-cooled Taittinger, sir.
Bautura!
Si pentru tine.
Gandeste-te. O lume fara ____A world free of|poverty and pestilence and war.
O lume in care toti oamenii sunt egali.
In care un om, nu conteaza cat de scund,|poate inscrie _____can score with a top broad.
in care un om fara a tine cont de rasa,|credinta, culoare, beneficiaza de lucrari stomatologice gratuite
and a chance of subscription-buying|all the good things in life.
Dar, Noah, tu esti de acord cu toate astea?
Nu, nu. Eu nu sunt de acord.
Iubesc politica!
- Pentru viitor.|- Beau pentru asta.
Sampania mea speciala.
- With your very special pill in it.|- Despre ce vorbesti?
Arata ca o aspirinalooks like an aspirin, it tastes|like an aspirin, but it isn't an aspirin.
- And you just swallowed it.|- You're lying.
398 more of those little pills to go off.|Have a real bomb of an evening!
Alka Seltzer!
Right?
Charge!
Delightful vintage, sir.
- 297.|- Smooth to the palate.
Here. There's a fish|in my mixture. You fool!
I say! Super place for a coming-out party.
Now now, Mata.
- Through here!|- Down!
Look! Quick, before the fuse burns out.
Try not to look conspicuous.
- Dumnezeule! Este unul de-al nostru.|- Domnule!
- Trebuie sa iesim inainte sa explodeze!|- Trebuie sa gasim biroul.
- Ce birou? | - Cel in care am coborat, bineinteles.
Asta lasami-o mie.
Unde e biroul? Biroul.
Haide! Repede.
Este foarte civil din partea dvs., domnule. Multumesc.
Haide, da-mi mana.|- Ai grija!
Urmati-ma!
Charge!
Mata, pune degetul|in urechea tigrului. O sa actioneze usile.
- Bine.|- Care e strategia, domnule?
Plecati din locul asta nenorocit|inainte sa explodeze.
- Toata lumea sa stea in spatele meu.|- Nu mai risc sa trec prin casinoul acela din nou.
- Mai bine cobor pe conducta de scurgere.|- Frumos, dar fara sustinere.
Scoate fetele prin iesirea din spate.|Imi pare rau ca te-am bagat in asta.
Pe naiba, tata.|Nu puteam sa ma distrez mai tare.
Pe acolo.
Evacueaza cladirea.|Este gata sa explodeze.
As dori Londra. Whitehall 007.
Pacat ca n-o sa o mai prinzi, Sir James.
Am intampinat o gramada de necazuri|sa te aduc aici.
Draga Vesper.|Ce nu faci tu pentru bani.
De data asta e din dragoste, Sir James.
- Nu astepta...|- Inapoi in birou.
Ajutoarele americane, domnule. Au sosit.
80.
79.
Geronimo!
51.
- Ne bucuram ca am putut fi de ajutor, domnule|- Dumnezeule! Ransome, nu-i asa?
A-OK, Sir James. CIC at CIA.
Nu incepe din nou.|Nu am terminat inca ultimul lot.
- Cum spui, domnule|- A-OK, Ransome. A-OK.
- Ciao.|- Ciao.
37.
- Au sosit francezii.|- Pardon?
- Francezii sunt acolo.|- Imi pare rau, franceza mea e rudimentara.
- Francezul a ajuns.|- Splendid. Multumesc.
Uitat-te afara!
- Merde!|- Ce? Uitat-te in carte.
- Ouch.|- Pe aici.
Politia!
Am fost pacalit.
Arma asta impusca invers.|Tocmai m-am omorat.
18. Asteapta!

Patru.
Trei. Doi.
