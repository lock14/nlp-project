00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,247
She wouldn't tell me her husband's name.
She wouldn't even write it.

3
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,515
She knows not to speak
the names of the dead.

4
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,424
Zuwanie's murdered half the town.
How could it get any worse?.

5
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,690
With Zuwanie, he could murder the other half.

6
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,087
No. Just us, they said.

7
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,091
Xola's right, Philippe.

8
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,593
You've done well, my friend, but just us.

9
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,425
I'll do the talking.

10
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:28,434
(native African dialect - Ku)

11
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,367
They're Ku.

12
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,010
(boy calls in Ku)

13
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,588
(shouts)

14
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,093
It's OK. It's OK.

15
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,676
The Teacher says good day to you.

16
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,544
(gunshot)

17
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,973
(hubbub of voices in various languages)

18
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:06,396
The United Nations was born in a hope
that survived world war...

19
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,827
(speaking Spanish)

20
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,630
(continues in Spanish)

21
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,676
(translator) We must not allow the peace
of the world to be jeopardised.

22
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,870
(various languages in translation)

23
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,982
(translator) Not only is this a negation
of democracy and its principles,

24
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:32,146
it constitutes interference
in the internal affairs of sovereign states.

25
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:40,692
We are presently in the throes
of a great transition

26
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,368
in humankind's affairs.

27
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,005
Modern technology is altering our world

28
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:51,666
in ways that would have been
impossible to fathom

29
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,245
when the United Nations Charter was signed.

30
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,212
- Could you take your jacket off?.
- Go ahead.

31
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,516
- Next.
- Ma'am?.

32
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,383
What?.

33
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,718
- Put it in the drawer, please.
- Step forward, please.

34
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,020
- Step through.
- Oh, man.

35
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,424
(female translator)
Peace, security and freedom

36
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:20,902
are not finite commodities
like land, oil or gold,

37
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,237
which one state can acquire
at another's expense.

38
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,087
Get the GA President into the safe room.
Inform him.

39
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,283
Clear out the tourists,
get the Prime Minister on his way out.

40
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,962
(continues in Spanish)

41
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:49,692
While globalisation has benefited
portions of the world...

42
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,073
While there are now 1 91 nations represented,

43
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,141
1 40 more than there were in 1 945,

44
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:03,304
you'll only have to learn to say "peace"
in the six languages of the General Assembly.

45
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,508
- Do we get a pin?.
- Folks, you need to follow me.

46
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,984
Ladies and gentlemen,
we need to take a 1 5-minute recess now.

47
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,284
We will advise you further
at the end of that time.

48
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,624
We can't use the stairs.

49
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,803
- I know a short-cut.
- What, did you design the building?.

50
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,131
- I still get lost every other day.
- Silvia?.

51
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,033
I'll be right back.

52
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,510
- What is that?.
- Come on, Roland, it's my flutes.

53
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,652
I have a lesson.
Don't make me drag it around.

54
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,448
I let you do this,
I'll get coats and hats and yogi mats...

55
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,732
I had a beauty. "Pie in the sky".

56
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,774
- lsn't it like "castles in Spain"?.
- Exactly. Les chateaux en Espagne.

57
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,345
Stay away from both doors.
We'll unlock when it's all clear, sir.

58
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,285
Delegates' entrance clear.

59
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,222
Delegates' lounge clear.

60
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,100
Visitors' lobby clear.

61
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,207
Protectee is back in America.

62
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,581
Want to wait this out at Oz?.
We can grab a sandwich.

63
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:52,315
- I've got to get back in to get my stuff.
- Merde, how long is this going to take?.

64
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,892
(indistinct whispered conversation in Ku)

65
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,113
(conversation in Ku continues)

66
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,392

00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:17,461
(woman) Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out
having a good time, so leave a message.

73
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,050
Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out

75
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,744
(machine) Silvia?. Rudy thought he had
a flute lesson tonight.

76
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,380
Will you call me when you get in?.

77
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,169
- You know, they make new ones now.
- Yeah, I know.

78
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,123
(car horn)

79
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,191

00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,855
(translation)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,

84
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,495
the situation in Matobo
has now become critical.

85
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:02,531
With Ajene Xola in hiding
and Kuman-Kuman in exile,

86
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,671
Edmond Zuwanie has few domestic obstacles

87
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,397
to his policy of ethnic cleansing.

88
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:14,511
The Security Council therefore
must press for his immediate referral

89
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:19,207
to the International Criminal Court
in The Hague.

90
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,012
Miss Broome.

91
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,954
I'm Jonathan Williams, Ambassador Harris's
adviser. We need you for a few minutes.

92
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,733
- Which language?.
- The Matoban ambassador. He'll speak Ku.

93
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,495
- Ku?.
- You speak the language, don't you?.

94
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,478
- Let's be clear, Mr Ambassador.
- (Silvia translates into Ku)

95
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,743
The United States may not recognise the lCC
as a legitimate court,

96
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:59,391
but we do not condone the methods
President Zuwanie uses against his people.

97
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,157
(speaks Ku)

98
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,990
Dr Zuwanie is an educator.

99
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,134
He is...our teacher.

100
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,700
But his opponents
engage in ever more ferocious acts.

101
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:21,471
The partisans of both Kuman-Kuman
and Ajene Xola have become...

102
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,980
terrorists.

103
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,178
The French proposal
is a diplomatic headache for both of us.

104
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,625
- What a predicament.
- It doesn't have to be.

105
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,732
Dr Zuwanie wouldn't have to appear
before the lnternational Criminal Court.

106
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,903
Not if he were somewhere else.

107
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,470
- Do you want him to resign?.
- Tell him this.

108
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:56,705
If he goes voluntarily, we're confident
the French proposal will be vetoed.

109
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,512
(speaks English) You can tell him yourself.

110
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,515
He will be here next Friday,

111
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:08,523
exercising his right
to speak before the General Assembly,

112
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,527
where he will announce
a new programme of democratic reform.

113
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:17,464
Perhaps then there will be no vote
and your predicament will disappear.

114
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,770
(Silvia) It will end here.

115
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:30,011
The Teacher will never leave this room alive.

116
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,208
That's it.
"The Teacher will never leave this room alive."

117
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,682
Word for word.

118
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,052
- And what language did you say?.
- Ku.

119
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,525
It's a tribal dialect of Matoban, spoken
throughout the south central African belt.

120
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,791
- Did you see anyone?.
- No, but I think that they saw me.

121
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,129
Why didn't you report this last night?.

122
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,301
It didn't mean anything to me at the time.

123
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,368
- Rather, I didn't know what it meant.
- But now you do.

124
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,546
I heard something today.

125
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,612
I don't know if I'm permitted.

126
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,752
- It was in a closed...
- You are.

127
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:12,913
In fact, you're obligated,
as you were last night when you didn't.

128
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,261
I think they were talking
about Edmond Zuwanie.

129
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,458
He's planning to come here
to address the GA.

130
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,628
Can you see her?.

131
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,235
Turn on the light.

132
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,649
Call the Secret Service.

133
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,285
(¶ Zenvox: Bump)

134
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,226
Bet you really miss this. Welcome back.

135
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,834
Ma'am?. Excuse me.
Please don't touch the Prime Minister.

136
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:02,063
- (cell phone rings)
- I need you to step back, please.

137
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,364
Woods.

138
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,067
(raised voices)

139
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,182
The first of the demonstrators.

140
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,979
They're here to protest the appearance
later this week by Edmond Zuwanie.

141
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,055
Not just his political future
but any future for him

142
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,852
hinges on that speech
to the General Assembly.

143
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,494
Dr Zuwanie is accused of genocide,

144
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:29,065
but he's expected to argue that his actions
were a defensive response to terrorism

145
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:34,296
and not acts of aggression, as some
Security Council members have charged.

146
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,168
- Secret Service.
- Just a moment, please.

147
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,607
We're with Foreign Dignitary Protection.

148
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,107
- It's a branch of the US government.
- Dot.

149
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,980
This is international territory.
I need you to wait for an escort.

150
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,951
Zuwanie lands at 8.45 hours.

151
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,785
State Department says no meet-and-greet,
no shopping, no Lion King.

152
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:59,453
He leaves your podium,
his plane has two hours to clear US airspace,

153
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,530
unless the UN cancels the visit

154
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,726
and Tobin and I can get back
to the important work we were doing.

155
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,998
That's up to the GA President.
We just present a threat assessment.

156
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,837
- Why is he coming?.
- To make a speech.

157
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,513
To escape the lnternational Criminal Court.

158
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:20,583
Security Council was debating whether
to bring charges of ethnic cleansing,

159
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,187
so he'll come,
talk about free elections and reform

160
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,187
and pray that that appeases everyone.

161
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,384
So the stakes are high.
He's not going to cancel.

162
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,161
Tell me about the interpreter.

163
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,133
Born here, but lived mostly
in Africa and Europe.

164
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,364
She studied music in Johannesburg

165
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,533
and linguistics at the Sorbonne
and various countries in Europe.

166
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:47,905
Parents?.

167
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:52,607
British mother, white African father.
Moved here five years ago.

168
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,719
Interview couldn't have taken long.
She's just what they want.

169
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,890
- She is the UN.
- Can she cook?.

170
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,788
What else do we know?.
Since the initial clearance.

171
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,461
Is she married?.

172
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:08,394
Does she have a child?.
Does she belong to any clubs?.

173
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,898
Is she registered to vote?.

174
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,731
Democrat?. Republican?.

175
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,036
What religion is she?.

176
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,409
Who is she?.

177
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,476
Silvia.

178
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,914
(they speak Spanish)

179
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:40,328
Secret Service Dignitary Protection Squad.

180
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,933
We're responsible for visiting heads of state.

181
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:49,438
- I don't recall seeing you around.
- They hire us for our forgettable faces.

182
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,172
- Is she on guard?.
- Yes, ma'am.

183
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:01,614
Ma'am. Why is it you guys who carry guns
always sound like cowboys?.

184
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,618
I don't concentrate on faces in my job.

185
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,953
But you listen to voices.

186
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,827
Do you think you could identify the voice?.

187
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,162
Well, I'd say yes, if it were...
It was almost a whisper.

188
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:22,200
Whispers disguise the quality of a voice.

189
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,139
You, I imagine, study faces.

190
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,818
- You know, I'm not really a dignitary.
- I know.

191
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,685
How'd you happen to be up there after hours?.

192
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,195
We had an evacuation.
I'd left some things in the sound booth.

193
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,734
And there just happened to be some fellas
talking about an assassination

194
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:58,274
in a language that you and eight other people
understand, in a room full of microphones.

195
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,638
Do you think I'm making it up?.

196
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,739
Why would I report a threat I didn't hear?.

197
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,043
- People do.
- I don't.

198
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,812
- Some people like attention.
- I don't.

199
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,585
- You don't want Zuwanie here.
- I didn't make it up.

200
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:20,026
- How do you feel about him?.
- I don't care for him.

201
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,258
- Wouldn't mind if he were dead?.
- If he were gone.

202
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,163
- Same thing.
- No, it isn't.

203
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,273
If I interpreted "gone" as "dead", I'd be fired.
If they were the same, there'd be no UN.

204
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,774
- Your profession is playing with words.
- I don't play with words.

205
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,742
- You're doing it now.
- You are.

206
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:40,577
If I wanted him dead, I wouldn't have
reported it. It's not what I want.

207
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,879
- That's not why I'm here.
- Here?.

208
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,855
Working at the UN, instead of standing
on a road somewhere with a machine-gun.

209
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,584
- You believe in diplomacy?.
- I believe in this place.

210
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,961
- I believe in what it tries to accomplish.
- Well, you've had a tough year, lady.

211
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,101
Listen.

212
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:04,163
I'm scared, and my protector
is someone who doesn't believe me.

213
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,371
You don't look scared.

214
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,105
People handle fear in different ways, Mr Keller.

215
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,582
It turns some people into stand-up comedians.
You don't know me at all.

216
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:22,588
Maybe I should see about assigning someone
to look after me who's better suited to the job.

217
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,819
I don't look after you,

218
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,933
I look after the man who's been
threatened, if there was a threat.

219
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,969
My job, as it concerns you,
is to investigate you.

220
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,607
So you're not here to offer me
any protection whatsoever?.

221
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,971
No, ma'am.

222
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,545
And we were getting along so well.

223
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,917
- So what do you think?.
- She's a liar.

224
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:09,772
Agent Keller?. Morning.
Special Agent Lewis, FBl. This is Agent King.

225
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,310
We're on loan.

226
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,448
So they have to be returned
in the same condition, or no refund.

227
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,311
- Keller.
- Woods.

228
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,786
- Are you sure you're ready to come back?.
- I'm better working.

229
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,858
- We got a credible threat?.
- We should assume so.

230
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,160
As popular as we are in the rest of the world,

231
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,306
the last thing we need is to have
a foreign leader get popped here,

232
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,499
particularly a guy like this that we don't like.

233
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,577
So State wants you to know, NSA, ClA, FBl,

234
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:54,376
whatever you need to keep this maniac's
heart beating till he gets out, it's yours.

235
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,491
- (phone rings)
- Woods.

236
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:08,097
(caller indistinct)

237
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,565
(Dot) Zuwanie's head of security's arrived.
He wants a meeting right away.

238
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,705
(Tobin) He'll have to wait
till we get back from Washington.

239
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:19,070
- He's white. He was a Dutch mercenary.
- He'll still have to wait.

240
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,371
(Jon) It's hard to remember
that Zuwanie was once a good man.

241
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,708
That's not unusual for these guys.

242
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:29,410
They begin as liberators. 20 minutes later,
they're as corrupt as the tyrants they topple.

243
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,887
He liberated the country from one of
the most corrupt governments on earth,

244
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:39,894
gave the people hope, and was a hero.
They need another name for what he is now.

245
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,124
- Man likes his gun.
- He'll have it with him.

246
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,700
He knows he won't be scanned.

247
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,098
Who are his enemies?.

248
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:52,208
Aside from the thousands of victims' relatives?.
These two.

249
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,871
Both his opponents, both want his job.

250
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,140
On the right, Ajene Xola.

251
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,944
Son of a doctor, Paris-educated,
pacifist to begin with.

252
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,918
- Aren't they all?.
- He managed longer than most.

253
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,719
- And the other?.
- He has two names, he's always in the Post.

254
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,920
One name, twice. Kuman-Kuman.

255
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,261
He's been yelling about Zuwanie being
a madman and the UN not doing enough.

256
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,795
He's in exile in Brooklyn.

257
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,463
A socialist and a capitalist,
both gaining strength with the people,

258
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,269
both with the motivation to see Zuwanie gone.

259
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,212
- Gone?.
- Dead.

260
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,077
But not just dead.

261
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:37,653
Dead in front of the delegates of 1 91 countries
and every news service with a camera.

262
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,121
- In front of the world.
- Nobody needs to be that dead.

263
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:46,396
In my opinion,
we're wasting tax dollars staying late.

264
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,429
It's a con.

265
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,063
- This is the interpreter?.
- I need everything ClA has on her.

266
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,332
(phone ringing)

267
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,116
(answer machine.. male French voice)

268
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,347
(speaks French)

269
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,439
(Lud) So what do we make of this interpreter?.

270
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:40,050
Is she making it up?. Is she imagining things?.

271
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:41,775
I'm looking for Mr Lud.

272
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:45,478
- Is she pretty?.
- I brought you a copy of her UN file.

273
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,420
Dr Zuwanie won't cancel his speech,
you know.

274
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,687
That's up to the GA President,
but you might want to think about it.

275
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,526
- Ms Broome has a Matoban passport.
- Excuse me?.

276
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,466
She was born here, she was raised there,
so she has dual citizenship.

277
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,436
Are you serious?.

278
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,239
Black or white?.

279
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,344
No, thank you.

280
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,847
- Is she black or white?.
- White.

281
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:18,688
- (Lud) Did you give her a polygraph test?.
- (Tobin) Not yet, no.

282
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,154
Well, shouldn't you?.

283
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,247
(cell phone)

284
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,888
Hi, Ma.

285
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,390
Back off, you're too close. Way too close.
What are you, on a date?.

286
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:28,277
Hey, you got the Kellers. We're out
having a good time, so leave a message.

287
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,813
(female voice) Hey, you there?.

288
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,082
Maybe I made a mistake.

289
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,651
Are you there?.

290
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,888
Shit.

291
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:45,660
I told him I want to come back.
He's dropping me off at the airport now,

292
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,500
and I was wondering...
Anyway, you don 't have to meet me.

293
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,475
Unless you want to.

294
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,711
I hope you haven 't changed the locks.

295
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,583
(¶ Lyle Lovett: If I Had a Boat)

I'd sure enough be single...

297

¶ It'd just be me and Trigger
We'd go riding through them movies ¶

298
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,032
They're ready for you.

299
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,137
I'll be right there.

300
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,017
- I'll be right there.
- OK.

301
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,051
Ms Broome.

302
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,688
- Can I get you anything?.
- How about a hood?.

303
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:22,457
- I want to split that.
- When do I know the results?.

304
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:26,501
Right away.
You know when you're lying, don't you?.

305
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,344
Look straight ahead, feet flat on the floor.

306
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,245
Is your name Silvia Broome?.

307
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,713
Miss Broome?.

308
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,049
I found out something from our domestic lntel.

309
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,055
All this may have begun with a tragic accident.

310
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,525
- What do you mean?.
- Her parents farmed in the mountains.

311
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,700
This area became infested
with rebels in the '80s

312
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,529
and Dr Zuwanie was forced to mine the roads.

313
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:04,174
Her parents were bringing her younger sister
back from school and hit a mine.

314
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,037
- And they were killed?.
- All of them.

315
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,145
- How old was she?.
- 1 2, 1 3.

316
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,281
Something like that, even years later,
could incite all kinds of ideas.

317
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,896
She has every reason
to want Dr Zuwanie tried at the lCC.

318
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,002
I'll be right back.

319
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,779
- Oh, no. Come on.
- OK, the control questions show stress,

320
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,440
and the key questions show stress
as well as the baseline questions.

321
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,552
We should just read her palm.

322
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,923
- How did I do?.
- Je ne sais pas.

323
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,461
Nils Lud. Dr Zuwanie's head of security.

324
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:08,232
I thought since you were in a
question-answering mood, I might ask a few.

325
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,141
Might I ask where you stand now
politically, Miss Broome?.

326
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:19,247
I'm for peace and quiet, Mr Lud.
It's why I came to the UN. Quiet diplomacy.

327
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,578
With respect, you only interpret.

328
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,488
Countries have gone to war
after misinterpreting one another.

329
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,389
I would say she's clearly under stress,
but not necessarily lying.

330
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,958
Congratulations.

331
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:40,331
- I'm told what you heard was a whisper.
- Yes.

332
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,736
Is it possible you could identify it
if you ever heard it again?.

333
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,337
It might be.

334
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,310
Tell me, do you have a brother?.

335
00:35:55,853 --> 00:36:00,756
I hope it's all right. I took this opportunity
to ask Miss Broome a few questions.

336
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,785
You're free to go.
Agent Scott will drive you back to the UN.

337
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,796
Would you drive Ms Broome
back to the UN, please?. Thank you.

338
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:17,100
- Does this mean the test was...?.
- The test was inconclusive.

339
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,642
But I'd rather make the mistake
of believing her than the bigger one of not.

340
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:27,807
Next time you want to question an
American citizen here, you ask permission.

341
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,220
- Silvia.
- Don't worry, I'm not leaving any...

342
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:37,155
Did you do something naughty?.
A couple of FBls were asking me about you.

343
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:43,156
If you often work later than everybody,
or bring things in after hours. Like that.

344
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:49,871
- What'd you tell them?.
- I said, from a sound engineer's point of view,

345
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,234
you're perfect.

346
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,977
I need somebody on the guy with two names.

347
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,204
- Mo.
- It's one name twice. Kuman-Kuman.

348
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:59,609
You volunteering, or just correcting me?.

349
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,217
- I'm from Brooklyn.
- You got him. You and...?.

350
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:06,913
- I was on him when he first came here.
- OK, you got him again.

351
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,422
I thought she had perfect pitch.

352
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:12,255
She says whispers
don't have a recognisable pitch.

353
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,260
NSA agrees. They say it's very difficult.

354
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:17,933
- They don't know that.
- They say they do.

355
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,866
No, not NSA. Whoever she heard.

356
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,774
Why not let them keep thinking she can lD it?.

357
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:31,445
- What are you asking me to do, Jay?.
- I don't want her to be harmed.

358
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:36,985
In fact, get a place, keep an eye on her.
We got three days. She's your only link.

359
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,088
Are we using her as bait?.

360
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,826
Just make the calls.

361
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:48,021
I'm sending you an attachment.
Can you print front and back?.

362
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:52,901
I've asked lNS for a list of arrivals
in the last six months.

363
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,063
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Matobo.
I'll do voice samples on everyone.

364
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,905
So when she hears the voice again,
she can identify it.

365
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,072
- She said it was a whisper.
- Well, now she thinks she can do it.

366
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:11,010
- Photo there yet?.
- It's printing. Let me put you on speaker.

367
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,529
That's an anti-Zuwanie rally.
The man speaking is Ajene Xola.

368
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,857
Look at the crowd.

369
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:26,769
Look closely.

370
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,643
Any leads?.

371
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,977
Maybe one.

372
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,347
Come on down to Mexico.

373
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,890
Is that you?.

374
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,401
Tell me what someone like you

375
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:41,168
who uses the word "diplomacy"
like she's chastising me

376
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,244
is doing at a rebel rally?.

377
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:47,076
- A peace rally.
- I don't want to do this again.

378
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:51,243
That's exactly what it is.
What I'm doing is listening.

379
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,184
After that. After you listen.

380
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:57,259
- You're asking the wrong question.
- It's one you don't want to answer.

381
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:02,057
Why would somebody type the names
of everyone in this on the back?.

382
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,235
This is a death list.

383
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:12,136
The question you should be asking is,
"Who gave me this and why??"

384
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,273
- What are you not saying?.
- What are you accusing me of?.

385
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:23,476
How do you feel about Zuwanie,
never mind "l don't care for him"?.

386
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,814
I feel disappointment.

387
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,685
That's a lover's word.

388
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,023
What about rage?.

389
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,666
Of all the people I've looked into
since this thing started,

390
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:43,135
the one with the darkest
Zuwanie history is you.

391
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,545
- It was his land-mines that killed your...
- Sh!

392
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,207
We don't name the dead.

393
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,944
Everyone who loses somebody
wants revenge,

394
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,885
on God if they can't find anyone else.

395
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,584
But in Africa,

396
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:11,891
in Matobo, the Ku believe that
the only way to end grief is to save a life.

397
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,963
If someone is murdered,

398
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:22,407
a year of mourning ends with a ritual
that we call the Drowning Man Trial.

399
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:28,449
There's an all-night party beside a river.
At dawn, the killer is put in a boat.

400
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:34,147
He's taken out on the water and he's
dropped. He's bound so that he can't swim.

401
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:38,192
The family of the dead then has to choose.
They can let him drown,

402
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,386
or they can save him.

403
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,328
The Ku believe that if the family
lets the killer drown,

404
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:51,838
they'll have justice
but spend the rest of their lives in mourning.

405
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:58,781
But if they save him,
if they admit that life isn't always just...

406
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,420
..that very act can take away their sorrow.

407
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,625
Vengeance is a lazy form of grief.

408
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,704
Why do you look away?.

409
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,239
There are things I don't like to talk about
and you call it lying.

410
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,549
But not when you do it.

411
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,115
I'm not the one under investigation.

412
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,290
That was a long time ago.

413
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,801
- FBI.
- Intel.

414
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,409
- TTF.
- Sniper team.

415
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,739
Secret Service.

416
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,906
This is Nils Lud,
head of Dr Zuwanie's security.

417
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,779
Shall we take a walk?.

418
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:47,856
(she plays haunting melodic tune)

419
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:59,897
- How close can a vehicle get over here?.
- Not close enough.

420
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:04,063
- No garage under the GA.
- Dogs sweep every night. It's not a bomb.

421
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,370
- It has to be a rifle.
- From where?.

422
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,478
How does he get a rifle in?.

423
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,951
- Could be from up close.
- Who gets that close?.

424
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,788
One of Zuwanie's bodyguards?.

425
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:31,332
That's a good thought, but we'd much prefer
to kill him at home without you watching.

426
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,526
It's already here.

427
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,771
If these guys know their stuff,
the weapon is here.

428
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,990
(phone rings)

429
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,661
Hello?.

430
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,596
- (line crackles - no voice)
- Hello, Philippe?. Hello?.

431
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,631
(she screams)

432
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,625
No prints on the door
and negative for latex dust.

433
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,126
- Nothing on the door?.
- No.

434
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,890
- No forced entry.
- Did Doug not see him?.

435
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:41,560
No, he missed it.
Some lady called 91 1, saw the guy.

436
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,707
Go easy on him, OK?. He feels terrible.

437
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:51,981
On the roof. He must have gone over the roof
to get to the next building.

438
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:56,585
- I couldn't see the fire escape.
- Give me that.

439
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,088
You mean you screwed up.

440
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:04,886
- I mean I screwed up.
- So did l.

441
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,733
I need Polaroids of that, inside and out.

442
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,160
- You OK?.
- Great.

443
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,398
- Who else has a key to this apartment?.
- No one.

444
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,669
- You don't keep a spare outside somewhere?.
- No.

445
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,870
- No one else has a key...
- Nobody.

446
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,675
- The door wasn't forced.
- They can't pick locks?.

447
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:30,251
They can, we can tell. They didn't.

448
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,581
- Where do you keep your key?.
- My purse.

449
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,816
- It hasn't been out of your sight all day?.
- No.

450
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,329
Yes.

451
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,001
In my locker.

452
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:50,799
Dot. Wake up Rory, have him dust her locker
and those beside it before morning.

453
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:57,313
So you were just having a quiet evening,
some gentleman in a mask waves to you.

454
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,108
That's about it, yeah.

455
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,376
(something falls)

456
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,680
Dot?.

457
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,890
Is there anything special about this mask?.

458
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:15,963
I'll be honest with you.
I don't know how honest I can be with you.

459
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:21,236
My brother gave it to me.

460
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,066
I still have a brother there
who I'm close to. Simon.

461
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:33,238
We've... Iost touch for a while,
but...we're close.

462
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:39,411
Is he standing on the road somewhere with
a machine-gun, or is he into diplomacy, too?.

463
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,591
He's more into lists.

464
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,988
Farm kids will do anything
to amuse themselves. Mostly you fight.

465
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,592
I read. My brother kept lists.

466
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:54,066
Weird lists in ratty notebooks.

467
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,206
Times and dates that Mum used the F-word,

468
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:01,207
countries with advantageous
male to female ratios,

469
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,879
odd animal facts.

470
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:07,414
Did you know the leading cause of death
for beavers is falling trees?.

471
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:11,019
- Yes.
- You did not.

472
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:16,282
He had a notebook for words that he liked.

473
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:20,088
Hypotenuse, doodad, bodacious.

474
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:24,331
Could he be involved in this?.

475
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,107
We're stuck, aren't we?. You and l?.

476
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,873
We're kepéla.

477
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,844
It means standing on
opposite sides of the river.

478
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,351
Give me a reason to get to the other side.

479
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,941
(speaking Ku)

480
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,886
(muffled cries)

481
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,694
Just wait a second.

482
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,614
OK.

483
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:57,783
There's a blue and white outside.
NYPD'll keep an eye on you until morning.

484
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,795
And then?.

485
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:06,764
We'll figure something out.

486
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,164
Thank you.

487
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,755
My wife was killed two weeks ago.

488
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,464
She...she'd left me.

489
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:43,905
She'd left me before,
but she'd always come back.

490
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,598
She was going to come back this time.

491
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,835
She said.

492
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,350
She was a dancer.

493
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,050
The guy was a dancer, too.

494
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:05,786
Eddie.

495
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,762
Great dancer.

496
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,958
Lousy driver.

497
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,502
The only way he knew how to stop a car

498
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:21,234
was to slam it
into a bridge abutment in Santa Fe.

499
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,042
So there was no taking her back this time.

500
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:36,448
The thing is, if he had lived,
and I had a choice...

501
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,765
.. I think I would have let him drown.

502
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,202
I might have even
held his head under the water.

503
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,205
Not a very Ku thing to do.

504
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:12,628
If you need anything, you can call the precinct
or just go downstairs.

505
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,536
This is my cell number.

506
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,310
It's the same card.

507
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,944
Goodnight.

508
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,616
Lock this.

509
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:46,622
It's a remodel. Owner's in the middle
of a divorce. We got lucky.

510
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,796
We got a clear view.
Front door's 50 seconds away.

511
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,202
- I'll do first shift.
- Are Lewis and Clark babysitting Kuman?.

512
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:00,875
Lewis and King. He'll be in bed soon.

513
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:04,240
FBl's right.
Guy does the same routine every day.

514
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,779
Call me if she gets
another trick-or-treater. I'm off.

515
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,682
Sweet dreams, partner.

516
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,924
(French being spoken)

517
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,324
(Silvia translates).. the belief
that the individual needs of people

518
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,591
are paramount to its purpose,
and with it goes the assumption

519
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:29,704
that human rights are fundamental
to human prosperity and development.

520
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:35,005
They cannot be separated.
They can only be said to exist...

521
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,340
You got one shot. You sever the brain stem,
creating paralysis,

522
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:43,315
you drop the perpetrator without reflex action.
He can't activate a detonator. Thank you.

523
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:51,058
If you have to issue a verbal warning,
you get very close before you do so.

524
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,094
No. There won't be time for a second one.

525
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:57,391
Whatever the weapon is,
consider this a suicide bomber.

526
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,796
There's no profile for a suicide bomber.

527
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:04,667
This could be nine or 90, male or female,
a PhD or a dropout.

528
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:08,366
All they have in common
is they are not afraid to die.

529
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:13,743
So this is either a fanatic for a cause
or someone who has nothing to live for.

530
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,319
We'll run two teams. DDO calls the decoy exit
30 seconds before the intersection.

531
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:24,426
NYPD snipers from these two buildings here,
our guys sniper the bridge.

532
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:28,189
Her locker was clean.
The others were covered with prints.

533
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:32,198
Someone wiped hers. We're looking
at a janitor or a maintenance worker.

534
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,233
Or another interpreter.

535
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:50,976
So when do we do this voice line-up?.

536
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,815
We're not doing that any more.

537
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:57,482
- She says she can't.
- Can't what?.

538
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:02,597
ID the voice. She thought she could, now
she thinks she can't. She's sure she can't.

539
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,998
She can't because she can't, or because
she never heard anything to start with?.

540
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:12,334
(conversation in Portuguese)

541
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:17,502
- He says he wasn't here... I think.
- Not according to this.

542
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:23,376
(he speaks Portuguese, she speaks French)

543
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,481
- He traded shifts with someone. Com quem?.
- Jamal.

544
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:31,460
Jad Jamal. He's in Crown Heights.

545
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,496
(knocking)

546
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,174
Afternoon. Secret Service.
Need to talk to Jad Jamal.

547
00:55:56,419 --> 00:56:00,378
- Does this guy live here?.
- No, no here. With lady.

548
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,991
You got lady's number?.

549
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,526
Does he have a cell phone?.

550
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,724
OK, we'll be back. If he shows up before that,
have him give us a call.

551
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:16,167
(chanting and singing)

552
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,140
(click of camera)

553
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,977
(phone)

554
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,517
- Hello?.
- Silvia, c'est moi. Philippe.

555
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,652
Philippe.

556
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:42,661
- Going out.
- I got her.

557
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,843
- Shit.
- Shit.

558
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:27,068
Oh, come on.

559
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,924
Philippe.

560
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:50,965
(she speaks French)

561
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,341
- What is it?.
- I've done a terrible thing.

562
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,568
- It is Simon.
- No, listen.

563
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:07,409
Someone contacted me.
One of Kuman's people...

564
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:12,384
I thought it was one of his people...
to arrange a meeting with Xola.

565
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:16,923
They said it was time to admit that
only together could they stop Zuwanie.

566
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:19,390
- What happened?.
- So I arrange it.

567
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,159
But it was a trap.

568
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,259
Xola's dead.

569
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,578
I knew it.

570
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,748
I knew he was dead.

571
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,747
Was my brother there?.

572
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,784
No, Simon wasn't there. Only Xola.

573
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:56,363
I stayed in the car. No one came back out.

574
00:58:57,467 --> 00:59:01,062
- Where is he?. Where's my brother?.
- I don't know.

575
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:05,771
- You think Kuman has him?.
- I don't know what to think.

576
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:11,504
Everything is chaos. It's all gone to hell.
How did it get to be like this?.

577
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:16,242
You see what I did?. I took Xola right to them.

578
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,756
- You didn't know.
- Forgive me.

579
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:27,529
- I was only trying to help.
- There's nothing to forgive.

580
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,659
Yes, there is.

581
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,994
- I have to go.
- Philippe.

582
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,737
(click of camera)

583
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:49,674
You cannot do that. How the hell do l
protect you if I don't know where you are?.

584
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:53,185
You emphatically told me that you weren't.

585
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:58,986
That was before you had a man in a mask
on your fire escape.

586
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:04,059
I've had a 24-hour shift of agents
across the street.

587
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:09,035
Who was that in the park?.

588
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,470
- It's personal.
- We're past that. What's his name?.

589
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,836
It's not your business.

590
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:18,639
Is he the one you e-mailed
before reporting the threat?.

591
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,478
"Where are you?.
I'm worried about you. Write me."

592
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:28,816
"Please. I need to know you're OK"?.

593
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,891
Worried why?. Because he's involved?.

594
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:38,932
Is that him, here, now, in my country,
making threats?. That is my business.

595
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,298
You're wrong. It's got nothing to do with you.

596
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,541
(Simon's voice) I'll take care of you.

597
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:43,562
- I'm going to Starbucks. Want anything?.
- Just what I need, another night without sleep.

598
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:46,291
I'm good. Thanks.

599
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:50,995
What's up with Common Kuman?.

600
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,767
- Brushing his teeth.
- I gotta talk to him.

601
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:58,310
Café Atlantic, noon to two, then
the Nava Club for a steam and massage.

602
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:01,972
- Coffee?.
- No, I'm good, thanks.

603
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:09,121
She can't sleep either. Just turned the TV on.

604
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,252
Probably PBS.

605
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,756
- Where you going?.
- You're here with your bag.

606
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,935
I can go home and get a good night's sleep.

607
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:23,963
Unless you want me to stay.

608
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:27,799
No. Thanks.

609
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:31,468
- Thanks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

610
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:36,641
United Nations, New York. Protests
erupted here following an announcement

611
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:41,313
that President Edmond Zuwanie
will address the General Assembly Friday.

612
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:45,551
The exiled leader Kuman-Kuman
rallied today's protesters.

613
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,731
He would be more convincing
if he were assassinated.

614
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,523
He doesn 't even have to die.

615
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,531
An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility,

616
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:57,297
he can do anything he wants...
and stick around to enjoy it.

617
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:02,206
Security is on heightened alert
in response to anonymous threats...

618
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,902
(cell phone)

619
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,015
- Keller.
- (Silvia) I'm sorry.

620
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,948
I really didn't know you were watching me...

621
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,155
.. or I wouldn 't have just... Ieft like that.

622
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:23,054
- You want to tell me what happened?.
- I had to meet someone.

623
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,534
- Philippe Broullet.
- If you knew, why did you ask?.

624
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,731
I know his name, I know he's
a photographer for a French magazine.

625
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,935
- He needed to talk to me.
- Now you're watching TV, unable to sleep.

626
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,774
- What did he say?.
- How do you know I'm...?.

627
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,211
Are you over there?.

628
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,222
Jesus.

629
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:58,624
He told me we lost a friend.

630
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:03,295
He lost a friend.
I... Iost someone I loved once.

631
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,304
It was a long time ago.

632
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,376
You can't sleep either.

633
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,709
I don't know why I'm calling you.

634
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:19,877
- What do you do when you can't sleep?.
- I stay awake.

635
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,559
You don't name the dead, you said. Why?.

636
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,126
What...what happens?.

637
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,769
You move past them. You leave them behind.

638
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:42,801
You can do that,
but you have to be ready to let them go.

639
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,775
To move on.

640
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,680
You've been going through hell.

641
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,478
Keeping busy.

642
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:57,787
You, too, I think. I don't know all of it, but...

643
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,999
Are you going to be there until morning?.

644
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:12,299
It almost is morning.

645
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,776
Yeah, I'll be here.

646
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:20,980
Is it OK if I just try to fall asleep
over the phone?.

647
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,957
That's fine.

648
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,138
Goodnight.

649
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,823
She's coming your way.

650
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,592
Oh, no. No scooter, please.
Come on, no scooter.

651
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,200
Yes. Thank you, God.

652
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:27,443
You might as well drive me.
We're going to Brooklyn.

653
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,344
Corner of Bergen and Nostrand.

654
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:36,014
Jad Jamal. Worked the interpreters' lounge
the day the mask showed up.

655
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,717
- Bring him to me.
- Can't. He didn't show up for work.

656
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,920
- Sit on his apartment.
- Doug's there.

657
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,463
Hey. Got the lNS files.

658
01:06:55,411 --> 01:07:00,246
- This isn't the way it's supposed to be done.
- You can let me off up here.

659
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:22,836
She's at the corner of Bergen
and Nostrand in Brooklyn.

660
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,304
- She's where?.
- My guy's on the move.

661
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,939
She's here, whether I brought her or not.

662
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,638
- Go back. What's she doing?.
- Waiting for something.

663
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,283
- Holy shit.
- What?.

664
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,783
The janitor. Jad Jamal.

665
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:42,617
- That's not him.
- I know. That's his room-mate.

666
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,871
Jamal's room-mate just left the building.

667
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,768
His name is Gamba. Jean Gamba.

668
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:02,375
- Should I stay here?.
- No, you stick with the room-mate.

669
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,547
- Are we working on a warrant?.
- Lewis is.

670
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:08,045
- How are you?.
- I got something for you.

671
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,048
OK, bless you.

672
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,020
Tobin?.

673
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,568
- What's up?.
- I don't know, but it don't feel good.

674
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,200
- What are they doing?.
- Just standing there.

675
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,342
We're getting on the el.

676
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:26,053
(speaks Ku)

677
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,160
- Shit.
- She just got on the bus with Kuman.

678
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,864
(Tobin) What the hell is she doing?.

679
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:43,214
Did I hear home?.

680
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:48,621
- Or was I wrong, then?.
- No, you're right. I'm Matoban.

681
01:09:48,827 --> 01:09:51,261
And a fair Matoban, in fact.

682
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:56,094
(Tobin) King, you stay with that bus.

683
01:09:59,605 --> 01:10:02,130
Do you know who I am?.

684
01:10:02,341 --> 01:10:03,399
Yes.

685
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:08,805
You're a killer.
You ordered the murder of Ajene Xola.

686
01:10:16,955 --> 01:10:20,891
You got a red light in that car?.
Why don't you use it?.

687
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:25,427
- Who told you this nonsense?.
- Where's my brother?.

688
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:28,498
Your brother?. I don't even know who you are.

689
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:33,970
You are on the wrong bus, so to speak,
to be so reckless.

690
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:45,775
Your people arranged a meeting
through Philippe Broullet.

691
01:10:45,984 --> 01:10:49,647
- You know him.
- I don't...and I didn't.

692
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:54,656
But the fact is, somebody wants you
to believe that I killed Ajene Xola.

693
01:10:55,761 --> 01:11:00,755
- I don't believe you.
- (Kuman-Kuman) But you should believe me.

694
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:04,163
- Why?.
- Because I would form a coalition with Xola.

695
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:08,335
Neither of us have made
enough progress alone.

696
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,703
He has the working people.
I have the finances.

697
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:17,473
If he is dead, it is a loss
for all of us. Me especially.

698
01:11:17,683 --> 01:11:19,947
(Doug) We're getting off.

699
01:11:23,789 --> 01:11:25,950
I got the back room.

700
01:11:30,862 --> 01:11:32,955
Jesus.

701
01:11:34,733 --> 01:11:36,291
Clear the other room.

702
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:50,814
OK.

703
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:53,712
- Closet.
- Yeah. I got the bed.

704
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,733
(Dot) Ho! Keller?.

705
01:12:14,106 --> 01:12:16,870
- We got a dead body in the closet.
- Jamal?.

706
01:12:17,075 --> 01:12:21,705
Yeah. I'll call it in.
God, how can you see in here?.

707
01:12:21,913 --> 01:12:23,710
Wait. Wait.

708
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,745
Why the lanterns?.

709
01:12:34,426 --> 01:12:36,553
Well, that's just rude.

710
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:03,881
- What do you do so far away from home?.
- I work. And I hope.

711
01:13:04,089 --> 01:13:07,581
- Same as me, then.
- I doubt it.

712
01:13:11,329 --> 01:13:13,422
You work for...?.

713
01:13:13,632 --> 01:13:16,624
I'm an interpreter at the UN.

714
01:13:16,835 --> 01:13:20,965
So like the UN.
Layers of languages signifying nothing.

715
01:13:21,173 --> 01:13:23,971
- You'd prefer more war?.
- I prefer more business.

716
01:13:24,176 --> 01:13:26,974
Guys, get with me here. We got a situation.

717
01:13:27,179 --> 01:13:32,446
No, boss, we got a situation.
We just got on the 1 33. With Mohammad.

718
01:13:32,651 --> 01:13:36,178
And Silvia Broome. And Kuman-Kuman.

719
01:13:36,388 --> 01:13:38,856
- What?.
- You're on the same bus?.

720
01:13:39,057 --> 01:13:40,649
With our subjects.

721
01:13:40,859 --> 01:13:44,488
Get off the bus,
and get Silvia Broome off that bus now.

722
01:13:44,696 --> 01:13:47,130
We can't do that. We're moving.

723
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,666
Doug, is the room-mate carrying anything?.

724
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:58,637
- Doug, is he carrying anything?.
- A satchel.

725
01:14:00,212 --> 01:14:05,445
- All right...where is it?.
- It's in his lap. He's been carrying it all day.

726
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,983
- Oh, man.
- Can either of you get to him?.

727
01:14:11,022 --> 01:14:13,855
Not without gettin' made.

728
01:14:14,059 --> 01:14:17,620
Despite all the flags on First Avenue,
there are no nations any more.

729
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:23,665
Only companies. International companies.
It's where we are. It's what we are.

730
01:14:27,205 --> 01:14:29,366
I think you're wrong.

731
01:14:29,574 --> 01:14:33,010
You are still young. I'm an acquired taste.

732
01:14:35,614 --> 01:14:38,014
What's your brother's name?.

733
01:14:40,285 --> 01:14:43,880
Simon. Simon Broome.

734
01:14:44,089 --> 01:14:48,082
- OK, we're stopping.
- You got guts, coming out here.

735
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:54,393
I'll see what my people can find out about him.

736
01:14:54,599 --> 01:14:59,662
But remember,
I'm not your brother's keeper, eh?.

737
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:01,998
Yeah. Thank you.

738
01:15:03,775 --> 01:15:06,744
Come on, guys, talk to me. What's going on?.

739
01:15:06,945 --> 01:15:09,573
We're stopped. She's getting off.

740
01:15:12,117 --> 01:15:16,247
- What's going on?.
- And so is my subject.

741
01:15:17,422 --> 01:15:22,291
Keep talking to me. What's going on?.
Is he carrying the satchel?.

742
01:15:22,494 --> 01:15:25,554
OK, he's got the satchel.
But I think he made me.

743
01:15:25,764 --> 01:15:27,197
That's OK, I got him.

744
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,859
- Kuman?.
- He's staying put.

745
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:33,264
Miss Broome! Please get in the car.

746
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:36,905
Move it!

747
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:39,201
- I got Gamba.
- I'll stay with Kuman.

748
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:44,246
No. Just get off that bus.
Get everybody off that bus right now!

749
01:15:47,619 --> 01:15:49,382
- Doug!
- Mohammad?.

750
01:15:51,056 --> 01:15:54,321
- Hey! Guy forgot his lunch.
- Oh, man.

751
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:18,242
I'm standing here on Nostrand Avenue
in Crown Heights,

752
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:21,977
at a scene that can only be described
as unconscionable carnage.

753
01:16:22,187 --> 01:16:26,180
..frantically helping victims
of an apparent terrorist attack.

754
01:16:26,391 --> 01:16:30,122
These events are more familiar
in the cities of the Middle East.

755
01:16:30,328 --> 01:16:34,662
There is no word yet.
However, there are unconfirmed reports

756
01:16:34,866 --> 01:16:39,701
that Kuman-Kuman, the exiled Matoban
revolutionary, may have been on board.

757
01:16:39,905 --> 01:16:41,964
- You all right?.
- I'm OK.

758
01:16:42,173 --> 01:16:44,801
Doug?.

759
01:16:51,016 --> 01:16:54,543
This is Ron Ferguson, reporting live
on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn,

760
01:16:54,753 --> 01:16:57,779
where just after 1 0.30 am this morning...

761
01:17:03,695 --> 01:17:05,720
We're OK, boss.

762
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,666
(reporter).. the violence has now found
its way into the heart of New York City...

763
01:17:12,871 --> 01:17:17,706
- The death toll is 1 7, with scores injured...
- The obvious speculation about al-Qaeda...

764
01:17:17,909 --> 01:17:20,969
.. widely seen as the probable successor
to Edmond Zuwanie...

765
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:23,909
Tunnels and bridges
will close for at least 1 2 hours...

766
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:26,845
.. alleged terrorist attack by Ajene Xola...

767
01:17:27,052 --> 01:17:31,045
.. Zuwanie is still planning to address
the General Assembly of the UN.

768
01:17:41,099 --> 01:17:44,034
What were you doing on that bus?.

769
01:17:45,103 --> 01:17:48,004
Thank you for bringing me home.

770
01:17:57,315 --> 01:17:59,579
Hey!

771
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:04,945
I lost a man today. A kid.

772
01:18:07,926 --> 01:18:10,724
- How do you know Kuman?.
- I never met him before.

773
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:14,558
You think that not getting caught in a lie
is the same as the truth!

774
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:17,929
- I'm not lying. I went to him for help.
- With what?.

775
01:18:18,136 --> 01:18:21,128
I can't tell you. Someone might get hurt.

776
01:18:21,339 --> 01:18:25,605
"Someone might get hurt."
There's a bus full of dead people!

777
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:28,973
"Someone might get hurt"?.
Who?. Someone you know?.

778
01:18:29,214 --> 01:18:32,809
Someone who's mixed up in all this?.
You?. Why did you leave Africa?.

779
01:18:33,018 --> 01:18:36,146
- I told you.
- No, you didn't. Why did you come here?.

780
01:18:36,354 --> 01:18:38,447
- Stop it.
- Goddammit!

781
01:18:38,656 --> 01:18:40,590
- Stop shouting at me!
- Stop lying!

782
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,453
- I'm not lying!
- Stop lying!

783
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:47,996
I was just on that bus! I can't think
with all this noise. I can't! You have to stop!

784
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,313
That isn't me.

785
01:19:12,524 --> 01:19:14,355
Don't be ridiculous.

786
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,923
- It isn't me.
- No, that is you.

787
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,530
And I know, because I drive you home,

788
01:19:21,766 --> 01:19:26,965
and I look at you through the binoculars,
and everything else that I shouldn't do.

789
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:34,304
It was once.

790
01:19:34,512 --> 01:19:36,537
It's not any more.

791
01:19:38,516 --> 01:19:43,544
After the rallies,
after my parents and sister were killed,

792
01:19:43,755 --> 01:19:46,155
then the rifles came out.

793
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:51,661
It was the only way to get anyone to listen.
Just to listen.

794
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:00,963
I killed a boy who had nothing to live for
beyond the money he'd get for killing me.

795
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:05,867
I shot him in the head
so he wouldn't shoot me.

796
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:15,380
Then I handed the rifle to my brother
and told him, "I'm through."

797
01:20:15,587 --> 01:20:20,251
I walked away with him shouting at me,
"You're a coward."

798
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:23,655
"Our parents are dead, Zuwanie's alive."

799
01:20:25,964 --> 01:20:30,094
My brother,
who in another life wouldn't harm a...

800
01:20:34,572 --> 01:20:37,439
That was the last thing he ever said to me.

801
01:20:37,642 --> 01:20:42,011
The only contact I have is the notebooks
I send and imagine him receiving.

802
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:44,909
I know he's alive. I know it.

803
01:20:46,851 --> 01:20:48,580
But I'm not to him.

804
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:56,358
I lied to you because I was afraid.

805
01:20:57,428 --> 01:21:00,693
I was afraid
he might be involved in what I heard.

806
01:21:03,768 --> 01:21:07,704
I lied to everyone else
so they'd let me near the UN,

807
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:12,843
and that's the only place that I believe
has a chance to change any of this.

808
01:21:14,012 --> 01:21:17,379
And I lied to you about Ajene Xola because...

809
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:20,346
I loved him. Once.

810
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:24,911
Until the colour of my skin became a problem.

811
01:21:25,123 --> 01:21:27,387
The politics of my skin.

812
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:35,893
I walked away from Africa with nothing.
No brother, no family, no lover, nothing.

813
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:41,231
Just a belief that words and compassion
are the better way.

814
01:21:42,473 --> 01:21:45,237
Even if it's slower than a gun.

815
01:21:54,519 --> 01:21:56,783
Where are you going?.

816
01:21:57,922 --> 01:22:00,584
You've got blood all over your face.

817
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:04,125
You can't say stuff like that
with blood on your face.

818
01:23:46,831 --> 01:23:49,732
- (protesters shouting)
- (man speaking Ku)

819
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:53,426
This is precisely why Dr Zuwanie
must be allowed to speak.

820
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:59,100
(translation) This monstrous act of terrorism
was aimed at you...

821
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:04,441
..and at the heart of the United Nations.

822
01:24:04,649 --> 01:24:08,312
- I can't listen to this.
- Do not allow them to intimidate you...

823
01:24:09,554 --> 01:24:10,748
..or Dr Zuwanie.

824
01:24:11,956 --> 01:24:14,390
(policeman) I'm not at liberty to tell you.

825
01:24:22,166 --> 01:24:25,533
- Where we going?.
- Bathroom.

826
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,536
Keller.

827
01:24:53,231 --> 01:24:56,428
Get this processed and back to me right away.

828
01:25:26,764 --> 01:25:29,460
Did he leave a note?.

829
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:37,200
Did you read it?.

830
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,706
Of course you did.

831
01:25:43,214 --> 01:25:46,240
Would you read it to me, please?.

832
01:25:56,294 --> 01:26:01,926
"Dear Silvia, I came to tell you something
and then didn't."

833
01:26:03,034 --> 01:26:07,198
"l wanted to, but when I saw you
I couldn't find the words."

834
01:26:09,407 --> 01:26:14,037
"l told you I didn't know where Simon is.
That was a lie."

835
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:17,737
"He was there that day.
A young boy shot him."

836
01:26:21,486 --> 01:26:24,944
"l couldn't tell you. I'm a coward.
Simon was braver than me."

837
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:27,784
"You're braver than me. I'm so sorry."

838
01:26:27,992 --> 01:26:30,426
I'm so sorry.

839
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:36,256
The second time was me.

840
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:54,612
I feel like my friends must feel
when they try to say something.

841
01:26:56,854 --> 01:27:00,585
- It's all right.
- That's what I say to them.

842
01:27:13,871 --> 01:27:16,135
He left this with the note.

843
01:27:23,147 --> 01:27:26,913
The only thing that I wanted...

844
01:27:33,958 --> 01:27:36,620
.. besides having her back...

845
01:27:36,827 --> 01:27:39,022
was to be left alone.

846
01:29:07,852 --> 01:29:11,117
(child's voice)
¶ My bonnie lies over the ocean ¶

847
01:29:18,162 --> 01:29:20,027
(young Simon's voice) Don't cry.

848
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:25,233
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

849
01:29:25,436 --> 01:29:28,132
- You don't have to cry.
- I'm not.

850
01:29:28,372 --> 01:29:31,933
Because I'm here,
and I won 't leave. I promise.

851
01:29:33,144 --> 01:29:36,580
Look at me. I'll take care of you.

852
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:40,945
(Silvia 's voice) We'll take care of each other.

853
01:29:43,487 --> 01:29:45,717
I'll take care of you.

854
01:30:00,971 --> 01:30:03,098
(young Simon) Promise me.

855
01:30:09,647 --> 01:30:11,808
(Silvia) I promise.

856
01:30:30,568 --> 01:30:32,900
I promise.

857
01:30:42,379 --> 01:30:44,370
(thunder)

858
01:32:24,148 --> 01:32:26,912
(shower running)

859
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:03,075
Xola's dead. Kuman's dead.

860
01:33:05,322 --> 01:33:07,415
Who do you work for?.

861
01:33:08,192 --> 01:33:12,686
- Don't touch.
- Those things'll kill you.

862
01:33:15,699 --> 01:33:18,793
(thunder continues)

863
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:36,777
Russell!

864
01:33:38,188 --> 01:33:40,850
(shower still running)

865
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:20,488
(neighbour) Hey!.

866
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,064
(neighbours) - What the hell's going on?.
- Close the door!.

867
01:34:30,874 --> 01:34:32,774
Silvia!

868
01:34:33,811 --> 01:34:36,507
- Silvia!
- (footfall)

869
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,626
(shower still running)

870
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:08,039
Silvia!

871
01:35:09,813 --> 01:35:11,940
Keller!

872
01:35:12,149 --> 01:35:13,480
Keller!

873
01:35:18,956 --> 01:35:22,255
She's not here. Check the roof.

874
01:35:33,003 --> 01:35:35,301
(siren)

875
01:35:39,443 --> 01:35:40,569
(Dot) Jay?.

876
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:47,615
- Dot, what have you got?.
- There was something on her credit card.

877
01:35:47,818 --> 01:35:51,652
His name is Jean Gamba. He's our bomber.

878
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:56,687
- And our assassin?.
- That would be good for us.

879
01:35:56,894 --> 01:35:58,521
But I doubt it.

880
01:35:58,729 --> 01:36:00,356
He tried to kill her.

881
01:36:00,564 --> 01:36:03,727
- What happened?.
- I shot him.

882
01:36:05,502 --> 01:36:09,131
That's a pity.
He might have told us something.

883
01:36:09,339 --> 01:36:12,172
- And Miss Broome?.
- Gone.

884
01:36:12,376 --> 01:36:17,439
- He killed her?.
- She was gone before he got there.

885
01:36:21,285 --> 01:36:24,379
- Mind if I take a look upstairs?.
- Hold on. Dino?.

886
01:36:24,588 --> 01:36:28,684
- Yeah.
- Take Mr Lud to the apartment. And Brian?.

887
01:36:28,892 --> 01:36:34,387
- Get NYPD to push their tapeline...
- Keller?. Go home and get some sleep.

888
01:36:34,598 --> 01:36:37,192
- I'm gonna wait for her.
- Like hell you are.

889
01:36:37,401 --> 01:36:42,202
I need you awake tomorrow morning.
Woods?. Get him home.

890
01:36:47,945 --> 01:36:52,348
- Drive around the block.
- You heard Jay. I gotta take you home.

891
01:36:52,549 --> 01:36:57,953
What if there were two guys?. Three?.
We just set the trap and run?. Is that it?.

892
01:36:58,956 --> 01:37:02,824
They're not our family
and they're not our friends.

893
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,687
You told me that.

894
01:37:04,895 --> 01:37:09,923
You lose somebody, you lose somebody.
I don't want to lose two somebodys.

895
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:16,864
One circle, then I'm taking you home.

896
01:37:18,142 --> 01:37:20,167
(beeping)

897
01:37:38,328 --> 01:37:41,991
(Silvia) Hello?. Are you there?.

898
01:37:44,401 --> 01:37:48,838
I'm fine. I'm all right, but I...

899
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:51,803
I can't talk to you.

900
01:37:52,009 --> 01:37:56,605
You were right.
My brother... my brother was right.

901
01:37:56,813 --> 01:38:00,180
It takes too long, Tobin. I'm going home.

902
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:24,438
(phone ringing)

903
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:27,199
Keller.

904
01:38:27,411 --> 01:38:31,177
Keller, Lewis. Those numbers
scribbled on Jamal's kitchen wall.

905
01:38:31,381 --> 01:38:35,681
Ray's Pizza, some sex lines, a hardware store
and a global cell phone.

906
01:38:35,886 --> 01:38:37,615
Chase down the global cell.

907
01:38:37,821 --> 01:38:39,789
- Keller, it's Mo.
- Go ahead, Mo.

908
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:42,185
She booked a flight online.

909
01:38:42,392 --> 01:38:46,158
Check all flights to South Africa
out of JFK, LaGuardia and Newark.

910
01:38:46,363 --> 01:38:48,729
And then what?. If I find her.

911
01:38:52,169 --> 01:38:54,330
Get her on the phone with me.

912
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:02,342
He's here.

913
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,260
That's him?.

914
01:39:28,805 --> 01:39:29,863
Second car.

915
01:39:51,261 --> 01:39:55,061
Keller?. Lewis.
The global cell belongs to Jean Gamba.

916
01:39:55,265 --> 01:39:57,495
- Got the times of the calls?.
- Yeah.

917
01:39:57,701 --> 01:40:00,602
Day before yesterday, 3.30 pm.
Anything there?.

918
01:40:00,804 --> 01:40:04,365
- Day before yesterday, 3.30?.
- 3.30, yeah.

919
01:40:04,574 --> 01:40:07,099
Call it. No, have Lewis call.

920
01:40:07,311 --> 01:40:09,176
- I'm Lewis.
- Clark, I mean.

921
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:12,177
- No, King. And he's dialling.
- Extension 647.

922
01:40:12,382 --> 01:40:15,442
The bus. Right after.
I want to know who he called.

923
01:40:15,652 --> 01:40:19,418
It's King. It's the Matoban mission.
An extension.

924
01:40:21,725 --> 01:40:26,025
- Lud?.
- No, someone named Marcus Matu.

925
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,891
Head over. I need a face for that name.

926
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:58,123
(Mo) She's booked 9 am, JFK.

927
01:40:58,362 --> 01:41:01,889
- I'm on the LIE. Almost there.
- Call me from the gate.

928
01:41:34,464 --> 01:41:38,833
Not as much sky as I remember,
but more skyscrapers.

929
01:41:39,035 --> 01:41:42,766
23 years, Dr Zuwanie. Things change.

930
01:41:42,973 --> 01:41:44,600
They diminish.

931
01:41:46,376 --> 01:41:48,640
Desire diminishes.

932
01:41:49,713 --> 01:41:53,774
- Where is the Second Avenue?.
- Just after we get off the bridge.

933
01:41:55,018 --> 01:41:57,885
They decorated the bridge.

934
01:41:58,088 --> 01:42:03,219
When I came here before, they lined
the bridge with flowers, welcoming me.

935
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:05,951
- That flight departs from gate one.
- Thank you.

936
01:42:06,163 --> 01:42:10,964
- No sign of her. Hasn't checked in yet.
- Let me know when it's boarding.

937
01:42:11,168 --> 01:42:14,365
Can we hold 'em in the safe room
to buy time?.

938
01:42:14,571 --> 01:42:17,301
You can try, but it's up to him.

939
01:42:21,411 --> 01:42:25,677
There was a parade.
Right here on this Second Avenue.

940
01:42:25,882 --> 01:42:28,350
There was a snowstorm of confetti.

941
01:42:35,225 --> 01:42:37,750
(indistinct shouting and chanting)

942
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:45,000
(protester) Murderer!

943
01:42:49,573 --> 01:42:51,473
This is Second Avenue, sir.

944
01:43:04,054 --> 01:43:06,545
- Are you at the mission?.
- Yeah, but he isn't.

945
01:43:06,756 --> 01:43:10,920
- Nobody knows where he is.
- They know, they just won't tell us.

946
01:43:11,127 --> 01:43:12,924
- You get a photo lD?.
- Yeah.

947
01:43:13,129 --> 01:43:16,621
Go back inside
and fax that to UN security now.

948
01:43:16,833 --> 01:43:19,358
Get his address and get over there.

949
01:43:19,569 --> 01:43:21,594
I've got eight minutes.

950
01:43:55,138 --> 01:43:56,503
(Dot) Keep it tight.

951
01:44:14,524 --> 01:44:16,583
Agent Keller!

952
01:44:30,707 --> 01:44:34,507
He's here. I just saw him.
Broadcast that description.

953
01:44:50,594 --> 01:44:53,927
49th...42nd.

954
01:44:55,165 --> 01:44:56,996
Good. Next.

955
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,600
Move on.

956
01:45:11,481 --> 01:45:13,642
There it is.

957
01:45:23,226 --> 01:45:25,786
- OK.
- All right, go.

958
01:45:31,267 --> 01:45:34,293
- Levels, please.
- Un, deux, trois...

959
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:53,720
Ladies and gentlemen, British Airways
flight 1 78 to Johannesburg is ready to close.

960
01:45:53,923 --> 01:45:56,756
Please make your way
to gate one immediately. Thank you.

961
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:02,227
- Thank you. Levels, please.
- (counting in Russian)

962
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:51,002
The Assembly will first hear an address
by the President of the Republic of Matobo.

963
01:46:51,214 --> 01:46:53,512
On behalf of the General Assembly,

964
01:46:53,717 --> 01:46:56,413
I have the honour to welcome
to the United Nations

965
01:46:56,619 --> 01:47:01,955
His Excellency Dr Edmond Zuwanie,
President of the Republic of Matobo,

966
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:05,491
and to invite him to address the Assembly.

967
01:47:05,695 --> 01:47:07,526
(smattering of applause)

968
01:47:17,173 --> 01:47:20,506
Mr President, Mr Secretary-General.

969
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:23,645
Today my beloved country is under siege.

970
01:47:23,847 --> 01:47:26,873
As you saw the other afternoon
across the river in Brooklyn,

971
01:47:27,083 --> 01:47:30,280
the terrorists in my country will stop at nothing.

972
01:47:30,487 --> 01:47:34,685
How am I to defend my country
against enemies like these?.

973
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:38,383
- I admit I have dealt harshly with terrorists...
- Tobin, it's King.

974
01:47:38,595 --> 01:47:41,189
-..as we all will have to.
- I don't think Matu's here.

975
01:47:41,397 --> 01:47:45,231
Remember the profile of suicide bombers
and how there isn't one?.

976
01:47:45,435 --> 01:47:48,131
..who know the evil
and violence of real terrorism...

977
01:47:48,338 --> 01:47:51,637
Your mother and sister
will get their cheque on Monday.

978
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:55,208
- This isn't his apartment.
- You did well.

979
01:47:55,411 --> 01:47:58,539
No one here will live long.
It's an AlDS hospice.

980
01:47:58,748 --> 01:48:03,845
-..with a reciprocal and immediate violence...
- My opinion?. It's a con.

981
01:48:04,053 --> 01:48:06,487
I have been forced to do this.

982
01:48:06,689 --> 01:48:11,149
It is the hope and specific goal
of my administration

983
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:15,661
- to reform these brutal methods...
- Get him off the podium.

984
01:48:15,865 --> 01:48:19,665
- To participate in the formation...
- We've got to go.

985
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:21,996
But I want to speak!

986
01:48:23,973 --> 01:48:25,531
(click)

987
01:48:27,243 --> 01:48:28,801
(screaming)

988
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:33,378
Come on, sir, run!

989
01:48:38,888 --> 01:48:42,346
(alarm blares)

990
01:48:53,269 --> 01:48:54,896
He's OK.

991
01:48:55,104 --> 01:48:57,538
- Cover here. I'll take the hall.
- Where's Keller?.

992
01:48:57,740 --> 01:48:59,332
Freeze!

993
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,756
Incredible. Thank God I looked up.

994
01:49:13,957 --> 01:49:16,425
- He's from our mission.
- I know. Holster your weapon.

995
01:49:18,828 --> 01:49:21,160
Dr Zuwanie.

996
01:49:22,532 --> 01:49:24,625
I remember the last time you were here.

997
01:49:24,834 --> 01:49:30,500
- (security) Use the 42nd Street exit.
- We almost had an assassination here.

998
01:49:30,707 --> 01:49:32,334
(security) Please move...

999
01:49:32,542 --> 01:49:36,137
We watched you on the telly back home.

1000
01:49:36,346 --> 01:49:40,976
My family. All the families.
You were like the Beatles.

1001
01:49:41,184 --> 01:49:45,416
Two or three more seconds,
he would have assassinated him.

1002
01:49:45,622 --> 01:49:48,819
An almost-assassinated leader
gets so much credibility

1003
01:49:49,025 --> 01:49:52,961
so he can stay in power
and gets to stick around to enjoy it.

1004
01:49:53,162 --> 01:49:55,960
We were so proud of you.

1005
01:49:57,934 --> 01:50:01,927
There you were, speaking to the world.

1006
01:50:04,974 --> 01:50:07,602
I don't think you should touch...

1007
01:50:09,379 --> 01:50:11,438
Because I'm not wearing a glove?.

1008
01:50:11,648 --> 01:50:14,412
What is your name, child?.

1009
01:50:16,552 --> 01:50:18,952
I'm the Silvia whose family you killed.

1010
01:50:20,723 --> 01:50:23,624
- What's in your hand?.
- It's... Just a precaution.

1011
01:50:23,826 --> 01:50:28,490
What's in your hand?.
He must've been very surprised.

1012
01:50:28,698 --> 01:50:30,962
He thought it was a live round.

1013
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:36,305
- Where is everyone?.
- But you knew better.

1014
01:50:38,908 --> 01:50:40,136
(click)

1015
01:50:46,015 --> 01:50:47,448
Give me the live round.

1016
01:50:50,253 --> 01:50:55,555
I grew up seeing you with this gun.
It's the gun you saved our country with.

1017
01:50:55,758 --> 01:50:58,158
- Drop the gun!
- Put it down!

1018
01:50:58,361 --> 01:51:00,556
Keller, US Secret Service.

1019
01:51:01,431 --> 01:51:04,764
It's the same one you used to kill it.

1020
01:51:04,968 --> 01:51:08,904
- He's got a Glock on his hip.
- Code 1 00 in the sound room.

1021
01:51:16,913 --> 01:51:18,346
Look at it.

1022
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:24,684
Look at it!

1023
01:51:29,525 --> 01:51:34,053
- Careful. The bleeder had AlDS.
- There's no way you can prove this.

1024
01:51:34,263 --> 01:51:37,232
You'll cop a plea.
You're just an employee, right?.

1025
01:51:37,433 --> 01:51:41,733
- He's in custody. They're bringing him down.
- SWAT team's at 42nd Street.

1026
01:51:43,172 --> 01:51:45,402
- Are you all right?.
- Yeah. Where's Zuwanie?.

1027
01:51:45,608 --> 01:51:48,270
- The safe room. What happened?.
- It was a fake.

1028
01:51:48,478 --> 01:51:52,710
A piece of theatre to justify the killing.
Ethnic cleansing, genocide.

1029
01:51:52,915 --> 01:51:56,146
You there?. That's the flight. She's not on it.

1030
01:51:56,352 --> 01:51:58,912
I checked every hotel in New York,
her friends.

1031
01:51:59,122 --> 01:52:02,148
They don't know where she'd go.
No one knows her.

1032
01:52:02,358 --> 01:52:05,486
- I know her.
- OK, where is she?.

1033
01:52:05,695 --> 01:52:08,892
- She said she was going home.
- (Silvia) I'm going home...

1034
01:52:09,098 --> 01:52:10,463
What home?.

1035
01:52:10,666 --> 01:52:14,659
- How'd you happen to be there after hours?.
- (Silvia) An evacuation. I left some things.

1036
01:52:14,871 --> 01:52:17,738
It takes too long...
I wouldn 't mind if he were gone.

1037
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,408
She's here. She's been in that room all night.

1038
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:24,910
How could someone so good, so...

1039
01:52:26,015 --> 01:52:28,677
How could you give us so much,

1040
01:52:29,819 --> 01:52:31,252
so much...

1041
01:52:33,189 --> 01:52:35,282
then take away more?.

1042
01:52:36,726 --> 01:52:39,854
- He in there?.
- Yeah.

1043
01:52:41,831 --> 01:52:44,163
Keep everybody out.

1044
01:52:45,234 --> 01:52:47,293
Silvia?.

1045
01:52:47,503 --> 01:52:48,697
Silvia?.

1046
01:52:50,406 --> 01:52:52,670
It's me.

1047
01:52:52,875 --> 01:52:55,867
I'm coming in alone. I'm coming in.

1048
01:52:57,647 --> 01:52:59,808
Five minutes.

1049
01:53:04,387 --> 01:53:07,117
Close it.

1050
01:53:07,323 --> 01:53:11,054
- Close it!
- Silvia, don't do this.

1051
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:15,697
It was all just theatre, an almost-assassination
meant to justify his acts.

1052
01:53:15,898 --> 01:53:19,459
- We've got all we need to prosecute.
- I have him.

1053
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:23,161
- He'll die in prison.
- I want him to die how Simon died.

1054
01:53:23,372 --> 01:53:26,967
That'll be over in two seconds,
and you'll have all your years.

1055
01:53:27,176 --> 01:53:31,044
Sir, it's a lot worse than you think.
Your so-called assassin is dead.

1056
01:53:31,247 --> 01:53:33,841
Your head of security is making a deal.

1057
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:38,043
We have Lud and the rifle.
You'll be tried before two courts.

1058
01:53:38,254 --> 01:53:41,189
- He's been tried!
- Sir, you're finished.

1059
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:46,657
- It doesn't matter!
- Silvia. Listen to me.

1060
01:53:46,863 --> 01:53:49,525
I told you I'd let him drown.

1061
01:53:49,732 --> 01:53:53,031
The man who drove my wife
into a bridge abutment.

1062
01:53:55,204 --> 01:53:58,173
- But I wouldn't.
- Then you'd be wrong.

1063
01:53:58,374 --> 01:54:03,277
No, I wouldn't be wrong. I don't want
to spend the rest of my life in mourning.

1064
01:54:09,218 --> 01:54:11,277
(cocks gun)

1065
01:54:14,824 --> 01:54:17,520
You have to get out of here.

1066
01:54:17,727 --> 01:54:21,219
I can't do that. So put the gun down.

1067
01:54:22,231 --> 01:54:25,689
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Put it down.

1068
01:54:25,902 --> 01:54:29,235
I can't! I can't... I can't.

1069
01:54:29,906 --> 01:54:31,601
Just go.

1070
01:54:45,955 --> 01:54:48,321
This is how it's done.

1071
01:54:56,499 --> 01:54:58,967
This is how you put a gun down.

1072
01:55:10,179 --> 01:55:12,010
Please.

1073
01:55:14,217 --> 01:55:17,618
You shoot him, he'll be dead...

1074
01:55:20,089 --> 01:55:22,751
..but then you'll be dead...

1075
01:55:24,927 --> 01:55:27,691
..and I don't know what I'll be.

1076
01:55:33,369 --> 01:55:35,564
Put it down.

1077
01:55:38,507 --> 01:55:40,441
Read it!

1078
01:55:41,544 --> 01:55:43,273
Read it.

1079
01:55:44,380 --> 01:55:47,508
- Where?.
- The beginning. Read it.

1080
01:55:54,323 --> 01:55:58,783
- "The gunfire around us..."
- Louder. Like when you wrote it.

1081
01:56:00,029 --> 01:56:02,896
When you believed it.

1082
01:56:03,099 --> 01:56:05,192
When you meant it.

1083
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:15,871
"The gunfire around us makes it hard to hear."

1084
01:56:18,281 --> 01:56:24,242
"But the human voice
is different from other sounds."

1085
01:56:27,923 --> 01:56:33,486
- "lt can be heard...
- "lt can be heard over...

1086
01:56:33,696 --> 01:56:38,565
over noises that bury everything else." "Even...

1087
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:44,229
- "Even...
- "Even when it's not shouting."

1088
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:46,874
"Shouting." "Even when it...

1089
01:56:47,076 --> 01:56:50,944
"Even if it's just a whisper."

1090
01:56:55,685 --> 01:57:01,646
"Even the lowest whisper
can be heard over armies...

1091
01:57:02,858 --> 01:57:04,450
(Silvia) "When...

1092
01:57:06,562 --> 01:57:10,999
- "When...
-.."when it's telling the truth."

1093
01:57:29,752 --> 01:57:32,414
That little boy was my country.

1094
01:58:19,301 --> 01:58:20,893
(Silvia) Hove Vambi...

1095
01:58:23,205 --> 01:58:25,639
..killed by land-mines.

1096
01:58:26,509 --> 01:58:28,409
Alexander Mungoshi...

1097
01:58:29,879 --> 01:58:31,813
Charles Kufomo...

1098
01:58:33,349 --> 01:58:35,442
Ruth Kufomo...

1099
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:40,948
..shot to death defending their home.

1100
01:58:42,992 --> 01:58:44,482
Robert Chenjari...

1101
01:58:45,161 --> 01:58:47,026
Benita Matkudzi...

1102
01:58:48,864 --> 01:58:52,630
.. burned to death during a protest rally.

1103
01:58:53,702 --> 01:58:55,431
Edgar Sakuro...

1104
01:58:56,872 --> 01:58:58,840
Masumi Bamcha...

1105
01:59:00,109 --> 01:59:02,577
John Enkumo...

1106
01:59:02,778 --> 01:59:05,338
Yvon Enkumo...

1107
01:59:05,548 --> 01:59:08,540
- (GA President) Let the record show...
- Steven Gawanda...

1108
01:59:08,751 --> 01:59:12,016
-.. that the Security Council...
- Solo Gawanda...

1109
01:59:12,221 --> 01:59:15,418
-.. has unanimously commanded...
- Steven Shamere...

1110
01:59:15,624 --> 01:59:20,687
-.. that President Zuwanie of Matobo...
- Stambuli Watiku... Esther Tikembu...

1111
01:59:20,896 --> 01:59:26,095
.. be tried at the International Criminal Court
in The Hague

1112
01:59:26,302 --> 01:59:29,100
for crimes against humanity.

1113
01:59:32,041 --> 01:59:34,373
(Silvia 's voice) Simon Broome...

1114
01:59:34,577 --> 01:59:38,673
shot to death in a soccer stadium.

1115
02:00:11,814 --> 02:00:13,748
How did you make out?.

1116
02:00:13,949 --> 02:00:17,146
They said you told them I wasn't a danger.

1117
02:00:17,353 --> 02:00:21,016
- I lied.
- Thank you.

1118
02:00:22,091 --> 02:00:24,582
They didn't believe you.

1119
02:00:26,128 --> 02:00:31,088
They're sending me back.
I wanted to say goodbye.

1120
02:00:32,801 --> 02:00:36,328
It's OK. I'm going home.

1121
02:00:39,708 --> 02:00:41,573
We never...

1122
02:00:41,777 --> 02:00:45,235
I never had time to tell you
how much I miss Africa.

1123
02:00:46,382 --> 02:00:49,840
We never had time for a lot of things.

1124
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:58,248
You don't have anyone left there, do you?.

1125
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:00,826
No, it's where I remember them.

1126
02:01:05,467 --> 02:01:08,061
Ever been to Africa?.

1127
02:01:09,972 --> 02:01:12,202
Lot of airports, no lions.

1128
02:01:19,615 --> 02:01:22,607
- When are you leaving?.
- Tomorrow.

1129
02:01:24,553 --> 02:01:26,145
Wow.

1130
02:01:30,826 --> 02:01:33,795
Hey, look at this. We're not kepéla any more.

1131
02:01:36,332 --> 02:01:38,698
We're on the same side.

1132
02:01:40,769 --> 02:01:44,796
You never know
who you're going to meet, do you?.

1133
02:01:45,007 --> 02:01:46,736
No.

1134
02:01:49,745 --> 02:01:51,975
Will you let me know how you are?.

1135
02:02:01,523 --> 02:02:04,117
You'll always know.

1136
02:02:18,774 --> 02:02:20,708
What was her name?.

1137
02:02:24,947 --> 02:02:27,006
Laurie.

1138
02:02:28,484 --> 02:02:30,281
Keller.

1139
02:02:34,423 --> 02:02:38,189
Killed in an auto accident in Santa Fe...

1140
02:02:39,461 --> 02:02:41,520
..23 days ago.

1141
02:02:49,004 --> 02:02:51,734
(speaking Ku)

1142
02:02:54,143 --> 02:02:56,338
Rest in peace?.

1143
02:02:59,148 --> 02:03:00,911
Close enough.

1144
02:03:01,116 --> 02:03:05,314
