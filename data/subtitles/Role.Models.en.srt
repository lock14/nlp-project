1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,840
Thanks for everything.

2
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Guess what I did
last night.

3
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,240
Dude!

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>- ENCODE + SYNC -
<i>***** CaLLioPE_MoNTEDiaZ *****</i>

5
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,520
Now let's rock
Westside Academy!

6
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,760
<i>Taste the beast!</i>

7
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,000
<i>You can do
anything you want in life</i>

8
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,120
<i>as long as you
stay away from drugs.</i>

9
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,840
<i>Why would a person
use illegal drugs?</i>

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,640
<i>Many reasons.</i>

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,080
<i>Maybe they're trying to fit
in with a new group of friends.</i>

12
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,440
<i>Maybe they're curious.</i>

13
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
<i>Maybe they're just bored.</i>

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,920
<i>But whatever the reason,</i>

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,040
<i>what should you say when
someone offers you drugs?</i>

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,800
<i>Say, "No, thanks.
I'll have a Minotaur. "</i>

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,440
Stay off drugs! Minotaur!

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
<i>Thank you, Minotaur man.</i>

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,080
Hey! Nice cow
outfit, homo.

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Where can I pick one of
those up, the gay zoo?

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,040
Oh, no. It's not a...
It's not a cow.

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
It's a minotaur.

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,280
It's a creature of myth,

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,200
and he got this one out
of your mom's closet.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,920
She let me keep it
after I fucked her.

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,280
Drugs are bad.
Energy drinks, good.

27
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,800
<i>So whenever you'd like to
taste one, help yourselves.</i>

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,440
<i>And for every can sold,
Minotaur will make a donation</i>

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
<i>to the Keep Kids
Off Drugs foundation.</i>

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,160
God, this suit
smells like Tater Tots.

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,520
Yeah, I know what you need.

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,840
Kiss? Are you kidding? No. God.

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,840
I love Kiss.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,000
No one loves Kiss.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,560
Paul Stanley is
sick of Kiss.

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,720
Whoa! Don't dis
the Starchild.

37
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,080
Hey, don't get me
wrong, all right?

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,680
I like to "rock 'n' roll all
night and part of every day!"

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Party every day. "Rock 'n' roll
all night and party every day!"

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,400
I like to rock 'n' roll part
of every day. Party every day.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,840
I usually have errands.
Party.

42
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,320
I can rock 'n' roll from, like,
1:00 to 3:00. You need to party.

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>Hey, guys.
How's it going?</i>

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,720
<i>When someone offers you some
illegal drugs, what do you say?</i>

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,320
<i>You say, "No, thanks.
I'll just have a Minotaur. "</i>

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,880
<i>I've had so many
of these things.</i>

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,560
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

48
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,160
<i>I may wet my pants.
Where's the bathroom?</i>

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,240
Holy shit.

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,400
Dude, this is like
Shrek's piss.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,600
<i>So remember, stay off drugs,
drink Minotaur and above all...</i>

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
Taste the beast!

53
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,680
You know what's
great about this job?

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
You mean,
besides nothing?

55
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,240
We're making
the world a better place.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
How?

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,400
You know, giving the kids an
energy boost to stay off drugs.

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,440
We're selling them nuclear
horse piss for 6 bucks a can.

59
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,240
What an accomplishment.
Feels good, doesn't it?

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,520
Easy to do hung-over.

61
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
I could do
this job forever.

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,280
If I had to do this job forever,
I'd put a bullet in my head.

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
Game face, bro.

64
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,800
Surprise!

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,080
Yeah!

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Got you, man! Got you!

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,480
Happy anniversary!
Did you know?

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,520
No.

69
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
All right.
That was good!

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,240
Oh, my God.
You're here.

71
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,360
Wheeler called me. Hi.

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Thank you for warning me.

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,600
Hey, I tried to tell them
you don't like surprises,

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,000
but they really wanted
to celebrate your milestone.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,560
<i>What's up, mino-tards?</i>

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,160
What's up, Wheeler?

77
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,360
<i>My dick!</i>

78
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
"My dick!"

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,120
<i>Everybody, we're here to
celebrate my best friend, Danny!</i>

80
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
We just work together.
Not "best friend. "

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,960
Be nice.

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,720
<i>Danny's been
working here 10 years!</i>

83
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,280
<i>That's almost
a decade of living the dream.</i>

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
You're the
man, Danny!

85
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,880
<i>I want to grow
old with you, Danny.</i>

86
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,200
<i>Hopefully,
we'll be tasting the beast</i>

87
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,440
<i>for the rest of
our lives together!</i>

88
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah!
All right!

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,760
<i>It's early morning
The sun come out</i>

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,960
<i>Last night was shaking
And pretty loud</i>

91
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,200
This is a nightmare.

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,000
Come on. I took
the afternoon off.

93
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,040
There's cake! Let's
try and enjoy ourselves.

94
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,520
<i>Mitch from Graphics,
take over!</i>

95
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,960
Do it!
Let's go next!

96
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,640
Come on. It'll be fun.
No.

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,680
Why not? Come on.
We'll do a duet!

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,280
Getting up in front
of a group of people

99
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,120
and singing is not my
idea of fun. All right?

100
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,760
It's humiliating.

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,240
<i>With another sin</i>

102
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm gonna sing.

103
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,000
<i>Here I am</i>

104
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,080
<i>Ow!</i>

105
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,960
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,920
Come on, come on, come
on, come on! Yeah, yeah!

107
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,160
<i>Here I am</i>

108
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,560
Come on. Sing it!

109
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,160
<i>Rock you like a hurricane</i>

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,400
Danny?

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,240
What is your problem?

112
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,280
Look, I'm sorry,
all right?

113
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm not Wheeler, happy
in some brainless job,

114
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,320
no goals, no ambition.

115
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,920
Hey, you don't know
how Wheeler feels.

116
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,120
For all you know, he hates
his job as much as you do.

117
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
I love this job!

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,120
Hey, Wheeler!
She's tasting your beast!

119
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
Good morning.
Can I take your order?

120
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,320
Can I get a tall chai?

121
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,800
And a large black coffee.

122
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,760
A what?

123
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,800
Large black coffee.

124
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
<i>Do you mean a venti?</i>

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,960
No, I mean a large.

126
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
<i>He means a venti. Yeah,
the biggest one you've got.</i>

127
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,240
<i>Venti is large.</i>

128
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,440
<i>No. Venti is 20.</i>

129
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
Danny.

130
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Yeah. "Large" is large.
In fact, "tall" is large.

131
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
<i>And grande is
Spanish for large.</i>

132
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
<i>Venti is the only one
that doesn't mean large.</i>

133
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,080
It's also the only
one that's Italian.

134
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,600
Congratulations! You're
stupid in three languages.

135
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,000
<i>Look, dick.
Venti is a large coffee.</i>

136
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,480
Really? Says who?
Fellini?

137
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,880
How much is that?
Here's a 10.

138
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,440
Do you accept lira,
or is it all euros now?

139
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,320
You know what,
just keep the change.

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,320
Jesus, Dan. You know what
they call the sizes here.

141
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,880
You know what, you've been
picking fights with everybody.

142
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,760
The girl at the party...
She said ASAP.

143
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,480
ASAP, I'm sorry.
Huge crime.

144
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,520
It's like "24l7" or "been there,
done that. " You hate that, too.

145
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,680
I don't hate it enough
to let it ruin my day.

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,080
It's getting worse. You
know, man? The sun is shining,

147
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,000
but you have lost the ability
to take any joy in life.

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
I can't stand it anymore!

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,320
You're just
a miserable dick now!

150
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,600
You're mean to everybody!

151
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,080
<i>And, FYI, it's called a
venti because it's 20 ounces!</i>

152
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,000
<i>20! Venti!</i>

153
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,560
Is that true?

154
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,880
She says I take
no joy in life.

155
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,320
I can see that.

156
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
I gotta talk to her.

157
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,440
Forget her, man.

158
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,280
Let me give you a little
motto I live my life by,

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,800
you got to hit
it and quit it.

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,680
No ties, tangle free.

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,960
Nobody tells me what to do.

162
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,920
I go bang,
bang, bang the drum.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
What? That's not a motto.

164
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,760
That's just you
saying a bunch of things.

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,800
You know, Beth's right.
I'm a dick.

166
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,320
Hey, I'm in a rut, just
going from school to school

167
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,880
selling poison to
our nation's youth.

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,960
It's not poison.
It's got juice in it.

169
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,120
You know, I'm 35 years old.

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,200
I got nothing to
show for my life.

171
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
I figured I'd be something,

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
something good,
a professor, engineer.

173
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,600
I don't know.

174
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,840
Figured I'd be
married. I'd...

175
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,400
You know what? We're
making a detour. What?

176
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,560
We're making a detour.
Where?

177
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,920
We're making a detour.
Why?

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,040
Dude, you're too jacked up on
Minotaur. This is a mistake.

179
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,600
It's fine. Look,
I'll be right back.

180
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,880
Hey, we gotta be at the Blue
Valley Middle School by 1:30.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,160
Yep!

182
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
No, I don't want
to plea-bargain.

183
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't do it.

184
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,680
Mr. Garvin, I just don't know what
other options we have, you know,

185
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,040
because they have this clear
videotape of you stealing

186
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
<i>a lot of TVs.
Guys! Go, go, go.</i>

187
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,120
That could be any bald guy.

188
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,320
<i>Look at me. Me, David Garvin,
stealing TVs.</i>

189
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,800
<i>Who would believe it?</i>

190
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,760
That is not me.

191
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,520
Hey, hi.
I need to talk to you.

192
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Danny, I'm with a client,
so we'll talk later.

193
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,880
I can go.
No, no. You stay.

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,880
I'm not going anywhere
until you talk to me.

195
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,960
Excuse me one...

196
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,360
Thank you.
What? Fast.

197
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,400
All right, you were right.

198
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm a dick. I'm a dick!

199
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,000
You're dickish.
Yes, I'm dickish.

200
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,680
I'm a dickish dick, and I'm
in a rut. We're in a rut.

201
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,400
Let's shake things up.
I have an idea.

202
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,760
Let's get married.
I don't have a ring.

203
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,840
Are you serious?

204
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
<i>Mazel tov!
No.</i>

205
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,040
Never mind.
What?

206
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
No.
Why?

207
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,360
Because despite this very well
thought out and romantic proposal,

208
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,600
I'm not that interested in
becoming Mrs. Dick-in-a-rut.

209
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Heard that.
Really?

210
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,440
Did you hear that?
Danny?

211
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,480
Maybe you heard that because
you're 2 feet away from us.

212
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
That's another one I hate.
"Heard that!"

213
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,720
You don't get married
to get out of a rut.

214
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,920
You get married
because you love someone

215
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,440
and you don't want to spend
your life without them.

216
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,920
Who is this guy? Thank you,
Mr. Garvin. He's a thief.

217
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,160
Falsely accused.

218
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,400
Oh, well.
He looks like Phil Collins.

219
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,560
Yeah. I know.

220
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,800
Look, life is hard,
all right?

221
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,280
We've lived together for
seven years... You know what?

222
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,360
Danny, life is hard, and you've
become the hardest part of my life.

223
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,520
I should really go.

224
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,880
No, you sit down.

225
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,080
You know, Danny?

226
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,120
We do need to
shake things up.

227
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,320
I know!
That's what I'm saying!

228
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
I'm moving out.

229
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,400
Wait a minute.
Are you breaking up with me?

230
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,880
Yeah.

231
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,920
Really?

232
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,960
Wow.

233
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,600
Today sucks.

234
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,760
Look, Danny, whenever a door
closes, another opens, okay?

235
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,800
You just have
to look for it.

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,040
And, seriously,
you're gonna get

237
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,040
the most insane
sympathy-rebound pussy.

238
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,520
And this is a good
month for that, too.

239
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,760
I don't want that.

240
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
Look, just keep
it together, bro.

241
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
Okay? We got one
more school.

242
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,320
We go out, we'll have a few
brewskis, we'll talk this over.

243
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,600
Just put your
game face on.

244
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,000
Taste the beast!
Stay off drugs!

245
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,320
Minotaur!

246
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,600
<i>Drugs. Why do
kids take drugs?</i>

247
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
<i>'Cause they're awesome?</i>

248
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,960
<i>No? Maybe they just
understand that life is pain,</i>

249
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,120
<i>and if you smoke something or take
a pill, it'll go away for a while.</i>

250
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,160
<i>I'll drink to that.</i>

251
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
Dude, dude, dude,
dude. Come on.

252
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,240
<i>No, no, no.</i>

253
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,960
<i>People say,
"Embrace life. Enjoy life.</i>

254
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,400
<i>"Just do it!
Live it! Rock it!"</i>

255
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,480
<i>Fuck it,
because life is horrible.</i>

256
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,760
<i>You know, I may not be so
happy-go-lucky, but I'm a realist.</i>

257
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,600
<i>Get ready to have
your dreams dashed, kids,</i>

258
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,800
<i>'cause nothing's
gonna work out</i>

259
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
<i>the way you
think it's going to.</i>

260
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,840
<i>Chin-chin. By the way,
this stuff's poison.</i>

261
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,720
Game face, bro.
Game face.

262
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,560
What part of "game face"
do you not understand?

263
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,600
What the...

264
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,600
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

265
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,960
Dude, I thought we
could park here.

266
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,280
And you thought wrong,
you furry faggot.

267
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,960
Please, just flip
the switch and put it down.

268
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,600
It's too late.
It's already up.

269
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,600
Come on, please.

270
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
Put yourself in my shoes,
would you?

271
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,400
Not my problem.

272
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
Dude, please,
could you just be decent?

273
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,920
I'm having a terrible day.

274
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,840
Well, since you put it that
way, it's still not my problem.

275
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

276
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,160
Hey, man, can I ask
you a question?

277
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,320
Get the fuck out
of the way, asshole!

278
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,480
You want me to move?

279
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,680
Game face, buddy.

280
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,160
Danny?

281
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,040
What's he doing?

282
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,520
He's running.
We're running.

283
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,920
We're running!

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
No, no.

285
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,280
Hey, what are you...
What are you... Get...

286
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm the guy that can't
enjoy life? Wrong!

287
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm gonna enjoy this!
Right!

288
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,320
Wait, what?

289
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

290
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,080
Hey, man,
what you doing?

291
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
Whoa, whoa! Danny!

292
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,680
Hey, man!

293
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,840
Holy shit, man!

294
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,000
Dude!

295
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
<i>Taste the beast!</i>

296
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,000
Stay off drugs.

297
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,800
You guys are fucked.

298
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,360
I told you, you asshole!

299
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,800
Beth?
Yes, Wheeler?

300
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,680
I just want to start by saying
I think you're amazing, okay?

301
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,160
You're, like, beauty
and brains incarnate.

302
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,680
So, FYI, there
you go. Okay?

303
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,120
Now, that's that, so as far as this
goes, I didn't do anything here,

304
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,920
so if you wouldn't mind,
you can clear my name,

305
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and I can just walk
right out of here.

306
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,400
Really? Because according to
this, you were a party to...

307
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,320
A party to,
not the party.

308
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
...reckless endangerment,
destruction of school property,

309
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,040
obstructing a police officer,
attempted grand theft auto,

310
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,240
disturbing the peace,
parking in a no-parking zone.

311
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Did I ever tell
you you're a dick?

312
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,400
Yeah. Earlier.

313
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
And, Danny, they suspended
your license. Did you know that?

314
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,240
Yeah. I figured they
would probably do that.

315
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,600
I mean, did you guys
think this was funny?

316
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,960
You know, if you think about
it, this is kind of your fault.

317
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,120
My... How is
this my fault?

318
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,680
It's your fault because
you just threw it all away,

319
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,120
and I came in here,
I proposed to you...

320
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,640
Your proposal
was bullshit!

321
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,960
But it was real.
It was from the heart!

322
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,680
Shut up! Okay? Shut up!

323
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,360
What's gonna happen?

324
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,240
They wanted to give you 30 days in jail.

325
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,440
What?

326
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,280
But I worked my
magic on the judge,

327
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,840
and instead,
over the next 30 days,

328
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,120
you have to log 150 hours
of community service.

329
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
Community service? What,
we got to clean toilets?

330
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,760
No, you're going
to Sturdy Wings.

331
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,240
It's the judge's
favorite organization.

332
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,480
Yes, Wheeler?

333
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
What the fuck
is Sturdy Wings?

334
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:01,720
<i>Sturdy Wings is
a simple concept.</i>

335
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
<i>Sturdy Wings is
a simple concept.</i>

336
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,840
<i>We bring adults and children
together in a structured format</i>

337
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,600
<i>to enhance the lives
of these children</i>

338
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,960
<i>through
one-on-one friendships.</i>

339
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,040
People ask me,
"Gayle, how did you

340
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,080
"come up with such
a life-altering program?"

341
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
And I tell them I spent a
lot of time alone as a kid.

342
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,720
My father was
a traveling salesman.

343
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,440
My mother, out of
necessity, was a whore.

344
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,240
<i>During adolescence,
I hungered for guidance</i>

345
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,920
<i>from a committed,
caring adult.</i>

346
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,040
<i>In my 20s and 30s, I suffered
through an endless cycle</i>

347
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,160
<i>of failed relationships and
constant feelings of inadequacy.</i>

348
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,640
<i>A mere 12 years ago,
I was a raging alcoholic.</i>

349
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,880
<i>To make matters worse, I
had a massive drug addiction,</i>

350
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,280
no money, no job,
no hope.

351
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,840
<i>But at that moment,
I knew what I had to do.</i>

352
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,040
Used to be
addicted to pills.

353
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,880
Now I'm addicted
to helping.

354
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,120
And when you're
addicted to helping,

355
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,680
you don't need
an intervention.

356
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,560
Because sometimes in life,
everybody needs...

357
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
Sturdy Wings!
Sturdy Wings!

358
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,840
<i>A little lovin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

359
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,840
<i>We need a little love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

360
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,800
<i>A little lovin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

361
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,040
See, that's me?

362
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,280
Okay, then.

363
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
Welcome, everybody.

364
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,560
You know, it's particularly exciting
for me to have a new batch of Bigs

365
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,280
to match up with a new
group of kids, or Littles,

366
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,240
as we call them
here at Sturdy Wings.

367
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,720
I see a familiar face.

368
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,160
Guilty as charged.

369
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,400
I'd already prefer jail.

370
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,760
All right. Let's move
right along here.

371
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,320
Schedule-wise,
you can elect to spend

372
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,960
as much time
with your Little...

373
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,640
Hey.
Or as little time.

374
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
It takes a village.

375
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,800
Hmm?

376
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,600
Hillary Clinton.
I'm sort of into politics.

377
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm sort of engaged.

378
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,800
I sort of have a boner.

379
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,520
Okay.

380
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Got lots of handouts,
information to cover,

381
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,600
so let's get started.

382
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,040
First time with
the program?

383
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,560
Oh, God, really?

384
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,080
Wheeler, switch with me.
No way, dude.

385
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,120
Martin Gary. I can always spot a newbie.

386
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,240
It's my fifth
year with Wings.

387
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,360
I guess Paul McCartney's
got nothing on me, huh?

388
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
<i>Love, take me down
to the streets</i>

389
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
That's not a Wings' song.

390
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Yeah, that's one of
their hits from the '70s.

391
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,720
I'm not sure which one.
It's not a... It's not.

392
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
It isn't?
No.

393
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,960
I think it might be. No, it's
not. Nobody sings that song.

394
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,360
I don't know about that.
I'll have to google it.

395
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,960
That's right, some kids are
allergic to their own sweat.

396
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,640
So probably best to put the
kibosh on physical activity.

397
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,560
Maybe play a boardgame
or tell a knock, knock joke.

398
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,600
Oh!

399
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,640
Martin!

400
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,360
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

401
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,800
Mike Snifferpipits.

402
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,400
Mike Snifferpipits who?

403
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,200
Mike Snifferpipits who? How many
Mike Snifferpipits do you know?

404
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,360
Come on! Let me in.
It's cold out here!

405
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,000
Jeez.

406
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,040
Martin, come on up here.

407
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,120
<i>Let's do
a little dimostrazione.</i>

408
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,400
This...

409
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,400
Ah!

410
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,640
Perfectly acceptable hug
between a Little and a Big.

411
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,880
Ooh, la la!

412
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,280
This is not.

413
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,080
Well, obviously we're not
supposed to butt-fuck these kids.

414
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,640
Well, it looks like
I'm out of handouts.

415
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,720
So why don't we take a little
break, get a cup of joe?

416
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,680
I know I'm gonna put
mine right in here.

417
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,440
And then when you come back, it'll
be time to meet... Drum roll, please.

418
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,160
...your Little!

419
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
I cannot wait
to meet mine.

420
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,880
I'm going to take
them to the zoo,

421
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,720
Because I heard
that the giant panda bear

422
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,280
has a little
baby panda bear,

423
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,720
and there's
just nothing cuter

424
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,240
than a little
baby panda bear...

425
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,360
Yeah, I can't do this.

426
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,880
Danny, stop.

427
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,520
We will get raped in jail.
Do you understand?

428
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,040
What's the point?

429
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,520
I mean, I've got
nothing to give a kid.

430
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,200
If you were a kid, would
you want to hang out with me?

431
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,480
Hey, do you want
to get raped?

432
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,680
Hello, gentlemen.

433
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,040
Hey.

434
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
You probably heard that
out of context. Excuse me?

435
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,320
When I asked my friend Danny
if he wanted to get raped.

436
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,720
I want you both to listen
to me, okay? And listen good.

437
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,280
I know why you're here,
so don't BS a BSer.

438
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Okay? Your "presence"
here, court-ordered.

439
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,120
Why did you put
"presence" in quotes?

440
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,480
Are you implying
that we're not here?

441
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,480
You know, one call
to the judge from me,

442
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,920
and you are in the slammer,
like M.C. Hammer.

443
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,160
Did M.C. Hammer
go to prison?

444
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,600
Yes, he did.

445
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,440
Or he came
extremely close.

446
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm certain he filed for bankruptcy,
so don't BS me right now, okay?

447
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,400
I don't understand.
How are we BSing you?

448
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,320
Exactly. I'm BS-proof.

449
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,960
Here's a couple
of time sheets.

450
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,240
You'll want your little buddies' parents
to sign them after each outing, okay?

451
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,480
And that way, I can use my BS
flyswatter to swat away the flies

452
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,040
that is your BS.

453
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
Okay? Any questions?

454
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,440
Hey, little Littles,
your Bigs are here!

455
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,120
Okay. That's good fun!

456
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,640
Danny, your Little is elsewhere.
Why don't you come with me?

457
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
Oh, man.

458
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,520
I've heard of popcorn in the
face, but this is ridiculous.

459
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,160
Brothers in arms,
follow me!

460
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,000
The evil King Argotron
has us cornered.

461
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,760
My fair lady Esplen,
Goddess of Navalore.

462
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,720
I fight for your honor.

463
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,600
You wish to kiss me?

464
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,000
There's precious
little time.

465
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,680
What the hell.

466
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,400
No! No. More later!
Now I must fight!

467
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,920
Your kid's name is Augie Farks, a
little older than most of the kids.

468
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,880
Oh.

469
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,600
Um, that...

470
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,120
I wasn't really 100% yet.

471
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
Don't judge me
by that move that...

472
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm not gonna get
in trouble, right?

473
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,520
This is just... This is just soft foam
and duct tape. It can't harm anyone.

474
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,560
No worries, my liege.

475
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,680
Okay!

476
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,880
This is Danny. He wants
to be your new friend.

477
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
So I'm gonna let you guys
get to know each other,

478
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,560
and I'll fade into the mist.

479
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,520
How's it going?

480
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,400
That's a nice routine
you worked out.

481
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,280
I hope you weren't
planning on slaying me.

482
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
Wonderful.

483
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,120
Come on, Wheeler. Let's meet
your kid. His name's Ronnie.

484
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
He's one of our youngest.
Single mom, full-time job.

485
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,680
Signed him up about six weeks ago.
Matched him up with eight different Bigs.

486
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,960
No one's lasted
more than a day,

487
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
but I think you're perfect
because you're young, you're fun,

488
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
and you don't
wanna go to prison.

489
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,680
That's scary!

490
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh!

491
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,880
And FYI, you're playing on
this girl's court now, okay?

492
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,680
So you're playing by her
rules. Are you the coach?

493
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,760
I am the coach. I'm the
coach, and I'm the point guard,

494
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,360
I'm the two forwards, the
center, and I'm the other guard.

495
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm the entire
organization.

496
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,680
Hey, there, Ronnie. How you doing
today? Doing a little drawing?

497
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,200
That's cool.

498
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,920
I want you to meet
someone really special.

499
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,240
And I think you two dudes
are gonna become real homeys.

500
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,520
Ronnie, this is Anson.

501
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,000
Wheeler's good.

502
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,320
Whatever.

503
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,200
Hey, big guy.
What you doing here?

504
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,120
What up, Ronnie?
It's good to meet you.

505
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,720
What you
drawing there?

506
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,520
Oh. Beyoncé.
She's smoking!

507
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,040
I don't want to
take my pants off!

508
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,800
What? Whoa, whoa!

509
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,880
All right, Ronnie.
That's enough.

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,160
This bitch tried
to grab my joint!

511
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,480
Language, Ronnie!

512
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,040
My language is English!

513
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,280
And this motherfucker tried
to grab on my hang-down.

514
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,280
I got my own hang-down
to touch, kid.

515
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,040
Honky-ass wanted
a handful of my balls!

516
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,600
Honky? That's racist.

517
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,440
Well, I trust you two will work
this out. I'm not gonna micromanage.

518
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,480
Not my modus operandi.

519
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
I have no idea what I'm
gonna do with this kid.

520
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,760
Me, either. I bet if I suggested a game
of Quidditch, he'd come in his pants.

521
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,000
I've been talking to him for half
an hour. Kid's barely said a word.

522
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,760
Maybe we should just
go to jail. It's 30 days.

523
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,800
Whoa!

524
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,200
I don't know if this is some
kind of joke to you, Danny,

525
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,200
but I actually
like my life, okay?

526
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,800
Now, if I go to jail, I'm
gonna lose my job. Listen.

527
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,960
We go to prison, you're
never gonna get Beth back.

528
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,080
We come home after 30 days, she's
banging her boss. I guarantee it.

529
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,600
Really? She's gonna be
banging Patricia Feingold?

530
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,680
Her boss is a chick?

531
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,960
Oh, Jesus.

532
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,960
Danny, just listen, okay? We're
a team. All right? You and me.

533
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,720
We can do this. We just
got to stick together.

534
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
Fine.
Good.

535
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,920
So, what do you
do with kids?

536
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,800
<i>Hey, kids! We Chip Monks just broke
our vow of silence, and we want to sing!</i>

537
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,720
<i>We are the monks
of chip monk Charlie's</i>

538
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,000
<i>We will give you food to eat</i>

539
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,480
<i>And once it's in our tummies</i>

540
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,440
<i>We will move
our chip monk feet</i>

541
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,640
<i>We are the butts
of Chip Monk ass</i>

542
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
<i>But we've got the ass...</i>

543
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Come on! Sit down!

544
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,240
All right?
Please. Danny.

545
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,760
I like Ronnie's
version better.

546
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,080
I like how it evokes
the concept of ass and butt.

547
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
Okay. Thanks.

548
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,160
Don't throw shit,
Ronnie. Come on.

549
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,560
How many hours
do we have left?

550
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,520
So, do you
like Coca-Cola?

551
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,360
I like the idea of it
more than I actually like it.

552
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,640
Ooh! They got
chicken fingers.

553
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,880
I'm gonna run a train
on these chicken fingers.

554
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,040
I'm just gonna be like...

555
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,080
Let me guess. You're not really rolling
with the ladies in school, are you, Augie?

556
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,280
Oh, no. I'm really good friends with
the school nurse. She's a divorcée.

557
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,480
So, Aug, it's a pretty
interesting cape.

558
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,440
Are you like a
superhero or something?

559
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,080
Yeah, I wish.

560
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,800
No, this is... This is part
of my battle attire for Laire.

561
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,920
What the hell is Laire?

562
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,360
It's this fantasy world
where anything is possible.

563
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,280
One minute you could be
sparring with an elf,

564
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,520
and the next you could be battling
against a troll who wants nothing more

565
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,520
than just to steal your gold
and leave you penniless!

566
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,680
Sounds gay.

567
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,000
No, no.
There's girls there.

568
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,040
Girls can be gay.

569
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,440
If by gay you mean
the old English definition

570
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,600
of "fun, enjoyable and carefree,"
then, yes, it's extremely gay.

571
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,520
I think they meant
the other definition.

572
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,560
I know, but to understand it, you
really have to see it for yourself.

573
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,720
Okay.

574
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,840
Hey, pick us up
in two hours.

575
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,840
Fuck you, Miss Daisy!

576
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,800
So, Augie, why do
they call it Laire?

577
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,280
It's Live Action Interactive
Role-playing Explorers.

578
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,520
We're all divided
into countries,

579
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,040
fighting a never-ending war
to control the realm.

580
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,560
Or until they have to clear
you out for soccer practice.

581
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,160
Oh!

582
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,040
Greetings, nobleman!

583
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,480
Any friend of Blufgan's
is a friend of Kuzzik,

584
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,720
fifth son of Leponius,
earl of Ringor.

585
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,360
Diana has put
her bosom away.

586
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,640
Apollo has lifted his skirt.
The day has been launched.

587
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,400
May I present to you
my vassal, Artonius?

588
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,400
Greetings, friends.

589
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,600
Greetings.

590
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,560
Tell me, Blufgan, art thou
preparing for the Battle Royale?

591
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,440
'Tis a mere month away.

592
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,680
Aye, my lord.

593
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,160
Huzzah, huzzah!

594
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,520
Godspeed, Blufgan,
and all hail Xanthia!

595
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,080
Hail, Xanthia!
Hail, Xanthia!

596
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,520
Rub-a-dub-dub!

597
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,800
What the fuck just
happened there?

598
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,000
They're my kinsmen.

599
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,360
We're all from Xanthia.

600
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,120
We're a smaller country, but
we're no Cacedonia, Danny.

601
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,120
Ow! Don't hit so hard!
Okay.

602
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
Hi, Blufgan.

603
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,600
Hey! Hey, Esplen.

604
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,080
Blufgan! Blufgan!
Blufgan!

605
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
Blufgan!

606
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,240
All right, Gleebo.
One more.

607
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,840
I should have never started
feeding the goddamn elves.

608
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,120
Jesus Christ.

609
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,400
Hey, master handler.

610
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,800
Whoa! Who's that dork?

611
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,240
That's the king.

612
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,280
Well, I should have guessed. Nothing
says royalty like The Burger Hole.

613
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,800
Yeah, he and his lackeys eat
there before every battle.

614
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
His majesty approaches.
Oh, crap!

615
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,320
His royalty approaches!

616
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,880
Long live the king.

617
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,320
What are you doing?

618
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,080
You have to kneel
before the king.

619
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,480
Bow down, little girl. Little
girl, bow down, bow down.

620
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,600
Why?

621
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,120
Because he's the king.
I beg you!

622
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,360
No.

623
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
Damn it.

624
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,200
Hey, pull over to the
mini-mart and get me some OJ,

625
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,200
and not that
from-concentrate shit.

626
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,520
Would it kill you
to say please?

627
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,120
It might.

628
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,760
"Concentrate. Not from
concentrate. Pulp. Low pulp.

629
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,320
"Lots of pulp. "

630
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,560
Well, well, well.

631
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,120
Hey. Fancy meeting you here.
What, are you stalking me?

632
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,760
Had to get my bagel-dog
fix. So how's little Ronnie?

633
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,800
Oh, you were right about us
being a great match. Yeah.

634
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,960
You know, like at Christmas when you
get a gift? That's what Ronnie is.

635
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,400
A gift. I love him so much.

636
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,640
Wow. Well,
that's very nice.

637
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,560
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gots to get my Slurpee on.

638
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,840
Well, watch this though first.

639
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,360
Look at that.
What does that look like?

640
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,640
Okay.

641
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Open the door, Ronnie.

642
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,200
You forgot to say "please. "

643
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,600
Please open the door,
or I'll pour your juice out.

644
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,480
I don't drink
juice, biatch!

645
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,320
Come on. Hey. Ronnie.

646
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,280
Oh, no. Don't turn that
engine on. I swear to God...

647
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,520
Okay. Okay.
Joke's over, buddy.

648
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,160
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

649
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

650
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,440
Good one! Good one, Ronnie!
Now open the fucking door!

651
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,360
Ronnie! What are you doing?

652
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,720
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude!

653
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,240
What are you doing?

654
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Baby! Yeah!

655
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,760
Don't you run me over!

656
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,040
Oh, no!

657
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,600
Ouch! Watch it!

658
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,080
Hey!

659
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,920
Oh, yeah. So good.
Good times.

660
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,400
You're on
thin ice, buddy.

661
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,640
Then quit.

662
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,120
I never quit.

663
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,080
Give me my
damn juice.

664
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,240
Oh, this juice?
Yeah, that juice.

665
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,680
Fucking asshole.

666
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,080
Punk bitch.

667
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,080
The lad had seasoned his mutton
with wine berry and not mead!

668
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,000
The lad had seasoned his mutton
with wine berry and not mead!

669
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Hey, did you see that spell of
unbreakable madness I casted on those orcs?

670
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,920
I don't think so.

671
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,640
The length of a moon,
hence "honeymoon. "

672
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,160
Eight hours down,
142 to go.

673
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,880
This sucks ass.

674
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,920
Dude, I just spent the
afternoon in Middle-earth

675
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,360
with glee-glop and the
floopty-doos, all right?

676
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Give me a fucking break.

677
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,840
I got fucking carjacked.

678
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,280
Yeah? Well, I got dumped.

679
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,760
You deserved it!

680
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,200
I hate your face.

681
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,360
I hate your face.

682
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,640
Ronnie! Ronnie!
Take the wheel!

683
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,800
Yeah.
What are you doing?

684
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
That is not safe!
He can't drive!

685
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,560
This is unsafe.

686
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,840
Okay, stop! Stop! Okay!

687
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,400
What the fuck?
I'm driving! What...

688
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Oh, my God!

689
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,000
Nice. Look what
you started.

690
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,480
Happy now?
I'm gonna kill you!

691
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,120
What did I do?

692
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,280
So I guess I'll pick you
up tomorrow around 9:00?

693
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,880
Uh, could we make it 10:00?

694
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,440
Kid, you wanna spend
some hours together or not?

695
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,480
Dude, if I'm gonna have to chauffeur
your asses around, let's make it 10:00.

696
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Yeah.

697
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,040
Hey, Danny, you wanna
come see my turtle?

698
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,480
I'm fine.

699
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,400
Of course he
has a turtle.

700
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,200
See you tomorrow, Ronnie.

701
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,600
Fuck you, Anson!

702
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Never gets old.

703
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,960
Wait, wait, wait.

704
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,360
You bitch!

705
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,520
Oh, my God.
She's moving out.

706
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
Dude, that's harsh.

707
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,480
Shit.

708
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,720
Wow, you weren't
kidding around.

709
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,040
Yeah, I'm sorry.

710
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,000
I wanted to be gone
by the time you got home.

711
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,920
No, it's all right.
This is better, you know.

712
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,080
Now we get to share the
moment with Wheeler and...

713
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,360
Becca and Sarah.

714
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,600
Yeah, and Becca
and Sarah.

715
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,560
Who you've met,
like, 127 times.

716
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,440
I know.
Keys.

717
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,160
Beth, come on.
You don't have to do this.

718
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,960
I left you the Crock-Pot.

719
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,160
I know you like chili.

720
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,400
I know it's really hard for you right
now, but I just want you to know that

721
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,040
when you love something,
you set it free,

722
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,040
and if it's meant
to be, you just...

723
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,680
You take it back,
and it comes...

724
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,520
Yeah, I know where
you're going with it.

725
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,440
Yeah, and if she doesn't come back, I'd
go for that friend of hers in the sweater.

726
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,440
I know she's a few pounds overweight,
but, you know, in my experience,

727
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,520
it's the bigger ones that
do way more stuff.

728
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,680
Good talk, Wheeler.

729
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,320
Pick you up at 10:00.

730
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,480
Hi, Ronnie.

731
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,040
How are you today?
What are you doing here?

732
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,400
I told you I'd pick
you up at 10:00, right?

733
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,720
But I thought
you'd pussy out.

734
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,000
Well, you see? It's wonderful. We're
learning so much about each other.

735
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,120
Hey! You must be Wheeler.

736
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm Karen.
Hi, Karen.

737
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,680
Wow, you look way too young
to be Ronnie's mother.

738
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,080
What are you,
the babysitter?

739
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
You're funny.

740
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,320
You're gonna need that sense of humor
if you're gonna keep up with my son.

741
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,040
It's about time Sturdy Wings
found someone who could.

742
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,040
Yeah, well, I think that
Ronnie's a great little dude.

743
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,680
"A great little dude"?
You're cute.

744
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,320
You ready, pal?

745
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,080
I ain't your pal, vanilla.

746
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,520
Karen, would you mind
signing my hours sheet?

747
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,120
Sure.
Great.

748
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,560
Well.

749
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,120
All right.
You boys have fun.

750
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
His idea of fun is a
fucking pottery class, yo.

751
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,160
Hey. Hey, hey. Watch
your mouth, little man.

752
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,920
I love you.

753
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,120
I love you, too.

754
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,840
I got shotgun!

755
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

756
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,200
Stop. Who are you?
What do you want?

757
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,200
I'm Danny from Sturdy Wings.
I'm here for Augie.

758
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,400
Oh. I'm sorry. Augie, right.
He'll be out in a minute.

759
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,840
Let me ask you something,

760
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,440
because you're one of these guys
that's good with kids, right?

761
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,360
Yeah. Totally.

762
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,040
'Cause, the kid, man,
I don't get it.

763
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,040
He's into dragons
and fairies

764
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,520
and, you know, hoboes.

765
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,640
Right.

766
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,600
So, I mean, what am I
supposed to say to him?

767
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah. I don't know. I don't...

768
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,520
Hey, but while I've got you
here in my personal space,

769
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,160
I was wondering if you could maybe
sign off on my hours from yesterday.

770
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,160
Oh, no, I don't...
I'm not the kid's parent.

771
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,200
No, that's... Parental signatures
are mama's department. One second.

772
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,560
Lynette! Augie's little buddy's
here. He needs your signature.

773
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,080
Oh! Hi!
Hi.

774
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm Lynette.
I'm Danny.

775
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,120
So good to meet you.
You, too.

776
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,200
I was wondering if you could maybe
sign my hours sheet from yesterday.

777
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
Sure!

778
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,560
You know, we are so thrilled that you are
gonna be spending some time with Augie,

779
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,600
because, you know,
just how he is.

780
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,800
How is he?

781
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,800
I'm just glad you're gonna be getting
him out of his own little world a bit.

782
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,640
It's like, "Get out of here!
Leave home!"

783
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Hey, why don't you come over
for dinner on Saturday night,

784
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
and we can get to know you
a little bit better?

785
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't think so. It's not you.
I hate having dinner with people.

786
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,160
Hey, Augie, ready to...

787
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah.

788
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,840
I think
they're over here.

789
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm disappointed. This
isn't gonna hurt anybody.

790
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,000
So, your parents... Wow.

791
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,800
Jim is not my dad.

792
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,280
Okay. Well, that's
probably good.

793
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,360
Hey, hey, Odeon. Make
way for King Argotron!

794
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,760
Dude.

795
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,960
Bow as your daughter does.

796
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,520
Xanthians.

797
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,400
Why bother?

798
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,760
Good one, sir.

799
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,360
Man, why do you
bow for that guy?

800
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,800
Because he's the king, and
he rules the entire realm.

801
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,560
He rules the entire realm?
Yeah.

802
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,760
<i>My bad. Is that when he is or
isn't whacking it to The Sims?</i>

803
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,240
You know, Augie, maybe you should
think about losing the cape.

804
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,960
At least in public.

805
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,520
People tend to avoid
people in capes.

806
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,800
I know that's not
the case here.

807
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,280
Look at these people.

808
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,120
I like these people.
No, I know.

809
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,560
But, you know, this isn't
reality. It's not the real world.

810
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,960
I know that, but in this
world, I don't have to be me.

811
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm stuck again!

812
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,400
Well, looks like maybe one of
your people could use a hand.

813
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,240
Help! Help! Help!
Her, I don't like.

814
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,600
Okay. This is my place.

815
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,480
Shit hole.

816
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,240
Look, kid, you're obviously not
a big fan of me, and that's okay,

817
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,000
but I think there's
something to be gained

818
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,040
from us spending 139
more hours together.

819
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,960
Yeah.

820
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
You know, my dad left me
when I was young,

821
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,680
so I know it sucks,

822
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,880
but what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

823
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,560
Says the punk living
in the shit hole.

824
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,160
Who are these clowns?

825
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,200
Kiss?

826
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,560
You don't know who Kiss is?

827
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,080
No. Never heard of them.

828
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,320
They look like
idiots to me.

829
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,400
No, no, no, dude.

830
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,440
These are four of the
smartest guys who ever lived.

831
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,680
They're these Jewish guys
that grew up in New York,

832
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,800
and they put on guitars
and makeup to get girls,

833
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,520
and all of their songs
are about fucking!

834
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm listening.

835
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,280
<i>Seriously, this song is called Love
Gun, and it's about Paul Stanley's dick</i>

836
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,840
and how this girl's gonna
get some of his dick!

837
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,200
Cool.

838
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,600
I didn't know Jews
could sing like that.

839
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,640
No. No. They couldn't at the time.
That's why they had to dress like clowns.

840
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,960
This got them girls?

841
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,360
Get this! They've been getting
pussy nonstop for 30 years!

842
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,520
They're probably fucking right
now, and they're old dudes!

843
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,280
They put makeup on,
and it's all good!

844
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,480
No shit?

845
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,160
<i>You pull the trigger of my</i>

846
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,440
<i>Love gun</i>

847
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,680
You see, Ronnie?
His dick is the gun!

848
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,360
<i>Love gun</i>

849
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,280
<i>Love gun</i>

850
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,280
<i>Love gun</i>

851
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,000
Okay, we logged 14
hours this weekend.

852
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,440
That's not gonna
be enough.

853
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,520
Somehow we gotta get them
on the weekdays, too.

854
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,520
Hey, we could pretend to be their
uncles, pull them out of school.

855
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,000
That just sounds
kind of creepy.

856
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,240
Yeah, I guess.

857
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,880
Hey! Sexy like a
chocolate strawberry.

858
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,680
What's her problem?

859
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
I don't know.

860
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,600
I mean, you laid that
genius line on her.

861
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,040
I can't believe she
didn't take your bait.

862
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,320
I know, right?

863
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,560
Well, well, well.

864
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,120
If it isn't Mr. Bullshit
and Dr. I'm-full-of-shit.

865
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,320
In what way
are we full of shit?

866
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,840
Which one of us
has the Ph. D?

867
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,920
So how was your first
weekend with the boys?

868
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,560
It was great. We did 14 hours.
Will you sign our sheets?

869
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,200
Maybe give us a few more, just
for kicks? Round it up to 50?

870
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,920
Don't you sass me.

871
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,320
What, do you think I'm a pushover? You
know what I used to eat for breakfast?

872
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,600
Cocaine.

873
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,640
You know what I
used to eat for lunch?

874
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,240
Cocaine.

875
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,800
What'd you have for
dinner? Was it cocaine?

876
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,640
I will sign your sheets, but you need to
know I am not here to service your hours.

877
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,280
I'm here to service
these young boys.

878
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,840
Do you think I give a shit
if you guys go to prison?

879
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,840
I've been to prison. I have.

880
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,680
I've been to prison.

881
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,680
A prison of drugs, alcohol
and sick thoughts.

882
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,040
I used to have sick thoughts.

883
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
So don't you come in here,

884
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
preaching to me about hours

885
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,000
when you're standing over there,
and you're standing over there,

886
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,000
and I don't know
which way is up!

887
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,360
Um...
Should we come back?

888
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,600
We can come back.
Yeah.

889
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,080
Come here.

890
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,520
We're having an overnight camping
trip, Big Bear this weekend.

891
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,440
I suggest that you ask
your Littles to go with you.

892
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,280
Maybe worry a little bit about them
and not so much about your hours.

893
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,200
Overnight?
That's great. Sign us up.

894
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,800
And, fellas,
will you do me a favor?

895
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
Next time you
want to bullshit me,

896
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,240
bullshit each
other instead, okay?

897
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,200
See how that feels.

898
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,560
Okay.
Yep.

899
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,160
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

900
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
All right.

901
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,240
I hate camping.

902
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,680
You could use a little
dose of the outdoors.

903
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,960
Camping blows. It's dirty, and
I don't like sleeping on rocks.

904
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,880
Bring some Ambien.
You'll sleep like a baby.

905
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,680
There's always a guy with an acoustic guitar
that doesn't quite know how to play it.

906
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,000
<i>Kumbaya, my...</i>

907
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,040
Wait. I know it.

908
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,080
<i>Kumbaya</i>

909
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,440
You know.
Wait. I know it. Wait.

910
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,200
<i>Kumbaya, my Lord</i>

911
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,480
No. Wait.
Oh, yeah, I got it.

912
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,560
This is it.

913
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,520
I think that's got it.

914
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,480
God damn it, Ronnie!

915
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,160
What? 'Cause I'm black,
you think I did it?

916
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,240
No, 'cause you did it
is why I think you did it.

917
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,840
Let me tell you something. I am
not your Big, and I'll hit you.

918
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,880
I will hit a child.

919
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,000
I've never done that before,
but I will punch you in the face.

920
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,320
Let's dance,
Ben Affleck!

921
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,800
Ronnie! Leave him alone.

922
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,840
Fine!

923
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,760
But I'm watching
you, Daredevil.

924
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,680
Looks like you guys
could use a hand up here.

925
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,920
Come on, man!
Just having some fun.

926
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,360
Let's take a hike.
Thank you.

927
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,160
Don't worry. Once the little ones are
asleep, I'll break out the PG stuff.

928
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,680
<i>Kumbaya, huh?</i>

929
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,960
You don't happen to
know any Wings, do you?

930
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,320
Wings? Yeah.

931
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,560
<i>Love, take me down
to the streets</i>

932
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah!

933
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,640
Man! She got some
boobies on her!

934
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,240
You sure do like
boobies, Ronnie.

935
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
I sure do.

936
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,000
Sometimes I call myself
the Booby Watcher.

937
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>Even got my own comic book.
Adventures of the Booby Watcher.</i>

938
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,840
Okay. You know, I got
a theory about boobies.

939
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,240
Really?
Yeah.

940
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,240
You see, there are as many women
as there are men on this planet.

941
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
True that, true that.

942
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,800
And every woman has two
boobs, for the most part.

943
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,040
So therefore, there's twice
as many boobs as there are men.

944
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,000
We're outnumbered,
and it's overwhelming.

945
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,320
We're powerless.
We have to accept it.

946
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,840
I like your take
on boobies.

947
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,200
And I like boobies.

948
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,760
Kid, you got a lot to learn.

949
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,880
I know what I'm doing.
Really?

950
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,480
So you're aware that you've
committed one of the most

951
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,480
common rookie
boob-watching errors?

952
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,200
What you mean?

953
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Never stare at
the boobies, kid.

954
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,920
Yeah, once you get caught,
the game's over.

955
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,880
But how?
It's called training.

956
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,400
You know, being aware
without drawing attention.

957
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,080
You don't think I've noticed the
34-C's in the camouflage tank top

958
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,800
setting up the tent
directly to the left of us?

959
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,160
How about those twin cannons hiking up
the mountain ridge 50 yards due west?

960
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,440
Or the ridge itself?

961
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,840
Round mounds of
grass shaped like...

962
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,560
Boobies!

963
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,600
Don't look over there.
Look here.

964
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,760
Yeah, focus.
You'll get it.

965
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,000
Too bad old Sweeny herself
couldn't come up here for this trip.

966
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,120
That would have
been fun, huh?

967
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,280
Yeah. A real blast.

968
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,880
Yeah, she probably just
had to hold down the fort.

969
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,760
You got a thing
for Sweeny, Martin?

970
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,880
Sweeney? Me? No. Now
that is a knee slapper.

971
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,520
Your erection is showing.

972
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,640
What?

973
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,000
You okay?

974
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,080
Nature.

975
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,760
Did you know that bald eagles are known
to engage in a bizarre mating ritual

976
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,360
where two eagles fly upwards,
lock talons,

977
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,520
then fall towards the earth
while rotating,

978
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
separating moments before
they crash into the ground,

979
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,520
if, and only if, they
consummate their bird fuck?

980
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,880
If they don't, they're willing
to accept death by hard ground.

981
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,360
It's the ultimate race
against the clock.

982
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,720
Why are you
telling me this?

983
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,320
Why would I not?

984
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,600
Hi, Danny.

985
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,600
I forgot to tell you,
they'll be telling

986
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Ghost stories later.

987
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,880
You should stop by.

988
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,320
And as the barn door
creaked open, ever so slowly,

989
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,240
standing there with
the moon at his back

990
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,920
and holding the severed head of the
pediatrician's mother in his hand,

991
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,720
was Philip,

992
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,240
the pizza delivery boy

993
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,600
from when they ordered pizza
at the beginning of the story!

994
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,520
Come on, you guys!

995
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,880
All right. Whatever!
Hey, come here.

996
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,360
You guys
are unscareable.

997
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,520
Think you can do better? Who's
got a better story? Come on.

998
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,800
You guys are so smart. Who's
got a scarier story than me?

999
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,720
Yes?
So what's up?

1000
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,920
I don't know.
What's up with you?

1001
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,480
I know you're engaged.
I haven't forgotten.

1002
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,520
Uh-huh.

1003
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,760
So what's this?

1004
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,800
Ooh.

1005
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,120
Those are my testicles.

1006
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,320
Yeah.

1007
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Listen, I have an
arrangement with my fiancé.

1008
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,760
I'm completely faithful to him within
the area codes of greater Los Angeles.

1009
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,680
Out here, I'm just another
woman who's ready to cheat.

1010
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,480
Give me two minutes.

1011
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,240
How about you, Daniel?
You think you can top it?

1012
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,840
It's Danny.
Oh.

1013
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,960
<i>Oh, Danny boy
The Danny boys are Danny boys</i>

1014
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,160
Come on, man! We're on pins
and needles. Give us a story.

1015
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
Okay, I've got a really
good horror story,

1016
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,400
and it's particularly
terrifying because it's true.

1017
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,360
Oh, a true story!

1018
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,160
In countries all over the
world, including our own,

1019
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,840
children, many
of them just like you,

1020
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,040
are abducted and sold

1021
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,800
into the world of
underground sex trafficking.

1022
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
What is he saying?
Okay!

1023
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,640
I'm gonna stop you there, Danny
boy. That is a scary story.

1024
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,560
Story time is over! Everybody,
let's break into our groups.

1025
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,120
Group A, come with me for
Martin's midnight mystery hike.

1026
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,320
And group B, go with Duane.
What you got on tap, Duane?

1027
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,000
We are gonna make some
s'mores using white chocolate.

1028
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,040
Oh.

1029
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,200
Well, I'm not sure I agree with
that, but to each their own.

1030
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,320
Hey, hey, Danny.
Is this all your Ambien?

1031
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,360
Yeah.

1032
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,520
Okay, 'cause Connie
and I are gonna take some,

1033
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,280
and then we're gonna stay up
as late as we can,

1034
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,960
because if you fight
the urge to go to sleep,

1035
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,240
things start to get all trippy,
and then we're gonna fuck.

1036
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,360
Connie who's engaged.

1037
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,520
Oh, yeah.

1038
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,280
You know what? Don't worry about
it. We'll make do with three each.

1039
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,160
Fight it. Come on.
Stay awake.

1040
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,680
You know, a lot of people don't
realize that bushes, just like flowers,

1041
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,920
emit a wonderful aroma,
especially at night.

1042
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,520
Who wants to sniff
this bush?

1043
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,720
So Ronnie's out on
some kind of hike.

1044
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,840
Where's Wheeler?

1045
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,120
He's having sex
with a married lady.

1046
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,160
Oh.

1047
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,040
Are you sewing?
Yeah.

1048
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,640
This is my country's
emblem.

1049
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,720
Do you think we can speak
in private for a second?

1050
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,800
Yeah. Yeah.

1051
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,520
I already talked to Kuzzik
and Artonius,

1052
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:48,440
and we would like to officially invite
you to be a soldier in the Xanthian army.

1053
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,960
Well, that's very kind of you, but
I would like to respectfully decline.

1054
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,120
I'm kind of a pacifist.

1055
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,120
I don't really believe
in imaginary bloodshed.

1056
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,160
But there's room in Laire
for all belief systems.

1057
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,720
Even early barbaric
modalities have their place.

1058
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,240
Augie, look, you're
a good kid. I like you,

1059
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,680
but I'm not really into
the whole buddy-buddy,

1060
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,000
let's-go-do-stuff-together
kind of thing.

1061
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,240
Well, why are you here?

1062
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,600
It's court-ordered.

1063
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,000
What did you do?

1064
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,520
I just had one of those days
where you wake up and say,

1065
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,480
"Where did the last
10 years of my life go?"

1066
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,640
I asked my girlfriend
to marry me out of impulse.

1067
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,720
She dumped me.

1068
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,680
And then I ran a truck that looks
like a bull into a statue of a horse.

1069
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,040
I'm not here by choice
either, by the way.

1070
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,160
No?

1071
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,880
My guidance counselor
signed me up.

1072
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,600
Really?
Yeah.

1073
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,080
Said anyone who wears a cape and
has a sword should have more friends.

1074
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,880
Whoop-dee-doo, right?

1075
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,240
So both of us don't
want to be here.

1076
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,560
No.

1077
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,720
Well, we got that in common.

1078
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,520
So do you have
a girlfriend?

1079
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,720
No. What?

1080
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Why would you ask...
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

1081
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,800
But what about that girl you're always
looking at, with the cap and the...

1082
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,720
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1083
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,120
Come on!
Don't bullshit me.

1084
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,880
You're always
looking at her.

1085
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,400
You mean Esplen,
the Goddess of Navalore?

1086
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,480
I don't know. Probably.

1087
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,560
Her name's Sarah.

1088
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,720
Sarah.

1089
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,600
Ah, Sarah.

1090
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,960
You ever talk to her?

1091
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,080
No.

1092
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,720
I've killed her a couple of times in
battle, but that's not really anything.

1093
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,720
Talk to her.

1094
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,040
No, I can't talk to her.

1095
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,840
Romance her. Give her that
patch of yours. She'll love it.

1096
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
No, I can't give her this.

1097
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,160
She'll be flattered!
Why not?

1098
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,920
I made it for you.

1099
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,160
You made that for me?

1100
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,280
Yeah.

1101
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,160
Great. Now I gotta do it.

1102
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,600
Yeah, that kind
of was my plan.

1103
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,160
That was so low, dude.

1104
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,360
No. Come on, Connie.
Stay awake.

1105
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,600
Fuck.

1106
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,440
I gotta pee.

1107
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,320
Yep.

1108
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,360
Hey! Martin!

1109
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,440
Okay.

1110
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,480
What are you
doing out here?

1111
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,040
I'm just doing my
perimeter check.

1112
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,400
Hey, did you know that
dinosaurs are not extinct?

1113
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,880
Because birds are dinosaurs,
and they're everywhere.

1114
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,040
Okay!

1115
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,440
Now, all right.

1116
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,080
I gotta pee.
I really gotta pee.

1117
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,880
Look at that.

1118
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,560
Yo, Wheeler!
You in there?

1119
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,320
Oh, my God.

1120
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,080
Dude.
Nice, man.

1121
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,680
Oh, boy.

1122
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,600
This is a classic case
of guy on the ground.

1123
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,960
I'm sorry.
I don't care.

1124
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,080
Okay.

1125
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,160
So I heard there was
some sex on the trip

1126
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,880
and some drugs, too.

1127
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,040
Only thing missing
was rock 'n' roll.

1128
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,000
What was Danny doing
with those Ambiens?

1129
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,400
He has trouble sleeping
outdoors.

1130
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,440
How did Wheeler come to be
naked in the center of camp?

1131
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,760
He was sleepwalking.

1132
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,680
Danny ever offer you drugs?
Well...

1133
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,400
Answer me.
No, ma'am.

1134
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,000
Did Wheeler ever
expose himself to you?

1135
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,280
Hell no!

1136
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,000
Fellows? These young gentlemen
here have decided your fates.

1137
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,760
If it was up to me, I'd lock you both
up, but the boys are saying you're okay.

1138
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,920
This is your last chance.
Start acting like Bigs.

1139
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,400
Thanks, guys.

1140
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,960
<i>Suck it, Reindeer Games!</i>

1141
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,160
I'm not Ben Affleck.

1142
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,080
You white?
Then you Ben Affleck.

1143
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,880
Right, Wheeler?
Yeah. You are white.

1144
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,400
That's true,
I am white.

1145
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,680
Let's go.

1146
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,240
Ready to go?

1147
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,880
Yeah. I'm ready. All right.

1148
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,080
Excellent!

1149
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,760
You are going down!

1150
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,960
Don't you mess
with my dark arts.

1151
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,080
You shall be slain.

1152
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,960
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

1153
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,400
Fuck my cock! Sorry.

1154
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,120
I have a question, Wheeler. Yes, JJ.

1155
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,040
How many dates do you have to go out
with a girl before you get to touch her...

1156
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,560
Boobs?
Yeah.

1157
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,320
Good question.

1158
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,320
So you get
hit in the arm,

1159
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,920
you lose your arm.
Yes.

1160
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,440
You gotta put it behind
you, like this.

1161
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,440
You get hit in the leg,
you lose the leg.

1162
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,480
See you.

1163
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,760
So you gotta hop.

1164
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,000
You can't use it.
You gotta hop around?

1165
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,240
Yeah.
Yeah, you gotta hop.

1166
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,720
And if you get hit in
the chest, then you're...

1167
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,040
Lifestyle you chose

1168
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,040
could lead to dying sad and alone? What?

1169
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,160
What about STDs? No.
Herpes?

1170
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,720
Gonorrhea? At the very
least, crabs. What the hell?

1171
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,800
I don't have crabs. What have
you been telling them, Ronnie?

1172
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,320
You got crabs.

1173
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,880
Hi.

1174
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,920
Come on, whitey, dance! Break
it on down! Get it funky!

1175
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
He's out.

1176
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,440
Thank you.
Yep.

1177
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,160
Call her. Sweep
her off her feet.

1178
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,360
It's not that easy, Augie.

1179
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,920
Just let her know
how you feel.

1180
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,960
Give her one call.

1181
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,200
All right. I'II...

1182
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,840
Just get off my back.

1183
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,480
Did you know in
the 14th century that

1184
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,320
knights used to write love songs
and poems for the women they loved,

1185
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,600
even if she was married?

1186
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,960
No, I didn't know that.

1187
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,040
Well, there you go.

1188
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,400
It's her voice mail.

1189
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,280
Hey, Beth. How's it going? It's me.

1190
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,480
Tell her her hair is like
1,000 suns. Look, I...

1191
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,600
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to get together.

1192
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,040
I know there's a lot
of stuff I'd like to say.

1193
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,240
Whispering eye.

1194
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,000
So, if you get a chance,
give me a call back and...

1195
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,080
You long for her
whispering eye. We can...

1196
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,480
We can see each other.

1197
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,480
I'd love to see you.

1198
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,600
And her whispering eye.

1199
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,600
And your whispering eye.

1200
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,720
All right. Bye.

1201
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,600
Whispering eye?

1202
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,800
It means vagina.

1203
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,000
It means vagina.

1204
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,160
That's a classy
move, man.

1205
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,400
It means vagina.

1206
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,680
Yeah. Get your whispering
eye in the cab, Augie.

1207
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,280
Vagina!

1208
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Hey.

1209
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
Hi.

1210
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,560
Thanks for meeting me.

1211
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,440
<i>I got you a venti chai,</i>

1212
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,840
which is what they call
a large here, which I love.

1213
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
Wow.

1214
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,520
There's a transformation.

1215
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,680
Yes, well, you know, I've been doing
this community service for almost a month,

1216
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,600
and I really feel as if it's given
me some perspective on things.

1217
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,560
Well, that's great.
I hope that's true, Danny.

1218
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,360
So let's get married.

1219
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,600
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.
Wait.

1220
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,960
Danny, you are not taking
this breakup seriously.

1221
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,120
Yeah, because
I don't want it.

1222
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,880
Do you really think
I wanted this?

1223
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,440
Look. Hey. This is us.

1224
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,160
This is not us.

1225
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,320
We have not been us in a
while, because you are not you.

1226
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,080
Danny, you're not happy.

1227
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,200
I've been with you seven years, and
it's been getting progressively worse.

1228
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,960
And it makes me feel bad about
me that I can't make you happier.

1229
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,040
Where am I gonna find a girl who
hates all the same things I do?

1230
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,480
You're so romantic.

1231
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,880
Hey. Hey.

1232
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,920
"You complete me. "

1233
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,520
"You had me at 'hello. "'
Oh, God. Danny.

1234
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,600
Come on, Beth.
You're not...

1235
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,960
You're not hearing
what I'm saying to you.

1236
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,640
"I am just a girl standing in front
of a boy, telling her to love her. "

1237
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,760
You don't even
know that one.

1238
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,040
Hey. Come on.

1239
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,760
"Who you gonna call?"

1240
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,920
"Ghost Busters. "
Okay. You know what?

1241
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,960
No. I am committing to this breakup.
This is the best thing for us.

1242
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,840
You can call me if you
need legal advice.

1243
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,760
Come on! Let's kill
some Cacedonians!

1244
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,040
And I got a little
something-something for you to wear.

1245
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,480
Yeah, I'm not
gonna wear this.

1246
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,640
No?

1247
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,520
Soon enough.
Soon enough you'll want it.

1248
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,600
Yeah.

1249
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,320
Yo, Wheeler. What up, dog? You
scoundrel. What are you doing, man?

1250
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,720
Yo, Hogan's having another
party tonight, man. You gotta go.

1251
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,600
There's gonna be a lot of
sweet-ass pussy there, girl pussy.

1252
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,760
Ooh! Uh...

1253
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,240
Thanks for the offer.
Maybe some other time.

1254
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,360
You're the king, Wheeler.
You're the king.

1255
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,360
Dude, don't give up that
sweet-ass pussy on my account.

1256
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,560
I'll go with you.

1257
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,960
Okay. If you say so.

1258
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,680
All right.
You're my PIC, Wheeler.

1259
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,600
What's a PIC?
Partner in crime.

1260
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,080
You're my PIC. Just don't
cock-block me tonight.

1261
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,880
Wouldn't dream of it.
We'll have a great time.

1262
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,640
We'll go to the party,
we'll get some zah,

1263
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,680
play some Xbox.

1264
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,880
Damn straight.

1265
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Countrymen, smell
the battle in the air!

1266
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,280
Esplen,
Goddess of Navalore.

1267
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,640
Venus herself would be jealous.
Braman, good to see you.

1268
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,360
Good morrow, sir!
Good morrow to you.

1269
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,520
Good morning.

1270
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,560
Keep your blades sharp
but your wits sharper.

1271
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,520
Ah! Gleebo, look at you.
A visage.

1272
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,720
Men, get ready to
dance with swords!

1273
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,880
Alack and allay! What lovely vassal
has Mercury delivered upon us today

1274
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,480
and in such strange
and frightful attire?

1275
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,680
Let us thank the gods

1276
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,920
for sending us such a brave
and valiant warrior to Xanthia.

1277
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
All hail Lunesta.

1278
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,360
Hail, Lunesta!

1279
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,920
How's it going?
Lunesta?

1280
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,720
Isn't that a sleeping pill?

1281
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,760
Yeah. It's 'cause I send my enemies
to their eternal resting place.

1282
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,040
"To sleep,
perchance to dream. "

1283
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,400
Well, welcome, Lunesta.
We bid you good battle.

1284
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,760
Prepare to have your
worldview rocked.

1285
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,160
Let's do this.

1286
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,680
Let's do this,
we shall!

1287
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,760
The battle begins!

1288
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,280
Turn and fight, coward!

1289
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,760
You'll never catch me!

1290
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,080
What have you got?

1291
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,080
The Cacedonians have
our kinsmen surrounded.

1292
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,120
Leave them for Davith.

1293
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,600
Prepare for
a Glencracken!

1294
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,720
Comrades!

1295
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,240
Cacedonia!

1296
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,160
The king is
unprotected.

1297
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,680
I shall approach him
from the rear.

1298
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,760
God save you!

1299
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,200
Oh, fuck me. All right.
You got it. I got you.

1300
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,760
That's...
You look amazing.

1301
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,760
Thanks, man.

1302
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,360
You're dead.

1303
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,440
No way.
I killed you.

1304
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,840
You didn't kill me. Now
exeunt this battlefield.

1305
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,880
Wait a second.
That's not fair.

1306
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Listen,
you little twerp.

1307
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,560
You've been slain by the
mighty king. Now get lost,

1308
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,440
and take some pride
in dying an honorable death.

1309
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,600
No, but I killed you.

1310
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,600
You can't kill me after
I already killed you.

1311
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,720
Davith of Glencracken.

1312
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,960
Yes, my liege.

1313
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,080
Didst he slay me?

1314
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,400
He doth not slay the king.

1315
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,560
You weren't even here
when it happened!

1316
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,800
Was too here.

1317
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,080
Everyone, I'm telling you
the truth. I killed the king!

1318
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,400
I...

1319
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,760
Why don't you
believe me? I swear...

1320
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,200
Dost the Xanthian
weep like a maiden?

1321
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,800
Why are you
laughing at me?

1322
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,680
What are you doing?

1323
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,920
Danny, I didn't...

1324
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,240
I killed the king.
Oh, my God.

1325
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,520
You're lying.

1326
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,560
Are you calling me a liar?
You're a liar.

1327
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,000
Danny, just drop it. Let's just
get out of here. It doesn't matter.

1328
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,120
Are you telling me a kid
could slay the mighty king?

1329
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,400
Not a real king,
but you, yeah.

1330
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,120
You're lying. I can tell.
Danny, stop.

1331
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,480
He killed you.
Give him your hat.

1332
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,640
It's a crown.

1333
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,680
Give him your hat.
Danny.

1334
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,440
It's a crown, dude!

1335
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,240
Dude!
You're a liar.

1336
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,240
It's a piece of plastic.

1337
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,080
Okay, game over.

1338
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,680
You both are disqualified
from Laire forever.

1339
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,720
What?
Are you kidding me?

1340
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,360
Augie! Augie!

1341
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,880
Augie.

1342
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,080
Leave me alone.

1343
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,800
Look. I'm sorry.

1344
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,560
No, you're not sorry. You
don't care about any of this!

1345
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,400
This is so unfair!

1346
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,400
Hey, come on, buddy.
I'm not your buddy!

1347
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,160
You're only doing this because
the judge is making you.

1348
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,240
And you know what? That's
fine if you don't give a shit,

1349
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,480
but you don't have to ruin it
for me, because I do give a shit!

1350
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,320
I give lots of shits!

1351
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,120
Look, it's gonna be okay.

1352
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,560
No, it's not gonna be okay!

1353
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,560
You're the worst mentor ever! No wonder
your girlfriend left you, you asshole!

1354
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
Yo, Wheeler.
What's up, man?

1355
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,160
Hey. What's up?

1356
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,240
Okay, kid. Let's mingle.

1357
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,360
Let's do it.

1358
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,200
Yeah.

1359
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,080
Excuse me, miss.
Yes?

1360
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,760
You're sexy like
a chocolate strawberry.

1361
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,600
Who told you to say that?

1362
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,800
That's Wheeler,

1363
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,160
my PIC.

1364
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,040
Nice.
Come on, baby!

1365
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,680
Pass it.
No.

1366
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,720
No.
No!

1367
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,120
Hey. I'm gonna
rock a squirt,

1368
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,360
so you watch the kid
for a few minutes?

1369
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,080
Sure thing. You're the king,
Wheeler. You're the king.

1370
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:07,600
Yeah, okay.

1371
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,560
Long line.

1372
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,560
I've seen longer.

1373
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,080
Have we met?
I don't know. Have we?

1374
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,440
Well, what do you do?

1375
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,040
Well, I'm kind of
on hiatus right now,

1376
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,200
but my job is to dress up like a
minotaur and keep kids off drugs.

1377
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,040
Well, that's how I know you.
I teach at Morgan Elementary.

1378
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,880
That's so funny, 'cause I
think elementary school is hot.

1379
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,840
Hey.

1380
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,440
What are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.

1381
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,000
No, I don't want to
talk to you right now.

1382
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,120
Hey, Danny.

1383
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,200
You decided to come for
dinner. Great. Come on in.

1384
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,600
Thanks.
God damn it!

1385
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,120
What's up his cooz?

1386
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,200
I should take a piss
more often.

1387
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,560
I don't know.
I don't got a raincoat.

1388
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,080
Don't worry.
I'm very pro-choice.

1389
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,480
Okay.

1390
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,520
God, I'm really
kicking your ass.

1391
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,800
That's because
this is soccer.

1392
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,160
Black folks
don't play soccer.

1393
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,760
That guy's black.
Right there.

1394
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,760
You sit down,
young man.

1395
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,280
You have
been a bad boy!

1396
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,480
I've been bad.

1397
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,200
And now you're gonna
have to stay after class.

1398
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,040
Oh, man. Look.

1399
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,880
Even though this is one of my top
four all-time fantasies, I can't, okay?

1400
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,400
I want to, but I gotta
go find my friend.

1401
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,360
Oh, yeah?

1402
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,280
You sure?

1403
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,160
Oh, my God.

1404
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,720
Do what you need to do.

1405
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,960
He'll be fine.
He's 10. Come here.

1406
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:51,040
Let's go.

1407
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,360
Uh-oh!

1408
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,920
This is how it ends.

1409
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,520
Game winner! I win!

1410
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,640
Let's go, Michael.

1411
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,120
Man, forget you, man.

1412
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,760
That's booty, son.

1413
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,000
Let's go. I'm ready.

1414
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,520
They don't call me the king
of this game for nothing!

1415
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,840
Wheeler, where you at?

1416
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,600
Wheeler? Wheeler. Wheeler.

1417
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,920
Wheeler.

1418
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,000
So, Danny, you must be glad
that you're almost done

1419
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,720
with your required
time with Augie.

1420
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,920
How much time
do you have left?

1421
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,360
Eleven, 12 hours or so.

1422
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,160
Jeez, Augie. You're acting
like your goldfish died.

1423
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,160
I don't have a goldfish, Jim.
You know what I mean.

1424
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,800
You're acting like as if you
had a goldfish and it died.

1425
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,200
Augie kind of got
screwed over today.

1426
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,400
I killed the king, Mom.

1427
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,840
Okay.
He killed the king.

1428
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,040
All right. All right. Don't
encourage him. He did kill the king.

1429
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,200
But he was lying to everyone and
told everyone that he killed me.

1430
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,240
I don't wanna hear any more
about your Dungeons & Dragons

1431
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,560
or your fruity Cocoa Puffs...

1432
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,040
It's all fairyland
with him.

1433
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,960
We're trying to keep it...
We're trying to keep it real.

1434
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,160
The Goddess of Navalore
saw me cry, Mom.

1435
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,600
Hey, Augie, when I was a
little kid, I accidentally

1436
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,640
crapped my pants
in front of a girl I liked,

1437
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,840
so I feel your pain.

1438
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,080
Well, he likes girls. That's a
good thing. That's a surprise to me.

1439
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,000
Doesn't matter anyway.
He got me kicked out.

1440
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,680
What?
What? You're kidding me.

1441
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,720
They can kick you out?

1442
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,280
Yeah, I'm banned.
This is a great thing.

1443
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,640
Way to go, big guy.
Does this mean

1444
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,800
we can finally get rid
of those boots

1445
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,840
and that God-awful cape that you made
out of my tablecloth? I'm so sick of this.

1446
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,960
I'll burn them up in a...

1447
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,920
We'll have a bonfire.
We'll make a thing of it.

1448
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,040
Don't you want him to wear
what makes him happy?

1449
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,400
Yes. Yes, I do.
Yes.

1450
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,880
You know when I want him to
wear what makes him happy?

1451
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,360
On October 31st.
Halloween, go nuts.

1452
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,680
Wear lipstick.
I don't care.

1453
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,880
Yeah. Yeah.

1454
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,720
You know, dress like a nun.
Sure.

1455
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,080
We're gonna have
a celebration

1456
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,080
to celebrate you joining
the rest of the world.

1457
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,080
Becoming a normal kid.
He is a normal kid.

1458
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,760
You think he's normal?
Yeah, I think he's normal.

1459
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,320
You think he's normal.
He's normal.

1460
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,360
When I was his age,

1461
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,440
I had four, five girlfriends at
one time. Didn't I tell you that?

1462
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,120
He was fucking
his cousin.

1463
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,720
I wasn't fucking
my cousin. I...

1464
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,040
We kissed, because I didn't
know she was my cousin,

1465
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,520
but when I found out, I stopped
kissing her, but I fucked her friends.

1466
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,480
I fucked my
cousin's friends.

1467
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,720
I think that Augie is just having
kind of a tough time in life,

1468
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,400
which sounds pretty normal
to me. Life is tough.

1469
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,240
It is tough. But you know
what? This is my point.

1470
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,080
It's tougher when you...
With parents like you?

1471
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,600
Excuse me?
What did you just say?

1472
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,920
I said it is tough, but I think
it's tougher with parents like you.

1473
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,200
I thought that's
what you just said.

1474
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,400
I don't know
how you do it, kid.

1475
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,360
I mean, I thought my life sucked.
Jesus Christ, I really feel for you.

1476
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,480
Okay. That's enough.

1477
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:31,800
Don't listen to
them, all right?

1478
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,200
Do what makes you happy. You
want to wear a cape? Wear a cape.

1479
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,920
You want to wear a suit
of armor? Who gives a shit?

1480
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,320
You know what? I would never
have invited you over for moussaka

1481
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,720
if I'd known you were gonna
be such a prick. Excuse me.

1482
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,040
Augie, screw them.

1483
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,120
Do what makes you happy.
Hey. Whoa!

1484
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Do what
makes you happy. Hey, buddy...

1485
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,120
I'd like you to
leave now, please.

1486
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,400
I figure you're probably

1487
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,200
not gonna sign my
hours sheet now.

1488
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,240
Go fuck yourself.

1489
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,960
That's what I thought.
Hey, Augie, I'm sorry.

1490
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,600
Get the hell out.

1491
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,600
I'd be psyched if he was my kid. Please.

1492
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,560
And you know what,
sweetheart?

1493
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,840
It's not that we're not
psyched that you're our kid.

1494
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,760
We're psyched. I'm so
psyched, I can't stand it.

1495
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,760
Your mom's psyched
that you're her kid.

1496
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,000
May I please
be excused, Mom?

1497
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,400
Hey. Where's Ronnie?

1498
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,840
Who's Ronnie, dude?

1499
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,280
Oh, shit. Ronnie!

1500
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,000
Ronnie.

1501
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,640
What's up, man?
Hey. How you doing?

1502
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,200
Ro-Ro.

1503
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,160
Anybody see the
little kid I was with?

1504
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,000
<i>This is Karen,
Ronnie's mother.</i>

1505
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,480
<i>Ronnie was supposed to be
home a few hours ago.</i>

1506
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,640
<i>This is Karen again.</i>

1507
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,240
<i>Can you guys please call me
and let me know where you are?</i>

1508
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,800
<i>Ronnie just got in. He walked
all the way home. What the hell...</i>

1509
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:00,520
You're out.
Look...

1510
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,040
You're out.
Look...

1511
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,640
No, no, no, no. It's over.
You blew it. It's done. Okay?

1512
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,440
I hear what you're saying. We're
very sorry, but we're 11 hours short.

1513
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,200
And you're gonna stay 11 hours
short, okay? I don't know.

1514
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,960
Parents don't want you hanging around
with their kids for some reason.

1515
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,960
So you BSed a BSer.

1516
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,720
Good for you! I hope you feel
good about yourself, God damn it!

1517
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,120
You know, I could be
back in New York

1518
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,160
doing cocaine in the
Village, but I'm not.

1519
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,880
You know why?
Kids come first.

1520
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,560
They don't come
first for you, do they?

1521
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,040
They come second
to your selfishness.

1522
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,040
So why don't you
two guys go home,

1523
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,440
put down some lines
of selfishness,

1524
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,200
which is your blow,

1525
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:45,960
close the shades, take
the phone off the hook,

1526
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,440
grab a straw and snort?

1527
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,520
And don't expect me
to testify on your behalf.

1528
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,480
You're not Sturdy Wings
material.

1529
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,760
I think you guys are gonna
have to go to jail.

1530
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,040
The only thing we can do now

1531
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,280
is make a case at the hearing
that you did your best.

1532
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,320
It's gonna take some serious
lawyering on my part.

1533
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,360
Yeah. Beth, please.
Lawyer the shit out of it.

1534
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,800
I just can't promise
anything.

1535
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,400
Yes, Wheeler?
Question.

1536
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,840
Maybe a stupid one, but
I'm just spit-balling here.

1537
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,120
The Get Out of Jail Free
card,

1538
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,840
is that based on
something that exists or...

1539
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,240
That wasn't
a stupid question.

1540
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,320
That's real.

1541
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,640
It's real in the
game of Monopoly.

1542
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,000
Yeah, it's based
on true events.

1543
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,840
How... What do you mean?

1544
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,960
Chance.

1545
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,400
I can't believe
we're going to jail.

1546
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,440
Believe it.

1547
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,240
Hey, maybe you'll
roll doubles. You know?

1548
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,520
If not, you just
miss three turns.

1549
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,680
Game face, bro.

1550
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,360
I told you.
Game face.

1551
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,040
Enough with the
game face, all right?

1552
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,560
This isn't beach volleyball.

1553
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,760
Is it not? Because,
if you think about it,

1554
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,920
the net is like your goals
in life, and you are the ball.

1555
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,480
And you can spike the ball
down, or you, over the net.

1556
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,000
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Then you go into sidelines.

1557
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,040
It's bad enough
I'm going to jail.

1558
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,920
I can't take it anymore
with you yapping away.

1559
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,000
Yap, yap, yip, yip.

1560
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,800
"Bang your drum, bro. "
Maybe I should be like you.

1561
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,280
"I hate myself, yet I'm
better than everyone. "

1562
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,200
You're one to talk. You
took a 10-year-old to a party

1563
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,080
and left him so you
could go get a blow job.

1564
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,240
Hey.

1565
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,760
It wasn't a blow job.
We fucked.

1566
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,800
Please! Watch
your language!

1567
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,360
Sorry.
Sorry.

1568
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,520
You are an
S- H-I-T-T-Y friend.

1569
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:29,160
He can spell.

1570
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,440
I'm not your friend.

1571
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,000
Oh.

1572
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,640
You wanna go?

1573
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:39,520
Stop it!

1574
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,680
There you go, Danny.
Now you got no friends.

1575
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,680
Sorry.

1576
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,840
Hello?
Hey, Ro-Ro. It's Wheeler.

1577
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,480
So you guys have to
be at the courthouse

1578
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,280
no later than
3:00 p. m., okay?

1579
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,320
All right.

1580
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,520
<i>Please, do not be late.
No. I know.</i>

1581
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,200
No, I'll be there.

1582
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,440
You don't always have to get
breakfast this time of day.

1583
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,360
Hiya, King.

1584
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:47,920
No, no, no. I don't
mean to cause trouble.

1585
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,280
I just wanted to come
by and apologize

1586
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,400
for the way that
I behaved last time.

1587
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,360
I... I lost my temper when I saw
you last, and that was regrettable.

1588
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,760
Not to mention highly
illegal, you jackanape.

1589
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,400
I know. It's just that my...
Denver omelet?

1590
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,440
Right here. Thank you.

1591
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,440
It's just my friend
was upset, you see,

1592
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,680
and he thought
he'd stabbed you.

1593
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,880
He hadn't.
Of course he hadn't.

1594
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,600
Go on.

1595
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:15,760
It's just that...

1596
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,760
I accidentally cast an
unbreakable madness spell on him.

1597
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,120
Well, that was stupid.
I know, right?

1598
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,440
I didn't mean to.

1599
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:26,680
You guys are reckless
out there.

1600
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,120
Yeah. Unsafe. Okay, I had a
protection spell on me. All right?

1601
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,880
But it had faded off when you
touched me, so don't flatter yourself

1602
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,400
thinking you can come
back at me, okay,

1603
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,160
'cause I would love to see
you penetrate me again.

1604
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,840
Anyway, I was
just wondering

1605
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,080
if maybe you could
see it in your heart

1606
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,320
to let him fight today
on the battlefield.

1607
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,920
He loves Laire
more than anything.

1608
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,120
He's just a kid, but he's
got the heart of a lion...

1609
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,800
Hmm.

1610
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,600
...and the eye of the tiger.

1611
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,640
Hmm.

1612
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,920
More coffee?

1613
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,160
No, I'm decaf.

1614
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,320
Okay.

1615
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,760
If he be so brave,

1616
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,760
why doth he not show
his face here today?

1617
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,720
Do you fight
all his battles?

1618
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,720
Hmm.

1619
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,680
He knows not I'm here.

1620
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,760
Hmm.

1621
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,280
He hath too
much pride.

1622
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:16,800
Hmm.

1623
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,960
Magic healing
potion. Wizards...

1624
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,560
How's it going?

1625
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,880
Tell your kinsman

1626
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,080
we shall see him
on the battlefield today.

1627
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,440
Thank you.
Thank you, noble king.

1628
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,400
Really?

1629
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,400
Mmm-hmm.

1630
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,720
You know
you want it.

1631
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,240
Now exit my
Burger Hole, boy.

1632
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,760
Make it known to the Xanthians that
if they let Augie fight with them,

1633
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,080
we'll destroy each and every
one of them, without mercy,

1634
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,560
before the first
apple-cider break.

1635
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,400
Hey, what's up, my PIC?

1636
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,200
Ronnie. Ronnie.

1637
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,800
To listen to me

1638
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,000
and listen good. I am a
very animalistic woman,

1639
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,080
a very animalistic woman,

1640
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,400
and when it comes to my son,
I am a lioness,

1641
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,840
a black Sheba.

1642
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,400
Black Sheba.
Yeah, but listen...

1643
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,560
I am a lioness,

1644
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,320
and that boy is my cub,

1645
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,240
and if you let anything bad
happen to my cub,

1646
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,440
I will claw your ass up
until you shit sideways.

1647
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,480
Do you understand?
Yes.

1648
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,120
You'll tear me up so bad that when
I shit, it'll come out sideways.

1649
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,920
I understand.
Okay.

1650
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,120
It's just, Ronnie looks
up to you. Okay?

1651
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,560
He doesn't need another
man leaving him behind.

1652
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,800
I know. I know.
I fucked up, okay?

1653
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,800
I... The kid acts
so tough,

1654
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,600
I didn't know I could
hurt him, you know?

1655
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,560
I'm determined to make
it up to him. All right?

1656
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:17,400
What I'm trying to say is that
when I get out of prison,

1657
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,720
could I hang out with
your 10-year-old son?

1658
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,640
Well, you're gonna have
to ask him yourself.

1659
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,520
Hey. Ronnie.

1660
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,320
Um...

1661
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,400
Look. I'm sorry, okay?

1662
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,280
I know I don't deserve it,

1663
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,720
but Sturdy Wings or no Sturdy
Wings, I want to be your Big.

1664
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,840
Okay. I'm your Little, and
you're my Big. I like that.

1665
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,840
Can I tell you how deeply, deeply I
regret this situation with this latest Big?

1666
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,880
Can I tell you how deeply, deeply I
regret this situation with this latest Big?

1667
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,400
It's completely unacceptable,
and at Sturdy Wings,

1668
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,800
it's not how we roll.

1669
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,440
So I'm going to guarantee
you that Mr. Gary

1670
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:05,120
is our most experienced
and dependable volunteer.

1671
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,720
Let me
put it this way.

1672
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,200
If I had a nickel for every year
that I've been with Sturdy Wings,

1673
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,160
I would have enough
money to

1674
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,640
<i>play a game of Pac-Man.</i>

1675
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,680
Been five years.

1676
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,040
And if I stay with Sturdy
Wings for another five years,

1677
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,440
then I'll have enough
for another round.

1678
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,960
<i>Another round of Pac-Man. Right.</i>

1679
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,680
Five cents for every year,
times five...

1680
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,760
That's 25.
We get it.

1681
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,240
That's 25 cents.
That's a quarter.

1682
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,480
<i>But the Pac-Man here,
I think it's 50 cents.</i>

1683
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,240
What are you doing here?
I'm breaking you out.

1684
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,640
There's a nation at war.
Are you in?

1685
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,080
Aye.

1686
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,400
Aye... I am, too.
Come on.

1687
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,840
<i>Wheeler hasn't called me back.
Are you guys gonna make it or what?</i>

1688
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,480
I don't know, Beth. I mean, I can't
speak for Wheeler, but I'll be there.

1689
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,680
<i>You gotta promise me.
Yeah, I promise. I just...</i>

1690
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,600
I'm helping Augie with something,
and then I'm on my way, okay?

1691
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,120
<i>County courthouse, 3:00.
All right.</i>

1692
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,040
Man, I'm gonna kick
some Cacedonian ass.

1693
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,560
Yeah, totally.

1694
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,040
It's Artonius.

1695
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,560
Bid him good morrow.

1696
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,360
Greetings, Artonius.

1697
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,920
Get ready for some pain.

1698
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,000
What? What? Wait. No, no, no.
No, you can't do that.

1699
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,880
<i>You're out of Xanthia.
What are you talking about?</i>

1700
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,320
<i>Sorry, Blufgan.</i>

1701
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,640
Forget it, Danny.

1702
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,240
They said I'm too
much of a liability.

1703
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,760
They're kicking me
out of Xanthia.

1704
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,720
What? Are you serious?

1705
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,560
Screw them. We'll
start our own country.

1706
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:24,680
We can't.

1707
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,920
All my costumes have the same
colors and same symbols as Xanthia.

1708
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,280
And besides, you can't start
a country with two people.

1709
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,840
No? What's the minimum?

1710
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,040
Where you going?

1711
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,720
You can't go anywhere.
Come on.

1712
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,280
What do you want,
asshole?

1713
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,480
Actually, we
need your help.

1714
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,440
I can't believe
my eyes.

1715
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,560
A minotaur!

1716
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,480
Augie?

1717
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,280
Where are you?

1718
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,560
<i>Hear he, hear he.</i>

1719
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,560
This is a battle to the
last man standing,

1720
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,600
and the victor
shall rule the realm.

1721
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,280
There'll be no magical
rejuvenation powder today.

1722
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,280
Instead, if you are killed,
you are done!

1723
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:17,360
Fight well, and may
the best country win!

1724
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,760
Stay close, like
cotton on a lamb.

1725
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,120
Brothers and sisters of the
new nation of Kiss-My-Anthia,

1726
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,600
I stand here before you not as
the Augie Farks you once knew.

1727
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,560
Today I stand before
you a warrior!

1728
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,440
For time eternal,

1729
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,320
I have let the naysayers
of this world bring me down.

1730
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,200
They used to say,
"You shouldn't fight.

1731
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,640
"You should be
embarrassed of yourself.

1732
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,040
"You look like a young
Marvin Hamlisch. "

1733
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,400
Well, you know what
I say to those naysayers?

1734
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,280
I say nay! I will fight!

1735
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,920
I will not be embarrassed!

1736
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,160
Who the fuck
is Marvin Hamlisch?

1737
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,400
<i>He wrote the music
to The Sting.</i>

1738
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,680
That's a good movie.

1739
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,320
But I don't care,

1740
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,480
'cause in this moment,
doing what I love,

1741
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,400
I know I have already won.

1742
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,960
An honorable, albeit court-appointed,
friend once said to me,

1743
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,720
"Do what makes you happy. "

1744
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:16,000
And nothing would make me happier
than to fight alongside you brave men.

1745
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,800
When the elders
speak of this day,

1746
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,240
they will speak of the courage
of Kiss-My-Anthia.

1747
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,880
Of the Spaceman.

1748
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:25,760
The Demon.

1749
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,760
The Starchild.

1750
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,760
And me, the Cat!

1751
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,600
So let us raise
our swords in victory,

1752
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,520
crank this shit up to 11,

1753
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,720
and let's rip this
realm a new asshole!

1754
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,800
Yeah!

1755
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,120
Yeah! What the fuck
are we talking about?

1756
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,120
May Xanthia and
Kiss-My-Anthia be allies.

1757
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:50,680
King Argotron be damned.
We fight with you.

1758
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
Thank you, friends.
Your honor is great.

1759
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,240
Come. Let us gingerly
touch our tips.

1760
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,680
Game on!

1761
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,760
Game on!

1762
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,320
Yeah!

1763
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,600
Once we pass this point,
there's no turning back.

1764
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,240
It's a fight
to the death!

1765
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,160
About time!
Let's rip this shit up!

1766
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:32,800
Yeah!
Yeah!

1767
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,760
Yeah. Oh, snap! No!

1768
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,360
Come on. No!

1769
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,960
Augie, what the hell?
Your boys just killed me!

1770
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,560
Retreat! Go! Like the leopard!
Like the leopard!

1771
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,040
Oh, Saint Venise!

1772
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,000
<i>Et tu, you two?</i>

1773
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,480
What the hell's going on?

1774
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,080
They killed you, so you have to
die an honorable and noble death.

1775
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,040
Okay. I think I can do that.

1776
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,640
Not bad.
Blufgan.

1777
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,240
Kuzzik.

1778
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:15,960
Fulfill your
destiny, Blufgan.

1779
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,120
Yes.
Kill the king.

1780
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,400
I will.
Kill the king.

1781
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,560
I will, Kuzzik!

1782
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,960
Go. Go.

1783
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,280
Go. Go.

1784
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,280
Take that, you
lily-livered coward!

1785
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,680
Hey. Hey. Where the hell are you guys?

1786
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,200
I cannot stall any longer.

1787
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,520
I'm at Jefferson Park.
Look. I can't talk right now.

1788
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,280
I'm in the middle of
battling a Cacedonian.

1789
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,160
Beth, I gotta help Augie.
I gotta go.

1790
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,880
<i>Fucking Cacedonian ass.</i>

1791
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,800
What? Hello. What?

1792
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,000
Bitch!

1793
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,880
Retreat to the castle!

1794
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,720
Long live Xanthia!

1795
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,360
You lost an arm, honey!

1796
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:21,440
Nice one, dude.

1797
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,000
Hey, Esplen.
Thanks.

1798
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,240
Okay. See you.
See you.

1799
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,400
Die, coward!

1800
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,280
Cacedonia
is to rule forever!

1801
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,880
What a scene.

1802
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,200
Okay. We lost a man,
but we can still do this.

1803
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,720
It's not the manpower.
It's the power of the man.

1804
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,360
Shit, this kid really
jacks you up.

1805
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,120
I want you to go left
through these trees.

1806
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,320
His lackeys
are pretty strong,

1807
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,560
but Davith of Glencracken
is the one you want.

1808
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,720
He's the one built
like a brick shithouse.

1809
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,760
Leave it to us, Augie.

1810
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,600
<i>Good luck, mi amigos!</i>

1811
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:18,000
Thanks for doing this. I'm doing
it for the kids, not for you.

1812
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,000
Come on.

1813
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,200
Feel the steel
of my hammer!

1814
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,600
Hey, hey! Okay! Okay!
I'm dead! I'm dead!

1815
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,720
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
It's fun though, right?

1816
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,600
It's a blast.
It's contagious. I know.

1817
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,200
Totally.
Come back next year.

1818
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,400
I will. Thanks. Okay.

1819
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,800
We need people.
Give me your e-mail.

1820
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,400
Dude, you saved my life.

1821
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,840
I did what any good
coworker would do.

1822
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,920
I honestly can't say
I would do the same for you.

1823
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,960
You would, Danny,
because you're my friend.

1824
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,680
I want to hear you say it.

1825
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,160
Come on.
Say it.

1826
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,640
I'm your friend.

1827
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,480
Will you hold me?
No.

1828
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,880
Kiss on the cheek?
No.

1829
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:32,280
Hug me. I don't want to
do any of that.

1830
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,400
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1831
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,840
Aren't you dead yet?

1832
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,520
Very close, Starchild.

1833
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,160
The end is near.

1834
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,760
Sleep, friend.

1835
01:23:49,640 --> 01:23:51,680
They can't hurt you now.

1836
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,600
Right in the ball
sack. Fuck.

1837
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,840
All right. I'm
gonna get a beer.

1838
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,120
Hold your ground!

1839
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:03,840
Hold your ground!

1840
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:05,640
Enclose, stab.

1841
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,160
As you command.

1842
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,720
Yes, my lord.
North.

1843
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,960
Davith is gone.
Nice work.

1844
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,600
Where's Spaceman?

1845
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,720
I don't think there's many
warriors left, you know.

1846
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:21,960
If I could just get
him one-on-one,

1847
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,800
I swear I could take him.
I could take him down.

1848
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,680
Hold up, dude.
Methinks I have a plan.

1849
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,760
Hey, King! King!

1850
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:34,720
It's that guy from
The Burger Hole.

1851
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,040
Oh, he seems
to be wounded.

1852
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:38,320
Shall I take him out, sire?

1853
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,800
Nay. This one is mine.

1854
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,120
Well! Well, well.

1855
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,800
Looks like thou art fell for
the oldest trick in the scroll.

1856
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:17,560
Now you will kneel
before the king.

1857
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,960
Oh, drag. I really wanted to
win that pointy little hat.

1858
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,160
It's a crown!

1859
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,440
Cacedonia!

1860
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,560
You!

1861
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,760
Shit.

1862
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:47,840
Argotron. Face me,
if ye be brave enough.

1863
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,000
Didn't I teach you
a lesson the last time?

1864
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,440
I think you're afraid
I'm gonna kill you again.

1865
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,880
Go get them, Augie!

1866
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,240
You shut up, whore!
My mom is not a whore!

1867
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,680
Yes, she is!

1868
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,600
He could actually win.
It's anyone's game.

1869
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,880
Go, Blufgan!

1870
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,360
Yo, Augie! Fuck
his shit up, man!

1871
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,000
Screw it!

1872
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,080
Bad decision.

1873
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,840
No, it's a good decision.

1874
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,200
Oh, shit!

1875
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,400
It's okay.
I don't need it.

1876
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,720
Hey!

1877
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,200
Please. No.

1878
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,360
Yeah!
Yeah!

1879
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,520
That's what
I'm talking about!

1880
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:34,680
Yes!

1881
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,120
The gods have
played a coup.

1882
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,120
Blufgan is the last man
standing of them all!

1883
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:45,880
All hail King Blufgan!

1884
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,480
Hail, Blufgan!

1885
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:53,200
Yeah!
Yeah!

1886
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,480
What? Esplen is still alive?

1887
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,040
Esplen!

1888
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
I was hiding in the
bushes the whole time.

1889
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,560
That's a pretty
smart strategy.

1890
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,360
Thanks.
Sorry I killed you.

1891
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:18,920
It's okay.

1892
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,920
All hail Queen Esplen
of Navalore!

1893
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,440
Hail, Esplen!

1894
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,040
Game end!

1895
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,680
One slice to the king's chest and
down like a sack of elderberries!

1896
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,880
One slice to the king's chest and
down like a sack of elderberries!

1897
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,840
You did good, Augie.

1898
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,480
I mean, a girl did beat you,

1899
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,040
but it's definitely not as
gay as I thought it would be.

1900
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:52,200
You were incredible.
Second place!

1901
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,960
That's like a silver medal. Kind of
makes you hungry for the gold, huh?

1902
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:59,680
No, but we... Serious, we
are very, very proud of you.

1903
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,360
Thanks for trying to
be nice, Mom. Jim.

1904
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,200
Hail, Esplen!

1905
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,160
Congratulations.

1906
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,440
I can't believe I won.

1907
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,680
When I killed you,
I was, like, "No way. "

1908
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,640
Yeah, well, the crown looks
very good on you, very regal.

1909
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,920
Thanks.
I liked your whiskers.

1910
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,400
Thanks.
Was that eyeliner?

1911
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,520
Yeah, I just drew them on.

1912
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:32,800
It looked good.

1913
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:35,160
Thanks.
I have two cats, so...

1914
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,840
Oh. Okay. Cool.

1915
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,400
So, Augie,

1916
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,080
now that I'm queen,
I was wondering if maybe

1917
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,760
you'd wanna be my king?

1918
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,360
Yeah. I'd love that.

1919
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,960
Should...
Should I kiss you now?

1920
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,240
Fuck, yeah.

1921
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,200
<i>Do you know the
song Beth? By Kiss?</i>

1922
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,760
You did a really good
thing tonight, Wheeler.

1923
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,080
Yeah. They'll probably
double our sentence

1924
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,600
for not showing up to the
hearing this afternoon.

1925
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:20,000
Well, listen. I got a long-standing
relationship with this judge,

1926
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,200
and I don't want to get too graphic,
but I used to suck his dick for drugs.

1927
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,760
Oh.
He got me my junk.

1928
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,000
Long story short, you
guys are not going to jail.

1929
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,400
Are you BSing me? 'Cause I
know you're the best BSer.

1930
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:31,480
No, I'm being straight
with you, man.

1931
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,680
Shit. Thank you.

1932
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:34,720
Whoa! Okay.

1933
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:35,800
Thank you so much.
All right.

1934
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,440
Hey, what's going on here?

1935
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,480
So speaking of whatever you
guys were just talking about,

1936
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,880
I happen to know a really nice
Italian restaurant in Manhattan Beach,

1937
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,440
and I would love to take you
if you're interested.

1938
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,000
Sure, Martin.

1939
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:52,480
I just hope we're talking
pasta and not pussy.

1940
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,400
Well, I was talking about
two adults having some pasta,

1941
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,560
and, yes, I was kinda hoping
that it would lead to some pussy.

1942
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,480
Call it out there.

1943
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,040
I mean, what are we after here? Okay.

1944
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:05,760
Quiet down! Quiet down!
Gather round, ye nobles!

1945
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,920
<i>Beth, I hear you calling</i>

1946
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:28,000
<i>But I can't come
home right now</i>

1947
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:31,480
<i>'Cause me and the
boys are slaying</i>

1948
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,600
<i>And we just can't
find the sound</i>

1949
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,560
<i>None of these lyrics</i>

1950
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,640
<i>Have anything to do
with what I want to say</i>

1951
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,960
<i>But it's got a pretty melody</i>

1952
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,240
<i>And I get to sing your name</i>

1953
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,720
<i>That seems pretty cool</i>

1954
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,960
<i>Beth, you are so awesome</i>

1955
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,120
<i>And I miss you so much</i>

1956
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,680
<i>Your beautiful smile</i>

1957
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,920
<i>And your positive attitude
and your whispering eye</i>

1958
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,640
<i>We don't have to get married</i>

1959
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:15,680
<i>But I'm still in love with you</i>

1960
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:19,400
<i>We can just be together</i>

1961
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,040
<i>Like Tim Robbins
and Susan Sarandon</i>

1962
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,640
Good actors.

1963
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,320
<i>Tim and Sue</i>

1964
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:31,360
<i>Beth, I am so
lonely without you</i>

1965
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,320
<i>And I hope we'll be all right</i>

1966
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:37,800
<i>You and me should make up</i>

1967
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:44,000
<i>Tonight</i>

1968
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,160
And the kiss!

1969
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,080
Nice.

1970
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:35,400
Hey, what does this
look like to you?

1971
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,280
Hey.
How you doing?

1972
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

1973
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,200
Yes, sir.
Yeah.

1974
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:55,200
Put it back in.

1975
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,080
Ouch. Ouch.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1976
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,000
There you go.

1977
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,840
Ow!
