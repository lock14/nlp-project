1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,500
<i>The Earth is at peace.</i>

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,800
<i>There is no hunger.</i>

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
<i>There is no violence.</i>

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,700
<i>The environment is healed.</i>

5
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>Honesty, courtesy and kindnes
are practiced by all.</i>

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,900
<i>Our world has never been more</i>

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,900
<i>perfect.</i>

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>Only it is
no longer our world.</i>

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,600
<i>We've been invaded</i>

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
<i>by an alien race.</i>

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,500
<i>They occupy the bodies</i>

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,500
<i>of almost all human
beings on the planet.</i>

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,200
<i>The few humans who have survived</i>

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,700
<i>are on the run.</i>

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Please.

16
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Come with us.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,100
We only want to help you.

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,500
Please be careful.

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,800
Please don't hurt yourself.

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,900
We don't want to hurt you.

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,100
Like hell!

22
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,200
No!

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,200
No!

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,300
Barely a bone not broken or organ ruptured.

25
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,800
I cannot tell you why she is not dead.

26
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,200
This one wants to live.

27
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,900
Welcome.

28
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,100
I am Healer Fords.

29
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,900
What shall I call you?

30
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,100
You have lived many lives on many worlds.

31
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,300
A wanderer such as yourself,

32
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,400
there must have been a name.

33
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,100
Call

34
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
me

35
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,200
Wanderer.

36
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
When will she be able to work?

37
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
Not now.

38
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,500
Of course, Healer.

39
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,200
<i>No.</i>

40
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,800
<i>No.</i>

41
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
<i>No.</i>

42
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,900
<i>I didn't die.</i>

43
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,000
<i>I didn't die.</i>

44
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,500
<i>That's right.</i>

45
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,900
<i>I'm still here.</i>

46
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
<i>Don't think this is yours.</i>

47
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,300
<i>This body is mine.</i>

48
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,900
No, mine.

49
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
<i>I don't know how much you
know about this new world.</i>

50
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,200
<i>Almost every human</i>

51
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,300
has been successfully occupied.

52
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,200
As with the other planets you've inhabited,

53
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
we do not change this world.

54
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
But experience it.

55
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
And perfect it.

56
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,200
<i>What did you think?</i>

57
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
<i>Did you think
I'd just give up?</i>

58
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,200
However, there are still
pockets of human resistance

59
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
that threaten our peace.

60
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,100
Your host was part of that resistance.

61
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,000
You want me to locate her memories.

62
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Yes. From those memories,
we can locate other rebels.

63
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,400
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

64
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,000
But I must warn you.

65
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Most humans fade away, but a
rare few fight their occupation.

66
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,100
Her name is Melanie Stryder.

67
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>She was born in Louisiana.</i>

68
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>Her family escaped the initial
waves of colonization.</i>

69
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,300
<i>But it was only
a matter of time.</i>

70
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,900
<i>Her father was
discovered alone.</i>

71
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,500
He took his life rather than
be taken by our Seekers

72
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
and risk the lives of his children.

73
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
<i>Melanie has been on the run
ever since with...</i>

74
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,300
<i>No! Don't say it!</i>

75
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,200
<i>Don't you say it!</i>

76
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,600
<i>Please.</i>

77
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,200
<i>I beg you.</i>

78
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,100
Is she resisting?

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,100
Jamie.

80
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,000
His name is Jamie Stryder.

81
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,500
<i>I hate you.</i>

82
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
<i>If only I could hurt you.</i>

83
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,300
I understand why you are resistant.

84
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,300
You believe that the loss of your will

85
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,700
is too great a sacrifice.

86
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,000
But we have to think of the common good.

87
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,700
<i>Call it whatever you want.
This is murder.</i>

88
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,400
One sound and you die.

89
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,600
Do it. I'd rather die.

90
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,000
That's impossible.

91
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
You're human.

92
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,700
<i>Come back!</i>

93
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,000
<i>Stop!</i>

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,600
Stop!

95
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
Wait!

96
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Look! Look!
Look at me!

97
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
I'm human.

98
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Just like you.

99
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,400
Get off me.

100
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,100
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>My name is Jared Howe.</i>

102
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,300
<i>I didn't mean to scare you.</i>

103
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,600
I haven't spoken to another
human being in two years.

104
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm guessing you haven't been
kissed in a while either.

105
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,100
Melanie Stryder.

106
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,000
I've got someone waiting for me.

107
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,400
You're not alone?

108
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,800
It's my kid brother.

109
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
He's hungry.
I ran two hours to get to this house.

110
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,700
I can give you a ride.

111
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,100
Hey, it's faster than running.

112
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,000
It's even faster than your running.

113
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,600
<i>Are you gonna pretend like you
didn't feel something just now?</i>

114
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,100
<i>I know you felt that.</i>

115
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,500
<i>Stop that!</i>

116
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,800
<i>Stop!</i>

117
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,500
<i>What you're doing is wrong.</i>

118
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,300
<i>And you know it.</i>

119
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,100
After meeting Jared Howe,

120
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Melanie and her brother stayed with him.

121
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,400
<i>They settled in an abandoned place</i>

122
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
<i>yet to be explored
by our souls.</i>

123
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,400
Left, right.

124
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
They could almost forget the
invasion happening around them.

125
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,900
You haven't kissed me since that first night.

126
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,300
Melanie,

127
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,100
you don't have to.

128
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
We could be the last ones.

129
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,600
And even if we are,

130
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,800
the last man and woman left on Earth,

131
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,900
you still don't have to.

132
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,500
I want to.

133
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,500
When you touch me,

134
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
it's...

135
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,300
I don't want you to stop.

136
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,700
You should sleep.

137
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,300
Then sleep with me.

138
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,600
All I'm saying is

139
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,700
we have time.

140
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,400
You don't know that.

141
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,400
You don't know if we've got months or days.

142
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
We could be taken at any moment.

143
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,300
We only have this, now.

144
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,600
Wanderer? Wanderer?

145
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
Wanderer!

146
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,700
Yes, Seeker.

147
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,000
You have not spoken for several minutes.

148
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,400
They were lovers?

149
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,600
These humans are not like the
other bodies you have inhabited.

150
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,300
They have unusually strong physical drives.

151
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
You have to be vigilant.

152
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,700
Yes.

153
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
<i>They saw Seekers nearby.</i>

154
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
<i>They were not found,
but knew they had to move .</i>

155
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,300
They were headed...

156
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,600
I can't see where.

157
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,300
A safe place with others.

158
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,100
Hope...

159
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,400
Before the long journey,

160
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,900
they spent the night in an old
hotel they thought was safe.

161
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,400
<i>Jared was out searching for
supplies for the trip.</i>

162
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Come on. Come on. Come on.

163
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,900
Stay here. Don't move.

164
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,400
I want to go with you.

165
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I'll lead them away and come right back.

166
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,000
I promise. Come on.

167
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
No!

168
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,100
<i>Now you know.</i>

169
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,000
<i>I will do anything.</i>

170
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,000
Go on.

171
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,700
There's nothing more now.

172
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,900
There has to be more.

173
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,600
I will keep trying.

174
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Please do, Wanderer.

175
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,100
<i>No! No, no! Wait! Stop!</i>

176
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,800
<i>You were not meant to see that.
You can't know that!</i>

177
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
<i>That could kill them!</i>

178
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,100
<i>Get rid of it. Get rid of it!
Now! Please!</i>

179
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,600
<i>You were not meant to see that.
Quiet.</i>

180
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,100
Quiet.

181
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,200
<i>Wanderer, please.</i>

182
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,400
<i>After everything you've se,</i>

183
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,700
<i>how can you still help them?</i>

184
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,800
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

185
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,600
<i>Look who's here.</i>

186
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,200
What a pleasant surprise, Seeker.

187
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,700
Did you follow me?

188
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,500
Only in case you needed me.

189
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,800
<i>Yeah. Right.</i>

190
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
<i>She is so full of it.</i>

191
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,500
What are you doing here?

192
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,200
I thought a change of scenery might help.

193
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,900
Change.

194
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,500
Wasn't your last planet
completely covered by water?

195
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,000
It's been a week since
you've had new information.

196
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,700
Do you know where they are?

197
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,900
<i>If you can't
say no, say nothing.</i>

198
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,000
<i>Walk away.</i>

199
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,800
Do you pity them?

200
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
The humans?

201
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,100
Don't you?

202
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,200
In your other lives, have you
ever felt anything like this?

203
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,700
They were brutal.

204
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,600
Killing each other.
Killing their planet.

205
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,200
They're lucky they survived as long as they did.

206
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,300
I do have some good news.

207
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,800
Your identification of Jared Howe has helped.

208
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,000
There was a sighting.
I am confident we will find him.

209
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
<i>- No!
- No!</i>

210
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,800
Ah!

211
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,200
Seeker, I am so sorry.

212
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't know what I was doing.

213
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Perhaps because you weren't doing it.

214
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
We have put you through enough.

215
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,100
Your host appears too resistant.

216
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,800
You are going to be re-implanted
into a more compliant host.

217
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,700
<i>Is he saying
what I think he's saying?</i>

218
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,300
What will happen to this body?

219
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,800
It is time for someone else
to search her memories.

220
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,900
<i>Her?</i>

221
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,700
You?

222
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,100
Yes.

223
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,900
My body can be held for me.

224
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,700
I will return to it when we
have the information we need.

225
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,200
Then what will happen to Melanie Stryder?

226
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,300
She will have the death she originally desired.

227
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,600
Unlike the way humans kill,
it will be done humanely.

228
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,100
<i>Stop her! Do something!</i>

229
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,300
My Healer has agreed to this?

230
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,000
No.
He transferred to Fort Worth.

231
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,000
Don't feel bad.
You are not the only one.

232
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,300
There are others who have not
had the strength of will.

233
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,100
When?
We make the transfer tomorrow.

234
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,800
We will stay outside your door tonight

235
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,700
so no harm will come to you.

236
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,900
Or to others.

237
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,000
<i>Please. I don't care if I die.
I can't have her inside me.</i>

238
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Melanie, I have to do my duty.

239
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,200
<i>You have to do what's right.
She'll kill my family.</i>

240
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,800
<i>Jamie, Jared, she'll kill them.
Wanderer, please.</i>

241
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,700
<i>Your Healer.
Do you think he would help?</i>

242
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,300
I think so.
But I don't know how to reach him.

243
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,000
<i>We need to find him.
We have to get out of here.</i>

244
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,800
We?

245
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,100
<i>Put the chair
against the door.</i>

246
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,100
<i>No. The other way.</i>

247
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
How does this help?
There's no way out.

248
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,700
<i>Yes, there is. That way.</i>

249
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,000
<i>Do it, Wanderer. Move.</i>

250
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,300
<i>Open it.</i>

251
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
<i>Come on.
You can do this.</i>

252
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,100
<i>It's not so high.
This is nothing.</i>

253
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,800
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

254
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,800
<i>Climb up.</i>

255
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,900
<i>Now jump.</i>

256
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,400
I can't.

257
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,500
<i>It's a good thing I can.</i>

258
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,700
<i>Swim!</i>

259
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Wanderer?
Are you all right?

260
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,900
You could have killed us.

261
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,300
<i>Run!</i>

262
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,500
Step aside.

263
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,000
Wanderer?

264
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,400
I'm sorry.

265
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
<i>We need to steal a car.</i>

266
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,100
<i>Don't worry.
I've done it before.</i>

267
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,800
Let me handle this.

268
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,900
<i>You?
What are you doing? Wait!</i>

269
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,500
Shh! Quiet!

270
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,500
Do you need help?

271
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,300
May I borrow your vehicle?

272
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Please. It is important.

273
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,500
Certainly.

274
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
Can I be of assistance?

275
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,400
No. Thank you.

276
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,900
This is an extremely reliable model.

277
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,400
The tank is full.

278
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,600
<i>Huh!</i>

279
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,000
It was no trick. We do not lie.
We trust each other.

280
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,200
<i>You guys take
the fun out of everything.</i>

281
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,400
<i>Where are we going?</i>

282
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,100
I will take you to my Healer in Fort Worth.

283
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,100
<i>Even if your Healer agrees
to keep me inside you,</i>

284
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,600
<i>I'll still be a prisoner.</i>

285
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,300
You will still be alive.

286
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,400
<i>That Seeker is a lot of things,
but she's not a fool.</i>

287
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,100
<i>Sooner or later, she'll work
out where you're going.</i>

288
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,300
We need a map.

289
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,500
<i>I'll show you the way.</i>

290
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,300
<i>What's wrong?</i>

291
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,200
<i>Are the memories
too painful?</i>

292
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,200
<i>How do you think I feel?</i>

293
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
I know how you feel.

294
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,200
That's the problem.

295
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,400
<i>When you take the body,
the feelings come with it.</i>

296
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,700
<i>It's a package deal.</i>

297
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,400
<i>You tell me. You're the one
with the steering wheel.</i>

298
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,100
You sent us in the wrong direction.

299
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,400
You have been putting thoughts
in my head to distract me.

300
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,000
The Seeker was right.
You are an unreasonable species.

301
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,400
I try to help you and this is how you thank me.

302
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,400
We are going to Fort Worth.

303
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
<i>No!</i>

304
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,200
Will it still work?

305
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,500
<i>Not anymore.</i>

306
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,800
Now what do we do?

307
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,400
<i>We walk.</i>

308
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,100
<i>Which way?
You can go my way,</i>

309
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,600
<i>or you can go your own
way and kill us both.</i>

310
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:03,100
<i>I made a promise.
I promised my brother I'd come back.</i>

311
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,500
How could I have been so foolish?

312
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,800
<i>How do I know
I can trust you?</i>

313
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,200
<i>I'm giving you
exactly what you wanted.</i>

314
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,800
<i>Taking you to my family
could get them killed.</i>

315
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,700
<i>We head east.</i>

316
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
<i>Come on.</i>

317
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,700
<i>Don't leave tracks.</i>

318
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,300
<i>Walk on the rocks.</i>

319
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,200
Did you really think you could beat me?

320
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,500
<i>Save the water.</i>

321
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,400
<i>We're gonna need it.</i>

322
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,900
I need it now.

323
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,200
We've been walking for ages.

324
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,500
How do you think you're going to find them?

325
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,800
<i>My uncle had a cabin
out here in the desert.</i>

326
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,200
<i>We were heading
out here to join him.</i>

327
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,200
<i>If he survived.</i>

328
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,500
<i>It's farther than I thought.</i>

329
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,800
I don't know how much farther I can go.

330
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
<i>We've walked too far
to walk back.</i>

331
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,800
Melanie.

332
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,900
Come on, girl.

333
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,200
Stay with me.

334
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,700
Uncle Jeb.

335
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,500
You found us.

336
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,600
Us?

337
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Jamie? Jared? Are they here?
Are they safe?

338
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,900
I told you I saw one.

339
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,400
Why did you give it water?

340
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
On account of it was dying.

341
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,800
<i>Uncle Jeb!
I'm in here!</i>

342
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,900
Hold it, Kyle.

343
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,800
Why?

344
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,900
She's one of them.

345
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,000
Well, yeah, she surely is,

346
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
but she's also my niece.

347
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,400
Was.

348
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,700
I'm just saying it's complicated, Ian.

349
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,000
I can make it simple.

350
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah, me, too.

351
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,700
<i>Aunt Maggie!</i>

352
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,800
Aunt Maggie!

353
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,900
You don't fool us, parasite!

354
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,500
<i>Oh, God. They don't see me.
They only see you.</i>

355
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,100
Now, Maggie.

356
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,900
Don't you "Maggie" me, little brother.

357
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
It could bring a whole army down on our heads.

358
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,500
I don't see anyone.

359
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,400
<i>I'm in here.</i>

360
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600
<i>I'm in here.</i>

361
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,900
This is unkind, Jebediah.

362
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,300
Let's go.

363
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Life is unkind, Magnolia.

364
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,600
Watch your head.

365
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,700
<i>Where are we, Wanderer?</i>

366
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,600
I reckon it's safe enough now.

367
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,700
<i>So many humans alive.</i>

368
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,500
<i>We haven't lost.</i>

369
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,900
<i>Jared!</i>

370
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,900
<i>Jared!
Jared's alive! Jared's...</i>

371
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,500
Enough, Jared.

372
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,900
Jebediah,

373
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,700
I know it's hard.

374
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,600
But we gotta do what's best for everyone.

375
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,900
She's gotta go to Doc's place.
Just like the rest.

376
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,200
Ain't that right, Doc?

377
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,600
No!

378
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
<i>Jamie!</i>

379
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,200
I don't see any tracks.

380
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,500
She didn't fly away.

381
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
This Wanderer is living up to her name.

382
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,200
We find her, we find the resistance.

383
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,200
Melanie?

384
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,800
<i>Wanderer?</i>

385
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,500
<i>They don't know a human can
stay alive in a body.</i>

386
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,700
<i>You can't tell them
I'm in here.</i>

387
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,600
<i>They won't believe you.</i>

388
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,000
<i>They'll think you're
lying to save yourself.</i>

389
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,700
<i>Oh, God.</i>

390
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,300
<i>They're gonna kill us.</i>

391
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

392
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,000
Move aside, Jared.

393
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,300
Get out of the way.

394
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
We can't keep her prisoner forever.

395
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,800
It's gonna escape and lead them to us.

396
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,300
I don't want to hurt you, Jared.

397
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,000
But I will.

398
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
No!
I am what you want!

399
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,100
Stay back!

400
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,600
I am what you want!

401
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,800
Ian! Get it!

402
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,300
Leave him alone!

403
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,200
<i>Keep breathing! Come on, Wanderer!
Fight him! Fight!</i>

404
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,700
Finish it!

405
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,900
Good evening, everyone.

406
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,400
I hate to remind you, but this is
my place, and you are my guests.

407
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,900
For the moment, she is, too.

408
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,100
I don't take kindly to my
guests strangling each other.

409
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Jeb, it's got to die.

410
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,100
We took a vote.

411
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
This ain't a democracy.

412
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,100
It's a dictatorship.

413
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,800
It's a benign dictatorship, but
it's a dictatorship just the same.

414
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,300
You mind telling us what
you plan on doing with it?

415
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,100
This ain't never happened before.

416
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,200
One of our own coming back.

417
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,100
For right now, this tunnel is off limits.

418
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,000
If I find any of you back here,
I'm asking questions second.

419
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,700
I'll take the next watch, Jared.

420
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,700
Keep it away from the kid.

421
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I do not think we are looking for Wanderer.

422
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,100
I think we are looking for a body.

423
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,900
Even if she were not hurt in the wreck,

424
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,200
how long could she survive in this place?

425
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,300
From my experience, this
host has difficulty dying.

426
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,200
There's too much land for us to cover.

427
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,100
I am requesting more Seekers,

428
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,400
ground and air patrols.

429
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,200
Are they really such a threat?

430
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,700
We outnumber them a million to one.

431
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,300
He's still pissed you hit him.

432
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,500
I told him you were sorry.

433
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm not.

434
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,400
I know.

435
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,700
No one's ever sorry for hitting my brother.

436
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,000
It looks like they're calling off the search.

437
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,400
Not that one.

438
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,000
<i>Jamie!</i>

439
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>Little brother.</i>

440
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,400
Do you know who I am?

441
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,800
You are Jamie.

442
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But you're not Melanie.

443
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,500
I want to know what happened
to my sister that night.

444
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,400
She said that she was gonna come back.

445
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,900
<i>he deserves to know
what happened to me.</i>

446
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,900
I'm not a kid.

447
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
Please.

448
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,900
To protect you and Jared,
she tried to take her life.

449
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,100
Our healers mended her and put me in her

450
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,500
hoping I could find out if there
were other human survivors.

451
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Do you have a name?

452
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,600
They call me Wanderer.

453
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,500
Where do you come from?

454
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,100
Another planet.

455
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,400
What the hell?
Damn it, Jeb, I told you.

456
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,500
You never said nothing about
keeping the kid away from her.

457
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,400
Jamie, that is not Melanie!
She's never coming back.

458
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,000
It's still her body that we've hurt.

459
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,100
Get out of here now, Jamie,

460
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,300
or so help me, I'll...
Jared.

461
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,300
I'll look after Jamie.

462
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,200
We'll watch it.

463
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,000
I don't trust it.

464
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,100
Could be another Seeker.

465
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,400
She...
It

466
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,300
is the furthest thing from
a Seeker I've ever seen.

467
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,300
I mean, she jumped between you and Kyle.
They don't do that.

468
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,100
It was trying to find a way
to stay alive and escape.

469
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,200
What, by giving Kyle the
go-ahead to kill her? It?

470
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,300
That's a good plan.

471
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,900
What the hell has gotten into everybody?

472
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,200
It is the enemy.
Don't forget it.

473
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,600
You don't feel bad at all.
I mean, I half killed her.

474
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,600
It doesn't matter.
It's not human.

475
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,900
So we stop acting human?

476
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,600
This is a big planet.

477
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,300
<i>There has been a sighting f
humans in your area.</i>

478
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,400
<i>We are commencing a full-scale
search immediately.</i>

479
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,900
Something, ain't it?

480
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,300
Found this place by accident.

481
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,100
Really, it found me.

482
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,400
I fell through the roof.

483
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Almost died trying to find
a way out of these caves.

484
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,600
There's only one.

485
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,500
No one's found it on their own since I did.

486
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,600
Kept the place to myself.

487
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,400
Good thing, too.
Without this, we're all dead. Right?

488
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,200
Wanderer?

489
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,700
Sound travels in these caves.

490
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,500
Your name is a mouthful.
You mind if I shorten it?

491
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,200
Life's short.
Especially right now.

492
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,400
Mind if I call you...

493
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,000
Wanda?

494
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,300
We get our power from the sun, Earth.
Any place we can.

495
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,400
It's actually an extinct
volcano not quite extinct.

496
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,000
Watch yourself.

497
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,700
Fall in, you're not coming back.

498
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,500
Afternoon, everyone.

499
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,800
It's all yours.

500
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,800
Don't you all look pretty?

501
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,400
You all got your shades?

502
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,100
Yeah, yeah.

503
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,100
Make sure you wear them.

504
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,600
You already look like an alien.

505
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,700
Makes you feel like a human
being again, don't it?

506
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,500
Bad joke?

507
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,700
You have the resources you wanted, Seeker.

508
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,500
I know you must have seen a lot,

509
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
but you ain't seen nothing like this.

510
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,100
Nothing.

511
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,800
Same way the magicians do it.
Mirrors.

512
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,500
<i>And they all said
Jeb was crazy.</i>

513
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,500
<i>How many crazy people
could pull this off?</i>

514
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,800
It's almost ready to harvest.

515
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,600
Can't come too soon.
We sure need the grain.

516
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,200
Everyone here thinks you're going
to betray us to the Seekers.

517
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,600
Makes sense.

518
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,600
Why else would you be here?

519
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,400
What I can't wrap my head around
is what kind of a plan was that?

520
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,900
Walking into the desert with no backup

521
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,800
and no way to get yourself back?

522
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,700
So if, like you say, you weren't
coming here for the Seekers,

523
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,700
why were you doing it?

524
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,800
Then I started thinking, when
they put one of you in our heads,

525
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,500
do we still exist?
Trapped in there?

526
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,300
If our memories are still alive, are we?

527
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,000
You gotta believe some people
wouldn't go down without a fight.

528
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,500
Hell, I know I wouldn't go quiet.

529
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,200
And I've never seen fight like in Mel.

530
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,200
What she'd fight for, more than
anything, is the people that she loves.

531
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,000
I wonder

532
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,900
if a love like that might
play on someone's mind.

533
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,200
Heart.

534
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,600
It might get somebody to do something
they wouldn't ordinarily do.

535
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,000
Maybe you're here

536
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,500
'cause you do actually care
about Jared and the kid.

537
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,700
You.

538
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,300
Wanda.

539
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,300
He sees everything.

540
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,500
He's not crazy.
He's a genius.

541
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,600
<i>I think he's both.</i>

542
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,500
Yeah, I wonder

543
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,400
a lot about a lot of things.

544
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,900
And I'm not the only one.

545
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,500
Care to join us, Jamie?

546
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,000
Uncle Jeb.

547
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,300
How did you know I was here?

548
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,500
Mirrors.

549
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,000
Mirrors! Mirrors!

550
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,100
Help him!

551
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,000
<i>I saw something!</i>

552
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,400
Now, come on!

553
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,700
Help!

554
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,900
<i>I saw evidence of humans.</i>

555
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,600
<i>I see evidence of us.</i>

556
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,000
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

557
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,600
Thank you.

558
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,700
They're gone.

559
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,000
They're gone for now.

560
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,500
Jared and the others are still out there.

561
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Jamie, why don't you take
over guard duty for a spell?

562
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
What do I do?

563
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,600
You just keep an eye on her.
You'll figure it out.

564
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,100
This way.

565
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,000
You can't give a boy a loaded gun.

566
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,200
That's why I didn't.

567
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,800
<i>Where is he taking us?</i>

568
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,100
Aren't you taking me to my cell?

569
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,600
I miss the outdoors.

570
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,100
And I was thinking that maybe
you're starting to miss it, too.

571
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,000
Be real quiet.

572
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,900
Okay. Sit here.

573
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,500
You can open your eyes now.

574
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,100
What stars are these?

575
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,200
I've never seen this constellation.

576
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,800
They're not stars.

577
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,600
They're glowworms.

578
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,200
You have to be quiet or they
get scared and stop shining.

579
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,500
When I miss the sky, I come here.

580
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,200
It's beautiful.

581
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,200
Wanda?

582
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,500
I heard what Uncle Jeb was saying.

583
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,900
He thinks that Melanie might still be alive.

584
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,200
Inside there with you, I mean.

585
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,800
<i>Jamie!</i>

586
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,800
Can that happen?

587
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,200
Does it, Wanda?

588
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,800
Why won't you answer me?

589
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,100
Is Melanie still alive?

590
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,000
Wanda, please.

591
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,600
<i>Forget what I said.</i>

592
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,000
<i>Tell him.</i>

593
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,200
She promised she would come back.

594
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,000
Yes.

595
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,100
Has Melanie ever broken a promise to you?

596
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,000
I love you, Mel.

597
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,600
She loves you, too.

598
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,800
She's so happy you're safe.

599
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,900
Is everybody like that?
Does everybody stay?

600
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,800
No.

601
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,900
Not like Melanie.

602
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,600
She's special.

603
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,800
She's very strong.

604
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,600
She wanted to keep her promise.

605
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,800
She couldn't have kept her promise

606
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,100
if you didn't help her keep it.

607
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,300
Thank you, Wanda.

608
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,200
It's our secret.
Okay?

609
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,900
Good evening, sir.

610
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,900
Can I help you?

611
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,000
I think you can.

612
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,200
Come on, hurry.

613
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,300
You guys all right?
Yeah.

614
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,400
No racing.
Yeah, sure.

615
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,200
It's ready.

616
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,100
I figured it's time
you started earning your keep.

617
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,700
I'll see you both in the east field.

618
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,400
Morning, Jamie.

619
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,400
Wanda.

620
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,900
Come on.

621
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,500
Wanda?

622
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,300
Yeah.

623
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,100
Wanda.

624
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,000
<i>Why is he
looking at you?</i>

625
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,200
<i>Why are you looking at him?</i>

626
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,800
<i>Don't forget.
He tried to kill you.</i>

627
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,300
<i>Did you hear me?
He tried to kill you.</i>

628
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,500
<i>Don't you dare smile at him.</i>

629
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,900
You better take care of that.

630
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,200
There. That one drives
faster than the limit.

631
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,100
<i>Please stop your vehicle
and safely exit.</i>

632
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,500
Fire!

633
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,400
It ain't doing any good.

634
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,300
I don't care! Keep firing!

635
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,300
Don't get caught.

636
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:11,100
Take him out!

637
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,000
<i>Please stop your vehicle
and safely exit.</i>

638
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,200
<i>Switch off your engine
and safely exit.</i>

639
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,800
There are others.

640
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,700
I always liked science fiction stories.

641
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,400
Never dreamed I'd be living in one.

642
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,100
How many planets have life?

643
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,500
<i>Just remember, Wanda,
you're not one of them.</i>

644
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,100
Twelve that we know of.

645
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,800
Four I've never been to.

646
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,800
We've just opened up a new world.

647
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,100
You've conquered 12 planets?

648
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,500
That's not how we see it.

649
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,600
We have always lived by
bonding with another species.

650
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,600
It is how we survive.

651
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,700
We try to live in harmony.

652
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,500
Speed up! Lose it!

653
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,600
No! Let him catch us.

654
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,100
Let's go!
We've got enough!

655
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,600
Let's go!

656
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,800
We almost had them.

657
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,700
Seeker.
This is not who we are.

658
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,500
You have killed a soul.

659
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,900
We have to make sacrifices.

660
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,200
This is a war.

661
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,700
This war is over.

662
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:01,400
The last of the resistance
will die out on its own.

663
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,800
They will become extinct.

664
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,800
But I think there is a war
raging in you, Seeker.

665
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,800
We're going home.
So are you.

666
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,700
You don't know what's going on.

667
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,900
We are losing control.

668
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,500
<i>Wanda.</i>

669
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,900
If you don't mind me asking, how old are you?

670
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,400
Over a thousand of your years.

671
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,400
I have not completed one
full revolution of your sun,

672
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,200
yet I have found that Earth is more beautiful

673
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,400
and harder than any place I have ever been.

674
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,300
I've gotta say, this is the
most interesting conversation

675
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,700
- I've had in forever.
- What is this?

676
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,300
This has gone on long enough!

677
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,800
Out of the way!

678
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,300
- She's not a threat.
- No?

679
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,300
Aaron and Brandt are dead

680
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,000
thanks to the Seeker looking for it.

681
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,400
Almost got us, too.

682
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,300
I'm gonna end this once and for all!

683
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,000
Jared!

684
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,700
You can't!

685
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,400
Why not?

686
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,500
Because if you kill Wanda...

687
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,800
<i>Oh, no, Jamie!</i>

688
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,200
...you'll kill Melanie.

689
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,800
She's still alive in there.

690
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,300
I believe it.

691
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,600
You're all letting it fool you!

692
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,000
Come on, Jamie.

693
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,000
I'm so sorry.
I'll go back to my cell.

694
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,800
No.

695
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,800
This'll blow over.

696
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,700
You can stay in my place.

697
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,300
She'll be safe there.

698
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,600
Mmm.

699
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,400
You tried to kill me
and now you're protecting me?

700
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,700
Strange world, isn't it?

701
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
The strangest.

702
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:39,900
What's wrong with you, Doc?

703
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,800
You want to try? You try.

704
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,300
Wanda?

705
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,300
I just want you to know that I trust you.

706
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,600
And I believe you're telling us the truth.

707
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,700
But I... I gotta ask.

708
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:58,600
What's it like for you and her,
living in there together?

709
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,900
It's crowded.

710
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
Let me know if you need anything.

711
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,600
I'll just be right out here.

712
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,600
<i>I think
he likes you too much.</i>

713
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,700
What is too much?

714
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,000
<i>If I've got anything to do with
it, you'll never find out.</i>

715
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,900
I know it's with you.

716
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,900
<i>Oh, God.</i>

717
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,600
I'm not gonna kill it.

718
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,800
I just want to talk to it.

719
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,000
It's okay.
I will talk to him.

720
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,200
Her name is Wanda,
not "it."

721
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,800
I'm so sorry about what happened out there,

722
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,100
to your friends.

723
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,700
I never meant to hurt anyone.

724
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,800
Wanda,

725
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,500
Jamie and Jeb believe,

726
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,700
Ian, too,

727
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
that Mel is still alive and kicking in there.

728
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,600
<i>I am!</i>

729
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,500
<i>I am!</i>

730
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:04,200
In fact, Jeb has this crazy notion
that you're here for Jamie and me.

731
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,800
You brought Melanie back to us.

732
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,700
I can't believe it.

733
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,000
I don't want to believe it
because her being in there,

734
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,200
trapped,

735
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,900
that makes it so much worse somehow.

736
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,100
But I gotta know.

737
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,600
Is Melanie in there?

738
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,800
<i>Just tell him I'm here.
Tell him I love him.</i>

739
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,600
I'm afraid.

740
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,500
You see, the thing is, Wanda,

741
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,000
I haven't stopped dreaming about Melanie.

742
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
<i>I dream about you, too.</i>

743
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,900
I miss everything about her.

744
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,200
And I would do anything to get her back.

745
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,000
You know what makes this so much harder?

746
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
It's still her body.

747
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,200
If it wasn't for those eyes...

748
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,200
I got to thinking.

749
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,200
If I can't kiss her,

750
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,200
I can kiss you.

751
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,900
<i>What? No!
What is he doing?</i>

752
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,900
<i>No! Stop it!</i>

753
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,500
<i>Stop! Now!</i>

754
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,200
<i>Don't do this!</i>

755
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,300
<i>No! No!</i>

756
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,900
I knew it.

757
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,300
Mel.

758
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,700
You're really in there.

759
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,100
You hit me for kissing it.

760
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,600
Mel, I love you.

761
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,600
I know you can't say it back, but I love you.

762
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,100
<i>So now
he believes it, too.</i>

763
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,100
<i>It doesn't help anyone.</i>

764
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,900
<i>Knowing I'm a prisoner in hee
just hurts them more.</i>

765
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,300
Wanda!

766
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,800
<i>Hide.</i>

767
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,300
<i>Hide! Hide!</i>

768
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,300
Wanda.

769
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,600
Wanda!

770
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,600
<i>Wanda, get out of here!</i>

771
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:40,800
<i>Run!</i>

772
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,600
<i>Run!</i>

773
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,800
Grab my hand!

774
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,100
<i>What are you doing? Let go!</i>

775
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,900
<i>Good! If he dies,
he can't kill us!</i>

776
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,400
No!

777
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,900
Help!

778
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,900
Help!

779
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,900
You're lucky your head's harder
than any rock in this place.

780
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,700
You'll live.

781
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,200
Don't be too sure about that, Doc.

782
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,400
What happened?

783
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,200
<i>Tell him.</i>

784
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,100
It was an accident.

785
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,400
<i>Like hell!</i>

786
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,300
<i>I thought you didn't lie.</i>

787
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:58,800
Kyle slipped.

788
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,200
Sure he did.

789
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,900
If that's what it says happened...

790
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,400
Oh, come on.
We all know what happened.

791
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,800
He tried to kill her.

792
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,900
And for some unknown reason,
she saved his sorry ass.

793
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,500
If it's true, Kyle, you're out.

794
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,700
Did he try to kill you?

795
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,400
It's not saying he did.

796
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,800
You're the one who has to
live under the same roof.

797
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,100
Kyle, I'm warning you.

798
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,100
Don't you even look at her wrong.

799
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,400
I haven't shot anyone in a long time.
Kind of miss the thrill of it.

800
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,200
We gotta get back to work.

801
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,300
Come on, let's go.

802
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,900
Hey, Jeb.

803
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,500
We're going back out.

804
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,100
Too many Seekers out there.
No.

805
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,000
We lost a lot on that last run.

806
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,300
There are a couple of things that I need.

807
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,300
Take Kyle with you.

808
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,900
Come on, Kyle.

809
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,100
And, you,

810
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,100
keep away from her.

811
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,800
You want to take a walk?

812
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,600
Didn't Jared tell you to stay away from me?

813
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,900
Yeah.

814
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,300
<i>This is not a good idea.</i>

815
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,300
You can open your eyes now.

816
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,500
I'm outside!

817
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,500
That really is the sky.

818
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,100
I like you, Wanda.

819
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,500
I like you, too, Ian.

820
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,900
<i>You did not say that.</i>

821
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,200
No.

822
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,600
Not like that.

823
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,900
<i>Get his hands off me!</i>

824
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,000
<i>This can't work.
What are you doing?</i>

825
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Let me guess.

826
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,900
You're of two minds about it.

827
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,000
Is this about Jared?

828
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,300
<i>Yes, it's about Jared.</i>

829
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,300
Melanie is in love with him.

830
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,400
And you?

831
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,500
<i>Tell him. Tell him!</i>

832
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,600
This body loves him.

833
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,500
Since it is now my body,

834
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,100
so do I.

835
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,500
But I also have feelings of my own.

836
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,600
<i>No, you don't.</i>

837
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,100
<i>Wanda, no.</i>

838
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,400
<i>Stop!</i>

839
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,000
<i>You are not going there.</i>

840
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,600
<i>What about Jared?</i>

841
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,700
This is very complicated.

842
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,100
Is there any way Melanie
can give us some privacy?

843
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,300
Look the other way a moment?

844
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,300
Step into the other room?

845
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,600
<i>You wish.</i>

846
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,500
I don't think that's possible right now.

847
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,700
You know,

848
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,400
it's not really me you like.

849
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,900
It's this body.

850
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,300
You couldn't care for me.

851
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,300
If you could hold me,

852
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,500
me,

853
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,500
in your hand,

854
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,000
you'd be disgusted.

855
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,200
You would crush me.

856
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,700
You don't know that.

857
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,400
<i>Wanda! No!
This is so wrong.</i>

858
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,500
<i>You're not even
from the same planet!</i>

859
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,100
<i>I'll do something.
I'll hurt him!</i>

860
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,200
Strange to be in a body
that won't let me use it.

861
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,000
I think you'd better take me back.

862
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,400
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

863
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,700
As you say,

864
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,000
I'm still of two minds.

865
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,100
Okay.

866
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,300
You're angry when I kiss a man you do love

867
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:28,400
and angry when I kiss a man you don't.

868
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,200
It's very confusing.

869
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,100
I am not weak.

870
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,300
I am in control.

871
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,500
<i>You will never win.</i>

872
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,700
Jamie.
Where is everyone?

873
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,600
I don't know.

874
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,500
<i>Why is he lying?
He never lies.</i>

875
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,500
Your leg should be better by now.
You need to see Doc.

876
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,300
I just came from there.

877
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,200
He told me to go and lay down.

878
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,300
I'm going to wash up.
I'll meet you in your room.

879
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,100
<i>This doesn't make sense.</i>

880
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:23,400
<i>What is Doc thinking?</i>

881
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,100
<i>What's more important than
getting Jamie better?</i>

882
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,800
<i>Hold on.</i>

883
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,300
<i>Wait.</i>

884
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,700
<i>Wanda, go back. Go back!</i>

885
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,800
<i>Wanda, don't go in there!</i>

886
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,900
<i>Turn around. Go back!</i>

887
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,700
<i>- Oh, God!
- Enough!</i>

888
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,300
No!

889
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,700
Monsters!

890
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,900
Wait! Wanda!

891
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,700
Wanda!

892
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,700
<i>Wanda! Wanda! Stop!</i>

893
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:19,600
Get out of my head! Get out!

894
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,600
I'm sorry.

895
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,300
You know, there are easier ways to
die than starving yourself to death.

896
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:38,900
Yes.

897
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,000
I could always visit Doc.

898
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,500
What did you expect, Wanda?
You expect us to just give up?

899
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:03,000
This is our world.

900
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,600
We haven't just lost a war.
We're dying out.

901
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
We're trying to get our people back.

902
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,900
What you're trying to do is impossible.

903
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
It doesn't work like that.

904
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,900
All you are going to do

905
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:28,700
is keep murdering more of both of us.

906
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,100
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

907
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,400
I can't stay here.

908
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,000
Not with you slaughtering
my family in the next room.

909
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,100
If you say our way won't work,

910
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,800
I'll tell the boys no more hostages.

911
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,400
It's probably for the best.
I don't think Doc could take much more.

912
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,100
How can I trust you?

913
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,100
I trusted you.

914
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,100
There's something else.

915
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,600
Melanie? Are you there?

916
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:10,100
Melanie, where are you? Jamie is hurt.
I need you. Talk to me.

917
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,600
Melanie, please come back.
I can't do this without you.

918
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,700
Wanda.

919
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,700
I want you to know about

920
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,700
Doc and everything.

921
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,200
Don't worry about that now.

922
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,200
We have to get you better.

923
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,700
You sound like Melanie.

924
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,500
Did Melanie say that just then?

925
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,600
Yes.

926
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,200
Wanda.
I need you to kiss me.

927
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,200
What about Melanie?
Don't worry about Melanie.

928
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,100
No. Kiss me like
you want to get slapped.

929
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,500
What?
Was she stopping you?

930
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,700
No. That's the problem.
We're alone. She's gone.

931
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:36,600
Ever since I told her to get
out of my head, she's...

932
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,300
I'm afraid I've lost her.

933
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,900
She got so angry before when you kissed me.

934
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,800
I thought she'd come back.

935
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,600
Then I guess you'll have to
make her really angry.

936
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,800
Kiss her.

937
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,600
I lost Melanie.

938
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,200
I don't know if she's still there.

939
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:20,300
You need to bring her back.
She hates me kissing you.

940
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,700
Okay.

941
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,600
Melanie, come back.

942
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,300
I will not lose you.

943
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,300
<i>Jared.</i>

944
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,000
Melanie?

945
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,100
<i>Oh. Stop!</i>

946
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,200
Melanie, you bit me!

947
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,600
<i>Wanda, what the hell?</i>

948
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,000
Melanie, I'm so glad you're back.

949
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,100
<i>Did I leave?</i>

950
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,800
For three days.

951
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,600
You don't know what I've
been through to find you.

952
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,300
<i>Yeah, you look like
you were suffering.</i>

953
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,700
We have to help Jamie.
He's hurt.

954
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,300
Come on.

955
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Stop.

956
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,200
Stop.

957
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,700
Where are you going?

958
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,600
It's infected.
It's got into Jamie's bloodstream.

959
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,600
He needs medicine.

960
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,400
There's no medicine out there.
You souls have destroyed it all.

961
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,200
He doesn't need your medicine.

962
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,300
It's too late for that.
He needs ours.

963
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,100
You have to take me out of the cave.

964
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,600
You'll have to trust me.

965
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:11,200
Cut me.
I need a wound like Jamie's.

966
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,100
I can't do that.

967
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:14,000
I'll be healed in minutes.

968
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:22,000
<i>Take it from him.
Do it yourself.</i>

969
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:32,400
They'll be suspicious of this scar.
I can cover it with a cut.

970
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,200
It's gonna be okay.

971
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,400
Excuse me.

972
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,200
Goodness.
We have an emergency.

973
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,300
<i>You can do this, Wanda.</i>

974
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,500
I'm Healer Skye.

975
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,800
What happened?

976
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,400
<i>Tell her you tripped.</i>

977
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,800
<i>Tell her you tripped!</i>

978
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,000
I tripped.

979
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,000
<i>With a knife in your hand.</i>

980
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,100
With a knife in my hand, cut myself.

981
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,800
You poor thing.

982
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,000
Let's fix you up.

983
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,200
Heal.

984
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,200
Seal.

985
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:48,900
If it is no trouble, could
I please have some water?

986
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:50,500
Of course.

987
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,300
<i>Hurry! Take it!</i>

988
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
What do you think?

989
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,500
Perfect.

990
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,800
Thank you.

991
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,000
Goodbye.

992
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,400
<i>What are you doing?
We have to go.</i>

993
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,400
Is he alive?

994
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,000
Barely.

995
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
What is all that?

996
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,500
Medicine.

997
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,600
Wait! No. No.
We don't know what that'll do.

998
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,100
She knows what she's doing.

999
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,000
We all know what will happen if we do nothing.

1000
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,900
He'll die.

1001
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,600
Doc.

1002
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,400
It's okay.

1003
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,900
Please.

1004
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,600
Do it.

1005
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,600
Doc, do it.

1006
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,200
That's it.

1007
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,600
<i>Come on, Jamie.
Open your eyes.</i>

1008
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,400
<i>Please.</i>

1009
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,600
Jamie.
Hey, buddy.

1010
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:05,600
You're getting good, Doc.

1011
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,300
<i>I've walked out of plenty
of stores without paying.</i>

1012
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,700
<i>First time anyone's
been happy about it.</i>

1013
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,200
I liked it better when we were stealing.

1014
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,900
You spoil everything, Wanda.

1015
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,400
No, Wes!

1016
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,500
Hello, Wanderer.

1017
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,200
Seeker.

1018
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:48,000
Why did you waste the medicine on me?

1019
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:51,300
Aren't you going to kill me?

1020
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,300
Can I speak to her alone?

1021
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,100
<i>Does that include me?</i>

1022
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:02,200
<i>I guess it does.</i>

1023
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,200
We'll be outside, Wanda.

1024
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,500
You just say the word.

1025
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,600
Huh!

1026
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,500
Wanda?

1027
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:19,200
Surely, you go by "Melanie" now.

1028
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,600
Did you ask to kill me yourself, Melanie?

1029
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,500
What are you waiting for?

1030
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,300
I'm not here to kill you.

1031
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,100
Oh.

1032
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,600
You're my interrogator.

1033
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:47,300
I do want to know something.

1034
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:52,500
Why?

1035
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,600
Why couldn't you just let me go?

1036
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,600
Because I was right.

1037
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:03,500
I know the threat a weak
soul like you represents.

1038
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:07,100
Unlike you, I am doing my duty.
I am fighting for us.

1039
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,200
We cannot live with them like the other worlds.

1040
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,400
You, more than anyone, know that.

1041
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,300
Did you come alone?

1042
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,100
Other Seekers will come looking for me,

1043
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,500
just like I came looking for you.

1044
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,600
No one else is coming to find you.

1045
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,500
You die, and the danger dies with you.

1046
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,400
The people here will be safe.

1047
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,200
So you are going to kill me.

1048
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,500
<i>Wanda, what is this?
What are you thinking?</i>

1049
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:53,700
<i>Don't put up walls against me.
Talk to me.</i>

1050
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,600
Wanda?

1051
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,900
I never got the chance to say how truly...

1052
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:33,700
There's a way to make up for it.

1053
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,800
what you have been ending
so many lives trying to do.

1054
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,800
I can take a soul from a body.

1055
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:43,400
<i>You can do what?</i>

1056
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,700
<i>What are you saying, Wanda?</i>

1057
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,900
I will only give you this knowledge

1058
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:51,800
on the condition you do as I ask

1059
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,200
and promise that no harm will come to any soul.

1060
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,900
I can promise you that.

1061
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:00,200
There's one other thing you must promise.

1062
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,200
And you must promise to keep it a secret.

1063
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,200
You have to let me die.

1064
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,400
<i>No! No! No!</i>

1065
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,200
I can't do that, Wanda.

1066
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:18,800
I... I can't.

1067
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,000
It's the only way I can give you what you want.

1068
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,600
<i>Wanda.</i>

1069
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,600
<i>No.</i>

1070
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,600
She's out.

1071
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,400
So you don't want us to kill the Seeker.

1072
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:45,200
She killed Wes.
Who knows how many others?

1073
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,000
She wouldn't blink about butchering us.

1074
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,700
There's been too much killing.

1075
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Not death. Exile.

1076
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,900
You want us to forgive her.

1077
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,600
And let them go, just like that?

1078
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,000
Yes.

1079
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,700
We souls can leave the same way we arrived.

1080
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:21,000
I will send her away.

1081
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,500
By the time she reaches another planet,

1082
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:26,500
your grandchildren will have died of old age.

1083
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,900
You have always tried to extract it by force.

1084
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,600
The secret is, you do not remove it,

1085
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,700
it removes itself.

1086
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,800
You coax it out.

1087
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:14,700
You have always seen it as the enemy.
It can feel the hate.

1088
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,900
It can only be captured by kindness.

1089
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,400
Love.

1090
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:40,800
Ian, help me.

1091
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,100
Thank you.

1092
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:45,100
What is your name?

1093
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,500
I'm Lacey.

1094
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:49,800
My name is Lacey.

1095
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:52,100
I've been screaming inside for years.

1096
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,600
Nobody could hear me.

1097
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,100
You're the reason why she
wouldn't leave me alone.

1098
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:00,500
Yes, she wasn't just after humans.

1099
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,700
She was hoping to find a way to fight the hosts.

1100
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,800
Like me.

1101
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,500
And you, Melanie.

1102
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:11,800
Who fight back.

1103
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,500
Have a safe trip.

1104
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,100
<i>And a long one.</i>

1105
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:54,200
<i>Always send the souls to
the most distant planets.</i>

1106
01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:58,200
Wanda?

1107
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Do you miss it out there?

1108
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:06,300
The other worlds?

1109
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:10,600
I miss many things.

1110
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,200
Don't you miss Melanie?

1111
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,600
Don't you want your sister back?

1112
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:20,200
She's here now.

1113
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:23,200
<i>You know he's right.</i>

1114
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,600
Not the way she needs to be.

1115
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,700
I think it's time to move on.

1116
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,200
Leave us?

1117
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,800
Yes.

1118
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:45,000
But you can always come back, right?

1119
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,600
I asked you here so no one would shout.

1120
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,900
<i>I wish I could shout loud
enough for them to hear.</i>

1121
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,600
As soon as I knew what to do with the Seeker,

1122
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,800
I knew there was a way for all of
you to get your loved ones back.

1123
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,200
Without hurting the souls.

1124
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,600
But, of course,

1125
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,200
I knew I had to give Melanie back to herself.

1126
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,800
And leave.

1127
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,900
That can't happen, Wanda.
We need you.

1128
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:40,100
<i>Tell them the truth.
You're not leaving this world.</i>

1129
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:43,100
<i>Tell them what
you're really gonna do.</i>

1130
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,100
Now that you have this knowledge

1131
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,000
of how to extract a soul from a body,

1132
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,700
you can survive without me.

1133
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,300
And what does Mel say?

1134
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:52,000
She's always wanted her life back.

1135
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,200
<i>Don't speak for me.</i>

1136
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:55,800
You're lying.

1137
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,300
I have to go.

1138
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,700
You don't have to decide right now.

1139
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,200
Think about it.

1140
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,000
Promise me you'll think about it.

1141
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,900
You are not leaving me.

1142
01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,200
I can't stay.

1143
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:48,700
But I love you.

1144
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,900
I love you.

1145
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,400
Don't say it like you're saying goodbye.

1146
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:04,900
I love you in every way that I can.

1147
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,300
And I'll miss you the most.

1148
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,400
I miss the future I might have had with you.

1149
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,200
You're willing to sacrifice that?

1150
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,800
Sometimes we have to make sacrifices.

1151
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,700
No, I can't let you go. I won't.
Let me talk to Melanie.

1152
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:24,100
She's not there right now.

1153
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:28,000
She stepped into the other
room, so I can kiss you.

1154
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:29,200
I really can't talk you out of it?

1155
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,800
No. It's time.

1156
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,300
I want to die.

1157
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,800
If you had lived a millennium

1158
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:42,800
always in the body of another, you
might feel the same way yourself.

1159
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:52,000
<i>Wanda, my sister.</i>

1160
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,500
Yes, sister?

1161
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,500
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

1162
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:03,300
Don't you want to be
with Jared? And Jamie?

1163
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:06,000
<i>It doesn't have
to be this way.</i>

1164
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,500
<i>You don't have to die.</i>

1165
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:13,000
<i>You really could go to another world,</i>

1166
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
<i>the way you've been
telling everyone.</i>

1167
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,800
Thank you,

1168
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:24,400
but by the time I got to the closest planet,

1169
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:30,500
you, Jamie, Jared, Ian,

1170
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,500
everyone on this world I care
about would be long dead.

1171
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:43,900
I don't want to go on without you.

1172
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:50,900
I love you, Mel.

1173
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:53,500
<i>I love you.</i>

1174
01:47:55,600 --> 01:48:00,900
<i>You are the purest soul, human
or not, that I've ever met.</i>

1175
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:06,300
<i>The universe will be a
darker place without you.</i>

1176
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,900
Be happy, Mel.

1177
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:18,000
Be happy

1178
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,100
that after living so many lives,

1179
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,200
I finally found something to die for.

1180
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,400
<i>Goodbye.
Goodbye.</i>

1181
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,100
Wanda?

1182
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:11,500
Wanda.

1183
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,600
Wanda?

1184
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:18,500
Wanda, can you hear me?

1185
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,000
Where am I?

1186
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:23,400
Who am I?

1187
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,100
You're you.

1188
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,000
Hello, Wanda.

1189
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,300
Melanie?

1190
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,000
You might want to see yourself.

1191
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:53,300
You still do that with your hair.

1192
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:16,100
Doc, you broke your word.

1193
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:20,700
They broke it for me.
They made me keep you alive.

1194
01:50:20,700 --> 01:50:21,700
But I told you I didn't want to

1195
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,100
take another life in any world.

1196
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:27,700
We've been taking souls out
of humans for a month now.

1197
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:30,800
But when we took the soul out of that body,

1198
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,100
she never woke up.

1199
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,400
The body was dying.

1200
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:36,200
The only way to save her was to put you inside.

1201
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:41,200
You haven't killed a body.
You've given it life.

1202
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:46,200
I miss you in my head.

1203
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:52,100
What are you thinking, Wanda?

1204
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:58,200
I'm thinking how happy I am.

1205
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:27,700
It's a strange world.

1206
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,100
The strangest.

1207
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:41,600
<i>Our world isn't like
the other worlds they came t.</i>

1208
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:43,700
<i>The way they see it,</i>

1209
01:51:43,700 --> 01:51:49,300
<i>human beings
are just so alien.</i>

1210
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:53,300
<i>But if one of them can find a
way to live with one of us,</i>

1211
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:56,600
<i>I wonder.</i>

1212
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:20,800
Seekers.

1213
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:30,500
No one gets taken.

1214
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,500
Everybody out.

1215
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:50,300
Seeker, I can...
Everybody out.

1216
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:53,400
Now.

1217
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,500
Hmm.

1218
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:10,800
Little bright out tonight, is it?

1219
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,300
You're human.

1220
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:31,700
Human.

1221
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:35,800
Mmm-hmm.

1222
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,900
Not all human.

1223
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:47,500
Are you their prisoner?

1224
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,400
Yes.
No.

1225
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,800
I'm not their prisoner.

1226
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:04,600
I'm their friend.

1227
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,600
They're human.

1228
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,300
Human as you.

1229
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:24,400
We thought we were the last survivors.

1230
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:25,900
So did we.

1231
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:30,000
Till we found three other groups.

1232
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,300
Now four.

1233
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,800
Thought I was the only one who switched sides.

1234
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:39,300
I guess you never know where
you're gonna find your home.
