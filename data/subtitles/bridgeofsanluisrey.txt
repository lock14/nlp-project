12:08, East of Bucharest



Hello?



Good morning!



Just a second.



- Who's that?
- It's Jderescu.



Hello?



Hi, Virgil!



Was there something
you wanted to tell me?



You called to ask me
if I've been drinking last night?



The talk show, yes...



Listen, who else is coming?



Yeah? OK.



Anything else?



OK. Got it: honk and I'll be out.



Later!



Rodico!



- Rodico!
- What?



- Where's that damned dictionary?
- What dictionary?



- Of Mythology!
- It's in the bookcase.



- Where exactly?
- Next to the dictionaries.



And the dictionaries...
Where are they?



- They're on the bottom shelf.
- Where's that?



- Did you find it?
- No.



- Look behind the bearded guy.
- Which one of them?



- Aristotle or Plato?
- Hold on a sec...



There it is!



Why not put this one
on the top shelf?



- It looks nice.
- Here!



Your suit's ready.



You've got your socks
and underwear on the couch



And I'll go iron your shirt.
And, before I forget...



Liliana called.



- What did she want? More money?
- No.



She wanted to say
good luck with the show.



Thanks!



I found these papers in the suit
you wore yesterday.



- Here...
Do you need 'em?
- You bet I do. Glad you found 'em!



Hi. Mr. Vasilache!



This is Jderescu calling to confirm
if you can make it to the show tonight.



If you can get back to me,
my number is 321666,



And my office number is 321747.
I repeat, 321747.



The best and cheapest wine,
find it today at Racova Supermarket.



The Tutova Vineyards...



You never get enough
of this fuckin' wine...



You too?



Come on!



We celebrate today
the 16th anniversary



Of the Romanian Revolution
and its magic moments,



When Romanians won their...



Come on!



Wants to turn back time
to 22nd December 1989.



Today "The Issue of the Day" offers you
exclusively a significant debate



About the events of December 1989,
which have changed our lives forever.



The show's host, the well-known
journalist Virgil Jderescu,



Will talk to his two guests
who witnessed the events.



We invite you to watch the show today,
at 3 PM, to find out...



To find out...
What?



I'm gonna get you, bastard!



The damned TV...



You hooligans!



What's this ugly thing doing here?



That's what I kept wondering
last night, when you brought it in.



Did I bring it in?



- Don't you remember?
- No.



Then you don't remember singing
the national anthem. Either.



I didn't sing that!



Then it must've been
Beethoven's 5th Symphony...



Was I shouting?



Not too loud, but enough to wake
half of the neighborhood.



Listen...



I want you to bring your paycheck
straight home today, you hear me?



- I want a real Christmas this year.
- Of course I will!



If you don't bring me all the money,
every single cent...



Do you think I look nice
in this coat?



Don't change the subject!



I know exactly
how much money you make.



You bet!
Even better than I do...



What was that?



I said I'll bring you
the money, okay?



If you don't, I swear to God
I won't let you in!



I have a key!



And I'll tell Ana
what a drunkard you are!



I swear to God
I'll bring you the money!



But please don't tell Ana...



- Now, what shall I wear?
- The black suit.



Black and white? I'll look like
in the Laurel and hardy movies.



Well, then, I don't care. Just
make sure you bring me the money.



I'm gonna have to change
these flowerpots...



Hello!
is this the Grigoriu residence?



May I speak to Mr. Grigoriu?



Virgil Jderescu speaking,
from the TV Station.



Don't you know where he is?



When he comes back,
can you please tell him I called?



I invited him to my talk show,
and I'd like to know if he's coming.



All right, thank you!
Good bye!



Stop eating plain bread!



Mr. Vasilache, it's Virgil again.



Please tell me if you're coming
to my show or not.



You said you were gonna call by 9 AM.
And it's already 9:30.



I beg of you...
I'll be waiting for your call.



Shithead!



They'll turn up eventually, you'll see.
Everybody wants to be on television.



Here you go.



- Did I mention Liliana called?
- Yes.



- She needs another 500 lei...
- What for?



To go to Sinaia for the new Year's.



Didn't I give her money
for the new Year's last week?



Yes, but now she wants,
to buy a pair of skis.



Tell her to go sleigh-riding and to stop
acting like a spoiled big city brat.



C'mon, dear,
all her classmates have them...



You won't fool me again
with your firecrackers.



Come on in!



- Good morning, Mr. Piscoci.
- Good morning, neighbor.



- Come on in. Petrica.
- We're in a hurry, Mr. Piscoci.



Well, you might as well come in.
You know, people talk...



- Good morning, Mr. Piscoci.
- Good morning.



- Come on in!
- Let's go in, but we won't be long.



Stay by me, we're in a hurry.



- Sit down, Petrica.
- No, I really can't stay, Mr. Piscoci.



- I have a favor to ask.
- Go ahead.



How would you like to be Santa Claus
this Saturday at our place?



He doesn't understand these things.
Rica, my brother-in-law,



Broke his legs playing football,
and there goes our Santa.



I remembered you used to do Santa
some time ago.



Ten years ago.



- Do you have a costume?
- No, I don't. The moths got it.



Don't worry about it. I can adjust
rica's for you. He's really fat.



You do that,
and then let me see it.



I'll be back in an hour. OK?




All right.
I got nothing to do, anyway.



Petrica, let's go!
We're in a hurry!



Look. Petrica! Mr. Piscoci has,
a bell for you. Let's go!



I have to go fetch some food to rica
in the hospital and then I'll come back.



What did you cook for him?



Some meat stew and some meatballs my
mother-in-law made. Several quinces...



Have one. Mr. Piscoci!




Thank you!
May your dead rest in peace!



So be it! Petrica, let's go!
We're in a hurry!



Don't forget your bell! You'll need it
for Christmas caroling. Petrica!



We'll talk about the money
when I come back, Mr. Piscoci.



No, I don't want any money.



What's the damage?



The whole tab or just last night?



The whole thing.



Let me see...



I've got Alecu...
Where the hell?
Cornel, Sofronea...
Manescu!



192 plus 48 times 2...
Plus the one yesterday...
326 lei.



- That much? Let me see it!
- You spent 100 lei last night alone.



Cut the bullshit!
I didn't drink champagne, haven't I?



No, you had vodka
and bought rounds for everybody.



Hand me that broom, will you?



Gigi, how many times have I told you
to stop me when I get drunk?



I tried, but it was impossible
talking to you.



Let's see...



Here's the deal...
You give me a bottle now,



I'll go get my paycheck from school,
then come back and close the tab.



- No way, Mr. Manescu!
- Come on, Gigi!



I'm going to this talk show later
and I'm a little nervous.



- What show is that?
- It's about the revolution.



What revolution?



Don't upset me
more than I already am!



Jesus, teach', you drive me nuts!
Want a cigarette?



I should've failed your ass
when you were my student.



OK, here's the deal:
I'll give you the bottle...



But if you don't bring me the money
tonight, I'll come to your place to get it.



Did I give the Chinese guy
a hard time?



Yes.



- Really hard?
- No, just the usual.



I'm so stupid!



You owe me 340 lei...



I don't like this girl at all.
She's too exaggerated.



- Couldn't you find another one?
- Wait a second...



Hello?
is this the Grigoriu residence?



So you recognized me...



But where is he,
for Christ's sake?



Tell him next time
he promises something



He'd better keep his damn promise!



Tell him he's an imbecile



And next time he won't get the chance
to bullshit politics on my show!



- Virgil...
- Fuck him!



- Look at this picture I found.
- What picture?



It's Liliana, at a Christmas party.
See how plumpish she was?



I wonder how old she was...
4...
Yes, she was 4.



- And who's that?
- That's you.



- No! The other guy...
- That's Santa Clause.



- Who was Santa?
- I can't remember.



- Look how happy Liliana was!
- Will you give me that jacket?



There you go.



- I've got no money.
- 500 lei. Dear,



- Will you give me a break?
- Yes.



- Rodico!
- What?



Bring me the phonebook, will you?



- That's red!
- Don't you say so...



It is!



Are you kidding me?
if this is red, I'll kill myself.



- What color is it then?
- It's got spots all over...



- Where?
- All over!



It looks like you've scrubbed floors
with it. What about this?



Is this white? If this is white,
I'll go kill myself a second time...



What do you want me to do?
that's the best I can do.



If I had the money, I'd buy you
a new one. This one will do.



- Do you have a bag?
- What for?



- For the presents, of course.
- You can hold them, Mr. Piscoci.



- How can I hold the presents?
- You just hold them.



God forbid!
Yes! This is him.



Hello, Mr. Virgil!
What a nice surprise!



Yes, I know. I've heard about it,
I watch your programs all the time.



Yes, I did. So what?



Sure I can come.
But can I be of any help?



All right, no problem.
I'll be there.



I'll wait for you, Mr. Virgil.
A quarter to 2 it is!



I live next to the milk factory.



A quarter to 2 then.



Why do you wanna honk?



Yes, all right.
I'll be waiting for you. Good bye!



- This is the best I can do.
- In conclusion. This costume sucks!



Teach' is here!



Good afternoon!



- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon...



Jesus, so did you guys all fail?



Did you all fail
the ottoman Empire final?



Yeah...



What can I do,
if you can't even cheat properly!



You haven't fixed this yet...



Everybody get
a piece of paper and write...



What test will it be
so it won't ruin your holidays?



- What do you know best?
- The French Revolution.



- What?
- The French revolution!



- Do you all agree?
- Yes!



OK, let's begin then!
'The French Revolution'.



Move over!



It's strange how you'd all choose
the French revolution...



Move over!
hi there! Any more classes today?



I'm giving a second exam now.
These guys failed...



Why bother with the exam?
Give them a grade and let them go!



Or they'll take the exam again
over the summer.



- I have to teach them a lesson.
- What lesson?



All they think about now is lighting up
firecrackers on new Year's Eve.



What's the problem, punk?



- So why are you here?
- I'm here for that money.



- What money?
- Manescu...



- The 200 lei? OK...
- It's 270 lei. I'd given you 70 before.



Have they started to cut
our checks yet?



Do you think I'm stupid?
it's before 9 a. M. And you know it.



OK, I'll be right down
as soon as they're done.



Come on, man, I need to get
to the country side today!



I'll be there in half an hour.
Better, in 15 minutes.



OK. Just don't be late!



'the French revolution'?
Give me a break!



Fuckin' elevator!



- Are we gonna see any cartoons today?
- Tomorrow. OK?



What are you doing here?
Come on. Buzz off!




You're swarming all over the place.



Goddamn kids!



What's happening here?
neighbor, what's wrong?



It's these wicked kids!
Pour some water on them, will you?



Damned hooligans!



Aren't you supposed to watch over
things around here?



The rhythm is great, feel its sway,
And it keeps calling me your way.



Dancing is a dream
Feel its heavenly steam



Latino music is my life.



Salsa, cha-cha-cha, or mambo
Who cares you're loser for tango?



Hey! Stop! Stop!



- What are you doing, Professor?
- We were playing a Latino tune.



What's wrong with a Romanian tune?



This is for a Christmas show,
isn't it?



- And you? What are you doing?
- I'm shooting.



You're shooting, holding the camera?



This is the new style, boss.
It's trendy!



Put it on the tripod right now,
or I'll crack your skull with it!



- And you? What are you doing here?
- I broke my... I broke my...



- What did you break?
- My instrument.



Your instrument?
Looky here, he broke his instrument...



Hurry up! We start on 3, right?
Come on, faster!



What are we playing, Professor?



I suggest 'The Ring Dance from Deleni'.
Do you guys agree with me?



No, Professor, that's not right...
We'd better play a stomping dance.



Don't contradict me!



We can't do it anyway,
because he broke his instrument.



You there. Sit down!
now that you broke it...



- Ready, boss?
- Positions, everybody! Attention!



5,4,3,2,1...



- Is this everything you've got?
- You've seen everything else.



Well, what can I tell you?
it's much better than that rag.



- OK, I'm buying it. How much?
- 40 lei.



That's a little pricy...



No! My prices are the lowest
out there.



I know, that's why I came to you.



But it's a little expensive
for the quality of the fabric.



Look! I can drain my soup with
this rag in a couple of years.



And this one! Look at this!
it tears right away, see?



Of course it tears if you pull at it!



You should see the kids
pulling at it!



10,20...
40. That's it.



40 lei. Nothing more, nothing less.



- Shall I wrap it for you?
- No! I'll wear it so I get used to it.



It looks nice,
no doubt about that.



- Good afternoon!
- 'Afternoon!



- Have you got any firecrackers?
- I do.



- How much for a box?
- 2 lei.



- Fanica, what's bothering you?
- Let me be, I'm in a hurry.



- Where are you going for New Year's Eve?
- I'm staying home, as usual.



- Me, I'm going to Dubai.
- Dubai. That's nice.



- I'm going to Busteni with my friends.
- Where's the principal going?



- What's that your business?
- He's coming with me, to Dubai.



- Can I pass through, please?
- Yes, madam.



270...



- Here you go.
- Thanks.



- You owe me 130 lei. As well!
- Yes, madam.



Manescu! 60...



Hello? Vasilache? I'm calling to say
fuck your answering machine. Good bye!



Son of a bitch!



I don't get it. What's the big fuss
about this revolution?



Nobody gives a shit about it,
anyway.



What would you like me to do?



Programs about gas prices going up, or
about gypsy fiddlers? Tell me, what?



I'm going to my sister's
for the new Year's, in Bucharest.



What?



You said you're gonna spend it
with your wife.



- What about my show on new Year's
Eve?
- I'm leaving on December 30th



- No, you can't do that!
- Why not?



Who's gonna do the street interviews,
the newscast, you know...



- The guys can do it.
- What do you mean 'the guys'?



I'll have the show on winter customs
done by then anyway.



I can do the street interviews
before I leave.



And Costel could read the news.



His tongue won't bleed
if he does it, will it?



What about the midnight live
broadcast?



What about it?



- Who's going to film that?
- It's not me, anyway.



- Who's gonna take the live interviews?
- Costel can do it.



It'll be too loud anyway
to hear any questions,



With the firecrackers and stuff...



- No, you're not leaving.
- Yes I am.



- I'm gonna fire you.
- So what?



- Vali, I'm not kidding you.
- Me neither.



I want to go to Bucharest
for the new Year's, and that's that!



Come on, Vali...



Why would you spend the new Year's
in Bucharest for? It's gonna be ugly.



Plus, the streets are muddy there
even when it snows.



It's also very crowded.
You won't like it, you'll see!



And you'll want to come back home...



- Did you say 200?
- Yup.



- Where did you do 200?
- Are you kidding me? Everywhere...



If there's no radars,
then you can go.



- Hello. Mr. Piscoci!
- Hello, Eugene!



Isn't it too early?
it's like three days away.



Well, if you know better than I do...



So, you're saying it rocks, ech?
What about the music?



It's got everything:
condensers, amplifier...



You've got no problem
driving at night.



It's safe, it's got adaptive
headlines for curves...



- Eugene!
- What?



Do you have a light?



No. I don't!
Guys, give him a lighter!



- You bring it back, all right?
- Yeah, I'll bring it right back.



You can start the engine with
your remote control at home!



It's got seat heaters too.



- Seat heaters? That's cool...
- Yeah, it runs good.



It's got those chrome rims I use in the
summer. I use these in winter, though.



- You've winterized them, right?
- Yup!



What're you doing there, man?
What's up with him?



You understand?
it's totally worth it.



- What are you doing, Mr. Piscoci?
- Thanks! Who, me?



- You're acting like a child.
- Look who did it!



Why do you think I turn around?
Dear God!



- Poor old guy! He's senile...
- I told you he was crazy.



Life sucks,
but don't worry about it.



I'm sorry about yesterday.
I really am.



You know, at the bar...
I'm really sorry.



- Why did you come here?
- I came to apologize.



Apologies accepted.



- Listen, Chen...
- Yes, I'm listening.



- I have a favor to ask you.
- You need some money?



Yes, this is the last time,
I promise!



Look, I got my paycheck today
and I used it all up on debts.



This is the last time I'm asking you.
I have nobody else to go to.



You're my only friend.



But I'm not your friend anymore
when you get drunk?



Come on, Chen! You know I don't
remember anything afterwards.



I'll tell you what you said.



You said I should go back to my country,
'cause I'm worse than a gypsy,



'cause I'm a little short bastard,
and 'cause my palate is yellow.



Your palate is yellow?
What's that supposed to mean?



- I have no idea what it means.
- Me neither, but that's what you said.



Chen, if you don't help me,
my wife won't let me in.



- How much do you want?
- 600 lei.



- How much?
- 600 lei. Please...



I'll give it back to you first thing
in January, when I get paid.



I don't have that kind of money.



Come on, Chen! The whole town's
been buying your firecrackers,



And you say you can't lend me 600?



Do you promise to stop that bullshit
when you get drunk?



I promise.



- Can you give me your word for it?
- Yes, you can have my word for it.



OK then.



100,200,250,300,350,400,450,



500,550,600,610,620,630,640...



- It might snow in January.
- Man, the seasons are all mixed up.



Back in the day, the snow was so tall
you could hardly get out of the house.



That's true.



- How long have we known each other?
- How long?



Since I was a student and you
were doing Santa at my school.



Back then they called it
Father Frost!



That's right, Father Frost...



- What school did you go to?
- Number 3.



Number 3...



How did you know it was me?



This one time you messed up
my present.



You gave me a teddy bear
and my mom had bought me a toy gun.



When my mom saw that, she went
to the dressing room to talk to you.



I followed her and I saw you there,
taking your Santa outfit off.



- When did this happen?
- 1965 or '66.



It's been a while...



- I was so mad at you back then...
- But why?



- I cussed you a whole year, you know.
- Why?



You never returned my toy gun.
I got stuck with the teddy bear.



Things like these happen.
We're human...



Don't mind my saying so,
but your car stinks of gas.



- It's diesel, Mr. Piscoci.
- Diesel?



It's a poor old thing.
But it works.



- It's good it doesn't rain on you.
- Or snow on you, either.



Yeah, it doesn't snow on you...



Good afternoon, madam!



Professor?



- It is you, Professor! How are you?
- Hi there, Tibi! How are things?



- I see you bought a Christmas tree...
- Yeah, it's for my folks.



- When did you come back?
- Last night.



- And are you leaving soon?
- The day after tomorrow.



- I haven't seen you in ages, Tibi.
- I don't come home very often.



That means you'll come visit me,
right?



I'll try, Professor.



But there's hardly enough time
to spend with my folks.



- Come on, kid! Try to stop by.
- I'll try.



Here they are.
I have to go.



Happy holidays!
that's if I don't see you around!



Happy holidays!
But I'll be waiting for you.



I'll try to come.



Professor,
do you still play the guitar?



- Do you still play the guitar?
- No, I haven't played in ages.



What's going on, Mr. Piscoci?



Nothing much...
Just stretching my legs.



Is that a nice Christmas tree
or what?



Come on, let's go!



- Hello!
- Hello! When does the show begin?



It won't start in an hour or so.
Get in!



In this case, could we stop by the
market to buy a Christmas tree?



The two of you could help me with it.



We'll get all the Christmas trees
you want.



Now come on, let's go!
that's actually not a bad idea.



- Wanna take the front seat or what?
- Why should I take the front seat?



- Are you coming to the show?
- Are you?



- Yes, I am.
- Come on, people, let's go!



Be sure to take off your hat.



When we're on the air, make sure
not to look at the monitors...



And stop slamming things around,
cussing or talking nonsense.



That's bullshit! Like we'd do
such a thing, Mr. Jderescu?



I had a few morons in my show who said
things that made my hair stand up.



You think people are actually
watching your show?



I have the feeling
nobody gives a shit about it.



You'd be surprised, but the rating
is pretty good. Especially in winter.



- Mr. Piscoci! What's going on?
- My hat!



What are you doing? Come here!
the show begins in a couple of seconds.



- And what am I supposed to do with it?
- Come here! Fuck the hat!



Fucking hat!



- Now what? What are you doing there?
- I'm nervous. Leave me alone!



You're nervous, my ass.
You always do this.



You want me to stay
like a dumb person?



You're unbelievable!



- Give me some of that!
- Cut it out! What's wrong with you?



I'm nervous, too!
this is my first time on TV



Mr. Piscoci,
I thought you were different.



I thought I could count on you.



- Boss!
- What now?



- Is the nose signal still on?
- Yes, it is.



What nose signal?



If an idiot calls
and asks stupid questions,



I scratch my nose
and he cuts him off.



- How are you gonna scratch your nose?
- As usual, how else?



- What if you really need to?
- It won't happen, forget it!



- What if you really must scratch it?
- I'll refrain myself.



Your gas bills must be huge
with all this equipment.



Yes, I pay a lot!



- How much per month?
- Around 1100 lei.



- Are we all set?
- We're getting close, boss.



- Positions everybody!
- Positions...



- Calm down, everybody!
- A thousand lei is a lot.



- Where do I look?
- Into the camera!



3,2,1...



Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen!



As you all know, today is a very
important day for our country.



16 years ago, the Romanian revolution
of December '89 started in Bucharest.



In fact, a new era in Romanian history
began that day.



That's why I'd like us
to go back in time today.



I'd like us to find out whether we,
the citizens of this town,



Took part in this heroic day
in the history of our nation.



Together with my guests today.
And with your help...



You can call us at 321747.
I repeat, 321747.



We'll try to answer a question that's
been bothering me for a very long time.



The question we want
to answer today is:



'Was there a revolution
in our town or not?'



Now let me introduce
my guests today.



I'm gonna start with
Professor Tiberiu Manescu.



Good afternoon!



- On my right here is Mr. Piscoci Emil.
- Emanoil!



- Emanoil Piscoci. Of course. Excuse me.
- Good afternoon!



Many of you will probably wonder



Why we've picked up a topic like this,
after such a long time?



Well, I think that...
According to
great Plato's "Myth of the Cave"



There was a time when people mistook
the sun for a little fire.



I think it is my duty
as a journalist...



Okay, say we got out of this cave,
but what if we got into another,



Bigger cave, where we mistake
the sun for a straw fire?



My point is that there's
no present without a past



And no future without a present.



That's why, I think
the clearer the past,



The clearer the present
and the future.



On the other hand,
as Heraclites said:



We humans can't dive twice
in the waters of the same river.



But I say,
ladies and gentlemen,



Let’s try to dive into the time ocean,



For truth's sake
and for a better future.



So. Mr. Manescu?
What do you think?



Was there a revolution
in our town or not?



Good afternoon!



First, I'd like to thank you,
Mr. Jderescu



For this opportunity to finally
speak out about what happened



In our town during those dramatic days
of December 22nd 1989



So, was there a revolution or not?



I'd also like to say that time goes by,
people forget and it's a great shame.



Yes, that's exactly
what I was thinking.



We all knew,
with the whole country,



What was happening in Timisoara
on December 17th 1989



And we all felt the time had come
for the communist nightmare to end.



A single spark could put an end
to this nightmare,



And could erase this bad dream
from our country's map.



Of course, that spark was to come from
Bucharest, the heart of our country.



Yes, Bucharest. So, you're saying that
there was a revolution in our town.



- There certainly was one.
- Mr. Piscoci, what do you think?



I second Manescu.
There was a revolution in our town.



Mr. Manescu, could you tell us how you
spent your day on December 22,1989?



Yes, of course.



A few buddies and I had spent
the night before



Listening to the Free Europe station
to learn about the events in Timisoara.



We felt this communist nightmare
must end.



And we all decided to go protest
in the town square.



Pardon me for interrupting...
Who were these buddies of yours?



Well, it was the math professor,
Mr. Bastina...



- Who died in the meantime. I think,
- Yeah, he did.



There was also the Romanian professor,
Mr. Vlad Petrescu.



An extraordinary person,
a genius, an original poet...



- But he died, as well.
- God rest their souls!



- And there was also Professor haidu.
- The Chemistry Professor, yes...



Yes, he's in Canada now,
at his son's.



So we all decided
to go protest in the town square.



Weren't you afraid, Mr. Manescu?



Of course we were afraid.
But we felt we had to do something.



- So you all came to the town square...
- Yes.



- Where from?
- From school.



- Had you spent the whole night there?
- No.



We went there to get our paychecks,



Then we went to the town square
to protest.



But you've just said that you had spent
the whole night together.



No...
We first listened to the Free
Europe station, then we went home.



The next morning we came back for
our paychecks, and then went downtown.



Do you remember what time
this was happening?



They were usually start cutting
the checks around 10 AM.



We were in line first at about 10:30 AM.
Then we went downtown...



It must have been 11 or 11:30
when we got downtown.



- So it was 11:30.
- Yes.



What exactly did you do
in the town square?



First of all, the square was
completely empty. Not a soul...



It was as if everything had frozen,
like in this picture behind us.



We got to the town square
and started to protest.



And what were you saying?



We were saying what everybody else
was saying...
'No More Communism!'



'Death to Ceausescu!',
'no More Dictatorship!'



'Timisoara. Timisoara!'



'Come, people, come, we're done,
Ceausescu's gone!'



Anyway, did anything happen?



Nothing really...
I remember that, at one point,



We started throwing rocks
at the City Council windows.



Tell me, did anybody
in the town hall show up?



Nobody.
Not a single devil, as they say.



Unbelievable. And?
You were saying...



Yes...
Then we all decided to break
through the doors of the City Council.



But, of course, they were locked.



Then we decided to break in through
the emergency door but it was stuck.



So we came back. And that's when
the Secret Services guys showed up.



How do you know they were
from the Secret Services?



I just know...
I recognized
one of them. Those people have...



Wait a minute here!
What was his name?



- How's that relevant now?
- It's very relevant.



It was this guy, Bejan. He used
to work for the Secret Services.



How do you know he worked
for the Secret Services?



Everybody knew that! His son,
Sorinel, was a student at my school.



I used to see his father
at the teacher-Parent meetings.



Is that the one who has
the "Bejan and Sons" farm.



- You mean 'firm'...
- Firm, farm...
It's all the same.



OK. So, let me get this straight,
the three of you...



- No, the four of us...
- So it was the three of them.



- Yes.
- So the two of you...



- No.
- You mean the two of them...



It was the four of us
and the three of them!



- Did you know who the other two were?
- No, I didn't.



- Were you there, too?
- No, I came much later.



- All right...
So?
- So what?



- So, what did you do afterward?
- You mean after they threatened us?



Yeah, after...



There was this sort of fight,
this brawl...



- Were you fighting?
- Yes, we were fighting.



But that's not the issue here.
The important thing is...



And who won?



We did.



I think that people who saw us
fighting weren't afraid anymore,



And they all gathered
in the town square.



Lots of people were coming from
the factories, from the main avenue,



From behind the hotel,
from that way, you see?



From the park...



In the next ten minutes
the square was swarming with people.



Mr. Piscoci. We were the first,
to scream out loud:



'Come, people, come, we're done,
Ceausescu's gone!'



Everybody started screaming, 'we won!',
'Freedom! Freedom!'.



The Secret Services people
ran away and...



Just a moment, please.
I somebody on the line? Hello?



- Good afternoon, Mr. Jderescu.
- Good afternoon! Who's calling?



My name is Maricica and I live
in the building across the Town Hall,



Where Mr. Manescu said he was in '89.



- Your name is Maricica what?
- Maricica Dima.



- So, would you like to intervene?
- Yes. I'd like to intervene.



I want people to know that this Manescu
guy, and the other ones he mentioned...



God rest their souls,
only good things about the dead...



Well...
All of them drank like pigs the
whole night at the bar in my building.



The whole town knows what drunkards
they are. They just never get enough.



And now they want people to know
they were revolutionaries.



That's why I called,



To tell you he was drinking
the whole night of December 21.



He should stop bragging
about being a revolutionary,



'cause he's full of shit!



- Mrs. Maricica, mind your language.
- I beg your pardon, I lost my temper.



- Anything else you'd like to say?
- No, that's it. Good afternoon.



How do you respond
to what the lady just said?



What can I say?
What else is there to say?



Is there any grain of truth
in what Mrs. Dima was saying?



What?



I mean the bar,
the drinking all night...



It's not true. We were drinking
on the night of December 22, not 21.



And we were celebrating...



We have somebody else on the line?
I hope it's somebody serious this time.



- Hello?
- Yes, hello!



Good afternoon!
Who are we speaking to?



The name is Vasile Rebegea.



- Good afternoon. Mr. Vasile.
- Good afternoon, sir!



And congratulations on the excellent
idea of having this show,



To bring to light all those things
about the revolution



In our town once and for all.



Thank you.
How can you help us?



I was working as a guard for the City
Council, where the Town Hall is today.



Yes?



I was at work that morning,
in the sentry box by the gate.



- The box is not there anymore...
- Please continue.



It was right by the stairs
you can see in the picture behind you.



Right...



By the head of the
elderly gentleman...



- That's behind you, Manescu.
- No, it's right there...



My name is Piscoci!



Now I remember.
It was right there. Go ahead.



I'd like you to know
that I saw nobody in the square



Doing what the Professor said.
People started coming around 12:30.



They came in tens and hundreds.
They all came in a jumble.



Mr. Vasile, so you're saying you
didn't see those four Professors?



No. Sir. I didn't.



Mr...
Had you been on duty
the whole morning?



Yes, that's right. I went away for
a while but I mostly stood there.



So you went away for a while.
Can I please have...



For about half an hour.
I had to go to the market.



Can I please have this?
the pen, too...



- When was all this happening?
- I couldn't say exactly.



I think it must've been around 10,
maybe 10:30...
Maybe even 11.



- Could you be more specific?
- I couldn't really tell you exactly...



- Listen to him...
- Let's say 11 o'clock.



And what did you go
to the market for?



- What's that your business?
- I just want to calculate...



What do you want to calculate for?



I want to calculate exactly to see
if you were in the box or not.



I don't give a fuck!



- Mr. Vasile, please!
- I apologize.



Why did you go to the market?



I went to buy a Christmas tree, like
all Christians do before Christmas.



- Of course...
Continue, please.
- Did you walk to the market or what?



- No, I took the helicopter!
- Please. Mr. Vasile,




Of course I walked.
What the hell?



15 minutes to the market, 10 minutes
buying the tree, 15 minutes back...



You were gone
for at least 40 minutes.



So what?



Now, did you bring the Christmas tree
along or did you take it home?



What the fuck is it your business
what I did with my Christmas tree?



What is it your business to say
we were not there



If you weren't there yourself?



- Yes, I was.
- You were at the market buying a tree.



- Yes, but I came back.
- When? In a week?



Mr. Vasile, did you bring the Christmas
tree along or did you take it home?



Mr. Virgil, can't you see
it doesn't matter anymore?



When the masses of people started
coming, I was there, doing my job.



I was watching the news on TV
in my sentry box,



And I saw Ceausescu take off
in a helicopter.



Five minutes after that
people started to come.



Nobody came to the town square before
the dictator took off. What the hell?




When Secret Services guys were
chasing us and we got to your box,



You weren't there!



Were they chasing you?
You haven't mentioned that before.



He's lying, sir!



I can't see how you could fit
four people into that little box.



If they were beating you right
and left, you'd have seen how...



- Did they beat you?
- No, they kissed us!



- He's lying, sir!
- You're lying!



OK. Hold it!




So, Mr. Manescu, you said you
were hiding in the sentry box...



We locked ourselves in.



- Right...
When was this happening?
- I don't know...
Around noon.



Around noon...



Mr. Vasile says he was in that
sentry box 8 minutes past noon,



When the dictator left
the Central Committee building,



And there was nobody in the square
at that time.



Not a soul!



Mr. Manescu, could you tell us what you
did between noon and 8 past noon?



I can't remember
if it was noon-noon...



All I know is that, when they started
chasing us, we got into that box,



And the Secret Services guys started
pounding on it for a while.



Then they left, we got out,
and we stayed there!



And did you start the protest
or what?



Mainly, yes...



- You're fucking lying, man!
- You're lying!



- Gentlemen, please, let's not...
- 'Let's not' what, sir?



You'd better tell this liar
to go home and leave us alone



With his revolution!
There was no revolution!



It was much better during
the Dictator's time anyway!



So fuck off
with your fucking revolution!



What can I...
A fucking Communist!



I believe Mr. Vasile raised an issue
that could help us.



Did people start coming before or after
the Dictator left the C.C. Building?



The moment of Ceausescu's departure
is very significant.



It stands for the fall
of the communist regime.



If you'll indulge me,



The C.C. Building
was for the Romanian revolution



What the Bastille was
for the French revolution.



So, then, if people started flooding
the streets after 8 past noon,



It means there was no revolution
in our town.



How do you respond to this?



What I'm saying is that my buddies
and I were there before 8 past noon!



- But some people disagree with you.
- So, are you calling me a liar?



No, but there are some discrepancies
between what you are saying



And what one of our viewers
has just said.



Meaning?



Well, Mr. Vasile said
you weren't there.



Gentlemen, I'm gonna tell you
how things happened...



Come on, Mr. Piscoci.
Sit down.



OK. So, his sentry box was there,
right? And where were you?



I don't know.
Maybe by the statue.



Weren't you by chance
in front of the statue?



Yes, we were. We were in front,
of the statue! So what?



If his box was there and the four
of you were in front of the statue,



He couldn't have seen you...
Don't you see? Think about it!



Let's say Mr. Jderescu here
is the statue.



Can you see me?
of course you can't.



Don't you understand he was
at the market, buying his tree?



He couldn’t have been in his box!



Just a moment.
There's somebody else on the line.



- Hello?
- This is unbelievable...



- Hello?
- Who are we speaking with?



- This is Costica Bejan speaking.
- Well-well!



Good afternoon, Mr. Bejan!



Mr. Jderescu, why are you bringing
people like these on your show



To talk about the holy Revolution



When they have no clue
what's happening to them?



- Please show some respect, Mr. Bejan.
- Are you talking about 'respect'?



You of all people, after you've
invited a drunkard to your show,



Allowing him to trash
respectable people?



Tell me, where were you
on December 22.1989?




First of all, it's Sir to you.
Second of all,



We're gonna straighten things out
some other place, some other time.



- Is this a threat?
- Mr. Jderescu, are you still there?



Yes, I am.




Mr. Jderescu, if any of your guests
ever utters my name on the air,



With all due respect,
I will sue you.



Tell us, where were you
on December 22?



I'm going to sue you, and you'll have
to pay through the nose for this!



I won't have anybody
stain my name and reputation.



I own three profitable businesses,
and 154 people work for me.



- What were you doing on...
- Shut up...



Let me talk!



- Mr. Jderescu, may I continue?
- By all means.



I have three profitable businesses,
and 154 employees.



I've been working really hard since 1989



And I won't let anybody
mock my work.



Mr. Bejan, we're not trying
to mock your work.



All we want is to put together
the pieces of certain events



Which are crucial to our history.



So, what were you doing
on 22nd December 1989?



Mr. Jderescu, please calm down
your guest.



Gentlemen, please! Let's try
to set things straight.



That's exactly why I called.



Mr. Manescu was accusing you of
having threatened him on December 22nd.



This is a lie. I was in my native
village, near Buzau since December 21st.



My mother was very ill
and I was there to help.



Yeah, so you were in Buzau
when you were hitting me?



Mr. Jderescu. This isn't a drunk's,
tale. I have witnesses to prove it.



Yeah...
You guys
always have witnesses!



Just a moment, please!



Mr. Bejan, you were saying that you
were out of town on December 22nd...



- That's right!
- Well...



OK. Tell me, what were you doing
before 1989?



All right, Mr. Jderescu,
I'll answer this question, too.



I used to work for the Secret
Services...
As an accountant.



Accounting is a profession,
a science, even an art,



Regardless of any political system.



The truth is that I knew
he used to work as an accountant...



Accountant or not, did he work
for the Secret Services or not?



I worked for the Secret Services
'cause I graduated the top of my class.



Congratulations!



I was very good at what I was doing
and I've never been ashamed to admit it.



But to say that I was in
the town square on December 22nd,



That's a bit of a stretch.



It's called libel and it is punished
according to the criminal law.



So you say you weren't in the
town square on December 22nd...



I won't repeat myself.
I don't have time for your nonsense.



One last thing...



If you say my name once again and
have no evidence, you'll be very sorry.



I'll close with a plea for
professionalism, Mr. Jderescu.



Stop telling all these tall tales!
Good bye!



- Good bye!
- Good bye!



What a nerve!



Please stop mentioning Mr. Bejan's
name if you don't have any proof.



Now you're afraid
he's gonna sue you, right?



It's not that...



As a journalist, I know you need
evidence for your accusations.



What do you mean, 'journalist'?
Aren't you a textile engineer?



No, I'm not.



Weren't you employed in the textile
industry, back in the day?



This happened a long time ago.
Now I work as a journalist and...



Give me a break
with all this 'journalist' bullshit.



The other guy said he was an
'accountant' for the Secret Services,



And now he's got a firm...



You were a textile engineer,
and now you've got a TV Station...



I think I should be an astronaut.



Let me tell you I'm not very fond
of your ironic remarks.



Why did you bring me to this show
anyway? For nothing?



I beg your pardon.



If you two have things
to straighten out, I can go...



It seems to me our discussion
has reached a rather sensitive point,



And I think we should sum up
our points so far.



So far, no viewer can confirm
what Mr. Manescu said



About the events happening
in the morning of December 22nd.



It seems to me that nobody knows
whether he and his buddies



Went to the town square
before the crowd.



Where was I then?
on the Moon?



I don't really know where you were,
but you have no proof,



No witnesses to confirm
you were there.



- Why is this so important?
- It's very important.



If people started gathering
in the square



After Ceausescu left
the C.C. Building,



It means there was no revolution
in our town.



What was it then?



I don't know,
but it was no revolution.



Mr. Jderescu, let me tell you
how the whole thing happened...



The revolution started
in Timisoara, right?



It then spread throughout
the whole country,



Including this middle of nowhere,
which is our town.



- Yes, so what?
- 'So what'?



Look! Do you know how they turn
the streetlights on?



Do you know how they turn them on
in the evening and off in the morning?



What's this got to do
with the streetlights?



It has...
That's how
the revolution started.



It started in Timisoara,
then in Bucharest. Then in our town,




What's the revolution got to do
with streetlights?



Can't you see?



That's exactly the same way
they turn on the streetlights:



First. In center. Then,
throughout the whole town,



To the last wretched street.



Mr. Piscoci, I'm sorry to tell you,
but this is nonsense.



What do you mean 'nonsense'?



What has electricity got to do
with the revolution?



It has a great deal! 'Cause people
in our town are cowards...



They took to the streets only after
they saw the Dictator left Bucharest.



- Is that what you did?
- Yes.



When I saw it started
in Bucharest, I went out, as well.



Mr. Manescu here claims
he went out before...



He may have been there before,
but I went out after...



How is this a revolution



If people took to the streets
after the danger was over?



We did what we could.
We had a revolution our own way.



I think we can now go to commercials.



Then we'll continue to try to answer
the question of our show today:



'Was there a revolution
in our town or not?'



Let's go to commercials now.



Commercials, please!



How dare you to call me a textile
engineer on the air, on MY show?



How dare you to say I wasn't there?



Do you have any idea how hard
it's been to set this station up?



How much shit I had to take
from all the crazies around?



How much stress it was?



And now you come to my show
to teach me a lesson...



- Mr. Piscoci, what are you doing?
- I'm going to the men's room.



Come back quickly.
We start in 5 minutes.



- Where is it?
- Down the hall, to your right.



- Now what?
- I'm leaving.



- You don't need me here.
- You can't just up and leave!



If you keep saying I'm a liar,
I'm out!



I didn't say you're lying!



I just said what
the others were saying,



About you not being in the square...



If you're leaving now,
it's obvious you're lying!



Boss, are we gonna finish
this show or what?



Who taught you to film like this?
if you touch that camera again,



I'm gonna crack your skull with it,
with both of them!



It's 'cause these tripods
doesn't work, boss.



'the tripods doesn't work...



First you try your hand here,
I teach you everything,



And then you all leave me
to go to Bucharest!



You goddamn morons...



5,4,3,2,1...



Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen!



Even though heraclites used to say



That we can't dive twice into
the waters of the same river,



I'd like us to dive, again,
into history's ocean, 16 years ago,



For truth's sake
and for the sake of all of us.



The theme of our show today is:



'Was there a revolution
in our town or not?'



First, let me remind you
that our phone number is 321747.



I repeat, 321747.



Allow me to introduce our guests
to you again.



- I'll start with Mr. Emanoil Piscoci.
- Good afternoon.



Can we see the guests now?
thanks!



Mr. Emanoil Piscoci is on my right and
Professor Tiberiu Manescu, on my left.



Good afternoon.



It seems we have somebody
on the line...



As they say, 'Vox populi, vox dei',
so let's get straight to business.



- Good afternoon!
- Hello, this is Gelu isarescu speaking.



'Afternoon, Gelu!
how are you?



Good evening,
'cause it's getting dark.



Why did you call us?



It's about this revolution thing,
Mr. Jidarescu.



Let's hear it.



Mr. Jidarescu, I've worked in sales my
whole life and I'm a respected person.



Mr. Manescu and you know me...



And I've known Mr. Piscoci since
he used to do Santa for the kids!



- Hello. Gelu!
- Go on...



So I know you all,
and I know Mr. Bejan, as well.



And I don't want to lie to you,
gentlemen.



I think there was no revolution
in our town.



Mr. Gelu, have you been watching
our show so far?



No, why?



Did we lose the connection?
We are very sorry.



Anybody else on the line?
Good evening!



Good evening!
My name is Ion Costachescu.



- So. Mr. Costachescu,
- Look, Mr. Jderescu...



On 22nd December 1989 I was
driving back from the countryside.



I had visited my parents to slaughter
the pig for Christmas...



When I left their village,
Muntenii de Jos. Where I was born.



I saw I had a flat tire
on the rear left.



But I said to myself, home is
only 7 km away, I can make it.



But you didn't make it...



No, because of the heavy cargo:
the pig, the wine, the Christmas tree...



Keep going, we're listening.



To cut it short, I had a puncture
right in the town square.



- What time was this happening?
- Three past noon.



- Sharp?
- Yes!



I remember clearly, as I looked
at the clock downtown.



Was there anybody in the square
when you arrived?



No, there was nobody there.



And I must've waited there
for half an hour or so



Before people started coming.
And the guard was right...



People started coming all at once,



And the square was full
in the next 10 minutes.



So you haven't seen Mr. Manescu and
the other professors in the square?



I saw nobody. And I was looking
around, hoping to find somebody.



I had left my jack at home,
so there'd be more room in the trunk.



I see...



Once in a while I'd see somebody
walk down the street,



But they were all walking fast,
like they were on dope.



- What did you do then?
- You mean. About the flat tire?




Yes.



One of my work buddies was living
in that tall building



Across the town square,
and I borrowed his jack.



In this case
you must have been gone for a while...



No. 'cause I shouted his name,
out loud...



As his windows faced the square, he
heard me and came down with the jack.



How could I leave my car unattended?
They'd have stolen everything...



I see.
Thank you, Mr. Costachescu.



Was there anything else
you wanted to add?



No, that's all I had to say. I thought
it may be helpful to your discussion.



- Thank you.
- Thank you! Happy Holidays!



- Happy holidays!
- Happy holidays!



Happy holidays!



Mr. Manescu, another question
begs an answer



Following this gentleman's call...



Were you in the town square or not
on 22nd December 1989?



I was...



Well, see, everybody's been saying
the opposite.



- And I'm saying I was there!
- Mr. Manescu, look...



One, two, three, four...



Four of our viewers said
they didn't seen you there.



The first lady who called
didn't say I wasn't there.



She only said I'd been drinking
at the bar.



OK! What about the other three?



Who?
that former Secret Services guy?



Let us not say his name again
on this show, please.



Of course he'll say I wasn't there,
after the beating he gave me.



OK then...
What about
Vasile rebegea's story?



We haven't established if he
returned from the market or not.



What about Costachescu?



Gentlemen, please,
put those fucking figures aside!



God forgive me for using such foul
language before the blessed holidays.



The town square clock
has been slow



Ever since they perched it there,
in the tower.



Why are you splitting hairs now?



Do we still have a cameraman
on this show?



Can I have at least one close-up?



Thanks!



We have somebody else on the line?



- Hello!
- Hello!



- Good evening! Who's calling?
- This is Chen Xiao Chuan.



- The Chinese guy?
- Yeah, that's me.



Don't tell me you were involved
in the revolution...



No, I was in Egypt
when it happened.



- Where were you?
- In Egypt.



All right.
Why have you called?



I've called to tell you that I've known
Mr. Manescu for a long time.



He's a dependable person,
not a liar.



- Is this why you called?
- Yes...



I'd like to add that Mr. Manescu



Is the kindest person I've known
in your town.



And, like any human being,
he has his imperfections...



But this is no reason for people to
slander him, just because he drinks.



First of all,



I don't think the Romanian revolution
is any of your business.



Second of all, why the hell
are you selling firecrackers



And fireworks to children?



I sell what sells.



Yeah? Anything else
you'd like to add?



No, this is all I wanted to say.
Mr. Manescu is...



I was asking if you wanted to add
anything else, not to repeat...



No. That's all.



- Good bye, then!
- Good bye!



And it's a shame to slander a person
as honest and smart as Mr. Manescu.



What are you doing?
Are you teaching us lessons now?



No, I'm just saying that this is what
I don't like about you, Romanians,



That you're slandering each other
all the time.



Chen, if you don't like it here,



Why don't you go back to China
and leave us alone?



You come to our town, you cash on our
citizens, and now you're being smart?



I'm not being smart or anything...
What I say is what I see.



This guy has got
no grain of decency left.



Well, I can see I'm talking
to myself here. Good bye!



He cut me off!
I can't believe it!



He didn't cut you off.
He did say 'good-bye'.



But he cut me off!



So, Mr. Manescu,



Were you in the town square in the
morning of 22nd December 1989 or not?



Yes, I was.



Despite what everybody else
is saying?



Yeah, I'm saying I was there.



- Everybody else is lying then?
- I don't give a damn what people say.



I'm saying I was there,
and that's that!



- Were you there before 8 past noon?
- Yes.



- And you kept on protesting?
- Yes, we did.



Is there anyone else on the line?



Mr. Manescu, were you there
before 8 past noon?



Yes.



Were you?



Congratulations!



Mr. Piscoci, what were you doing
on 22nd December 1989?



Shall I start with the beginning
or when I got to the town square?



Start with the beginning...



Well, I got up
in the morning around 7...



No, back then I was still getting up
at half past six...



I shaved. And then,




Go on...



Anyway, I quarreled with my wife.
The moron that I was!



Then I went to work,
but I didn't feel like staying.



I felt bad about fighting with Maria.
I had overreacted a bit.



I've always been a very jealous type.
I was jealous even at 60...



In any case, that's what I think
brought her closer to the grave...



I told my boss I needed to go



And I went to the market
to buy her some flowers.



But there was nobody there. Everywhere
I went everything seemed so deserted...



I didn't feel like going home like this,
I felt guilty about the whole thing.



But God showed me the right way...
I went to the Botanical Garden,



Where I broke this window and stole
three magnificent magnolias.



Then I returned home. Maria was
at home, cleaning the place...



I gave her the flowers,
but she said nothing, not a word.



She kept working
as if nothing had happened.



But I looked at her through
the mirror on the dresser



And I saw her faint smile.



I liked that smile...
She must have
liked the flowers, I thought.



But she didn't say a word. She wanted
me to see she didn't give a damn.



Then I turned on the TV To show her
I didn't give a damn, either.



They had those movies like Laurel
and hardy, or Tom and Jerry...



Am I boring you?
- No, keep going.



And I was enjoying both Laurel
and hardy, and Tom and Jerry...



But then Ceausescu came on the tube
and he began this speech...



He promised to give us



I told Maria that,
if he gave us 100 lei apiece,



We could go to the seaside
in Mangalia for our summer vacation.



She said she doubted both me
and the Dictator...



The transmission stopped
all of a sudden.



But we kept planning
for our vacation...



We thought that, if we went to
Mangalia and could save some money,



We could go to the Adamclisi monument,
and take some pictures there.



She said I should give her my word
for it and I did.



The transmission resumed and all kinds
of people showed up on TV



Saying the revolutionaries had won.
Maria started crying with joy,



But I was sorry for the Ceausescu's



So Mr. Piscoci, you went out after you
saw on the TV what was going on...



- I'm boring you, right?
- No...



Yes, I went out to the square
to show Maria I could be a hero.



And that I wasn't afraid
of the Communists.



- So you went out after 8 past noon.
- Yes, that's right.



Our show is coming to an end...



Do we have another phone call?
hello?



Hello! My name is Tina.



My eldest son died on 23rd December,
1989, in Otopeni, Bucharest.



I'm very sorry, madam.



But we are trying to find out what
happened in our town, not in Bucharest.



Well, I'm not calling
to contradict you, Mr. Jderescu.



I'm just calling to say
that it began snowing.



- It began snowing?
- Yes.



It's snowing like in the good old days.
Enjoy the snow, gentlemen!



The streets will be muddy again
tomorrow! Merry Christmas, everybody!



Merry Christmas!



Our show has come to an end.
Anything else you'd like to add?



No...



Ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for watching. Good bye.



You want me to give you
a lift home?



- No, I'll walk home.
- Me, too.



Boss, this is Vali's...



Come here to give you
the Christmas trees.



I should've let the old guy
make his Zillion paper boats,



And the other guy eat
his paper rumples.



But, no, I had to step like a fool
in front of the camera...



From now on, I'm behind it,
I'll keep it fixed,



And then they'll have to break
their necks to fit into the frame...



5,4,3,2,1...



Come on, man, I'm freezing,
let's move.



The old guy didn't have a clue.



They invented
the photo-electric cell,



And now the lights are turned on
all at once.



Come on!



Are you messing with me?
I should have broken you!



Good job, man!



Peaceful and nice...



That's all I remember
about the revolution.



It was peaceful and nice.
