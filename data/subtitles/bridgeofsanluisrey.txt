00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,400
12:08, East of Bucharest

2
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,480
Hello?

3
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,320
Good morning!

4
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,600
Just a second.

5
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,400
- Who's that?
- It's Jderescu.

6
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
Hello?

7
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,080
Hi, Virgil!

8
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,600
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

9
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,080
You called to ask me
if I've been drinking last night?

10
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,480
The talk show, yes...

11
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,800
Listen, who else is coming?

12
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,640
Yeah? OK.

13
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Anything else?

14
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,440
OK. Got it: honk and I'll be out.

15
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,080
Later!

16
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,640
Rodico!

17
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
- Rodico!
- What?

18
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,320
- Where's that damned dictionary?
- What dictionary?

19
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,480
- Of Mythology!
- It's in the bookcase.

20
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,120
- Where exactly?
- Next to the dictionaries.

21
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,360
And the dictionaries...
Where are they?

22
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,240
- They're on the bottom shelf.
- Where's that?

23
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,680
- Did you find it?
- No.

24
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,000
- Look behind the bearded guy.
- Which one of them?

25
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,360
- Aristotle or Plato?
- Hold on a sec...

26
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,800
There it is!

27
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,880
Why not put this one
on the top shelf?

28
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
- It looks nice.
- Here!

29
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,920
Your suit's ready.

30
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,120
You've got your socks
and underwear on the couch

31
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,000
And I'll go iron your shirt.
And, before I forget...

32
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Liliana called.

33
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,240
- What did she want? More money?
- No.

34
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,440
She wanted to say
good luck with the show.

35
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,480
Thanks!

36
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,480
I found these papers in the suit
you wore yesterday.

37
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:10,600
- Here...
Do you need 'em?
- You bet I do. Glad you found 'em!

38
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,240
Hi. Mr. Vasilache!

39
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,040
This is Jderescu calling to confirm
if you can make it to the show tonight.

40
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,920
If you can get back to me,
my number is 321666,

41
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,000
And my office number is 321747.
I repeat, 321747.

42
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,120
The best and cheapest wine,
find it today at Racova Supermarket.

43
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,320
The Tutova Vineyards...

44
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,000
You never get enough
of this fuckin' wine...

45
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,800
You too?

46
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
Come on!

47
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,360
We celebrate today
the 16th anniversary

48
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,120
Of the Romanian Revolution
and its magic moments,

49
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,440
When Romanians won their...

50
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,920
Come on!

51
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,240
Wants to turn back time
to 22nd December 1989.

52
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,760
Today "The Issue of the Day" offers you
exclusively a significant debate

53
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:44,680
About the events of December 1989,
which have changed our lives forever.

54
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,560
The show's host, the well-known
journalist Virgil Jderescu,

55
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,880
Will talk to his two guests
who witnessed the events.

56
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:59,000
We invite you to watch the show today,
at 3 PM, to find out...

57
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,240
To find out...
What?

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm gonna get you, bastard!

59
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
The damned TV...

60
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,200
You hooligans!

61
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
What's this ugly thing doing here?

62
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,920
That's what I kept wondering
last night, when you brought it in.

63
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,760
Did I bring it in?

64
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,800
- Don't you remember?
- No.

65
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,240
Then you don't remember singing
the national anthem. Either.

66
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
I didn't sing that!

67
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,120
Then it must've been
Beethoven's 5th Symphony...

68
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,800
Was I shouting?

69
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,160
Not too loud, but enough to wake
half of the neighborhood.

70
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,000
Listen...

71
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,120
I want you to bring your paycheck
straight home today, you hear me?

72
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,120
- I want a real Christmas this year.
- Of course I will!

73
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,040
If you don't bring me all the money,
every single cent...

74
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,040
Do you think I look nice
in this coat?

75
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,680
Don't change the subject!

76
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,680
I know exactly
how much money you make.

77
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,240
You bet!
Even better than I do...

78
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,920
What was that?

79
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,920
I said I'll bring you
the money, okay?

80
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
If you don't, I swear to God
I won't let you in!

81
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,480
I have a key!

82
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,000
And I'll tell Ana
what a drunkard you are!

83
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,760
I swear to God
I'll bring you the money!

84
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,240
But please don't tell Ana...

85
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,880
- Now, what shall I wear?
- The black suit.

86
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,120
Black and white? I'll look like
in the Laurel and hardy movies.

87
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Well, then, I don't care. Just
make sure you bring me the money.

88
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,960
I'm gonna have to change
these flowerpots...

89
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,600
Hello!
is this the Grigoriu residence?

90
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,360
May I speak to Mr. Grigoriu?

91
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,720
Virgil Jderescu speaking,
from the TV Station.

92
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,840
Don't you know where he is?

93
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,840
When he comes back,
can you please tell him I called?

94
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,360
I invited him to my talk show,
and I'd like to know if he's coming.

95
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,120
All right, thank you!
Good bye!

96
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,200
Stop eating plain bread!

97
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,360
Mr. Vasilache, it's Virgil again.

98
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,000
Please tell me if you're coming
to my show or not.

99
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,000
You said you were gonna call by 9 AM.
And it's already 9:30.

100
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,080
I beg of you...
I'll be waiting for your call.

101
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Shithead!

102
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,520
They'll turn up eventually, you'll see.
Everybody wants to be on television.

103
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,200
Here you go.

104
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
- Did I mention Liliana called?
- Yes.

105
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,360
- She needs another 500 lei...
- What for?

106
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,840
To go to Sinaia for the new Year's.

107
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
Didn't I give her money
for the new Year's last week?

108
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,360
Yes, but now she wants,
to buy a pair of skis.

109
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,240
Tell her to go sleigh-riding and to stop
acting like a spoiled big city brat.

110
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,920
C'mon, dear,
all her classmates have them...

111
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,560
You won't fool me again
with your firecrackers.

112
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,760
Come on in!

113
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,480
- Good morning, Mr. Piscoci.
- Good morning, neighbor.

114
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,280
- Come on in. Petrica.
- We're in a hurry, Mr. Piscoci.

115
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Well, you might as well come in.
You know, people talk...

116
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,360
- Good morning, Mr. Piscoci.
- Good morning.

117
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,240
- Come on in!
- Let's go in, but we won't be long.

118
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,120
Stay by me, we're in a hurry.

119
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,280
- Sit down, Petrica.
- No, I really can't stay, Mr. Piscoci.

120
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,360
- I have a favor to ask.
- Go ahead.

121
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,480
How would you like to be Santa Claus
this Saturday at our place?

122
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,960
He doesn't understand these things.
Rica, my brother-in-law,

123
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,360
Broke his legs playing football,
and there goes our Santa.

124
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,600
I remembered you used to do Santa
some time ago.

125
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,000
Ten years ago.

126
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,720
- Do you have a costume?
- No, I don't. The moths got it.

127
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,360
Don't worry about it. I can adjust
rica's for you. He's really fat.

128
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,000
You do that,
and then let me see it.

129
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,600
I'll be back in an hour. OK?


130
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,480
All right.
I got nothing to do, anyway.

131
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,720
Petrica, let's go!
We're in a hurry!

132
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,520
Look. Petrica! Mr. Piscoci has,
a bell for you. Let's go!

133
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,520
I have to go fetch some food to rica
in the hospital and then I'll come back.

134
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,280
What did you cook for him?

135
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,120
Some meat stew and some meatballs my
mother-in-law made. Several quinces...

136
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,600
Have one. Mr. Piscoci!


137
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,840
Thank you!
May your dead rest in peace!

138
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So be it! Petrica, let's go!
We're in a hurry!

139
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't forget your bell! You'll need it
for Christmas caroling. Petrica!

140
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,520
We'll talk about the money
when I come back, Mr. Piscoci.

141
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,840
No, I don't want any money.

142
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,840
What's the damage?

143
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
The whole tab or just last night?

144
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,040
The whole thing.

145
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,360
Let me see...

146
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,480
I've got Alecu...
Where the hell?
Cornel, Sofronea...
Manescu!

147
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,600
192 plus 48 times 2...
Plus the one yesterday...
326 lei.

148
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,880
- That much? Let me see it!
- You spent 100 lei last night alone.

149
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,360
Cut the bullshit!
I didn't drink champagne, haven't I?

150
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,880
No, you had vodka
and bought rounds for everybody.

151
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
Hand me that broom, will you?

152
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,720
Gigi, how many times have I told you
to stop me when I get drunk?

153
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,560
I tried, but it was impossible
talking to you.

154
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,520
Let's see...

155
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,000
Here's the deal...
You give me a bottle now,

156
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,360
I'll go get my paycheck from school,
then come back and close the tab.

157
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,480
- No way, Mr. Manescu!
- Come on, Gigi!

158
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,240
I'm going to this talk show later
and I'm a little nervous.

159
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,360
- What show is that?
- It's about the revolution.

160
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,240
What revolution?

161
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,520
Don't upset me
more than I already am!

162
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
Jesus, teach', you drive me nuts!
Want a cigarette?

163
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,200
I should've failed your ass
when you were my student.

164
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,120
OK, here's the deal:
I'll give you the bottle...

165
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:43,600
But if you don't bring me the money
tonight, I'll come to your place to get it.

166
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,120
Did I give the Chinese guy
a hard time?

167
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,600
Yes.

168
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,000
- Really hard?
- No, just the usual.

169
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,280
I'm so stupid!

170
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,000
You owe me 340 lei...

171
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,400
I don't like this girl at all.
She's too exaggerated.

172
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,280
- Couldn't you find another one?
- Wait a second...

173
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,480
Hello?
is this the Grigoriu residence?

174
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,240
So you recognized me...

175
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,600
But where is he,
for Christ's sake?

176
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,880
Tell him next time
he promises something

177
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,840
He'd better keep his damn promise!

178
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,960
Tell him he's an imbecile

179
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,400
And next time he won't get the chance
to bullshit politics on my show!

180
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,960
- Virgil...
- Fuck him!

181
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,240
- Look at this picture I found.
- What picture?

182
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,760
It's Liliana, at a Christmas party.
See how plumpish she was?

183
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,880
I wonder how old she was...
4...
Yes, she was 4.

184
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
- And who's that?
- That's you.

185
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,760
- No! The other guy...
- That's Santa Clause.

186
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,480
- Who was Santa?
- I can't remember.

187
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:18,520
- Look how happy Liliana was!
- Will you give me that jacket?

188
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,800
There you go.

189
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,240
- I've got no money.
- 500 lei. Dear,

190
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,120
- Will you give me a break?
- Yes.

191
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
- Rodico!
- What?

192
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,960
Bring me the phonebook, will you?

193
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,960
- That's red!
- Don't you say so...

194
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,520
It is!

195
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,840
Are you kidding me?
if this is red, I'll kill myself.

196
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,760
- What color is it then?
- It's got spots all over...

197
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
- Where?
- All over!

198
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,960
It looks like you've scrubbed floors
with it. What about this?

199
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Is this white? If this is white,
I'll go kill myself a second time...

200
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,480
What do you want me to do?
that's the best I can do.

201
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,240
If I had the money, I'd buy you
a new one. This one will do.

202
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,640
- Do you have a bag?
- What for?

203
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,040
- For the presents, of course.
- You can hold them, Mr. Piscoci.

204
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,240
- How can I hold the presents?
- You just hold them.

205
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,720
God forbid!
Yes! This is him.

206
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,600
Hello, Mr. Virgil!
What a nice surprise!

207
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:39,160
Yes, I know. I've heard about it,
I watch your programs all the time.

208
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,480
Yes, I did. So what?

209
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,280
Sure I can come.
But can I be of any help?

210
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,600
All right, no problem.
I'll be there.

211
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,240
I'll wait for you, Mr. Virgil.
A quarter to 2 it is!

212
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,720
I live next to the milk factory.

213
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,440
A quarter to 2 then.

214
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,480
Why do you wanna honk?

215
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,800
Yes, all right.
I'll be waiting for you. Good bye!

216
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:27,240
- This is the best I can do.
- In conclusion. This costume sucks!

217
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,160
Teach' is here!

218
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,440
Good afternoon!

219
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,560
- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon...

220
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,200
Jesus, so did you guys all fail?

221
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,720
Did you all fail
the ottoman Empire final?

222
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,840
Yeah...

223
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,840
What can I do,
if you can't even cheat properly!

224
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,520
You haven't fixed this yet...

225
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,120
Everybody get
a piece of paper and write...

226
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,320
What test will it be
so it won't ruin your holidays?

227
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,640
- What do you know best?
- The French Revolution.

228
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,360
- What?
- The French revolution!

229
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,320
- Do you all agree?
- Yes!

230
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,880
OK, let's begin then!
'The French Revolution'.

231
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Move over!

232
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,840
It's strange how you'd all choose
the French revolution...

233
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,280
Move over!
hi there! Any more classes today?

234
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,920
I'm giving a second exam now.
These guys failed...

235
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,760
Why bother with the exam?
Give them a grade and let them go!

236
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,840
Or they'll take the exam again
over the summer.

237
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,800
- I have to teach them a lesson.
- What lesson?

238
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,720
All they think about now is lighting up
firecrackers on new Year's Eve.

239
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,880
What's the problem, punk?

240
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,960
- So why are you here?
- I'm here for that money.

241
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,000
- What money?
- Manescu...

242
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:24,040
- The 200 lei? OK...
- It's 270 lei. I'd given you 70 before.

243
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,040
Have they started to cut
our checks yet?

244
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,400
Do you think I'm stupid?
it's before 9 a. M. And you know it.

245
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,400
OK, I'll be right down
as soon as they're done.

246
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,840
Come on, man, I need to get
to the country side today!

247
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,840
I'll be there in half an hour.
Better, in 15 minutes.

248
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,840
OK. Just don't be late!

249
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,680
'the French revolution'?
Give me a break!

250
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
Fuckin' elevator!

251
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,800
- Are we gonna see any cartoons today?
- Tomorrow. OK?

252
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,000
What are you doing here?
Come on. Buzz off!


253
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,440
You're swarming all over the place.

254
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,160
Goddamn kids!

255
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,640
What's happening here?
neighbor, what's wrong?

256
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,560
It's these wicked kids!
Pour some water on them, will you?

257
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,240
Damned hooligans!

258
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,640
Aren't you supposed to watch over
things around here?

259
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:59,200
The rhythm is great, feel its sway,
And it keeps calling me your way.

260
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,240
Dancing is a dream
Feel its heavenly steam

261
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,320
Latino music is my life.

262
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Salsa, cha-cha-cha, or mambo
Who cares you're loser for tango?

263
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,520
Hey! Stop! Stop!

264
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,920
- What are you doing, Professor?
- We were playing a Latino tune.

265
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,760
What's wrong with a Romanian tune?

266
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,240
This is for a Christmas show,
isn't it?

267
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,280
- And you? What are you doing?
- I'm shooting.

268
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,840
You're shooting, holding the camera?

269
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
This is the new style, boss.
It's trendy!

270
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,720
Put it on the tripod right now,
or I'll crack your skull with it!

271
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,960
- And you? What are you doing here?
- I broke my... I broke my...

272
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,800
- What did you break?
- My instrument.

273
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,240
Your instrument?
Looky here, he broke his instrument...

274
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
Hurry up! We start on 3, right?
Come on, faster!

275
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
What are we playing, Professor?

276
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,960
I suggest 'The Ring Dance from Deleni'.
Do you guys agree with me?

277
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,520
No, Professor, that's not right...
We'd better play a stomping dance.

278
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,000
Don't contradict me!

279
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,400
We can't do it anyway,
because he broke his instrument.

280
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,760
You there. Sit down!
now that you broke it...

281
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,240
- Ready, boss?
- Positions, everybody! Attention!

282
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,360
5,4,3,2,1...

283
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,480
- Is this everything you've got?
- You've seen everything else.

284
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,560
Well, what can I tell you?
it's much better than that rag.

285
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,560
- OK, I'm buying it. How much?
- 40 lei.

286
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,840
That's a little pricy...

287
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,080
No! My prices are the lowest
out there.

288
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,000
I know, that's why I came to you.

289
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,040
But it's a little expensive
for the quality of the fabric.

290
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,480
Look! I can drain my soup with
this rag in a couple of years.

291
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,480
And this one! Look at this!
it tears right away, see?

292
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Of course it tears if you pull at it!

293
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,800
You should see the kids
pulling at it!

294
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,800
10,20...
40. That's it.

295
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,720
40 lei. Nothing more, nothing less.

296
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,720
- Shall I wrap it for you?
- No! I'll wear it so I get used to it.

297
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,680
It looks nice,
no doubt about that.

298
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,000
- Good afternoon!
- 'Afternoon!

299
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,680
- Have you got any firecrackers?
- I do.

300
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,040
- How much for a box?
- 2 lei.

301
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,000
- Fanica, what's bothering you?
- Let me be, I'm in a hurry.

302
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,040
- Where are you going for New Year's Eve?
- I'm staying home, as usual.

303
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,240
- Me, I'm going to Dubai.
- Dubai. That's nice.

304
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,440
- I'm going to Busteni with my friends.
- Where's the principal going?

305
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,480
- What's that your business?
- He's coming with me, to Dubai.

306
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,080
- Can I pass through, please?
- Yes, madam.

307
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,720
270...

308
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,240
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

309
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,560
- You owe me 130 lei. As well!
- Yes, madam.

310
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,840
Manescu! 60...

311
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:58,920
Hello? Vasilache? I'm calling to say
fuck your answering machine. Good bye!

312
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,240
Son of a bitch!

313
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,840
I don't get it. What's the big fuss
about this revolution?

314
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,200
Nobody gives a shit about it,
anyway.

315
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,240
What would you like me to do?

316
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Programs about gas prices going up, or
about gypsy fiddlers? Tell me, what?

317
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm going to my sister's
for the new Year's, in Bucharest.

318
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,040
What?

319
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,640
You said you're gonna spend it
with your wife.

320
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:47,320
- What about my show on new Year's
Eve?
- I'm leaving on December 30th

321
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,720
- No, you can't do that!
- Why not?

322
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,280
Who's gonna do the street interviews,
the newscast, you know...

323
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,480
- The guys can do it.
- What do you mean 'the guys'?

324
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,480
I'll have the show on winter customs
done by then anyway.

325
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,840
I can do the street interviews
before I leave.

326
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,400
And Costel could read the news.

327
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,840
His tongue won't bleed
if he does it, will it?

328
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What about the midnight live
broadcast?

329
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,400
What about it?

330
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,760
- Who's going to film that?
- It's not me, anyway.

331
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,280
- Who's gonna take the live interviews?
- Costel can do it.

332
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,200
It'll be too loud anyway
to hear any questions,

333
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,760
With the firecrackers and stuff...

334
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,240
- No, you're not leaving.
- Yes I am.

335
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,320
- I'm gonna fire you.
- So what?

336
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,840
- Vali, I'm not kidding you.
- Me neither.

337
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,000
I want to go to Bucharest
for the new Year's, and that's that!

338
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,280
Come on, Vali...

339
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,840
Why would you spend the new Year's
in Bucharest for? It's gonna be ugly.

340
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,560
Plus, the streets are muddy there
even when it snows.

341
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,040
It's also very crowded.
You won't like it, you'll see!

342
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,800
And you'll want to come back home...

343
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,760
- Did you say 200?
- Yup.

344
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,160
- Where did you do 200?
- Are you kidding me? Everywhere...

345
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,280
If there's no radars,
then you can go.

346
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,080
- Hello. Mr. Piscoci!
- Hello, Eugene!

347
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,040
Isn't it too early?
it's like three days away.

348
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,280
Well, if you know better than I do...

349
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,680
So, you're saying it rocks, ech?
What about the music?

350
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,200
It's got everything:
condensers, amplifier...

351
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,160
You've got no problem
driving at night.

352
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,240
It's safe, it's got adaptive
headlines for curves...

353
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,760
- Eugene!
- What?

354
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,440
Do you have a light?

355
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,760
No. I don't!
Guys, give him a lighter!

356
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,400
- You bring it back, all right?
- Yeah, I'll bring it right back.

357
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,720
You can start the engine with
your remote control at home!

358
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,200
It's got seat heaters too.

359
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,240
- Seat heaters? That's cool...
- Yeah, it runs good.

360
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,200
It's got those chrome rims I use in the
summer. I use these in winter, though.

361
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,040
- You've winterized them, right?
- Yup!

362
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,560
What're you doing there, man?
What's up with him?

363
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,440
You understand?
it's totally worth it.

364
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,760
- What are you doing, Mr. Piscoci?
- Thanks! Who, me?

365
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,040
- You're acting like a child.
- Look who did it!

366
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,000
Why do you think I turn around?
Dear God!

367
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,520
- Poor old guy! He's senile...
- I told you he was crazy.

368
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,760
Life sucks,
but don't worry about it.

369
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,720
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I really am.

370
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,480
You know, at the bar...
I'm really sorry.

371
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,560
- Why did you come here?
- I came to apologize.

372
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,240
Apologies accepted.

373
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,960
- Listen, Chen...
- Yes, I'm listening.

374
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,480
- I have a favor to ask you.
- You need some money?

375
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,920
Yes, this is the last time,
I promise!

376
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,040
Look, I got my paycheck today
and I used it all up on debts.

377
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,320
This is the last time I'm asking you.
I have nobody else to go to.

378
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,480
You're my only friend.

379
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,400
But I'm not your friend anymore
when you get drunk?

380
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:19,280
Come on, Chen! You know I don't
remember anything afterwards.

381
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,560
I'll tell you what you said.

382
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,800
You said I should go back to my country,
'cause I'm worse than a gypsy,

383
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,400
'cause I'm a little short bastard,
and 'cause my palate is yellow.

384
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,720
Your palate is yellow?
What's that supposed to mean?

385
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,760
- I have no idea what it means.
- Me neither, but that's what you said.

386
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Chen, if you don't help me,
my wife won't let me in.

387
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,440
- How much do you want?
- 600 lei.

388
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,040
- How much?
- 600 lei. Please...

389
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,520
I'll give it back to you first thing
in January, when I get paid.

390
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,640
I don't have that kind of money.

391
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,560
Come on, Chen! The whole town's
been buying your firecrackers,

392
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,200
And you say you can't lend me 600?

393
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,960
Do you promise to stop that bullshit
when you get drunk?

394
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,480
I promise.

395
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:17,800
- Can you give me your word for it?
- Yes, you can have my word for it.

396
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,600
OK then.

397
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,880
100,200,250,300,350,400,450,

398
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,480
500,550,600,610,620,630,640...

399
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,520
- It might snow in January.
- Man, the seasons are all mixed up.

400
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,840
Back in the day, the snow was so tall
you could hardly get out of the house.

401
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,960
That's true.

402
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,480
- How long have we known each other?
- How long?

403
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,680
Since I was a student and you
were doing Santa at my school.

404
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,720
Back then they called it
Father Frost!

405
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,480
That's right, Father Frost...

406
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,000
- What school did you go to?
- Number 3.

407
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,040
Number 3...

408
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,000
How did you know it was me?

409
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,920
This one time you messed up
my present.

410
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,840
You gave me a teddy bear
and my mom had bought me a toy gun.

411
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,720
When my mom saw that, she went
to the dressing room to talk to you.

412
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,760
I followed her and I saw you there,
taking your Santa outfit off.

413
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,200
- When did this happen?
- 1965 or '66.

414
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,960
It's been a while...

415
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,440
- I was so mad at you back then...
- But why?

416
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,960
- I cussed you a whole year, you know.
- Why?

417
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:28,400
You never returned my toy gun.
I got stuck with the teddy bear.

418
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,760
Things like these happen.
We're human...

419
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:40,840
Don't mind my saying so,
but your car stinks of gas.

420
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,640
- It's diesel, Mr. Piscoci.
- Diesel?

421
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,680
It's a poor old thing.
But it works.

422
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,760
- It's good it doesn't rain on you.
- Or snow on you, either.

423
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,480
Yeah, it doesn't snow on you...

424
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,520
Good afternoon, madam!

425
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,120
Professor?

426
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,320
- It is you, Professor! How are you?
- Hi there, Tibi! How are things?

427
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,640
- I see you bought a Christmas tree...
- Yeah, it's for my folks.

428
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,440
- When did you come back?
- Last night.

429
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,640
- And are you leaving soon?
- The day after tomorrow.

430
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,200
- I haven't seen you in ages, Tibi.
- I don't come home very often.

431
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,800
That means you'll come visit me,
right?

432
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,080
I'll try, Professor.

433
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,880
But there's hardly enough time
to spend with my folks.

434
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,440
- Come on, kid! Try to stop by.
- I'll try.

435
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,920
Here they are.
I have to go.

436
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,560
Happy holidays!
that's if I don't see you around!

437
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,400
Happy holidays!
But I'll be waiting for you.

438
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,920
I'll try to come.

439
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,120
Professor,
do you still play the guitar?

440
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:55,320
- Do you still play the guitar?
- No, I haven't played in ages.

441
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,560
What's going on, Mr. Piscoci?

442
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,640
Nothing much...
Just stretching my legs.

443
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,400
Is that a nice Christmas tree
or what?

444
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,520
Come on, let's go!

445
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,640
- Hello!
- Hello! When does the show begin?

446
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,560
It won't start in an hour or so.
Get in!

447
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,800
In this case, could we stop by the
market to buy a Christmas tree?

448
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,680
The two of you could help me with it.

449
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,800
We'll get all the Christmas trees
you want.

450
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,040
Now come on, let's go!
that's actually not a bad idea.

451
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,840
- Wanna take the front seat or what?
- Why should I take the front seat?

452
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,720
- Are you coming to the show?
- Are you?

453
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,160
- Yes, I am.
- Come on, people, let's go!

454
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,600
Be sure to take off your hat.

455
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,960
When we're on the air, make sure
not to look at the monitors...

456
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,240
And stop slamming things around,
cussing or talking nonsense.

457
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,040
That's bullshit! Like we'd do
such a thing, Mr. Jderescu?

458
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,440
I had a few morons in my show who said
things that made my hair stand up.

459
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,720
You think people are actually
watching your show?

460
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,880
I have the feeling
nobody gives a shit about it.

461
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,320
You'd be surprised, but the rating
is pretty good. Especially in winter.

462
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,120
- Mr. Piscoci! What's going on?
- My hat!

463
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,240
What are you doing? Come here!
the show begins in a couple of seconds.

464
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,760
- And what am I supposed to do with it?
- Come here! Fuck the hat!

465
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,560
Fucking hat!

466
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,440
- Now what? What are you doing there?
- I'm nervous. Leave me alone!

467
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,440
You're nervous, my ass.
You always do this.

468
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,240
You want me to stay
like a dumb person?

469
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,760
You're unbelievable!

470
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
- Give me some of that!
- Cut it out! What's wrong with you?

471
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,120
I'm nervous, too!
this is my first time on TV

472
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,920
Mr. Piscoci,
I thought you were different.

473
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,360
I thought I could count on you.

474
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,800
- Boss!
- What now?

475
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,600
- Is the nose signal still on?
- Yes, it is.

476
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,080
What nose signal?

477
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,880
If an idiot calls
and asks stupid questions,

478
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,800
I scratch my nose
and he cuts him off.

479
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,360
- How are you gonna scratch your nose?
- As usual, how else?

480
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,400
- What if you really need to?
- It won't happen, forget it!

481
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,160
- What if you really must scratch it?
- I'll refrain myself.

482
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,440
Your gas bills must be huge
with all this equipment.

483
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,960
Yes, I pay a lot!

484
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,280
- How much per month?
- Around 1100 lei.

485
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,640
- Are we all set?
- We're getting close, boss.

486
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,400
- Positions everybody!
- Positions...

487
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,280
- Calm down, everybody!
- A thousand lei is a lot.

488
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,200
- Where do I look?
- Into the camera!

489
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,000
3,2,1...

490
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,520
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen!

491
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,680
As you all know, today is a very
important day for our country.

492
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:32,280
16 years ago, the Romanian revolution
of December '89 started in Bucharest.

493
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,600
In fact, a new era in Romanian history
began that day.

494
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,600
That's why I'd like us
to go back in time today.

495
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,280
I'd like us to find out whether we,
the citizens of this town,

496
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,080
Took part in this heroic day
in the history of our nation.

497
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,720
Together with my guests today.
And with your help...

498
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,400
You can call us at 321747.
I repeat, 321747.

499
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:08,360
We'll try to answer a question that's
been bothering me for a very long time.

500
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,720
The question we want
to answer today is:

501
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:19,480
'Was there a revolution
in our town or not?'

502
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,560
Now let me introduce
my guests today.

503
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm gonna start with
Professor Tiberiu Manescu.

504
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,520
Good afternoon!

505
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,200
- On my right here is Mr. Piscoci Emil.
- Emanoil!

506
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,040
- Emanoil Piscoci. Of course. Excuse me.
- Good afternoon!

507
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,120
Many of you will probably wonder

508
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,040
Why we've picked up a topic like this,
after such a long time?

509
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:49,560
Well, I think that...
According to
great Plato's "Myth of the Cave"

510
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,320
There was a time when people mistook
the sun for a little fire.

511
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,800
I think it is my duty
as a journalist...

512
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,200
Okay, say we got out of this cave,
but what if we got into another,

513
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:10,760
Bigger cave, where we mistake
the sun for a straw fire?

514
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,800
My point is that there's
no present without a past

515
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,920
And no future without a present.

516
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,960
That's why, I think
the clearer the past,

517
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,240
The clearer the present
and the future.

518
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,080
On the other hand,
as Heraclites said:

519
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,920
We humans can't dive twice
in the waters of the same river.

520
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,280
But I say,
ladies and gentlemen,

521
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,560
Let’s try to dive into the time ocean,

522
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,000
For truth's sake
and for a better future.

523
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,760
So. Mr. Manescu?
What do you think?

524
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,280
Was there a revolution
in our town or not?

525
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,240
Good afternoon!

526
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,840
First, I'd like to thank you,
Mr. Jderescu

527
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,360
For this opportunity to finally
speak out about what happened

528
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:19,320
In our town during those dramatic days
of December 22nd 1989

529
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,600
So, was there a revolution or not?

530
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,280
I'd also like to say that time goes by,
people forget and it's a great shame.

531
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Yes, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

532
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,720
We all knew,
with the whole country,

533
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,800
What was happening in Timisoara
on December 17th 1989

534
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,720
And we all felt the time had come
for the communist nightmare to end.

535
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,440
A single spark could put an end
to this nightmare,

536
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,720
And could erase this bad dream
from our country's map.

537
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,080
Of course, that spark was to come from
Bucharest, the heart of our country.

538
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,120
Yes, Bucharest. So, you're saying that
there was a revolution in our town.

539
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,800
- There certainly was one.
- Mr. Piscoci, what do you think?

540
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,880
I second Manescu.
There was a revolution in our town.

541
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:17,960
Mr. Manescu, could you tell us how you
spent your day on December 22,1989?

542
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,680
Yes, of course.

543
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,120
A few buddies and I had spent
the night before

544
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,760
Listening to the Free Europe station
to learn about the events in Timisoara.

545
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,840
We felt this communist nightmare
must end.

546
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,560
And we all decided to go protest
in the town square.

547
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,840
Pardon me for interrupting...
Who were these buddies of yours?

548
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,240
Well, it was the math professor,
Mr. Bastina...

549
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,200
- Who died in the meantime. I think,
- Yeah, he did.

550
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,880
There was also the Romanian professor,
Mr. Vlad Petrescu.

551
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,200
An extraordinary person,
a genius, an original poet...

552
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,560
- But he died, as well.
- God rest their souls!

553
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,600
- And there was also Professor haidu.
- The Chemistry Professor, yes...

554
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,280
Yes, he's in Canada now,
at his son's.

555
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,200
So we all decided
to go protest in the town square.

556
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,920
Weren't you afraid, Mr. Manescu?

557
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,560
Of course we were afraid.
But we felt we had to do something.

558
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,200
- So you all came to the town square...
- Yes.

559
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,640
- Where from?
- From school.

560
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,440
- Had you spent the whole night there?
- No.

561
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,760
We went there to get our paychecks,

562
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,360
Then we went to the town square
to protest.

563
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,760
But you've just said that you had spent
the whole night together.

564
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,680
No...
We first listened to the Free
Europe station, then we went home.

565
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,680
The next morning we came back for
our paychecks, and then went downtown.

566
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:58,520
Do you remember what time
this was happening?

567
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,120
They were usually start cutting
the checks around 10 AM.

568
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,760
We were in line first at about 10:30 AM.
Then we went downtown...

569
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,560
It must have been 11 or 11:30
when we got downtown.

570
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,240
- So it was 11:30.
- Yes.

571
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,840
What exactly did you do
in the town square?

572
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,600
First of all, the square was
completely empty. Not a soul...

573
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,760
It was as if everything had frozen,
like in this picture behind us.

574
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,120
We got to the town square
and started to protest.

575
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,640
And what were you saying?

576
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,560
We were saying what everybody else
was saying...
'No More Communism!'

577
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,040
'Death to Ceausescu!',
'no More Dictatorship!'

578
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,920
'Timisoara. Timisoara!'

579
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,280
'Come, people, come, we're done,
Ceausescu's gone!'

580
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,680
Anyway, did anything happen?

581
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,960
Nothing really...
I remember that, at one point,

582
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,760
We started throwing rocks
at the City Council windows.

583
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,680
Tell me, did anybody
in the town hall show up?

584
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,920
Nobody.
Not a single devil, as they say.

585
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,240
Unbelievable. And?
You were saying...

586
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,600
Yes...
Then we all decided to break
through the doors of the City Council.

587
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,880
But, of course, they were locked.

588
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,720
Then we decided to break in through
the emergency door but it was stuck.

589
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,560
So we came back. And that's when
the Secret Services guys showed up.

590
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,600
How do you know they were
from the Secret Services?

591
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,160
I just know...
I recognized
one of them. Those people have...

592
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,360
Wait a minute here!
What was his name?

593
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,880
- How's that relevant now?
- It's very relevant.

594
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:56,240
It was this guy, Bejan. He used
to work for the Secret Services.

595
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,760
How do you know he worked
for the Secret Services?

596
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,760
Everybody knew that! His son,
Sorinel, was a student at my school.

597
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,640
I used to see his father
at the teacher-Parent meetings.

598
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,080
Is that the one who has
the "Bejan and Sons" farm.

599
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,800
- You mean 'firm'...
- Firm, farm...
It's all the same.

600
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,320
OK. So, let me get this straight,
the three of you...

601
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,400
- No, the four of us...
- So it was the three of them.

602
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,680
- Yes.
- So the two of you...

603
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,240
- No.
- You mean the two of them...

604
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,240
It was the four of us
and the three of them!

605
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,880
- Did you know who the other two were?
- No, I didn't.

606
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,880
- Were you there, too?
- No, I came much later.

607
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,360
- All right...
So?
- So what?

608
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,440
- So, what did you do afterward?
- You mean after they threatened us?

609
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,040
Yeah, after...

610
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,680
There was this sort of fight,
this brawl...

611
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,240
- Were you fighting?
- Yes, we were fighting.

612
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,560
But that's not the issue here.
The important thing is...

613
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,680
And who won?

614
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,160
We did.

615
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,400
I think that people who saw us
fighting weren't afraid anymore,

616
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,160
And they all gathered
in the town square.

617
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,520
Lots of people were coming from
the factories, from the main avenue,

618
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,360
From behind the hotel,
from that way, you see?

619
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,600
From the park...

620
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,760
In the next ten minutes
the square was swarming with people.

621
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,800
Mr. Piscoci. We were the first,
to scream out loud:

622
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,240
'Come, people, come, we're done,
Ceausescu's gone!'

623
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,240
Everybody started screaming, 'we won!',
'Freedom! Freedom!'.

624
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,560
The Secret Services people
ran away and...

625
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,840
Just a moment, please.
I somebody on the line? Hello?

626
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,760
- Good afternoon, Mr. Jderescu.
- Good afternoon! Who's calling?

627
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,720
My name is Maricica and I live
in the building across the Town Hall,

628
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,120
Where Mr. Manescu said he was in '89.

629
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,840
- Your name is Maricica what?
- Maricica Dima.

630
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,360
- So, would you like to intervene?
- Yes. I'd like to intervene.

631
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,800
I want people to know that this Manescu
guy, and the other ones he mentioned...

632
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,720
God rest their souls,
only good things about the dead...

633
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,960
Well...
All of them drank like pigs the
whole night at the bar in my building.

634
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:05,280
The whole town knows what drunkards
they are. They just never get enough.

635
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,040
And now they want people to know
they were revolutionaries.

636
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,520
That's why I called,

637
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,080
To tell you he was drinking
the whole night of December 21.

638
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,280
He should stop bragging
about being a revolutionary,

639
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,080
'cause he's full of shit!

640
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,760
- Mrs. Maricica, mind your language.
- I beg your pardon, I lost my temper.

641
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,400
- Anything else you'd like to say?
- No, that's it. Good afternoon.

642
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:32,080
How do you respond
to what the lady just said?

643
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,520
What can I say?
What else is there to say?

644
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,960
Is there any grain of truth
in what Mrs. Dima was saying?

645
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,280
What?

646
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,560
I mean the bar,
the drinking all night...

647
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,040
It's not true. We were drinking
on the night of December 22, not 21.

648
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,760
And we were celebrating...

649
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,680
We have somebody else on the line?
I hope it's somebody serious this time.

650
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,720
- Hello?
- Yes, hello!

651
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,680
Good afternoon!
Who are we speaking to?

652
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,360
The name is Vasile Rebegea.

653
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,920
- Good afternoon. Mr. Vasile.
- Good afternoon, sir!

654
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,360
And congratulations on the excellent
idea of having this show,

655
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,200
To bring to light all those things
about the revolution

656
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,080
In our town once and for all.

657
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
Thank you.
How can you help us?

658
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,760
I was working as a guard for the City
Council, where the Town Hall is today.

659
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,240
Yes?

660
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,360
I was at work that morning,
in the sentry box by the gate.

661
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,960
- The box is not there anymore...
- Please continue.

662
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:32,280
It was right by the stairs
you can see in the picture behind you.

663
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,720
Right...

664
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,040
By the head of the
elderly gentleman...

665
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,040
- That's behind you, Manescu.
- No, it's right there...

666
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,200
My name is Piscoci!

667
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:44,400
Now I remember.
It was right there. Go ahead.

668
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,240
I'd like you to know
that I saw nobody in the square

669
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,200
Doing what the Professor said.
People started coming around 12:30.

670
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,240
They came in tens and hundreds.
They all came in a jumble.

671
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,800
Mr. Vasile, so you're saying you
didn't see those four Professors?

672
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,960
No. Sir. I didn't.

673
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,720
Mr...
Had you been on duty
the whole morning?

674
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,240
Yes, that's right. I went away for
a while but I mostly stood there.

675
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,680
So you went away for a while.
Can I please have...

676
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,200
For about half an hour.
I had to go to the market.

677
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,320
Can I please have this?
the pen, too...

678
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,840
- When was all this happening?
- I couldn't say exactly.

679
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,400
I think it must've been around 10,
maybe 10:30...
Maybe even 11.

680
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,960
- Could you be more specific?
- I couldn't really tell you exactly...

681
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,720
- Listen to him...
- Let's say 11 o'clock.

682
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,840
And what did you go
to the market for?

683
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,640
- What's that your business?
- I just want to calculate...

684
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
What do you want to calculate for?

685
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,440
I want to calculate exactly to see
if you were in the box or not.

686
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,240
I don't give a fuck!

687
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,560
- Mr. Vasile, please!
- I apologize.

688
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,600
Why did you go to the market?

689
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,840
I went to buy a Christmas tree, like
all Christians do before Christmas.

690
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,720
- Of course...
Continue, please.
- Did you walk to the market or what?

691
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,760
- No, I took the helicopter!
- Please. Mr. Vasile,


692
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,680
Of course I walked.
What the hell?

693
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,160
15 minutes to the market, 10 minutes
buying the tree, 15 minutes back...

694
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
You were gone
for at least 40 minutes.

695
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,840
So what?

696
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,760
Now, did you bring the Christmas tree
along or did you take it home?

697
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,320
What the fuck is it your business
what I did with my Christmas tree?

698
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,640
What is it your business to say
we were not there

699
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,360
If you weren't there yourself?

700
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,760
- Yes, I was.
- You were at the market buying a tree.

701
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:32,240
- Yes, but I came back.
- When? In a week?

702
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,640
Mr. Vasile, did you bring the Christmas
tree along or did you take it home?

703
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,920
Mr. Virgil, can't you see
it doesn't matter anymore?

704
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,200
When the masses of people started
coming, I was there, doing my job.

705
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,760
I was watching the news on TV
in my sentry box,

706
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,280
And I saw Ceausescu take off
in a helicopter.

707
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,800
Five minutes after that
people started to come.

708
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,360
Nobody came to the town square before
the dictator took off. What the hell?


709
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,040
When Secret Services guys were
chasing us and we got to your box,

710
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,680
You weren't there!

711
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,960
Were they chasing you?
You haven't mentioned that before.

712
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,360
He's lying, sir!

713
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,800
I can't see how you could fit
four people into that little box.

714
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,320
If they were beating you right
and left, you'd have seen how...

715
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,040
- Did they beat you?
- No, they kissed us!

716
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,040
- He's lying, sir!
- You're lying!

717
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,960
OK. Hold it!


718
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,920
So, Mr. Manescu, you said you
were hiding in the sentry box...

719
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,640
We locked ourselves in.

720
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,360
- Right...
When was this happening?
- I don't know...
Around noon.

721
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,080
Around noon...

722
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,600
Mr. Vasile says he was in that
sentry box 8 minutes past noon,

723
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,440
When the dictator left
the Central Committee building,

724
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,440
And there was nobody in the square
at that time.

725
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,160
Not a soul!

726
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:44,360
Mr. Manescu, could you tell us what you
did between noon and 8 past noon?

727
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,960
I can't remember
if it was noon-noon...

728
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,280
All I know is that, when they started
chasing us, we got into that box,

729
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,080
And the Secret Services guys started
pounding on it for a while.

730
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,280
Then they left, we got out,
and we stayed there!

731
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,080
And did you start the protest
or what?

732
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,440
Mainly, yes...

733
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,880
- You're fucking lying, man!
- You're lying!

734
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,760
- Gentlemen, please, let's not...
- 'Let's not' what, sir?

735
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,960
You'd better tell this liar
to go home and leave us alone

736
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,240
With his revolution!
There was no revolution!

737
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,200
It was much better during
the Dictator's time anyway!

738
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,560
So fuck off
with your fucking revolution!

739
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,400
What can I...
A fucking Communist!

740
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,360
I believe Mr. Vasile raised an issue
that could help us.

741
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:32,040
Did people start coming before or after
the Dictator left the C.C. Building?

742
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,040
The moment of Ceausescu's departure
is very significant.

743
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,600
It stands for the fall
of the communist regime.

744
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,240
If you'll indulge me,

745
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,400
The C.C. Building
was for the Romanian revolution

746
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,800
What the Bastille was
for the French revolution.

747
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,280
So, then, if people started flooding
the streets after 8 past noon,

748
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,680
It means there was no revolution
in our town.

749
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,720
How do you respond to this?

750
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,320
What I'm saying is that my buddies
and I were there before 8 past noon!

751
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,680
- But some people disagree with you.
- So, are you calling me a liar?

752
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,280
No, but there are some discrepancies
between what you are saying

753
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,160
And what one of our viewers
has just said.

754
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,600
Meaning?

755
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,160
Well, Mr. Vasile said
you weren't there.

756
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,400
Gentlemen, I'm gonna tell you
how things happened...

757
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,400
Come on, Mr. Piscoci.
Sit down.

758
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,720
OK. So, his sentry box was there,
right? And where were you?

759
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,080
I don't know.
Maybe by the statue.

760
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,360
Weren't you by chance
in front of the statue?

761
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,840
Yes, we were. We were in front,
of the statue! So what?

762
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,680
If his box was there and the four
of you were in front of the statue,

763
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,560
He couldn't have seen you...
Don't you see? Think about it!

764
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,680
Let's say Mr. Jderescu here
is the statue.

765
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,080
Can you see me?
of course you can't.

766
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,240
Don't you understand he was
at the market, buying his tree?

767
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,080
He couldn’t have been in his box!

768
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,760
Just a moment.
There's somebody else on the line.

769
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,560
- Hello?
- This is unbelievable...

770
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,360
- Hello?
- Who are we speaking with?

771
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,520
- This is Costica Bejan speaking.
- Well-well!

772
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,160
Good afternoon, Mr. Bejan!

773
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,200
Mr. Jderescu, why are you bringing
people like these on your show

774
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,720
To talk about the holy Revolution

775
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,320
When they have no clue
what's happening to them?

776
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,720
- Please show some respect, Mr. Bejan.
- Are you talking about 'respect'?

777
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,720
You of all people, after you've
invited a drunkard to your show,

778
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,920
Allowing him to trash
respectable people?

779
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,560
Tell me, where were you
on December 22.1989?


780
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,920
First of all, it's Sir to you.
Second of all,

781
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,320
We're gonna straighten things out
some other place, some other time.

782
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,040
- Is this a threat?
- Mr. Jderescu, are you still there?

783
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,600
Yes, I am.


784
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,520
Mr. Jderescu, if any of your guests
ever utters my name on the air,

785
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,120
With all due respect,
I will sue you.

786
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,120
Tell us, where were you
on December 22?

787
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,560
I'm going to sue you, and you'll have
to pay through the nose for this!

788
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,440
I won't have anybody
stain my name and reputation.

789
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,280
I own three profitable businesses,
and 154 people work for me.

790
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,160
- What were you doing on...
- Shut up...

791
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,600
Let me talk!

792
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,240
- Mr. Jderescu, may I continue?
- By all means.

793
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,280
I have three profitable businesses,
and 154 employees.

794
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,680
I've been working really hard since 1989

795
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,600
And I won't let anybody
mock my work.

796
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,760
Mr. Bejan, we're not trying
to mock your work.

797
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,760
All we want is to put together
the pieces of certain events

798
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,080
Which are crucial to our history.

799
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,680
So, what were you doing
on 22nd December 1989?

800
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:14,280
Mr. Jderescu, please calm down
your guest.

801
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,120
Gentlemen, please! Let's try
to set things straight.

802
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,400
That's exactly why I called.

803
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:27,240
Mr. Manescu was accusing you of
having threatened him on December 22nd.

804
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,680
This is a lie. I was in my native
village, near Buzau since December 21st.

805
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,840
My mother was very ill
and I was there to help.

806
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,360
Yeah, so you were in Buzau
when you were hitting me?

807
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,680
Mr. Jderescu. This isn't a drunk's,
tale. I have witnesses to prove it.

808
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,560
Yeah...
You guys
always have witnesses!

809
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,240
Just a moment, please!

810
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,560
Mr. Bejan, you were saying that you
were out of town on December 22nd...

811
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,720
- That's right!
- Well...

812
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,320
OK. Tell me, what were you doing
before 1989?

813
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,640
All right, Mr. Jderescu,
I'll answer this question, too.

814
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,880
I used to work for the Secret
Services...
As an accountant.

815
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,040
Accounting is a profession,
a science, even an art,

816
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,360
Regardless of any political system.

817
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,400
The truth is that I knew
he used to work as an accountant...

818
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,240
Accountant or not, did he work
for the Secret Services or not?

819
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,320
I worked for the Secret Services
'cause I graduated the top of my class.

820
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,760
Congratulations!

821
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,280
I was very good at what I was doing
and I've never been ashamed to admit it.

822
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,320
But to say that I was in
the town square on December 22nd,

823
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,200
That's a bit of a stretch.

824
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,400
It's called libel and it is punished
according to the criminal law.

825
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,080
So you say you weren't in the
town square on December 22nd...

826
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,160
I won't repeat myself.
I don't have time for your nonsense.

827
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,160
One last thing...

828
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:50,400
If you say my name once again and
have no evidence, you'll be very sorry.

829
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:55,320
I'll close with a plea for
professionalism, Mr. Jderescu.

830
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,640
Stop telling all these tall tales!
Good bye!

831
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,360
- Good bye!
- Good bye!

832
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,240
What a nerve!

833
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,160
Please stop mentioning Mr. Bejan's
name if you don't have any proof.

834
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,240
Now you're afraid
he's gonna sue you, right?

835
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,920
It's not that...

836
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:19,960
As a journalist, I know you need
evidence for your accusations.

837
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,360
What do you mean, 'journalist'?
Aren't you a textile engineer?

838
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,960
No, I'm not.

839
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,840
Weren't you employed in the textile
industry, back in the day?

840
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,320
This happened a long time ago.
Now I work as a journalist and...

841
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,880
Give me a break
with all this 'journalist' bullshit.

842
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,800
The other guy said he was an
'accountant' for the Secret Services,

843
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,360
And now he's got a firm...

844
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,600
You were a textile engineer,
and now you've got a TV Station...

845
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,560
I think I should be an astronaut.

846
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,240
Let me tell you I'm not very fond
of your ironic remarks.

847
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,760
Why did you bring me to this show
anyway? For nothing?

848
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,240
I beg your pardon.

849
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,800
If you two have things
to straighten out, I can go...

850
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,320
It seems to me our discussion
has reached a rather sensitive point,

851
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:04,240
And I think we should sum up
our points so far.

852
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,760
So far, no viewer can confirm
what Mr. Manescu said

853
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,800
About the events happening
in the morning of December 22nd.

854
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,680
It seems to me that nobody knows
whether he and his buddies

855
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,320
Went to the town square
before the crowd.

856
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,960
Where was I then?
on the Moon?

857
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,960
I don't really know where you were,
but you have no proof,

858
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,600
No witnesses to confirm
you were there.

859
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,720
- Why is this so important?
- It's very important.

860
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,920
If people started gathering
in the square

861
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,960
After Ceausescu left
the C.C. Building,

862
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,120
It means there was no revolution
in our town.

863
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,720
What was it then?

864
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,920
I don't know,
but it was no revolution.

865
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,280
Mr. Jderescu, let me tell you
how the whole thing happened...

866
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,240
The revolution started
in Timisoara, right?

867
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,240
It then spread throughout
the whole country,

868
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,960
Including this middle of nowhere,
which is our town.

869
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,120
- Yes, so what?
- 'So what'?

870
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:05,440
Look! Do you know how they turn
the streetlights on?

871
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,200
Do you know how they turn them on
in the evening and off in the morning?

872
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,360
What's this got to do
with the streetlights?

873
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,920
It has...
That's how
the revolution started.

874
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,840
It started in Timisoara,
then in Bucharest. Then in our town,


875
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,280
What's the revolution got to do
with streetlights?

876
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,760
Can't you see?

877
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,320
That's exactly the same way
they turn on the streetlights:

878
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,360
First. In center. Then,
throughout the whole town,

879
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,960
To the last wretched street.

880
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,880
Mr. Piscoci, I'm sorry to tell you,
but this is nonsense.

881
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,920
What do you mean 'nonsense'?

882
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,440
What has electricity got to do
with the revolution?

883
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:42,160
It has a great deal! 'Cause people
in our town are cowards...

884
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,400
They took to the streets only after
they saw the Dictator left Bucharest.

885
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,640
- Is that what you did?
- Yes.

886
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,720
When I saw it started
in Bucharest, I went out, as well.

887
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,560
Mr. Manescu here claims
he went out before...

888
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,440
He may have been there before,
but I went out after...

889
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,240
How is this a revolution

890
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,200
If people took to the streets
after the danger was over?

891
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:10,680
We did what we could.
We had a revolution our own way.

892
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,080
I think we can now go to commercials.

893
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,640
Then we'll continue to try to answer
the question of our show today:

894
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,240
'Was there a revolution
in our town or not?'

895
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,640
Let's go to commercials now.

896
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,440
Commercials, please!

897
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,760
How dare you to call me a textile
engineer on the air, on MY show?

898
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,120
How dare you to say I wasn't there?

899
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,200
Do you have any idea how hard
it's been to set this station up?

900
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,400
How much shit I had to take
from all the crazies around?

901
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:55,840
How much stress it was?

902
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,120
And now you come to my show
to teach me a lesson...

903
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,760
- Mr. Piscoci, what are you doing?
- I'm going to the men's room.

904
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,680
Come back quickly.
We start in 5 minutes.

905
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,920
- Where is it?
- Down the hall, to your right.

906
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,760
- Now what?
- I'm leaving.

907
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,240
- You don't need me here.
- You can't just up and leave!

908
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,840
If you keep saying I'm a liar,
I'm out!

909
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,040
I didn't say you're lying!

910
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,160
I just said what
the others were saying,

911
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,560
About you not being in the square...

912
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:25,640
If you're leaving now,
it's obvious you're lying!

913
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,760
Boss, are we gonna finish
this show or what?

914
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,280
Who taught you to film like this?
if you touch that camera again,

915
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,640
I'm gonna crack your skull with it,
with both of them!

916
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,720
It's 'cause these tripods
doesn't work, boss.

917
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,800
'the tripods doesn't work...

918
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,200
First you try your hand here,
I teach you everything,

919
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,520
And then you all leave me
to go to Bucharest!

920
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,360
You goddamn morons...

921
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,880
5,4,3,2,1...

922
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,920
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen!

923
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,840
Even though heraclites used to say

924
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,600
That we can't dive twice into
the waters of the same river,

925
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,640
I'd like us to dive, again,
into history's ocean, 16 years ago,

926
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:31,080
For truth's sake
and for the sake of all of us.

927
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,760
The theme of our show today is:

928
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,240
'Was there a revolution
in our town or not?'

929
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:43,800
First, let me remind you
that our phone number is 321747.

930
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,320
I repeat, 321747.

931
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,320
Allow me to introduce our guests
to you again.

932
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,280
- I'll start with Mr. Emanoil Piscoci.
- Good afternoon.

933
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:59,160
Can we see the guests now?
thanks!

934
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:08,360
Mr. Emanoil Piscoci is on my right and
Professor Tiberiu Manescu, on my left.

935
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,040
Good afternoon.

936
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,640
It seems we have somebody
on the line...

937
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,720
As they say, 'Vox populi, vox dei',
so let's get straight to business.

938
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,400
- Good afternoon!
- Hello, this is Gelu isarescu speaking.

939
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,240
'Afternoon, Gelu!
how are you?

940
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,240
Good evening,
'cause it's getting dark.

941
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,760
Why did you call us?

942
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,040
It's about this revolution thing,
Mr. Jidarescu.

943
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,360
Let's hear it.

944
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,520
Mr. Jidarescu, I've worked in sales my
whole life and I'm a respected person.

945
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,640
Mr. Manescu and you know me...

946
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:43,200
And I've known Mr. Piscoci since
he used to do Santa for the kids!

947
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,240
- Hello. Gelu!
- Go on...

948
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,240
So I know you all,
and I know Mr. Bejan, as well.

949
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,840
And I don't want to lie to you,
gentlemen.

950
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,240
I think there was no revolution
in our town.

951
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,520
Mr. Gelu, have you been watching
our show so far?

952
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,320
No, why?

953
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,520
Did we lose the connection?
We are very sorry.

954
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,760
Anybody else on the line?
Good evening!

955
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,520
Good evening!
My name is Ion Costachescu.

956
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:17,240
- So. Mr. Costachescu,
- Look, Mr. Jderescu...

957
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,920
On 22nd December 1989 I was
driving back from the countryside.

958
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,040
I had visited my parents to slaughter
the pig for Christmas...

959
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,760
When I left their village,
Muntenii de Jos. Where I was born.

960
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,240
I saw I had a flat tire
on the rear left.

961
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,880
But I said to myself, home is
only 7 km away, I can make it.

962
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,800
But you didn't make it...

963
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,880
No, because of the heavy cargo:
the pig, the wine, the Christmas tree...

964
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,920
Keep going, we're listening.

965
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,360
To cut it short, I had a puncture
right in the town square.

966
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,960
- What time was this happening?
- Three past noon.

967
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:52,640
- Sharp?
- Yes!

968
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,240
I remember clearly, as I looked
at the clock downtown.

969
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,800
Was there anybody in the square
when you arrived?

970
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,680
No, there was nobody there.

971
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,520
And I must've waited there
for half an hour or so

972
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,560
Before people started coming.
And the guard was right...

973
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,640
People started coming all at once,

974
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,760
And the square was full
in the next 10 minutes.

975
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,920
So you haven't seen Mr. Manescu and
the other professors in the square?

976
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,720
I saw nobody. And I was looking
around, hoping to find somebody.

977
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,160
I had left my jack at home,
so there'd be more room in the trunk.

978
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,520
I see...

979
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,280
Once in a while I'd see somebody
walk down the street,

980
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,120
But they were all walking fast,
like they were on dope.

981
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,520
- What did you do then?
- You mean. About the flat tire?


982
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,600
Yes.

983
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,600
One of my work buddies was living
in that tall building

984
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,920
Across the town square,
and I borrowed his jack.

985
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:38,320
In this case
you must have been gone for a while...

986
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,320
No. 'cause I shouted his name,
out loud...

987
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,520
As his windows faced the square, he
heard me and came down with the jack.

988
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,040
How could I leave my car unattended?
They'd have stolen everything...

989
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,120
I see.
Thank you, Mr. Costachescu.

990
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,200
Was there anything else
you wanted to add?

991
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,120
No, that's all I had to say. I thought
it may be helpful to your discussion.

992
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you! Happy Holidays!

993
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,360
- Happy holidays!
- Happy holidays!

994
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:03,520
Happy holidays!

995
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,400
Mr. Manescu, another question
begs an answer

996
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,640
Following this gentleman's call...

997
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:15,360
Were you in the town square or not
on 22nd December 1989?

998
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,680
I was...

999
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,120
Well, see, everybody's been saying
the opposite.

1000
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,840
- And I'm saying I was there!
- Mr. Manescu, look...

1001
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
One, two, three, four...

1002
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,360
Four of our viewers said
they didn't seen you there.

1003
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,120
The first lady who called
didn't say I wasn't there.

1004
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,560
She only said I'd been drinking
at the bar.

1005
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,360
OK! What about the other three?

1006
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,120
Who?
that former Secret Services guy?

1007
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,480
Let us not say his name again
on this show, please.

1008
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,040
Of course he'll say I wasn't there,
after the beating he gave me.

1009
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,440
OK then...
What about
Vasile rebegea's story?

1010
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,880
We haven't established if he
returned from the market or not.

1011
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,520
What about Costachescu?

1012
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,760
Gentlemen, please,
put those fucking figures aside!

1013
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,600
God forgive me for using such foul
language before the blessed holidays.

1014
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,480
The town square clock
has been slow

1015
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:10,160
Ever since they perched it there,
in the tower.

1016
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,880
Why are you splitting hairs now?

1017
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:19,280
Do we still have a cameraman
on this show?

1018
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,680
Can I have at least one close-up?

1019
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,400
Thanks!

1020
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,080
We have somebody else on the line?

1021
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,760
- Hello!
- Hello!

1022
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,200
- Good evening! Who's calling?
- This is Chen Xiao Chuan.

1023
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,560
- The Chinese guy?
- Yeah, that's me.

1024
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,520
Don't tell me you were involved
in the revolution...

1025
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,440
No, I was in Egypt
when it happened.

1026
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:47,080
- Where were you?
- In Egypt.

1027
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,760
All right.
Why have you called?

1028
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:55,440
I've called to tell you that I've known
Mr. Manescu for a long time.

1029
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,600
He's a dependable person,
not a liar.

1030
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,040
- Is this why you called?
- Yes...

1031
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,800
I'd like to add that Mr. Manescu

1032
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,520
Is the kindest person I've known
in your town.

1033
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,480
And, like any human being,
he has his imperfections...

1034
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:19,680
But this is no reason for people to
slander him, just because he drinks.

1035
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,120
First of all,

1036
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,760
I don't think the Romanian revolution
is any of your business.

1037
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,200
Second of all, why the hell
are you selling firecrackers

1038
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,440
And fireworks to children?

1039
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,400
I sell what sells.

1040
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,840
Yeah? Anything else
you'd like to add?

1041
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,720
No, this is all I wanted to say.
Mr. Manescu is...

1042
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,080
I was asking if you wanted to add
anything else, not to repeat...

1043
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,760
No. That's all.

1044
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,760
- Good bye, then!
- Good bye!

1045
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:51,800
And it's a shame to slander a person
as honest and smart as Mr. Manescu.

1046
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,640
What are you doing?
Are you teaching us lessons now?

1047
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,680
No, I'm just saying that this is what
I don't like about you, Romanians,

1048
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,080
That you're slandering each other
all the time.

1049
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,960
Chen, if you don't like it here,

1050
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,280
Why don't you go back to China
and leave us alone?

1051
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:11,480
You come to our town, you cash on our
citizens, and now you're being smart?

1052
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:16,880
I'm not being smart or anything...
What I say is what I see.

1053
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,280
This guy has got
no grain of decency left.

1054
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,560
Well, I can see I'm talking
to myself here. Good bye!

1055
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,400
He cut me off!
I can't believe it!

1056
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,600
He didn't cut you off.
He did say 'good-bye'.

1057
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,200
But he cut me off!

1058
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,560
So, Mr. Manescu,

1059
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:47,160
Were you in the town square in the
morning of 22nd December 1989 or not?

1060
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,800
Yes, I was.

1061
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,400
Despite what everybody else
is saying?

1062
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,760
Yeah, I'm saying I was there.

1063
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,160
- Everybody else is lying then?
- I don't give a damn what people say.

1064
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:01,320
I'm saying I was there,
and that's that!

1065
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:06,920
- Were you there before 8 past noon?
- Yes.

1066
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:12,960
- And you kept on protesting?
- Yes, we did.

1067
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,560
Is there anyone else on the line?

1068
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:28,080
Mr. Manescu, were you there
before 8 past noon?

1069
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,240
Yes.

1070
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,880
Were you?

1071
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,480
Congratulations!

1072
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:58,520
Mr. Piscoci, what were you doing
on 22nd December 1989?

1073
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,840
Shall I start with the beginning
or when I got to the town square?

1074
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,160
Start with the beginning...

1075
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:15,560
Well, I got up
in the morning around 7...

1076
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:22,200
No, back then I was still getting up
at half past six...

1077
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,760
I shaved. And then,


1078
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,080
Go on...

1079
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:40,640
Anyway, I quarreled with my wife.
The moron that I was!

1080
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:50,600
Then I went to work,
but I didn't feel like staying.

1081
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:56,160
I felt bad about fighting with Maria.
I had overreacted a bit.

1082
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:03,360
I've always been a very jealous type.
I was jealous even at 60...

1083
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:10,880
In any case, that's what I think
brought her closer to the grave...

1084
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,600
I told my boss I needed to go

1085
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,280
And I went to the market
to buy her some flowers.

1086
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:24,760
But there was nobody there. Everywhere
I went everything seemed so deserted...

1087
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:31,200
I didn't feel like going home like this,
I felt guilty about the whole thing.

1088
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:37,600
But God showed me the right way...
I went to the Botanical Garden,

1089
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:44,880
Where I broke this window and stole
three magnificent magnolias.

1090
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,000
Then I returned home. Maria was
at home, cleaning the place...

1091
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:55,280
I gave her the flowers,
but she said nothing, not a word.

1092
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:00,000
She kept working
as if nothing had happened.

1093
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,360
But I looked at her through
the mirror on the dresser

1094
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,600
And I saw her faint smile.

1095
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:15,360
I liked that smile...
She must have
liked the flowers, I thought.

1096
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:23,280
But she didn't say a word. She wanted
me to see she didn't give a damn.

1097
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,680
Then I turned on the TV To show her
I didn't give a damn, either.

1098
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:34,960
They had those movies like Laurel
and hardy, or Tom and Jerry...

1099
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:40,640
Am I boring you?
- No, keep going.

1100
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,680
And I was enjoying both Laurel
and hardy, and Tom and Jerry...

1101
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:50,160
But then Ceausescu came on the tube
and he began this speech...

1102
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,080
He promised to give us

1103
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,280
I told Maria that,
if he gave us 100 lei apiece,

1104
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,960
We could go to the seaside
in Mangalia for our summer vacation.

1105
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:08,040
She said she doubted both me
and the Dictator...

1106
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,200
The transmission stopped
all of a sudden.

1107
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,040
But we kept planning
for our vacation...

1108
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,480
We thought that, if we went to
Mangalia and could save some money,

1109
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,960
We could go to the Adamclisi monument,
and take some pictures there.

1110
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:31,280
She said I should give her my word
for it and I did.

1111
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:38,200
The transmission resumed and all kinds
of people showed up on TV

1112
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:45,640
Saying the revolutionaries had won.
Maria started crying with joy,

1113
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:50,640
But I was sorry for the Ceausescu's

1114
01:16:52,320 --> 01:17:00,160
So Mr. Piscoci, you went out after you
saw on the TV what was going on...

1115
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:07,000
- I'm boring you, right?
- No...

1116
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:14,920
Yes, I went out to the square
to show Maria I could be a hero.

1117
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,920
And that I wasn't afraid
of the Communists.

1118
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:25,640
- So you went out after 8 past noon.
- Yes, that's right.

1119
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:37,520
Our show is coming to an end...

1120
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,600
Do we have another phone call?
hello?

1121
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,120
Hello! My name is Tina.

1122
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:50,000
My eldest son died on 23rd December,
1989, in Otopeni, Bucharest.

1123
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,960
I'm very sorry, madam.

1124
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,920
But we are trying to find out what
happened in our town, not in Bucharest.

1125
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,880
Well, I'm not calling
to contradict you, Mr. Jderescu.

1126
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,360
I'm just calling to say
that it began snowing.

1127
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,200
- It began snowing?
- Yes.

1128
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:13,600
It's snowing like in the good old days.
Enjoy the snow, gentlemen!

1129
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:20,200
The streets will be muddy again
tomorrow! Merry Christmas, everybody!

1130
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,640
Merry Christmas!

1131
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:33,800
Our show has come to an end.
Anything else you'd like to add?

1132
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,080
No...

1133
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:44,440
Ladies and gentlemen,
thanks for watching. Good bye.

1134
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,920
You want me to give you
a lift home?

1135
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,120
- No, I'll walk home.
- Me, too.

1136
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:28,120
Boss, this is Vali's...

1137
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:34,720
Come here to give you
the Christmas trees.

1138
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,480
I should've let the old guy
make his Zillion paper boats,

1139
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,880
And the other guy eat
his paper rumples.

1140
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,920
But, no, I had to step like a fool
in front of the camera...

1141
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,600
From now on, I'm behind it,
I'll keep it fixed,

1142
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:59,120
And then they'll have to break
their necks to fit into the frame...

1143
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,080
5,4,3,2,1...

1144
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,640
Come on, man, I'm freezing,
let's move.

1145
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,680
The old guy didn't have a clue.

1146
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,800
They invented
the photo-electric cell,

1147
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,680
And now the lights are turned on
all at once.

1148
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,480
Come on!

1149
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:43,720
Are you messing with me?
I should have broken you!

1150
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,440
Good job, man!

1151
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,760
Peaceful and nice...

1152
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:57,320
That's all I remember
about the revolution.

1153
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:01,320
It was peaceful and nice.
