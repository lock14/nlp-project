1
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,863
Nice. Sorry, good catch.

2
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,096
Boys, lunch is ready.

3
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:37,103
Here we go.

4
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,587
Ain't no doubt about it, lady,
you got a shitload of rats down there.

5
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:55,491
Damn, is it 3:00?
l gotta get out of here.

6
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:58,355
But wait,
what about my basement?

7
00:00:58,562 --> 00:01:01,463
Well, just call and make a follow-up
appointment. lt's no problem.

8
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,224
But...

9
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:44,838
Bring it in, here you go.

10
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:23,401
Got one of those for me?

11
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:25,872
Nice try, you little creep.

12
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:38,949
Mr. Buttermaker.

13
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:42,353
Mr. Buttermaker. You're late.

14
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:47,127
l got held up, sorry about that.

15
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:49,863
Jesus! Are you drinking?

16
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:54,298
Hell, no. That's nonalcoholic.
l'm driving, you know.

17
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:56,200
l'm so sorry.

18
00:02:56,406 --> 00:02:59,238
You hear that, Toby?
Drinking and driving don't mix.

19
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:01,171
That's right.
Stay away from crack too.

20
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:03,174
One hit of that,
and you'll wake up in prison

21
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,812
married to some guy
named Big Blue,

22
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:07,574
and he's branding his initials in
your ass with a hot coat hanger.

23
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:08,842
l knew a guy.

24
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,854
Yes, crack is bad too.

25
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:14,783
Yeah, l know.

26
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,118
But we are really excited
to have you do this,

27
00:03:18,326 --> 00:03:21,261
and Toby is really excited to play,
aren't you, honey?

28
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:24,921
Between his trumpet lessons,
photo club, Boy Scouts and swimming,

29
00:03:25,133 --> 00:03:26,896
this is his favorite, isn't it, honey?

30
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:30,832
Can you believe they tried to
keep these kids out of the league?

31
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:35,668
All kids should be able to play baseball,
no matter what their skills.

32
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:37,741
Well, l think they heard me
loud and clear.

33
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:40,106
All that aside,
forget l filed the injunction.

34
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,611
Just go out there and have fun.

35
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:45,273
Don't let the legalese crimp
your enthusiasm in any way.

36
00:03:45,685 --> 00:03:47,676
Yeah, l got enthusiasm
flying out my ass.

37
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,446
Got the check?

38
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,296
lt's a shame none of the fathers
could be here.

39
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,759
ls that thing glued to your fingers?

40
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:06,462
l almost forgot.

41
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:09,667
l think it's really important,
what we're doing for the kids.

42
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,173
l feel really good about it, don't you?

43
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,400
Yeah.

44
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,311
Toby, have fun.

45
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,849
- Mr. Buttermaker?
- Yeah.

46
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,994
ls it true you were on the Mariners?

47
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:34,026
Long ago and far away.

48
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,392
Here, carry that.

49
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:39,928
Where do we get the equipment?

50
00:04:40,136 --> 00:04:41,296
Over there.

51
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:44,667
Sorry the stuff's so ratty,
but this is a six-team league,

52
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:50,244
and l'm afraid your boys are getting
the S-H-l-T end of the stick.

53
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:52,614
Yeah, l can spell ''shit,'' all right.

54
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:55,079
Does she think l'm 1 1 ?

55
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:11,363
Girl softball players.

56
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:14,091
l think we all know
what that means, right?

57
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,763
- How you doing? Ray Bullock.
- Hey, Morris Buttermaker--

58
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:20,838
No, no, no.
No introduction necessary.

59
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,872
Morris ''The Blade'' Buttermaker.

60
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:25,636
Carving up batters, one by one.

61
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:29,009
Sound familiar? l used to watch you
over at Regis Field in high school.

62
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:33,414
You were amazing. Man, l was
just a kid, but you owned it.

63
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,883
lt's great you're doing this, Morris.
Really.

64
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:39,114
l mean, a pro. Finally,
somebody who gets it, you know?

65
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,759
l gotta tell you,
a lot of these dads, they don't--

66
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:46,294
They don't understand the dedication
that it takes to run a serious program.

67
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:50,026
No offense, but that ''Ms.'' Whitewood
friend of yours,

68
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:52,260
she's not helping things, you know.

69
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:56,571
l mean, yeah, l get it,
we were a little selective.

70
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,243
Kept some of the lesser players out.

71
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:02,743
But stopping the season
till we complied?

72
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:04,677
Come on.

73
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,845
This is a serious program.

74
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:12,316
Not because l want it that way, either.
lt's for the kids, you know?

75
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:16,052
Listen to me going on and on.
You know what it takes.

76
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,319
Anyway, l think we're gonna
have a lot of fun.

77
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,497
Learn a lot from each other,
you know?

78
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:26,024
You know, l never thought
l'd hear myself say,

79
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:27,998
''Look at the ass
on that second baseman.''

80
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:32,668
But look at the ass
on that second baseman.

81
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:36,776
A lot of brisket butt.

82
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:41,712
All right.

83
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:44,112
Well, listen, l'll see you around.

84
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,619
Or stop by, see me sometime.
l'm over at Chevy Valley Subaru.

85
00:06:48,924 --> 00:06:51,085
''Quality you can drive.''

86
00:06:57,398 --> 00:06:59,628
All you need is a jar of honey
and a glass coffee table.

87
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,529
lt's more fun than a taffy pull,
l promise you.

88
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,034
Buttermaker!

89
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:07,637
Buttermaker, they're here.

90
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:10,503
See you later, Buttermaker.

91
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:12,474
Come on.

92
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,579
Kid, let me explain
something to you, okay?

93
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,422
All right, listen up.

94
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:36,065
- Tanner Boyle.
- Yeah, here.

95
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:41,002
- Mike Engelberg.
- Here.

96
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:44,067
Timmy Lupus?

97
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,302
Timmy Lupus?

98
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,043
Raise your hand, Lupus.
He can't see you sitting behind

99
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,980
- Planet Fat Ass.
- Up your cornhole, Tanner.

100
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,919
Come on, come on.
Play nice.

101
00:08:00,123 --> 00:08:01,681
Hey, hey.
Let go of him.

102
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,061
- Prem Lahiri?
- Present.

103
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:10,563
But you don't have to use me.

104
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,927
l'm just doing this for
my transcript, for college.

105
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:15,294
Okay.

106
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:20,536
Let's see, Toby White--
Oh, Whitewood, l know you're here.

107
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,875
Matthew Hooper?

108
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,477
Matthew Hooper?

109
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:29,116
Okay, no Hooper.

110
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,052
The hell?

111
00:08:31,252 --> 00:08:34,688
Garo Dara-gaga-braga-dagian.
What the hell is that,

112
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,823
- Aztec or something?
- Armenian.

113
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:41,020
Same shit. They both built pyramids.
All right.

114
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,159
- Ahmad Abdul Rahim?
- Here.

115
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:46,725
Yo, bro, what up?

116
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,027
Nothing much. Just ready
to play some baseball.

117
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,867
Twenty-five, huh?

118
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:53,039
- Ken Griffey, right?
- No.

119
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,832
- Satchel Paige?
- No.

120
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,532
No? Willie Mays?

121
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,734
No, it's Mark McGwire.

122
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:01,607
Mark McGwire? But he's a white.

123
00:09:01,814 --> 00:09:04,476
Yes, he's from Claremont.
He's my favorite player.

124
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,913
Okay.

125
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:11,022
Agilar. Miguel and Jose.

126
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,652
You guys twins?

127
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,631
You can save it, son.

128
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,996
l don't understand a damn thing
you're saying, okay?

129
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,861
All right.

130
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:30,041
Got the damn
League of Nations here.

131
00:09:30,242 --> 00:09:33,404
Their dad's our gardener. Mom said
we need them to fill out the team.

132
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:36,203
Okay, let's hit the field. Come on.

133
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:40,008
- Jeez. Could this team be any lamer?
- So there's no Hooper?

134
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:41,445
You don't know
a Matthew Hooper?

135
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,950
- You know where he is?
- Right here.

136
00:09:47,023 --> 00:09:48,684
You gotta be shitting me.

137
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,622
That's right, l'm in a wheelchair.

138
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:56,491
Okay.

139
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:01,194
Charge it.

140
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:04,372
Oh, yeah, that's charging it, all right.

141
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:10,443
Good hustle.

142
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:14,382
There you go, bro.
Another good one.

143
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,380
What's the--?
What's the cripple kid's name?

144
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:18,279
- Hooper.
- Hooper. Hooper!

145
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:20,716
Roll your machine up.

146
00:10:23,558 --> 00:10:26,322
Don't necessarily
have to catch it, l guess.

147
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:28,154
Can't hope for miracles, can you?

148
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,129
You gotta get under the ball.

149
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,905
There's too many gnats out here.

150
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,845
Give me a ball.

151
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,018
What the hell is that,
a baggie full of bacon?

152
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,354
- l'm on Atkins.
- What?

153
00:11:06,564 --> 00:11:08,964
l have to eat all the time
to keep my metabolism up

154
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:11,158
so my body becomes
a fat-burning machine

155
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,738
so assholes like you
don't give me shit all the time!

156
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,199
Easy, sport.

157
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:23,173
All right, get ready. lt's coming at you.
You might want to back up.

158
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,149
Guys, it's a bunt.

159
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,552
You seemed to imply you're
going to hit it out here.

160
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:39,090
Yeah. Engelberg, that's a bunt, bud.

161
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:42,389
You're supposed to pick it up,
throw the guy out at first base, okay?

162
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:45,431
Here we go again,
picking on the fat kid.

163
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:48,570
There's laws against this, you know.
Harassment!

164
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:52,138
You better shut up before l tell
somebody you touched my pecker.

165
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,338
Engelberg, will you throw
the goddamn ball already?

166
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,616
Okay, listen up.

167
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,930
Listen very carefully.

168
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,761
Rule number one:
Don't mess with the Cadillac.

169
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,767
Calm down,
it's a piece of crap anyway.

170
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:28,496
For your information, it's a classic.

171
00:12:29,008 --> 00:12:31,977
And l got half a mind to find your old
man and kick him in the nuts so hard

172
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:35,238
he can never foul the earth
with another little shit like you.

173
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,382
So you keep your trap shut, okay?

174
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,181
We're gonna get laughed at. We only
have a week till the season starts.

175
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,149
Everyone's gonna laugh at us.

176
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:46,789
This game is about a lot more
than talent, son, believe me.

177
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:50,359
l'll say. l left more talent floating
in the shitter this morning

178
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,723
than all you retarded
jerk-offs put together.

179
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:54,693
You got a problem, dingleberry?

180
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,057
Give me a few minutes,
l'll squeeze out a new coach too.

181
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,400
l'll teach you, you little short kid!

182
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:03,937
- Jesus.
- l'll teach you to mess with me.

183
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:06,507
Does your mama change
your underwear too, you little girl?

184
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:25,952
l'm out there with the kids for nothing.
And l'm getting very tired

185
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:28,789
of having to justify myself
to parents who drop the kid off at 4:00,

186
00:13:28,997 --> 00:13:31,158
call me at midnight wondering
why he's so pissed off.

187
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,699
- Ray, you got a minute--?
- l want to say to them, ''l'm not

188
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:35,597
your babysitter. l'm your coach.''

189
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:36,896
Oh, yeah.

190
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,505
Mr. Bill Deaver.

191
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,603
Hey, just checking in.

192
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:45,310
Just checking in. Listen, Ray,
l wanted to see

193
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:49,643
if maybe Jake could get a little
more playing time this season.

194
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:53,685
He's been working hard.
lt would really mean a lot to him.

195
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:57,286
Yeah, sure.

196
00:13:57,492 --> 00:14:00,358
- Why not?
- Really? Well, great.

197
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,055
Thanks a lot, Ray.

198
00:14:04,398 --> 00:14:05,456
Guys.

199
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:09,195
You know, l spoke to your boy.
You know what he said to me?

200
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:11,337
- What?
- He said all that matters to him

201
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:12,971
is that we win.

202
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:16,173
Even if it means giving up
a little game time.

203
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,603
- Really?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,246
l was really touched by this.
He's a hell of a team player.

205
00:14:22,948 --> 00:14:26,213
Thanks, Ray. l appreciate it.

206
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,783
That's the kind of
horseshit l'm talking about.

207
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:31,546
- Exactly.
- Unbelievable.

208
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:42,357
Hey, Buttermaker, you made it.

209
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,125
And you brought...

210
00:14:44,335 --> 00:14:46,199
Oh, this is my friend Paradise.

211
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,394
Hi, nice to meet you.

212
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:51,540
Hey, Buttermaker, you gotta get
your uniform orders in.

213
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:53,402
- Uniforms?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,374
All the good colors are taken:
Black and white, red and white,

215
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,411
blue and white, white and blue,
white and black,

216
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:00,480
white and red. They're all gone.

217
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:02,475
What uniforms?

218
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:07,281
Möchte ich nicht sweet and sour,
okay? No sweet and sour.

219
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,291
Just Cointreau, Patron,
lime juice and superfine salt.

220
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,554
- Yes, ma'am.
- Listen, Whitewood, what's the deal

221
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,789
- with the uniforms?
- What about them?

222
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,558
l didn't-- What's-her-name said
that l gotta have uniforms.

223
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:23,599
Hey, buddy, give me a beer
and a C&C.

224
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:27,605
Buttermaker, you don't actually buy
them. You just need a sponsor.

225
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:29,902
You're the coach, it's your job.

226
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:33,079
Okay, so not only do l have to
coach the bronze medalists

227
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,216
for the Special Olympics, but l gotta be
an Amway salesman too, is that it?

228
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:39,545
Buttermaker, don't turn this
into high drama.

229
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:40,981
Do what other coaches do:

230
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:43,520
Restaurants, sporting goods stores,
you know.

231
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:44,952
You know, l got a job.

232
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,522
l got houses to spray.
lt's ant season, you know?

233
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:53,893
What is it about being a man
that makes everything so hard?

234
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,802
l own my own law firm.

235
00:15:57,003 --> 00:16:00,734
l'm a single mother, and l still
have time for extension courses,

236
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,204
Pilates, the flower-seed business,
pottery--

237
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:07,742
You know what, l'm busy too, okay?
l got important shit to do.

238
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:10,847
l got shit stacked up
all over the place.

239
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:14,382
lmportant man shit, okay?

240
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,989
Come on, Buttermaker, let's go.

241
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,622
Mr. Buttermaker?

242
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,853
- Yeah.
- Where are we going?

243
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,328
l already told you,
to the batting cages.

244
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,831
You guys swing like Helen Keller
at a pinata party.

245
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:08,332
l'm gonna do something about it.

246
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:12,266
-Tell us about the majors, coach.
-You were in the majors?

247
00:17:12,473 --> 00:17:13,872
Yeah, for a little while.

248
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:17,740
Hey, Lupus, don't lean against
that door, bud, all right?

249
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:20,938
Yes, l was recently perusing
baseballstats.org

250
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:24,049
and it said Mr. Buttermaker played
pitcher for the Seattle Mariners

251
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,048
for two-thirds of an inning in 1 984.

252
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,016
Two-thirds, that's it?

253
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,815
Well, it was the end of the season,
you know, September call-ups.

254
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:33,754
Yes, his lifetime ERA was 36.

255
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,019
That's lame.

256
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,389
Yeah, well l closed
the inning out, okay.

257
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,225
There's only a few thousand guys ever
set foot on a major-league mound,

258
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:43,527
and l'm one of them. What have
you done with your life, smart-ass?

259
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,069
Why didn't you stay?

260
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,536
Well, l was gonna come back,
but l had a little incident.

261
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:51,266
l punched an ump.
Really just a bitch-slap.

262
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:53,638
How the hell was l supposed to know
he was a bleeder?

263
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:57,042
Fourteen stitches.
Like that means something.

264
00:17:57,248 --> 00:18:01,309
They used to stitch everything up,
goddamn it. lt was like the Dark Ages.

265
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:04,018
l got stitches on my foot.

266
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:08,351
Oh, yeah?
Well, l'm in a damn wheelchair.

267
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,395
Anyway, after that,
l blew off a few offers,

268
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,728
you know, Japan, shit like that.
You know what l mean?

269
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,037
Shit.

270
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,669
What the hell?

271
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:29,674
ls he okay?

272
00:18:31,014 --> 00:18:32,572
Lupus.

273
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,647
Lupus?

274
00:18:36,786 --> 00:18:38,447
Lupus?

275
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,186
Lupus.

276
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:43,891
What the hell are you grinning at?

277
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,789
You scared the hell out of me.
Don't be leaning on the door.

278
00:18:52,868 --> 00:18:54,358
How many are in there?

279
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,696
The infestation's quite advanced.

280
00:18:57,972 --> 00:19:00,372
All right, pull the pin. Throw it.

281
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:15,178
There you go. Good job, buddy.
Good job, man. You're a natural.

282
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,618
A natural at that shit.

283
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,889
Thanks.

284
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:26,628
Die! Die! How do you like that, huh?

285
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,226
Hey, you sprayed my foot,
dumb-ass.

286
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:31,835
Oh, yeah?

287
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,272
Stop it!

288
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:43,206
That shit's expensive, all right?

289
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:51,520
Hey, coach,
what's ''carcinogen'' mean?

290
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,419
Liberal propaganda.
Don't worry about it. lt's just bullshit.

291
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,253
Buttermaker, l got these
behind the garage.

292
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,487
Throw them in the garbage,
in the house.

293
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,334
Hey, save the traps, will you?

294
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,330
Thanks for holding
the fort down, buddy.

295
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:16,208
l got something for you.
You're gonna dig this.

296
00:20:16,412 --> 00:20:18,846
Hey, guys, come here a minute.

297
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:21,374
l got something for you.

298
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:29,179
Now you can quit your bitching
about the whole uniform thing.

299
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:30,722
Here you go.

300
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,517
- Harper. Heads up, buddy.
- Awesome!

301
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:34,217
Hooper.

302
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:52,107
Cannonball!

303
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:54,948
Jesus Christ.

304
00:20:55,149 --> 00:21:00,086
Hey, Engelberg, if you do that again,
you'll learn how to surf.

305
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:03,714
Mr. Buttermaker,
we have a game tomorrow.

306
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:06,118
Shouldn't we be practicing?

307
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,823
Lupus, alcohol.

308
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:16,926
Excellent. God bless you.

309
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:22,471
- You got a future, Lupus.
- You ever play with anyone famous?

310
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:24,471
Hell, yeah, l played with people
who are famous.

311
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:27,702
What do you think? l mean,
l was in the game, you know.

312
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,608
Oh, l know one.

313
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:33,546
One time l struck out Mike Schmidt
in an exhibition game.

314
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:37,254
Struck his ass right out. Yeah, l did.

315
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,049
lt was 1 980.

316
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:44,658
lt was two outs,
bottom of the seventh inning.

317
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,057
lt was the bottom of the seventh--
Top of the seventh.

318
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,233
lt was top of the seventh.

319
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:54,095
And when l put my foot on that rubber,
l was zoned in, man.

320
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,864
lt was just one
of those times when...

321
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:00,807
You just know you got
your shit working, you know?

322
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:07,780
All right, tubby, l'm gonna throw you
something called a screwball.

323
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:12,043
lt's an old-school thing. Now, it's gonna
look like it's coming right at you,

324
00:22:12,254 --> 00:22:14,848
but it's gonna drop right off the table.
So you don't bail out,

325
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:17,787
you gotta stick in there.
You see what l'm saying?

326
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,090
Son of a bitch!

327
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,025
Shake it off.

328
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:26,027
Next.

329
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,334
- Damn it!
- l know it stings a little bit,

330
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:33,336
but it's worth it.

331
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:35,608
Okay, here it comes.

332
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:40,675
lt's all right, kid. You had a helmet on.
lmagine if you didn't.

333
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:42,542
You know what l'm saying?

334
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:46,185
What are you doing, Buttermaker?

335
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:54,922
Okay, coming at you.

336
00:23:03,802 --> 00:23:05,770
Mr. Buttermaker?

337
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:09,040
- ls he dead?
- Hell, no. He's drunk.

338
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:11,174
The season starts tomorrow.

339
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:14,239
We don't got our positions,
batting order, nothing.

340
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:16,913
- What are we going to do?
- We ain't ready to play.

341
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:19,310
We got nothing but a boozer
for a coach.

342
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,279
We can wait till he sobers up.

343
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:23,954
- Yeah, right.
- Nothing else we can do.

344
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:28,221
Screw this, l'm taking his wallet.

345
00:23:32,462 --> 00:23:35,192
- Give me! Give me--
- Hey, watch it!

346
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:38,095
- Leave me alone!
- Give me that!

347
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,788
Right this way. Good.

348
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:15,667
Because in this time of terror,

349
00:24:15,903 --> 00:24:17,996
there is one thing we all need:

350
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:19,638
the grace of our Lord,

351
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:22,542
our heroes overseas,

352
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,978
and baseball.

353
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,806
''Casey at the Bat'' by Ernest Thayer.

354
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,349
The outlook wasn't brilliant
for the Mudville nine that day.

355
00:24:34,554 --> 00:24:37,045
- The score stood 4 to 2...
- What a fag.

356
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,113
Buttermaker, where have you been?

357
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,151
You missed the team photo.

358
00:25:11,355 --> 00:25:13,448
l was just getting Gatorade
for the guys, you know.

359
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:20,263
Well, we need to talk about this.
My son can't wear this.

360
00:25:21,731 --> 00:25:24,063
We'll get him another size.
No big deal.

361
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,927
That's not what l'm talking about.

362
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:30,470
Look, it's a legitimate business,
honey.

363
00:25:30,673 --> 00:25:33,106
You know, they pay taxes
like everybody else.

364
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:53,725
All right, can you believe it?
lt's here, opening day.

365
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,989
Well, we got a lot of great athletes
this year,

366
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:59,462
and l'm looking forward to
a great season.

367
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,635
Before we get started,
l do want to remind you

368
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:04,201
that it is Summer Discount Days
at Valley Chevy Subaru.

369
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:08,568
So come on down if you get a chance.
Meanwhile, so many volunteers--

370
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,435
And people that l want to thank--

371
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:16,709
Hey, hey, hey!

372
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,375
What is he--? What's his--?

373
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:21,519
Hey, get-- Get the hell off my field!

374
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:25,319
l'll deal with you later,
you little punk.

375
00:26:31,864 --> 00:26:37,267
Okay, let's welcome all our teams.

376
00:26:39,804 --> 00:26:41,465
We got...

377
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:47,241
Ray Bullock and our returning
champs, the Yankees.

378
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:54,879
Lenny Hendricks and the Giants.

379
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:02,449
Ex-Mariner, Morris Buttermaker
and the Bears.

380
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,921
Bob Jones and the White Sox.

381
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:11,828
Play ball!

382
00:27:18,474 --> 00:27:21,533
There you go, Mitch. There you go!

383
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:24,107
Round it, round it, round it!

384
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:29,113
There you go!

385
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:30,511
Alrighty.

386
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,482
That's it!

387
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:36,381
Number 9, Joey Bullock.

388
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,454
That's it, that's it, that's it.

389
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,595
Go!

390
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:46,259
Joey! Joey!

391
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,399
That's my boy. We worked on that.

392
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:54,471
The Yankees lead 3-nothing.

393
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,371
Way to go, sweetie.

394
00:27:58,945 --> 00:27:59,912
That's your boy.

395
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:03,640
- Next, number 3, Danny Patello.
- Let's go, Danny!

396
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,556
Go two, go two, go two!

397
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:48,206
What do you think, Lupus?

398
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:51,775
Sometimes bird poo
tastes like candy.

399
00:29:57,423 --> 00:30:00,016
Aren't you supposed
to be in left field?

400
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:05,821
Shit.

401
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,065
Where you going, coach?

402
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:11,565
Keep your drawers on, officer,
l'll get back to you.

403
00:30:12,304 --> 00:30:13,669
Hey, Bullock.

404
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:17,235
Morris ''The Blade.''

405
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:20,539
- l'm calling it.
- What? What are you talking about?

406
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:24,043
l'm calling the game. The kids are
getting creamed out there, you know?

407
00:30:24,248 --> 00:30:26,808
- Yeah, it's a bloodbath.
- Yeah.

408
00:30:27,017 --> 00:30:29,577
- That'll make quitters out of them.
- They don't have to quit.

409
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,310
They're losing, can't you see?

410
00:30:31,554 --> 00:30:35,115
The 1 0-run rule kicks in after three.
l think you should hang on.

411
00:30:35,325 --> 00:30:38,556
Yeah, then after that,
maybe you think about...

412
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,922
- What?
- You know, dropping out.

413
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:46,593
- What did you say?
- Dropping out of the league.

414
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:47,996
Morris, this isn't going to work.

415
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:50,171
They don't know the fundamentals
of the game out here.

416
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:51,999
Save them the humiliation.

417
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:54,937
You don't give two shits
about these kids. l'm calling the game.

418
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:56,405
Hey, l'm just trying to help.

419
00:30:56,611 --> 00:31:00,445
Where's the honor and respect for the
game from the former pro, by the way?

420
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:04,448
Who the hell are you, Shoeless Joe
walking out of the holy cornfield?

421
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:06,779
l don't buy that shit.
l'm calling the game.

422
00:31:06,987 --> 00:31:08,789
All right, call it. Quit. Quit
the whole league. What l just said.

423
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:12,657
All right, call it. Quit. Quit
the whole league. What l just said.

424
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,259
- Forfeit.
- Time!

425
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:15,554
lt's over.

426
00:31:15,763 --> 00:31:19,721
Bears forfeit! Game over!

427
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,761
One, two, three, Bears!

428
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,677
You guys look like
the last shit l took.

429
00:31:35,647 --> 00:31:40,448
- lt's not that bad, but--
- Shut the hell up, drunk bastard!

430
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:45,287
Okay.

431
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:47,849
Hey, Bears,
thanks for batting practice.

432
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,390
Yeah, you guys suck.

433
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:52,119
- l'll give you batting practice!
- Come here. Come here.

434
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,458
- Get down off of there.
- Get your hands off of me!

435
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:05,532
Thanks. l really needed another
reason for people to laugh at me.

436
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:24,988
- Need a ride?
- Go away.

437
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:27,288
Come on, hop in.
l'll take you home.

438
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,861
l'm not going home.

439
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:42,770
All right, what's wrong?

440
00:32:43,111 --> 00:32:45,102
My dad's not from here.

441
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:47,338
He thinks baseball's stupid.

442
00:32:48,483 --> 00:32:51,077
He says l should just worry
about school and work.

443
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:53,617
But l want to do the things
my friends do.

444
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:56,085
You know, American things.

445
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,758
He said if l played,
l'd just embarrass myself.

446
00:32:59,193 --> 00:33:01,388
l guess he was right.

447
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:05,894
l'm just gonna run away.

448
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:07,926
Where are you gonna go?

449
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:10,295
Salt Lake City.

450
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,770
Why the hell would you want
to go there?

451
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:16,303
l hear it looks like Washington D.C.

452
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:20,540
Listen, kid, you don't want
to go to Salt Lake, trust me.

453
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:22,509
They don't even like Africans
up there.

454
00:33:22,715 --> 00:33:25,478
- Armenian.
- Yeah, right.

455
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,949
- Anyway, l think l can help you.
- Yeah?

456
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:32,020
- Yep.
- How?

457
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:33,248
Here's what you do.

458
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,452
You go home, you look your old
man straight in the eye, and you say,

459
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,788
''Guess what, Dad, we won today.''
You know.

460
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:42,966
- But we didn't win.
- Well, l know that.

461
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,200
You lie your ass off. lt's the only way.
Look, this is America.

462
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:49,706
Besides that, you know,
he's not going to know.

463
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:51,932
He's from Riki Tiki Tavi,
or wherever the hell it is.

464
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:53,871
l used to do it with my pop
all the time.

465
00:33:54,078 --> 00:33:56,568
- Really?
- Yeah. You just tell them

466
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,579
what they want to hear. You know,
''l didn't take the stereo.''

467
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:06,113
''l don't smoke.'' ''She said
she was 1 8.'' You know, stuff like that.

468
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:09,018
lt's all part of growing up.
The important thing is that you're right,

469
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:10,919
and they're wrong.

470
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:15,659
Maybe l'll just tell him we tied.

471
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,733
You could do that. That'll work.

472
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:23,268
Now, come on,
l'll take you home. Let's go.

473
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:31,103
A hundred and eighty bucks?

474
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,647
That's Norma Kamali. lt's vintage.

475
00:34:33,848 --> 00:34:35,577
They can't even make rayon
like that anymore.

476
00:34:35,783 --> 00:34:37,512
- Really?
- Hey, does your mother know

477
00:34:37,718 --> 00:34:39,276
you're selling that crap?

478
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:40,749
What are you doing here?

479
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:42,648
Just passing by.

480
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,423
After three years?

481
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,090
Three years?
lt's been three years?

482
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:52,664
Well, you sure are growing up fast,
that's for sure.

483
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,033
Not fast enough, if you ask me.

484
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:57,503
There's plenty of time for that,
honey.

485
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,838
Just like that story about the caterpillar
who's crawling along like a worm,

486
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,636
and then the next thing you know,
he's in that cocoon...

487
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,803
...and bam!
''Look at me now, l'm...

488
00:35:09,748 --> 00:35:12,444
...a moth.''
Or whatever the hell they turn into.

489
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:14,140
l don't want wings.

490
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:16,513
l want nice hips and C cups.

491
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:19,121
Hey, don't talk like that.
What's wrong with you?

492
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:21,087
Come on.

493
00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:25,687
So how's your mom?

494
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:27,728
She's fine. What do you care?

495
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,427
Amanda, listen, just because we
didn't get along so well all the time,

496
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:33,569
doesn't mean l don't
care about her, okay?

497
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:36,635
You know, adults, they...

498
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,738
Sometimes, l don't know, it's just--
lt's like that story l was telling you

499
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:41,808
about the caterpillar
and the worm deal.

500
00:35:42,012 --> 00:35:44,572
You just walked out, you jerk.
You could have said goodbye.

501
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:46,042
Well, l'm sorry.

502
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:49,183
So, what do you want?
Why are you here?

503
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,648
l'm coaching a team out in the Valley,
and l was just thinking, you know,

504
00:35:54,857 --> 00:35:58,258
maybe you might want
to come play with us.

505
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:01,588
No way. l'm a woman now,
and we don't do that kind of thing.

506
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,824
Well, sure you do.
Girls play baseball all the time.

507
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,361
Besides that, you owe me.

508
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,168
l was like a dad to you.

509
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:11,565
A drunk, lazy dad.

510
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:14,537
You made me climb under houses
looking for rats.

511
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:17,506
Well, that's what my dad did.
Builds character.

512
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:21,203
- This guy bothering you, Amanda?
- No, it's okay. He was just going.

513
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:24,782
Go away, Boilermaker.
You're scaring off the clientele.

514
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:31,184
Designer jeans.
Calvins, Jordache, certified vintage.

515
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,255
What do you say there, Hooper?

516
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:39,090
Feeling ready today?
Gonna go get them?

517
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,958
What's with the eye patch?

518
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,796
You gonna swab the on-deck circle
for us, matey?

519
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:46,335
Playing pirate?

520
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:49,507
Mom says l have cancer of the eye.

521
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,412
What the hell's wrong
with you guys?

522
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,939
We don't want to play no more.

523
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:03,343
We took a vote.
We're disbanding the team.

524
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,683
So one game, you want to quit,
is that it?

525
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,985
We've been taking
a lot of crap in school.

526
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,095
By ''crap,'' he means ridicule.

527
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,463
And de-pantsing.

528
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:21,964
- lt's been tough.
- Really? Tough, huh?

529
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,907
What the hell happened
to you, Tanner?

530
00:37:27,877 --> 00:37:29,572
Got in a fight.

531
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:35,913
- With who?
- The sixth grade.

532
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:38,052
The sixth grade.

533
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:40,951
So l guess you
want to quit too, huh?

534
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,552
Okay.

535
00:37:46,662 --> 00:37:49,790
Look, guys, l know l've been lazy...

536
00:37:50,065 --> 00:37:55,331
...and irresponsible, and a few
other things l could mention.

537
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,297
And l've let you down.

538
00:38:00,641 --> 00:38:02,541
l mean, you know,
l've been an asshole.

539
00:38:02,744 --> 00:38:05,872
- You know, go ahead and say it--
- You're an asshole.

540
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,948
When l say, ''say it,'' l mean,
you know, it's a figure of speech.

541
00:38:14,154 --> 00:38:17,282
Baseball's hard, guys.
l mean, it really is.

542
00:38:17,724 --> 00:38:20,852
You can love it, but believe me,
it don't always love you back.

543
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:24,188
lt's kind of like dating
a German chick, you know?

544
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:31,401
But what l do know is that once you
start quitting, it's a hard thing to stop.

545
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:36,439
l've quit just about everything
l ever tried in my life.

546
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:40,100
And as far as l can tell,

547
00:38:40,311 --> 00:38:42,836
my life hasn't added up to
much more than a shitbag

548
00:38:43,047 --> 00:38:46,312
full of empty promises. And l'm
not going to put that on you guys.

549
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,617
l haven't been as good a coach
as l can be. l know l can do it

550
00:38:52,824 --> 00:38:56,759
because l know this game,
you know? And...

551
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:02,187
And we can do better, and a lot
of that's my responsibility, so...

552
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:07,062
l know you're down...

553
00:39:07,905 --> 00:39:11,601
...but let's get our stuff together,
and go hit the field.

554
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:14,232
Okay?

555
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:21,306
- You with me?
- Like l said, we took a vote.

556
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:24,848
This is not a democracy!

557
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:28,113
lt is a dictatorship, and l'm Hitler!

558
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:30,188
You understand me?

559
00:39:30,392 --> 00:39:34,829
So get your stuff,
and get your asses on the field!

560
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:36,921
This Saturday we play the Athletics.

561
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:38,895
And you know what
that means for the Athletics?

562
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,660
Bad news for the Athletics,
that's what it means.

563
00:39:43,304 --> 00:39:45,295
All right, guys.
Keep the ball in front of you.

564
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:50,068
Keep your knees bent, your butt down.
That way if it hops either way...

565
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:52,643
See? You use your legs. All right?

566
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:57,973
You wanna run this way.
Catch the ball like that.

567
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,216
Yeah!

568
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:04,451
Nice!

569
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:17,599
Swivel on the back foot, throw your
hips, and keep your eye on the ball.

570
00:40:17,803 --> 00:40:21,330
You follow the ball right into here.
You see that? Okay?

571
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,973
Try it, spark plug.

572
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:28,544
Swing out a little bit
when you run around the base.

573
00:40:28,746 --> 00:40:30,077
You want to point in this direction.

574
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:31,805
Left foot on the inside of the bag.

575
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:33,950
You're gonna push off
that left foot.

576
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:39,379
What's with the patch?

577
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,924
Nothing. Cat scratched me.
But don't tell Buttermaker.

578
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:45,594
Dying.

579
00:40:46,463 --> 00:40:48,021
Dying.

580
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:50,799
You know,
there's a Mennonite anecdote

581
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:52,525
about a simple farm hand

582
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,534
who lifted a calf every morning
until one day

583
00:40:55,739 --> 00:40:57,707
he found himself able
to lift a cow.

584
00:40:57,908 --> 00:41:00,239
- What the hell does that mean?
- lf we stay focused,

585
00:41:00,442 --> 00:41:02,433
eventually our strength will build.

586
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:04,579
That's the dorkiest shit l've ever heard.

587
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,876
Come on, guys! Two more laps!
You're dragging ass!

588
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:11,348
Nice tits, Engelberg.

589
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,951
Jesus.

590
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:14,918
Buttermaker.

591
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:17,515
Glad l caught you.

592
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:19,986
l feel like we got off
on the wrong foot last week.

593
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:22,822
Said some things we
didn't mean, you know.

594
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,525
Let's forget about it, huh?

595
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:27,391
Sorry.

596
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,668
All right.

597
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,906
All right...

598
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:42,343
...you're sorry too, or...?

599
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:45,818
l said all right. Okay?

600
00:41:55,361 --> 00:41:58,489
- How's that?
- How's what?

601
00:41:58,698 --> 00:42:00,359
You feel that?

602
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,699
Feel what?

603
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:09,168
You know, your face
is turning a little red, Ray.

604
00:42:09,474 --> 00:42:11,874
So, you know, what it might be

605
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:15,410
is those gym shorts might be
a little tight for you.

606
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:18,240
Looks like you're smuggling grapes
down there.

607
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:21,346
Smells like somebody ate
a fifth of Scotch for lunch again.

608
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:24,180
Not that it's any of your business,
you know.

609
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:27,619
- Really?
- But maybe. So...

610
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,887
All right. You know what, you keep
stinking up the ballpark, Buttermaker.

611
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,654
Yeah, okay.

612
00:42:34,998 --> 00:42:37,091
You play your game,
we'll play ours, Ray. How's that?

613
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,564
Well, good luck with that.

614
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:44,671
The championship game's
gonna be a lot of fun.

615
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:47,809
lt would be more fun
if you guys were there, huh?

616
00:42:48,177 --> 00:42:49,644
Oh, we'll be there, Morris.

617
00:42:49,846 --> 00:42:51,745
Don't worry about that.

618
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:53,914
Hey, l know all about you.

619
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:58,177
Minor league junkballer. What did
you have, five seconds in the majors?

620
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:01,788
May work with the ladies,
but that crap doesn't work out here.

621
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:04,389
These kids need role models.

622
00:43:05,093 --> 00:43:07,026
And you're not it.

623
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,490
Have a nice night, Ray.

624
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:13,762
Strike three!

625
00:43:17,238 --> 00:43:19,934
Engelberg,
l got something special for you.

626
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:23,132
- lt's for power hitters.
- Thanks, coach.

627
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:32,508
Now batting for the Bears,
number 20, Mike Engelberg.

628
00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:39,319
- What the hell is this?
- l don't know.

629
00:43:39,525 --> 00:43:42,050
Buttermaker, what the hell
are you trying to pull?

630
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:44,161
Hey, it's a league bat, okay?

631
00:43:44,363 --> 00:43:47,127
You're on thin ice, pal.
You try one more stunt like this again,

632
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:49,596
l'm gonna bounce you
out of the league.

633
00:43:50,436 --> 00:43:52,960
Listen, Kevin, l don't think
it's gonna work out, buddy.

634
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,036
l still get paid though, right?

635
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,572
Well, sure. What do you think l am,
some asshole?

636
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,768
Here.

637
00:44:04,315 --> 00:44:07,842
''Mombai''? You really went
all out for this one, didn't you?

638
00:44:08,052 --> 00:44:10,178
lt's good enough to get your
little ass drunk for a month.

639
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:12,787
Now, come on, get out of here.
You're creeping the kids out.

640
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:15,253
Drop dead, asshole.

641
00:44:16,726 --> 00:44:22,062
And the final score:
Athletics, 9, Bears, nothing.

642
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:24,824
Good job.

643
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:27,764
Kiss my ass. Kiss my ass.

644
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,164
Bitch.

645
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:31,066
Suck it.

646
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:32,604
What are you smiling at, Henry?

647
00:44:32,808 --> 00:44:36,744
Up the alley, down the street,
who's the toughest team to beat?

648
00:44:36,946 --> 00:44:40,540
Bears! Bears! Yay, Bears!

649
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:48,515
Hey, come on, guys.

650
00:44:49,224 --> 00:44:52,387
Sit up straight, you look like
a bunch of hound dogs.

651
00:44:54,596 --> 00:44:56,392
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

652
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,997
You got a few hits today.

653
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:01,733
You played all six innings.

654
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:05,037
- You ought to be proud of yourselves.
- Proud of what?

655
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:07,537
These things take time, guys.

656
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,335
- So does heart disease.
- And torture.

657
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,033
And physical therapy.

658
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:18,344
l did do some simple flowcharting
and data analysis.

659
00:45:18,584 --> 00:45:21,576
And if you graph out our errors
and other parameters,

660
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:23,254
compared to the last game,

661
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:26,084
we've actually improved
by a considerable percentage.

662
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:27,724
Great.

663
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:30,753
We went from suck to stink.

664
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:34,659
See, that's the spirit.
We're getting better.

665
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:38,095
Now, Friday we play the Angels.

666
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,071
Now, what does that mean
for the Angels?

667
00:45:41,273 --> 00:45:44,298
- Bad news for the Angels.
- You're damn right, it does.

668
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:47,705
Now, come on. Get off your asses,
and let's go get some hot dogs

669
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:52,212
and some Sunny D or whatever
the hell you guys drink these days.

670
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,395
Just leave me alone
will you, Buttermaker.

671
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:13,125
l'm too young to have a stalker.

672
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:15,633
Come on, Amanda,
just a few games, please?

673
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:17,270
l need to make money.

674
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:21,431
l need to buy clothes, makeup.
l'm saving up for a car.

675
00:46:21,977 --> 00:46:23,376
You wear makeup?

676
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:29,449
What happened to
the Barbie oven with the muffin light?

677
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:33,211
That was like 20 years ago.
l'm all grown up now.

678
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:35,616
Yeah, you're probably right.

679
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,657
l'm sure your arm
sucks now, anyhow.

680
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,694
God, that is so lame.
Reverse psychology?

681
00:46:43,898 --> 00:46:47,060
You're such a loser.
Man, you must have a big one,

682
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:49,258
because l don't know what else
my mom saw in you.

683
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:52,302
You're not supposed to be
talking about my-- My one.

684
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:53,972
You're 1 2 years old.

685
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:56,972
As far as you know,
l'm like G.l. Joe down there, okay?

686
00:46:57,177 --> 00:46:59,111
l have the lnternet, you know.
l'm not stupid.

687
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,146
Just come play with us, will you?

688
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:06,181
lt'll be fun.

689
00:47:07,052 --> 00:47:10,021
l'll pay for the clothes, okay?

690
00:47:10,222 --> 00:47:12,053
And l'll help you out with the car

691
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:13,748
when it gets to that time.

692
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:18,986
- But you know, you just--
- No. Don't you get it? Just no.

693
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:24,293
All right,
l've been disappointed before.

694
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:55,597
All right, guys, listen up.

695
00:47:55,798 --> 00:47:58,392
This is Amanda Whurlitzer.
She's your new pitcher.

696
00:47:59,235 --> 00:48:00,998
A girl?

697
00:48:01,203 --> 00:48:02,693
What's next, a cripple?

698
00:48:02,905 --> 00:48:06,032
Oh, l forgot.

699
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:09,300
Dick.

700
00:48:10,578 --> 00:48:13,741
Hey, ain't you ever heard
of ''throws like a girl''?

701
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:17,041
No, l never heard that.
Get a mitt, fat-ass.

702
00:48:40,907 --> 00:48:43,535
l think l just entered puberty.

703
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:45,568
Come on, Amanda.

704
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:48,246
Strike three!

705
00:48:48,781 --> 00:48:52,773
Up next, number 1 8, Justin Cahill.

706
00:49:03,495 --> 00:49:04,962
He's out!

707
00:49:05,163 --> 00:49:06,755
Now batting for the Angels,
second baseman

708
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:11,226
- Yanek Goldanueva.
- Hey, Hooper, check this out.

709
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:14,868
She's gonna come with a changeup,
l can tell.

710
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:16,403
She's psyching him out.

711
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:18,834
A changeup is when it looks
like it's gonna be a fastball,

712
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:20,908
but she takes a little off of it.

713
00:49:22,646 --> 00:49:24,806
Strike three! You're out!

714
00:49:27,684 --> 00:49:29,379
Ball four! Take your base.

715
00:49:29,753 --> 00:49:32,517
Come on, somebody hit something.

716
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:35,782
Next batter, Ahmad Abdul Rahim.

717
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,491
Go!

718
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:48,164
Safe!

719
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:51,833
Ahmad.

720
00:49:56,644 --> 00:49:58,271
Garo.

721
00:49:59,046 --> 00:50:01,571
Next up for the Bears,
Toby Whitewood.

722
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,315
Toby.

723
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:12,086
Ball!

724
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:18,654
Watch this, Hooper.

725
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:21,732
The catcher's good.
Just good enough to get in trouble.

726
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:28,131
Strike one!

727
00:50:29,341 --> 00:50:30,740
Run, run, run!

728
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,178
Safe!

729
00:50:33,379 --> 00:50:34,778
Yes!

730
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:40,477
All right, way to go, guys. Way to go!
Good hustle!

731
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:44,247
They're playing ball now, man.
They're playing ball.

732
00:50:53,231 --> 00:50:54,755
Ball four! Take your base.

733
00:50:54,966 --> 00:50:57,264
Come on, guys! Let's hold them!

734
00:50:57,469 --> 00:51:00,767
- Number 28, Tyler Cohen.
- Can't win if they don't score.

735
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:06,609
Way to go, Miguel!
Good catch, buddy!

736
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:10,175
Way to go!
We need two more, guys. Two more.

737
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:13,882
Strike three!

738
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,347
Come on, guys! Two out.

739
00:51:16,552 --> 00:51:18,884
We need one more, Amanda.
Shut them down, honey.

740
00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:32,697
Get under it! Get under it!

741
00:51:35,403 --> 00:51:37,735
Throw it! Throw the ball! Hurry!

742
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:47,239
Safe!

743
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:51,912
What the hell is wrong
with you, dipshit?

744
00:51:53,621 --> 00:51:55,680
Come on, guys, gather in.

745
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:08,429
Garo, that was nice hustle
out there today.

746
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:12,267
And, Jose, muy bueno, buddy.

747
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:16,101
Engelberg, you caught a hell
of a game. You all did good today.

748
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:19,536
Everyone except you,
you booger-eating moron.

749
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:21,645
Can't you catch one goddamn ball?

750
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,645
- Come on, Tanner.
- Even l could have caught that,

751
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,340
and look at me.

752
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,987
- Can't even move.
- Hey, guys, come on.

753
00:52:28,987 --> 00:52:29,954
- Can't even move.
- Hey, guys, come on.

754
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:32,248
lt's like l told you before,
there's no ''l'' in team.

755
00:52:32,456 --> 00:52:36,517
- Yeah, but there's an M and an E.
- There should be an F and a U.

756
00:52:36,727 --> 00:52:41,255
Hey, hey. Don't fall apart at the seams
on me now. Come on, guys.

757
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:44,134
Remember how bad
we sucked two weeks ago?

758
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:46,701
They smelled that shit up in Fresno.

759
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:49,333
You almost won today.

760
00:52:49,706 --> 00:52:51,867
Hold your heads up high.

761
00:52:52,876 --> 00:52:54,104
Everybody in.

762
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:56,278
Let's go.

763
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:59,642
- Ready. One, two, three.
- Bears!

764
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:03,341
Good hit. That was a good one.
Choke up on your bat.

765
00:53:03,886 --> 00:53:05,717
About that far, okay?

766
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:08,048
Put it back on your shoulder.
Back here.

767
00:53:08,257 --> 00:53:10,782
There you go, all right?

768
00:53:13,062 --> 00:53:14,962
Excellent. There you go.

769
00:53:17,299 --> 00:53:20,495
Yes, sir. Good cut, honey.

770
00:53:20,702 --> 00:53:22,863
Last pitch, guys!

771
00:53:34,983 --> 00:53:36,916
All right, guys, let's bring it in!

772
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,320
Sister Sledge, that kid's got
an arm on him. Who is that?

773
00:53:44,524 --> 00:53:46,014
That's Kelly Leak.

774
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:49,491
Yep, he's a real badass.

775
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:54,357
l heard he spent two years in juvie.

776
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:56,392
You don't know how old he is,
do you?

777
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:59,435
He's in our grade,
but he dates an eighth-grader.

778
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:02,073
Someone told me he got
a teacher pregnant.

779
00:54:02,274 --> 00:54:04,538
l heard he broke some kid's arm
who owed him money.

780
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:06,541
Why, l heard he broke
both of his arms.

781
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:10,441
l heard he puts money under
your pillow when you lose a tooth.

782
00:54:10,649 --> 00:54:14,676
- That's the tooth fairy, you homo.
- Actually, he only broke one arm.

783
00:54:14,886 --> 00:54:17,252
The other was just a minor fracture
at the base of the humerus.

784
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:20,253
Who cares about that crap.
Can he play?

785
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:22,788
You kidding? You saw that arm.

786
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,955
l don't know, honey.

787
00:54:28,399 --> 00:54:29,491
l'll be fine.

788
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:34,231
l don't like the looks of the place.
l mean, look at those creeps.

789
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,099
- l'll be fine. l'm cool.
- You sure?

790
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,864
- Yeah.
- You don't want me to go with you?

791
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,041
No, l'm good.

792
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,039
Listen, don't talk to anybody
but what's-his-ass.

793
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,905
l'll be fine.

794
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:46,508
Amanda?

795
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,240
- Shut up.
- Okay.

796
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,559
l bet l could do what you just did.
lt's easy.

797
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,566
- How much?
- l pull it off,

798
00:55:10,771 --> 00:55:12,932
- you come play for the Bears.
- And if you don't?

799
00:55:13,507 --> 00:55:14,838
Whatever you want.

800
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:17,439
Deal.

801
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,455
- Well, what happened?
- No deal.

802
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,721
No deal?

803
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,294
l thought you said you
were good at this.

804
00:55:36,496 --> 00:55:39,294
l am. He's better.

805
00:55:40,934 --> 00:55:42,332
See you later.

806
00:55:47,172 --> 00:55:48,639
What does that mean?

807
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,867
''l'll see you later''?
l thought you said he was out.

808
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:55,137
He is. l just lost the bet, and now
l have to go out with him.

809
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,713
You have to go out with him?
You mean out like ''out''?

810
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:04,149
You're 1 2.
There ain't no out when you're 1 2.

811
00:56:04,355 --> 00:56:07,722
Calm down, Boilermaker.
lt's just a show with some stupid band.

812
00:56:07,925 --> 00:56:11,588
l'm not a little girl anymore.
l had my period, all right.

813
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:14,320
Do you want me to have
a stroke or something?

814
00:56:14,531 --> 00:56:17,022
Shut up. l'll be fine.

815
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:20,132
Well, l'm going
to the concert with you.

816
00:56:20,337 --> 00:56:22,703
Whatever.
lt's just some dumb skate band.

817
00:56:22,906 --> 00:56:26,501
- What the hell is a skate band?
- You know, a skate band.

818
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:27,734
The Bloodfarts.

819
00:56:28,245 --> 00:56:31,008
Bloodfarts. The Bloodfarts?

820
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:34,307
Oh, l'm going with you.
Bet your ass on that.

821
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,986
No doubt. l'm going with you.

822
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:43,680
Strike three!

823
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:49,697
Strike three!

824
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,860
Strike three!

825
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,063
- Way to go, Amanda. Good game.
- Pitched a good game, Amanda.

826
00:56:59,274 --> 00:57:02,970
No shit. Too bad we couldn't
even score one run.

827
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:07,006
Well, that's okay. We're doing better.

828
00:57:07,214 --> 00:57:09,114
We tied, guys.

829
00:57:09,316 --> 00:57:13,377
l know a tie's a lot like kissing your
sister, as my old coach used to say.

830
00:57:13,587 --> 00:57:16,054
But the way we've been coming
along, it's more like kissing

831
00:57:16,255 --> 00:57:18,689
a really hot stepsister,
or something like that, you know,

832
00:57:18,891 --> 00:57:21,291
that you don't have
so much tied up in.

833
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:27,922
But anyway, l think-- l'm just saying,
pat yourselves on the back.

834
00:57:30,636 --> 00:57:34,867
Stay focused.
l'll catch up with you guys.

835
00:57:35,073 --> 00:57:36,563
Kelly, how you doing?

836
00:57:36,775 --> 00:57:39,539
- Hey, coach.
- l haven't seen you around.

837
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:41,735
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

838
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:46,509
Wait. l have seen you around. We
haven't even talked since you pulled

839
00:57:46,718 --> 00:57:49,311
that little Evel Knievel stunt
the other day out there, huh?

840
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,579
What's an ''Evel Knievel''?

841
00:57:54,058 --> 00:57:57,858
Don't be a smart-ass. l could have
called the cops on you for that.

842
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:02,129
- Thanks, l'm real scared.
- No, l'm serious.

843
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:05,995
Vandalizing public property.
Disturbing the peace.

844
00:58:06,202 --> 00:58:08,796
You're too young to be riding
that thing, you know.

845
00:58:09,806 --> 00:58:11,671
You're just a kid.

846
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:16,372
Kelly, this field, it's for ball players.
lt's not for quitters.

847
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:21,606
lf it was for quitters,
it would be your field. But it's not.

848
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,041
l'd call your dad,
if anybody knew where he was.

849
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:27,017
- Listen, old man--
- Hey, now, you listen to me.

850
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:30,224
Nobody wants you around here,
all right?

851
00:58:30,592 --> 00:58:32,150
Do you understand?

852
00:58:35,396 --> 00:58:38,024
Do you think people like
seeing your nuts?

853
00:58:53,013 --> 00:58:54,981
Hey, look who it is.

854
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:58,412
Yeah, it's the Bears' best player.

855
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,554
Hope you're not getting wet!

856
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,153
Nobody picks on him but me!

857
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,831
Let's go! Come on!

858
00:59:26,377 --> 00:59:29,744
Yeah, that's right.
Run away, bitches!

859
00:59:42,459 --> 00:59:44,359
Nobody ever stood up for me before.

860
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:49,624
Yeah? Maybe if you weren't such
a spaz all the time, l wouldn't have to.

861
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:56,570
All right, guys,
inside corner of the bag.

862
00:59:58,407 --> 01:00:00,170
Hey, guys. . .

863
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:03,674
...let's bring it in.
Come on, to the dugout.

864
01:00:03,879 --> 01:00:05,471
- Everybody to the dugout.
- Buttermaker.

865
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:07,774
- Yeah.
- Remember that time l played sick,

866
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:10,747
and mom went to work
and then you busted me?

867
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:12,214
- And then--
- You guys, sit down!

868
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,752
And then we went to Zuma
and went bodysurfing?

869
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:16,446
- We should do that again.
- Sit down.

870
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:18,956
- l got something to talk to you about.
- Mr. Buttermaker.

871
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,559
- Mr. Buttermaker.
- What?

872
01:00:20,762 --> 01:00:23,322
l gotta leave early today.
We're doing leather tanning in art club.

873
01:00:23,531 --> 01:00:24,656
Okay. Oh, another class.
Great. Okay.

874
01:00:26,884 --> 01:00:28,146
All right, guys, listen up.

875
01:00:29,187 --> 01:00:31,781
''To Coach Buttermaker
from league headquarters.

876
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:34,857
Regarding player safety
and league liability.

877
01:00:35,059 --> 01:00:37,425
A reminder that according
to Regulation 236,

878
01:00:37,629 --> 01:00:42,156
all players must wear a comprehensive
genital defense apparatus.''

879
01:00:42,366 --> 01:00:45,961
Now, basically, what that translates to
is that if any of you guys get hurt,

880
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:48,797
they're going to sue my ass so hard,
they're going to garnish my turds.

881
01:00:49,006 --> 01:00:50,496
So wear these things.

882
01:00:50,707 --> 01:00:52,766
Pass them down, sweetie.

883
01:00:55,579 --> 01:00:57,569
Also, you'll wanna
write your names on them,

884
01:00:57,947 --> 01:00:59,915
because that's how you get crabs.

885
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:02,311
And trust me, you don't want
to spend your Sunday afternoon

886
01:01:02,518 --> 01:01:05,009
picking through your pumpkin patch
with a little comb.

887
01:01:05,221 --> 01:01:07,781
Give me one.
Gotta protect the family jewels.

888
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:11,722
Who you kidding? When is
the last time you even saw them?

889
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,722
- Does that make any sense?
- Yeah.

890
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:19,866
Do you speak Latin?
l'm much better at Latin.

891
01:01:20,068 --> 01:01:21,729
l don't need these.

892
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,263
- Really?
- l'll take it.

893
01:01:25,273 --> 01:01:27,173
All right.

894
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:31,834
He can throw all right,
but you think he can hit?

895
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:34,571
- Let's find out.
- Here.

896
01:01:43,556 --> 01:01:45,547
ls that all you got?

897
01:01:47,593 --> 01:01:48,821
Okay.

898
01:01:49,028 --> 01:01:51,496
Got a smart-ass here. Burn it up.

899
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:53,563
Don't hold back.

900
01:02:34,037 --> 01:02:36,904
Hey, what time you get off?

901
01:02:37,107 --> 01:02:40,736
Engelberg, what kind of diet
lets you eat seven hot dogs?

902
01:02:40,944 --> 01:02:42,343
No buns.

903
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:46,106
l can have as many
as l want, dipshit.

904
01:02:47,049 --> 01:02:50,280
My dad says the only people
who put ketchup on hot dogs...

905
01:02:50,486 --> 01:02:52,716
...are mental patients...

906
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:54,718
...and Texans.

907
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:00,957
Chinese people count with beads.

908
01:03:03,998 --> 01:03:06,228
Could you please remove
your hand from my space?

909
01:03:06,434 --> 01:03:09,494
l think it is clearly defined
by the perimeter of my plate.

910
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:11,797
Hey, cut it out, poop-face!

911
01:03:12,006 --> 01:03:13,200
Poop-face?

912
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,999
Are you kidding me?

913
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,870
Elmo flips better shit than you.

914
01:03:18,078 --> 01:03:21,377
Well, perhaps you can help me
to broaden my lexicon.

915
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:25,075
Perhaps.

916
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:34,692
She don't lie, she don't lie
She don't lie

917
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,556
Cocaine

918
01:04:01,586 --> 01:04:03,349
Hey, coach.

919
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,298
Out!

920
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:18,056
Three feet!
He missed it by three feet!

921
01:05:18,258 --> 01:05:21,625
Three feet! Three feet!
Oh, you want to see spit?

922
01:05:21,828 --> 01:05:23,523
Yeah! Oh, that's nice.

923
01:05:23,729 --> 01:05:27,495
There's spit, okay?
And what are you on? l want some.

924
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:34,238
Out!

925
01:05:35,207 --> 01:05:37,698
One, two, three! Angels!

926
01:06:45,872 --> 01:06:47,339
Safe!

927
01:07:04,924 --> 01:07:06,357
Come on, get out of the way.

928
01:07:06,859 --> 01:07:08,292
Damn it!

929
01:07:08,494 --> 01:07:09,461
Let go of me!

930
01:07:09,662 --> 01:07:11,186
Watch it, asshole.

931
01:07:11,397 --> 01:07:12,887
l said watch it!

932
01:07:13,099 --> 01:07:14,497
Let go of me!

933
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:16,462
Let me tell you something--
Hey!

934
01:07:16,668 --> 01:07:19,796
Put me down! Put me down!

935
01:07:20,205 --> 01:07:22,070
Put me down! Damn it.

936
01:07:24,943 --> 01:07:27,969
- Thank you.
- God bless you, François.

937
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:32,274
Sorry l'm late, but l've been
up to my ears in rat pellets all day.

938
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:34,480
That's okay.

939
01:07:34,685 --> 01:07:35,947
Thank you for coming.

940
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,249
No sweat.

941
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:41,088
l got you something.

942
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:45,160
lnfused vinegars.

943
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:49,587
Don't ask me where l find the time,
but l made them myself.

944
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,391
Basil and tarragon,

945
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,661
red pepper and oregano.

946
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,738
Shiso

947
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,135
and rice vinegar.

948
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,742
lt's...

949
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:06,105
...great on chicken.

950
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,783
Yeah, well, l got a spastic colon,

951
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,454
but l'll give it a shot.

952
01:08:13,655 --> 01:08:17,385
Buttermaker,
you deserve a celebration.

953
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:20,389
What you have done for Toby
and those children,

954
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:22,687
it is nothing short of miraculous.

955
01:08:22,897 --> 01:08:26,196
l mean, we are one game away
from the championships.

956
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,163
lt's...

957
01:08:28,369 --> 01:08:30,735
...unbelievable. lt's...

958
01:08:30,938 --> 01:08:33,428
Congratulations. Thank you.

959
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,505
Well, the kids are great.
They really are.

960
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:38,142
So, it's, you know, kind of their deal.

961
01:08:38,344 --> 01:08:39,606
You know, l have to admit that

962
01:08:39,813 --> 01:08:42,782
while growing up,
l was never much for sports,

963
01:08:42,982 --> 01:08:44,882
or the sports-type, really.

964
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:48,077
But since l've been watching you
turn the team around,

965
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:51,688
l have been thinking a lot about you.

966
01:08:53,992 --> 01:08:56,153
l have that effect on women.

967
01:08:56,895 --> 01:08:59,295
- Really.
- Yeah.

968
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:02,895
Well, l haven't paid for sex in years.

969
01:09:04,268 --> 01:09:06,793
l think a lot of it has to do

970
01:09:07,004 --> 01:09:09,438
with getting older and...

971
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,939
...you know,
being more distinguished.

972
01:09:13,144 --> 01:09:18,446
l was thinking more along the lines
of the dangerous type.

973
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:21,446
What you hear about...

974
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:23,482
...the bad boy,

975
01:09:23,687 --> 01:09:26,281
the sexy scumbag,

976
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:29,288
the serial killer
who gets married in prison.

977
01:09:29,493 --> 01:09:33,452
l have never felt like that.

978
01:09:34,464 --> 01:09:35,896
Until l met you.

979
01:09:38,067 --> 01:09:40,535
Well, thanks.

980
01:09:53,581 --> 01:09:54,707
Mr. Buttermaker.

981
01:09:56,117 --> 01:09:57,414
What do you say, Whitewood?

982
01:09:58,887 --> 01:10:00,115
What are doing here?

983
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:07,352
Listen, kid. l...

984
01:10:07,794 --> 01:10:09,352
There's something...

985
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:14,497
...that you need to do,
and that's oil your mitt all the time.

986
01:10:14,701 --> 01:10:17,534
So l came by to check
and make sure you oil your mitt.

987
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:20,132
Really?

988
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,399
Oh, yeah, l'm always watching.

989
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:25,336
Okay, l'll go get it.

990
01:10:25,545 --> 01:10:27,911
- Be right back.
- Good deal.

991
01:10:33,252 --> 01:10:34,719
Look at you.

992
01:10:34,921 --> 01:10:35,888
Gorgeous.

993
01:10:36,088 --> 01:10:38,487
- Gorgeous.
- l don't know, it's a little--

994
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:40,248
Looking good.

995
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:44,160
- Hey.
- What, you joined the circus?

996
01:10:44,362 --> 01:10:46,296
- Tanner!
- Where's the toilet?

997
01:10:46,498 --> 01:10:47,795
l gotta pinch a mean one.

998
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:49,660
Engelberg! These are my friends!

999
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:53,668
lt all right, sweetie. l got a little
butterball just like him at home.

1000
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:56,499
Down the hall
and to the left, fatty.

1001
01:10:57,408 --> 01:10:59,273
What are you jerk-offs doing here?

1002
01:10:59,476 --> 01:11:00,807
The Giants beat the White Sox.

1003
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:03,445
lf we beat the Giants,
we're in the championship.

1004
01:11:03,647 --> 01:11:06,081
- Really?
- Yeah, we're celebrating.

1005
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:09,116
So take off the hooker suit,
let's go.

1006
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,650
Come on.

1007
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:13,322
l don't have to tell you
who we play for the pennant

1008
01:11:13,523 --> 01:11:15,423
when we blow past
these Giants today.

1009
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:17,490
Right now, we're the hottest team
in the league.

1010
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:18,956
What does that mean
for the Giants?

1011
01:11:19,162 --> 01:11:21,460
Bad news for the Giants!

1012
01:11:21,864 --> 01:11:24,697
- Here we go. One, two, three!
- Break!

1013
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:26,697
Hey, Kelly, hang on.

1014
01:11:26,902 --> 01:11:29,393
Listen, l want you to be like
a vacuum cleaner out there today.

1015
01:11:29,605 --> 01:11:31,334
Anything even close to you,
you suck it up.

1016
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,235
These boys are weak.
l don't want to blow it.

1017
01:11:33,442 --> 01:11:36,343
We're knocking on the door,
understand? Come on, let's go!

1018
01:11:36,545 --> 01:11:38,513
All right, guys, let's go.

1019
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:49,186
Way to go, Kelly!
Way to go, buddy!

1020
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:51,984
Way to hustle. Way to hustle.

1021
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:57,729
Strike three!

1022
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:09,606
l got it! l got it!

1023
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,477
Hey, l told you l got it.

1024
01:12:16,682 --> 01:12:19,981
Yeah, sorry.

1025
01:12:20,185 --> 01:12:22,551
Way to go! Tanner.

1026
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,154
Good job, buddy. Good job.

1027
01:12:24,356 --> 01:12:25,721
l ain't doing it no more.

1028
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:29,859
Hey, hey, hey. Now's not the time
to punk out, okay? Understand me?

1029
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:32,791
You do what l told you, you hear me?
Do what l told you.

1030
01:12:32,997 --> 01:12:35,727
You are not going to screw this up
for me. Understand?

1031
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:37,332
Understand?

1032
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:39,435
Go get your bat. You're up.

1033
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:41,730
Otherwise, why are you here?

1034
01:12:43,374 --> 01:12:47,139
Leading off for the Bears,
Kelly Leak.

1035
01:12:54,818 --> 01:12:56,911
Strike one!

1036
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,678
Come on, Kelly!

1037
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:04,152
- Strike two!
- He could have hit that.

1038
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:06,294
Time! Time-out.

1039
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:08,060
Time!

1040
01:13:08,264 --> 01:13:09,492
Kelly, come here.

1041
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:11,166
Come here.

1042
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:13,528
Come here. What, are you playing
mind games with me now?

1043
01:13:13,736 --> 01:13:15,363
We're that close
to the championship.

1044
01:13:15,571 --> 01:13:17,629
You got daddy issues or something?
Hit the goddamn ball.

1045
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:19,704
Now get in there. Come on.

1046
01:13:34,855 --> 01:13:36,413
Yeah!

1047
01:13:40,928 --> 01:13:44,056
lt's a home run for Kelly Leak.

1048
01:13:44,264 --> 01:13:46,357
The Bears win 2-1.

1049
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:50,732
The Bears advance to the finals
this Saturday against the Yankees.

1050
01:14:01,347 --> 01:14:04,645
Way to go, Kelly!
We're going to the championship!

1051
01:14:15,861 --> 01:14:17,488
See you there.

1052
01:14:21,632 --> 01:14:22,860
lt's cold.

1053
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:26,093
lt's supposed to be cold.
Just keep your arm in it.

1054
01:14:27,438 --> 01:14:30,737
Hey, Buttermaker,
Mom's gonna be here tomorrow.

1055
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:31,999
Perfect.

1056
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:33,938
You know, l was thinking,
maybe afterwards,

1057
01:14:34,145 --> 01:14:37,602
we can go to Tony Roma's
for the Carolina Honeys, right?

1058
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:39,679
Right.

1059
01:14:39,883 --> 01:14:43,250
Like l'm gonna take you little shits
to a fancy place like Tony Roma's.

1060
01:14:43,453 --> 01:14:47,150
- Do you think l'm made out of money?
- Fine. Just us, then.

1061
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:51,448
Amanda, you really...

1062
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,719
You got to quit trying
to make me daddy, because--

1063
01:14:53,929 --> 01:14:55,328
l didn't say that.

1064
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:56,896
Just friends.

1065
01:14:57,099 --> 01:14:58,862
You know, we can hang out.

1066
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:00,625
We can go to Zuma.

1067
01:15:01,437 --> 01:15:03,564
Go bodysurfing.

1068
01:15:03,906 --> 01:15:05,703
Why are you talking about
bodysurfing?

1069
01:15:05,908 --> 01:15:08,307
Remember when l played sick,
and we went to Zuma?

1070
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,875
Don't you remember?

1071
01:15:11,446 --> 01:15:13,380
No, l don't remember that.

1072
01:15:13,581 --> 01:15:15,913
l don't know
what you're talking about.

1073
01:15:16,818 --> 01:15:20,811
But, you know, l was always drunk
in those days, so l forgot a lot of shit.

1074
01:15:21,656 --> 01:15:23,316
Look, the fact of the matter is...

1075
01:15:26,259 --> 01:15:28,454
You don't have any business
hanging out with me.

1076
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:32,257
- l'm a damn loser, and you know it.
- No, you're not. Not to me.

1077
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:34,696
Come on, Amanda.

1078
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:36,300
l'm a drunk.

1079
01:15:36,503 --> 01:15:37,935
You said it yourself.

1080
01:15:38,137 --> 01:15:41,937
l make a living killing rats
to pay rent on a trailer.

1081
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,740
ln Sun Valley.

1082
01:15:46,078 --> 01:15:48,137
l'm a washout.

1083
01:15:50,816 --> 01:15:53,046
- Come on, Buttermaker--
- Just stop it!

1084
01:15:54,619 --> 01:15:56,519
Don't you think if l wanted
to play house with you,

1085
01:15:56,721 --> 01:15:59,622
l might have called you sometime in
the last three years? But l didn't, did l?

1086
01:15:59,824 --> 01:16:01,553
- You know what--?
- Just stop it!

1087
01:16:01,759 --> 01:16:04,728
You're here for one reason, and that
reason is sitting in that ice right now.

1088
01:16:04,929 --> 01:16:07,397
Just leave it at that, will you?

1089
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:10,326
l know why l'm here.

1090
01:16:12,536 --> 01:16:14,902
Just felt sorry for you, that's all.

1091
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:51,367
l'm just saying,
keep your glove oiled.

1092
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:54,872
l mean, he came over
to check mine.

1093
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:56,770
- Really?
- Yeah.

1094
01:16:57,545 --> 01:16:59,672
- Hey.
- Don't talk to me.

1095
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,905
l'm only here for them.

1096
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:09,179
Toby.

1097
01:17:11,425 --> 01:17:14,257
- Yo, what the hell?
- What?

1098
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,190
- Something wrong?
- You would know, dickweed.

1099
01:17:17,397 --> 01:17:20,264
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

1100
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:23,633
Hey, what's up with you guys?

1101
01:17:23,836 --> 01:17:25,235
- He's a ball-hog!
- Yeah?

1102
01:17:25,438 --> 01:17:27,702
Well, that ball-hog
won your last game.

1103
01:17:27,906 --> 01:17:29,601
So calm your ass down.

1104
01:17:29,808 --> 01:17:33,244
- Stay out of it, Engelberg!
- Speak for yourself, shorty.

1105
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:34,639
Taking sides, Slim-Fast?

1106
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:35,938
You got a problem, Tanner?

1107
01:17:36,148 --> 01:17:39,515
No, you do. lt's called me
putting a foot up your ass.

1108
01:17:39,718 --> 01:17:41,879
Guys, come on!

1109
01:17:44,021 --> 01:17:46,182
- Break it up!
- Hey!

1110
01:17:47,124 --> 01:17:48,091
Hey!

1111
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:50,351
- Break it up!
- Break it up!

1112
01:17:50,561 --> 01:17:51,687
Come on, come on, come on.

1113
01:17:51,896 --> 01:17:53,693
Get up, get up.

1114
01:17:53,898 --> 01:17:55,559
Get up!

1115
01:17:55,766 --> 01:17:57,358
Now, stand still and listen to me.

1116
01:17:57,568 --> 01:18:00,058
l said stop it. Okay?

1117
01:18:02,739 --> 01:18:03,865
Now, what the hell is going on?

1118
01:18:04,074 --> 01:18:05,632
He's a dick.
He thinks he's better than us.

1119
01:18:05,842 --> 01:18:07,673
- Who?
- Him.

1120
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:10,907
He is. How do you think
we got this far?

1121
01:18:11,114 --> 01:18:13,082
Wasn't your playing,
that's for sure.

1122
01:18:13,283 --> 01:18:14,682
l don't need this crap, l'm out.

1123
01:18:14,884 --> 01:18:15,907
- Come here.
- No, stop.

1124
01:18:16,118 --> 01:18:19,713
You stand still. Stop it! Stop it!

1125
01:18:19,922 --> 01:18:21,389
l said stop it!

1126
01:18:25,661 --> 01:18:27,253
Now, l told him to cover for you.

1127
01:18:27,463 --> 01:18:29,863
So if you're going to yell at somebody,
you yell at me, okay?

1128
01:18:30,065 --> 01:18:32,430
- You did?
- Yeah, l did.

1129
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:34,192
You wanna win, right?

1130
01:18:34,402 --> 01:18:35,869
lsn't that what you guys
wanna do, win?

1131
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,037
Now, quit acting like a bunch
of damn babies.

1132
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:43,638
Because we got a chance.

1133
01:18:45,613 --> 01:18:47,705
Pick your gloves up.

1134
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:49,939
We got a championship to win.

1135
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:53,016
The entire season

1136
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,211
and everything we've worked for
comes down

1137
01:18:55,422 --> 01:18:57,549
to the next six innings
that you play.

1138
01:18:58,558 --> 01:19:01,891
How you do,
and the result of that effort,

1139
01:19:02,095 --> 01:19:03,925
is gonna have a big bearing

1140
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:07,395
on how you feel about yourself
in the next year.

1141
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,297
You gonna go through the world
seeing yourself as a winner...

1142
01:19:11,971 --> 01:19:13,836
...or a loser?

1143
01:19:14,674 --> 01:19:17,938
Because believe me,
being a winner is just...

1144
01:19:18,143 --> 01:19:20,771
ls just--
l don't know, is just better.

1145
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,271
The way l see it, that trophy up there
has got your name on it.

1146
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:28,578
And those guys over there
are trying to steal it from you.

1147
01:19:28,787 --> 01:19:31,221
- Whose trophy is it, Danny?
- Ours, coach.

1148
01:19:32,657 --> 01:19:34,920
Whose name is on that trophy,
Sanchez?

1149
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,092
Yankees?

1150
01:19:36,293 --> 01:19:37,954
Take a good long look
at your opponents.

1151
01:19:38,162 --> 01:19:40,630
Do they look like champions?

1152
01:19:41,398 --> 01:19:43,525
Not for me to say.

1153
01:19:44,868 --> 01:19:46,165
But no, they don't.

1154
01:19:47,171 --> 01:19:48,638
You're a great team,

1155
01:19:48,839 --> 01:19:51,705
it's been a great season,
but it's not over yet.

1156
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:54,908
Let's go finish it, huh?
One, two, three!

1157
01:19:55,111 --> 01:19:56,908
Yankees!

1158
01:19:58,047 --> 01:19:59,241
All right, let's go, guys.

1159
01:19:59,449 --> 01:20:00,780
One, two, three!

1160
01:20:00,983 --> 01:20:02,814
Bears!

1161
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:06,415
Hustle up, guys. Let's go get them.

1162
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:18,661
B-E-A-R-S! Go, Bears! Go, Bears!

1163
01:20:19,901 --> 01:20:21,162
Go, Toby!

1164
01:20:21,368 --> 01:20:26,032
Now batting for the Yankees,
number 1 0, Jimmy Wilkins.

1165
01:20:28,642 --> 01:20:30,109
Strike one!

1166
01:20:30,311 --> 01:20:32,006
All right! All right, Amanda!

1167
01:20:32,546 --> 01:20:34,207
Way to go, honey.

1168
01:20:42,055 --> 01:20:43,545
- Safe!
- Way to go, Jimmy! .

1169
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:44,849
Good hustle.

1170
01:20:45,225 --> 01:20:47,955
That's pretty good, guys.
Did you see that? Damn near got him.

1171
01:20:48,161 --> 01:20:50,220
Way to get down the line.

1172
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:53,627
lf it wasn't for Kelly and that chick,
you guys wouldn't even be here.

1173
01:20:53,832 --> 01:20:56,392
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

1174
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,799
- None of you can play worth shit.
- Oh, yeah?

1175
01:21:00,005 --> 01:21:03,668
Yeah. What are you going
to do about it, Oreo?

1176
01:21:03,876 --> 01:21:07,812
Now batting, number 9,
Joey Bullock.

1177
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:12,410
There it is!

1178
01:21:13,684 --> 01:21:14,651
Let's go, let's go!

1179
01:21:14,852 --> 01:21:16,513
Take third! Take third!

1180
01:21:20,725 --> 01:21:22,454
Safe!

1181
01:21:30,801 --> 01:21:34,202
Amanda,
your training bra's too tight!

1182
01:21:37,574 --> 01:21:39,734
Strike three!

1183
01:21:40,276 --> 01:21:45,009
We got one, we got two,
pitch this one out! Easy out.

1184
01:21:54,023 --> 01:21:56,149
- Ball.
- Go, go, go!

1185
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,086
Safe!

1186
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:02,422
You okay? Come on, get up.

1187
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:03,597
Come on.

1188
01:22:03,798 --> 01:22:05,425
All right!

1189
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:10,632
- You okay, sweetie?
- Here's what l'm gonna do, cracker.

1190
01:22:13,907 --> 01:22:15,807
Hey, get back in the dugout.
Hey!

1191
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:24,816
- Break it up!
- Break it up, guys. Come on!

1192
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:28,286
See you, Mr. Shitty!

1193
01:22:33,626 --> 01:22:35,184
Damn right, loser!

1194
01:22:35,394 --> 01:22:36,520
- Get off him!
- Get off of me!

1195
01:22:36,729 --> 01:22:40,187
- Get behind the plate. Come on.
- Get back. Get back.

1196
01:22:41,968 --> 01:22:43,764
Back on the field!

1197
01:22:45,871 --> 01:22:48,237
- Get out there!
- You guys are a bunch of punks.

1198
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,805
ls this what you teach them?

1199
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:52,135
You bowl over little girls like that?
ls that what you do?

1200
01:22:52,344 --> 01:22:54,244
lt's called baseball,
or maybe you forgot.

1201
01:22:54,446 --> 01:22:56,914
Don't talk about fair play
when your kids are throwing punches.

1202
01:22:57,115 --> 01:22:59,582
lt's horseshit baseball, and you know it!
So you watch them, okay?

1203
01:22:59,783 --> 01:23:02,513
You ought to take a good look
at yourself, you has-been.

1204
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,746
Traded it all in for booze and broads,
you're disgusting.

1205
01:23:05,956 --> 01:23:07,480
- What did you say?
- You can't hear me?

1206
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,682
Say it again! Say it again!

1207
01:23:10,561 --> 01:23:12,051
Get back to your dugout,
you crybaby!

1208
01:23:12,263 --> 01:23:13,958
Listen to you, crybaby.

1209
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:16,461
- Get to your drug-out, you...
- Buttermaker, dugout!

1210
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:18,531
Sorry, chief. Sorry.

1211
01:23:18,735 --> 01:23:20,896
You want to play ball, Grape-Nuts?
Let's play!

1212
01:23:21,104 --> 01:23:22,503
All right?

1213
01:23:22,705 --> 01:23:24,138
Piece of shit.

1214
01:23:24,574 --> 01:23:27,668
- Play ball!
- Cream it, Whitewood!

1215
01:23:28,144 --> 01:23:29,338
Come on, Whitewood.

1216
01:23:29,746 --> 01:23:31,610
Come on, buddy. Get a piece of it.

1217
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:40,445
Come on, Joe.

1218
01:23:40,822 --> 01:23:42,619
You're better than that, son.

1219
01:23:42,824 --> 01:23:45,587
- Good job, Toby.
- Thanks.

1220
01:23:45,793 --> 01:23:46,987
l would've tagged you out,

1221
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:50,220
but l was afraid your mom
would've sued the ball.

1222
01:23:50,431 --> 01:23:52,422
Let's go, Abdul. Let's go, buddy.

1223
01:23:52,633 --> 01:23:53,622
Keep it going.

1224
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:55,563
Ahmad-- ls it Abdul or Ahmad?

1225
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:57,203
- Ahmad.
- Whatever it is.

1226
01:23:57,405 --> 01:24:00,465
Ahmad, let's keep it going, buddy!
Way to go!

1227
01:24:08,014 --> 01:24:08,981
Joey!

1228
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:11,384
Hey, that was your play!
That was your play.

1229
01:24:11,584 --> 01:24:14,883
Get your ass over there.
Pull your head out, son.

1230
01:24:15,355 --> 01:24:17,117
Hey, Garo, come here.

1231
01:24:17,723 --> 01:24:20,385
Listen, you hit lefty, so he's gonna
pitch you in tight, all right?

1232
01:24:20,592 --> 01:24:22,321
So l want you to lean into it
and take the hit.

1233
01:24:22,528 --> 01:24:23,586
l can't.

1234
01:24:23,796 --> 01:24:26,629
See, here's the thing. lf you get on,
we're loaded, and Kelly is up next.

1235
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:29,392
- Now, come on. Let's do it.
- l just want to hit the ball.

1236
01:24:29,601 --> 01:24:31,535
Well, sometimes it's better
if the ball hits you.

1237
01:24:31,737 --> 01:24:34,227
lt's called taking one for the team.
Now, let's go. Come on, Garo!

1238
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:35,701
Let's go, buddy!

1239
01:24:35,907 --> 01:24:36,965
Be alert, guys!

1240
01:24:37,175 --> 01:24:38,802
Now batting from the left side
of the plate,

1241
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,877
number 1 0, Garo Daragebrigadian.

1242
01:24:50,787 --> 01:24:52,345
Ball! Take your base.

1243
01:24:52,556 --> 01:24:55,354
That's the way, buddy! That's what
l'm talking about, right there.

1244
01:24:55,559 --> 01:24:58,585
That's what l'm talking about.
Way to take it, buddy.

1245
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:02,559
Next batter for the Bears,

1246
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:04,528
- number 5, Kelly Leak.
- Come on, Kelly!

1247
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:06,192
Kick some ass!

1248
01:25:09,972 --> 01:25:11,030
Hey, Buttocks!

1249
01:25:12,842 --> 01:25:15,834
- Watch this.
- Yeah.

1250
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:40,162
What are you guys doing?

1251
01:25:45,572 --> 01:25:48,336
- Strike two!
- That's okay, Joey.

1252
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:52,068
lt's all right. Focus.
Just relax. Relax!

1253
01:25:52,278 --> 01:25:54,143
Your old man help you pee too?

1254
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,113
''Shake it a little more, Joey.

1255
01:25:56,315 --> 01:25:59,079
Don't want to get any stains
on your underwear.''

1256
01:25:59,285 --> 01:26:00,582
Keep talking, fatty.

1257
01:26:00,787 --> 01:26:02,186
Whatever.

1258
01:26:05,658 --> 01:26:06,818
God!

1259
01:26:07,026 --> 01:26:08,390
See you later, Joey.

1260
01:26:08,593 --> 01:26:10,288
Have a nice time on the bench.

1261
01:26:10,495 --> 01:26:13,020
Now batting, number 3.

1262
01:26:18,904 --> 01:26:20,462
Go, baby! Go, baby! Go, baby!

1263
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,799
Watch it, watch it. Go! Yes!

1264
01:26:23,007 --> 01:26:24,975
Yes! Yes!

1265
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:27,671
Get out there!
That's how you do it!

1266
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,711
Hey, Buttermaker!

1267
01:26:39,022 --> 01:26:40,512
Time!

1268
01:26:42,358 --> 01:26:43,552
What the hell is wrong with you?

1269
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,853
Why don't you
just put a bow on it, huh?

1270
01:26:46,062 --> 01:26:47,996
lt's my arm. lt's killing me.

1271
01:26:48,198 --> 01:26:49,495
Don't wanna hear it.
Want Toby in?

1272
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:51,291
- No, l don't.
- Yeah, you want to win?

1273
01:26:51,501 --> 01:26:52,729
- Yeah, l do.
- Yeah?

1274
01:26:52,936 --> 01:26:54,233
- Yeah.
- Then get it together.

1275
01:26:54,436 --> 01:26:56,165
Number 1 2, Mike Van Horn.

1276
01:27:01,877 --> 01:27:02,901
Safe!

1277
01:27:03,312 --> 01:27:04,973
Good hustle, Van Horn!
Way to beat it out!

1278
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:09,310
What in the hell are you doing?
This is not T-ball!

1279
01:27:09,518 --> 01:27:12,418
You guys watching that?
Let's go, let's go. Good job.

1280
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:13,587
Jesus Christ.

1281
01:27:13,788 --> 01:27:17,246
Number 1 4,
left fielder, Jeff Wong.

1282
01:27:24,632 --> 01:27:26,394
Fair ball!

1283
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:32,839
Safe!

1284
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:35,337
Wait. Whoa.
Hey, hey, hey ump.

1285
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:37,567
What are you talking about?
He got it.

1286
01:27:37,777 --> 01:27:39,642
The throw was here on time.
That was stupid!

1287
01:27:39,846 --> 01:27:41,006
What, are you Helen Keller?

1288
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,441
He was under the tag, coach.

1289
01:27:42,648 --> 01:27:44,912
Butterballs, stay in your dugout!

1290
01:27:45,117 --> 01:27:47,551
Keep your eyes peeled, man.
lt's your job.

1291
01:27:47,753 --> 01:27:51,689
Stop embarrassing yourself,
crybaby.

1292
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:53,688
lt's a good call, ump. Very good call.

1293
01:27:56,695 --> 01:27:57,888
Garo, that was perfect last time.

1294
01:27:58,096 --> 01:28:00,564
Do the same thing. Lean in,
just get on base. Kelly's up next.

1295
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:02,926
Why can't l just hit the ball
like everyone else?

1296
01:28:03,134 --> 01:28:04,761
Because that's selfish.
Think about the team.

1297
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:07,164
l know it stings a little,
but it'll be worth it. Come on.

1298
01:28:07,372 --> 01:28:08,703
Next up for the Bears...

1299
01:28:08,907 --> 01:28:10,898
- Let's go Garo!
- ... Garo Daragebrigadian.

1300
01:28:11,276 --> 01:28:13,039
Let's go, buddy.

1301
01:28:25,789 --> 01:28:27,279
You got this guy, Joey!

1302
01:28:32,128 --> 01:28:36,155
- Out.
- What in hell are you doing out there?

1303
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:37,798
Get in here!

1304
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,264
Ump, time! Time.

1305
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:42,197
What the hell
is the matter with you, kid?

1306
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:45,066
What's the matter with all of you?

1307
01:28:45,273 --> 01:28:46,763
''My arm hurts.''

1308
01:28:46,975 --> 01:28:49,637
''Why can't l hit away
like the other kids?''

1309
01:28:50,345 --> 01:28:53,405
Do you remember what it was like?
The first game, they laughed at us.

1310
01:28:53,615 --> 01:28:55,242
Now we got their backs
up against the wall,

1311
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:58,749
they're scared of us, and you want
to give up. ls that the deal?

1312
01:28:58,954 --> 01:29:01,478
l thought you wanted to win.
l thought you wanted to be champions.

1313
01:29:01,689 --> 01:29:03,554
Well, do you?

1314
01:29:03,757 --> 01:29:05,315
Do you?!

1315
01:29:18,905 --> 01:29:20,372
Look...

1316
01:29:23,543 --> 01:29:26,341
You're up next, Kelly.
Come on, let's go.

1317
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:29,075
Let's play ball.

1318
01:29:29,282 --> 01:29:31,307
Now batting, number 5,
Kelly Leak.

1319
01:29:31,517 --> 01:29:32,676
Go, Joey.

1320
01:29:52,837 --> 01:29:54,202
Catcher, Mike Engelberg.

1321
01:29:54,405 --> 01:29:56,396
Hi, Joey.

1322
01:29:58,542 --> 01:29:59,702
Kiss my ass.

1323
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,739
Time.

1324
01:30:04,214 --> 01:30:06,546
Here comes daddy.

1325
01:30:13,089 --> 01:30:14,852
How you doing?

1326
01:30:15,058 --> 01:30:16,355
- Fine.
- All right.

1327
01:30:16,559 --> 01:30:18,891
The way this guy is hitting,
and the way you're pitching today,

1328
01:30:19,094 --> 01:30:20,391
l think maybe we ought to walk him.

1329
01:30:20,596 --> 01:30:22,860
Next batter's an easy out.

1330
01:30:23,065 --> 01:30:24,225
But l can take him.

1331
01:30:24,433 --> 01:30:26,230
l know you can.

1332
01:30:26,435 --> 01:30:27,925
- Come on, Dad.
- Hey.

1333
01:30:28,437 --> 01:30:30,837
Do as you're told. Come on.

1334
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,769
Let's get them. Let's go!

1335
01:30:47,021 --> 01:30:49,649
Hey, hey!
What was that?

1336
01:30:49,857 --> 01:30:51,653
You tried to hit him.

1337
01:30:51,992 --> 01:30:54,222
- Did you try to hit him?
- No, it just got away from me.

1338
01:30:54,428 --> 01:30:56,521
That's bullshit, Joey!

1339
01:30:57,431 --> 01:30:59,763
Don't you ever throw at a batter!
Never ever throw at a batter!

1340
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:03,561
You understand me?
You never do that! Never do that.

1341
01:31:05,238 --> 01:31:06,295
Get up.

1342
01:31:07,907 --> 01:31:09,636
You could have hurt him.

1343
01:31:40,938 --> 01:31:42,200
- Shari--
- You son of a bitch.

1344
01:31:42,406 --> 01:31:45,034
He could have hurt him.
Don't overreact.

1345
01:31:45,242 --> 01:31:47,176
l'm taking him home. Now.

1346
01:31:47,378 --> 01:31:49,005
Are you kidding?
lt's the middle of the game.

1347
01:31:49,213 --> 01:31:52,182
He finishes the game. After that,
you can take him wherever you want.

1348
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:55,644
Don't do the arm cross.

1349
01:31:55,852 --> 01:31:57,444
Do not do the arm cross.

1350
01:32:00,957 --> 01:32:02,424
Hey, Engelberg...

1351
01:32:16,738 --> 01:32:18,365
Yes, go.

1352
01:32:25,045 --> 01:32:28,173
Engelberg! Engelberg! Engelberg!

1353
01:33:06,919 --> 01:33:08,944
Justin...

1354
01:33:09,154 --> 01:33:10,416
...you're on the mound.

1355
01:33:12,957 --> 01:33:14,925
Strike two!

1356
01:33:19,931 --> 01:33:21,660
Strike three!

1357
01:33:32,375 --> 01:33:34,536
Okay, Jose, you and Tanner
sit this one out.

1358
01:33:34,744 --> 01:33:37,679
- What?
- What the hell?

1359
01:33:37,881 --> 01:33:39,974
Lupus, you go to second base.

1360
01:33:40,183 --> 01:33:43,414
Hooper go to right field. Prem--
Where's Prem? Go to the left.

1361
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:44,950
Are you sure?

1362
01:33:45,154 --> 01:33:46,712
- Yeah, l'm sure.
- What?

1363
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:50,748
- You heard me. Right field.
- Are you crazy?

1364
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,053
l can't go out there,
l'm in a wheelchair.

1365
01:33:53,896 --> 01:33:56,558
- l thought you wanted to play baseball.
- Hell, no.

1366
01:33:56,765 --> 01:33:59,165
Why the hell would
l want to play baseball?

1367
01:33:59,368 --> 01:34:01,301
l'm a damn paraplegic.

1368
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:07,066
So you just wanna sit here and
get splinters in your ass all season?

1369
01:34:07,275 --> 01:34:08,537
ls that what you want?

1370
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,079
lf you won't play ball,
why are you here?

1371
01:34:14,382 --> 01:34:17,373
Last time l checked,
this is a baseball team.

1372
01:34:18,585 --> 01:34:20,610
And you're all on the team.

1373
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:22,654
Every one of you.

1374
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:24,654
So do what l said.

1375
01:34:24,858 --> 01:34:27,793
You guys go out there
and play baseball, okay?

1376
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,326
Whurlitzer, where are you going?

1377
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:31,562
To finish the game.

1378
01:34:31,964 --> 01:34:34,330
- Not with that arm, honey.
- What?

1379
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,826
You go and put it on ice.
Come on, sit down.

1380
01:34:38,237 --> 01:34:39,465
Toby, hit the mound.

1381
01:34:39,672 --> 01:34:42,232
- Really?
- Yeah, hit the mound.

1382
01:34:42,441 --> 01:34:44,068
You'll be all right.

1383
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:46,137
l know you're not good
at listening to me,

1384
01:34:46,345 --> 01:34:49,541
but for a change, just sit here
and enjoy the game with me, all right?

1385
01:34:49,748 --> 01:34:53,275
And try to forgive an old drunk
for being an asshole.

1386
01:34:53,485 --> 01:34:57,387
All right, guys. Let's show the Yankees
what bad news is all about.

1387
01:34:59,591 --> 01:35:01,388
Look at Hooper.

1388
01:35:03,794 --> 01:35:06,319
l bet it's just blowing their minds.

1389
01:35:08,566 --> 01:35:11,399
You pitched a great game, honey.
Come here.

1390
01:35:14,805 --> 01:35:17,968
And Hooper, the kid in the wheelchair,
he goes to right for Whitewood.

1391
01:35:18,174 --> 01:35:20,108
What does that do
to your batting order?

1392
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:23,575
Well, one goes to four,
four goes to five, two goes to three,

1393
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:28,240
three goes to two, six goes to one,
and seven, eight, nine are cool.

1394
01:35:28,451 --> 01:35:30,009
l guess you know what you're doing.

1395
01:35:30,219 --> 01:35:31,982
Yeah, l do.

1396
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,270
Batting practice.

1397
01:36:01,849 --> 01:36:04,943
All right, let's keep
the rally going, guys. Come on.

1398
01:36:05,152 --> 01:36:07,745
Hey, Toby, you need
to scoot up a little bit?

1399
01:36:07,954 --> 01:36:11,082
Batting for the Yankees,
Danny Patello.

1400
01:36:29,041 --> 01:36:30,008
You're out!

1401
01:36:41,452 --> 01:36:44,216
Here we go, Ritchie! Keep it going.

1402
01:36:55,065 --> 01:36:56,191
You're out!

1403
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,265
Yes, sir. Way to go, Kelly!

1404
01:36:58,468 --> 01:37:00,595
Good throw, buddy. Good throw.

1405
01:37:00,804 --> 01:37:02,931
Two out. We need one more out, guys.
Come on.

1406
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,437
One more out! Come on!

1407
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:07,667
Next for the Yankees,
Mike Van Horn.

1408
01:37:07,878 --> 01:37:09,310
Come on, kill it!

1409
01:37:38,006 --> 01:37:39,836
Did you see that? Unbelievable.

1410
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,132
Way to go, Hooper!

1411
01:37:44,311 --> 01:37:45,938
The little crippled boy did it!

1412
01:37:46,146 --> 01:37:48,979
And at the bottom of the sixth,
Yankees lead 8 to 5.

1413
01:37:52,986 --> 01:37:55,954
Pretty impressive, guys.
Way to go, Lupus. Way to go, man.

1414
01:37:56,155 --> 01:37:57,713
That's a hero right there.

1415
01:37:57,924 --> 01:37:58,948
All right.

1416
01:37:59,158 --> 01:38:00,921
- Hooper! Come on, man.
- Yeah, Hooper!

1417
01:38:01,127 --> 01:38:02,992
Get in here.
Put that thing in fourth gear.

1418
01:38:03,196 --> 01:38:04,629
- Good going, man.
- Great catch.

1419
01:38:04,831 --> 01:38:06,526
- Nice catch.
- All right, Hooper.

1420
01:38:06,733 --> 01:38:09,361
Hey, guys,
four more runs,

1421
01:38:09,569 --> 01:38:10,900
we win the game.

1422
01:38:11,104 --> 01:38:12,434
How about that?

1423
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,605
Prem. Where's Prem?
You're up, buddy.

1424
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:16,671
l have to remind you,
Mr. Buttermaker,

1425
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:19,036
that my batting average
is well below the norm.

1426
01:38:19,511 --> 01:38:20,637
And what's that?

1427
01:38:20,846 --> 01:38:22,336
Zero for a lifetime.

1428
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:26,082
Well, you're due one, man.

1429
01:38:26,284 --> 01:38:28,342
So get out there.

1430
01:38:28,753 --> 01:38:31,153
- Really?
- Absolutely, buddy.

1431
01:38:31,722 --> 01:38:35,214
- Let's go, guys. All right.
- Buttermaker, come here.

1432
01:38:35,426 --> 01:38:36,791
Excellent.

1433
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,560
This should be fun.

1434
01:38:38,763 --> 01:38:40,287
Listen, l'm a little busy right now.

1435
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:42,829
What the hell are you doing?
We had the lead,

1436
01:38:43,032 --> 01:38:45,000
and now you're putting wheelchairs
in the outfield?

1437
01:38:45,201 --> 01:38:47,761
l mean, you're letting Toby pitch?
What are you thinking?

1438
01:38:47,971 --> 01:38:49,165
You know, he's your son.

1439
01:38:49,372 --> 01:38:51,272
Yes, and he wants to win
just like everyone else.

1440
01:38:51,474 --> 01:38:54,341
Really? How would you know
what he wants?

1441
01:38:54,544 --> 01:38:57,069
When do you see him,
between basket weaving and ballet?

1442
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,645
You have some goddamn nerve.

1443
01:38:59,848 --> 01:39:02,180
Are you actually telling me
how to raise my child?

1444
01:39:02,384 --> 01:39:04,318
No, l'm not telling you
how to raise your child.

1445
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:08,479
But maybe somebody should.
l got a game to coach.

1446
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:11,022
Leading off for the Bears,
number 1 9, Prem Lahiri.

1447
01:39:11,226 --> 01:39:12,488
Let's go, Prem.

1448
01:39:12,694 --> 01:39:15,628
Let's go. Keep your eye on it.

1449
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:22,827
l'll be damned. Way to go!
Way to go, Prem. Way to go!

1450
01:39:23,037 --> 01:39:25,062
- Safe!
- Did you see that?

1451
01:39:25,273 --> 01:39:26,365
Way to go, buddy! Way to go!

1452
01:39:26,574 --> 01:39:29,805
Now batting, number 4,
Timmy Lupus.

1453
01:39:42,789 --> 01:39:44,780
- Strike one!
- Come on, Lupus.

1454
01:39:52,131 --> 01:39:53,894
- Strike two!
- Come on, Lupus!

1455
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:57,100
lf you want to hit the ball,
you gotta swing the bat!

1456
01:40:09,914 --> 01:40:11,643
Look at that! Lupus hit the ball!

1457
01:40:17,988 --> 01:40:18,977
Run! Run!

01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:20,747

1459
01:40:20,958 --> 01:40:23,290

1460
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,093
- Safe!

1461
01:40:32,769 --> 01:40:34,099
Lupus!

1462
01:40:34,303 --> 01:40:37,329
Lupus! Lupus!

1463
01:40:38,374 --> 01:40:41,537
All right, guys. Hey, Miguel.
Miguel, you know what to do.

1464
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,678
Next up, number 1 4, Miguel Agilar.

1465
01:40:44,714 --> 01:40:46,306
Let's go, guys!

1466
01:40:56,524 --> 01:40:57,752
You're out!

01:40:57,959 --> 01:40:59,790
Dadgum it!

1468
01:41:00,195 --> 01:41:03,961
lt's okay, Prem. lt's all right, buddy.
Way to hustle. Way to hustle.

1469
01:41:04,165 --> 01:41:05,927
Good hit, Miguel.

1470
01:41:07,735 --> 01:41:09,362
Lucky hit.

1471
01:41:12,539 --> 01:41:15,064
Sorry, Paco, no habla.

1472
01:41:15,776 --> 01:41:20,008
lt means you're a bag of douche,
shithead.

1473
01:41:20,213 --> 01:41:22,579
All right, Kelly, let's tie the game,
buddy. Let's go. Come on.

1474
01:41:22,782 --> 01:41:24,477
Now batting number 5, Kelly Leak.

1475
01:41:24,684 --> 01:41:26,845
Let's go, buddy. Let's go. Let's go.

Ball one!

1478
01:41:48,907 --> 01:41:50,272

01:41:56,681 --> 01:41:58,410
Kelly.

1482
01:42:26,942 --> 01:42:28,034
Two outs. Come on, one more.

1483
01:42:29,678 --> 01:42:32,203
Hey, Garo. Garo, come here.

1484
01:42:34,016 --> 01:42:36,075
Hit the ball, buddy.

Come on, Garo!

1487
01:42:43,558 --> 01:42:45,685

You're out!

We won!

1500
01:44:15,977 --> 01:44:17,410
lt was a hell of a hit, son.

1501
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:20,479
l'm proud of you, man.
l'm really proud of you.

1502
01:44:20,682 --> 01:44:22,673
Hey, who wants a beer?

1503
01:44:28,457 --> 01:44:29,787
What are you doing?

1504
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:31,821
We're celebrating.

1505
01:44:33,761 --> 01:44:37,219
- You deserve it.
- Wait. Nonalcoholic.

1506
01:44:37,431 --> 01:44:40,628
- What's the damn point?
- Just drink it, man.

1507
01:44:41,302 --> 01:44:43,065
There you go.

1508
01:44:44,271 --> 01:44:45,828
All right, guys...

1509
01:44:46,039 --> 01:44:47,973
l want you to listen up.

1510
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:51,009
l wanna tell you something.

1511
01:44:53,046 --> 01:44:56,447
ln all my years of being associated
with baseball teams,

1512
01:44:56,649 --> 01:44:59,618
being around them,
seeing them, whatever...

1513
01:44:59,819 --> 01:45:02,514
l gotta tell you,
this is my favorite team.

1514
01:45:04,523 --> 01:45:07,151
l'm real proud of you guys.

1515
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:10,226
You played your asses off against...

1516
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:13,990
Well, pretty-- Pretty big odds.

1517
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:17,465
But...

1518
01:45:20,571 --> 01:45:23,369
Look at those little bastards
over there.

1519
01:45:23,574 --> 01:45:28,136
Jesus Christ. Well, let's go
get this shit over with, okay?

1520
01:45:36,086 --> 01:45:38,350
On a game like this, kids,

1521
01:45:38,555 --> 01:45:41,217
l just want you all to know
that there's no losers,

1522
01:45:41,424 --> 01:45:43,392
and there's no winners.

1523
01:45:43,593 --> 01:45:46,357
l mean, technically, yeah.

1524
01:45:46,563 --> 01:45:48,860
But these things,
they don't mean anything.

1525
01:45:51,133 --> 01:45:54,034
That's some good weight. Jimmy,
you wanted to say a few words?

1526
01:45:56,372 --> 01:45:58,772
You guys had a good season.

1527
01:45:58,974 --> 01:46:00,874
You started off pretty lame,

1528
01:46:01,076 --> 01:46:03,044
but then you got better.

1529
01:46:03,245 --> 01:46:06,270
We just wanted you to know
that you got our respect.

1530
01:46:07,248 --> 01:46:09,580
- Respect.
- Right on.

1531
01:46:10,084 --> 01:46:12,177
And to the Bears...

1532
01:46:12,387 --> 01:46:14,981
...your second-place trophy.

1533
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:18,058
Gee, thanks, mister.

1534
01:46:19,860 --> 01:46:22,385
Hey, let's bring it in
and give them a cheer, huh?

1535
01:46:22,596 --> 01:46:24,325
Bring it in here.

1536
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:27,625
- One, two, three!
- Bears!

1537
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:31,794
Hey, Yankees!

1538
01:46:32,005 --> 01:46:36,134
You can take your crappy trophies
and shove them right up your asses.

1539
01:46:36,342 --> 01:46:37,866
Nice.

1540
01:46:38,077 --> 01:46:39,977
See you next year, bitches!

1541
01:46:49,655 --> 01:46:51,679
Way to go, guys!

1542
01:47:16,046 --> 01:47:19,345
Hooper, l told you l was gonna
make you into a ballplayer, didn't l?

1543
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:20,812
Good game, Buttermaker.

1544
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:22,076
You too, sweetie. You too.

1545
01:47:22,285 --> 01:47:25,152
And by the way, l meant to
tell you this. lt was Redondo Beach.

1546
01:47:26,389 --> 01:47:27,913
- What?
- When we went out to the beach,

1547
01:47:28,124 --> 01:47:30,684
surfing and all that stuff,
it wasn't Zuma, it was Redondo Beach.

1548
01:47:30,893 --> 01:47:32,485
You wore that stupid
yellow bathing suit.

1549
01:47:32,996 --> 01:47:34,224
You remember.

1550
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:35,920
Of course l remember.

1551
01:47:36,132 --> 01:47:38,964
Next time, we'll go to Zuma.
How's that?

1552
01:47:39,601 --> 01:47:41,091
Okay.

1553
01:47:41,303 --> 01:47:42,736
Great game. l'm proud of you.

1554
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:45,662
Good game. Way to go, Lupus.

1555
01:47:45,907 --> 01:47:49,206
This is what's called
a moral victory, Toby.

1556
01:47:49,411 --> 01:47:51,845
Now, it's not quite as good
as the real thing,

1557
01:47:52,047 --> 01:47:54,810
but it's very nice.

1558
01:47:57,918 --> 01:47:59,749
Way to go, Garo.
Good game, brother.

1559
01:47:59,954 --> 01:48:01,353
l told him we won.

1560
01:48:01,555 --> 01:48:03,216
Excellent.
See what l'm talking about?
