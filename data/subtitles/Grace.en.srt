1
00:02:50,364 --> 00:02:54,116
Woman: I just loved breastfeeding.
And you know what's great?

2
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,870
You can eat whatever you want
and not gain weight.

3
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:59,497
And it's good for the baby.

4
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:03,501
Did you know you can
nurse past menopause?

5
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:05,669
As long at the nipples
get enough attention,

6
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:07,756
it reactivates the hormones.

7
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,049
Neuroendocrine reflex.

8
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:12,634
Oh no, that's something else.

9
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:18,390
Honey, do you have
my sweetener?

10
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:20,143
Sure, Mom.

11
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,653
Is there very much
protein in tofu?

12
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,990
It's tempeh.
It's full of it.

13
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:38,243
Vivian's been thinking
of trying Atkins.

14
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:43,625
Don't eat that.

15
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:49,421
You'll get gas for days.

16
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,883
So you weren't crazy about
this last doctor either.

17
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,926
Ma.

18
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,932
He had us wait two hours.
He only gave us five minutes.

19
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,933
He didn't even look me in the eye.

20
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:04,687
It's too bad you didn't
like Richard Sohn.

21
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:07,064
He's been treating me for years.

22
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:11,652
His niece tried a manslaughter case
in my court last week.

23
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:13,695
She looks wonderful.

24
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,573
You remember her.

25
00:04:15,657 --> 00:04:18,951
It was a terrible case.
This woman

26
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:23,372
starved her baby to death
feeding it wheatgrass.

27
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,127
It's lucky she had a jury trial.

28
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:32,590
I'd have locked her up.

29
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,141
I'm going to see a midwife.

30
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,851
At which hospital?

31
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,853
It's an independent clinic.
It's self-contained.

32
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,939
There's a reason people
have babies in hospitals.

33
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:51,567
- Son: We're just checking it out.
- She's the best midwife working.

34
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:54,319
Madeline was her
assistant professor at Amesley.

35
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:56,906
The best is in a hospital.

36
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,742
I do know a little bit
about this, you know.

37
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,122
So do I.

38
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:43,577
I'm trying to keep
an open mind about this.

39
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:45,788
I know.

40
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:49,167
Anybody breaks out a power crystal,
we're leaving.

41
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,543
Deal.

42
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:01,596
Hello?

43
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,973
I think we're in the wrong place.

44
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:05,891
Could be.

45
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,853
I'm Shelly, the labor doula
and chief assistant midwife.

46
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:11,396
I assist Patty with all the births.

47
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:14,399
Sit down. Let me grab her.
Have a cookie.

48
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:16,401
They're vegan.

49
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:18,153
Great.

50
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:25,119
Herbal.

51
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:31,417
Hi, Maddy.

52
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,298
You look great.

53
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:40,218
Um, this is my husband Michael.

54
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,302
- Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:44,973
- Did you get a cookie?
- No, not yet.

56
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,432
She told you
they were vegan, didn't she?

57
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:49,394
I swear they are fantastic.

58
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:56,483
We keep the focus
on you and your baby.

59
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,612
Not just the birth, but those
crucial first moments too.

60
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,783
It's beautiful.

61
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:08,120
Those first interactions between you
and your baby are so powerful.

62
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,665
They create biochemical responses
that we don't even understand.

63
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,502
The sensitive period..
it's birth psychology.

64
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:18,423
Mm-hmm.

65
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,343
Patty:
I'm sure you have some questions.

66
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:25,471
- Michael: Are you a licensed doctor?
- I have a PhD in holistic obstetrics.

67
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:27,807
I also spent five years
training in a dozen

68
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,934
different Eastern
healing modalities,

69
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:33,103
- in Nepal, Thailand...
- Medical doctor, I meant.

70
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:36,941
- I have an MD from Columbia.
- I didn't see any degrees.

71
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:39,444
The less this place looks
like a hospital, the better.

72
00:07:39,528 --> 00:07:42,822
Just no reason to medicalize
a perfect process.

73
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:46,451
See, if I break my leg, I'm not going
to get a chiropractor to set it.

74
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:49,704
But with pregnancy,
there's nothing broken.

75
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:51,788
But things do get broken
in the process.

76
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:54,167
Mostly at hospitals.

77
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,504
Here. All the stats are all in there.
The studies are all state-funded.

78
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:00,673
Nothing is private.
Medical interventions

79
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:03,259
can be miraculous,
but not everybody needs a miracle.

80
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:05,677
Most of the time
they just create complications

81
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,637
and we end up treating
the treatment.

82
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:10,057
Madeline: "Mothers are
three to six times more likely

83
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:13,269
to die delivering in a hospital
than a midwife-supervised clinic

84
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:16,105
...or home birth. "
It's on page 14.

85
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,778
Madeline, you said you had
taken fertility drugs.

86
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:25,238
Yeah, for three years.

87
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:28,951
But I'd been off them for 11 months
before she came.

88
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,955
We got pregnant twice, but...

89
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,336
Hey.

90
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:41,463
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,674
Here.

92
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,392
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

93
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:15,706
With proper care, these cows
could supply Grade A milk...

94
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:52,994
Oh, Jonesy.

95
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:56,413
I have nice food for you right here.

96
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,655
Mm-mm.

97
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,336
Thanks for doing this.

98
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:54,889
Ahh.

99
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,482
- No.
- No?

100
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:12,822
Jonesy killed another rat today.

101
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:17,577
Can't feed him soy milk.
You're driving him to murder.

102
00:11:17,663 --> 00:11:20,038
Did you take the car in?

103
00:11:20,123 --> 00:11:22,541
$2,000 later it's still
making the same noise.

104
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,669
Should have never
bought an SUV.

105
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,797
It's a hybrid.

106
00:11:29,716 --> 00:11:32,717
- Ooh.
- Are you okay?

107
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:38,139
It's just gas or something.

108
00:11:40,726 --> 00:11:42,769
I bought Patricia Lang's book.

109
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:47,817
She thanked you in the forward
and you two were really close.

110
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,943
Yeah, I learned a lot from her.

111
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:52,113
She was a really amazing teacher.

112
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:55,240
Some of her stuff
is pretty far out.

113
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:57,576
She revolutionized
Women's Studies.

114
00:11:57,661 --> 00:12:00,120
We had a two-year wait list
for her class at Amesley.

115
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:02,748
Hmm.

116
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,168
Michael, we have
an answering machine.

117
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,297
It's Ma. I'll grab it in the kitchen.

118
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:16,261
Oooh.

119
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:18,972
Ahhh.

120
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:20,932
Ah.

121
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:23,436
- Michael?
- Vivian: Michael?

122
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,520
- Ow, my chest.
- Vivian: What's happening?

123
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:27,815
- Can you move?
- Call Patricia.

124
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,150
- Is something wrong with Madeline?
- Ma, I have to go.

125
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:32,193
Don't call Dr. Sohn.
We're going to the ER.

126
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:34,529
Doctor: Is this the first time
she's had chest pains, sir?

127
00:12:34,614 --> 00:12:38,116
- Michael: Yeah, as far as I know.
- Okay, let's get some levels on her.

128
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:41,370
Man: It's all right, Michael.
It's all right.

129
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:43,371
Richard Sohn, what,
are you slumming?

130
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:46,292
The mother-in-law called me.
She's a friend of the family.

131
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,376
Your mother's on her way back
from Hillbrook.

132
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:52,048
- She'll be here in a hour.
- We giving you some trouble, Dick?

133
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:54,799
Yes, well, par for the course
in my line.

134
00:12:54,884 --> 00:12:58,511
So what do we have? Upper-right
quadrant pain, elevated blood...

135
00:12:58,596 --> 00:13:00,556
this is pre-eclampsia.

136
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,058
We're going to need to induce.
We need to induce right now.

137
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,644
- No, she's only 31 weeks.
- Let's get three 35mcg

138
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,897
vaginal doses of cytotec.
We're inducing.

139
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,856
- No no. No!
- Michael: What's that?

140
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:12,485
- Mike, Mike, I'll take care of her.
- No.

141
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:14,653
Madeline:
Call Patricia. Michael, please!

142
00:13:14,738 --> 00:13:17,490
- He's not her doctor, Ma.
- Michael, I am not discussing this.

143
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:20,743
Well, you shouldn't have
sent him in the first place.

144
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:23,245
Hello? Ma!

145
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,996
- Shit.
- Is she okay?

146
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:28,292
They said it was something...
pre... pre-eclampsia?

147
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:31,669
If it's pre-eclampsia the only thing
they can do is deliver. What happened?

148
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:34,090
We were having dinner
and she just started complaining.

149
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:35,758
She called my name.
I was in the other room.

150
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:38,177
- Where is she?
- All the way down on the far left.

151
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,096
Is there blood?

152
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,431
She just said it felt like gas,
like in her chest.

153
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:44,767
- Okay, what about her breathing?
- Pretty even.

154
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,686
It was higher because she was in pain,
but I don't think it was bad.

155
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,730
- Madeline: Get off me!
- Hold her down.

156
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:52,274
- What the hell is going on?
- You can't be in here.

157
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:54,610
- You can't be in here, miss.
- I'm her midwife.

158
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,196
- Madeline: It's too soon.
- Why isn't she sedated?

159
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,115
- Where's the pain?
- Upper-right quadrant.

160
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:01,450
increased blood pressure,
probably HELLP syndrome.

161
00:14:01,534 --> 00:14:03,952
- We're inducing now.
- Is it moving to the shoulder blade?

162
00:14:04,037 --> 00:14:06,371
- You cannot be in here.
- What are her levels?

163
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,960
Oh, tell me you checked her levels
before ordering an induction.

164
00:14:11,043 --> 00:14:13,336
If this is hypertension,
that baby is in jeopardy.

165
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,255
- Not if it's a gallstone, she's not.
- I'm calling security.

166
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,466
I am her doctor and I'm not going
anywhere until I see numbers.

167
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:20,260
You throw me out of here and you murder
that baby because of your negligence

168
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:22,429
and I swear to God, I will see
that you never work again.

169
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:24,974
- Get those numbers now.
- What is your name?

170
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,725
- I'm Dr. Richard Sohn.
- Where are your scrubs?

171
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:29,812
I'm a friend of the family.

172
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:32,148
- He's not my doctor.
- If you're wrong,

173
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:34,732
- you're in serious trouble.
- Go fuck yourself.

174
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,947
Cancel the cytotec.

175
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,866
Schedule an ultrasound to confirm
the presence of a stone.

176
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:17,610
- Maybe you should just pull over.
- Where?

177
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,376
Asshole.

178
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:38,087
Are you okay?

179
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:41,008
Do you hear that?

180
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,541
Madeline:
She isn't moving.

181
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:21,423
Call Patricia.

182
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,999
Shelly: The police are
coming with an ambulance.

183
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,500
She won't go.

184
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:59,586
She needs to go
to a regular hospital.

185
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:02,089
They'll induce her.
She won't go.

186
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:06,259
The baby's dead, Patty.

187
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,887
Patty: She'll deliver
on her own in three weeks.

188
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:12,057
Shelly: She can't make
that decision right now.

189
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:13,642
She doesn't know what she wants.

190
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,395
She knows exactly
what she wants.

191
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,027
Henry?

192
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:30,742
What's the matter?

193
00:17:33,538 --> 00:17:36,498
- What?
- This room is a pigsty.

194
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:41,127
- It looks okay to me.
- Pick up your room!

195
00:17:42,588 --> 00:17:44,173
Clean up!

196
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:51,763
Vivian, it's okay.

197
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:54,098
Don't.

198
00:17:58,104 --> 00:17:59,771
Thank you.

199
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,531
Henry?

200
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:14,036
Henry?

201
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:18,289
Michael... Michael.

202
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,351
Michael's voice on answering machine:
Hi, you've reached the Mathesons.

203
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:39,435
Before you know it, we're gonna
have a teenager on our hands,

204
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,396
so leave a message
while you can still get through.

205
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,566
Madeline, it's Patty.

206
00:18:44,651 --> 00:18:47,736
We should talk soon
about the delivery.

207
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:53,157
You should try to get out. It's not good
for you to be too stationary right now.

208
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:56,244
Um, call me, okay?

209
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:45,626
Did you find
what you were looking for?

210
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,214
Miss?

211
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:08,817
All right, Mad, you're doing great.

212
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:13,654
See me, see me, see me.
Look look look.

213
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,990
Look here, right here.
Breathe breathe.

214
00:20:16,075 --> 00:20:19,744
It's okay now. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

215
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:22,998
Madeline, we're gonna
move you now.

216
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:26,417
- Up we go, smooth motion.
- Traveling traveling.

217
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:28,336
And shifting.
Coming around.

218
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:30,631
Get the arms around her.

219
00:20:33,926 --> 00:20:35,469
The baby's descended.

220
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:37,512
We've got to put her in the tub.
She's in too much pain.

221
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:38,846
In the tub, in the tub.

222
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:41,808
Melissa, you need
to bring her back here.

223
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:44,310
- She's too tight.
- I've got her.

224
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:51,401
- I've got left... up!
- Okay, come on, get her back in.

225
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:54,320
Give me the left. We've got you,
we've got you, we've got you.

226
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:56,573
Shifting!

227
00:20:57,616 --> 00:20:59,326
You'll be okay, all right.

228
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,537
All right, all right.
Get her head.

229
00:21:01,621 --> 00:21:03,413
- Ow, I'm tearing!
- No no no.

230
00:21:03,498 --> 00:21:04,789
You're not tearing, baby.

231
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,428
Push push push.

232
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:50,335
Can I hold her?

233
00:21:56,174 --> 00:21:57,968
Please?

234
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:17,237
Suction.

235
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:20,406
Suction.
Do it now.

236
00:22:54,817 --> 00:22:56,734
You're so little.

237
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:16,380
Do you know how much
I want you to stay?

238
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,640
Please stay.

239
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,720
Madeline, you can't
will a baby back to I...

240
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,518
...life.

241
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,022
It's Grace.

242
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:19,700
Her name is Grace.

243
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:20,484
Did you put those photos aside?

244
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,863
Vivian on phone-
Did you put those photos aside?

245
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:26,407
Madeline: It's been hard packing
his things, Vivian. I'm sorry.

246
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:29,827
Vivian: I can stop by today
if you'd just put them in a box for me.

247
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:32,748
I'll spend some time with the baby.
I'm sure you could use the help.

248
00:24:32,832 --> 00:24:34,499
- Ow.
- Was that the baby?

249
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:37,877
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. She's fine.

250
00:24:37,961 --> 00:24:40,337
Let's make an appointment
for you to see a doctor.

251
00:24:41,673 --> 00:24:44,175
Vivian, I have to go.

252
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,385
Why not just go in
and see Dr. Sohn?

253
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,596
Because Dr. Sohn isn't my doctor.

254
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:52,476
I know you've been seeing your friend,
but a midwife isn't a doctor.

255
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,104
- She is a doctor.
- If you can't get out to his office

256
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:58,773
I can ask him to stop by for a visit.

257
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:00,942
Vivian, this is a bad time.
I have to go.

258
00:25:01,027 --> 00:25:04,112
- I will be leaving work a little early.
- My mother-in-law.

259
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,490
Vivian: It would be great
to have a little time with her.

260
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:08,450
I'm sure she'd love to see her
grandmother

261
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:10,743
and I know Henry is just
dying to see her.

262
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:14,247
And I'm sure you'd love
an opportunity to retrench.

263
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:16,625
- Patty: Hey, there.
- No, I can take care of her.

264
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,501
- Bye, Vivian.
- Don't forget the photos.

265
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:22,756
She breast-fed Michael
till he was three years old.

266
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,634
She misses him.

267
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:29,471
Um, I'm sorry.
Can I use your bathroom?

268
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,393
Oh, I got these.

269
00:25:35,478 --> 00:25:38,939
I realized that I never gave you
a congratulations gift.

270
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,361
It's like a women's version
of a cigar, I guess. Heh.

271
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:01,752
Idiot.

272
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,011
The pressure is applied
intermittently between bleedings

273
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:12,763
to preserve the animal's blood

274
00:26:12,848 --> 00:26:15,432
in its own body and ensure
the freshness of samples.

275
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:18,686
The blood must be centrifuged
before clotting begins...

276
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,438
Pleasant.

277
00:26:22,023 --> 00:26:25,359
Animal Channel... I'm hooked.

278
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:28,238
It's like a vegan horror movie.

279
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:31,657
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

280
00:26:31,741 --> 00:26:35,537
Oh, hey! You know what?
I got her something.

281
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:38,789
Um, here.
PachelBaby's my favorite.

282
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,709
Oh, and...

283
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:46,882
- You didn't have to do all this.
- Sure, I did.

284
00:26:46,965 --> 00:26:49,467
Toy:
I love to hug my kitty.

285
00:26:50,552 --> 00:26:53,846
- Patty: God, she's beautiful.
- She hardly ever cries.

286
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:58,184
- How are you doing?
- No complaints.

287
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:00,019
Nipples hurt a little bit.

288
00:27:00,104 --> 00:27:03,397
Keep those things stimulated,
you'll be able to nurse till you're 60.

289
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:06,276
- Neuroendocrine reflex.
- You got it.

290
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,909
- How was the blood work?
- It was all normal.

291
00:27:13,992 --> 00:27:15,868
Of course it was.

292
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:18,829
Madeline, I know that you do not
want to take her to the hospital,

293
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:21,415
but there are some tests
that can help us understand...

294
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,417
We're not a case study.

295
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:26,755
- I don't need to understand a miracle.
- Madeline...

296
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:28,798
If it were up to them
she would be dead.

297
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:32,093
You said you could take care of anything
she needs. If you don't want to help...

298
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:34,346
- No, all right, I get it.
- ... I'll find somebody else.

299
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,472
Oh, Dr. Jones!

300
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:39,558
The prominent
North American rat surgeon lives.

301
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:41,769
Oh, he's huge.

302
00:27:42,813 --> 00:27:46,191
Do you remember what Tracey Sullivan
used to call the three of us?

303
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:50,862
Ma and Pa and Baby J.

304
00:27:52,365 --> 00:27:54,156
Don't.

305
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:57,076
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:30,943
How about this?

307
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,740
Grace, okay okay.

308
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:50,397
All right, out you go.

309
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:27,727
Oh my God!

310
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:38,298
Oh, Jonesy.

311
00:32:02,865 --> 00:32:05,115
All clean!

312
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:10,163
No more bugs, no more stinky.

313
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,210
Hi, my girl.

314
00:32:15,294 --> 00:32:18,712
Come on.

315
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:33,102
# The stars in heaven #

316
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:36,064
# Tucked in the sun #

317
00:32:37,441 --> 00:32:39,942
# And each little flower #

318
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:43,403
# Knows this day is done #

319
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:47,075
# And one lonesome bird sings #

320
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,493
# A quiet good night #

321
00:32:49,577 --> 00:32:53,539
# My sweet little angel #

322
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:57,210
# It's time for good night #

323
00:32:57,294 --> 00:33:00,922
# So sleep and dream #

324
00:33:01,006 --> 00:33:04,424
# Just close your eyes #

325
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:07,929
# And I'll be here waiting #

326
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:11,598
# The moment you rise #

327
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:15,728
# So sleep little angel #

328
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:19,731
# It's time for good night. #

329
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:24,903
Baby, bath time's over.

330
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:27,740
Don't cry. I'm sorry.

331
00:33:30,577 --> 00:33:32,912
Machine:
You've reached Nature Birth.

332
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:36,457
Leave a message and we'll
get back to you after the miracle.

333
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:40,002
Grace has a really bad rash...
she smells funny.

334
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,962
I don't know.
I put her in the tub...

335
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:46,009
I really don't know what happened.
The temperature was fine.

336
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,677
Maybe it was the soap.

337
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,930
I don't know, can you call me back?

338
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:56,728
Oh, piece of crap.

339
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:59,980
I know, okay okay okay.
I know, sweetie.

340
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:01,691
I know, I know.

341
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:05,528
Let's have a nice snack.
Shh-hhh.

342
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:09,949
Shhh. Here we go.
Here we go.

343
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:12,659
All right, all right.

344
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,661
Come on, Gracie.

345
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:25,922
Okay, let's lay down.

346
00:35:06,632 --> 00:35:08,382
Are you okay?

347
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:11,385
Yeah.

348
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:16,516
- Are you going somewhere?
- No.

349
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,184
Uh, well, I don't know.

350
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:20,978
I thought it might be fun to go
for a road trip or something.

351
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:22,480
You know, get away?

352
00:35:22,563 --> 00:35:25,483
- From me?
- No, of course not.

353
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,612
She's sick.

354
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:36,827
Whatever you had with her
is over.

355
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:28,920
Are you ready for a snack?

356
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:35,762
Oh, honey.

357
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:43,561
Okay.

358
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:53,945
Gentle, honey.

359
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,157
Ahh!

360
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,898
Ow!

361
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:58,797
Ow.

362
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:32,956
Sweetheart.

363
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:38,086
You have to eat something.

364
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,880
Oh...

365
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:58,858
Please, honey.

366
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:06,657
You need to eat something.

367
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:11,911
Baby, please.

368
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:29,597
Okay, Mommy needs a break.

369
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,572
# The stars in heaven #

370
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:51,744
# Tucked in the sun #

371
00:41:51,827 --> 00:41:55,789
# And each little flower #

372
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:59,710
# Knows this day is done #

373
00:42:02,213 --> 00:42:06,217
# And one lonesome bird sings #

374
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,887
# A quiet good night #

375
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:17,478
# My sweet little angel #

376
00:42:17,561 --> 00:42:21,148
# It's time to sleep tight #

377
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,655
# So sleep and dream #

378
00:42:29,074 --> 00:42:32,701
# Just close your eyes #

379
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:40,583
# I'll be here waiting #

380
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:45,840
# The moment you rise... #

381
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,552
Man:
Kinder kills, cleaner cuts.

382
00:43:31,635 --> 00:43:36,389
Carl's Cows have no antibiotics
and no synthetic growth hormones.

383
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:40,101
Kinder kills, cleaner cuts.

384
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:44,731
Carl's Cows have no antibiotics
and no synthetic growth hormones.

385
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:48,277
Kinder kills, cleaner cuts.

386
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:53,072
Carl's Cows have no antibiotics
and no synthetic growth hormones.

387
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:55,867
Kinder kills, cleaner cut...

388
00:44:25,023 --> 00:44:27,942
I know, honey, just a sec.

389
00:44:43,708 --> 00:44:45,751
Come on.

390
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,471
Please.

391
00:46:09,753 --> 00:46:12,128
Grace!

392
00:46:16,384 --> 00:46:19,260
- Shelly, it's Madeline.
- She's not in, Madeline.

393
00:46:19,346 --> 00:46:21,972
- When will she be back?
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

394
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:25,016
Please have her call me when she
gets back. It's an emergency.

395
00:46:25,101 --> 00:46:27,603
Okay.

396
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:46,996
Yes, sir.

397
00:46:47,081 --> 00:46:49,248
Thank you.

398
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,210
Excuse me.

399
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:53,670
I'd like to see Dr. Sohn.

400
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,923
- Yes?
- Mrs. Matheson is insisting...

401
00:46:57,007 --> 00:47:00,094
...on seeing you...
Judge Matheson.

402
00:47:00,177 --> 00:47:02,846
Send her in.

403
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:14,690
- Your Honor.
- Hi, Richard.

404
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:19,112
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

405
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:21,782
I'm so sorry about Mike.

406
00:47:23,451 --> 00:47:25,786
The woman he married...

407
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:27,621
she's sick.

408
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:30,456
Does she need a referral?
I could...

409
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:33,751
After the accident,
she told us the baby was dead,

410
00:47:33,836 --> 00:47:36,797
but that she was going
to carry it to term anyway.

411
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:41,385
We were going to pretend
it was a stillbirth.

412
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:45,139
But then when I didn't hear from her,
I phoned the birthing clinic...

413
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:49,809
about the funeral arrangements.
And the assistant told me

414
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:53,563
that the baby had been born
and that it was fine.

415
00:47:54,815 --> 00:47:57,985
- Who's her OB?
- A midwife delivered.

416
00:47:58,068 --> 00:48:01,155
Madeline won't go to a hospital.
She won't see a real doctor.

417
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:04,032
She doesn't even
pick up the phone.

418
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:05,992
Well, have you
called the police?

419
00:48:06,077 --> 00:48:09,036
I've seen this 1,000 times.

420
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:13,250
If I file with the police, that baby
will spend weeks in state care,

421
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:15,918
while Youth Services
shuffles paperwork.

422
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,840
I do not want this woman

423
00:48:19,923 --> 00:48:22,425
raising my granddaughter.

424
00:48:24,344 --> 00:48:26,972
If I...

425
00:48:27,056 --> 00:48:29,516
could get a medical report

426
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:32,643
confirming that she's not fit...

427
00:48:34,938 --> 00:48:37,398
And you'd take the baby?

428
00:48:40,068 --> 00:48:42,445
My son is gone.

429
00:48:49,786 --> 00:48:52,079
Well...

430
00:48:52,164 --> 00:48:54,833
maybe there's something

431
00:48:54,918 --> 00:48:57,668
that you could do for me too.

432
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,054
I... I got myself in a little trouble.

433
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:10,306
Shhh.

434
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:20,692
Just help me and I'll help you.

435
00:49:33,373 --> 00:49:35,873
Shhh.

436
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:41,295
Sohn: Mrs. Matheson?

437
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:58,230
Vivian, it's Richard.

438
00:49:58,313 --> 00:50:01,650
I can't prove neglect
unless she opens up.

439
00:50:03,193 --> 00:50:05,237
I said I would help.

440
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:16,206
Shhh.

441
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:19,626
No one's gonna take you away.

442
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,378
Shhh.

443
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,009
Shhh.

444
00:50:37,228 --> 00:50:39,563
Michael's voice:
Hi, you've reached the Mathesons.

445
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:42,231
Before you know it, we're going
to have a teenager on our hands,

446
00:50:42,317 --> 00:50:44,443
so leave a message
while you can still get through.

447
00:51:42,918 --> 00:51:45,378
Oh my God, what happened?

448
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:48,715
Shhh.

449
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,550
Okay, shhh.

450
00:51:51,635 --> 00:51:54,471
Shhh. Okay.

451
00:51:56,474 --> 00:52:00,101
Shhh, okay, come here.

452
00:52:01,228 --> 00:52:04,231
Shhh.

453
00:52:11,614 --> 00:52:14,324
- Oh.
- Toy: I love to hug my kitty.

454
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:21,498
Jonesy?

455
00:52:50,527 --> 00:52:52,778
Shhh.

456
00:52:52,864 --> 00:52:55,030
Baby, you just ate.

457
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:57,659
I know, honey.
Mommy's thirsty too.

458
00:53:15,552 --> 00:53:18,179
When Lucy came in,

459
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:21,682
she had so many fleas,
they were literally sucking her dry.

460
00:53:23,603 --> 00:53:26,938
If she stayed out there, the chill
and fatigue would get worse

461
00:53:27,023 --> 00:53:30,650
and eventually the heart
just wouldn't be able to keep up.

462
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:34,737
For her to have a chance,
even without the fleas,

463
00:53:34,822 --> 00:53:37,490
we'd have to load her system
with the vitamins she lost.

464
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:41,827
The owner had no malicious intent...
if you can't take care of yourself

465
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:44,289
how do you take care of your animal?

466
00:53:58,387 --> 00:54:01,681
- Shelly, please!
- I can take another message.

467
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:03,599
I've been trying for two days.

468
00:54:03,684 --> 00:54:06,686
I'm sure she got your voicemail.

469
00:54:06,771 --> 00:54:10,023
Have you thought more about
going to the hospital?

470
00:54:10,106 --> 00:54:12,733
- Just have her call me back.
- Okay.

471
00:54:18,074 --> 00:54:20,784
- Who was that?
- The trailer guy.

472
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:25,831
It's a motor home.

473
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:42,179
Richard, it's me.

474
00:54:42,264 --> 00:54:44,641
I need you to go back.

475
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:46,351
Today.

476
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:48,936
I need you to go back today.
I am not letting that baby

477
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:51,565
spend one more night
with that woman.

478
00:54:51,648 --> 00:54:54,525
Just give me till this evening.

479
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:57,612
Good.

480
00:56:25,492 --> 00:56:28,119
Patricia?

481
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:33,248
Mrs. Matheson?

482
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,543
There there now. It's all right.

483
00:56:36,628 --> 00:56:39,005
It's all right.

484
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,925
I'm sick.

485
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:44,260
I'm here to help.

486
00:56:45,471 --> 00:56:47,554
Come and sit down.
Come and sit down.

487
00:56:50,768 --> 00:56:53,436
That's it.

488
00:56:55,773 --> 00:56:57,898
We're not going to the hospital.

489
00:56:57,983 --> 00:57:01,277
I can't help you unless
I know what's going on.

490
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:04,822
I'm just so cold.

491
00:57:04,907 --> 00:57:08,952
Could you open
your mouth for me, please?

492
00:57:21,673 --> 00:57:25,635
You're badly anemic.
I'm going to have to do a proper exam.

493
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:27,554
What kind of exam?

494
00:57:27,637 --> 00:57:31,557
Well, it is a serious condition,
but it can probably be treated

495
00:57:31,641 --> 00:57:33,976
with a little time
and proper nourishment.

496
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:38,313
It may be a simple as feeding
the baby a little formula

497
00:57:38,398 --> 00:57:41,108
for a little bit to give
your body time to recoup.

498
00:57:41,193 --> 00:57:43,570
But I need to do a proper exam

499
00:57:43,653 --> 00:57:46,697
to confirm the extent of
the condition.

500
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:53,746
It, um, it can be slightly intrusive.

501
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:58,418
Maybe... maybe you'd just better get
the child and we can go to the hospital.

502
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:01,838
No! No, please.
I don't care if it's intrusive.

503
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,590
Hmm.

504
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:30,992
- If you're too cold to disrobe, we...
- No!

505
00:58:33,704 --> 00:58:37,206
Turn around.
Unbutton your shirt.

506
00:58:46,132 --> 00:58:48,510
Nice and deep.

507
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,474
Again.

508
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,606
I'm gonna need one of these.

509
00:59:12,076 --> 00:59:13,784
Now I'm going to stick you.

510
00:59:14,829 --> 00:59:16,411
Are you ready?

511
00:59:27,925 --> 00:59:29,967
Is that it?

512
00:59:30,052 --> 00:59:32,177
Just one more.

513
00:59:32,262 --> 00:59:35,306
I'm sorry. I should have
explained it to you.

514
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:38,351
I'm going to need a sample
of your breast milk...

515
00:59:38,434 --> 00:59:41,896
to make sure that the baby is
getting what she needs.

516
00:59:43,606 --> 00:59:46,275
The newer models are
much less cumbersome,

517
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,112
but these old brass units provide
a much more natural suction.

518
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:54,742
- One of them is sore.
- All I need is one.

519
00:59:56,077 --> 00:59:58,496
I know the pewter looks
a little archaic,

520
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:03,208
but the leather seals are much more
gentle than the plastic flanges.

521
01:00:03,293 --> 01:00:06,461
And the jars were bigger because
with such a precision instrument,

522
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:10,592
your supply would be triple.
This is the original blown-glass.

523
01:00:16,306 --> 01:00:19,851
Why don't you hold these?
I'm going to need both of my hands.

524
01:00:22,771 --> 01:00:25,481
It's quite all right to turn around.

525
01:00:29,068 --> 01:00:31,070
Whenever you're ready.

526
01:00:31,155 --> 01:00:34,489
Just let me know
if the suction's too much.

527
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:04,603
Is she sick?

528
01:01:04,688 --> 01:01:06,606
She's just cranky.

529
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,072
That baby is sick.

530
01:01:14,155 --> 01:01:16,114
She's just got a little bit
of a cough.

531
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:18,117
Where is she?
Where is she?

532
01:01:18,202 --> 01:01:20,954
Just let her rest.
She's fine. Please!

533
01:01:21,038 --> 01:01:25,333
Please, you don't understand.

534
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,210
Vivian, it's Richie...

535
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:29,878
Ahh!

536
01:01:39,056 --> 01:01:40,974
Oh, come on, come on.

537
01:01:41,057 --> 01:01:43,643
Henry, I can't hear myself think!

538
01:01:48,398 --> 01:01:50,775
- Did you get Richard?
- Please...

539
01:01:50,858 --> 01:01:53,027
just...

540
01:01:53,112 --> 01:01:55,320
finish the crib.

541
01:03:42,346 --> 01:03:45,556
Richard, pick up.
Call me back.

542
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:48,266
I'm going over there.

543
01:05:24,072 --> 01:05:26,407
Shelly: I'm heading out.
Do you need anything?

544
01:05:26,492 --> 01:05:27,699
No, thanks.

545
01:05:41,507 --> 01:05:44,717
Is this Cory? Hi, it's Patricia Lang
calling about the motor home.

546
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,969
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get back.

547
01:05:47,054 --> 01:05:49,262
I wanted to go ahead
and move forward.

548
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:51,932
Cory: I was going to call you back,
but I lost your number.

549
01:05:52,016 --> 01:05:54,434
I thought you left
a message with Shelly.

550
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:58,063
- Shelly?
- Shelly my assistant.

551
01:07:52,262 --> 01:07:54,512
Madeline?

552
01:07:54,597 --> 01:07:57,057
Are you home?

553
01:07:58,518 --> 01:08:01,144
The door was open.

554
01:08:01,228 --> 01:08:03,938
Um, I'm just feeding the baby.

555
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:12,489
Why don't you make yourself some tea?
I'll be right down.

556
01:08:12,574 --> 01:08:15,034
Do you want anything?

557
01:08:15,117 --> 01:08:16,827
I'm fine.

558
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:20,831
Okay.

559
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,137
Come on, honey, please.

560
01:10:45,769 --> 01:10:48,770
Oh, I'm sorry.

561
01:10:48,854 --> 01:10:51,105
Shhh.

562
01:10:53,443 --> 01:10:55,985
Can I have a little peek?

563
01:11:01,283 --> 01:11:03,661
- What are you doing here?
- I was worried.

564
01:11:03,744 --> 01:11:06,287
Jesus, Madeline,
you look terrible.

565
01:11:06,372 --> 01:11:09,500
I haven't been getting
enough sleep.

566
01:11:12,295 --> 01:11:15,840
Can I have some tea?

567
01:11:15,923 --> 01:11:18,132
I ran out.

568
01:11:18,217 --> 01:11:21,386
When was the last time
you saw a doctor?

569
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:24,180
Today. I'm fine, really.

570
01:11:24,265 --> 01:11:28,185
They did some blood tests and told me
to use formula for a few days.

571
01:11:29,354 --> 01:11:31,729
I'm just tired.

572
01:11:31,814 --> 01:11:33,690
Richard Sohn
didn't stop by, did he?

573
01:11:35,402 --> 01:11:38,904
No. You asked him
to check on me?

574
01:11:38,988 --> 01:11:41,073
I got worried.

575
01:11:41,157 --> 01:11:43,199
You haven't been
picking up the phone.

576
01:11:43,284 --> 01:11:46,244
I just wanted to see
if everything was all right.

577
01:11:46,328 --> 01:11:49,081
God, Madeline, you look terrible.

578
01:11:49,164 --> 01:11:51,000
Can we do this
another time, Vivian?

579
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:53,543
Could I just have a quick look at her?

580
01:11:53,627 --> 01:11:55,671
No.

581
01:11:56,922 --> 01:11:59,257
She's had a tough day
and I want her to sleep.

582
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:01,051
Tomorrow, okay?

583
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:04,846
Is she sick?

584
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:08,225
Vivian, really, tomorrow.

585
01:12:13,773 --> 01:12:15,983
Okay.

586
01:12:25,952 --> 01:12:28,119
I, um...

587
01:12:28,203 --> 01:12:31,206
have to go to the loo
before I go home.

588
01:13:38,608 --> 01:13:41,359
Vivian!

589
01:13:50,036 --> 01:13:52,496
Grace?

590
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:27,948
Vivian!

591
01:14:46,176 --> 01:14:48,342
Get away from us.

592
01:14:48,427 --> 01:14:51,345
Please, you don't understand.

593
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:55,016
She's special.
She needs special food.

594
01:14:56,728 --> 01:14:59,354
You're sick. Get back!

595
01:15:03,318 --> 01:15:05,234
Please, just let her go.

596
01:15:07,613 --> 01:15:09,405
Let her go.

597
01:15:12,118 --> 01:15:13,409
You'll kill her.

598
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:21,126
Madeline?

599
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:31,095
Oh God.

600
01:15:32,137 --> 01:15:34,389
Oh God.

601
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:36,725
Oh God...

602
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:39,478
Please.

603
01:15:39,561 --> 01:15:40,645
Wake up.

604
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:42,730
Wake... oh, Jesus.

605
01:15:42,815 --> 01:15:45,484
Oh, please, I'm sorry.

606
01:16:16,724 --> 01:16:18,766
Madeline.

607
01:17:43,394 --> 01:17:45,436
Patty:
How you doing, fatso?

608
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,055
Dinnertime, baby.

609
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,418
Come here, Jonesy.

610
01:19:03,224 --> 01:19:05,975
It's so quiet back here.

611
01:19:07,353 --> 01:19:09,688
God, she looks fantastic.

612
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:11,773
She finally had something to eat?

613
01:19:14,027 --> 01:19:16,444
I told you everything
tested healthy.

614
01:19:16,529 --> 01:19:18,863
It's all about
maintaining your diet.

615
01:19:18,948 --> 01:19:23,368
We keep your blood levels up,
we can do this.

616
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,710
There's something else.

617
01:19:33,378 --> 01:19:35,838
She needs more now.

618
01:19:40,886 --> 01:19:43,055
She's teething.

619
01:19:55,193 --> 01:19:58,569
# The stars in heaven #

620
01:19:58,654 --> 01:20:01,448
# Tucked in the sun #

621
01:20:01,532 --> 01:20:05,202
# And each little flower #

622
01:20:05,286 --> 01:20:07,953
# Knows this day is done #

623
01:20:08,038 --> 01:20:11,666
# And one lonesome bird sings #

624
01:20:11,751 --> 01:20:14,961
# A quiet good night #

625
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:18,297
# My sweet little angel #

626
01:20:18,382 --> 01:20:21,717
# It's time for good night #

627
01:20:21,802 --> 01:20:25,430
# So sleep and dream #

628
01:20:25,515 --> 01:20:29,266
# Just close your eyes #

629
01:20:29,351 --> 01:20:32,729
# I'll be here waiting #

630
01:20:32,814 --> 01:20:36,190
# The moment you rise #

631
01:20:36,274 --> 01:20:40,237
# And one lonesome bird sings #

632
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,489
# A quiet good night #

633
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:46,993
# My sweet little angel #

634
01:20:47,078 --> 01:20:50,287
# It's time to sleep tight. #
