1
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,938
You're always sick.

2
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,435
You were sick when
you were my age.

3
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:00,332
Evening, sir.

4
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:02,631
Evening, Victor.

5
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,629
I didn't realize that
you're still here.

6
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:08,725
I'm just keeping
James company, sir.

7
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:10,424
If that's all right...

8
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:14,221
Very kind of you.

9
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,319
- Are you better, son?
- Still cold, father.

10
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,917
It's just a mild fever, you'll
be all right in the morning.

11
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:22,716
You always say that.

12
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:25,614
And you always pull
through, don't you?

13
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:30,010
Now... take your medicine.

14
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,808
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

15
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,507
<i>Elizabeth.</i>

16
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:36,506
Your father's drunk again.

17
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:38,405
You should help him home, Victor.

18
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:41,103
It's not my name
he's calling, sir.

19
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,700
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James!

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,598
Father!

21
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:51,895
<i>I told you never
to come back here!</i>

22
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,472
James...

23
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:24,170
There are things you
don't understand.

24
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,370
- Don't...
- I need him them to know!

25
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,069
Please no!

26
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,169
- No... more... lies!

27
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:28,068
James...

28
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:48,652
James!

29
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:57,046
He... he wasn't your father...

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,841
...son.

31
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,932
What are you?

32
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:34,620
- I didn't mean it! I didn't--
- Yes, you did!

33
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:39,716
He deserved it!
And you gave it to him.

34
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:45,512
We're brothers, Jimmy.
You realize that?

35
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:47,610
Brothers protect each other.

36
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,709
You have to be hard now.

37
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,805
Hard enough they
can't ever touch us.

38
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:54,604
I want to go home.

39
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:55,305
We can't.

40
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,102
We stick together
no matter what.

41
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:01,199
And take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

42
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,997
Can you do that, little brother?

43
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:12,391
They're coming.
Can you run? Okay.

44
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,887
Keep on running.
Don't look back.

45
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:29,391
Enough! Enough!

46
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:43,781
Stand down, soldier!

47
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,975
Victor!

48
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:59,269
Stand down !

49
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,266
No!

50
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,548
Ready!

51
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:32,045
Aim!

52
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:34,144
Wake me when it's over.

53
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,235
Fire!

54
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,129
My name is Major William Stryker.

55
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:59,526
You've been charged with killing a senior officer.

56
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,324
Is that correct?

57
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:03,723
Apparently we have some
issues with authority.

58
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:04,922
Just keep a lid on it.

59
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:06,821
Sir.

60
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,819
The warden tells me that your
sentence was carried out...

61
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,117
by a firing squad at 1000 hours.

62
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,314
- How'd that go?
- It tickled.

63
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,009
You boys tired of running?

64
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,906
Tired of denying your... true nature?

65
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:27,305
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care...

66
00:08:28,204 --> 00:08:30,204
I care cause I know
how special you are...

67
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:32,302
how valuable.

68
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:37,398
Look.

69
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:41,296
You can stay here, locked
up like freaks of nature...

70
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:44,092
or you can join me.

71
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:46,292
I'm putting together
a special team...

72
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,389
with special privileges.

73
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:50,688
Now tell me...

74
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,385
How would you like to
really serve your country?

75
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:10,774
I love this weapon more than
anything in the whole wide world.

76
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:12,173
- You wanna know why?
- No.

77
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,071
It's memorable.

78
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,769
Sure, it's a little bulky,
to have to get 'em on a plane.

79
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,268
You whip out a
couple of swords...

80
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:20,866
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding...

81
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,565
they will never, ever forget it.

82
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:25,063
That's funny, Wade.

83
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:27,562
I think you confused me with
someone who gives a shit.

84
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:29,960
Right, it is...

85
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,057
it's probably not as
intimidating as having a gun or...

86
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:36,054
bone claws or the
fingernails of a bag lady...

87
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,645
- Manicure?
- Victor... easy.

88
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:52,443
Fred got a new tattoo.
I'm concerned.

89
00:09:53,643 --> 00:09:56,140
Oh geez, Fred, you
just met her last night.

90
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,437
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

91
00:09:59,437 --> 00:10:02,037
She's a gymnast.

92
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,534
Bradley, take her down.

93
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,129
Are you gonna puke?

94
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,427
If we were meant to fly,
we'd have grown wings.

95
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:16,625
Oh, don't worry man. See, more
people die driving than flying.

96
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:17,825
How about from impaling?

97
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,721
Hey, be nice.
Or be your approximation of nice.

98
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,620
Would you like a bucket?

99
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,717
Gentlemen, wheels
down in Lagos in five.

100
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:07,389
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero...

101
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:14,783
<i>Intruder !</i>

102
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:17,780
<i>Man your weapons !</i>

103
00:11:49,857 --> 00:11:53,654
Having fun yet?

104
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:01,649
- Fred...
- The tank?

105
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,947
- Tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

106
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:40,620
Great!

107
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,618
Stuck in an elevator with five
guys on a high protein diet.

108
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:45,417
- Oh Wade!
- Dreams really do come true.

109
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,415
Would you just shut it!
You're up next.

110
00:12:47,715 --> 00:12:49,713
Thank you, sir.
You look very nice today.

111
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:50,712
It's the green.

112
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:52,412
Brings out the seriousness
in your eyes.

113
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:54,411
Oh my God, do you
ever shut up, pal?

114
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,209
No, not when I'm awake.

115
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,005
Bradley? Top floor, please.

116
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,899
Cover the elevator!
The elevator!

117
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,289
Time to go to work.

118
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,062
Okay!

119
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,360
People are dead!

120
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,457
If you haven't that
mouth on you, Wade...

121
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:08,057
you'd be the perfect soldier.

122
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,350
I wouldn't do that if I were you, brother.

123
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:23,544
Take the diamonds, they're yours.

124
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,043
I don't want your diamonds.

125
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:27,642
I want this.

126
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:32,038
That? That is nothing. A souvenir.

127
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,636
Where did you find it?
I want the source.

128
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:41,731
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

129
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,327
Tell him that this rock is more
valuable to me than his life.

130
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,726
Ask him where he found it.

131
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,615
He says it came from the sky.

132
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:10,311
He's telling the truth.

133
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,610
You don't know
their language, Logan.

134
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:14,207
It's a meteor fragment.

135
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,706
I know what it is.

136
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:17,306
I'm asking him
where he found it.

137
00:15:17,806 --> 00:15:20,203
Sir, base wants to
know our location.

138
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,302
Shut him down.

139
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,899
Tell him everyone here will die...

140
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,697
unless he tells me where
he found the rock.

141
00:15:39,789 --> 00:15:43,287
- He said that is sacred.
- Okay, fine.

142
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,482
Victor...

143
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,769
Victor!

144
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,765
Don't even think about it!

145
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,063
We didn't sign up for this.

146
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,558
Put him down.

147
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,448
What are you doing?

148
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:37,547
We finally got a good
thing going here.

149
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,946
Don't you screw this up.

150
00:16:38,946 --> 00:16:40,544
Enough, it's enough.
We've done enough.

151
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,844
Who do you think you are?

152
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,442
This is what we do.

153
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,940
Maybe you'd rather be rotting
in a hole somewhere

154
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,937
till they figure out a way
to do it to us, is that it?

155
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:51,138
Uh?

156
00:16:52,336 --> 00:16:53,934
I'm done.

157
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,731
You coming?

158
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,126
Jimmy!

159
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,622
We can't just let
you walk away!

160
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:23,614
Jimmy!

161
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,911
Jimmy!

162
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:19,073
Why are you up so early?

163
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:23,369
Come here.

164
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,240
See you baby.

165
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:05,538
Hey.

166
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:14,232
Oh, that's nice! Yeah!

167
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:42,912
No. Come on.

168
00:20:01,998 --> 00:20:03,797
Hey, what do you do?

169
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:07,993
You turn off the light,
you win a prize.

170
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,391
- Two tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it!

171
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,683
Um, that's obvious.

172
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,480
That's two.

173
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:39,171
- That's a stupid trick.
- It's not a trick, man.

174
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,368
C'mon.
Freak !

175
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:44,666
Bye!

176
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:15,144
Show's over!

177
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:22,838
I said, show's over!

178
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:30,432
The show is never
over for us, Bradley.

179
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:35,630
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

180
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:39,925
Yeah, come on in.

181
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:53,615
You know, I've never
said anything...

182
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:57,114
to anyone...about what happened.

183
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:00,510
I'm living a totally different life now,
but uh...

184
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,809
No need to bring up the past.

185
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:20,196
You know,

186
00:22:20,497 --> 00:22:24,294
I always thought it would be Wade
coming knocking at my door.

187
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:30,489
Well, Wade's gone.

188
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,984
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

189
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,082
I'm not afraid to die.

190
00:22:42,381 --> 00:22:47,376
How do you know?
You've never tried it before.

191
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:07,561
Was it the wars?

192
00:23:08,061 --> 00:23:12,159
- Which one?
- All of 'em.

193
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:22,051
Tell me.

194
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,548
It's just a scratch.

195
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,342
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

196
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:37,040
Yeah...

197
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,921
Who the hell is this?

198
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:06,119
It smells like government.

199
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:12,515
My God!
Haven't aged a day!

200
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:14,314
Clean living.

201
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:16,112
You remember Agent Zero.

202
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:18,809
Still shooting first and
asking questions later?

203
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:22,607
You still chewing
those cheap cigars?

204
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:27,104
Boys, please.
I have a job for you.

205
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,501
- I already have a job.
- Lumberjack.

206
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,901
- Eighteen grand a year?
- Eighteen five.

207
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:34,199
Plus I haven't had
to kill anyone in a while.

208
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:36,396
- Start to miss it?
- Yeah, right now I am.

209
00:24:36,396 --> 00:24:39,295
Zero, back to the car.

210
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,291
Attaboy.

211
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,184
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

212
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:55,084
Conversation's over.

213
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,480
Play the little house
on the prairie with a...

214
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:59,680
a school teacher.

215
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:01,878
That's just isn't you, Logan.

216
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:03,678
And you would know, huh?

217
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:05,576
I would.

218
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:07,275
What do you want, Stryker?

219
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:11,172
Bradley was killed
three days ago.

220
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,368
Wade, before that.

221
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:18,567
I believe that someone is
hunting down our old team.

222
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,265
Anyone else?

223
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:24,063
As far as I know,
Victor is safe.

224
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:29,958
- Whoever it is, he's had names, addresses...
- I can take care of myself.

225
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:34,154
This is not about you, Logan.

226
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:39,951
Your country needs you.

227
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,449
I'm Canadian.

228
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:46,546
I know you, Logan!
I know who you are!

229
00:26:24,118 --> 00:26:26,116
What's wrong?

230
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:29,515
Stryker came by today.

231
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:32,413
Don't worry, I said no.

232
00:26:32,413 --> 00:26:35,310
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

233
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:38,107
Because I'm the best
there is at what I do.

234
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,207
And what I do best
isn't very nice.

235
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:43,305
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

236
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:44,203
A gift?

237
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,402
You can return a gift.

238
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,590
Come on, fellas!

239
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:08,685
- Stay in the car.
- I'm just gonna ask nicely.

240
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:15,080
Mind lettin' us go by?

241
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,880
You're in some kind
of a hurry there, pal?

242
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:17,979
Are ya?

243
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,178
Just move your truck
so we can go by...

244
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,175
Trying to have a
conversation there, right.

245
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:23,474
If you start something...

246
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:25,273
you'd better be
ready to finish it.

247
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:27,272
Hey guys, take it easy!

248
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:29,770
Calm down.

249
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:34,767
Your boyfriend's
got a big mouth.

250
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:35,665
I know.

251
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:40,663
Big temper too,
so please, let us pass.

252
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:46,459
Thank you!

253
00:27:49,455 --> 00:27:50,855
How did you do that?

254
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:53,853
You know, power of
persuasion is a gift.

255
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:57,451
I see, do you... uh, have
those powers over me?

256
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,948
Well, you didn't stay
in the car, did you?

257
00:28:17,635 --> 00:28:19,834
Why is the moon so lonely?

258
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,432
Why?

259
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:25,130
Because she used
to have a lover.

260
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,528
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

261
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:30,027
His name was Kuekuatsheu...

262
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:31,825
and they lived in the
spirit world together.

263
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:34,023
- Ah, it's a true story.
- Right.

264
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:38,421
And every night, they would
wander the skies together.

265
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:43,517
But... one of the other
spirits was jealous.

266
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:47,114
Trickster, one of the
moons from South,

267
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:51,211
so he told Kuekuatsheu that
the moon had asked for flowers.

268
00:28:51,611 --> 00:28:53,309
He told him to come
to our world...

269
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:55,307
and pick up some wild roses...

270
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:57,106
But Kuekuatsheu didn't know...

271
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:59,404
that once you leave
the spirit world...

272
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,002
you can never go back.

273
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:05,800
And every night,
he looks up in the sky...

274
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,198
and sees the moon
and howls her name.

275
00:29:12,596 --> 00:29:13,394
But...

276
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,592
...he can never touch her again.

277
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,886
Koo-koo-Kachooka
got screwed.

278
00:29:25,185 --> 00:29:27,184
Kuekuatsheu.

279
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:37,278
Means the Wolverine.

280
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,633
What you're doing, Logan?

281
00:31:33,593 --> 00:31:35,490
Kayla!

282
00:32:38,944 --> 00:32:41,643
You're not from
around here, are you?

283
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:48,238
What gave me away?

284
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:54,432
You got insurance
on this place?

285
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:56,031
Insurance?

286
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:57,330
No.

287
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:00,229
Too bad.

288
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:02,528
<i>Victor !</i>

289
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:18,816
Well, well, well...
Look what the cat dragged in.

290
00:33:19,015 --> 00:33:22,212
Guys, whatever this is,
take it outside.

291
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:34,403
- Why?
- Why?

292
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:44,197
You don't call,
you don't write.

293
00:33:44,197 --> 00:33:48,993
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

294
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,664
I hate to say it, Jimmy.

295
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:32,262
But, frankly, I'm a
little disappointed.

296
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,360
Stay down.

297
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:17,528
Tell me something, Jimmy,
was she worth it?

298
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,313
When are you
gonna figure it out?

299
00:35:39,913 --> 00:35:42,510
We're not like them.

300
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:47,007
I... am nothing like you.

301
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:49,106
Sure you are.

302
00:35:50,105 --> 00:35:53,603
You just don't know it yet.

303
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:09,090
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

304
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:13,887
What? Is this a joke?
The guy's fine.

305
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:15,487
Where is he?

306
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:16,186
I said where is he!

307
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:17,085
I don't know who he is.

308
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,282
I can help you.

309
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,277
Six years I've been here.

310
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:29,976
No one knew me and
then you show up.

311
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:33,373
- And the next day, she's dead!
- I tried to warn you.

312
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:35,072
Why don't you tell
me it was Victor?

313
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:36,471
I didn't know.

314
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:43,865
I swear on my son's life!
I didn't...

315
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,259
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

316
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:56,755
I had to lock him up.
He thought I'd betrayed him.

317
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,255
Went AWOL.

318
00:36:58,454 --> 00:37:01,052
He said he was
coming after all of us.

319
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,952
You didn't come to warn me.

320
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:04,849
You came to save
your own ass.

321
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,648
So what's your plan, captain?

322
00:37:07,648 --> 00:37:09,447
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't.

323
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:11,545
I'm gonna find him
and kill him.

324
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:15,443
I can give you the
tools to defeat him.

325
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:24,835
- So we can still save the others.
- You mean save yourself, right?

326
00:37:25,835 --> 00:37:28,032
I promise you two things:

327
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:31,231
You'll suffer more pain than
any other man can endure,

328
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,728
but you'll have your revenge.

329
00:37:35,927 --> 00:37:39,925
If I come with you,
I'm coming for blood.

330
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:44,121
No law, no code of conduct.

331
00:37:44,422 --> 00:37:48,518
You point me in the right direction
and you get the hell out of my way.

332
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,188
When it starts,

333
00:38:29,688 --> 00:38:32,885
whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

334
00:38:32,885 --> 00:38:36,083
focus on that.
Maybe it will help.

335
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,782
Trust me, I've been
through worse.

336
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:40,280
No, you haven't.

337
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:42,679
We're ready.

338
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:46,675
We're gonna make
you indestructible.

339
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:49,773
but first, we're gonna
have to destroy you.

340
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:56,268
Remember what we
were looking for in Africa?

341
00:38:56,268 --> 00:38:57,268
I remember.

342
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,168
Well, I found it.

343
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:04,563
It helped us create a...
metal compound so strong

344
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:07,561
that you will be able to
withstand virtually anything.

345
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:10,358
It's called Adamantium.

346
00:39:11,257 --> 00:39:14,356
I can't put Victor
down myself, Logan.

347
00:39:15,054 --> 00:39:20,052
To kill him, you're gonna have
to embrace the other side.

348
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,748
Become the animal.

349
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,146
Let's do this.

350
00:39:27,846 --> 00:39:29,244
I almost forgot.

351
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:34,641
I want new ones.

352
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:36,838
What do you want them to say?

353
00:39:38,438 --> 00:39:40,137
Wolverine.

354
00:39:57,623 --> 00:40:00,322
Generals!
Welcome.

355
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:02,320
General Munson.

356
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,617
Today, we're gonna
witness medical history.

357
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:10,114
- Today, we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

358
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:13,313
Roman numeral, Ten.

359
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:19,807
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

360
00:40:20,108 --> 00:40:21,806
Let's begin.

361
00:41:08,572 --> 00:41:10,371
<i>- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan!</i>

362
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,969
Body temperature is 1-0-8
and rising.

363
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:18,664
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

364
00:41:18,664 --> 00:41:20,364
He feels pain,
just like the rest of us.

365
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,262
Anaesthesia won't work on him.

366
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:24,161
That's why he had to volunteer.
- Heart rate 190.

367
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,259
195.

368
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:28,157
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

369
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:29,856
200.

370
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,353
<i>...son.</i>

371
00:41:34,652 --> 00:41:36,351
Heartbeat's well
beyond maximum.

372
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:38,849
- Blood pressure?
- 260 over 180 and rising.

373
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,347
He can make it,
he can make it.

374
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:47,344
<i>Victor!</i>

375
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:54,539
<i>I love you.</i>

376
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:56,637
<i>You're not an animal, Logan.</i>

377
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:04,231
<i>It means...
the Wolverine.</i>

378
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:33,110
Well, I guess he can die.

379
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:06,885
Come on, old friend.
Come back.

380
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:11,282
Heart rate rising.

381
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:15,280
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

382
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:18,876
No rejection.
Procedure completed.

383
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,376
We did it!

384
00:43:20,675 --> 00:43:21,675
We did it.

385
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,168
We take him to the island?

386
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:33,266
The island?
No.

387
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:35,664
The bonding works.

388
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,961
We use his DNA for the XI.

389
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:43,358
Erase his memory.

390
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,454
<i>Erase his memory.</i>

391
00:43:57,648 --> 00:43:59,447
I think he heard you.

392
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:16,835
Lockdown!

393
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:56,905
Hunt him down.
Take his head off.

394
00:45:38,275 --> 00:45:39,873
Travis!

395
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:51,166
I think there is a
naked man in the barn.

396
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,164
Yep.

397
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,340
Son...

398
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,338
What in hell are you doing?

399
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:32,135
- It's cold.
- Cold?

400
00:46:35,432 --> 00:46:40,230
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

401
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,327
You're not onto
drugs, are you?

402
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:43,527
No.

403
00:46:44,925 --> 00:46:46,324
You just had a rough night.

404
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,623
Yeah, you could say that.

405
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:53,420
Come on up the house.

406
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,918
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

407
00:46:57,817 --> 00:47:00,215
Here, cover it up with that.

408
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:03,612
I don't want to give an old lady
a heart attack.

409
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:50,777
You're alright in there?

410
00:47:50,777 --> 00:47:52,376
Yeah, I'm fine.

411
00:47:53,876 --> 00:47:55,175
Supper's on the table.

412
00:47:55,574 --> 00:47:57,972
I... Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

413
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:11,663
I swear I'm gonna pay for it.

414
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:15,260
Set it down over there.

415
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,054
Come and sit down, son.

416
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:30,949
I can't thank you both
enough... for everything.

417
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,746
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

418
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:37,143
- Decent...
- What?

419
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:41,240
Um... Nothing, I'm just not
really used to that word.

420
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:45,438
That's a nice chopper
you've got out there.

421
00:48:45,637 --> 00:48:46,936
You know motorcycle?

422
00:48:46,936 --> 00:48:48,835
Oh Lord, here we go!

423
00:48:48,835 --> 00:48:50,135
My favorite is a '48 Panhead.

424
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,434
I bought one new off the line.

425
00:48:51,434 --> 00:48:54,231
I think you're a little young
for that, son.

426
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,429
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

427
00:48:57,429 --> 00:48:59,327
In the barn.

428
00:49:00,128 --> 00:49:02,425
Nothing you can
break out there.

429
00:49:18,213 --> 00:49:21,211
<i>- Why is the moon so lonely?
- Why?</i>

430
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,309
<i>Because she
used to have a lover.</i>

431
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:30,005
<i>He can never touch her again.</i>

432
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:50,190
You sleep ok?

433
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:53,788
Uh...yeah.

434
00:49:55,987 --> 00:50:00,184
You look like a man fixing
to do a bad thing.

435
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:05,380
You know what happens
to many looking for blood?

436
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,577
- What?
- They find it.

437
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:15,871
- We all got a choice, son.
- Yeah, mine got taken.

438
00:50:15,871 --> 00:50:17,871
Bullshit.

439
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:23,965
This was my son's jacket.

440
00:50:25,864 --> 00:50:27,463
Try it on.

441
00:50:43,152 --> 00:50:46,949
- Thank you.
- Yep...

442
00:50:47,748 --> 00:50:52,445
You wanna take my bike for a spin,
test the suspension.

443
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:55,742
'64, huh?

444
00:50:57,942 --> 00:50:59,041
Man, you're heavy.

445
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,739
Yeah, I put on a little
weight recently.

446
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:02,737
Good morning.

447
00:51:03,038 --> 00:51:03,836
Good morning.

448
00:51:07,235 --> 00:51:09,532
Oh, it fits you beautifully!

449
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,331
I brought you some...

450
00:51:21,423 --> 00:51:24,121
<i>Weapon X is in the barn.
He just murdered two civilians.</i>

451
00:51:24,121 --> 00:51:27,420
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

452
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:53,701
Come and get me!

453
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,889
Blow his brains all over the road.

454
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:09,588
Damn!

455
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,661
Alpha One, do not lose him!

456
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:58,153
<i>Alpha 2, target's
coming to you!</i>

457
00:53:49,615 --> 00:53:51,514
Pull up!

458
00:54:42,777 --> 00:54:43,775
<i>Zero?</i>

459
00:54:47,173 --> 00:54:48,273
<i>Zero, come in!</i>

460
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,969
<i>Zero!</i>

461
00:54:59,164 --> 00:55:00,364
<i>Zero, is Logan dead?</i>

462
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,063
I don't know, I'm down.

463
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:07,358
<i>Zero, is Logan dead?</i>

464
00:55:12,155 --> 00:55:13,954
<i>Zero, come in!</i>

465
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:20,150
<i>You tried to kill me.</i>

466
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,648
Logan?

467
00:55:21,648 --> 00:55:22,947
Where is Victor?

468
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:24,746
Come back to base.

469
00:55:24,945 --> 00:55:26,945
I'll explain everything, we'll
take Victor down together.

470
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:28,643
<i>Wrong answer.</i>

471
00:55:28,643 --> 00:55:31,342
After I've killed Victor,
I'm coming for you.

472
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:36,137
<i>Logan, listen to me.</i>

473
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:38,735
If you go down this road, you're
not gonna like what you find.

474
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:42,233
You wanted the
animal, Colonel?

475
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:44,032
You got it.

476
00:55:48,528 --> 00:55:51,126
Those were good
people back there.

477
00:55:51,427 --> 00:55:53,525
Innocent people.

478
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:05,416
It's funny how good innocent
people tend to die around you.

479
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:29,898
Zero never stood a chance.

480
00:56:29,898 --> 00:56:33,795
The only thing that'll take him
down is an Adamantium bullet

481
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:44,088
This facility is compromised.
Prep transport.

482
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:54,981
Colonel, this is turning
into a disaster.

483
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,679
- Don't worry, we'll stop him.
- Really?

484
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:59,277
You've just spent
half a billion dollars...

485
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:00,976
making him indestructible.

486
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:05,072
- Sir?
- Yes.

487
00:57:05,373 --> 00:57:08,771
The young mutant you've
been looking for, we found him.

488
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:11,268
General, Logan isn't the
only piece in this puzzle.

489
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:13,367
I need to evacuate this facility.

490
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:15,965
Please, go back to Washington.

491
00:57:16,164 --> 00:57:17,463
We've got work to do.

492
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:24,259
Yo hablo: I talk, tu hablas:
you talk, el habla?

493
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:25,858
Somebody translate?

494
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:27,956
Summers?

495
00:57:28,255 --> 00:57:30,853
Sit up and take
off those glasses.

496
00:57:32,052 --> 00:57:34,251
I have a headache.

497
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:37,050
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

498
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,748
while you add up
this conjugation 100 times.

499
00:57:40,347 --> 00:57:41,246
Somebody else?

500
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:42,246
<i>He talks.</i>

501
00:57:42,246 --> 00:57:44,443
Thank you, he talks.
El habla.

502
00:57:55,936 --> 00:57:58,233
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

503
00:57:59,134 --> 00:58:00,432
Damn!

504
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:03,530
I'm sorry, mate.

505
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:08,226
What the hell happened
to him after I left?

506
00:58:08,226 --> 00:58:09,226
He got worse.

507
00:58:09,626 --> 00:58:11,525
He felt like you
abandoned him.

508
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:13,422
Hell, we all do.

509
00:58:13,422 --> 00:58:17,219
But Victor, he had to prove
you he was better than you.

510
00:58:17,219 --> 00:58:20,117
Hunting and killing everything's
he was pointin' at.

511
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:24,514
Quit a few months later myself,
couldn't take rounding them up.

512
00:58:25,514 --> 00:58:28,311
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

513
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:30,311
Rounding who up, John?

514
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,909
Hey! God damn it, John!

515
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,306
We hunted our
own kind, Logan.

516
00:58:35,507 --> 00:58:38,105
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

517
00:58:38,105 --> 00:58:39,005
Mutants?

518
00:58:40,503 --> 00:58:41,802
Why?

519
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:44,599
Stryker'd say we would
be making a difference.

520
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,597
Protecting people
from the bad ones.

521
00:58:55,492 --> 00:58:57,990
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

522
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,088
Remember that stuff in Africa?

523
00:59:00,289 --> 00:59:02,188
Yeah, I remember Africa,
what about it?

524
00:59:06,385 --> 00:59:07,684
Damn!

525
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,681
What'd they do to you?

526
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,679
Don't ask.

527
00:59:15,277 --> 00:59:16,777
Listen, Zero said
something about an island.

528
00:59:16,976 --> 00:59:18,576
Does that mean
anything to you?

529
00:59:18,576 --> 00:59:19,675
Nope.

530
00:59:19,675 --> 00:59:21,273
But maybe Dukes knows.

531
00:59:21,273 --> 00:59:23,472
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes?

532
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:24,771
- Where is he?
- He's here.

533
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:26,769
- Well, let's go talk to him.
- Hold on.

534
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:28,668
He don't get in
until around four.

535
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:29,867
But I gotta warn you...

536
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,965
he developed a bit
of eating disorder.

537
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:33,664
We all got our
coping mechanisms.

538
00:59:33,864 --> 00:59:35,663
I'm trying to whoop
him back into shape.

539
00:59:37,061 --> 00:59:38,360
Whatever you do, don't mention his weight.

540
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,458
Come on, Fred, if you want to get
into shape, you gotta move, man.

541
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:43,657
I told him he got to move.

542
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,452
Fred Dukes? Trapped inside
that creature? That ain't Fred Dukes.

543
00:59:51,452 --> 00:59:53,750
Hey, be nice.

544
00:59:55,148 --> 00:59:57,347
Hey, Fat, Fred, um.

545
00:59:58,047 --> 01:00:00,945
See, I remember that girl
when she's got 85 pounds, huh.

546
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:06,041
Oh that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

547
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:08,739
You know where Victor is?

548
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:09,838
No idea.

549
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:12,036
What's the island, slim?

550
01:00:13,934 --> 01:00:16,233
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

551
01:00:16,532 --> 01:00:18,431
Listen, I ain't gonna leave
until you tell me where Victor is.

552
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:20,630
Come on, Bob.
For old times' sake, huh?

553
01:00:22,929 --> 01:00:24,228
Did you just call me...

554
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:27,126
Blob?

555
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,922
No, but...

556
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:36,818
I told you not to
mention his weight.

557
01:00:37,117 --> 01:00:38,416
Why did you call him Blob?

558
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:41,014
I didn't call him Blob,
I said Bob!

559
01:00:41,014 --> 01:00:42,813
Goddamn it!

560
01:00:43,213 --> 01:00:44,612
I got an idea.

561
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:48,710
- This is your idea of an idea?
- Trying to help you out, Logan.

562
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,608
Dukes don't like you that much,
and you know it.

563
01:00:50,608 --> 01:00:51,907
The feeling is mutual.

564
01:00:51,907 --> 01:00:54,405
Use those gloves, man,
dance with him a little bit.

565
01:00:54,405 --> 01:00:56,603
Allow him to let his
anger out on you.

566
01:00:57,103 --> 01:00:58,003
I figure if you do that...

567
01:00:58,202 --> 01:01:00,001
he might tell you everything
you wanna know.

568
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:02,000
Come on, man, look at him.

569
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,498
Big old ass comin' out of
the front of his shirt.

570
01:01:04,797 --> 01:01:07,096
Jesus, he's gonna have a
coronary for Christ's sake.

571
01:01:07,295 --> 01:01:08,295
Is there even a
stretcher big enough...

572
01:01:08,494 --> 01:01:10,094
to take this guy out of here?

573
01:01:11,893 --> 01:01:14,090
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out on a stretcher.

574
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,590
- You're an asshole.
- Come on, Logan.

575
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:19,686
Whoop his ass!

576
01:01:19,686 --> 01:01:21,985
- If you want.
- Dance with him Fred.

577
01:01:23,085 --> 01:01:25,282
What's that suppose to do?
You wanna dance with me?

578
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,181
Oh. Oh, that feels good.

579
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:32,976
Hey, guess what?

580
01:01:34,177 --> 01:01:35,275
See, he's gonna talk, man.

581
01:01:35,476 --> 01:01:36,675
You got him right
where you want him.

582
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:38,273
Whose side are
you on anyway?

583
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:41,271
Come on now, lambchop.

584
01:02:13,447 --> 01:02:15,445
Now, where is Victor?

585
01:02:46,224 --> 01:02:49,021
A little dark for sunglasses,
don't you think?

586
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:07,608
Please don't! Please!
Don't, please!

587
01:03:07,608 --> 01:03:09,306
Victor!

588
01:03:13,903 --> 01:03:15,601
Hey! Where's Victor?

589
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:21,597
Victor's... with Stryker
on... on the island...

590
01:03:21,797 --> 01:03:24,295
they... they run it together.

591
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,393
What... what?

592
01:03:27,393 --> 01:03:29,492
Victor's been with Stryker?

593
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:30,990
Yeah.

594
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,690
You didn't know that?

595
01:03:53,474 --> 01:03:55,472
All that's left
now is Logan, I...

596
01:03:55,472 --> 01:03:58,670
...trust you can handle that.

597
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,068
I did before, didn't I?

598
01:04:01,068 --> 01:04:03,467
Oh yes, you did that.

599
01:04:06,065 --> 01:04:10,461
Our deal... it still applies, right?

600
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,860
Of course.

601
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,659
Now pack him
and tag him, Captain.

602
01:04:23,753 --> 01:04:25,851
What's the island?

603
01:04:25,851 --> 01:04:30,947
It's where... Striker takes
them after Victor's caught 'em.

604
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:34,344
Wait, wait... um, what?
Takes who?

605
01:04:35,443 --> 01:04:37,342
Mutants.

606
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:42,438
The rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

607
01:04:44,737 --> 01:04:47,036
Well, you never wondered
what happened to them?

608
01:04:47,036 --> 01:04:49,434
I tried not to.

609
01:05:05,222 --> 01:05:05,822
They killed her...

610
01:05:06,021 --> 01:05:10,018
so I'd let them put
Adamantium in me.

611
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:14,614
They killed her for a
goddamn experiment.

612
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:20,710
Where is it?

613
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:23,608
Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

614
01:05:27,606 --> 01:05:28,304
But...

615
01:05:30,403 --> 01:05:32,902
- A prisoner escaped there once.
- Who?

616
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:34,001
His name is Remy LeBeau.

617
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:36,300
He was a street hustler
from New Orleans.

618
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,597
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

619
01:05:39,597 --> 01:05:40,996
because he kept taking
all their money at poker...

620
01:05:41,195 --> 01:05:41,894
that's all I know.

621
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:44,494
What's Stryker up to Fred,
what's the end game?

622
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:51,088
He's taking their powers,
trying to combine them somehow.

623
01:05:51,487 --> 01:05:53,887
It's all I know, Logan.
It's all I know.

624
01:05:55,186 --> 01:05:58,282
If I had to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

625
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:04,079
I'm coming with you, Logan.

626
01:06:06,077 --> 01:06:08,675
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

627
01:06:46,447 --> 01:06:48,047
There's our dude.

628
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:56,240
That's cool.

629
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,938
But I'm going to go
and cover the back if he runs.

630
01:06:58,938 --> 01:07:00,237
I'm not havin'
a fight with him.

631
01:07:00,237 --> 01:07:01,936
- Yeah right.
- What?

632
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:03,335
I am havin' fights
with everybody?

633
01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:05,434
Don't dogs kill cats?

634
01:07:05,434 --> 01:07:07,532
Just go cover the back, will ya?

635
01:07:19,923 --> 01:07:22,722
Are you Remy LeBeau?

636
01:07:24,021 --> 01:07:25,619
Do I owe you money?

637
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:27,119
No.

638
01:07:28,117 --> 01:07:30,215
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

639
01:07:48,503 --> 01:07:51,501
Large blind is 100,
and the small blind's 50.

640
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,298
May I deal you in?

641
01:07:54,298 --> 01:07:56,496
Now what can I
get for 17 bucks?

642
01:07:57,496 --> 01:07:59,494
17 dollars?

643
01:08:00,193 --> 01:08:02,193
A cab ride home, perhaps.

644
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:09,188
You're my brother's
new babysitter, John?

645
01:08:10,387 --> 01:08:12,186
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

646
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:14,083
And your creepy black
coat don't scare me.

647
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:15,583
Really?

648
01:08:15,882 --> 01:08:17,082
It worked on Dukes.

649
01:08:17,881 --> 01:08:19,880
Shouldn't had done that, 'cause
now I'm gonna kill you...

650
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:21,479
before Logan gets the chance.

651
01:08:22,578 --> 01:08:25,275
So what brings you
to our fair city, sir?

652
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:27,375
Victor Creed.

653
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:30,771
And who's that?

654
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,770
The man I'm gonna kill.

655
01:08:35,168 --> 01:08:38,466
He works for a man named
Stryker on, uh, on an island.

656
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,762
- I just need to know where it is.
- Why would you think I know that?

657
01:08:43,063 --> 01:08:45,360
Well, 'cause I know
who you are, Gambit.

658
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,359
You are the guy who escaped...

659
01:08:48,559 --> 01:08:51,157
and you are the guy who's
gonna take me back there.

660
01:08:53,055 --> 01:08:54,755
You know, John...

661
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,853
There's something I always
wanted to tell you.

662
01:09:02,349 --> 01:09:04,846
You're predictable.

663
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:11,143
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

664
01:09:11,942 --> 01:09:15,039
That's funny.
I never knew you had one.

665
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:22,034
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

666
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:26,231
The men who took me
wore tags just like 'em.

667
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:31,726
Hey, now Bob, you listen to me...

668
01:10:05,203 --> 01:10:06,801
Two years I was
rottin' in that hell...

669
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:09,199
and I'm never going back.

670
01:10:11,898 --> 01:10:14,496
Oh, shiny.

671
01:10:16,694 --> 01:10:18,693
Tell me something, Jimmy.

672
01:10:19,493 --> 01:10:21,690
Do you even know
how to kill me?

673
01:10:21,690 --> 01:10:24,288
I'm gonna cut your
goddamn head off.

674
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:27,186
See if that works.

675
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,479
You're gettin' slow, old man.

676
01:10:47,971 --> 01:10:50,270
Son of a bitch.

677
01:10:53,768 --> 01:10:56,365
You're gonna die for
what you did to her.

678
01:11:20,648 --> 01:11:22,046
Victor!

679
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,637
That's a nice stick.

680
01:12:32,694 --> 01:12:34,694
Shithead.
Here's the deal.

681
01:12:34,894 --> 01:12:37,091
See, you're gonna take me to this
island, where I can kill Creed,

682
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:39,989
Stryker, pretty much everyone
you hate in this world.

683
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,889
Do you understand?

684
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:44,587
You really gonna kill 'em.

685
01:12:44,587 --> 01:12:47,085
As long as you stay
out of my way, yeah.

686
01:13:01,274 --> 01:13:02,472
Colonel.

687
01:13:03,573 --> 01:13:04,671
General?

688
01:13:04,671 --> 01:13:07,170
Is this Weapon XI?

689
01:13:08,368 --> 01:13:11,567
All their strenghts but
none of their weaknesses.

690
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:13,664
You really hate them, don't you?

691
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:15,564
No, I don't hate them.

692
01:13:15,963 --> 01:13:17,363
After 20 years of
working with them...

693
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,360
I just know what they can do.

694
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:25,356
If we win this war
before it starts...

695
01:13:25,556 --> 01:13:28,055
it'll save countless
lives in the process.

696
01:13:28,055 --> 01:13:31,252
Preemptive action is
the only action here, General.

697
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:35,948
The days of our country sitting
on the sidelines are over.

698
01:13:36,548 --> 01:13:38,247
We need to take the
fight to the enemy...

699
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,046
before they take
the fight to us.

700
01:13:40,645 --> 01:13:43,542
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

701
01:13:44,342 --> 01:13:47,140
But this is as far as it goes.

702
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,639
Weapon X was a... a hickup.

703
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:51,537
We know about your son, Bill.

704
01:13:51,537 --> 01:13:53,336
We know he's a mutant.

705
01:13:53,336 --> 01:13:54,935
And we know
he killed your wife.

706
01:13:55,135 --> 01:13:56,533
You shouldn't have
kept that from us.

707
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:58,132
That...

708
01:13:59,832 --> 01:14:01,729
That has nothing
to do with my work.

709
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:02,828
Bullshit.

710
01:14:03,128 --> 01:14:06,527
You're too close to this.
I'm sure you know it.

711
01:14:08,925 --> 01:14:12,322
You're right.
I...I won't lie to you.

712
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:20,317
My son did bring the
problem home for me.

713
01:14:20,716 --> 01:14:23,314
But I took an oath...

714
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:26,811
to protect the American people

715
01:14:27,112 --> 01:14:29,310
from every threat,

716
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:31,309
both foreign

717
01:14:38,302 --> 01:14:39,902
...and domestic.

718
01:14:47,796 --> 01:14:49,795
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

719
01:14:49,795 --> 01:14:51,194
Just concentrate on
what you're doing.

720
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:52,993
You sure? You got a bit of
sweat on your brow there.

721
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:54,690
Very funny, just keep
your eyes on the...

722
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,189
On the what? Clouds?

723
01:14:56,489 --> 01:14:58,787
We're jumpin' up and down
like a freakin' yoyo here.

724
01:14:58,787 --> 01:14:59,887
Where did you get
this thing anyway?

725
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:02,286
Oh, this is my baby,
I won her in a game.

726
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:05,384
- Jacks over fives.
- Great.

727
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:09,081
Relax. We're almost there.

728
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:13,877
There it is. The island.

729
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:17,574
Three Mile Island.
Hiding in plain sight.

730
01:15:20,573 --> 01:15:23,171
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

731
01:15:23,171 --> 01:15:25,769
They think it's gonna
turn them into freaks.

732
01:15:25,769 --> 01:15:26,967
Like you?

733
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:28,766
Right.

734
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:31,963
All right, you ready?

735
01:15:31,963 --> 01:15:33,563
Because it's now or never.
Let's go.

736
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:34,962
About time.

737
01:15:44,154 --> 01:15:45,753
Hey, if it's make you
feel any better...

738
01:15:46,054 --> 01:15:47,252
this is really gonna hurt.

739
01:15:47,252 --> 01:15:50,949
Well yeah, it kind
of does actually.

740
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:52,948
Good luck.

741
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,046
Likewise.

742
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,345
Oh shit.

743
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:06,439
How are you doing?

744
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:08,438
Is everything alright?

745
01:16:09,436 --> 01:16:11,935
- Is he ready yet?
- A few more hours.

746
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,332
And he will respond
to my commands?

747
01:16:14,332 --> 01:16:16,332
Absolutely!

748
01:17:18,786 --> 01:17:19,984
Logan.

749
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:23,082
Welcome back to the war.

750
01:17:24,481 --> 01:17:27,779
Before I gut you,
I wanna know why.

751
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:31,277
I needed your powers
for the pool.

752
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:33,076
For the what?

753
01:17:33,076 --> 01:17:36,372
A mutant killer.
The dead pool.

754
01:17:37,172 --> 01:17:39,470
Years of searching,
to find...

755
01:17:39,671 --> 01:17:40,970
finding the right powers...

756
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:45,765
that can coexist in one body
without ripping it apart.

757
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:50,662
My son was the first
piece of the puzzle.

758
01:17:51,462 --> 01:17:53,461
Logan, you were the last.

759
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,658
You made Weapon XI possible.

760
01:17:57,158 --> 01:17:57,957
I...

761
01:17:58,457 --> 01:17:59,756
I asked you to help but...

762
01:18:00,155 --> 01:18:04,252
you said you wanted
the quiet life.

763
01:18:04,552 --> 01:18:05,351
Well...

764
01:18:06,451 --> 01:18:08,449
I've learned that
nothing motivates...

765
01:18:08,649 --> 01:18:12,247
the men in your
family like revenge.

766
01:18:28,835 --> 01:18:30,533
Who are you?

767
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,930
Oh she's a real old friend.

768
01:18:45,422 --> 01:18:47,520
Do you really think we'd
just let you walk away?

769
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,219
You are a dangerous man.

770
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:54,115
I like to keep an eye
on dangerous men.

771
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:56,515
Tell him about the
day you died.

772
01:19:02,609 --> 01:19:05,807
They gave me a shot of
hydrochloride thiazide.

773
01:19:07,905 --> 01:19:10,005
<i>It reduces the heart rate so low...</i>

774
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:11,804
<i>it appears you flatline.</i>

775
01:19:23,494 --> 01:19:25,993
Don't be angry with her.

776
01:19:26,493 --> 01:19:29,890
Real credit... to your species.

777
01:19:32,587 --> 01:19:34,186
Did you know that her sister...

778
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:36,685
has diamond-hard skin?

779
01:19:36,685 --> 01:19:40,283
Kayla's mutation
is tacto-hypnosis.

780
01:19:40,283 --> 01:19:43,280
She can influence people as
long as she touches them.

781
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,078
Quite a useful tool
in the seduction.

782
01:19:46,278 --> 01:19:48,876
It was never real, my friend.

783
01:19:53,672 --> 01:19:55,871
It was real for me.

784
01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:59,168
I told you if you
came down this road...

785
01:19:59,368 --> 01:20:00,967
you wouldn't like
what you'd found.

786
01:20:08,362 --> 01:20:10,461
That story you told me...

787
01:20:10,461 --> 01:20:13,957
about man who gets
flowers for the moon...

788
01:20:15,157 --> 01:20:18,055
I had it backwards.

789
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:23,650
I thought you were the moon
and I was your Wolverine.

790
01:20:25,849 --> 01:20:29,046
But you were the
Trickster, aren't you?

791
01:20:29,247 --> 01:20:31,744
I am just the fool that got played.

792
01:20:33,743 --> 01:20:37,240
The worst part of this is
I should have known.

793
01:20:39,838 --> 01:20:42,436
But I ignored my instincts.

794
01:20:45,335 --> 01:20:48,332
I ignored what I really am.

795
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:55,528
Well, that will never happen again.

796
01:21:26,505 --> 01:21:28,604
- Colonel.
- Not now, Kayla.

797
01:21:28,604 --> 01:21:31,501
I have done everything
you've asked.

798
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,599
My sister...

799
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:37,497
You said that if I help you,
you'd let her go.

800
01:21:38,096 --> 01:21:40,095
Kayla, it's not
as simple as that.

801
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:42,993
Her mutation is unique.
Quite beautiful.

802
01:21:42,993 --> 01:21:45,291
We just need a little more
time to analyze it, that's all.

803
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:46,390
You let him go?

804
01:21:50,188 --> 01:21:52,586
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

805
01:21:52,586 --> 01:21:55,083
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Give me the Adamantium.

806
01:21:55,083 --> 01:21:56,283
- Tests came out...
- We had a deal!

807
01:21:56,283 --> 01:21:58,582
You would never
survive the operation.

808
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:02,378
I can take anything he can.

809
01:22:02,578 --> 01:22:04,177
No, you can't.

810
01:22:05,277 --> 01:22:06,676
You are my
favorite soldier, Victor.

811
01:22:07,274 --> 01:22:08,873
Be patient, time will come.

812
01:22:09,173 --> 01:22:10,273
He's using us!

813
01:22:19,365 --> 01:22:23,662
How about this time,
you die for real?

814
01:22:24,363 --> 01:22:25,561
Let me go.

815
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:30,858
Your little mind game
don't work on me.

816
01:22:31,358 --> 01:22:32,556
Victor!

817
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,729
Feels good, doesn't it?

818
01:23:09,929 --> 01:23:12,127
All that rage...

819
01:23:13,327 --> 01:23:14,926
Do it.

820
01:23:14,926 --> 01:23:16,524
Logan!

821
01:23:17,623 --> 01:23:18,722
You're not an animal.

822
01:23:19,822 --> 01:23:21,720
Oh yes, you are.

823
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:26,417
Do it.

824
01:23:30,414 --> 01:23:32,613
Finish it.

825
01:23:56,694 --> 01:23:57,494
Logan?

826
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:02,990
My sister.

827
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:04,590
They have my sister.

828
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:08,386
Please, I didn't trick you
into loving me.

829
01:24:09,185 --> 01:24:10,685
It was real for me too.

830
01:24:13,983 --> 01:24:15,980
Please, I'm so sorry.

831
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:18,578
They have my sister.

832
01:24:18,979 --> 01:24:20,578
Where is she?

833
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,372
Activate Weapon XI.

834
01:24:27,573 --> 01:24:28,671
The bonding process
is incomplete.

835
01:24:28,671 --> 01:24:29,770
Just do it!

836
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:30,869
Now!

837
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:34,224
Are you okay?
Come on.

838
01:26:25,985 --> 01:26:27,284
Okay...

839
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:30,082
Perfect.

840
01:26:30,382 --> 01:26:31,881
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

841
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:34,380
Find another way out.

842
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:36,378
Come on, let's go!

843
01:26:37,377 --> 01:26:39,376
Wade, is that you?

844
01:26:42,974 --> 01:26:46,171
I guess Stryker finally figured
out how to shut you up.

845
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:57,762
Wade...

846
01:26:59,261 --> 01:27:00,761
You don't have to do this.

847
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:03,458
Alright, maybe you do.

848
01:27:18,547 --> 01:27:19,346
Shoot on sight!

849
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:29,439
I can help! Point me at 'em!

850
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,738
Go!

851
01:27:39,233 --> 01:27:40,431
Go! Now!

852
01:27:47,226 --> 01:27:48,725
Did I get them?

853
01:27:48,725 --> 01:27:49,925
Yeah.

854
01:27:59,818 --> 01:28:00,917
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

855
01:28:00,917 --> 01:28:02,216
Kayla, come on!

856
01:28:02,216 --> 01:28:03,614
I have to stay here.

857
01:28:04,314 --> 01:28:06,212
You take them.

858
01:28:06,613 --> 01:28:07,412
Go!

859
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:09,411
Go!

860
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:38,289
<i>Go left.</i>

861
01:28:38,588 --> 01:28:39,389
Left.

862
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:42,485
- What?
- We go left.

863
01:28:42,485 --> 01:28:44,585
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

864
01:28:58,574 --> 01:29:00,672
C'mon Bob! Let's see
your dance up here.

865
01:29:37,746 --> 01:29:39,345
Nobody kills you but me.

866
01:29:48,637 --> 01:29:49,636
Back-to-back!

867
01:29:52,435 --> 01:29:53,934
- I got him!
- Oh no, you don't.

868
01:31:29,564 --> 01:31:30,363
Stop!

869
01:31:30,962 --> 01:31:32,462
- This can't be the way.
- This is the way!

870
01:31:32,462 --> 01:31:34,161
- How do you know?
- I just know.

871
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,359
Come on.

872
01:31:46,752 --> 01:31:47,751
Adamantium bullets.

873
01:31:49,149 --> 01:31:52,448
Let's see him heal with a few
of these through his thick skull.

874
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:55,046
You can't stop him.
Even with that.

875
01:31:55,046 --> 01:31:56,345
He'll heal.

876
01:31:56,345 --> 01:31:58,643
His brain may heal.

877
01:31:59,942 --> 01:32:02,739
But his memories
won't grow back.

878
01:32:18,927 --> 01:32:22,025
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

879
01:32:23,425 --> 01:32:24,823
We're done.

880
01:32:24,823 --> 01:32:27,421
We can never
be done, Jimmy.

881
01:32:27,421 --> 01:32:29,421
We're brothers.

882
01:32:29,421 --> 01:32:32,019
Brothers look out for each other.

883
01:33:05,394 --> 01:33:07,193
- You miss me?
- Jesus...

884
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:10,989
You know, when you said you
were gonna kill everyone...

885
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:13,688
I thought you may just've
been exaggerating.

886
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:14,987
Yeah...

887
01:33:16,386 --> 01:33:18,185
Do I look like a man
who exaggerates?

888
01:33:18,685 --> 01:33:19,684
You're welcome.

889
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,779
<i>Logan.</i>

890
01:33:28,377 --> 01:33:29,775
These kids trying
to get off the island.

891
01:33:29,775 --> 01:33:31,274
- Split up. Go!
- I'm on it.

892
01:33:40,569 --> 01:33:41,568
Kayla!

893
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:43,666
Kayla!

894
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:54,757
I love you.

895
01:34:02,252 --> 01:34:03,252
No...

896
01:34:06,748 --> 01:34:08,247
I'm so cold.

897
01:34:08,247 --> 01:34:11,246
Listen to me, I'm gonna
get you outta here.

898
01:34:11,246 --> 01:34:12,244
You understand?

899
01:34:13,244 --> 01:34:14,344
Let's go easy,
nice and easy.

900
01:34:14,743 --> 01:34:15,542
That's it.

901
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:16,442
That's it.

902
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,639
I'm gonna get you out.

903
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:46,320
Logan!

904
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,479
I should make you
pull the trigger.

905
01:35:45,176 --> 01:35:47,376
But that would make
us no better than you.

906
01:35:49,175 --> 01:35:50,972
Throw the gun away.

907
01:35:56,269 --> 01:35:57,768
Turn around.
Walk until your feet bleed.

908
01:35:59,466 --> 01:36:01,065
And then keep walking.

909
01:36:39,037 --> 01:36:41,336
<i>It'll be all right, Scott.</i>

910
01:36:41,336 --> 01:36:43,635
<i>My name is Charles Xavier.</i>

911
01:36:43,635 --> 01:36:45,932
<i>I'm a mutant, like you.</i>

912
01:36:45,932 --> 01:36:50,529
<i>- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes. And I can hear yours.</i>

913
01:36:50,729 --> 01:36:52,927
You're safe now.

914
01:36:52,927 --> 01:36:55,225
<i>Come. We have to go.</i>

915
01:37:44,489 --> 01:37:45,289
The kids are safe.

916
01:37:51,185 --> 01:37:52,385
What the hell happened?

917
01:37:55,981 --> 01:37:58,979
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

918
01:37:59,378 --> 01:38:01,578
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now we gotta go.

919
01:38:02,976 --> 01:38:05,074
Where the hell am I?

920
01:38:05,274 --> 01:38:07,672
Listen to me, I am a friend.

921
01:38:07,872 --> 01:38:09,072
I'm a friend.

922
01:38:09,072 --> 01:38:10,671
What's my name?

923
01:38:10,671 --> 01:38:12,170
What's my name!

924
01:38:12,369 --> 01:38:14,568
Your name is Logan.

925
01:38:17,865 --> 01:38:20,564
You need to trust me.
We have to go.

926
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,759
Follow me.

927
01:38:33,055 --> 01:38:33,854
Now!

928
01:39:07,828 --> 01:39:09,528
Do you know her?

929
01:39:13,324 --> 01:39:14,324
No.

930
01:39:19,421 --> 01:39:21,418
These dudes are not gonna like
what you've done in this place.

931
01:39:21,418 --> 01:39:23,818
We really need to go.

932
01:39:23,818 --> 01:39:26,015
I'll find my own way.

933
01:39:30,712 --> 01:39:32,011
Good luck.

934
01:41:03,545 --> 01:41:05,542
Colonel Stryker?

935
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:12,837
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

936
01:41:14,237 --> 01:41:15,235
You're wanted for questioning...

937
01:41:15,435 --> 01:41:18,333
in connection of the death
of General Munson.

938
01:41:18,333 --> 01:41:19,432
Sir.
