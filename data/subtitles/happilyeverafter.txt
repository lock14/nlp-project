You guys make me laugh.
What do you think?
All you need is my number?
OK, it's 06 12 23 23 41.
You'll call me? Then what?
You say, let's have dinner.
Or lunch, so as not to scare me off.
Then what?
You'll have to make your move.
So here we are.
Try to be more convincing.
What? You want to fuck me?
You want to fuck, right?
Really?
- Yes.
- I want to fuck you.
Fuck you.
Excuse me!
Hi.
Buy you a drink?
Sure.
Maybe we could go somewhere else?
There. See that?
Careful, she's a cocktease.
Let's go somewhere else.
Let's go.
06 1 2 23 23...
Shit!
41.
Stop.
Come on.
Let me get my keys.
Wait.
How'd it go?
Just fine.
Got him to sleep OK?
Right away.
One story and he was out.
He was pooped.
So am l. Night Chloe.
Call you a cab?
No need. Thanks anyway.
- See you tomorrow.
- No, it's Sunday.
See you Monday. Good night.
No, nothing.
Good night.
I was in the toy department.
She starts in, saying, "Even here,
you can feel the sexism."
Give me a break.
I bust my ass to go buy a toy...
"Look," she says,
"look at the girls' toys.
"The dolls, so you'll dream
of fairy princesses...
"...and the babies and diapers.
To pretend you're a mom, slaving..."
Then she loses it.
We get to household goods.
She starts laying into me
about how it's a man's world,
I'm there to get a toy,
she starts up, I never
do housework, I stay out late.
And then, she insists
on buying him a vacuum cleaner!
A vacuum cleaner. For girls!
He's a boy.
Why buy him a girl's toy?
It's hell.
She wants to prove we're the same.
We're not. I'm a man, she's a woman.
There's a big difference.
You kill me.
Go ahead, laugh.
Where's Fred? He's always late.
He's here. I gave him a room.
I can't believe this guy.
Last night he was
with a German girl.
Thanks, Jean-Pierre.
Now it's her.
I know.
- What's she like?
- Which?
This one. The 10:40 a.m.
A knockout. Like the German.
- He's got stamina.
- Got it made.
- Stop complaining.
- I'm not.
- So what?
- So I want a German girl too.
Did I tell you?
Zoe, this is Vincent.
Coffee, babe?
Yes, thanks.
May l?
Sorry.
Does it burn?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?!
Give it up, it's over.
Shit!
It's raining too hard!
Not ready?
You didn't even dress him?
Where are we going?
Out to eat.
OK, and then what?
I don't know, the park.
Yes! The park!
It's pouring out.
Then maybe a movie.
Yes! A movie!
Joseph, stop acting silly.
Get dressed, you'll catch cold.
Yes! Catch cold!
Yeah, and take yukky medicine.
You decide.
Come on, Joseph. Let's get dressed.
Come on.
Antoine, I can't hear.
OK, it's clean already.
Go vacuum your room!
Could you fix his lunch?
I'm watching the news. Wait.
Wait for what?
Let me watch the news.
Don't I get to watch?
OK, watch the news.
Don't I have a right to knowledge?
Only men have that right.
- Shut up.
- You shut up!
Asshole!
Don't they rest on Sundays?
Want to move again?
Antoine, come here.
Turn that off and come eat.
Quiet, I can't hear!
Enough vacuuming!
The maid comes tomorrow!
Leave a message after the beep.
Thank you.
Where are you? You there?
I hope you're on your way.
You're Iate.
Don't do this. I worked it out
with my husband and my kids.
I'm waiting. I want you.
I can 't stand it.
Come quick.
Nice, huh?
Give me the specs, I order it,
I drive it a few miles,
and you get it for the demo price.
Did you get in?
It's an airplane.
She'll kill me.
Why bother? Take mine.
It's exactly what you want.
She'll say I'm just
imitating my friends.
You don't need a new car.
I need a new wife.
I didn't say that.
- Two months.
- Too long.
Then get the sedan.
Look. We have plenty of them.
Why get a Roadster?
It's a two-seater.
Where do you put the wife and kids?
Wife and kids? Spare me, please.
OK. Get back to me. Bye.
Bye.
I'm starving.
I know her.
I know her but I can't place her.
She isn't half bad.
What'll it be?
- The special.
- Me too. Vincent?
The special, please.
Coming up.
One thing is certain,
she knows she's fine.
Get up, ask where you know her from.
- She'll think I'm coming on.
- So what?
I'll go.
Where'd you meet her, in school?
Tell me some teachers' names.
You're nuts.
Hey, you're right! From school.
Give me a teacher's name.
Never fucked her?
- Who fucks anymore?
- Not me.
I do! What high school?
You got it made.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Going home.
- You?
- Home.
I'm going home too.
But there's nobody waiting for me.
I'm going to cry.
Heaven.
- Heaven?
- Oh yeah.
Know what it's like not to know
with who you'll eat, go to bed?
I know who's in my bed.
Think I like waking up,
drinking my coffee all alone?
Or with a broad I want to kill
at the sound of her voice?
What do you think?
I don't deserve a wife and kids?
- You're out of your depth.
- No, you are!
You're depressing me, Fred.
Yes, darling.
Tonight? Of course I can tonight.
I'd be happy too, babe.
Hang on, one second.
Giovanna!
Leaving tomorrow for ltaly?
Yes, yes. Tonight.
I'd love to see you tonight.
Marie?
I was just thinking.
How about this afternoon?
Not tonight, this afternoon.
Better for you?
You're my dream woman!
Hang on one second.
Any rooms?
I don't feel like going to my place.
Same place as last time. OK?
Motherfucker.
Giovanna's ass... You can't...
I don't want to know.
No. It can't be.
No, wrong number. Sorry.
Too bad. You have a lovely voice.
A very lovely voice.
Really. Aren't you exhausted?
Enjoy it!
I've seen you at school.
Your son's in my daughter's class.
That's it. School!
I told you it was school.
Have a nice day.
"l told you it was school."
You're a pick-up artist!
- Stop.
- Little pick-up artist!
Are you stupid? She's married.
What do you know
about married women?
Damn, Joseph. Watch it!
It's not his fault.
Sorry, I didn't mean it.
- I know. It's your fault.
- It's no big deal.
I'm soaking wet!
Finish giving him his bath.
Dad, want to play?
Telephone!
Be right back.
I won't be late.
Don't make me laugh.
- Late is tomorrow?
- Eat.
You mad?
You're mad.
You're not talking to me.
- What can I say?
- Nothing...
Sure, whistle.
Can we talk a second?
Eat, Joseph.
Talk about what?
Georges calls for a card game.
It's eight p.m.
Did you ask me if I minded?
Move over.
Maybe I could've made plans
to go out.
I could've asked Chloe
to sit for Joseph.
What are you doing?
Canceling.
Now that you said yes, go.
Say the word, I won't go.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Say the word, I won't go.
Chloe is my bride.
Eating with us or not?
- OK, I'm going!
- OK, bye!
- Mom, I'm thirsty.
- There's your water.
Sorry, Mom.
- Joseph, I'm going to get you!
- Dad!
OK, I'm going.
I'm going. Bye.
Go buy a car! What else
could we do with our money!
Stop yelling!
And stop boxing,
people will think I beat you!
Why did I ask him
to play poker at our house?
At Ieast we won't hear them
scream all night.
A Mercedes is a masculine car,
right? A real man's car!
- Get a horse and a cowboy hat!
- You're sick!
- Right, I'm crazy!
- Stop yelling, you'll scare Tonio.
Stop calling him Tonio.
"Tonio, my son Tonio."
His name is Antoine. Move over.
You drive me nuts. I'm out of here!
- Good. Get out!
- I'm gone!
Get out, asshole!
Hi. Come on in.
I figured flowers
because you don't drink.
- You shouldn't have.
- Least I could do.
Am I first?
If you need help...
Thanks, that's nice of you.
They'll be here soon.
One day I'll kill her.
I'll go to jail. Who cares?
I'm sorry.
I understand.
I mean, don't be sorry.
You think I'm full of shit?
She wants me to
bash her face in!
Faggot!
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.
Bitch!
Nice piece.
Relax, have a drink.
Should we quit?
Cut.
Don't worry, honey. It'II be fine.
- Could I have a cigarette?
- Sure.
You smoke?
I feel like one. Do you mind?
Of course not, darling.
Anything you need?
- No, we're fine.
- No, thanks.
Good night, then.
How many?
Three.
- You have a nice wife.
- Very nice.
- Married long?
- 15 years.
- 15!
- Three cards.
They're like honeymooners.
- No children?
- No.
Give me 3 big ones.
Anyway, your wife is very pretty.
- Bet instead of talking bullshit.
- It's not bullshit.
That's not what I meant.
I think she's pretty, too.
Check.
- What do you say?
- Very pretty.
No. What do you bet?
Sorry.
Check.
Check. Now we know
we all love your wife.
I check, too.
Check.
What's it open for?
Go ahead, we'll wait.
First door on the right.
Where do you teach?
Paris university.
And your wife?
What do you want?
The bathroom.
Behind you.
Oh, because at my place...
I said the first door!
I got the wrong door.
Not like it's a crime!
I got the wrong door.
Let's call the police.
You're surrounded.
You got the wrong door.
Something weird about them!
Go home, Georges.
I'm not going home.
Never argues with his wife. Weird.
How do you know?
They moved in 3 weeks ago.
Nothing.
- Let's go get a drink.
- Go home, go to sleep.
I'm not going home, I said.
I can't stand it.
It's me.
Be right there.
Ten minutes.
See you.
If it weren't for my son...
Cut the crap.
- Let's go.
- I'm not going for a drink.
Patricia's waiting for me.
- Go for a drink?
- Not me.
Go home to your wife.
I love my wife.
That's not the problem.
I love my wife and other women.
No more lies. I love them all.
The incredible thing is,
because I love one woman, one,
I can't have the others.
Do you realize her importance?
It's her,
or potentially all the others.
Let's divide the world in two.
On one side is my wife,
on the other,
all other women.
My wife... all the others.
The others, my wife.
I chose my wife.
Only two explanations.
Either my wife is a goddess,
or I'm crazy.
That sounds right.
OK, Georges, I got a date.
I'm sleeping at your place.
Go home.
- You ditching me?
- Go home, you'll catch cold.
- You ditching me?
- I got a date.
A date. This guy.
With who? Jennifer Lopez?
Go to bed.
Give her my regards.
Kiss her, say Georges says hello.
Get out of here, assholes!
Thanks. Those are real friends. Bye!
I'm going.
See you later?
Dad, bring me home a car.
Please, Dad!
See you tonight.
Where are you going? Joseph!
It's fine.
She's my girlfriend.
I thought it was Chloe.
Wasn't it Chloe?
You don't know her name.
I know your name.
What's my name?
- And yours?
- Ludivine.
I like Ludivine.
This is my stop.
- Where are you going?
- School.
Just like you.
I want to go with you.
No, you can't.
Joseph, please.
- Give me a kiss?
- I want to go with you.
She goes to high school.
Gonna give her a kiss?
Can she come over?
Right, invite me to your house.
- See you round.
- See you.
Say goodbye?
Can we go now?
All right. He's a child.
See you tomorrow, Ludivine.
You can't have lots of brides.
- Why can't you?
- Because that's the way it is.
But why?
Because you can't love
several people at once.
Would you be happy
if Ludivine had someone else?
A cup of coffee, please.
Sorry.
I'll open the blinds.
It's cloudy today.
But it has southern exposure.
On sunny days it's very bright.
I'll take a look around.
Be right back.
Go right ahead.
- Mom, I can't find it.
- On the fireplace!
- Hey.
- I found my soldier.
- Go get your coat.
- You can't come in?
Just for a second.
I'm waiting, Joseph.
- You look well.
- Fine.
- And you?
- I'm OK.
- Are you in town this weekend?
- I'm here.
- So I'll bring him back...
- Whenever.
- In any case...
- Whenever.
This one's stronger than that one.
- Don't say goodbye?
- Say goodbye to your mom.
Have a nice weekend.
It's very nice.
Is it quiet?
Very quiet.
Could I have a floor plan?
Yes, of course. A floor plan.
This is a list of forms
and guarantees...
Dad caught what was left of the house
and tied some string around it.
Clarisse decided
to teach Piggy how to swim.
Then maybe she'd go oyster fishing.
Dad checks the knots are solid,
then he asks,
"What do we do now?"
"We travel," answers Mom.
- Night, darling.
- Night.
Leave it open a little.
- Like that?
- Yes.
I couldn't wait, I was so hungry.
Is it still hot?
Yeah, it's OK.
- OK?
- Yes, it's good.
- How is it?
- You never saw this?
It's great.
I want to take Joseph on vacation.
You can take time?
Going to leave me all alone?
- You can't come?
- I'd love to.
I can't ask for vacation now.
They'd never give it to me.
- Where?
- I don't know. Somewhere sunny.
Well now.
Vacation.
Never been sexier than that.
What?
Look how handsome they are!
Tell me something.
You ever feel like
having sex with another guy?
Why? You want another girl?
I asked the question. Do you ever
get hot for another guy?
Do you ever want a guy,
just for the sex?
Sex, and possibly more?
Seriously.
Quit it.
I just want to know.
What good would it do you?
I want to know. So do you.
You threw the question back at me.
I know. I know everything.
What, you know?
I know everything.
I know, you know, he knows...
We know, they know.
We all know everything...
Stop.
I knew, we knew...
we will know...
Don't do that.
Not the soy sauce!
You love me?
Of course I love you.
But I love my wife too.
Then why are you with me?
You want me to go?
You want to go?
You still feel as guilty?
- I feel guilty.
- Why?
For hurting her.
You're not. I am.
I want you to love me
like Gabrielle.
Don't say her name
like you know her.
What's she like?
What do you love in her?
Must we talk about her?
Then what do you love in me?
Your bed.
Ever cheat on your wife before?
No.
Pity.
You could've told me
how this will end.
You never fell for one of them?
What? You never fall in love?
I do all the time. I love them all.
I'm not kidding.
Before I make love to them,
they drive me wild.
I'm nuts about them.
But afterwards, I just can't.
Remember falling for Gabrielle?
Very well. It was at Nathalie's.
She had her back turned,
sitting on the floor.
She was smoking a cigarette.
The way her hand was, her neck.
She had her hair up.
You're lucky. She's great.
Yeah, my wife is great.
I remember falling for your wife.
Quit it!
From behind, on all fours.
I was holding her hair up.
Ask her if she remembers
falling for me.
Come on, Joseph! Let's go!
We're going to see Dad!
I got to go.
Well...
I have to go to work.
Bye.
Why don't you stay?
I have to go to work.
I'll call you.
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.
Let's get a drink.
No, I'm going home.
They got back yesterday.
- Was it fun?
- Yeah, I think so.
She just said she rested.
She doesn't even have a tan.
She stayed in her room?
Busy tonight?
- Who knows what went on.
- Stop. What are you doing tonight?
Know what?
I don't even want to know.
Hey, you're wrong.
I don't know what to do.
I'm going home.
Come over for dinner?
Sure, why not? I'll call you?
You'll call?
I'm counting on you.
Get the lights?
I got them.
See you later.
I'm really sorry.
You scared me.
I thought it was Gabrielle.
You OK?
- You all right?
- Telephone.
Sorry.
No, I'm not home.
I decided to go out to eat.
Don't I get to go out,
take time for myself?
- What should I make for Joseph?
- Pasta.
- What?
- You can make pasta.
Pasta with what?
I don't know. Butter and cheese.
- Where is it?
- What, where is it?
Up his ass.
I found it.
- Will you be Iate?
- I don't know.
We're going to get Chinese,
with Geraldine.
Then maybe a movie.
We'II see.
- Great.
- What?
You could've warned me.
I could've seen Fred.
Tell him to come over.
- Yeah, that's what I'II do.
- See you later?
Later.
I don't feel like Chinese.
We'll do this another time?
No, it's not that.
But I feel like pasta too.
He loves his wife and son.
And his mistress and his dog!
- He has no dog.
- He loves his little life.
I'm not his mistress.
Really? Then what are you?
Another woman in his life.
How pathetic.
Stop it, Mom!
- It's me.
- How are you?
I'm having dinner out with my mom.
Ah love...
True, there's nothing better.
Nothing better.
You too.
When you find love,
hold on tight.
Mom, please.
Believe me, I know.
My mom's going crazy.
I'm not crazy.
- When do I meet her?
- I'll call.
- Love you.
- Me, too.
I worry about her.
Mom, that's my private life.
Hey, we're all in the same boat.
We just said, it's all about men.
Of course.
She thinks her husband is cheating.
Hey, that's my private life.
And I want to have a kid.
That's not essential.
- Well!
- Kids?
Thanks a lot! My mother.
What? We're not obliged
to have kids.
Is that mine?
It's important when you have them.
But it's not an obligation.
Not every woman must have kids.
- It's me.
- Excuse me.
- What's up?
- You?
Let's leave them alone.
- Sorry.
- Don't worry.
- What?
- No, not you.
- I got Chinese, too.
- We're having ltalian.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
- With who?
- Geraldine.
I'm still with him...
Who would I be with?
At first, he could see us both.
- What are you doing?
- Watching TV.
I didn't mean you.
I should stop.
- Joseph?
- Asleep. And the movies?
- Movies?
- I have the commute.
Want to move to the country?
- What's that about?
- I'll explain.
- He won't leave her.
- Your dad left me.
He's not my father.
This isn't about you.
See you later.
What does he say?
I love you.
- And you?
- Me, too.
Me, too.
Wait, I can pay.
It's my treat, for once.
- I'm hungry.
- It's coming.
- Sorry.
- It's nothing.
- Ready?
- Let's go.
- She was pretty.
- Which one?
- This one.
- Next to you?
Finally! Not a moment too soon.
Too hot?
You serious, about the country?
Yes. It would be good for my son.
Yes, great.
I'll be home in 20 minutes.
Let me tell you,
even for you it's better.
It's her!
Gabrielle Bonnello,
real estate agent!
Sorry about the movie.
I'm going home too. I'm tired.
I have to get up early.
See you tomorrow.
Shit! My cell!
- Maybe it's her.
- I can't.
Want me to pick up?
- It's at the restaurant.
- Want to call?
I'll just go. It's there.
See you.
Thanks for dinner.
Pick up.
Yeah, it's me.
- Who's this?
- It's me.
Me, who?
I picked up. I thought it was you.
- I shouldn't have.
- No, I did almost call.
Listen, I can't find...
He fucks who and when he wants.
You got it made.
Not the same problem.
Same.
We all have the same problem.
We all want the perfect woman.
He keeps chasing, can't find her.
You got her,
you think she's not right.
And you?
Me?
I have two and I can't choose.
Two? That's it, I'll never vote
for the left again.
You serious?
What is this?
- What is this?
- I met your wife.
- Did you say hi for me?
- It's not a joke.
It's not a joke. Talk!
What is this? Fuck!
- Tell me.
- We agreed never at work.
We agreed you wouldn't come see
me at work, because I'm married...
I know you are.
- Tell me what she knows.
- She knows.
Knows what?
She knows.
She knows?
Knows what?
- Nothing.
- Don't toy with me!
Nothing. We met in a restaurant.
Her friend said she had her doubts.
Doubts! Not the same thing.
- Deny it.
- Deny what?
Good start.
Who is this girl?
You never told us. What's her name?
What does she do?
What's she look like?
It's not about sex.
Are you guys stupid?
A masseuse. Exactly what I need.
You're in deep shit.
It's horrible. It's such a cliche
and yet it's horrible.
It's like a disease.
Only happens to other people.
Only happens to other people!
Know what's horrible?
If Gabrielle knows,
that's horrible.
Horrible.
Why doesn't she say anything?
You love her?
Of course I do. Are you stupid?
I mean the other one.
The masseuse.
Of course I love her.
As much as your wife?
My back hurts.
Hey, I just had this thought.
If she knows but says nothing,
maybe she's got someone too.
- ldiot.
- Watch out!
You idiot.
Are you sleeping?
Anybody home?
It's me, Mom.
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?
Fine. Just fine.
Is Joseph with you?
Yes, he's here. He just had lunch.
I made him
some nice potatoes au gratin.
Gabrielle brought him over?
No, your Dad went to get him.
Did she say where she'd be?
I have no idea. Ask him.
Put him on, will you?
- You OK?
- Fine.
When I got home,
there was no one here.
Want to come over?
No thanks, Mom.
I made a nice cake.
- Don't.
- All right, fine!
Always in a rush. Here's your dad.
Love you.
It's me. You OK?
- Fine and you?
- Fine.
Did she say where she was going?
Not a word.
Forgot the boy's blankie.
He cried in the car.
Do me a favor. No cartoons all day.
Don't worry about it.
- Really.
- I said OK. Don't bust my balls.
I bring him home when?
I'II probably come get him myself.
Stay for dinner. Make Mom happy.
I bet he will.
- Sugar?
- Yeah, on the side.
Are you Iistening?
- See you Iater.
- Later.
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Quick, this one is really cool.
Not a word to your father.
- I have nothing against the country.
- Well then?
Well...
She saw a house.
It has to sell right away.
It's a bargain.
It's a very pretty house. Nice view.
There's this big tree...
See that? Tree, arbre!
Symbol of strength. Masculine.
But strength, force,
you see, is feminine.
- Vagina is masculine.
- So what?
I don't get it. You're ridiculous.
Yeah, well they understand me.
- Not really.
- Me neither.
Anyway, penis is feminine.
Your little dickie is feminine!
Country is feminine.
Is anyone listening?
We're sick of listening to you.
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong?
Can you be polite?
- Look, it's been...
- Be polite?
Talk lower.
Do you mind talking lower please?
Please.
Thank you.
Saythank you.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
- Drink?
- No, I have to go.
Where?
- lnvite her.
- There are two of them.
- Bastard.
- Why?
Jealous?
- I didn't say bastard.
- We all heard.
I didn't mean, I'm jealous.
I meant, it's not right
to do that to girls.
You're ridiculous.
You want to do it with two girls?
Be honest.
You want to do it with two girls?
I'm sorry.
- And you?
- Me what?
Would you want two guys?
- One's enough.
- You want to do it with a guy?
See that?
You're enough for me.
Liar! You wouldn't want to?
Quit fucking around.
I'd like to.
- You wouldn't?
- What, two girls?
I'd like to do it with two guys.
Why is that any different?
I can't stand it.
- What did I do now?
- Not you. Listen.
They're making love.
Do something, I can't sleep.
What do you want me to do?
I knew I could count on you.
Nathalie, what are you doing?
Stop.
Stop it.
Quiet! Are you nuts?
- Oh, it's you.
- Don't open my door?
You're broke. 90,000 dollar car,
I always think you're a guest.
I get free gas, too.
Lucky bastard.
Open the lady's door,
watch your mouth.
How sweet.
See ya.
Already?
I can't stand this.
What are we doing?
Why do you stay with me?
I'll need you when I retire.
You can massage my back.
Asshole!
- What is that?!
- Stop!
What's wrong with you?!
Stop, I was kidding around!
Let go!
- Stop. I was kidding.
- A joke?
Very funny!
Going to leave her?
You'd leave a wife you love?
I forgot.
Want an increase,
bring me the papers.
Tomorrow.
- I promise.
- Sorry, but I need them.
- How are you, Vincent?
- Fine.
You're getting an increase?
You're getting an increase?
I'm going to have a baby.
What?
I'm going to have a baby.
A child.
A girl, if you want to know.
You're joking, right?
No, it's no joke.
Hang on. I must have missed a beat.
A girl I slept with got pregnant,
and she wants to keep the baby.
And so do l, I think.
That's all.
- I don't get it.
- It's simple.
Are you in love with her?
Don't start in
with that stupid romantic paradigm.
- Daddy, Mommy...
- Be serious.
No, you be serious.
And don't judge me.
I'm not, I want you to be happy.
Why? Are you happy?
You happy? You don't look it.
You're the one in pain, not me.
You live with fairy tales
you learned as a boy.
"They got married and lived
happily ever after." Bullshit!
What is it? To have a kid
with a woman I love.
The fruit of our love, is that it?
When I fall for another woman
I just eat my heart out?
Hey, wake up!
You live in a bourgeois world,
and it's out of date!
Look at the divorce figures.
Maybe in 40 years, I'll be the norm.
Forty years is how long
my parents have been married.
You have the box cutter?
The box cutter?
There are knives in the kitchen.
Are you OK?
What? What's that look about?
Nothing. Just watching you
get off on your new car.
- Is that wrong?
- Not at all.
I'm happy for you.
It's hot, isn't it?
Hot?
Check your owner's manual.
No need to stop talking
on my account.
Don't give me that angel face.
I heard what you were saying.
I know what your guy-talk is about.
I'm crazy about her.
You're not going to move your ass?
You let us work,
you don't move your ass?
Naturally,
the women do the clearing.
You still need these?
We're still drinking.
Water off my back.
The only way.
There's still a piece of cake.
No thanks. Nice of you.
Anybody got a cigarette?
It's freezing. Not cold?
Yeah, we're coming in.
You sure about the cake?
Yeah, I think I will have some.
Some guys have all the luck.
Me too.
Take care.
I have to hang up now.
Kiss... You too.
Dad, I don't want to go to school.
What do you mean?
I don't want to.
I want to go to work with you.
You can't.
Why not?
Because you have school.
But why?
Because kids go to school
to learn a job
they can do when they're big.
But I want to go to work with you.
That can't happen.
Why can't it happen?
Because that's how it is.
See that lady? She goes to work
and her daughter goes to school.
Why do adults always go to work?
Because adults work
to pay for the children's toys.
Why do you have to pay for toys?
Because things have a value...
What's a value, Dad?
A value is what a thing costs.
And who decides all that?
The president of this country!
Have a nice day.
Three bedrooms, quiet...
Sunny all afternoon
in the living room.
Hold on.
Rue Blanche. Wood floors.
Two bedrooms.
Two.
Yes, very quiet.
Very quiet.
Yes. Very quiet.
It's taken.
I'm picking up the keys
in about twenty minutes.
OK, fine. See you there.
Hi.
Are you the one
who wants the visit?
I'm not late?
A quiet building.
They want to be sure
the new tenant won't make noise.
I'm all alone. No children.
No pets, no birds.
I have nothing.
I'm...
very quiet.
- Go ahead.
- After you.
I feel like I've seen you before.
Maybe.
