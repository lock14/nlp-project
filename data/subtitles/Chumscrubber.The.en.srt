2
00:01:19,276 --> 00:01:22,779
This was the best
of all possible worlds.

3
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:25,349
But even here,
a little help was necessary.

4
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:28,285
And that's where
Troy came in.

5
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:41,331
Troy supplied feel-good pills
to all the kids at Hillside.

6
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:49,206
And, in this way,
happiness was spread all around.

7
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:59,816
Life could not possibly
be any more wonderful.

8
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:42,793
Lainie, listen, do you feel
like something's missing?

9
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:46,129
Has your energy level
been noticeably low lately?

10
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:48,632
Believe me, I know.

11
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:51,602
Lainie, believe me. Yes.

12
00:02:52,536 --> 00:02:55,505
Right. So if you would
choose at this time

13
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:57,774
to upgrade to the
full platinum package,

14
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:01,645
you would start to see
the changes that I'm talking about.

15
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:06,750
No. No, I don't want you
to think of these as vitamins.

16
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:08,785
- Son of a bitch.
- Oharlie!

17
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:11,321
I am doing VeggiForce.

18
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:13,724
- Level three.
- Yes!

19
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,759
Oh, absolutely.

20
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:17,227
Lainie, can I...?

21
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:21,465
Oan I tell you, it has
completely changed my life?

22
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:23,901
You see?

23
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:28,038
It has given me
an entirely new life system.

24
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:31,608
Good for you, Lainie.
Good for you! I'm so happy.

25
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:56,667
Oh, Dean, hello.
It's wonderful to see you.

26
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,236
Troy's out back
in his little hideaway.

27
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:00,737
Dean, do me a favor.

28
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,873
Get him to turn his stereo
down a bit?

29
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,208
- Sure.
- Great. Thanks so much.

30
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:52,022
Troy?

31
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:51,114
Goodbye, Dean.

32
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:00,857
Goodbye, Mrs. Johnson.

33
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,733
Dean, I was hoping
to get your opinion on something.

34
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:45,369
Oan you come in here
for a minute?

35
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:48,739
Lt'll just take one second.

36
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:58,282
Publisher sent this over.

37
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:01,251
It's for promotional events.
Book signings, lectures...

38
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,387
...TV.

39
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:06,023
You got a good eye.
What do you think? Is it too much?

40
00:07:06,089 --> 00:07:07,958
What do you want, Dad?

41
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,263
Let's have a seat.

42
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,867
I want to talk to you about Troy.

43
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:19,770
- I told you everything already.
- You told us the facts.

44
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:22,139
We're interested in
how you feel about it.

45
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:24,541
- Dad, who's we?
- Your mother and I, of course.

46
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,510
And...

47
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:29,246
A lot of people.
You threw us all for a loop there, pal.

48
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:32,716
Hold on a second.
Is this a therapy session?

49
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:35,018
- Is that what you're doing?
- No, not at all.

50
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:38,755
- You think I'm crazy?
- Of course not, Dean.

51
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,857
We're just talking here.
Man to man.

52
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,993
- Just talking?
- Absolutely.

53
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,061
Man to man?

54
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,064
OK.

55
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,938
Dean, I know Troy
was your best friend.

56
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:59,476
Actually, we weren't really friends.
We hung out sometimes, that's all.

57
00:07:59,543 --> 00:08:01,878
Did you have a
better friend than him?

58
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:04,715
I don't really have any friends, Dad.
You know that.

59
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:07,651
So, strictly speaking,
Troy was your best friend.

60
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:09,820
And how do you feel
about the suicide

61
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:14,524
of your best friend
in the world?

62
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,028
Real shitty.

63
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:20,297
Oome on, son,
make an effort for me.

64
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:23,267
Dad, I told you before.
I'm not all broken up about it.

65
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,903
I know I'm supposed to be.
I'm just not.

66
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,838
You're really not?

67
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,383
- No, I'm sorry...
- No, no. I...

68
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,286
I understand how someone
might respond like that.

69
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:47,491
What are you writing?

70
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:51,495
Dad, I thought we were just
talking man to man here.

71
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:52,629
Just one second.

72
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:01,471
Dad, if you write about me again
in another one of your stupid books,

73
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:03,206
I'm gonna kill you.

74
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:04,741
Stupid?

75
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:07,611
There are several major book
chains around this country

76
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,746
- that would disagree with you.
- All right.

77
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:12,182
The Happy Accident
will pay your college tuition.

78
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:14,117
- All right!
- Fine.

79
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:19,556
Let me ask you this.

80
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,725
Mrs. Johnson suspects that Troy

81
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:25,162
might have been selling drugs
to some of the kids at school.

82
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:28,465
- Yeah?
- How do you feel about that?

83
00:09:30,801 --> 00:09:34,037
I feel then it must have
been unfulfilling for him.

84
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:36,039
That's very interesting.

85
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:37,574
Why do you say that?

86
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:39,576
Because he killed himself.

87
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:44,815
Dean, a young life was taken,
and from the moment it happened,

88
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,050
you ignored it like it was nothing.

89
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:49,586
You didn't even tell
any of the adults at the party.

90
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:51,822
- Oan you explain?
- I didn't think you would...

91
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,457
- What?
... care!

92
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,829
This is called Viloprex.

93
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:02,332
Now, don't fight me on this,
I prescribe this to lots of kids.

94
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,301
You want me to take that?

95
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,537
It's just something
to give you a little...

96
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:08,705
...balance.

97
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:12,009
OK, let me have it.

98
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,813
OK. Wonderful.

99
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:48,145
*OAREFREE LIVING
HILLSIDE OOMMUNITIES

100
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:15,839
Lee, can I get some
by the end of the day?

101
00:11:15,906 --> 00:11:17,341
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

102
00:11:17,407 --> 00:11:19,476
Lee. My dad's coming
to visit this weekend.

103
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:22,312
I understand, but our supply
is a little low right now.

104
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:26,216
Prozac, Haldol, it doesn't matter.
Anything to get me through till Monday.

105
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:28,051
- I'm almost out of Ritalin.
- Ritalin.

106
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,920
I gotta check.
I don't know if we have it.

107
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,121
I still got a few left.

108
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:33,824
- He's here all weekend.
- I'll see what I can do, man.

109
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:35,192
Got any Vicodin?

110
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:51,808
Hey! Psycho!

111
00:12:03,453 --> 00:12:06,023
What happened to your boyfriend?

112
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,926
Oome on, he's all tied up
and waiting for you, Dean.

113
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,729
Don't ignore me, Dean.

114
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,769
Don't ignore me!

115
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:26,877
Don't ignore me.

116
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,646
Here it is, Mrs. Bratley,

117
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:32,950
with all the changes,
exactly as you ordered.

118
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:35,018
I lowered the neckline
just a touch.

119
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,354
The crystal beading,
a special-order item,

120
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,323
but we have to talk
about that later.

121
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:42,259
The buttons,
which are covered...

122
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,727
Well, it's wonderful.

123
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:46,430
It's absolutely wonderful.

124
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:50,200
Michael.

125
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,737
Michael.

126
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,207
Oh... yes.

127
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,810
I can see
the changes this time.

128
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:02,246
It's just really... It's amazing.

129
00:13:02,312 --> 00:13:05,349
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
We had to put a lot of projects on hold,

130
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,885
but that's OK,
because I think it's really...

131
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:10,153
Michael, you didn't even look.

132
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,456
Anyway, the fit
will be exactly the same.

133
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:15,125
So, if you like,
I can ring it up for you now.

134
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:17,261
Oan I see the veil
and the dress together?

135
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:19,563
Oan I do that? Oan I see
the two of them together?

136
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,933
I don't know that we can do
any more alterations before Sunday.

137
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,235
I just want to see
the two of them together.

138
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:27,371
I don't think
I'm being unreasonable.

139
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:28,972
Of course.

140
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,950
You all right?

141
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:43,086
I mean, after what
Billy did this morning?

142
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:45,656
It's fine. I don't care.

143
00:13:49,192 --> 00:13:52,162
- I'm Orystal.
- I know.

144
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:54,197
Everyone knows who you are.

145
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:57,868
You don't like
to talk much, do you?

146
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:01,305
Or is itjust that you
don't like talking to me?

147
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:02,839
What do you want?

148
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:05,208
I just want to say
I'm sorry, that's all.

149
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:09,713
- Oh, you were a part of that?
- No, but they're my friends.

150
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,883
- The guys who did it.
- Nice friends you have.

151
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,252
Well, better to
have no friends at all?

152
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,822
Honestly? Yeah.
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

153
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:23,260
You know that's why you
get so much shit, right?

154
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,963
The way you act like
you're smarter than everyone.

155
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:28,398
Well, I don't torment
people I don't know.

156
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:33,337
- I thought you said you didn't care.
- I'm talking about Troy.

157
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,739
Since you can't apologize
to him for this morning,

158
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:37,407
I guess apologizing to me

159
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:39,743
is enough to make yourself
feel better, right?

160
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,347
You know what?
I was really wrong.

161
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,482
You're definitely
not smarter than us.

162
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:47,851
And why is that?

163
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:49,820
Because Troy was my friend.

164
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:55,058
How'd you know Troy?

165
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:57,461
Are you apologizing to me now?

166
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:58,629
No.

167
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,733
You really don't care
what people think, do you?

168
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,568
No.

169
00:15:04,635 --> 00:15:06,870
- That's a nice trick.
- Thanks.

170
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:08,872
I studied in the far East.

171
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:11,008
Maybe you could
show me how it's done.

172
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:12,643
Step one:
Years of ridicule.

173
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,680
What if I start
by sitting next to you?

174
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:22,753
It's probably not a good idea.

175
00:15:23,654 --> 00:15:26,590
I'll take my chances.

176
00:15:30,193 --> 00:15:33,130
- How do you eat that stuff?
- This?

177
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:36,967
Pretty much in the standard way.

178
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:40,103
You know, if I ate that every day,
I'd have a big, fat ass.

179
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,105
Is that your greatest fear?

180
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,676
No, but...

181
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,511
...it's my mom's greatest wish.

182
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:50,380
- That you be fat?
- No. Just fatter than her, anyway.

183
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,115
Sounds healthy.

184
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:58,789
Is it true that you found Troy?

185
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:00,757
- Why?
- I'm just...

186
00:16:00,824 --> 00:16:03,460
...wondering what really happened.
- Just wondering?

187
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,363
You want me to tell you
a bunch of gory details, is that it?

188
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,932
It's impossible
trying to talk to you.

189
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,968
You know,
I read this statistic

190
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:13,670
that the average kid
sees something like...

191
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:16,707
...10,000 dead bodies
on TV before he turns 18.

192
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,311
Is that what it was like?

193
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,582
Like TV?

194
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:29,720
No.

195
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:33,190
It was nothing
like that at all, really.

196
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:36,760
How'd you know Troy?

197
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:40,864
Listen, Dean, I should
have asked you this...

198
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:44,034
Jesus! Orystal, just suck
his dick, why don't you?

199
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:45,969
- Billy.
- Did you ask him?

200
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:48,739
- Ask me what?
- Both of you guys get out of here, OK?

201
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,708
Oh. I don't
think she asked him.

202
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:54,044
Ask me what?
What are they talking about?

203
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,714
Here's the deal, psycho.
Troy has something we need,

204
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:01,218
and since you guys were
such good butt-buddies,

205
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,020
you're gonna go get it for us.

206
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:05,956
Get what?
Orystal, what's going on?

207
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:08,458
Pills, dipshit.

208
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,762
Pills, go get us the pills

209
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:14,031
and maybe I won't
have to kick your ass.

210
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,938
Orystal, you were right.

211
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:23,707
I'm really not as smart
as I thought I was.

212
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:25,509
I really believed you, you know?

213
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:28,545
- Wait, Dean...
- You were right about something else.

214
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,747
It's not that
I don't like talking.

215
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:34,051
No. It's just that
I don't like talking to you.

216
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:43,927
When I am designing
a family room,

217
00:17:43,961 --> 00:17:45,529
or an outdoor seating area,

218
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,965
I think,
"What is the principle?"

219
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,968
- The principle?
- The guiding principle.

220
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:53,503
And I know you don't
think in these terms...

221
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,439
It's about balance.

222
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:58,375
It's all about balance.

223
00:17:58,442 --> 00:17:59,743
Right.

224
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,013
- Michael.
- Yes, Terri?

225
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,848
Oan you pick up
Oharlie from school?

226
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,351
I think I'm gonna be here
a little while longer.

227
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:08,952
OK, sure.

228
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:11,655
Believe me, if I told you
the story of how we met,

229
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:13,857
I mean, you saw
the scar on his head?

230
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:17,094
He was almost killed.
And I rushed over...

231
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,976
Hey, listen, Lou...

232
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:34,945
Hey, just because you're the mayor,

233
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,747
it doesn't mean
you're above the law.

234
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:41,018
You have to let Terri
move on with her life.

235
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,853
You have to move on, yourself.

236
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,255
You might want to pay
that ticket right away.

237
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:47,491
I'd hate to have
to hit you with a warrant.

238
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:49,726
Hold on, Lou.
Let's talk about this.

239
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:06,543
- Two "F's" in Stiffle?
- Hurry up.

240
00:19:10,614 --> 00:19:12,783
There's two Stiffles.

241
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:14,284
What?

242
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,687
There's two Stiffles.
Dean and Oharlie.

243
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:18,488
Who the hell's Oharlie?

244
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:39,810
F/A-18 Hornet.

245
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:41,812
Perfect vision. It's a gift.

246
00:19:51,188 --> 00:19:52,923
Which one of you
is Oharlie?

247
00:19:56,026 --> 00:19:58,462
- You're Oharlie?
- Yeah.

248
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:01,131
Damn. You're teeny-tiny.

249
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:03,467
- Hey, you wanna come with us?
- No way.

250
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,136
Look what we got.

251
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:07,537
What?

252
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,675
- Goddamn it, Lee.
- There he is.

253
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,243
Oome here.

254
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:15,879
Who the hell's that?

255
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:18,916
That is Dean's brother.

256
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:21,318
- Hi.
- Hi.

257
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,323
Shit. My parents.

258
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,730
- Those kids again, Lee?
- We're doing a group project.

259
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:37,568
With them, Lee? You think
they care what grades you get?

260
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,169
- Mom.
- Look, son,

261
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:42,773
you let your grades go now, maybe
you don't get into a top-tier school.

262
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,309
- Yeah.
- You don't get into a top-tier school,

263
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,711
maybe you got to settle
for a second-rate job.

264
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:49,947
Maybe you don't have
the life you want.

265
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:53,050
Maybe each and every day you wake up
and wanna crawl back into bed

266
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,485
and tell the world
to go to hell.

267
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:59,423
We're just saying, you've worked
too hard to blow it in your last year.

268
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:02,192
We've all worked hard together.

269
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,262
So, come on, champ,
hop in the car.

270
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,997
It's for school.

271
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:12,102
Just look at our little man.

272
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,804
All right, Lee.

273
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,505
All right.

274
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:33,423
Sorry about that, Mr. Parker.

275
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:38,589
Oan someone please
answer the goddamn phone?

276
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,160
Hello?

277
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:46,797
Ask for Dean.

278
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:49,233
Is Dean there, please?

279
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:52,035
Yes, he is.
Who may I say is calling?

280
00:22:52,102 --> 00:22:54,972
- It's Billy.
- One moment, please.

281
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,007
Dean?

282
00:22:57,074 --> 00:23:00,143
Telephone.

283
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,713
Telephone, honey.
Some boy named Billy.

284
00:23:02,746 --> 00:23:04,715
All right!

285
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:10,854
- What?
- Dean?

286
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:13,323
- What do you want?
- We got Oharlie.

287
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,359
- Who?
- Your brother.

288
00:23:15,425 --> 00:23:18,629
- We kidnapped your brother.
- What are you talking about, man?

289
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,764
I got him right now.
He's scared shitless.

290
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:23,901
Why did you kidnap my brother?

291
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:26,870
So you know I'm not fucking around.
I want the stuff from Troy.

292
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:29,840
- I all ready told you...
- I don't think you're listening.

293
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,942
You are going
to get me Troy's drugs.

294
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,378
- Or what?
- Don't push me, psycho.

295
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:37,848
- Or what?
- I'll kill him. I'm gonna kill him.

296
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:40,851
I'm not fucking around, man.
I swear to God!

297
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:43,120
I'll cut off
his fucking head!

298
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:49,626
Fine. Kill him.

299
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,333
- What did he say?
- Maybe he really is crazy.

300
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,304
- What did he say?
- He said for us to kill him.

301
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,586
So, who are you guys calling?

302
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:17,621
Your brother.

303
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:21,024
- Who?
- Your brother, Dean.

304
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:24,428
I don't have a brother.

305
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:28,799
- Oharlie Stiffle?
- Oharlie Bratley.

306
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:39,376
Michael. Honey?

307
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:44,214
Oharlie, Mom's home.

308
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:52,122
Oharlie. Do I see
your sheet music not put away?

309
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:01,265
Oharlie, do I need
to make dinner?

310
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:07,638
Oharlie?

311
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:11,475
You're supposed to be
the smart one, Lee.

312
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,645
We all messed up.
Just forget it already, OK?

313
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:16,013
It's this one right here.

314
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:23,654
Thanks for the ride.
And the burger too.

315
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,922
Wait.

316
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:28,759
- I gotta get home...
- Will you shut up a minute?

317
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,761
Billy, he has
nothing to do with Dean.

318
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:32,796
Maybe that doesn't matter.

319
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,441
Oharlie?

320
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:47,544
Oharlie?

321
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:53,083
Honey, please open the door.

322
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:57,454
OK, I know this whole wedding thing
is not easy for you,

323
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,924
but it's not like I'm asking you
to think of Michael as your father.

324
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:02,893
Lou will always be your father.

325
00:26:05,062 --> 00:26:08,765
- We're up here.
- Terri, I'm glad you're home.

326
00:26:08,832 --> 00:26:10,367
I had to leave work.

327
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:13,003
It's this book.
I just can't put it down.

328
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,107
- I was really hoping...
- Wonderful, honey. A little later?

329
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,377
Sweetheart, would you
open another bottle for us?

330
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:21,912
OK.

331
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:25,515
What does he do? Really?

332
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:29,186
And is he...? He is.

333
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:32,522
Yeah, well, I guess
I could meet him, at least.

334
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:36,260
Honey, I have to go. A bunch of
handsome young men just came to visit.

335
00:26:36,326 --> 00:26:39,296
OK. Oiao, baby.

336
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:42,599
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, Mrs. Falls.

337
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,569
It's Jerri, please.

338
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:47,771
- Who's this?
- That's Oharlie.

339
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:50,607
Well, hello, Oharlie.
I don't think we've met.

340
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,110
Hi.

341
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:55,646
So what sort of trouble
are you kids up to tonight?

342
00:26:55,712 --> 00:27:00,183
We kidnapped Oharlie to blackmail this
guy into giving us a stash of drugs.

343
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,652
Very funny.

344
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:03,120
Except, we got the wrong one.

345
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,888
We wanted to get Oharlie Stiffle,

346
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,891
- but we ended up getting Oharlie...
- Bratley.

347
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,526
Oharlie Bratley.

348
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,463
Wait a minute, Bratley? Is...?
Is your mother Terri Bratley,

349
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,300
the designer,
Terri's Interior Visions?

350
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,469
Isn't she getting married
to the mayor on Sunday?

351
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:23,574
- He's gonna stay here tonight, OK?
- Sure. No problem.

352
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,310
Oan I get you anything?
Some blankets, pillows...

353
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:28,045
- Mom, we're fine.
- OK.

354
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:29,880
And what is this?

355
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:33,016
- It's a tuba.
- Wow.

356
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,686
- Maybe we could have a concert later?
- Mom.

357
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:37,287
OK.

358
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,590
You kids have fun.
I am gonna put on my bikini.

359
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:43,026
Anybody wants
to go for a swim...

360
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:47,030
But if you leave a message, I'll get
back to you as soon as I possibly can.

361
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:49,933
Hi, Terri. Mrs. Bratley, I'm sorry.

362
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,669
Your machine just cut me off.

363
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:56,440
My name is Jerri Falls, and I live
in the Ocean Orest development.

364
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:58,242
Anyway, I...

365
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:12,089
- This is Terri Bratley...
- Hi, I'm Jerri Falls...

366
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,636
- Hello?
- Dean?

367
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:28,038
Jesus. Oan't you guys
just leave me alone?

368
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:31,241
- I'd love to, but I can't.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

369
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:33,877
- I need your help.
- Yeah, I doubt that.

370
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:36,780
- You know it all, huh?
- What do you want?

371
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,784
You know how Billy said
he kidnapped your brother?

372
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:43,153
Yeah, that was
a pretty lame bullshitjob, huh?

373
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,755
Well, it wasn't all bullshit.

374
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:47,124
He did take a kid.
He just took the wrong one.

375
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,725
Wrong what?

376
00:28:48,792 --> 00:28:50,360
The wrong kid.

377
00:28:50,427 --> 00:28:53,197
Even though it has nothing
to do with you now,

378
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:55,232
he won't let him go.

379
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,668
I don't believe you.

380
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,336
Hold on.

381
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:02,739
Oharlie! Oharlie!

382
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:05,142
Billy, get off of him.

383
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,544
Oharlie, come here.

384
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:20,090
- Hello?
- Who is this?

385
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:22,626
This is Oharlie Bratley.

386
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,662
- Did those guys kidnap you?
- I think so.

387
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,965
- That sucks.
- I guess.

388
00:29:28,031 --> 00:29:31,568
- Where do you live?
- 25720 Sunnycrest.

389
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,637
What do you mean?
I live on Sunnycrest.

390
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:35,906
Yeah. I know.

391
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:37,708
Put Orystal back on the phone.

392
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:43,680
Are you guys just fucking
with me again, or is this real?

393
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:47,384
No, I think this is pretty real.

394
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:08,205
- Yes?
- Hi. Is Oharlie here?

395
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,507
He's not really in a talking mood.

396
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:13,410
- But he is here.
- I'm sorry. Who are you?

397
00:30:13,477 --> 00:30:15,979
- I'm Dean.
- Isn't it kind of late?

398
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:18,382
It's for school.

399
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:21,018
OK. Oome right in.
See if he'll talk to you, at least.

400
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:23,787
His room is right there
at the top of the stairs.

401
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:56,453
- So, you're a friend of Oharlie's?
- No, not exactly. No.

402
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,989
Yeah. Oharlie doesn't have
a lot of friends yet.

403
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:00,824
He's not really socially gifted.

404
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:03,927
But he's a good kid, basically.

405
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:07,564
- Listen, I just...
- Good night. Thanks for coming.

406
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,032
No, no, no. I'm still here.

407
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:10,868
Wait, I've got an idea.

408
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:13,737
Have you eaten yet?
Why don't you stay for dinner?

409
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:16,406
Honey, I don't think tonight
is the best night.

410
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,909
But I can get that
special-ordered, right?

411
00:31:20,077 --> 00:31:21,144
Oh, Michael.

412
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,839
I don't care if you have
to fly it in from the moon.

413
00:31:48,906 --> 00:31:50,674
Have it here by Sunday.
Thank you.

414
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,844
Terri, wait. Wait.

415
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,585
Is there anything else?

416
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:04,788
Yeah. Oould you
tell Oharlie I said goodbye?

417
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:07,724
- OK.
- OK.

418
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:27,244
Hello, Allie.

419
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:30,380
Oarrie, hi. How are you?

420
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:32,382
- Am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

421
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:34,351
I'm just in the middle
of making dinner.

422
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:37,721
- Would you like a glass of wine?
- Well, I left the car running.

423
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,823
I just wanted to come back

424
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,025
and return your dish
and say thank you.

425
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:45,963
It has been such a relief
to not have to cook lately.

426
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:49,399
Everyone has been so nice.

427
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,272
What?

428
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,907
This dish...

429
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:00,344
Oh! Oh, my God.

430
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:02,012
This is not the right one?

431
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,814
I got so many, I mean,

432
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,383
I've been driving around
all night returning them.

433
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,919
Like I say,
everyone has been so nice.

434
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:11,922
I don't believe
I brought over a casserole.

435
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:18,061
Oan you hang on
just one second, Oarrie?

436
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,544
Allie, am I making a mistake here?

437
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,847
Bill and I were meaning
to come over, really.

438
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,649
You just get so busy.

439
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,485
No, but I'm certain.

440
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,588
I mean, you came over,
we had coffee.

441
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,824
We talked, right?

442
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:51,562
Or am I...

443
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:53,964
...just imagining
the whole thing?

444
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,800
Is that what I'm doing here?
Am I just...

445
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:59,903
...imagining all of it?

446
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,208
I'm sorry, Oarrie.
You just get so busy sometimes.

447
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:06,743
I'm so embarrassed.

448
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,845
I don't know what I was thinking.

449
00:34:08,912 --> 00:34:11,315
Here you are, preparing
a nice family dinner...

450
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,150
Would you like
to stay and eat with us?

451
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,153
And I come in and interrupt
everything with no reason at all.

452
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,155
- Why don't you stay?
- I really can't.

453
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,923
I have so many dishes to return.

454
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,694
Everyone has been just
so unbelievably nice.

455
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:28,398
- So, we'll see you on Sunday?
- Sunday?

456
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:32,636
Don't tell me that
I forgot your invitation too?

457
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,439
Troy's memorial.
It's this Sunday.

458
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:39,943
Of course, Oarrie.
Right. We're looking forward...

459
00:34:41,411 --> 00:34:42,746
We'll be there.

460
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,749
And...

461
00:34:45,816 --> 00:34:49,520
...I wanted to let you know,
just in case you were wondering...

462
00:34:49,586 --> 00:34:51,255
Yes?

463
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:54,057
In no way, whatsoever,

464
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:56,894
do I blame you for Troy's death.

465
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:00,130
Good night.

466
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:12,709
Orystal, come over here.
We're gonna have a concert.

467
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:15,646
- I'm fine here, Mom.
- Baby, don't be shy.

468
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:20,317
She's been filling out
a little bit lately.

469
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,653
Which is completely
natural for your age.

470
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,489
I just hope I look
as good as you at 35, Mom.

471
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,191
Go ahead, Oharlie.

472
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,393
Yeah?

473
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:30,994
I mean, you are 35, right?

474
00:35:31,061 --> 00:35:33,463
Actually, I'm 39,
sweetheart, you know that.

475
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,367
- You're 39?
- Anytime, Oharlie.

476
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,336
I don't have my sheet music.

477
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,638
The only one I know
by heart is Tequila.

478
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:44,841
Well, for someone almost 40,
you look great, Mom.

479
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,312
Well, thank you so much, sweetheart.

480
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:52,449
- 40 years old. Wow.
- There's no real... I don't know.

481
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:55,419
The marching band,
the melody doesn't go to the tuba.

482
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:58,622
- We know the tune. We'll recognize it.
- More wine, Jerri?

483
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,425
I would love some.
You are such a charmer.

484
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,929
Did you know I'm going
to the Air Force after graduation?

485
00:36:05,996 --> 00:36:07,297
- Did you know that?
- No.

486
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:09,633
They accepted me for
the pilot training program.

487
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,501
Just like your dad, right?

488
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:15,339
No. No, he was just a mechanic.

489
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:18,609
He couldn't even pass the eye test,
but me, perfect vision.

490
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:19,977
20/20.

491
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:21,945
- It's a gift.
- It's wonderful.

492
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:24,248
Just wonderful.

493
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:28,485
- Miss Falls?
- Jerri, please.

494
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,721
Any time. Let's do it.

495
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:41,698
The Ohumscrubber.

496
00:36:45,402 --> 00:36:47,571
I live in the city.

497
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:50,908
In an apartment above
the cloud left by the blast.

498
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,211
I'm one of the lucky ones.

499
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,747
One morning,

500
00:36:56,813 --> 00:37:00,984
I woke to find that my head
was no longer attached to my body.

501
00:37:13,463 --> 00:37:16,033
I'm not dead,
but who could call this a life?

502
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:18,936
Get ready to die.

503
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:28,579
So I did what I had to do.

504
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:31,682
In a world of freaks
and subhuman creatures...

505
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:41,425
...I became the Ohumscrubber.

506
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:42,693
Ohumscrubber.

507
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:05,048
- Hello?
- Orystal?

508
00:38:05,115 --> 00:38:07,451
- Yeah, it's me.
- Hi...

509
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:10,954
Listen, I just want
to ask you something.

510
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,856
When this whole thing is over

511
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,292
and we see each other
at school, or wherever...

512
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,628
Yeah?

513
00:38:18,695 --> 00:38:20,931
I don't really
know how to say this...

514
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,633
No, what is it?

515
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:24,935
Well, it's...

516
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,374
Oan you just...

517
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:32,376
...leave me alone?

518
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,281
- What?
- No, I mean it.

519
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:40,684
- Leave me alone.
- I didn't mean for this all to happen.

520
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,653
Don't try to act
like you know me.

521
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,155
Don't bother me,
don't ever talk to me again.

522
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,091
Why the hell would I want
to talk to someone like you?

523
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,561
Exactly.

524
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,364
I'll get you
Troy's pills tomorrow.

525
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,527
Let's go, Michael. We have
a million things to do today.

526
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:58,629
Terri, could we
slow down for a minute?

527
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,564
- I was up all night...
- Morning!

528
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,033
I really want
to talk to you about this book.

529
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,036
Oertainly a lot of activity
around your house lately.

530
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,205
Well, I am getting
married tomorrow.

531
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,374
I know.
That's just so wonderful.

532
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,576
I did want to ask,
I don't mean to be rude...

533
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,344
- Go ahead.
- Well...

534
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:18,615
Your people are parking
just wherever they like.

535
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,784
And the cleaning crew?

536
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,021
Those Mexican folks,
they backed right into my yard.

537
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:26,623
Look, you can see.
Just right up over the flowers.

538
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,792
Not a word of apology.

539
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:32,696
You mind if we deal
about this a little bit later on?

540
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,532
I didn't mean to cause
a problem, especially now,

541
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,368
while you're preparing
for your wonderful wedding.

542
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:40,537
I have a million things to do today.

543
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,772
I know what you mean,

544
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:44,408
because I'm having the service
for my son tomorrow

545
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:46,643
and I have things
to prepare, as well.

546
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:50,214
And I will definitely
need my fair share

547
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,083
of parking spaces
for my guests.

548
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,720
- I understand.
- I don't mean to be a nuisance.

549
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,357
- Not at all.
- But I did want to tell you,

550
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:03,627
just in case you're wondering,
in no way, whatsoever...

551
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:04,862
Point taken!

552
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,633
I can't believe
the nerve of that woman.

553
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,735
She knew
it was my wedding this Sunday.

554
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:14,304
Oan't she find another date
for her memorial?

555
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:18,742
Dean? Honey? Breakfast!

556
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,105
Were you watching me?

557
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,507
No.

558
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:55,445
I must've been slobbering
all over myself like a retard, huh?

559
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:56,747
You look nice.

560
00:41:58,115 --> 00:42:00,017
I bet.

561
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,392
- Oome smoke with me.
- OK.

562
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,598
Have a seat, it's all ready.

563
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,600
- Turn off your game now.
- Shit, Mom.

564
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:19,236
What did I tell you about
swearing in this house?

565
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,605
- You're against it?
- Right. I am against it.

566
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,041
- I'm not hungry.
- Just have some eggs, then.

567
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:25,542
- OK, I've gotta go.
- What?

568
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,379
I've got a meeting with the agents.
We're talking foreign distribution.

569
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,881
Bill, it's Saturday.

570
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,051
I was hoping we could all
do something together as a family.

571
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:36,753
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Has anyone seen my case?

572
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,722
- That's a great attitude.
- Welcome.

573
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,726
- I just brought it out. I just had it.
- Dean, you have to eat something.

574
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,361
I just said I'm not hungry.

575
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:46,563
It's just a side effect
of the medication.

576
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,566
Isn't there a more natural way
we could treat his problem?

577
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,336
- My problem?
- A bunch of vitamins isn't gonna help.

578
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:54,004
They're notjust vitamins.

579
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,306
I could really use
an extra set of eyes here.

580
00:42:56,373 --> 00:43:00,344
- I could make you some pancakes.
- Mom, no, I don't want pancakes.

581
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,479
I'm fine, Mom. I'm fine.

582
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,315
- Anyway, I have to go.
- What? No.

583
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,652
- Where are you going?
- Do I have to explain everything I do?

584
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,488
- I'm just meeting some friends.
- Really?

585
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,691
- Don't act too surprised, Mom.
- No, why would I be?

586
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,094
- 'Oause no one likes him, Mom.
- Oh, Oharlie.

587
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,896
Everyone thinks he's crazy.

588
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:21,398
I'm asking everyone.
Has anyone seen my case?

589
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:24,835
It's right here on the goddamn,
son-of-a-bitch counter!

590
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,038
All right, Mom.

591
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,808
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

592
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:35,412
- Then why are you so small?
- I don't know.

593
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:37,014
Just am.

594
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,617
My dad put me on this
Bulk 2000 for awhile,

595
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,786
this powder stuff,

596
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:46,390
it ended up costing him $400,
but after a couple of weeks,

597
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,659
I got really bad diarrhea.

598
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:52,496
I ended up losing, like, eight pounds.

599
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:55,499
My dad went ballistic.

600
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,904
You don't smoke, do you?

601
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,641
Sure. Well, no.

602
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,010
Here's a secret.

603
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,981
Don't act like
somebody you're not.

604
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,585
You do that long enough,
you'll forget you were acting.

605
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:17,855
And so will everyone else.

606
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,804
I was actually thinking
of going out for marching band.

607
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,540
Seems that's what the chicks
are into, right?

608
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:41,411
Yeah, that's right, Billy.
Oharlie nailed me all night long.

609
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,914
It was unreal.

610
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,456
What the hell
did you do that for?

611
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,558
'Oause I'm a stupid bastard.

612
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,330
Let's get the fuck
out of this place.

613
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,837
Oharlie...

614
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,709
My mom gave this to me
on my 12th birthday.

615
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,116
I always hated
this stupid thing.

616
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:41,305
Hello, Debbie?
It's Oarrie. Johnson.

617
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,307
Oh, I guess it is early.

618
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:47,511
Right. Well, I'm calling
because I just wanted to tell you,

619
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:50,814
in case you were wondering,
that in no way, whatsoever,

620
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:52,649
do I blame you for Troy's death.

621
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,831
Hello, Timmy?
Is your mommy there?

622
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,935
Well, can you take
a message, sweetie?

623
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:48,272
All right, write this down.

624
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:49,840
In no way...

625
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:04,788
Don't ignore me, Dean.

626
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,787
I didn't know we were entertaining.

627
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:19,556
We're just going
to my room for a while.

628
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,791
Who's the kid?

629
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:23,560
- Oharlie.
- Damn, you're teeny-tiny.

630
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,363
I'm holding him for ransom.

631
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,133
Yeah, I should probably get home.
My mom's getting married tomorrow.

632
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,870
I was married once.

633
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:35,105
Problem was,
if my wife never really...

634
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,607
We're just gonna go inside.

635
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,510
I'm sorry.

636
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,478
Oome on, let's go.

637
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:15,479
Oome here, shitballs.
I'm gonna teach you something.

638
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,783
Oome here.

639
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,251
Oome here.

640
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:28,025
Listen, if someone tries
to kick your ass in high school...

641
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:31,061
To be honest, you're probably
gonna get your ass kicked anyway.

642
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,830
But if you weren't such a pussy,
you could try this.

643
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:37,367
All right. Oome at me
like you're gonna hit me in the chest.

644
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,705
Hit me right here in the chest.
Oome on, hit me right here.

645
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,608
No, man, like really do it
like you got a pair.

646
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:47,211
Really do it.
Oome on, come on.

647
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:50,647
Billy!

648
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,449
That was good. That was good.

649
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:55,085
- He's about half your size.
- Are you all right?

650
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,020
Are you fucking kidding me?

651
00:50:57,087 --> 00:51:00,390
What are we doing here?
We're fucking kidnapping this kid.

652
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,826
Am I the only one
that fucking remembers that?

653
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,429
You're such a dick, Billy.

654
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,080
What the hell is wrong with you?

655
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,053
Billy, get off of him!

656
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,522
Hey!

657
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,060
Who put that knife in the wall?

658
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,263
I did.

659
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,899
- You're gonna fix that.
- It's my room.

660
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,400
No, this is not your room.

661
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,136
This is a room in my house.

662
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,438
This is my room.

663
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,240
So then you can fix it.

664
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:59,016
Oome on. Oome on.

665
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:22,339
- I'm getting concerned about Oharlie.
- Oh, yeah?

666
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:25,609
Yeah, he just seems
so angry lately.

667
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,647
Jeez, it's the florist.

668
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,850
Yeah, you're running
a little behind?

669
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,818
No kidding.
How about a little fired?

670
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:39,022
- How is he with you? Any better?
- I haven't seen him much lately.

671
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,626
- You must've talked yesterday.
- No, we didn't talk at all.

672
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,195
Jerri Falls?

673
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:49,132
Then that is just plain rude. I'm gonna
have to have a little talk with him.

674
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,735
See that one? It's not bad,
if you're on a budget.

675
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,070
What's rude?

676
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,472
Jesus, this woman keeps calling me.

677
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,774
When you picked Oharlie up.

678
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,143
- When?
- From school.

679
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,779
He wasn't there.

680
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,948
What do you mean?
You didn't pick him up?

681
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,684
I figured he walked.
I saw you guys talking last night.

682
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,053
Oome on. This is ridiculous.

683
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,591
Oh, goddamn it.

684
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,126
I see you, Lou!

685
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:19,163
Don't think I don't
see what you're doing.

686
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:22,232
Oan't you see I don't
fucking love you anymore?

687
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:29,606
Let's go. Ohop, chop.

688
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,586
Look at this.

689
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:45,856
The First Oouple of Hillside
right here at my front door.

690
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,325
- Hello.
- Hi, I'm Terri Bratley.

691
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,794
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my fiancê, Michael.

692
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:54,464
Of course, I know the mayor.
It is an honor, sir, an honor.

693
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:57,067
I apologize
for any inconvenience with Oharlie.

694
00:53:57,134 --> 00:54:01,338
It has been such a pleasure
getting to know your son.

695
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,207
He is such a nice boy.

696
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:07,144
- And he's so talented and so nice.
- Thank you.

697
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:10,581
- I really like him, he's lovely.
- Is he all set?

698
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:12,883
- Oharlie!
- Well, actually...

699
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:16,920
They just went
gallivanting off somewhere.

700
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:20,023
I'm sure he's fine.
They're having so much fun together.

701
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:23,126
I'm sure. It's just that I have
a million things to do today.

702
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:26,463
- My God. This house.
- What? What's wrong?

703
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,700
This is where we met.
This is where it all started.

704
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,370
- This is... This is where...
- Oh, you're right, Michael.

705
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:37,875
- You're absolutely right.
- What an amazing coincidence.

706
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,044
Believe me. If I told you
the story of how we met...

707
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,913
- You saw the scar on his head?
- Yes.

708
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,950
He was almost killed
and I rushed over, it was so romantic.

709
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,430
It's the perfect arrangement.

710
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:37,100
I'll design the next development,
he'll fast-track the permits.

711
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,870
It doesn't hurt
that he's so good-looking, right?

712
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:43,006
- A woman only gets married once, right?
- Yes.

713
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,675
And if that doesn't work out,

714
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:47,778
it's a woman's prerogative
to go all out on the next one.

715
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:51,548
Will there be very many
single men at your wedding?

716
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:54,585
- Well, would you like to come?
- I would...

717
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:57,487
- Would that be OK?
- Of course, I don't see why not.

718
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,923
That would be...

719
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:01,592
Oh, my God.

720
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:05,929
Michael, what happened?

721
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:08,398
- Nothing, nothing.
- Did you fall in the pool?

722
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,467
No, I... Yes, I fell in.

723
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,703
I'm gonna get you a towel.

724
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,638
What's the matter with you?

725
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,508
Something big is happening.

726
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,776
What?

727
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:23,413
I feel like there's
another person inside me.

728
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,217
Jesus Ohrist, get a hold of yourself.
This is embarrassing.

729
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:31,622
You should really take your shirt off.
You're gonna catch a cold.

730
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:34,224
Is that good? You're so wet.

731
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,226
We're leaving.

732
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,031
Is he...? Is he OK?

733
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,066
He's fine.
He just hasn't eaten all day.

734
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,370
- He's a diabetic.
- I'm not a diabetic.

735
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:50,007
If your energy level is low,
I have these wonderful vitamins...

736
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:21,138
What the hell's wrong with you?

737
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,410
Psycho.

738
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,886
- Hello?
- Orystal?

739
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:39,256
I got it. Let's just meet at the
Promenade and get this over with.

740
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,327
I don't know how we got here,
but I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

741
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,731
My dad would probably say

742
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,300
there's some great
cosmic reason for all this.

743
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,436
And we'll all be better people, right?

744
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:54,938
Well, I don't know.

745
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:57,908
My dad also says I'm crazy.

746
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:01,078
Dean, you're not crazy.

747
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,950
There are several major book chains
around the country

748
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:10,053
that would probably
disagree with you on that point.

749
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,757
I'm my dad's favorite subject and...

750
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:16,760
I have to go.

751
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,996
- Dean.
- I'll meet you at the mall.

752
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,535
It's just a beer, Mom.

753
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:27,671
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. I trust you.

754
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:32,543
I wonder what that would be like.

755
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,245
If we could just switch roles and...

756
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:39,516
...you could be the parent
and I would be the child

757
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,885
and you could tell me what to do

758
00:58:41,952 --> 00:58:44,955
and I would listen to you
and I would trust you.

759
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:47,691
Are you OK?

760
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,165
I'm supposed to be making
a casserole now

761
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,067
for Troy's memorial service.

762
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,169
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

763
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:03,974
My basic energy level's
been noticeably low lately.

764
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,453
Mom, I'm sorry.

765
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,689
- I have to go.
- Nope.

766
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,758
Do not explain yourself to me,
I told you not to do that.

767
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:11,608
F-17 Tigershark.

768
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:14,545
He's here.

769
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,992
Took you long enough.

770
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:32,362
Here, this is
everything Troy had.

771
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,334
Is this the kid?

772
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,903
Yeah, that's him.

773
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,840
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

774
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:44,541
Fine.

775
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:48,278
Wait a minute. Wait.

776
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:51,348
- What?
- What is this shit?

777
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:54,351
- What? It's all there.
- VeggiForce?

778
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,088
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, this whole bag here.

779
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,190
You trying to give me
stupid vitamins?

780
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,860
They're notjust vitamins.
No, no.

781
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:05,896
This is an entirely new life system.

782
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,170
Billy, leave him alone.

783
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:14,771
- Kick his ass.
- Shit.

784
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,940
Billy, get off of him.

785
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:33,157
Stop! Stop it.
What are you doing to him?

786
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,459
- That dude's crazy.
- I saw the whole thing.

787
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:38,462
- He started hitting for no reason.
- Let go of me!

788
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,864
Get off of me!

789
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:43,433
You stay right here.
Honey, honey call the cops.

790
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,270
Orystal! Hey!

791
01:01:46,336 --> 01:01:49,606
Get off of me! Orystal!

792
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:19,403
OK, so, now, you want to tell me
about this fight at the mall?

793
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,104
No, not really.

794
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:24,041
Dean, make an effort for me, please.

795
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:27,544
I'm sure there is a reasonable
explanation for this, officer.

796
01:02:27,611 --> 01:02:29,646
I'm all ears.

797
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:32,216
Dean?

798
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:35,819
The guy at the mall was Billy.

799
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:38,956
He and the other two forced me
to steal drugs from Troy.

800
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:40,891
Troy? Who's this Troy?

801
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:45,062
- Troy Johnson. He's dead.
- He committed suicide, sir.

802
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,598
I don't understand.

803
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:51,535
I told them no, so to force me to do it,
they kidnapped my brother.

804
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,671
Wait, are you kidding me?
You got a son who's kidnapped?

805
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:57,474
No, wait a second, listen.
They got the wrong kid.

806
01:02:57,541 --> 01:03:01,211
They said if I didn't get the stuff
from Troy, they were gonna kill him.

807
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,947
- You just said Troy was dead.
- He is, officer.

808
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:07,384
- Dean...
- So I did it, only Oharlie...

809
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:11,021
...my little brother, Oharlie,
switched the drugs on me.

810
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,757
And I wound up with a bag
of my mom's VeggiForce.

811
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:16,660
- VeggiForce?
- It's this vitamin line that she hocks.

812
01:03:16,727 --> 01:03:19,163
VeggiForce! I know that stuff.

813
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,465
Right, I know, VeggiForce, right. OK.

814
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:24,735
Yeah. You don't know,
do they make a weight gainer for kids?

815
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,105
- I could check, I guess.
- Anyway, that's why we got in a fight.

816
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:30,674
- 'Oause he wouldn't let the kid go.
- Which kid?

817
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:32,242
The kid who was kidnapped.

818
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,212
OK. I think I understand.

819
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:37,781
You were fighting
with a guy who's kidnapping

820
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:40,350
and drug smuggling
with a guy who killed himself.

821
01:03:40,417 --> 01:03:42,820
- Yeah.
- Well, that's great, Dean, you know?

822
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:46,456
Only there don't happen to be
any reports around here of missing kids,

823
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,193
so how do you explain that?

824
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:53,330
I can't. I can't explain that.

825
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:56,266
Officer, can I...?

826
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,069
What's his name,
this missing kid? What's his name?

827
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:00,671
- Oharlie.
- Oharlie what?

828
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:03,540
Officer Bratley,
could you step outside a minute?

829
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:06,510
- I'd like to talk to you in private.
- Officer Bratley?

830
01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:08,212
Oan you make
some sense out of this?

831
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:11,815
- I believe I can, yes.
- All right.

832
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:16,053
- You stay put.
- Yeah.

833
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:49,086
I kinda wanna go home now.

834
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:54,458
I'm not having fun anymore.

835
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:08,972
Billy.

836
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:21,652
Well, at least
let me set you a plate.

837
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:28,125
Listen, I spoke to a colleague
of mine at the hospital.

838
01:05:28,192 --> 01:05:31,495
These are a stronger version
of what I've already given you,

839
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:34,064
but, listen,
they're perfectly safe, OK, pal?

840
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:49,046
Look, Terri, if I could
just talk to you here.

841
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,882
Michael, I'm just gonna take a bath, OK?

842
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:55,285
- It's been a long day.
- Terri, we have to talk!

843
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:59,022
Michael, I have done absolutely
everything to prepare for our wedding.

844
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:01,425
Everything!
All you have to do is show up.

845
01:06:01,492 --> 01:06:03,861
OK? That's it. Show up.

846
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:11,134
Please don't leave me,
please don't leave me.

847
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:18,375
- You are gonna listen to me.
- No.

848
01:06:18,442 --> 01:06:19,776
It's about the day we met.

849
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:23,814
There's something
I never told you.

850
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,422
Have you seen my son, Oharlie?

851
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:36,693
Hillside is growing.
And this is what it's all about.

852
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:41,098
This new Ocean Orest development
is exactly what...

853
01:06:49,273 --> 01:06:52,309
I am so sorry about this, Mr. Mayor.

854
01:06:53,277 --> 01:06:54,478
Michael.

855
01:06:55,913 --> 01:06:57,314
I'm Terri.

856
01:06:57,381 --> 01:07:01,218
Bratley,
from Terri's Interior Visions and...

857
01:07:01,285 --> 01:07:04,755
...I actually designed all of this.

858
01:07:04,822 --> 01:07:07,224
Wonderful.

859
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:20,771
I feel... I feel so different.

860
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:41,758
Look at this. The footprints...

861
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:43,694
- Yeah?
- Look, it's like...

862
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,864
- Yeah, look at this.
- Like dolphins.

863
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:49,266
Dolphins, that's right.

864
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,834
Dolphin.

865
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:08,252
"To begin, each of us alike,
to actually conjure magic.

866
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:13,991
This must finally be our goal
as free-willed beings.

867
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:18,896
The joyous acceptance
of a pure state of synchronicity,

868
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:24,368
through the seemingly random
happy accidents of our lives. "

869
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:27,171
Don't you see?

870
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:29,540
Nothing is random.

871
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:34,144
Nothing happens by chance.
There is a power at work here.

872
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:36,980
A power greater than all of us.

873
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:41,718
Don't you see what this means?

874
01:08:44,788 --> 01:08:46,757
I just love you so much.

875
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:55,866
I was so scared.

876
01:09:01,672 --> 01:09:03,807
Tomorrow...

877
01:09:03,874 --> 01:09:07,077
...I'll show you everything.

878
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:56,793
Yes, I am Dr. Stiffle. Yeah.

879
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,796
You know my book?
So you've heard of me?

880
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,965
And my book.

881
01:10:02,032 --> 01:10:05,435
Yes, yes. I see that
you are familiar with my work.

882
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:16,974
"To actually conjure magic. "

883
01:13:17,261 --> 01:13:19,796
- Terri?
- Honey.

884
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,203
Now, do you see my vision?

885
01:13:35,012 --> 01:13:37,381
Dean, Oharlie, breakfast.

886
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:53,630
- It's not coming off.
- I thought you understood.

887
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:57,468
Do we have any paint thinner?
Go to the garage and look for some.

888
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:59,403
- Paint thinner.
- Paint thinner?

889
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:01,238
Or maybe some white paint?

890
01:14:01,305 --> 01:14:04,408
We'll just put a coat
of white paint over all of it...

891
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:07,177
- And no one'll see it.
- You're not making any sense.

892
01:14:07,244 --> 01:14:10,981
- Why in the world would you do that?
- Don't answer it.

893
01:14:11,048 --> 01:14:13,917
- Don't answer it.
- You need to calm down.

894
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:18,655
- Where's the beautiful bride?
- Hello. Oome in.

895
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:22,226
How wonderful, the dress.

896
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:08,639
Guys, I really need to
talk to you about something.

897
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:10,407
Where are the keys?

898
01:15:10,474 --> 01:15:12,376
It's about that kid, Oharlie.

899
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:15,646
I think we kinda kidnapped him.

900
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:17,080
Here they are.

901
01:15:17,114 --> 01:15:19,483
That's not funny, Lee.

902
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:21,852
Listen to me!

903
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:24,354
We've had him since Friday.

904
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:27,758
I don't know what to do.

905
01:15:27,825 --> 01:15:31,028
All right, let's just calm down.
I'm sure you didn't have a part

906
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:33,330
of whatever those kids
are doing down there.

907
01:15:33,397 --> 01:15:36,767
Itjust started out as a joke. I didn't
think Billy was really gonna do it.

908
01:15:36,834 --> 01:15:38,869
- A joke?
- Wait a minute.

909
01:15:38,936 --> 01:15:41,171
Is this a kidnapping or not?

910
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:43,407
That sort of thing
doesn't happen around here.

911
01:15:43,474 --> 01:15:45,676
If it is,
I'm going to have to call the police.

912
01:15:45,742 --> 01:15:47,644
- The police?
- In our home?

913
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,646
Just a minute.
I'm talking to Lee.

914
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:53,484
Lee, is it a joke or not?

915
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:57,921
No. It's nothing.

916
01:15:57,988 --> 01:16:00,891
No, you don't have to call anybody.

917
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:05,829
Well, I, for one,
did not find that very funny at all.

918
01:16:05,896 --> 01:16:07,898
And neither would a top-tier school.

919
01:16:07,965 --> 01:16:10,534
You guys, just go.

920
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:13,137
Everything is totally fine.

921
01:16:13,203 --> 01:16:14,805
Our little man.

922
01:16:16,306 --> 01:16:19,643
Yeah, we'll always be here for you.

923
01:16:21,211 --> 01:16:24,915
I don't know why
it came to me as a dolphin.

924
01:16:24,982 --> 01:16:29,186
It's just a sign.
It could have been anything.

925
01:16:29,253 --> 01:16:32,222
But now I'm aware
of a connection

926
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:34,224
that I didn't
even know was missing.

927
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:36,760
Maybe we've all been missing it.

928
01:16:36,827 --> 01:16:38,796
Lou, I'm so glad you're here.

929
01:16:38,862 --> 01:16:41,832
- We need to talk.
- Now is not a good time.

930
01:16:41,899 --> 01:16:44,768
Talk to Lou. We need
to get some closure here.

931
01:16:44,835 --> 01:16:47,404
Olosure? Where's Oharlie?
Where is he?

932
01:16:47,471 --> 01:16:50,174
Excuse me, could you help me
hold up this end, please?

933
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:52,209
Hey, I'm getting married today.

934
01:16:52,276 --> 01:16:55,412
I love Michael now,
I thought I made that perfectly clear.

935
01:16:57,815 --> 01:16:59,983
- Where is Oharlie?
- I don't know...

936
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:03,320
- Why don't you know? Is he missing?
- No, he's not missing!

937
01:17:03,353 --> 01:17:06,290
- Where is he?
- He is just out gallivanting.

938
01:17:06,356 --> 01:17:09,259
Gosh, darn it, honey,
you pierced his dorsal.

939
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:14,465
Let's see some fuckin' blood, already.

940
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:30,080
I probably would've been with some
football player, if I hadn't met you.

941
01:17:30,147 --> 01:17:34,218
And I guess I just want to thank you
for keeping it interesting for me.

942
01:17:34,284 --> 01:17:37,421
It's definitely not the usual thing.

943
01:17:37,488 --> 01:17:40,090
Who wants that, right?

944
01:17:40,157 --> 01:17:42,426
What the fuck
are you talking about?

945
01:17:42,493 --> 01:17:44,728
Let's just stop, Billy.

946
01:17:44,795 --> 01:17:48,098
Let's just quit this thing with Oharlie,
forget about the pills.

947
01:17:48,198 --> 01:17:51,235
And everything. Let's just stop.

948
01:17:51,301 --> 01:17:53,203
OK?

949
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:55,672
It's over.

950
01:17:56,707 --> 01:17:58,242
Sit down!

951
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:07,251
Guess it doesn't matter what you think.

952
01:18:08,452 --> 01:18:10,020
Lee.

953
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:19,463
Good. Sit right down,
what can I get you?

954
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,099
Oharlie, Bill!
It's getting cold.

955
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:25,669
Good morning.

956
01:18:25,736 --> 01:18:28,605
Do you think that's appropriate
for a memorial service?

957
01:18:28,672 --> 01:18:31,175
I think I'll shoot on over
to the wedding instead.

958
01:18:31,241 --> 01:18:32,810
What are you talking about?

959
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:35,579
I covered death
extensively in my first two books.

960
01:18:35,646 --> 01:18:38,482
I've done grieving to death.

961
01:18:38,549 --> 01:18:40,784
Maybe I'll get a few insights
at the wedding.

962
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:43,654
Multiple marriage couples.
Gotta be a new book in there.

963
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,223
How is it going to look
if we don't go to the memorial?

964
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:48,458
If it means that much,
you go ahead and go.

965
01:18:48,525 --> 01:18:50,594
We should all go
together as a family.

966
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:54,665
I understand your feelings. Maybe
you could make the same effort for me.

967
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,934
Dean, it looks like
you have a choice to make.

968
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,070
The wedding with him
or the memorial with me.

969
01:19:00,137 --> 01:19:04,208
Dean, it's your decision,
him or me.

970
01:19:04,274 --> 01:19:06,143
I think it's best
if he stayed home today.

971
01:19:06,243 --> 01:19:08,812
He can make up his mind.
He's practically an adult.

972
01:19:08,879 --> 01:19:12,783
As a therapist, it's my opinion
that he should avoid anything upsetting.

973
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:16,820
As a mother, it's fucking important he
learn how to function in the real world.

974
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:20,424
I'm not going to get into an argument
with you now.

975
01:19:20,491 --> 01:19:23,494
Let's not argue.
Let's sit down and have a meal together.

976
01:20:15,379 --> 01:20:17,381
- Hello?
- Hi, is Dean here?

977
01:20:18,549 --> 01:20:21,518
- It's for school.
- Well, go ahead then.

978
01:20:21,585 --> 01:20:23,654
He's up the stairs
at the end of the hall.

979
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,356
Oould you do me a favor?

980
01:20:26,423 --> 01:20:30,194
Would you get him to turn down his
stereo down a bit? Thanks so much.

981
01:20:51,248 --> 01:20:52,649
Orystal, come on in.

982
01:20:55,886 --> 01:20:57,754
Dean, I need your help.

983
01:20:58,989 --> 01:21:02,759
- It's Troy, look, Troy's back.
- That's not funny.

984
01:21:02,826 --> 01:21:06,096
Orystal, you remember Troy?
You guys were friends, right?

985
01:21:06,163 --> 01:21:08,765
She wasn't my friend.
Is that what she said?

986
01:21:08,832 --> 01:21:12,269
Oh, Troy says
you guys weren't friends.

987
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,839
Dean, there's nobody here.

988
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:17,908
Tell her to fuck off.

989
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:21,578
I don't think Troy wants
to see you right now.

990
01:21:21,678 --> 01:21:24,047
Troy is dead.
I mean, he killed himself.

991
01:21:24,148 --> 01:21:26,650
No, no, no. He's back.
He's not dead.

992
01:21:26,717 --> 01:21:29,653
- Troy, tell her you're not dead.
- I am not dead.

993
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,588
You see, Orystal?

994
01:21:31,655 --> 01:21:34,391
But who could call this a life?

995
01:21:35,926 --> 01:21:37,127
Here we go.

996
01:21:55,379 --> 01:21:57,981
- Troy?
- Dean, stop it.

997
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:00,717
What do you want?

998
01:22:00,784 --> 01:22:04,788
Look, this wasn't my fault, OK?

999
01:22:05,856 --> 01:22:07,958
He didn't even tell me, OK?

1000
01:22:08,025 --> 01:22:09,693
He was my best friend,

1001
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:13,464
and he didn't even tell me
he was gonna kill himself.

1002
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:16,099
I could've stopped him.

1003
01:22:17,634 --> 01:22:21,305
I wish I could've stopped him.

1004
01:22:25,242 --> 01:22:27,511
I'm sorry.

1005
01:22:37,754 --> 01:22:39,690
Oharlie's gonna get hurt.

1006
01:22:49,766 --> 01:22:51,802
Nobody else cares.

1007
01:23:42,252 --> 01:23:44,087
- We become adults.
- OK.

1008
01:23:44,154 --> 01:23:46,390
And as adults, we formulate a plan.

1009
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:48,759
This is what I need
in order to be happy,

1010
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:53,063
or this is what I will struggle
and sacrifice and bleed for.

1011
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:56,400
But what we really need
to do is stop struggling

1012
01:23:56,467 --> 01:23:59,603
and recognize that there
is a greater plan for us all.

1013
01:24:00,771 --> 01:24:04,074
- Is it really that easy?
- It's so clear to me, Jerri.

1014
01:24:04,141 --> 01:24:06,877
What we've been searching
for is right there,

1015
01:24:06,944 --> 01:24:11,181
staring us in the face.
We just have to reach out and grab it.

1016
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:15,719
Hello.

1017
01:24:15,786 --> 01:24:18,455
Dr. Bill Stiffle?

1018
01:24:19,623 --> 01:24:23,894
In my home?
Is this really possible?

1019
01:24:23,961 --> 01:24:26,063
Yes, yes.

1020
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:28,232
I see that you are
familiar with my work.

1021
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:29,867
I just want you to know

1022
01:24:29,933 --> 01:24:33,070
that none of this would have
been possible without you.

1023
01:25:10,407 --> 01:25:12,776
Whoa! What the hell's
going on here?

1024
01:25:12,843 --> 01:25:15,112
If they find him,
they know we kidnapped him!

1025
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:17,848
If they know we kidnapped him,
our lives are ruined.

1026
01:25:17,915 --> 01:25:20,951
- We go to prison.
- What do you want to do?

1027
01:25:20,984 --> 01:25:23,754
- I'm gonna kill him?
- Yeah.

1028
01:25:24,788 --> 01:25:26,757
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1029
01:25:26,824 --> 01:25:27,758
Get him, Lee!

1030
01:25:28,892 --> 01:25:30,494
Kill him!

1031
01:26:07,397 --> 01:26:09,399
Yeah, motherfucker!

1032
01:26:14,204 --> 01:26:17,407
- He won't die!
- You are such a pussy.

1033
01:26:17,474 --> 01:26:19,877
He's stronger than he looks.

1034
01:26:19,977 --> 01:26:21,178
You do it, then.

1035
01:26:21,245 --> 01:26:23,313
No fucking way, Lee.

1036
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:27,484
Here.

1037
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:35,058
Take it.

1038
01:26:42,132 --> 01:26:44,902
What if he tries to grab
the knife away from me?

1039
01:26:44,968 --> 01:26:47,171
- Just fucking stab him quick.
- Like where?

1040
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:50,808
- Stab him in the fucking stomach.
- He's gonna bleed all over the floor.

1041
01:26:50,841 --> 01:26:53,210
- Who fucking cares! Do it!
- Shut up!

1042
01:26:53,277 --> 01:26:55,145
Oome on, you little pussy. Do it!

1043
01:26:55,212 --> 01:26:57,781
- Don't push me.
- Stab him. Fucking kill him!

1044
01:26:59,683 --> 01:27:03,554
- Oh, shit!
- You stabbed me in the stomach!

1045
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,522
I did it. I did it, Billy.

1046
01:27:05,622 --> 01:27:08,058
- Is it deep?
- Is it deep, Oharlie?

1047
01:27:09,226 --> 01:27:10,294
Fuck you!

1048
01:27:11,228 --> 01:27:13,597
- It isn't deep.
- Well, fucking pardon me!

1049
01:27:13,697 --> 01:27:16,366
Do it again!
Oome on, man! Do it!

1050
01:27:28,846 --> 01:27:31,748
- Do it again, Lee. Do it, man!
- Shut up!

1051
01:27:31,815 --> 01:27:33,550
Get him! Do it!

1052
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,888
Holy shit!

1053
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:40,624
- Let go of the knife.
- Fucking stab him again!

1054
01:27:40,691 --> 01:27:42,726
- Let go!
- Stab him!

1055
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:45,129
- Fucking kill him.
- What are you doing!

1056
01:27:54,671 --> 01:27:56,707
My eye!

1057
01:27:56,773 --> 01:27:58,842
Oh, shit!

1058
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:01,145
Help!

1059
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:06,483
Help me!

1060
01:28:07,284 --> 01:28:08,952
Gonna kill you!

1061
01:28:11,622 --> 01:28:13,023
Gonna fucking kill you!

1062
01:28:13,123 --> 01:28:15,192
Wait. Oharlie, hold on.

1063
01:28:15,225 --> 01:28:18,328
Yeah, it's not my fault.
It's not like I wanted to do this.

1064
01:28:18,395 --> 01:28:20,664
Oharlie, it's over.

1065
01:28:20,731 --> 01:28:22,933
- Get out of the way.
- Give me the knife.

1066
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,169
Get the hell out of the way.

1067
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:28,238
Don't ignore me, Oharlie.

1068
01:28:31,341 --> 01:28:32,676
I want to help you.

1069
01:28:32,743 --> 01:28:37,114
Does it look like I need
your fucking help?

1070
01:29:04,408 --> 01:29:06,677
My eye!

1071
01:29:15,953 --> 01:29:17,187
Help!

1072
01:29:17,254 --> 01:29:19,756
Somebody help me!

1073
01:29:20,691 --> 01:29:22,826
I can't see!

1074
01:29:34,104 --> 01:29:36,707
Somebody help me!

1075
01:29:37,508 --> 01:29:40,043
Somebody help me!

1076
01:29:41,578 --> 01:29:43,480
I'm blind!

1077
01:29:48,118 --> 01:29:50,854
Help me!

1078
01:29:59,863 --> 01:30:02,366
Somebody help me!

1079
01:30:33,464 --> 01:30:36,733
Twin engine P-38 Lightning.

1080
01:30:49,346 --> 01:30:51,248
My God! Where the hell
have you been?

1081
01:30:51,315 --> 01:30:53,684
- What happened to you?
- I was kidnapped, Dad.

1082
01:30:53,784 --> 01:30:56,620
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!
Are you OK?

1083
01:30:56,687 --> 01:30:59,123
No, he's not OK.
He just told me he was kidnapped.

1084
01:30:59,189 --> 01:31:01,959
- You didn't even know.
- Don't try to blame this on me.

1085
01:31:02,025 --> 01:31:04,728
- Michael.
- What kind of father are you?

1086
01:31:04,761 --> 01:31:09,032
- I'm a good father.
- I'm a good mother. That's right.

1087
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,352
It's my fault.

1088
01:32:04,488 --> 01:32:06,390
I know it is.

1089
01:32:10,227 --> 01:32:12,396
I didn't even know him.

1090
01:32:14,765 --> 01:32:17,100
I didn't know my own son.

1091
01:32:25,109 --> 01:32:28,879
Troy wanted to play guitar
in a rock band.

1092
01:32:31,048 --> 01:32:32,950
Be famous.

1093
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:37,087
But he knew he wasn't any good.

1094
01:32:37,154 --> 01:32:39,790
And he felt stupid
for wishing that.

1095
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:45,062
He had a crush on this girl
since he was 13...

1096
01:32:46,597 --> 01:32:49,199
...that he never talked to.

1097
01:32:50,534 --> 01:32:52,436
But he probably
wished he would've.

1098
01:32:55,506 --> 01:32:57,374
He liked you.

1099
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:02,179
But he felt sorry for you and...

1100
01:33:04,882 --> 01:33:07,618
...he was afraid
that he'd be like his dad.

1101
01:33:11,688 --> 01:33:15,192
He was really, really smart.

1102
01:33:15,225 --> 01:33:19,830
But he kept all
his ideas to himself,

1103
01:33:21,331 --> 01:33:23,200
unless you asked.

1104
01:33:24,201 --> 01:33:29,039
And he took great pictures of people
without them even knowing.

1105
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:36,513
I miss him, you know?

1106
01:33:39,883 --> 01:33:43,454
He was my friend.
He was my best friend.

1107
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:48,792
And I hate myself,

1108
01:33:49,927 --> 01:33:53,163
that I didn't even know
he was about to do this.

1109
01:34:04,007 --> 01:34:06,276
Thank you.

1110
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,201
Lee explained how it happened.

1111
01:34:31,268 --> 01:34:33,637
He tried to be as helpful as he could.

1112
01:34:33,737 --> 01:34:36,707
Yes, ma'am. It was Billy's idea.

1113
01:34:36,774 --> 01:34:39,176
He said he'd kill me if I told anyone.

1114
01:34:44,314 --> 01:34:46,650
And so Billy learned not to be a bully.

1115
01:34:54,358 --> 01:34:57,060
Dr. Stiffle's book tour
kept him away.

1116
01:35:00,297 --> 01:35:02,199
Are there any questions?

1117
01:35:04,501 --> 01:35:05,702
Anything?

1118
01:35:07,538 --> 01:35:09,206
Anybody?

1119
01:35:09,406 --> 01:35:13,777
Mrs. Stiffle finally found a family
that truly appreciated her.

1120
01:35:13,844 --> 01:35:18,449
We are a part
of the VeggiForce family.

1121
01:35:18,515 --> 01:35:20,918
All of us together,

1122
01:35:20,984 --> 01:35:24,988
working for an entirely
new life system!

1123
01:35:26,590 --> 01:35:28,425
Terri got the worst of it.

1124
01:35:28,492 --> 01:35:31,829
I'm just asking you to have
the smallest amount of vision.

1125
01:35:31,929 --> 01:35:34,064
Her vision was never realized.

1126
01:35:34,131 --> 01:35:35,332
Please!

1127
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:37,734
The mayor got out of politics for good.

1128
01:35:37,801 --> 01:35:41,004
Well, in terms
of the physical execution,

1129
01:35:41,071 --> 01:35:44,708
there's only one guiding principle
that I rely on,

1130
01:35:44,942 --> 01:35:47,277
and that's balance.

1131
01:35:47,344 --> 01:35:50,214
I mean, it's all about balance.

1132
01:35:50,314 --> 01:35:51,715
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

1133
01:35:55,185 --> 01:35:58,088
And Oharlie was sent
to live with his father.

1134
01:35:58,155 --> 01:36:00,524
Breathe! Oome on,
get tough. Get tough.

1135
01:36:00,591 --> 01:36:03,727
Get tough. Those people
are gonna beat the crap out of you.

1136
01:36:03,794 --> 01:36:08,332
Punch, smack that guy with both hands,
right in the mouth.

1137
01:36:08,398 --> 01:36:11,635
Oome on, push!
Yeah. That's it, that's it.

1138
01:36:11,702 --> 01:36:15,072
Everyone says he's better off now.

1139
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:19,409
Dean and Orystal escaped.

1140
01:36:21,178 --> 01:36:23,747
Together.

1141
01:36:26,283 --> 01:36:27,985
And as for me...

1142
01:36:29,386 --> 01:36:32,689
I was dead...
but now I live again.

1143
01:36:36,026 --> 01:36:38,428
So I will do what I have to,

1144
01:36:38,529 --> 01:36:42,499
in this world of freaks
and sub-human creatures.

1145
01:36:42,566 --> 01:36:46,069
And this time,
I will not be ignored.

1146
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:49,807
I am...

1147
01:36:49,873 --> 01:36:52,976
...the chumscrubber.

1148
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:59,976
