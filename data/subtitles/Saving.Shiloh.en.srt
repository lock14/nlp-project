1
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:51,097
<i>It's been a year since Shiloh
came to live with me and my family.</i>

2
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:53,569
<i>He used to belong to Judd Travers.</i>

3
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,307
<i>Judd treated him so bad...</i>

4
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,041
<i>... that Shiloh had marks all over
his body when I found him.</i>

5
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:07,819
<i>I used to think that Judd was gonna come
in the middle of the night and take Shiloh.</i>

6
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,756
<i>But things changed
after Judd's truck accident.</i>

7
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:14,192
<i>He even pet Shiloh for the first time.</i>

8
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,333
Okay, darlings. Dinner's waiting.

9
00:02:20,603 --> 00:02:22,628
Come on, Becky.

10
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,941
<i>Strange thing about this world, though.</i>

11
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,549
<i>Just when you start to feel safe...</i>

12
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:44,320
<i>... something that you never imagined
can take you by surprise.</i>

13
00:02:55,204 --> 00:03:00,699
- Mommy, I want a bicycle.
- We can't afford one right now, Becky.

14
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:02,902
Maybe Santa will bring
you one for Christmas.

15
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,478
- Really?
- Sure.

16
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:07,781
- But that's still six months away.
- I can wait.

17
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,942
- There's no such thing as Santa Claus.
- There is too.

18
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,486
No, there ain't.
Ma, is Santa Claus real?

19
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:18,991
Well, must be someone
bringing all those toys.

20
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:24,065
I'll get it.

21
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:29,463
Hi, Judd.

22
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:35,675
Marty. Brought something
for your ma to cook up.

23
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:38,939
Sort of a thank you
for helping a neighbor out.

24
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,617
Mom. Mom, Judd's here.

25
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:45,553
And he brought you a present.

26
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,622
- A present? What is it?
- It's something good to eat.

27
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,259
Well, that's so nice of you, Judd.

28
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:54,627
Would you like to come in,
have a cup of coffee?

29
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:00,364
I reckon it ain't the right thing to do
without Ray being here.

30
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,670
- I think it'd be all right.
- Well, I'm fine right here.

31
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,705
All right, then.

32
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:12,336
- How you feeling?
- My leg's healing up right nicely.

33
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:15,441
Still have to shoot from my porch.

34
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:16,945
What is it?

35
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:21,013
It's a couple of squirrels.
They already bled.

36
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:24,655
Maybe Marty and Ray
can skin them later on.

37
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:29,059
- I touched a dead squirrel? Oh, my God.
- Dara Lynn.

38
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,028
I been eating them my whole life.

39
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:34,028
They bake a right tasty stew.

40
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:36,694
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Dara Lynn.

41
00:04:36,872 --> 00:04:39,500
- You're the meanest man!
- Now, Becky.

42
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:43,577
- He is. He shot some pretty little squirrels.
- That's enough. Upstairs, both of you.

43
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,714
- But, Mom...
- Right now.

44
00:04:49,752 --> 00:04:51,845
I'm sorry, Judd.

45
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:55,149
I don't know what's wrong
with squirrels.

46
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:59,961
- I been eating them my whole life.
- There's nothing wrong with them.

47
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,825
And I appreciate your thinking of us.

48
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:08,437
- The girls are just not used to it, that's all.
- Maybe you should teach them.

49
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,171
You're right, maybe I should.

50
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,970
Well...

51
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,409
...I better be moving along.

52
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:24,777
See you around.

53
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:26,945
- Bye, now, Judd.
- Bye.

54
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,095
I've never been so embarrassed
in all my life.

55
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,962
Well, at least you never brought
anybody a couple of dead squirrels.

56
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:49,408
Daddy, Judd is so disgusting.
He's all bruised up and he's so mean.

57
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:52,877
- Dara Lynn, that's no way to talk.
- You said so yourself, Daddy.

58
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:54,710
Well, then, I was wrong.

59
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:59,387
He's a neighbor, and a darn side better one
than he was just a sort time ago.

60
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:02,046
There's just too much bad talk
around town about Judd.

61
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:05,921
- Like what?
- Like he got off too easy for drunk driving.

62
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:09,155
Some people figure if they give him
a hard time, he'll move away.

63
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:10,992
And then what if he doesn't?

64
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,166
The meaner folks are to him,
the meaner he's liable to be.

65
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:17,938
Soon as he gets his leg all healed,
he'll be back to his old rotten self.

66
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:20,769
- Dara Lynn, what did I say?
- Can't we just leave him be?

67
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:22,342
I think he's changed.

68
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:27,042
Sorry.

69
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,221
<i>When Doc Wallace passed away
last winter, it was real sad for everybody.</i>

70
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:42,990
<i>He was a friend and teacher
to our whole town.</i>

71
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,332
<i>I know how my friend Sam must feel,
because Doc felt like my grandfather too.</i>

72
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,472
There we go.

73
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:05,043
- How's your Grandma doing, Sam?
- Well, she's having a hard time.

74
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:08,657
I mean, they were married for 47 years.

75
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:12,590
But she's got the store,
so that keeps her busy.

76
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,564
- What about you?
- I miss him.

77
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,796
- Yeah, so do I.
- I know you do.

78
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,768
He loved you a lot, Marty.

79
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:26,237
He saved Shiloh's life.

80
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,877
I'll never forget that.

81
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:38,110
Where'd you get that, Shiloh?

82
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:41,350
He was over in that part of the woods.

83
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,325
That's weird.

84
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:50,431
Some car just left here,
middle of nowhere.

85
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:54,599
We should tell the sheriff.

86
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:14,555
The sheriff's inspecting the car,
inside and out.

87
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,918
My dad said it belongs
to a guy from Bens Run.

88
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:20,721
- Well, why'd he leave it there?
- Who knows.

89
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:24,627
But the guy got into a fight
with Judd Travers in a bar just before...

90
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,530
...and now it turns out he's missing.
- What?

91
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:29,432
How come no one said anything before?

92
00:08:29,605 --> 00:08:33,701
- They thought he took a trip or something.
- Yeah, he took a trip all right.

93
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:36,668
Look, we don't know
anything about this.

94
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,746
You can't go convicting a man
of a crime without evidence.

95
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:42,941
We don't even know where the guy is.
He might just be out of town.

96
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:46,713
Jeez, Marty. What will it take to
convince you that Judd's a bad guy?

97
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:51,258
I ain't saying he's good. Just doesn't seem
like the kind of guy who could kill someone.

98
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:55,921
That's what they always say about a killer.
"He was such a quiet guy, seemed nice."

99
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:59,261
Well, Judd sure isn't quiet,
and he definitely doesn't seem nice.

100
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:02,063
Judd couldn't have done nothing
to him, had a broken leg.

101
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:06,004
That's just it. The man's been missing
since before Judd's accident.

102
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:17,413
Today we're studying
the Sixth Amendment.

103
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:21,448
Now, in our country, you cannot be
convicted of a crime without a fair trial.

104
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:25,617
Marty, what do you think it means
to have a fair trial?

105
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,433
Well, I guess it means that someone gets
to defend themself the best they can...

106
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:39,339
...and then the jury decides the verdict
on the evidence they're given.

107
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:42,642
That's exactly right, Marty.
You'd make a good lawyer someday.

108
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,211
Well, I wanna be a vet when I grow up.

109
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:49,181
David's the one who wants to be a lawyer
because he likes to hear himself talk.

110
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,747
You guys.

111
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:01,762
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah. You're not nervous, are you?

112
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,694
The police just questioned him
about the man from Bens Run.

113
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:07,836
Mom, you don't think that Judd
had anything to do with that.

114
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:10,267
If I did, you wouldn't be going.

115
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:13,969
He's probably not very happy
about all that gossip.

116
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,204
I just want you to thank him for bringing
the squirrels and come on back.

117
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,872
Should I tell him that I almost threw up
helping Dad skin the squirrels?

118
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:24,315
- And that now I'm vegetarian?
- You're very funny.

119
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,386
I'm serious, Mom.

120
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,439
You can cross the bridge.

121
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,604
Judd's never gonna hurt you again.

122
00:10:54,616 --> 00:10:56,516
All right, boy, you stay.

123
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,859
<i>Shiloh won't cross the bridge...</i>

124
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,329
<i>... because he remembers
how Judd was so mean to him.</i>

125
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:17,199
<i>He caged him and hit him so hard,
Shiloh ran away.</i>

126
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:39,086
Hush up! What you barking at, huh?

127
00:11:41,163 --> 00:11:45,031
- What you want?
- Ma wanted me to bring over the stew.

128
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,000
- Thought you ought to have some of it.
- It's real tasty, right?

129
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:56,707
Well, we don't actually eat much meat,
but Ma didn't want this to go to waste.

130
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,905
So y'all don't like it,
so you send it over here to me?

131
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:02,778
No, we like it fine.
We just wanted you to have some.

132
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,942
I had two helpings.

133
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:06,412
You did?

134
00:12:08,524 --> 00:12:11,584
You tell your ma she can have
some more anytime she wants some.

135
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,026
Squirrel is always in season. I just
pick them right out of them trees there.

136
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:19,167
- I'll tell her.
- All right.

137
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:29,942
I got a new theory
about Judd's accident.

138
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:33,709
Man gets into a fight with Judd,
he goes missing.

139
00:12:36,552 --> 00:12:39,646
- Judd killed him, then crashed on purpose.
- What?

140
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:42,655
Judd was trying to wreck
the evidence along with his truck.

141
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:45,851
- So he planned his truck accident?
- Yes.

142
00:12:46,028 --> 00:12:47,325
Here's how I figure.

143
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:51,023
Judd and the man continue their fight
someplace else, and Judd kills him.

144
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,395
Maybe he didn't mean to, but he did.

145
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:56,129
Throws the body in the back
of his pickup, buries it...

146
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:59,706
...then makes it look like an accident,
so they'll think the blood is his.

147
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,241
It just doesn't make any sense.
It's a bad plan.

148
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:04,675
Who said Judd would come up
with a good plan?

149
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:08,339
Bad guys always come up with stupid
schemes. That's why they get caught.

150
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:13,587
Now, we gotta check out Judd's truck.
I bet we find blood on the seats.

151
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:15,655
If there was blood, it was Judd's.

152
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:18,315
Whelan's Garage fixed up
the truck after the accident.

153
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:21,190
Cleaned it inside and out.
Any evidence would be long gone.

154
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,558
What kind of detective are you, Marty?

155
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:26,496
You gotta be suspicious
if you're gonna do detective work.

156
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:29,865
What's wrong with looking by the bank
where Judd's truck went down...

157
00:13:30,038 --> 00:13:32,939
...just to see what we can find?
- I suppose we can do that.

158
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:36,168
But that don't mean I believe
one word of what you say.

159
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,599
Okay, okay, sniff.

160
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:04,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm telling him to sniff.

161
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:09,140
If there was a dead body around here,
I bet this dog could smell it.

162
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:12,303
After all, this is where Judd
had his quote "accident."

163
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:14,745
So this is where he would've
buried the body.

164
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,943
Shiloh don't even know the word "sniff."

165
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:21,017
Sniff. Do it like this:

166
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:28,188
- You're such a bozo.
- I'll get you for that.

167
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:29,796
Come on.

168
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:42,739
- Marty.
- What?

169
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:46,137
What do you got, Shiloh?

170
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:48,443
Hey, look at this, Marty.

171
00:14:54,222 --> 00:14:56,816
This boot had the foot
of a dead man in it.

172
00:14:56,992 --> 00:14:59,324
And I suspect a body is nearby.

173
00:15:01,863 --> 00:15:04,889
- Murder funny to you, Marty?
- You don't know whose boot that is.

174
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,559
Could be anybody's. Even if it does
belong to the man from Bens Run...

175
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,295
...even if Judd did murder him...

176
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,771
...just because he wrecked his truck
don't mean it's where he's buried.

177
00:15:13,942 --> 00:15:17,776
- One has nothing to do with the other.
- Criminals always return to the crime scene.

178
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:21,438
- Judd's conscience drove him here.
- lf Judd drove here to cover the crime...

179
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:23,881
...why would he purposely
wreck his truck?

180
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:26,020
That would draw suspicion,
it's ridiculous.

181
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:30,722
I will give you one thing. He might have
buried the body someplace else.

182
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:35,591
The accident doesn't have to be connected
to the crime for Judd to be guilty.

183
00:15:37,065 --> 00:15:40,364
- We ought to go.
- But keep the boot.

184
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,562
Come on, boy.

185
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:19,435
Good work, Marty. I wouldn't wanna be
a vet's assistant. Harder than being a vet.

186
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:24,540
Doc Collins, you know now
that Judd's got his dogs back.

187
00:16:24,846 --> 00:16:27,007
How can he keep them
from getting mean again?

188
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:32,150
Well, just like folks,
you can't tell what they'll do.

189
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,687
Some folks grow up treated badly,
and they turn out real nice.

190
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:39,258
Others, they lash out, wanna treat
everybody the way they were treated.

191
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:43,489
- Same with a dog.
- So, what should Judd do?

192
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:46,099
Fence the yard, so he doesn't
have to chain them.

193
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:48,463
When you chain a dog,
he knows he can't fight...

194
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:50,662
...so he acts as ferocious as he can.

195
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:53,672
He should stop kicking them
or beating them with a stick...

196
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:55,707
...but that takes common sense.

197
00:16:58,113 --> 00:17:00,479
Shake, Shiloh. Shake. Shake.

198
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:03,641
Good boy. Good boy.

199
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:06,219
Marty, help set the table.

200
00:17:06,388 --> 00:17:09,721
Mrs. Wallace said she invited Judd
for dinner for Saturday night...

201
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:13,292
...and he said he was going away.
She doesn't believe him, though.

202
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:16,397
- Why not?
- What friends does he have?

203
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:20,560
I think he made the whole thing up
so nobody would feel sorry for him.

204
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:22,897
Why don't we have Judd here
for Sunday dinner?

205
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:26,802
- Yuck, are you crazy?
- No, it's just the right thing to do, that's all.

206
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:28,567
That's a good idea, Marty...

207
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:31,872
...but this Sunday we're going to
Clarksburg to visit Aunt Hettie...

208
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:35,107
...and then we're gonna go see
Grandma Preston at the nursing home.

209
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:38,245
Not the whole day. Please?

210
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:42,555
I don't wanna sit in a nursing house
with a old woman who steals false teeth.

211
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:46,751
Dara Lynn, you know better than
to talk about your grandma like that.

212
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:50,386
If she had her mind back,
she wouldn't do half the things she does.

213
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:55,296
But it's not fair that Aunt Hettie has to
spend every weekend alone with Grandma.

214
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:57,538
Goodbye, weekend.

215
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:06,704
Your turn, Shiloh.

216
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:18,354
Dad!

217
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:24,054
- Marty, was that gunshots?
- I think so.

218
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:27,133
- Sounded close. Where'd it come from?
- I'm not sure.

219
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:30,430
But it sounded like it was on
our property. What should we do?

220
00:18:30,605 --> 00:18:33,631
Nothing for now. Probably just
somebody out shooting at rabbits.

221
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,108
- You kids come on inside and play.
- Come on, Becky.

222
00:18:51,493 --> 00:18:53,723
I'm gonna go visit Judd,
see how he's doing.

223
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:57,422
- Why not just call him on the phone?
- Maybe I can help him out or something.

224
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:01,768
- All right, but don't be gone too long.
- All right, bye.

225
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:05,505
Come on, Shiloh. Come on.

226
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,928
Come with me. Come on, boy.

227
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,602
I wish there was some way
you wouldn't be so scared of Judd.

228
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:05,998
Judd. You in there, Judd?

229
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:22,179
Hey, you're driving now.

230
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:27,113
When I gotta get somewhere is about it.

231
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:30,449
What are you doing around here?

232
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,786
Just dropped by to see
how you were doing.

233
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:35,692
Well, I'm doing fine.

234
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,536
- You coming in?
- lf that's okay.

235
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:08,792
Oh, it's milk.

236
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:11,525
What did you expect? Whiskey?

237
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:15,960
All right, what you hiding
behind your back?

238
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,206
It's a little something
I was wondering if you recognize.

239
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:24,774
- Where'd you get that?
- Over by the creek.

240
00:21:24,946 --> 00:21:28,279
- Know who it belongs to?
- Well, of course. It's mine.

241
00:21:29,084 --> 00:21:30,745
Lost it the night of the accident.

242
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:35,484
Those rescue folks took it off
and just chucked it away.

243
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:39,685
Didn't you miss it when you dressed
to come home from the hospital?

244
00:21:40,528 --> 00:21:43,019
I missed it before that.

245
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:49,159
A boy over at Whelan's Garage gave me
an old pair of sneakers to get home in.

246
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:55,231
- You want a soda pop?
- Okay.

247
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:01,109
Thanks.

248
00:22:06,054 --> 00:22:09,182
- How are things?
- Good.

249
00:22:09,524 --> 00:22:13,153
Working for that vet over
in Sisterville, Doc Collins.

250
00:22:13,328 --> 00:22:14,886
Learning a lot about dogs.

251
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,792
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

252
00:22:17,198 --> 00:22:19,826
We see a lot of dogs
that have been chained.

253
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:22,162
Most of them are awful mean.

254
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:26,396
It seems that they
feel trapped and lonely.

255
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:29,805
Like if something came along
to attack them, they couldn't fight back.

256
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:34,108
- So they act all ferocious all the time.
- That a fact?

257
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,578
Well.

258
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,583
Well, I know lonely.

259
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:42,747
I know trapped.

260
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:47,956
Looking at the buckle end
of my daddy's belt.

261
00:22:48,797 --> 00:22:53,962
Sometimes he beat me when he was sad.
Sometimes he beat me when he was happy.

262
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:58,164
Sometimes he was
just happy to beat me.

263
00:23:02,677 --> 00:23:04,611
Memories.

264
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,511
Memories, huh, kid? Just memories.

265
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:17,688
Why don't you get on out of here.
I'm gonna take a nap.

266
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,154
Okay. See you around.

267
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:27,557
It's only for the day, boy.
We'll be back late tonight.

268
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:30,220
All right, love you. Stay here.

269
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:33,698
Dad, you sure we can leave him out,
with the gunshots and all?

270
00:24:33,868 --> 00:24:35,768
He'll be fine.

271
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,375
Hey.

272
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:26,383
- Aunt Hettie!
- Aunt Hettie!

273
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:32,388
Now, these are for you!

274
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:35,328
- Thanks, Aunt Hettie!
- Here you go.

275
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:38,056
- You shouldn't have, sis.
- You know I love to.

276
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:41,331
How are you, darling?
How good to see you.

277
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:43,663
Come on in, Mom's waiting.

278
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:46,466
Hey, kiddy, how are you?

279
00:25:50,712 --> 00:25:52,339
- There's Grandma.
- Go on.

280
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:54,242
Come on, guys.

281
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,020
Hi, Mother.

282
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:07,319
- I brought the family to see you.
- It was right outside my door.

283
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,622
- What, Mother?
- My brand-new oven.

284
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:13,694
- You take it?
- No, ma'am.

285
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:16,734
Got a present for you, honey.

286
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:26,776
There's Santa,
and it ain't even Christmas.

287
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:33,209
- Thanks for all my Christmas presents!
- You be a good girl...

288
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:36,221
...and you'll get what you ask for
this year too.

289
00:26:36,391 --> 00:26:40,555
- I told you he was real.
- Well...

290
00:26:41,462 --> 00:26:43,054
Come on.

291
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:48,294
- Who is that?
- That's Hettie.

292
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,964
- It's me, Mom.
- Oh, you. Why don't you go on home?

293
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:02,547
If you loved me,
you'd take me out of here.

294
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:08,917
I'm sorry, Ma, but it's the best
we can do right now.

295
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:14,426
Grandma, I brought you this picture.

296
00:27:14,896 --> 00:27:17,694
It's from when you took me
to the zoo in Wheeling.

297
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:32,244
I remember.

298
00:29:14,315 --> 00:29:15,942
Shiloh.

299
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:18,915
Here we go.

300
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:36,896
Where's Shiloh?

301
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:40,069
Shiloh?

302
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:43,401
Come here, boy.

303
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:45,873
Shiloh!

304
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:48,475
Shiloh!

305
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:52,084
Dad, I'm a little scared.

306
00:29:52,253 --> 00:29:55,120
He'll find his way back, son.
Let's go on in now. Come on.

307
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:56,955
Come on.

308
00:30:34,362 --> 00:30:37,525
- Did Shiloh come home?
- No, not yet.

309
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:40,426
Don't worry, we'll find him. Come on.

310
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:43,092
We'll start looking down by the bridge.

311
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:48,669
Shiloh!

312
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:53,270
Now what have you got?

313
00:30:53,447 --> 00:30:56,143
- Why do you pick up this weird stuff?
- Shiloh's back.

314
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,308
- Good. Marty?
- Yeah?

315
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:00,579
Come on in, have your breakfast.

316
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:02,382
Come on, boy.

317
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:15,196
Come on.

318
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:17,428
- Hey, Marty, guess what?
- I don't know. What?

319
00:31:17,605 --> 00:31:19,596
No, no, no, just guess.

320
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:22,607
They found the man from Bens Run
with a bullet in his head.

321
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:25,007
There wasn't any bullet,
but they found him.

322
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:26,908
- And he's dead.
- No way.

323
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:29,076
- What did I tell you?
- What happened?

324
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,842
The guy's name was Nate Fowler.

325
00:31:31,018 --> 00:31:32,986
They said he died from
a blow to the head.

326
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:36,920
They found the body along the Ohio River.
It was a cleaning crew that found him.

327
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,992
And get this: The man's
shoes were missing.

328
00:31:40,528 --> 00:31:41,790
Are there any suspects?

329
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:43,696
Yeah.

330
00:31:43,864 --> 00:31:45,991
Judd Travers.

331
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:18,060
- They think Judd did it.
- Who thinks?

332
00:32:18,232 --> 00:32:21,030
- Everybody.
- The sheriff's questioning lots of people...

333
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:23,136
...and one of them is Judd.

334
00:32:23,304 --> 00:32:25,101
It don't mean he did it.

335
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:27,103
How come you keep sticking up for him?

336
00:32:27,274 --> 00:32:29,504
I mean, you used to hate him
worse than poison.

337
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:32,305
Well, maybe he's changed.

338
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:35,543
Oh, have you heard anything
from your dad at the newspaper?

339
00:32:35,716 --> 00:32:38,810
Yeah, yeah, they brought Judd in, but...
But they released him.

340
00:32:38,986 --> 00:32:41,887
It doesn't mean he's innocent,
just they haven't charged him...

341
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:43,250
...yet.

342
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:46,655
Okay, everybody,
let's come to order, please.

343
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:53,725
The guy was murdered around
the time of Judd's accident.

344
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:56,597
It could've been a week before
or a week after.

345
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:59,103
We ought to turn
that boot over to the sheriff.

346
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,833
- I don't have it.
- What? Where is it?

347
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:04,110
Judd said it was his.
So I gave it to him.

348
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:06,542
You believe him?
It was probably Nate Fowler's.

349
00:33:06,714 --> 00:33:09,239
We could've been on the
witness stand, solved the case.

350
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:11,214
Just be quiet about it.

351
00:33:11,585 --> 00:33:14,179
Come on, people.
This class is not a courtroom.

352
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:17,983
Let's stop talking
about rumors and gossip.

353
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:26,526
That Ed Holt came up
with 20 different versions...

354
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:30,228
...of how that guy got killed,
and one of them had Judd as the killer.

355
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:33,698
And I told him, a man is
innocent till he's proven guilty.

356
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:36,374
- You talk to the sheriff yet?
- Yeah.

357
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:39,308
He's guessing this happened
after Judd's accident.

358
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,209
Well, can they tell that for sure?

359
00:33:41,382 --> 00:33:43,407
Gotta do a few more tests on the body.

360
00:33:43,584 --> 00:33:45,916
Till then, people are gonna
think Judd did it.

361
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:50,217
Well, that in itself can make
a man crazy, being hated so.

362
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:52,392
- I think he did it.
- So do I.

363
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,028
Well, you two keep
your opinions within this family.

364
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:58,887
We are not a family that goes around
saying bad things about people.

365
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:02,934
You know anybody with old chicken wire
that we can use to fence in Judd's dogs?

366
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:04,901
- What?
- Well...

367
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:07,233
...I thought I'd help Judd's dogs out.

368
00:34:07,408 --> 00:34:09,308
Show him we don't all think he's guilty.

369
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:11,968
You don't think there's any way
he could've done that?

370
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:15,305
- No.
- lf you have even the slightest doubt...

371
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:19,283
...I don't want Marty near that man.
- I've known Judd to be a lot of things.

372
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:23,219
- But he's not a killer.
- So I can help him with a fence for his dogs?

373
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,688
You'll need something
stronger than chicken wire.

374
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:42,271
Oh, there you are.

375
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:45,879
- How are you two?
- Good, thanks, Mrs. Wallace.

376
00:34:47,548 --> 00:34:51,609
I'll just never forget how you helped
Sam and me after Doc passed.

377
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:54,120
You were like a grandson to him, honey.

378
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:56,688
He really loved you.

379
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:59,883
- Thanks.
- I'm embarrassing you, aren't I?

380
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,288
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

381
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:03,054
What can I do for you, sweetheart?

382
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,664
I was wondering if I could
take down the old fence...

383
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,996
...so you can plant new flowers
right over the postholes.

384
00:35:09,336 --> 00:35:11,361
That's not a bad idea.
Why'd you wanna do it?

385
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:13,803
It's for Judd's dogs,
to keep them happy.

386
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:17,367
I'll tell you what.

387
00:35:17,545 --> 00:35:21,481
I'll have Joe and Earl,
my handymen, take it out.

388
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:24,941
You and your dad are gonna have
to come and haul it tomorrow.

389
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,213
- Is that a deal?
- We'll pick it up in the morning. Come on.

390
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:31,620
Does Judd like the idea of a fence?

391
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:35,159
Oh, he don't know about it yet.
Neither does my dad.

392
00:35:49,877 --> 00:35:52,505
You dogs hush up now, you hear.

393
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:58,752
I said, hush.

394
00:36:00,888 --> 00:36:02,788
What you want?

395
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:06,853
Everybody seems to think I killed a man.

396
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:10,595
- Is that what you come here to say?
- No. Of course not.

397
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:14,699
Then why was you messing around in the
back of my truck last time you were here?

398
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:17,703
Trying to find the other boot of yours.

399
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:19,869
Why should you care?

400
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:22,072
Just wondering, that's all.

401
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:26,141
Well, I threw it out.

402
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:29,174
Long time ago.

403
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,743
One ain't much good without the other.

404
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:39,052
Your dogs are all chained up.

405
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:41,183
Yeah.

406
00:36:41,762 --> 00:36:43,195
So?

407
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:46,225
The way I hear it,
happy dogs make the best hunters.

408
00:36:47,201 --> 00:36:49,260
And who says they ain't happy?

409
00:36:49,436 --> 00:36:51,631
Would you be happy all chained up?

410
00:36:51,805 --> 00:36:54,171
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

411
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:55,672
I ain't no dog.

412
00:36:56,977 --> 00:37:00,140
My pa always said,
"Keep them lean and keep them mean."

413
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:03,541
Maybe your pa wasn't always right.

414
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:16,995
All I know is that Doc Collins says
chaining dogs is no good for them.

415
00:37:17,564 --> 00:37:19,862
Well, ain't that a pity.

416
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:22,466
I ain't got no fence.

417
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:25,795
Well, I heard Mrs. Wallace
is giving away her fencing...

418
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:28,237
...so I said I'd ask you
to see if you want it.

419
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:29,740
Oh, yeah?

420
00:37:31,478 --> 00:37:36,006
Well, I can't be doing much with
no fence with a bum leg like this.

421
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:38,617
Well, me and my dad can bring it.

422
00:37:38,786 --> 00:37:41,084
We'll set it up for you ourselves.

423
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:44,149
There ain't nothing for nothing.

424
00:37:44,692 --> 00:37:46,626
We're not asking for anything.

425
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:51,497
- We wanna do something for those dogs.
- What about those dogs?

426
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:54,133
You already got one of them, Shiloh.

427
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:58,602
- You got your eye on the rest of them?
- What? No. We're just being neighborly.

428
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:00,137
Yeah.

429
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:06,470
My dogs can get along fine without you.

430
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:11,179
If you don't want it,
I know folks who do.

431
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:16,184
What's the name of the man with those
fine hunting dogs over in Little?

432
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,222
He'll like that fence for them, I bet.

433
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,894
All right, then.

434
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:29,295
See you around.

435
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:36,499
He don't care about those dogs any more
than I care about this grass here.

436
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,878
He's weird, Marty.

437
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:41,071
Don't beat up on yourself.

438
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:45,074
Right now your grandma is
having that fence taken down.

439
00:38:45,252 --> 00:38:48,346
Tomorrow me and my dad
are gonna go pick it up.

440
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:51,252
Although my dad don't
even know about it yet.

441
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:53,825
And Judd doesn't want it.

442
00:38:55,295 --> 00:38:56,990
Yeah.

443
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,132
It's all because of you.

444
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:04,597
You know, Marty,
every minute of every day...

445
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:07,206
...there are folks just like Judd...

446
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:10,571
...trying to think of ways to be worse
than they were the day before.

447
00:39:10,744 --> 00:39:11,768
Yeah.

448
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,714
Why should I care about him...

449
00:39:14,882 --> 00:39:16,349
...or his dogs either?

450
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:18,917
You care because
you got a good heart, Marty.

451
00:39:21,555 --> 00:39:23,386
Yeah?

452
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:25,718
Yeah.

453
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:31,989
- Hey there.
- Hi, honey.

454
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:34,600
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, guys.

455
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:37,300
I am just so tired.

456
00:39:37,471 --> 00:39:40,565
I think I'm gonna sleep
until tomorrow afternoon.

457
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:44,807
- How's it going, Marty?
- I went to see Judd today.

458
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:46,878
I can't stand him.

459
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:49,779
Then you shouldn't be
going over there, then.

460
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,247
Did you two have a fight?

461
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:53,413
No, I didn't have no fight.

462
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:03,958
<i>- Hello.
- What kind of fence you say it is?</i>

463
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:06,495
Wire with wood posts.

464
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:08,567
<i>Well, I don't want no gate.</i>

465
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:12,193
<i>Don't want somebody sneaking in
letting my dogs out again.</i>

466
00:40:12,372 --> 00:40:13,669
All right.

467
00:40:14,274 --> 00:40:15,798
<i>Come after 10 a.m.</i>

468
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:17,238
See you tomorrow, then.

469
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:24,150
Ground's pretty soft.
Good time to work in the yard.

470
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:28,715
Well, then, son, you got
my permission to work in the yard.

471
00:40:30,624 --> 00:40:34,151
What if you was to find out
that tomorrow was your day...

472
00:40:34,328 --> 00:40:36,853
...to do a really good, fine deed
for someone?

473
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,158
- And what if I said I'd help?
- What in the world have you done now?

474
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:42,700
Well, I told Judd I'd build him a fence.

475
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,001
- Mrs. Wallace has the fencing.
- Two seconds ago you hated Judd.

476
00:40:47,274 --> 00:40:49,105
Well, a person has the right to change.

477
00:40:49,276 --> 00:40:51,767
Didn't you say you believe
in second chances?

478
00:40:51,945 --> 00:40:54,470
A good, fine deed, huh?

479
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:58,216
We'll see how I feel tomorrow.

480
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:39,283
- Thought you might need a little water.
- Oh, thanks.

481
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:42,019
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

482
00:41:42,196 --> 00:41:44,721
It surely is appreciated.

483
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:49,197
- There you go.
- Come on over here, son.

484
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,972
- All right, well, we'll see you later.
- Thank you, sir.

485
00:42:01,148 --> 00:42:03,207
- All right.
- Thank you.

486
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:06,875
Well, this was a fine good deed.

487
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:09,920
- How you feel about it?
- Very good.

488
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:12,082
Me too.

489
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:17,059
"My yellow dog followed me everywhere.

490
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:19,927
And when us kids were
playing outside, kicking the ball...

491
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,568
...he'd chase after it
and push it with his nose.

492
00:42:22,736 --> 00:42:25,933
Push, push, push,
and getting slobber all over the ball...

493
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:27,471
...but no one cared.

494
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:30,405
Because he was such
a funny dog, that dog, Sky.

495
00:42:30,577 --> 00:42:34,877
That straggly, furry, smiling dog, Sky."

496
00:42:40,954 --> 00:42:44,583
Go see your master, crazy slobber dog.

497
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:46,817
- Come here, Shiloh.
- Thanks.

498
00:42:46,994 --> 00:42:48,655
What happens to Sky, Marty?

499
00:42:49,062 --> 00:42:51,087
I bet he gets killed or something. Right?

500
00:42:52,065 --> 00:42:54,659
The book's about how the boy
finds a way to write a poem.

501
00:42:54,835 --> 00:42:58,566
So I'll just say that it's because
of Sky that he finds a way.

502
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:01,140
Good night, Marty.
Good night, Dara Lynn.

503
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,902
- Good night, Becky. Good night, Dara Lynn.
- Good night.

504
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:06,045
And don't even think
of coming over here...

505
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:07,805
...to give me a good-night kiss.

506
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:10,381
You don't ever have
to worry about that.

507
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,267
- Hey.
- Hey.

508
00:43:31,438 --> 00:43:34,134
Thanks for reading
to your sisters tonight.

509
00:43:34,608 --> 00:43:36,405
What you doing out here?

510
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:39,240
I was just...

511
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,548
...thinking about Grandma Preston.

512
00:43:44,017 --> 00:43:45,848
Does it make you sad?

513
00:43:49,823 --> 00:43:53,384
Mostly because now I can't tell her
how much she means to me.

514
00:43:54,061 --> 00:43:56,222
I think she knows.

515
00:43:58,031 --> 00:44:01,523
Marty, the one thing
I've learned out of all this is that...

516
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,371
...it doesn't do anybody any good
to hold your feelings inside.

517
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,939
You gotta...

518
00:44:09,276 --> 00:44:12,439
You gotta let people know
how much they mean to you.

519
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:17,617
- Want me to sit out here with you?
- No, that's all right. Go on.

520
00:44:17,784 --> 00:44:19,684
Go to bed, son.

521
00:44:32,165 --> 00:44:33,564
I love you.

522
00:44:33,734 --> 00:44:35,759
I love you too, son.

523
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,203
Isn't that a light coming from the creek
where Judd had his accident?

524
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:47,736
I didn't see anything.

525
00:44:48,882 --> 00:44:50,850
It's gone now.

526
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:55,512
- Good night, son.
- Good night.

527
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,560
David's mom invited you
to spend the night.

528
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,862
- I want to.
- Okay.

529
00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:13,665
- But next time, David needs to come here.
- Right.

530
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,067
Why don't anybody
invite me to sleep over?

531
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:18,643
Because you're a sourpuss, that's why.

532
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,874
Hope you get run over and your eyes
get pecked out by crows.

533
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:26,644
- Maybe you'll fall in a hole.
- Stop fighting or I'll scream.

534
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,117
Seriously.

535
00:45:29,856 --> 00:45:32,120
Becky, I'm talking to you too.

536
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:40,323
Marty, this one.

537
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,294
- Yeah.
- George Niles called the paper today...

538
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,234
...and reported that a couple
of shirts, a fishing vest...

539
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,533
...and a gun had been
stolen from his house.

540
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,701
It's Judd, for sure.

541
00:45:50,877 --> 00:45:53,573
How come everything that happens
has to be Judd's fault?

542
00:45:53,747 --> 00:45:57,012
Because most things that have happened
have always been Judd's fault...

543
00:45:57,184 --> 00:46:01,450
...like cheating the Wallaces
at their store or kicking his dogs.

544
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:04,283
I mean, some people do those things
once in their lives.

545
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:07,894
- Judd can do those things in a month.
- Yeah, but what if he's changed?

546
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:09,494
I hope he has.

547
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,187
But once you get a reputation...

548
00:46:11,364 --> 00:46:13,559
...they'll follow you around
like a shadow.

549
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:14,995
That's probably true.

550
00:46:15,168 --> 00:46:16,692
Accepting...

551
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,134
...he might be guilty.

552
00:46:36,656 --> 00:46:38,681
I was only gone two minutes.

553
00:46:38,859 --> 00:46:41,123
- Was someone home?
- No, I walked down the road...

554
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:43,626
...to check the mailbox,
didn't lock the doors.

555
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:46,924
Judd's making up for lost time
now that his leg's a little better.

556
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,864
Oh, Sue, it could have
been anyone at all.

557
00:46:50,136 --> 00:46:53,731
Honestly, Louise, I don't know how
you can let your family near that man.

558
00:46:53,907 --> 00:46:56,774
Well, there was a time when
I would have agreed with you...

559
00:46:56,943 --> 00:47:00,743
...but even at his worst, he never
stole from people's houses.

560
00:47:00,914 --> 00:47:05,248
Yeah. He'd just crash into their
mailboxes when he got drunk.

561
00:47:05,418 --> 00:47:07,818
Then he might kill somebody.

562
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:14,759
Heard about those robberies
up your way?

563
00:47:14,928 --> 00:47:16,555
I heard about the Niles house.

564
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:20,632
Well, I heard about a couple of more,
and there's talk of Judd Travers doing it.

565
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,860
I told Mrs. Bates it could
be a ring of housebreakers.

566
00:47:24,037 --> 00:47:27,029
I especially don't like to hear
about someone stealing a shotgun.

567
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:38,282
Why are we stopping here?

568
00:47:38,451 --> 00:47:40,783
This is where Judd and
Nate Fowler had their fight.

569
00:47:40,954 --> 00:47:44,446
Yeah. Doesn't mean
we can't have lunch here.

570
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:47,026
Great specials today.

571
00:47:47,193 --> 00:47:48,251
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey.

572
00:47:48,428 --> 00:47:51,761
- Come in for the john or some food?
- Both. That's my boy, Marty.

573
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:54,696
- Hi, Marty. I'm Carl.
- Hi.

574
00:47:55,368 --> 00:47:58,098
- You want a Coke?
- Sure.

575
00:47:59,973 --> 00:48:01,565
Carl?

576
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:04,642
Were you here the night that Judd
and that guy got in a fight?

577
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:07,871
I sure was. I thought them two
was gonna kill each other.

578
00:48:08,048 --> 00:48:11,506
And as it turns out, one of them
ended up dead anyway.

579
00:48:11,685 --> 00:48:13,710
You think Judd
could have done it?

580
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:17,152
What I've learned in life is that
anybody is capable of anything...

581
00:48:17,324 --> 00:48:19,053
...if they're pushed hard enough.

582
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:21,250
Some folks require
more pushing than others.

583
00:48:21,561 --> 00:48:25,361
And in my experience,
Judd doesn't need that much pushing.

584
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:29,430
- What are you two talking about?
- The murder of Nate Fowler.

585
00:48:29,603 --> 00:48:31,628
Well, Judd didn't do it,
I can guarantee you.

586
00:48:31,905 --> 00:48:33,600
Ray, you weren't here that night.

587
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:37,005
<i>Judd was in a way
I had never seen him before.</i>

588
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,776
<i>I'm not one to judge
before all the facts are in...</i>

589
00:48:39,946 --> 00:48:42,881
<i>... but, man, the stuff Nate
was saying to Judd...</i>

590
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:46,874
<i>... it would've made a lot
of folks talk about killing.</i>

591
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:14,473
<i>The next day, all I could think about
was how mean Judd used to be.</i>

592
00:49:15,248 --> 00:49:18,240
<i>Can someone like that really change?</i>

593
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:31,354
Hey, Marty.

594
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:34,898
- Hi, Judd.
- I want you to come by my place later.

595
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:39,168
- Why?
- Why, I got something I wanna show you.

596
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:41,203
I'm a little busy.

597
00:49:42,175 --> 00:49:45,110
Well, when you free up,
you come on by, all right?

598
00:49:47,313 --> 00:49:49,338
All right.

599
00:49:56,189 --> 00:49:58,180
You really going over there?

600
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:00,189
I reckon I don't have much choice.

601
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,093
Marty, he is still the only suspect
for that man's murder.

602
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:07,589
I know, I know.

603
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:10,528
Well, call me when you get home.

604
00:50:10,704 --> 00:50:13,172
And be careful, okay?

605
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:15,637
David told me about the boot. I mean...

606
00:50:15,809 --> 00:50:18,642
...what if Judd thinks
you know too much?

607
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:30,779
Hey, Marty.

608
00:50:33,293 --> 00:50:34,760
That was a good idea of yours.

609
00:50:34,928 --> 00:50:36,395
Hey.

610
00:50:37,363 --> 00:50:40,161
Look at them, don't they
look like they're having fun?

611
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,198
They've been running around so much...

612
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:45,769
...they're getting those legs strong.
Yes, they are.

613
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:48,931
They'll be running up those hills
like nobody's business.

614
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,576
<i>He is still the only suspect
for that man's murder.</i>

615
00:50:54,748 --> 00:50:56,545
<i>What if Judd thinks you know too much?</i>

616
00:50:56,716 --> 00:50:58,547
Maybe I should get in there with them.

617
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:04,513
<i>They said he died from
a blow to the head.</i>

618
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:06,752
Be on my leg.

619
00:51:09,662 --> 00:51:11,892
<i>Get this, the man's shoes were missing.</i>

620
00:51:12,632 --> 00:51:14,759
<i>The stuff Nate was saying to Judd...</i>

621
00:51:14,934 --> 00:51:17,835
<i>... it would've made a lot
of folks talk about killing.</i>

622
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:20,272
You all right, Marty?

623
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:24,738
Oh, yeah.

624
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:26,208
Yeah, I should go, though.

625
00:51:26,379 --> 00:51:28,006
What's your hurry?

626
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:30,446
Want a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich?

627
00:51:30,617 --> 00:51:33,313
Oh, no, thanks.
I got some homework to do...

628
00:51:33,486 --> 00:51:35,454
...so see you around.

629
00:52:05,985 --> 00:52:08,146
- Dad, someone's on our property.
- Where is he?

630
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:10,050
Heading down the side of the hill.

631
00:52:10,423 --> 00:52:11,651
Hey!

632
00:52:12,225 --> 00:52:13,886
Who's out there?

633
00:52:14,928 --> 00:52:16,361
Hey, come back here.

634
00:52:16,529 --> 00:52:17,791
Settle down, Marty.

635
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:21,024
- Don't go following whoever that is.
- Yeah, you're right.

636
00:52:21,835 --> 00:52:24,235
Let's go check the shed.

637
00:52:30,176 --> 00:52:35,409
Well, someone took the lantern,
the shears and the knife.

638
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:37,583
Our emergency supplies are missing too.

639
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:40,947
- What should we do now?
- Go call the sheriff.

640
00:52:49,863 --> 00:52:51,387
What is it, boy?

641
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:57,558
I gotta get Dad.

642
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:01,298
Who's out there?

643
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:03,741
Judd.

644
00:53:09,582 --> 00:53:10,913
Sorry I bothered you.

645
00:53:12,218 --> 00:53:15,381
There was a prowler
messing around my property.

646
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:17,818
Figured he might've been headed here.

647
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:20,357
Well, there was a robber
here tonight, Judd.

648
00:53:20,526 --> 00:53:22,756
- Is that right?
- He took stuff out of the shed...

649
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:24,920
...and ran off down the hill.

650
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:26,793
I heard him back in my place.

651
00:53:26,966 --> 00:53:28,763
I yelled at him to scare him off.

652
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:31,400
He had a knife in his hand.

653
00:53:31,571 --> 00:53:34,131
I figured I didn't want to go out
and tangle with that.

654
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:36,868
I like your vest, Judd.

655
00:53:37,343 --> 00:53:39,004
Is it new?

656
00:53:41,381 --> 00:53:44,748
Yeah. Miss Wallace give it to me.

657
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:47,419
It's Doc's.

658
00:53:48,821 --> 00:53:51,449
Well, whoever did this
is probably long gone by now.

659
00:53:53,726 --> 00:53:55,717
I figure you're right.

660
00:53:58,064 --> 00:54:00,999
Well, y'all have a good evening.

661
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:03,094
- Good night, Judd.
- Good night.

662
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:09,466
Dad, did you notice
that he had a new vest...

663
00:54:09,642 --> 00:54:11,610
...and a lantern just like the one stolen?

664
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:14,310
Yeah, I did notice that.

665
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,940
But that is the only lantern
that the Wallaces sell at their store.

666
00:54:19,118 --> 00:54:21,279
I'd have been surprised
if he had any other.

667
00:54:21,454 --> 00:54:24,252
You think we could've
been wrong about Judd?

668
00:54:24,457 --> 00:54:27,426
That maybe he has changed
for the worse?

669
00:54:27,627 --> 00:54:29,254
I don't know.

670
00:54:30,663 --> 00:54:35,396
What I do know is it is still a mystery
to me what's going on around here.

671
00:54:43,977 --> 00:54:45,706
- Have fun. Bye, sweetheart.
- Love you.

672
00:54:45,878 --> 00:54:47,470
- Bye.
- Love you too.

673
00:54:49,315 --> 00:54:50,339
Bye-bye, Laura.

674
00:54:50,516 --> 00:54:54,111
Okay. We gotta find out where the guy
with that light went and if it's Judd.

675
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:57,313
- Let's work. Let's solve this.
- He was headed down by the creek.

676
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,617
- I wanna go with you.
- No way.

677
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,851
- Why not?
- Because we're doing our stuff.

678
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:03,996
- Go do yours.
- I'll just watch.

679
00:55:04,364 --> 00:55:05,991
- Will not.
- You're so mean.

680
00:55:06,499 --> 00:55:07,864
- Mom.
- Dara Lynn...

681
00:55:08,034 --> 00:55:10,764
...how about I get some
magazines, you cut pictures...

682
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:12,370
...make a scrapbook?
- Let's go.

683
00:55:12,538 --> 00:55:15,769
I don't wanna make no scrapbook.
I can play in my own yard if I want.

684
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:17,637
All right, now, come on.

685
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,852
- I think we gave her the slip.
- That's good.

686
00:55:30,023 --> 00:55:31,752
She is such a pain.

687
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:35,823
Hey, let's see if we can find
something else in the water down here.

688
00:55:46,339 --> 00:55:49,308
You know, I bet if we dig here
we'll find another body.

689
00:55:49,475 --> 00:55:53,275
I doubt it. We don't even know
what we're looking for really.

690
00:55:56,816 --> 00:55:58,477
Here you go.

691
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:04,416
Did you hear that?

692
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:07,320
Yeah, let's go check it out.

693
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,051
Come on, Shiloh.

694
00:56:41,427 --> 00:56:45,420
Whoa, Marty. It's like the
whole place has just fallen apart.

695
00:56:49,302 --> 00:56:51,668
This is too weird.

696
00:57:13,793 --> 00:57:15,124
This is our lantern.

697
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,195
Did you hear that?

698
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:21,826
It sounded like footsteps.

699
00:57:30,076 --> 00:57:31,338
It's just Shiloh.

700
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:40,278
Go back over there. Go. Go. Go.

701
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:53,221
It's okay, Shiloh. It's only us.

702
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:10,512
What's that?

703
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:15,413
- Is that a dead body?
- Let's get out of here.

704
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,553
Look.

705
00:58:37,877 --> 00:58:40,675
Hey, you kids. Come back here.

706
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:16,610
- Shiloh, come on, boy.
- Shiloh, come on. Come on.

707
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:22,586
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

708
00:59:25,391 --> 00:59:27,825
Mom, down at the old shack.
There's a dead body.

709
00:59:27,994 --> 00:59:30,588
Two guys chased us.
One was wearing Mr. Niles' shirt.

710
00:59:30,763 --> 00:59:33,789
- Oh, are you sure about this, honey?
- Sure as can be.

711
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:37,129
Not sure if it was a body,
but it looked like it. Definitely.

712
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:39,362
Well, I've got to call the sheriff.

713
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:45,342
I'll have them right back, Mrs. Preston.
Whoever it was is long gone now.

714
00:59:54,954 --> 00:59:57,354
It's right over there.
There's the old farmhouse.

715
00:59:57,523 --> 01:00:00,959
If Shiloh hadn't attacked them,
we probably wouldn't be here now.

716
01:00:30,423 --> 01:00:32,618
There's no one down here.

717
01:00:38,831 --> 01:00:40,389
There's the boot.

718
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:42,193
There's a glove here too.

719
01:00:42,902 --> 01:00:45,871
- What about the body, though?
- That's not a body.

720
01:00:46,038 --> 01:00:47,869
Just a pile of clothes.

721
01:00:50,743 --> 01:00:52,301
Shiloh.

722
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,010
These are part of a county-jail uniform.

723
01:00:57,183 --> 01:01:00,050
This must be where those escapees
from Tyler have been hiding.

724
01:01:00,219 --> 01:01:04,451
- That jail is over 100 miles from here.
- Exactly. What better place to hide...

725
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:07,387
...than far away from where
the cops are gonna be searching?

726
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,428
That's pretty good. You ever thought
of being a detective or policeman someday?

727
01:01:11,597 --> 01:01:13,690
As a matter of fact, yes.

728
01:01:15,101 --> 01:01:17,228
Hey, my dog brought
this home last week.

729
01:01:18,037 --> 01:01:21,871
They must've dropped their clothes as soon
as they could steal something to put on.

730
01:01:22,441 --> 01:01:23,840
Where are they now, you think?

731
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:27,308
We're gonna bring the canine unit in
to smell these clothes...

732
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,415
...see if they can pick up a scent.
- Any way my dog can help?

733
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:32,551
I'd say he's been a lot of help already.

734
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:46,154
Good boy, Shiloh.

735
01:01:49,535 --> 01:01:52,197
Good. Thank you, thank you.

736
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:56,569
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
you all helping me out tonight like this.

737
01:01:56,742 --> 01:01:58,039
It's our pleasure.

738
01:01:58,644 --> 01:02:01,807
Marty, everybody in town
is talking about how you and David...

739
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:05,007
...are heroes for finding those convicts.

740
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:07,778
To be honest, Mrs. Wallace,
we were just kind of lucky.

741
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:11,013
- We probably shouldn't have been snooping.
- That's right.

742
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,750
Well, I'm gonna call you a hero anyway.

743
01:02:16,295 --> 01:02:17,990
What is it, Shiloh?

744
01:02:18,464 --> 01:02:20,455
He hears something.

745
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:29,674
- I think there's someone out there.
- Well, can you see anyone?

746
01:02:29,842 --> 01:02:32,367
- Let me open the door.
- No, they're trying to break in.

747
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:35,509
Let's go out the back.

748
01:02:35,681 --> 01:02:37,273
Come on.

749
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,448
Come on.

750
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:56,391
Get him!

751
01:03:13,052 --> 01:03:14,747
I've got you now.

752
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:26,128
Sheriff's here.

753
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:28,323
The bad guys are in here,
so let's join him.

754
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:30,867
All right. Good work, Shiloh.

755
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,504
Then they pulled a gun. I jumped up and
I kicked it all karate-like out of their hands.

756
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:41,578
And then Shiloh jumped up
and bit him and he wouldn't let go.

757
01:03:41,747 --> 01:03:44,910
Well, that's not how Marty
told the story.

758
01:03:45,084 --> 01:03:49,316
Well, the truth is my Dad and Shiloh
tricked them into going into the stockroom.

759
01:03:49,488 --> 01:03:51,888
Then we locked them up
till the sheriff got there.

760
01:03:52,057 --> 01:03:55,322
But I think David's version is better
for when they make a movie of it.

761
01:03:55,494 --> 01:03:56,756
Okay, then.

762
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:58,453
This is how gossip gets around.

763
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:01,759
No matter how it happened, David
and Marty helped solve some crimes.

764
01:04:01,934 --> 01:04:03,595
For that we are all thankful.

765
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:06,397
It's just how we figured it
from the very beginning.

766
01:04:13,746 --> 01:04:15,145
<i>Turns out, the next day...</i>

767
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:18,112
<i>... them two convicts were charged
with murdering Nate Fowler.</i>

768
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:23,346
<i>Seems that when they were arrested,
one of them was wearing Nate's old boots.</i>

769
01:04:23,522 --> 01:04:27,083
<i>But little did I realize
that our problems weren't over.</i>

770
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:30,751
You know, I'm right glad
you boys found those escapees.

771
01:04:31,697 --> 01:04:34,165
Yeah, it proved you didn't
do those robberies.

772
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,665
Well, we didn't need no proof,
now, did we?

773
01:04:39,138 --> 01:04:41,003
I think your dogs are happier.

774
01:04:41,774 --> 01:04:43,071
Yeah.

775
01:04:43,242 --> 01:04:45,142
They don't bark as much.

776
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:46,939
Fence holding up okay?

777
01:04:47,746 --> 01:04:49,839
It's holding up fine.

778
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:52,946
Wish I had a gate on it now, though.

779
01:04:53,118 --> 01:04:56,747
Getting tired of hitching it
and unhitching it all the time.

780
01:04:56,922 --> 01:04:59,083
We got your gate behind the shed.

781
01:04:59,258 --> 01:05:02,227
- I can help put it on, if you want.
- You got time to do it now?

782
01:05:02,394 --> 01:05:03,622
- Sure.
- You sure?

783
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:05,161
- Yeah.
- All right.

784
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:06,696
All right.

785
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:17,438
Get back.

786
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:19,707
Go on, get back.

787
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:27,811
See if that thing will fit in there.

788
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:48,162
Well, let's see what we got here.

789
01:06:02,154 --> 01:06:03,917
- Come on! Come on!
- Judd!

790
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:06,080
- Just bite me again. Come on, do it!
- Judd!

791
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:08,317
- Judd, don't!
- Get away. Get out of here!

792
01:06:08,494 --> 01:06:11,327
- Judd, don't do it!
- Come on! Why don't you get out of here!

793
01:06:11,497 --> 01:06:12,794
- But, Judd..!
- Get out!

794
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:14,262
This is all your fault!

795
01:06:14,433 --> 01:06:15,559
- But, Judd..!
- Get out.

796
01:06:15,734 --> 01:06:17,668
Go on!

797
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:21,471
This never would've happened
if it hadn't been for you.

798
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:42,550
He was just so scary
when he threw the dog.

799
01:06:43,195 --> 01:06:45,755
I just keep thinking about him
hitting Shiloh.

800
01:06:46,098 --> 01:06:47,463
You did say the dog bit him.

801
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:49,328
But he reacted so strong.

802
01:06:52,237 --> 01:06:53,761
I wasn't there, honey.

803
01:06:53,939 --> 01:06:55,270
I can't be the judge.

804
01:06:56,375 --> 01:06:59,037
I would never hurt a dog
no matter what.

805
01:06:59,211 --> 01:07:01,008
Judd isn't you, darling.

806
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:10,477
Hi. What's new?

807
01:07:16,028 --> 01:07:19,088
Now, I don't want you telling nobody
about Judd and his dogs.

808
01:07:19,264 --> 01:07:20,561
You can't make me not tell.

809
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:22,223
If you tell one person...

810
01:07:22,401 --> 01:07:25,199
...I'll tell the whole bus how you
threw up on your shoes.

811
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,771
- Okay, I won't say he threw his dog.
- All right.

812
01:07:30,976 --> 01:07:33,342
Marty saw Judd hurt
one of his dogs yesterday.

813
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:35,309
- Hey!
- I didn't say how.

814
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:36,812
Well, what happened?

815
01:07:36,982 --> 01:07:39,542
He threw him across the yard
just because it bit him.

816
01:07:39,718 --> 01:07:41,948
- Dara Lynn, what did I just say?
- But she asked.

817
01:07:42,121 --> 01:07:44,783
- It ain't polite not to answer.
- You better get to class.

818
01:07:45,557 --> 01:07:48,424
- Don't believe a word he says about me.
- Go on.

819
01:07:49,328 --> 01:07:51,796
Just because Judd probably
didn't kill Nate Fowler...

820
01:07:51,964 --> 01:07:54,933
...doesn't mean he's ever gonna be nice.
- Or normal even.

821
01:08:25,597 --> 01:08:28,498
Marty, you got a minute?

822
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:30,328
Well, I guess so.

823
01:08:30,502 --> 01:08:32,800
Well, I just wanted you to know that...

824
01:08:32,971 --> 01:08:34,199
That Beau's all right.

825
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:36,804
Yeah, I thought so.

826
01:08:38,944 --> 01:08:41,003
He pretty near chewed my leg off.

827
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,513
Well...

828
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:49,051
...I just wanted you to know...

829
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:52,420
...that it didn't mean anything.

830
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:54,456
Me hollering at you.

831
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:56,788
I mean, it was just...

832
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:58,594
Just part of the moment.

833
01:09:00,132 --> 01:09:02,191
It's all right, Judd.

834
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:09,131
Well...

835
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:11,636
...we'll see you around.

836
01:09:25,724 --> 01:09:29,182
I just kind of feel like all the work
I've been doing is for nothing.

837
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:31,420
I mean, I tried to help Judd
and his dogs...

838
01:09:31,597 --> 01:09:33,588
...but I just don't think they've changed.

839
01:09:33,765 --> 01:09:37,462
I've known Judd almost my entire life.

840
01:09:38,003 --> 01:09:39,595
Most of that time I hated him.

841
01:09:40,639 --> 01:09:42,698
But you changed that.

842
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:46,971
What you did to Judd made me see
a different side of him, a good side.

843
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:51,472
Nobody's gonna
change completely overnight.

844
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:54,644
And Judd is never gonna be perfect.

845
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,653
I just don't think
I can ever trust him again.

846
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,958
Not around Shiloh or anyone else.

847
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:01,683
Well...

848
01:10:02,294 --> 01:10:04,956
...that's a decision for you to make.

849
01:10:05,864 --> 01:10:07,957
I know you'll do the right thing.

850
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:13,904
Tinkerbell just had her kittens.

851
01:10:16,308 --> 01:10:18,333
- Looks like there's six of them.
- Oh, my.

852
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:20,444
What am I gonna do
with all those kittens?

853
01:10:20,612 --> 01:10:23,581
I'll put up a sign at school.
There's somebody that'll want them.

854
01:10:23,749 --> 01:10:26,843
- That's sweet of you.
- You have to wait until they're 8 weeks old.

855
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:29,783
- They won't be old enough till then.
- Of course.

856
01:10:30,923 --> 01:10:33,687
If you don't mind, I might take
that black-and-white one.

857
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:37,590
- Of course, whichever one you want.
- Marty, you already have Shiloh.

858
01:10:37,763 --> 01:10:42,530
Oh, it ain't for me. It's a surprise
for someone who'll never expect it.

859
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:53,606
Here.

860
01:10:56,248 --> 01:10:57,681
This part got poison on it?

861
01:10:58,216 --> 01:11:01,982
No, just decided I like you better
than I thought I did.

862
01:11:08,894 --> 01:11:10,418
Come on.

863
01:11:12,965 --> 01:11:14,455
You all right?

864
01:11:14,633 --> 01:11:16,191
You know, Marty...

865
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:19,997
...what you're doing with Shiloh,
and now with Judd...

866
01:11:20,906 --> 01:11:22,897
I'm real glad you're my son.

867
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:26,203
I don't think I did anything
I shouldn't have.

868
01:11:26,378 --> 01:11:28,869
That's exactly it, honey.
You followed your heart...

869
01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:31,641
...knowing it's the right thing to do.

870
01:11:31,817 --> 01:11:35,810
- Ain't that what we're supposed to do?
- It is what we're supposed to do, honey.

871
01:11:35,988 --> 01:11:39,082
But sometimes we just ignore
what our hearts are telling us.

872
01:11:39,257 --> 01:11:43,193
- I just hope something good comes of it.
- It will.

873
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,024
I'll bet on it.

874
01:11:54,806 --> 01:11:56,034
What is it, boy?

875
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:06,879
"From Judd."

876
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,352
What should we do, Shiloh?

877
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,067
Looks like you owe me...

878
01:12:30,242 --> 01:12:32,073
...a hundred and seventy-five dollars.

879
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:39,811
Hey, stop!

880
01:12:40,585 --> 01:12:43,247
Dara Lynn, stop that.
Dara Lynn, stop that.

881
01:12:43,422 --> 01:12:45,652
Dara Lynn, I got no patience
with you today.

882
01:12:47,325 --> 01:12:51,625
David, I'm sorry. I've got a toothache,
and I'm gonna go to the dentist.

883
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:53,862
- Stupid old dog!
- Hey!

884
01:12:54,032 --> 01:12:56,227
- Oh, Dara Lynn!
- Don't you ever hit my dog.

885
01:12:56,401 --> 01:12:58,631
- Dara Lynn!
- It's over! This game's over.

886
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:01,364
Go on outside and play, both of you.

887
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,337
I don't even care.

888
01:13:04,309 --> 01:13:06,903
I'm gonna have to go off
to the dentist, it's 2:00.

889
01:13:07,079 --> 01:13:09,411
Mrs. Ellison was supposed
to come watch you kids...

890
01:13:09,581 --> 01:13:12,379
...but she must've got held up.
- We don't need a sitter.

891
01:13:12,551 --> 01:13:16,009
Well, maybe not, but the girls do.
I want you two to behave for her too.

892
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:18,156
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

893
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:35,863
Hello?

894
01:13:36,942 --> 01:13:38,671
No, that's fine.

895
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:42,571
No, everything's all right here.
All right. Okay, bye.

896
01:13:42,948 --> 01:13:46,714
That was Mrs. Ellison. Said her battery
is dead and can't make it over here.

897
01:13:50,489 --> 01:13:52,081
Hello?

898
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:54,681
What?

899
01:13:55,026 --> 01:13:56,823
You're kidding!

900
01:13:57,262 --> 01:14:00,197
Michael said he saw Judd
throw one of his dogs in the river.

901
01:14:00,365 --> 01:14:03,664
- Should be by here in five minutes.
- What are we waiting for?

902
01:14:06,371 --> 01:14:10,137
We'll be back in 15 minutes.
Stay inside and don't go anywhere.

903
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:14,875
Come on!

904
01:14:26,858 --> 01:14:29,418
- What do you suppose it is?
- I don't know.

905
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:31,323
Bet he killed one of his dogs.

906
01:14:31,496 --> 01:14:33,555
I sure hope not.

907
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:40,062
Hey, there's something.

908
01:14:46,178 --> 01:14:48,271
Holy moly!

909
01:14:48,547 --> 01:14:51,038
What are you staring at, Marty?

910
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:54,409
Go on back home, now!

911
01:14:57,556 --> 01:15:00,423
- It's just a dummy.
- Oh, shoot.

912
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:03,225
- What is it?
- Nothing, just a dummy.

913
01:15:03,395 --> 01:15:06,796
- Go on back to the house.
- Mom didn't say I couldn't come down here.

914
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:10,799
- I could walk on the bridge, same as you.
- We're all going back.

915
01:15:13,104 --> 01:15:15,402
Gotta think of something
to get even with Michael.

916
01:15:15,574 --> 01:15:18,941
He's probably laughing at us
right now for believing him.

917
01:15:19,244 --> 01:15:22,736
If he tells anyone at school
about this, I'll give it to him good.

918
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:24,176
Where's Dara Lynn?

919
01:15:25,116 --> 01:15:27,914
- Dara Lynn!
- Look at me, I'm flying.

920
01:15:28,453 --> 01:15:30,546
Get down from there!

921
01:15:34,192 --> 01:15:35,955
Dara Lynn!

922
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:38,885
Come on!

923
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:53,170
I'm coming, Dara Lynn!

924
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:12,796
Careful, Marty!

925
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:22,270
- What happened?
- Dara Lynn fell in the water.

926
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,967
- Marty's trying to save her!
- Oh, Lord, no! I'll go call the police.

927
01:16:27,445 --> 01:16:29,276
Please don't let her die.

928
01:16:36,454 --> 01:16:37,978
I'm here, Dara Lynn.

929
01:16:46,164 --> 01:16:49,065
I got her, Shiloh. Go on back to shore.

930
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:50,462
You can do it, Marty!

931
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:57,068
We're almost there. You can make it.

932
01:16:57,242 --> 01:16:58,869
Come on, grab the dock.

933
01:17:05,116 --> 01:17:06,447
You could've got killed.

934
01:17:07,852 --> 01:17:10,650
- We don't have to tell mom, do we?
- Of course we do.

935
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,648
Marty, look at Shiloh!

936
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:15,984
Shiloh!

937
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:21,797
- He must've got caught in the current.
- He's headed toward Miller Falls. Hurry!

938
01:17:36,414 --> 01:17:39,144
Wait! Stop! Stop!

939
01:17:40,352 --> 01:17:42,286
- What's wrong?
- There's been an accident.

940
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:45,321
It's Marty and Shiloh.
If you hurry, maybe you can help.

941
01:17:49,661 --> 01:17:52,528
Wait, Judd, you're going
the wrong way! Wait!

942
01:17:52,697 --> 01:17:55,063
Why won't you do something?

943
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:05,238
Shiloh! Here, boy! Come here!

944
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,707
Here, boy!

945
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:10,375
- Is that your dog?
- Yeah.

946
01:18:10,548 --> 01:18:12,573
He's in trouble.
He's headed for the falls.

947
01:18:12,751 --> 01:18:15,447
- I gotta save him.
- I can't let you. It's too dangerous.

948
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,350
- Well, I've got to!
- No, no, no! Hey, come back here!

949
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:27,289
Be careful, Marty!

950
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:26,589
- Judd.
- You all right?

951
01:19:26,758 --> 01:19:29,886
- Yeah.
- Can you make it to the riverbank?

952
01:19:30,428 --> 01:19:34,364
- But Shiloh.
- I'll get Shiloh, you get to the bank.

953
01:19:41,005 --> 01:19:44,497
- Is that Judd?
- Yeah, he's gonna get himself killed.

954
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:55,485
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

955
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:45,868
He's got him!

956
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:51,203
Yes! Yes!

957
01:20:51,943 --> 01:20:54,002
Yes! Yes!

958
01:21:08,927 --> 01:21:11,191
Congratulations, Judd.

959
01:21:24,509 --> 01:21:26,170
- Shiloh.
- Shiloh's something special.

960
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:27,868
I'll tell you something...

961
01:21:53,605 --> 01:21:55,505
Thanks for saving Shiloh, Judd.

962
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:57,635
Yeah, thanks, Judd.

963
01:21:58,176 --> 01:22:00,474
I... Well, I...

964
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:02,704
I just did what I had to do.

965
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,974
Especially after everything
you've done for me.

966
01:22:06,618 --> 01:22:08,142
You know...

967
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:09,911
...you and your family...

968
01:22:10,088 --> 01:22:12,454
...the only people who ever
give a lick about me.

969
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:14,854
Don't say that, Judd.

970
01:22:15,026 --> 01:22:16,516
Well, it's the truth, ain't it?

971
01:22:17,362 --> 01:22:20,160
Ain't nobody around here
I can call a friend.

972
01:22:20,598 --> 01:22:23,226
- Yes, there is.
- Who?

973
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:24,997
Me.

974
01:22:28,406 --> 01:22:29,839
You mean that?

975
01:22:31,876 --> 01:22:33,810
And Shiloh would too.

976
01:22:37,815 --> 01:22:39,715
Well, then.

977
01:23:03,741 --> 01:23:05,834
Mom, Dad!

978
01:23:07,145 --> 01:23:08,874
Daddy!

979
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:12,682
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I know you are.

980
01:23:13,951 --> 01:23:17,978
<i>I won't repeat what my folks
said to us later. They were pretty mad.</i>

981
01:23:18,156 --> 01:23:20,750
If it happens again, I'm gonna skin you.

982
01:23:21,125 --> 01:23:24,561
<i>But it was weird how much they hugged
and kissed us at the same time.</i>

983
01:23:24,729 --> 01:23:27,095
<i>Like they were just happy
that we were all alive.</i>

984
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:43,378
You're gonna be having to share
that milk with someone else.

985
01:23:43,548 --> 01:23:47,143
- Why?
- We're getting a new member of the family.

986
01:23:47,318 --> 01:23:49,081
Mom's having another baby?

987
01:23:51,589 --> 01:23:52,817
No.

988
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:55,288
It's a birthday present
from me to you, Dara Lynn.

989
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,860
Stay right here.

990
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:01,129
- What is it, Mom?
- I can't say.

991
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:04,325
- Dad?
- I never know anything.

992
01:24:06,471 --> 01:24:08,132
Marty, a kitten!

993
01:24:08,306 --> 01:24:09,898
I love you!

994
01:24:13,211 --> 01:24:14,473
Oh, my gosh.

995
01:24:14,645 --> 01:24:16,340
Thank you.

996
01:24:18,649 --> 01:24:21,209
Well, I never thought I'd see the day.

997
01:24:21,385 --> 01:24:24,513
I wouldn't worry about it.
I don't think it'll last.

998
01:24:27,191 --> 01:24:28,681
Now, this will make it easier...

999
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,158
...to get in and out.
- Yep.

1000
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:35,155
Let's try. Looks good.

1001
01:24:37,401 --> 01:24:39,869
Looks good. All right.

1002
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:47,841
<i>After the creek incident...</i>

1003
01:24:48,012 --> 01:24:50,572
<i>... Judd was like a hero in town.</i>

1004
01:24:50,782 --> 01:24:54,684
<i>They even asked Judd to work
with the rescue squad in Sisterville.</i>

1005
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:58,148
<i>- Judd even got interviewed on TV.
- Yes, sir...</i>

1006
01:24:58,322 --> 01:25:00,313
...I was scared...

1007
01:25:01,192 --> 01:25:04,889
...but I was more scared
of not saving them.

1008
01:25:06,798 --> 01:25:08,095
You know...

1009
01:25:08,266 --> 01:25:10,325
...them two saved me one time.

1010
01:25:12,804 --> 01:25:15,568
<i>- Be careful.
- I don't know if a dog or a man...</i>

1011
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:19,767
<i>... gets to the place where he
can forget as well as forgive.</i>

1012
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,477
<i>But somehow...</i>

1013
01:25:24,649 --> 01:25:28,278
<i>... Shiloh finally crossed that bridge
to Judd's shack.</i>

1014
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,553
<i>Shiloh must know he's mine...</i>

1015
01:25:30,721 --> 01:25:33,121
<i>- ... for as long as he lives.
- You crossed the bridge.</i>

1016
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:36,818
<i>- And nothing's gonna change that.
- You wanna go see Judd? Come on.</i>

1017
01:25:52,877 --> 01:25:54,310
Hey.

1018
01:26:00,618 --> 01:26:02,779
<i>Know what else I'm thinking?</i>

1019
01:26:04,722 --> 01:26:07,020
<i>If you open your heart...</i>

1020
01:26:07,825 --> 01:26:10,225
<i>... anything is possible.</i>
