before many can remember,

3
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:48,339
A warlord named Piccolo
came from beyond the stars,

4
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:52,468
bringing darkness and chaos
to our once peaceful world.

5
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,845
Aided by his disciple, Oozaru,

6
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,600
the evil pair brought the human race
to the brink of annihilation.

7
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,728
Cities and countries
crumbled beneath them.

8
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,981
Countless lives were lost.

9

But, finally,

10
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:12,071

11

Piccolo deep within the Earth.

12

With his master captured,
Oozaru disappeared,

13
