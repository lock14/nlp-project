GOHAN: ln a time
before many can remember,



our planet faced its greatest challenge.



A warlord named Piccolo
came from beyond the stars,



bringing darkness and chaos
to our once peaceful world.



Aided by his disciple, Oozaru,



the evil pair brought the human race
to the brink of annihilation.



Cities and countries
crumbled beneath them.



Countless lives were lost.



But, finally,



a group of brave warriors
created the Ma Fu Ba,



a powerful enchantment that imprisoned
Piccolo deep within the Earth.



With his master captured,
Oozaru disappeared,



and balance
was slowly restored to our world.



And so it has remained
for thousands of years.



Until now.



The first rule is,



there are no rules.



First one to touch the ground loses.



Prepare to eat dirt.



(EXCLAlMlNG)



Whoa, whoa, whoa!



(CHUCKLlNG)



(EXCLAlMS)



(GOHAN LAUGHlNG)



(BUZZlNG)



(EXCLAlMS)



(GOHAN LAUGHlNG)



Harsh. Man!



Shadow Crane Strike. You fell for it again.



Yeah, well, it's kind of hard
to block a move that l can't see.



Goku, you rely too heavily
on your external senses.



To see, to hear, to touch are all overrated.



No, true power comes from inside. Your Ki.



Yeah, that's your best defense
and your greatest weapon.



See? Now, use your Ki.



(GROANS)



-l'm sorry, Grandpa. l didn't feel a thing.
-Someday, Goku.



Yeah, someday l'll beat you.



That'll be something to tell your friends.
Beating up on a 70-year-old man.



What friends? Everybody at school
treats me like l'm nothing, Grandpa.



-You're special, Goku.
-No, l'm different.



l know that, and they know that, too.



They push me so far that l wanna explode.



You know, l could tear them apart
with one hand.



l don't train you to fight boys, Goku.
You promised.



Okay! You made me promise not to fight.



Then teach me something l can use.
Teach me...



Teach me how to get the girl.



Teach me how to talk to her without
stumbling all over everything l say.



Teach me how to be normal.



Normal is also overrated.



You must have faith in who you are.



(SCOFFS)



Goku.



Happy birthday.



(LAUGHlNG) You think l forgot?



Sushinchu is yours.



-GOKU: What is it?
-lt's a Dragonball.



Sushinchu means "four stars".



ln all the world, there are only six others.
From one to seven stars.



Besides you, Goku, it's my only treasure.



-So what's it do?
-By itself, nothing.



But, together, the seven Dragonballs
will grant the holder one perfect wish.



So keep it safe always.



Thanks, Grandpa.



(CHUCKLlNG)



(TlRES SQUEALlNG)



What the...



Hey, Fuller. Hey, Fuller!
You just wrecked my bike!



Agundes, did you just fart, man?



'Cause l could have swore
l just heard something.



You're gonna pay for this, Fuller.



Make me pay, Geeko.



Come on. Come on, Geeko. Right here.



Come on, baby. Show me what you've got.



(BOYS LAUGHlNG)



Just like l thought. Nothing.



Carey, let's go. l'm gonna be late for class.



Beauty awaits me.



-What's up, baby?
-GlRL: Hey.



BOY: Looks like he's gonna cry.



(MAN SHOUTlNG)



(PANTlNG)



(lN JAPANESE)



lt's all right.



(CREAKlNG)



(WEAPON CHARGlNG)



(lN JAPANESE)



l have what you want.



On your knees.



(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG)



(GUN COCKlNG)



This is an astrological phenomenon
known as a complete solar eclipse.



ln two weeks' time,
we'll all have the opportunity



to experience this rare phenomenon
for ourselves.



Now, what causes eclipses?



-WEAVER: Mr. Kingery?
-(SlGHS) Weaver?



WEAVER: A solar eclipse
is caused by the moon



blocking the sun from the Earth.



KlNGERY: Correct.
From the dawn of civilization,



superstitions have marked solar eclipses
as the sign of the Apocalypse.



ln lndia, for example,
the eclipse symbolizes Rahu,



demon of darkness, devouring the sun.



The Chinese believe
an eclipse is caused by...



KlNGERY: Goku?



-Goku!
-Yeah. What?



What might our ancestors say
about the upcoming solar eclipse?



(STUTTERlNG)



Well, my grandfather would say,
"Beware of the Nameks."



Nameks?



Yeah. They're an alien race
that nearly destroyed Earth over



two thousand years ago.



Well. Let's hope it doesn't happen again.



(STUDENTS LAUGHlNG)



CHl CHl: Oh, no.



(SOFT BEEPlNG)



Oh, great. Not again.
l hate those things. They never work.



And just look at my picture.



l have a paper due next period,
and it's stuck in here.



(SCHOOL BELL RlNGlNG)



Gotta go.



(BANGlNG)



(GRUNTlNG)



Damn it!



(EXCLAlMS)



Hey! Goku, right?



-Did you do that?
-Uh... Yeah.



You used your Ki.



Wait, you know about Ki?



Just because my name is Chi Chi
doesn't make me a complete idiot.



Right. Right, 'cause there's
a lot stupider names than Chi Chi.



l'm not saying
that Chi Chi's a stupid name.



l'm just saying that it's not normal.



But normal is overrated.



l'm not saying that you're stupid
or overrated. l'm just...



l mean, l'll stop now.



Hey! l'm having a party tonight
at my house.



l'll be there.



-Okay.
-Yes!



Hi. Hi.



Hi, Chi Chi. Hi.



Goku! l got fresh chicken feet!



Couldn't find good swallow's tongue,
but the squabs were fat.



Beauty awaits.



Yeah, yeah, yeah.



(SLURPlNG)



Goku? Happy birthday!



(LAUGHlNG)



Goku?



(DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG)



BOY 1 : Check it out.
BOY 2: There he is.



-What are you doing here, Geeko?
-l'm just going to the party.



l was invited.
l'm not looking for any trouble.



Trouble found you, freak. So listen,
why don't you turn around, walk away,



no one will even know you were here.



See you.



BOY 1 : Later, loser.
BOY 2: All right.



(LAUGHlNG)



l'm not doing that anymore.



l made a promise that l wasn't gonna fight.



What?



-l made a promise that l'm not gonna fight.
-Don't worry. lt won't be a fight.



lt'll be a massacre.



Missed.



(GRUNTS)



Missed again.



(EXCLAlMS)



(GROANS)



(WHlMPERlNG)



That's gotta hurt.



Hey, Chi Chi!
Hey, thanks for inviting me to your party.



And Fuller?



Your boys, they've been showing me
what they got.



Nothing.



-You're so dead.
-No, Carey, stop!



(CAR ALARM BLARlNG)



-My car!
-Nice swing. Good form.



Close one.



(EXCLAlMS)



(ALL GASPlNG)



Doing good.



(TAUNTlNG) Hey, Fuller.



Hey, you got a couple of dings there
you might want to try buffing out.



(BOTH GROANlNG)



(TRANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG)



(CHUCKLlNG)



You've never done this before, have you?



Yes. Many times. ln my head.



You're different.



l like different.



l know this may be hard to believe,
but we're a lot alike.



(LAUGHS) This is the best birthday
l've ever had.



Today's your birthday?



Yeah, actually right now.



Ever since l can remember,



me and my grandpa celebrate my birthday
at the exact same time.



He calls it my grand entrance.



-What happened to your parents?
-l don't know.



But my grandpa said
everything will be explained to me



when l turn 1 8.



And l'm 1 8.



Cool.



(BOTH LAUGHlNG)



Yeah! Come on.



Piccolo.



lt's not here.



(GROANlNG)



l will have the Dragonball, old man.



Something's wrong.



-Something's wrong with my grandpa.
-What?



l have to go. l'm sorry.



-Goku?
-l'll see you later!



Grandpa!



Grandpa! Grandpa!



(GROANlNG lN PAlN)



(GOHAN MOANS)



No.



Come on, Grandpa. Come on, come on.



-Grandpa, l'm gonna go get help.
-No. Stay here with me.



Not much time left.



l'm sorry.
l'm so sorry, Grandpa, l wasn't here.



-What happened?
-Piccolo has returned.



-He's after the Dragonball. ls it safe?
-Yeah.



GOHAN: lt has begun.



Goku, find Master Roshi in Paozu.



Tell him Piccolo has returned.



To banish Piccolo from this world,



you must find the Dragonballs
before the eclipse.



-What?
-"Seven Dragonballs must be found



"for all men's fate will be bound..."



All right, Grandpa, stop it, stop it.
You have to rest. You have to rest.



Goku, remember,



always have faith in who you are.



(SOBBlNG)



(SNlFFLlNG)



Grandpa...



(GOHAN LAUGHlNG)



(GLASS TlNKLlNG)



Where is it? l know it's here.



Are you Piccolo?
Did you kill my grandfather?



Listen, idiot, if l was a piccolo,
whatever that is, l wouldn't tell you.



And if l did kill your grandfather,
l would have shot you by now.



Somebody stole my promethium orb,
and l'm here to get it back.



What?



(LOCATOR BEEPlNG)



You have it.



Nice move. But l'm not gonna miss again.



My father found that promethium orb
20 years ago,



and you stole it from me last night.
l'm not leaving here without it.



l don't know what you're talking about.
This is a Dragonball.



Sushinchu. Four-star ball.



l promised my grandfather
l would keep it safe,



so l'm not letting anyone take it from me.



Four stars? Promethium orb has five stars.



Who's the idiot? Look at it.



Oh, my God. l could have killed you.



You weren't even close.



l knew it. There are others.



Seven, to be exact.



-What do you want for this one?
-lt's not for sale.



-Everybody's got a price.
-Not me.



What happened to your Dragonball?



Last night,
a thief broke into my father's company,



the Capsule Corporation.



Somebody hacked the vault,
killed the guards,



and stole the Dragonball.



l swore to my father l'd get it back.



l followed the signal here,
and that's when l ran into you.



l'm sorry l fired on you.
l thought you were a murdering thief.



l'm just lucky you weren't a better shot.



-How did you know l had the Dragonball?
-A little machine l invented.



This can detect and locate
the signature wavelengths



emitted by the Dragonballs. See?



(SOFT BEEPlNG)



You made a Dragonball Energy Locator?



-Cool.
-Dragonball Energy. DBE.



-Catchy name.
-So you must be a scientist.



PhD in Applied Dynamics,
with a minor in Tactical Weaponry.



l'm close to a breakthrough. l can feel it.



The key must be the other Dragonballs.
l have to have them all.



What good's the Dragonballs
gonna do you?



They're gonna make me famous.



l'm gonna make them
an unlimited source of energy.



Good luck with that.



l'm Goku. You know,
maybe we could help each other.



See, l need to find a Master Roshi
in Paozu.



lf you take me there,
l'll help you find the Dragonballs.



l have the DBE. Why would l need you?



Well, obviously
somebody else is looking for them.



And you, you might need backup.



Bulma Briefs.



Hey, where's your...



Ride?



Cool.



AUTOMATED VOlCE:
Directory information downloaded.



l have tried every possible spelling
of Roshi in the directory.



-He's not listed.
-Did you try "Master"?



-M-A-S...
-(SlGHS) ldiot.



Are you sure you don't want one?



-He's here.
-How do you know?



l can always sense my grandfather.



l know he's gone now, but l can...
l'm getting the same feeling.



(LOCATOR BEEPlNG)



There's another Dragonball here. Let's go!



(GRUNTS)



Bulma! Bulma! Bulma, wait!



(WHlSPERlNG) Bulma, wait. Bulma,
you can't just break into someone's house.



-We're not breaking in. Door's unlocked.
-All right, this girl's out of control.



(WHlSPERlNG) Bulma.



Bulma.



(CLATTERlNG)



No!



(SOFT DlNG)



(GASPS)



Thief!



(SCREAMlNG)



This is not what you...



(ROSHl EXCLAlMlNG)



(GROANS)



(CRACKlNG)



-This is not happening.
-Believe it, punk.



You are getting your clock cleaned.



(GROANS)



You've been trained well.



-Stop! You both have to stop!
-Now l'm going to end it.



(EXCLAlMS)



Sorry!



Shadow Crane Strike.
l'd recognize that anywhere.



How is Gohan?



-You knew my grandfather?
-Knew him? l trained him.



You are Master Roshi.



l am Muten-Roshi, the lnvincible!



(LAUGHlNG)



My grandfather is dead.



He was murdered. l will avenge him.



But before he died,



he asked me to find you
and to tell you that Piccolo has returned.



He said that you would know what to do.



He also told me a poem.



lt was, "Seven Dragonballs..."



"Seven Dragonballs must be found



"for all men's fate will be bound



"to battle forces of death and fear



"and compel Shenlong to appear."



lt was a nursery rhyme
told to us by ancient master.



Then you probably know we have to find
the Dragonballs before the eclipse.



Eclipse?



Do you have a Dragonball?



Bikini Quarterly?



(CHUCKLlNG SELF-CONSClOUSLY)



That's a collector's edition.



(ROARlNG)



(GASPlNG)



lf the prophecy is true, in seven days,



the sun will be eclipsed
by the blood moon.



That will be the beginning
of the Apocalypse.



Roshi, don't be crazy.
You said it yourself. lt's a nursery rhyme.



Yes. Because before tonight,
l could make no sense of it.



But, finally, l can see.



You! You are the key, somehow.



Gohan knew it. That's why he trained you.



Okay, Goku. This has been great.



You found your Master Roshi,
l kept my part of the bargain,



now it's time for you to keep yours.
Let's go.



lf what Gohan said is true
and Piccolo is here,



this wish may be the only thing
that can save our world.



We'll go.



But we go together.



Much easier to find without the water.



l will take you to a secret place



where a chosen few were taught to master
the energy of the three elements,



air, fire and water.



Shadow Crane Strike is the most basic
of all the air-bending techniques.



To learn what l have to teach you,
you have to become stronger.



(BULMA LAUGHlNG)



You wanted him. Although l am beginning
to appreciate the entertainment value.



All right.



(BULMA SlGHS)



Leave your hand there another second
and you'll lose it.



Let's go.



The Stone Temple has been a source



of solitude and enlightenment
for millennia.



Here, you will learn what l learned
from the ancient master.



(ROSHl EXCLAlMS)



(PEOPLE CHATTERlNG)



BULMA: l thought you said
this place is secret.



Chi Chi?



Chi Chi!



(GROANS)



(CHEERlNG)



Wow.



Hey, Goku! What are you doing here?



l was just about to ask you the same thing.



-Walk with me?
-Yeah.



This is where everyone comes to train
for the big tournament in Toi San.



That's what l wanted to tell you
at the party before you suddenly took off.



l heard about your grandfather's accident.
l'm so sorry.



The house collapsed?



Yeah, something like that.



Hey, what was it
that you wanted to tell me?



Nobody at home knows this,
but l'm a fighter, too.



They just wouldn't understand.



Goku! Let's go!



l gotta go.



Come to the tournament in Toi San.
Maybe we can find some time to mix it up.



Okay.



We can't train here. My Ki is shriveling up.



Hey! At least this won't be a total waste.



l got a signal from a Dragonball. Let's go.



Now, one hand.



To master the second level of air bending,
you have to control two things at once.



Knock this orange from my hand.



(GRUNTS)



(LOCATOR BEEPlNG)



l'm getting a strong signal
from a Dragonball only three miles ahead.



(ALL EXCLAlMlNG)



(BULMA SCREAMlNG)



Sorry.



What happened?
That hole came out of nowhere.



Whoa!



Need any help down there?



Let me handle this.



You are such a lifesaver.
We are just stuck down here.



l'd be so grateful if you could just help me
and my friends out.



For a pretty thing like you? No problemo.



Thank you. You're a real gentleman.



Yamcha, at your sercice.



-l'm gonna need some payment.
-BULMA: Payment?



-Who do you think made this trap?
-Wait a minute.



ls that a Capsule RX 550 Roadster
l see down there?



(CHUCKLES) Yo! l'll take that!



-You're nothing but a lowlife bandit!
-Yeah. But one with a ladder.



Just think it over,
'cause after the sun comes out,



it's gonna be hot, hot, hot. Hot!



(GOKU GRUNTlNG)



Now all we need are marshmallows
and a ghost story.



We have no marshmallows,
but l do have a story.



Two thousand years ago,
the Earth was nearly destroyed,



not by man, but by gods from the sky.



Their names were Piccolo and Oozaru.



Seven mystics banded together
to fight the invaders.



They sacrificed their lives
to cast the Ma Fu Ba,



a powerful curse that imprisoned Piccolo.



Now, Piccolo has somehow escaped.



ln two days,
the blood moon will eclipse the sun



and bring forth Oozaru, his disciple.



To stop Piccolo,
whoever can find all seven Dragonballs



can resurrect the power of Shenlong
and be granted one perfect wish.



Unless we find the Dragonballs



and use our wish
to banish Piccolo from this world,



we will have no defense
against the onslaught.



What a crock.
You expect me to believe that?



ROSHl: l do not.



l think you are the kind of person
who does not believe in anything.



-l feel sorry for you.
-Yeah, whatever.



l'm not the one stuck in the hole.



Let us out! Now!



(GRUNTlNG)



Whoa, there, jumping bean.



One more outburst like that
and l'm out of here.



(LOCATOR BEEPlNG)



The Dragonball is close.
But l think it's buried underground.



Enough games. We have no time to waste.
Send down a net.



Hey, Rosh!
We're gonna need some tools to excavate!



How would you like to make more money
than you ever dreamed of?



(LAUGHlNG) Now you're talking, bro.



lf that DBE thing is right,
the ball you're looking for is right here!



Let's go, come on!



You have no right to give away
a third of the royalties to my invention.



One day,
Dragonballs could power the world.



Don't worry. A third of zero is still zero.



Done! Whoo! Yeah!



(EXHALES)



Well, l guess if you hadn't robbed us,



we wouldn't be able
to get this Dragonball.



Well, everything happens for a reason, bro.



Got that one from daytime TV.



GOKU: The Dragonball is close.



ROSHl: Be on your guard.
Piccolo is also after the Dragonball.



l followed Muten-Roshi, as directed.
He is training the boy, Son Goku.



l could disrupt them.



No.



This will require more than a disruption.



(YELLlNG)



Your blood will give it life.



(SCREAMlNG)



The Dragonballs are within my grasp.



And with them,
the power to destroy this world.



So, after we get the seven Dragonballs,
how soon can l expect some profit?



A month? A year?



(SlGHS)



High temps are screwing with the signal.
l can't get a good read on it.



(SCREAMlNG)



(LAUGHlNG lN PAlN) Peas and rice!
l just fried my nads!



(YELPS)



(BOTH CHUCKLlNG)



But l see it.



GOKU: The problem is how to get across.



Come on!



(GROWLlNG)



BULMA: Goku, down!



ROSHl: Hey!



-What?
-Go!



Go!



(SNARLlNG)



GOKU: Hit them, Rosh!



(GRUNTlNG)



lnto the lava!
That's the only way to stop them!



(SHRlEKlNG)



(GOKU EXCLAlMlNG)



-What are you doing?
-Making a bridge!



lmpressive.



The power to prevent this is inside you.



(GROANlNG)



Master Roshi, the Dragonballs...



-They've been speaking to you.
-Yeah.



They are showing you a future.



-There's this demon...
-Oozaru. The Destroyer.



He will kill you. And Bulma. And Yamcha.



He will destroy everything.



The future is always changing.



Let the dragon show you his lessons.



l need to somehow defeat Oozaru.



The eclipse is in two days.



We'll never find
the other Dragonballs in time.



ROSHl: There is another way
to stop Piccolo.



The only chance the world has now



is in Toi San.



Toi San.



Roshi. How is my favorite skeptic?



l come to apologize, Sifu Norris.



Everything that l questioned before



l now know is all true.



The prophecy.



The blood moon
will eclipse the sun tomorrow.



l need your help.



-l need another containment vessel.
-The Ma Fu Ba?



That will consume all of your life forces.



When you put it that way, the plan sucks.



But the boy will not be ready.



lt's the only way.
l'm the only one who can do it.



We will have it ready by the morning.



Namaste.



(CROWD CHEERlNG)



REFEREE: Ready? Let's go!



(BOTH GRUNTlNG)



(CROWD CHEERlNG)



(CROWD BOOlNG)



REFEREE: Out! Black concedes.



Why enter the tournament
if you're not gonna fight?



MALE ANNOUNCER ON PA: The winner,
by concession, red.



(FEMALE ANNOUNCER
REPEATlNG lN JAPANESE)



Goku!



You made it!



Yeah, l... What's this? Are you okay?



Yeah, it's nothing.
Are you in the tournament?



-No, l'm here for something else.
-Something more important than me?



Actually, you're one of the reasons
why it's so important.



l've got a confession to make.
l wanted to be famous.



l wanted to be rich.



Well, neither of us are gonna get
what we wanted.



Look at these people. They have no idea.



Yeah. l wish l didn't know myself.



Never thought l could enjoy
talking to a thief.



You know, l'm not so bad
once you get to know me.



Maybe l like bad men.



That's good to know
on the day before the end of the world.



(VENDOR EXCLAlMS)



(MAN SPEAKlNG JAPANESE)



Hey. We still have our Dragonballs.



That's right.



Piccolo needs all seven.
He still can't make his wish, either.



And that means
you can still make your 30%.



What? Thirty-three and a third!



-Don't push it.
-Thirty-three and a third!



The final level of the air-bending technique
is the Kamehameha.



Yeah, my grandpa told me about that.



But he said that l wasn't ready
to learn it yet.



-You are not.
-Okay.



But time is running out.



To master the Kamehameha,
you have to master your Ki.



Draw the power of the universe.



(lNHALlNG DEEPLY)



(EXHALlNG)



Channel it through you.



(EXCLAlMS)



Focus it.



Then release!



(lNCREDULOUSLY) What?



The more you put yourself
into the Kamehameha,



the greater the power.



Practice.
Light the torches in the courtyard.



l will see you in the morning.



Man.



CHl CHl: That's cheating.



You're supposed to light the torches
with your Ki.



Have you been watching me?



Then l guess you know
why l have to cheat.



(SlGHS)



You know, my grandpa always said,
in order to master my Ki,



l have to be at one with myself
and with my enemy.



-l still don't know what that means.
-Maybe you need an incentive.



Whoa!



There are five unlit torches
in this courtyard.



You're five paces away from me.



Every time you light a torch,
you get to take one step closer to me.



What happens after l light all five torches?



(CLEARS THROAT)



Then you'll be standing right next to me,
where l can reach you.



You're on.



Very impressive.



Yeah?



Not bad.



(EXHALES DEEPLY)



All right.



-Take one step back.
-That wasn't the rules!



My game, my rules.



(SlGHS)



Three more. Concentrate.



(GROANS)



lt doesn't feel right.
l must be missing something.



You have to make every move your own.



You can do this.



My own.



(CHUCKLES)



l think for the next move,



it would be better
to blow out all the torches.



(CHANTlNG)



(DEEP RUMBLlNG)



(CLATTERlNG)



(SOFT THUD)



Stop right there!



Chi Chi?



l'm sorry. l didn't mean to wake anyone.



No, l'm sorry.
Go back to what you were doing.



-No, l was just leaving.
-YAMCHA: Hey!



What are you guys doing out here?



-(QUlCKLY) Nothing.
-(QUlCKLY) Nothing.



-lsn't there a curfew in this temple?
-Good night.



-l didn't think Goku had it in him.
-lt's always the quiet ones.



-Hey, you guys are up late.
-Weren't you in your room?



(BEEPlNG)



She's got the Dragonballs.



(SCREAMS)



Who the hell are you?



(BOTH GRUNTlNG)



We'll find another way.



Chi Chi?



Help me, Goku.



(EXCLAlMS)



Goku, stop!



Oh...



Wrong one.



BULMA: Are you okay?



He's alive, but barely.



(lNHALES DEEPLY)



(GRUNTlNG)



Grandpa! l'm so happy to see you!



Wait, are you here for me?



lt is not your time, Goku.
There's much left to do.



Grandpa, how? How do l defeat Oozaru?



Always have faith in who you are.



Kamehameha!



(GROANlNG)



(YELLlNG)



Pain is good.



(COUGHS)



(BEEPlNG)



We're too late.
They have all seven Dragonballs.



Dragon Temple.
That's where he will resurrect Shenlong.



YAMCHA: Come on.



(MOANlNG)



SlFU: Roshi?



-The enchantments are strong.
-Pray it is enough to contain Piccolo.



Good luck, my friend.



Namaste.



We will meet again on the other side.



-YAMCHA: Now, where am l going?
-Dragon Temple.



We have to get there before the eclipse.



lmagine being shackled so tightly



that every atom in your body
stood compacted,



still.



That was my hell



for 2,000 years.



With this Dragonball,
l take my vengeance upon the Earth.



GOKU: Come on! Let's go!



l hope you're not trying to impress me.



l wouldn't mind, but l'll settle
for scaring the crap out of you!



(YAMCHA WHOOPlNG)



l have to stop him
before he finishes the prayer.



(CAR ALARM BLARlNG)



(YELLlNG)



No!



YAMCHA: l'm losing her!



(SCREAMlNG)



(ALL EXCLAlMlNG)



(COUGHS)



(EXCLAlMS)



l'm glad to have you join me.



You will bear witness to my glory



when l compel Shenlong to grant me
the power to rule this diseased rock.



l will defeat Oozaru,
and l am here to destroy you.



(SNlCKERS)



Defeat Oozaru?



When the blood moon eclipses the sun,



you will become Oozaru.



What? No.



There is no denial. Goku's time is over.



(GRUNTlNG)



-No. No!
-Goku is a shell.



This is who you are.



(GROWLlNG)



You traveled by meteor
to hide amongst the vermin



until your 1 8th birthday.



This is where you landed.
And where you will be reborn.



You serce me!



(SCREAMlNG)



(ROARlNG)



Goku, no!



YAMCHA: l don't think
Goku's there anymore.



Oozaru, they have a Dragonball.
Bring it to me.



(ROARlNG)



Ma Fu Ba!



(PlCCOLO SCREAMlNG)



(PANTlNG)



-What? What?
-Go.



-No.
-Go!



(PANTlNG)



(ROARlNG)



(EXCLAlMlNG)



(SCREAMS)



Roshi! Let me help you.



Too late.



(ROARlNG)



Protect the Dragonball.



Run!



Oozaru can't be beaten with fists.



Only with faith can you win.



Don't let Oozaru destroy the Goku in you.



(WEAPON CHARGlNG)



(GROWLlNG)



Always have faith in who you are.



No!



CHl CHl: You have to make
every move Your own.



GOHAN: You're special, Goku.



(SlGHS)



-lmpossible.
-Something my grandfather taught me.



First rule is, there are no rules.



(EXCLAlMS)



(BOTH SHOUTlNG)



(GROANlNG)



Wait.



Take it.



(GASPS)



The Dragonball is mine.



BULMA: l totally had that under control.



l am Goku.



l am Oozaru.



To be at one with myself, l must be two.



(ROARlNG)



l must have faith in who l am.



Human power has failed before.



Kame...



As it will...



...hame...



...again!



...ha!



(GRUNTS)



BULMA: l wish
it didn't have to end this way.



Shenlong.



One wish will be granted.



(lNHALlNG DEEPLY)



Dragon!



The test of seven has been fulfilled!



l compel you to come forth
and grant my wish!



(ROARlNG)



Give life to Muten-Roshi.



(SNEEZES)



l had the strangest dream.



l was in a place l can't describe.



l felt content, like l belonged. l was happy!



Then your grandfather, Gohan,
came up to me and kicked me out,



said there was a lot
you still needed to learn.



He's right. l'm sorry, Master Roshi.



We just weren't ready
to have you leave us.



l know. l know.



That's sweet, ladies,
but notice we're missing something here?



The Dragonballs are gone.
We have to find them again.



You ready?



l just have to do one thing.



-l didn't think l was gonna see you again.
-l'm sorry. l am so sorry that l hurt you.



l would never do that on purpose.
lt was just, l was in the heat of battle,



and l thought you were someone else...



lt's all right. l let you hit me.



-l was just too fast.
-You were fast, but l let you hit me.



Well, it was dark and confusing,
l wasn't holding back.



Okay.
lf our relationship is gonna go anywhere,



we're gonna have to settle this.
