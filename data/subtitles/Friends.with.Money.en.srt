00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,172
So the corrugated metal
not only reflects the beauty...

3
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,211
...of the common,
off-the-shelf material...

4
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:09,816
...but also emphasizes
the invisible line...

5
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,781
...between the old
and new construction.

6
00:01:11,953 --> 00:01:14,751
- Wait. There will be a line?
- It's invisible.

7
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,050
- Just let him finish.
- Oh, sorry.

8
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:21,685
Then the windows, here,
are large enough from the deck...

9
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:24,195
...you'll see the ocean
from your master bedroom.

10
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:27,630
- No way. Really? Oh, God, that's great.
- Look, honey, it's us.

11
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,570
Going this high will, of course, require
some special permits from the city.

12
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,731
- Why?
- Well, because the neighbors...

13
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:36,900
...could possibly get upset.

14
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,410
Well, I think we can live with that.

15
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,640
We want it.

16
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,875
We want it.

17
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:46,180
- Hey, you want some coffee?
- Sure.

18
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:47,616
- Yeah.
- Okay. Okay.

19
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:14,774
These shoes cost $95?

20
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:18,316
I just... I don't understand why
she has to have these kind of shoes.

21
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,978
Don't know what it is.
Her feet are growing.

22
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:24,215
Exactly. That's why we should be
buying her regular $20 crap...

23
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:27,020
...because she's gonna
outgrow them in two weeks.

24
00:02:27,195 --> 00:02:28,423
It's just the opposite.

25
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:32,088
When their feet are growing
you want the best support possible.

26
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,963
How do you know this,
this shoe theory?

27
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,660
It's just known.

28
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:39,033
Come on, sweetie,
let's go get your pajamas on.

29
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:41,767
Go to sleep. Good night.
I know it's early but good night.

30
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:59,682
Does this shirt look weird
with these pants?

31
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,226
The sitter's coming.

32
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:03,296
- Like it's too thick?
- Who cares?

33
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,063
It feels bulky.

34
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:10,727
- Why don't you answer me?
- It's fine.

35
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:15,239
Because I could put on the new
striped one. That tucks in better.

36
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,674
- What?
- You're pathetic.

37
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:21,976
- I'm putting on the new striped one.
- Good choice.

38
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:51,844
This kid played at my house all day,
and his parents don't know who I am.

39
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:55,107
- How do you know?
- I see them at school and they smile.

40
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:57,717
They don't say anything
like "thank you."

41
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,045
- That's insane.
- It is.

42
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,778
I fed him two meals...

43
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:02,684
...kissed his boo-boos,
cleaned his pee.

44
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:04,916
You think his mother
should acknowledge me.

45
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:06,355
- That's just rude.
- Yes.

46
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:08,427
I'd wanna know everything
my kid was doing.

47
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,087
Maybe the nanny didn't tell
she took him to your house.

48
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,324
- Parents know where kids go.
- Where's yours?

49
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,935
Sitting in front of <i>Dragon Ball Z
where I left him.

50
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:17,731
I think it's too violent.

51
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:20,533
- You think <i>SpongeBob</i> is too violent.
- I never said it was.

52
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,403
- I said it was ugly.
- I'm ugly.

53
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:24,807
- You know, I don't get <i>SpongeBob.</i>
- Oh, come on.

54
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,844
- Christine.
- No, I don't.

55
00:04:27,015 --> 00:04:29,415
What is...? How do you not get it?

56
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,449
Why would I say I don't if I do?

57
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:35,348
Okay.

58
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:39,823
Hey, you guys, listen. Franny and I
bought a table at an ALS fundraiser.

59
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:41,222
- Yeah.
- Will you guys come?

60
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:42,624
- No.
- No?

61
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,027
- It's at that the Casa del Mar.
- What is ALS?

62
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,666
It's Lou Gehrig's disease.

63
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,358
It's really horrible.

64
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:51,767
- I mean, it's awful.
- Okay. We'll come.

65
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:55,739
My stockbroker's wife is doing it.
It will be kind of... It will be fun.

66
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,640
That reminds me, did you guys
find a place to donate money?

67
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:00,610
Because I thought
of a couple of ideas.

68
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:03,273
Yeah, we decided we're
gonna give it to Tammy's school.

69
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:05,180
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,981
- How much?
- Don't ask that.

71
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:09,487
- I can, can't I?
- No.

72
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:11,124
Two million.

73
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:16,523
- That Shabbat <i>shalom</i> school?
- Jane.

74
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:19,696
The one that makes you sell
<i>challah</i> bread.

75
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:21,767
- Oh, I love that bread.
- Shit.

76
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:24,803
- Give the money to Olivia.
- Jane.

77
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:26,701
You're a maid. You need money.

78
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,808
No, I don't. I'm fine.

79
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:31,570
- Who's...? You're working as a maid?
- You're a teacher.

80
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:34,408
Since when? Is that, like, hip now?
Cleaning houses?

81
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:36,641
What would be hip
about working as a maid?

82
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:42,085
I don't know, like the Zen,
so un-hip it's cool.

83
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:46,190
- Can we talk about something else?
- Nothing wrong with a maid.

84
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,194
Who cares what people think?
Our maids make really good money.

85
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:52,992
- Ours goes through our stuff.
- She does not.

86
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't know. Stuff moves around.

87
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,400
Do you go through people's stuff?

88
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:02,168
- Like what?
- Like their drawers and shit.

89
00:06:02,343 --> 00:06:03,901
No.

90
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:06,137
Good, because that would be
really fucked up.

91
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:09,372
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

92
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,317
- He still smokes?
- He didn't quit.

93
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:17,253
- How can you stand it?
- Well, he doesn't make me smoke.

94
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:19,552
- Does it scare you?
- Or disgust you?

95
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:24,191
You know, there's a Tse sample sale
on next week if anyone wants to go.

96
00:06:24,365 --> 00:06:27,857
- Tse what?
- Tse cashmere.

97
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,728
Can't afford that.

98
00:06:32,006 --> 00:06:34,634
- Oh, fast.
- They wouldn't let me smoke out there.

99
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,071
They're so uptight.

100
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:39,441
Anyway, I'd like to make
a toast very much.

101
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:41,013
To Jane.

102
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:45,380
You're wonderful
and generous and talented...

103
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,283
...and have always been there for me.
- Happy birthday.

104
00:06:48,456 --> 00:06:51,254
I don't know what I'd do
without you guys.

105
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,787
I think about what my days would
be like without you as friends...

106
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:58,261
...and I would just wanna die.

107
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,301
- We love you.
- Happy birthday, sweetie.

108
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,528
What did you get her?

109
00:07:03,905 --> 00:07:04,929
This.

110
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,737
- Good taste, Aaron.
- You like it?

111
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:11,845
He's so gay.

112
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:14,311
Every time we see them
you say that.

113
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,211
It's like a person's sitting there...

114
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:20,218
...with a tree growing out of his head,
and nobody says anything.

115
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,415
I don't know.
It seems like he loves her.

116
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:27,694
So tell me what you don't get
about <i>SpongeBob.</i>

117
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:29,159
- No.
- Come on.

118
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,959
- I'm giving you the opportunity.
- I'll pass.

119
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:36,466
Well, where else are they
gonna put their money?

120
00:07:36,637 --> 00:07:40,164
I don't know. Hungry people. Us.

121
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,599
We've got money...

122
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:44,244
...and you know what?
We don't give it to hungry people.

123
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:45,879
Not that kind of money.

124
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,605
And, yes, we do give money away.

125
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:50,182
We gave away
a lot of money last year.

126
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:53,752
That's true.
But, you know, they probably do too.

127
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,056
- Jesus, poor Olivia.
- Why?

128
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,058
She's the only one not married.

129
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:03,493
- Yeah?
- Is a pothead. Is a maid.

130
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:07,191
She doesn't look unhappy,
so maybe...

131
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:11,996
Christine and David
have not had sex in almost a year.

132
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:17,206
Did you know that she has never
actually seen his asshole?

133
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:19,980
- What?
- It's a fact.

134
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:23,139
- How is that actually possible?
- I don't know.

135
00:08:23,317 --> 00:08:27,253
I guess if you didn't really
wanna see it, it could be avoided.

136
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:30,347
Oh, God, it is so sad.

137
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,226
Should we give Olivia money?

138
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:37,364
Oh, no. No, not again.

139
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:40,193
Well, I feel bad.
She's cleaning houses.

140
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:44,168
Well, it's her choice. I mean,
she could be doing something else.

141
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,499
I know, but...

142
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:49,504
Should we hire her?

143
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:51,645
To clean our hou...? Are you crazy?

144
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:53,370
Our house?

145
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:54,844
God, no.

146
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:59,709
I bet she'd get really stoned
and become a cleaning maniac.

147
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,878
- I bet she's really good.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:05,219
No, no, no. That's much worse
than giving her money.

149
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:08,089
No. No way.

150
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,381
<i>Hello?</i>

151
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:06,213
<i>Hello?</i>

152
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,967
I'm kind of sick of modern.

153
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:33,108
I swear to God, I feel like as soon
as we did it, everybody else did too.

154
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,441
You have good taste.

155
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:38,141
Or else I'm incredibly trendy.

156
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:41,817
I think it should be very minimalist.

157
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:45,287
- A minimalist family room?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,859
You know, just the necessities.
Beige, gray...

159
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:51,520
...maybe a shock of color somewhere,
like an orange lamp in the corner...

160
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:54,167
...or something like that, you know?

161
00:10:57,638 --> 00:11:01,802
So all the cleaning supplies
are under the sink in the kitchen.

162
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:06,009
- Guess I'm pretty messy.
- No. That's okay.

163
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,171
I mean, that's what I'm here for.

164
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,211
This is the kitchen.

165
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,915
I don't have a dishwasher.

166
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:22,659
So can you come on Mondays?

167
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:27,490
Yeah. Mondays are good.

168
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:31,627
And how much do you charge?

169
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:34,564
Well, let's see.

170
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,368
About $65.

171
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,480
I was kind of hoping for 50.

172
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:46,051
I don't usually charge that little.

173
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,710
Right.

174
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:59,597
- Okay.
- Really?

175
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:01,900
Yeah.

176
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,838
All right. Thank you.

177
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:13,376
How much farther
up my ass can you get?

178
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,578
- Fuck you!
- You're buying fruit!

179
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:22,985
Sad, sad, sad.

180
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:27,025
So this guy is showing me
his disgusting house...

181
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:30,357
...which clearly
he's self-conscious about.

182
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:33,762
Then he has the nerve
to ask me to take less money.

183
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:36,596
- What did you say?
- I said okay.

184
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,299
- Why? Olivia.
- Because...

185
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:43,000
If this guy is so pathetic he has
to haggle, I should just do it.

186
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,111
I mean,
that guy's worse off than I am.

187
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,339
Or you are too scared
to stick to your price.

188
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:51,713
God, I don't understand how you can
clean somebody else's toilet.

189
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:53,717
I can barely touch my own.

190
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:56,550
- You don't touch your own.
- I know it.

191
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:58,089
Now, let me ask you a question.

192
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,159
- What's with your hair?
- What do you mean?

193
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,318
Well, I mean...

194
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:05,329
...is that goop or is that just dirty?

195
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,399
No, I guess it's dirty.

196
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:10,731
- It doesn't look good.
- Lf I wash it too much, it dries it out.

197
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,032
I don't wanna talk anymore.
Gonna get a sample.

198
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:15,835
- Jane?
- Hey.

199
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,740
- Olivia, this is Maya.
- Hi, Maya. How you doing?

200
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:21,404
Your clothes are everywhere.
Seen them at Barneys.

201
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,743
Yeah, we're doing well.
Hey, congratulations.

202
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:26,478
- Obviously, you had your baby.
- Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:29,987
Jane, Olivia, this is Tal.

204
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:31,385
- Tal?
- Hi.

205
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,686
We had the hardest time
agreeing on a name.

206
00:13:33,861 --> 00:13:35,988
What if he turns out short, Maya?

207
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:40,122
You know, we actually thought about
that. My husband is kind of short.

208
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:43,236
He's young. You could always
change it. He might not notice.

209
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,167
- Okay.
- Well, no, we like the name.

210
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:48,672
- It's not tall. It's Tal.
- Oh, it's Tal.

211
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:51,534
You know what? We have to go.

212
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:53,441
It was so nice to meet you.

213
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:55,343
Yeah, congratulations. Really.

214
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:58,178
- Oh, my God.
- That was awful.

215
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:00,547
- I can't take you anywhere. Awful.
- It was a joke.

216
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:03,952
- What are you so angry about lately?
- I'm not angry.

217
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:07,287
Oh, my God. Aren't those the saddest
looking plants you have ever seen?

218
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,395
You are.
I wanna know what you're mad about.

219
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:12,828
Jesus, that's the fucker
that flipped me off. Asshole.

220
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,995
Okay, you're not angry.

221
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:17,501
You fucked at Chaya Venice?

222
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:20,336
We go there all the time.

223
00:14:20,507 --> 00:14:23,203
- They have great sushi.
- Was it on the sink?

224
00:14:23,377 --> 00:14:27,814
No, it was in the stall
up against the wall.

225
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:33,180
- Does she like this?
- She starts it.

226
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:35,754
What is that? Public places.

227
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:40,084
I don't know.
She's into getting caught.

228
00:14:40,728 --> 00:14:42,753
By whom? Daddy?

229
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:45,028
Do some raises. Ten.

230
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,661
- I'm fixing you up with Olivia.
- No, you're not.

231
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,236
You need someone normal.

232
00:14:51,405 --> 00:14:53,032
Olivia will fuck you in a bed.

233
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:56,108
- I have a girlfriend.
- She's married, you idiot.

234
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,267
And she's weird.

235
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,106
You'd be lucky to have Olivia.

236
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,111
She's great.

237
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:03,715
All right.

238
00:15:03,884 --> 00:15:05,283
Hold.

239
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:07,420
What does she do?

240
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:11,923
She used to be a teacher.
I mean, she did until about a year ago.

241
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:16,426
And she taught at this really fancy
school in Santa Monica.

242
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,258
She taught 11 th grade.

243
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:23,301
You would not believe
the cars that these kids drove.

244
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,234
And she drives up
in her ancient Honda...

245
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:29,274
...and they would give her
quarters for food.

246
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:32,935
They thought it was hilarious.
She couldn't take it anymore.

247
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:37,215
It's too bad too
because she was so good with kids.

248
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:41,616
She just loves them,
and she's so patient and giving.

249
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,988
- How are her tits?
- Up.

250
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,059
Really good.

251
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:51,426
I'm marrying Richard.
I don't care what you say.

252
00:15:51,598 --> 00:15:52,929
He's so wrong for you.

253
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,000
You don't even like the same things.

254
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,138
Doesn't matter.
We have amazing sex.

255
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,672
You know what?
I don't give a shit what you do.

256
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,706
I don't think you'd say that.

257
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,648
- Don't type that.
- I don't give a shit.

258
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,812
But you do. You just wrecked the car,
I made you so mad.

259
00:16:15,989 --> 00:16:18,184
No, I wrecked the car
because of the lap dance.

260
00:16:18,358 --> 00:16:20,849
- These people are in love.
- Says who?

261
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:24,054
- Us, at the pitch meeting.
- I don't care. I'm mad at her.

262
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:26,461
I distanced myself.

263
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,459
- I can't work like this.
- Like what?

264
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:32,537
- You're bullying me.
- I'm bullying you?

265
00:16:32,706 --> 00:16:34,867
- We're having a discussion.
- No, we're not.

266
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:38,807
You changed your mind and you're
being stubborn. We write together.

267
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:42,607
Why is there so much noise?

268
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,249
Maybe because we're building
a second story.

269
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,217
What?

270
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,994
Not too many people
could wear that color.

271
00:16:55,763 --> 00:16:57,822
You could get away with it.

272
00:16:57,998 --> 00:17:00,023
I don't know.

273
00:17:00,968 --> 00:17:02,731
Try this one on.

274
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:10,039
You can't tell shit if you don't try it.

275
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,702
- There are no dressing rooms.
- That's cool. They don't care.

276
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:17,250
Yeah. Good idea.

277
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,227
- Yeah.
- It looks good.

278
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,330
- Think I should get it?
- Yeah.

279
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:35,491
Thanks. I never would have seen it.
There's just so much stuff here.

280
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:39,070
- Pay me back with a coffee?
- A coffee?

281
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:42,868
- Have a coffee with me.
- I've gotta get back to work.

282
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,533
How about dinner?

283
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:49,377
I'm...

284
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,408
I'm married.

285
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:57,313
Oh, well. Lucky man.

286
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,054
No.

287
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,330
- Oh, hi. How are you today?
- Hi. Fine, thanks.

288
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:14,372
I'm looking for this product.
I think I saw it in a magazine.

289
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:20,844
I think they said it was for lines,
like Résolution D-Contraxol?

290
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:24,711
- Oh, yes, our Résolution.
- Oh, yeah, maybe. I think.

291
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:26,944
They said you were
giving out samples.

292
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,987
- Yeah, we are. Would you like one?
- Yeah. Sure.

293
00:18:30,157 --> 00:18:32,182
Well, you use this at night.

294
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,021
And you'll see
that the results are amazing.

295
00:18:35,195 --> 00:18:36,958
Really?

296
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,792
- That's great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

297
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:44,427
Now, you know, your oily face
could really do with some Clarifiance.

298
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,540
- Hi. Can I help you with something?
- I think so.

299
00:18:57,718 --> 00:19:01,347
I'm looking for this lotion.
I saw it in a magazine.

300
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:03,250
- I can't remember the name.
- Résolution?

301
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:05,186
Maybe. I think so.

302
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,589
Anyway, they said
you were giving out samples.

303
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:12,827
Is that it?

304
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:15,599
Great. Thank you.

305
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:18,294
You know what? I was...
Could I get one for my girlfriend?

306
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:19,939
- She had asked...
- Not a chance.

307
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:23,638
- Hi.
- Hi. You're early.

308
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,778
I had to get away
from my stupid husband.

309
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:28,938
See? This is my girlfriend.
Give her a sample.

310
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,215
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

311
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,485
- Is this actually for me?
- Give it to me.

312
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:42,859
I just think it's dangerous.

313
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,692
I mean, kids get paralyzed
falling off them.

314
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:49,324
- You put a net around it.
- I think we should just get rid of it.

315
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:50,970
I think the maid would take it.

316
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:53,038
But then her kids
would get paralyzed.

317
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,868
Oh, yeah. Right.

318
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,877
I'm worried about Richard.

319
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:03,676
He doesn't play with balls.

320
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,413
What do you mean?

321
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:10,716
Well, like at the park,
he has no interest in them.

322
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:13,652
Well, you know,
he probably does other things.

323
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:18,696
He's probably just playing with
the other boys that don't like balls.

324
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,423
Exactly.

325
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,727
Little gay boys.

326
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,771
Would it bother you if he was gay?

327
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:31,608
No, you know,
I just don't want him to have any pain.

328
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:33,541
Well, everyone has pain.

329
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:37,075
Well, then, extra gay pain.

330
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,017
- That's not funny.
- Oh, come on.

331
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:43,213
- No, it's not.
- Come on.

332
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:54,900
<i>Hi, this is Olivia. I'm not home.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

333
00:20:55,635 --> 00:20:57,500
<i>Honey, hi. It's Christine.</i>

334
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,697
<i>Listen, I just recommended you</i>
<i>to this sort of friend of mine...</i>

335
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,808
<i>... looking for someone</i>
<i>to clean her house.</i>

336
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:04,773
<i>She's very rich and very picky...</i>

337
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:06,810
<i>... but I think she'll pay</i>
<i>a lot of money.</i>

338
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,542
<i>So if Melanie Charney calls,</i>
<i>that's her. Bye.</i>

339
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:16,049
<i>And all the thoughts of the day...</i>

340
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:20,887
...are going up, up, up
and out the top of your head.

341
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:26,056
And everything is white and calm...

342
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,060
...easy and sleepy.

343
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,505
- I love you.
- I love you too.

344
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:42,474
Here's Ralphy.

345
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:49,153
Don't turn off the light.

346
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,884
- I really want another kid.
- No way.

347
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:57,496
- Why not?
- I don't know, because I'm 100.

348
00:21:57,664 --> 00:22:00,929
You are not 100. And I'm sure
we could get pregnant if we tried.

349
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:03,092
There's no way
we're gonna have another baby.

350
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,670
You can't just decide that.

351
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:20,176
Hello? Hello?

352
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,953
Hello?

353
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:24,621
Another hang-up?

354
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,419
Why do you look different?

355
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:03,654
Oh, I shaved my thing.

356
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,195
- My beard.
- Oh, my God.

357
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:06,764
Yeah, like three weeks ago.

358
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:10,900
Wow, you shaved your beard
three weeks ago?

359
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,529
God, I'm so sorry.

360
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:16,699
- For what?
- Well, for not noticing.

361
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:19,038
It's okay. I don't care.

362
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,441
- Well, it looks good.
- Thanks.

363
00:23:26,386 --> 00:23:32,222
So Franny, who I met through Jane,
my friend Jane, she designs clothing.

364
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:34,422
She's real... They're all kind of weird.

365
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:39,662
What do you...?
What do you keep looking at?

366
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,324
I think that the girl
sitting behind you...

367
00:23:42,502 --> 00:23:44,402
...is someone I went
to junior high with.

368
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:48,007
Don't, don't, don't...
Hey, hey, hey.

369
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:49,870
Please don't stare. No.

370
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:55,212
- Why not?
- How do I look?

371
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:59,048
Compared to what? We just met.

372
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:01,347
Oh, yeah.

373
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:08,457
So are you...? So you're from here?

374
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:11,995
Yes, I grew up in the Valley.

375
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:15,227
I'm sorry. It's so weird.
She hasn't changed a bit.

376
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:16,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

377
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:19,169
Well, why don't you go say hi to her?

378
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,638
Are you kidding me?
That girl ruined my life.

379
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:24,242
What, really? What did she do?

380
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:28,507
Well, we made out once
in her father's basement.

381
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:31,515
And I was in love with her,
you know?

382
00:24:31,685 --> 00:24:36,122
And we... She was my girlfriend
for, like, two hours.

383
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:38,448
And then she dumped me.

384
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,859
Yeah, exactly.

385
00:24:50,036 --> 00:24:51,697
I'm sorry.

386
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:54,635
It's wild for me to see her here.

387
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:01,937
So do you work out?

388
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:04,140
No, not really.

389
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:11,185
"We all went on safari...

390
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:13,656
...near the Serengeti gate.

391
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:17,661
- Looks like your dad's home.
- We startled wary... Wart hogs..."

392
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:20,265
- You want to do some work?
- I'm reading with Max.

393
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:21,832
We gotta work.

394
00:25:22,002 --> 00:25:25,267
Okay. We'll read more later,
okay, babe?

395
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:27,099
- Maria?
- Sorry, Mama's gotta work.

396
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:30,266
- When are we gonna get our tree?
- We got a whole month.

397
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:32,911
But when are we gonna get it?

398
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:36,842
Well, we'll get it before Christmas.

399
00:25:37,017 --> 00:25:38,450
I promise you, buddy, all right?

400
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:41,052
- Okay?
- Whatever.

401
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:06,002
Hey, hey. Wait, wait.
No, no, no, I'm paying.

402
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,204
I'm so sorry.
We had so much to catch up.

403
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:10,542
Don't let her pay. I'm paying.
I am a shithead!

404
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:14,585
- It is hard enough having a blind date.
- I know. You're absolutely right.

405
00:26:17,824 --> 00:26:20,850
Hey, so can we go out again?
Please?

406
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,291
I went ape shit back there
because that's a girl...

407
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:25,226
...who humiliated me in high school.

408
00:26:25,398 --> 00:26:28,526
Didn't anyone ever just, you know,
wreck your life...

409
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:32,468
...and then you see them as an adult?
It's intense.

410
00:26:34,307 --> 00:26:35,604
Are you stupid?

411
00:26:36,976 --> 00:26:39,035
- Kind of.
- What do you do again?

412
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:41,203
Oh, right, right,
you're Franny's trainer.

413
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:44,475
What do you do? Franny said
that you used to be a teacher.

414
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:47,249
I'm a maid.

415
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,222
Yeah, right.

416
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:52,215
- I can't be a maid?
- No, you can't.

417
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:54,326
- Not really.
- That's funny.

418
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:58,126
- You're really a maid?
- Yeah.

419
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:02,462
In fact, I have a job right now,
so I gotta go.

420
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:05,937
Can I come watch?

421
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:08,501
<i>Your sister called.</i>

422
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:09,869
- What kind of fish should we get?
- Your father's had a stroke.

423
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:11,467
- What kind of fish should we get?
- Your father's had a stroke.

424
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:12,941
Very funny.

425
00:27:13,113 --> 00:27:16,105
I have a problem with this line.
I think Elliot would believe her.

426
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:18,750
Why would he believe her?
He saw his father yesterday.

427
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:20,442
Because it's...

428
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,418
Melanie just doesn't joke like that.
It's not in her character.

429
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,955
I don't agree.

430
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:28,583
God, how did we even get this far?
We're writing two different scripts.

431
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:30,855
Every time we disagree,
you fall apart.

432
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:36,466
What?

433
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:40,800
You're eating a lot of shit lately.

434
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:42,305
What?

435
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:46,945
- I said, you're eating a lot of shit lately.
- So what?

436
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:49,172
So I can see it on your ass.

437
00:27:49,883 --> 00:27:53,250
I'm just telling you because,
you know...

438
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,980
...I thought you'd want to me to tell
if I noticed that.

439
00:27:56,689 --> 00:28:00,887
What made you think I'd want you
to tell me if my ass was getting fat?

440
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,394
Because I guess I'd want you
to tell me if I was gaining weight.

441
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:09,023
- Really, you'd want me to tell you?
- Yes, I would.

442
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:12,535
Would you want me to tell you,
for instance, you have bad breath?

443
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:14,138
Would you wanna know that?

444
00:28:15,675 --> 00:28:17,734
- I guess.
- Well, now you know.

445
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:21,108
I'm trying to get you to drink
more water not because it's healthier.

446
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:24,512
It's because your breath smells
like a dead man.

447
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:28,383
Why didn't you just tell me?
I would have got my teeth cleaned.

448
00:28:28,555 --> 00:28:31,319
Because I didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

449
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:33,118
It wouldn't.

450
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:37,752
- Really?
- It's not like it's my fault, per se.

451
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:40,533
Man, I wish I had that mechanism.

452
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,295
So not only do I have
bad breath always...

453
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:47,963
...but I'm a dick
because I don't take it personally?

454
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:52,470
I can't work anymore.

455
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:54,746
I'm out.

456
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:18,969
<i>A fat-free turkey.</i>

457
00:29:19,138 --> 00:29:21,766
She got fat-free pepperoni,
fat-free milk.

458
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:23,806
Diet this, diet that.

459
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:25,638
I Can't Believe It's Not Fat.

460
00:29:26,646 --> 00:29:28,773
Jesus. Of course, vodka.

461
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:32,440
Big bottle of tequila, more...
More vodka.

462
00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:36,055
Some Ben and Jerry's in the back.

463
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:40,488
- Makes sense now.
- Put that back.

464
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,719
She has to either get drunk
or really stoned...

465
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:45,296
...to believe that she's actually
eating something.

466
00:29:45,465 --> 00:29:47,126
Do you smoke it?

467
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,734
What, their pot?

468
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:52,599
No. I smoke my own.

469
00:29:52,772 --> 00:29:55,172
- It wrecks your brain.
- Okay.

470
00:29:55,642 --> 00:29:58,440
Here, why don't you
clean the inside of that.

471
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:00,511
That's disgusting.

472
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,477
How come you don't
have a boyfriend?

473
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:08,678
I don't know. Ask my last boyfriend.

474
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:12,087
Okay, I'm not doing a good job.
Disgusting, I'm gonna throw up.

475
00:30:12,258 --> 00:30:14,954
- Who cleans your fridge?
- Manuella.

476
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:19,064
- You gave me the worst job.
- I so did not give you the worst job.

477
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:28,531
- What are we doing?
- Well, we're dancing.

478
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:32,404
- It's fun to dance.
- Yeah.

479
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:38,214
Can I kiss you?

480
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:41,109
You seriously want to kiss me now?

481
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:48,083
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

482
00:30:48,261 --> 00:30:51,094
Do you want to put that down? Okay.

483
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,171
Where's the waiter?

484
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:01,637
You think he fell off the face
of the fucking earth.

485
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:03,036
He was nice.

486
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,972
To you maybe, he thinks you're cute.

487
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:07,203
He didn't even notice
I was sitting here.

488
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,008
- What are you talking about?
- You are so blind.

489
00:31:10,183 --> 00:31:14,119
- The waiter's, like, in love with you.
- I'm a guy and I'm with you.

490
00:31:14,287 --> 00:31:15,720
I just want the check.

491
00:31:15,888 --> 00:31:18,379
It's like they were up your ass
to get your order...

492
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:21,225
...then when you need the check,
they go out back...

493
00:31:21,394 --> 00:31:23,055
...and smoke a cigarette
or something.

494
00:31:23,663 --> 00:31:25,324
Oh, here he is.

495
00:31:25,498 --> 00:31:27,523
I hope everything was all right.

496
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,531
Can I get you anything else?

497
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:31,363
- Just the check.
- No.

498
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:39,940
Honey, look, it's one of yours.

499
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:44,043
- Yeah.
- Don't you love that?

500
00:31:44,217 --> 00:31:47,744
- She doesn't look very good in it.
- Yeah, but it's yours. You designed it.

501
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,331
- How much?
- One hundred dollars.

502
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,593
That's not bad.

503
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,293
Whoa, hello?

504
00:32:06,472 --> 00:32:08,406
I mean, I helped.

505
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:14,106
Yeah, I mean, don't you think
I should get some of the money?

506
00:32:18,384 --> 00:32:21,478
I mean, not that it's a thing, but...

507
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:30,086
I mean...

508
00:32:32,465 --> 00:32:33,796
Cool.

509
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,559
You know, you could
make a lot more training.

510
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:41,264
- You make, like, $50 an hour?
- Sixty-five.

511
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,601
I'm so out of shape.

512
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:48,110
So why is he a jerk
for not being upset?

513
00:32:48,281 --> 00:32:51,648
I mean, it sounds to me
just like he's more confident than you.

514
00:32:51,818 --> 00:32:54,719
He's a jerk because he's not upset.
Of course he's upset.

515
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:57,048
Wouldn't you be
if I told you you had bad breath?

516
00:32:57,223 --> 00:32:59,555
- You do tell me.
- And how does it make you feel?

517
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:02,991
Not great, but it doesn't, like,
rock me to the core, you know?

518
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:04,686
I just go brush my teeth.

519
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:09,164
Well, he told me I was getting fat.
That's much worse.

520
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:10,825
Are you?

521
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:12,971
Aaron, why are you
being such a jerk?

522
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:16,199
Because you are just sitting there
deciding that David's the schmuck.

523
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:17,672
Well, he is.

524
00:33:17,844 --> 00:33:22,144
Maybe and maybe not. I'm sorry,
Christine, but maybe it's partly you.

525
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:25,284
- She knows it's partly her.
- I do?

526
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:28,984
You know,
I just have to be more like Franny.

527
00:33:29,155 --> 00:33:32,147
She just shrugs everything off.
Right?

528
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:34,759
No, she shrugs because
she doesn't like confrontation.

529
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:37,623
Yeah, maybe she just
chooses her battles.

530
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:39,697
Are we going to this
fundraising thing?

531
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:42,232
- No.
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

532
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:43,834
What is it again anyway?

533
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:46,528
- Homeless.
- ALS.

534
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:48,139
- Oh, that is so sad.
- Oh, right.

535
00:33:48,307 --> 00:33:51,208
And I get to wear the Yohji jacket
I never get to wear.

536
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:52,935
You have a Yohji Yamamoto jacket?

537
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:56,240
- Yes, and he is so sexy in it.
- Is he?

538
00:33:56,415 --> 00:33:59,873
Maybe if you and David had more sex,
you'd get along better.

539
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:07,485
He's my husband. It doesn't count.
Right?

540
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:10,389
Fuck.

541
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:13,254
Well, how often
do you guys have sex?

542
00:34:13,633 --> 00:34:16,067
- Often.
- No, we don't have sex often.

543
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:19,966
Well, I thought...

544
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,403
- You know who has a lot of sex?
- Matt and Franny.

545
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:25,203
Well, I would have a lot of sex
if I had that much money.

546
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:27,505
I mean,
nothing to worry about. No stress.

547
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,875
- You're crazy.
- I'm not. Listen, they are relaxed.

548
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:31,846
- They never fight.
- I've seen them fight.

549
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:34,043
No, not often.

550
00:34:35,321 --> 00:34:37,846
You think he can't get lung cancer
because he's rich?

551
00:34:38,024 --> 00:34:40,925
- Probably.
- You're so bitter.

552
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:42,560
I cannot believe he smokes.

553
00:34:42,728 --> 00:34:45,526
- And she lets him.
- How does she let him?

554
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:47,029
By accepting it.

555
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,634
Well, good for her.
Maybe that's why they don't fight.

556
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:51,895
That and the money.

557
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:59,938
Your hair smells so good.

558
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,572
Really?

559
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:04,943
I wasn't sure that...

560
00:35:05,518 --> 00:35:08,453
...lavender-tea-grass thing
was too strong.

561
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:09,883
Oh, yes, I liked it.

562
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:11,887
- It was good.
- Really?

563
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:13,856
Yeah.

564
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:18,019
Oh, gosh.
I wonder how the blind date went.

565
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:19,824
Oh, yeah.

566
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:24,026
You know what, I don't... I don't really
see them hitting it off, you know?

567
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:26,871
I know.

568
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,473
I just wanted her to have a date.

569
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:31,439
Yeah.

570
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,108
<i>What exactly is the problem?</i>

571
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:38,182
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>She just hasn't met the right guy.</i>

572
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:41,286
<i>And until you meet the right one,</i>
<i>the others are all wrong.</i>

573
00:35:41,454 --> 00:35:43,251
<i>Boy, has she met some wrong ones.</i>

574
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:44,821
<i>Especially in her 20s.</i>

575
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:47,585
<i>My God, that was painful to watch.</i>

576
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,627
<i>I think she's still hung up</i>
<i>on that married guy, Raymond.</i>

577
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:52,093
<i>Who, Mr. Masculine?</i>

578
00:35:52,265 --> 00:35:54,756
She used to squeeze
his whiteheads.

579
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:57,596
- That's gross.
- I know.

580
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:09,109
Well, this is sad.

581
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:12,376
Yeah. He's single.

582
00:36:12,551 --> 00:36:14,985
But there is kid stuff around.

583
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:18,920
He's really got
a fantastic decorating sense.

584
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:21,318
What a piggy.

585
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:26,889
So, what does this guy
do for a living?

586
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,934
I think he's unemployed.

587
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:32,866
Yeah, his house feels unemployed.

588
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,064
And he has a maid. That's weird.

589
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:38,404
Maybe he's depressed
because he doesn't work...

590
00:36:38,577 --> 00:36:40,238
...and feels too bad to clean up.

591
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:42,346
Sounds like a real putz.

592
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:45,641
It makes sense to me.

593
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:47,786
Hey, let's fuck here.

594
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:50,947
No.

595
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:58,863
I've... Excuse me, I've...

596
00:36:59,031 --> 00:37:01,932
I've seen you in here a lot.

597
00:37:03,002 --> 00:37:05,402
Yeah, I just work up the street.

598
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:07,835
Oh, what?

599
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:10,737
- What do you do?
- I run my own company.

600
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:12,775
Oh, tell me.

601
00:37:16,882 --> 00:37:21,319
Well, it's like
an organic-bath-products company.

602
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:24,752
- Called Luscious.
- You're shitting me. I love that stuff.

603
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:26,755
You talking...?
You're talking about...

604
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:30,726
- It has the chunks of fruit in it?
- You use it?

605
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,727
I love it.

606
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:34,490
- Can I take your order?
- Yeah.

607
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:38,159
I'd like some Brie
but on wheat bread, please.

608
00:37:38,337 --> 00:37:41,170
- And you?
- I'm gonna have the exact same thing.

609
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,864
- That sounds great.
- With salad.

610
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,270
- Okay.
- You want salad?

611
00:37:44,443 --> 00:37:45,671
- Yeah.
- Okay.

612
00:37:45,845 --> 00:37:48,575
I'm Aaron, by the way.

613
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:50,807
You're kidding? I'm Aaron.

614
00:37:50,983 --> 00:37:53,850
- You're not. I'm Aaron.
- No, I'm Aaron.

615
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,454
- Nice to meet you, Aaron.
- And you, Aaron.

616
00:37:56,622 --> 00:38:00,149
- Yeah, what do you do?
- I'm a clothing designer.

617
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:02,123
Really?
My wife's a clothing designer.

618
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:05,422
- My goodness. What a coincidence.
- What do you design?

619
00:38:05,598 --> 00:38:09,591
Socks, actually. I own Shock Socks.

620
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:12,033
Oh, my God.

621
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,866
No. You're wearing my socks.

622
00:38:18,044 --> 00:38:21,536
Oh, my goodness.
That is fantastic.

623
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:25,775
So it's like a six-week
anatomy course. Yeah.

624
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:27,851
And how much
does something like that cost?

625
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,885
- I think it's like 1800.
- Oh, my God!

626
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:32,786
Well, you can't get a certificate
without it. You know?

627
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:36,257
Well, can you make $65 an hour
right away?

628
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:38,021
- I can't...
- It's sort of complicated.

629
00:38:38,197 --> 00:38:40,131
What are you doing?
It's a stitch.

630
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:41,561
- A stitch?
- Yeah.

631
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:43,895
Oh, God.

632
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:46,603
Can I work at the place
that you use to train Franny?

633
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,831
You should try
making it to the end first.

634
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:51,067
You know what?
I could clean and I could train.

635
00:38:51,243 --> 00:38:53,302
Okay, well, let's keep going, then.

636
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:56,812
- How about that?
- Fuck that. Everything hurts.

637
00:39:01,987 --> 00:39:03,386
What?

638
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:05,114
Hey! Hey!

639
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,519
Excuse me.

640
00:39:06,692 --> 00:39:08,785
Excuse me. Excuse me.

641
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:12,192
- Are you totally blind?
- What are you talking about?

642
00:39:12,364 --> 00:39:14,889
Marcus, hi. I'm Wyatt's mom.

643
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,194
- Oh, hi.
- What's going on here?

644
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:20,998
Let's see. Well,
you stole my parking place, obviously.

645
00:39:21,173 --> 00:39:22,504
And you know what?

646
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:24,905
Your son had a play date
at my house last week.

647
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:26,738
- He did?
- He did, yeah.

648
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:28,539
His nice nanny brought him over.

649
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:30,705
- Who are you?
- Wyatt's mom.

650
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:32,908
Oh, okay. Hi. Hi.

651
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,680
Hi. He had two meals,
you know, big ones...

652
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:41,384
...broke a mug and he told us that you
let him watch <i>Desperate Housewives.</i>

653
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:46,155
Yeah, thought you might
wanna know.

654
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:48,926
- Buckle up.
- And yeah, you're welcome!

655
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:51,665
- Idiot.
- What about my gum?

656
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:53,737
Not now.

657
00:39:53,906 --> 00:39:55,498
Take your time, sweetheart.

658
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:58,541
<i>So it's a six-week course...</i>

659
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:01,236
...and when it's over...
- You have to take a test.

660
00:40:01,413 --> 00:40:06,146
But when I'm done, I get a certificate
that tells me I can work in a gym.

661
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,053
How was the sex?

662
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:11,823
It was fun.

663
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,890
He doesn't look at me, though.

664
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:19,822
- Hate sex?
- No.

665
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:24,034
Anyway. So the course is $ 1800.

666
00:40:24,203 --> 00:40:26,637
And I'd pay it back
over a period of time.

667
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:29,069
That's a lot of money.

668
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:30,936
But I'd make it back.

669
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,476
Why don't you
just go back to teaching?

670
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:35,273
Teach poor kids.

671
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,472
It's not my calling.

672
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,551
Miss Franny, I'm going home now.

673
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,619
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hi, Teresa.

674
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:44,722
You know what?
I'm doing what you do now.

675
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:50,486
I'm a housekeeper.
Cleaning houses.

676
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,991
Okay, good night.

677
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,963
Bye.

678
00:40:57,136 --> 00:40:58,433
That was so stupid.

679
00:40:58,604 --> 00:41:01,869
I'm just sort of confused
because you're my only friend...

680
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:05,238
...who doesn't like to exercise,
and you're gonna be a trainer.

681
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:07,902
What? I don't understand.
What's the...? I mean...

682
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,538
Do accountants
have to love numbers?

683
00:41:11,717 --> 00:41:13,776
Do nannies have to love children?

684
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:16,920
Yeah.

685
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:19,488
Franny, if you had to work,
then what would you do?

686
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:23,355
I feel like I work. I feel like
taking care of my kids is work.

687
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:25,326
But you have full-time help.

688
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:28,957
It's true.

689
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:34,966
- Are you trying to make me feel bad?
- No.

690
00:41:35,374 --> 00:41:37,239
I don't think.

691
00:41:38,911 --> 00:41:40,435
I'm sorry.

692
00:41:45,284 --> 00:41:46,774
What about Christine?

693
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,017
I know.

694
00:41:49,188 --> 00:41:51,782
What are they doing to that house?

695
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:53,584
It's sort of sad.

696
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:55,852
Yeah, I mean...

697
00:41:56,028 --> 00:42:01,295
...they should be in couples therapy,
not expanding their home.

698
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:03,226
You know...

699
00:42:03,402 --> 00:42:06,735
...I would feel a lot better
about giving you the money...

700
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:11,467
...if you went to a therapist and
figured out what you really wanna do.

701
00:42:13,078 --> 00:42:16,241
Is that a "no" on giving me
the money for the training?

702
00:42:16,415 --> 00:42:17,643
No, I'm not saying that.

703
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:21,149
I mean, I have to talk to Matt
about it anyway.

704
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,721
Do you have to check with Matt
on lending me money for therapy?

705
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,759
- Well...
- Franny, you know...

706
00:42:27,926 --> 00:42:32,795
...you buy your 2-year-old daughter
$80 shoes from France...

707
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:34,990
...and you're giving me a hard time.

708
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:36,930
That's... That's Matt. That's not me.

709
00:42:37,703 --> 00:42:39,330
I gotta go.

710
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:41,064
You're leaving?

711
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,676
You know, you just...
You don't understand what it's like.

712
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:47,912
Before Matt, you would've lent
the money. It's not even his money.

713
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,014
- It's your money.
- Of course it's his money.

714
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:52,013
We're married.

715
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:58,183
So we thought we'd do something
tomorrow afternoon, if that's okay.

716
00:42:58,357 --> 00:43:00,291
Are you kidding?
You need friends.

717
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:03,189
Go. Is he married?

718
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:05,897
I guess so. He's got a ring.

719
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:14,062
Come here.

720
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:27,917
You're my best friend.

721
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:33,687
Hey, I'm sorry.

722
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:43,093
I don't know what's wrong with me.

723
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:46,504
- You're just tired.
- Yeah, I am.

724
00:43:46,672 --> 00:43:47,900
It's okay.

725
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:50,507
I don't feel like myself.

726
00:43:55,948 --> 00:43:58,917
I think this birthday
was hard for you.

727
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:01,249
Forty-three. What's the difference?

728
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,049
Yeah, but you're in your 40s now.
It's real.

729
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,526
It's like we're just waiting to die.

730
00:44:13,098 --> 00:44:15,191
You're serious.

731
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:20,234
That's so depressing.

732
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:25,937
Hon, your hair, your...

733
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:28,341
Does it feel greasy?

734
00:44:32,217 --> 00:44:34,742
I don't feel like washing it.

735
00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:39,053
My arms get tired.

736
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:45,196
So do you think Christine and David
are gonna split up?

737
00:44:49,468 --> 00:44:52,266
Do you remember that fight
they had at our wedding?

738
00:44:52,438 --> 00:44:53,427
No.

739
00:44:53,605 --> 00:44:57,871
They were yelling at each other
in that only downstairs bathroom.

740
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:59,670
Oh, yeah.

741
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:02,980
She was mad because he made
some crack about her dress.

742
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:05,139
Do you remember that weird dress?

743
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,110
It's like they keep
having the same argument.

744
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:11,347
And they weren't even married yet.

745
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:14,287
You think they shouldn't
have gotten married?

746
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,859
I don't know.

747
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:17,791
Maybe it was right at the time.

748
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:20,488
Yeah, but that's not enough
to get married, is it?

749
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:22,998
"Right at the time."

750
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:41,579
<i>Hello?</i>

751
00:45:42,554 --> 00:45:44,715
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

752
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,019
<i>Why do you keep calling?</i>

753
00:46:16,555 --> 00:46:18,079
Hey.

754
00:46:18,824 --> 00:46:20,382
I know you.

755
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,885
No, I don't think so.

756
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,595
Oh, look, there's Sammy's mom.

757
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:36,741
- Hi, Sammy's mom.
- Hi.

758
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:38,740
We're just bringing you
some cookies.

759
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,572
- We heard you got a new kitten.
- Yeah.

760
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:43,613
Max would love to come over
and see it soon, wouldn't you, babe?

761
00:46:43,782 --> 00:46:45,773
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Want a cookie?

762
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:47,976
No, thanks.

763
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:50,587
Marla, sorry about the construction.

764
00:46:50,756 --> 00:46:52,348
I know it's been really noisy.

765
00:46:52,724 --> 00:46:54,214
See you.

766
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:56,817
<i>You care too much</i>
<i>what people think.</i>

767
00:46:57,596 --> 00:46:59,223
But we're friends. It's...

768
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:02,196
We've had so many play dates
together. It was crazy.

769
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:04,961
So she's in a bad mood.
Who cares?

770
00:47:05,137 --> 00:47:07,230
I care.

771
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:11,206
Just because you can remove yourself
to feel superior, doesn't mean I can.

772
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:13,276
What the hell is that?

773
00:47:13,445 --> 00:47:16,437
It's what you do
so you're never affected by people.

774
00:48:01,326 --> 00:48:03,021
I can take the next customer.

775
00:48:05,597 --> 00:48:07,087
No, no, no. Wait. Excuse me.

776
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:10,000
- I was next.
- No, you weren't.

777
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:13,533
But you can't do that. Hey.

778
00:48:13,705 --> 00:48:17,505
- I was waiting in line. It's not right.
- Let me help them, then I'll help you.

779
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,440
You see that?
Were they in front of me?

780
00:48:22,147 --> 00:48:25,207
No. This is crazy.
I've been waiting in line.

781
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:27,952
How important could
being in front of me be?

782
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,588
- Calm down.
- Really. What kind of person are you?

783
00:48:30,756 --> 00:48:33,884
Feel you got away with something?
Is this really worth it to you?

784
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:36,220
Sorry, could you step over there,
wait your turn?

785
00:48:36,395 --> 00:48:39,228
- Seriously.
- Is there a manager here?

786
00:48:39,398 --> 00:48:41,696
- Is there a manager here?
- I'm the manager.

787
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,697
How can I help you?
Everything all right?

788
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:46,838
Everything's not all right.
These two people cut in front of me.

789
00:48:47,005 --> 00:48:49,030
Everyone is letting them
get away with it.

790
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:52,472
Them. There. Those two people
with their stupid fucking faces.

791
00:48:52,644 --> 00:48:55,841
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the store, ma'am.

792
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:59,646
Me, you kick out,
and to them you do nothing?

793
00:48:59,818 --> 00:49:02,218
Let's go, ma'am. I'm sorry.

794
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:03,950
Just let me buy what I need.

795
00:49:04,122 --> 00:49:05,953
I don't think that's going to happen.

796
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:08,957
Well, then take it all, then!

797
00:49:12,698 --> 00:49:15,667
On top of it, I don't get the part...

798
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:18,667
...where the guy tells the other guy
not to come to the house.

799
00:49:18,837 --> 00:49:21,032
No, no. I don't think
you're supposed to get it.

800
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:24,073
It's like... It's deliberately confusing.

801
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:25,470
Really? You sure?

802
00:49:25,644 --> 00:49:29,136
L... I don't know what I'm saying.

803
00:49:30,182 --> 00:49:31,308
Are you hungry?

804
00:49:31,483 --> 00:49:34,452
Yeah, I'm starving. Let's... Should
we go and find somewhere to eat?

805
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,315
I actually... Just earlier today
I went to a farmers' market.

806
00:49:37,489 --> 00:49:40,652
I live right up the street. So, I mean,
I could make us something.

807
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:43,727
- Oh, listen, I don't want to impose.
- No. Please, I love to cook.

808
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:45,658
I would... It would be my pleasure.

809
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:48,527
You've got such a great place.

810
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,295
Your paintings and stuff.
Did your wife decorate or did you?

811
00:49:52,471 --> 00:49:56,567
You know, my wife pretends to be
interested in that stuff, but she's not.

812
00:49:56,908 --> 00:49:59,206
I ended up doing the whole thing
myself pretty much.

813
00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:01,868
My wife's into her designing,
but I did the house.

814
00:50:02,547 --> 00:50:04,606
I think we're ready.
Do you mind grabbing that?

815
00:50:04,783 --> 00:50:07,183
- No.
- Thank you.

816
00:50:07,986 --> 00:50:10,352
So how long
have you guys been married?

817
00:50:10,522 --> 00:50:11,546
Eight and a half years.

818
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:13,054
- Really?
- Yeah.

819
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:14,783
- Us too.
- No.

820
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,791
- Yeah.
- You have kids?

821
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:19,260
No. No. You guys?

822
00:50:19,431 --> 00:50:21,865
Yeah. We have a son.

823
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,194
Was that a...?
Like a conscious decision?

824
00:50:25,904 --> 00:50:28,395
We... We tried actually, for years.

825
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:32,669
But at this point, it looks like
it's not gonna work out.

826
00:50:32,844 --> 00:50:34,675
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

827
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:37,371
It's actually been a huge strain
on our relationship.

828
00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:38,573
How so?

829
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,516
You know, just not being able
to get pregnant and...

830
00:50:42,954 --> 00:50:44,512
You know.

831
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:49,520
I'm sorry, this is weird.

832
00:50:49,694 --> 00:50:52,595
Maybe l... I mean,
maybe I'm being too intimate.

833
00:50:52,764 --> 00:50:56,791
No, no. It's okay. It's funny, I just feel...
I feel really comfortable with you, so...

834
00:50:56,968 --> 00:50:59,402
Me too. I'm glad.

835
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:03,166
Usually, when I become friends with
a guy, he thinks I'm hitting on him.

836
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:05,275
Just because you care
about what you wear...

837
00:51:05,443 --> 00:51:07,741
...doesn't meant to say you're gay.
- Exactly.

838
00:51:10,182 --> 00:51:12,582
I love your shirt, by the way.

839
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,745
<i>Her hair alone</i>
<i>should have been a sign.</i>

840
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,081
You think she just stopped bathing?

841
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,259
No, just shampooing.

842
00:51:25,897 --> 00:51:29,765
Maybe she's upset
because her husband's gay.

843
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:33,767
God, why do you always say that?
He's not gay.

844
00:51:33,939 --> 00:51:35,406
But what else could he be?

845
00:51:35,574 --> 00:51:37,371
Well, he's not. He's just Aaron.

846
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,574
Hi. I can't believe
I had my phone off.

847
00:51:41,746 --> 00:51:43,941
I was at the movies
and forgot to turn it back on.

848
00:51:44,115 --> 00:51:45,548
- She's not out yet.
- Is she okay?

849
00:51:45,717 --> 00:51:47,651
Yeah. Yeah.

850
00:51:49,054 --> 00:51:52,854
Well, you know,
she always did want a nose job.

851
00:51:53,024 --> 00:51:54,252
It's not funny.

852
00:51:54,426 --> 00:51:56,121
- Hi.
- How bad is her face?

853
00:51:56,294 --> 00:51:58,762
- My God.
- She broke her nose.

854
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,227
Was she in a lot of pain?

855
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:02,832
Actually, she couldn't stop laughing.

856
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:05,265
When she was conscious.

857
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,104
What's even weirder
is that she hates Old Navy.

858
00:52:08,273 --> 00:52:10,468
- I mean...
- I love Old Navy.

859
00:52:12,043 --> 00:52:13,635
That's good.

860
00:52:13,812 --> 00:52:15,177
So where were you?

861
00:52:15,347 --> 00:52:17,645
I was at the movies
with a friend of mine.

862
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,686
- Which friend?
- New friend. This guy I met.

863
00:52:26,191 --> 00:52:30,787
So, Olivia, are you gonna
talk to me or what?

864
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:32,190
You know...

865
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:34,832
Look, it was a really stupid idea.
Let's just forget it.

866
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,401
No, I won't. I can't believe
you won't talk to me...

867
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,333
...because I asked you
two questions.

868
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:43,235
It wasn't just about two questions,
Franny. It was your tone.

869
00:52:43,408 --> 00:52:46,434
- What happened, huh?
- She...

870
00:52:48,113 --> 00:52:51,981
She wants to be a personal trainer.

871
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:58,786
Oh, you know what?
Fuck all of you guys, all right?

872
00:52:58,957 --> 00:53:01,824
Look, I'm sorry I don't have
my entire life figured out.

873
00:53:01,993 --> 00:53:04,860
Olivia, we love you.

874
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,292
We're the ones who love you.

875
00:53:07,499 --> 00:53:09,694
It's not like we have
all our lives figured out.

876
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:12,029
Oh, that is such bullshit.

877
00:53:12,203 --> 00:53:14,194
You chose to quit your job.

878
00:53:14,372 --> 00:53:15,737
That job was intolerable.

879
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:18,007
That's still you.

880
00:53:18,176 --> 00:53:19,541
<i>Wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

881
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:22,476
<i>Wheelchair to Admitting.</i>

882
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:26,413
Well, I hope Jane will be okay
for the benefit thing.

883
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:28,211
Shit. What am I gonna wear?

884
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,349
- My God.
- I don't understand...

885
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:32,183
I don't understand
these fundraisers.

886
00:53:32,357 --> 00:53:36,623
I mean, they waste all this money
on the these parties.

887
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,389
Why don't they just give the money
to the scientists or to the sick people?

888
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:44,228
But you know what? They don't.

889
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:46,904
They throw a party
so rich people like me...

890
00:53:47,072 --> 00:53:49,632
...can spend $ 10,000 on a table...

891
00:53:49,874 --> 00:53:53,310
...and then they give it
to the sick people.

892
00:53:53,745 --> 00:53:56,373
Okay? That's how it's done.

893
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:35,082
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. It's Olivia.

894
00:54:35,253 --> 00:54:36,686
You cannot call me here.

895
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:42,054
Come on. You know. I really...
I really, really need to see you.

896
00:54:42,227 --> 00:54:44,127
<i>That's not possible.</i>

897
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:47,321
Yeah, but don't you miss me at all?

898
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:51,327
- <i>I have to hang up.</i>
- Come on. Just answer me.

899
00:54:51,503 --> 00:54:54,097
<i>I gotta go. I'll see you.</i>

900
00:55:01,713 --> 00:55:03,112
<i>Hello?</i>

901
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,918
Hi. This is Olivia.

902
00:55:08,086 --> 00:55:09,917
<i>Olivia?</i>

903
00:55:10,555 --> 00:55:12,580
<i>My husband's one-night stand?</i>

904
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:14,322
Yeah.

905
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:16,983
I guess, if you consider two months
a one-night stand.

906
00:55:17,162 --> 00:55:19,426
Could you please
put him on the phone?

907
00:55:19,597 --> 00:55:23,465
<i>Olivia, why don't you go find</i>
<i>a husband of your own.</i>

908
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:30,000
I would if I fucking could, Edie!

909
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:32,867
Fuck off!

910
00:55:33,044 --> 00:55:35,103
Hey, what about this one, honey?

911
00:55:35,313 --> 00:55:37,941
That one, Christine,
is scrawny and dead.

912
00:55:38,116 --> 00:55:39,981
I'm not spending
$ 100 on that.

913
00:55:40,151 --> 00:55:42,847
- They're all $ 100.
- It's disgusting.

914
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:45,922
Why? You'd spend it on something
else, why not a Christmas tree?

915
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:48,787
- Because we throw them away.
- That's crazy.

916
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,521
No, $ 100 on a Christmas tree,
that's what's crazy.

917
00:55:53,364 --> 00:55:54,831
What's that?

918
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:58,264
Nothing. I'm just trying to be
more like Franny. Not annoyed.

919
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:02,133
Good. So let's not get one.

920
00:56:02,307 --> 00:56:03,433
Fine.

921
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:05,803
But I want one.

922
00:56:08,012 --> 00:56:10,640
- All right.
- Sorry, honey.

923
00:56:10,815 --> 00:56:13,682
- That one's more money.
- Fuck it.

924
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:17,950
See, there are a lot of things
that are wrong and right.

925
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,819
As you get older, you try to figure out
which ones are which.

926
00:56:20,992 --> 00:56:22,357
And some are big and obvious...

927
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,360
...like don't kill anybody
or hurt anybody on purpose.

928
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:26,758
And some are trickier.

929
00:56:26,931 --> 00:56:28,762
And sometimes you do
the wrong thing...

930
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:31,197
...before you know
you're doing the wrong thing.

931
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:32,836
Want some?
These are cute.

932
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:34,665
Like what?

933
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,135
Oh, I don't know.

934
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:41,238
Okay, say you're taking a test,
and you don't know the answer.

935
00:56:41,412 --> 00:56:45,041
So you look at the guy's paper sitting
next to you, and you copy his answer.

936
00:56:45,216 --> 00:56:47,980
- That's bad, right?
- Right. You should not do that.

937
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:50,587
But while you're doing it,
you're thinking to yourself:

938
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:53,588
"Well, this doesn't hurt anybody,
what difference does it make?"

939
00:56:53,758 --> 00:56:57,125
Well, it does make a difference
because those little things add up.

940
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:59,456
So, Wyatt,
what you should understand...

941
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:02,429
There are a lot of injustices,
a lot of things aren't fair.

942
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,091
When people make it worse
by doing the wrong things...

943
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:07,204
...like taking your parking space...

944
00:57:07,372 --> 00:57:09,636
...or cutting in front of you
in line at a store...

945
00:57:09,807 --> 00:57:12,435
...and then they're just
making the world an uglier place.

946
00:57:52,717 --> 00:57:55,982
I figured out why Christine
always thinks Aaron is gay.

947
00:57:56,154 --> 00:57:59,385
Because she wants someone else to
have as bad a marriage as she does.

948
00:57:59,557 --> 00:58:03,459
And then she just gets mad
because she thinks Jane's in denial.

949
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:06,324
You know,
I have no idea what you just said.

950
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,732
Don't you think we have enough?

951
00:58:09,901 --> 00:58:11,391
A couple more.

952
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:13,127
Well, they won't know
what hit them.

953
00:58:13,304 --> 00:58:15,363
Yeah, well, isn't that the point?

954
00:58:18,977 --> 00:58:20,706
Hey, lookit.

955
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:23,645
- Lookit.
- Hey, stop... Don't go through her stuff.

956
00:58:23,815 --> 00:58:26,147
Well, she leaves it right here.

957
00:58:26,317 --> 00:58:28,945
Well, it's her house. Where else
is she supposed to put it?

958
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,556
I don't know. Hidden somewhere.
Isn't she scared you're gonna find it?

959
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:34,749
I didn't. You did.

960
00:58:34,926 --> 00:58:37,156
Did you clean those shelves?

961
00:58:37,328 --> 00:58:38,761
Yeah.

962
00:58:42,634 --> 00:58:45,034
I got you a Christmas present.

963
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:55,779
Hey.

964
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:02,312
You... You missed a spot over there.

965
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:04,045
Get it.

966
00:59:06,324 --> 00:59:07,916
Back here.

967
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,127
Yeah, back here.

968
00:59:11,596 --> 00:59:14,531
Faster. Faster.

969
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,928
- Okay, turn it off.
- What?

970
00:59:19,103 --> 00:59:21,594
Put the vacuum down.
You're done with that now.

971
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:29,903
Dust... Dust... Dust the trellis.

972
00:59:30,081 --> 00:59:34,518
And don't... Don't miss any spots.
It's delicate. It's very delicate.

973
00:59:34,686 --> 00:59:36,813
Yeah. Yeah.

974
00:59:36,988 --> 00:59:39,081
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

975
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:42,255
Yes, Mr. Mike.

976
00:59:42,427 --> 00:59:44,554
Yeah. Get the lower bits.

977
00:59:46,064 --> 00:59:48,862
- Don't be sloppy. They're delicate...
- All right, you know what?

978
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:51,058
I thought this maid's thing
was about sex.

979
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,404
- It will be.
- When?

980
01:00:10,555 --> 01:00:11,817
I'll be right back.

981
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:32,833
Well, what the fuck did you think?

982
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:36,377
That somehow we could all
just see through it?

983
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:42,682
Excuse me. You guys have to stop,
okay? You have to stop working.

984
01:00:42,854 --> 01:00:45,322
Guys, you have to stop, okay?
You have...

985
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,084
Everybody, the job's over, all right?
No more work. Please.

986
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:50,759
Go home. You guys can go...
Does anybody speak English?

987
01:00:50,928 --> 01:00:53,726
Anyone? No work. You can
all go home. You understand?

988
01:00:53,898 --> 01:00:55,991
- No work?
- No work. Exactly. No work.

989
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:59,603
- You can all go home, okay? <i>Adiós.</i>
- Go home?

990
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:02,205
Hey, hey.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

991
01:01:02,373 --> 01:01:05,831
We have completely ruined our street.
Do you know what we've done?

992
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,671
Guys, go back to work, please.

993
01:01:07,845 --> 01:01:11,474
- Yes.
- No. No, you have to stop. Please.

994
01:01:12,049 --> 01:01:15,041
No, David. Listen.
I just came from Marla's house.

995
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:17,619
We've completely ruined her view
and everybody else's.

996
01:01:17,789 --> 01:01:20,815
Our house is so fucking huge
no one can see the sky anymore.

997
01:01:20,992 --> 01:01:23,051
Are you serious?
You didn't know? Right.

998
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:25,923
Know what? That we were doing
something really, really gross?

999
01:01:26,097 --> 01:01:27,792
- No, I didn't.
- What planet are you on?

1000
01:01:27,965 --> 01:01:29,956
Everybody in the neighborhood
is doing this.

1001
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:33,535
Marla's trying to make you feel guilty.
You're the one that wanted the view.

1002
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:37,731
How the fuck else would you see
the ocean from the bedroom?

1003
01:01:57,395 --> 01:01:59,761
<i>Hi, Christine.</i>
<i>This is Melanie Charney.</i>

1004
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:01,455
<i>You know that maid</i>
<i>you recommended?</i>

1005
01:02:01,632 --> 01:02:04,897
<i>I'm sure this isn't the case, I wanted</i>
<i>to know how well you know her...</i>

1006
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:06,969
<i>... because, I don't know,</i>
<i>this is silly...</i>

1007
01:02:07,138 --> 01:02:09,698
<i>... but I'm missing</i>
<i>a $75 jar of face cream.</i>

1008
01:02:09,874 --> 01:02:11,671
<i>And I just can't imagine</i>
<i>where it went.</i>

1009
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:15,008
<i>I mean, what kind of person</i>
<i>would steal someone's face cream?</i>

1010
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:17,374
<i>Will you give me a call</i>
<i>when you can?</i>

1011
01:02:18,182 --> 01:02:21,618
We're more than halfway through.
We're not stopping now.

1012
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:23,720
- You don't care about others.
- You knew.

1013
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:26,053
You just didn't want
to pay attention.

1014
01:02:26,224 --> 01:02:29,193
- I didn't know!
- You notice what you want.

1015
01:02:29,927 --> 01:02:32,020
Shit!

1016
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:34,889
I'm going out for a while.

1017
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,729
"You all right?
Did you burn yourself?"

1018
01:02:37,902 --> 01:02:39,426
What are you talking about?

1019
01:02:39,604 --> 01:02:42,232
Nothing. I just burned
the fuck out of my hand...

1020
01:02:42,406 --> 01:02:44,806
...and I politely asked myself
if I was all right.

1021
01:02:44,976 --> 01:02:47,137
It's something you seem
to be incapable of doing.

1022
01:02:47,645 --> 01:02:50,205
- What?
- I just burned my hand.

1023
01:02:50,381 --> 01:02:53,544
- Did you notice?
- I don't... I don't know. Yes, I guess so.

1024
01:02:53,718 --> 01:02:56,118
Does it ever occur to you to say,
"Are you all right?"

1025
01:02:56,287 --> 01:02:59,984
- You are all right.
- But does it ever occur to you to ask?

1026
01:03:00,157 --> 01:03:02,148
If you're all right,
which you clearly are...

1027
01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:04,487
...then what the fuck
is the difference?

1028
01:03:04,662 --> 01:03:07,460
If you want me to know you're all right,
why don't you tell me?

1029
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:15,232
Okay. So say I scrape
the fuck out of my arm.

1030
01:03:15,406 --> 01:03:17,897
And I yell:

1031
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:22,974
And you don't say anything.

1032
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:26,344
I should say,
"Don't worry, honey, I'm all right."

1033
01:03:26,517 --> 01:03:29,213
Yes. What's wrong with that?

1034
01:03:45,503 --> 01:03:49,496
So I'll speak to you soon.
I had a good time.

1035
01:03:51,142 --> 01:03:53,337
I thought we were gonna go
to dinner or something.

1036
01:03:54,312 --> 01:03:55,870
I can't. I can't. I wish I could.

1037
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:00,139
I already have a plan for dinner.
I'm sorry.

1038
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:05,379
Thanks for my present.

1039
01:04:06,557 --> 01:04:09,856
We... We almost forgot.

1040
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:13,396
My cut.

1041
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:20,196
You really want this money?

1042
01:04:20,738 --> 01:04:22,569
I helped.

1043
01:04:24,508 --> 01:04:26,442
You're a fuck.

1044
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,780
You just will. People do.

1045
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:50,460
But how? I can't even imagine.

1046
01:05:50,995 --> 01:05:53,327
Does one of us move out?

1047
01:05:54,265 --> 01:05:56,665
- Him or me?
- Him.

1048
01:06:04,108 --> 01:06:07,669
I can't believe I'm talking about this.

1049
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:16,151
I'm sorry, Aaron,
you can have your wife back.

1050
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,948
I just... I should go anyway.

1051
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:27,361
Just take your time.

1052
01:06:40,144 --> 01:06:42,442
Hi, my name is Olivia...

1053
01:06:42,613 --> 01:06:46,447
...and I am the lady
that cleans your house.

1054
01:06:46,617 --> 01:06:47,845
And I'm calling to say...

1055
01:06:48,018 --> 01:06:51,146
...that I'm not going to be able
to come to work anymore.

1056
01:06:51,322 --> 01:06:53,381
Actually, I got another job.

1057
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:55,684
I'm... So I'm very sorry.

1058
01:07:07,004 --> 01:07:09,165
<i>Hey, it's Marty.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

1059
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,568
<i>All right.</i>

1060
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:13,574
Hi, this is Olivia.
I'm the lady that cleans your house...

1061
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:16,406
...and I'm calling to say
that I'm not gonna be able to...

1062
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,070
<i>Hey.</i>

1063
01:07:18,649 --> 01:07:21,083
Oh, hi. You're there.

1064
01:07:21,252 --> 01:07:23,413
- Yeah.
- <i>I'm calling to tell you...</i>

1065
01:07:23,587 --> 01:07:28,081
<i>... that I'm not gonna be able</i>
<i>to do it anymore.</i>

1066
01:07:28,259 --> 01:07:29,556
Well, how come?

1067
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:32,588
Be... Well...

1068
01:07:32,763 --> 01:07:34,663
Because I just...

1069
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:38,064
- Well, actually, I got a job.
- What is it?

1070
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:41,833
In cosmetics.

1071
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:46,408
Yeah.

1072
01:07:50,948 --> 01:07:52,506
Hey, what do you do?

1073
01:07:54,118 --> 01:07:58,953
I am presently not employed
at the moment.

1074
01:07:59,123 --> 01:08:00,556
Well, what did you do?

1075
01:08:00,724 --> 01:08:03,420
<i>A little bit of everything.</i>
<i>A lot of nothing.</i>

1076
01:08:11,669 --> 01:08:13,432
Do you wanna go out sometime?

1077
01:08:17,374 --> 01:08:18,602
Sure.

1078
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,009
Good.

1079
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:30,582
- Pretty good, huh?
- That's very nice.

1080
01:08:33,757 --> 01:08:35,190
- Very pretty.
- God.

1081
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,418
Is this too dressy
for homeless people?

1082
01:08:37,595 --> 01:08:39,153
ALS, ALS.

1083
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:41,696
Why do I keep forgetting that?

1084
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,598
Oh, wow, this is soft.

1085
01:08:45,769 --> 01:08:47,703
When did you start working
with this fabric?

1086
01:08:47,872 --> 01:08:49,806
- It gets little holes in it, though.
- Really?

1087
01:08:50,174 --> 01:08:52,233
I'm kind of afraid to move.

1088
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:54,377
It looks cuter
when it gets little holes.

1089
01:08:54,545 --> 01:08:57,343
Jesus, not when you're paying
800 bucks for it.

1090
01:08:57,514 --> 01:08:58,879
Well, you're not paying for it.

1091
01:08:59,049 --> 01:09:00,983
- I didn't mean anything by that.
- It's okay.

1092
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:03,210
I know it's overpriced,
but it has to be.

1093
01:09:03,387 --> 01:09:05,355
- I'm paying for mine.
- Shut up.

1094
01:09:05,522 --> 01:09:06,784
- I will.
- Just shut up.

1095
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:10,154
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's a gift.

1096
01:09:11,061 --> 01:09:13,461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1097
01:09:13,631 --> 01:09:15,189
- All right.
- Thank you.

1098
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,501
I don't know about that.

1099
01:09:24,808 --> 01:09:25,832
- I know.
- This?

1100
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,341
Take it off.

1101
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:28,876
Take it off, take it off.

1102
01:09:29,046 --> 01:09:31,344
Oh, thank you so much.
L... It's just a little runny.

1103
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:32,880
Oh, sorry. I'll make it again.

1104
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:35,985
You should not apologize.
He should be apologizing.

1105
01:09:36,153 --> 01:09:38,178
You should've order them
over-medium, honey.

1106
01:09:38,355 --> 01:09:40,380
No, then they come back dry.

1107
01:09:40,557 --> 01:09:42,684
Always. Especially here.

1108
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,521
Oh, we've never been here actually.

1109
01:09:44,695 --> 01:09:46,356
- Who picked it?
- I did.

1110
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,293
I really like it, I really like it.

1111
01:09:48,465 --> 01:09:50,399
- So do I. There's such...
- What do you do?

1112
01:09:50,567 --> 01:09:52,762
- Oh, we run the company together.
- Yeah, yeah.

1113
01:09:52,937 --> 01:09:55,428
Aaron's the artist,
and I'm pretty much the bookkeeper.

1114
01:09:55,606 --> 01:09:58,234
- No.
- I always give socks as presents.

1115
01:09:58,409 --> 01:09:59,637
- Really?
- I have for years.

1116
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:03,075
So did we, but you can only give
your wares away for so long...

1117
01:10:03,247 --> 01:10:05,511
...and then you actually
have to buy something.

1118
01:10:06,016 --> 01:10:08,177
Didn't I ask for coffee an hour ago?
Excuse me.

1119
01:10:08,352 --> 01:10:11,549
Could I have some more co...?
Fell off the face of the fucking earth.

1120
01:10:11,722 --> 01:10:15,158
What do you have to do...? They have
one job and they can't do that right.

1121
01:10:15,326 --> 01:10:17,351
- Jane. Please.
- What? What?

1122
01:10:17,528 --> 01:10:19,086
Will you not have one of your fits.

1123
01:10:19,263 --> 01:10:22,926
I mean, we're having
a really lovely time. Okay?

1124
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:30,263
He's gay.

1125
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:32,636
He's not gay.

1126
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,277
- Oh, okay.
- You just met his wife.

1127
01:10:34,445 --> 01:10:36,072
Who has a serious bug up her ass...

1128
01:10:36,246 --> 01:10:38,407
...and has a reason.
- She does.

1129
01:10:38,582 --> 01:10:40,174
What does she have
to complain about?

1130
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:43,377
Do you know how much her clothes
cost? They're hideously overpriced.

1131
01:10:43,554 --> 01:10:46,182
- Sweetheart, you buy them.
- Oh, they're gorgeous.

1132
01:10:46,357 --> 01:10:48,188
Who cares if you don't get
another coffee?

1133
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:50,520
Was it worth making us look
like crazy people...

1134
01:10:50,694 --> 01:10:53,185
...in front of our new friends?

1135
01:10:53,464 --> 01:10:55,125
Just tell me.

1136
01:10:56,233 --> 01:11:00,533
What horrible injustice was done
to you that you have to act this way?

1137
01:11:00,704 --> 01:11:02,171
What is it that you don't have...

1138
01:11:02,339 --> 01:11:06,298
...that you have to walk straight
into a plate-glass window?

1139
01:11:06,677 --> 01:11:09,703
Or that you can't get up the incentive
to wash your fucking hair.

1140
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,440
- I wash my hair.
- Yeah, when?

1141
01:11:12,883 --> 01:11:14,680
Have you seen it recently?

1142
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:18,117
Just tell me, are you intending
to go to the benefit looking like that?

1143
01:11:18,288 --> 01:11:21,314
What's the point? It gets dirty
and you have to wash it all again.

1144
01:11:21,492 --> 01:11:24,586
That's what civilized people do.
They get up and they wash their hair.

1145
01:11:24,762 --> 01:11:26,821
And when it gets dirty,
they wash it again.

1146
01:11:26,997 --> 01:11:30,990
- Well, I don't want to.
- Jesus. Is this your idea of rebelling...

1147
01:11:31,168 --> 01:11:33,432
...against the way things are?
- I'm not rebelling.

1148
01:11:33,604 --> 01:11:36,198
- What are you doing?
- I'm just tired.

1149
01:11:37,975 --> 01:11:39,670
Of what?

1150
01:11:41,111 --> 01:11:45,514
I just guess I feel like there's no more
wondering what it's gonna be like.

1151
01:11:45,682 --> 01:11:48,173
Like what's gonna be like?

1152
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,614
My fabulous life.

1153
01:11:57,261 --> 01:11:59,593
You don't like your life?

1154
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:05,100
No, I do. I like my life.

1155
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:09,169
Good.

1156
01:12:12,242 --> 01:12:13,573
I hate black tie.

1157
01:12:13,944 --> 01:12:17,141
You know,
Olivia's bringing some guy again.

1158
01:12:17,948 --> 01:12:19,745
We're buying some guy
a $ 1000 dinner?

1159
01:12:19,917 --> 01:12:21,817
I know. At first,
I was kind of annoyed.

1160
01:12:21,985 --> 01:12:25,352
But then I just feel so bad
that I introduced her to Mike.

1161
01:12:25,522 --> 01:12:26,784
I mean...

1162
01:12:26,957 --> 01:12:29,949
I had no idea he'd be such a dick.

1163
01:12:30,127 --> 01:12:32,118
And then she knew
David wasn't coming...

1164
01:12:32,296 --> 01:12:34,526
...and there's an extra seat,
so you know.

1165
01:12:34,798 --> 01:12:36,356
Still have to talk to him.

1166
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:38,967
<i>Well, just sit</i>
<i>at the other side of the table.</i>

1167
01:12:39,136 --> 01:12:41,161
<i>It's for a good cause.</i>

1168
01:12:41,371 --> 01:12:44,135
<i>What? ALS or Olivia?</i>

1169
01:12:46,844 --> 01:12:48,835
Wow, you look amazing.

1170
01:12:49,012 --> 01:12:50,946
Thank you.

1171
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:54,277
<i>Maybe this guy will be the right one.</i>

1172
01:12:54,451 --> 01:12:55,645
<i>It only takes one.</i>

1173
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,349
Do I have a smudge?

1174
01:12:58,522 --> 01:12:59,784
No.

1175
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:02,926
It's just, I think
you might be a little casual.

1176
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:04,355
Do you have a tie?

1177
01:13:04,528 --> 01:13:05,995
L... Oh...

1178
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,233
<i>So, what's he like?</i>

1179
01:13:11,468 --> 01:13:13,459
<i>He sounded kind of nice.</i>

1180
01:13:13,637 --> 01:13:16,868
<i>More like her</i>
<i>than her other boyfriends.</i>

1181
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,941
Isn't it weird how they throw
these fancy parties for money?

1182
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:22,806
Why don't they give the money
to the sick people directly?

1183
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:26,108
It seems like such a waste, right?

1184
01:13:26,283 --> 01:13:27,910
Anyway...

1185
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:33,517
You know, I don't think
the two of you have much in common.

1186
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:37,488
I know. I sometimes wonder
if we met now...

1187
01:13:37,661 --> 01:13:39,356
...if we'd be friends.

1188
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:41,498
Not likely.

1189
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:44,294
Probably not.

1190
01:13:48,338 --> 01:13:49,965
That's good.

1191
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,074
- That's so true.
- Yeah.

1192
01:13:52,242 --> 01:13:54,403
That is so true.

1193
01:13:54,978 --> 01:13:56,673
You're funny.

1194
01:13:56,847 --> 01:13:58,109
- <i>Max?</i>
- <i>Yes?</i>

1195
01:13:58,282 --> 01:13:59,909
<i>Do you like these shoes?</i>

1196
01:14:01,285 --> 01:14:02,547
Or are they too clunky?

1197
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,280
- What's "clunky" mean?
- It means, you know, heavy.

1198
01:14:06,456 --> 01:14:08,947
Not delicate. Like chunky.

1199
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:17,295
You're not gonna give me
any help, are you?

1200
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:19,496
Good boy.

1201
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:24,135
When we met, I had like
400 different kinds, remember?

1202
01:14:24,308 --> 01:14:25,798
Yeah, I do.

1203
01:14:25,976 --> 01:14:28,536
I was obsessed with shampoo.

1204
01:14:28,712 --> 01:14:30,942
I thought if I could find
the right one...

1205
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:33,674
...my hair would be
the hair I always wanted.

1206
01:14:33,951 --> 01:14:36,215
Like, every time I washed
it was a new opportunity.

1207
01:14:36,386 --> 01:14:39,446
A new chance to be pretty.

1208
01:14:40,023 --> 01:14:42,150
Just right.

1209
01:14:44,261 --> 01:14:45,489
Then I married you...

1210
01:14:45,662 --> 01:14:48,096
...and I found out they all have
the same shit in them.

1211
01:14:55,706 --> 01:14:56,968
<i>You guys...</i>

1212
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:58,539
<i>... I love this stuff.</i>

1213
01:14:58,709 --> 01:15:00,574
This is amazing.

1214
01:15:00,744 --> 01:15:04,009
Lookit, this is expensive stuff.

1215
01:15:04,481 --> 01:15:07,041
Oh, my God,
would you smell that candle.

1216
01:15:08,085 --> 01:15:09,109
- Vomit.
- What?

1217
01:15:09,286 --> 01:15:10,844
- Here.
- Oh, please. You serious?

1218
01:15:11,021 --> 01:15:12,921
- Yeah.
- You know what?

1219
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,614
Give her the whole thing.

1220
01:15:15,058 --> 01:15:17,390
Thank you. Oh, my God.

1221
01:15:17,561 --> 01:15:19,495
Listen, I'm keeping mine.

1222
01:15:20,697 --> 01:15:22,722
It's what you put in this bag anyway.

1223
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:26,699
If you want to, you could
just donate that directly to ALS.

1224
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,064
Oh, fuck you.

1225
01:15:31,742 --> 01:15:33,903
- How is Max?
- He's okay.

1226
01:15:34,077 --> 01:15:36,375
He's gonna go to a shrink.
I think it'll help him.

1227
01:15:36,546 --> 01:15:38,673
- Yeah, that's good.
- In case you're wondering...

1228
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:42,182
...my husband and I just split.
- I know, Olivia told me everything.

1229
01:15:44,488 --> 01:15:46,388
Sorry. I'm divorced too.

1230
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:49,415
It's really hard at first.

1231
01:15:49,593 --> 01:15:51,026
Marty has a daughter.

1232
01:15:51,194 --> 01:15:53,924
And I actually saw a picture of her.
She's so cute.

1233
01:15:54,097 --> 01:15:55,826
- She's 10. She's beautiful.
- Really?

1234
01:15:55,999 --> 01:15:57,660
- What's her name?
- Ivy.

1235
01:15:57,834 --> 01:15:59,859
Ivy. I love that name.

1236
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:03,769
So, Marty, what do you...?
What do you do?

1237
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,237
I mean, for a living?

1238
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:09,140
I dabble in some stuff...

1239
01:16:09,313 --> 01:16:10,712
...and...

1240
01:16:10,881 --> 01:16:13,406
...opportunities, investments.

1241
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:16,017
I get stuff done.

1242
01:16:19,056 --> 01:16:23,186
- There's so much stuff in this auction.
- Yeah, there are.

1243
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,419
Reese Witherspoon
will knit me a sweater.

1244
01:16:25,796 --> 01:16:27,559
- Sweetheart, look at this.
- So weird.

1245
01:16:27,731 --> 01:16:29,756
Tandem bike.
We could get that and ride that.

1246
01:16:29,933 --> 01:16:31,298
How long would that take?

1247
01:16:31,468 --> 01:16:33,698
Does anyone know
what a Donzi boat is?

1248
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:35,269
- I don't.
- Oh, my God.

1249
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:38,203
Who would pay to walk on
<i>Nip/Tuck?</i>

1250
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:40,275
Oh, God, I would.

1251
01:16:40,444 --> 01:16:42,036
I'd be there in a shot.

1252
01:16:42,212 --> 01:16:43,804
That surprises me.

1253
01:16:44,581 --> 01:16:46,173
Why?

1254
01:16:47,217 --> 01:16:49,481
Is this pretty fucking small
for 1000 bucks.

1255
01:16:49,653 --> 01:16:52,417
Jane, please.

1256
01:16:52,789 --> 01:16:55,622
Before we start eating
our really small food...

1257
01:16:55,792 --> 01:16:57,089
...I wanna make a toast...

1258
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,696
...to the fact that, you know,
we don't have ALS...

1259
01:17:00,864 --> 01:17:03,264
...or anything horrible.

1260
01:17:05,001 --> 01:17:07,094
- Yet.
- Jesus, Matt.

1261
01:17:07,270 --> 01:17:08,498
No, no, no, it's true.

1262
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:10,401
This is when starts. This is the age.

1263
01:17:10,574 --> 01:17:13,634
No shit, man. I just found out
I have 15 percent bone loss.

1264
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,300
- Which bone?
- What is bone loss?

1265
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:16,776
It's absolutely normal.

1266
01:17:16,947 --> 01:17:19,313
It's like kind of before osteoporosis
sets in.

1267
01:17:19,483 --> 01:17:24,113
Welcome and thank you all for being
part of this very important evening.

1268
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:28,656
Project ALS is driving
scientific research forward.

1269
01:17:28,825 --> 01:17:33,592
And tonight, we are paying tribute
to the individuals...

1270
01:17:46,176 --> 01:17:48,610
You were the prettiest one there.

1271
01:17:54,451 --> 01:17:56,544
<i>He was actually really nice.</i>

1272
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,312
And did you see his jacket?
It was...

1273
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:00,479
It was really quite beautiful.

1274
01:18:00,657 --> 01:18:02,420
- Whose?
- Olivia's boyfriend.

1275
01:18:02,592 --> 01:18:04,526
The fabric, it was quite gorgeous.

1276
01:18:04,694 --> 01:18:05,922
Oh, I don't think so.

1277
01:18:06,096 --> 01:18:07,563
And I know fabric.

1278
01:18:07,731 --> 01:18:09,528
No, no. I felt it on the way out.

1279
01:18:09,699 --> 01:18:13,066
It was cashmere.

1280
01:18:13,937 --> 01:18:15,165
Pretty expensive.

1281
01:18:15,338 --> 01:18:17,238
He does seem nice, you know?

1282
01:18:17,407 --> 01:18:20,535
And she looked sort of happy.

1283
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:25,472
And the girls just looked great
in your clothes.

1284
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:33,081
You were the prettiest one there.

1285
01:18:48,438 --> 01:18:49,666
- Hi.
- Hi.

1286
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,102
Did he go to sleep okay?

1287
01:18:51,274 --> 01:18:53,401
- Yeah, it was fine.
- Good.

1288
01:18:56,112 --> 01:18:57,443
Thanks. Good night.

1289
01:18:57,614 --> 01:18:59,343
Good night.

1290
01:19:01,852 --> 01:19:05,083
I know they're a really depressed
group of people.

1291
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:09,089
No. That's probably why I was
so comfortable around them.

1292
01:19:09,259 --> 01:19:10,556
Really? You liked them?

1293
01:19:10,727 --> 01:19:12,285
Yeah.

1294
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,419
I'm sorry about Matt.

1295
01:19:14,598 --> 01:19:19,001
God, he asked all those questions
about, you know, your work.

1296
01:19:26,776 --> 01:19:30,940
I don't usually tell people this...

1297
01:19:31,515 --> 01:19:34,279
...unless I've known them
for a long time...

1298
01:19:35,418 --> 01:19:37,010
...but I don't work.

1299
01:19:37,187 --> 01:19:39,849
Yeah. I don't blame you.

1300
01:19:40,023 --> 01:19:43,515
I mean, if I could figure out a way
not to do it, I wouldn't either.

1301
01:19:43,693 --> 01:19:45,593
I mean, right?

1302
01:19:46,263 --> 01:19:48,026
No, I mean...

1303
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:52,225
...l'm really rich.

1304
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:58,298
Yeah, you wish.

1305
01:19:58,475 --> 01:19:59,840
No, I mean it.

1306
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:03,468
My family, my father actually...

1307
01:20:03,747 --> 01:20:08,241
...was incredibly wealthy,
and I inherited all his money.

1308
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,212
I don't need to work.

1309
01:20:13,924 --> 01:20:15,755
So I don't.

1310
01:20:19,563 --> 01:20:23,055
Well, that's... I mean, that's great.

1311
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,165
Good for you.

1312
01:20:37,647 --> 01:20:39,774
I just can't take the in-laws
anymore, Richard.

1313
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:42,077
They're wearing down my nerves.

1314
01:20:42,252 --> 01:20:44,379
Well, what do you think
it's like for me?

1315
01:20:44,554 --> 01:20:47,785
Your sister
with those spaghetti dishes.

1316
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:50,085
I thought you liked
the way my sister cooked.

1317
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,750
She...

1318
01:21:06,943 --> 01:21:10,140
You okay, Miss Christine?

1319
01:21:28,965 --> 01:21:33,061
So I was thinking, like,
a nice armoire over there.

1320
01:21:33,236 --> 01:21:34,669
- Oh, yeah.
- You know?

1321
01:21:34,838 --> 01:21:36,465
I like those.

1322
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,767
And maybe some new curtains.

1323
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,805
I always...
I always wanted to get this...

1324
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:45,880
...but I just don't know where to go.
- Oh, I know where to go.

1325
01:21:46,049 --> 01:21:47,277
- Really?
- Yeah.

1326
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,384
- So you'll help me?
- Oh, yeah.

1327
01:21:49,886 --> 01:21:52,753
- That would be great.
- Yeah. No, there's...

1328
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:03,922
Hey, can l...?
Can I ask you something?

1329
01:22:09,172 --> 01:22:11,163
You know,
remember when we first met?

1330
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:14,799
And you bargained down my price?

1331
01:22:15,812 --> 01:22:17,404
Yeah?

1332
01:22:17,747 --> 01:22:19,738
Why would you do that?

1333
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:22,478
I mean, when you have
a lot of money.

1334
01:22:24,554 --> 01:22:26,044
I'm sorry.

1335
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,980
That's...

1336
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:31,150
I just...

1337
01:22:32,262 --> 01:22:36,824
l... I guess I have some issues.

1338
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:39,430
You do?

1339
01:22:41,471 --> 01:22:47,103
L... You know,
people sort of problems.

1340
01:22:48,211 --> 01:22:50,008
I have them.

1341
01:22:55,852 --> 01:22:57,717
