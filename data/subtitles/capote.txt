1
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,131
Hello?

2
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,511
Nancy?

3
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,107
Exactly.

4
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,860
But at least be honest about the facts.

5
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,112
- That's what I'm saying.
- Who's honest?

6
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,613
I'm honest.

7
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,699
I am honest about what I write about.

8
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,286
I'll let you know if it's autobiographical'
or if it's about me' or if it's not.

9
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:28,040
And I find autobiographical stories
at this juncture of my life to be quite boring.

10
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,047
...say I'm one thing'
but actually you're another thing.

11
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,049
I think being true to who you are
is important.

12
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,136
I'm not saying you need to be
psychoanalytical about the whole mess.

13
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,388
- But don't be afraid.
- Yeah' I... But don't be afraid.

14
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,725
I had lunch with Jimmy Baldwin
the other day.

15
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,436
- How is he?
- He's a lovely man.

16
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,647
And he told me the plot of his new book.

17
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,903
And he said to me' "But I just want to make
sure it's not one of those problem novels."

18
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,321
And I said' "Jimmy,

19
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:02,408
"your novel's about a Negro homosexual
who's in love with a Jew.

20
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,078
"Wouldn't you call that a problem?"

21
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,834
And he looked at me and he laughed
because he knew I was right.

22
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,587
I'm saying, you know,
if you're gonna write something like that

23
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,923
at least be honest why you're writing it.

24
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,674
Can't we just be honest?

25
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,427
Well, I don't think
you actually need to be honest.

26
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,597
But don't come asking
some white man from the South

27
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,934
whether your book
about a black man fucking some Jew,

28
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,852
when they're both of the same sex,

29
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,187
is an issue!

30
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,688
Don't ask me that!

31
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,190
Oh, no, it's not an issue, Jimmy.

32
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,360
Everyone's gonna be quite pleased
with that topic.

33
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,612
So how about you, Truman?
Do you admit it?

34
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,198
Well, I'm not nearly that controversial.

35
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,785
I'm not! I'm not! I am not.

36
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,037
I'm not nearly that controversial.

37
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,538
Oh, come on.

38
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,968
Hi. It's Truman for William Shawn, please.

39
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,598
Have you read the article
about the killings in Kansas

40
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,184
in the front section of The New York Times?

41
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,104
I think that's what I want to write about.

42
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,319
I want to go tonight.

43
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,841
- I figured you'd missed it.
- I'm sorry.

44
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,470
That's all right. I thought
I was heading to Kansas by myself.

45
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,557
God, I'm glad you agreed to come.

46
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,060
You're the only one I know
with the qualifications

47
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,104
to be both a research assistant
and a personal bodyguard.

48
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,522
Thank you.

49
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,733
Now I'm nervous.

50
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,942
Yes?

51
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,237
Mr. Truman Capote
and Miss Nelle Harper Lee?

52
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,073
- That's us.
- Where would you like these, sir?

53
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,867
You can put that right there
between the doors.

54
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,285
What all did you bring?

55
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,828
Just a few things.

56
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,374
- Thank you greatly, sir.
- Thank you.

57
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,793
You're welcome.

58
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,213
It's an honor to have you with us, sir,

59
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,757
and I hope you won't mind me saying,

60
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,426
but I thought your last book
was even better than the first.

61
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,677
Thank you.

62
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,306
I mean, just when you think
they've gotten as good as they can get.

63
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,725
- Thank you very much.
- Ma'am.

64
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,734
You're pathetic.

65
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,154
- What?
- You paid him to say that.

66
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,075
You paid him to say that.

67
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,330
How did you know?

68
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,707
"Just when you think
they've gotten as good as they can get?"

69
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,876
I thought that was a good line.

70
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,548
- Do you think that was too much?
- Yeah, a bit.

71
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,432
Your keys.

72
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,601
- Sign here, please.
- Thank you.

73
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,740
Alvin Dewey,

74
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,744
Kansas Bureau of Investigation.

75
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,668
KBI.

76
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,009
Hi. I'm looking for Alvin Dewey.

77
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,142
Hi.

78
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,605
Mr. Dewey.
Truman Capote, from The New Yorker.

79
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,985
- Bergdorf's.
- Sorry?

80
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,862
- The scarf.
- Oh.

81
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,947
- Nice.
- Thank you.

82
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,785
Mr. Dewey, I wonder when we could
arrange an interview, some time to talk.

83
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,123
About what?

84
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,418
Well, we're not looking
for any inside information.

85
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,963
You know, I don't care one way or another
if you catch whoever did this.

86
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:12,176
I'm writing an article on how
the Clutter killings are affecting the town.

87
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,887
You know, how you all are bearing up.

88
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,389
I care.

89
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,728
- Excuse me?
- I care.

90
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,981
I care a great deal
if we catch whoever did this.

91
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,192
Oh, I see.

92
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,487
- As do a lot of folks around here.
- Oh, of course.

93
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,197
Do you have press credentials?

94
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,698
- What's a New Yorker?
- Magazine.

95
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,866
Magazines don't give out...

96
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,869
You can come to the news conference
with the rest of them.

97
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,496
Sears, Roebuck.

98
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,666
The boy was 16?

99
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,833
He was 15.

100
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,502
Nancy was 16.

101
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,754
And it's her friend that found them?

102
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,215
- Laura Kinney.
- Can you spell that?

103
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,803
I assume you're okay with the Laura part.

104
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,180
K-l-N-N-E-Y.

105
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,267
But, please, leave her be.

106
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:05,521
There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans.
A whole bunch of Mexicans.

107
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,191
Hello, George.

108
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,902
It's good to see you again.

109
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,323
I do have an opinion
whether this was the work of one man

110
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,034
or "a whole bunch," as you said,

111
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,704
but it doesn't matter a whole lot

112
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:26,375
whether it was Mexicans
or Methodists or Eskimos.

113
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,753
We're gonna find whoever did this.

114
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,756
Now, four good people
from our community are dead.

115
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,633
So let's remember that.

116
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,928
The West Kansas Farm Committee

117
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,597
is offering a $1,000 reward

118
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,517
for information leading to an arrest.

119
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,269
Please print that.

120
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,648
And thank you all for coming.

121
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,120
He was foxy with that old man.

122
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,299
This make you miss Alabama?

123
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,843
Not even a little bit.

124
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,347
- You lie.
- I don't lie.

125
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,463
- Good morning.
- Hi.

126
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,842
Can any of you tell me
where I'd find Laura Kinney?

127
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,434
Is that her? With the boy?

128
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,603
Yeah, with Danny Burke.

129
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,813
Danny Burke?

130
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,064
Laura?

131
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,738
Thank you.

132
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,784
Truman.

133
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,914
I'm gonna find out where that girl lives.

134
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,250
Can I do that alone?

135
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,962
All right?

136
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,256
Okay.

137
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,020
I think I scared a friend of yours
this morning.

138
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,523
She came looking for you
when I was writing.

139
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,317
- You hate my friends.
- No, I wouldn't say "hate."

140
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,237
Just as long as they don't
knock on my door.

141
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,242
I saw the bodies today.

142
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,703
- Which?
- The Clutters.

143
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,168
I looked inside the coffins.

144
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,421
That's horritying.

145
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,424
It comforts me.

146
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,762
Something so horrifying...

147
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,474
It's a relief.

148
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,812
Normal life falls away.

149
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,066
But then, I was never much for normal life.

150
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,151
No.

151
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,779
Yeah, people here won't talk to me.

152
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,659
They want someone like you, like Nelle.

153
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,327
Me, they hate.

154
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,247
I can't think of a single quality
I share with Nelle.

155
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,291
- Well...
- Maybe manliness.

156
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,922
- Good morning, Henry.
- Good morning, sir.

157
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,593
Let's go.

158
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,386
Bye.

159
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,646
Hi, Danny. I'm Harper Lee.

160
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,325
Nancy was your best friend?

161
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,495
Yeah, she was my best friend.

162
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,498
How has Danny been?

163
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,418
Pretty shattered.

164
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,047
Nothing terrible
has ever happened to him before.

165
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,300
Danny was the last one at the house
that night.

166
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,386
That's why Mr. Dewey
keeps interviewing him.

167
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,972
They don't think
that he had anything to do with it.

168
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,225
It's just to see
if he remembers anything unusual.

169
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,896
People in town do seem to wonder
if he was involved.

170
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,859
Yeah. That's been really hard for Danny.

171
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,738
Oh, it's the hardest
when someone has a notion about you

172
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,741
and it's impossible
to convince them otherwise.

173
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,037
Ever since I was a child,
folks have thought they had me pegged

174
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,706
because of the way I...

175
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,917
The way I am.

176
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,753
You know, the way I talk.

177
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,214
And they're always wrong.

178
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,926
You know what I mean?

179
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:54,888
Yeah.

180
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,435
I wanna show you something.

181
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,995
Maybe this will give you a better picture
of what happened.

182
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,790
- What is this?
- It's your diary.

183
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,127
"Danny here tonight and we watched TV.

184
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,296
"So nice just having him sit with us.

185
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,257
"Left at 11:00.

186
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,970
"P.S. He's the only one I really love."

187
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,433
And that was that.

188
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,527
Did Laura say "shattered"?

189
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,323
"Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible
has ever happened to him before."

190
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,996
You know I have 94% recall
of all conversations?

191
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,330
94%?

192
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,166
I've tested myself.

193
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,676
Well...

194
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,554
how did that happen?

195
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,725
Apparently Detective Foxy's wife
has read fiction.

196
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,227
That's great.

197
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,854
We're in.

198
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,398
- We are in.
- In.

199
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,541
- You came.
- Hi.

200
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,169
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

201
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,380
Get yourselves in here.

202
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,217
Alvin, get your pants on. They're here.

203
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,427
- Hey, little Deweys.
- Hi.

204
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,595
Hi.

205
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,555
Shake it with your wrist.

206
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,227
Use your whole arm.

207
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,686
More.

208
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,065
You think I'm kidding around,
but I'm serious.

209
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,318
Mama would've put in half the bottle.
She had to buy it by the crate.

210
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,111
Alvin's gonna hate this.

211
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,738
I have to stop.

212
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,368
Oh, I cannot believe
you're from New Orleans.

213
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,702
I miss it so much.

214
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,415
Well, I only lived there for a short while,
but my mama was born and bred.

215
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,919
You know something?

216
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,923
Alvin pretends he doesn't know who
you are, but the minute you came to town

217
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,675
- he read your books.
- No!

218
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,095
He had one of his men pick up
Breakfast at Tiffany's in Kansas City

219
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,722
'cause it's banned in the library here.

220
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,977
And he said, "I feel like you're spiting me."

221
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,566
I said,
"Do you think I took this job to spite you?"

222
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:00,282
I was writing the script as they were filming,
all that time in Italy

223
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,784
and I'd work like mad all day long

224
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,745
and then dash down to the bar
around midnight

225
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,789
to hand in the next day's scenes.

226
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,126
And Humphrey had just about
moved into the hotel bar...

227
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,294
Humphrey Bogart.

228
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,087
...where he and John...

229
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,297
John Huston.

230
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,673
...had...

231
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,341
They drank every night.

232
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:22,178
And I mean drank, you know,
like famished water buffeloes.

233
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,972
Well,

234
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,978
I'd only just handed them the final scene
when the bellhop told me I had a phone call.

235
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,648
And it was my stepfather, Joe Capote,

236
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,526
calling to say that my mother had died.

237
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:41,948
I flew home to New York,
terribly distraught,

238
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,827
but when I got to the apartment

239
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:50,040
I could see that Joe
was in even worse shape than I was.

240
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,710
He grabbed my hand and he said to me

241
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,712
"Talk.

242
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,637
"Talk about anything." You know?

243
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,016
"I mean, any subject in the world.

244
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,852
"Don't worry whether it'll interest me or not.

245
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,520
"Just talk

246
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,566
"so I won't break down."

247
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,488
He couldn't bear to be alone
with his thoughts.

248
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,032
It was too painful.

249
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,379
It's been a hard couple of weeks for Alvin.

250
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,548
He and Herb Clutter were good friends
from church.

251
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,841
Oh, Marie.

252
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,719
Oh, come on, Alvin. These are good people.

253
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,627
Why would they put a pillow
under the boy's head just to shoot him?

254
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,640
Why would they tuck Nancy in?

255
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,022
So many of my friends
would love to meet you.

256
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:40,275
- Oh, that'd be fine.
- You don't have to worry

257
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,236
'cause I'm not going to write about this
till everything's over.

258
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,904
Well, I'm not worried.

259
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:49,284
I know what room you're in at the hotel,
and I know where you live in Brooklyn.

260
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,084
You're celebrating.

261
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,046
Well, remember Nelle's manuscript
she sent me in New York?

262
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,965
Yeah. Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird.

263
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,719
- You said it was good.
- And I was right.

264
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,513
She just heard
Lippincott wants to publish it.

265
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,936
Well, Jesus.

266
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:22,025
Jesus, well, that's terrific.
Tell her congratulations from me.

267
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,443
Congratulations.

268
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,320
- Thank you.
- Jealous.

269
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,699
- Will you be home by Christmas?
- I wanna come home.

270
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,118
I wanna come home. I do. I just

271
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,788
thought if they catch whoever did this,
who knows what?

272
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:38,208
- I'll probably be here till next Christmas.
- I'm gonna let you go.

273
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,375
I...

274
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,211
No, don't go.

275
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,047
We'll go away next spring to write.

276
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,007
- Maybe Spain.
- Yeah.

277
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,676
- Okay, I'm gonna let you go.
- Jack...

278
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,431
Jack, I promise.
We'll go away this spring to write.

279
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,266
- Maybe Spain.
- Okay.

280
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,269
All right.

281
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:07,070
My wife worked there, too.

282
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,198
What did she do in the house?

283
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,910
Cleaning. Cooking a little bit.

284
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,481
Quiet, quiet. Quiet, quiet.

285
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,736
"Girdle up. No extra bulges.

286
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,947
"If you're dressed right, when he gets home

287
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,950
"the rest of the evening
should be smooth sailing.

288
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,077
"Bon voyage, gals."

289
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,456
I can't believe you got that whole page.
I only read it once.

290
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,625
- I've tested my...
- Tested myself.

291
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,919
- I have 94%...
- Percent recall.

292
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,714
- Cut that out.
- Cut that out.

293
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,132
Cut that...

294
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,929
Cut that out.

295
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,432
Isn't that something, Alvin?

296
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,309
Oh, it's impressive.

297
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,603
Thank you.

298
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,329
- I'm sorry. He's upset.
- What's he upset about?

299
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,289
They know who did it.

300
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,540
Two men.

301
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,002
You know, they passed through Kansas City
last week writing bad checks.

302
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,214
By the time Alvin's boys got up there,
they were gone.

303
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,715
Skipped out.

304
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,134
Yeah. They don't know where.

305
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,053
No idea.

306
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,307
One of them had a cellmate
who gave him up for the $1,000 reward.

307
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,393
Do they know the name of the cellmate?

308
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,813
No. No, I don't know. Alvin knows.

309
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,067
I guess this isn't the appropriate time
to go ask him.

310
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,819
He's beside himself.

311
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,328
Hello?

312
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,581
Alvin, get in here.

313
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,254
- Dad, it's the telephone.
- Not now, Alvin.

314
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,173
God damn it.

315
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,343
Get over here.

316
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:39,180
- Dad!
- Alvin, not now.

317
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:43,434
Sit.

318
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,197
Dad? Dad?

319
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:00,034
You need to call the Chief of Police
in Las Vegas.

320
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,208
- Alvin, what'd you say?
- He said you need to call them immediately.

321
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,466
- Truman Capote.
- Dorothy Sanderson.

322
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:24,637
I figured you'd be left alone this morning
by that hardworking husband of yours

323
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,641
so I have breakfast, and I have news,
and I have literature.

324
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,185
My friend, Jack, mailed me
that book you wanted

325
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,688
and I inscribed it myself.

326
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,443
"To the maiden of the Midwest,
the priestess of the plains,

327
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,113
"the queen of the kitchen,
my first novel. Truman."

328
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,244
- You're too much. Come on in.
- Oh, thank you.

329
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,747
Go into the living room. Have a seat.

330
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,419
Let me get that.
It's been ringing all morning.

331
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,047
Hello?

332
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,926
Truman, I meant in here.

333
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,678
That's the women's cell.

334
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,098
It's hardly ever used,
but they wanted them separate.

335
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,434
Let's sit in the living room.

336
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,948
They put you in the women's cell.

337
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,126
Do you have any aspirin?

338
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:20,962
My legs.

339
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,798
Truman?

340
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,300
Please.

341
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,349
I'm sorry.

342
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,945
In the matter of the State of Kansas
v. Richard Eugene Hickock

343
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,989
and Perry Edward Smith

344
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,576
this court has been informed
by counsel, Mr. Weeks,

345
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,871
that the defendants wish to waive their right
to a preliminary hearing.

346
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,709
His mind is somewhere else.

347
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:02,878
Mr. Hickock, is that your wish?

348
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,508
Yes, sir.

349
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,844
Why are they doing that?

350
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,389
Mr. Smith.

351
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,232
I ask that the waiver be effectuated.

352
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,443
"Effectuated?"

353
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,777
So noted.

354
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,666
Remove the prisoners.

355
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,890
Was it your choice to waive the hearing?

356
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,357
Do you still need some?

357
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,655
Give me your hand.

358
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,089
I could kill you if you got too close.

359
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:44,188
Now, would you like some water, or...

360
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,158
Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book.

361
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,963
He said we'd curry favor with the judge

362
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,216
if we waived our rights.

363
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,009
Who did?

364
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,303
The lawyer.

365
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,153
Your picture's undignified.

366
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,656
People recall first impressions.

367
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,077
What's been your first impression?

368
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,004
Hello.

369
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,547
- Mr. Shawn.
- Truman.

370
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,090
I'm writing a book.

371
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,426
It's too much for a single article.

372
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,137
This town, the killers most of all.

373
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,015
You will be stunned by Perry Smith.

374
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,641
Why, what's happening?

375
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:06,395
Well, not much yet, but I know.
I can sense him.

376
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,607
He's desperately lonely, frightened.

377
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,358
I have a question.

378
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,943
Are you ready?

379
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,904
- Would it matter?
- No.

380
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,283
How much more money can you send me?

381
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,204
And how quickly could you get Dick Avedon
out here to take some pictures?

382
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,128
Who are you smiling at right now?

383
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,880
I'm smiling at you.

384
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:36,509
You know, Dick's a very famous
fashion photographer.

385
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,011
World-famous.

386
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,932
Am I gonna be in a fashion magazine?

387
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,061
So there's no worry of having a bad picture.

388
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,276
Who were you closer to,
your mom or your dad?

389
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,153
- What's that?
- Who were you closer to,

390
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,280
- your mom or your dad?
- Well, both.

391
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,782
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

392
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,077
- Have you talked to them?
- Yeah.

393
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,162
Who'd you talk to first?

394
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,420
Perry, honey, you look terrific, baby.

395
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,133
That was good.

396
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,595
Can you show us the tattoo
on your chest then?

397
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,805
Yeah.

398
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,980
Where did Perry get the art set?

399
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,069
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

400
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:22,823
Yes, sir.

401
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:25,451
Defendants, rise.

402
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,791
Perry Edward Smith
and Richard Eugene Hickock,

403
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:38,005
you stand accused of four counts
of the crime of murder in the first degree.

404
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,091
Have you reached a unanimous verdict?

405
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,760
We have, Your Honor.

406
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,428
What is your verdict?

407
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,764
Guilty on all four counts.

408
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,731
Have you unanimously reached a sentence?

409
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,109
We have, Your Honor.

410
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,903
What is the sentence?

411
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,197
Death.

412
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,217
I need to see him before we go.

413
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,139
Perry.

414
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,394
They're going to transfer you
up to Lansing today.

415
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,773
You'll have to make sure
to put me on the visitors list.

416
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,151
Otherwise I can't see you.

417
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,448
I'm going to help find you a proper lawyer.

418
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:54,206
You need a serious lawyer for an appeal.

419
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,920
Now they took Dick last night.

420
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,550
And I need you to get him
to do the same thing

421
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,219
and just put me on the visitors list.

422
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,834
And I thought, "Where does the family eat?"
You know?

423
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,378
I mean, does he, like,
reach his hand through the bars

424
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:44,339
and have dinner
with everyone around the table?

425
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:48,427
Nelle, kudos on... Kill the Bird. Is it?

426
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:52,347
- That's close. Thank you.
- That's marvelous. Who's your publisher?

427
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,767
- Lippincott.
- Yes. It's a children's book, right?

428
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,061
- Yes.
- No, no. It's about children.

429
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,687
- Yes.
- Yes, I've heard a lot about it.

430
00:39:58,772 --> 00:39:59,897
- Good.
- Congratulations.

431
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,690
- Thank you.
- I didn't even know she wrote.

432
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,692
He's sad and he's shy.

433
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,403
And he's terrified.

434
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,865
They shotgunned the entire family
in the face.

435
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,244
And I thought, at first,
"I'm gonna be scared of these men.

436
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,038
"I'm gonna run, run right home."

437
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,124
Actually, the brother in the family,

438
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,960
Kenyon is his name,

439
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,881
they had placed a pillow under his head

440
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,259
and then shot him point-blank in the face.

441
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:32,888
Almost as if they were putting him to sleep,

442
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,681
and then shot him.

443
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,853
This is the start of a great love affeir.

444
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:43,065
Yeah. Truman in love with Truman.

445
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:47,152
The book I'm writing will return him
to the realm of humanity.

446
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,864
It's the book I was always meant to write.

447
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,538
Well, he hasn't actually
written a word of it yet,

448
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,999
but he says it's the nonfiction book
of the decade,

449
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,417
so...

450
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,337
So,

451
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,257
what have you been doing?

452
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,179
And I'll tell you,

453
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:18,267
I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week,
talking about movies' art.

454
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:23,480
Finally I had to break it to her that
of the four Matisses hanging on her wall,

455
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,357
two were upside down.

456
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,611
Can I have another, please?

457
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,282
To answer your question,
I'm following Breakfast at Tiffany's

458
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,492
by blazing a different path.

459
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,787
By inventing an entirely new kind of writing.

460
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,956
The nonfiction novel.

461
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,125
- You have a subject?
- Yes.

462
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,127
On the night of November 14,

463
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:49,882
two men broke into a quiet farmhouse
in Kansas and murdered an entire family.

464
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:52,718
Now, why did they do that?

465
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,220
Two worlds exist in this country.

466
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:59,141
The quiet, conservative life,
and the life of those two men.

467
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,352
The underbelly. The criminally violent.

468
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,939
And those worlds converged
that bloody night.

469
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,233
Now, I spent the past three months

470
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:11,361
interviewing everyone in Kansas
touched by that violence.

471
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,822
Now I spent hours talking to the killers

472
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,616
and I'll spend more.

473
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,577
'Cause researching this work
has changed my life.

474
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,998
You know, it's altered my point of view
about almost everything.

475
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:24,750
Yeah.

476
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:28,503
And I think those who read it
will be similarly affected.

477
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,609
So you find them a new lawyer.

478
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,862
Well, they're facing execution in six weeks.

479
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,243
You know, they need someone
to argue whether or not that's right.

480
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:04,957
Okay.

481
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,334
And I'd also like to see them alive.

482
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,461
- Well...
- Yeah.

483
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,339
Yeah, I need to hear their stories.

484
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:17,678
Well, just be careful what you do
to get what you want.

485
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,348
I'm finding them a lawyer.

486
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:26,353
- Truman, you're finding yourself a lawyer.
- No, I'm finding them a lawyer.

487
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,898
There's a difference.

488
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,426
The Warden will see you now.

489
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:03,265
Well, we do all right by our boys.

490
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,892
Showers once a week. Feed them good.

491
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,980
We'll be feeding Perry Smith
in the infirmary soon if he don't eat.

492
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,773
Try and get the food in through his arm.

493
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,984
I'm sorry, what are you talking about?

494
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,236
Well, he hasn't eaten in a month.

495
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,822
It ain't his right to kill himself.

496
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,490
It's the right of the people.

497
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,200
The people of this state.

498
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,661
And that's who I work for, the people.

499
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,789
- No one told me.
- Yeah, he won't eat.

500
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,838
- When can I see him?
- Well, let me see.

501
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,219
How about you coming 3:00,
Thursday afternoon?

502
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,387
No.

503
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,891
That's no good.

504
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,269
I need to see them now.

505
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,856
Then whenever I want, for as long as I want.

506
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:57,652
Well, that's just not how we do things
around here, Mr. Capote.

507
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:02,366
Yeah, I understand what a burden

508
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:06,119
unlimited visitation might be
on this institution

509
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,830
and on the people who pay for it.

510
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,375
And I want to be clear

511
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,586
that I don't expect the citizens
of Leavenworth County

512
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,005
to have to shoulder that burden.

513
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,139
This is to be dispensed as you see fit.

514
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,322
You know, I didn't know
where to count your boy at first,

515
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,241
him being half-lndian.

516
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,078
But I did him a favor.
I counted him as a white man.

517
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,457
You're a kind and generous man.

518
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,418
Spread your feet.

519
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,302
This way.

520
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:18,775
- Hey, hey.
- Yeah, hello.

521
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,904
Hey, thanks a lot for your help
with the lawyer.

522
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,322
Oh, that's fine.

523
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,996
Wow. You must be really desperate
for a story to come all the way out here.

524
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,835
You want to go see Perry, go ahead.

525
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,587
Thank you.

526
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,839
You want my advice, though, Mr. Capote,

527
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,633
he's just trying to prove
the insanity defense.

528
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:45,403
It's okay.

529
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,367
It's Truman. It's your friend.

530
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:55,914
It's okay.

531
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,561
This is before she had us.

532
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,064
Before she started drinking.

533
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,068
Who took care of you as a child?

534
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,196
Orphanage.

535
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:53,782
Me and Linda.

536
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,201
And that's your sister?

537
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:09,673
You know, we're not so different
as you might think.

538
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:14,511
Yeah, I was abandoned repeatedly
as a child.

539
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,770
My mama would drag me along
to some new town

540
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,357
so she could take up
with another man she'd met.

541
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:32,779
Night after night,
she'd lock me in the hotel room alone.

542
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:38,451
Mama would turn the latch and tell the staff
not to let me out no matter what.

543
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,082
And I was terrified.

544
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,463
And I'd scream my head off

545
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,136
until finally I'd collapse

546
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:01,683
on the carpet next to the door
and I'd fall asleep.

547
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,771
Then after years of this

548
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,815
she just left me

549
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:12,610
with relatives in Alabama.

550
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,323
Who raised you up?

551
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,076
My aunts.

552
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,582
And that's where I met Nelle.

553
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,501
And she lived next door.

554
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:37,343
Your mother was Indian?

555
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:38,970
Cherokee.

556
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,849
So drinking was not a good thing for her.

557
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,102
No tolerance for it.

558
00:51:57,865 --> 00:52:00,700
We're on suicide watch.

559
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,788
That's why they leave the lights on at night.

560
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,040
I hope we're past that now.

561
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,374
I do.

562
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,055
Be careful of Ricardo.

563
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,142
I think he wants you all to himself.

564
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:27,977
All right.

565
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,313
But he's naturally mendacious.

566
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,982
Not to be trusted.

567
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,694
If he had $100,
he'd steal a stick of chewing gum.

568
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,749
Perry, I want to take your notebooks
with me.

569
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,087
I want to read them.

570
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,883
If I leave here without understanding you

571
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:03,054
the world will see you as a monster,

572
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:04,931
always.

573
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,602
I don't want that.

574
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,797
'Cause he trusts me.
I mean, that's why he gave it to me.

575
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:41,301
And he's given me absolutely everything.

576
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:45,930
And he wants so badly
to be taken seriously,

577
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,641
to be held in some esteem.

578
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,143
Do you?

579
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,561
Do I what?

580
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,105
Do you hold him in esteem, Truman?

581
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,734
Well,

582
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,779
he's a gold mine.

583
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:06,159
And he's told me his entire life.

584
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,495
His dead mother.

585
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,832
He had a brother and a sister
kill themselves.

586
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:14,083
Awful.

587
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,670
Did you tell him
your mama did the same thing?

588
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,088
See, I can't tell him everything.

589
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,091
We've been talking our heads off
for the past month.

590
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,010
And sometimes

591
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,016
when I think how good my book can be,
I can hardly breathe.

592
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,858
Anyway, this is what
I wanted to read to you.

593
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:42,278
"If called upon to make a speech"...

594
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,364
"If called upon to make a speech?"

595
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,533
I mean, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

596
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:51,496
A speech, just in case
he's ever recognized for an achievement.

597
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:56,042
"I can't remember what I was going to say
for the life of me.

598
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,546
"I don't think ever before have so many
people been so directly responsible

599
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:02,840
"for my being so very, very glad.

600
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,885
"It's a wonderful moment and a rare one.

601
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,720
"Thank you!"

602
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:11,391
There's an exclamation point
at the end of that "thank you"

603
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,393
in case you didn't catch it.

604
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,398
Where'd you go?

605
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,194
I guess it stopped being funny.

606
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,530
I never said it was.

607
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,741
Wait, listen to this.

608
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,744
I was 14.

609
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:35,081
One day I said to her, "Mom's dead."
I could see it.

610
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,418
A week later we got the news.
She finally drunk herself...

611
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,836
Found her shivering...

612
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,171
She hit me so many times
with that flashlight,

613
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,339
she broke it.

614
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:45,425
That night,
I dreamed about that big yellow bird.

615
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,260
Clawed that nun's eyes, bright like the sun.

616
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,928
Liffed me to the sky.

617
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,432
Sometimes you see a thing how it really is.

618
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,107
Well, you're nothing if not hardworking.

619
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,943
Hey, you look good. Healthy again.

620
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,616
You know,
I've decided on a title for my book.

621
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,619
I think you'll like it.

622
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,621
It's very masculine.

623
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,041
In Cold Blood.

624
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,710
Isn't that good?

625
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:27,133
And that refers to the crime or the fact
that you're still talking to the criminals?

626
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,139
The former, among other things.

627
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:35,725
I see.

628
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,982
I wanted to ask

629
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,110
if you'd let me look
at your investigation notes.

630
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:50,156
That lawyer you helped find
for your friends

631
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,992
got them a hearing
at the Kansas Supreme Court...

632
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,410
I heard this morning.

633
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,163
...on the issue of inadequate counsel.

634
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:04,504
Alvin,

635
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:08,925
I mean,
do you not want me to look at your notes?

636
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,677
You are permitted to say no.

637
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,187
I'll tell you what.

638
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,023
If those boys get off,

639
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,693
I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down.

640
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:32,198
I have to be in court at 9:00

641
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,702
but you call Roy Church
and he'll show you what you want to see.

642
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,041
Thank you.

643
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,294
It's as much for me as for anyone.

644
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,881
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing you so soon.

645
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:52,176
We're gonna be able to use your book
for our case.

646
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,222
You'll write
we never got to raise an insanity plea.

647
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,393
You wrote how terrible the lawyers was.

648
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:05,731
I haven't written a word yet.

649
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,160
What have you been doing?

650
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:20,913
Research. Talking to you.

651
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:26,919
All right.

652
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,423
- I had hoped...
- What are you calling it?

653
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:33,843
The book?

654
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,264
I have no idea.

655
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,352
Perry,

656
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,606
if I'm going to write about you,

657
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,402
if I'm going to determine
how to write about you,

658
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,530
we need to talk about,

659
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,783
you know, why you're here.

660
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,623
You know, the murders,

661
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,374
and that night,

662
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,877
at the Clutter house.

663
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,222
Do you worry what I'll think?

664
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,890
Is that it?

665
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,395
Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.

666
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,900
I know a lot of people.

667
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:42,161
Perry, I have invitations
to be in Morocco, Greece,

668
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,332
and I prefer to be here,

669
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,000
with you.

670
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,343
Jack, be patient with me.

671
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,846
I'm just missing this one piece.

672
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,100
Well, how long is that gonna take?

673
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,769
Why don't you just try leaving him alone
for a while?

674
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,354
Come to Spain.

675
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,523
You can always visit him later.

676
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,108
I don't know.

677
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,528
Well, I'm off. I'm just...
I've got my own writing to do.

678
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:18,698
Well, do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

679
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,284
There's too many people around. I've...

680
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,704
I'll leave the address on the kitchen table.

681
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:29,667
Well, think about what I said,
and join me when you can.

682
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,044
I will.

683
01:00:32,713 --> 01:00:33,796
- I will.
- Ckay?

684
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,006
Bye.

685
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,406
Hi.

686
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,596
Truman.

687
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,183
We never intended on killing that family.

688
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:31,354
Capote, will you get that straight
in your book, please?

689
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,230
No premeditation.

690
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,399
What are you doing?

691
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,526
I have to fly back East.

692
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,029
When?

693
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,532
An hour. I miss you already.

694
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,534
Write me every five minutes.

695
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,538
Hey, you know,
we never did intend on killing that family.

696
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,958
Capote?

697
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:39,755
What?

698
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,090
Truman,

699
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,468
I've not been able to tear myself
away from your book.

700
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,429
It's that good.

701
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,265
It's not good, it's astonishing.

702
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:52,101
- This first half is astonishing.
- Oh, thank you.

703
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,019
When will you be done, do you think?

704
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,939
Yes, I'm already well into the third part.

705
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,274
But

706
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:03,529
I can't finish that till I convince Perry
to describe the night of the killings to me.

707
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:07,324
I was planning to visit this fall, see?

708
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,869
Then I think you need to talk to him now.

709
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:13,456
And we all need to see how this ends
for the final part.

710
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,460
I can't finish the book
till I know what happens.

711
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:20,880
If Perry and Dick are executed,
it's one thing.

712
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,631
And if not, well...

713
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,550
Truman, you got your ending.

714
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,801
I really don't know.

715
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,387
The Kansas Court denied their appeal.

716
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,806
It came over the wire on Friday.

717
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:34,310
I mean, you need to talk to Perry now.

718
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,520
He'll be dead by September.

719
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,815
I mean, I'm sorry.

720
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,902
I know how much
you've come to care about him.

721
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,658
Right. Yes, right.

722
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:53,496
So I want to set up a reading for you
in the fall, in New York,

723
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:57,708
and, well, we'll build some interest,
and we'll publish in the fall.

724
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,352
Thank God. There's nothing in the house.

725
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:18,938
Why aren't you working?

726
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,566
Well, I knew you couldn't be counted on
to stock the kitchen.

727
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,445
What are we going to feed
our famous guest?

728
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,616
Oh, Jesus, I completely forgot.

729
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,203
Plus, I finished my novel yesterday.

730
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,455
What?

731
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:54,056
When was the last time you wrote to him?

732
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,308
I don't know.

733
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,230
What's this?

734
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,400
It's a letter for Truman
I was asked to deliver.

735
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,068
It's from Perry.

736
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,654
Let's have it.

737
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:21,000
"Dear friend Truman, where are you?

738
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:25,087
"Read this item in a medical dictionary.

739
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,092
"'Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia'

740
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,178
"'by fracture of the cervical vertebrae'

741
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,514
"'by laceration of the trachea.'

742
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,351
"Not too comforting, as we lost our appeal.

743
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:42,021
"Missing you.

744
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,857
"Alone and desirous of your presence.

745
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,694
"Your amigo. Perry."

746
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,448
Mr. Shawn told me
about the court decision yesterday.

747
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,535
I was wondering
why you were in such a good mood.

748
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,622
That's a terrible thing to say.

749
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,876
I write him all the time. I've just...

750
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,004
I've been so focused on the book lately.

751
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,565
So Jack thinks I'm using Perry,

752
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:30,486
but he also thinks I fell in love with him
when I was in Kansas.

753
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,573
Now, how both of those things can be true
is beyond me.

754
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:36,700
Thank you.

755
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,914
Well, did you?

756
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,833
Did you fall in love with him?

757
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,671
I don't know how to answer that.

758
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:49,922
Truman.

759
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:56,428
It's as if Perry and I grew up
in the same house,

760
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:02,726
and one day he stood up
and went out the back door

761
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,562
while I went out the front.

762
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,858
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

763
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,448
Listen, you be nice to Jack.

764
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,785
Sometimes I think
he's what I like about you best.

765
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:23,205
I'll see you at the reading in New York.

766
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:28,460
- 16th.
- 16th.

767
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,130
Adis.

768
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,607
What was he in jail for?

769
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:54,445
Well, they said
it was for not paying his taxes,

770
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,740
but really, for being an outsider.

771
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:01,076
Refusing to go along.

772
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,579
Lowell, you're being moved.

773
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,539
- Why?
- You're going to final holding.

774
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,707
No.

775
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,793
Come on, Lowell. Open the door.

776
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,468
Stand up.

777
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,596
- Put your arms behind your back.
- Okay, last chance.

778
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,847
Get up.

779
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,725
Turn around.
Put your arms behind your back.

780
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:45,871
Now Dick and me, we're next in line.

781
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:53,128
I'm so sorry I've been away.

782
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,258
It was a long time.

783
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,595
I know.

784
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,601
How's the book coming along?

785
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,146
Very slowly.

786
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,567
Will you show it to me?

787
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:18,153
I've hardly written anything.

788
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,014
Good evening, New Yorkers,

789
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,144
and thank you for coming
to the first public reading,

790
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,939
the first offering of any kind,

791
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:57,234
of Truman Capote's new work,
In Cold Blood.

792
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,709
Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

793
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:20,382
For this evening's program,
I'm going to read some passages

794
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,302
from the first three parts of my new book.

795
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:34,271
"The village of Holcomb stands on
the high wheat plains of western Kansas,

796
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:38,567
"a lonesome area
that other Kansans call 'out there.'

797
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:43,322
"Until one morning in mid-November, 1959

798
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:47,367
"few Americans, in fact, few Kansans,
had ever heard of Holcomb.

799
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,163
"Like the waters of the Arkansas River,

800
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,624
"like the motorists on the highway,

801
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,585
"exceptional happenings
never stopped there.

802
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,267
"Perry Smith's voice
was both gentle and prim.

803
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:15,145
"A voice that, though soff,

804
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,689
"manufactured each sound exactly,

805
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:23,403
"ejected it like a smoke ring
issuing from a parson's mouth.

806
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:33,622
"The four coffins, which quite filled
the small, flower-crowded parlor,

807
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:36,708
"were to be sealed at the funeral services,

808
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:39,211
"very understandably,

809
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,756
"for the effect was disquieting.

810
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,344
"Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet,

811
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,930
"her brother a bright plaid shirt.

812
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,350
"The parents were more sedately attired,

813
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:58,063
"Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel,
his wife in navy-blue crepe.

814
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:02,776
"And it was this especially
that lent the scene an awful aura,

815
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,655
"the head of each
was completely encased in cotton.

816
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:11,910
"A swollen cocoon twice the size
of an ordinary blown-up balloon.

817
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,246
"And the cotton,

818
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:17,582
"because it had been sprayed
with a glossy substance,

819
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,460
"twinkled like Christmas tree snow.

820
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:26,466
"Cne Tuesday at dawn,
a carload of strangers,

821
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,177
"ignorant of the local disaster,

822
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:32,597
"were startled by what they saw
as they crossed the prairies

823
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,558
"and passed through Holcomb.

824
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:36,268
"Windows ablaze.

825
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,646
"Almost every window
in almost every house,

826
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:43,316
"and in the brightly-lit rooms,
fully-clothed people,

827
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,318
"even entire families,

828
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:50,615
"who had sat the whole night wide awake,
watchful, listening.

829
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,535
"Cf what were they frightened?

830
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:56,621
"It might happen again."

831
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,500
Thank you.

832
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,985
And I slipped and I ripped a hole,

833
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,362
from the bottom of my scrotum

834
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:33,366
all the way up
to the top of the crack of my ass.

835
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,994
And I sat there.

836
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:39,289
And I didn't know it. All I felt was a...

837
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,627
I didn't know it. All I felt
was a cool breeze, you know, between my...

838
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,006
Sorry. If I may...

839
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:50,842
Yes.

840
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:55,555
Your portrait of those men was territying.

841
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,557
Territying.

842
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,186
Thank you.

843
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:06,858
Stop that man! Come back here!

844
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,443
Dad!

845
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:14,366
Have any of you met my father?

846
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:21,414
He hasn't spanked me in years.

847
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,751
George didn't come backstage.

848
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:27,420
He had... He had a...

849
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,507
Something that his wife
had to rush him off to.

850
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:34,261
- But he made a point of...
- Well, I'm still waiting for a call.

851
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,472
It was beautiful.
And everybody came. Everybody came.

852
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:40,225
- Tennessee loved it.
- Of course he loved it.

853
01:14:41,102 --> 01:14:42,769
Should we do more?

854
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:46,273
No, we just sit and wait
while people talk about it,

855
01:14:46,357 --> 01:14:48,483
and we let them do the work.

856
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:52,487
I mean,
this book is going to change everything.

857
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,867
It's gonna change
how people see your writing.

858
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:02,956
I think it's going to change
how people write.

859
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:10,297
- Are you gonna be finished by October?
- I think so.

860
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,386
You know,
they're scheduled for next month.

861
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:17,804
To hang.

862
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:19,514
Yeah.

863
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,145
We're gonna commit as many issues
as it takes to publish.

864
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:27,189
Whatever it takes.

865
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:30,275
Well, I'm going to Kansas tomorrow

866
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:34,905
- and I'll get Perry to talk.
- What's he got to lose?

867
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,492
Sorry, but...

868
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,041
Hey, this may sound strange to you

869
01:15:47,001 --> 01:15:49,044
but I'm going to miss him.

870
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,838
You'll be able to finish now.

871
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:16,696
Need to check your papers, sir.

872
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,452
This is what we've been waiting for.

873
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:25,330
A stay of execution
to make a federal appeal.

874
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,040
All thanks to you.

875
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,502
Thank you!

876
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:35,131
They're not gonna corner me now.
Not unless the U.S. Government says so.

877
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:40,303
Kansas has had it in for me for 10 years.
They can't corner me now.

878
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,014
Hey, Perry, sit down

879
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,684
for a minute.

880
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:51,856
I need you to talk to me.

881
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:55,235
We've got all the time in the world to talk.

882
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:57,237
I've been thinking about Ricardo.

883
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:00,490
You really need to stop sending him
those trashy books.

884
01:17:01,492 --> 01:17:03,827
I won't even mention the pornography.

885
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,790
Now, I realize that Dick probably can't grasp
the literature that you gave me.

886
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,584
And the books you send him only...

887
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,170
They only exacerbate the problem.

888
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:17,507
They only heighten or intensity it.

889
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,218
Maybe we can get him started
on a program.

890
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,887
Perry, I know what "exacerbate" means.

891
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,058
Okay, well, just thinking...

892
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:31,563
There's not a word or a sentence
or a concept that you can illuminate for me.

893
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,774
There is one singular reason
I keep coming here.

894
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:38,069
- Truman.
- November 14, 1959.

895
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,614
Three years ago. Three years.

896
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:47,537
And that's all I want to hear from you.

897
01:17:54,462 --> 01:17:56,921
Now I asked you not to. Ever.

898
01:17:57,757 --> 01:18:02,135
This is absurd.
Do you know what absurd means?

899
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:09,601
I'm ready. I have a plane to catch.

900
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:12,395
I found your sister in Tacoma.

901
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:15,899
Maybe she'll talk to me
about something useful.

902
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,404
Please don't go out there.

903
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:27,243
Hey, this is my work, Perry. I'm working.

904
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:32,040
And when you want to tell me
what I need to hear, you let me know.

905
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:46,054
June's dead. Frank shot himself.

906
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:50,308
Now Perry did what he did.

907
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,814
I used to love him. He was my little doll.

908
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,191
He scares me now.

909
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:02,320
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Ten years ago.

910
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:05,198
Ten years.

911
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:14,499
Could I borrow one of these pictures?

912
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,836
Take the whole thing.
I don't want them anymore.

913
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:24,426
Don't be taken in by my brother.
He's got this sensitive side he'll show.

914
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,679
You believe he's gentle and so easily hurt,

915
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:31,933
but he'd just as soon kill you
as shake your hand. I believe that.

916
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,901
Hello, handsome.

917
01:20:19,899 --> 01:20:32,243
What's the name of your book?

918
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,914
I don't know what you're talking about.

919
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:48,927
"Truman Capote read last night
before a packed audience

920
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:54,474
"from his nonfiction book In Cold Blood."

921
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:01,606
"The true-crime novel
tells of killers Richard Hickock

922
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,025
"and Perry Smith,

923
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:08,947
"who brutally murdered a Kansas family
three years ago."

924
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:14,786
- Wait, who sent that to you?
- That's not your goddamn business.

925
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,121
It is my business, because it's not true.

926
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,832
The organizers of the reading needed a title.

927
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:24,045
They picked one,
a sensational one, I admit,

928
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,838
to attract a crowd.

929
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,721
- They picked it?
- Yes.

930
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:39,310
- It's not your title.
- Perry, I haven't chosen one yet.

931
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,899
How could I choose a title when we still
haven't talked about that night?

932
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:49,571
How could I? I couldn't possibly.

933
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:58,162
You pretended to be my friend.

934
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:00,748
I'm sorry.

935
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:04,502
I should have told you.

936
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:08,673
And I couldn't pretend to be your friend,

937
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:13,052
'cause the truth is,
I can't help wanting to be.

938
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,685
You don't have to tell me anything

939
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,523
if you don't want to.

940
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:39,537
I have something

941
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,041
from your sister.

942
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,219
She misses you.

943
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,074
Look at my belly.

944
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:38,179
There must be something wrong with us,
to do what we did.

945
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,111
We heard there was $10,000 in that house.

946
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,657
Once we tied up everybody
and searched all over,

947
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:01,411
I knew the guy that told us about it
was wrong.

948
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,621
There was no money.

949
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,543
Dick wouldn't believe it,

950
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:12,463
so he went tearing through the house,
banging on the walls,

951
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,465
looking for a safe.

952
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,471
When he was done

953
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:26,185
he said he was gonna go up
to Nancy's room and have his way with her.

954
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:28,980
I wouldn't allow it.

955
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,983
And I told him that.

956
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,069
So I sat with her.

957
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:38,072
Dick came up and got me.

958
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:41,701
We turned off the lights
and went down to the basement

959
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,163
where Mr. Clutter and the boy was.

960
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,835
He kept saying, "No witnesses",

961
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:54,380
but I figured if I waited him out, he'd...

962
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:57,508
He'd give up
and we'd leave them tied up there.

963
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:01,012
And we'd drive all night.
They'd never find us.

964
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:05,683
We tied Mr. Clutter's wrists
to a pipe over his head.

965
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:09,771
And he looked hurt, so I cut him down.

966
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:14,859
I put a box out there
so he'd be more comfortable.

967
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:21,908
He asked how his wife and daughter was
and I said they were fine,

968
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:25,870
and they were getting ready for sleep,
and it wouldn't be long

969
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,040
till morning when they'd find him.

970
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,550
He was just looking at me.

971
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,553
Looking into my eyes.

972
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:46,474
Like he expected me to kill him.

973
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:51,729
Like he expected me to be
the kind of person who would kill him.

974
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:02,740
I was thinking,
"This nice man is scared of me."

975
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,331
I was so ashamed.

976
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:19,674
I mean, I thought he was a very nice,

977
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,928
gentle man.

978
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:28,766
And I thought so right up till I slit his
throat.

979
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:37,316
I didn't know what I did
till I heard the sound.

980
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,581
Added up,

981
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:39,420
how much money
did you get from the Clutters that night?

982
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,593
Between $40 and $50.

983
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:52,386
I mean, the truth is,
I'm desperate to be done with it.

984
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:58,392
I've spent four years of my life on this book.

985
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:07,068
They got a stay of execution yesterday.

986
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:09,403
Another, yes.

987
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:16,410
Supreme Court.

988
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:20,539
It's harrowing.

989
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:27,838
Me, all I want to do is to write the ending
and there's no end in sight.

990
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:44,772
No, thank you.

991
01:30:57,911 --> 01:31:01,914
"Dear friend Truman,
haven't heard from you in such a long while.

992
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,792
"Please help find new lawyer.

993
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:09,880
"If not, Dick will have to write
the Supreme Court brief himself.

994
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:16,137
"Our last appeal.
What a pair of wretched creatures.

995
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:18,722
"Please help. Your amigo?"

996
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:21,976
"Perry."

997
01:31:24,062 --> 01:31:26,147
Just put it with the others.

998
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,261
You know, at least for Nelle

999
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:01,140
you should try and pretend
you're having a good time tonight.

1000
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,311
I thought I'd find you here.

1001
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:50,022
Oh, Nelle.

1002
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:53,984
Thank you.

1003
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,320
I'll have another, please.

1004
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,825
- How are you?
- Terrible.

1005
01:33:03,662 --> 01:33:05,371
I'm sorry to hear that.

1006
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,832
I mean, it's torture the way...

1007
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,169
What they're doing to me.

1008
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,677
And now it's the Supreme Court.

1009
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:22,596
And can you believe it?

1010
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,725
If they win this appeal,

1011
01:33:28,186 --> 01:33:29,436
I will

1012
01:33:30,689 --> 01:33:33,190
have a complete nervous breakdown.

1013
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:37,361
I may never recover

1014
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:42,449
and I'll just pray that it turns my way.

1015
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:48,455
- It must be difficult.
- It's torture.

1016
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:52,042
They're torturing me.

1017
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:54,461
I see.

1018
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:01,552
And how'd you like the movie, Truman?

1019
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:28,746
I frankly don't see what all the fuss is about.

1020
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:15,709
Hello.

1021
01:35:15,794 --> 01:35:18,045
- Mr. Truman Capote?
- Yeah.

1022
01:35:18,505 --> 01:35:22,383
I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith
in the Kansas Correctional System.

1023
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:24,885
Will you accept charges?

1024
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:26,970
Yes.

1025
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:29,098
Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

1026
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:30,349
Hello.

1027
01:35:32,477 --> 01:35:33,519
Hello?

1028
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:35,062
Hello, Perry.

1029
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:38,941
They let me make a couple of phone calls
before I go down to holding.

1030
01:35:39,025 --> 01:35:42,361
You heard
the Supreme Court rejected the appeal?

1031
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:48,325
No, I didn't. I hadn't heard that.

1032
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:53,038
Yeah.

1033
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:57,835
I'm sorry.

1034
01:36:01,381 --> 01:36:04,049
Yeah. They let me make two phone calls.

1035
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,222
We got a date set for the warehouse,
Dick and me.

1036
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:14,518
Two weeks and finito.

1037
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,895
April 14.

1038
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,276
Will you visit me?

1039
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:24,736
Truman?

1040
01:36:52,724 --> 01:36:54,266
It's him again.

1041
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:04,568
It is utterly inappropriate for me
to talk to him.

1042
01:37:14,078 --> 01:37:15,162
Yes?

1043
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,503
I'm sorry, he won't be able to make it.

1044
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:37,893
- Hello?
- Mr. Shawn, it's Nelle.

1045
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,896
I just got this telegram. Has he seen it?

1046
01:37:41,147 --> 01:37:42,814
He won't read it.

1047
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,610
- Would you put him on, please?
- Nelle, he won't talk.

1048
01:37:46,986 --> 01:37:51,240
Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down
and put the phone on his ear,

1049
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:53,242
I need to speak to him.

1050
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:56,119
All right.

1051
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:19,685
It's Nelle.

1052
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:28,026
Truman.

1053
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:33,365
"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote.

1054
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:39,162
"Sorry that Truman was unable to make it
here to the prison

1055
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:42,374
"for a brief word prior to necktie party.

1056
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,961
"Whatever his reason for not showing up,

1057
01:38:46,379 --> 01:38:49,881
"I want him to know
that I cannot condemn him for it.

1058
01:38:52,552 --> 01:38:54,469
"Not much time leff

1059
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,974
"but want you both to know
that I've been sincerely grateful

1060
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:03,228
"for your friendship through the years
and everything else.

1061
01:39:04,731 --> 01:39:07,232
"I'm not very good at these things.

1062
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:11,737
"I have become extremely affectionate
toward you both."

1063
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:15,198
"But, harness time."

1064
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:20,412
"Adios, amigos. Your friend. Perry."

1065
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:35,552
Well, I didn't expect to see you again.

1066
01:39:36,763 --> 01:39:38,889
You can visit for a few minutes.

1067
01:39:43,353 --> 01:39:44,686
- Yeah.
- No.

1068
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,569
Five minutes.

1069
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,366
Well, well.

1070
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:00,786
He returns.

1071
01:40:02,205 --> 01:40:04,915
I don't know what you must think of me.

1072
01:40:06,626 --> 01:40:10,128
Well, you haven't been foremost
on my mind lately

1073
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,381
as you can probably imagine.

1074
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:17,928
You got the letter?

1075
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:21,473
Yes, I did.

1076
01:40:25,228 --> 01:40:28,980
It's true.
I understand why you didn't want to come.

1077
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:33,485
I wouldn't be here either if I didn't have to.

1078
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,278
You got that right.

1079
01:40:39,742 --> 01:40:42,619
You know Ricardo donated his eyes
to science?

1080
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:47,958
Next week, some blind man will be seeing
what Dick used to see.

1081
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,962
Yeah, you could be walking in Denver
or somewhere, Truman,

1082
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:55,132
and suddenly these eyes
will be staring at you.

1083
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,343
That would be something, wouldn't it?

1084
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:02,472
It would be. It would be.

1085
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:17,988
You'll be watching?

1086
01:41:19,532 --> 01:41:21,491
I don't know, I'll be...

1087
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:25,328
Do you want me to?

1088
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:32,335
I'd like to have a friend there.

1089
01:41:33,337 --> 01:41:35,714
Okay. Then I will.

1090
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:48,059
It's all right.

1091
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,539
I did everything I could.

1092
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:11,374
It's okay.

1093
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:23,011
I truly did.

1094
01:42:24,889 --> 01:42:26,056
I know.

1095
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,233
It's time.

1096
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:48,036
Mr. Capote.

1097
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:05,387
Goodbye.

1098
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:07,764
You're not rid of us yet.

1099
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,892
- We'll see you in a few minutes.
- I wish I had...

1100
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:12,310
Mr. Capote.

1101
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:14,980
- Mr. Capote.
- Goodbye.

1102
01:44:10,536 --> 01:44:12,162
Nice to see you.

1103
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,998
Perry Edward Smith.

1104
01:44:57,208 --> 01:45:00,919
For the crime of murder in the first degree,
by order of the Court of Finney County,

1105
01:45:01,045 --> 01:45:03,088
and the Supreme Court
of the sovereign state of Kansas,

1106
01:45:03,214 --> 01:45:04,923
you are sentenced to hang until you die.

1107
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:07,884
"I will fear no evil: For thou art with me.

1108
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:10,553
"Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me."

1109
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,056
You can say something if you want.

1110
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:20,689
Is there anybody from the family here?

1111
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:22,857
No, Perry.

1112
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:29,447
Well, tell them...

1113
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:39,749
I can't remember what I was gonna say
for the life of me.

1114
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:01,438
Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy name.

1115
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:05,775
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.

1116
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:08,903
Give us this day our daily bread.

1117
01:46:09,071 --> 01:46:12,073
And forgive those who trespass against us.

1118
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:16,327
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1119
01:46:45,983 --> 01:46:48,276
It was a terrible experience

1120
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:53,698
and I will never get over it.

1121
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:59,162
They're dead, Truman. You're alive.

1122
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:04,834
And there wasn't anything
I could have done to save them.

1123
01:47:07,797 --> 01:47:09,172
Maybe not,

1124
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,303
but, the fact is, you didn't want to.
