00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:28,745
Well?

3
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:32,105
Nothing.

4
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:40,144
Where was it?

5
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,865
In a plastic bag, on the porch.

6
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:51,664
What's wrong?

7
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:19,903
He must have been there, no?

8
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:22,783
Come inside.

9
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,940
Tomorrow, I'll ask the Rochants and
Beaufays if they saw anything.

10
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:50,305
He must have been there for a while.

11
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,780
I already called Antoine.
He saw nothing.

12
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,980
I got Marie's answering machine.

13
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,060
The tape runs for over 2 hours.

14
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,378
- When did you leave?
- I don't know.

15
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:25,454
Not long after you.
Around 8:45.

16
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,497
- François called to...
- There!

17
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:29,497
Give it here.

18
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:49,737
How did I manage to miss this guy?
I can't figure it out.

19
00:04:51,177 --> 00:04:53,421
Maybe the camera was in a car.

20
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:57,856
It doesn't look filmed
through a window

21
00:04:57,936 --> 00:05:00,456
Someplace on that house maybe?

22
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:08,375
It's dumb.
I don't know what to say.

23
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:13,295
Can you think of someone
who might do this as a prank?

24
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,895
We should eat
before it's totally ruined.

25
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:27,539
Maybe a friend of Pierrot's.

26
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:31,774
Some idiot playing games
with his pal's unhip parents.

27
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:38,173
- No?
- I doubt it. It's not really funny.

28
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,173
That's for sure.

29
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,538
- Where is he anyway?
- Who?

30
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:49,172
- Pierrot
- No idea. He'll be home soon.

31
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:56,852
Was it in there?

32
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:58,293
- What?
- The tape.

33
00:05:58,653 --> 00:06:00,971
No, in a supermarket bag.

34
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:02,051
Where is it?

35
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:06,371
I have no idea. In the living room,
or the den, or out in the hall. Who cares?

36
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:10,457
There was nothing inside?
No note or anything?

37
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:12,211
No, but nothing's stopping you
from checking for yourself.

38
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,771
Can you bring the salad?

39
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:30,330
Nothing fancy tonight.

40
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:49,729
- That the bag it was in?
- Yes.

41
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,808
What, you think I'm an idiot?

42
00:06:57,968 --> 00:07:00,048
You could have missed something.

43
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:06,248
You should eject the tape.
Maybe I missed a label or something.

44
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:07,648
Look, I'm only trying to...

45
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:13,488
Ah, the sonny boy is here.
Better late than never.

46
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:18,212
- Hi there.
- Hi.

47
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:22,646
Sit down, Pierrot.
I'll bring you a plate.

48
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:32,887
- Where were you?
- At Yves'.

49
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:33,892
Why?

50
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:38,445
Why? I want to know.
Do I need a reason?

51
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:42,686
- Evening, Pierrot.
- Evening, mom.

52
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:46,570
- Well?
- On Tuesdays, I go to Yves'.

53
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:51,605
Wednesdays, we have geometry
and he helps with my homework.

54
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:58,924
Maybe it's one of your fans.

55
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:11,124
Pierrot, don't breathe
in the breakout.

56
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:19,082
André, same for you.
Don't breathe in the breakout.

57
00:08:19,117 --> 00:08:21,162
- What?
- Hold your breath in the breakout.

58
00:08:21,197 --> 00:08:24,282
Thomas, think about your kick.

59
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:30,922
Pierrot, too shallow on the turn.

60
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,122
More depth.

61
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:41,561
André, that's good,
but you went too deep.

62
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,521
Too much depth.

63
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:47,481
Thomas, watch your breathing.

64
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,276
See you again in two weeks
for another round table.

65
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:34,310
Until then, good reading and thanks
to the new viewers tuning in every week.

66
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,671
Goodnight.

67
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,950
<i>Stay seated
while the credits roll, please!</i>

68
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,749
<i>Thank you everybody!</i>

69
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,906
The tape was wrapped in it.

70
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:56,025
What is it?

71
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:58,706
What's going on?

72
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:00,505
Georges?

73
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,190
What?

74
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:06,864
Nothing...

75
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:09,945
Nothing, I...

76
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:13,864
I'm tired.

77
00:13:18,784 --> 00:13:19,784
What do we do now?

78
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:22,504
Meaning?

79
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,023
You want to call the police?

80
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,023
Yes...

81
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:34,382
No... I don't know.
Let me see the drawing again.

82
00:13:41,582 --> 00:13:44,502
Maybe we should report it now.

83
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:51,141
It looks like a child's drawing.

84
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:52,742
No idea. I can't tell.

85
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,181
Should I ask Pierrot?

86
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,541
No, what's the use?

87
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:06,701
You really think one of his friends would
stay out all night to spy on us?

88
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,647
That would be stupid.

89
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,420
Why did you stop it?

90
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,501
Why not?

91
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:18,820
What more do you want to see?

92
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:22,500
It's dumb but I'm scared.

93
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,100
Did you talk to Pierrot about it?

94
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,259
No, do you think we should?

95
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:35,459
I don't know.

96
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:40,299
I no longer buy
the schoolboy prank theory.

97
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:41,264
What then?

98
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,378
What? What?
I haven't a clue.

99
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,417
Hello?

100
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,696
<i>- Mme Laurent
- Yes.</i>

101
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,721
<i>Hi, this is Manu.
Is Georges there?</i>

102
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:08,357
You just missed him by
a couple of minutes. Sorry.

103
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,549
<i>I wanted to remind him
about the Beaumont file.</i>

104
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,150
He took it. I saw him.

105
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:15,886
<i>Great, thank you.
Have a good day.</i>

106
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:17,936
Bye, Manu.

107
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:26,136
Yes?

108
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,541
<i>I'd like to speak to Georges Laurent.</i>

109
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:33,455
<i>- Who's asking?
- I'd like to speak to Georges Laurent.</i>

110
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:37,740
Who are you?
What do you want?

111
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:41,455
<i>I'd like to speak to the man
by the name of Georges Laurent.</i>

112
00:15:43,774 --> 00:15:45,618
- Hello.
- Hi. I just spoke to your wife...

113
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,353
...she wants you to call her back.
- OK, thank you.

114
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:01,533
What's this card?

115
00:16:01,812 --> 00:16:04,213
It came in the mail.

116
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,412
What's wrong with you, dickhead?

117
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:15,852
What?

118
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:17,973
Can't you be more careful, idiot?

119
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:18,898
Forget it.

120
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,532
- Say that again.
- What?

121
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,097
Repeat what you just said.

122
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,732
Don't you have eyes in your head?

123
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:27,852
I must be dreaming.
Which moron stepped out without looking?

124
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,052
But who's going the wrong way
down a one-way street?

125
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:36,336
Yell at me again.

126
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,056
Come on, yell at me again.

127
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:39,775
OK, let's not fight about this.

128
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,730
You weren't looking.
And we weren't looking, OK?

129
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,730
You'd better keep your big mouth shut.

130
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,689
I'm sorry.

131
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:11,689
In any case...
We know we're not getting any help.

132
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:18,248
As long as he doesn't torch the house
or send us bombs instead of tapes...

133
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:19,528
...we're in good shape.

134
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:22,087
Please, Georges.

135
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,570
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, Pierrot.

136
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:22,964
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

137
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:25,684
Why are you picking me up?

138
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:33,284
I had some free time.
I thought you'd like it.

139
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:34,324
I see.

140
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:39,244
No, I dropped Mom at work
and I wanted us to talk.

141
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:39,963
Why?

142
00:18:40,522 --> 00:18:42,123
Where was she?

143
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:47,563
We had stuff to do.
That's why I wanted to talk to you, too.

144
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:48,163
I see.

145
00:18:51,283 --> 00:18:54,282
What's with that card you sent?

146
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:55,481
What card?

147
00:19:00,082 --> 00:19:00,681
This one.

148
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,722
The teacher gave it to me at lunch.

149
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:10,641
She didn't get the weird drawing,
but found it odd you'd send cards to school.

150
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:41,195
Sitting all the way in the back
next to the mirror, you know.

151
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,315
Never keep a lady waiting,
especially an elderly lady.

152
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,840
So I go over, introduce myself...

153
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,114
...and ask why she wants to see me.
She apologizes for summoning me like that.

154
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:53,755
She offers me a seat.
She seems very emotional.

155
00:20:53,756 --> 00:20:55,056
So I sit next to her.

156
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:58,344
She says she's never been here before,

157
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,514
and isn't in the habit
of accosting strangers.

158
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,114
But I strongly remind her of someone,

159
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:04,799
and she couldn't help herself.

160
00:21:04,834 --> 00:21:06,955
It was someone she had loved very much.

161
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,720
What could I do?

162
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:12,953
She was in her 70s.
It was touching, her hands trembled.

163
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:14,357
Anyway...

164
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:17,393
You know I'm not the sentimental type.

165
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,113
Not really.

166
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,199
But she really got to me.

167
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:25,152
So I'm eagerly waiting to hear
about this guy I remind her of so much.

168
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:27,350
Who do you think it was?

169
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:29,513
Her lover? Father? Husband?

170
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:33,365
It was her dog.

171
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,899
Exactly.

172
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:36,876
What would you have done?

173
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:40,117
So I stand up and I say:
"Excellent, you've had your fun."

174
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:44,431
And I turn to leave.
Straight-faced, she begs me to me sit down.

175
00:21:44,466 --> 00:21:46,552
She says she knows
it all sounds ridiculous,

176
00:21:46,587 --> 00:21:48,512
but I must stay a bit longer,

177
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:50,435
and hear her story out.

178
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,156
She would never dare
to make fun of me.

179
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:55,990
It was weird,
but she seemed so desperate...

180
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,875
I sat back down.

181
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,111
And she begins her story.
How her dog died in a traffic accident in '64.

182
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,207
That's funny, I say...

183
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:06,235
I was born in '64.

184
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,714
She seemed offended
that I wasn't taking her seriously.

185
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:13,750
She looked at me sadly and said,
"He was run over by a van...

186
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:17,949
...on April 17, 1964,
as we were about to cross the street.

187
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,629
April 17...
It's my birthday.

188
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,549
No way!

189
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,669
That's exactly what I said.

190
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:30,073
So she fills me in on the details.

191
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:34,828
She stepped out with her dog,
but a high vehicle hid the van,

192
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:36,433
which ran over the dog.

193
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:39,708
The bumper hit its neck.
The wound was deep.

194
00:22:39,743 --> 00:22:42,025
The dog died soon after.

195
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,308
You won't believe this...

196
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:45,187
Give me your hand.

197
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,821
I have a scar in the exact same spot.

198
00:23:04,706 --> 00:23:07,906
Come on, is it true or not?

199
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:15,825
Not bad.

200
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:19,745
Where did you hear that one?

201
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,346
You don't believe me?

202
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:31,744
You know Frédéric called me?

203
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:34,024
Simone's better.
The operation was last week.

204
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:37,829
We've hardly been to see her recently.

205
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:41,744
To be honest, we were never very close.
She was always so distant.

206
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:44,144
It's hard to develop a bond.

207
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:45,589
And Frédéric?

208
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,903
He's writing a screenplay.

209
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:47,503
About that?

210
00:23:49,143 --> 00:23:50,748
No, but Maubert bought it.

211
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:52,903
Where's her daughter
while she's in the hospital?

212
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,343
With him and his girlfriend.

213
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:56,583
What's she like?

214
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,783
Nice.

215
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:02,523
It's tough when friends break up,
and you have to take sides.

216
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:04,788
Frédéric's changed a lot.

217
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,741
He's more outgoing
since he met Marianne.

218
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:08,101
Her name is Marianne?

219
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:08,702
Yes.

220
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:11,901
What's the screenplay about?

221
00:24:12,342 --> 00:24:13,941
What screenplay?

222
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:16,822
Isn't Frédéric writing one?

223
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,142
Oh, yeah...
I have no idea.

224
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,181
Expecting anyone else?

225
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,421
No.

226
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,421
I'll go see.

227
00:24:32,461 --> 00:24:35,260
Who can it be at this time?

228
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,065
No idea.

229
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,380
One of his fans no doubt.
The price of fame.

230
00:24:38,415 --> 00:24:43,101
Groupies all over you...

231
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,339
Who's there?

232
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,259
Who's there?

233
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,217
What's this all about?

234
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,537
Show yourself, coward!

235
00:25:36,817 --> 00:25:40,137
Show yourself
and say what you want!

236
00:25:43,815 --> 00:25:44,416
Pathetic!

237
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:52,131
...apparently, it plays through the 15th...

238
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:53,571
- Well?
- Nothing.

239
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,652
- Nothing?
- There was nobody.

240
00:26:58,091 --> 00:26:59,691
There was nobody outside.

241
00:26:59,771 --> 00:27:00,691
OK then...

242
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:05,650
You're spoiling us.
I'll have to diet for 3 weeks.

243
00:27:05,685 --> 00:27:08,350
Why were you out there so long?

244
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:17,810
It's OK. Everything's OK.
There's no problem.

245
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,792
I'm not some jealous wife
who suspects hubby's cheating on her.

246
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:27,092
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

247
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,214
I'm a bit on edge
because in the last few days

248
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,489
we've been getting
anonymous parcels and phone calls.

249
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:35,327
I jump every time the doorbell rings,

250
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,130
and I think it's our asshole stalker.

251
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:39,648
What kind of calls?

252
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:42,609
I don't know how... to describe them.

253
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:44,887
You've been to the police?

254
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:45,488
Of course.

255
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,647
And?

256
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,888
And nothing.
They'll only move when we're attacked.

257
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:53,008
- It's outrageous!
- It's a fact.

258
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:56,769
Dig in before it gets cold.

259
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:00,686
So what was it?

260
00:28:04,456 --> 00:28:05,656
What's up with him?

261
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:13,806
Since Anne has decided
to share our good news with you,

262
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:15,886
I won't hide anything.

263
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:21,526
Are you happy now?

264
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,465
It's not very entertaining.

265
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,885
We receive shots of our house,

266
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:33,290
apparently to show us
we're under surveillance.

267
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:36,445
With all of Anne's comings-and-goings,
mine and Pierrot's...

268
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,804
- You've no idea who's filming and how?
- So far, no.

269
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:41,484
- Let's see.
- Here you go.

270
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:04,443
What's that?

271
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:09,163
The house where I grew up.

272
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,290
Do you need anything else?

273
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:50,420
- No, run along.
- Very well.

274
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,361
Goodnight.

275
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,600
Don't just stand there.

276
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:57,960
Sit down.

277
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,080
No need to look so gloomy.

278
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,119
She's there just in case, that's all.

279
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,637
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

280
00:30:15,158 --> 00:30:18,158
- I didn't know...
- Stop that.

281
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:20,278
You're being ridiculous.

282
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:23,919
Tell me how you're doing.

283
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,398
Fine. I'm fine...

284
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,797
Since we spoke on the phone,
nothing's changed.

285
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:30,398
Pierrot's battling puberty.

286
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:32,763
Anne's busy at her publisher's

287
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:35,197
And me with the TV program.
That's about it.

288
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:40,117
Aunt Julie wrote me a letter.

289
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,877
From Marseille.

290
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:46,721
She never misses your show on TV.

291
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:49,557
She says she envies me
having a son like you.

292
00:30:51,077 --> 00:30:51,877
That's nice.

293
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:55,775
She'll hit 80 this year.

294
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,956
Really?

295
00:31:00,156 --> 00:31:01,236
What's wrong?

296
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,756
You look all pent up.
What is it?

297
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:05,636
Nothing, I'm fine.

298
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:09,235
I don't enjoy seeing you so unwell.

299
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,795
What do you mean, "unwell?"

300
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:15,239
For my age, I'm very well!

301
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:19,275
Don't bother me
with nonsense like that.

302
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,554
Isn't it lonely, if you can't go out?

303
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,474
Why?

304
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:30,274
Are you less lonely
because you can sit in the garden?

305
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:34,793
Do you feel less lonely in the Metro
than at home?

306
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:37,033
Well then!

307
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:40,993
Anyway, I have my family friend...

308
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:44,594
With remote control.

309
00:31:45,274 --> 00:31:48,352
Whenever they annoy me,
I just shut them up.

310
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:56,472
I miss not hearing the piano.

311
00:31:57,032 --> 00:31:59,312
Ever since your dad died.

312
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:02,272
Do you still play?

313
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,272
No.
I don't have time, you know.

314
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:07,391
- Pity.
- Yes.

315
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:12,591
And Pierrot, is he gifted?

316
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:15,950
He's not interested.
He prefers to hang out.

317
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:19,030
He's 12 now, isn't he?

318
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,030
What brings you down here?

319
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:30,349
I'm going to Aix for a special
on François Weyergans.

320
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:33,129
He's publishing a new novel,
his first in ages.

321
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:34,691
Really?

322
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:38,129
You know who I had a dream about?

323
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,350
Majid

324
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,348
Who's Majid?

325
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:43,868
You know! Majid!

326
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:45,549
You've lost me.

327
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:48,429
Majid! Hashem's son.

328
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:51,629
The kid you planned to adopt!

329
00:32:51,828 --> 00:32:52,428
I see.

330
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:55,029
Odd, isn't it?

331
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:56,747
What's odd?

332
00:32:56,828 --> 00:32:58,348
After all those years.

333
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:01,708
It's not all that odd.

334
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,829
I often dream of my childhood.

335
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:06,828
It comes with age.

336
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:09,226
Sure, but I'm not that old.

337
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:12,467
It comes faster than you think.

338
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:16,547
Do you ever think about him?

339
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:18,667
About whom?

340
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:20,507
Majid.

341
00:33:21,227 --> 00:33:22,627
- No.
- How come?

342
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:25,387
"How come?"

343
00:33:26,146 --> 00:33:28,631
How come
you don't think about him ever?

344
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,390
It was a big deal
for you and Dad at the time.

345
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:36,985
It was a long time ago.
And it's not a happy memory.

346
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,865
As you know only too well.

347
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,466
Yeah.

348
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:44,671
What did you dream?

349
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:47,146
Stupid stuff,
but it brought him back to mind.

350
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,526
I'd forgotten all about him.

351
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:52,744
What does Anne do?

352
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:57,144
She's well. She still works
for the same publishers.

353
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,022
She runs her own schedule.

354
00:33:59,057 --> 00:34:00,865
Her boss is a friend of ours.

355
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,065
- Very handy.
- Yes.

356
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,463
I don't know what more I can tell you.
We hardly see each other

357
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:11,040
and when we do,
I've nothing special to tell you.

358
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:14,583
Mostly, we chug along.
No great highs or lows.

359
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:16,863
I'm fine. Anne's fine.

360
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:18,828
Pierrot's fine.

361
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:21,988
As far as I can tell, at least.

362
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:25,703
We're all very busy
and that's about it.

363
00:34:26,102 --> 00:34:28,582
But I get the feeling you're not fine.

364
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:31,581
You seem strange, Georges.

365
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:36,422
Listening to you,
I'm worried about you.

366
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:39,942
What's going on?

367
00:34:40,502 --> 00:34:41,222
What do you mean?

368
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:43,822
Come on...

369
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,220
No, seriously?

370
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,826
When are you leaving?

371
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:56,581
Tomorrow morning.
I have to be in Aix by 12.

372
00:34:57,621 --> 00:35:00,220
You'll have to leave early then.

373
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:00,820
Yes.

374
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:06,294
Shall I ask Mme Arnaud
to prepare breakfast for us?

375
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,100
You're up that early?

376
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:13,899
I don't sleep much now.

377
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,739
That's one of the benefits of old age.

378
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,020
- I'm off to bed. I'm dead tired.
- Goodnight.

379
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:29,298
Can I get you something?
You need anything?

380
00:35:29,618 --> 00:35:30,738
No, I'm fine.

381
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,738
I have all I need.
Goodnight.

382
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,218
Goodnight, Mom.

383
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:40,018
What time for breakfast?

384
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:41,617
- 7 o'clock?
- OK.

385
00:35:42,498 --> 00:35:45,217
- Shall I tell her?
- Yes.

386
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,057
Goodnight.

387
00:35:48,297 --> 00:35:49,818
- Light off?
- No.

388
00:35:55,577 --> 00:35:57,262
He's not a baby anymore.

389
00:35:57,297 --> 00:35:59,817
I like not having him around some days.

390
00:35:59,852 --> 00:36:02,217
He can be a little macho prick.

391
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:06,655
Yes, I wonder who he gets it from.

392
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:10,575
When will you be home?

393
00:36:11,415 --> 00:36:13,295
Can't you pick him up at school?

394
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,696
I can't tomorrow.

395
00:36:14,815 --> 00:36:17,016
We have to pack up here.

396
00:36:17,296 --> 00:36:20,700
It was our last launch
in this fancy location.

397
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:23,135
Yes, there are a lot of people.
It's swarming, in fact.

398
00:36:27,174 --> 00:36:28,374
Yes, I'll tell him.

399
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:32,695
Love you too.

400
00:38:14,648 --> 00:38:16,449
Morning, mom.

401
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:26,443
There was a street sign.

402
00:39:46,922 --> 00:39:48,562
I can't make it out.

403
00:39:48,597 --> 00:39:49,162
Le...

404
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:51,442
...nin, no?

405
00:39:53,082 --> 00:39:56,561
- Avenue Lenin?
- Yes, Avenue Lenin.

406
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:57,805
But where?

407
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,441
Do you have the map?

408
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
Hold on.

409
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,720
Romain... Romainville.

410
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,200
Could be Romainville.
See if there's an Avenue Lenin.

411
00:40:19,235 --> 00:40:19,800
Hold on.

412
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,800
Found it!

413
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,600
Near Mairie des Lilas Metro station.
Line 11.

414
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,159
Right there.

415
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,278
So what are you going to do?

416
00:40:35,313 --> 00:40:36,399
Go over there.

417
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,998
It's near Guillaume's place.

418
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,563
- And?
- Nothing, I'll go over...

419
00:40:42,598 --> 00:40:45,119
knock on the door,
and see what happens...

420
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:48,043
As simple as that?

421
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,958
As simple as that.
Got a better idea?

422
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,683
Why not the police?

423
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:55,597
We got the hallway, the street.
You should go with a cop.

424
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:57,602
They can do that much, no?

425
00:40:57,637 --> 00:41:00,157
What if it's a bluff, a practical joke?

426
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:01,797
You think so? Seriously?

427
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,796
What does the tape show?

428
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:08,557
A street and a low-rent hallway.
They'll just tell me...

429
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:11,117
"Try knocking on the door

430
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:15,716
"and if someone tries to kill you
come see us again."

431
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:18,316
Who would know
the house where you grew up?

432
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:20,636
I don't know.

433
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:25,156
Do you recognize the building?

434
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:25,755
No.

435
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,236
Right, well...

436
00:41:31,116 --> 00:41:33,194
we'll hire a private detective.

437
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,874
You watch too many crime shows.

438
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,595
You're impossible to talk to.
Do it your way.

439
00:41:42,074 --> 00:41:44,354
- I have a hunch.
- What?

440
00:41:44,389 --> 00:41:46,634
I think I know who it is.

441
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:50,474
You know who it is?

442
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:53,073
<i>I think I know.</i>

443
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:54,993
So?

444
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,393
So I have to make sure.

445
00:42:00,032 --> 00:42:02,518
Whoa, what's wrong with you?

446
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,513
Maybe you could share
your solitary wisdom.

447
00:42:05,548 --> 00:42:07,513
This concerns me too, you know?

448
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:12,992
I can't tell you because I don't know.

449
00:42:13,027 --> 00:42:14,792
It's just a hunch.

450
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:18,072
You can't tell me about it?

451
00:42:20,072 --> 00:42:20,672
Non.

452
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:27,031
Wow...

453
00:42:27,672 --> 00:42:29,192
I don't know what I...

454
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:31,910
Do you realize what you're saying?

455
00:42:31,945 --> 00:42:33,591
Please, it's not what you think.

456
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:35,111
And what do I think?

457
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:37,311
Will you cut it out?

458
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,556
It's a vague hunch.

459
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:41,310
I don't want to alarm anyone
before I know more.

460
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:42,748
It is not your concern.

461
00:42:42,783 --> 00:42:44,151
It's not my concern?

462
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:46,631
I guess I dreamt it all!

463
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:53,069
I thought it was my concern
being terrorized by anonymous calls

464
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,034
and these fucking videos!

465
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:57,990
Being almost too scared to go out!

466
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,835
Not my concern
to lie awake all night

467
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,110
worrying about Pierrot and you
and all this crap?

468
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:05,075
If it's not my concern

469
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:07,229
then it's business as usual.
Would you like something to eat?

470
00:43:07,264 --> 00:43:09,029
Or maybe I can get you a drink?

471
00:43:10,108 --> 00:43:11,948
Anne, please, if I had known...

472
00:43:11,983 --> 00:43:13,109
What would you have done?

473
00:43:13,144 --> 00:43:15,309
Kept your trap shut?

474
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:16,433
Please...

475
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,869
Do you realize the bullshit you're talking?

476
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:22,148
You've never heard of trust?

477
00:43:22,307 --> 00:43:25,948
You realize
you're doing exactly what this guy wants?

478
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:28,165
He wants to throw our lives upside down.

479
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,347
You're reacting exactly as he wants.

480
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:31,865
Can't you just trust me?

481
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,348
I have to trust you?

482
00:43:33,746 --> 00:43:36,632
Why not the other way around for once?

483
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,667
How about you trust me?
Who's refusing to give trust here?

484
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:43,347
Imagine the shoe's on the other foot.

485
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:45,192
Imagine I say...

486
00:43:45,227 --> 00:43:48,106
"I have an idea who's terrorizing us
but I can't tell you."

487
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:49,105
Great, no?

488
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:53,146
That's your idea of a working relationship

489
00:43:53,181 --> 00:43:56,066
"based on mutual trust?"

490
00:43:59,266 --> 00:44:01,519
You should hear yourself.

491
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:57,101
Just a second!

492
00:44:58,502 --> 00:44:59,301
I'm coming!

493
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:10,300
Sorry, I was in the middle of...

494
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:15,781
Look who it is!

495
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,061
Who are you?

496
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:21,981
You wanna come in?

497
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:36,939
After you.

498
00:45:52,378 --> 00:45:53,098
Have a seat.

499
00:45:58,379 --> 00:45:59,623
I was making lunch.

500
00:45:59,658 --> 00:46:01,178
What do you want from me?

501
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:04,897
What do I want? Me?

502
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:06,177
Do you want money?

503
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:07,777
Money?

504
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,417
What then?

505
00:46:12,617 --> 00:46:16,617
Do you mind telling me
how you found me?

506
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:24,136
It's a game, is that it?

507
00:46:24,256 --> 00:46:25,376
I don't want to play.

508
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:26,333
I've grown up.

509
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:27,256
I see that.

510
00:46:28,016 --> 00:46:30,616
So, what's the point of your actions?

511
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:32,020
What actions?

512
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,456
Are you making fun of me?

513
00:46:35,336 --> 00:46:38,736
Do you mind telling me why you're here?

514
00:46:39,616 --> 00:46:42,296
How did you find me?

515
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:51,895
What's this?

516
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,175
Don't play dumb.

517
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:05,974
Well?

518
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:17,253
Sit down, please.

519
00:47:26,772 --> 00:47:30,072
You may not believe I wasn't expecting you.
But it's true.

520
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,293
You're the last person
I would expect at my door.

521
00:47:36,532 --> 00:47:40,191
Right. I'll play along
to see where it gets us.

522
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:43,698
I could also report you
to the police quite simply.

523
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:47,171
So, you had no idea
and you're surprised to see me.

524
00:47:48,051 --> 00:47:49,936
Who do you think drew me here?

525
00:47:49,971 --> 00:47:52,771
Who's been terrorizing my family for weeks?

526
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:53,650
I don't know.

527
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,051
Why do you talk
like we're strangers?

528
00:47:59,571 --> 00:48:01,490
You wouldn't have recognized me, huh?

529
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:05,010
Out in the street,
you'd have walked right past me.

530
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:09,774
At first, I wasn't sure either.

531
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:13,089
When I tuned into your show
by chance

532
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,930
a few years ago...

533
00:48:15,689 --> 00:48:18,669
The show
with the two chairs stuck together...

534
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:21,648
You sat up close to your guests,
face to face...

535
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:26,174
I wasn't sure either.

536
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:29,209
I just had a nasty feeling in my gut.

537
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,608
Weird, no?

538
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:36,208
I felt nauseous
and I didn't know why.

539
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:42,968
When your name finally came up,
I began to understand.

540
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,568
And then... the nose.

541
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:56,577
How did you wind up on TV?
You didn't take over the estate?

542
00:48:58,567 --> 00:48:59,885
Tell me what you want.

543
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:01,966
Nothing.

544
00:49:02,926 --> 00:49:03,726
Nothing.

545
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:07,726
What could I want from you?
What do you imagine?

546
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:08,726
Money?

547
00:49:11,206 --> 00:49:15,726
You barge in here
accusing me of trying to blackmail you.

548
00:49:18,285 --> 00:49:20,485
You haven't changed.

549
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,885
What could I blackmail you with?

550
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,964
Who sent me the tapes?

551
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:27,644
The tapes?

552
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:35,165
Strange. I haven't gotten
into a fight since I was a child.

553
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,644
I find it repugnant.

554
00:49:40,283 --> 00:49:41,283
And right now...

555
00:49:42,603 --> 00:49:44,363
if you don't stop this stupid game...

556
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:45,963
You'll kick my ass?

557
00:49:47,163 --> 00:49:48,443
That shouldn't be hard.

558
00:49:48,924 --> 00:49:52,204
You're a lot bigger than the last time.

559
00:49:52,564 --> 00:49:57,562
Kicking my ass
won't leave you any wiser about me.

560
00:49:57,802 --> 00:50:01,262
Even if you beat me to death.

561
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:04,687
But you're too refined for that.

562
00:50:04,722 --> 00:50:08,321
Above all, you have too much to lose.

563
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:10,861
What are you saying?

564
00:50:10,896 --> 00:50:12,322
That's not true?

565
00:50:13,522 --> 00:50:14,522
I think it is.

566
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:20,161
What wouldn't we do
not to lose what's ours?

567
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:27,001
You were older and stronger than me.

568
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:28,801
I had no choice.

569
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:30,681
Right, then.

570
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,960
Your mom's sick?

571
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,119
Where do you get that from?

572
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,480
It's not hard to guess, is it?

573
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,440
What do you want? Revenge?

574
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:53,159
She was a very kind lady.

575
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,239
I was very grateful to her, you know.

576
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:00,999
To your father, too.

577
00:51:01,638 --> 00:51:03,238
I'm going to leave now.

578
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:06,959
If you try again to interfere in my life,

579
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:07,963
to scare my family

580
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,418
or to hurt me in any way

581
00:51:09,453 --> 00:51:10,838
you'll regret it, I swear.

582
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,439
You're threatening me?

583
00:51:12,959 --> 00:51:14,039
Yes, I'm threatening you.

584
00:51:15,118 --> 00:51:16,637
Believe me, I mean it.

585
00:51:16,672 --> 00:51:17,637
I believe you.

586
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:21,077
But you don't believe me.

587
00:51:21,317 --> 00:51:23,637
I didn't want anything from you.

588
00:51:24,477 --> 00:51:27,557
And I never sent you a tape
or anything else.

589
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:31,956
Not this either.

590
00:51:37,116 --> 00:51:39,796
I'm glad you came.

591
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,191
Yes, hello

592
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:08,950
This is Georges Laurent.
Could I speak to my wife?

593
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:10,111
Thank you.

594
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,190
Hi, it's me.

595
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:18,350
I went there.
Nobody was in.

596
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,630
No, it was just a door like any other.

597
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,670
It was locked.

598
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,590
I did.

599
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:32,033
He said it was unoccupied.

600
00:53:32,068 --> 00:53:39,318
It must be a storeroom
or something like that.

601
00:54:14,325 --> 00:54:16,525
<i>She was a very kind lady.</i>

602
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:20,205
<i>I was very grateful to her, you know.</i>

603
00:54:20,885 --> 00:54:23,685
<i>To your father, too.</i>

604
00:54:23,725 --> 00:54:25,325
<i>I'm going to leave now,
but you can be sure of something.</i>

605
00:54:26,204 --> 00:54:31,202
<i>If you try again to interfere in my life,</i>

606
00:54:31,363 --> 00:54:32,608
<i>to scare my family</i>

607
00:54:32,643 --> 00:54:34,023
<i>or to hurt me in any way,</i>

608
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:35,270
<i>you'll regret it, I swear.</i>

609
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,483
<i>You're threatening me?</i>

610
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:37,723
<i>Yes, I'm threatening you.</i>

611
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,442
<i>Believe me, I mean it.</i>

612
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:41,442
<i>I believe you.</i>

613
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:44,442
<i>But you don't believe me.</i>

614
00:54:44,722 --> 00:54:47,001
<i>I didn't want anything from you.</i>

615
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,920
<i>And I never sent you a tape
or anything else.</i>

616
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,399
<i>Not this either.</i>

617
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:02,359
<i>I'm glad you came.</i>

618
00:55:59,348 --> 00:56:00,847
That's it.

619
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,579
The tape runs for another hour
if you want to watch how he feels.

620
00:56:19,866 --> 00:56:20,866
I'm sorry.

621
00:56:20,901 --> 00:56:21,866
What for?

622
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:27,664
What now?

623
00:56:30,544 --> 00:56:33,823
I know. It was dumb of me to lie to you.
I apologize.

624
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:35,143
I don't get it.

625
00:56:35,343 --> 00:56:36,268
I'm sorry!

626
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:39,628
I don't get how you see things.

627
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:43,142
You say "sorry" and just like that
everything's okay, right?

628
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:46,266
Am I supposed to beg?
What did I do that's so awful?

629
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:50,400
I only lied to spare you more stress.
Has the world stopped spinning?

630
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:54,500
I'm sorry.

631
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,698
I suspected it was him. Not at first
but after the tape of Mom's house.

632
00:57:03,733 --> 00:57:06,698
I didn't want you to deal with this.

633
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:11,182
His parents worked for us.

634
00:57:11,217 --> 00:57:15,137
Dad liked them.
They must have been good workers.

635
00:57:16,337 --> 00:57:21,976
In October '61, the FLN called
all Algerians to a demonstration in Paris.

636
00:57:22,011 --> 00:57:24,454
October 17, 1961.
Enough said.

637
00:57:25,494 --> 00:57:27,379
Papon. The police massacre.

638
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:29,595
They drowned
about 200 Arabs in the Seine

639
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:33,655
including Majid's parents most likely.

640
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,773
They never came back.

641
00:57:36,294 --> 00:57:38,973
Dad went to Paris
to look for them.

642
00:57:39,174 --> 00:57:43,173
They said he should be glad
to be rid of a couple of jigaboos.

643
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,292
And then?

644
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:48,812
And then...

645
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:53,011
My parents decided to adopt the boy.

646
00:57:53,046 --> 00:57:54,491
I don't know why.

647
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:00,170
They felt responsible in some way.

648
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,050
So...

649
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,809
It bothered me.
I didn't want him in our house.

650
00:58:04,844 --> 00:58:05,773
He had his own room.

651
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:09,048
I had to share, you see.
I was 6!

652
00:58:12,728 --> 00:58:14,128
So what did you do?

653
00:58:15,128 --> 00:58:15,728
Nothing...

654
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:18,647
I told lies about him.

655
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:20,886
You told lies about him?

656
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:24,725
That's all?

657
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:29,765
That's why he wants revenge?

658
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,164
Apparently.

659
00:58:36,765 --> 00:58:37,964
You threatened him.

660
00:58:39,604 --> 00:58:41,003
Not a particularly intelligent move.

661
00:58:41,038 --> 00:58:42,402
Not particularly intelligent?

662
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:46,202
Stupid. I know.
I was out of my depth.

663
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:50,602
I don't think he's lying.

664
00:58:50,637 --> 00:58:51,282
What do you mean?

665
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:53,581
He was genuinely surprised.

666
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:55,282
- But the tape?
- Which one?

667
00:58:55,317 --> 00:58:57,126
You think it's staged?

668
00:58:57,161 --> 00:59:00,244
He'd have to be awfully cunning.

669
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:02,799
Who else could it be?
I can't read his mind.

670
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:05,879
Why send this thing to us?

671
00:59:05,919 --> 00:59:08,679
To keep me informed.
Unlike you.

672
00:59:08,714 --> 00:59:10,119
So who sent the other tapes?

673
00:59:10,154 --> 00:59:11,918
How should I know?

674
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:19,637
What kind of lies did you tell?

675
00:59:19,672 --> 00:59:20,917
I can't remember.

676
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:24,356
The usual stuff kids lie about.

677
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:27,115
Things you make up. Stupid stuff.

678
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:30,840
Well?

679
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:31,476
Well what?

680
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:34,000
Stop acting like an idiot!

681
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:36,475
If you'd accused him of stealing a teddy bear,

682
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,914
he wouldn't want revenge 40 years later.

683
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,593
I don't remember!

684
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:45,193
You don't want to tell me, you mean?

685
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:47,393
Ferchrissakes, what more do you want!?

686
00:59:47,673 --> 00:59:49,037
I have no idea anymore.

687
00:59:49,072 --> 00:59:53,272
<i>Do you remember stupid stuff you did
when you were 6?</i>

688
00:59:57,512 --> 00:59:59,990
What happened to him?

689
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,795
He was sent away.
He was sick.

690
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,729
To a hospital, or a children's home,
I don't know.

691
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:09,593
One day he was gone,
and I was glad.

692
01:00:09,628 --> 01:00:12,078
And then I forgot all about it.
That's natural, no?

693
01:00:15,709 --> 01:00:17,188
And your parents?

694
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,666
Forgot it too, I suppose.

695
01:00:19,946 --> 01:00:22,786
It was only an interlude
of a few months.

696
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:23,506
An interlude?

697
01:00:24,026 --> 01:00:25,507
What should I call it?
A tragedy?

698
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:29,026
Maybe it was a tragedy. I don't know.

699
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:30,746
I don't feel responsible for it.

700
01:00:30,781 --> 01:00:32,390
Why should I?

701
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:34,945
It's all so absurd.

702
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:38,984
You mentioned it to your mother
when you visited?

703
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:39,584
Sure.

704
01:00:40,384 --> 01:00:43,864
Ah, I see there's at least someone you trust.

705
01:00:43,899 --> 01:00:45,543
Jesus! She knows about him already.

706
01:00:45,578 --> 01:00:48,742
I didn't mention the tapes.

707
01:00:48,823 --> 01:00:50,303
Well, what did she say?

708
01:00:51,263 --> 01:00:51,862
Nothing.

709
01:00:54,463 --> 01:00:57,101
She's getting old.
She can't remember.

710
01:00:57,136 --> 01:00:59,180
Or doesn't want to.
I don't know.

711
01:00:59,215 --> 01:01:01,660
It's unpleasant for her.

712
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,737
Thanks for coming so quickly.
How is it going?

713
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:26,621
Great thanks. And you?

714
01:01:26,656 --> 01:01:29,456
Busy as always,
you know what it's like.

715
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:31,217
Please, take a seat.

716
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:37,375
How's your wife?
I haven't seen her for ages.

717
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:38,540
She's very well.

718
01:01:38,575 --> 01:01:43,333
They just published a translation of
Pereira's book on globalization.

719
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:45,019
She fought for it, and it's a bit hit.

720
01:01:45,054 --> 01:01:48,613
Great, I must buy it, but you know how it is. One can never find the time.

721
01:01:48,813 --> 01:01:50,254
Please give her my regards.

722
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:51,173
Of course. Thank you.

723
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:52,973
Coffee?

724
01:01:53,134 --> 01:01:54,611
No, thanks. I've already too much today.

725
01:01:58,571 --> 01:02:01,777
I'll get right to it.
You probably think I asked you up

726
01:02:01,812 --> 01:02:05,137
to talk about the concept
for your new show.

727
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:07,975
That'll have to wait.

728
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:11,530
The Head of Programming
won't decide anything before summer.

729
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:13,767
The decision was due by May 15.

730
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:15,933
I know, but what can I say?

731
01:02:15,968 --> 01:02:19,818
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
Public TV even more so.

732
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:23,967
I wouldn't worry.
We always bring them around, don't we?

733
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:27,287
- May God hear you!
- Sadly, polytheism reigns here.

734
01:02:27,322 --> 01:02:29,967
But as I said, don't worry.
It'll all work out.

735
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:32,367
With your prestige and your loyal viewership!

736
01:02:32,402 --> 01:02:33,485
Yeah, sure.

737
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:38,465
Anyway... I asked you up
because of a silly thing

738
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,045
that to be honest makes me
a little uncomfortable.

739
01:02:42,605 --> 01:02:45,810
Yesterday,
my secretary left a tape on my desk.

740
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,603
It was addressed to me
but without a note.

741
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:51,492
Usually, she wouldn't even show me
something like that.

742
01:02:51,527 --> 01:02:54,141
She'd just take a quick look
and toss it in the trash.

743
01:02:54,723 --> 01:02:58,682
I've no interest in the crap
your fan club sends in.

744
01:02:58,717 --> 01:03:00,209
But she thought I should see this.

745
01:03:00,962 --> 01:03:04,480
The tape shows you
having a private conversation

746
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:06,481
with a man in a kind of flat.

747
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:11,360
The subject isn't apparent
plus I didn't want to be indiscreet.

748
01:03:11,395 --> 01:03:13,906
But you clearly had no idea
you were being filmed.

749
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,918
I wanted to ask you
if you knew what it was.

750
01:03:17,953 --> 01:03:20,038
And, if you do, what you think.

751
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:24,487
I'm sorry you got dragged into this.

752
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:27,491
The guy's the son of Algerian farmhands

753
01:03:27,526 --> 01:03:29,704
who worked for my parents around 1960.

754
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:33,881
He has a pathological hatred
of my family

755
01:03:33,916 --> 01:03:36,836
and he tries to hurt me with this stuff.
Sorry.

756
01:03:37,955 --> 01:03:41,876
That's okay.
It can't be very pleasant for you.

757
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:43,319
You've been to the police?

758
01:03:43,354 --> 01:03:47,994
Sure, but they course won't do anything,
as long as nothing "dramatic" happens.

759
01:03:48,029 --> 01:03:50,933
Apparently,
this guy's out to wreck your career.

760
01:03:51,873 --> 01:03:53,953
God knows where else he sent the tape.

761
01:03:53,988 --> 01:03:54,953
That's true.

762
01:03:59,152 --> 01:04:01,832
Why is he so bitter?

763
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:05,842
Sorry to pry
but he didn't appear very aggressive.

764
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:09,796
Yes, I know.
I'm the aggressive one on the tape.

765
01:04:09,831 --> 01:04:14,007
My visit was the consequence
of his campaign of terror.

766
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:17,439
My wife and I
are very worried naturally.

767
01:04:17,709 --> 01:04:18,829
I imagine.

768
01:04:19,549 --> 01:04:22,209
You have no idea what's driving him?

769
01:04:23,548 --> 01:04:24,428
None at all.

770
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,747
Apparently, he's convinced
my family and I mistreated him.

771
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:32,266
In fact, the last time I saw him,
I was 6. He's crazy.

772
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:38,066
You have my sympathy.
This is awful.

773
01:04:38,386 --> 01:04:41,470
I hope it's resolved soon.

774
01:04:41,505 --> 01:04:44,405
It would be unfortunate
if news of this leaked out.

775
01:04:46,025 --> 01:04:49,045
I know.
I'll put a lawyer on the case.

776
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:51,783
Do it. Good idea.

777
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:56,063
Don't worry about the new show.
I'll stay on top of it.

778
01:04:56,098 --> 01:04:56,983
Great, thanks.

779
01:04:57,663 --> 01:04:59,743
Not at all. It's my fight too.
You know how highly I think of you.

780
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:01,823
Thank you.
Can I have the tape?

781
01:05:01,858 --> 01:05:02,503
The tape?

782
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:06,147
Ah, the tape.
I destroyed it immediately.

783
01:05:06,182 --> 01:05:07,782
I didn't want it
to fall into the wrong hands.

784
01:05:07,817 --> 01:05:08,780
I see.

785
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:11,127
You'd have done the same, no?

786
01:06:06,732 --> 01:06:07,451
Open up.

787
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:11,531
Open up!

788
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,890
Come on, open up!

789
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,770
Open the damn door!

790
01:06:28,516 --> 01:06:29,821
What do you think
he should have done?

791
01:06:29,968 --> 01:06:31,368
What should he have done?

792
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:33,448
Are you kidding?

793
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:37,288
You'd have bullshitted Mathilde like that?

794
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,846
People talk to each other, don't they?

795
01:06:44,926 --> 01:06:46,125
Calm down.

796
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:50,165
Calm down.
It's okay.

797
01:06:51,405 --> 01:06:52,604
Calm down.

798
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:20,360
Time to get back to the office.

799
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:21,560
Yes.

800
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:27,119
<i>But the Governor of Nassiriyah province,
an Italian appointed by the Americans</i>

801
01:07:27,154 --> 01:07:29,123
<i>Barbara Contini,</i>

802
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:31,643
<i>demands greater openness
on the subject.</i>

803
01:07:31,678 --> 01:07:37,677
<i>The Italians come under British command
as the official occupying power.</i>

804
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:44,076
<i>It's vital all coalition countries
that have joined in this mission</i>

805
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:48,075
<i>operate under
the same rules of engagement.</i>

806
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:55,014
<i>This will result in greater homogeneity
and better coordination.</i>

807
01:07:58,394 --> 01:08:02,034
<i>Ultimately, Italian President Ciampi...</i>

808
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:03,433
About time.

809
01:08:04,432 --> 01:08:06,632
Where have you been?

810
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,957
I ate out with Pierre.

811
01:08:09,992 --> 01:08:12,651
Without telling me?
Why switch off your cell phone?

812
01:08:12,712 --> 01:08:13,313
Why?

813
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:17,436
Do you tell me everything you do?

814
01:08:17,471 --> 01:08:20,251
- Let's not start that again.
- Exactly.

815
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,869
Pierrot's already in bed?

816
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,914
I thought he was with you.

817
01:08:27,949 --> 01:08:30,950
With me?
You know I was at work, no?

818
01:08:34,269 --> 01:08:37,066
He was going over to Yves'
after school.

819
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:40,348
You have his number?

820
01:08:45,546 --> 01:08:48,678
He was going
to swim practice at 5 with Yves

821
01:08:49,026 --> 01:08:52,026
and Yves' dad was picking them up.

822
01:09:09,902 --> 01:09:12,467
Hello, this is Anne Laurent.

823
01:09:12,502 --> 01:09:15,182
I wanted to ask if you've seen Pierrot.

824
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,299
Really?

825
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,900
Did he say anything?

826
01:09:29,059 --> 01:09:31,860
Yes, if you don't mind,
can I talk to him in person?

827
01:09:36,419 --> 01:09:37,943
Hi, Yves.

828
01:09:37,978 --> 01:09:41,257
Did Pierrot tell you where he was going?

829
01:09:42,697 --> 01:09:43,897
No, that's the point.

830
01:09:50,536 --> 01:09:52,335
Were you doing anything after?

831
01:09:54,575 --> 01:09:56,376
Did you have a fight?

832
01:09:57,055 --> 01:09:59,102
No, I don't know...
Okay, I see.

833
01:09:59,374 --> 01:10:01,414
If you hear anything,
can you give us a call?

834
01:10:01,449 --> 01:10:03,014
You have our number?

835
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:06,693
Okay, thank you.
Goodbye.

836
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:10,133
He left Yves' house around 6:30.

837
01:10:10,613 --> 01:10:14,213
He said he'd be away with us
for the Ascension weekend.

838
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:21,051
I'll go look in his room.

839
01:11:03,524 --> 01:11:04,124
Well?

840
01:11:06,124 --> 01:11:07,244
I don't know.

841
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,878
We have to call the police.

842
01:11:46,078 --> 01:11:48,198
What if something's happened to him?

843
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:49,718
- What?
- I don't know.

844
01:11:49,798 --> 01:11:52,196
What if he's been hit by a car or...

845
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:42,509
Open up, Police!

846
01:12:45,748 --> 01:12:46,667
Open up!

847
01:12:47,428 --> 01:12:48,027
Yes?

848
01:12:50,308 --> 01:12:52,108
- What's going on?
- Where's the boy?

849
01:12:52,143 --> 01:12:53,045
What boy?

850
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:53,946
Is that him?

851
01:12:58,656 --> 01:12:59,655
Any sign of him?

852
01:13:03,305 --> 01:13:05,424
I'm going with them to the station.

853
01:13:07,185 --> 01:13:08,505
I have no idea.

854
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:11,865
He has a son.

855
01:13:13,703 --> 01:13:16,253
It must have been him
who made the tapes.

856
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:21,320
They claim they don't even know
who Pierrot is.

857
01:13:24,302 --> 01:13:26,091
No, they only looked for Pierrot.

858
01:13:26,391 --> 01:13:28,991
They're investigating kidnapping,
not the tapes.

859
01:13:31,221 --> 01:13:32,900
Did anyone call?

860
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,422
I was just asking, you never know.

861
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,229
I have to go.
Call me if there's any news.

862
01:13:41,739 --> 01:13:43,178
Of course.

863
01:14:43,089 --> 01:14:44,889
You'd better go home now.

864
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:48,214
You have an early flight tomorrow...

865
01:14:48,249 --> 01:14:51,012
Don't worry. I packed yesterday.
You know me...

866
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:54,807
You've been really sweet
but I prefer to be alone now.

867
01:14:54,842 --> 01:14:56,847
On your own,
you'll imagine the worst.

868
01:14:56,882 --> 01:14:57,527
Pierre...

869
01:14:58,167 --> 01:14:59,687
Come on, let's on.

870
01:15:02,486 --> 01:15:04,086
If you need anything, just call.

871
01:15:06,726 --> 01:15:08,406
- Promise?
- Yes.

872
01:15:18,763 --> 01:15:20,283
You can call any time.

873
01:15:20,318 --> 01:15:21,604
Thanks, I know.

874
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:24,083
Corsica isn't another planet.

875
01:15:24,118 --> 01:15:24,683
See you, my dear.

876
01:15:26,683 --> 01:15:28,682
- Well?
- No news.

877
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:33,721
It probably wasn't an accident.
No reports from the hospitals.

878
01:15:33,756 --> 01:15:34,520
And the two guys?

879
01:15:34,801 --> 01:15:37,201
They claim they don't know him.

880
01:15:37,236 --> 01:15:38,498
What about the tapes?

881
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:39,725
They both deny it.

882
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,680
Look, just drop it.
The police aren't interested...

883
01:15:42,715 --> 01:15:43,844
...in anything other than kidnapping.

884
01:15:43,879 --> 01:15:48,279
For the tapes, we need proof.
They'll look into it, but
There's a procedure to be followed.

885
01:15:48,518 --> 01:15:50,598
There's a procedure to be followed.
File a report, lawyer

886
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:52,999
The cops don't care if it's linked.

887
01:15:53,034 --> 01:15:54,318
So they released them?

888
01:15:54,478 --> 01:15:56,082
Don't you want to come in?

889
01:15:56,117 --> 01:15:57,742
- We're just leaving.
- We'd be in the way.

890
01:15:57,777 --> 01:15:59,841
Nonsense!
Come on in...

891
01:15:59,876 --> 01:16:04,877
I asked them to go. I was exhausted
and wanted to be alone.

892
01:16:05,356 --> 01:16:06,557
I'm sorry.

893
01:16:08,795 --> 01:16:12,635
All this is...
It makes me sick.

894
01:16:13,314 --> 01:16:15,034
No, they kept them in custody.

895
01:16:15,635 --> 01:16:19,304
The kid started yelling.
So they locked him up.

896
01:16:19,339 --> 01:16:22,058
That got his dad started...

897
01:16:22,059 --> 01:16:25,027
So now they're both in the cage
for the night.

898
01:16:25,313 --> 01:16:27,153
- And then?
- Then they'll let them go.

899
01:16:27,188 --> 01:16:29,476
If there's no proof, they have to.

900
01:16:29,477 --> 01:16:31,677
There's suspicion, nothing more.

901
01:16:32,472 --> 01:16:34,152
What will you do now?

902
01:16:34,552 --> 01:16:38,723
Now, I'm going to grab some food.
I haven't eaten all day.

903
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,657
What the hell got into you?

904
01:18:11,216 --> 01:18:12,660
I'm sorry.

905
01:18:12,695 --> 01:18:15,896
Anne Laurent...
Thank you very much.

906
01:18:15,931 --> 01:18:17,140
Come in, please.

907
01:18:17,175 --> 01:18:19,900
No, thanks. I'm badly parked.

908
01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:23,974
I called my husband,
who's also delighted and says thank you.

909
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:25,551
It's the least I could do.

910
01:18:25,586 --> 01:18:26,758
Please come in.

911
01:18:26,793 --> 01:18:30,212
No, I have to go.
I just wanted to be sure he really came home.

912
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:30,933
What do you mean?

913
01:18:31,733 --> 01:18:33,893
I owe you an apology. I...

914
01:18:33,928 --> 01:18:34,972
Whatever for?

915
01:18:35,172 --> 01:18:37,452
I work nights at the hospital.

916
01:18:37,487 --> 01:18:39,457
So I'm not always around.

917
01:18:39,492 --> 01:18:44,490
When François has friends over...
Well, we're pretty laidback.

918
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:48,170
I didn't know your son hadn't called.
I got in at 7...

919
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:51,172
Oh, it's okay.
It's not your fault if...

920
01:18:52,089 --> 01:18:53,369
You're sure you won't come in?

921
01:18:53,404 --> 01:18:54,769
Thank you, no.

922
01:18:55,809 --> 01:18:59,556
I don't know how...
to express my gratitude.

923
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:03,302
It's nothing.
I'm sorry you had such a fright.

924
01:19:06,327 --> 01:19:07,526
Goodbye.

925
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:09,146
Thanks again.

926
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:33,243
Why don't you say anything?

927
01:19:35,082 --> 01:19:37,162
What's there to say?

928
01:19:38,043 --> 01:19:38,762
That's true.

929
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,199
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

930
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,439
Come on!

931
01:19:58,639 --> 01:19:59,638
What could be wrong?

932
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:08,277
Why didn't you say you were staying
with this François guy?

933
01:20:08,557 --> 01:20:13,556
Didn't you think we'd be worried
if you just vanished?

934
01:20:20,595 --> 01:20:22,794
What's the problem, do you think?

935
01:20:25,315 --> 01:20:26,194
I don't know.

936
01:20:26,834 --> 01:20:28,914
Stop being so pig-headed.

937
01:20:29,474 --> 01:20:30,593
What's the matter?

938
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:33,714
What, darling?

939
01:20:40,232 --> 01:20:44,411
If you don't know,
I don't see what we can do about it.

940
01:20:48,471 --> 01:20:48,971
There is no problem.

941
01:20:49,893 --> 01:20:52,234
Why should there be one?
You know better than me.

942
01:20:52,991 --> 01:20:54,390
Leave me alone!

943
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:58,475
What do you mean, I know better?

944
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:02,509
Ask Pierre.
He always knows everything!

945
01:21:04,309 --> 01:21:06,028
What are you trying to say?

946
01:21:07,228 --> 01:21:07,827
Nothing.

947
01:21:08,307 --> 01:21:10,307
Why did you say it then?

948
01:21:11,187 --> 01:21:12,907
Are you jealous?

949
01:21:15,347 --> 01:21:17,606
What have you got into your head?

950
01:21:17,607 --> 01:21:20,036
That Pierre and I...
That's absurd!

951
01:21:20,071 --> 01:21:22,465
Because we call each other a lot?

952
01:21:22,785 --> 01:21:25,985
He's a friend.
A friend of mine and your Dad's.

953
01:21:26,385 --> 01:21:27,784
What makes you think...

954
01:21:27,865 --> 01:21:29,244
Stay here, I'm talking to you!

955
01:21:29,624 --> 01:21:33,304
Stop being so sullen.
You've no reason to act this way!

956
01:21:33,339 --> 01:21:34,823
Look at me, please!

957
01:21:37,623 --> 01:21:38,742
I swear you've got it wrong.

958
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:41,674
I wonder
how you could even think that.

959
01:21:44,102 --> 01:21:45,222
I love you.

960
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,539
Really... I love you.

961
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:02,098
Dad and I were sick with worry
when you didn't come home.

962
01:22:02,133 --> 01:22:03,704
You find that so...

963
01:22:04,064 --> 01:22:04,705
So absurd?

964
01:22:05,418 --> 01:22:09,818
Maybe we weren't sick, but we freaked.
Because we love you.

965
01:22:10,138 --> 01:22:11,218
I love you.

966
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:38,093
<i>Tomorrow, I'm interviewing
the author of The Smart Gang.</i>

967
01:22:38,128 --> 01:22:42,173
You loved that book
if memory serves me right,

968
01:22:42,572 --> 01:22:47,292
If you give me your copy,
I'll ask him to sign it, okay?

969
01:22:49,412 --> 01:22:50,091
Would you like that?

970
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:57,570
Are you okay?

971
01:22:59,129 --> 01:23:01,169
I'm glad you're home.

972
01:23:01,204 --> 01:23:01,888
Goodnight.

973
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:03,369
Goodnight, Dad.

974
01:23:05,257 --> 01:23:07,529
Using Berrychon as a pseudonym.

975
01:23:08,137 --> 01:23:11,587
Isabelle kept total control
over Rimbaud's work.

976
01:23:11,588 --> 01:23:13,300
- It was a huge money-maker.
- That's right.

977
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:16,254
She began to create this aura

978
01:23:16,255 --> 01:23:18,334
of a pious nun.

979
01:23:18,335 --> 01:23:21,274
Like a builder constructs a wall garden.

980
01:23:21,275 --> 01:23:24,718
Then, she began to meddle
with Rimbaud's work.

981
01:23:25,694 --> 01:23:29,493
We know that the poems
that shocked her went on the fire.

982
01:23:29,494 --> 01:23:33,053
I can agree with the portrait
you draw of Isabelle.

983
01:23:33,054 --> 01:23:35,733
It's the same as I had
before I began the book.

984
01:23:36,033 --> 01:23:37,882
We agree, both of us, on that point.

985
01:23:37,883 --> 01:23:41,603
At the same time,
I'd like to raise a few...

986
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,443
Stop, this is getting too theoretical.

987
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:46,568
Cut at "we agree on that point."

988
01:23:46,603 --> 01:23:50,103
And go to
when Teulé talks about homosexuality.

989
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:53,921
It's around...
around 0:30.

990
01:23:58,154 --> 01:24:00,568
- It wouldn't matter.
- It's poetic license.

991
01:24:01,090 --> 01:24:02,829
But I think Rimbaud is...

992
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:04,329
On "I think" let's try

993
01:24:05,209 --> 01:24:06,409
slotting it in...

994
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,437
What do you want know?

995
01:24:31,315 --> 01:24:32,714
What's going on?

996
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,754
Thanks for coming.

997
01:24:36,314 --> 01:24:36,914
Come in.

998
01:24:48,192 --> 01:24:49,913
What's this all about?

999
01:24:51,871 --> 01:24:52,551
Sit down.

1000
01:24:53,071 --> 01:24:54,596
No, I won't. What do you want?

1001
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:57,191
I truly had no idea about the tapes.

1002
01:24:57,226 --> 01:24:58,390
Is that all?

1003
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:02,713
I called you
because I wanted you to be present...

1004
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:13,879
It's me
Please, try to get rid of them.

1005
01:28:14,616 --> 01:28:17,559
I'm in the bedroom.
Something terrible's happened.

1006
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:19,925
I can't face them right now.

1007
01:28:20,808 --> 01:28:22,259
Hurry, please.

1008
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:14,155
What's going on?

1009
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:16,354
Majid committed suicide.

1010
01:29:16,389 --> 01:29:18,189
I was there. He slit his throat.

1011
01:29:18,224 --> 01:29:18,789
What?

1012
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:20,989
Yes, exactly.

1013
01:29:22,669 --> 01:29:24,748
Sadly, it's no joke.

1014
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,248
What do you mean you were there?

1015
01:29:28,283 --> 01:29:29,788
I'm saying I was at his place.

1016
01:29:30,786 --> 01:29:34,633
He phoned me to come,
so he could explain about the tapes.

1017
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:37,347
- So I went.
- And?

1018
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:39,507
And nothing.

1019
01:29:40,866 --> 01:29:44,012
He said, "I wanted you to be present"
and cut his throat.

1020
01:29:49,544 --> 01:29:50,665
That can't be...

1021
01:29:53,104 --> 01:29:55,784
Try to get rid of them.
We need to talk.

1022
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,502
What will I tell them?

1023
01:29:58,663 --> 01:29:59,543
I don't know.

1024
01:30:00,863 --> 01:30:02,866
What did you say when I called?

1025
01:30:02,901 --> 01:30:05,702
That it was the anonymous caller
asking for you.

1026
01:30:06,542 --> 01:30:10,262
- And?
- Nothing. I excused myself and left.

1027
01:30:10,382 --> 01:30:13,300
I don't know. Tell them you don't feel well,

1028
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,180
or that Pierrot's sick.

1029
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:21,419
Please!

1030
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:11,692
- They're done.
- I saw.

1031
01:31:14,851 --> 01:31:15,871
Not the light.

1032
01:31:20,129 --> 01:31:22,008
What did you tell them?

1033
01:31:22,369 --> 01:31:24,974
That I'd lied to them.

1034
01:31:25,009 --> 01:31:27,094
That it was you on the phone.

1035
01:31:27,129 --> 01:31:30,009
That I had to meet you
because you were in trouble.

1036
01:31:30,289 --> 01:31:31,974
They didn't offer to come with you?

1037
01:31:32,009 --> 01:31:37,007
What, you want
a transcript of the conversation.

1038
01:31:37,728 --> 01:31:38,926
Sorry.

1039
01:31:57,524 --> 01:31:58,923
What happened?

1040
01:32:02,882 --> 01:32:04,402
It's like I told you.

1041
01:32:06,003 --> 01:32:08,281
I went there. He asked me in
and killed himself.

1042
01:32:11,083 --> 01:32:12,593
There was a lot of blood.

1043
01:32:14,761 --> 01:32:16,481
Then, I ran off.

1044
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,490
You went for help?

1045
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:22,120
What?

1046
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:26,140
No, he died immediately.

1047
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,159
What are you going to do?

1048
01:32:37,477 --> 01:32:38,918
Was anybody else around?

1049
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:40,014
No, why?

1050
01:32:40,049 --> 01:32:41,076
Come on!

1051
01:32:43,636 --> 01:32:45,036
What time did it happen?

1052
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:48,836
This afternoon around 4, I guess.

1053
01:32:50,316 --> 01:32:52,395
So you went to the police or what?

1054
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:53,875
No.

1055
01:32:55,355 --> 01:32:58,354
What have you been doing?
Where were you?

1056
01:33:00,314 --> 01:33:01,193
Nowhere.

1057
01:33:03,153 --> 01:33:04,233
In town.

1058
01:33:19,431 --> 01:33:21,150
You have to tell the police.

1059
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:27,949
If anyone saw you,
you could be a suspect.

1060
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:30,982
Then he'd have achieved his goal.

1061
01:33:31,099 --> 01:33:32,099
What?

1062
01:33:32,309 --> 01:33:34,539
What,
do you have another explanation?

1063
01:33:36,067 --> 01:33:36,867
What for?

1064
01:33:37,348 --> 01:33:39,340
Why else did he ask me there?

1065
01:33:48,866 --> 01:33:50,122
What did you do to him?

1066
01:33:51,905 --> 01:33:52,906
What?

1067
01:33:54,865 --> 01:33:56,854
- When?
- Back then?

1068
01:33:59,184 --> 01:34:01,185
Who'd think up something like that?

1069
01:34:01,384 --> 01:34:04,250
First, he sends all those damn tapes.

1070
01:34:05,543 --> 01:34:07,067
You remember the drawings?

1071
01:34:07,503 --> 01:34:10,783
They must have been
some kind of forewarning, huh?

1072
01:34:10,943 --> 01:34:11,743
Georges!

1073
01:34:28,181 --> 01:34:30,651
I told Mom he was coughing up blood.

1074
01:34:32,419 --> 01:34:34,539
They didn't believe me, you see?

1075
01:34:36,058 --> 01:34:39,390
The doctor examined him,
didn't find anything.

1076
01:34:41,298 --> 01:34:43,377
He was an old fool.

1077
01:34:43,857 --> 01:34:45,977
Our family doctor, see?

1078
01:34:48,737 --> 01:34:52,376
Then I told him
Dad wanted him to kill the rooster.

1079
01:34:52,411 --> 01:34:56,315
It was a... nasty bird.

1080
01:34:57,614 --> 01:35:00,330
Evil, always attacking us.

1081
01:35:03,335 --> 01:35:04,855
And he did it.

1082
01:35:06,495 --> 01:35:08,214
He cut its head off.

1083
01:35:09,773 --> 01:35:11,367
The rooster flapped around.

1084
01:35:13,692 --> 01:35:15,852
Majid was covered in blood.

1085
01:35:19,488 --> 01:35:22,557
And I told them
he did it to scare me.

1086
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:32,054
To slit his own throat for that...

1087
01:35:32,089 --> 01:35:34,369
A hell of a twisted joke,
don't you think?

1088
01:35:55,325 --> 01:35:57,125
Why were they here?

1089
01:35:58,245 --> 01:35:58,845
Who?

1090
01:35:59,765 --> 01:36:01,565
Pierre and Mathilde.

1091
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:04,365
It was planned.

1092
01:36:04,684 --> 01:36:06,334
We were going to watch your show.

1093
01:36:10,164 --> 01:36:11,363
I'd forgotten.

1094
01:36:16,643 --> 01:36:18,547
I thought they were in Corsica.

1095
01:36:19,162 --> 01:36:20,362
Just one week.

1096
01:36:21,961 --> 01:36:22,761
They got back yesterday.

1097
01:36:40,998 --> 01:36:42,244
Hi, how are you?

1098
01:36:42,279 --> 01:36:43,843
Fine, thanks. And you?

1099
01:36:43,878 --> 01:36:45,717
I didn't forget your book.
I called last week.

1100
01:36:45,752 --> 01:36:47,558
- But it hasn't arrived.
- There's no rush.

1101
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:49,877
Maybe it's in today's mail.

1102
01:36:52,116 --> 01:36:54,916
- You spoke to Malembert?
- Yes, he'll bring you the file.

1103
01:36:57,476 --> 01:36:59,395
May I have a word, please?

1104
01:36:59,430 --> 01:37:00,640
What do you want?

1105
01:37:00,675 --> 01:37:02,755
I would like to talk with you.

1106
01:37:03,555 --> 01:37:05,435
I don't have time. Goodbye.

1107
01:38:12,944 --> 01:38:14,423
What do you want with me?

1108
01:38:15,503 --> 01:38:16,892
Why are you so scared, sir?

1109
01:38:17,224 --> 01:38:19,244
What do you want?
Why are you here?

1110
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:21,263
Would you have let me
into your house.

1111
01:38:24,342 --> 01:38:25,862
I have no time. I've told you.

1112
01:38:25,897 --> 01:38:27,261
I don't believe you, sir.

1113
01:38:28,581 --> 01:38:32,101
If you refuse to find the time,
I'll make a real scene

1114
01:38:32,341 --> 01:38:34,340
and tell people things
they shouldn't hear.

1115
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:37,065
I can't believe you'd want that.

1116
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:39,540
Is that a threat?
I have nothing to hide.

1117
01:38:39,575 --> 01:38:40,260
Really?

1118
01:38:49,697 --> 01:38:52,498
Young man,
your father's death must hurt.

1119
01:38:52,533 --> 01:38:54,698
But I refuse to be implicated by you.

1120
01:38:58,417 --> 01:38:59,217
Be right there.

1121
01:39:01,176 --> 01:39:03,496
The police corroborated my statement.

1122
01:39:03,531 --> 01:39:05,060
It was a suicide.

1123
01:39:05,095 --> 01:39:07,045
So, please, get out of my face.

1124
01:39:10,175 --> 01:39:14,333
I'd also advise you to stop
terrorizing us with stupid tapes.

1125
01:39:14,368 --> 01:39:17,054
I had nothing to do with the tapes.

1126
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:23,674
Just before he died
your father insisted it wasn't him.

1127
01:39:23,774 --> 01:39:26,492
Believe what you want.
I'm not lying.

1128
01:39:47,128 --> 01:39:49,428
I'd like to talk to you, please.

1129
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:52,488
I don't want to argue with you
in front of everyone.

1130
01:39:52,523 --> 01:39:55,052
Say your piece and leave
or I'll call the police.

1131
01:39:55,087 --> 01:39:59,047
I'll have you ejected.
You know you're not allowed here.

1132
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:00,532
I'm listening.

1133
01:40:00,567 --> 01:40:02,967
Why so angry?
What did I do to you?

1134
01:40:03,002 --> 01:40:04,366
What did you do to me?

1135
01:40:04,726 --> 01:40:08,006
For weeks, you terrorize my family and me
with your damn tapes!

1136
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,302
I won't believe you're not involved!

1137
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:12,565
Your father wasn't capable of that.

1138
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,290
Why would I do that, sir?

1139
01:40:14,325 --> 01:40:17,844
Drop the dumbass politeness, okay?

1140
01:40:20,164 --> 01:40:23,282
You deprived my father
of a good education.

1141
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:26,402
The orphanage teaches hatred
not politeness.

1142
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:29,087
Yet my father raised me well.

1143
01:40:29,122 --> 01:40:30,952
I won't forget that
because of you.

1144
01:40:32,202 --> 01:40:33,807
We're not finished.

1145
01:40:33,842 --> 01:40:36,241
What do you want? A fight?

1146
01:40:36,276 --> 01:40:37,726
If you insist.

1147
01:40:37,761 --> 01:40:40,561
You're probably stronger than me.
Go ahead, hit me!

1148
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:44,960
Know what? You're sick.

1149
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,359
You're as sick as your father.

1150
01:40:47,919 --> 01:40:50,758
I don't know
what dump obsessions he fed you

1151
01:40:50,793 --> 01:40:52,758
but I can tell you this...

1152
01:40:53,278 --> 01:40:56,163
You'll never give me a bad conscience

1153
01:40:56,198 --> 01:40:59,028
because your father's life
was sad or a failure.

1154
01:40:59,398 --> 01:41:01,198
I'm not to blame!

1155
01:41:01,436 --> 01:41:02,436
Do you get that?

1156
01:41:03,676 --> 01:41:08,636
If you ever try to hurt me or my family,
you'll regret it. I guarantee it.

1157
01:41:08,671 --> 01:41:10,996
I'm sick of your crap!

1158
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:11,595
Ah, yes.

1159
01:41:11,875 --> 01:41:14,875
Threats...
You're very good at those.

1160
01:41:16,714 --> 01:41:19,164
Do you expect me to apologize?

1161
01:41:19,515 --> 01:41:20,114
To whom?

1162
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:21,633
Me?

1163
01:41:24,233 --> 01:41:25,832
So what more do you want?

1164
01:41:26,473 --> 01:41:27,773
Nothing anymore.

1165
01:41:28,513 --> 01:41:31,312
I wondered how it feels,
a man's life on your conscience.

1166
01:41:32,112 --> 01:41:32,912
That's all.

1167
01:41:33,912 --> 01:41:35,031
Now I know.

1168
01:41:35,272 --> 01:41:37,252
Great, everything's okay then.

1169
01:41:37,352 --> 01:41:40,351
Do you mind if I go now?

1170
01:41:41,151 --> 01:41:42,551
Be my guest.

1171
01:44:08,328 --> 01:44:10,128
Hi, how is it going?

1172
01:44:13,486 --> 01:44:16,485
I'm just calling to let you know
I'm going to have a lie down.

1173
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,785
No, I came home early.

1174
01:44:21,445 --> 01:44:24,445
I'm exhausted.
I must have picked up some kind of bug.

1175
01:44:25,725 --> 01:44:27,404
No, please, not that.

1176
01:44:28,444 --> 01:44:32,444
Anyway, I wasn't needed in the office.

1177
01:44:33,044 --> 01:44:35,243
Everything's great.
I just feel wiped out.

1178
01:44:36,642 --> 01:44:39,841
Don't wake me up when you get home.
I took 2 pills.

1179
01:44:41,441 --> 01:44:42,941
When's Pierrot home?

1180
01:44:44,561 --> 01:44:46,461
You'll be back by then.

1181
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:50,481
Tell him to go easy
on his poor old Dad.

1182
01:44:55,768 --> 01:44:56,968
I love you. Bye.

1183
01:47:25,624 --> 01:47:27,624
Come back here!

1184
01:47:41,752 --> 01:47:43,352
Let go of me!

1185
01:47:48,691 --> 01:47:50,690
I don't wanna go!

1186
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:52,150
Calm down!
