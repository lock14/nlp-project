(LUKE:) All right, if we're gonna do this,
Dr. Squires, we're gonna do it right.

- I'm not going back to prison.
- Good.

1030
01:12:08,994 --> 01:12:12,831
Let's establish a few ground rules.
Number one, we use pagers.

1031
01:12:13,415 --> 01:12:15,384
Someone pages us, we call them back
from a payphone.

1032
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:17,970
We never use home phones
for this type of stuff. Never.

1033
01:12:18,554 --> 01:12:22,056
That's great, Luke. I already have
a pager for my medical practice.

1034
01:12:22,057 --> 01:12:23,557
All right, good.

1035
01:12:23,558 --> 01:12:28,428
Number two, we sell weed by the gram,
by the eighth, and by the ounce.

1036
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:32,432
Gram's the highest profit margin,
but it's also the most potent,

1037
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:34,151
that's why we try to encourage people
to buy the grams.

1038
01:12:34,152 --> 01:12:37,737
Principal Edwards, I can give you
two grams for 125 bucks, all right?

1039
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:40,739
Anything less than that,
I don't make a profit.

1040
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,743
You always were
very good at math, Luke.
