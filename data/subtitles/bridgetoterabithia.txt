00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,833
- Want toast?
- Yes.

3
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,625
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

4
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,625
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

5
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,542
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

6
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,583
- One more bite.
- You want jelly?

7
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,292
Yes, please.

8
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,458
Watch it, Brenda.
Don't mess my clothes up.

9
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:02,500
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

10
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,542
- Oh, did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

11
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,167
- Hey!
- You're one to talk.

12
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,167
- Are you excited about school?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,167
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

14
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,333
Very cute.

15
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,375
He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

16
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,625
Stop picking
on your brother and eat.

17
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:23,667
May Belle?

18
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,875
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

19
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,458
OK, who hid my sneakers?

20
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,000
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

21
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,750
What? Mom!

22
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,708
Sorry, but I will not send any child of
mine to school looking like some hobo.

23
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:42,167
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

24
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,208
These are girls' ones.

25
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,958
It's the fan belt this time,
but I got another.

26
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,625
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

27
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:53,292
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

28
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,417
- And?
- My sneakers.

29
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,667
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

30
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,833
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

31
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,917
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

32
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,667
- Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

33
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,750
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

34
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,542
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,417
Just about to.

36
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:59,125
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

37
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,000
Give it to me.

38
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:04,417
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

39
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,917
I found it!

40
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,375
You're kidding me.

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,667
OK, that's enough.

42
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:16,583
Consider it a free lunch program,
farmer boy!

43
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,375
All right, settle down.

44
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,500
Good one, Janice.

45
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:23,333
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tell Alexandra.

46
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:26,000
- "Monster Mouth. " Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

47
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:31,042
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

48
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,042
A few ground rules for this classroom.

49
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,333
No talking. No chewing gum.
No electronic devices. Be forewarned.

50
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,583
If you download essays
off the Internet,

51
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,583
you'll be downloaded into detention.

52
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:46,333
Let's start the year off on
the right foot and all do our own work.

53
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:49,292
- I expect you to take notes.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

54
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,583
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.
Know what that is? My loser detector.

55
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,083
Jesse Aarons!

56
00:05:58,292 --> 00:06:01,333
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

57
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,708
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

58
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,292
He hit me.

59
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,667
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

60
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:10,750
be quiet!

61
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:15,208
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

62
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,333
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

63
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:20,667
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

64
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,833
He asked you a question,
twinkle toes.

65
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,250
Good morning, kids. Welcome back.
I hope you had a great summer.

66
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,042
Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will be joining your class.

67
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:39,000
- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

68
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,667
Thank you, Principal Turner.

69
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,833
Well, Leslie, um,
you'll sit at my desk this morning,

70
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:49,083
until we can figure out
where to squeeze you in.

71
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,667
I like to start the year
with a little fun.

72
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,417
I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

73
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes?

74
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:05,042
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page,
did you mean both sides of the paper?

75
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,417
- You can do one side, Madison.
- I'll do two.

76
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,750
- Yeah, that's cool.
- No way!

77
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,708
- It was so amazing.
- Can I have this?

78
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,083
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

79
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,875
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

80
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:24,167
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

81
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,875
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

82
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:30,875
- You got the problem.
- That's right, new girl.

83
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,833
- Nice feet.
- You say something?

84
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:37,375
What I said was,

85
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:40,875
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

86
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,375
who collect tolls
from unlucky travelers?

87
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:45,500
Trolls?
What is she talking about?

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,333
Nice try, beanpole.
It's still a dollar.

89
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:12,542
Yeah!

90
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,917
- Let's do it. Do it.
- Yeah, we've got Hoager.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,917
Next grade, line up.
Let's do this thing. Come on.

92
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,083
Fulcher, Hoager, get in here.

93
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,042
Get ready.
Let's get this race started.

94
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,917
- Beep, beep, beep.
- Dead meat.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,583
Back behind the line. You know
how it goes. Back behind. Come on.

96
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:36,083
Hey, new girl.
This is just for guys.

97
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,833
Hey, I'm talking to you!

98
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,875
What's the matter?
Afraid a girl's gonna beat you?

99
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,583
- On your mark. Get set.
- Dead meat.

100
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,250
Go, Hoager!
Get in there!

101
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,542
Go! Go, Jess, go!

102
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,917
Come on!

103
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,792
Come on! You can do it!

104
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,083
Come on, Jess!

105
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,167
Go, Jess, go!

106
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,542
Jess, Jess, did you win?

107
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:41,583
Hey, Jess, right?

108
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,167
- Idiot!
- What?

109
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,625
- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

110
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,833
Thank you.

111
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,708
Are you following me?

112
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,625
No. I live over there.

113
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,583
We're neighbors?
You got little sisters?

114
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:18,583
- No. Just me.
- Oh.

115
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,500
You got any Barbies?

116
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,042
Yeah. I think I have a few.
You got any?

117
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:28,208
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

118
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,500
One got cut in half
playing Super Extreme Barbies.

119
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,000
Never heard of that before.

120
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,042
You flush the toilet
with them in it,

121
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,792
drop them from the upstairs window,
stuff like that.

122
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,042
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

123
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,667
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

124
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,042
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

125
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,083
Hey, Dad.

126
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,208
- I'm getting supplies. You wanna come?
- Yeah. Sure.

127
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,042
See ya.

128
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,833
There we go.
This'll make it feel better.

129
00:10:56,917 --> 00:11:00,042
- How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

130
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,708
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

131
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,750
- I'm doing my algebra.
- Put more cream on there.

132
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:08,250
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

133
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,958
You're not little kids anymore.

134
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,708
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

135
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:24,875
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

136
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,625
- You can't prove it!
- There a problem here?

137
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,000
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

138
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,250
Is he picking on you?

139
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,125
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

140
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,250
How'd that race go?

141
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,875
There's this new girl
moved in next door.

142
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,208
She beat all of the boys.
Even Jess.

143
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,542
Make sure you take out
the garbage before supper.

144
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:02,875
One drop.

145
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:06,375
And that's the magic.
Here comes May Belle's flowers.

146
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,000
Are these ever gonna grow?

147
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:13,500
This greenhouse is gonna be filled
with your purple flowers.

148
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,542
May Belle's flowers.

149
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,875
I always wanted the one
that had, like, purple all over it.

150
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,708
They are so cool.

151
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,250
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

152
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:30,167
- Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- Yeah.

153
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,417
The bell's gonna ring!

154
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,958
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

155
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:39,083
Aren't you glad
that summer's over?

156
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,625
- No!
- No? I am.

157
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,917
Come and get your instruments.

158
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,833
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

159
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,375
Ms. Edmunds?
May I please play the castanets?

160
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,667
Yes, you may.
Everybody ready for music?

161
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,917
Take a picture.
Lasts longer.

162
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,333
<i>It's awfully quiet.
# Old McDonald had a farm...</i>

163
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,333
- No!
- No? You don't like that song?

164
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,875
- No!
- Then make some noise. Come on.

165
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,625
- We saw this video yesterday.
- Whatever.

166
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,417
Change it!
Give it... give it to me!

167
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,750
Stop it.
You're always fighting.

168
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:19,208
- Wait till I get my own place.
- I wanna watch this.

169
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,250
We just
can't keep going like this.

170
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,667
Honey, uh... I've only got what I've got
to work with. We gotta...

171
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,250
You gotta figure out
a way to get down on this.

172
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,292
It's a problem,
but I'm gonna try to get going.

173
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,125
And maybe you can pick up
another shift at the store.

174
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,917
Dead meat.

175
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,417
Wow.

176
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,292
You're really good at drawing.

177
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,333
Like, better than any kid
I've ever seen.

178
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,000
Uh... Thanks.

179
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,458
I wanna share
this composition for two reasons.

180
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:01,000
One, it uses adjectives well.
And two,

181
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:05,833
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

182
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:09,417
which is important for any writing.

183
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:14,375
<i>Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus by Leslie Burke.</i>

184
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,458
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

185
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,875
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

186
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,292
"I'm moving gently forward,

187
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:35,917
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

188
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,458
I'm floating in silence,

189
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:41,583
and breaking it up
with the sound of my breath.

190
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:45,583
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

191
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,625
the place where I've come from,

192
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,167
and will go back to
when I am done here.

193
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,667
I'm diving.

194
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,417
I'm a scuba diver.

195
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,042
I'm going deeper past
the wrinkled rocks and dark seaweed

196
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,167
toward a deep blueness
where a school of silver fish wait.

197
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,167
As I swim through the water,

198
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,875
bubbles burst from me,

199
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,833
wobbling like little jellyfish
as they rise.

200
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,875
I check my air.

201
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,917
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

202
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,792
but that is what makes it so special. "

203
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:25,208
Thank you, Leslie.
Now tonight at 7:00 on channel four

204
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:29,583
there is a special about
an undersea explorer, Dr. Bob Ballard.

205
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:33,958
I want everyone to watch and write one
page about what you've learned.

206
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:35,500
Leslie?

207
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,708
What if you can't watch this program?

208
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,375
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

209
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,500
But... what if you don't have a TV?

210
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,750
My dad says the TV
kills your brain cells.

211
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:58,125
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

212
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,417
- I rest my case.
- Well, then, Leslie,

213
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,417
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

214
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,083
Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.

215
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:09,292
That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

216
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,083
Hey, Leslie, come here.

217
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,375
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

218
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,500
- Here comes Janice!
- New kid's in Janice's seat.

219
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,792
- What does she think she's doing?
- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

220
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,833
You have a death wish?
This row's for eighth-graders.

221
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:50,792
That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

222
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,500
You're really asking for it.

223
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,667
Seems to me she gives it out
whether you ask for it or not.

224
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,917
So might as well have some fun.

225
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,708
Getting Janice all wound up
is a weird way of having fun.

226
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,208
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

227
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:28,125
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

228
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:31,375
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

229
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,750
- What?
- You can't do it.

230
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,625
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

231
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:44,042
Hey, May Belle!
I don't use my Barbies anymore.

232
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:47,375
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

233
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,417
- Sure.
- Thanks.

234
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,833
You're lucky to have a sister.

235
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,792
I've got four, and I'd
trade them all for a good dog.

236
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,208
I'd love to have a dog.

237
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,583
Now let's go before
she changes her mind.

238
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:05,125
Race you to the end of the road.
On your mark, get set, go!

239
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,875
Come on, Jess!

240
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,083
Come on!

241
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,333
What about sharks?

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,708
You ever see any sharks while you're

243
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,958
scuba-ing or whatever?

244
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:55,708
I've never gone scuba diving
in my whole life.

245
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,625
- You lied in your essay?
- No. I made it up.

246
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,958
It's different from lying.

247
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,667
Those drawings you make,
you seen those things yourself?

248
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,500
No, but...

249
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,625
Hey! Look at that!

250
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,958
- Cool!
- That's been there forever.

251
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:20,417
I wouldn't trust it.

252
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,042
Come on. Just try it.

253
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,958
OK.

254
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:35,667
You got it? That's it.

255
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:38,667
Thanks.

256
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,208
- What are you doing?
- Getting up higher.

257
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,458
OK.

258
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,958
Wow! That was so much fun.
You have to try it. Come on.

259
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,833
OK.

260
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,625
Let your head hang back,
watch the clouds.

261
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,542
Feels like flying.

262
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:13,958
- We need a place. Just for us.
- Hmm?

263
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,042
Where there's no
Janice Averys or Scott Hoagers.

264
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,917
Yeah, but when we go back to school,
there they are waiting.

265
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,667
Yeah, but...

266
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,917
...someplace better than
just not being at school.

267
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:29,542
What if there was a magical kingdom
only we knew about?

268
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,375
I don't know. What if?

269
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:34,708
OK, well...

270
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,458
...what if the only way
we could enter it

271
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,875
is by swinging on this enchanted rope?

272
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,917
- Enchanted rope?
- Yeah.

273
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,458
Come on.

274
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,708
Leslie!

275
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,125
Leslie!

276
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,833
Leslie.

277
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:15,375
- Come on!
- Wait up.

278
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,500
Ahh!

279
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:49,125
We shouldn't be in here.
This isn't our land.

280
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,250
- Not so loud. They'll hear you.
- What are you talking about?

281
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,292
Hey! What's that?

282
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,917
Whoa. Jess, look at this. Wow.

283
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:12,875
Too bad for them.
They got so close.

284
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:16,083
- What are you talking about?
- To the kingdom.

285
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:21,042
- What's that?
- What?

286
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:24,292
That sound. I've heard it before.
Someone's out there.

287
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,333
That's the sound of the prisoners
rattling their chains.

288
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,042
What prisoners?

289
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,583
The prisoners of the Dark Master.

290
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,417
- We should go.
- Wait, Jess, look.

291
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,375
What is it?

292
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,083
Look at this.

293
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,167
Wow. This is amazing.

294
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,708
Wow.

295
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
This is it.

296
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:34,375
Warriors.

297
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,917
- Try dragonflies.
- No. They're warriors.

298
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,375
From the treetop provinces.

299
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,750
- I don't know this game.
- What game? This is for real.

300
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,958
This is the ruins
of a once great fortress

301
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,542
whose people have been imprisoned.

302
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:01,583
Jess, you and I have been
sent to free them.

303
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,083
Prisoners of the Dark Master, hear me!

304
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,500
We have come to free you.

305
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,208
Do you hear us?

306
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,250
Show me that you hear us!

307
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,708
You got lucky timing. The wind's
been blowing off and on all day.

308
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,250
Can't hear you!

309
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,000
- Go straight home. I'll see you soon.
- OK. See ya!

310
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,917
Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

311
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,750
Uh... She's... She's fine.

312
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,750
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

313
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:47,458
...forget. There are four of us.

314
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,875
OK.

315
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,792
Remember to bring your bag.

316
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:55,333
Why would anyone
want to wear that?

317
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,417
Janice!

318
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:04,083
- You OK?
- What's the problem?

319
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,917
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

320
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,083
On purpose.

321
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,750
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

322
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,167
- But he didn't do anything.
- Go.

323
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,958
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

324
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:38,500
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

325
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:41,417
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

326
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,250
Jeez.

327
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:46,750
Can I wash up at your house?
My mom sees this, she'll be all over

328
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,417
the principal and everybody,
and my life will be over.

329
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,542
<i>Why would Dad do this?</i>

330
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,542
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh.

331
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:00,042
Mom, this is Leslie.

332
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,958
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

333
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:04,750
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

334
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:08,458
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

335
00:30:08,542 --> 00:30:11,958
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

336
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,625
- Come on. See ya later.
- Not too late, OK, honey?

337
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:20,417
- Weird and weirder.
- Hey. Be glad he's found a friend.

338
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:24,208
- Where's your dad work?
- At home. Same as my mom.

339
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:26,375
- They're writers.
- Writers?

340
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,542
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

341
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,250
That explains you.

342
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:36,125
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

343
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,708
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

344
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,708
You know a lot about hardware?

345
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,708
No. Why?

346
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:48,333
Well, your dad works
at a hardware store.

347
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:50,083
OK.

348
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,292
All I'm saying is that
you are who you are...

349
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,000
...not your parents.

350
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,083
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

351
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,625
Not really.

352
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,833
What's that?

353
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,792
- Grenade.
- There're no grenades here.

354
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,333
Come on!

355
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,417
- Squirrels!
- Part squirrel, part Scott Hoager.

356
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,500
- Squogre.
- Squogre!

357
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:30,417
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

358
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,792
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

359
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,542
This is not good.

360
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:48,917
- See them? Up there?
- Yeah.

361
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,042
- Do you? Really?
- Yeah.

362
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:04,958
Les...

363
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,292
Leslie?

364
00:32:09,042 --> 00:32:12,333
Leslie. Leslie!

365
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:16,625
Come on. You can see
the whole kingdom from up here.

366
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:23,208
Isn't this cool?
We can do anything here.

367
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,833
Look at it.

368
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,625
It's all ours.

369
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:41,167
From the mountains to the oceans.

370
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,750
- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

371
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,792
Just close your eyes...

372
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:51,625
...but keep your mind wide open.

373
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,542
Wow.

374
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:11,333
What do we call this place?

375
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,958
Terabithia.

376
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:27,125
Shh.
Everybody tiptoe. OK, ready?

377
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,375
Happy birthday!

378
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:37,375
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>

379
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:41,292
<i># Happy birthday, dear Jess</i>

380
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,292
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

381
00:33:44,667 --> 00:33:45,958
Make a wish.

382
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:48,792
- Yay!
- What'd you wish for?

383
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:58,333
- This is cheap junk.
- No, it isn't.

384
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:01,208
- I love it.
- How? It doesn't even work.

385
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:04,042
I don't think we have
the hang of it yet, Dad.

386
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,167
You know what? Keep the box.
We'll see if we can take it back.

387
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,667
Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

388
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:20,917
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

389
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:24,292
What are you going to do
if you catch it?

390
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:26,667
These vegetables are our livelihood.

391
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:29,917
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

392
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,792
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

393
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:39,625
Well, he's not gonna
get in here now, right, Dad?

394
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:43,375
Hope not. But if he does,
you just let me deal with it.

395
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,083
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

396
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:50,875
No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

397
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,667
Under the seat.

398
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,792
I heard it was
your birthday yesterday.

399
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:18,958
- Like it?
- Wow.

400
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:22,292
It must've cost a fortune.

401
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,000
What's it matter what it costs?

402
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,208
I don't know.

403
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,708
Well, I can take it back
and get a cheaper one, if you want.

404
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,458
Thanks... a lot.

405
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:39,292
<i># Jess and Leslie sitting in a tree...</i>

406
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Look.
The squogre and the vulture.

407
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,292
Hey, here he comes.

408
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,875
And a guy who can stand up to a squogre
is scared of a Hoager?

409
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:03,000
Ms. Edmunds?

410
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,958
- He speaks.
- Can I help you with those?

411
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:09,417
You sure can.
And you just made my day.

412
00:36:12,042 --> 00:36:13,458
- Great.
- I'll get that one.

413
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:14,833
Thank you.

414
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,042
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, boys.

415
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,583
How come you're so good at that?

416
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,833
- Good at what?
- Building stuff.

417
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,417
You're good at it for a girl.

418
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,375
Same way I'm fast... for a girl.

419
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,000
You know what I mean.

420
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:47,167
You're pretty good at art... for a boy.

421
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,125
OK, OK, truce.

422
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,708
Don't your parents notice
this stuff's missing?

423
00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,208
Not when they're in
the middle of writing a book.

424
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:00,833
What's that?

425
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,208
Show yourselves!

426
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,208
It's a giant troll!

427
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,500
No, it's a giant tree
that almost killed us!

428
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:24,042
You think that tree
just fell all by itself?

429
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,375
Come on.

430
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:29,875
When the Dark Master saw
the squogres weren't scaring us away,

431
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,458
- he sent a giant troll.
- How big?

432
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:39,958
That's how big its feet are.

433
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:46,375
- You really think so?
- What else could it be?

434
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,000
What should we do?

435
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,333
If we had a troll hunter, we could
track its scent and sneak up on it.

436
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,125
Hey, look at that! Come on!

437
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,375
I think it went that way!

438
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,583
We rule Terabithia,
and nothing crushes us!

439
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,958
I'll race you to the rope.

440
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,542
I love this place!

441
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:46,125
Go on, get out of here.
And don't come back.

442
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,875
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:05,917
- I took care of it for you.
- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

444
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,875
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

445
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:12,333
Did he tell you he's gonna
stay the hell out of the greenhouse?

446
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,875
No, he went out there
and he's not coming...

447
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:17,208
Jess, you need to understand
something, OK?

448
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:21,167
This is not one of your cartoons. This
is just a pest that eats up our food,

449
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,375
money we earn and time we don't have.

450
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,667
- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

451
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:27,917
and do as I say.

452
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:30,708
OK.

453
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,792
Good night, sweetheart.

454
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:06,125
Sweet dreams.

455
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,583
Lights out, Jess.

456
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:12,292
Night, Dad.

457
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,250
Are we slaying the giant troll
after school today?

458
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:24,083
You've got your head
in the clouds, Leslie.

459
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:27,708
- Huh?
- There is no giant troll, all right?

460
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,583
Well, you better not let
the Terabithians hear you.

461
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,542
They thought you were their king.

462
00:40:47,792 --> 00:40:51,417
Alexandra, my daddy gave me Twinkies!

463
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,750
Neither one squished, 'cause I
didn't put them next to my drink.

464
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:56,625
I'd shut up about those Twinkies.

465
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:59,458
You're just mad 'cause I
got some and you didn't.

466
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,792
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

467
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,417
I'll eat them, not lose them.

468
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,958
Jess! Jess!

469
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:16,083
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!

470
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:20,000
- I told you, keep your mouth shut.
- She's there. What are you gonna do?

471
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:22,250
And she makes you pay to pee!

472
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:25,375
It's a dollar, shorty.

473
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:29,125
But I don't have a dollar.

474
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:32,750
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

475
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,208
Free to pee!

476
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,458
Free to pee! Free to pee! Free to pee!

477
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,500
Let's go.

478
00:41:53,917 --> 00:41:56,250
I want my Twinkies, Janice Avery.

479
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:58,250
What Twinkies, Twinkie?

480
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,875
You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

481
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:06,042
Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

482
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,333
You'll get your butt kicked.

483
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:12,375
No, I'd get kicked out of school for
fighting a girl. What's that prove?

484
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:15,167
She stole my Twinkies.

485
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,500
Come on.

486
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:22,208
It's all right, May Belle.

487
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:26,125
We'll get her back. Won't we, Jess?

488
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:33,458
<i>Don't let
the Terabithians hear you.</i>

489
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,458
<i>They thought you were their king.</i>

490
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,708
Jess! Jess!

491
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:11,750
Oh... Hi! Look at you!

492
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:16,583
That is your very own, certified,
purebred, giant troll hunter.

493
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,625
- He's for me?
- Yeah,

494
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:21,083
he just took a giant
pee all over my sweatshirt.

495
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,625
Wow, Jess. Thank you.

496
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:30,167
I name you Prince Terrien,

497
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,125
giant troll hunter extraordinaire.

498
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:35,167
P.T. For short.

499
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,958
Hey! I think he smells a troll.
Come on.

500
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:47,083
Oh, no! We've got company!

501
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,333
Dead meat! Dead meat!

502
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:53,250
- Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Hairy Vultures!

503
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,917
What's that?

504
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,750
It's a giant troll.

505
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,333
Nice feet.

506
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:14,375
Run!

507
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,792
Oh, my gosh!

508
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,583
I think we lost it.

509
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:34,250
Leslie...

510
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,917
- What's its weak spot?
- Does it have a weak spot?

511
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,458
I don't know!

512
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:43,292
Just making it madder!

513
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,625
P.T.!

514
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:51,000
That's it! That's its weak spot!

515
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:53,000
It's ticklish!

516
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,250
- Gross!
- Troll toe jam.

517
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:00,417
Good boy, P.T. Good boy!

518
00:45:00,958 --> 00:45:02,583
Good dog.

519
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,708
What's Janice's weak spot, you think?

520
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:14,958
Eighth-grade girl...

521
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,792
...probably eighth-grade boys.

522
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,917
Who's she got a crush on?

523
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,625
I don't know. Let's see...

524
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:25,250
...coolest boy in
eighth grade is probably...

525
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,875
...Willard Hughes.

526
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,417
- That's it.
- What's it?

527
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:33,750
Write, "Dear Janice... "

528
00:45:33,792 --> 00:45:36,458
- You do it.
- No way.

529
00:45:36,542 --> 00:45:39,083
Boys' handwriting sucks.
No offense.

530
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,333
It's gotta be you.

531
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:44,458
OK.

532
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,458
"Dear Janice,

533
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:50,083
<i>you're the most amazing and
beautiful person I've ever known. "</i>

534
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:53,958
- How do I know which desk is hers?
- It's got dried-up blood and old bones.

535
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:01,792
<i>"I do not know if you know this
about me, but I need to tell you,</i>

536
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:05,292
<i>I think you are so cool.</i>

537
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:09,208
You are the coolest over
all the other girls in our school. "

538
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,792
OK. Write this,

539
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,500
<i>"Let's find out if what
I think we have is real. "</i>

540
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,625
- Oh, Mr. Bailey...
- Huh?

541
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:24,125
...I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

542
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:27,458
I think someone threw up
in the girls' room.

543
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,708
All right, I'll take a look.

544
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:38,500
"Meet me by the bus
after school today.

545
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:41,833
We can ride home together
and talk about us. "

546
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,292
<i>Underline and capitalize the "us. "</i>

547
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,500
"All my love, Willard. "

548
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,833
You know, if we get caught,
they're both gonna kill us.

549
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:07,417
- I got your note.
- What are you talking about?

550
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,083
That was really sweet.

551
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:11,458
- I'm saving these seats.
- For who?

552
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:14,292
Willard Hughes is gonna
ride Janice home today.

553
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:17,125
- What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

554
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,417
They're totally in love.

555
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,750
In your dreams.
Well, you better tell Willard that.

556
00:47:22,833 --> 00:47:25,167
It looks like he's
heading home in his own bus.

557
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,542
Look at Janice!

558
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:43,125
Hey, Janice, what happened?

559
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:45,458
Didn't Willard know
he's in love with you?

560
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:50,792
Where's
your boyfriend, Janice?

561
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,417
- What just happened?
- He just walked away.

562
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,292
- Yes.
- You wanna go?

563
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,333
- Yeah.
- I wanna come.

564
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:16,958
- You can't.
- It's a free country!

565
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:20,333
Don't follow us, or I'll tell Alexandra
you still suck your thumb

566
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:22,333
and sleep with Mr. Blanky.

567
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:28,833
- So, what do you say?
- They must have finished their book.

568
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:31,167
- How do you know?
- Hey, Leslie.

569
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,833
- We need your help.
- Come on.

570
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,417
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Leslie, come on.

571
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,667
All right, let's go.
We're on a mission.

572
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,083
Hey, this is my friend, Jess.
Can he help?

573
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,125
So, you're the infamous Jess.
Hi, I'm Judy.

574
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:51,958
Leslie tells me you're good
with a paint brush.

575
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,667
Grab one and get going.

576
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,667
Come on! I am determined
to have this wall finished

577
00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,292
so when the late sun hits it,
we can watch it catch fire.

578
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:08,750
Now, that's one steady hand, Jess.
That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

579
00:49:10,167 --> 00:49:11,708
Yeah.

580
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,333
You know,
the best prize that life offers,

581
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:17,167
is the chance to work hard
at work worth doing.

582
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:19,292
Teddy Roosevelt said that, not me.

583
00:49:57,042 --> 00:50:01,000
- Wow.
- What did I tell you? Was it worth it?

584
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:30,667
Hey, guys.

585
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,250
Jess, get started on your homework, OK?

586
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,958
I'm managing the store
on weekends, starting soon,

587
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:38,792
I need you to pick up
on some chores around here.

588
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:41,458
You know, the best prize
that life can offer

589
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:44,375
is working hard at work worth doing.

590
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,417
Hey...

591
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:05,042
...have you taken art classes?

592
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:08,542
No, I...
I just made them up myself.

593
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:10,375
You're really talented.

594
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:17,042
Jess, don't let those other kids
get in your way.

595
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:22,625
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

596
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,958
I just went to use the girl's room.

597
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:31,333
Someone's in a stall,
crying their eyes out,

598
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,542
and I think it's Janice Avery.

599
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,583
It can't be the trick we played, can it?

600
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:37,500
No way. But come here.

601
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,583
Free to pee!

602
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,833
Get out of here!

603
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:49,333
Get out of here, now!

604
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,208
- You should go talk to her.
- You kidding?

605
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,625
It's not "skinned knee crying,"
it's something serious.

606
00:51:57,708 --> 00:52:00,042
It's the girls' bathroom,
I can't go in there.

607
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:03,167
- I don't wanna go in there alone.
- What's the matter?

608
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:07,208
A girl who can stand up to a giant troll
is afraid of some dumb eighth grader?

609
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:41,792
Sorry.

610
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:45,167
- Go on, tell me.
- No, I don't wanna tell you.

611
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,750
- Why not?
- I'll tell you there.

612
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:55,625
He, like, came up to me.
I'm pretty sure he likes me.

613
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:05,750
No way! I like Tony!

614
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,333
Her dad gets really mad at her.

615
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:16,208
So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

616
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,542
- He hits her.
- Oh.

617
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:22,583
Some neighbor heard them
yelling so loud, they called the police.

618
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:26,792
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

619
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:32,042
- Whoa.
- Which explains, like, a lot.

620
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:37,333
Well, what did you say to her?

621
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:40,917
Well, I told her about not having a TV

622
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,875
and everyone laughing at me.

623
00:53:42,958 --> 00:53:45,958
I know what it's like
to have everyone think I was weird.

624
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:48,000
Then what'd she say?

625
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:50,250
She asked me for advice.

626
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:53,333
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

627
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:55,792
- Yeah.
- And?

628
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:58,250
Well, I told her just to pretend

629
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:01,458
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

630
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:06,333
and in a few weeks' time,
everybody would just forget about it.

631
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:08,292
Man...

632
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,000
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

633
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,417
- We should go.
- Yeah.

634
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:17,542
- Wanna come back tomorrow?
- Can't. I got chores.

635
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:20,500
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

636
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,625
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

637
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:26,208
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

638
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:30,667
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

639
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,375
See ya!

640
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:26,708
That's what we need.
Bells... in Terabithia.

641
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,667
I'm really glad I came.

642
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,625
That whole Jesus thing,
it's really interesting.

643
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,083
It's not interesting.
It's scary!

644
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,542
It's nailing holes through your hands.

645
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:45,292
It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

646
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,250
- You really think that's true?
- It's in the Bible.

647
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:50,875
You have to believe it,
and you hate it.

648
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,667
I don't have to believe it,
and I think it's beautiful.

649
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:57,583
- You gotta believe the Bible, Leslie.
- Why?

650
00:55:57,625 --> 00:56:00,375
'Cause if you
don't believe in the Bible,

651
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,583
God will damn you to hell when you die.

652
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:04,875
Wow, May Belle.
Where'd you hear that?

653
00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:06,750
That's right, huh, Jess?

654
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:11,000
God damns you to hell
if you don't believe in the Bible.

655
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:13,542
- I think so.
- Well, I don't think so.

656
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:17,417
I seriously do not think God
goes around damning people to hell.

657
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,167
He's too busy running all this.

658
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:29,083
Hey, Jess.
Give me a hand.

659
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:32,292
Yeah. I'm coming.

660
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:36,500
Get my drill out of the greenhouse.

661
00:56:55,083 --> 00:56:57,042
You haven't managed
to kill those yet?

662
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:58,875
Not funny.

663
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,125
Look.

664
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,917
Ever thought of
putting them in the sun?

665
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,958
Jess. Jess.

666
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:23,292
- Where are my keys?
- What?

667
00:57:23,375 --> 00:57:26,292
My keys. You never gave them back to me.

668
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,125
- Think!
- I put the drill down here.

669
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:39,417
Damn it, the keys to the store
are on it, the register, all of it.

670
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:42,500
They have to replace those locks,
$ 700 out of my paycheck.

671
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,125
They gotta be right here.

672
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:47,458
- If I don't have those keys...
- I'll find them, Dad. I promise.

673
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:50,750
Why don't you draw me some money
to pay for it? How about that?

674
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,042
Make yourself useful,
draw me some money.

675
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:54,542
I said I'll find them.

676
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:02,917
You look awful.
What's the matter?

677
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,917
I lost the keys where my dad works,

678
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:07,750
and now he has to get
new keys made, and locks.

679
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:09,458
May Belle?

680
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,958
Please don't anyone get mad at me.

681
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,375
- What?
- He...

682
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:17,667
- I know where your dad's keys are.
- You do?

683
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:21,083
You know the bells
we talked about making?

684
00:58:21,167 --> 00:58:24,500
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

685
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,500
All that clanking metal and junk.

686
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:29,250
And... May Belle wanted to help.

687
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:30,833
And you let her?

688
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,833
Why did you tell me
you found them on the ground?

689
00:58:34,917 --> 00:58:37,458
- They were.
- On the ground in the greenhouse.

690
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:40,000
What's the matter with you?
Dad wants to kill me.

691
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,667
I was waiting for the right time.

692
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:47,125
So you know where the keys are?

693
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:59,000
See ya later.

694
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:04,917
- Tell Mom I'll be home in a bit.
- Are you gonna tell Dad it was me?

695
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,375
Don't worry. It's my job
to get Dad's keys back. See you later.

696
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,667
Whoa.

697
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,917
Look how high it got.
Come on. Let's go.

698
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,958
"Get your head out of the clouds, boy.
Draw me some money.

699
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:32,583
- Make yourself useful, draw me money. "
- What are you going on about?

700
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,750
"This isn't one of your cartoons.
This is serious. "

701
00:59:35,792 --> 00:59:40,125
What's so great about being serious
all the time anyway? Tell me that.

702
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,000
What if the Dark Master
gets the keys first?

703
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:51,292
I'm not scared of any Dark Master,
and those are my dad's keys.

704
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:07,208
Leslie, get behind me.

705
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,667
Jess, turn around. There's more.

706
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:14,375
Here, take this.

707
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,958
Jess!

708
01:00:30,083 --> 01:00:31,292
P.T., get him!

709
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:41,083
Good boy, P.T.

710
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah!

711
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:58,375
- Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Whoa!

712
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,333
Run!

713
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:05,000
Come on! Faster!

714
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,958
Dead meat! Dead meat!

715
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,458
Dead meat! Dead meat!

716
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,833
Told you they were grenades.

717
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,292
Jess!

718
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,125
I got you, Leslie!

719
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:32,208
I got you!

720
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,667
Up ahead! Get ready!

721
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:44,625
- They'll catch us.
- We're the fastest in Terabithia.

722
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:56,208
He's watching us.

723
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:01,625
Where are the keys?

724
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:03,917
Here, open this.

725
01:02:16,583 --> 01:02:19,208
Where are Terabithian warriors
when you need them?

726
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:21,125
I don't know.

727
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:26,875
Great. Now there's three of us.

728
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,375
- Wow.
- Now we're even.

729
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:37,875
Attack!

730
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:51,292
Dead meat! Dead meat!
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!

731
01:02:52,833 --> 01:02:53,792
Come on.

732
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:57,917
- Come on, P.T.
- Dead meat!

733
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:23,125
Be careful!
You're almost there.

734
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,667
Jess!

735
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,458
Jess!

736
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:53,917
Hey.

737
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,958
- See ya!
- Yeah, see ya.

738
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:39,042
Jess! I called you three times.

739
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:40,333
It's your girlfriend.

740
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:42,500
She's not my girlfriend.

741
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,708
<i>- Hey.
- Hello, Jess.</i>

742
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:47,792
Wait. Who is this?

743
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:50,500
It's Saturday, but it's
your teacher, Ms. Edmunds.

744
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:55,000
I was planning on taking my nephews
into the city to the museum,

745
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:58,958
and my sister changed her plans
last minute, so I had a thought.

746
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,208
- Hey, Mom.
- Hmm? Is it the baby?

747
01:06:06,292 --> 01:06:09,000
No, she's fine.
May Belle's got her.

748
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:12,625
Teacher wants me to go
on a field trip today.

749
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,500
- Is that OK?
- Mmm.

750
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:21,708
Ms. Edmunds? Yeah, I can go.

751
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,667
- All set?
- Yeah.

752
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,167
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

753
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:42,375
Forget something?

754
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:46,667
No. I'm good.

755
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,500
Wow.

756
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:31,500
Honey, honey, stay here.

757
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,333
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

758
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:40,500
It's Brueghel.
It's one of my favorites.

759
01:07:40,542 --> 01:07:43,917
I wonder if he started in notebooks
like you. I know da Vinci did.

760
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:51,833
It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

761
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:54,208
You've been to a museum before, right?

762
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:57,708
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

763
01:07:57,792 --> 01:08:00,542
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

764
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:41,875
It's such a nice day out.

765
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:46,250
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

766
01:08:46,333 --> 01:08:50,333
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

767
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:53,625
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

768
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:55,708
But I do try to keep an open mind,

769
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:58,375
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

770
01:08:58,458 --> 01:09:02,125
That's what Leslie Burke says.
She told me to keep my mind wide open.

771
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:03,875
Leslie Burke is right.

772
01:09:03,917 --> 01:09:07,583
Mind like yours wide open,
you could create a whole new world.

773
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:19,333
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

774
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:23,042
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

775
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:30,292
- Hey, guys.
- See? I told you.

776
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,417
Oh, my God, Jess!

777
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:37,375
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

778
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:40,875
Mom...

779
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:43,417
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

780
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,208
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

781
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:48,042
Dead?

782
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,042
What's going on?

783
01:09:57,792 --> 01:10:00,208
Your friend Leslie's dead.

784
01:10:02,042 --> 01:10:03,875
She drowned in a creek this morning.

785
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:07,542
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

786
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,875
They think she hit her head.

787
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:15,167
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

788
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:18,875
It couldn't break.
It... wouldn't have.

789
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:20,958
But it did.

790
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,875
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

791
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,792
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess!

792
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,250
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

793
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:13,083
I... I gotta do my chores first.

794
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,917
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

795
01:12:31,958 --> 01:12:33,708
Jess, your father and I thought

796
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:36,417
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

797
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,833
Just the three of us.

798
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,292
Paying what?

799
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,500
Prince Terrien. Shh.

800
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:07,333
You must be Jess.

801
01:13:16,542 --> 01:13:21,250
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

802
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:23,875
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

803
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:33,875
She loved you, you know.

804
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,375
You know, Leslie,

805
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:40,375
she never had much luck
making friends at her old school.

806
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,792
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

807
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:50,458
She said
if it wasn't for you...

808
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,125
You're the best friend she's ever had.

809
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,167
I wanna thank you for that.

810
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,750
You're welcome.

811
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:06,833
My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

812
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:13,958
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

813
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:23,708
- Jess.
- Next time,

814
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:26,750
we should invite Leslie to go.

815
01:14:28,625 --> 01:14:30,833
She'd like that.

816
01:14:40,292 --> 01:14:41,833
Hey, kid.

817
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:45,417
Sorry about your friend.

818
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:52,417
The purpose
of object pronouns...

819
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,625
So looks like you're
the fastest kid in the class now, huh?

820
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,083
It's a joke, dude.

821
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,708
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

822
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:09,417
Go wait for me out in the hall.

823
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:13,292
Silent reading until I get back.

824
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,375
Jess...

825
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:33,958
When my husband died...

826
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
...people kept telling me not to cry.

827
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,500
People kept trying to help me to forget.

828
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:46,125
But I didn't wanna forget.

829
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,542
Excuse me.

830
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:53,917
The things that girl came up with.

831
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:58,542
I don't get students like her too often.

832
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,583
So I realize...

833
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:08,375
...that if it's hard for me...

834
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:10,958
...how much harder it must be for you.

835
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:00,708
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the bus!

836
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:11,833
Hey.

837
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,042
Leslie?!

838
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,875
Jess!

839
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,458
Leslie!

840
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:33,000
- Jess!
- Leslie!

841
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,083
Lesl...

842
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:44,125
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

843
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,333
May Belle?

844
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:51,958
Hold on! Don't move!

845
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:56,083
Here, grab my arm.
I got you, don't worry.

846
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,958
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

847
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:06,833
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

848
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:10,250
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

849
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:12,167
This is our place!

850
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:17,667
I said go home!

851
01:19:32,792 --> 01:19:34,667
Honey, what's the matter?

852
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,583
What's the matter?

853
01:19:37,667 --> 01:19:39,583
What's the matter, baby?

854
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:45,917
No!

855
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,208
Jess!

856
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:53,000
It's OK, Jess.
It's OK, son, it's OK.

857
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:54,833
It's all gone.

858
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,792
Is it like the Bible says?

859
01:21:00,875 --> 01:21:02,750
Is she going to hell?

860
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:05,250
I don't know everything about God,

861
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:08,208
but I do know He's not
gonna send that little girl to hell.

862
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:11,625
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

863
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:15,375
Don't you think that even for a minute.

864
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:18,083
But it is.

865
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:22,375
I didn't invite her
to go to the museum with me.

866
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:25,792
I didn't wanna invite her.

867
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:29,167
I wasn't there to go with her.

868
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:32,333
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

869
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:34,583
It's not your fault.

870
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:37,292
None of that makes it so.

871
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:39,542
It's a terrible thing.

872
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:44,250
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

873
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:52,958
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

874
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:58,542
That's what you hold on to.

875
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,083
That's how you keep her alive.

876
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,667
May Belle?

877
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,750
Look.

878
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:39,417
I'm sorry I pushed you.

879
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:44,875
That was stupid and wrong...

880
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,083
...and I really miss you talking to me.

881
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,875
She's in your hands now.

882
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:56,250
Hey!

883
01:23:58,083 --> 01:23:59,375
Wait!

884
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:02,458
Wait!

885
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,167
Hey!

886
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:15,167
Jess? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you.

887
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:19,000
Can I use the lumber by your house?

888
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:20,750
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

889
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:23,542
Anything you see, you just...

890
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:27,792
You know, I meant to...
I meant to give you Prince Terrien,

891
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:31,083
but I... can't seem to give him up.

892
01:24:32,917 --> 01:24:35,000
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

893
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:36,625
Yeah.

894
01:26:00,042 --> 01:26:03,417
We're playing. By ourselves.

895
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:08,875
OK, but I know the most
incredible place to play.

896
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:12,042
You gotta promise you're
not gonna tell anybody about it.

897
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:16,208
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

898
01:26:16,292 --> 01:26:19,875
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

899
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,500
She's nothing but a baby.

900
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:24,833
You're right, and she's not ready
to be a princess yet.

901
01:26:24,917 --> 01:26:26,750
You have to train her and stuff.

902
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:29,875
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

903
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:41,375
Step down.

904
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:46,250
Watch your step.

905
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,583
You're not peeking, are you?

906
01:26:57,667 --> 01:27:00,458
Step up. There you go.

907
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,667
All right.

908
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:18,083
OK. Open them.

909
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:27,875
Wow. Did you make this?

910
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:31,042
Yep.

911
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,667
Hold on a second.

912
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:47,708
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

913
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:52,542
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler of Terabithia.

914
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,917
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

915
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,250
They've been waiting.

916
01:27:58,333 --> 01:28:00,333
Where?

917
01:28:00,417 --> 01:28:03,875
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

918
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:06,333
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

919
01:28:06,417 --> 01:28:08,708
anything you can imagine.

920
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:10,750
But you gotta look really hard.

921
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:13,708
But keep your mind wide open.

922
01:28:22,333 --> 01:28:24,167
So, what do you think?

923
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,000
Can there be purple flowers?

924
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,542
Anything you want.

925
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,500
Wow.

926
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:41,208
And a castle.

927
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:44,083
A big one, with towers and flags.

928
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:46,458
Of course.

929
01:28:49,292 --> 01:28:52,125
Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

930
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,708
Is there a king?

931
01:28:57,792 --> 01:28:59,208
Are you the king, Jess?

932
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,875
Only if you're princess.

933
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:49,792
Terabithia.

934
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,139
