1
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,350
-Who are you?
-I'm Zegue Bamba.

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,991
-Are you a witness?
- Yes.

3
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,429
Bei!

4
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,273
Would the court usher...

5
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,390
ask the gentleman to remove his hat?

6
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,474
Tell him it's not his turn yet.
He'll get his chance to speak.

7
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,432
He can wait in the courtroom.

8
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,029
Words are something...

9
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,510
They can seize you in your heart.

10
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,711
It's bad if you keep them inside.

11
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,669
You can say what you have
in your heart when the time comes.

12
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,349
Since he hasn't asked you to speak,

13
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,431
stop now and sit down.

14
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,199
It doesn't matter...

15
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,674
He says he understands.

16
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,800
The goat has its ideas
but so does the hen.

17
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,071
When you come for something,

18
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,679
you have to do it.

19
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,632
You must know
why you're here.

20
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,671
But coming and leaving
without speaking...

21
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,512
Tell him to speak to the court.

22
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,831
You haven't been asked to speak.

23
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,629
Go and sit down.
Your chance will come.

24
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,831
They're just asking you
to wait.

25
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,919
I'll give him back his word.

26
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,951
My words won't remain within me.

27
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,388
All right. Thank you.

28
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,629
Chaka...

29
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,239
Ina has atemperature.

30
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,869
Mum...

31
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,029
I'm fine.

32
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,110
I'm okay.

33
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,552
Yes, everything's fine.

34
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,871
I just have a cold.

35
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,029
She's asleep.

36
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,073
I'm coming back to Dakar.

37
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,350
The railway brought Africa
its emancipation.

38
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,234
That's the role
of labour regulations in Africa.

39
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,510
It awoke political awareness.

40
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,309
The World Bank is throwing
all that out with the trash.

41
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,439
Our identity, your identity,
our history, your history.

42
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,713
What are your feelings
when you witness this disaster?

43
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,630
I don't care...

44
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,230
You complicate things too.

45
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,108
Here, take this.

46
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,269
The hearing has resumed,
please sit down.

47
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,750
Ifyou go in, you're not filming!
No one films here.

48
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,070
Bei!

49
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,912
I'm singing late tonight.

50
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,032
- Hello, Boire, how are you?
- Hello.

51
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,910
It is stated that the share
of our states' budgets

52
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,830
devoted to social services
and to the repayment of the debt

53
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,512
is set as follows
between 1992 and 1997.

54
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,719
We have examined afew countries.

55
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,353
I shall use those examples.

56
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,630
In Kenya, when the national budget
allocated 12.6%

57
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,031
to the basic social services,
health, education

58
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,834
and infrastructure,

59
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,830
40% of that same budget was devoted
to repayment of foreign debt.

60
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,750
In Zambia, when 6.7%

61
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,680
was spent on basic social services,

62
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,668
40% was again used
to pay off the debt.

63
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,632
In Cameroon, it's even worse.

64
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,270
4% of the budget was spent
on basic social services

65
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,790
while 36% was used
to pay off the debt.

66
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,831
To take a concrete example,

67
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,919
of the 200 billion CFA francs
in Cameroon's budget,

68
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,430
only 8 billion was spent
on basic social services

69
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,589
while, at the same time, 72 billion
left the country to pay off the debt.

70
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,912
Howdo you feel about these figures

71
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,789
that are particularly disastrous
for African peoples?

72
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,432
See that policeman there?

73
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,189
He's not a good man.

74
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,873
I'm a criminologist, see.

75
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,472
You work for the police?

76
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,758
I just take photos for them.

77
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,439
When there are crimes,
murders or accidents,

78
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,868
I take photos.

79
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,752
Does this mean, in these
Burkina Faso peasants' words,

80
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,470
that Africa at last accepts
globalization

81
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,910
and simply asks that the rules

82
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,469
be fair, transparent
and valid for all?

83
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,111
The relationship is governed
by lies, hypocrisy and cynicism.

84
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,709
Everything is done to make sure

85
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,872
Africans are unaware
of the system's rapacity.

86
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,192
That is what I denounce when I say

87
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,198
the impetus is northern
but the theft is local,

88
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,231
done with our complicity.

89
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,670
I make a little money that way,

90
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,552
Iike with weddings.

91
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,751
There's another market now:.

92
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,069
funerals.

93
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,679
There's money in that.

94
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,519
The faces of people who talk
don't interest me.

95
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,039
There's no truth in them.

96
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,712
I prefer the dead.

97
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,993
They're truer.

98
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,709
Firstly, I strongly oppose the idea

99
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,749
that Africa's key characteristic
is her poverty.

100
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,790
She is the victim of her riches.

101
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,790
I would rather we talk
about pauperization

102
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,673
than poverty.

103
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,629
In talking of pauperization,
you pinpoint the mechanisms

104
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,269
and Bush is at the heart of them.

105
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,432
Bush is the conductor.

106
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,949
Therefore, I don't see...

107
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,793
why he is complaining.

108
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,710
I say that the West has created
and imposed two fears on itself:

109
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,350
terrorism and immigration.

110
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,112
Let's stay calm.

111
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,392
We must stop presenting

112
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,350
the problems' causes
as the solution.

113
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,871
Everything can be sold or bought.

114
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,953
Today, a sick woman in a village
risks dying

115
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,630
because the nurse
who has the medicine

116
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,308
won't treat her
because she can't pay.

117
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,593
That is what it has come to,
what we've learned from the system.

118
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,592
In other words, pay or die.
That's the West's lesson

119
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,711
that we inflict on ourselves.

120
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,911
And, personally, I think

121
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,750
that what Africa needs to do now

122
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,231
is to make an effort
to pull herselftogether.

123
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,431
Along with the West,
we are caught up

124
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,712
in striving for a society
that we can't attain.

125
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,229
Our public services
have been sold off.

126
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,831
We could have developed a control
system for the administrators,

127
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,358
brought the necessary pressure
to bear,

128
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,391
and denounced the profiteers.

129
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,832
We have accepted it at times.
If you had awell-placed relative,

130
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,351
you were happy
to profit from the system with him.

131
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,790
How can we take back our assets?
That's a major political issue.

132
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,199
Death is good.

133
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,353
Nothing's better than death.

134
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,992
Your suggestion
is that you pull yourself together.

135
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,034
That's afine idea,
awide-ranging and abstract idea,

136
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,832
but it isn't a programme.

137
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,913
After this first remark,
I would like

138
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,631
to take two examples
that will provide striking proof

139
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,313
that your ideas...

140
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,750
- Can you get to the point?
- Right away.

141
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,352
For instance, I have heard
Maitre Tall provide figures

142
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,439
and you have approved them.
What figures?

143
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,473
My esteemed colleague,
you said earlier,

144
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,478
"We are given 54 billion

145
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,912
"and, in actual fact,
we have to pay back 436 billion."

146
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,752
Do you know, madame,

147
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,912
that, for Mali, we plan to give up

148
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,113
the sum of 1.42 billion CFA francs

149
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,153
that represents 60% of the debt?

150
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,269
Are you aware of that fact?

151
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,791
I'm aware
of that act of deception and...

152
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,914
Madame Traore,
please address the court.

153
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,550
It was decided at Gleneagles,
during the G8 summit,

154
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,792
as part of a so-called
cancellation of the debt.

155
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,798
Firstly, we consider,

156
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,430
given the interest rates applied,

157
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,910
that Africa has paid off this debt

158
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,873
and owes nothing more
to these institutions.

159
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,800
Secondly, we say

160
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,072
that the disastrous nature
of economic policies

161
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,352
in which only borrowed money
was invested

162
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,269
without any benefit
to the people of Mali and Africa,

163
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,353
is a moral wrong
that didn't even require

164
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,431
this "good deed" by the G8.

165
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,873
But, above all, I wish to say
that this 1.42 billion

166
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,552
is not fresh money
injected into Mali's economy.

167
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,392
What we need today

168
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,913
is fresh money in order
to create jobs and to invest.

169
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,873
We haven't even
mentioned corruption yet.

170
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,188
I feel that the correct use
of our own resources

171
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,951
could safeguard us today

172
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,310
from this manipulation of opinion

173
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,510
that presents afalse cancellation
as atrue one.

174
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,198
We shall perhaps be able to save
afewbillion each year

175
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,312
as part of the debt
we're paying off.

176
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,193
But this decision has done more

177
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,109
to improve the G8's image
than to actually help Africa.

178
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,920
True, I haven't put forward
a programme

179
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,031
but that isn't my intention.

180
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,431
I would simply like
a critical mass of Africans

181
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,559
to knowmore about the reasons
why we are in this position.

182
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,594
Your Honour,
I agree with the witness.

183
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,189
Writers
don't put forward programmes.

184
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,631
And I also agree that writers

185
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,549
should denounce
what they are able to observe.

186
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,952
They can express their personal
feelings and thoughts.

187
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,630
But you abandoned
that role just now, madame.

188
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,549
You presented yourself,
on this stand, as an expert.

189
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,591
You tackled specific issues,

190
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,711
you spoke about the debt,

191
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:38,152
you said the debt impoverishes
Africa, a moot point,

192
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,830
and that its cancellation,
as you just said,

193
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,389
is of no consequence.

194
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,108
I am a citizen of this country,

195
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,991
with my feet firmly grounded
in the realities of this country.

196
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,909
Being awriter doesn't mean
I don't have a certain expertise

197
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,913
at dealing with aggressive stances

198
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,792
in an open debate

199
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,510
on issues that I experience
from the inside.

200
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,360
But this money comes with a provison.

201
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,199
It forces the hand of 18 countries

202
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,551
to make them speed up
the structural reforms

203
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,279
that benefit the North.

204
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,160
But I'm not only fighting
for subsidies.

205
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,751
I'm fighting for the possibility
for a country like Mali

206
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,074
to produce cotton if it wishes
or not, but to earn its living.

207
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,232
A living to sell what?

208
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,512
That's why this issue
goes way beyond Africa.

209
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,032
Why should the fate of people depend

210
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,672
on their ability to produce
and sell abroad?

211
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,312
China's expansion
must be integrated into the debate.

212
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,030
Your own countries tremble
before China. What will Mali do?

213
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,552
I believe that cotton production
has had its day.

214
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,474
Besides, with the prices of products

215
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,592
that come from China
and copy our textiles,

216
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,872
there is no major stake for us
in the cotton debate.

217
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,518
"ln an inevitably open world,

218
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,030
"we must civilize globalization

219
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,832
"and give it a meaning."

220
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,310
What do you think of those words?

221
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,952
Can progress be made or not
during the globalization process?

222
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,709
For example,
if the standards enforced

223
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,159
by the ILO were made general,
would that be good or bad?

224
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,433
Or would that merely
oppress the Africans even more?

225
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,913
I strongly oppose your starting
point: "the open world".

226
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,233
We don't live in an open world,
Mr Rappaport.

227
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,112
The words you just read

228
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,030
provide an eloquent answer
to the questions that you ask.

229
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,672
If globalization
needs to be improved and civilized,

230
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,440
that means it "decivilizes"
and dehumanizes.

231
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,508
Today, we see Africans
who opt for emigration,

232
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,233
who are economic refugees,

233
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,151
arrested, handcuffed, deported,
humiliated and sent back home.

234
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,790
How can you claim,
given that terrible situation

235
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,113
that shocks the whole world,
that we live in an open world?

236
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,113
It's clearly open for whites
but not for blacks.

237
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,239
I'm awitness.

238
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,791
Madou Keita isn't on the list.

239
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,229
Step back.

240
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,153
Our countries
are not imploding today

241
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,351
because, on a domestic level,

242
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,560
the women play an important role.

243
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,911
That is why they must refuse
to be imprisoned

244
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,472
within the conventional
interpretation of the situation

245
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,834
that says they are victims
of their culture, society and men.

246
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,270
The men are in trouble,
the women too.

247
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,311
We have to work together.

248
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,954
- Where's the mirror?
- Here it is.

249
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,669
Very pretty.

250
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,553
I'll do you a good price.

251
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,632
You all say that.

252
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,279
Some darker ones.

253
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,232
They're by Gucci,
an Italian designer.

254
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,799
Where's the Gucci logo?

255
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,069
It's top quality.

256
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,429
Where's the logo?

257
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,959
They're by Gucci.

258
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,752
So where's the logo?

259
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,154
Falai...

260
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,511
That's not the same policeman.

261
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,072
The one there before

262
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,672
fell asleep during the break.

263
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,991
He said his gun has vanished.

264
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,759
An officer's investigating.

265
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,553
He suspects me.

266
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,280
Raise your right hand and swear
to tell nothing but the truth.

267
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,993
What does he want?

268
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,431
We were in Morocco together.

269
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,070
He's the one we need for now.

270
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,511
You can sit down.

271
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,632
He says that he left Mali

272
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,239
to go to Spain.

273
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,389
He crossed Niger.

274
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,193
He left Niger and went to Algeria.

275
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,031
From there, he went to Morocco.

276
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,630
The Moroccans
brought us back to Oujda.

277
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,591
They made us all board atruck

278
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,111
to take us into the Sahara.

279
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,872
From there, we walked to Algeria.

280
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,270
The Algerians refused to let us in.

281
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,789
They helped us the first time,

282
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,319
but this time they didn't.

283
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,389
They opened fire on us
but the bullets didn't hit anyone

284
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,073
and we set off again.

285
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,473
There were around 30 of us.

286
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,311
We walked for seven nights.

287
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,351
We walked for aweek.

288
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,432
Without water or food.

289
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,430
Those who were sick
were soon exhausted.

290
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,269
One man couldn't go any further.

291
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,429
His young brother sat down
next to him

292
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,908
to wait for him.

293
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,599
He said, "Don't wait.

294
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,869
"Go.

295
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,549
"I can't go on,

296
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,512
"I accept death.

297
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,270
"There's no sense
in you waiting with me.

298
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,390
"Go..."

299
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,679
There was a woman with us.

300
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,433
She was from Ghana.

301
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,389
We didn't know she was a woman.

302
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,352
She was disguised as a boy.

303
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,749
She was exhausted.

304
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,234
We went over to her
to help her.

305
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,839
We couldn't do anything.

306
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,990
There were 30 of us at first

307
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,110
but only ten or so
survived without much trouble.

308
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,079
We don't knowwhere the others are.
Are they dead?

309
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,670
Are they wandering in the Sahara?
I don't know.

310
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,708
Madou Keita...

311
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,072
The reason why you left
your country,

312
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,071
was the suffering you felt.

313
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,353
Since your birth, Madou,

314
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,191
have you been to school to learn?

315
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,513
Since your birth, Madou,

316
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,549
has the state given you
the health care you need?

317
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,353
Since your birth, Madou,

318
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,990
has the state taught you atrade?
Has it found you work?

319
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,793
Has it given you money?

320
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,034
It has given me nothing.

321
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,351
Nothing.
The state has given me nothing.

322
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,350
What do you mean?

323
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,113
You're not thinking.

324
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,949
You're being unreasonable.

325
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,113
We can understand him.
Look at yourself and look at him!

326
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,912
You'll never be like them!

327
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,479
Howcan you defend them?

328
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,952
Look at yourself and look at him!

329
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,553
Until your dying day,

330
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,149
you'll never be like them!

331
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,429
Never like them.

332
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,949
You're lost for us!

333
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,229
Madame, please...

334
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,591
Let me speak.
Let me speak to this fool!

335
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,791
Look what he's doing!

336
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,119
Please, madame.

337
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,353
- He's just doing his duty.
- Let's get serious here!

338
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,790
Honestly!

339
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,831
What is this?
You're wearing us out.

340
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,640
Ifwe were alone,
you wouldn't leave unharmed.

341
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,510
I'd accept the consequences.
Enough suffering!

342
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,431
Enough suffering!

343
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,432
Enough manipulation...

344
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,472
The hearing is adjourned.

345
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,313
Saramba, will this do?

346
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,399
Hold it up to see.

347
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,359
That's good.
Rinse it and hang it out to dry.

348
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,672
You knowRaymond is dead?

349
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,029
Which Raymond?

350
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,549
The same one.

351
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,074
What was wrong with him?

352
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,269
Nothing.

353
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,753
- 140/120... That's good.
- It's good?

354
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,510
Thank you.

355
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,872
What are you looking for here,
by this streetlight's glow?

356
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,872
Have you lost something?

357
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,879
Yes, I've lost my wallet.

358
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,028
Are you sure you lost it here?

359
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,990
And now, tonight's film.

360
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,993
I'll be here tomorrow
for our news bulletin.

361
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,633
Good night.

362
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,431
Some technical problems

363
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,592
but everything will be settled
shortly.

364
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,873
I'm lost here.

365
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,672
Knowwhere the square is?

366
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,593
They don't need two teachers.

367
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,799
Spare the kids.

368
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,433
Guys...

369
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,719
I fired at one

370
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,072
and I got two!

371
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,234
What's up, guys?

372
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,233
Have you seen my soap-dish?

373
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,668
No, I haven't.

374
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,350
Mamou!

375
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,589
Take this.

376
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,833
Let's do the blue ones.

377
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,272
Do a sky blue one like this.

378
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,592
I'm off to Dakar on Sunday.

379
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,508
But without lna.

380
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,391
Tell me, what's going on
between Mele and you?

381
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,989
Nothing.

382
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,592
What do you mean, nothing?

383
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,714
You don't talk to her anymore.

384
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,912
She's the one not talking to me.

385
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,511
Nor to Mariam, either.

386
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,594
Ifyou want to sort it all out,
talk to your wife,

387
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,233
not to me.

388
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,909
All rise.

389
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,309
As social realities demand,

390
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,511
we shall take a short break.

391
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,629
Aren't there people with money
in Mali?

392
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,111
People who've enriched themselves?

393
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,669
People who are rich enough

394
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,670
and who can now create jobs

395
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,031
by founding a company
and keeping it in Mali

396
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,759
simply don't exist.

397
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,109
We have heard awitness, a mutual
insurance manager, Mr Aouitara.

398
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,431
Is that his name? Ouatara.

399
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,830
Mr Ouataratold us

400
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:37,594
that part of the money
provided by international aid

401
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,111
wasn't spent.
He didn't say it was embezzled.

402
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,790
He said it was there
and that it wasn't being used.

403
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,389
Money is provided but not used

404
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,878
even though it is vital.
Why is that?

405
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,829
I can't say anything
about Mr Ouatara's statement.

406
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,199
It's his opinion.
My viewis different.

407
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,472
It's not a matter of opinion...

408
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,280
Maitre Rappaport,
let the witness answer.

409
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,629
Yes, Your Honour.

410
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,713
Mr Keita,
actually, Maitre Rappapov...

411
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,830
Ra-ppa-port.

412
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,392
...is saying our disbursement
capacities are poor.

413
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,828
Very poor!

414
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,951
Maitre Rappaport,

415
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,510
Iet's consider
the most social fields today

416
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,673
and that are also considered
fundamental for us.

417
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,868
Education.

418
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,840
Has anyone ever seen a school built

419
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,431
using what you refer to
as financial means? No.

420
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,272
We can provide figures.

421
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,031
Let's not clutter up this debate.

422
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,752
Maitre Rappaport, he's awitness,
not the opposing party.

423
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:56,352
Occasionally, through twinning
or another form of cooperation,

424
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,073
it can come about.

425
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,031
As part of the process
of decentralization,

426
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,238
we have made a superhuman effort

427
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,349
to ease our suffering.

428
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,511
And, in these conditions,

429
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,389
all we can do
is come to terms with ourselves.

430
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,271
And break away from this system.

431
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,829
Have you read Lao-Tse?

432
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,468
Confucius.

433
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,990
I haven't read all of it.

434
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,231
I win a point. He says,

435
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,632
"He who is excessive
is insignificant."

436
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,830
We would gain in all matters
if we avoid being excessive.

437
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,513
Listening to you,

438
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,151
our African nations

439
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,354
were calm states or countries,

440
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,351
without problems, prosperous...

441
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,030
Then came the World Bank
and the lMF,

442
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,151
and we became poor

443
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,109
and we have become poorer
and poorer. Is that right?

444
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,110
These countries have known
100 years or more of colonization

445
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,590
and, with colonization over,

446
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,713
are struggling to ensure
the conditions for their development.

447
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,230
And what do they find themselves
facing?

448
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,670
An international diktat,
institutions

449
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,071
that more or less regulate
world relations.

450
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,308
I don't see howyou can describe
those countries as you just did.

451
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,878
I did inform you, professor,
that I'm no expert in this field.

452
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,230
But you've just said...

453
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,829
Our countries were characterized

454
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,550
more or less
like in Aime Cesaire's poem,

455
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,513
"The Prayer of a Negro Child".

456
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,349
The very same thing.
We've known nothing but misfortune.

457
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,551
And it's getting worse.

458
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,399
Is it absurd to imagine...

459
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,870
that this increased poverty

460
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,119
could have a cause other than
the World Bank and the lMF?

461
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,750
Well before colonization,

462
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,070
there was a country,

463
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,032
awealthy and stable country
where life was good.

464
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,990
But colonization came along
and set up what?

465
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,079
It took everything:

466
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,273
men, riches, everything.

467
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:49,109
A leading gold-producing country
where the people are poor.

468
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,711
As you can see, our women

469
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,229
don't even wear gold jewellery.

470
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,309
Can we imagine aworld without
the lMF or the World Bank?

471
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,389
Absolutely.

472
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,990
Thank you.

473
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,392
When someone dies in Africa,

474
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,789
at that person's funeral,

475
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,518
one of the questions asked

476
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,351
is whether he owes money

477
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,913
or if there is anyone
in his local community

478
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,559
who owes him money.

479
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,270
In Africa, we remind people

480
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,713
that death is better than shame.

481
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,510
The African states owe money.

482
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,393
Is it normal

483
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,353
that these people
should claim their due

484
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,991
and that you, as an expert,

485
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,791
should advise these Africans
not to pay off their debt?

486
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,870
Chaka...

487
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,273
What are you reading?

488
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,909
Falai...

489
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,354
Is there an lsraeli embassy here?

490
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,430
No.

491
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,632
One day there will be.

492
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,550
Yes, that's possible.

493
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,910
The guard will be me.

494
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,029
You're going to choke.

495
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,714
I'm sorry.

496
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,510
The question we are asking now

497
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,314
after around 45 years
of cooperation,

498
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,671
with these states and institutions,

499
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,711
is where are we exactly?

500
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,713
And we've had to wait 45 years
to realize

501
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,471
that, despite having
everything needed to achieve it,

502
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,679
the economy has never taken off
or developed over time

503
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,792
but that we're bogged down
in anti-development.

504
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,713
Malnutrition, undernourishment,

505
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,311
chronic illiteracy,
chronic unemployment

506
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,394
and even the total lack
of decent living conditions.

507
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,512
As we can see, promiscuity reigns.

508
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,870
It's impossible to describe.

509
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,639
What does this lead to?

510
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,272
The total degeneration
of the foundations

511
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,793
that represented
our society's key values.

512
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,309
To that, we need to add

513
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,071
this flood of information we receive
that only flows one way.

514
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,673
At times,
it cancels out all our efforts

515
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,950
to try to live as we really are.

516
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,509
Because even within
our imaginations, we are raped.

517
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,154
They don't just take
our resources, our work,

518
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,592
and our money,
they take our minds too.

519
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,673
We have reached the last threshold
of the human heartbeat.

520
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,911
And now, in atotally biased manner,

521
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,029
they come to observe this failure.

522
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,748
And, on observing it,
they say, "No.

523
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,470
"You must maintain libertarianism

524
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,553
"as the development mode
for your countries."

525
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,588
In other words, prevent us
from creating a payments deficit.

526
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:00,430
That presupposes that all the money
we receive must be used

527
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,309
to restore and maintain our solvency
in relation

528
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,589
to our creditors

529
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,673
and cannot be used
within the national economy.

530
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:14,194
Today, we pay out much more
than the true total of our budgets.

531
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,552
This framework of action
set up by the World Bank,

532
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,751
what effect will it have?

533
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,752
It will smother afire

534
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,991
that will continue to smoulder.

535
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,429
It's simply the fire
of imposed destitution.

536
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,350
It's the fire
of aterrible form of colonialism.

537
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:43,191
It's the fire of an unspeakable
form of exploitation.

538
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,714
It means some countries
will disappear.

539
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,993
We are barely kept
in this international system

540
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,670
and take part in it
just because we are

541
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,952
good little markets
and a source of money.

542
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,673
Today, we give everything
to North America

543
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,110
and we give everything to Europe!

544
00:56:12,604 --> 00:56:16,483
Through the rape of my imagination
and of the little space

545
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:18,834
that I could call my own,

546
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:22,923
they come to tell me
that the Negro is lazy.

547
00:56:24,204 --> 00:56:28,436
He cannot develop independently.

548
00:56:32,204 --> 00:56:37,278
But this Negro
that you are crushing to death

549
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:40,198
with your economic
and financial machinery

550
00:56:40,404 --> 00:56:43,077
Iaid the foundations
of your economy.

551
00:56:43,764 --> 00:56:46,756
And this Negro
has ensured your development.

552
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:01,284
Today, in Mali or other countries,

553
00:57:01,644 --> 00:57:04,636
if you fall ill
and you have no money,

554
00:57:07,084 --> 00:57:08,358
you're dead.

555
00:57:18,804 --> 00:57:22,353
Everything here
concerning democracy or elections

556
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,362
is nothing but a show,
a big show.

557
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:28,476
We occasionally go to vote

558
00:57:28,684 --> 00:57:30,834
but it's as if we were never there.

559
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:40,994
This external legitimacy of power
remains in place today,

560
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,914
many intellectuals have accepted it,

561
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:45,916
but I won't judge anyone.

562
00:57:46,924 --> 00:57:50,075
But each one of us
had a moment of clarity

563
00:57:50,284 --> 00:57:52,275
and then made a deliberate choice.

564
00:57:55,924 --> 00:57:59,553
Either I fully support
the true ideals of my people

565
00:57:59,804 --> 00:58:02,193
or I sell them off,

566
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,754
as many of our governments do.

567
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:07,956
That's their share of responsibility
in this.

568
00:58:10,924 --> 00:58:13,757
I think I should have stayed there.

569
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,995
Perhaps it was better for me

570
00:58:16,204 --> 00:58:20,277
than coming to work
for a corrupt Mali administration

571
00:58:20,484 --> 00:58:22,554
that has no responsibilities.

572
00:58:22,884 --> 00:58:24,875
We end up asking ourselves,

573
00:58:25,684 --> 00:58:28,073
"Why do we receive a salary?

574
00:58:29,524 --> 00:58:31,276
"For a job we don't do."

575
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:36,033
All of a sudden, we regress

576
00:58:36,284 --> 00:58:38,673
in relation to goals that we had

577
00:58:38,924 --> 00:58:41,313
or that we were attaining before.

578
00:58:41,524 --> 00:58:43,435
They've taken everything from us.

579
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:50,075
I didn't realize that poverty,
albeit imposed poverty,

580
00:58:50,324 --> 00:58:52,963
could change human nature
to this extent.

581
00:58:54,604 --> 00:58:56,754
But today,

582
00:58:57,244 --> 00:59:01,157
I may be allowed to assert that
when I step out into the street,

583
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,443
believe me,
I don't meet other Malians.

584
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:06,614
I see everything in Mali
but Malians.

585
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:11,863
A man who is hungry,
a man without health care,

586
00:59:12,144 --> 00:59:16,934
a man who is never educated
and left in total obscurantism,

587
00:59:17,184 --> 00:59:20,733
is a man who will negate himself
and be in denial.

588
00:59:21,944 --> 00:59:25,414
He's a man who will become
alienated, lost and depraved.

589
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,533
You can't come in.

590
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,815
The witness Samba Diakite.

591
01:03:44,784 --> 01:03:46,376
Your full name, please.

592
01:03:46,624 --> 01:03:48,615
Samba Diakite,

593
01:03:49,064 --> 01:03:51,862
born in Dakar, 1953.

594
01:03:52,824 --> 01:03:54,257
Hamdallaye district.

595
01:03:56,424 --> 01:03:57,095
Your profession?

596
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:02,776
Former schoolteacher.

597
01:04:04,064 --> 01:04:05,895
Former schoolteacher.

598
01:04:23,624 --> 01:04:25,376
You have nothing to say?

599
01:05:26,184 --> 01:05:28,254
Your date and place of birth.

600
01:05:28,464 --> 01:05:31,024
I was born in Bamako. I'm 52.

601
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:34,296
Do you know
who summoned you as awitness?

602
01:05:34,624 --> 01:05:36,057
Yes, the plaintiff.

603
01:05:36,264 --> 01:05:39,256
Yes, the plaintiff. African society.

604
01:05:39,504 --> 01:05:43,577
Opposite, we have international
financial institutions.

605
01:05:44,024 --> 01:05:47,175
Are you related or subordinate
in any way

606
01:05:47,424 --> 01:05:49,415
to either of the two parties?

607
01:05:49,624 --> 01:05:50,613
In no way at all.

608
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,377
Raise your right hand.

609
01:05:52,624 --> 01:05:55,616
Swear to tell nothing but the truth.

610
01:05:55,824 --> 01:05:57,655
Raise your hand and swear.

611
01:05:57,904 --> 01:05:59,178
I swear.

612
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,103
Samba Diakite...

613
01:06:02,944 --> 01:06:04,093
If you please...

614
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:24,137
But trees are vital for life.

615
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:28,783
That's true, but to run a company,
you don't need trees.

616
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:29,894
Fine...

617
01:06:30,304 --> 01:06:31,453
All right.

618
01:06:33,464 --> 01:06:35,978
When the gun vanished,
were you here?

619
01:06:36,384 --> 01:06:37,737
I was here.

620
01:06:38,984 --> 01:06:40,133
You didn't move?

621
01:06:41,144 --> 01:06:42,372
I didn't move.

622
01:06:44,944 --> 01:06:48,334
But I was told
you went out for awhile.

623
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:52,257
I went to get a spare part
from Japan Casse.

624
01:06:53,464 --> 01:06:55,375
Did you find the part?

625
01:06:56,544 --> 01:06:57,613
No, I didn't.

626
01:07:02,464 --> 01:07:04,375
Come to my office tomorrow.

627
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,377
When you add it all up...

628
01:07:17,624 --> 01:07:19,216
this money squandered...

629
01:07:22,344 --> 01:07:24,335
these public holdings sold off...

630
01:07:26,664 --> 01:07:28,973
these families ruined...

631
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:34,096
what is your feeling
about that today?

632
01:07:37,544 --> 01:07:40,217
A feeling of shame,

633
01:07:40,864 --> 01:07:42,138
of anger...

634
01:07:44,464 --> 01:07:47,854
Of anger and compassion.
Compassion for the country.

635
01:07:52,304 --> 01:07:53,817
You see villages

636
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:56,254
that lived through the railway

637
01:07:57,024 --> 01:07:59,254
and that are now obliged,

638
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:01,734
after 100 years of existence,

639
01:08:01,984 --> 01:08:05,454
that are now obliged
to move somewhere else

640
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:09,213
because the train no longer stops.

641
01:08:09,424 --> 01:08:13,258
Life came to those villages
because of the railway.

642
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,058
When those villages
are obliged to move,

643
01:08:16,264 --> 01:08:18,255
when their inhabitants,

644
01:08:18,464 --> 01:08:21,536
in order to buy food,
have to travel by donkey,

645
01:08:21,744 --> 01:08:23,496
by cart or on foot

646
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:29,135
and when the young people
who grewvegetables can't sell them

647
01:08:29,384 --> 01:08:33,423
because they used to sell
to the train's passengers,

648
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:37,015
you witness the start of an exodus.

649
01:08:37,224 --> 01:08:39,533
And when they are turned back,

650
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:42,254
the situation is distressing.

651
01:08:46,904 --> 01:08:51,136
And when you wrote
on November 4, 2002,

652
01:08:51,384 --> 01:08:53,375
to the Ministry of Transport,

653
01:08:54,224 --> 01:08:56,294
you made a serious accusation.

654
01:08:56,744 --> 01:08:59,656
In reference to the railway,
you wrote,

655
01:08:59,904 --> 01:09:02,213
"It's the victim of a conspiracy."

656
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:04,335
This accusation of conspiracy,

657
01:09:04,904 --> 01:09:07,418
I presume you have proof of it?

658
01:09:08,984 --> 01:09:13,057
What elements do you have
to back up this serious accusation

659
01:09:13,424 --> 01:09:16,496
of conspiracy against the...

660
01:09:16,744 --> 01:09:17,335
Be quiet!

661
01:09:17,584 --> 01:09:20,974
Maitre Rappaport, I have to...

662
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:22,697
Don't oblige me to...

663
01:09:22,904 --> 01:09:25,737
The witness never spoke of
a conspiracy!

664
01:09:25,984 --> 01:09:28,214
The witness spoke of a conspiracy.

665
01:09:31,744 --> 01:09:33,575
Let's refer to the statement...

666
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:36,574
I did indeed speak of a conspiracy.

667
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:37,894
In fact,

668
01:09:38,904 --> 01:09:42,135
a letter was received,

669
01:09:42,664 --> 01:09:44,256
addressed to the authorities,

670
01:09:44,504 --> 01:09:48,816
saying that if we refused
to privatize the transport system,

671
01:09:49,464 --> 01:09:52,137
the World Bank would withdraw
subsidies

672
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:54,978
for health and education in Mali.

673
01:09:55,184 --> 01:09:56,776
It was a confidential letter.

674
01:09:57,024 --> 01:10:02,656
You can't just come before a court
and say, "There's a conspiracy."

675
01:10:02,904 --> 01:10:03,973
"Howdo you know?"

676
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:05,623
"l sawa letter."

677
01:10:05,824 --> 01:10:08,463
Where's the proof of
this conspiracy?

678
01:10:08,744 --> 01:10:11,975
For example,
is the World Bank to blame

679
01:10:12,184 --> 01:10:14,778
when a manager buys ballpoint pens

680
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:18,693
and pays 1,500 CFA francs
when he can get them for 500?

681
01:10:18,904 --> 01:10:23,295
Do we truly believe the World Bank
steps in at that level

682
01:10:23,544 --> 01:10:27,776
or does the World Bank
make the manager plant trees...

683
01:10:27,984 --> 01:10:29,303
I've finished.

684
01:10:30,584 --> 01:10:32,814
Are you asking questions
or putting your case?

685
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:34,776
Your Honour, the other side...

686
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:37,333
You can plead your case later.

687
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:40,223
The other side
pretends to ask questions,

688
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:42,176
develops lines of argument...

689
01:10:42,424 --> 01:10:46,053
We're being discreet,
we hardly make any interventions...

690
01:10:46,304 --> 01:10:48,977
We nonetheless have the right to say

691
01:10:49,184 --> 01:10:52,335
that the serious accusations
brought before you

692
01:10:52,944 --> 01:10:55,412
must be backed up
by evidence.

693
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:59,333
One should be attacking
those responsible.

694
01:10:59,584 --> 01:11:03,054
Your Honour,
you asked questions earlier

695
01:11:03,264 --> 01:11:07,496
that showyou have
afewideas and some information

696
01:11:07,704 --> 01:11:11,583
about the reasons
for the railway's collapse.

697
01:11:15,544 --> 01:11:17,296
Maitre Bourdon, please.

698
01:11:19,784 --> 01:11:21,854
I'm not seeking your approval,

699
01:11:22,104 --> 01:11:25,574
I'm trying to drawyour attention
to some simple points.

700
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:29,055
Why would the World Bank
want Mali

701
01:11:29,304 --> 01:11:31,135
to be deprived
of a means of communication

702
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:35,816
and why would it want her inhabitants
to be unable to travel?

703
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,493
A country

704
01:11:48,944 --> 01:11:51,504
without a means of communication,

705
01:11:51,944 --> 01:11:55,573
without energy, without transport,

706
01:11:55,784 --> 01:11:58,537
cannot really be called
a sovereign nation.

707
01:12:00,424 --> 01:12:02,733
And those are precisely the areas

708
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:06,454
that the multinational companies
wish to take from us.

709
01:12:07,584 --> 01:12:08,733
That's the case

710
01:12:08,944 --> 01:12:10,935
and we must not let it happen.

711
01:12:11,144 --> 01:12:12,623
It's hard...

712
01:12:13,944 --> 01:12:15,935
but I'm more optimistic than hell.

713
01:12:16,384 --> 01:12:19,615
I knowwe can do it.
We just need to get organized.

714
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:23,773
Fode!

715
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:25,093
Turn it off.

716
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:28,855
Your Honour, in relation...

717
01:12:30,104 --> 01:12:32,174
to this witness, may I petition...

718
01:12:32,424 --> 01:12:34,574
Petition in relation to...

719
01:12:47,624 --> 01:12:48,534
Jean-Paul...

720
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:54,056
I have a dream every night
that bothers me.

721
01:12:54,744 --> 01:12:56,063
What's your dream?

722
01:12:57,944 --> 01:12:59,457
Jean-Paul, I dream...

723
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,853
I'm in the darkness...
the light...

724
01:13:03,064 --> 01:13:05,214
In any case, I'm not at home.

725
01:13:06,544 --> 01:13:07,693
In this dream,

726
01:13:08,504 --> 01:13:10,096
I'm sitting down
and in front of me

727
01:13:11,104 --> 01:13:13,174
there's a big bag.

728
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:15,263
It's full of the heads

729
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:17,017
of heads of state.

730
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:22,015
Each time I dip my hand into it,

731
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,095
I pull the same head out.

732
01:13:27,184 --> 01:13:29,573
And when I put it back,

733
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,974
my dream ends and I wake up.

734
01:13:36,024 --> 01:13:38,254
Is it a black head or not?

735
01:13:40,344 --> 01:13:42,938
I don't know if it's black or white.

736
01:13:43,144 --> 01:13:45,294
In any case, it's the same head.

737
01:13:51,304 --> 01:13:53,693
Don't tell anyone else
about this dream.

738
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:00,577
Don't talk about it again.

739
01:14:03,384 --> 01:14:05,773
That's not howit works legally.

740
01:14:07,984 --> 01:14:10,134
Maitre Bourdon is giving you lessons
in procedure!

741
01:14:11,624 --> 01:14:13,023
It's a debate, not a lesson.

742
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:14,452
The witness,

743
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,823
after taking the oath
to tell the truth,

744
01:14:18,544 --> 01:14:21,183
says that she happened
to come across

745
01:14:21,384 --> 01:14:24,023
a letter clearly
not addressed to her,

746
01:14:24,224 --> 01:14:26,533
that she should never have seen,

747
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:28,735
and so read the said letter.

748
01:14:28,984 --> 01:14:30,975
It's incredibly cynical,

749
01:14:31,264 --> 01:14:34,574
yet typical
of the Bank's general cynicism,

750
01:14:34,904 --> 01:14:38,738
to say,
"Madame, you must be joking.

751
01:14:38,944 --> 01:14:41,253
"That letter can't have existed.

752
01:14:41,464 --> 01:14:44,297
"And if you had it,
you should have copied it

753
01:14:44,544 --> 01:14:46,057
"and sent it to the press."

754
01:14:46,304 --> 01:14:47,976
But she would have risked

755
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:51,734
years and years of imprisonment,
as you well know.

756
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:53,775
- It's a risk...
- A huge risk!

757
01:14:53,984 --> 01:14:56,498
She cannot play Antigone
for eternity.

758
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:00,094
For the moment,
nothing challenges the credibility

759
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,854
of this embarrassing testimony.

760
01:15:03,064 --> 01:15:05,624
Maitre Bourdon,
the lawsays each party

761
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:08,657
must provide evidence of its claims.

762
01:16:00,904 --> 01:16:04,692
So why are you looking here
and not over there?

763
01:16:10,544 --> 01:16:13,138
Because it's too dark over there.

764
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,536
You can't see anything.

765
01:17:41,664 --> 01:17:42,983
The other day,

766
01:17:43,384 --> 01:17:46,933
you were saying
that the worst after-effect

767
01:17:47,144 --> 01:17:48,816
of structural adjustment

768
01:17:49,024 --> 01:17:52,414
was the destruction
of the social fabric.

769
01:17:53,184 --> 01:17:55,175
This whole part has been erased.

770
01:17:55,424 --> 01:17:57,016
Can you start again?

771
01:17:59,144 --> 01:18:00,463
Howdid that happen?

772
01:18:02,104 --> 01:18:04,618
I must have recorded
the trial over it.

773
01:18:04,824 --> 01:18:07,896
Too many cassettes. I get confused.

774
01:18:16,424 --> 01:18:17,937
No one will listen.

775
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:22,692
Don't waste your time.

776
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:55,413
I don't know
if we must share that honour

777
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:56,983
but, in any case,

778
01:18:57,544 --> 01:19:00,854
it's a great responsibility for us.

779
01:19:01,264 --> 01:19:03,573
We knowthat the audience,

780
01:19:04,224 --> 01:19:06,055
as is only natural,

781
01:19:06,264 --> 01:19:09,574
all the lay-offs and the outcasts
who are here,

782
01:19:09,784 --> 01:19:11,934
who have described their suffering,

783
01:19:12,144 --> 01:19:14,533
wholly support the plaintiff.

784
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:18,373
And we have clearly perceived
that the court's feelings

785
01:19:18,624 --> 01:19:21,934
are not that far removed
from those of the plaintiff.

786
01:19:22,664 --> 01:19:25,383
And so it's a great responsibility.

787
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:30,096
You claim
the international institutions,

788
01:19:30,304 --> 01:19:34,695
the World Bank, the lMF
and others you have named,

789
01:19:35,224 --> 01:19:38,057
are deaf and blind.

790
01:19:38,464 --> 01:19:39,897
Deaf and blind

791
01:19:40,104 --> 01:19:43,574
and, if we follow
the reasoning and arguments

792
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:45,615
that I have heard here,

793
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:47,143
murderers too.

794
01:19:47,504 --> 01:19:50,894
Murderers even with premeditation...

795
01:19:51,664 --> 01:19:54,178
since we are reproached

796
01:19:55,344 --> 01:19:59,815
with incidents that are real
and that we deplore.

797
01:20:00,304 --> 01:20:02,534
Infant mortality is on the rise

798
01:20:02,984 --> 01:20:04,212
in Africa.

799
01:20:04,824 --> 01:20:08,214
This is an attack
on those who will come after us.

800
01:20:08,744 --> 01:20:10,257
Do you believe,

801
01:20:11,584 --> 01:20:14,144
that for international institutions,

802
01:20:14,344 --> 01:20:17,336
those are the results that we seek?

803
01:20:17,584 --> 01:20:20,052
Do we really want

804
01:20:20,664 --> 01:20:24,703
life expectancy
in regions of Africa

805
01:20:24,904 --> 01:20:28,738
to drop and fall below
the age of 50 years?

806
01:20:29,104 --> 01:20:33,416
People die of diarrhoea in Africa,
people die of malaria

807
01:20:33,664 --> 01:20:37,373
and we're not responsible.
But they die of those things.

808
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:42,175
Someone has said medicine is in
the North and the sick in the South.

809
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:45,774
Even if we were guided
by pure self-interest,

810
01:20:45,984 --> 01:20:49,897
we could not possibly
seek such goals.

811
01:20:50,104 --> 01:20:53,813
But that is howthings are.
We knowit and we knowwhy

812
01:20:54,024 --> 01:20:57,096
because we have worked

813
01:20:57,304 --> 01:20:59,374
in partnership with governments

814
01:20:59,624 --> 01:21:02,457
to assess the situation
and to decide

815
01:21:02,704 --> 01:21:04,456
what needs to be...

816
01:21:04,664 --> 01:21:07,736
All the same,
we need to raise an issue

817
01:21:08,624 --> 01:21:10,615
that not only concerns Africa

818
01:21:11,224 --> 01:21:14,853
but that is particularly detrimental
to Africa.

819
01:21:15,064 --> 01:21:17,976
I am talking about corruption.

820
01:21:18,424 --> 01:21:21,336
"Corruption isn't
a natural disaster,

821
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:24,576
"it is cold
and calculated pillaging."

822
01:21:24,904 --> 01:21:27,134
Far be it from me to claim

823
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:30,456
that corruption is rife
solely in Africa.

824
01:21:30,864 --> 01:21:35,176
We knowfull well that in the West,
large companies,

825
01:21:35,544 --> 01:21:37,614
Total and oil,

826
01:21:37,824 --> 01:21:40,213
Thales and arms policy,

827
01:21:40,424 --> 01:21:43,416
are caught up
in the cycle of corruption.

828
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:47,213
But allowme to say
that there is a difference.

829
01:21:47,424 --> 01:21:48,413
What is it?

830
01:21:48,624 --> 01:21:51,696
Corruption in Africa,

831
01:21:51,904 --> 01:21:55,055
given the state
of economic development...

832
01:21:55,304 --> 01:21:58,774
In the West we must fight corruption
and defeat it

833
01:21:59,024 --> 01:22:01,697
but its impact
on economic development

834
01:22:01,904 --> 01:22:03,496
is less serious than in Africa.

835
01:22:04,504 --> 01:22:06,335
This trial's becoming annoying.

836
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,136
When is it going to end?

837
01:22:13,984 --> 01:22:15,417
No one can say.

838
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:24,617
And nowthe polar icecap is melting.

839
01:22:24,864 --> 01:22:27,014
And the water will flood out.

840
01:22:27,224 --> 01:22:30,375
What will remain of the icecap
in afewdecades?

841
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:34,777
People have trouble breathing
in some of our big cities.

842
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:38,215
Aren't those common interests

843
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,977
to be managed together?

844
01:22:40,224 --> 01:22:44,775
We cannot avoid
dealing with these issues.

845
01:22:45,024 --> 01:22:46,935
At the same time,

846
01:22:47,184 --> 01:22:50,335
we are witnessing
the proliferation of weapons.

847
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:53,377
What will become of us if, one day,

848
01:22:53,944 --> 01:22:55,696
a potentate somewhere

849
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:59,613
gains access to the atom bomb?
Is that truly impossible?

850
01:22:59,864 --> 01:23:02,697
And there's another danger.

851
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:04,377
We've all referred to it.

852
01:23:04,584 --> 01:23:07,894
It crosses all continents
and has struck them all.

853
01:23:08,104 --> 01:23:12,177
One of the elements feeding it
is poverty.

854
01:23:12,384 --> 01:23:16,696
Terrorism is a danger not only
for Africa but for all of us.

855
01:23:16,944 --> 01:23:18,377
We want to fight it.

856
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:21,735
And the fight against terrorism
cannot succeed

857
01:23:21,944 --> 01:23:23,935
without the defeat of poverty

858
01:23:24,184 --> 01:23:26,334
and without giving hope in life

859
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:29,217
to those who have lost it today.

860
01:23:31,504 --> 01:23:34,143
Thank you, Maitre Rappaport.

861
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,182
But, before going on,

862
01:23:37,424 --> 01:23:39,654
I would like to ask you...

863
01:23:39,864 --> 01:23:42,253
Do you consider this court biased?

864
01:23:43,864 --> 01:23:46,856
Your words seemed to indicate...

865
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,414
Your Honour,

866
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:51,775
prior to being magistrates,
you are men and women

867
01:23:51,984 --> 01:23:54,737
and you are clearly sensitive

868
01:23:54,944 --> 01:23:57,936
in particular to the suffering
of your people

869
01:23:58,184 --> 01:24:00,857
whose causes and reasons
you are aware of.

870
01:24:01,064 --> 01:24:04,773
And when you see them,
expressing themselves before you,

871
01:24:04,984 --> 01:24:09,535
your heart suffers
and your thoughts are with them

872
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:12,463
rather than with us.
I do not consider that

873
01:24:12,664 --> 01:24:15,224
to be an abnormal bias.

874
01:24:19,784 --> 01:24:21,536
Are you Chaka's wife?

875
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:23,093
Why?

876
01:24:23,904 --> 01:24:26,577
I just have a few questions
to ask you.

877
01:24:27,064 --> 01:24:29,862
If it's about the gun,
I don't knowanything.

878
01:27:59,704 --> 01:28:03,697
It is clearly a great honour
to defend African society.

879
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:06,577
It is a great honour to defend

880
01:28:06,784 --> 01:28:09,935
millions of women and men of honour

881
01:28:11,184 --> 01:28:14,813
who have been represented superbly
over the last fewdays

882
01:28:15,144 --> 01:28:19,103
and who have come to say
that the world, since its creation,

883
01:28:19,584 --> 01:28:21,734
has always made sure

884
01:28:22,144 --> 01:28:25,375
that the part of the world
that suffers and endures

885
01:28:25,824 --> 01:28:28,054
is kept quiet and remains quiet.

886
01:28:30,224 --> 01:28:33,853
For Africato remain silent
in her suffering,

887
01:28:34,424 --> 01:28:36,335
that requires watchdogs.

888
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,655
It requires prison guards at times.

889
01:28:39,464 --> 01:28:42,774
Watchdogs, in other words
the American empire

890
01:28:43,024 --> 01:28:45,777
and its accomplices
in Europe and elsewhere.

891
01:28:46,064 --> 01:28:49,852
It requires Dr Diafoiruses,
Dr Strangeloves

892
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:53,614
who drawup prescriptions
that Africans "cannot read"

893
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:55,416
and "never follow".

894
01:28:55,904 --> 01:28:58,976
Prescriptions
of so-called magic potions

895
01:28:59,184 --> 01:29:03,416
that soon turn out to be poisons
with a remarkable effect,

896
01:29:03,624 --> 01:29:06,775
Chinese poisons... And maybe
the Chinese will start too,

897
01:29:06,984 --> 01:29:08,417
making evil absolute.

898
01:29:10,384 --> 01:29:11,533
As a result,

899
01:29:12,064 --> 01:29:16,376
I believe your court can easily
declare the World Bank guilty,

900
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:19,417
with its accomplices.

901
01:29:20,144 --> 01:29:22,612
After all,
the situation is terrifying.

902
01:29:23,944 --> 01:29:27,823
The figures are murderous
and the statistics homicidal!

903
01:29:29,184 --> 01:29:33,063
We simply need to look back
at the last 20 years

904
01:29:33,264 --> 01:29:34,936
of structural adjustment.

905
01:29:35,304 --> 01:29:39,695
These plans have caused destruction
and impoverishment.

906
01:29:41,024 --> 01:29:44,255
The figures provide
eloquent information

907
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:46,773
on the tragedy taking place.

908
01:29:46,984 --> 01:29:50,135
Life expectancy has dropped
to the age of 46.

909
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:52,614
The Aids crisis is manipulated

910
01:29:52,824 --> 01:29:54,894
to conceal that mortality rates

911
01:29:55,384 --> 01:29:58,057
are on the rise
because of their link

912
01:29:58,264 --> 01:30:01,574
to the important
and significant fall

913
01:30:01,784 --> 01:30:03,934
in average income in Africa.

914
01:30:04,144 --> 01:30:05,623
So the party's over.

915
01:30:06,064 --> 01:30:08,976
The party's over and the
structural adjustment plans

916
01:30:09,224 --> 01:30:11,135
have failed wholesale.

917
01:30:11,944 --> 01:30:14,742
50 million African children

918
01:30:14,944 --> 01:30:17,697
are scheduled to die
over the next five years.

919
01:30:18,504 --> 01:30:22,463
Three million are scheduled to die
of malaria next year.

920
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:26,663
In the face of such tragic figures,
one will say

921
01:30:26,904 --> 01:30:30,135
that the World Bank and the others
have won.

922
01:30:31,264 --> 01:30:34,062
We cannot say it
and we won't say it.

923
01:30:34,424 --> 01:30:38,212
We shall avoid saying it
because structural adjustment

924
01:30:38,424 --> 01:30:41,575
has clearly placed Africa
in a vicious circle,

925
01:30:41,824 --> 01:30:43,303
an absurd circle

926
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:47,736
that begins, as we have
clearly seen, with the debt!

927
01:30:48,384 --> 01:30:50,773
The debt is a stone
around Africa's neck,

928
01:30:51,104 --> 01:30:54,414
the slave's sign of
allegiance to his master.

929
01:30:54,624 --> 01:30:56,694
The figures speak for themselves.

930
01:30:56,904 --> 01:31:00,135
$220 billion in 2003.

931
01:31:00,344 --> 01:31:03,256
The latest statistics have shown,

932
01:31:03,464 --> 01:31:05,614
Your Honour,

933
01:31:05,824 --> 01:31:09,055
even though $4
has been paid back per African,

934
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:11,573
$4 remains to be paid.

935
01:31:11,784 --> 01:31:14,173
It is clear that this debt

936
01:31:14,904 --> 01:31:17,054
has brought Africato her knees

937
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:20,296
by depriving her
of her financial sovereignty,

938
01:31:20,504 --> 01:31:23,337
by dismantling her civil service.

939
01:31:24,344 --> 01:31:27,416
It has forced her
to sell off her public services

940
01:31:27,664 --> 01:31:29,894
to serve financial predators.

941
01:31:30,144 --> 01:31:34,695
It has razed some of her hospitals
to the ground.

942
01:31:34,944 --> 01:31:38,653
It has privatized her school system

943
01:31:38,864 --> 01:31:42,743
through the lowwages
paid to civil servants.

944
01:31:43,024 --> 01:31:46,653
It has brought Africato her knees,
making her the gloomy mirror

945
01:31:46,864 --> 01:31:50,254
of what the world is becoming:
a privatized world.

946
01:31:50,464 --> 01:31:52,534
And in this privatized world,

947
01:31:53,304 --> 01:31:57,092
the World Bank, in theory humane,
has become inhumane!

948
01:31:57,904 --> 01:32:01,817
The World Bank
has become an inhumane bank

949
01:32:02,024 --> 01:32:05,414
because it is the Trojan horse
of financial capitalism.

950
01:32:05,624 --> 01:32:08,536
Of course, one will say

951
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,855
that the corruption

952
01:32:12,144 --> 01:32:15,375
is shared
by the Africans and the Europeans.

953
01:32:15,624 --> 01:32:17,774
But does the defence dare to assert

954
01:32:18,144 --> 01:32:20,055
that Africans invented corruption?

955
01:32:20,304 --> 01:32:23,216
Is there a chromosome of corruption
in Africa?

956
01:32:23,544 --> 01:32:25,023
Remember the corruptors

957
01:32:25,224 --> 01:32:28,694
come from rich countries,
never from poor ones.

958
01:32:28,904 --> 01:32:33,614
The G8 and the World Bank,
after bringing Africato her knees,

959
01:32:33,864 --> 01:32:38,415
are nowthreatening to suspend
all public aid to Africa

960
01:32:38,624 --> 01:32:40,774
because corruption is rife here.

961
01:32:40,984 --> 01:32:44,613
The circle is complete,
confusing causes and consequences.

962
01:32:44,824 --> 01:32:46,416
Murder thus reveals

963
01:32:46,784 --> 01:32:50,174
its sinister side,
the World Bank's cynicism.

964
01:32:51,064 --> 01:32:53,214
Far be it from us, Your Honour,

965
01:32:53,464 --> 01:32:56,774
to claim that the World Bank
feeds on African children

966
01:32:57,024 --> 01:33:00,858
or that it hates
drinking water and public railways!

967
01:33:01,424 --> 01:33:04,063
The World Bank isn't governed

968
01:33:04,864 --> 01:33:06,377
by murderous instincts.

969
01:33:08,104 --> 01:33:11,176
But the World Bank
is simply the cornerstone,

970
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:15,775
the centre of gravity of
this unchained form of capitalism,

971
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:19,175
financial capitalism,
predatory capitalism,

972
01:33:19,384 --> 01:33:23,775
capitalism ignoring general
interests to attain its key goals:

973
01:33:23,984 --> 01:33:26,817
the production of profits
for all eternity!

974
01:33:27,944 --> 01:33:32,335
The World Bank occasionally tries
to appear more humane

975
01:33:33,184 --> 01:33:37,894
and I shall give you an example
of its attempts to be more humane.

976
01:33:38,344 --> 01:33:42,178
A fewdays ago in Paris,
crying crocodile tears, who said?

977
01:33:42,384 --> 01:33:45,694
"Every week, 200,000 sick children
aged under five

978
01:33:45,944 --> 01:33:47,855
"die in developing countries."

979
01:33:48,104 --> 01:33:49,696
Paul Wolfowitz said that.

980
01:33:49,904 --> 01:33:53,533
Paul Wolfowitz,
the man behind the war in lraq

981
01:33:53,744 --> 01:33:58,135
that costs more than
providing water to all Africa

982
01:33:58,384 --> 01:34:01,376
and saving Aids victims
with generic drugs.

983
01:34:01,624 --> 01:34:04,934
He's the man who pretended to weep

984
01:34:05,144 --> 01:34:07,704
at a symposium in Paris
afewweeks ago.

985
01:34:07,904 --> 01:34:10,213
Let's end this hypocritical dance.

986
01:34:10,424 --> 01:34:13,143
Let's end
this cursed predatory dance.

987
01:34:13,344 --> 01:34:16,142
Let's consider
the World Bank's arguments.

988
01:34:16,464 --> 01:34:19,297
There seems to be a curse on Africa.

989
01:34:21,224 --> 01:34:24,296
Europe holds up aterrifying mirror
to Africa

990
01:34:24,544 --> 01:34:28,583
that pollutes people's minds
and stifles crucial awareness.

991
01:34:28,944 --> 01:34:30,536
Is Africa doomed?

992
01:34:30,744 --> 01:34:33,542
Is poverty as natural
as tropical genocide,

993
01:34:33,744 --> 01:34:35,894
slavery and neo-colonialism?

994
01:34:36,144 --> 01:34:38,533
You also find this fatality
in the idea

995
01:34:38,784 --> 01:34:40,297
of an ignorant Africa.

996
01:34:40,544 --> 01:34:43,263
What did we hear the other day?

997
01:34:43,464 --> 01:34:45,932
When Madame Souko had the nerve

998
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:50,296
to say she could read a balance
sheet, they called her an upstart!

999
01:34:50,504 --> 01:34:54,975
The Africans knownothing about
the complexities of this world!

1000
01:34:57,544 --> 01:34:59,057
Since they knownothing,

1001
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:03,657
all criticism is considered
unfounded.

1002
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:07,015
Yet we have heard it
bravely expressed here.

1003
01:35:10,384 --> 01:35:11,533
So, yes!

1004
01:35:11,864 --> 01:35:17,018
You will declare the World Bank
guilty of abusing the African people.

1005
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:19,693
You'll declare the World Bank guilty

1006
01:35:20,304 --> 01:35:22,534
of failure to render assistance.

1007
01:35:22,784 --> 01:35:25,856
You'll declare the World Bank guilty

1008
01:35:26,104 --> 01:35:29,653
of not respecting its mandate
to serve mankind.

1009
01:35:29,864 --> 01:35:30,774
In doing that,

1010
01:35:32,744 --> 01:35:35,053
you'll open the path to the utopia

1011
01:35:36,424 --> 01:35:38,415
that each one of us has in mind

1012
01:35:38,664 --> 01:35:41,974
and allows us to imagine a newworld
beyond the hills.

1013
01:35:42,224 --> 01:35:46,854
This utopia is, in away,
the African ram

1014
01:35:47,744 --> 01:35:52,534
that comes to rub against
and rip the pants

1015
01:35:52,744 --> 01:35:55,133
of reasons of state and the market!

1016
01:35:55,584 --> 01:36:00,055
Utopia, tomorrow, to avoid
what is under way in the suburbs

1017
01:36:00,304 --> 01:36:02,772
of Accra, Abidjan and Cairo

1018
01:36:02,984 --> 01:36:05,373
where children drunk on deprivation

1019
01:36:05,624 --> 01:36:07,933
could turn into balls of fire
tomorrow.

1020
01:36:11,744 --> 01:36:14,383
You'll declare the World Bank guilty

1021
01:36:14,584 --> 01:36:17,098
and force it to become more humane.

1022
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:19,295
You'll declare it guilty

1023
01:36:19,504 --> 01:36:22,143
of the crimes of inhumanity
and cynicism

1024
01:36:22,344 --> 01:36:23,823
committed over 20 years.

1025
01:36:24,864 --> 01:36:26,695
The only sentence possible

1026
01:36:27,664 --> 01:36:29,336
is the most modest sentence,

1027
01:36:30,104 --> 01:36:31,617
the most clement one.

1028
01:36:32,104 --> 01:36:34,664
We can't throwWolfowitz
in the Niger.

1029
01:36:34,864 --> 01:36:36,855
The caimans wouldn't want him.

1030
01:36:38,184 --> 01:36:40,937
The sentence
that we request of you...

1031
01:36:47,664 --> 01:36:52,135
Community service for mankind
for all eternity.

1032
01:37:05,264 --> 01:37:08,973
I am honoured to appear
before this court

1033
01:37:09,664 --> 01:37:13,577
and to lend my robes to defend
a noble and fair cause,

1034
01:37:13,944 --> 01:37:18,017
but above all to lend my voice
to Africa's silent majority

1035
01:37:18,264 --> 01:37:22,337
that has been subject for 25 years
to the iron law of adjustment,

1036
01:37:22,544 --> 01:37:26,423
the law of the strongest
that has never been the best.

1037
01:37:27,024 --> 01:37:30,494
Yes, Your Honour,
adjustment is an evil,

1038
01:37:30,704 --> 01:37:33,013
an organized and structured evil

1039
01:37:33,224 --> 01:37:36,216
administered and inoculated
to our people.

1040
01:37:36,464 --> 01:37:40,013
This evil, Your Honour,
is the cynicism of the debt,

1041
01:37:40,224 --> 01:37:42,863
the vicious circle of the debt.

1042
01:37:43,064 --> 01:37:46,693
This debt that has ruined
our economies

1043
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:51,256
and that has sapped our energy
before we have finished paying it.

1044
01:37:51,464 --> 01:37:54,183
What must we do,
faced with the debt's violence?

1045
01:37:54,504 --> 01:37:56,415
I hear the Latin Americans.

1046
01:37:56,624 --> 01:37:58,455
They told us, Your Honour...

1047
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:02,535
"The debt can't be paid."

1048
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:06,493
Yes, it cannot be paid
because it is illegitimate.

1049
01:38:06,744 --> 01:38:08,735
Because it is violent.

1050
01:38:08,984 --> 01:38:12,897
It cannot be paid
simply because it is untenable.

1051
01:38:13,624 --> 01:38:16,536
On top of the debt's violence,
we witness

1052
01:38:16,784 --> 01:38:19,776
the selling off
of our public services,

1053
01:38:20,024 --> 01:38:22,333
our basic social services...
Privatization!

1054
01:38:23,224 --> 01:38:26,136
The health service
has been privatized

1055
01:38:26,504 --> 01:38:29,735
but between June and September 2005,

1056
01:38:29,984 --> 01:38:34,535
42,000 people died of cholera,
a mediaeval disease

1057
01:38:34,784 --> 01:38:38,094
that was thought
to have been eradicated here.

1058
01:38:38,544 --> 01:38:40,535
We don't need to look far.

1059
01:38:40,744 --> 01:38:44,896
Here, in this room,
a patient lies suffering.

1060
01:38:45,144 --> 01:38:46,623
Do you hear his moans?

1061
01:38:47,264 --> 01:38:50,336
I've heard them.
And we're privatizing health!

1062
01:38:50,544 --> 01:38:53,377
And that's not all!
We're privatizing education,

1063
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:55,974
a universal right.

1064
01:38:56,184 --> 01:39:00,735
The acquisition of knowledge
should be the same for all

1065
01:39:01,144 --> 01:39:04,295
but two thirds of our children
are illiterate

1066
01:39:04,504 --> 01:39:07,735
and nowwe're being asked to pay
to acquire knowledge!

1067
01:39:08,344 --> 01:39:12,974
That's not all! Our public services
have been sold off.

1068
01:39:13,984 --> 01:39:16,054
Water has been privatized.

1069
01:39:16,304 --> 01:39:19,023
The Joliba, Senegal,
Zambezi, Limpopo!

1070
01:39:19,224 --> 01:39:20,737
Our rivers privatized!

1071
01:39:20,944 --> 01:39:23,253
With our stories,
legends and traditions

1072
01:39:23,464 --> 01:39:26,536
buried in the current,
rivers and lakes!

1073
01:39:26,784 --> 01:39:28,615
That's inadmissible.

1074
01:39:28,864 --> 01:39:32,743
This people is awidow
mourning the death of a husband

1075
01:39:32,944 --> 01:39:35,663
buried under the ruins
of adjustment.

1076
01:39:35,864 --> 01:39:39,095
This people is an orphan
crying for a mother

1077
01:39:39,344 --> 01:39:40,663
who died in childbirth.

1078
01:39:40,864 --> 01:39:45,096
All it asks for is its due:
basic health care.

1079
01:39:45,344 --> 01:39:49,735
This people is afather,
made redundant by the railway,

1080
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,815
these men you have heard,

1081
01:39:52,024 --> 01:39:54,743
these women who have pleaded
on your stand.

1082
01:39:55,024 --> 01:39:58,096
The father who has seen
his authority,

1083
01:39:58,304 --> 01:40:01,535
who has seen his influence
and his dignity

1084
01:40:01,784 --> 01:40:05,777
weakened and swept away
by an unfair redundancy.

1085
01:40:05,984 --> 01:40:09,454
This people, Your Honour,
is Zegue Bamba.

1086
01:40:09,664 --> 01:40:13,213
Have you heard, Your Honour,
Zegue Bamba's lament?

1087
01:40:13,424 --> 01:40:17,303
This peasant who asks,
"Why don't I sowanymore?

1088
01:40:17,504 --> 01:40:19,415
"When I sow, why don't I reap?

1089
01:40:19,624 --> 01:40:21,615
"Why don't I eat when I reap?"

1090
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:24,776
This Africa, Your Honour,

1091
01:40:25,024 --> 01:40:28,573
is asking you with dignity,
humility and modesty,

1092
01:40:28,824 --> 01:40:30,655
but with legitimacy, for justice.

1093
01:40:30,864 --> 01:40:33,332
You must do justice to Africa.

1094
01:40:33,544 --> 01:40:37,583
You must not do this
by condemning the World Bank.

1095
01:40:37,784 --> 01:40:40,856
You will achieve it, Your Honour,

1096
01:40:41,104 --> 01:40:44,335
by forcing the World Bank,
the lMF, the WTO and the G8,

1097
01:40:44,544 --> 01:40:46,455
along with their accomplices,

1098
01:40:46,704 --> 01:40:48,296
to respect their mandate

1099
01:40:48,504 --> 01:40:51,496
that they should never
have forgotten, with man

1100
01:40:51,864 --> 01:40:54,537
as the goal of all humane action.

1101
01:40:55,064 --> 01:40:57,134
It's your responsibility, sir,

1102
01:40:57,384 --> 01:41:00,376
since your pen
will be signing the ruling.

1103
01:41:00,624 --> 01:41:03,218
It's mine too,
through the robes I wear.

1104
01:41:03,424 --> 01:41:06,814
And we're all responsible
because it's our duty as a generation

1105
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:09,897
to bring about the advent
of that day

1106
01:41:10,144 --> 01:41:14,376
for the balance of the world
and of man's future is at stake.

1107
01:48:59,304 --> 01:49:01,534
"My ear to the ground,

1108
01:49:01,784 --> 01:49:04,617
"I heard tomorrow pass by"

1109
01:52:00,304 --> 01:52:03,853
