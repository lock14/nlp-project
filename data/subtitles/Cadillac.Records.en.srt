1
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,143
<i>Now when I was a little boy</i>

2
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,344
<i>At the age of five</i>

3
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,731
<i>I had somethin' in my pocket</i>

4
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,518
<i>Keep a lot of folks alive</i>

5
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:11,855
<i>Now I'm a man</i>

6
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>Made twenty-one</i>

7
00:01:15,525 --> 00:01:17,326
<i>And you've got
to know, baby</i>

8
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:20,162
<i>We can have a lot of fun</i>

9
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:24,799
<i>I'm a man</i>

10
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,954
<i>I spell "M"</i>

11
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:30,789
<i>"A"</i>

12
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:33,334
<i>"N"</i>

13
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:35,462
<i>Man</i>

14
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:38,465
<i>A full-grown man</i>

15
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,216
<i>Lover man</i>

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,354
<i>Go on now</i>

17
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,725
<i>Take it easy now</i>

18
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,957
I'm Willie Dixon.

19
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:09,461
And I'm making this
here audio recording

20
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:13,081
so that when you visit
Chess Recording Studio,

21
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,265
you know the history.

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,806
Now, the first time a gal took off her
underwear and threw them on stage

23
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:22,717
it was on account of
a fella singing the blues.

24
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:25,594
Now, when the white
girls started doing it,

25
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,563
they called that
rock and roll.

26
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:32,519
Took a whole lot of people to make
the music that changed the world.

27
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:35,737
Yes, sir. This story
ain't just about me.

28
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,329
It all started
with two men.

29
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,700
One a white boy
from Chicago.

30
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,204
Len, when are
we getting married?

31
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,956
<i>A witness for my Lord</i>

32
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,959
The other a sharecropper
from Mississippi.

33
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,771
<i>Say, who was a witness</i>

34
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,548
The year was 1941.

35
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:05,217
<i>Say, Daniel was a witness</i>

36
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:08,805
When are we getting married?

37
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,239
I don't have the money.

38
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,860
I told you I'd b
e fine without it.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,862
Well, I wouldn't.

40
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,366
You don't know what
it did to my father.

41
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:25,872
I can't watch
you go hungry.

42
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:39,918
Da.

43
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,643
Oh, how you doing,
Mr. Feder?

44
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,061
Hi, Dad.

45
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,350
I want to marry her.

46
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,372
Mr. Feder,
I don't know if I told you,

47
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,777
but I've been making plans to
get out of the junk business.

48
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,780
I'm gonna open
a club here.

49
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:12,050
In the Negro neighborhood?

50
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,336
Yeah.
It's gonna be for Negroes.

51
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,588
You're taking Shelly
to Negro clubs?

52
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:20,759
No, of course not.

53
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,726
No, I'm just...

54
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,182
I'd like you to know that I'm
making plans for the future.

55
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,800
So, you are serious
about this marriage then?

56
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,851
Yeah.

57
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,853
I mean,
when I can afford it.

58
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,358
Your father and I, we come from
the same shithole in Poland.

59
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:39,744
I didn't travel
all this way

60
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:43,649
to have my daughter marry some
schmuck from the same village.

61
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,451
What did you say?

62
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,987
- What did you say?
- Get in.

63
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:50,490
Leonard.

64
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,959
Don't worry
where I'm from.

65
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,413
My wife's gonna
drive a Cadillac.

66
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,646
Now, who is this here?

67
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,266
Go on,
get in the house now

68
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,312
- McKinley Morganfield?
- Yes, sir?

69
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:49,012
I'm Alan Lomax,

70
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,550
and this is Mr. John Work
from Fisk University.

71
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,444
- How you doing?
- Fine. You?

72
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:57,557
I'm recording folk music
for the Library of Congress

73
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:59,024
Folk music?

74
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:03,562
Could you move into the mike
a little bit for me? Thanks.

75
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,648
Play that thing, man.

76
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,471
<i>I get later on
in the evenin' time</i>

77
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:30,937
<i>I feel like</i>

78
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,439
<i>Like blowin' my horn</i>

79
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,108
That's what
I sound like, huh?

80
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,064
Yes, sir,
that's what you sound like.

81
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,401
<i>Later on in the evenin', baby</i>

82
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:47,038
<i>I feel like,
like blowin' my horn</i>

83
00:06:47,072 --> 00:06:50,576
Feel like I'm meeting
myself for the first time.

84
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,000
And he was. And he knew it
was a man he was meeting,

85
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:01,254
too big for that slave
shack he was born in

86
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,622
and too big for
that plantation.

87
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,709
<i>Some folks say
they worry</i>

88
00:07:06,744 --> 00:07:09,427
<i>Worry blues ain't bad</i>

89
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,547
<i>That's a misery
feelin' child</i>

90
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:15,050
<i>I most, most ever had</i>

91
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:23,274
Now, the acoustic guitar
was fine down south,

92
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:28,648
because there's nothing but miles
of empty fields out your window.

93
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:33,819
But in the city, with all them
streetcars and automobiles,

94
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,322
you couldn't get
yourself heard.

95
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,961
Hey, boy, ain't nobody want to
hear that sharecropping music

96
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,997
Take that shit back down
there to Mississippi.

97
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,853
Hey.

98
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,889
You're disturbing the peace!

99
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,865
Why you want
to cut me for, girl?

100
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,237
You have been giving that
same smile to girls all morning.

101
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,322
You must have three
addresses in your pocket.

102
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:11,824
Addresses?

103
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,043
No.

104
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,201
- You're trouble. You know that?
- I know.

105
00:08:20,237 --> 00:08:21,533
How about you?

106
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:38,850
You got to go, before my mama
brings the boys home. Come on.

107
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,334
- Maybe those boys need a daddy.
- You're not daddy material.

108
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,527
I'm not good enough for you?

109
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,201
I don't talk as good as
you or something, huh?

110
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:59,288
When I heard you start
playing that music

111
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:02,408
it took me someplace
so good, Muddy.

112
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:03,909
So good.

113
00:09:07,629 --> 00:09:09,548
Here you go, baby.

114
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,619
Are you the owner
of this club?

115
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,587
Yes, I am.

116
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,292
Isabella Allen.
I make race records.

117
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,128
Len Chess.
How you doing? Wow.

118
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:01,517
This is a beauty.
God, look at the lines on this thing.

119
00:10:01,552 --> 00:10:03,817
It's incredible.

120
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,688
You can buy a car like this
making race records?

121
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,240
If you find the right singer.

122
00:10:09,274 --> 00:10:12,528
Hey, I'd love to know
if you hear someone special.

123
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,063
A record producer, huh?

124
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,234
There'd be something
in it for you.

125
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,201
All right.

126
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,989
Sweet.
That's a beautiful car.

127
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:25,073
You looking for girls?

128
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,461
Excuse me?
No, I'm opening a club.

129
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:31,496
I don't mind you getting
men all liquored up

130
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:34,049
but I lost two daughters
to bluesmen.

131
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:36,552
Dangerous business you in.

132
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,320
What are you doing?

133
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:58,490
When Muddy met Little Walter,
he was just 17 years old,

134
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:02,077
but he was the greatest
harp player that ever lived.

135
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,947
That's it.
That's all of it.

136
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:11,102
- Yeah, man.
- Play that for me.

137
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:21,846
I'll give you $1 if you let me
strum that guitar.

138
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,466
I can busk more
than your dollar.

139
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,974
- I'll give you $2.
- You a headhunter?

140
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,355
You fixing to chop my head
off with my own guitar? Man.

141
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:32,107
Shit, you can't play
better than me.

142
00:11:32,143 --> 00:11:34,143
Let me see the guitar, man.

143
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:18,821
Hey, big guy, your daddy
sure can cook, huh?

144
00:12:18,855 --> 00:12:21,440
You're not gonna
take care of Walter?

145
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,956
Oh, I don't drink none of that.

146
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,745
Good for you, Walter.
I'll make you a nice bath.

147
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,746
Okay, thank you, ma'am.

148
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:29,629
Why you got a gun?

149
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:33,971
- In case in any good guys need shooting.
- You mean the bad guys?

150
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,124
I is the bad guy.

151
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,628
Hush now, scaring my boys,
and let me hear some of that harp.

152
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:44,129
Okay, okay.

153
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:56,725
Wait. Wait.
Wait. Wait.

154
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,254
- Where in the hell you going?
- Follow me now. Come on.

155
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:02,528
No, no, no. No, look here.
You follow this guitar, son.

156
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:03,532
"Son"?

157
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,004
You can play the shit out of that guitar,
so I'll follow you anywhere you want...

158
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,159
but don't you ever be
calling me no "son. "

159
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:15,823
Okay?

160
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:20,062
- I don't need no daddy.
- No, boy, what you need is a mama.

161
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:23,085
Someone who will feed
you and clothe you

162
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,754
and tell you to get
your behind in that bath

163
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:28,466
Well, you know
what they say, now.

164
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,143
A man can't have
too many mamas.

165
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,513
And you don't need this.
You need soap.

166
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,687
He fit me, Geneva.

167
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,690
I heard.

168
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:48,793
He fit me.

169
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,663
They was a family now.

170
00:13:51,246 --> 00:13:54,250
Little Walter, Muddy Waters
and Jimmy Rogers

171
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:57,217
called themselves
"The All-Star Trio,"

172
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,798
but everybody else knew
them as "The Headhunters"

173
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:04,342
on account of how they
sliced their competition.

174
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,928
Will you help me out here?

175
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:17,036
- Get your own gig, motherfucker!
- Let them play!

176
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,827
- Get out of the way, Mud.
- Fucking son of a bitch!

177
00:14:44,053 --> 00:14:45,717
This is between me and this motherfucker.
Get out the way, Mud.

178
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:48,254
- Son... - I told you never
to be calling me that.

179
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,173
I know you did.
But we family now.

180
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:52,591
Then what the
fuck you doing, Mud?

181
00:14:53,057 --> 00:14:54,592
Give me that pistol

182
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,693
I ain't trying to boss you.

183
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,979
But you're just
too good to lose.

184
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:03,519
We'll burn Chicago down if you don't
get your ass locked up or killed.

185
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:06,767
- You think I never used this before?
- I know you did.

186
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,024
Then you know I'll shoot this
whole motherfucker up then.

187
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,609
But you ain't got
to use it tonight.

188
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,077
If he foolish enough
to come after you

189
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:15,246
I'll put the bullet in
him my damn self.

190
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,289
You a crazy motherfucker, Mud.

191
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:27,057
Run, motherfucker!
Run!

192
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:29,143
You can get out of here, too.

193
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:31,129
I'll talk this peckerwood
into not calling the police

194
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,181
Oh, okay.

195
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,683
Sorry about that, chief.

196
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:41,322
Sorry about the damage, boss.

197
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,859
Yeah, you fucked up
my place. You...

198
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:46,361
Yes, sir.
It's a damn shame, boss.

199
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:48,447
Just get out.

200
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,818
Here.
There you go.

201
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,071
Appreciate it.

202
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:59,991
Fucked up my shit.

203
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,687
Ain't never see them pitchers?
Here's how you do it.

204
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:07,821
When you get that ball,
you gonna kick that leg over.

205
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:10,918
You gonna throw that thing
way up there like that.

206
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:13,221
Been looking
all over for you.

207
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,283
We're just here
working, sir.

208
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:17,807
I thought we was
all right, boss.

209
00:16:17,842 --> 00:16:21,346
Stop talking to me like I'm
some damn plantation owner.

210
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,849
What the fuck
you want then?

211
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,418
I want to put
you on a record.

212
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,488
- A record?
- Yeah, that's right.

213
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:31,006
You're kidding.

214
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,490
No, sir, boss.

215
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:38,697
Let me get this
straight now.

216
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,749
We shoot up half
your whole joint,

217
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,034
and now you want to
put us on a record.

218
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,085
Yeah, that's right.

219
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,772
I hear good things
about you.

220
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,009
- When do you want to do this?
- Right now. The studio's booked.

221
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:53,981
- But I got to get my band.
- No, you don't.

222
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:56,548
Not the crazy harp-playing motherfucker,
you don't. No. Just you.

223
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,134
You want to do this?

224
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,352
- Yeah.
- Come on. Studio's booked.

225
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,272
<i>Well,
I'm going away to leave</i>

226
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:05,655
<i>Won't be back no more</i>

227
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,692
<i>Going back down south,
child...</i>

228
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,948
Now, Leonard Chess didn't
worry none about skin color.

229
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:15,734
It was the color of them
bills that mattered.

230
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,487
Just get you enough
green to cover yourself

231
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:21,573
and then you ain't
no Jew-boy no more.

232
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,393
And you ain't no
colored boy either.

233
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:26,711
You're just a man
with a Cadillac.

234
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:28,830
It's so beautiful!

235
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:33,790
- Do we have enough?
- Hi, baby. Stop with the "enough. "

236
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:36,417
This is America.
The word is "more. "

237
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:38,006
I like the way
your husband thinks.

238
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,356
You must be Muddy.

239
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,061
I'm Revetta.
I love your record.

240
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,982
Thank you.
Pleasure to meet you.

241
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:52,520
I packed for a week.
Will that be enough?

242
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:54,021
Yeah, that ought
to be good.

243
00:17:54,522 --> 00:17:58,277
I think she's asking,
how long are you gonna be gone.

244
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,171
Come here. Hey.

245
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,029
Close your eyes.

246
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,202
A little friend to keep you
company while I'm gone.

247
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:10,204
There you go.

248
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:16,583
- Can we afford this?
- Don't worry about it. It's classy.

249
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:18,046
Thank you.

250
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,134
I tell you,
that's a whole lot of ocean

251
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,096
Take a hell of a lot
to get me to cross it.

252
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:29,557
How come you didn't stay
your ass in Poland?

253
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,645
How come you didn't stay
your ass in Mississippi?

254
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:41,260
Len knew the only way
to make it big was radio.

255
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:44,906
And that meant taking
Muddy back down South.

256
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,857
- Thank you very much.
- The man don't need no more Scotch.

257
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,007
I got a hell of a mortgage.

258
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:03,973
Shit.

259
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,010
Yeah, I got one of those.

260
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,730
I tell you what.
Throw this record on the table.

261
00:19:08,765 --> 00:19:10,065
It pays off everybody's.

262
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,030
Leonard...

263
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:15,153
If people buy Muddy's record,
I got to make more.

264
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,488
Then I'm into you
every month.

265
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,525
Yeah, but I got
to be fair, you know.

266
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,361
I know you got to be fair.

267
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,914
The motherfuckers bring in the
Glenfiddich and the Johnnie Walker.

268
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:29,883
But you got to ask yourself,

269
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:33,172
do they really stand up
to Jackson and Grant?

270
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,773
I don't bribe deejays.

271
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,776
I do.

272
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,779
You realize he doesn't
care about your music.

273
00:19:58,815 --> 00:20:00,747
It's just about
the money with him.

274
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:04,286
Everybody, this is the newest
race music right out of Chicago.

275
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,788
You're on your own.

276
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:22,804
Now, in the South, whites and coloreds
didn't ride around in the same car

277
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,423
unless the colored man
was chauffeuring.

278
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:28,224
Fuck Mississippi police.

279
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,261
<i>Well,
I'm going away to leave</i>

280
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,897
<i>Won't be back no more</i>

281
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:37,685
<i>Going back down south,
child don't you wanna go</i>

282
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:39,688
You got to bless them.

283
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:43,155
- All right, easy. Thank you.
- Hey, you gotta bless them.

284
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,044
- It's very good.
- Room service.

285
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,669
Well, hello.

286
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,896
- We heard you on the radio.
- Come on in.

287
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,845
No, he don't bite.
And I don't either.

288
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,883
Play it, Daddy.

289
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:10,384
Yeah.

290
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,605
Don't rush it.

291
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:19,111
Don't step on it now.
That's Chicago's heartbeat.

292
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:21,195
Go on, now.

293
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,969
You've got such hair.

294
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:29,438
Play that for me, Daddy

295
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,423
I lied to you, girl.

296
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,375
Yeah, I like that.

297
00:21:37,878 --> 00:21:41,916
- Where you going? Don't leave us alone.
- I'll swing one over your way.

298
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,217
I'm married.

299
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:46,672
Yeah,
and they ain't redhead.

300
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,759
- That's bullshit.
- Mmm-hmm.

301
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,265
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, Daddy. Come on back.

302
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,267
Preacher lay his Bible down.

303
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,906
We're coming straight to
you from down in the Delta

304
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,912
with Muddy Waters
and his hit record.

305
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:13,222
That's right.
Sunshine, how you doing?

306
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,380
I want to say a big hello,
if I can,

307
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,467
to everybody down
in Coahoma County.

308
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:21,373
They got a whole mess of bluesmen
working Mississippi fields.

309
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,875
When I was out there
I used to sing...

310
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,378
<i>Time don't get no better</i>

311
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:30,346
<i>Up the road I'm going</i>

312
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:34,219
So, you know, I want to thank
old Len Chess here for

313
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:35,854
giving Muddy Water
a chance to shine.

314
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,404
Does that mean you're
staying where you are?

315
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,058
Because I know some labels down
here who'd love to snap you up.

316
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:43,854
Well, they can try
all they want to,

317
00:22:43,888 --> 00:22:46,579
but I belong to
the Chess family.

318
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,900
We're gonna play a little something
from Muddy Waters right now.

319
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,500
Lay it on me.

320
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,538
It was kind,
what you said on the radio.

321
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,540
You know,
starting a business together,

322
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,542
it is like
starting a family.

323
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,244
Appreciate that.

324
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:05,217
Yeah, well, how come,
then, you need me to sign this thing?

325
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,588
That's what people
do in business.

326
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:16,526
You know, you got
a power with that guitar.

327
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,147
Amazing. It even put three
women in your bed last night.

328
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,398
Yeah, but you married.

329
00:23:22,433 --> 00:23:25,653
I like another kind of broad.
Does that bother you?

330
00:23:25,689 --> 00:23:27,621
What's that
gonna bother me for?

331
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:31,410
I'm just saying, it doesn't make me
like them. And that's not me.

332
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,077
I'm not that.

333
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,997
Who is you?

334
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,284
Sign the contract and find out.

335
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,002
You got a pen there?

336
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,552
All right.

337
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:46,590
This is the newest race music
right out of Chicago.

338
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,595
And I want you to
remember this name.

339
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,847
Muddy Waters.

340
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:56,351
The last time I signed something
like this, I got married.

341
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:58,353
Well, that's what this is.

342
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,555
Till death do us part.

343
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,061
By the way,
the car's yours.

344
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:12,111
- What do you mean?
- You earned it.

345
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,502
Muddy!
Listen!

346
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:34,506
Now playing Muddy Waters'
Can't Be Satisfied,

347
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,007
WGES Chicago.

348
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,509
It's you!

349
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,012
- Come on in here.
- No! I got to go to work!

350
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,282
- Come on in, Mama.
- Muddy, don't! Muddy!

351
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:48,019
<i>Don't you want to go?</i>

352
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,569
<i>Woman I'm troubled</i>

353
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:53,607
<i>I be all worried in mind</i>

354
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,663
<i>Well, baby,
I just can't be satisfied</i>

355
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:01,916
<i>And I just can't keep
from cryin'</i>

356
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,252
On a Sunday night,

357
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,205
when no one happened
to be in Len's club,

358
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:12,176
the Macomba mysteriously
burned down.

359
00:25:16,597 --> 00:25:19,065
Hi, Daddy.

360
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:22,103
He put the insurance money
into this here recording studio.

361
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,557
Hi.

362
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,063
Hi, baby. Hi, there.
How you doing?

363
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,481
Look.
It's coming along, huh?

364
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:40,340
- We're late on our mortgage
again, Len. - Yeah.

365
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:44,479
- It's gonna have to wait.
- You're gambling our home.

366
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:49,240
- Yeah. And we're gonna win big.
- And if we don't?

367
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:53,835
I won't let you down, babe.

368
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:56,051
I won't let you down.

369
00:25:56,086 --> 00:26:00,781
- Dave, show her the... Spin the thing.
- Sure thing.

370
00:26:00,817 --> 00:26:01,675
You see this?

371
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,900
Chess Records was the
best studio in Chicago.

372
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,986
Had a sound
nobody could touch.

373
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,487
Tie me up.
Come on.

374
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:22,027
- Did everybody see?
- You guys better watch out now.

375
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:24,332
Little Walter
getting electrified!

376
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,800
He's amplifying
a fucking harmonica.

377
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,338
Wait, Chess.
Let him try it Watch it now.

378
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:33,951
- All right. Go ahead.
- Take one.

379
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:38,179
<i>Forty days
and forty nights</i>

380
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:42,182
<i>Since my baby
left this town</i>

381
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:46,688
He's blowing all over Muddy's vocals.
I got to cut.

382
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:49,405
No, hold on.

383
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,893
<i>But the rain
keep coming down</i>

384
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,415
<i>She my life,
I need her so</i>

385
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,536
<i>Why she left
I just don't know</i>

386
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,121
Let it ride.

387
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:04,739
You can't record a record with
harmonica all over the place.

388
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:05,789
Yeah, we can.

389
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,375
<i>Forty days...</i>

390
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,758
Okay.

391
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:11,211
<i>and forty nights</i>

392
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:13,664
<i>Since I set
right down and cried</i>

393
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,570
<i>Keep raining all the time</i>

394
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:22,840
<i>But the river running dry</i>

395
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:30,396
<i>Lord help me,
it just ain't right</i>

396
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,933
<i>I love that girl
with all of my might</i>

397
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,940
It works.

398
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,759
Now that's a record.

399
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,576
- You like that?
- Yeah.

400
00:27:44,612 --> 00:27:46,448
Walter got a record.
Let's lay it down.

401
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:49,332
- Oh, yeah?
- You want to hear?

402
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,667
Why don't you and
Jimmy back him up?

403
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:54,955
You caught me on a good day.
Where's Belo at?

404
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,590
Take one.

405
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:26,237
Boss, this your new shit?

406
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,256
Yeah.
You like it, huh?

407
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,035
- Go park it, motherfucker.
- What?

408
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,243
Park it at your house.

409
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,249
Oh, Jenny,
you see this shit?

410
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,250
Wait till these
motherfuckers see me now.

411
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:44,302
- You my white daddy?
- You're getting carried away again.

412
00:28:44,337 --> 00:28:47,726
Man, oh, man. Oh, boy.
Black folks riding around in Cadillacs.

413
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,259
Feel like I died
and gone to heaven.

414
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,727
Walter, this is Willie Dixon.

415
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:52,355
He's gonna write
some songs for us.

416
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,715
- How you doing?
- I like what you do with that harp, man.

417
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,732
- Wrote a killer song for you.
- You did?

418
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,269
I know how the girls love you so much.
It's called My Babe.

419
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:02,773
My Babe? This is my babe right here.
Come on, girl.

420
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:05,777
Hey, Len, I wrote
a song for Muddy, too.

421
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:08,278
Oh, yeah?
Muddy don't need no help.

422
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:10,280
Oh, man. I admit
he's good and everything,

423
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:14,035
but, I mean, all his songs
sound the damn same.

424
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:17,288
Muddy Waters needs something
that shows him off.

425
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,207
Well, we'll see what you got.

426
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,295
Here's your riff right there.

427
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,881
Ain't nothing to that.

428
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:31,102
<i>Gypsy woman
told my mother</i>

429
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,105
<i>Before I was born</i>

430
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:39,159
<i>You got you
a boy child coming...</i>

431
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:42,697
Now Muddy was Muddy
way before I came along.

432
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,998
I just took his persona

433
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:49,536
and put it in words that
everybody could understand.

434
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,124
I mean, it was simple.
He was the cat every man wanted to be

435
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,626
and every woman
wanted to love.

436
00:29:56,627 --> 00:29:58,294
And Muddy,

437
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:01,215
well, he just kept
growing into that man.

438
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,553
<i>Everybody knows I'm him</i>

439
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:13,728
<i>Well, you know I'm
the hoochie coochie man</i>

440
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,848
<i>Everybody knows I'm him</i>

441
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,156
<i>I got a black cat bone</i>

442
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,410
<i>I got a mojo, too</i>

443
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,913
<i>I got the Johnny conkeroo</i>

444
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,000
<i>I'm gonna mess with you</i>

445
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,369
<i>I'm gonna make you girls</i>

446
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:42,957
<i>Lead me by my hand</i>

447
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:47,227
<i>Then the world will know...</i>

448
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:51,240
People started realizing that
if you can play the guitar

449
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:55,458
and sing your ass off,
you could be badder than Superman.

450
00:30:55,492 --> 00:30:59,641
And that was a strong feeling
for a black man in the '50s.

451
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,148
How you doing, darling?

452
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,292
<i>On the seventh hour</i>

453
00:31:19,042 --> 00:31:21,412
<i>On the seventh day</i>

454
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:24,298
<i>On the seventh month</i>

455
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,919
<i>Seven doctors say</i>

456
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,256
<i>He was born for good luck</i>

457
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,808
<i>That you'll see</i>

458
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,538
<i>I got seven hundred dollar</i>

459
00:31:38,573 --> 00:31:41,182
<i>Don't you mess with me</i>

460
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,573
I'm about to lay this down
right now, boss. I'm ready.

461
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,163
You're messing up
my groove, boss.

462
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,788
Who dead?

463
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:06,958
Your mother.

464
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,460
Your family called a deejay
down in New Orleans.

465
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,962
They've been trying
to find you.

466
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:16,467
Maybe you need to take
a little time off.

467
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,105
What am I supposed
to do with that, boss?

468
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,892
Go home and
bury your mother.

469
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:28,229
Walter.

470
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,231
Y'all ready?

471
00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:33,201
Shit.

472
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:38,871
I was in my groove, man.

473
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:40,907
Now I can't even find my shit.

474
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:46,748
Go home. Nobody's expecting
you to go back in there.

475
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:48,333
I'm expecting it.

476
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:53,837
You know how many harp players out
there are waiting to chop my head?

477
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,358
Not time to be wasting
on this woman.

478
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,347
That ain't "that woman. "
That's your mama, boy.

479
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,767
What the hell I know
about mamas?

480
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:11,772
She let my daddy give me
away the day I was born.

481
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:15,076
Well, she did the best
she could, I reckon.

482
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:17,612
That's why this here
be my mama.

483
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:21,615
This here, right here.

484
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:23,000
You know, Walter.

485
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,920
You and me not gonna wake up every
morning and get everything we want.

486
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:28,887
Mostly we got to
take what come.

487
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:32,426
And half the time, that's gonna
be a bunch of bullshit.

488
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,017
Yeah. I just got to get
my mind back right.

489
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,720
Go on and have you a taste.

490
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,467
I don't need that.
That shit'll fuck me up.

491
00:33:45,664 --> 00:33:48,051
- Go on, boy.
- It's gonna fuck me up, man.

492
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:49,359
Cool you out.

493
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,449
Just a taste, huh?

494
00:33:57,951 --> 00:33:59,453
Fuck it.

495
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:16,003
<i>My baby don't stand
no cheating, my babe</i>

496
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:20,224
<i>Oh, yeah, she don't
stand no cheating</i>

497
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:23,393
<i>My babe</i>

498
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,929
<i>Oh, yeah,
she don't stand no cheating</i>

499
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:29,398
<i>She don't stand none
of that midnight creeping</i>

500
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,686
I can't record this if he
handles the mike like that.

501
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:33,653
Don't worry about it.

502
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,786
We're playing
Little Walter's My Babe.

503
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,461
Number one on
the charts this week.

504
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:45,833
Little Walter was making
a name for himself.

505
00:34:46,032 --> 00:34:47,916
Every club on
the chitlin circuit

506
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:53,173
wanted that sharp,
swinging jump boy in the Cadillac.

507
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,126
Now, ain't that sure enough
a goddamn shame?

508
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,494
- What is that? - A big-time recording
artist like Little Walter

509
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:04,050
driving around in that broken-down,
no-account short.

510
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:07,822
- Let me out.
- Hold on, son.

511
00:35:08,972 --> 00:35:11,108
What is he doing now?

512
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,146
"Little Walter and the motherfucking
Jukes," huh? Ain't this some shit?

513
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:19,117
Say, now, which one of you
motherfuckers is Little Walter?

514
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:20,617
I am, fool.

515
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,871
Okay.

516
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:28,074
Bring your ass over here!

517
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,217
Motherfucker taking
money out of my pocket.

518
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:38,219
So what?
He's stealing your gigs.

519
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:40,304
He's stealing my name.

520
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:42,054
Shit.

521
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:46,561
<i>My baby don't stand
no cheating, my babe</i>

522
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:51,315
<i>Oh, no, she don't
stand no cheating</i>

523
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,233
<i>My babe</i>

524
00:35:54,268 --> 00:35:57,396
<i>Oh, no, she don't
stand no cheating</i>

525
00:35:57,431 --> 00:36:00,525
<i>Everything she do

526
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,041
<i>My baby...</i>

527
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,829
It was 1955 and
we was hooked.

528
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:11,001
On the music, on the cars,
on the women, on the life, baby.

529
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,418
Oh, Lord,
we had hot hands!

530
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:17,500
<i>...she don't stand
no fooling, my babe</i>

531
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:21,510
<i>Oh, yeah,
she don't stand no fooling</i>

532
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:25,257
<i>When she's hot,
there ain't no cooling</i>

533
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:28,719
<i>My babe,
true little baby, my babe</i>

534
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,257
<i>- True little baby
- She's my baby</i>

535
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:41,286
<i>- True little baby

536
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,166

00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,652
<i>- True little baby

00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:49,206
<i>True little baby</i>

539
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,708
<i>True little baby</i>

540
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,661
<i>True little baby</i>

541
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,797
<i>True little baby</i>

542
00:36:57,831 --> 00:37:02,300
Hey, Mud.
I want you to meet Wolf.

543
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:05,222
Yeah, I hear we're
from the same place.

544
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,057
Is that right?

545
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:10,969
Yeah,
Wolf just signed with us.

546
00:37:11,005 --> 00:37:12,811
Yeah.
Welcome to Cadillac Records.

547
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:16,434
You stay around long enough,
everybody get one.

548
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:18,436
Well, this old truck...

549
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,938
I own it.

550
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,824
It don't own me.

551
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,579
Listen, I want to offer
you a $100 advance.

552
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,166
I don't borrow
against the store.

553
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:35,085
You just pay me
what you owe me.

554
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:36,704
That's fair enough.

555
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:39,472
Nice meeting y'all.

556
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,626
Take care of yourself, baby.

557
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,353
"It don't own me. "

558
00:37:54,387 --> 00:37:56,474
Motherfucker thinks
he goddamn John Wayne.

559
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:58,858
He can sing, though.

560
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:01,394
He gonna have to, because he
ain't getting the women on style.

561
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:04,898
Any royalties come in from
Hoochie Coochie Man?

562
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:06,900
I already gave that to you.

563
00:38:07,902 --> 00:38:09,869
How you figure?

564
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:12,206
The Cadillac ain't free, Mud.

565
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,626
Right.

566
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,713
You need money?

567
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,550
Well, Geneva want a house.

568
00:38:26,836 --> 00:38:28,755
I'll take care of it.

569
00:38:29,757 --> 00:38:31,257
All right.

570
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:35,179
<i>All you pretty women</i>

571
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:37,931
<i>Stand in line</i>

572
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,233
<i>I can make love
to you, baby</i>

573
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,320
<i>In an hour's time</i>

574
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:46,773
<i>Ain't that amazing?</i>

575
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,512
Where that baby come from?

576
00:39:11,014 --> 00:39:13,134
A woman came by today.

577
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,652
She said she's yours

578
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:19,690
She said she couldn't
take care of her anymore

579
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,192
That's my baby?

580
00:40:06,353 --> 00:40:08,856
She's gonna need milk.

581
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,451
I'll go on and get the milk.

582
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,755
<i>I'm a man</i>

583
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,259
<i>I spell M...</i>

584
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:41,054
This here be a real nice home
you're making, Geneva.

585
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:44,557
Thank you, Walter.

586
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:48,896
That's why Muddy can go out
there and fetch the world.

587
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:51,398
He's got big dreams.

588
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:53,400
Here, let me help you.

589
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:58,079
- There, go ahead...
- What about you, though? Come on.

590
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,001
You ain't got
no dreams, girl?

591
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:03,409
Somebody's got to have their
feet firmly planted on the ground.

592
00:41:03,445 --> 00:41:06,378
That's you, huh?
That's you?

593
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:09,382
Well, I say you take
them off the ground.

594
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,384
Taking care of
all these kids.

595
00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:14,922
You know, you gone and made
a place for me to lay my head.

596
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:17,389
Now, come here, now.
Stop for a minute.

597
00:41:17,423 --> 00:41:19,927
Stop for a minute, now. Come here.
Play with me. Come on.

598
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:21,596
Come on.
Come on.

599
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,195
Have a seat.
Come on.

600
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,150
Kick your feet up now.
Here go your drink.

601
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:31,989
It's nice, right?

602
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,994
Who be taking care of you?

603
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,617
I see you running around her
taking care of everybody.

604
00:41:44,652 --> 00:41:45,619
You know?

605
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,123
Who take care of Geneva?

606
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,918
- Walter.
- What? What?

607
00:41:56,954 --> 00:41:59,490
- I'm Muddy's woman.
- He got a lot of women.

608
00:42:00,134 --> 00:42:02,135
He can spare one, huh?

609
00:42:04,637 --> 00:42:07,106
I'm sorry.
I know.

610
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:10,108
I know I'm a motherfucker.
I know.

611
00:42:10,143 --> 00:42:13,547
You got no idea. I can't help
myself. I want to...

612
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:16,951
I just want to see you happy, Geneva.
You know?

613
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:19,452
Let me make you happy, baby.

614
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,960
I love him.

615
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:30,463
You have no idea...

616
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:34,467
how good that man
has been to me.

617
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,427
I'm half a woman, Walter.

618
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,934
I can't have
any more babies.

619
00:42:53,436 --> 00:42:57,942
I can't give Muddy
any children of his own.

620
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,909
- Don't cry, baby. Don't cry.
- No.

621
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,951
Don't ever talk to me
about any of his other women.

622
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,219
Ever.

623
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,452
Okay.

624
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,523
Hey, Geneva.

625
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:15,092
Hey, baby.

626
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,097
You must be hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

627
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,719
Yeah.

628
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,748
What, you ain't hungry?

629
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,840
He ain't hungry.

630
00:44:03,389 --> 00:44:05,009
You ain't hungry?

631
00:44:08,094 --> 00:44:10,731
You ain't eat nothing.
What, you ain't hungry?

632
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:15,184
- Son?
- Muddy.

633
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:21,692
You ain't hungry?
Son?

634
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,260
- Muddy, he's just a kid!
- You better know I know it.

635
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:28,246
I'll put a motherfucking
lacing on you, boy.

636
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:31,835
Now, you better go on somewhere
and sleep it off. You hear me?

637
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,619
<i>Oh, smokestack lightning</i>

638
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,121
<i>Shining...</i>

639
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:10,588
Cut.

640
00:45:10,623 --> 00:45:12,326
You on the guitar,
what's your name?

641
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,760
Hubert, sir.

642
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,161
"Hubert"?

643
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:17,628
Walter, behave yourself.

644
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:19,983
- Motherfucker's name is Hubert.
- Shut up.

645
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:22,302
Who do you think you are,
playing that loud?

646
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:25,054
Yeah, lower the amp, not the guitar.
The amp.

647
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,056
Get it right, Hubert.

648
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,726
Don't talk to him no more.

649
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:34,362
I'm the band leader.

650
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,434
Reckon you ain't never
worked with one before.

651
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,436
You want something done,
you ask me.

652
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,322
I'm gonna tell him
what he has to be doing.

653
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,326
Is that right?

654
00:45:47,827 --> 00:45:49,128
That's right.

655
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:53,000
Only thing you can do. That's a mean
motherfucker right there. Shit.

656
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,585
Get it right.

657
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:58,922
- All right, big man.
- Go and get your coat.

658
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,554
Okay, then.

659
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,989
Take two.

660
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:05,561
Hey, baby.

661
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,311
Why don't you stay
for a while?

662
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,932
Better get your girl
out of the ring.

663
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:24,278
<i>Oh, smokestack lightning</i>

664
00:46:24,313 --> 00:46:28,318
No, that's all right.
You can have her, baby.

665
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,820
But she come with this.

666
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,561
- He can't hear you, Mud.
- I guarantee you he hear me.

667
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,518
<i>Oh!
Tell me baby</i>

668
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:51,056
Hey, Jimmy, come here.

669
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,644
I want you to tell Hubert we'll pay
him twice what Wolf's paying him.

670
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:56,695
If he's such a band leader,

671
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,483
we'll see if he's band leader
enough to hold onto his boy.

672
00:47:01,934 --> 00:47:05,454
He was the big, bad wolf.

673
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,867
Now, the story is he got
his name from a dead man

674
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:12,367
who came out the cemetery
and tuned his guitar.

675
00:47:12,402 --> 00:47:15,833
And he been howling
at the moon ever since.

676
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:19,335
<i>Oh, stop your train</i>

677
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,840
<i>Let a poor boy ride</i>

678
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,344
<i>Whoa,
don't you hear me crying?</i>

679
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,503
- You all right?
- Couldn't you get a smaller set?

680
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,277
- You all right?
- Hurry up, man.

681
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,556
- I don't want to miss this game, now.
- Oh, baby!

682
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,112
I love this house.

683
00:47:46,148 --> 00:47:48,327
- You got it.
- Sorry, Jimmy.

684
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,536
Y'all can't come in here.

685
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,036
I'm Chuck Berry.

686
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,489
Chuck Berry's
a country-and-western singer.

687
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:00,293
Is he?

688
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,996
You know who else he is?
He's me.

689
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,226
Says he's Chuck Berry.

690
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,565
Let me see some ID.

691
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,568
All right, then.

692
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:27,070
ID.

693
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,240
This license says
you're Indian.

694
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,777
That pinup make you
look like a white man.

695
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:37,409
- What the hell are you?
- I'm a musician.

696
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:39,003
And my name is
Chuck Berry.

697
00:48:39,038 --> 00:48:42,251
And I can be whatever
you need me to be

698
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,824
to play in your fine
establishment this evening.

699
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:47,039
You part con man, too?

700
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,175
No.

701
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,762
You may sing country.

702
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,181
You ain't doing it here.

703
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,467
- Get on, now.
- You gentlemen have a fine evening.

704
00:49:07,193 --> 00:49:08,144
ID.

705
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:20,891
What happened
to your doors?

706
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:23,418
It was hot,
so I took them off.

707
00:49:23,454 --> 00:49:25,911
It's all right.
Come on, baby.

708
00:49:27,414 --> 00:49:29,795
- Come on, girl.
- Thank you.

709
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:31,918
Let me see your license.

710
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,922
Okay. Okay.
Here, you take a look at this here.

711
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:39,400
I'm about to go wax
this record, okay?

712
00:49:39,436 --> 00:49:41,844
Get your ass back
over here, nigger.

713
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,686
Now, you looking
at my license, huh?

714
00:49:51,271 --> 00:49:54,858
You guys know that "nigger" ain't
the name my mama gave me, now.

715
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,445
Oh, pardon.
I'm sorry.

716
00:49:59,945 --> 00:50:02,416
These motherfuckers
can't read.

717
00:50:02,451 --> 00:50:03,382
Okay.
Let me help you out.

718
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:04,918
You got to sound
that shit out.

719
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,788
Come on.

720
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:10,123
"Walter. "

721
00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:12,376
Mud!
The cops got Walter!

722
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:16,213
- Hey, take it easy!
- Nigger.

723
00:50:16,248 --> 00:50:17,346
Come on.
He works here.

724
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,382
- He works here. Take it easy.
- This here nigger?

725
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:21,594
- You feel like a nigger yet?
- Hey! Look.

726
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:25,556
- Look. Please.
- You see that?

727
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,807
Do you see that?
I belong to the Chess family.

728
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:31,572
- Motherfucker!
- Hey!

729
00:50:32,646 --> 00:50:36,233
You're gonna need
a new car, nigger.

730
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,235
That's what I've been
telling this motherfucker.

731
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,235
Shut up, shut up.
Would you stop?

732
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:41,737
Are you fucking
with cops now?

733
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:43,123
God damn it.

734
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:45,708
What's the matter with you?

735
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:49,775
- Are you all right, man?
- Damn it.

736
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,882
I had no business
being that pretty anyway.

737
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,387
It looks like I need
a new car, Len.

738
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:02,925
I gave you a new car.
You rip the fucking doors off it?

739
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,309
It's not my problem!

740
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:06,063
I gave you
a number-one record, Len.

741
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,981
I gave you a chance to make
a number-one fucking record.

742
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:11,351
Oh, you gave the little nigger
a chance, huh?

743
00:51:11,385 --> 00:51:14,438
Little nigger don't
need no chance!

744
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,905
I can play, motherfucker!

745
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,967
I'm fucking king
on this shit!

746
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:20,994
You think I'm
gonna shoot you?

747
00:51:21,028 --> 00:51:24,170
- Get some rest.
- No, I need a new car.

748
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:28,585
Enough! What you need to do is
get back to the Pepsi-Cola, boy.

749
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,563
Let me tell you,
that liquor ain't for you.

750
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,507
What you gonna do, Mud?
You gonna hit me, Mud?

751
00:51:34,543 --> 00:51:37,460
You gonna choke me now?
On the street?

752
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:39,929
Get off me.

753
00:51:43,432 --> 00:51:44,934
You know,

754
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:46,936
that Wolf,

755
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:51,440
the way he stood up
for his sideman,

756
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,195
maybe he could teach
you something, Mud.

757
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,369
Esther, come on!

758
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,992
Find yourself
another harp player.

759
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:20,253
<i>Well, baby, you know
I can never be satisfied</i>

760
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:23,472
<i>And I just can't
keep from crying?</i>

761
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:27,427
Lay it on, man.

762
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,188
Hubert Sumlin,
ladies and gentlemen.

763
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:07,315
- What you want, miss?
- Tell Pot that I ain't leaving.

764
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:09,351
Pot! Your girl said
she ain't leaving.

765
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:13,222
I want your things out of my room
when I get home. I told you.

766
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:21,731
You can't hide
from the eye of God.

767
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,782
He hunting heads tonight.

768
00:53:38,414 --> 00:53:41,918
Muddy, I don't think I want
to be in your band no more.

769
00:53:42,918 --> 00:53:45,338
You steal him
from me again,

770
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:48,173
I'll kill you.

771
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,697
He tell you I quit?

772
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:58,568
He said he felt like somebody
took away his oxygen.

773
00:54:00,936 --> 00:54:02,072
Walter.

774
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:05,525
You're family.

775
00:54:06,525 --> 00:54:08,527
You don't have to do this.

776
00:54:12,364 --> 00:54:14,367
I'm gonna miss you.

777
00:54:33,385 --> 00:54:38,391
When you lose that cat that gave you
that sound that nobody else could,

778
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:41,025
it hurts.

779
00:54:41,061 --> 00:54:43,646
Hurts more than
losing your woman.

780
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:58,769
It's good you
brought him in.

781
00:54:58,804 --> 00:55:01,047
See what I was
telling you, baby?

782
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:02,514
He's different.

783
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:05,585
I don't know, Len.
He sound a little country to me.

784
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:07,586
Maybe we blues him
up just a little bit.

785
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:09,387
Willie.

786
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:12,842
I don't want you to blues this up.
This ain't the blues.

787
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:16,262
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but we're gonna record it.

788
00:55:16,297 --> 00:55:18,146
- There you go, baby.
- Yeah.

789
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,795
<i>Maybelline why can't
you be true</i>

790
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:25,422
<i>Maybelline why can't
you be true</i>

791
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:29,826
<i>You've started back doin'
the things you used to do</i>

792
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,695
<i>As I was motivatin'
over the hill...</i>

793
00:55:35,782 --> 00:55:38,201
Hey.
Hey there, girl.

794
00:55:40,286 --> 00:55:41,788
Tell Chess...

795
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:45,425
I need a new car.

796
00:55:46,543 --> 00:55:48,878
This ain't the right color.

797
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,934
You got something
real special.

798
00:55:55,969 --> 00:55:59,472
Thank you, Mr. Freed.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

799
00:56:01,974 --> 00:56:03,023
Do you think you'll
be able to play it?

800
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:06,795
If I play it, I make
you famous and him rich

801
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:10,498
The question is,
how bad do you want it?

802
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:14,954
I'm sorry. You said, me famous
and him rich? Yeah?

803
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:18,266
Well, hold on.
One second. One second.

804
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,543
Let me switch sides
with you for a moment.

805
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:23,045
Chuck's a bit
of a comedian.

806
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,965
- Well, this is nice.
- Yeah.

807
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,179
- This is very nice.
- I'm sure we can work something out.

808
00:56:29,213 --> 00:56:32,219
Now, some of you people
might call this race music.

809
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,141
I call it rock and roll, and it's too
fun for anybody to sit out on,

810
00:56:36,177 --> 00:56:37,559
white or colored.

811
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:41,661
- Did he just say what I think he said?
- Yeah.

812
00:56:41,695 --> 00:56:43,983
He just integrated
the airwaves.

813
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:47,996
- Here we are.
- Here we are, motherfucker. Here we are.

814
00:56:48,297 --> 00:56:51,860
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Waters, I am deeply grateful to you.

815
00:56:51,994 --> 00:56:54,023
You got it, baby.

816
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,476
<i>Riding along
in my automobile</i>

817
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:16,215
<i>I was anxious
to tell her the way I feel</i>

818
00:57:16,251 --> 00:57:19,016
<i>So I told her
softly and sincere</i>

819
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:21,804
Chuck was playing
in segregated cities.

820
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:29,394
But there was just a thin rope to
separate coloreds from whites.

821
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:31,864
And a whole lot of history.

822
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,244
And that's all it took
to bring us all together,

823
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,164
one man duck-walking
across stage.

824
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:49,465
Shit.

825
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,418
Please keep the aisles clear.

826
00:57:54,503 --> 00:57:56,297
Get back over here.

827
00:57:56,331 --> 00:57:58,090
Keep the aisles clear.

828
00:58:00,976 --> 00:58:04,438
<i>The night was young
and the moon was gold</i>

829
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:07,480
<i>So we both decided
to take a stroll</i>

830
00:58:07,514 --> 00:58:10,487
<i>Can you imagine
the way I felt?</i>

831
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:13,822
<i>I couldn't unfasten
her safety belt</i>

832
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,510
Why don't you play
like that, Daddy?

833
00:58:17,545 --> 00:58:20,824
- Ain't nothing but the blues sped up.
- It's rock and roll.

834
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,501
Look at that car!

835
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:30,273
Len Chess got two hot cars.

836
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:32,923
Hey, Muddy.
Hey, Charles.

837
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:35,545
We're on American Bandstand.
You believe this?

838
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:39,215
- There's the man. Been a long time.
- Chuck Berry!

839
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:42,157
- Hey, is this the boy?
- Yeah, that's Charles.

840
00:58:42,193 --> 00:58:43,318
That's your car outside?

841
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,601
The cherry-red
one out there?

842
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:46,639
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

843
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:49,057
Ain't it?
Good taste.

844
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:52,793
- Sit down, Charles. Have a seat.
- Chuck Berry.

845
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:55,981
Charles, Charlie, Chuck.

846
00:58:56,565 --> 00:59:00,068
Mortgage payment and
child support killing me.

847
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,572
And I ain't booking
the clubs enough.

848
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:08,543
Len, I was talking
to the accountant,

849
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:10,380
and he been telling me I'm
borrowing against my royalties.

850
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:12,715
Len, Mud, it's coming.
You're gonna miss it.

851
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:14,132
Yeah.
In a minute.

852
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:17,253
What's going on?
I thought I was just getting paid.

853
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:24,057
Records ain't selling.

854
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:28,514
Is that how come you got a
brand-new Cadillac in the driveway?

855
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:30,483
He bought me that Cadillac.

856
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:34,985
Me, you and every
other motherfucker

857
00:59:35,021 --> 00:59:38,608
cashes a Chess Records check
is riding that man's coattails.

858
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:40,610
And that ain't good.

859
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,376
Thank you.

860
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,414
In my book,
you're still number one.

861
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:47,581
You, too, baby.

862
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,085
Hey, Dad,
you got to see this.

863
01:00:03,432 --> 01:00:07,902
They were locking up fine black
women for sitting on buses,

864
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:12,891
stringing up our little bitty boys
for whistling at white women.

865
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:16,362
Not paying any mind
at all to old Chuck,

866
01:00:16,396 --> 01:00:18,481
who was reaping
up their firstborn

867
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:20,565
with this thing
called rock and roll.

868
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:35,346
$3,000 in his pocket and
he'd be eating like a hobo.

869
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:39,719
But he'd do that before he'd give
them crackers one damn dollar.

870
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,186
Chuck'd rather sleep
in his own car

871
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,724
than to give his money to one
of them segregated hotels.

872
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,782
The man saved
$100,000 the first year.

873
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,820
Now, he didn't drink,
and, no, he didn't gamble.

874
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:01,824
He only had one
particular vice.

875
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:05,336
- Good evening, ladies.
- You're him, aren't you?

876
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,914
Well, what "him"
are you looking for?

877
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:09,916
You know.

878
01:01:12,534 --> 01:01:14,170
How do you know I know?

879
01:01:14,753 --> 01:01:15,753
I know everything.

880
01:01:15,788 --> 01:01:19,041
Would you mind coming to
teach me what you know?

881
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,512
I'll teach you everything.

882
01:01:27,432 --> 01:01:30,802
Now, Chuck wasn't the only one
looking for female talent.

883
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:32,889
Len was on a girl-hunt, too.

884
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:35,356
Here she is.

885
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,268
Glad you could make it.

886
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:39,144
I can get you a drink...

887
01:01:42,148 --> 01:01:45,400
What, you want me to just
do it right here? Right now?

888
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,751
Well, I am leaving
town tomorrow.

889
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:49,822
Yeah, baby, you don't have
to be shy with him.

890
01:01:49,856 --> 01:01:51,289
I ain't shy, fool.

891
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:59,297
Don't be looking at me like
I ain't wearing no drawers!

892
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:02,385
It's just hard to do if
you ain't in the mood.

893
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,637
And I ain't in the mood.

894
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,141
She ain't in the mood.

895
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,813
Come on.

896
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,847
I thought you said
this broad was good.

897
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:18,934
<i>I heard</i>

898
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:23,773
<i>Church bells ring</i>

899
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:27,744
<i>I heard</i>

900
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:32,498
<i>A choir singing</i>

901
01:02:33,498 --> 01:02:37,385
<i>I saw my love</i>

902
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,215
<i>Walk down the aisle</i>

903
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,976
<i>On her finger</i>

904
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:47,811
<i>He placed the ring?</i>

905
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:52,217
He was looking for a woman that
could go head-to-head with his men.

906
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:54,804
And he found her.

907
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,440
Miss Etta James.

908
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:00,085
- Hey, Mud.
- You got it, baby.

909
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:01,992
When do I get
you back in here?

910
01:03:02,027 --> 01:03:04,530
You ain't heard?
My records ain't selling.

911
01:03:04,565 --> 01:03:06,032
You're always
gonna sell, baby.

912
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:07,532
Cut.

913
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,036
What's going on with
sweet baby girl there?

914
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:12,038
Sweet?

915
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,807
Fuck you, Leonard.
What the hell you know about the blues?

916
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:19,077
I gave you a damn good track
You want it? You sing it.

917
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:21,771
Now she want me to sing it.
Fine, go home.

918
01:03:21,806 --> 01:03:23,965
Forget it. Everybody go home.
That's a wrap.

919
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,918
What are you smiling about?

920
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,338
My mistake. You ain't woman
enough for that song.

921
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:31,574
- I'm plenty woman.
- Oh, yeah?

922
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,391
It's about being in love.
You know what that is?

923
01:03:33,427 --> 01:03:34,927
- I know about love.
- Yeah?

924
01:03:35,427 --> 01:03:36,929
Motherfucker ever
walk out on you?

925
01:03:36,963 --> 01:03:38,396
Huh?
Huh?

926
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:40,099
Fucking not only
did he walk out on you,

927
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:42,202
he's taking the other
broad down the aisle

928
01:03:42,237 --> 01:03:44,269
You know what that
feels like, baby? Huh?

929
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:53,579
Give me another one.

930
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,583
You heard her.
She wants another one.

931
01:03:57,617 --> 01:03:58,951
Take 15.

932
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:09,760
<i>I heard</i>

933
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:13,682
<i>Church bells ring</i>

934
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:17,235
<i>I heard</i>

935
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:20,273
<i>A choir singing</i>

936
01:04:22,224 --> 01:04:25,775
<i>I saw my love</i>

937
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:29,088
<i>Walk down the aisle</i>

938
01:04:29,123 --> 01:04:32,367
<i>On her finger</i>

939
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,304
<i>He placed a ring</i>

940
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,742
<i>Oh, I saw them</i>

941
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:43,829
<i>Holding hands</i>

942
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,500
<i>She was standing there</i>

943
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:51,170
<i>With my man</i>

944
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,117
<i>I heard them promise</i>

945
01:04:57,152 --> 01:05:00,846
<i>Till death do us part</i>

946
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,313
<i>Each word</i>

947
01:05:02,347 --> 01:05:06,960
<i>Was a pain in my heart</i>

948
01:05:06,996 --> 01:05:11,539
<i>Oh, all I could do</i>

949
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,077
<i>All I could do was cry</i>

950
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,974
<i>All I could do</i>

951
01:05:20,009 --> 01:05:23,369
<i>Was cry</i>

952
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:27,672
<i>I was losing</i>

953
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:31,652
<i>The man that I loved</i>

954
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:35,597
<i>And all I could do</i>

955
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:38,050
<i>Was cry</i>

956
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,938
<i>And now</i>

957
01:05:43,021 --> 01:05:46,025
<i>The wedding is over</i>

958
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,862
<i>The rice,
rice has been thrown</i>

959
01:05:50,898 --> 01:05:53,865
<i>Over their heads</i>

960
01:05:55,568 --> 01:05:59,346
<i>For them life</i>

961
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:02,253
<i>Has just begun</i>

962
01:06:02,289 --> 01:06:05,460
<i>But mine</i>

963
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,630
<i>Is ending</i>

964
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:24,179
You play a mean
game of pool.

965
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:31,570
Listen, if I brought up
bad memories, I'm sorry.

966
01:06:31,605 --> 01:06:33,987
But it was good
for the song.

967
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,742
This album comes out, that old
boyfriend will come running.

968
01:06:36,777 --> 01:06:39,277
I wasn't crying
over no boyfriend.

969
01:06:39,313 --> 01:06:40,329
Oh, no?

970
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,864
Girlfriend?

971
01:06:46,952 --> 01:06:48,954
How'd you learn to
play pool so good?

972
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:50,420
My daddy.

973
01:06:50,456 --> 01:06:51,840
- Hmm?
- Mmm-hmm.

974
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,880
- Can I get a whiskey?
- Sure thing, boss.

975
01:06:56,117 --> 01:06:57,128
That's good.

976
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,474
Hard to find time to
teach your kids things.

977
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,907
He ain't teach me shit.
I taught myself.

978
01:07:03,942 --> 01:07:06,269
I don't want to embarrass
him when we meet.

979
01:07:06,304 --> 01:07:09,391
Tell you who's gonna be
embarrassed is your old man.

980
01:07:09,427 --> 01:07:11,443
Because he's gonna meet
a goddamn superstar.

981
01:07:12,027 --> 01:07:13,028
You know?

982
01:07:14,146 --> 01:07:16,148
And what is he?

983
01:07:16,182 --> 01:07:18,114
A nobody.
Now,

984
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,235
I don't want
to embarrass you,

985
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:20,701
but let me show
you how it's done.

986
01:07:20,735 --> 01:07:23,239
You're batting
a thousand on being wrong.

987
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:25,407
You see that
picture over there?

988
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,295
What, Minnesota Fats
is your father?

989
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:34,800
That's the story.

990
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,307
You ought to have him
come by the studio.

991
01:07:42,842 --> 01:07:45,358
I ain't never even
met that motherfucker.

992
01:07:45,393 --> 01:07:49,864
But when I do, I want it to be
in a fancy restaurant

993
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:52,650
where everybody wants my picture
and asking me for my autograph.

994
01:07:52,686 --> 01:07:55,293
- That's the dream, huh?
- That's my dream.

995
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:57,155
It's not a dream.

996
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,092
You're gonna cross over.

997
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,992
- You think?
- Promise.

998
01:08:02,027 --> 01:08:05,246
You gonna promise me
that fancy restaurant, too?

999
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:07,833
Promise.

1000
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:11,786
The one that's gonna serve the
white man and his colored daughter.

1001
01:08:15,173 --> 01:08:16,806
Hey, come on.

1002
01:08:16,841 --> 01:08:20,930
You sing the blues.
You don't have to live them.

1003
01:08:20,965 --> 01:08:24,350
What the fuck do you know,
white boy?

1004
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:31,689
Yeah, you play that
hard act real good.

1005
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:35,694
But I see you.

1006
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:41,951
I see you.

1007
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:53,295
<i>And all I could do</i>

1008
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:56,414
<i>Was cry?</i>

1009
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:59,585
Old Len thought his checkbook
can fix anything,

1010
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:02,296
so he bought out
the restaurant for Etta.

1011
01:09:02,332 --> 01:09:04,974
But there's some things
money can't fix.

1012
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:08,391
I can't help you, kid.

1013
01:09:08,426 --> 01:09:10,429
Gin. Can I have
a bottle of gin?

1014
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,980
I need a bottle of gin.

1015
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:17,478
Gin, please.
Can I have a bottle of gin?

1016
01:09:17,512 --> 01:09:20,939
Gin! Can I get
a fucking bottle of gin?

1017
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,716
- Come on. Bottle of gin.
- Right away, sir.

1018
01:09:25,814 --> 01:09:27,947
I guess I got to be him
to get some gin?

1019
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:39,721
- What'd he say to you?
- Stupid shit.

1020
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,176
He didn't even ask
if he could see me again.

1021
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:44,345
That's his problem.
Why you making it yours?

1022
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:45,895
Here you go, sir.

1023
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:49,601
You wouldn't even begin
to know my problems, baby.

1024
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:52,104
Let me.

1025
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,979
My mother was a whore.

1026
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,648
And that fat motherfucker
just looked me in my face,

1027
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,404
and he didn't see himself.

1028
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:14,710
He didn't see his little girl.
You know what he saw?

1029
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:20,332
He saw the cum stains of all
the other men my mother fucked.

1030
01:10:20,832 --> 01:10:24,336
These chanda-fucking-liers and these
white tablecloths don't mean shit!

1031
01:10:24,371 --> 01:10:26,804
I ain't gonna ever
be good enough for him.

1032
01:10:26,838 --> 01:10:29,007
You know they're gonna break
this when I leave, right?

1033
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:31,319
Fuck it!
I'll do it for you!

1034
01:10:31,354 --> 01:10:33,595
Come on, honey.
Listen to me.

1035
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:36,481
You can't let that in.

1036
01:10:38,016 --> 01:10:40,568
You know, Muddy,

1037
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:43,154
he sings that hurt.
He don't live it.

1038
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,990
He don't nurse it.

1039
01:10:47,025 --> 01:10:51,029
Walter, he carries
it around like a baby.

1040
01:10:51,064 --> 01:10:52,864
Feeds it on whiskey and smack.

1041
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,002
You got to let it go.

1042
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:05,377
I can't.

1043
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:28,248
Oh, no.

1044
01:11:28,283 --> 01:11:30,402
No, I'm not having it.

1045
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,992
That's my song.

1046
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:41,869
- No, darling.
- No, no, darling. That's, that's...

1047
01:11:42,046 --> 01:11:44,014
That's my song.

1048
01:11:44,048 --> 01:11:45,884
No, darling.
That's the Beach Boys.

1049
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,472
That is Sweet Sixteen,
note for note.

1050
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:54,440
Note for note.
Not one change.

1051
01:11:54,475 --> 01:11:58,444
Aside, apart from the lyrics,
about the new...

1052
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:03,484
The new craze sweeping the nation for
young white boys and girls, surfing.

1053
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,689
I've provided them the soundtrack,
unbeknownst to myself.

1054
01:12:06,724 --> 01:12:08,622
- You ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

1055
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:13,627
I'm very ready to make more
songs for the Beach Boys

1056
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:17,615
and all other manner of white folks
to steal. Yes, I'm quite ready.

1057
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:20,438
- You say the devil's name, he appears.
- We need to talk.

1058
01:12:20,493 --> 01:12:24,617
Yeah, we do need to talk. You heard this?
You know what's going on?

1059
01:12:24,652 --> 01:12:27,131
- Do you know what's going on?
- I'm not laying down for this.

1060
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:30,462
First, Alan Freed gets a third
of Maybelline. For what?

1061
01:12:30,497 --> 01:12:31,761
Chuck, listen.

1062
01:12:31,796 --> 01:12:35,634
No. You listen to me.
Did he write one part of the song?

1063
01:12:35,668 --> 01:12:37,720
- One part?
- Alan Freed put us on the map.

1064
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:39,686
This gives him
the license...

1065
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:41,222
Did you take an underage
white girl across state lines?

1066
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:44,726
I'm not talking about girls.
What's going on?

1067
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:49,708
- Don't say shit. Don't say anything.
- Hello, Officers. Is there a problem?

1068
01:12:49,743 --> 01:12:52,234
Mr. Berry, you are under arrest
for transporting a minor

1069
01:12:52,269 --> 01:12:55,570
across state lines for the
purpose of prostitution.

1070
01:12:56,121 --> 01:13:00,658
First of all, I didn't transport anyone
anywhere. I didn't solicit anything.

1071
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:05,163
Gentlemen, I'll have you know that my
very dear friend Mr. Jerry Lee Lewis

1072
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:06,664
- has a 13-year-old wife.
- Keep your mouth shut.

1073
01:13:06,699 --> 01:13:08,131
Are we stopping
by his home on the way?

1074
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:11,170
Emmett Till gets murdered for
whistling at a white woman.

1075
01:13:11,204 --> 01:13:12,671
I know you're please
d to get Chuck Berry.

1076
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:14,555
Fix this, Leonard.

1077
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,009
<i>Everybody's gone surfin'</i>

1078
01:13:17,043 --> 01:13:19,560
<i>Surfin' U.S.A.</i>

1079
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,429
<i>Everybody's gone surfin'...</i>

1080
01:13:22,463 --> 01:13:25,516
You guys got to be kidding me, man.
Where are you from?

1081
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:28,569
You set that hair
in the morning?

1082
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:32,190
You ladies shouldn't be out
here without an escort.

1083
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:35,778
A bunch of English boys
started playing our music.

1084
01:13:35,813 --> 01:13:37,795
Now, it was made in America,

1085
01:13:37,829 --> 01:13:40,948
but I guess nobody thought
we were Americans.

1086
01:13:41,449 --> 01:13:43,952
Hey, let me help
you with that, fellow.

1087
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:47,456
Fucking hell.
It's him!

1088
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,833
Mr. Waters.

1089
01:13:49,868 --> 01:13:52,141
We're big fans.

1090
01:13:52,176 --> 01:13:54,144
You're the reason
we got together.

1091
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,715
We named our band
after one of your songs.

1092
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,314
- Yeah?
- Rolling Stone.

1093
01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:02,269
All right.

1094
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:05,238
Go on in there.
Fuck them police.

1095
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,777
Everybody knows the Rolling Stones,
the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac,

1096
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,743
Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton.

1097
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,148
Everybody know
them names, right?

1098
01:14:16,484 --> 01:14:17,985
Skinny motherfuckers.

1099
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:21,622
The Rolling Stones are
burning up the charts

1100
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:23,908
with an old
Muddy Waters standard.

1101
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,498
Take 10% of Chuck's royalties
and move them to Muddy.

1102
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,765
Go on and do it.

1103
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,802
Chuck ain't gonna miss it.

1104
01:14:38,256 --> 01:14:41,476
The goose that laid the
golden egg was locked up.

1105
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:47,983
So Len brought in the old standbys,
including Little Walter.

1106
01:14:48,018 --> 01:14:50,451
Chess was desperate for a hit.

1107
01:14:50,485 --> 01:14:53,855
Oh, hey, little girl, now.
Who you belong to, huh?

1108
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:55,940
You mind if I watch?

1109
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:57,407
Go ahead, baby girl.

1110
01:14:57,442 --> 01:14:58,443
I grew up on y'all's music.

1111
01:14:58,911 --> 01:14:59,827
Watch?

1112
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,863
Come over here.

1113
01:15:02,363 --> 01:15:04,213
I'll teach you to blow, baby.

1114
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:06,251
Better watch it, baby girl.
He ain't talking about that harp.

1115
01:15:08,252 --> 01:15:10,671
Muddy, you're a fool.

1116
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:15,293
I wouldn't mind a little bit of
what you flying on.

1117
01:15:15,328 --> 01:15:18,296
You too pretty to be
flying my way, now.

1118
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,882
You don't need that amp.

1119
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:25,579
- How they gonna hear me?
- Everybody's records are getting sent back.

1120
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:28,524
You want to survive, do something
different. Play along.

1121
01:15:28,559 --> 01:15:31,143
Something different?
What the fuck?

1122
01:15:31,177 --> 01:15:32,194
What?

1123
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,863
Mud, what you think
about this?

1124
01:15:36,814 --> 01:15:39,842
What you think
about this, Mud?

1125
01:15:39,877 --> 01:15:42,871
I think we need
to lay this record.

1126
01:15:50,162 --> 01:15:52,413
What, I'm just
a sideman now?

1127
01:15:57,301 --> 01:15:59,770
Okay, I'll do it, Len.
I'll do it.

1128
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:03,307
I'm broke as the rest of you
motherfuckers in here, so, you know?

1129
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,729
I'm gonna need a
bottle of gin, though.

1130
01:16:08,229 --> 01:16:10,314
I'm gonna need
a bottle of gin, baby.

1131
01:16:10,349 --> 01:16:13,435
Because I like a taste
before getting fucked.

1132
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:16,737
Somebody taking
care of Walter?

1133
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:19,358
That's right.
Take care of me, baby.

1134
01:16:46,385 --> 01:16:50,939
<i>At last</i>

1135
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:58,896
<i>My love has come along</i>

1136
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:06,872
<i>My lonely days are over</i>

1137
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:14,829
<i>And life is like a song</i>

1138
01:17:17,381 --> 01:17:19,885
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1139
01:17:20,551 --> 01:17:23,137
<i>At last</i>

1140
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:31,595
<i>The skies above are blue</i>

1141
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:40,104
<i>My heart was
wrapped up in clover</i>

1142
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:47,945
<i>The night I looked at you</i>

1143
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:57,288
<i>I found a dream</i>

1144
01:17:57,788 --> 01:18:00,792
<i>That I could speak to</i>

1145
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:05,296
<i>A dream that I</i>

1146
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:08,800
<i>Can call my own</i>

1147
01:18:10,301 --> 01:18:13,770
<i>I found a thrill</i>

1148
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:17,309
<i>To press my cheek to</i>

1149
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:21,587
<i>A thrill that I</i>

1150
01:18:21,622 --> 01:18:24,865
<i>Have never known</i>

1151
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,250
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1152
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:29,787
<i>When you smiled</i>

1153
01:18:30,154 --> 01:18:32,573
<i>You smiled</i>

1154
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:38,630
<i>Oh, and then
the spell was cast</i>

1155
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:47,255
<i>And here we are in heaven</i>

1156
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:55,396
<i>For you are mine</i>

1157
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:58,315
<i>At last</i>

1158
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:02,654
- Thanks, baby.
- You got it.

1159
01:19:04,105 --> 01:19:06,572
- Happy anniversary, Revetta.
- Thank you.

1160
01:19:06,574 --> 01:19:09,537
- Where you taking her, Peppers?
- Get out of here.

1161
01:19:10,194 --> 01:19:14,282
WVJN just called.
Etta missed her airtime again.

1162
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:18,753
God damn, it's the third time
this week. This broad, I'm gonna...

1163
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,177
I'm sorry, babe. I got to go figure
out what's going on here.

1164
01:19:26,212 --> 01:19:28,095
Don't worry about it.
I'll go look in on her.

1165
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:29,381
That ain't your job, Mud.

1166
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:30,931
Chess.

1167
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,105
Go on and enjoy yourself.

1168
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,733
<i>Trust in me,</i>

1169
01:19:42,421 --> 01:19:46,479
<i>in all you do</i>

1170
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:52,988
<i>Have the faith
I have in you</i>

1171
01:19:55,573 --> 01:19:59,578
<i>Love will see us through</i>

1172
01:19:59,994 --> 01:20:04,881
<i>If only you trust in me</i>

1173
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:07,654
<i>Why don't you,</i>

1174
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:11,349
<i>you trust me</i>

1175
01:20:12,131 --> 01:20:17,729
<i>Come to me
when things go wrong</i>

1176
01:20:18,729 --> 01:20:21,233
<i>Cling to me, Daddy</i>

1177
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:26,070
<i>Oh yeah,
and I'll be strong</i>

1178
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,826
Now, wake up, girl.
Wake u Look here, wake up!

1179
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:33,244
What the...
What... What you...

1180
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:35,244
Come here.
Stand up.

1181
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:36,832
Get up, God damn it,
come on.

1182
01:20:36,867 --> 01:20:39,425
- Stand up. Get up.
- Hey, baby.

1183
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:42,225
- Come on, now.
- You came to see me?

1184
01:20:42,753 --> 01:20:45,125
- He fucked up my hair.
- I'm going to get a doctor.

1185
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:46,341
No doctors.

1186
01:20:46,841 --> 01:20:49,344
Let me get Geneva then.
She knows what to do with this.

1187
01:20:49,378 --> 01:20:51,811
All right, that's good.

1188
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:54,814
Wake up.
Baby, come on, wake up.

1189
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,351
Wake up, come on.
It's not funny. Come on.

1190
01:20:59,386 --> 01:21:03,856
This the first time
I ever used this fireplace.

1191
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:05,944
Feel like I should be having
marshmallows or something.

1192
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,814
Yeah, I'm sure marshmallows
and smack go real well together.

1193
01:21:13,284 --> 01:21:15,153
What happened
to the furniture?

1194
01:21:16,904 --> 01:21:18,405
Where's the car?

1195
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,877
My mama sold what
didn't get repossessed.

1196
01:21:24,962 --> 01:21:26,463
They gonna take my house.

1197
01:21:26,498 --> 01:21:28,500
Oh, that's good.

1198
01:21:33,971 --> 01:21:35,472
Come on.

1199
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,927
You got to put
it in my name.

1200
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:45,350
You hear me? You gonna trust me?
Put the house in my name.

1201
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,853
What?
What?

1202
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:52,856
Trust me.

1203
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:55,359
<i>Trust in me</i>

1204
01:21:57,612 --> 01:22:01,115
<i>In all you do</i>

1205
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,082
Listen.

1206
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:07,122
Listen to me. I'm gonna get you
in a clinic and get some help.

1207
01:22:09,623 --> 01:22:11,626
I'm gonna pay for it.

1208
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,378
It's not a loan.
It's a gift.

1209
01:22:14,413 --> 01:22:16,131
So, now you buying me gifts?

1210
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,132
Yeah, that's right.

1211
01:22:18,632 --> 01:22:20,635
I must be real special.

1212
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,358
I must make you
a lot of money.

1213
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:28,859
Yeah, that must be it.

1214
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:30,945
I ain't stupid.

1215
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:36,115
I'm your number-one bitch
since Chuck got busted.

1216
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:39,149
- I'm trying to take care of you.
- You gonna take care of me?

1217
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:44,158
Who the fuck you think you talking to,
your tight-ass wife?

1218
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:46,578
That's off-limits.

1219
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:49,413
I don't need no man
to take care of me.

1220
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:51,542
So tough.
You look so fucking good.

1221
01:22:51,577 --> 01:22:53,372
With these track
marks in your arm?

1222
01:22:53,408 --> 01:22:55,273
That's real good.
Well, that's good.

1223
01:22:55,307 --> 01:22:57,137
Yeah, that'll fix
your problems, huh?

1224
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,673
Baby, don't worry.

1225
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:02,644
Etta ain't gonna hurt you.

1226
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,645
That feels nice.

1227
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,934
It feel real good.
Who bought you that?

1228
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:13,188
Did Etta buy you that?
I think she did.

1229
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:15,154
Who bought you that car?

1230
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:18,158
I think I got that
nice car out there, too.

1231
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:22,127
Don't worry.

1232
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:25,693
- I'll do it for you, baby.
- Come on. Stop that.

1233
01:23:25,728 --> 01:23:29,837
Just say, "Trust in me," like all
them other motherfuckers...

1234
01:23:29,872 --> 01:23:33,425
Come on, I ain't taking
from you! I'm offering.

1235
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:36,030
God damn it, I don't know
what the fuck to say to you.

1236
01:23:36,065 --> 01:23:38,097
I'm not your fucking pimp.

1237
01:23:38,132 --> 01:23:40,131
- That's not us.
- "Us"?

1238
01:23:41,632 --> 01:23:43,635
What the fuck is "us"?

1239
01:23:45,636 --> 01:23:48,139
A white man and a black girl?

1240
01:23:50,641 --> 01:23:52,942
I been there.

1241
01:23:52,976 --> 01:23:55,563
Yeah, but you ain't been here.

1242
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:01,786
I'm not your father.

1243
01:24:05,873 --> 01:24:07,908
And you ain't your mother.

1244
01:24:11,412 --> 01:24:13,414
And I ain't gonna hurt you.

1245
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:17,418
I got no reason to hurt you.

1246
01:24:21,422 --> 01:24:23,425
You don't even know
what you have.

1247
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,427
What do I have?

1248
01:24:31,432 --> 01:24:32,934
You got a hit record.

1249
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,402
What?

1250
01:24:35,436 --> 01:24:37,939
You're on top of
the charts, baby.

1251
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:40,942
You crossed over.

1252
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:43,411
Len, I crossed over?

1253
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,412
I told you.

1254
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,516
Geneva a nurse.

1255
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:09,354
Hello, Etta.

1256
01:25:09,389 --> 01:25:10,354
Hi.

1257
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:18,677
Are you sure you want

1258
01:25:18,699 --> 01:25:21,572
Geneva to stay here or you
want her to come home with me?

1259
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:25,787
It's not what you think.

1260
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:29,289
Oh, this is just business?

1261
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:32,833
- That's right.
- You never hold me like that.

1262
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:35,545
Cross over and I'll jump
into bed with you.

1263
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:38,632
I bet you'd jump out that
motherfucker quick, too.

1264
01:25:47,307 --> 01:25:48,091
What?

1265
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:53,863
What?

1266
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:55,399
You know how Walter
call you his white daddy,

1267
01:25:55,899 --> 01:26:00,604
because every time he step in shit,
you there to get him out of trouble?

1268
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:04,024
And then you bring him in the
studio and you take away his amp,

1269
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:06,528
the sound that took him
his whole life to make up.

1270
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:11,498
Any other motherfucker he'd have
shot for that, but he give it up for you.

1271
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:16,087
What you telling that little girl
ain't got nobody in the world?

1272
01:26:16,587 --> 01:26:18,590
That you're gonna
take care of her?

1273
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,556
How many strung-out
girls you told that to?

1274
01:26:20,591 --> 01:26:24,429
I ain't talking about me. I'm talking
about you and the baby girl in there.

1275
01:26:24,463 --> 01:26:27,636
- What if I told you I had feelings
for her? - Bullshit.

1276
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,735
Fine.

1277
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:37,225
I'm fucking her, I'm fucking Chuck,
and I'm fucking you. Huh?

1278
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,243
That's what you think, huh?

1279
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:42,779
Ain't that what
you think, Mud?

1280
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,784
Well, that's what
the blues is, ain't it?

1281
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:49,237
A whole lot of fucking.

1282
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,657
Tell Geneva I'm gone.

1283
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:02,550
They locked Chuck up
at the peak of his career.

1284
01:27:02,585 --> 01:27:05,052
He couldn't record
a damn thing.

1285
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:08,077
- Goodbye.
- Mr. Berry! Mr. Berry!

1286
01:27:17,097 --> 01:27:20,411
- Yeah?
- Somebody busted up your store.

1287
01:27:21,603 --> 01:27:23,069
What?
Somebody broke in?

1288
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:25,606
You better come
and see about it.

1289
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:27,609
.Yeah, I'll be right down.

1290
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:30,110
Who is this?

1291
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:34,079
Len's world was changing.

1292
01:27:34,114 --> 01:27:36,466
Not only was Muddy
questioning him,

1293
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:39,252
but so were the folks
in the neighborhood.

1294
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:43,791
Colored folks who were told they
weren't colored no more, but black,

1295
01:27:43,826 --> 01:27:46,509
who was told
they had a power.

1296
01:27:46,543 --> 01:27:49,645
They had the right to own
their own businesses.

1297
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,800
And who was this white man
getting rich off of them?

1298
01:27:52,835 --> 01:27:53,801
You want to fuck
around back here?

1299
01:27:55,219 --> 01:27:57,203
The south side of
Chicago was getting mad.

1300
01:27:57,238 --> 01:27:59,189
Everybody could feel
the change coming.

1301
01:27:59,225 --> 01:28:01,693
Get on out of our
neighborhood!

1302
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:05,278
Screaming fans went nuts again

1303
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:09,198
for rock and roll
star Elvis Presley.

1304
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:12,987
Presley, handsome as ever,
tipped his hat for the cameras.

1305
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:16,490
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen...

1306
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:17,923
your new king.

1307
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:20,161
I'm about to win
this money, baby.

1308
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:23,131
Tough luck, boy.

1309
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,632
- Tough luck?
- You lose.

1310
01:28:25,667 --> 01:28:27,600
Back up, motherfucker.

1311
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,853
No tough luck got this, motherfucker.

1312
01:28:30,887 --> 01:28:34,425
Because this shit here
says my luck is just fine.

1313
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:36,394
What you gonna do,
blow me to death?

1314
01:28:36,761 --> 01:28:37,478
Shit.

1315
01:28:42,065 --> 01:28:43,032
Walter.

1316
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:45,569
Okay.
Oh, Jesus. Walter!

1317
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,538
Oh, God.

1318
01:28:49,573 --> 01:28:51,074
You ain't come
and get me, Mama.

1319
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,077
You didn't come and get me.

1320
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:58,082
I've been waiting
for you for a long time.

1321
01:28:59,082 --> 01:29:01,085
I'm here.

1322
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:03,087
I found you.

1323
01:29:03,587 --> 01:29:06,591
Mama loves you.
Come on, stay with me.

1324
01:29:06,626 --> 01:29:09,671
- I just got to rest my eyes.
- Stay with me.

1325
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:12,095
I just got to rest my eyes.

1326
01:29:12,131 --> 01:29:14,097
No.
No, stay with me.

1327
01:29:28,729 --> 01:29:30,230
Wait a minute.

1328
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:34,452
Wait a minute.

1329
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:43,744
<i>Last night</i>

1330
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:48,216

I ever had</i>

1331
01:29:53,671 --> 01:29:57,175

1332
01:29:58,176 --> 01:30:00,912

feel so bad</i>

1333
01:30:00,947 --> 01:30:03,648

All right.

1334
01:30:05,015 --> 01:30:06,016
All right.

1335
01:30:08,519 --> 01:30:09,520
All right.

1336
01:30:12,023 --> 01:30:15,943
Thank you.
Thank you.

1337
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:27,838
All right.

1338
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,842
Well, we'll have
to see if we can...

1339
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:36,346
If we can't get
him a new suit.

1340
01:30:41,351 --> 01:30:45,355
Get him one of them boxes
with the blue satin lining inside.

1341
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:48,859
Have him look slick.

1342
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:50,978
I got to use the toilet.

1343

- Can I get you some tea?
- No, thank you.

1348
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:26,264
You know, there's a whole line
of bluesmen on your lawn,

1349
01:31:26,298 --> 01:31:28,113
waiting to see
if you're dead.

1350
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,817
Looking to see if
they owe me money.

1351
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:30,902
Yeah.

1352
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:35,384
Look at that. You're the first
man ever gave me flowers.

1353
01:31:35,935 --> 01:31:39,271
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, don't tell nobody.

1354
01:31:39,306 --> 01:31:41,878
They're beautiful.
I'll put them in a vase.

1355
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:43,628
You okay?

1356
01:31:43,663 --> 01:31:45,699
I'm good.

- Wolf.

1358
01:31:50,537 --> 01:31:52,622
Shit.

1359
01:31:57,011 --> 01:32:00,547
I know Walter was into you for a whole lot,
but he got anything coming his way?

1360
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:03,990
- You know how he spent his money.
- Yeah, I know it.

1361
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:08,389
Look here.

1362
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:12,726
I got $200 to my name.

1363
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:17,364
You're gonna have to help
pay for Walter's funeral.

1364
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:18,530
Who said I wouldn't?

1365
01:32:18,565 --> 01:32:22,054
Why he got to pay for Walter's funeral?
He ain't Walter's daddy.

1366
01:32:22,157 --> 01:32:25,564
Is you and me talking? Walter put a lot of
goddamn money in his billfold, that's why.

1367
01:32:25,599 --> 01:32:28,445
- I'm the only motherfucker
making money? - Looks like it.

1368
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:31,425
That's the man's job, make money
off of you. You from Mississippi.

1369
01:32:31,564 --> 01:32:34,242
- You ought to know that.
- How many Caddies did y'all go through?

1370
01:32:34,247 --> 01:32:37,234
Let's get this straight.
I didn't fuck you.

1371
01:32:37,269 --> 01:32:39,069
I didn't say nothing
about who fucked who.

1372
01:32:39,104 --> 01:32:41,585
You insinuated that
with your bullshit!

1373
01:32:41,721 --> 01:32:44,529
You was out with the fucking jewelry
and the broads all the time.

1374
01:32:44,564 --> 01:32:46,336
And you was
a motherfucking saint?

1375
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:52,099
Who here is a saint?

1376
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:54,617
Who here?

1377
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,868
- Settle down.
- No, Revetta, please.

1378
01:32:56,904 --> 01:33:00,490
If you act like a boy, keep asking for
handouts, he gonna treat you like one.

1379
01:33:00,525 --> 01:33:02,909
Is you and me talking, motherfucker?
What is you looking for?

1380
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:06,279
I'm looking to help
bury a fellow musician.

1381
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:08,365
I said I'll pay for it!

1382
01:33:12,703 --> 01:33:16,671
Now, it feels good
not to have a daddy.

1383
01:33:16,707 --> 01:33:20,043
And as much as I don't like you,
I want you to feel good...

1384
01:33:21,628 --> 01:33:23,130
like that, too.

1385
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:50,908
I killed Walter.

1386
01:33:53,911 --> 01:33:56,713
I killed him when I let you
take away his amp.

1387
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,801
I'm the motherfucker?

1388
01:34:05,256 --> 01:34:06,756
I'm the motherfucker?

1389
01:34:10,261 --> 01:34:14,765
<i>Well, my babe don't stand
no cheating, my babe</i>

1390
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:21,604
<i>Well, my babe don't stand
no cheating, my babe</i>

1391
01:34:22,105 --> 01:34:25,109
<i>You know, my babe
don't stand no cheating</i>

1392
01:34:25,144 --> 01:34:29,530
<i>She don't, she don't
she don't, oh, God</i>

1393
01:34:29,565 --> 01:34:33,882
<i>My babe I know she loves me,
my babe</i>

1394
01:34:33,917 --> 01:34:38,582
<i>Well, my babe I know she loves me,
my babe</i>

1395
01:34:39,673 --> 01:34:45,296
<i>Well, my babe I know she loves me,
my babe</i>

1396
01:34:45,331 --> 01:34:49,265
<i>Well, my babe
I know she loves me</i>

1397
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:52,427
<i>She don't do nothing
but kiss and love me</i>

1398
01:34:52,462 --> 01:34:55,555
<i>My babe, I know she loves me,
my babe</i>

1399
01:34:57,057 --> 01:34:58,641
<i>Oh, now, now, now, baby</i>

1400
01:34:58,676 --> 01:35:00,158
<i>My baby</i>

1401
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:01,695
<i>Oh, now, now, now, baby</i>

1402
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:02,697
<i>My baby</i>

1403
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,731
<i>Oh, now, now, now, baby</i>

1404
01:35:04,766 --> 01:35:05,698
<i>My baby</i>

1405
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:08,069
<i>Oh, now, now, now, baby?</i>

1406
01:35:08,104 --> 01:35:10,036
It was over,

1407
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,907
the music, Chess Records.

1408
01:35:13,873 --> 01:35:16,292
Everybody could feel it.

1409
01:35:16,327 --> 01:35:19,130
Len was getting out
while he could.

1410
01:35:21,498 --> 01:35:24,551
So, working on somethin
behind my back now, huh?

1411
01:35:25,552 --> 01:35:27,520
Uh-huh.

1412
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,055
What happened to
"Trust In Me"?

1413
01:35:31,057 --> 01:35:33,060
I know what
you've been doing.

1414
01:35:33,095 --> 01:35:35,720
- Yeah, what?
- You gonna sell the company.

1415
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:45,405
You know,
back when I started this,

1416
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:50,411
nobody'd let a black man
do what I got done.

1417
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:52,412
Doors weren't open.

1418
01:35:54,914 --> 01:35:56,417
Now they are.

1419
01:35:57,868 --> 01:35:58,668
Time to move on.

1420
01:35:59,252 --> 01:36:01,255
You gonna be missing out.

1421
01:36:02,756 --> 01:36:06,225
You don't think
I know that?

1422
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,881
So, you mean to tell me, this could be
the last time I sing a song for you?

1423
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:20,405
Better make it good.

1424
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,275
They don't get no better.

1425
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:24,862
Y'all ready?

1426
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:49,987
<i>Something told me</i>

1427
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:53,173
<i>It was over</i>

1428
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,761
<i>When I saw you and her</i>

1429
01:36:59,345 --> 01:37:01,347
<i>Talking</i>

1430
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:06,318
<i>Something deep down</i>

1431
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:10,407
<i>In my soul said,
"Cry, girl"</i>

1432
01:37:10,442 --> 01:37:12,943
<i>- Cry, girl
- Cry, girl</i>

1433
01:37:13,277 --> 01:37:16,363
<i>When I saw you
and that girl</i>

1434
01:37:16,398 --> 01:37:18,948
<i>Walking around</i>

1435
01:37:19,332 --> 01:37:21,382
<i>Ooh</i>

1436
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:26,422
<i>I would rather
I would rather go blind, boy</i>

1437
01:37:30,043 --> 01:37:35,548
<i>Than to see you
walk away from me child, no</i>

1438
01:37:36,550 --> 01:37:38,516
<i>Ooh</i>

1439
01:37:38,551 --> 01:37:42,389
<i>So you see
I love you so much</i>

1440
01:37:42,856 --> 01:37:46,310
<i>That I don't want to watch you
leave me, baby</i>

1441
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:50,112
<i>Most of all, I just don't</i>

1442
01:37:50,146 --> 01:37:53,399
<i>I just don't want
to be free, no</i>

1443
01:37:53,984 --> 01:37:57,086
<i>Ooh</i>

1444
01:37:57,121 --> 01:38:00,088
<i>I was just, I was just</i>

1445
01:38:00,123 --> 01:38:03,210
<i>I was just
sitting here thinking</i>

1446
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,511
<i>Of your kiss</i>

1447
01:38:06,546 --> 01:38:10,384
<i>And your warm embrace,
yeah</i>

1448
01:38:13,753 --> 01:38:16,221
<i>When the reflection
in a glass</i>

1449
01:38:16,256 --> 01:38:19,760
<i>That I held to
my lips now, baby</i>

1450
01:38:22,262 --> 01:38:24,722
<i>Revealed these tears</i>

1451
01:38:24,757 --> 01:38:27,184
<i>That are on my face</i>

1452
01:38:28,769 --> 01:38:30,270
<i>Ooh</i>

1453
01:38:31,271 --> 01:38:32,704
<i>And, baby</i>

1454
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:38,362
<i>And, baby, baby,
I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

1455
01:38:39,445 --> 01:38:42,365
<i>Than to see you walk away</i>

1456
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,286
<i>Walk away from me, yeah</i>

1457
01:38:47,787 --> 01:38:51,006
<i>And, baby, baby, baby</i>

1458
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:55,045
<i>I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

1459
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:59,048
<i>Than to see
you walk away</i>

1460
01:38:59,083 --> 01:39:01,351
<i>Walk away from me</i>

1461
01:39:05,855 --> 01:39:09,608
<i>And, baby, baby, baby</i>

1462
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:12,645
<i>I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

1463
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:16,199
<i>Than to see
you walk away</i>

1464
01:39:17,568 --> 01:39:20,654
<i>Walk away from me, yeah</i>

1465
01:39:21,204 --> 01:39:23,204
<i>Ooh</i>

1466
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:25,256
<i>And, baby</i>

1467
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:27,341
<i>Baby</i>

1468
01:39:27,631 --> 01:39:29,841
<i>Baby</i>

1469
01:39:29,993 --> 01:39:32,344
<i>Baby</i>

1470
01:39:32,378 --> 01:39:37,304
<i>I'd rather
I'd rather be blind, boy</i>

1471
01:39:40,807 --> 01:39:42,774
<i>And, baby</i>

1472
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,787
Chess Records
had a hold on Len.

1473
01:39:45,823 --> 01:39:48,765
It just wouldn't
let him leave.

1474
01:39:49,315 --> 01:39:52,319
He had a heart attack before
he could turn the corner.

1475
01:39:59,275 --> 01:40:01,779
Baby girl,
I got some bad news for you.

1476
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,131
Chess ain't leave no will.

1477
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:09,837
That means everything that belonged
to him goes to the wife and children,

1478
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,422
including this here house.

1479
01:40:13,289 --> 01:40:15,841
That's all right.

1480
01:40:15,876 --> 01:40:18,878
This morning, a man came by
and gave me this.

1481
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:21,729
What's that?

1482
01:40:21,765 --> 01:40:24,315
It's the deed to my house.

1483
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:27,637
He said Len wanted me to have it in
case something ever happened.

1484
01:40:27,672 --> 01:40:29,605
That motherfucker.

1485
01:40:30,556 --> 01:40:31,557
He didn't have time
to leave a will,

1486
01:40:31,592 --> 01:40:34,560
but he had time
to think of me?

1487
01:40:37,064 --> 01:40:39,280
He loved me.

1488
01:40:39,315 --> 01:40:41,318
That motherfucker.

1489
01:40:50,293 --> 01:40:51,760
What do you say, Willie?

1490
01:40:51,795 --> 01:40:53,380
What do you say, there?
How you doing?

1491
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,430
I'm here.
How you doing?

1492
01:40:55,466 --> 01:40:58,469
Oh, I can't complain.
Got some good news.

1493
01:40:58,503 --> 01:41:00,753
Remember some
of them English boys?

1494
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:02,304
They didn't forget about us.

1495
01:41:02,338 --> 01:41:04,282
Been telling all
Europe about us.

1496
01:41:04,317 --> 01:41:06,225
Want us to come
over there and play.

1497
01:41:06,726 --> 01:41:09,479
I ain't got no money to get
on no plane to no England.

1498
01:41:09,514 --> 01:41:12,231
You don't need no money.
They're gonna pay for everything.

1499
01:41:15,735 --> 01:41:16,520
You're serious?

1500
01:41:17,104 --> 01:41:18,521
We're going to England.

1501
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:27,746
I'm a little bit...

1502
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:29,747
A little bit nervous here.

1503
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:33,217
Nervous?
What you nervous about?

1504
01:41:33,252 --> 01:41:35,253
You've been performing
your whole life.

1505
01:41:35,288 --> 01:41:39,253
Yeah, but not...
Not for these folks over here.

1506
01:41:43,096 --> 01:41:44,597
How am I supposed to
know what they want?

1507
01:41:44,632 --> 01:41:46,230
This is your captain speaking.

1508
01:41:46,265 --> 01:41:48,268
We are now beginning our
descent into Heathrow Airport.

1509
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:49,853
Here we go.

1510
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:01,064
Welcome to London.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

1511
01:42:02,565 --> 01:42:05,034
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1512
01:42:15,378 --> 01:42:18,430
- A pleasure to see you, Mr. Waters.
- Mr. Waters!

1513
01:42:24,921 --> 01:42:28,466
They want you,
Mr. Waters. They want you.

1514
01:42:28,502 --> 01:42:32,011
We sued Chess Records
for back royalties.

1515
01:42:32,046 --> 01:42:34,030
And we did all right.

1516
01:42:34,065 --> 01:42:35,980
Well, especially me.

1517
01:42:36,015 --> 01:42:40,654
Because I wrote all those songs that Muddy,
Walter and Wolf were singing.

1518
01:42:41,404 --> 01:42:42,904
I got paid.

1519
01:42:42,939 --> 01:42:44,907
And I'm still getting paid.

1520
01:42:44,942 --> 01:42:47,944
I made enough money
to buy this here studio.

1521
01:42:48,444 --> 01:42:51,247
They were going to tear it down,
but I knew it was history.

1522
01:42:51,283 --> 01:42:52,332
<i>I'm a man</i>

1523
01:42:52,832 --> 01:42:55,583
<i>Don't matter if you
got the upper hand</i>

1524
01:42:55,618 --> 01:42:59,122
We made the kind of music that
can grow into anything,

1525
01:42:59,157 --> 01:43:02,626
rhythm and blues,
rock and roll, hip hop.

1526
01:43:02,661 --> 01:43:04,395
Whatever you're playing, baby,

1527
01:43:04,430 --> 01:43:06,128
we're right there with you.

1528
01:43:08,097 --> 01:43:09,682
Just sprinkle
a little blues on it

1529
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,186
and it's gonna grow up
to be big and bad.

1530
01:43:13,686 --> 01:43:16,189
We the hoochie coochie seed.

1531
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:19,475
<i>I'm a M-A-N</i>

1532
01:43:21,478 --> 01:43:23,862
<i>I'm a big fish
in the small pond</i>

1533
01:43:23,896 --> 01:43:26,782
<i>Left to cut you for
the city to get it done</i>

1534
01:43:26,817 --> 01:43:29,235
<i>They underestimate me,
try to treat me like a boy</i>

1535
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:32,622
<i>But I flipped it around, now
I'm the one they can't ignore</i>

1536
01:43:32,658 --> 01:43:35,457
<i>I know what I'm worth
and I want every cent</i>

1537
01:43:35,492 --> 01:43:38,460
<i>Try to show me again
and I'm gonna click in this biz</i>

1538
01:43:38,494 --> 01:43:41,497
<i>Just to give me what's mine,
