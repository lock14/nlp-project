1
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,898
And good, very good.

2
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,274
And...

3
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,693
Just bring the shine down on the lips.

4
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,778
Yeah, I got it.

5
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,196
Put the J somewhere,
maybe there?

6
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,197
What do you think?

7
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,241
- Try the right.
- Okay. How about there?

8
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,575
Yeah, I like that.

9
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,786
Let's get crazy.

10
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,371
- Take a break?
- Five minutes.

11
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,914
- How's it look?
- Looks great.

12
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,229
Excellent.

13
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,154
Hey.

14
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,032
So what did they say?

15
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,327
Really?

16
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,455
I can't just get one day?

17
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,877
No, it's just, you know,
I thought maybe I'd get

18
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,628
one day of rest, but obviously not.

19
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,425
Okay.

20
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,595
No, whatever.

21
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,388
Thanks for trying.

22
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,848
All right.

23
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:58,150
You're the only one
that loves me, Suzie.

24
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,331
Hi. You doing okay?

25
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,250
Um, I'll have an apple martini.

26
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,794
And if I could get a water and a dish?

27
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,045
You got it.

28
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,319
Hey, Suzie, is that good?

29
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,778
Yeah.

30
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,827
Where am I?

31
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,015
Fuck you!

32
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,440
How did you get in my apartment?

33
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,443
Let me out of here, you fuck!

34
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:39,862
You bastard!

35
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,532
Dirty voyeur.

36
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,077
You won't get away with this.

37
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,872
There will be police all over this!

38
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:45,135
Please let me go!

39
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,345
I'm sorry!

40
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,096
I'll do anything you want.

41
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,473
Anything.

42
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,976
I promise I won't disobey you.

43
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,354
Please!

44
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,609
Please. Please.

45
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,447
No, please! I'm sorry!

46
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,784
I'm sorry!

47
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,245
No!

48
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,288
Please...

49
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,125
No!

50
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,461
Please.

51
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,797
No! Please, no!

52
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:22,798
Please!

53
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,092
No! Please!

54
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,260
No!

55
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,803
Stop!

56
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,972
Our Father,
which are in Heaven...

57
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,224
- I'm sorry. Please!
...hallowed be Thy name.

58
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,144
Get me out of here!

59
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,002
No, please. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

60
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,297
No. No.

61
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,425
I'll do whatever you want.

62
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,886
Anything!

63
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,223
No!

64
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,350
No. No!

65
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,565
No!

66
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,568
No!

67
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,448
Help!

68
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,454
No, you know what? They're...

69
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,247
No. Never.

70
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,124
There's definitely no Mr. Right.

71
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,459
I guess my parents weren't in line

72
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,002
when the loving gene
was being passed out.

73
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,328
No!

74
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,656
What are you doing?

75
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:08,161
Please.

76
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,329
I have money.

77
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,914
Please, I'll give you whatever you want.

78
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,835
Just... tell me
what you need and I can...

79
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:18,255
I can get it for you.

80
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,389
Please.

81
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,683
Please.

82
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,900
Please.

83
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,194
Please.

84
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,778
Why?

85
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,072
Please let me go.

86
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,040
No! No!

87
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,709
What is that?

88
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:02,049
No!

89
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:04,551
Please.

90
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,845
No! No!

91
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,143
No! No!

92
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,523
No.

93
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,566
No!

94
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,529
No!

95
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:26,031
No! Please!

96
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,032
No!

97
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:47,381
Yeah, I think, um... How should I put this?

98
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:48,966
Beauty opens doors, doesn't it?

99
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,718
Look, it's not just me who thinks this way.

100
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,220
This is a scientific fact.

101
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:56,014
Beauty rules, and it always has,
and it always will.

102
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,276
Captured.

103
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,189
Please!

104
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:10,941
Please.

105
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,277
Please help me.

106
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,779
Help.

107
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,048
Hey.

108
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:37,551
Hey. Matches.

109
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:46,435
I'm Gary.

110
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,728
Jennifer.

111
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:48,854
We can't waste those.

112
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,272
What do we do
when they're all gone?

113
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,566
We're just going to keep talking, okay?
We're going to talk our way through.

114
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,902
- We gotta get out of here.
- But this whole place is sealed.

115
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:56,820
I think it's like
some kind of wine cellar.

116
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,614
I tried going through the vents.

117
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,574
I got part of the way.

118
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,409
He caught me.

119
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,287
Have you seen him?

120
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,830
No. He's been drugging me.

121
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:09,374
I have absolutely no fucking sense of time.

122
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,462
God, I know this might
sound incredibly selfish,

123
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,547
but right now I'm thanking God I'm not alone.

124
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,342
Me, too.

125
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:53,544
You okay?

126
00:29:57,756 --> 00:29:59,466
Did you just hear that?

127
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,972
Come on down here right now!

128
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,143
You think he's been listening to us?

129
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,062
Gotta figure yeah.

130
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,189
Assuming he is even a he.

131
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:15,691
Oh, trust me, he's a he.

132
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,568
You know that for a fact?

133
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:20,112
Yeah. I've been stalked,
and I know creeps.

134
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:21,613
It comes with the job.

135
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:25,826
Are you telling me it's, like,
a big deal that you're gone?

136
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:27,744
Maybe, maybe not.

137
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,038
I flaked out a couple times.

138
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,590
He knows all about me.

139
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:41,175
He's been to my apartment.

140
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,385
Yeah, he got books and stuff from mine.

141
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,637
Yeah, he's got my clothes.

142
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,139
Everything else was easy.

143
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:49,099
Easy?

144
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,476
Every interviewer's asked me
anything you can imagine.

145
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:52,728
"What are you afraid of?

146
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,147
What's your idea of hell?"

147
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:56,815
You always give them the answers?

148
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,109
Sometimes you tell them the truth,
sometimes you don't.

149
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,652
But even your idea of hell...

150
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,404
I didn't tell them that.

151
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,032
Because. Isolation.

152
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,241
Fuck.

153
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:07,576
Damn it.

154
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,121
It's okay. Look at me.

155
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,042
How did he get you?

156
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:22,090
I got suckered into going
to this... charity event at a club in Soho.

157
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:26,428
Someone must have put something
in my drink.

158
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:29,014
The last thing that I remember

159
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,016
was ... at the bathroom.

160
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:39,608
At the end of day two of search
for actress and model Jennifer Tree

161
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,652
Police still have no leads.

162
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:45,113
A spokesman of the celebrity told the station
that they have a heard from her.

163
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:49,076
She was last seen two nights ago
when the star starting benefit of Soho slub.

164
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:34,204
If you're in here...

165
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,497
what do you want?

166
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,961
I knew you were going to do this to me, too.

167
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:44,173
You know? I've never been
comfortable with the dark...

168
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:45,757
...being alone.

169
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:48,427
It's always been a phobia.

170
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:51,138
Just, nature is so awesome, don't you think?

171
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:54,766
It was sort of scary,
too, at the same time, even though I loved it.

172
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:58,353
All that space is what freaks me out.

173
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:26,358
Help!

174
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:29,778
Here in the public eye,

175
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:31,613
how could they refuse
the business, you know?

176
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:33,740
It's just sort of...
I helped them in a way.

177
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,994
Help!

178
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,957
Help! Help me!

179
00:34:44,376 --> 00:34:45,252
Jennifer!

180
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,546
Help!

181
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:51,633
Let me out of here!

182
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,847
Please!

183
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,267
Oh, my God.

184
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:01,560
Help! Help!

185
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,437
Hey! Don't you touch her!

186
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,355
Help me!

187
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,027
Fuck!

188
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,071
I'll find you!
I'll find you!

189
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:16,158
Help!

190
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,496
Stop!

191
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:24,416
Help!

192
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:26,210
Please!

193
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:29,505
No!

194
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:30,964
Help!

195
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:32,382
Help!

196
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:37,387
Wait!

197
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,474
No!

198
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:42,100
Help!

199
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:49,816
Come on.

200
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,323
It's okay.

201
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,449
I gotcha.
I gotcha.

202
00:35:57,533 --> 00:35:58,867
Come on!

203
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,168
- Keep moving.
- What?

204
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:10,420
Keep moving.
Come on, come on.

205
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:18,178
Where are we?

206
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,222
Crawl space.

207
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:21,890
The ground floor to this house...

208
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,017
it's just above our heads, I think.

209
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,730
Come on.

210
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,136
Fuck!

211
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:06,143
"Why do bad things happen
to good people," you ask?

212
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:09,021
That's the mystery.

213
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:15,777
No!

214
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,194
- Battery's dead.
- Pop the hood!

215
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,869
Fire it up!

216
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,016
Gary! Gary!

217
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:30,811
Gary! No!

218
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:35,607
No! Damn it!

219
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,276
No! No!

220
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,277
Shit.

221
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:40,737
No! No!

222
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:00,174
Suzie?

223
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,384
Suzie!

224
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,555
Oh, God.

225
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,226
No.

226
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:17,900
Oh, shit.

227
00:39:21,987 --> 00:39:23,322
Please.

228
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:31,747
Oh, God!

229
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:36,543
No, please. Shit.

230
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,420
No.

231
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:42,966
No!

232
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:49,348
No.

233
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,401
Damn it.

234
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:07,074
I'm sorry.

235
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:35,227
...looking for any kind of lead.

236
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:40,190
So far, they've interviewed everyone
from the doorman to the caterer...

237
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,885
Suzie.

238
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,761
Suzie. Suzie.

239
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,639
Suzie! Hi! Hi!

240
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:34,077
- I was a rebel.
- Really?

241
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:35,287
In high school.

242
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,414
Always had, like,
a little bra strap showing,

243
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:38,749
black lipstick, you know.

244
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,460
God. But you know,
I liked the attention...

245
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:44,463
walking down the sidewalk,
and all those eyes on me.

246
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:45,631
Right.

247
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:50,636
But you know, if a guy tried to talk to me,
I was like, whoa, so out of there.

248
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:41,478
We're not getting out of here, are we?

249
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:48,694
He's playing with us,
showing his power.

250
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:14,219
Fuck.

251
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:19,141
When the doors opened, we didn't move.

252
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,893
I wanted to.

253
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,811
Yes.

254
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:24,771
I was afraid that you weren't real.

255
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,481
What's real?

256
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,650
What you can touch.

257
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,789
Key number 4.

258
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:48,504
No, don't.

259
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,231
Come here!

260
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:35,944
What's real? Tell me again.

261
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,321
What you can touch.

262
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:46,288
Wha...

263
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,123
What is that?

264
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,250
Gary. It's my son(?).

265
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:04,014
- Oh, no.
- Don't look at that.

266
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,724
No, don't look at that.

267
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,685
No.

268
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,322
You sick, twisted freak!

269
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,249
Don't think I know?

270
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:33,710
Gary!

271
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:34,795
Come on!

272
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,892
No!

273
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:06,535
Don't kill her.

274
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:08,954
I'm sorry.

275
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,622
No.

276
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,291
I'm sorry, Jennifer.

277
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,834
No, don't kill him!

278
00:47:13,959 --> 00:47:16,003
What do you want to hear?

279
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:18,547
Tell me what you want to hear!

280
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,425
Don't kill him!

281
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:43,947
Are you going to kill me?

282
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:07,721
Fucker.

283
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:09,932
Jen.
Jennifer.

284
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:15,979
No. No.
Gary.

285
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:18,023
Please get us out of here!

286
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:20,108
No! No!
Gary!

287
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:22,361
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

288
00:48:23,487 --> 00:48:24,821
Oh, God.

289
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:29,826
I'm so sorry, baby.

290
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:33,288
You know when Mommy touches you,

291
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:35,666
I really love you.

292
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:44,132
Do you... Do you like it
when Mommy touches you, baby?

293
00:48:45,884 --> 00:48:49,972
I just love to touch you.

294
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,808
Mommy doesn't feel very good, but, um...

295
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:59,189
it makes me feel really, really good.

296
00:49:01,024 --> 00:49:03,527
I'm so sorry that...

297
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:24,464
Ga... Gary!

298
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,207
Hey! Hey!

299
00:49:58,332 --> 00:49:59,541
Oh, Gary!

300
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,126
Don't touch her! Hey!

301
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:04,129
- Get off of me!
- You sick bastard!

302
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:05,297
Hey! Hey!

303
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,633
You twisted asshole! Hey!

304
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,510
Hey! Hey!

305
00:50:09,635 --> 00:50:11,512
- Oh! What...
- Don't you even touch her!

306
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,931
You sick piece of crap!

307
00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:15,724
- What...
- Hey!

308
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,100
Look at me! Look at me!

309
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:18,644
Hey! Yes, you!

310
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:21,772
- No!
- Me! Me, not her!

311
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,148
Me! Yeah!

312
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,526
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Yeah, bring it...

313
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:29,279
Please! No! Stop! No!

314
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:32,574
No! No! Stop it!

315
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:33,742
No!

316
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:37,162
Stop! No!

317
00:50:37,204 --> 00:50:39,540
Fuck you!

318
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:42,334
No! Oh, my God!

319
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:50,050
Oh, God! Gary!

320
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:01,728
God, I'm not your mother!

321
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,481
You know what? Kill me!

322
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,608
Go! I'm ready! Do it!

323
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:07,693
Fuck you!

324
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:24,501
Gary.

325
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:31,675
Jennifer.

326
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,219
- Jennifer?
- Oh, thank God.

327
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,189
Still no new news in
Jennifer Tree disappearance.

328
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,442
And is last night the modelist
have been missing for four days.

329
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:50,903
Police ... for any kind of lead.

330
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:52,029
So far the interviews...

331
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,406
Can't stop staring at you.

332
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:57,075
Guess you get that
a lot, though, huh?

333
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:02,414
Can't stop touching you.

334
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:03,832
Me, neither.

335
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,288
Jennifer.

336
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:25,497
Jen.

337
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,832
I'm tired.

338
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,084
Come on.
Get on your feet.

339
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,752
Hey, hey.
Jennifer, talk to me.

340
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:34,882
I can't.
Just let me sleep.

341
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:40,053
Jen, can you hear me?

342
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:47,895
Fuck.

343
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:45,721
...feel really, really good.

344
00:55:46,305 --> 00:55:48,765
I'm so sorry that I make you mad.

345
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:51,476
....

346
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,396
Gary...

347
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:58,066
Gary, is that you?

348
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,485
Gary?

349
00:57:02,005 --> 00:57:03,674
That's for fucking up the cameras.

350
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,760
Those cost money.
Are you nuts?

351
00:57:06,885 --> 00:57:08,762
You should show me
just a little bit of respect, man.

352
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:11,306
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

353
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,517
Shoes off up here.

354
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,270
How often do I have to tell you that?

355
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:27,739
- Why'd you put her out now?
- Don't.

356
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:31,159
Thought you were going to wait till morning,

357
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:35,956
have another night of hero sex.

358
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,041
It was my call.

359
00:57:40,669 --> 00:57:42,004
Okay.

360
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,401
Was it good?

361
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,613
One of the best.

362
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:17,247
Don't you ever want to be the one?

363
00:58:17,581 --> 00:58:18,790
The one?

364
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,375
Experiencing it.

365
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,920
Hah, I do.

366
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:24,296
Always.

367
00:58:27,049 --> 00:58:31,178
You're inside her, I'm inside her.

368
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,725
Doesn't it ever get predictable for you?

369
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,727
That's the point.

370
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:40,854
Predicting it.

371
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:44,525
I said it would be the fourth day.

372
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:47,694
It's the fourth day.

373
00:58:47,819 --> 00:58:50,405
She worships you.

374
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:52,282
What if I don't want to end this one?

375
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:54,159
Oh.

376
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:55,869
Well, you know the drill.

377
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:58,413
The last one didn't even last three days.

378
00:58:58,497 --> 00:59:02,459
It's not like we got
anything written in stone.

379
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,002
Hey, look at me.

380
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,796
No, no, no, look at me.

381
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:07,673
We do this now

382
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:11,260
while she's still a smile on your little face.

383
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:14,555
Ben... I don't know about this girl.

384
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,016
I feel like this could be the one.

385
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:22,020
You stop playing the game
before it starts playing you.

386
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:27,693
What do I always tell you?

387
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:29,862
Play them...

388
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:31,488
Not with them.

389
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:36,451
It wouldn't last.

390
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:42,082
It's the tapes and the
books that make it better,

391
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,917
make it last forever, right?

392
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,632
I'm so sorry.

393
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:53,051
I'm so sorry.

394
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,210
Hello.

395
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:09,294
Yes?

396
01:01:09,378 --> 01:01:10,712
NYPD.

397
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:12,297
Mr. Dexter?

398
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,562
Which Mr. Dexter do you want?

399
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:29,022
Benjamin Dexter.
Is he home?

400
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:31,900
Uh, no.
I can tell him you stopped by.

401
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:33,986
You are?

402
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:35,445
I'm his brother.

403
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:37,239
Yeah, like the truck says, huh?

404
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:40,742
- Dexter Brothers? Right?
- Yeah.

405
01:01:40,826 --> 01:01:43,662
So are you gonna open
the door, Mr. Dexter...

406
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:45,581
...or are we gonna knock it off the hinges?

407
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:51,086
You two always
live together?

408
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,965
No. This was our parents' house.
My brother lives here.

409
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:58,510
That's a pretty bad cut you got there, man.
You all right?

410
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:01,054
Oh, God, yeah.
No, it's, uh... Football.

411
01:02:01,138 --> 01:02:03,140
Go ahead.
You were saying?

412
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:06,226
Uh, I was just saying
that I'm staying here for a few days

413
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:07,769
while my apartment's being refurnished.

414
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,897
Where would that be?

415
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,815
Queens.

416
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:13,442
Hey, your sink doesn't work in there.

417
01:02:13,483 --> 01:02:16,361
Yeah, I know.
My brother doesn't use this floor too much.

418
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:18,488
So, you guys,
you wanna tell me why you're here?

419
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:20,532
Well, we're investigating a missing person.

420
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:22,159
Uh, it's a woman.

421
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:23,994
- Here's a picture.

422
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,748
Pretty girl.
How can I help?

423
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:30,751
We just need to check on everyone
that works for Dexter's Catering.

424
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,044
Two minutes, man.

425
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,962
Couple questions,
we're outta here in no time.

426
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:36,215
Yeah, sure. Do you guys
want a drink or something?

427
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,927
Sure.
You got any iced tea?

428
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:42,346
Yeah, I think I do.

429
01:02:42,471 --> 01:02:43,889
- You want one?
- Anything.

430
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:45,599
Okay. Excuse me.

431
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:47,351
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah, go ahead.

432
01:02:48,602 --> 01:02:50,312
Take your time, man.

433
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:07,162
Hey. Thought we'd save you the trip.

434
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:09,623
Sure.

435
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:14,503
So then, you're not in the catering business
with your brother, then?

436
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:18,048
Well, I help him out once
in a while when he's in a pinch.

437
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:20,050
Like Tuesday night.
Club Shine?

438
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:21,969
No, I wasn't there.

439
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:23,679
You weren't there at all?

440
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,805
No.

441
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:31,520
Okay.

442
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:33,146
- Here's my card.
- Thank you.

443
01:03:33,313 --> 01:03:35,399
Okay.
Oh, you know what?

444
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:37,067
The playoff game is on Channel 9.

445
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:38,902
- It's the last quarter.
- That's right.

446
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:42,072
Do you mind if we check
the score real quick?

447
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,366
- Channel 9?
- Yeah.

448
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:47,744
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah.

449
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:50,873
Maybe your brother will be back
by the time the game is over.

450
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,083
Hey, look at this.
We're winning.

451
01:03:54,376 --> 01:03:55,961
All right.

452
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:03,260
Oh, man.
What the fuck is this roaches shit?

453
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:08,473
Get the fuck outta here.

454
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:09,892
Look at this fuck...

455
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,971
Gotta wake up, Jennifer.

456
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:52,267
- You gotta wake up. It's over.
- No.

457
01:04:52,351 --> 01:04:53,810
- Over?
- It's over.

458
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:55,479
- What's over?
- This.

459
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:57,773
There's no one to keep us here anymore.

460
01:04:57,856 --> 01:04:59,608
How?

461
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:05,113
I killed them.

462
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:07,282
- Them?
- Yeah, there was two of them.

463
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:09,284
- I killed them.
- Oh, my God.

464
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:14,498
They underestimated me.
One of them came in, and I was ready for him.

465
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:16,333
And I got his gun...

466
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:17,751
Where are they?

467
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:20,712
They're upstairs.
We... We gotta make a move. Come on.

468
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,339
Where are we?

469
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,091
In some old house.

470
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:26,802
I haven't been outside.

471
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:29,179
I don't know where we are.

472
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:34,685
Did you call the police?

473
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:35,519
Not yet.

474
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:36,603
Where's the phone?

475
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:37,771
I don't know.

476
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:48,824
Come on.

477
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:49,950
Here's the phone.

478
01:05:50,117 --> 01:05:52,369
No, not yet.
Wait. Sit down.

479
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:56,248
I think these sick fuckers
were taping us.

480
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,586
You know, I wanna find those tapes.

481
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:02,504
If they get in the wrong hands, you know...

482
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:05,757
You okay?

483
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:36,038
Gary! Gary!

484
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:37,247
Gary!

485
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:00,687
He was alive.

486
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:03,690
You did what you had to do.

487
01:07:03,815 --> 01:07:05,692
He had a gun.
He would have...

488
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:07,528
Jen, listen to me.

489
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:09,363
You did nothing wrong.

490
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,201
He had a gun.

491
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:16,328
I should never have left you alone.

492
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:20,499
Maybe you should come with me.

493
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:21,750
Don't touch anything, okay?

494
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:24,336
No, the phones are dead.
We need to call for help.

495
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,469
Sit down.
Now wait right here, okay?

496
01:07:32,553 --> 01:07:35,514
Don't even think
about what you just did.

497
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:38,016
Now, a few minutes more,
we're gonna be outta here.

498
01:09:43,767 --> 01:09:44,768
Beg.

499
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:58,258
Oh, my God.

500
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:21,406
I need you to help me clean up.

501
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,674
You belong to me.

502
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:39,842
Yeah.

503
01:11:41,093 --> 01:11:42,094
Show me.

504
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,503
You little...

505
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:23,153
It's not dark.

506
01:13:26,823 --> 01:13:28,367
It's not dark.

507
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,642
You naughty girl.

508
01:14:36,435 --> 01:14:38,228
- Don't be stupid.
- Shit.

509
01:14:38,395 --> 01:14:41,148
Where are you gonna go?

510
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:43,734
Come on, you couldn't
even find yourself in broad daylight.

511
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,570
Come on!

512
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:50,908
There's no one
coming for you!

513
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:54,119
I'm all you got!

514
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:19,102
Jennifer?

515
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:24,650
There's nowhere to go, Jennifer.

516
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:57,224
Thank you.

517
01:15:58,559 --> 01:15:59,852
Thank you, Jen.

518
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:20,205
What's real, Gary?

519
01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:21,206
Huh?

520
01:16:21,331 --> 01:16:23,041
Put the gun down, Jen.

521
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,213
Put it down.

522
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:31,925
Down.

523
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,032
You should have...

524
01:16:55,073 --> 01:16:56,992
cocked it, sweetheart.

525
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:10,589
You look so beautiful.

526
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:14,134
You're so fucking beautiful.

527
01:17:15,219 --> 01:17:16,261
- Are you ready?
- No.

528
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:17,471
Are you ready?

529
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:50,462
Thanks for the lesson...

530
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:51,797
Gary.

531
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:54,878
I'm with model Jennifer Tree

532
01:19:55,003 --> 01:19:58,590
on the one-year anniversary
of her abduction.

533
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:01,218
Jennifer, thank you for speaking with us.

534
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:04,054
- How are you?
- It's been a tough year.

535
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:07,641
- How so?
- It's taken me time to accept what happened.

536
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:10,269
- It hasn't been easy.
- I'm sure it hasn't.

537
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:13,063
But you look great.
Are you starting to mend?

538
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:16,900
I don't think anyone
could ever get over something like that.

539
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:18,861
I've read many
of your accounts.

540
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:20,988
These people are...
They're sick.

541
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:23,657
Would you mind telling us
about your ordeal?

542
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:26,785
There's no emotion to it.

543
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,414
No feelings of remorse.

544
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:32,916
No feelings of regret.

545
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,251
No pity.

546
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:36,545
Just relief.

547
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:37,713
Closure.

548
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:42,759
And when it's over,
they make a record of what they've done.

549
01:20:47,472 --> 01:20:51,393
And then they move
on to the next victim.

550
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,812
Wow. Chilling.

551
01:20:53,937 --> 01:20:56,523
Well, with the controversy
over this vigilante

552
01:20:56,648 --> 01:21:00,569
who's hunted down and killed
two serial killers in the last year,

553
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:02,446
what do you think of the vigilante?

554
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:03,947
Is it right to kill people?

555
01:21:04,031 --> 01:21:05,782
Even if they are bad?

556
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:08,952
