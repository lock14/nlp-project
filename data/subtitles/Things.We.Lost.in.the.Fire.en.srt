1
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:03,725
-Dad?
-Yeah?

2
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,394
The water's green.

3
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:10,033
No, it's fluorescent.

4
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:12,407
-What's...
-Fluorescent.

5
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:18,349
Fluorescent means "lit from within."

6
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,186
So am I fluorescent?

7
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:28,019
Yeah, Dory, you are.

8
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:53,112
It's okay, honey.

9
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:03,061
Why has Grandma
been sleeping all day?

10
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:07,831
Well, she's sedated, sweetie.

11
00:02:09,302 --> 00:02:12,100
I don't know
what that word means, Mom.

12
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:18,109
It means that she's been taking pills
so she can sleep.

13
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,775
She lost her son, Harper.

14
00:02:26,152 --> 00:02:29,644
There's nothing more painful
in the whole wide world.

15
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,817
More than losing your dad?

16
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,256
Different.

17
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,299
Different.

18
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,029
-Cousin Laura's coming.
-Really? Why?

19
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,101
I haven't spoken to her in over 10 years.

20
00:03:21,741 --> 00:03:23,766
That's Brian's computer.

21
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:31,010
I can't go in there, so can you...

22
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,210
Okay. Okay. It's okay. I got it.

23
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:49,062
Who is "Snakes290"?

24
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,634
Oh, God.

25
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:55,673
He's an old college friend of Brian's
that now lives in Michigan.

26
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:56,969
What does it say?

27
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:01,035
He said, "What do you think of
the Sonics' new power forward?"

28
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,582
Well, what did he think of them?

29
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:08,980
He thought he was a good rebounder,

30
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,057
but his outside jumper
needed some work.

31
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,818
Then write that.

32
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:22,166
All right. I can do that.

33
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,932
Shit!

34
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:32,601
-What? What? What?
-Shit!

35
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:33,939
What's wrong, Audrey?

36
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,378
-I forgot to tell somebody.
-Who?

37
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:39,246
Neal, can you take me down to Renton?

38
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:42,718
-Renton? You can't call?
-No, he doesn't have a phone.

39
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,084
Who doesn't have a phone, sweetie?

40
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:47,715
-Can you take me?
-No, honey! Come on, now!

41
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:51,786
Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

42
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,296
I can go.

43
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,863
Look, right around here from...

44
00:04:55,968 --> 00:05:00,632
There's his address book,
and look up a Jerry Sunborne.

45
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:02,741
Who's Jerry Sunborne, darling?

46
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:06,308
Who the hell is Jerry Sunborne?

47
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:42,945
You want something to eat?

48
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,743
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

49
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,803
I just couldn't...

50
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:15,211
-Do you have another one of those?
-Yeah.

51
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:17,846
Thank you.

52
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,126
I'm Howard Glassman.

53
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:32,323
I'm Jerry.

54
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,993
How did you know Brian?

55
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,967
We grew up together.

56
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:48,306
I just live down the street
and financed some of his deals...

57
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:55,145
-Oh, no.
-I'm sorry.

58
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:57,347
Well, I'm...

59
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:00,854
My wife.

60
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:04,327
It's nice to meet you, Jerry.

61
00:07:05,564 --> 00:07:07,964
So you started smoking again?

62
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,713
Come on! Get out of the way!

63
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:34,655
All right! I bet you I could jump over it!

64
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,421
I'm gonna jump over it!

65
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,097
You don't know?

66
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:44,862
I guess your brain's
growing up too small.

67
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:49,405
-Hey.
-Hello. Hi.

68
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:51,100
Hi. I'm David.

69
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:54,076
My name is Jerry. You're Harper.

70
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:56,211
-Yeah.
-Hi.

71
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:58,374
-Hi.
-Dory.

72
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,889
Your dad was my best friend.

73
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,558
When?

74
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:18,262
When I was your age, and last week.

75
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:29,475
<i>Strawberry Fields Forever
is your favorite song.</i>

76
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:33,244
And Dory's got that scar on his nose

77
00:08:33,352 --> 00:08:36,287
'cause he was running and he thought
the screen door was open.

78
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:38,117
But it was closed.

79
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,384
Everybody knows that, Dory.

80
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,117
You don't like mimes.
They scare you.

81
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:45,230
They don't talk.

82
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:47,925
Yeah, that's what they do.

83
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:51,765
Your suit is a little big.

84
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:55,899
Thank you.

85
00:08:56,008 --> 00:08:58,306
That was imprudent of you.

86
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:00,469
I bet you can't do this.

87
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:05,509
Fast.

88
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,614
-Hi.
-Hey, Jerry.

89
00:09:42,855 --> 00:09:44,379
I'm so sorry.

90
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,158
Thanks for coming.

91
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:53,823
I'm really glad you came.

92
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:57,390
I wasn't so sure
you would actually come,

93
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,663
-so, thank you.
-No problem.

94
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,634
I hated you.

95
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,979
I hated you for so many years, Jerry.

96
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:18,647
It's all right.

97
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:22,716
And now, it just all seems so silly.

98
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:31,330
He was so loyal to a fault, you know.

99
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:37,601
Most people would've given up on you.
Hell, I would've.

100
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,038
But he didn't.

101
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:48,780
I know.

102
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,757
I'm gonna go.

103
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:57,555
No, I... Wait.

104
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,791
I need you to stay.

105
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,902
Please, can you just stay for a little bit?

106
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:06,630
-Sure.
-Just a little bit?

107
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:09,468
Sure. Sure.

108
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:12,601
Good.

109
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,651
So Brian is maybe six years old,

110
00:11:22,788 --> 00:11:25,723
and we're the Andersons' guests
at Flathead Country Club,

111
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,416
and we're swimming in the pool,

112
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,494
and all of the sudden,
Brian gets out of the water

113
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:32,756
and he pulls his bathing suit down
and he takes a piss right in the pool.

114
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:35,993
And people are just freaking out.

115
00:11:36,135 --> 00:11:38,126
June Anderson is freaking out.

116
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,500
People are going,
"What are you doing?"

117
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,904
I mean, he's peeing right in the pool
like it's a urinal, so...

118
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,636
Wow.

119
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:49,407
And when it was over I say,
"Brian, why did you do that?"

120
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:52,075
You know, I mean, he wasn't a bad kid.

121
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:54,652
He never acted out.
He's quiet, you know.

122
00:11:55,821 --> 00:12:00,485
And I said...
Okay, I'm totally messing this story up!

123
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:05,452
I said, "Why'd you..." Shut up!

124
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:07,964
I said, "Why did you do that?"

125
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:11,092
And he came back with something
that made no sense.

126
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:15,299
Shit. I forget what he said.
It was so funny. Shoot.

127
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:17,932
He said he didn't want
to get his bathing suit wet.

128
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:20,944
Yes! That was it!

129
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:24,812
"I didn't want...
I didn't want to get my bathing suit wet!"

130
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,441
That's okay!

131
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:29,214
He was a little retarded as a kid,
you know.

132
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:34,223
No, I'm sorry, but he was. He was...
He was slow, you know.

133
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:37,726
And, you know,
he came around eventually.

134
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,240
We home?

135
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:04,912
Don't let them grow up.

136
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:38,184
How about I make us some pasta?
Open the wine.

137
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:44,218
That way our vacation won't have to end
till tomorrow.

138
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:50,428
When I get back.

139
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:54,030
-No. No, Brian...
-I have to.

140
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:55,470
-Why?
-It's his birthday.

141
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:56,631
So?

142
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,936
Audrey, you didn't know him
when he was a kid. He was special.

143
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:00,203
Every time you leave here, Brian,

144
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:01,802
I'm scared to death
you're not gonna come back.

145
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:04,472
Oh, Jesus,
just stop being so damn dramatic.

146
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:06,550
You stop being so damn naive.

147
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:08,711
Audrey, it's his birthday.

148
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,153
Who the hell knows
how many more he's gonna have?

149
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:20,094
Mom?

150
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:27,692
-Hey, Jay.
-Hey.

151
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,324
Happy Birthday!

152
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:32,027
-August 3rd.
-August 3rd.

153
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:33,570
Yeah.

154
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:36,572
-You're an old man.
-Yeah.

155
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,608
Come on in. Come on in.

156
00:15:38,744 --> 00:15:41,679
-She okay?
-Yeah, she's fine. Have a seat.

157
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:49,320
I'm hungry.
You want to get something to eat?

158
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,514
-Yeah. Cool.
-Yeah? Let's go out.

159
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,954
-They got coffee, strawberry...
-No coffee. Strawberry.

160
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:56,583
-Strawberry?
-Yeah.

161
00:15:56,728 --> 00:15:59,788
-Will you try and find some soup?
-Okay.

162
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:01,523
So they're not happy with the work,
you know?

163
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,261
I think I'm gonna fire the workers.

164
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:08,905
And Audrey's fucking someone else.

165
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:11,903
Are you checking to see if I'm listening?

166
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,875
No, man. You don't understand.

167
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:19,076
This woman looks so good there is
no way that she is only fucking me.

168
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:21,049
Our neighbor's this guy
named Landon Hicks.

169
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:23,815
He's this rugged,
mountain-man type guy.

170
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:28,392
Big beard. Big hair. Doesn't even talk.

171
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:30,654
She's in love with Landon Hicks!

172
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:32,957
Well, you gotta take
the good with the bad.

173
00:16:33,098 --> 00:16:34,929
What's the good?

174
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,763
Are you still...

175
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:39,268
Yes, I am.

176
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,803
I mean, you're still in the rotation,
you know what I'm saying?

177
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:49,846
You know,
you gotta accept the good, man,

178
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:52,245
'cause they're gonna
make you accept the bad.

179
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,114
You have everything
any man would want.

180
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,451
Accept the good, Bri.
You have what I'll never have.

181
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:01,617
Oh, come on, don't talk
like that about yourself, all right?

182
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:06,026
Brian, you're my only real friend
left in the world, you know that?

183
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:14,667
Audrey angry
you came to see me tonight?

184
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,832
No.

185
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,171
Yes.

186
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:26,145
I don't know why you're so dead set
against seeing her again.

187
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:30,210
Well, I don't want to see anybody
until I'm clean. That's why.

188
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:40,528
So, the Fed raised rates.
Is that gonna affect you?

189
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,533
No, people will still buy.
This refi boom's got good legs.

190
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:45,966
Good.

191
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:31,942
Yeah?

192
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,545
Jerry?

193
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,380
Maybe. Who is it?

194
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,958
I'm Audrey Burke's brother, Neal.

195
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:50,257
Can you open the door, please?

196
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:51,460
Yeah.

197
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:04,209
Yeah.

198
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:08,046
Yeah?

199
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:11,750
Brian is dead.

200
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:13,919
He was killed.

201
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:17,153
Somebody killed him, and he's dead.

202
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:21,991
What the fuck are you talking about?

203
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,002
He's dead.

204
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,235
Are you fucking with me?

205
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:37,975
Some guy was beating up on his wife
and Brian...

206
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,445
What?

207
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:44,913
Brian's dead.

208
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:48,656
The funeral is today.

209
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,495
I'm here to take you to the funeral.

210
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:06,572
You better not be fucking with me, man.

211
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,643
Do you have a suit?

212
00:20:14,753 --> 00:20:16,653
Yeah, I got a suit.

213
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:28,161
At this time,
on behalf of the Burke family,

214
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:34,171
I'd like to thank those of you who have
been able to spend this time with us.

215
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:36,263
Many of you
have traveled a long distance,

216
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:38,342
and it is much appreciated.

217
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:42,607
In a few moments, we'll be going
to the Burke residence for the reception.

218
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:53,686
Okay? Okay.

219
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:37,326
Hey, what about chicken, Harper?
You can eat chicken, can't you?

220
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:40,097
Chickens are animals, Dad.
I don't eat animals.

221
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:41,331
Since when?

222
00:21:41,473 --> 00:21:44,135
-Since meat is murder.
-No more meat, honey.

223
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:45,799
-Dad?
-Meat is murder.

224
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:47,172
-Dad?
-Basically.

225
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:48,472
-Daddy?
-Where did you learn this?

226
00:21:48,613 --> 00:21:50,740
I know things.
Not everything I know was learned.

227
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:51,941
-Well, actually, that's not true.
-Dad!

228
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,677
The nature of knowledge
is that you learned it somewhere.

229
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:55,012
-Dad!
-Yes?

230
00:21:55,153 --> 00:21:57,178
-I like meat.
-I know you do.

231
00:21:57,322 --> 00:21:58,755
He likes meat, Harper.

232
00:21:58,857 --> 00:21:59,949
And he's gonna get bigger than you.

233
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,753
She does eat broccoli.

234
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,851
-I see.
-Don't you, baby?

235
00:22:06,564 --> 00:22:08,794
Did you take 60 bucks
out of the car, babe?

236
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,663
No.

237
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:13,168
That's funny, 'cause I had
three $20s in the ashtray,

238
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:14,328
and now they're gone.

239
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:16,303
No. I didn't take it.

240
00:22:22,414 --> 00:22:25,281
Was your friend in the car
the other night?

241
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:28,308
He didn't take it.

242
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,320
-Who?
-He wouldn't take it.

243
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,049
Who? Who wouldn't take it?

244
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,681
-Would you wake up, Brian?
-Nobody.

245
00:22:34,826 --> 00:22:36,054
Wake up!

246
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:40,893
-Wake up!
-All right.

247
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:43,563
-Mom, who?
-Jesus.

248
00:22:46,438 --> 00:22:50,067
Meat is so murder! Get her! Get her!

249
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:51,971
-Get her.
-Well, it is.

250
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:55,641
Yeah, come in.

251
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:58,409
Yeah, I know.
I can't stay. I gotta take off.

252
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,847
Oh, okay.

253
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:02,647
Well, it was very nice
hanging out with you.

254
00:23:02,754 --> 00:23:05,882
You know I appreciate it
more than you know, man.

255
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:08,151
-Well...
-Really.

256
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:10,386
-Happy birthday, man.
-Okay.

257
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,561
All right.

258
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,532
-It's good to see you.
-Take care.

259
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:19,830
Hey, don't forget the...

260
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,433
Don't forget what?

261
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:24,838
-Groceries.
-What?

262
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:34,749
Hey, pretty boy.

263
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,237
It's way past her bedtime.

264
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:40,482
Oh, no, you're not watching
that Lifetime movie again, are you?

265
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:42,483
It's this commercial we just saw.

266
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,417
You're crying over a commercial?

267
00:24:44,522 --> 00:24:48,014
Do you have any idea what they're doing
to baby seals in Alaska, honey?

268
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,526
They were so cute, Dad.
Please, give them a lot of money.

269
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:52,652
I wrote down the Web site.

270
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:54,856
-We need to make a really big donation.
-Okay. Okay, good.

271
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,466
Harper, out.

272
00:24:57,902 --> 00:24:58,926
Out.

273
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:03,266
-Good night, honey.
-Good night, Mom.

274
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,698
Seal hater.

275
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:13,540
Seal hater. Nice to meet you.

276
00:25:13,685 --> 00:25:15,653
I'm gonna go wash up.

277
00:25:25,563 --> 00:25:26,264
So how was he?

278
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:26,958
So how was he?

279
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,160
He's all fucked up, Audrey.

280
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,733
All fucked up.

281
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:38,740
You know, he said this thing to me,
didn't strike me until I was driving home.

282
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:41,470
He asked me if the Feds raising
the rates would affect my business.

283
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:43,979
Now, that has no relevance for Jerry
in his world, right?

284
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:45,879
He would have read it somewhere
and just remembered it

285
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,350
because he knew
it had relevance for me, you see?

286
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:49,715
And I know that you think I just go there

287
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:52,516
and I give, and I give, and he just takes,

288
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:53,750
but, you know, he's my friend.

289
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:56,519
He looks out for me, you understand?

290
00:25:57,028 --> 00:25:58,552
He's my friend.

291
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:00,423
Okay.

292
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:17,009
You know, they forgot to put
the dimmers on the lights.

293
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:21,381
I am gonna fire those guys,
and I'm gonna go with the Polish guys.

294
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:33,623
You're taking the kids swimming
at Howard's tomorrow.

295
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:36,563
All right. Dory's putting his head under.

296
00:26:36,668 --> 00:26:39,933
-Go easy on him, baby.
-Even if I have to push it.

297
00:26:40,071 --> 00:26:41,902
Well, that's nice.

298
00:26:43,341 --> 00:26:46,276
I told Jerry
you were fucking Landon Hicks.

299
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:48,810
You what?

300
00:26:50,782 --> 00:26:53,580
-Landon Hicks?
-He knows I was joking.

301
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:57,121
-Why would I be fucking Landon Hicks?
-I don't know.

302
00:26:57,422 --> 00:26:58,650
If I was gonna sleep with somebody

303
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,315
it sure as hell
wouldn't be Landon Hicks.

304
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:02,983
No? Why not?

305
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:06,426
Because he doesn't speak. That's why.

306
00:27:06,698 --> 00:27:08,427
Who would it be?

307
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:17,331
The water guy.

308
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:19,808
The water guy?

309
00:27:20,645 --> 00:27:21,669
Why?

310
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,106
Because.

311
00:27:24,215 --> 00:27:26,410
Why the water guy?

312
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:30,180
'Cause he reminds me of a cowboy.

313
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:33,085
The guy that brings
the Arrowhead water

314
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:35,682
reminds you of a cowboy.

315
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:37,294
Oh, yeah.

316
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:43,325
Shouldn't have asked
if you didn't want to know.

317
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:47,195
Come on. Do it.

318
00:27:49,173 --> 00:27:50,697
Okay, do it.

319
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,672
Please do it.

320
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,779
Come here.

321
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:01,682
That's it.

322
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:21,728
You guys need anything?

323
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:23,636
No, thanks, Howard.
You gonna come in?

324
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:26,175
-He doesn't swim.
-Okay.

325
00:28:26,277 --> 00:28:29,508
Who spends $200,000
on a swimming pool and doesn't swim?

326
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:30,842
All right, Doris, that's enough.

327
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:33,644
Maybe next time,
you'll try building a mosque.

328
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:37,509
That's funny.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

329
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:39,681
-One, two, three.
-Two...

330
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:46,920
-What happened?
-I don't feel like it.

331
00:28:47,064 --> 00:28:49,828
He's just being difficult
for the attention, Dad.

332
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,026
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

333
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:53,603
Why don't you go touch the drain
or something?

334
00:28:53,738 --> 00:28:55,501
Now, look, Dory, just try.

335
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:57,733
-I already did!
-No, you didn't.

336
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,672
Now, look, you got to face your fears.

337
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:02,371
Everybody has to in life, okay?
Now, you're a man.

338
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,745
You're almost six years old.
It's time. Now, let's do it.

339
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:07,544
I don't have to! You can't make me!

340
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,051
No, I can make you.

341
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:11,280
Baby! You're kidding.

342
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,348
-Am I kidding?
-Aren't you?

343
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:16,085
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we were kidding, right?
Why don't you go to Mommy?

344
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:18,218
-Yeah.
-I'll go swim with your sister.

345
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,524
Come on, baby. Come with Mommy.

346
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:25,796
'Cause your daddy
is a very abusive man.

347
00:29:34,245 --> 00:29:35,371
Hey.

348
00:29:36,447 --> 00:29:40,577
I put walnut stain on this thing.
Totally fucked it up.

349
00:29:42,587 --> 00:29:44,612
No, you didn't, I think it looks good.

350
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:47,155
You think I'm ever gonna get
an honest answer out of you,

351
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:50,658
or are you just gonna
love every single thing I do?

352
00:29:54,632 --> 00:29:58,090
It's... You know, I think it's ugly.

353
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:01,404
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

354
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:04,406
I steam it. I sand it. I stain it.

355
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:07,409
And after all of that,
I only got one chance at the finish.

356
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:11,174
And if I screw that up,
then the whole thing is messed up.

357
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:15,809
Well, what do I know?
'Cause I'm just here to deliver the water.

358
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:52,848
Dad!

359
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,293
I promised them Cold Stone.

360
00:30:57,395 --> 00:30:58,987
Dad!

361
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:01,155
To be continued.

362
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:02,289
Okay?

363
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,992
To be continued.

364
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:08,637
-Don't move, all right?
-I won't.

365
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:13,971
Hey, hey!

366
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:15,568
Daddy, I want strawberry and vanilla.

367
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:17,146
Okay. Strawberry and vanilla?

368
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,045
Yeah! And Dory wants chocolate,
strawberry and vanilla.

369
00:31:19,183 --> 00:31:20,980
What do you mean
strawberry and vanilla?

370
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:22,416
And Mom wants lemon.

371
00:31:22,553 --> 00:31:24,214
-Lemon? All right.
-Yeah.

372
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:35,425
I'll be back in a little while.

373
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:36,999
-Bye!
-Bye.

374
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:45,835
Dory.

375
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:52,372
You look like a little puppy
waiting for its owner.

376
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:56,112
Where's my ice cream?

377
00:31:58,155 --> 00:31:59,952
-Excuse me.
-Mom.

378
00:32:19,276 --> 00:32:22,268
That's funny. He's not answering.

379
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,449
Are you Mrs. Brian Burke?

380
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:18,297
-You love me. You love me.
-No.

381
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:20,996
-Damn it! You bitch!
-No!

382
00:33:21,138 --> 00:33:23,606
You don't love him, you love me!
Do you hear me?

383
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:25,265
Fuck! And you lied to me!

384
00:33:25,376 --> 00:33:27,503
Don't you ever say that to me again,
do you hear me?

385
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:29,943
-Don't you ever say that to me!
-Hey! Stop! Stop that!

386
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:31,674
-That's my wife! That's my wife!
-Stop! I don't care.

387
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:33,283
You're hurting her! Just leave her alone!

388
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:34,544
-You told me you were over him!
-Stop!

389
00:33:34,685 --> 00:33:36,550
Stop! Back off!

390
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,195
<i>-God.
-Just breathe and count to 10.</i>

391
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,319
<i>I'm breathing, man, all right?</i>

392
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:49,365
<i>Count to 10 for me.</i>

393
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:57,798
-One, two, three, four...
-Yeah, all right, man.

394
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,070
Yes, hi.

395
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:05,376
I need an ambulance
to Southwest Vista and Elm.

396
00:34:05,516 --> 00:34:10,249
I got a woman here. She's beaten.
She's badly beaten. It's domestic and...

397
00:34:15,693 --> 00:34:16,853
No!

398
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,498
I've got two kids.

399
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:36,570
I've got a 10-year-old girl
and a six-year-old little boy.

400
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:42,574
And they're in there waiting

401
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,746
for their daddy to come home
with ice cream.

402
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:49,283
I'm so sorry.

403
00:35:04,975 --> 00:35:06,602
What's going on?

404
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:29,048
Jerry?

405
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:32,045
Oh, I'm sorry.

406
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:34,249
He doesn't live here anymore.

407
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:37,019
Okay, can you tell me
where I can find him?

408
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:38,856
Try the McKinley Clinic.

409
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:43,099
Okay, the McKinley Clinic. Okay.

410
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:07,787
-Hey!
-Hi.

411
00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:12,785
What are you doing here?

412
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:18,563
I don't know.
I just wanted to see how you were.

413
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:22,066
Good to see you.

414
00:38:23,974 --> 00:38:25,771
Want some coffee? Water?

415
00:38:27,144 --> 00:38:28,736
-Yeah.
-Come on.

416
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,782
So this is a methadone clinic?

417
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,117
Yeah.

418
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:45,284
-You take methadone?
-Not me.

419
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:51,459
I just help around the clinic
and they give me a place to stay.

420
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,045
When was the last time you used?

421
00:39:06,216 --> 00:39:08,377
Sixteen days ago.

422
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,478
I tried to quit after the funeral,
but I relapsed.

423
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:25,834
So how are the kids?

424
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,574
Harper's messing up in school.

425
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:36,873
And Dory is

426
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:42,574
having nightmares
where his daddy is the monster.

427
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:54,596
-Would you like some more?
-No.

428
00:39:57,868 --> 00:39:59,665
I'm gonna shove off.

429
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,543
-Stop it, Harper!
-I'm not doing anything.

430
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:16,777
Stop it, Harper!

431
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:20,515
-Mom!
-Harper! Stop it!

432
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:23,115
You two are acting like little brats!

433
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,357
All I asked you to do this morning
was to sit here and eat quietly.

434
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:31,298
But you can't even seem to do that,
can you? Don't laugh, Dory!

435
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:32,561
-Okay!
-It's not funny!

436
00:40:57,261 --> 00:41:00,719
Mom? Can I sleep with you?

437
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:03,129
Yeah, honey. Come on.

438
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:07,269
Right here. There we go.

439
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,098
Oh, shit.

440
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:26,808
-Hey! Okay, look, here's the deal.
-Hi.

441
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:29,147
We had a fire in our garage.

442
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:32,813
The good news, we started to rebuild it.

443
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:35,824
The bad news, never finished it.

444
00:42:35,926 --> 00:42:39,987
So, right now, all it is,
is a room with a bathroom.

445
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:44,396
You can't stay here, Jerry.

446
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:49,332
You're nuts.

447
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:50,565
Why?

448
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:54,338
Because it's free.

449
00:42:57,147 --> 00:42:58,876
I don't need your charity, Audrey.

450
00:42:58,982 --> 00:43:03,112
Who's offering you charity?
I'm the one that needs the help here.

451
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:07,787
Really, you know
how high my mortgage is?

452
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:10,051
You can move in, get yourself situated,

453
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,891
and, eventually, you can get a job
and you can pay me rent.

454
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:29,907
So how come
Brian never mentioned you?

455
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:34,715
'Cause I'm a recovering heroin addict,
maybe?

456
00:43:46,697 --> 00:43:48,324
I hate my wife.

457
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:52,798
I mean, since we're sharing.

458
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:56,432
I hate everything about her.

459
00:43:57,374 --> 00:44:01,310
And she is gonna be furious when
she finds out I gave this shit to you.

460
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:02,571
Okay.

461
00:44:20,363 --> 00:44:21,591
-Hey, Dory.
-Hi.

462
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:24,496
You gonna give us a hand? Okay, cool.

463
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:32,272
Hey, Dory.

464
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:38,712
You got it?

465
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:44,649
-There we go.
-Good job, good job. Good job.

466
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:55,698
Yeah? Come in.

467
00:44:59,603 --> 00:45:01,298
It's dinnertime.

468
00:45:03,507 --> 00:45:04,997
-Dinnertime?
-Yeah.

469
00:45:05,108 --> 00:45:07,076
My mom wanted me to come over
and get you.

470
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:08,199
Okay.

471
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:13,481
I need to put on my soles.

472
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:18,816
I got two soles, one and two.

473
00:45:20,257 --> 00:45:22,054
Okay, let's do it.

474
00:45:29,065 --> 00:45:30,657
-Come on, that would be so cool!
-Yeah.

475
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:33,065
-Yeah, that is so funny.
-Yeah.

476
00:45:33,203 --> 00:45:34,363
-Hey, Jerry.
-How you doing?

477
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:37,099
Come on in. Have a seat.

478
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,539
Girls? Girls, this is Jerry.

479
00:45:40,644 --> 00:45:42,737
-Jerry, this is Emily.
-Hi, Emily.

480
00:45:42,879 --> 00:45:44,904
-And this is Sarah.
-Hi, Sarah.

481
00:45:45,048 --> 00:45:48,882
And Jerry is a really good friend
of our family

482
00:45:48,985 --> 00:45:51,078
who's gonna have dinner
with us tonight, okay?

483
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:52,210
So, who wants chicken?

484
00:45:52,322 --> 00:45:53,550
-Oh, me!
-Yeah?

485
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:56,558
-Chicken. Jerry?
-No, I'm a vegetarian.

486
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,355
You are? So am I.

487
00:45:58,461 --> 00:45:59,758
-Meat is murder.
-I want chicken.

488
00:45:59,896 --> 00:46:02,888
I'm gonna give it to you right now,
darling. There you go, one for you.

489
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:05,092
So, I've been to California. Have you?

490
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:08,727
Really? I haven't been to California,
but I hear it's really, really cool.

491
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:11,205
-Yeah.
-I've always wanted to go there.

492
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:12,570
It's really hot in the summer.

493
00:46:12,676 --> 00:46:17,807
Like, I was there in short-sleeve shirts
and shorts all the time. It was so hot.

494
00:46:17,948 --> 00:46:19,813
<i>-That is so cool.
-And it was so... Yeah.</i>

495
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:19,668
Hey.

496
00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:23,043
Hey, Jerry!

497
00:47:25,015 --> 00:47:26,141
Yeah?

498
00:47:26,549 --> 00:47:28,210
I used to run with Brian every...

499
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:31,218
I used to run with Brian every morning.

500
00:47:33,556 --> 00:47:36,354
So you want to go for a run?

501
00:47:40,096 --> 00:47:43,156
I mean, I'm smoking, Howard.

502
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:47,468
I'll wait.

503
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,165
Howard, I haven't ran
since junior high school.

504
00:47:51,274 --> 00:47:52,969
We'll just, you know,
go for however long.

505
00:47:53,076 --> 00:47:55,340
You know,
down to the driveway, whatever.

506
00:47:55,445 --> 00:47:57,640
We'll just go, you know?

507
00:47:57,781 --> 00:48:01,080
-I don't know if I can do it.
-We'll just go slow.

508
00:48:05,255 --> 00:48:09,089
That's it. That's it. Can't do it.

509
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:10,419
Okay.

510
00:48:25,475 --> 00:48:27,238
This was our route.

511
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,108
Thought about changing it afterward,

512
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:38,179
but this is our route.

513
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:48,219
Audrey, I don't think
she's facing reality, man.

514
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:53,425
Is she gonna have to get a job?

515
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,128
Who told you that?

516
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:59,230
No. Brian was a great developer.

517
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:02,106
He really thought outside the box,
you know? Great at rehabbing space.

518
00:49:02,245 --> 00:49:05,578
Found opportunities
where nobody else could. Was just...

519
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:08,082
Their house? Paid off long ago.

520
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:12,485
No, Audrey'll never have to worry
about money.

521
00:49:19,129 --> 00:49:21,256
-Morning.
-Hey.

522
00:49:21,364 --> 00:49:23,958
-Can I have some water?
-Yeah.

523
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:26,591
Thank you.

524
00:49:40,116 --> 00:49:41,276
So...

525
00:49:52,195 --> 00:49:53,685
Why am I here?

526
00:50:07,677 --> 00:50:09,474
I don't really know.

527
00:50:20,557 --> 00:50:23,287
You know, it should've been you, Jerry.

528
00:50:29,232 --> 00:50:30,961
Why wasn't it you?

529
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:02,588
-Sonics suck.
-You suck.

530
00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:04,723
It's a rebuilding year.

531
00:51:06,136 --> 00:51:07,603
What?

532
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:09,261
"Rebuilding year?"

533
00:51:09,405 --> 00:51:11,100
-You're nine.
-Ten.

534
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:12,674
And I'd take you down
on the court anytime.

535
00:51:12,775 --> 00:51:14,834
Oh, yeah? Go ahead.

536
00:51:18,615 --> 00:51:22,210
One more time, one more time,
one more time. Shoot it. Shoot it.

537
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:26,052
Check.

538
00:51:27,557 --> 00:51:29,115
Come on, check.

539
00:51:30,093 --> 00:51:33,187
Do you ever feel
like you're inside of a movie?

540
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:36,258
Do I ever feel like I'm inside a movie?

541
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:37,758
No.

542
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:41,597
It's a sad movie.

543
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:49,977
You know, it'll change, Harp.

544
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,981
I promise.

545
00:51:58,354 --> 00:52:00,652
Promise. Give me a high-five.

546
00:52:03,026 --> 00:52:04,152
Okay.

547
00:52:05,094 --> 00:52:06,755
The hook, the hook!
You gotta do the hook.

548
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:09,127
Do the hook. Do the hook.

549
00:52:52,742 --> 00:52:54,710
And I'm...

550
00:52:56,312 --> 00:53:00,772
I'm wondering if maybe you might
be able to help me do something.

551
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:03,111
Sure.

552
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:06,718
Sleep.

553
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:10,492
-I need to sleep.
-Sure.

554
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,406
Okay, leave your shoes out here.

555
00:53:31,114 --> 00:53:33,514
And shut the door.

556
00:53:39,555 --> 00:53:40,681
Okay.

557
00:53:41,357 --> 00:53:42,585
Come on.

558
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:46,493
-Okay.
-I need to sleep.

559
00:53:49,565 --> 00:53:52,898
-I don't know about this.
-No, trust me.

560
00:53:53,036 --> 00:53:55,698
This used to work better than Ambien.

561
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,600
Okay.

562
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:05,203
Bring this knee up, like that. Higher.
Yeah, that's it.

563
00:54:08,618 --> 00:54:10,381
Turn off the light.

564
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:18,518
Okay, now... Now take your hand

565
00:54:21,497 --> 00:54:24,364
and pull down on the earlobe.

566
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:29,130
Just pull down. Yeah, just like that.

567
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,140
Yeah, but do it faster. Harder.

568
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:37,603
Yeah.

569
00:54:37,747 --> 00:54:39,715
-Like that?
-That's it.

570
00:54:41,117 --> 00:54:42,948
Just keep doing that.

571
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,792
I'm still awake. You gotta keep going.

572
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:02,399
-Keep going, keep going.
-Okay, okay, okay.

573
00:55:02,505 --> 00:55:03,904
Keep going.

574
00:56:00,696 --> 00:56:04,029
Just for today,
my thoughts will be on my recovery.

575
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:07,568
Living and enjoying life
without the use of drugs.

576
00:56:07,703 --> 00:56:11,002
Just for today,
I will have faith in someone in N.A.

577
00:56:11,107 --> 00:56:14,702
Who believes in me
and wants to help me in my recovery.

578
00:56:14,844 --> 00:56:16,539
Just for today, through N.A.,

579
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:19,910
I will try to get
a better perspective on my life.

580
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:22,244
Just for today, I will be unafraid.

581
00:56:22,385 --> 00:56:25,218
My thoughts will be
on my new associations,

582
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:27,083
people who are not using

583
00:56:27,223 --> 00:56:29,350
and who have found a new way of life.

584
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:33,088
So long as I follow that way,
I have nothing to fear.

585
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:37,561
Is there anyone else
that'd like to share?

586
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:40,201
-Okay.
-Yeah?

587
00:56:41,737 --> 00:56:43,932
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.

588
00:56:44,073 --> 00:56:45,438
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi, Jerry.

589
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:47,770
I've been clean for 21 days.

590
00:56:48,945 --> 00:56:52,039
I'm here because my friend died.

591
00:56:52,148 --> 00:56:53,843
He wasn't a user.

592
00:56:54,951 --> 00:56:56,680
I knew him since second grade,

593
00:56:56,786 --> 00:57:00,586
and he was the only person
who never, ever gave up on me.

594
00:57:00,723 --> 00:57:04,250
He died a hero in this fucked-up,
tragic way.

595
00:57:07,497 --> 00:57:09,021
It killed me.

596
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,957
It really did.

597
00:57:21,644 --> 00:57:23,544
-Jerry?
-Yeah?

598
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:25,113
-Hey.
-Kelly.

599
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,744
I liked your share tonight.

600
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:31,979
Good. I like compliments. Thank you.

601
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:34,988
-So 21 days, huh?
-Yeah.

602
00:57:35,124 --> 00:57:38,218
-Bouncing off the bottom.
-That's right, yeah.

603
00:57:41,464 --> 00:57:44,627
You should stay till the Serenity Prayer.

604
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:46,064
-Excuse me?
-Well, last week you left

605
00:57:46,168 --> 00:57:49,899
before the Serenity Prayer,
and it's disrespectful to leave before it.

606
00:57:50,006 --> 00:57:51,837
Disrespectful to who?

607
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:55,103
To your recovery.

608
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:59,404
Well, my recovery thanks you.

609
00:58:06,122 --> 00:58:08,784
-Are you married?
-No.

610
00:58:11,494 --> 00:58:13,621
Do you have children?

611
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:15,754
Do I have children? Two.

612
00:58:16,165 --> 00:58:19,293
A six-year-old son
and a 10-year-old daughter.

613
00:58:21,637 --> 00:58:25,801
Well, I should probably go,

614
00:58:25,908 --> 00:58:29,036
but I'll see you next week.

615
00:58:29,178 --> 00:58:30,304
Yeah.

616
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:33,145
Buckle up!

617
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,790
-Hey. Hi.
-Hi. Hey.

618
00:58:45,194 --> 00:58:48,220
You hungry? You want me
to make you a sandwich or...

619
00:58:48,364 --> 00:58:52,164
No, no, I'm fine.
You think I could use the computer?

620
00:58:53,536 --> 00:58:55,299
Yeah. Sure.

621
00:58:55,404 --> 00:58:58,202
Howard wants me
to look into something.

622
00:58:58,341 --> 00:59:00,707
Okay. Come on, I'll show you.

623
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:06,003
It's in there.

624
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:05,034
I know I should...
I think I need to clean it out or...

625
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,614
Those shoes are looking good!

626
01:01:01,227 --> 01:01:04,287
So, how does a lawyer
become a heroin addict?

627
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:09,626
-Really?
-Yeah.

628
01:01:09,736 --> 01:01:13,968
Well, you start by doing coke, and then
you move on to a little crystal meth,

629
01:01:14,073 --> 01:01:18,032
you get paranoid, then you find heroin,
and after that...

630
01:01:20,847 --> 01:01:23,213
But you were a good lawyer, right?

631
01:01:26,586 --> 01:01:28,554
Who cares? Look at me.

632
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:33,453
Come work for me.

633
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:37,828
I don't know the first thing
about the mortgage business, Howard.

634
01:01:37,931 --> 01:01:40,399
You know what a house is, right?

635
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:43,502
That's a good interview. You got the job.

636
01:01:49,676 --> 01:01:51,075
Here you go.

637
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:53,476
Thank you.

638
01:01:55,014 --> 01:01:58,381
-And here's the living room.
-Yeah.

639
01:01:58,518 --> 01:02:02,648
As you can see, Doris gets her
decorating tips from Uday Hussein.

640
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,659
She's gonna get all this, you know,
the house and everything.

641
01:02:06,759 --> 01:02:09,227
-So you're gonna go for it?
-Yeah.

642
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,995
But I'm not good at facing my fears.

643
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:17,995
I'm not strong like you.

644
01:02:19,706 --> 01:02:21,230
Strong like me?

645
01:02:24,777 --> 01:02:27,678
Look, you're gonna have
to take this test,

646
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,611
the Washington State
mortgage brokers' exam,

647
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:32,912
but don't freak out.
I'll coach you through it.

648
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:39,786
-You sure?
-Yeah.

649
01:02:41,728 --> 01:02:42,854
Good.

650
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:15,014
Hey. I brought your laundry.

651
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:18,618
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

652
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,857
You look good.

653
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:26,796
I mean, a lot better than you did
when you got here.

654
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,058
Thank you. Thirty-nine days.

655
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:41,146
What's heroin like?

656
01:04:45,852 --> 01:04:49,413
You ever heard that expression,
"Being kissed by God"?

657
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,021
Well, that's just at first.

658
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:28,425
All you do is you chase it.

659
01:05:29,562 --> 01:05:33,089
You chase that initial feeling
when you can never get it back.

660
01:05:33,232 --> 01:05:36,531
You can get the escape
when you do get high,

661
01:05:36,636 --> 01:05:39,264
but never like the first few times.

662
01:05:40,807 --> 01:05:42,604
I wanna escape.

663
01:05:44,977 --> 01:05:46,137
Yeah.

664
01:05:47,313 --> 01:05:51,374
I wanna know
what it feels like to escape.

665
01:05:51,484 --> 01:05:53,247
No, you wouldn't.

666
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:55,476
Yes, I would.

667
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:02,450
And I would chase that feeling all day.

668
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,326
I would chase it
until I couldn't chase it anymore.

669
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,831
-No, you wouldn't.
-Yes, I would chase it.

670
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:10,333
No, you wouldn't.

671
01:06:11,938 --> 01:06:13,769
You're too strong.

672
01:06:15,374 --> 01:06:16,773
Too engaged.

673
01:06:44,203 --> 01:06:45,534
I'm sorry.

674
01:06:51,978 --> 01:06:53,673
Sorry about that.

675
01:06:56,415 --> 01:06:57,541
Yeah.

676
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:03,987
I'm sorry.

677
01:07:15,501 --> 01:07:16,627
Oh, you...

678
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:22,469
Let's play, sucker!

679
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:24,805
Don't let my head get wet.

680
01:07:24,911 --> 01:07:28,347
-You don't let your head under water?
-No.

681
01:07:28,447 --> 01:07:30,915
Can you put your chin under water?

682
01:07:31,784 --> 01:07:33,081
Show me.

683
01:07:37,757 --> 01:07:39,588
How about this ear?

684
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:44,921
-And the other ear?
-Yeah.

685
01:07:46,032 --> 01:07:48,091
And the top of your head?

686
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:53,937
There, you just put your head
under water.

687
01:07:55,441 --> 01:07:59,434
Your chin, the top of your head,
both of your ears.

688
01:08:00,213 --> 01:08:02,943
That's everything, man.
How do you feel?

689
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:05,846
I don't know.

690
01:08:05,952 --> 01:08:09,046
Well, why don't you put it under
and tell me?

691
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:11,248
You've already done it.

692
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:13,950
It's easy to do something
you've already done, man.

693
01:08:14,093 --> 01:08:16,721
-Wanna do it fast?
-Yeah.

694
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:18,456
On three?

695
01:08:18,598 --> 01:08:22,967
One, two, three!

696
01:08:41,153 --> 01:08:42,984
-Hi.
-Hi.

697
01:08:43,122 --> 01:08:44,612
Everything okay?

698
01:08:44,757 --> 01:08:47,089
-Yeah. Can I...
-Yeah, come in. Yeah.

699
01:08:53,432 --> 01:08:54,763
Sit down.

700
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:01,997
Sit down. Yeah.

701
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:08,747
What you did today broke my heart.

702
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,008
What'd I do?

703
01:09:13,152 --> 01:09:16,178
You got Dory
to put his head under the water.

704
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:21,585
-Just a cute trick, you know.
-He's six.

705
01:09:21,694 --> 01:09:24,492
Harper put hers under
when she was only three.

706
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:27,622
It was something
that Brian tried and tried

707
01:09:27,733 --> 01:09:30,133
to get Dory to do, but he couldn't.

708
01:09:30,236 --> 01:09:34,605
And that victory today
of getting Dory's head to go under

709
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:37,175
was not supposed to be yours.

710
01:09:39,011 --> 01:09:41,878
It wasn't meant for you
to have that moment.

711
01:09:42,014 --> 01:09:46,212
And for me, watching you was like this...

712
01:09:48,654 --> 01:09:49,643
This...

713
01:09:51,357 --> 01:09:52,722
I'm sorry.

714
01:10:22,355 --> 01:10:24,380
Harper's missing.

715
01:10:24,523 --> 01:10:25,888
The principal just called.

716
01:10:26,025 --> 01:10:29,483
She's not in school now
and she wasn't there yesterday, either.

717
01:10:29,595 --> 01:10:33,656
She's been missing school for two days,
but she was here last night.

718
01:10:33,766 --> 01:10:36,701
I'm freaking out, Jerry.
She's not answering her cell phone.

719
01:10:36,802 --> 01:10:39,236
I saw her get on the school bus
this morning, okay?

720
01:10:39,372 --> 01:10:43,866
Well, you stay here in case she comes
back because I'm going to the school.

721
01:10:43,976 --> 01:10:45,841
<i>...life without you.</i>

722
01:10:48,214 --> 01:10:49,943
<i>And you know I'm not afraid to die.</i>

723
01:10:50,549 --> 01:10:52,278
<i>That's between you
and yourself, Norma.</i>

724
01:10:52,418 --> 01:10:55,012
<i>You think I made that up
about the gun, don't you?</i>

725
01:10:56,322 --> 01:10:57,619
Harper!

726
01:11:01,961 --> 01:11:05,226
Call your mommy right now
and tell her you're fine.

727
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:10,365
Yeah, it's almost over.

728
01:11:11,237 --> 01:11:14,866
Call her right now!
Right now, young girl!

729
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:24,715
How'd you know where to find me?

730
01:11:27,586 --> 01:11:29,247
Your dad told me.

731
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:47,269
You know,

732
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:51,938
you could marry my mom
and then she'd be happy again,

733
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:54,274
and we could be a family.

734
01:11:55,881 --> 01:11:57,746
That could never happen, Harp.

735
01:11:57,850 --> 01:11:59,317
Why not?

736
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:04,014
Because that would make it so
my best friend never existed.

737
01:12:04,156 --> 01:12:05,316
But...

738
01:12:06,725 --> 01:12:08,192
He did exist.

739
01:12:11,897 --> 01:12:13,330
I guess that's why.

740
01:12:13,466 --> 01:12:17,869
And it doesn't matter because I could
never fill his shoes, you know?

741
01:12:22,308 --> 01:12:24,538
You know what?
I passed the test, though.

742
01:12:24,677 --> 01:12:26,167
-Really?
-Yep.

743
01:12:26,312 --> 01:12:28,371
-Good job.
-Thank you.

744
01:12:33,052 --> 01:12:34,952
Well, go ahead and tell her.

745
01:12:35,054 --> 01:12:36,521
You tell her.

746
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:40,125
Well, there is a week every year

747
01:12:41,193 --> 01:12:44,890
that the Park Theater plays a different
black-and-white movie every day,

748
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:48,966
and Brian used to take off work
and pull Harper out of school,

749
01:12:49,068 --> 01:12:50,365
and they'd both play hooky together

750
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:52,903
and see one of these
black-and-white movies,

751
01:12:53,038 --> 01:12:56,405
so that's where
I found baby Hitchcock over here.

752
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,020
How'd you know about the movies?

753
01:13:11,123 --> 01:13:12,715
Brian told me.

754
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,887
So how the fuck did you know about it
and I didn't?

755
01:13:19,798 --> 01:13:21,231
I don't know.

756
01:13:23,536 --> 01:13:27,529
Maybe he knew if you did,
you wouldn't let him do it again.

757
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,503
Just don't take it out on her, okay?

758
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:35,743
It's not her fault.

759
01:13:45,124 --> 01:13:46,557
What's wrong?

760
01:13:47,426 --> 01:13:49,519
This isn't working, Jerry.

761
01:13:50,796 --> 01:13:53,264
Those are my kids,

762
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:56,300
and I don't need you or anybody else
telling me how to raise them.

763
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:58,096
I know that.

764
01:13:58,237 --> 01:14:01,297
You need to get your stuff
and you need to go.

765
01:14:03,175 --> 01:14:04,301
Go.

766
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:09,145
Audrey.

767
01:14:11,784 --> 01:14:13,046
Audrey.

768
01:14:14,453 --> 01:14:15,647
Audrey.

769
01:14:17,456 --> 01:14:18,480
Audrey.

770
01:14:18,624 --> 01:14:20,751
Audrey, Audrey, stop.

771
01:14:24,697 --> 01:14:26,255
This is unfair.

772
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:29,163
Not to me, to Harper and Dory.

773
01:14:31,804 --> 01:14:34,671
Yeah, you're being selfish.

774
01:14:36,108 --> 01:14:37,405
Fuck you!

775
01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:45,683
-Thank you, Michael.
-Thank you, Michael.

776
01:14:45,818 --> 01:14:47,752
Anyone else? Okay, who's next?

777
01:14:48,954 --> 01:14:50,012
Kelly.

778
01:14:50,155 --> 01:14:52,282
Hi, my name's Kelly and I'm an addict.

779
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:54,120
-Hi, Kelly.
-Hi, Kelly.

780
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:57,161
So I'm really mad today and frustrated

781
01:14:57,296 --> 01:15:00,322
because there's this woman
at the convalescent home I work at,

782
01:15:00,466 --> 01:15:03,765
her name's Catherine.
She's 96 years old.

783
01:15:03,869 --> 01:15:07,805
She's always been this really upbeat,
high-energy, optimistic...

784
01:15:07,906 --> 01:15:12,104
Big smile all the time, and she was
recently diagnosed with cancer.

785
01:15:12,211 --> 01:15:15,476
But it's the kind that spreads slowly,
you know, it takes about 20 years.

786
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:18,209
And I didn't want them to tell her.
You know, what's the point, right?

787
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:22,878
She's gonna die of old age.
She's not gonna die of cancer.

788
01:15:23,022 --> 01:15:24,148
They fucking told her!

789
01:15:24,256 --> 01:15:27,225
And now she knows,
she's in her bed all day,

790
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,793
she sleeps, she cries. It's...

791
01:15:30,663 --> 01:15:33,799
I just...
I don't think that they should've told her.

792
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,731
I'll be back.

793
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:38,803
-Thanks, Kelly.
-Thanks, Kelly.

794
01:15:38,904 --> 01:15:42,567
Now, for those who wish,
please let's join in the Serenity Prayer.

795
01:15:53,519 --> 01:15:59,480
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

796
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:03,083
the courage to change the things I can,

797
01:16:03,228 --> 01:16:05,526
and the wisdom to know the difference.

798
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:38,628
Are you gonna sell those to buy drugs?

799
01:16:38,764 --> 01:16:40,288
Excuse me?

800
01:16:40,432 --> 01:16:42,957
Are you gonna sell it to buy drugs?

801
01:16:44,403 --> 01:16:46,132
Why aren't you in bed?

802
01:16:46,905 --> 01:16:48,634
I had a nightmare.

803
01:16:50,476 --> 01:16:52,103
Well, me, too.

804
01:16:54,146 --> 01:16:57,411
Don't steal those. Put them back.
It's bad.

805
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:01,118
Put them back.

806
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:05,389
Put them back.

807
01:17:05,491 --> 01:17:06,617
Okay.

808
01:17:06,759 --> 01:17:08,818
-It's not good.
-Okay.

809
01:17:09,995 --> 01:17:11,155
Okay.

810
01:17:36,188 --> 01:17:39,521
So what's your nightmare about?

811
01:17:44,163 --> 01:17:45,528
I woke up,

812
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:48,825
went into my mom's bedroom.

813
01:17:49,234 --> 01:17:51,634
She wasn't there. She was gone.

814
01:17:53,071 --> 01:17:55,938
I came down here
to check where she was.

815
01:17:57,543 --> 01:17:59,101
Then I woke up.

816
01:18:06,485 --> 01:18:10,182
You know, the good thing is that it's...
It's just a dream.

817
01:18:10,756 --> 01:18:12,314
It's not real.

818
01:18:15,227 --> 01:18:18,663
She usually sits with me
until I fall back asleep.

819
01:18:25,904 --> 01:18:30,500
"I look at each game, each day,
as a new chance."

820
01:18:49,261 --> 01:18:52,856
Jerry! Let's play, sucker!

821
01:19:02,975 --> 01:19:06,411
Jerry's gone! He's moved out!

822
01:19:06,812 --> 01:19:09,610
He's gonna go do drugs again.

823
01:19:09,748 --> 01:19:13,115
He's not gonna go do drugs, honey.
Why would you think that?

824
01:19:13,252 --> 01:19:14,412
Is it because of me?

825
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:17,113
Because I skipped school
to go see those old movies?

826
01:19:17,256 --> 01:19:19,884
I promise, I promise,
I'll never do it again!

827
01:19:19,992 --> 01:19:21,789
Just let Jerry come back!

828
01:19:21,927 --> 01:19:26,455
Honey, nothing you did
made Jerry leave, okay?

829
01:19:27,499 --> 01:19:31,094
He's gonna be back, you'll see.
And he's gonna be fine.

830
01:19:31,236 --> 01:19:32,965
He's a big guy.

831
01:19:33,105 --> 01:19:36,597
Trust me on this one.
Come on, give me the ball.

832
01:19:36,742 --> 01:19:39,404
Does that mean Jerry's gonna die now?

833
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:44,310
Congratulations on two years
of being clean.

834
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,314
Thank you.

835
01:19:52,357 --> 01:19:54,416
My name is Frances and I'm an addict.

836
01:19:54,526 --> 01:19:55,993
Hi, Frances.

837
01:19:57,162 --> 01:20:00,256
Coming here for two years now

838
01:20:00,365 --> 01:20:03,334
has made me believe
that this is possible.

839
01:20:06,872 --> 01:20:11,138
My mother gave me this bear
when I was five years old,

840
01:20:11,276 --> 01:20:14,643
and I plan to pass this bear
on to my daughter when she's five.

841
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,941
You're gonna make it, girl.

842
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:18,448
<i>Thank you.</i>

843
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:27,449
Jerry?

844
01:20:27,559 --> 01:20:28,821
<i>Who is this?</i>

845
01:20:30,696 --> 01:20:32,163
Who's this?

846
01:20:32,297 --> 01:20:33,958
My name's Kelly.

847
01:20:36,501 --> 01:20:38,526
Is this where Jerry lives?

848
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:40,262
<i>-Yeah.
-Is he there?</i>

849
01:20:40,372 --> 01:20:42,806
'Cause he wasn't at the N.A. Meeting.

850
01:20:42,908 --> 01:20:43,966
<i>It was Fran's birthday,</i>

851
01:20:44,076 --> 01:20:46,340
and this wasn't a meeting
that he would've missed.

852
01:20:46,478 --> 01:20:48,309
<i>What does that mean?</i>

853
01:20:50,148 --> 01:20:51,809
<i>He's relapsed.</i>

854
01:20:56,254 --> 01:20:59,985
<i>Do you have any idea
where he might be?</i>

855
01:21:00,092 --> 01:21:02,219
<i>You don't wanna go there.</i>

856
01:21:39,698 --> 01:21:41,222
Hey, baby!

857
01:22:01,486 --> 01:22:02,612
Jerry?

858
01:22:06,758 --> 01:22:07,884
Jerry?

859
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:12,522
Jerry! Jerry! It's Audrey.

860
01:22:13,765 --> 01:22:17,201
-Hi, Audrey.
-It's Audrey. Get up.

861
01:22:17,302 --> 01:22:22,763
I'm taking you home.
Come on! Get up! Get up!

862
01:22:27,746 --> 01:22:28,974
Come on.

863
01:22:31,349 --> 01:22:32,611
Come on.

864
01:22:42,828 --> 01:22:44,625
You see what's left?

865
01:22:46,932 --> 01:22:48,456
Shut up, Jerry.

866
01:22:51,503 --> 01:22:52,970
What can I get for you, Jerry,

867
01:22:53,105 --> 01:22:56,438
right now,
that's gonna help you feel better?

868
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:57,906
Chocolate.

869
01:22:58,510 --> 01:22:59,841
Chocolate.

870
01:23:02,314 --> 01:23:04,976
Come on. Jerry.

871
01:23:05,117 --> 01:23:07,813
It's fucked up. It's fucked up.

872
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:12,754
-It's fucked up.
-Sit down, Jerry. Sit down. Yeah.

873
01:23:12,858 --> 01:23:14,155
Jerry?

874
01:23:14,292 --> 01:23:15,850
What else do you need?

875
01:23:15,994 --> 01:23:19,862
You know what?
I would like some ice cream, please.

876
01:23:19,998 --> 01:23:22,466
Okay, I'll get you some ice cream,

877
01:23:22,567 --> 01:23:26,128
but for right now, Neal is gonna
stay here with you, okay?

878
01:23:27,472 --> 01:23:28,461
Okay?

879
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,814
-Hi, Neal.
-Hey, Jerry.

880
01:23:38,316 --> 01:23:41,419
Looks like we're gonna be roommates
for a while, all right?

881
01:23:41,419 --> 01:23:42,113
Looks like we're gonna be roommates
for a while, all right?

882
01:23:42,988 --> 01:23:46,480
Fine with me, but don't...

883
01:23:50,996 --> 01:23:52,361
Hey, Jerry?

884
01:23:56,535 --> 01:24:01,905
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

885
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,530
Too much sleep.

886
01:24:05,443 --> 01:24:08,207
Well, we're gonna get you cleaned up.

887
01:24:09,414 --> 01:24:10,904
Get you out of those clothes.

888
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:15,076
I hate it, man. I hate it.

889
01:24:16,955 --> 01:24:19,822
Oopsie-daisy.
Okay, you got any more drugs on you?

890
01:24:19,925 --> 01:24:21,916
I don't. Oh, no.

891
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,550
Any needles?

892
01:24:26,264 --> 01:24:28,357
Okay, get that off.

893
01:24:31,403 --> 01:24:32,927
We're gonna put that...

894
01:24:33,205 --> 01:24:34,832
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

895
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,238
Hey, you just got here.
Go ahead, sit down.

896
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:07,896
Who's with him?

897
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:11,809
My brother.
Thanks for telling me about him.

898
01:25:15,614 --> 01:25:17,878
Are you his girlfriend?

899
01:25:17,983 --> 01:25:19,883
No. No.

900
01:25:21,586 --> 01:25:22,575
He

901
01:25:24,489 --> 01:25:26,957
was my husband's best friend.

902
01:25:29,294 --> 01:25:31,592
The one who was shot?

903
01:25:40,872 --> 01:25:43,170
Was he the love of your life?

904
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:51,915
I lost the love of my life, too.

905
01:25:54,352 --> 01:25:55,944
To an overdose.

906
01:25:57,455 --> 01:25:59,753
But it's what got me clean.

907
01:25:59,858 --> 01:26:02,759
You know, they say
that every time a user dies,

908
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:04,795
there's one
that gets clean because of it.

909
01:26:06,298 --> 01:26:08,095
How long ago?

910
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:10,599
2,653 days.

911
01:26:14,406 --> 01:26:16,704
Does it get better?

912
01:26:16,841 --> 01:26:18,775
It gets different.

913
01:26:18,877 --> 01:26:20,640
I have a new life,

914
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,309
so now I can have a new love of my life.

915
01:26:29,087 --> 01:26:32,523
Well, I don't know anything
about addiction, Kelly,

916
01:26:32,657 --> 01:26:34,887
so would you like to help me?

917
01:26:36,928 --> 01:26:40,295
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Okay!

918
01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:43,065
Hey, hey, hey.

919
01:26:43,201 --> 01:26:45,328
Come on, come on, come on.

920
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:51,571
Come on. Come on, come on.

921
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,905
Come on. Come on. Come on.

922
01:26:54,045 --> 01:26:55,478
You gotta breathe.
You gotta breathe, baby.

923
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,811
It's me, it's me. It's okay.
You gotta breathe.

924
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:30,839
I got you.

925
01:27:32,217 --> 01:27:33,616
It's okay.

926
01:27:35,253 --> 01:27:37,687
Okay, okay. Nice and easy.

927
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:39,552
I feel like shit.

928
01:27:41,426 --> 01:27:43,917
So the antacid you can give him now.

929
01:27:44,062 --> 01:27:47,725
The tea is to help him
keep down solids,

930
01:27:47,832 --> 01:27:51,199
and you want to give him
the antihistamine really only at night.

931
01:27:51,302 --> 01:27:54,396
-Okay. No, no, no, that's for Jerry.
-Nice.

932
01:27:54,506 --> 01:27:56,906
Do you want a little taste? Huh?

933
01:27:57,776 --> 01:27:59,539
When can I see him?

934
01:28:03,148 --> 01:28:06,379
Very soon, honey. Promise.

935
01:28:13,691 --> 01:28:15,215
All right. Come on, right here, man.

936
01:28:15,326 --> 01:28:17,988
Take this. Take this.
It's gonna help you out.

937
01:28:19,631 --> 01:28:22,725
All right, get it down, get it down.

938
01:28:22,834 --> 01:28:25,064
A little water. All right.

939
01:28:34,212 --> 01:28:35,577
I'm cold!

940
01:29:28,766 --> 01:29:31,132
Are you gonna die like my dad?

941
01:29:31,936 --> 01:29:33,130
Yeah.

942
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:36,864
When?

943
01:29:37,008 --> 01:29:39,670
As soon as possible, I hope.

944
01:29:40,912 --> 01:29:42,903
You're kidding, right?

945
01:29:51,923 --> 01:29:54,585
I brought you some cookies and water.

946
01:29:55,527 --> 01:29:58,496
C-3PO and R2-D2.

947
01:29:58,596 --> 01:29:59,722
Yeah.

948
01:30:01,065 --> 01:30:04,034
3PO was a little stuck-up.

949
01:30:04,135 --> 01:30:05,227
Yeah.

950
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:07,429
I like R2-D2 better.

951
01:30:09,574 --> 01:30:10,563
Excuse me.

952
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,074
He seemed more accessible.

953
01:30:17,415 --> 01:30:18,677
Here.

954
01:30:38,303 --> 01:30:39,361
Here! Get back.

955
01:30:39,470 --> 01:30:40,596
Hey, Jerry.

956
01:30:42,307 --> 01:30:44,434
-Hi, Audrey.
-Ready, Emily?

957
01:30:44,576 --> 01:30:45,702
Come on in.

958
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:48,142
I'm just... I'm smoking.

959
01:30:48,279 --> 01:30:51,146
Well, it's okay, you can smoke inside.

960
01:30:51,282 --> 01:30:52,476
Okay.

961
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:55,617
So he does not pay, right?

962
01:30:56,588 --> 01:30:58,579
So, essentially, we are...

963
01:31:05,196 --> 01:31:06,754
-Hi, Diane.
-Hi!

964
01:31:06,864 --> 01:31:07,990
Hi.

965
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:12,799
-How you doing?
-Feeling better.

966
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:16,839
Good. You look better.

967
01:31:16,975 --> 01:31:18,272
Thanks.

968
01:31:22,547 --> 01:31:23,980
He's so wrong.

969
01:31:25,717 --> 01:31:26,911
What?

970
01:31:28,219 --> 01:31:31,780
"R2-D2 is more accessible?"

971
01:31:38,563 --> 01:31:41,157
So it wasn't a hallucination, huh?

972
01:31:41,299 --> 01:31:43,631
No. That was my son.

973
01:31:47,572 --> 01:31:50,837
He was so cute.
Brought me a cookie and water.

974
01:31:56,014 --> 01:31:57,777
Hold on, excuse me.

975
01:31:59,217 --> 01:32:01,378
Dory! What did your mother say?

976
01:32:01,519 --> 01:32:03,885
What did your mother say?
What did your mother say?

977
01:32:08,259 --> 01:32:10,659
You wanna sit and have some dinner?

978
01:32:10,762 --> 01:32:14,493
I think you should eat, you know?
Maybe you can keep it down.

979
01:32:14,599 --> 01:32:15,896
I'll try.

980
01:32:29,414 --> 01:32:31,143
See how he's spinning around like that?

981
01:32:31,249 --> 01:32:32,477
Brian used to do the same thing.

982
01:32:32,583 --> 01:32:35,074
Basketball games,
soccer games, any game.

983
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:36,413
I know.

984
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:43,824
I miss the silliness,

985
01:32:47,432 --> 01:32:48,763
the fun.

986
01:32:56,441 --> 01:33:01,174
I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel
happy again.

987
01:33:07,318 --> 01:33:10,219
Am I ever gonna feel beautiful?

988
01:33:10,321 --> 01:33:12,118
You are beautiful.

989
01:33:15,126 --> 01:33:17,253
No, I mean on the inside.

990
01:33:20,064 --> 01:33:23,261
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

991
01:33:34,345 --> 01:33:35,903
-Hey.
-Hey.

992
01:33:36,814 --> 01:33:38,611
What are you doing here?

993
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:40,377
I invited her.

994
01:33:50,828 --> 01:33:51,954
-Howard?
-Yeah?

995
01:33:52,096 --> 01:33:54,087
Can we swim in the pool tomorrow?

996
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:59,792
I'm sorry, Dory,
but I don't live there anymore.

997
01:33:59,937 --> 01:34:00,961
Why?

998
01:34:01,105 --> 01:34:06,236
Well, because my soon to be ex-wife is
gonna get the house.

999
01:34:07,545 --> 01:34:10,810
Honey, we'll find another place to swim.
Okay?

1000
01:34:10,948 --> 01:34:12,438
What kind of music
did your husband like?

1001
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,814
Did he like classical music?

1002
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:20,416
Yeah.

1003
01:34:21,559 --> 01:34:23,925
What did he drink after dinner?

1004
01:34:25,396 --> 01:34:28,297
Coffee? Italian wine? Or nothing?

1005
01:34:33,237 --> 01:34:37,196
Chocolate milk.
He loved chocolate milk.

1006
01:34:41,245 --> 01:34:44,043
-What kind of toothpaste did he use?
-Crest.

1007
01:34:46,818 --> 01:34:48,285
He... Crest.

1008
01:34:51,022 --> 01:34:54,014
Come on, ask me a question, Kelly.

1009
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:57,321
Okay, what was his favorite movie?

1010
01:34:58,396 --> 01:35:00,057
I can't remember.

1011
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:04,695
<i>He liked this really old boring one,
with the guy from Meet the Fockers.</i>

1012
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:07,567
<i>Godfather II.</i>

1013
01:35:07,705 --> 01:35:09,366
-It was One, actually.
-Yeah.

1014
01:35:09,507 --> 01:35:10,496
No, he liked Two.

1015
01:35:10,608 --> 01:35:11,836
My dad shot a squirrel.

1016
01:35:11,943 --> 01:35:13,672
-He did?
-Yeah.

1017
01:35:13,778 --> 01:35:16,838
He killed it. He cried a lot.

1018
01:35:18,416 --> 01:35:20,145
He was nine.

1019
01:35:20,251 --> 01:35:22,742
-We had a fire.
-You did?

1020
01:35:22,887 --> 01:35:24,912
Yeah.

1021
01:35:25,056 --> 01:35:26,580
How did it happen?

1022
01:35:26,724 --> 01:35:28,021
It was electrical.

1023
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:32,027
-The garage door opener went kaput.
-Oh, yeah.

1024
01:35:35,132 --> 01:35:38,590
-Yeah.
-My dad wasn't upset, but my mom was.

1025
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:42,399
Yeah.

1026
01:35:44,742 --> 01:35:50,578
We lost so many things, I mean,
baby clothes, our photo albums.

1027
01:35:50,715 --> 01:35:51,704
My bike.

1028
01:35:51,816 --> 01:35:56,776
Your bike, important papers,
everything, just...

1029
01:35:58,389 --> 01:36:01,119
We lost a lot. And I remember, I...

1030
01:36:04,795 --> 01:36:09,027
I went to him and I said, you know,
"How can you be so calm?"

1031
01:36:10,067 --> 01:36:13,867
And he said, "Hey, you know,
those are just things, Audrey.

1032
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:16,735
"Those are just the stuff.
That's just stuff.

1033
01:36:16,841 --> 01:36:19,036
"We still have each other."

1034
01:36:44,101 --> 01:36:45,261
Hi.

1035
01:36:48,139 --> 01:36:49,606
Are you okay?

1036
01:36:53,644 --> 01:36:55,271
This is a list

1037
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:02,017
of all the things we lost in the fire.

1038
01:37:11,028 --> 01:37:12,461
He's gone.

1039
01:37:19,303 --> 01:37:20,702
He's gone.

1040
01:38:18,429 --> 01:38:22,024
Jerry! Why? Why?

1041
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:28,932
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1042
01:38:37,114 --> 01:38:39,014
It's gonna be okay.

1043
01:39:59,396 --> 01:40:00,624
Audrey?

1044
01:40:00,731 --> 01:40:03,996
Yeah? I'm back here. In Dory's room.

1045
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,667
Harper told me you wanted to see me.

1046
01:40:07,805 --> 01:40:11,798
Hey, come on. Sit down.

1047
01:40:21,352 --> 01:40:25,118
So I spoke to Kelly.

1048
01:40:27,725 --> 01:40:28,953
And...

1049
01:40:30,694 --> 01:40:34,790
She said that this, you know...

1050
01:40:34,899 --> 01:40:40,963
This facility, or rehab place
really worked for her.

1051
01:40:43,274 --> 01:40:44,400
So...

1052
01:40:47,511 --> 01:40:53,541
Now, I was kind of thinking
that maybe you should go and...

1053
01:40:53,684 --> 01:40:58,553
Audrey, you've already done
enough for me.

1054
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:02,853
Right. Okay, but, look,
if you're gonna make this about money,

1055
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,689
then I'm gonna be pissed.

1056
01:41:04,795 --> 01:41:06,660
Now, if you wanna make it
about something else,

1057
01:41:06,764 --> 01:41:10,097
I mean, I don't know, whatever,
I'm gonna hate it,

1058
01:41:10,601 --> 01:41:14,537
but, you know, I guess I can accept that.

1059
01:41:31,155 --> 01:41:35,854
You know, Brian used to say something
to the kids all the time.

1060
01:41:37,995 --> 01:41:39,860
"Accept the good."

1061
01:41:44,902 --> 01:41:46,870
Accept the good, Jerry.

1062
01:41:57,648 --> 01:41:59,707
Do they glow in the dark?

1063
01:42:03,754 --> 01:42:06,882
Yeah. They're fluorescent.

1064
01:42:23,173 --> 01:42:24,333
Okay.

1065
01:42:27,378 --> 01:42:29,903
I'll go, but under one condition.

1066
01:42:30,014 --> 01:42:32,847
When I come out, I'm gonna get a job,

1067
01:42:32,983 --> 01:42:38,421
and I'm gonna pay you back, down
to the last penny, and you will take it.

1068
01:42:43,027 --> 01:42:44,324
Promise?

1069
01:43:00,644 --> 01:43:02,669
Hey, Harp.

1070
01:43:02,813 --> 01:43:05,145
Hi, Jerry. Wanna play?

1071
01:43:07,584 --> 01:43:10,382
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

1072
01:43:15,526 --> 01:43:16,857
Okay, here it is.

1073
01:43:18,562 --> 01:43:22,760
I'm gonna be leaving soon.
I'm gonna go to a sort of hospital.

1074
01:43:25,002 --> 01:43:28,165
-For how long?
-Well, I don't know.

1075
01:43:29,373 --> 01:43:33,867
But when I get out, I'm gonna have
my own place and you can come visit.

1076
01:43:37,314 --> 01:43:40,374
You mean
you're not staying here anymore?

1077
01:43:40,517 --> 01:43:41,677
No.

1078
01:43:44,688 --> 01:43:46,212
Why the face?

1079
01:43:47,925 --> 01:43:50,826
That's how it was always gonna be.

1080
01:43:50,928 --> 01:43:54,625
No! You can't just come here
and pretend to be my dad and leave!

1081
01:43:58,002 --> 01:44:02,200
Harper, I never pretended
to be your daddy.

1082
01:44:13,951 --> 01:44:15,248
Where's your sister?

1083
01:44:15,386 --> 01:44:18,412
She locked herself in her room.
She's mad.

1084
01:44:19,623 --> 01:44:22,490
-Why? She's mad at you?
-No. You.

1085
01:44:25,396 --> 01:44:26,727
She's mad at me, huh?

1086
01:44:26,864 --> 01:44:28,889
She doesn't wanna talk to anyone.

1087
01:44:29,033 --> 01:44:32,002
Okay, watch your hand. Scram.

1088
01:44:44,748 --> 01:44:45,772
Jerry!

1089
01:44:46,884 --> 01:44:48,613
Jerry. Man.

1090
01:44:51,055 --> 01:44:53,455
I thought I was gonna miss you.

1091
01:44:56,994 --> 01:44:59,929
-I'm proud of you, man.
-Thank you.

1092
01:45:03,667 --> 01:45:05,794
I'm going back to my wife.

1093
01:45:09,473 --> 01:45:11,941
I'm lonely as fuck in town, man.

1094
01:45:14,111 --> 01:45:15,203
Okay.

1095
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:18,743
Howard?

1096
01:45:20,918 --> 01:45:22,283
Thank you.

1097
01:45:43,807 --> 01:45:44,899
Harper?

1098
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:50,647
I want to say goodbye.
Can you take a look at this note?

1099
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,095
I love you.

1100
01:46:26,183 --> 01:46:27,343
Hey.

1101
01:46:45,068 --> 01:46:48,299
Are you gonna be my friend
when you get better?

1102
01:46:50,073 --> 01:46:52,200
I'm gonna be your friend forever.

1103
01:46:52,342 --> 01:46:54,401
Like you were with my dad?

1104
01:46:55,579 --> 01:46:56,705
You bet.

1105
01:46:58,282 --> 01:47:00,375
Now give me a real kiss.

1106
01:47:00,517 --> 01:47:01,882
Good. Okay.

1107
01:47:21,471 --> 01:47:25,066
Wait! Wait!

1108
01:47:30,047 --> 01:47:31,207
Wait!

1109
01:47:32,716 --> 01:47:34,684
Wait! Jerry!

1110
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:38,117
Hey!

1111
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:33,568
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.

1112
01:48:33,677 --> 01:48:35,770
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hello, Jerry.

1113
01:48:38,215 --> 01:48:41,946
I've been clean for 89 days.

1114
01:48:42,052 --> 01:48:43,986
My mind is clearer,

1115
01:48:48,492 --> 01:48:50,824
and I think it's getting better.

1116
01:48:50,961 --> 01:48:53,521
Every day, a little bit.

1117
01:48:53,664 --> 01:48:56,929
But I wanna talk about this dream
I keep having.

1118
01:48:59,236 --> 01:49:02,763
It always starts
with me stealing silverware.

1119
01:49:02,873 --> 01:49:06,866
<i>Then I go sell it to this guy</i>

1120
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:10,810
<i>who I used to know
who owned a catering service.</i>

1121
01:49:12,816 --> 01:49:17,617
Then with the money, I go to this place
where I used to buy my drug of choice,

1122
01:49:20,991 --> 01:49:24,051
and he's not around.

1123
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:29,498
So I go to other spots, right,

1124
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:35,663
but for some reason, no one is around.

1125
01:49:38,275 --> 01:49:40,971
<i>All of Seattle is dry,</i>

1126
01:49:41,078 --> 01:49:46,015
and then I get that feeling, the dread,

1127
01:49:50,454 --> 01:49:52,149
and I panic.

1128
01:49:56,927 --> 01:49:58,485
And I start running,

1129
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:03,825
<i>and it's raining, and it gets dark.</i>

1130
01:50:05,869 --> 01:50:10,238
<i>And then I'm in my old apartment,
and I'm thrashing right through it,</i>

1131
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:14,572
<i>looking for something
I might have stashed away.</i>

1132
01:50:18,115 --> 01:50:20,583
And I think I'm having a seizure.

1133
01:50:23,887 --> 01:50:27,721
And then I find a balloon
hidden in my suitcase.

1134
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:50,871
So there I am

1135
01:50:53,483 --> 01:50:55,917
with a bag of junk in one hand

1136
01:50:56,953 --> 01:51:00,081
and the money for my next fix
in the other,

1137
01:51:00,190 --> 01:51:03,921
and I feel at total, utter peace.

1138
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:15,260
And I wake up.

1139
01:51:19,509 --> 01:51:21,238
<i>One day at a time.</i>

1140
01:51:24,381 --> 01:51:26,110
<i>One day at a time.</i>

1141
01:51:32,122 --> 01:51:33,817
One day at a time.

1142
01:51:37,994 --> 01:51:39,757
<i>One day at a time.</i>

1143
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:48,335
Thank you.
