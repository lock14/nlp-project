00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:38,949
<i>As the 21st century began...</i>

3
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:42,434
<i>human evolution was
at a turning point.</i>

4
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:47,274
<i>Natural selection, the process by which
the strongest, the smartest...</i>

5
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:50,787
<i>the fastest reproduced
in greater numbers than the rest...</i>

6
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:54,568
<i>a process which had once
favored the noblest traits of man...</i>

7
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,969
<i>now began to favor
different traits.</i>

8
00:00:57,068 --> 00:00:58,890
<i>The Joey Buttafuoco case--</i>

9
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:02,632
<i>Most science fiction of the day
predicted a future that was more civilized...</i>

10
00:01:02,732 --> 00:01:04,739
<i>and more intelligent.</i>

11
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:08,706
<i>But as time went on, things seemed
to be heading in the opposite direction.</i>

12
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:10,699
<i>A dumbing down.</i>

13
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:12,737
<i>How did this happen?</i>

14
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:15,975
<i>Evolution does not necessarily
reward intelligence.</i>

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,497
<i>With no natural predators
to thin the herd...</i>

16
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,768
<i>it began to simply reward those
who reproduced the most...</i>

17
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:25,828
<i>and left the intelligent
to become an endangered species.</i>

18
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:31,233
Having kids is such
an important decision.

19
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,714
We're just waiting
for the right time.

20
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:35,048
It's not something you want
to rush into, obviously.

21
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:36,970
No way.

22
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,369
<i>Oh, shit,
I'm pregnant again!</i>

23
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:42,435
Shit!
I got too many damn kids!

24
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,638
- I thought you was on the pill or some shit!
- Hell, no!

25
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,627
Shit! I must've been
thinkin' of Brittany.

26
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,763
Brittany?
No, you didn't!

27
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:52,802
- There's no way we could have a child now.
- Mm-mm.

28
00:01:52,908 --> 00:01:54,795
Not with the market
the way it is, no.

29
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:57,128
God, no. That just
wouldn't make any sense.

30
00:01:57,227 --> 00:02:00,042
Come on over here, bitch!
He don't care about you!

31
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,693
Yeah? Well, there must be
somethin' he likes over here.

32
00:02:02,796 --> 00:02:05,927
- She don't mean nothin' to me, baby!
- Clevon!

33
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,962
Oh, shit.
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

34
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,232
Well, we finally decided
to have children...

35
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:16,193
and I'm not pointing fingers,
but it's not going well.

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,122
And this is helping.

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,187
I'm just saying that before I have in vitro,
maybe you should be willing to--

38
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,114
It's always me, right?

39
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:26,441
Well, it's not
my sperm count.

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,995
Yeah! Yeah!
I'm gonna fuck all y'all!

41
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:30,790
That's my boy!

42
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:33,096
Whoo! Whoo!

43
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:36,746
Clevon is lucky
to be alive.

44
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:39,080
He attempted to jump
a Jet Ski from a lake...

45
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,278
into a swimming pool
and impaled his crotch on an iron gate.

46
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,355
But thanks to recent advances
in stem cell research...

47
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,307
and the fine work of Doctors Krinski
and Altschuler...

48
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:49,509
Clevon should regain
full reproductive function.

49
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,433
Get your hands
off my junk!

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,467
Unfortunately, Trevor passed away
from a heart attack...

51
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:00,579
while masturbating...

52
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:03,651
to produce sperm
for artificial insemination.

53
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:05,577
But I have
some eggs frozen...

54
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:09,221
so just as soon as the right guy
comes along, you know--

55
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,681
<i>And so it went for generations...</i>

56
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:18,471
<i>although few, if any,
seemed to notice.</i>

57
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:24,103
<i>But in the year 2005, in a military base
just outside of Washington, D.C...</i>

58
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,979
<i>a simple army librarian
was unknowingly...</i>

59
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:31,818
<i>about to change the entire course
of human history.</i>

60
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,606
Come on, asshole!
Go on! Take him to jail!

61
00:03:37,707 --> 00:03:39,267
Hey, Bauers.

62
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,761
This is Peterson,
your new replacement.

63
00:03:41,867 --> 00:03:45,577
- My what? I'm gettin' replaced?
- Yeah, they didn't tell you?

64
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:47,683
- No.
- Some new assignment.

65
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:49,991
They're being all weird
and hush-hush about it.

66
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:52,808
I don't want a new assignment.
I tell Sergeant Metsler that every time.

67
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,520
- I'm good at this.
- Good at what? Sittin' on ass?

68
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,107
<i>No one ever comes in here.</i>

69
00:03:59,212 --> 00:04:02,310
Yeah, I know. It's perfect for me.
No one bothers me. I can't screw up.

70
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:05,347
<i>If I can just stay in here another eight years,
I get my pension.</i>

71
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:08,451
I'm all set. Can you just
get me out of this?

72
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:11,174
No way. Not this time.
It's coming from high up.

73
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:15,465
Jesus. I don't understand.
Why me?

74
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:19,044
Every time Metsler says, "Lead, follow,
or get out of the way," I get out of the way.

75
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:22,628
When he says that, you're not supposed
to choose "get out of the way."

76
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:26,626
It's supposed to embarrass you
into leading or at least following.

77
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,520
That doesn't
embarrass me.

78
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,442
Look, Joe.
You don't have a choice.

79
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,296
You're just gonna
have to follow.

80
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,762
Like, follow me upstairs,
like, now.

81
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,471
Right now?
Shouldn't I train this guy?

82
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:42,598
I think he can figure out how to sit on his ass
and watch TV all day. Let's go.

83
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:52,322
<i>Gentlemen, meet Joe Bauers...</i>

84
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:55,428
our first subject for the Human
Hibernation Experiment.

85
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,386
Now, as you know,
throughout the years...

86
00:04:57,484 --> 00:04:59,851
many of our best pilots,
soldiers and military leaders...

87
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:02,053
often go their entire careers
without ever seeing battle.

88
00:05:02,155 --> 00:05:06,695
<i>With the Human Hibernation Project,
we will be able to save our best men...</i>

89
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:09,610
frozen in their prime,
for use when they are needed most.

90
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,286
<i>Joe, here, is not
one of our best men.</i>

91
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:17,828
Mr. Bauers was chosen primarily
for how remarkably average he is.

92
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:22,405
<i>Extremely average in every
category. Remarkable, truly.</i>

93
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:25,158
The most average person
in our entire armed forces.

94
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,681
Additionally, he has no family,
is unmarried...

95
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:29,992
is an only child,
and both parents are deceased...

96
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:33,604
making him an ideal candidate,
with no one to ask any nosy questions...

97
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,683
should something go wrong
with the experiment.

98
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:40,162
<i>We had a little less luck in finding a female
researcher's dream within our ranks...</i>

99
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:44,162
and were forced to look
into the private sector.

100
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:47,584
<i>This is Rita. Like Joe,
she has no immediate family.</i>

101
00:05:47,692 --> 00:05:50,310
<i>Rita agreed to participate
in this experiment...</i>

102
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:54,306
in exchange for dropping
of certain criminal charges and a small fee.

103
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:57,957
<i>We did, however, have to come
to an arrangement with her pimp...</i>

104
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,922
<i>a gentleman who goes by the name
Upgrayedd, which he spells thusly--</i>

105
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:07,461
<i>With two D's, as he says,
for a double dose of this pimping.</i>

106
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:09,703
Upgrayedd agreed
to loan us Rita for exactly one year...

107
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>and keep quiet on the matter,
in exchange for certain leeways...</i>

108
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,198
<i>with the local authorities
in running his pimp game.</i>

109
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,293
<i>First, however, there was
the difficult challenge of gaining his trust.</i>

110
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,068
<i>Collins, could we skip
to the technicals, please?</i>

111
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,376
Sure.
Let me just finish here.

112
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:30,599
You see, a pimp's love is very different
from that of a square.

113
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,642
Collins!

114
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:36,266
Fine. We'll move on.

115
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:39,047
It is a fascinating
world though.

116
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,441
Jesus, Collins.

117
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:57,665
Yeah, that's--

118
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:01,573
Anyway, the experiment
in which these two subjects...

119
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,585
are to be placed
into a dry freeze...

120
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,928
for exactly one year
is set to begin tomorrow.

121
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,132
As you know,
this is highly classified.

122
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:13,157
<i>However, if successful, we believe humans
can be stored indefinitely.</i>

123
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,976
So this is kinda crazy, huh?

124
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:26,466
- What unit are you with?
- Oh, I ain't in the service.

125
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,321
Oh, private sector.
Okay.

126
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,730
- So, uh, what do you do?
- A little of this, a little of that.

127
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,941
Wow, that's great.

128
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:38,760
You know, I really envy people
that can make a living that way--

129
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,802
<i>doing a little of this
and a little of that.</i>

130
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:45,512
I, uh, had a neighbor, Glen.
He used to make chainsaw sculptures...

131
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:47,434
and then he'd sell 'em
at the flea market.

132
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:49,354
Yeah.

133
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:54,026
So, uh, you an artist
or somethin'?

134
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:58,058
- Uh, yeah.
- You do paintings or--

135
00:07:58,156 --> 00:08:00,523
- Yeah, paintings.
- Okay, great.

136
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,613
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you paint mostly?

137
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:10,530
I don't know, just...
people and fruit and shit.

138
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:15,589
Wow. Well, must be great to be able
to make a living doing something you love.

139
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:18,212
Yeah. It's not all it's cracked up to be.

140
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:19,909
<i>Who wants to go first?</i>

141
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:22,400
Me.

142
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:30,121
What the f-- Oh, hell, no. Uh-uh.

143
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,765
Hey, no. You probably don't want to do that
with the I.V.s attached and all.

144
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,835
- What's the matter?
- Man, Upgrayedd didn't tell me
they'd be putting me...

145
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:38,947
in no damn coffin
with tubes and shit!

146
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,921
Oh, no, don't worry about it.
It'll be safe. Trust me.

147
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:43,521
Who's Upgrayedd?

148
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:45,515
He's my boyfriend.

149
00:08:46,795 --> 00:08:48,683
Man, how do you know
this shit's safe?

150
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,602
These guys know what they're doing.
Don't worry.

151
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,350
They've tested it on dogs
and everything.

152
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,201
What happens is, the drugs will kick in,
we drift off to sleep...

153
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,209
we wake up in a year,
you'll be paintin' again.

154
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:00,225
<i>- It'll be fine.
- All right.</i>

155
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,074
Upgrayedd. That's an interesting name.
Is he Dutch?

156
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:08,552
See, 'cause I knew this,
uh, Dutch exchange student.

157
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:10,114
His name was Untgrad.

158
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,162
Okay, my niggas,
we're almost set here.

159
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:14,951
Just go ahead
and lie down. Relax.

160
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:25,575
See you in a year.

161
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:28,229
<i>The Human Hibernation Project...</i>

162
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:31,234
<i>was one of the army's most
ambitious experiments...</i>

163
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,057
<i>and one of its most secretive.</i>

164
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,490
<i>But it was not immune
from human error.</i>

165
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,034
Freeze!

166
00:09:49,324 --> 00:09:52,902
<i>Soon after Collins's arrest
and the massive scandal that followed...</i>

167
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,655
<i>the base was closed.</i>

168
00:09:55,755 --> 00:10:00,262
<i>It hadn't even been a year,
and the entire project was simply forgotten.</i>

169
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,151
<i>Things looked bleak for Joe,
but they were even worse for mankind.</i>

170
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:09,383
<i>As Joe and Rita lay dormant,
the years passed...</i>

171
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,346
<i>and mankind became stupider
at a frightening rate.</i>

172
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:25,320
<i>Some had high hopes
that genetic engineering...</i>

173
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,329
<i>would correct this
trend in evolution.</i>

174
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:30,469
<i>But sadly, the greatest minds
and resources...</i>

175
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:35,241
<i>were focused on conquering hair loss
and prolonging erections.</i>

176
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:42,923
<i>Meanwhile, the population exploded,
and intelligence continued to decline...</i>

177
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,427
<i>until humanity was incapable
of solving even its most basic problems.</i>

178
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:52,321
<i>Like garbage, which had been stacked
for centuries with no plan whatsoever...</i>

179
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:57,097
<i>leading to the Great Garbage
Avalanche of 2505...</i>

180
00:10:57,195 --> 00:11:02,313
<i>which would set in motion the events
that would change the world forever.</i>

181
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:37,606
<i>- Hold on.
- Next, on The Violence Channel...</i>

182
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:39,846
<i>an all-new Ow! My Balls!</i>

183
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,529
All right.

184
00:12:02,252 --> 00:12:04,641
<i>That guy got hit in the balls.</i>

185
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:07,169
Ow, my balls!

186
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:12,810
Huh?

187
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,625
<i>- Where's--
- Hold on. Shut up!</i>

188
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,775
- Where's Officer Collins?
- Shut up!

189
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:40,355
<i>Next week on Ow! My Balls!
Hormel goes to Paris!</i>

190
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,999
- Are we on base?
- I'm gonna base your ass on my fist.

191
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,395
In your face, ass!
Shut up.

192
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:50,532
<i>I'm sorry. It's just--
Where am I?</i>

193
00:12:50,635 --> 00:12:52,741
Shut up!
I told you already!

194
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,693
Yeah! Wouldn't shut up!

195
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,388
<i>Come in here
and not shut up.</i>

196
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,907
<i>Yeah, you were like,
"I'm not shuttin' up," and I was like--</i>

197
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:24,777
<i>Unaware of what year it was...</i>

198
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,745
<i>Joe wandered the streets,
desperate for help.</i>

199
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:30,121
<i>But the English language
had deteriorated...</i>

200
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,108
<i>into a hybrid of hillbilly, valley girl,
inner-city slang and various grunts.</i>

201
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:38,507
<i>Joe was able to understand them...</i>

202
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:41,833
<i>but when he spoke
in an ordinary voice...</i>

203
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:44,419
<i>he sounded pompous
and faggy to them.</i>

204
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,209
<i>Paging Doc--</i>

205
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,482
<i>Report to, uh--</i>

206
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,802
<i>Dr. Lueboo...</i>

207
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,077
<i>uh, report.</i>

208
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,929
Your floor-Your floor is now clean.

209
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:20,166
Your floor--
Your floor is now clean.

210
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,536
<i>Your floor--
Your floor is now clean.</i>

211
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:27,556
Hi, uh, I was in an army experiment,
and I'm not feeling so well.

212
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,147
I think it might have been
the drugs they had me on.

213
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,292
I've been hallucinating.

214
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:34,762
<i>My head is just killin' me.</i>

215
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:37,761
<i>My-My-My joints
are all achy and I--</i>

216
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:41,258
<i>Is this a hospital or--</i>

217
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:45,317
<i>Actually, I don't even know where I am.</i>

218
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,558
<i>Please proceed
to the diagnostic area on the right...</i>

219
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,816
<i>- and have a healthy day!
- Oh. Thanks.</i>

220
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,607
<i>Thank you!</i>

221
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:08,195
Uh, 'scuse me. I think this
might be Gatorade or somethin'.

222
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,082
- I was just looking for some regular water.
- Water?

223
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,082
- Yeah.
- You mean like in the toilet? What for?

224
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,970
You know, just to drink.

225
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:26,600
<i>You've got hepatitis!</i>

226
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,350
<i>Oh, is someone not
feeling well?</i>

227
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:32,867
<i>Your illness
is very important to us.</i>

228
00:15:32,971 --> 00:15:35,721
<i>- Next.
- Welcome
to the Healthmaster Inferno...</i>

229
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,762
<i>- powered by Jormi Technology.
- Uh, this goes in your mouth.</i>

230
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:43,082
This one goes in your ear.
And this one goes in your butt.

231
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,885
Come on.

232
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,770
<i>- Hurry up, asshole!
- Come on!</i>

233
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,639
Shit. Hang on a second.

234
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,674
This one-- No.

235
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,527
- Hey, come on.
- Uh--

236
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:02,694
- Hurry up!
- This one. This one goes in your mouth.

237
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:06,794
Come on!

238
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:15,010
<i>Thank you for waiting.
Dr. Lexus will be with you shortly.</i>

239
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:23,015
<i>That's a weird misprint.</i>

240
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:28,009
<i>Hey.
How's it hang, ese?</i>

241
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:31,653
Yeah. Right.
Well, not so good, you know.

242
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:34,625
I don't really know what's going on,
but I'm seein' things.

243
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:37,514
I think it might be because of
these drugs the army put me on.

244
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:41,157
<i>But, if you could, uh, just get me
well enough to get back to base--</i>

245
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,813
Right. Kick ass.

246
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,915
<i>Well, don't wanna sound
like a dick or nothin'...</i>

247
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,737
but, uh, it says on your chart
that you're fucked up.

248
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:53,185
<i>You talk like a fag,
and your shit's all retarded.</i>

249
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:57,482
What I'd do is just like,
like, you know...

250
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,875
<i>like, you know what I mean? Like--</i>

251
00:17:00,972 --> 00:17:05,063
- No, I'm serious here.
- Don't worry, scrot.

252
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:08,066
Now there are plenty of 'tards
out there living really kick-ass lives.

253
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:11,401
<i>My first wife was 'tarded.
She's a pilot now.</i>

254
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:15,209
I need for you to be serious
for a second here, okay? I need help.

255
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:16,999
There's that fag talk
we talked about.

256
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,776
<i>All right, so that'll be...
this many dollars.</i>

257
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:24,771
<i>And if you could just go ahead and,
like, put your tattoo in that shit.</i>

258
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:28,650
That's weird. This thing has the same
misprint as that magazine.

259
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:32,642
- What are the odds of--
- Where's your tattoo? Tattoo?

260
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:35,399
<i>Why don't you have this?</i>

261
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:39,818
Oh, God.

262
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,768
<i>- Where's your tattoo?
- Oh, my God.</i>

263
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,243
<i>Why come you don't
have a tattoo?</i>

264
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,714
<i>- Oh, my God!
- You're not unscannable, are you?</i>

265
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:55,013
Oh, my God!

266
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,411
You're unscannable.

267
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:01,191
- Unscannable!
- No! No, you don't understand!

268
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:03,747
<i>You gotta let me talk
to someone in the army! Wait a second.</i>

269
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,568
They're all dead.
Everybody I know's dead!

270
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,325
Oh, my God! Oh!

271
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:13,349
- No! Stop! Calm down!
- Calm down! Calm down!

272
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,524
- How'd this happen?
- How did it happen?

273
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,726
<i>Your floor is now clean.</i>

274
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,999
Your floor is now clean.

275
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:44,331
<i>Joe had awakened to a world in crisis.</i>

276
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:47,526
<i>The economy was
in a state of deep neglect.</i>

277
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,944
<i>A great dust bowl
had ravaged food supplies.</i>

278
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:55,689
<i>And the number one movie
in the country was called Ass.</i>

279
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,420
<i>And that's all it was
for 90 minutes.</i>

280
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:07,396
<i>It won eight Oscars that year,
including best screenplay.</i>

281
00:19:11,308 --> 00:19:14,275
Enjoy your Extra Big-Ass Fries.

282
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:17,249
You didn't gimme no fries.
I got an empty box.

283
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:20,072
Would you like another
Extra Big-Ass Fries?

284
00:19:20,172 --> 00:19:21,798
I said I didn't get any.

285
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,688
<i>Thank you. Your account has been charged.</i>

286
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,610
Your balance is zero.

287
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:29,057
- What? Oh, no. No!
- Please come back when you
can afford to make a purchase.

288
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,986
I'm sorry you're having trouble.

289
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,506
- Come on! My kids are starvin'.
- I'm sorry you're having trouble.

290
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,305
This should
help you calm down.

291
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,162
Please come back when you
can afford to make a purchase.

292
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:46,245
Your kids are starving. Carl's Jr. believes
no child should go hungry.

293
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:51,104
<i>You are an unfit mother. Your children
will be placed in the custody of Carl's Jr.</i>

294
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:54,113
Carl's Jr.
"Fuck you. I'm eating."

295
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,159
Welcome to Carl's Jr.

296
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,708
Would you like to try
our Extra Big-Ass Taco...

297
00:20:00,811 --> 00:20:03,266
now with more molecules?

298
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:06,241
<i>Hey! Is this particular
individual the unfit mother?</i>

299
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:10,123
- Me? No.
- Okay. This particular individual is unscannable.

300
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:15,527
Listen, I can explain, okay?
I was in an army experiment.

301
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,803
<i>Wait a second. There's the other pod
from the army experiment.</i>

302
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,078
<i>There was a girl.
She was from the same experiment.</i>

303
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,409
Yeah, that's enough of your bullshit, sir.

304
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,450
<i>Joe was arrested for not
paying his hospital bill...</i>

305
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:31,851
<i>and not having
his U.P.C. tattoo.</i>

306
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:37,032
<i>He would soon discover that
in the future, justice was not only blind...</i>

307
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:40,776
<i>but had become
rather retarded as well.</i>

308
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,723
You shut up! Now--

309
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:47,974
I'm fixin' to commensurate
this trial here.

310
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:52,516
<i>We gonna see if we can't
come up with a verdict up in here.</i>

311
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,613
<i>Now, since y'all
say you ain't got no money...</i>

312
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,912
we have "proprietarily"
obtained for you...

313
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:03,689
<i>one of them
court-appointed lawyers.</i>

314
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:08,610
<i>So, put your hands together
and give it up for Frito Pendejo.</i>

315
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:10,373
You're my lawyer?

316
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:14,632
Says here you, uh,
robbed a hospital?

317
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,033
- Why'd you do that?
- Yeah. I'm not guilty.

318
00:21:17,132 --> 00:21:19,815
- That's not what the other lawyer said.
- What do you mean what the--

319
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,803
Listen, you gotta get me
on the stand, okay?

320
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,769
I can explain everything. We can take 'em
to your house, show 'em the pod.

321
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,046
<i>Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</i>

322
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:30,442
<i>Now, prosecutor,
why you think he done it?</i>

323
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,441
Okay, number one, Your Honor,
just look at him.

324
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,849
He talks like a fag too.

325
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:42,501
And "B," we've got all this,
like, evidence...

326
00:21:42,604 --> 00:21:45,419
of how, like, this guy didn't
even pay at the hospital.

327
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:48,330
<i>And I heard that he doesn't
even have his tattoo.</i>

328
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:50,599
I know!

329
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:54,082
And I'm all, "You've gotta be shittin' me."
But check this out, man.

330
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,969
Judge should be like, "Guilty."
Peace.

331
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:05,031
- Objection!
- What are you objectifyin' on?

332
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:07,303
- Come on. Just get me on the stand.
- Okay.

333
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,918
- Um, Your Honor?
- Hmm?

334
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:12,775
I object...

335
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,705
that this guy also broke
my apartment to shit.

336
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:18,721
<i>- Yeah.
- What?</i>

337
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:23,170
And you know what else? I object that
he's not gonna have any money to pay me...

338
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:26,276
<i>after he pays back all the money
he stole from the hospital!</i>

339
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,289
Don't say I stole.
You're my lawyer.

340
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:30,250
And I object.

341
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,057
<i>I object that he interrupted me
while I was watching Ow! My Balls!</i>

342
00:22:34,155 --> 00:22:38,433
That is not okay! And I rest my case!

343
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,842
Your Honor, I'm pretty sure
we have a mistrial here, sir.

344
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,169
- I'm gonna mistrial my foot up
your ass, you don't shut up.

345
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:46,634
- Please, listen.
- "Please, listen."

346
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,389
I didn't steal anything.

347
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,314

<i>Joe stated his case logically and passionately...</i>

349
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:58,276
<i>but his perceived effeminate voice
only drew big gales of stupid laughter.</i>

350
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,973
Guilty!

351
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:04,516
<i>Without adequate legal representation,
Joe was given a stiff sentence.</i>

352
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:09,126
<i>Meanwhile, Rita had awakened
to find that the world's oldest profession...</i>

353
00:23:09,227 --> 00:23:12,332

No, it's not correct.

Oh, that's fuckin' great.

Okay, sir...

00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:30,024
now we will begin to proceed
to obtain your I.Q. and "apitude" tests.

What for?

395
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:36,134
Okay, sir, this is to figure out
what your "aptude's" good at...

396
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:41,157
<i>and get you a jail job while
you're being a particular individual in jail.</i>

00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:49,382
how many buckets
do you have?

400
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:53,066
Two?

<i>Joe used his superior
intelligence...</i>

405
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:05,098
<i>to come up with the best
escape plan he could think of.</i>

406
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:10,597
Hi. Excuse me. I'm actually supposed
to be getting out of prison today, sir.

407
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,730
Yeah.

408
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:16,650
You're in the wrong line,
dumb ass. Over there.

409
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:19,911
I'm sorry. I am being
a big dumb ass. Sorry.

410
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,605
Hey, uh,
let this dumb ass through.

411
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:40,549
- 'Too.
- Yeah. Got it.

412
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:48,010
Uh, yeah, I don't see you in here.
So, you're gonna have to, uh, stay in prison.

413
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:49,930
Could you check again?

414
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:52,963
'Cause, I was, you know--
I was definitely in prison, okay?

415
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:56,842
I got sat on my face and everything.
Maybe check those files back there?

00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:07,239
<i>"Excape." "Excape."</i>

417
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,795

<i>And now, Sweet Bang Tube.</i>

422
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,791
Oh, yeah, give me some. Cut me a piece.

00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,801
<i>Oh, yeah, that's--</i>

424
00:28:44,907 --> 00:28:46,729
Go away! 'Batin'!

425
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:50,852
Damn it.

426
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:53,345
All right.

427
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,090
Hey. Hey, get out of here.
Hey, get out of here!

428
00:28:58,188 --> 00:29:02,116
No, wait, listen. You let me,
an innocent man, get thrown in jail.

429
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,449
So? Shut up,
'cause you broke my house.

430
00:29:05,548 --> 00:29:08,362
Hey, I could have you disbarred--
disbarred-- for what you did to me.

431

<i>Then maybe you'd go to jail

Oh, really?

433
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:16,391
Yeah, really. Now, look.
Okay, here's the deal.

434
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:18,401
I've been thinking.
It's been 500 years.

435
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,354
Someone has to have invented a way
to travel back in time by now.

436
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:24,234
You know, I think they were pretty close
even in my day. You know?

437
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,154
- With Einstein and guys like that?
- Uh-huh.

438
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,706
- You know, scientists? You know?
- Uh.

439
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:31,818
A time machine,
for time travel.

440
00:29:31,915 --> 00:29:34,436
<i>- Do they have one?
- What?</i>

441
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:42,313
Jesus. I knew that was
too much to hope for.

442
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:45,411
No, no, they got
a time machine.

443
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:47,338
- They do?
- Yeah.

444
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:49,258
<i>- Are-Are-Are you sure?
- Yeah.</i>

445
00:29:49,356 --> 00:29:53,033
- Can it get me back to 2005?
- Oh, yeah, but it's, like, really expensive.

446
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:56,230
And it breaks all the time 'cause
some smart guy made it a long time ago.

447
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,404
I don't care.
Just get me there, okay?

448
00:29:58,508 --> 00:29:59,915
- Well--
- Please!

449
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:03,110
Listen, I-- I--
I "supersize" with you...

450
00:30:03,212 --> 00:30:05,863
<i>but didn't you go to jail
for not havin' enough money?</i>

451
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:09,924
Okay, how about this? You get me
to the time machine, and when I get back...

452
00:30:10,028 --> 00:30:11,937
I open a savings account
in your name.

453
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,465
That way, 500 years later,
it'll be worth billions.

454
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:16,033
<i>- Billions!
- 'Cause?</i>

455
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,857
'Cause of the interest,
it'll be worth billions of dollars.

456
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:21,411
- Oh, I-- I like money.
- Yeah.

457
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:24,385
- How many billions?
- Like, 10.

458
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:27,525
Yeah, suck one.
Time machine costs, like, 20.

459
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:30,310
Yeah? Okay.
Uh, 30, Frito.

460
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,445
<i>Thirty billion dollars.</i>

461
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:37,802
Thirty billion.
So if you gave me 30 billion...

462
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:39,809
<i>and the time machine's 20--</i>

463
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:41,770
What's the minus
of 30 and 20?

464
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:44,486
Uh, it's, uh--
it's 80, Frito.

465
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:47,009
<i>It's $80 billion.
That's a mighty big minus, isn't it?</i>

466
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:50,694
<i>- Yeah. I like money though.
- Police! Open the door!</i>

467
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:52,868
<i>We're looking for an "excaped" individual.</i>

468
00:30:52,972 --> 00:30:56,419
<i>- This particular individual's name is Not Sure.
- Eighty billion.</i>

469
00:30:56,524 --> 00:31:00,353
Oh, um, he--
He's... somewhere else.

470
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,616
- You got something I can wear?
- Yeah. There's Pro-Wear on the top,
assorted in the middle.

471
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:06,755
<i>A Coke machine in the vicinity caught his tattoo.</i>

472
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,510
<i>Seemed to be heading
for this particular "domistile."</i>

473
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:11,914
<i>Okay, sir, we're comin' in.</i>

474
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:14,215
<i>- No, you can't come in.
- Can too!</i>

475
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:16,290
- Come on!
- All right, let's go get my billions.

476
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:22,402
Oh, okay, one more thing. We gotta go find
this girl, Rita, first, okay?

477
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,158
- Is she bangin'?
- Yeah, sure, she is.

478
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,082
That wasn't really
part of the deal.

479
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,922
- Okay, I'll, uh, throw in another
couple billion, all right?
- I like money.

480
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,954
Okay, her pod's up here on the right.
She shouldn't be far away, I hope.

481
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,632
<i>Mmm, girl. Oh, yeah?
So when we gonna do it?</i>

482
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:41,928
'Cause you been chargin' me by the hour,
and it's been, like, three days.

483
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:45,857
Oh, yeah. Soon, baby, soon.
Hey, you know what?

484
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:48,484
Why don't you
come back tomorrow?

485
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:51,108
- Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah!
- Yeah?

486
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:54,245
When I finally utilize you,
you gonna be paying me.

487
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:57,664
That's right.
Whatever you say, sir.

488
00:31:57,771 --> 00:32:00,138
- Hey, you still on the clock!
- Yeah, girl.

489
00:32:00,236 --> 00:32:03,236
- Thank you!
- Rita!

490
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:07,049
Rita! It's me, Joe, from the experiment.
Get in the car! Come on.

491
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:09,352
Oh, yeah!
What the hell, man?

492
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:11,274
Just get in the car.
I'll explain everything.

493
00:32:11,371 --> 00:32:13,760
- Where we going?
- Just get in the car.

494
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:15,940
<i>- Trust me.
- What happened to those army guys?</i>

495
00:32:18,699 --> 00:32:21,088
Wait a minute. You got cops after you?

496
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:24,676
- Yeah.
- And you made me get in the car?
I got two strikes, asshole!

497
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,147
Frito, take a right here.
Right, right!

498
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:29,131
<i>Into that dust storm,
Frito.</i>

499
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:37,027
<i>They must have just forgotten about us.</i>

500
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:40,393
<i>It's been 500 years? Oh, hell, no!</i>

501
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:44,518
Upgrayedd is gonna kill me! He gets mad
when I'm a day late with his money!

502
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,627
So, you owe
your boyfriend money?

503
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,120
Well, yeah,
he's sort of my manager too.

504
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,872
<i>You know, he helps me sell
the paintings and shit.</i>

505
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:58,089
Look, Rita, you gotta understand that
Upgrayedd's been dead for a long time now.

506
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,871
- Yeah, man, but you said there
was a time machine, right?
- Yeah.

507
00:33:00,972 --> 00:33:04,355
Yeah, there's a time machine
now that can take us back to the past...

508
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,762
but there was no
time machine back then, so--

509
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,674
Upgrayedd don't care where
the time machine is. Now, then, last week--

510
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:12,619
He will find a way
to come get his money!

511
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:15,683
- All I'm saying is you don't have to worry about it--
- You know what?

512
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:18,242
<i>Last time you told me not to worry
was 500 goddamn years ago...</i>

513
00:33:18,348 --> 00:33:20,617
when you were trying to tell me
to get into some coffin.

514
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,625
Look, Rita, I don't know
how this happened, okay?

515
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:25,896
But I'm doing everything I can
to get us back there, okay? I promise you.

516
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:29,410
<i>You are harboring
a fugitive by the name of Not Sure.</i>

517
00:33:29,516 --> 00:33:32,996
Please, pull over and wait for the police
to incarcerate your passenger.

518
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,882
<i>- Hell, no. You know what? Let me outta here.
- Thank you for your help.</i>

519
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,119
If you don't have one of these,
they're gonna throw you in jail.

520
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:41,089
You don't want to get thrown in the jails here.
I've been in them.

521
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:43,813
They're bad. You're better off being with us,
as bad as that sounds.

522
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:47,745
- What are you doing? Why are we slowing down?
- Turned off my battery.

523
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:55,328
Look, how far is it?
Can we just take a cab or something?

524
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,230
Oh, shit.

525
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:10,372
Oh! Oh, shit!

526
00:34:10,476 --> 00:34:12,614
Yeah!

527
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:15,880
<i>What the hell's wrong
with you? That's your car.</i>

528
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:20,614
<i>Oh, hell, yeah! He's on fire!</i>

529
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:22,439
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

530
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:33,441
<i>Hey, how much farther is it?</i>

531
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,417
Uh, it's, like, far.

532
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:40,811
Man, I could really
go for a Starbucks, you know?

533
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:44,323
Yeah, well, I really don't think we have time
for a hand job, Joe.

534
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:52,737
<i>Man, he don't seem too bright.
You sure he knows where he's going?</i>

535
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:54,948
I sure hope so.
He's our only chance.

536
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:58,434
How'd you hook up with this guy, anyway?

537
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,631
He's my lawyer.
And he's not a very good one either.

538
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:05,187
<i>He's a goddamned idiot.</i>

539
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:09,896
There's a shuttle down in the Costco.
It'll drop us right by the time machine.

540
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:30,981
Jesus Christ.
Oh, look. One more thing.

541
00:35:31,084 --> 00:35:34,346
He thinks he's gonna get billions of dollars
if he takes us there.

542
00:35:34,443 --> 00:35:38,404
So if he mentions anything about
a savings account, just play along, okay?

543
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:40,330
Yeah, what if this
time machine don't work?

544
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:43,592
Then I'll spend
the rest of my life trying to fix it.

545
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:53,474
Welcome to Costco. I love you.
Welcome to Costco. I love you.

546
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:56,808
Welcome to Costco.
I love you.

547
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:02,471
Shuttle's down there in electronics,
about an hour from here.

548
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:12,328
We've been walking forever.
You sure you know where you're going?

549
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:15,776
Yeah, I know this place pretty good.
I went to law school here.

550
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:17,738
In Costco?

551
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:20,137
<i>Yeah. I couldn't
believe it myself.</i>

552
00:36:20,236 --> 00:36:23,749
<i>Luckily, my dad was an alumnus
and pulled some strings.</i>

553
00:36:25,132 --> 00:36:27,815
<i>Hey, come on, Joe.
I already told you...</i>

554
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:30,883
<i>we'd all like a hand job,
but we don't have time for it.</i>

555
00:36:40,236 --> 00:36:42,058
<i>Hey, baby, wanna go out?</i>

556
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:44,611
<i>Wanna go out, honey?</i>

557
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:53,572
Shuttle comes every few minutes.
Shouldn't be long.

558
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:57,254
Do I got time to use the bathroom?

559
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:01,957
<i>- Uh, the toilet.
- Be right back.</i>

560
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:05,195
Yeah,
back that thing up.

561
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:07,495
- Hey, you mind if I pound on that, Joe?
- What?

562
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:09,351
- I like having sex with chicks.
- Yeah?

563
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:11,274
- Yeah.
- I think everybody does, Frito.

564
00:37:11,372 --> 00:37:14,601
Not like I do. Like when you
get it like this, sideways.

565
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,121
Then you just, like,
back it up. And then you--

566
00:37:17,228 --> 00:37:19,333
<i>- That's real good.
- Then you-- Oh, yeah!</i>

567
00:37:19,435 --> 00:37:21,443
Stop! You're gonna
get us caught, okay?

568
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:23,369
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

569
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,889
<i>Costco has detected a dangerous
fugitive in aisle 16,702.</i>

570
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,330
Hey! What about Rita?
We can't just leave her here.

571
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:30,566
I don't care.
Come on!

572
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:34,858
Oh, shit. Wait a second. What are we gonna do?

573
00:37:34,956 --> 00:37:36,810
Wait, okay, I know.
Here's what we do.

574
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,558
We go to the time machine,
then when I get back to the past...

575
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,514
I tell her not
to do the experiment.

576
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:43,716
- Then she won't even be here. That'll work, right?
- Uh--

577
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,707
<i>- No, wait.
- Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

578
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:48,487
She already is here. That must mean
I didn't go back in time, right?

579
00:37:48,587 --> 00:37:51,653
- Uh--
- No, wait, hold on. It just
means I haven't done it yet.

580
00:37:51,755 --> 00:37:54,439
Okay, so I go back and I tell
her not to do the experiment.

581
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,994
Then I won't have to do it either
because she won't be here.

582
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,402
- Then I won't have to
come back and save her, right?
- I--

583
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:02,052
- But then, wait. Why am I still here?
- Uh--

584
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:04,043
Goddamn, how does
this time travel work?

585
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:07,849
<i>- Please stand clear.
- Freeze! Hands up! Don't move!</i>

586
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:10,533
- Put your hands up!
- Don't move! Freeze!

587
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:23,202
Look, if you guys are
taking me back to that jail...

588
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:25,926
<i>just go ahead and shoot me,
'cause there's no way--</i>

589
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:29,159
Ow! Fuck! Ow! Ow!

590
00:38:29,259 --> 00:38:33,569
- What?
- Ow! Ow. Ow. Ow.

591
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:35,531
<i>What?</i>

592
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,766
<i>- Ow! God! Hey, stop!
- Damn it.</i>

593
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:43,173
<i>- What is this?
- Okay, sir, this is the White House.</i>

594
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:45,480
<i>- What are we doing at the White House?
- What?</i>

595
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:47,783
<i>Ow! Ow! Goddamn!</i>

596
00:38:47,884 --> 00:38:51,200
<i>It turned out the results
of Joe's I.Q. test...</i>

597
00:38:51,308 --> 00:38:55,236
<i>had caught the attention
of the highest levels of government.</i>

598
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,333
Okay, wait a minute. I'm the smartest guy
in the world? Says who?

599
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:01,443
The I.Q. test you
took in prison.

600
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,198
You got the highest score in history.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

601
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,082
<i>Yeah, dumb ass, you're even smarter
than President Camacho.</i>

602
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,831
That's how come he's making
you secretary of interior.

603
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,819
Okay, so who are you?

604
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,574
I'm the secretary of energy.

605
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:16,228
He won a contest.
Got to be a cabinet member.

606
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:19,976
I'm the secretary of state.
Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

607
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:23,206
- Why do you keep saying that?
- 'Cause they pay me every time I do.

608
00:39:23,307 --> 00:39:27,017
It's a really good way to make money.
You're so smart, why don't you know that?

609
00:39:28,715 --> 00:39:31,170
- He's the secretary of defense.
- Hi.

610
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:34,123
And, uh, funbags over there
is the attorney general.

611
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,456
Hi.

612
00:39:36,555 --> 00:39:38,628
And that's
the secretary of education.

613
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,849
<i>He's kinda stupid, but he's
President Camacho's stepbrother.</i>

614
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,086
<i>Still, he does
a pretty good job, eh?</i>

615
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:49,603
You know, I think there's been
some kind of mistake...

616
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:53,024
'cause the test I took
was real, real easy.

617
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:56,961
I'm not the smartest guy
in the world. Okay?

618
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,897
Okay, even if that were true,
I can't be the secretary of the interior.

619
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:08,320
<i>- I don't even know what it is.
- You better find out.</i>

620
00:40:08,427 --> 00:40:11,177
- Sit down. It's President Camacho.
- Hey, hey, hey, yo...

621
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:15,072
<i>I gotta take care of some "bidness," baby,
so I need y'all to wait outside.</i>

622
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,914
<i>Dwayne Elizondo Camacho,
five-time Ultimate Smackdown Champion...</i>

<i>porn superstar, and president
of the United States...</i>

624
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:27,177
<i>had called a special summit
with the smartest man in the world.</i>

625
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:29,795
- So you smart, huh?
- No, no.

626
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,133
I thought your head would be bigger.

627
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:41,028
Goddamn.

628
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:43,400
It look like a peanut.

629
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:45,354
Let's get you sworn in.

630
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:02,856
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the president of America!</i>

631
00:41:06,316 --> 00:41:08,683
<i>President Camacho!</i>

632
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,326
Shut up.

633
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,322
Shut up. Sit your monkey ass down.

634
00:41:16,428 --> 00:41:17,922
Chill out.

635
00:41:21,995 --> 00:41:23,369
Shit.

636
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,613
<i>I know shit's bad right now
with all that starvin' bullshit.</i>

637
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:30,380
And the dust storms. And we runnin'
out of French fries and burrito coverings.

638
00:41:30,414 --> 00:41:33,097
And the dust storms. And we runnin'
out of French fries and burrito coverings.

639
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:34,756
Yeah!

640
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,642
- But I got a solution.
- That's what you said last time, dipshit!

641
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,562
<i>I got a solution.
You're a dick!</i>

642
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:42,147
South Carolina, "whassup?"

643
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:52,390
That's what I thought!

644
00:41:55,084 --> 00:41:58,215
Now, I understand everyone's
shit's emotional right now...

645
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,737
but listen up.

646
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:03,495
I got a three-point plan
to fix everything.

647
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:05,024
<i>Break it down, Camacho!</i>

648
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:10,118
Number one,
we got this guy, Not Sure.

649
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,856
<i>- Number two, he's got a higher
I.Q. than any man alive.</i>

650
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:19,079
<i>And number three, he's gonna fix everything.</i>

651
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,279
<i>I give you my word
as president.</i>

652
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:24,801
He'll fix the problems
with all the dead crops.

653
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:27,209
He's gonna
make 'em grow again.

654
00:42:27,308 --> 00:42:32,065
<i>- Crops?
- And that ain't all. I give you my word.</i>

655
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,994
He's gonna fix
the dust storms too.

656
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:41,155
I give you my word.

657
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,642
He's gonna
fix the "ecomony."

658
00:42:46,668 --> 00:42:49,319
And he's so smart...

659
00:42:49,419 --> 00:42:54,405
he's gonna do it all in one week.

660
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:57,922
<i>President Camacho stood before
the world and promised everyone...</i>

661
00:42:58,028 --> 00:43:01,475
<i>that Joe would solve
all their problems.</i>

662
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,573
<i>He would not only end the dust bowl
and heal the economy...</i>

663
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:08,195
<i>but he would cure acne
and carsickness as well.</i>

664
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,471
<i>And if he didn't...</i>

665
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:12,961
<i>President Camacho
made another promise.</i>

666
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:16,548
<i>He would kick Joe's smart balls
all the way up to the roof of his smart mouth.</i>

667
00:43:16,651 --> 00:43:20,645
<i>- And then, he would throw
his brainy ass back in jail.</i>

668
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:26,980
I should, uh, be honest
with you, Mr. President.

669
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,124
I don't know how to be
secretary of anything.

670
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:30,634
I mean, I've never
even voted, actually.

671
00:43:30,732 --> 00:43:33,415
I don't know what the secretary
of the interior even is.

672
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:37,988
Come on, scrot. Don't be a pussy.
It beats jail, don't it?

673
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:42,248
Besides,
you do a kick-ass job...

674
00:43:42,348 --> 00:43:44,487
you get a full
presidential pardon.

675
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:46,409
- No jail time.
- Yeah?

676
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:49,988
Fuck, yeah!
Now gimme a beer.

677
00:43:50,091 --> 00:43:52,066
<i>And get you one too.</i>

678
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,650
Shit!

679
00:43:59,755 --> 00:44:02,122
<i>Hold on, vato!</i>

680
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:03,877
<i>Whoo!</i>

681
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,668
- Do somethin' smart.
- Yeah.

682
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:30,468
Uh, okay.
Uh--

683
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:33,506
<i>I'll, uh--</i>

684
00:44:33,611 --> 00:44:37,027
- Hey, we found that lawyer you wanted.
- Oh, okay. Great, thanks.

685
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:41,921
<i>Uh, right now, I'm going to, uh, you know,
confer with my counsel.</i>

686
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:43,816
<i>You understand?
So I'll be right back.</i>

687
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:47,145
Gotta go, uh, work on some crop stuff,
get that taken care of.

688
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:51,716
- Hopefully get it worked out
by the time we get back here.
- Sounds pretty smart.

689
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,707
Wait here, okay?
Wait there.

690
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:56,520
Dude, this is trepidatious.
You got me a room at the White House.

691
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,507
Everyone gets laid at the White House.
Everyone.

692
00:44:58,603 --> 00:45:00,163
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

693
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:03,562
I'm real glad you're happy to be here, Frito,
but I brought you here to help me.

694
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,212
<i>I don't know the first thing
about growin' crops...</i>

695
00:45:06,316 --> 00:45:08,454
much less
the goddamn "ecomony."

696
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:10,410
Econ-Economy.

697
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,322
Let's see.
Growin' crops--

698
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,932
No, I just need you to tell me
how to get to the time machine.

699
00:45:17,036 --> 00:45:21,029
Oh, that's easy.
You go down by the museum and stuff.

700
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:23,074
It's, like--
It's, like, by the museum...

701
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,667
sort of, but, well,
actually, not really.

702
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:30,114
More like-- But on the street. You go, um--
Wait. Let me start over.

703
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,008
Okay, you know
where the time machine is?

704
00:45:32,107 --> 00:45:34,955
Hey. Just draw me
a map, okay?

705
00:45:35,051 --> 00:45:37,572
You still want the money?

706
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:40,392
Oh. If I had some money
and a room at the White House...

707
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:45,193
- I would be like, "It's mine, all night!"
- Listen. Cut it out!

708
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:47,975
Listen, I told these people
that you were smart, okay?

709
00:45:48,075 --> 00:45:50,214
- So act smart!
- Smart like you?

710
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:53,665
<i>"Oh, I gotta go
to the time machine. I wanna go home."</i>

711
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:56,455
- I don't talk like that.
- "I don't talk like that."

712
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:58,410
Shit, I thought
there was two of you.

713
00:45:58,508 --> 00:46:00,231
See?

714
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:02,787
<i>Doesn't look that big, is it?</i>

715
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:05,891
Okay. Let's go take a look
at those crops.

716
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,825
Especially the ones, uh, you know,
out around the museum area.

717
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,957
All right?
Hey, come on!

718
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:20,195
Now, you either lead, follow,
or get out of the way. All right?

719
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,496
Whoa.
Did you just make that up?

720
00:46:23,595 --> 00:46:26,410
Yes, I did.
Now look...

721
00:46:26,508 --> 00:46:28,996
I also need help finding this girl named Rita,
like, immediately...

722
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:31,401
- and Frito will give you a hand with it.
- Why?

723
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:37,989
Well, because, uh, you know,
she'd be an essential... integral... asset...

724
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:42,696
<i>you know, for our team,
for us to, you know, utilize.</i>

725
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,850
Utilize her!
Utilize her!

726
00:46:51,947 --> 00:46:53,955
<i>Utilize!</i>

727
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:56,994
Hey, uh, but you're gonna bring her here, right?

728
00:46:57,099 --> 00:46:59,685
Oh, yeah.
Butt first!

729
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:04,331
<i>- Utilize her!
- Okay.</i>

730
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,969
Dang! May I approach
your benches?

731
00:47:18,348 --> 00:47:20,868
Uh, yeah.
This sucks pretty bad.

732
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:23,689
<i>Frito, why don't you come over here and,
uh, take a look at this?</i>

733
00:47:23,788 --> 00:47:27,083
<i>Come on. Hustle over here, buddy.
I wanna figure this out.</i>

734
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,824
See, uh, just not a lot of moisture.
Have you got the map?

735
00:47:30,924 --> 00:47:32,811
- Oh, yeah.
- Discreetly.

736
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:39,622
- It's right there.
- I see it. I see it.

737
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,179
<i>Stand up with me.</i>

738
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:45,993
Yo, Mr. Secretary Not Sure.
They found that whore you wanted.

739
00:47:46,092 --> 00:47:48,961
Hey, that may be how you refer
to women in the future, but come on.

740
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:53,159
No, sir. Turns out she charged some guy
a lotta money and didn't put out.

741
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,169
<i>Don't worry though.
We'll get her out...</i>

742
00:47:55,276 --> 00:47:58,440
on a work-release whorin' license
as long as you're doin' her.

743
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:01,605
Get your hands off me. What do you think
I'm gonna do, run through the field?

744
00:48:01,707 --> 00:48:03,944
What the fuck
are you all starin' at?

745
00:48:04,043 --> 00:48:05,985
- Joe?
- That's Not Sure, ma'am.

746
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:09,834
- Secretary Not Sure.
- Secretary? Secretary of what?

747
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:14,340
Say, would you guys mind if we had
a little moment together? Alone?

748
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:18,666
<i>You know,
in the bushes?</i>

749
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:22,186
Oh, man.

750
00:48:30,411 --> 00:48:33,826
- Fuck her, Joe!
- Hey, you want us to come along,
make sure she puts out?

751
00:48:33,932 --> 00:48:35,874
No, thanks.
I can handle it. Yeah.

752
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:39,078
I thought you was in jail.
How'd you get to be the secretary of interior?

753
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,384
Just keep walking.
I'll explain everything.

754
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:51,691
Okay.
Get ready to run.

755
00:48:54,059 --> 00:48:56,580
<i>- What?
- Oh, goddamn it.</i>

756
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,367
Way to go, Frito. You know what?
Just make a run for it anyways.

757
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:01,322
We'll ask for directions
on the way.

758
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,453
No way. I spent the last two days
looking for it. It ain't easy to find.

759
00:49:04,556 --> 00:49:07,403
Damn it. I can't go back to jail,
and I sure can't solve these problems.

760
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:10,499
All's I know is I better find Upgrayedd
before he finds me.

761
00:49:10,604 --> 00:49:13,833
Listen to me. Upgrayedd
cannot find you, okay? It's impossible!

762
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:16,550
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah! And even if Upgrayedd...

763
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:18,561
could somehow magically
travel through time...

764
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,962
we got secret service guys with huge guns
protecting us, okay?

765
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,882
So don't worry.
You're safe.

766
00:49:23,979 --> 00:49:27,013
And you know what? It's none of my business,
but when we get back...

767
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:29,636
you and Upgrayedd should seriously think
about couples counseling, okay?

768
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:33,995
And you should also think about maybe finding
an art manager who's not also your boyfriend.

769
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:38,020
<i>Hey!
She's not puttin' out?</i>

770
00:49:38,123 --> 00:49:42,084
Uh, no, she is.
We, uh-We already did it.

771
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,577
<i>Yeah. He was great.</i>

772
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,213
Okay. Hey, a couple of us guys
were wonderin', uh...

773
00:49:50,316 --> 00:49:52,203
if we'd go family-style
on her.

774
00:49:54,635 --> 00:49:57,951
Uh, yeah,
probably not right now.

775
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,376
<i>We should focus on the crops.
So let's get back to work. Maybe later.</i>

776
00:50:08,204 --> 00:50:09,829
What the hell is this?

777
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,330
<i>- Tastes like Gatorade.
- Is that that Brawndo stuff?</i>

778
00:50:16,427 --> 00:50:20,006
<i>They're watering crops
with a sports drink?</i>

779
00:50:21,612 --> 00:50:24,230
<i>Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator
had come to replace water...</i>

780
00:50:24,332 --> 00:50:26,404
<i>virtually everywhere.</i>

781
00:50:26,508 --> 00:50:28,613
<i>Water, the basic component
of all life...</i>

782
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:31,585
<i>had been deemed a threat
to Brawndo's profit margin.</i>

783
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:35,040
<i>The solution came during
the budget crisis of 2330...</i>

784
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:39,785
<i>when the Brawndo Corporation
simply bought the F.D.A...</i>

785
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:41,291
<i>and the F.C.C...</i>

786
00:50:41,387 --> 00:50:43,526
<i>enabling them to say,
do and sell...</i>

787
00:50:43,628 --> 00:50:45,450
<i>anything they wanted.</i>

788
00:50:50,283 --> 00:50:52,804
<i>Joe didn't know
any of this...</i>

789
00:50:52,907 --> 00:50:56,737
<i>but he did see a problem
that he might actually be able to solve.</i>

790
00:50:56,843 --> 00:51:01,218
<i>- With his options running out,
Joe took a bold step.</i>

791
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,364
<i>He would not
get out of the way.</i>

792
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:06,217
<i>This time, he would lead.</i>

793
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:08,258
For the last time,
I'm pretty sure...

794
00:51:08,363 --> 00:51:11,211
what's killing the crops
is this Brawndo stuff.

795
00:51:11,308 --> 00:51:13,958
But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
It's got electrolytes.

796
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,035
<i>So wait a minute.
What you're saying...</i>

797
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:19,784
is that you want us
to put water on the crops.

798
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:22,785
- Yes.
- Water. Like out the toilet?

799
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:26,721
Well, I mean, it doesn't have to be
out of the toilet, but, yeah, that's the idea.

800
00:51:26,828 --> 00:51:30,024
- But Brawndo's got what plants crave.
- It's got electrolytes.

801
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:32,011
Okay, look.

802
00:51:32,107 --> 00:51:35,456
The plants aren't growing, so I'm pretty sure
that the Brawndo's not working.

803
00:51:35,564 --> 00:51:40,037
Now, I'm no botanist, but I do know
that if you put water on plants, they grow.

804
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:43,685
Well, I've never seen no plants
grow out of no toilet.

805
00:51:43,787 --> 00:51:46,919
Hey, that's good. You sure you ain't
the smartest guy in the world?

806
00:51:47,019 --> 00:51:50,816
- You wanna solve this problem.
I wanna get my pardon.

807
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:54,720
So why don't we just try it, okay,
and not worry about what plants crave?

808
00:51:54,828 --> 00:51:57,195
Brawndo's got
what plants crave.

809
00:51:57,292 --> 00:51:59,713
- Goddamn it.
- Yeah, it's got electrolytes.

810
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,154
What are electrolytes?
Do you even know?

811
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:04,903
It's what they use
to make Brawndo.

812
00:52:05,003 --> 00:52:07,524
Yeah, but why do they
use them to make Brawndo?

813
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:10,082
'Cause Brawndo's
got electrolytes.

814
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:17,227
<i>After several hours,
Joe finally gave up on logic and reason...</i>

815
00:52:17,323 --> 00:52:20,258
<i>and simply told the cabinet
that he could talk to plants...</i>

816
00:52:20,363 --> 00:52:22,884
<i>and that they wanted water.</i>

817
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:26,184
<i>He made believers
out of everyone.</i>

818
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:29,699
<i>Joe didn't know it,
but the beloved electrolytes...</i>

819
00:52:29,803 --> 00:52:33,600
<i>were salts that had been
building up in the topsoil over the decades...</i>

820
00:52:33,707 --> 00:52:36,326
<i>killing plants
and leading to the dust bowl.</i>

821
00:52:36,427 --> 00:52:41,926
<i>As secretary of the interior,
Joe ordered all crops to be switched to water...</i>

822
00:52:42,027 --> 00:52:46,948
<i>promising that, over time, plants would grow
and the dust bowl would end.</i>

823
00:52:47,051 --> 00:52:50,914
<i>He was on the fast track
to a full presidential pardon.</i>

824
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,020
<i>Or so it seemed.</i>

825
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:58,826
Man, I hope somethin'
grows fast.

826
00:52:58,923 --> 00:53:00,833
Yeah. So we can haul
our ass back home.

827
00:53:00,939 --> 00:53:04,387
Man. You really think those people
would have starved to death?

828
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:10,308
I don't know. I mean, how did the world
ever get like this?

829
00:53:10,412 --> 00:53:14,121
You know things are bad
when they're comin' to me for answers.

830
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:16,870
- It's a weird feeling being smarter than everyone.
- Mm-hmm.

831
00:53:16,972 --> 00:53:19,110
- I'm not used to it.
- Yeah. Me neither.

832
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,318
You think Einstein walked around thinkin'
everyone was a bunch of dumb shits?

833
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,875
Yeah.
Hadn't thought of that.

834
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,940
- Now you know why he built that bomb.
- Yeah.

835
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,357
Hey, Joe, listen.
Those cops--

836
00:53:36,459 --> 00:53:38,631
<i>- Oh, hey. I'm sorry about that.
- No. No.</i>

837
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:41,633
They said that
you got me a pardon.

838
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,642
You know, if you hadn't done that,
I'd still be in jail right now, so...

839
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:48,420
I guess I owe you one.

840
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,955
You know, you don't have to sleep
on the floor if you don't want to.

841
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:59,301
Oh. No. I'm--
I'm all right. Yeah.

842
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:03,298
Besides, you know, I don't think Upgrayedd
would be too happy about that.

843
00:54:03,404 --> 00:54:04,997
You in bed with a stranger.

844
00:54:06,667 --> 00:54:08,839
Yeah.

845
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:13,383
I know. I know.

846
00:54:15,403 --> 00:54:20,193
<i>Yeah. Oh, boy.</i>

847
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,275
Oh, shit.
It's Upgrayedd.

848
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,714
<i>Oh, shit. It's not Upgrayedd.</i>

849
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:35,016
<i>Given enough time,
Joe's plan might have worked.</i>

850
00:54:35,115 --> 00:54:37,352
<i>But when the Brawndo stock
suddenly dropped to zero...</i>

851
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:39,786
<i>leaving half the population
unemployed...</i>

852
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:43,429
<i>dumb, angry mobs took to the streets,
rioting and looting...</i>

853
00:54:43,532 --> 00:54:45,387
<i>and screaming
for Joe's head.</i>

854
00:54:45,483 --> 00:54:48,069
<i>An emergency cabinet meeting
was called...</i>

855
00:54:48,172 --> 00:54:50,408
<i>with the C.E.O.
of the Brawndo Corporation.</i>

856
00:54:50,508 --> 00:54:52,875
How come nobody's buying
Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator?

857
00:54:52,972 --> 00:54:55,241
Aw, shit. Half the country
works for Brawndo.

858
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,990
<i>Not anymore!
The stock has dropped to zero...</i>

859
00:54:58,092 --> 00:55:00,164
<i>and the computer did
that auto-layoff thing to everybody.</i>

860
00:55:00,267 --> 00:55:02,722
- We're all unemployed!
- You think that makes the "ecomony" suck?

861
00:55:02,828 --> 00:55:06,722
- Why is this happening?
- I think it's because we switched to water, but--

862
00:55:06,828 --> 00:55:09,217
- You mean this is all your fault?
- What?

863
00:55:09,323 --> 00:55:13,000
Yeah, this is your fault. This shit started
happening when we switched to water!

864
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:16,842
Brought to you by Carl's Jr. Brought to you
by Carl's Jr. Brought to you by Carl's Jr.

865
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:21,190
<i>Fox News.</i>

866
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,234
He tried taking water
from toilets...

867
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,115
but it's Secretary Not Sure
who finds himself in the toilet now.

868
00:55:31,211 --> 00:55:33,034
And as history
pulls down its pants...

869
00:55:33,131 --> 00:55:36,263
and prepares to lower its ass
on Not Sure's head...

870
00:55:36,363 --> 00:55:40,193
it will be Daddy Justice
who will be crapping on him this time.

871
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:44,325
We now go live to Violence Channel
correspondent Formica Davis...

872
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:48,137
at the Extreme Court
with highlights on today's trial.

873
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:54,566
Thank you, Velveeta.
Well, it started off boring and slow...

874
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:58,083
with Not Sure trying to bullshit everyone
with a bunch of smart talk.

875
00:55:58,187 --> 00:56:02,116
<i>Blah, blah, blah. You gotta believe me!</i>

876
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:04,129
<i>That part of the trial sucked.</i>

877
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,788
<i>But then, the chief "J"
just went off.</i>

878
00:56:06,892 --> 00:56:08,834
<i>He said, "Man, whatever.</i>

879
00:56:08,939 --> 00:56:11,427
<i>The guy's guilty as shit.
We all know that."</i>

880
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:15,143
<i>And he sentenced his ass
to one night of Rehabilitation.</i>

881
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,699
Hey, rehabilitation?
One night?

882
00:56:17,804 --> 00:56:19,626
Doesn't sound so bad.

883
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:21,512
Not so bad, huh?

884
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:24,743
<i>Here's some highlights
from last week's Rehabilitation.</i>

885
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:38,243
<i>And who could forget that wonderful finish...</i>

886
00:56:38,347 --> 00:56:40,736
<i>by Rehab Officer Tylenol Jones?</i>

887
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:44,389
And tomorrow night looks even more better.

888
00:56:44,492 --> 00:56:48,714
Word is that Beef Supreme himself
might come out of retirement.

889
00:56:48,811 --> 00:56:51,397
Wow. Thank you, Formica.

890
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:55,681
So you think you can escape again
like you did last time?

891
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,471
- No. They pretty much fixed that.
- How?

892
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:00,743
They chained me
to a big rock.

893
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:03,913
<i>- Oh.
- Yeah.</i>

894
00:57:04,011 --> 00:57:06,116
Look, Rita, get Frito.

895
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:09,220
Get him to take you back to the time machine
without me. Don't wait.

896
00:57:09,323 --> 00:57:13,185
No. You could have split on me before,
but you didn't.

897
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:16,554
Look, you wanna pay me back?
Just go back, okay?

898
00:57:16,651 --> 00:57:19,106
Tell people to read books.

899
00:57:19,212 --> 00:57:21,219
Tell people to stay in school,
you know.

900
00:57:21,324 --> 00:57:24,706
Tell people to just
use their brains or something.

901
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:27,878
<i>I think maybe the world got like this
because of people like me.</i>

902
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,387
I never did anything with my life.
At least you were an artist, you know?

903
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:34,947
<i>- So just go back and--
- Visit's over!</i>

904
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:41,120
And Rita, whatever you do,
keep painting, okay?

905
00:57:42,604 --> 00:57:44,491
Good luck, Joe.

906
00:57:51,403 --> 00:57:54,153
<i>Okay, that's five down and one more to go.</i>

907
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:57,797
<i>Are you ready for a monster-truck duel
to the death?</i>

908
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,282
<i>Yeah! Let's give it up
for the Guitar Army.</i>

909
00:58:03,308 --> 00:58:05,195
<i>Okay, we're gonna do this shit.</i>

910
00:58:05,292 --> 00:58:08,325
<i>But first, to lead us
in our Natural Anthem...</i>

911
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:12,999
<i>the star of Ow! My Balls!
Hormel Chavez!</i>

912
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,914
Thank you. Thank you.

913
00:58:16,011 --> 00:58:20,801
<i>Hey! Come here!</i>

914
00:58:20,907 --> 00:58:24,322
Come here!

915
00:58:24,428 --> 00:58:26,250
<i>Right in the balls!</i>

916
00:58:26,348 --> 00:58:30,952
That's just how that shit went on TV!

917
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:35,110
This execution is brought to you
by Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator.

918
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,033
<i>After you've killed someone...</i>

919
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:38,986
<i>- your body needs electrolytes.
- Yeah.</i>

920
00:58:39,084 --> 00:58:42,248
So, my car's out front...

921
00:58:42,347 --> 00:58:44,519
whenever you want me
to take you...

922
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,758
to the time machine.

923
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,714
Thanks, Frito.

924
00:58:48,811 --> 00:58:50,819
<i>- Yeah.
- I can't hear you!</i>

925
00:58:50,923 --> 00:58:53,989
That's a real bummer
about Joe, huh?

926
00:58:54,092 --> 00:58:56,580
<i>- I can't hear you!
- Yeah.</i>

927
00:58:56,683 --> 00:59:01,920
<i>Oh! Can you turn this up?
I love Rehabilitation.</i>

928
00:59:12,971 --> 00:59:17,249
<i>Okay. Let's meet
our rehabilitation officers for tonight.</i>

929
00:59:17,355 --> 00:59:20,519
<i>With a combined record
of 62 kills...</i>

930
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:25,257
<i>please welcome Vinny Mawumba
in the Dildozer!</i>

931
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:36,360
<i>And his brother Bobby Mawumba
in the Ass Blaster!</i>

932
00:59:36,459 --> 00:59:38,347
I get a truck too, right?

933
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:41,062
Yeah.
Here it comes.

934
00:59:50,316 --> 00:59:52,203
Get in.

935
00:59:56,523 --> 00:59:58,793
You still got
the chain attached.

936
01:00:00,907 --> 01:00:03,362
<i>- Door won't shut.
- What about the chain?</i>

937
01:00:03,468 --> 01:00:05,355
- We could break it.
- No. He could escape.

938
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:08,866
- I got an idea. Let's put it in the trunk.
- Yeah. That'll work.

939
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:15,715
<i>- Who's smart now?
- Let's bring out our criminal.</i>

940
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:18,819
<i>He tried to ruin the country
by pouring toilet water on crops.</i>

941
01:00:18,924 --> 01:00:21,225
<i>He cost millions of people
their jobs.</i>

942
01:00:21,323 --> 01:00:24,520
<i>Let's get ready
to rehabilitate Not Sure!</i>

943
01:00:36,044 --> 01:00:38,313
Never would have guessed
this is how I was gonna die.

944
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:41,194
<i>Are you ready for some car-on-car action?</i>

945
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:43,179
Yes.

946
01:00:44,236 --> 01:00:46,953
- I can't watch this.
- This is--

947
01:00:47,051 --> 01:00:51,361
<i>This is gonna be so sad.
I hope I don't cry.</i>

948
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:56,841
Holy shit!
Frito, come here! Look!

949
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:59,306
He was right.
The water-- it worked.

950
01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:01,924
Frito, can you
get me over there?

951
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,682
Yes.

952
01:01:04,779 --> 01:01:07,649
<i>No, you fuckin' moron.
To the Rehabilitation place.</i>

953
01:01:07,755 --> 01:01:09,697
- Uh, this way.
- Yeah!

954
01:01:14,092 --> 01:01:15,914
Come on, Frito.
Hurry!

955
01:01:16,012 --> 01:01:18,914
<i>And now the dude that
everybody came here to see...</i>

956
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:22,467
<i>- Yeah!
- the only undefeated officer ever in history...</i>

957
01:01:22,571 --> 01:01:25,954
<i>coming out of retirement
just to pound Not Sure's ass...</i>

958
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:30,816
<i>driving the biggest, hugest correctional
vehicle ever built in history--</i>

959
01:01:30,924 --> 01:01:34,633
<i>bigger than the Dildozer,
bigger than the Ass Blaster...</i>

960
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:38,593
<i>bigger and huger than everything
ever before in history--</i>

961
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,514
<i>the brand-new Assdozer!</i>

962
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:44,197
<i>Give it up for Beef Supreme!</i>

963
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:49,450
Oh!

964
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,066
Oh!

965
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:13,990
<i>Oh, shit. I think it was too big, huh?</i>

966
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:16,480
<i>We seem to be
"experimenting"...</i>

967
01:02:16,588 --> 01:02:19,751
<i>some "techmological"
differences...</i>

968
01:02:19,851 --> 01:02:21,673
<i>so, uh, shit.</i>

969
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:25,000
Frito, look!

970
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,205
- It's working everywhere!
- Huh.

971
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:31,202
<i>Well, shit. That's a big pile of rocks.</i>

972
01:02:31,308 --> 01:02:34,308
<i>- Kinda reminds me of this one time that I was--
- Man.</i>

973
01:02:34,411 --> 01:02:36,353
<i>- Hey!
- Oh, oh, okay.</i>

974
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,565
<i>- Get this shit started!
- We're gonna start without Beef Supreme.</i>

975
01:02:38,668 --> 01:02:42,246
<i>Let the rehabilitation begin!</i>

976
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,859
Oh, shit.

977
01:02:53,963 --> 01:02:56,745
Come on. Come on.

978
01:02:56,843 --> 01:02:59,210
<i>Come on, Frito. Hurry!</i>

979
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:04,325
Oh!

980
01:03:08,844 --> 01:03:10,305
Goddamn it.

981
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,329
- Yeah!
- Jesus, that was close.

982
01:03:18,731 --> 01:03:21,514
Mr. President! Mr. President,
I need to talk to you.

983
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:23,717
<i>You gotta stop this thing.
He was right about the water.</i>

984
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:26,601
<i>We passed some crops
on the way here. They're growing.</i>

985
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:28,521
I didn't see no crops.

986
01:03:29,612 --> 01:03:31,237
<i>They're circling around.</i>

987
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:33,762
<i>They're gonna do
the Malachi Crunch on him!</i>

988
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:39,561
<i>- This is an illegal move, okay? So don't tell nobody.
- Oh!</i>

989
01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:02,401
<i>So, uh-So the winner is, uh--</i>

990
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:07,205
<i>- You gotta be shittin' me.
- Did he win?</i>

991
01:04:09,963 --> 01:04:12,069
Uh-oh. Look.

992
01:04:13,868 --> 01:04:17,446
<i>Holy shit! It's Beef Supreme!</i>

993
01:04:24,492 --> 01:04:26,183
<i>Beef Supreme! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

994
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:30,375
Hey, Frito. Frito, you remember
those crops we saw off the road...

995
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:32,996
- right by the Starbucks?
- Uh-huh.

996
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:37,028
- Hey. Wanna make some money?
- I like money.

997
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:54,791
Hey, um, the, uh-- the main
screen is malfunctioning...

998
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:57,313
and they gonna need you
outside immediately.

999
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,298
There's a bunch of whores
in the hallway.

1000
01:05:06,347 --> 01:05:08,736
Come on, Frito.
Hurry.

1001
01:05:09,771 --> 01:05:11,778
Can't believe
you like money too.

1002
01:05:11,884 --> 01:05:14,273
- We should hang out.
- Totally.

1003
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:40,513
<i>He's behind the truck!</i>

1004
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,190
Yes! Yes!

1005
01:05:46,507 --> 01:05:48,482
- He's behind the fucking truck!
- He's over there!

1006
01:05:48,587 --> 01:05:50,562
<i>Behind the truck, stupid!</i>

1007
01:06:00,459 --> 01:06:01,986
Look!

1008
01:06:04,108 --> 01:06:07,523
Shit.
That's a good deal.

1009
01:06:07,627 --> 01:06:11,937
<i>- Extra foam.
- I got a bunch of money too.</i>

1010
01:06:12,044 --> 01:06:14,564
- Forgot what it was for.
- Huh.

1011
01:06:15,788 --> 01:06:19,432
- You think it was for lattes?
- Yeah. Probably.

1012
01:06:19,532 --> 01:06:23,623
<i>- You like money and sex?
You're trippin' me out.
- What the fuck?</i>

1013
01:06:25,771 --> 01:06:27,910
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1014
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:40,873
- Just hold on, okay?
Everyone just take it easy, okay?

1015
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:42,793
Can I just
say something here?

1016
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,915
I don't even know
what I'm guilty of here.

1017
01:06:48,011 --> 01:06:51,754
I never said that I was the smartest person
on earth. You people did.

1018
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:55,364
I didn't know that you'd lose your jobs
and all your money...

1019
01:06:55,467 --> 01:06:57,507
and I'm very sorry
that that happened.

1020
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:59,554
<i>But I'm tellin' you...</i>

1021
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,929
if you put water on the crops,
it might actually--

1022
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:04,897
No, it will work.
I promise you!

1023
01:07:05,004 --> 01:07:09,226
<i>You just have to believe me.
I just wanted to help you. That's all.</i>

1024
01:07:09,323 --> 01:07:13,960
<i>So you can try and shoot me.
You can try and run me over, whatever.</i>

1025
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,376
But I just want you to ask yourselves
one question first.

1026
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,961
Do you really want to live
in a world...

1027
01:07:21,068 --> 01:07:24,417
where you try to blow up the one person
that's tryin' to help you?

1028
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:36,966
Hold on. Just hold on.

1029
01:07:57,483 --> 01:07:59,589
Oh, man.
That was great.

1030
01:07:59,691 --> 01:08:03,204
Hey, was I wearing pants
when we went in there?

1031
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:06,569
Shit. What do I look like,
a pants goblin?

1032
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:09,864
Wait.
This reminds me of something.

1033
01:08:09,963 --> 01:08:12,713
<i>Uh, "Rehabil-Rehabilate--</i>

1034
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:15,878
- Rehabilation."
- Why do you keep trying to read that word?

1035
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,362
- You a fag?
- I'll fag your face!

1036
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:30,562
- Come on, Frito.
- Yeah. I don't think so.

1037
01:08:31,883 --> 01:08:34,250
Oh, yeah.

1038
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:18,337
This guy just got
his ass a pardon!

1039
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:27,719
Yeah!

1040
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,715
Man, Rita. I mean,
I don't know what to say.

1041
01:09:44,812 --> 01:09:47,943
You saved my life.
No one's ever done anything like that for me.

1042
01:09:48,044 --> 01:09:49,866
Yeah, well...

1043
01:09:49,964 --> 01:09:52,866
you were looking out for the whole world so,
you know...

1044
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:56,517
- I thought someone should look out for you too.
- Thanks.

1045
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,329
I can't believe I'm even
saying this, but...

1046
01:10:00,428 --> 01:10:02,337
<i>even though these people
tried to kill me...</i>

1047
01:10:02,444 --> 01:10:05,760
- you know, I think I'm actually gonna
kinda miss 'em.
- Yeah.

1048
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:08,584
Frito-- he's gonna give us
a ride back to the time machine.

1049
01:10:08,683 --> 01:10:11,782
I just, uh--
I hope he's okay to drive.

1050
01:10:13,164 --> 01:10:16,164
It's you. Oh, man,
I really love your show.

1051
01:10:16,267 --> 01:10:18,471
Thank you so much.

1052
01:10:18,572 --> 01:10:23,525
<i>- Uh, Joe, I'm not going.
- What?</i>

1053
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:28,969
I had some pretty bad habits back there
that I don't want to fall into again.

1054
01:10:29,068 --> 01:10:30,955
Maybe it's time
I got a new start.

1055
01:10:31,052 --> 01:10:35,013
<i>Besides, they offered me
a pretty good job at Starbucks here.</i>

1056
01:10:35,115 --> 01:10:37,668
- I'm gonna be a C.E.O.
- At Starbucks?

1057
01:10:37,772 --> 01:10:40,489
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You're still gonna paint though, right?

1058
01:10:42,091 --> 01:10:45,353
Yeah. Sure.

1059
01:10:45,452 --> 01:10:47,208
I guess this is
good-bye then.

1060
01:10:49,003 --> 01:10:51,142
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</i>

1061
01:10:51,243 --> 01:10:53,611
I got a couple
presidential decrees to make!

1062
01:10:53,645 --> 01:10:55,237
I got a couple
presidential decrees to make!

1063
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:59,398
Not Sure, get your ass up here,
wherever you is.

1064
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:04,038
Let me get that little
peanut head up here.

1065
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:06,790
Yo. Yo.

1066
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,746
I have decided...

1067
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:11,265
to make this man--

1068
01:11:11,372 --> 01:11:14,187
the man who solved
all our problems--

1069
01:11:15,468 --> 01:11:18,021
<i>I have decided to make him...</i>

1070
01:11:18,123 --> 01:11:20,327
my new vice president.

1071
01:11:22,763 --> 01:11:25,862
Mr. President, thanks.
That's real cool of you, sir...

1072
01:11:25,964 --> 01:11:29,673
- but I can't accept it, sir.
- What? Why?

1073
01:11:29,772 --> 01:11:34,311
- You know, I gotta get home.
- But we still got all these problems.

1074
01:11:34,412 --> 01:11:37,281
Look, you know, you're just gonna
have to solve 'em yourselves.

1075
01:11:37,388 --> 01:11:39,755
- How?
- Think about it, you know?

1076
01:11:39,851 --> 01:11:42,786
You're just gonna have to figure it out
like we did with the crops.

1077
01:11:42,892 --> 01:11:47,234
<i>But how are we gonna figure out about
the garbage "ambulanches" and the "comony"?</i>

1078
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:52,937
<i>And what about the nuc--
"nucular" reactor in Florida?</i>

1079
01:11:53,035 --> 01:11:55,402
It's broke and leaky
and something's happening.

1080
01:11:55,499 --> 01:12:00,649
- I thought it was in Georgia.
- Georgia's in Florida, dumb ass.

1081
01:12:00,747 --> 01:12:03,682
Hey. Hey, I know.
Let's put toilet water on it. Huh?

1082
01:12:03,787 --> 01:12:06,722
- Yeah!
- Good, good. That's a good idea.

1083
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:09,413
<i>- Like we did on the crops.
- Come on, vato.</i>

1084
01:12:09,516 --> 01:12:11,719
Hey, you can't leave.

1085
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:17,515
Whatever happened to all that "lead, follow,
or get outta the way" shit, huh?

1086
01:12:27,851 --> 01:12:32,074
I guess I just can't get outta the way anymore,
can I? You know what?

1087
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:34,954
- Forget about the time machine.
- Yeah!

1088
01:12:38,828 --> 01:12:42,089
That ride sucks anyways.

1089
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:44,227
Ride?

1090
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:49,931
<i>Welcome to the Time Masheen.</i>

1091
01:12:50,027 --> 01:12:54,337
<i>We are going to take you back,
first to the year 1939...</i>

1092
01:12:54,444 --> 01:12:56,833
<i>when Charlie Chaplin
and his evil Nazi regime...</i>

1093
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,874
<i>enslaved Europe and tried
to take over the world.</i>

1094
01:12:59,979 --> 01:13:02,467
<i>So you knew this thing
was just a ride the whole time?</i>

1095
01:13:02,572 --> 01:13:05,921
Yeah. You thought you could really
travel through time, huh?

1096
01:13:06,027 --> 01:13:08,296
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- Yeah.

1097
01:13:08,396 --> 01:13:11,211
For the smartest guy in the world,
you're pretty dumb sometimes.

1098
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:16,010
- So why didn't you tell us?
- 'Cause I like money. I'm sorry.

1099
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:19,752
But if it's not a real time machine,
there wouldn't have been any money.

1100
01:13:19,852 --> 01:13:23,201
You know, 'cause I can't go back in time
and open a savings account.

1101
01:13:23,307 --> 01:13:26,122
Uh, uh, uh--

1102
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,870
Yeah. Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

1103
01:13:30,347 --> 01:13:32,202
Well,
I guess we're stuck here.

1104
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:37,188
<i>But then an even
greater force emerged-- the "UN."</i>

1105
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:41,163
<i>And the "UN"
un-nazied the world forever.</i>

1106
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:41,414
<i>And the "UN"
un-nazied the world forever.</i>

1107
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,929
<i>And so, after serving a short
term as vice president...</i>

1108
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:48,199
<i>Joe was elected
the president of America.</i>

1109
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,372
<i>Frito became vice president...</i>

1110
01:13:50,476 --> 01:13:53,509
<i>and Rita, the former prostitute,
became first lady.</i>

1111
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:56,961
Today I step into the shoes
of a great man...

1112
01:13:57,067 --> 01:14:01,028
a man by the name
of Dwayne Elizondo...

1113
01:14:01,132 --> 01:14:04,961
Mountain Dew
Herbert Camacho.

1114
01:14:05,068 --> 01:14:09,028
<i>Under President Not Sure's
leadership, a new era dawned.</i>

1115
01:14:09,132 --> 01:14:12,809
You know, there was a time
in this country...

1116
01:14:12,908 --> 01:14:16,999
when smart people
were considered cool.

1117
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:19,914
Well, maybe not cool,
but smart people did things...

1118
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:23,906
like build ships and pyramids,
and they even went to the moon.

1119
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:25,473
Yeah!

1120
01:14:27,531 --> 01:14:31,557
And there was a time
in this country, a long time ago...

1121
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,962
when reading wasn't
just for fags...

1122
01:14:34,059 --> 01:14:36,231
<i>and neither was writing.</i>

1123
01:14:36,331 --> 01:14:40,260
<i>People wrote books and movies,
movies that had stories...</i>

1124
01:14:40,363 --> 01:14:44,487
so you cared whose ass it was
and why it was farting.

1125
01:14:44,588 --> 01:14:47,904
And I believe that time
can come again!

1126
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,787
Not Sure, Not Sure, Not Sure!

1127
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:08,363
<i>Joe and Rita had three children...</i>

1128
01:15:08,459 --> 01:15:11,143
<i>the three smartest kids
in the world.</i>

1129
01:15:12,236 --> 01:15:14,625
<i>Vice President Frito
took eight wives...</i>

1130
01:15:14,731 --> 01:15:17,066
<i>and had a total of 32 kids--</i>

1131
01:15:17,163 --> 01:15:20,262
<i>thirty-two of the dumbest kids
ever to walk the earth.</i>

1132
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:28,325
<i>Okay, so maybe Joe
didn't save mankind...</i>

1133
01:15:28,427 --> 01:15:30,762
<i>but he got the ball rolling...</i>

1134
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:34,504
<i>and that's pretty good
for an average guy.</i>

1135
01:20:22,123 --> 01:20:24,709
I'm gonna go find this ho.

1136
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,112
