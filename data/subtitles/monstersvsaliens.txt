1
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:26,669
You'd better pray to the Lord When
you see those flying saucers.

2
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,090
It may be the coming
of the Judgment Day.

3
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:41,518
Hey, Jerry, you might wanna check this
one out. Palomar just picked it up.

4
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,479
Looks like some type of UFO,
and it's heading this way.

5
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:46,981
How many times do I
have to tell you?

6
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:49,484
UFOs don't exist and
we're never gonna see...

7
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:55,281
- Wow, its energy signature is massive.
- Holy Cheez-Its! What do we do?!

8
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,616
No one told us what to do!

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,410
I took this job because you
never have to do anything!

10
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,497
Jerry, stop it. Let me
calculate its impact point.

11
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,958
Looks like...

12
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,294
Modesto, California.

13
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:11,714
Supernova, this is Red Dwarf.
We actually have one!

14
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,968
Code Nimoy! I
repeat, Code Nimoy!

15
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,690
What are you guys doing here?
It's 5:00 in the morning.

16
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,942
Hurry, turn on the TV!
Turn it on now!

17
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,571
And some early morning fog,
giving way to sunny skies.

18
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,114
Seventy-five degrees.

19
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,367
A perfect day to stop by the
old folk art and craft show

20
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:26,456
down at the fairgrounds, or a
perfect day to marry Susan Murphy.

21
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,335
I love you, baby.

22
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,836
I love you, too.

23
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,925
And good morning, Modesto!

24
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,594
Channel #172.

25
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,814
You look gorgeous, sweetheart.

26
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,733
Thanks, Mom.

27
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,243
My little girl!

28
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,786
Daddy!

29
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,539
Now, I want you to know that, even
though I'm about to give you away...

30
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,627
I will always be here
to take care of you.

31
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,673
Don't cry because then you'll make me
cry, and that's just gonna be a mess.

32
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,383
I can't help it!

33
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,013
Hello, everyone!
Attention, attention!

34
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,474
Wedding starts in 30 minutes!

35
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,269
- My beautiful daughter-in-law!
- Hi, Mama Dietl.

36
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:33,690
It's like a fairy tale. The
Weatherman and the Weatherman's Wife.

37
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,608
Romantic.

38
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:40,863
I know. Just think, this time
tomorrow, I'm gonna be in Paris!

39
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,491
And someday, we won't just
be honeymooning there.

40
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,786
Derek will become an anchor
or a foreign correspondent.

41
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,707
- And we'll travel all over the world.
- Honey, my fingers are crossed.

42
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,422
One thumb is shorter than the
other. Runs in the family.

43
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,048
Derek doesn't have that.

44
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,968
It skips a generation. Your
kids are gonna have it!

45
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,646
Wow, you look beautiful.

46
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,150
So do you. I mean, handsome.

47
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,611
I mean... Sorry. I'm
just a little frazzled.

48
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,989
I just spent way too much
time with our parents.

49
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,743
Don't worry, OK? We'll
be alone soon, just us.

50
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,413
Eating cheese and
baguettes by the Seine,

51
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,874
feeding each other
chocolate crepes.

52
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:39,380
- Is something wrong? - No, no!
It's just that, well...

53
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,009
There's been a slight
change of plans.

54
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,720
We're not going to Paris.

55
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,391
- What? Why not? - Because
we're going somewhere better.

56
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,352
- Better than Paris?
- Oh, yeah.

57
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,645
Where? Tahiti?!

58
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,148
Nope! Fresno!

59
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,900
Fresno!

60
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,860
Fresno.

61
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,697
In what universe is Fresno
better than Paris, Derek?

62
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,867
In the "I've got an
audition to become."

63
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,245
"Channel #23's new evening
anchor" universe.

64
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,166
Got the call from the general manager,
he wants me to come in immediately!

65
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,628
- Isn't that great?
- Derek!

66
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,880
That's...

67
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,217
amazing! It's amazing.

68
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,594
Fresno's a top 50
market, isn't it?

69
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,971
It's 55th, but we're
on our way, babe!

70
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,558
Now, look. About Paris...

71
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,896
It's OK. It's fine! As
long as we're together,

72
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,691
Fresno is the most romantic
city in the whole world.

73
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,696
- I'm so proud of you.
- Of us! Not just of me.

74
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:50,326
I mean, of course, but we're a
team now. You're so proud of us.

75
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,288
Now, get out of here. It's bad
luck to see me in my dress.

76
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,833
Come on. You know I don't
believe in that stuff.

77
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,462
I'll be waiting for you at the altar...
the handsome news anchor in the tux.

78
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,798
Love you! There, I said it.

79
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,676
I love you, too.

80
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,502
Susan!

81
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,881
Where could she be?

82
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,176
Susan! Where are you?!

83
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,768
Susan! Where have you been?!

84
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,730
I think I just got
hit by a meteorite.

85
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:05,568
Oh, Susan. Every bride feels
that way on her wedding day.

86
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,864
My goodness, look at you. You're
filthy. Thank God I have Wet Ones.

87
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:47,944
Wow.

88
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,363
You're glowing.

89
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,449
Thank you.

90
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:57,870
No. No, Susan, you're, like,
really glowing. You're green!

91
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,999
Oh, no!

92
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,293
Derek!

93
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,799
Oh, my gosh!

94
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,217
What's going on?!

95
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,220
- What's happening?!
- You're all shrinking!

96
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,472
Uh-uh! You're growing!

97
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,267
- Well, make it stop!
- Get me the government!

98
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,478
This is impossible!

99
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,983
No, this can't be happening.

100
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,570
Wait, wait. Everybody, it's OK!

101
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:32,738
Have some champagne while
we're figuring this out!

102
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,324
Thumbs! Thumbs!

103
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,079
Derek! Help me!

104
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,584
Sweet Lord!

105
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:54,510
- Here comes the bride! - Oh,
Carl! It's her wedding day!

106
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,681
Derek? Derek?

107
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,309
Beam hurt Derek.

108
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,312
- Susan? - Thank
goodness you're OK!

109
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:06,897
What's happening to me?

110
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,068
Don't panic! Don't worry!
Whatever you do, don't drop...

111
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,572
- Derek!
- Sorry, sir.

112
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,283
Who are you people?
What are you doing?

113
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,703
Stop it! Be careful!

114
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,332
Get your hands off me!
Don't you know who I am?!

115
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,126
Please, just leave me alone!

116
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,138
Watch those cables!
She's coming down!

117
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,558
Watch out!

118
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,439
Move it, move it! Let's go!
Move it, move it!

119
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,483
Pull, pull!

120
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,070
Derek?

121
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,866
All right, let's get
this baby on the bus.

122
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,583
Honey, could you hit the snooze?

123
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,173
Baby, why did you set the alarm?
We're on our honeymoon.

124
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,181
Hello?

125
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,934
What's going on?

126
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,190
Hello?

127
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,252
Is it just legs? Did they
capture a giant pair of legs?

128
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,171
Silence, B.O.B.! She'll hear us!

129
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:39,008
- How? Legs don't have ears.
- Just shush!

130
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,137
Hello?

131
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,141
Is there someone there?

132
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,226
Could you tell me where I am?

133
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,453
Hello? What was that?

134
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,004
Hello.

135
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,383
Will you stop...?! Careful!

136
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,303
Please, madam!

137
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,555
Stop! Doing! That!

138
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:33,562
Whatever mad scientist made you,

139
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,232
he really went all out.

140
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,236
You can talk.

141
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,245
Hi, there!

142
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,997
My back!

143
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,542
Just kidding! I
don't have a back!

144
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:59,171
Forgive him, but as you
can see, he has no brain.

145
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,841
Turns out you don't need one.
Totally overrated!

146
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,009
As a matter of fact,
I don't even...

147
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,265
I forgot how to breathe!
Don't know how to breathe!

148
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,767
Help me, Dr. Cockroach! Help!

149
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,144
Suck in, B.O.B.

150
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,400
Thanks, Doc. You're a lifesaver.

151
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,444
Wow, look at you. I know
what you're thinking.

152
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,156
First day in prison, you want to take
down the toughest guy in the yard.

153
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,075
Well, I'd like to see you try.

154
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:33,956
Ninja!

155
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,549
- Gosh. Look, she's speechless.
- She?

156
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:48,470
Yes, B.O.B.! We are in the presence
of the rare female monster.

157
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:52,141
No way! It's a boy.
Look at his boobies.

158
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,059
We need to have a talk.

159
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,855
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we are not
making a very good first impression.

160
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,189
At least I'm talking.

161
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,484
First new monster in years, we
couldn't get a wolf man or a mummy?

162
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:05,070
Just, you know, somebody
to play cards with.

163
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,867
Might we ask your name, madam?

164
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,077
Susan.

165
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,496
No, no, no. We mean
your monster name.

166
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,416
Like, what do people scream
when they see you coming?

167
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,336
You know, like, "Look out!
Here comes...!"

168
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,796
Susan.

169
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,715
Really?

170
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,550
Susan!

171
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:29,345
I just scared myself.
That is scary.

172
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,221
Yes! Eat times.

173
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,355
That is repulsive!

174
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,316
An old slipper!

175
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:52,952
Oh, please, God, tell
me this isn't real.

176
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:56,121
Please tell me I had a nervous
breakdown at the wedding, and now I'm

177
00:15:56,206 --> 00:16:00,000
in a mental hospital on medication
that's giving me hallucinations.

178
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,553
Don't scare Insectosaurus!

179
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,348
He's gonna pee himself, then
we'll all be in trouble.

180
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,476
Every room has a door! There's
gotta be a door here!

181
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,813
It's OK, buddy. Don't
worry about it.

182
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,942
Who's a handsome bug, huh? You
like it when I rub your tummy?

183
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,989
Please! Somebody! I
don't belong here!

184
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,992
- Let me out! - Hey,
that is not a good idea.

185
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,744
Let me out!

186
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,509
Monsters, get back
in your cells.

187
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:15,826
Oh, thank goodness. A real person.
You are a real person, right?

188
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,662
Not one of those
half-person, half-machine,

189
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,206
you know, whatever you
call those things.

190
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,626
- A cyborg? - Oh, no!
You're a cyborg?!

191
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:29,423
Madam, I assure you, I am not a cyborg.
The name is General W.R. Monger.

192
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,593
I'm in charge of this facility.
Now, follow me.

193
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,012
It is time for your orientation.

194
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,318
In 1950, it was decided that Jane and
Joe Public could not handle the truth

195
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:53,697
about monsters, and should focus on more
important things, like paying taxes.

196
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,325
So the government
convinced the world

197
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,496
monsters were stuff of myth and legend
and then locked them in this facility.

198
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,878
But I'm not a monster! I'm
just a regular person.

199
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:11,173
I'm not a danger to
anyone or anything.

200
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,635
Don't let her get me!

201
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,178
Sorry.

202
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,438
- How long will I be here?
- Indefinitely.

203
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,315
- Can I contact my parents?
- No.

204
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,566
- Derek?
- Negative.

205
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,611
- Do they know where I am?
- No, and they never will!

206
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,863
This place is an X file,

207
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,408
wrapped in a cover-up and deep-fried
in a paranoid conspiracy.

208
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,912
There will be zero contact
with the outside world.

209
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,691
Seven, eight...

210
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,194
999...

211
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,363
1,000.

212
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,490
I can't believe I did ten sets.

213
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:29,877
Susan!

214
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,629
You wouldn't happen to
have any uranium on you?

215
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:34,089
I just need a smidge.

216
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,384
Rescind Dr. Cockroach's toy
box privileges immediately.

217
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:42,389
We had the prison psychologist
redecorate your cell.

218
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,849
Try to keep you all calm-like.

219
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,768
But I don't want a poster.

220
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:50,522
I want a real kitten
hanging from a real tree.

221
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,650
I want to go home.

222
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,404
Come on, little Debbie, please
don't cry. It makes my knees hurt.

223
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,114
Don't think of this as a prison.

224
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:04,119
Think of it as a hotel you never leave
because it's locked from the outside!

225
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,583
Oh, and one other thing.

226
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,502
The government has changed
your name to Ginormica.

227
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:06,306
Begin reanimation sequence.

228
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:15,148
Who dares to wake me?

229
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:21,238
Quantonium has been located on a
distant planet in the Omega Quadrant.

230
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:24,783
The Omega Quadrant? Lame.

231
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,287
The trajectory of the
Quantonium meteor

232
00:21:28,371 --> 00:21:32,541
has been traced to sector 72-4,

233
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:36,169
the planet locally
known as Earth.

234
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,673
What a miserable-looking
mud ball.

235
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,217
Send a robot probe!

236
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,932
Extract the Quantonium
with extreme prejudice.

237
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,893
I want it all.

238
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,896
Every last drop!

239
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,232
Yes, Gallaxhar.

240
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,820
Nothing can stand in my way now.

241
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,927
Don't rush me, Katie!
I'm just not ready.

242
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,806
Relax, Cuthbert. It's just
like dancing. I'll lead.

243
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:36,772
Katie, I have a gymnastics
meet tomorrow. So maybe...

244
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,565
Did you open the top?

245
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,194
Thank goodness. It's the police.

246
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,947
- We weren't doing anything,
officer! - Yeah, nothing at all.

247
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,162
Jiminy!

248
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:56,958
Why did I even let you talk me into
this?! Maybe we should get out of here.

249
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,587
- Or, maybe, we should go check
it out. - Katie, are you nuts?!

250
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,423
Wait! Don't leave me alone!

251
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,471
No! My ankle!

252
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,056
I think it's broken!

253
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,141
Katie?

254
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,229
This is the worst date ever.

255
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,782
Katie, I'm frightened.

256
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,462
It was first spotted at midnight last
night by a couple in romantic embrace.

257
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,924
No one knows what it is
or where it came from.

258
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,845
All branches of the military
were immediately mobilized.

259
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,179
What is that, Henshaw?

260
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:52,889
OK.

261
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:57,269
I have just received word that the
president of the United States

262
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:01,314
has arrived and will attempt
to make first contact.

263
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:03,525
I must approach it alone.

264
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,695
This is all about
peaceful communication.

265
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:08,989
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

266
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:45,400
Perimeter stable. Got a bead
on Papa Bear. All clear.

267
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,867
- Let's go! - Get
out of the way!

268
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,660
Set her down now. Here we go!

269
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,799
Commander, do something violent!

270
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,218
You heard the president!
Light 'em up!

271
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,814
We're getting pummeled here! Call in
air support! Call in air support!

272
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,922
Call in... Call in
a full retreat!

273
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,716
Full retreat! Full
retreat, all troops!

274
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:00,595
- Wheels up. Papa Bear
is on the move. - Wait.

275
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,433
So that's how you want to play
it? Eat lead, alien robot!

276
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,767
- Evidently, they eat lead.
- Get him on the chopper.

277
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,941
I'm brave! I'm a
brave president!

278
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:17,070
Get out of the way!

279
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,965
- Sir! We need to declare a...
- We need to overthrow that robot

280
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,677
- and install our own government!
- Let's sacrifice the elderly to it!

281
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,805
- I say we invade it! - The
Earth only has two weeks left!

282
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:47,851
If that thing walks into a populated
area there'll be a major catastrophe!

283
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:50,812
We need our top scientific minds
on this. Get India on the phone!

284
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,976
Can we transport the United
States to a safer planet?

285
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,317
Give this alien a green card and
make him proud to be an American.

286
00:28:56,402 --> 00:29:01,322
It's at dire times like this when I stop
and ask myself, "What would Oprah do?"

287
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:05,285
Hang it all! What's the point?
It's a disaster.

288
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,371
- Stop! No!
- Don't do it!

289
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,040
That button launches
our nuclear missiles!

290
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,001
Well, which button
gets me a latte?

291
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,962
That would be the
other one, sir.

292
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,969
- What idiot designed this
thing? - You did, sir.

293
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,307
- Fair enough. Wilson, fire somebody!
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

294
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,769
Listen up. I'm not going
to go down in history

295
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:32,729
as the president
who was in office

296
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,314
when the world came to an end,

297
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,150
so somebody think of something,
and think of it fast!

298
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,780
- That is a good cup of joe.
- Mr. President?

299
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:48,620
Not only do I have an
idea, but I have a plan!

300
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,002
Now, conventional weapons
have no effect on this thing,

301
00:29:56,086 --> 00:30:00,131
- and we know nukes ain't an
option. - Sure they are. I just...

302
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,759
- Don't do it! Stop!
- Wait!

303
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,971
I'm not gonna kid you,
Mr. President. These are dark times.

304
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:12,393
The odds are against us. We need a Hail
Mary pass. We need raw power! We need...

305
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,479
monsters.

306
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:20,401
Monsters! Of course!
It's so simple!

307
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,905
I... I'm not following you.

308
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,451
Over the last 50 years, I have
captured monsters on the rampage,

309
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,079
and locked them up in a
secret prison facility.

310
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:36,709
So secret that the mere mention
of its name is a federal offense.

311
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,336
Is he referring to Area Fifty...

312
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:45,218
Mr. President, say hello
to Insectosaurus!

313
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:49,055
Miss Ronson, please.

314
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:53,017
Nuclear radiation turned
him from a small grub

315
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:57,105
into a 350-foot-tall monster
that attacked Tokyo.

316
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,733
Here we have the Missing Link.

317
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:08,700
A 20,000-year-old frozen fish man
who was thawed out by scientists.

318
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,746
He escaped and went on a rampage
in his old watering hole.

319
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,292
This handsome fellow is
Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.,

320
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,502
the most brilliant
man in the world.

321
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,798
He invented a scientific machine

322
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:28,052
that would give humans the
cockroach's ability to survive.

323
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:30,722
Unfortunately, there
was a side effect.

324
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,811
Now, we call this thing B.O.B.

325
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,564
Will someone get
her out of here?!

326
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:42,984
Thank you.

327
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:47,405
A genetically altered tomato was
combined with a chemically altered

328
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,825
ranch-flavored dessert topping
at a snack food plant.

329
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,661
The resulting goop
gained consciousness,

330
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:57,248
and became an indestructible
gelatinous mass.

331
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:01,669
And, our latest
addition, Ginormica.

332
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,425
General, continue.

333
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,721
Her entire body radiates
with pure energy,

334
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,307
giving her enormous
strength and size.

335
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,771
Sir, these monsters are our best and
only chance to defeat that robot.

336
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,440
Don't we already have an
alien problem, General?

337
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,610
I don't think we need a
monster problem, too.

338
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,862
You got a better idea, nerd?

339
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,451
OK. Stay where you are.

340
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,038
General, I propose we go forward

341
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,458
with your monsters-versus-aliens
idea... thingy.

342
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,293
Go fish.

343
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,220
Do you...

344
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,722
have any...

345
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,225
threes?

346
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,603
Yes. I do! How are
you doing this?

347
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:04,065
- You're the luckiest guy I know.
- Luck ain't got nothin' to do with it.

348
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,360
What the...? Hey!

349
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:15,576
They called me crazy, but I'll
show them. I'll show them all!

350
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:21,749
Doctor, I'd prefer you didn't
do your mad scientist laugh

351
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,751
while I'm hooked up
to this machine.

352
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,714
You're right, Insecto.

353
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,467
You've let that quack experiment
on you for over a month.

354
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:35,722
I'm not a quack! I'm a mad
scientist! There is a difference.

355
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:40,935
Guys, what choice do I have? If he can
make me normal, or even six foot eight,

356
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,355
I can get out of here, get back
to the life I'm supposed to have.

357
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,733
- I should be in...
- Let me guess, Fresno?

358
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:50,528
Well, Fresno is just a stepping
stone. Next stop, Milwaukee.

359
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,948
- Then New York, then hopefully...
- Yeah, we know. Paris.

360
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,785
Throw the switch, Doctor,
but don't do the laugh.

361
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,289
Now you're going to feel a
slight pinch in the brain.

362
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:03,207
Sorry.

363
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:15,678
Susan!

364
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,723
Am I small again?

365
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,975
I'm afraid not, my dear.

366
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:29,150
In fact, you may actually
have grown a couple of feet.

367
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,656
That's OK, Doc. We'll
try again tomorrow.

368
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:40,912
You really don't get it, do you? No
monster has ever gotten out of here!

369
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,498
That's not true! The
Invisible Man did.

370
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:47,460
No, he didn't. We just told you
that so you wouldn't get upset.

371
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,546
He died of a heart
attack 25 years ago.

372
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:51,672
No!

373
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:54,509
Yeah... in that very chair.

374
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:57,136
He's still there.

375
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,851
You see what I'm saying? Nobody's
leaving. Nobody's ever getting out.

376
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:07,146
Good news, monsters!
You're getting out!

377
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:08,815
Until today.

378
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:16,114
So let me get this
straight, Monger.

379
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,825
You want us to fight
an alien robot.

380
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:22,161
And, in exchange, the president
of these United States

381
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,831
authorized me to grant
you your freedom.

382
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:29,127
I can't believe it! Soon, I'll
be back in Derek's arms...

383
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,045
or he'll be in mine.

384
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,132
I can't wait for spring break
back at Cocoa Beach, just

385
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,467
freaking everybody out.

386
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:40,429
And I'll go back to my lab and
finally finish my experiments.

387
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,056
No! That's me, B.O.B.

388
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,894
- Then I'll be a really giant
lady. - That's Susan, B.O.B.

389
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:51,149
Fine. Then I'll go back to
Modesto and be with Derek.

390
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,817
That's still Susan, B.O.B.

391
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,945
I think I, at least, deserve
a chance to be with Derek!

392
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,196
All right, let's go!

393
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,973
Everybody move in an orderly
fashion! This is an emergency!

394
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,017
We are evacuating the city!

395
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:29,103
Exact change is appreciated,
but not necessary!

396
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,593
Let's move out!

397
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,810
This is San Francisco! This
isn't far from my home!

398
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:13,940
Feel the wind on your antennae.
Isn't this wonderful?

399
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:17,860
I haven't been outside in 50
years. It's amazing out here!

400
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:20,988
It's hotter than I remember.
Has the Earth gotten warmer?

401
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,158
That'd be great to know. That
would be a very convenient truth.

402
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,000
- Now that's a robot!
- It's huge.

403
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,419
Try not to damage it too much.

404
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,672
I might want to bring
it back to the farm!

405
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,925
No, no, no, wait! You didn't say
anything about it being huge!

406
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,094
Wait! No! Don't leave!

407
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,724
I think he sees us.

408
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:52,353
Hello! Hi! How you doing?

409
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,856
Welcome! We are here
to destroy you!

410
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:59,360
I can't fight that thing. I
can't even... I've never...

411
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:03,531
I'm hyperventilating. Does
anybody have a giant paper bag?

412
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,616
Relax.

413
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,785
Old Link's got this
under control.

414
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,371
Hide in the city, Susan.
You'll be safe there.

415
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,541
But stay away from the
Tenderloin! It's a little dicey!

416
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,961
Finally, some action. I'm gonna
turn that oversized tin can

417
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:21,048
into a really dented
oversized tin can.

418
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:29,307
OK! Does anybody have a
20 on Insectosaurus?

419
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,810
Wow! Would you look at
the size of that...

420
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:33,936
Foot!

421
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,815
I got him, you guys! I got...

422
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,986
Don't worry, I won't let go!
I'm wearing him down!

423
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,739
Please tell me
he's slowing down!

424
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,867
Get to the city, Link. I'll catch
up with you as soon as I can.

425
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,415
Or maybe you'll have
to catch up with me.

426
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,920
Oh, no! No, no, no!

427
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,867
OK, OK. I got this.

428
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,048
Yep, that hurt.

429
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,053
Get in! I have a plan!

430
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,525
Hot dogs!

431
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:38,579
All right, Link, I'm going to pull up
alongside it! You get up in there,

432
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,165
get to its central
processing unit, and...

433
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,209
- Hey, guys, catch me!
- No!

434
00:41:50,383 --> 00:41:53,135
Let's go, let's go!
Keep it moving!

435
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,762
Hey! No honking!

436
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,562
Excuse me! Coming through!
On your right! No control!

437
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:23,958
Oh, no.

438
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,347
OK! It's going to be OK! Look,
I'm gonna get you out of there!

439
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,809
Hold on a second! We have to
get off the bridge before...

440
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,338
No, no, no! Get away from me!

441
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,274
Coming through! Watch it!

442
00:43:36,323 --> 00:43:38,824
Hey, furball, where you been?

443
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,288
Yeah, I know. Papa's a
little out of shape.

444
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:48,042
Excuse me! He's trying to kill me! Why
is it doing that? Why would it...

445
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,220
Wow.

446
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:21,408
- Wow. You're doing great!
- I'm doing everything!

447
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,828
Not for long. Come on, you guys.
Let's take this thing down!

448
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:30,417
A deflector shield. Typical.

449
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:41,220
You can't crush a cockroach!

450
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,065
Right, right.

451
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,775
Here we go.

452
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,489
Insectosaurus!

453
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,991
Insectosaurus!

454
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:04,702
- B.O.B.!
- What?

455
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,328
- Help me!
- Sorry.

456
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:10,457
- I was staring at this bird over there.
- Get these people off the bridge!

457
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,583
Got it.

458
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,630
No, B.O.B.! Move the dividers!

459
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,342
Oh, yeah, you're right. My bad.

460
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,182
Go, go, go, go!

461
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:40,696
Link!

462
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,490
Oh, I don't feel good.

463
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,163
OK. Susan, you can do this.

464
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,129
All right. Let's take
this thing down.

465
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,099
Retrieval has failed.

466
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:54,895
Don't get upset. It
happens to everyone.

467
00:46:55,897 --> 00:47:01,735
That lower life form thinks
she can steal my Quantonium?!

468
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,655
Send another probe at once!

469
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,616
Quantonium cannot be
retrieved via robot.

470
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:12,996
Carbon-based life form, locally
known as Susan, is now too strong.

471
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:17,835
Oh, you think because
you're all big and strong

472
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,004
and you can destroy
my robot probe

473
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,966
that you're gonna send
me running and hiding?!

474
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,345
My days of running
and hiding are over!

475
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,932
Computer, set a course to Earth.

476
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,228
I will retrieve the
Quantonium myself,

477
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,773
even if I need to rip
it out of her body

478
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,651
one cell at a time!

479
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:48,323
Careful, it's hot.

480
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:55,998
Three weeks ago, if you had asked
me to defeat a giant alien robot,

481
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,209
I'd have said, "No can
do." But I did it! Me!

482
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:00,878
I'm still buzzing.

483
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:04,923
Did you see how strong I was?! Probably
isn't a jar in this world I can't open.

484
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:08,302
You were positively
heroic, my dear.

485
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,263
I especially loved how you saved
those people on the bridge.

486
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,308
It was a nice touch.
Wasn't she amazing, Link?

487
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:17,811
Yeah, she was great.
Really cool. Loved it.

488
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:20,355
Oh, poor Link.

489
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:24,026
After all that tough talk, you
were out-monstered by a girl.

490
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:29,239
- No wonder you're depressed. - Hey,
I'm not depressed. I'm tired.

491
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:31,491
Why are you tired? You
didn't do anything.

492
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,493
Well, I haven't
been sleeping well.

493
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:38,290
I got sleep apnes... apnea.
Whatever. It's not fun.

494
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:42,169
So Link's a little rusty...
I mean, sleep deprived.

495
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,713
You'll be back to your
old self in no time.

496
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:45,839
And so will I.

497
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,552
What happened to the "there isn't a
jar in the world I can't open" stuff?

498
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:54,097
Wait. Did you find a jar you
couldn't open? Were pickles in it?

499
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:58,185
- Where's the giant jar of pickles?!
- What my associate is trying to say

500
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:02,814
is that we all think the new
Susan is the "cat's me-wow."

501
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,318
I'm sorry.

502
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,864
Thanks, you guys.
That is so sweet,

503
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:15,035
but I have a normal life
waiting for me. You know?

504
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,873
So, tell me, exactly, how this normal
life thing works with you being giant.

505
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,708
I'm not gonna be
a giant forever.

506
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:25,295
Derek won't rest until we've
found a cure for my...

507
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:28,382
condition. We're a team.

508
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:33,762
We could all do with a Derek. Perhaps,
someday, we could make his acquaintance!

509
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,224
Really? You guys
want to meet Derek?

510
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,317
First stop, Modesto!

511
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:51,071
Ginormica, I called your family to
let them know you were coming home.

512
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,992
Now, I also called the Modesto PD
and told them not to shoot at you.

513
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:57,828
Thanks, General.

514
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:12,551
OK, remember, these people
aren't used to seeing...

515
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,511
anything like...

516
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,597
you, or you...

517
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,141
or you.

518
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,270
So just be, you know, cool.
Just be... you know...

519
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,813
Follow my lead.

520
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,779
Stop! That was an accident!

521
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,948
Don't destroy anything!

522
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,286
Susan?

523
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:44,291
- Susie Q!
- Mom? Daddy?

524
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:51,131
- Did they experiment on you?
- No, Mom. I'm fine.

525
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:57,137
It's OK. They're with me.

526
00:50:57,305 --> 00:50:58,805
These are my new friends.

527
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,892
Oh, Derek! I missed you so much,

528
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,853
thinking that we'd someday
be together again!

529
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,732
It's the only thing that got me through
prison! I love you! I love this man!

530
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:12,027
No, B.O.B.! That's my mother!
You're suffocating her!

531
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,655
Honey, are you all right?

532
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,575
- I taste ham.
- Sorry, Mom.

533
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,410
He's just a hugger.

534
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:22,996
Where's Derek?

535
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,665
He's at work, sweetie.

536
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:28,794
You know how he is
about his career.

537
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,963
- We're not gonna celebrate
without him! - Susan!

538
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:35,258
What do I do with all
your little friends?

539
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:38,720
Just put out some snacks!
They'll eat anything!

540
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:42,849
Ambrosia!

541
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,437
How's it going?

542
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,815
Qué pasa, girlfriend?

543
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,234
Way to cut up a rug, Insecto!

544
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,864
Who wants to go for a
swim with the Link?

545
00:52:04,372 --> 00:52:07,791
Hi. I'm
Benzoate-Ostylezene-Bicarbonate.

546
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,044
Or you can call me "B.O.B.",
whichever's easier.

547
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,506
Did I come on too strong?
I'm sorry.

548
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,385
I'm a little rusty. I've been
in prison my whole life.

549
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,845
Why'd I mention prison?

550
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:24,015
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm just going to go.

551
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:25,475
I feel so stupid.

552
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:31,106
All right, everyone, just stay calm.
Whatever you do, do not provoke them.

553
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,860
Anyone care for an Atomic Gin
Fizz? It's got quite a...

554
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,405
kick.

555
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,576
Chlorine! Chlorine in my eyes!

556
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:48,290
- They're turning on us!
- Everyone run for your lives!

557
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,880
What are they running away from?

558
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,385
That's hilarious, Jim.

559
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,680
That's exactly the kind of
down-home country humor

560
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,515
I'm gonna miss when
I'm in Fresno.

561
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,769
This is Derek Dietl, signing
off for the very last time.

562
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:14,274
- Good night, Modesto!
- Channel #172.

563
00:53:15,151 --> 00:53:16,610
And cut.

564
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:22,115
Did you like that sign off?
Just made it up.

565
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,457
Oh, my goodness.

566
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:33,585
Wait, wait, wait! But, but...!

567
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:41,301
Oh, Derek. You wouldn't
believe my last three weeks!

568
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:48,099
Thinking about you was the
only thing that kept me sane.

569
00:53:48,935 --> 00:53:53,480
- Can't breathe! Ribs collapsing!
- Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!

570
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:56,524
Oh, my goodness. Is that better?

571
00:53:57,526 --> 00:53:59,653
OK. OK.

572
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,406
I'm still kind of getting
used to my new strength.

573
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:06,076
Wow! You really are big!

574
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:11,331
Yeah, but I'm still me. I'm still the
same girl you fell in love with.

575
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,834
Except you did just destroy
the Golden Gate Bridge.

576
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:18,004
But that was the only way I
could stop that giant robot!

577
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:20,799
You ever think I could
do something like that?

578
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:25,220
No, I didn't. I can honestly say
it never, ever, ever, ever,

579
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:29,015
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever occurred to me.

580
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,769
Look, I know this
is a little weird.

581
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:36,815
OK, it's a lot weird, but
we'll figure it out.

582
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:40,944
I know that, together, we can find
a way to get me back to normal.

583
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:44,864
Susan, try and look at
this from my perspective.

584
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,951
I have an audience that
depends on me for news,

585
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:51,288
weather, sports and
heart-warming fluff pieces.

586
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,873
You expect me to put
all that on hold

587
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,710
while you try to undo this
thing that happened to you?

588
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:59,087
That I had absolutely
nothing to do with?

589
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:02,424
Yes. That's exactly
what I expect.

590
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:07,262
What about the life we always talked
about? Don't you still want that?

591
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,556
Of course. I just...

592
00:55:10,558 --> 00:55:13,101
don't see how I can
have that with you.

593
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:17,147
Derek, please, don't do this.

594
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,858
You have to face facts, Susan.

595
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,862
Don't crush me for saying this, but
I'm not looking to get married

596
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,948
and spend the rest of my life
in someone else's shadow.

597
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,328
And you're casting a
pretty big shadow.

598
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:33,913
I'm sorry. It's over.

599
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,208
Good luck, Susan.

600
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:27,592
Wow! What a shindig!

601
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,970
Your parents really know
how to throw it down.

602
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:34,140
What? No, that was
a great party,

603
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,976
one of the best I've been to
since I got out of prison.

604
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,437
I must have been at
a different party,

605
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:42,148
'cause that's not how I
interpreted it at all.

606
00:56:42,483 --> 00:56:46,653
I don't think your parents liked me, and
that JELL-O gave me a fake phone number.

607
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,657
Well, at least the garbage was
free. You know? I mean...

608
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,661
Ah, who are we kidding? We could
save every city on the planet,

609
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,289
and they'd still treat us the same
way they've always treated us...

610
00:56:58,374 --> 00:56:59,999
like monsters.

611
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:04,295
Right. Monsters.

612
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,050
Anyway, how is Derek?

613
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,766
Derek is a selfish jerk.

614
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:18,351
- No!
- Yes.

615
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:22,522
All that talk about "us."
"I'm so proud of us."

616
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,733
"Us just got a job in
Fresno." There's no "us."

617
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:30,655
There was only Derek. Why did I have
to get hit by a meteor to see that?

618
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:32,866
I was such an idiot!

619
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:38,496
Why did I ever think life with
Derek would be so great, anyway?

620
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,666
I mean, look at all the stuff
I've done without him.

621
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,670
Fighting an alien robot?
That was me, not him.

622
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:50,884
And that was amazing!
Meeting you guys? Amazing.

623
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,137
Dr. Cockroach, you
can crawl up walls

624
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:58,725
and build a supercomputer out of a pizza
box, two cans of hairspray, and...

625
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,060
- A paper clip!
- Amazing!

626
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:04,564
And you! You hardly need an
introduction. You're the Missing Link!

627
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,567
You personally carried 250
co-eds off of Cocoa Beach,

628
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:09,903
and still had strength to
fight off the National Guard!

629
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,739
And the Coast Guard and,
also, the lifeguard.

630
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:13,907
Amazing!

631
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,534
B.O.B.! Who else could fall

632
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,787
from unimaginable heights and end
up without a single scratch?

633
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:21,831
- Link?
- You.

634
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:22,999
Amazing!

635
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:29,797
Good point, Insecto! Susan,
don't short-change yourself!

636
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:33,885
Oh, I'm not going to
short-change myself ever again!

637
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,346
- Testify!
- Yeah.

638
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,639
Oh, yes.

639
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,021
Susan!

640
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:54,405
Way to go, Insecto!

641
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,460
Insecto, look out!

642
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:16,427
Insectosaurus! No!

643
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:25,478
You're gonna make it.

644
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,399
It's going to be all right.
Look at me.

645
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:33,111
Don't you close those eyes. Don't
you dare close those eyes.

646
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,822
You can't...

647
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,155
You must be terrified.

648
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:22,076
You wake up in a strange place,
wearing strange clothes,

649
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:27,290
imprisoned by a strange being floating
on a strange hovering device.

650
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,208
Strange, isn't it?

651
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:32,045
Hardly. It's not the first time.

652
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,714
Wow. You really get around.

653
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,675
To the extraction chamber!

654
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,762
Look. What is it that
you want from me?

655
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,557
You have stolen what
is rightfully mine!

656
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:46,476
I didn't steal
anything from you.

657
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,730
Your enormous, grotesque
body contains Quantonium,

658
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,941
the most powerful substance
in the universe.

659
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:57,487
Did you really think you
could keep it from me?

660
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:00,490
That's what this is all about?

661
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:05,328
You destroyed San Francisco, you
terrified millions of people...

662
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:08,081
you killed my friend,
just to get to me?

663
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,961
Silence! Your voice is
grating on my ear nubs.

664
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,676
It's a shame you won't be around to
see what the power of Quantonium

665
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,931
can do in the tentacles of
someone who knows how to use it!

666
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,433
I know how to use it just fine!

667
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:32,563
Don't bother. That force
field is impenetrab...

668
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,108
What the Flagnard?!

669
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:50,248
That should stop your puny...

670
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,959
Computer, close
door, hangar two!

671
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,503
Close door, hangar three!

672
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:57,797
Door, hangar four!

673
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,758
Close them all!

674
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,140
Computer, begin extraction!

675
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:36,562
Finally, I can rebuild my
civilization on a new planet.

676
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:40,316
Any thoughts on where
I should set up shop?

677
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,443
Your planet, perhaps?

678
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:45,112
You keep your slimy
tentacles off my planet!

679
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,907
If you wanted to stop me,
you should have done it

680
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,992
when you possessed
the Quantonium!

681
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:51,911
Now you're nothing.

682
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:55,915
There are innocent people down
there who didn't do anything!

683
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:01,963
There were innocent people on my
home planet before it was destroyed.

684
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:05,174
- I'm sorry your planet was
destroyed. - Oh, don't be.

685
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:08,094
I'm the one who destroyed it.
Confused?

686
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:15,184
After I reveal my tale to you,
everything will become crystal clear.

687
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,896
Computer, initialize
cloning machine.

688
01:04:18,981 --> 01:04:20,439
Yes, Gallaxhar.

689
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,653
Many zentons ago, when
I was but a squidling,

690
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,155
I found out my parents were...

691
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,245
No child should ever
have to endure that!

692
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,622
So I went on the
road with a giant...

693
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:41,294
And soon thereafter was married!

694
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,589
Things were going well,
until she wanted to...

695
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:50,720
And then I was all, "No way!", and she
was all, "Yes, way," and I was like...

696
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:55,641
But I've told you
too much already!

697
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,689
Let the birth of my new
planet, now called...

698
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:05,985
"Gallaxhar's Planet" begin!

699
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,848
Once again, a UFO has
landed in America,

700
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:39,060
the only country UFO's
ever seem to land in.

701
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:41,771
Excuse me. What's that, Henshaw?

702
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,607
Okey-dokey.

703
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:51,322
We now take you, live, to a
transmission from the alien spacecraft.

704
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:57,036
Humans of Earth, I
have come in peace.

705
01:05:57,537 --> 01:06:02,041
You need not fear me.
I mean you no harm.

706
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:07,421
However, it is important to note most of
you will not survive the next 24 hours.

707
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,634
And those who do survive will be
enslaved and experimented on.

708
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,845
You should in no way take
any of this personally.

709
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:19,392
It's just business.
So just to recap:

710
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:24,063
I come in peace, I mean you no harm
and you all will die. Gallaxhar out.

711
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,404
OK, boys, set the terror level

712
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:34,365
at code brown 'cause I
need to change my pants.

713
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,090
- What're we gonna do now, Doc?
- I...

714
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:53,676
I don't know.

715
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:59,473
I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We're
not gonna let Insecto die in vain.

716
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:05,479
We're gonna get up there, find Susan,
and we're gonna take that alien down!

717
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:14,155
All right, you got enough juice in
those jetpacks to get up there,

718
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:15,781
but not enough to make it home.

719
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:21,412
I'll come get you if I can. If I
don't, it means I'm dead. Or late.

720
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,708
I've been your warden
for close to 50 years.

721
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:27,960
That's no longer the case.

722
01:07:28,879 --> 01:07:30,129
For what it's worth...

723
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:35,760
- That's rude. What did we do?
- No, B.O.B., that's not rude.

724
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,054
That's a sign of respect.

725
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,482
General, it's targeting us!

726
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:52,276
That's the idea, Lieutenant.
Hold your course.

727
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:53,986
Steady.

728
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,322
Steady.

729
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:58,824
Hard right! Hard right!

730
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,662
I can't shake it!

731
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:10,002
Hang on to your socks!
We're going for a ride!

732
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:25,101
That's why I always wear
a parachute, Lieutenant.

733
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,815
You can let go of
me now, Lieutenant.

734
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,225
Who are you signaling?
We're right here.

735
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:07,393
Hey, zip it!

736
01:09:15,277 --> 01:09:16,360
Clone!

737
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:20,698
- Hail Gallaxhar! - No, not
all of you. You, there.

738
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:23,701
How do I do this? Three back.

739
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:27,246
No, no, no, no. That guy next to
you. The one I'm pointing at!

740
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,414
You! The one...

741
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:32,168
You, clone! Yes! Good!

742
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,338
Take the prisoner
to the incinerator.

743
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:38,757
She's useless to us now.

744
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,510
- Hail Gallaxhar.
- Hail me.

745
01:09:56,151 --> 01:10:00,529
Wow. Ginormica ain't so...
"ginormic" anymore.

746
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:02,448
How are we supposed
to get to her?

747
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:05,326
There's too many of them.
It's impossible.

748
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:14,418
I may not have a brain,
gentlemen, but I have an idea.

749
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:22,426
This is not going to work.

750
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:36,899
Halt!

751
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:46,992
I... Gallaxhar, command you to hand
over the prisoner this instant.

752
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,537
Clearly, you are
defective beyond repair.

753
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:53,749
Guards, take this defective
clone to the incinerator!

754
01:10:57,379 --> 01:11:00,256
Well, what are you waiting for?
You and you!

755
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,260
- Seriously? - Yes!
Take the prisoner

756
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:07,846
and the defective clone
to the incinerator!

757
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:12,309
- Of course, sir. - Here's a
security pass, just in case.

758
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,021
- Would you like a gun?
- Yes, I would.

759
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:17,690
Hey, guys, look.

760
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:22,820
OK.

761
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,866
I can't believe you guys
came to save me. Thank you.

762
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:31,161
Don't mention it. We monsters
got to stick together.

763
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:35,291
But I'm not a monster anymore.
I'm just me.

764
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:39,211
My dear, no matter what your
size, you'll always be...

765
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:43,215
nothing but a filthy,
carbon-based life form!

766
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,175
Hail Gallaxhar!

767
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:46,885
Hail Gallaxhar.

768
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:53,183
These disguises are the bomb!

769
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:55,936
That's it! Follow me.

770
01:11:57,022 --> 01:11:59,189
- The only way to save the
Earth... - Hail Gallaxhar!

771
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:00,607
Hail Gallaxhar. The only way...

772
01:12:00,734 --> 01:12:02,359
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- Hail Gallaxhar.

773
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:05,029
To save the Earth is to
blow up this ship...

774
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:07,239
- Hail Gallaxhar!
- Hail Gallaxhar.

775
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:10,326
- ...before the invasion starts.
- How are we gonna do this?

776
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,911
We need to find the
main power core.

777
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:16,373
Excuse me, could you direct
us to the main power core?

778
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:19,418
Gladly. It's right there,
above the extraction chamber.

779
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,557
Thank you very much.
Hail Gallaxhar.

780
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,059
- Watch out! - Look
out, brainless!

781
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:37,644
Give me that thing!

782
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:41,106
A weapon like this needs to be in
the hands of someone responsible.

783
01:12:43,068 --> 01:12:44,526
What?!

784
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,738
Hail Gallaxhar?

785
01:12:48,448 --> 01:12:49,782
Monsters!

786
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,493
- Monsters.
- Monsters?!

787
01:12:53,787 --> 01:12:57,915
Attention, all aliens!
Destroy all monsters!

788
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:01,210
You want some of this?!

789
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:03,128
Ninja!

790
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:10,677
You want to hurt my friends,
you'll have to go through me!

791
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:14,473
Oh, yeah.

792
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:37,413
Susan!

793
01:13:44,504 --> 01:13:45,921
I can't believe we made it!

794
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:07,693
O... M... G.

795
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:10,654
Warning: Intruder.

796
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:15,284
You'll never figure
out my color code.

797
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:19,204
A hexadecimal color code system.

798
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,206
This won't be but a moment.

799
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:25,461
Red, green, blue, yellow,
orange, baby blue,

800
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:29,214
purple, pink, mauve, gold, brown,
mocha, avocado, adobe gold!

801
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:38,223
Doc, come on, dance!

802
01:14:39,017 --> 01:14:43,562
Your busted, tired dance moves are
no match for my security protocols.

803
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:47,983
- We can't hold them off much longer!
- One thing you don't know about me!

804
01:14:48,693 --> 01:14:51,570
My Ph.D... Is in...

805
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,240
dance! Dance! Dance!

806
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:58,243
Security protocol breached.

807
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,914
Ship has been set
to self-destruct.

808
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:06,627
Total annihilation in
T-minus six minutes.

809
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:11,089
- Well, launch the invasion then!
- Invasion no longer possible.

810
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,550
Oh, space balls!

811
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:18,055
Divert the Quantonium to the bridge,
and prepare my escape capsule!

812
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,073
Look at that! They're all
running scared! Monsters win!

813
01:15:36,616 --> 01:15:38,784
I don't think that's
why they're running.

814
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:43,372
Ship will self-destruct
in T-minus five minutes.

815
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:47,793
Hail Gallaxhar!

816
01:15:48,628 --> 01:15:50,045
We're not gonna make it!

817
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:58,804
Hang on!

818
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:06,979
Keep going!

819
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:18,991
It's no use. It won't budge.

820
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:22,286
If I was still Ginormica,
I could do this!

821
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,663
Get out of here while you
still got the chance!

822
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:28,417
No! Don't say that. I'm
not leaving you guys.

823
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:30,919
Yes, you are.
Rendezvous with Monger.

824
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:34,923
He's outside the ship, waiting for
you. Go while there's still time.

825
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:40,053
Ship will self-destruct
in T-minus four minutes.

826
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:41,847
Don't you worry about us, Susan.

827
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,558
You finally have a chance
to get your old life back.

828
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,311
I don't want my old life back.

829
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,404
They think they've stopped me?!

830
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,698
They've stopped nothing.

831
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:04,077
Female carbon-based life form,
or Susan, not contained.

832
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,370
What?!

833
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:16,423
Attention, robot probes!
Crush the earthling!

834
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,704
Robot bay has been destroyed.

835
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,666
Fire phasoid cannon!

836
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:16,483
Are you crazy?! You
could have killed me!

837
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:18,527
Then we understand each other.

838
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:21,988
Now, open the doors and
let my friends go.

839
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:23,365
Or what?

840
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:27,077
You don't actually think
you're a match for me, do you?

841
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:33,667
Quantonium has been successfully
diverted to the bridge.

842
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,878
Escape capsule ready
for transport.

843
01:18:36,963 --> 01:18:40,215
Like I told you before, you
should have defeated me

844
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,467
when you had the Quantonium.

845
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,387
Have fun exploding!

846
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:15,584
- Now open the doors. - Even
if I wanted to, I couldn't!

847
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,795
That's what happens when you
set a ship to self-destruct!

848
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,006
Now we're all going to die!

849
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,551
And there's nothing you
can do about it, Susan!

850
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,430
I wouldn't be so sure.

851
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:31,141
And the name is Ginormica.

852
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:48,533
Total annihilation in
T-minus one minute.

853
01:19:48,618 --> 01:19:51,870
- It's been an honor knowing you,
Doc. - The feeling's mutual.

854
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,748
I'll see you guys
tomorrow for lunch.

855
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:56,041
That's right, B.O.B.

856
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,044
And there'll be candy
and cake and balloons.

857
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:04,382
Cake and balloons for lunch?! It's gonna
be the best day ever! I love you guys!

858
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,648
By Hawking's chair!

859
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:43,547
Total annihilation in
T-minus 30 seconds.

860
01:20:45,675 --> 01:20:48,593
- Where's Monger?! - He's
supposed to be here!

861
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,430
He said the only reason he wouldn't
be here is if he was dead!

862
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,185
Or late!

863
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:04,109
Insectosaurus?! You're alive!

864
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:07,612
And you're a... butterfly!

865
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,535
Eight...

866
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,161
seven...

867
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:16,788
six...

868
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,623
five...

869
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,417
four...

870
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,795
- ...three... two...
- Come on, come on!

871
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:25,255
One.

872
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,510
Nothing happened.
Maybe my count was...

873
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,977
There they are!

874
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:41,438
Here they come!

875
01:21:56,621 --> 01:21:57,662
Yeah!

876
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:00,957
Oh, great.

877
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:05,879
Oh, boy.

878
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:09,841
- Susie Q!
- Daddy!

879
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:14,804
Oh, Susan. Ever since you were
a baby, I knew that someday...

880
01:22:14,889 --> 01:22:19,225
you would, you know, save the Earth
from an invasion from outer space.

881
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:22,187
Thank you, but it
wasn't just me, Mom.

882
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,023
Excuse me! Hello! Coming
through! How are you?

883
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,984
- Susan!
- Derek?

884
01:22:28,069 --> 01:22:31,404
Baby, I thought long and hard
about what happened between us.

885
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,114
And I want you to know...

886
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,158
I forgive you.

887
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:37,661
You forgive me?

888
01:22:37,745 --> 01:22:41,748
Of course. It wasn't your fault you got
hit by a meteor and ruined everything.

889
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:42,916
And you know what?

890
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:47,253
I say maybe you didn't ruin everything.
I just got a call from New York.

891
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:50,465
They offered me network.

892
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,551
All I have to do is get an
exclusive interview from you.

893
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,637
- Really?
- Yeah.

894
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:58,723
I get my dream job and
you get your dream guy.

895
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,559
It's a win-win for Team Dietl.

896
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:03,895
Derek...

897
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,439
that's amazing.

898
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:10,318
- Is the camera rolling?
- Absolutely.

899
01:23:11,988 --> 01:23:14,906
Good. Because I wouldn't
want your fans to miss this.

900
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,159
This is Susan Murphy, saying,

901
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:21,579
"Goodbye, Derek!"

902
01:23:25,418 --> 01:23:26,459
B.O.B., could you...?

903
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,927
Derek, you are a selfish
jerk, and guess what?

904
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:38,805
I've met someone else.
She's lime green.

905
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:42,017
She has 14 little chunks
of pineapple inside her,

906
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:45,353
and she's everything
I deserve in life!

907
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:48,023
I'm happy now,
Derek, without you!

908
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:49,941
It's over!

909
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:53,278
Turn it off.

910
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:56,114
Monsters, I'm so proud
of you, I could cry,

911
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:58,658
if I hadn't lost my
tear ducts in the war.

912
01:23:58,743 --> 01:24:02,120
But not crying will have to wait.
The world needs you again.

913
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:03,913
What is it, General?

914
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:07,042
Seems a snail fell into a
French nuclear reactor.

915
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:10,462
As we speak, Escargantua

916
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:14,132
is slowly making
its way to Paris.

917
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:19,220
Well, I've always wanted to go
to Paris. Now who's with me?

918
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:22,015
What do you say, Butterfly...
osaurus?

919
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:25,143
We're in.

920
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,395
- I'm in!
- Count me in, too.

921
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,986
Au revoir, sweetie!

922
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:38,823
- Have a safe flight!
- Yeah, and hang on!

923
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:55,173
Goodbye, Derek! Good
luck getting over me.

924
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:59,135
B.O.B., it's me he's
never going to get over.

925
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:02,555
Wait, wait! You were
dating Derek too?!

926
01:25:03,849 --> 01:25:05,475
That two-timing jerk!

927
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:41,362
Everyone, let's welcome my new
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

928
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:43,656
General W.R. Monger!

929
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:48,161
Thank you, Mr. President. What a great
way to celebrate my 90th birthday.

930
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:50,121
Very good, Warren. All right.

931
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:53,249
Let's get it started
in here Nerd?

932
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:57,253
Gentlemen, I have assembled a
preliminary budget estimate

933
01:26:57,338 --> 01:26:59,464
for the rebuilding
of San Francisco.

934
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:01,716
Zoinkers. This is going
to be a boring one.

935
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:05,553
Good time for a cup of joe.
Warren, how do you take it?

936
01:27:05,638 --> 01:27:08,431
Hit me with a double venti
organic chocolate brownie

937
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,517
caramel Frappuccino, extra
hot, with one inch of foam...

938
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,604
- ...non-fat. - You got it!
Black it is.

939
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,772
Don't do it!

940
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:16,898
Wait!

941
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,901
My God, man! What
have you done?!

942
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:23,738
Time to wave the white flag
and head for the bunker.

943
01:27:23,948 --> 01:27:26,324
Let's check on the
situation in 500 years.

944
01:27:26,617 --> 01:27:27,951
Who wants to freeze my head?
