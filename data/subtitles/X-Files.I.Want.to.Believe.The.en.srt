SCULLY: The deficiency in lipid metabolism

28

33
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,710
And you tested his Iysosome function?

34
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,879
I think you have
all my results there, Doctor.

35
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,508
My fear is that it's a type-two
degenerative brain disease

36
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,718
like Sandhoff disease,

37
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,430
that his enzymes aren't clearing
the lipids from his brain, causing atrophy.

38
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,560
If you suspect Sandhoff disease,
I'd test the boy's IeveIs of hexosaminidase.

39
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:16,690
I've done that. What I'm looking for here,
Doctor, is a course of treatment.

40
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,901
There is no treatment for Sandhoff.

41
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,238

to speak with Fox Mulder.

I don't work with the FBI.

MULDER: What's up, Doc?

55
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,199
You've become awfully trusting, Mulder.

56
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,660
For a man wanted by the FBI.

57
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,204

"Auf einer WeIIenIänge,"
as the Germans say.

59
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,794
It's a precognitive state often confused
with simple human intuition,

60
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,713
in which the brain perceives the deep logic

61
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,341
underlying transitory human existence,
unaided by the conscious mind,

62
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,844
materializing much as you did just now.

63
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,974
Though, if you'd actually materialized,
you'd be rapidly dematerializing.

64
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,019

65

Well, I hope you told them
to go screw themselves.

69
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,619
They say all is forgiven.

70
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,163
That they'll drop all charges against you

71
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,123
if you come in
and help them solve this case.

72
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,666
The FBI will forgive me?

73
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,045
They put me on trial on bogus charges
and tried to discredit

74
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,298
a decade of my work. They should
be asking me for my forgiveness, Scully.

75
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,675
I think they are. Desperately.

76
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,678

77

Oh.

80
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,315
It's a trick, Scully, to smoke me out.

81
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,194
Mulder, if the FBI wanted to get you,
I have no doubt that they could.

to have you out of their hair.

Almost three days.

113
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,321
I know you know this, but after 72 hours,

114
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,989
there's slim chance that she's still alive.

115
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,866
We have slim reason to believe she is.

116

But so far,
we've got no evidence to the contrary,

117
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,537
and the facts give us hope.

118
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,125
Soon after she goes missing,
we find this, a severed arm.

119
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,338
-Where?
-About 1 0 miles from her home.

120
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,757
I don't understand. It's a man's arm.

121
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:25,011
It's a match for evidence found at
or near the crime scene. Blood or tissue?

122
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,389
Blood. Found in her garage
and on the tool that matches the wound.

123
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,643
-I take it you were led to it.
-Like a needle in a haystack.

-He was a priest?
-Catholic.

130

-That's right.

-No. That's why I sent for you.

140

There's a question of credibility.

141
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,900
If you have no reason to doubt the man,
why doubt the man's visions?

142
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,069
He didn't lead us to Monica Bannan.

143
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,029
He gave us a guy's bloody arm
in the snow.

144

This is not an exact science.

No, this is a serial case
you've uncovered here.

515
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,157
You're gonna solve a dozen murders here.

516
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,534
Yes, but I'm no closer to finding my agent.

517
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,828
No, we're gonna find her. I know it.

518
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,497
Well, she may have to stand in line.

519
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,583
I see a woman's face.

520
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,711
Another woman. Taken from a car.

521
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:01,132
She's being held in a box, I think.

522
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,011
Is she with Monica Bannan?

523
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,223
-I don't know.
-Is it the same men that took her?

524
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:14,854
I think so. Yes. It's the same men.

525
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,193
You see this, or are you just telling
these people what they want to hear?

526
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,945
-No!
-No, you don't see it?

527
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,201
No, it's the same men.

528
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,332
I want a car ready.

529
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,292
-To go where?
-I don't know yet.

530
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,503
-I don't believe this.
-That's been your problem from the start.

531
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,547
I can get you a car.

532
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,591
And a list of missing persons
in the greater area

533
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,509
over the last 48 to 72 hours.

534
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,995
-WHITNEY: Hi.
-Hi, how's it going?

535
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,463
Cheryl Cunningham, 34,
never made it to work last night.

536
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:24,257
No show at home, either.

537
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,928
There's no blood on the airbags.
Driver's side window knocked out.

538
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,390
Keys in the ignition.
Survivable crash with a seatbelt.

539
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:38,104
She sets off, takes a shortcut,
gets tired, sits down, falls asleep.

540
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,774
-Happens all the time.
-Pretty hard left turn for such a long,

541
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,901
straight stretch of country road,
don't you think?

542
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,071
But why settle for my opinion?

543
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,099
I'm sorry. I'm not getting anything.

544
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:19,103
What a surprise. What a surprise.

545
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,781
-I think we're done with Father Joe.
-Yeah.

546
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,742
MULDER: Whoa, whoa.

547
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,833
-We're not quite finished.
-What is that?

548
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:44,503
It's a medical ID bracelet. I noticed
your missing agent wore one, too.

549
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,671
-For what?
-What are you thinking?

550
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,340
Let's pop the trunk.

551
00:48:50,635 --> 00:48:53,471
-This isn't gonna do her much good.
-Here's a gym bag.

552
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,975
It's a bathing suit. It's frozen stiff.

553
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,813
-Chlorine.
-Where's the nearest public pool?

554
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,287
Hi. We're hoping you can help us.

555
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,873
-Would you all like lockers?
-No, we're with the FBI.

556
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:23,000
We'd like to show you a photo, sir,
if you don't mind.

557
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,627
Why would I mind?

558
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,255
-Do you know this person?
-Let me see.

559
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,301
These young people
look so much the same.

560
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:35,554
-WHITNEY: You have a sign-in register?
-Yes, I keep one every day.

561
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,099
-I'd like to see yesterday's.
-I threw yesterday's away.

562
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:44,772
Excuse me, sir. Doesn't he know
that's the woman's side?

563
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,780
Hi, Christian.

564
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:58,452
You've got a whole bunch of people taking
really good care of you today, okay?

565
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,081
What?

566
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,667
Now you look scared.

567
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,006
(SAW WHIRRING)

568
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,334
People say I went underground.

569
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,755
I'm sorry, Mulder.

570
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,845
I've had to keep my focus here.

571
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,764
It's the boy, isn't it?

572
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,766
Yeah.

573
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,103
I thought there was nothing to be done.

574
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,814
I'm taking a big chance on something,

575
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:36,151
on a radical
and extremely painful new procedure.

576
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:38,487
Last night you said that wasn't an option.

577
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,699
It wasn't, last night.

578
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,909
What changed your mind?

579
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,500
(SIGHING)

580
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,339
When will you know if it's working?

581
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:02,261
There's a series of these procedures,
and we won't know until they're all done.

582
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,685
But that's not what
you came to talk about.

583
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,021
There's another woman missing.

584
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,774
She's given us something to go on.

585
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,569
She and the missing agent
swam at the same pool.

586
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,195
We found that the agent kept
a locker there.

587
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,363
We think they were stalked there.

588
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,449
Both women wore a medical ID bracelet,

589
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,243
and they both had the same
rare blood type, AB negative.

590
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,456
Organs harvested for transplant.
That's how they were targeted.

591
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,083
Donors and recipients need
matched types.

592
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,044
Someone using that pool knows that.

593
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,338
Black market. Somebody filling orders.

594
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,507
Well, they have access.
Recipients, hospitals...

595
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,592
That's your world, Scully.

596
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,094
Your knowledge of it will save time,
and time is our enemy.

597
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,889
You can start with the transporters.
Call the Richmond DA.

598
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,683
No, no, no, I need you on this with me.

599
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,188
No. No, Mulder.

600
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,315
Yeah, yeah. You asked for me
to get involved, Scully.

601
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,025
Now I'm asking for you to stay involved.

602
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,610
Oh, Mulder.

603
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:02,529
You helped them already.
You broke the case for them.

604
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,573
Why don't you just let the FBI pursue it?

605
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:05,908
We're so close now.

606
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:09,078
-And I'm asking you to let it go.
-It's not that simple.

607
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,955
(SOFTLY) No. It's complicated.

608
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,457
What's that supposed to mean?

609
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,378
Something that I knew would happen,
that I've been afraid of,

610
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,797
that I haven't had to face until now.

611
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,883
What? Just say it.

612
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,429
I'm a doctor, Mulder.

613
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,266
-That's not my life anymore.
-I know that.

614
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,269
You're not understanding me.

615
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,440
I can't look into the darkness
with you anymore, Mulder.

616
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,443
I cannot stand what it does to you,
or to me.

617
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:45,614
I'm fine with it, Scully.
I'm actually okay. I'm good.

618
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:47,199
Yeah, that's what scares me.

619
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:51,036
Where else would you have me look
if you want me to find these women alive?

620
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,957
I'm asking you to look at yourself.

621
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,460
Why?

622
00:54:59,003 --> 00:55:01,130
I don't think I'm the one who's changed.

623
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,216
We're not FBI anymore, Mulder.

624
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,637
We are two people
who come home at night,

625
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:10,472
to a home now.

626
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,642
I don't want that darkness in my home.

627
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:16,812
Scully, this is who I am.

628
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:20,524
It's who I've always been.
This is who I was before I met you.

629
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,818
It's what I do. It's everything I know.

630
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:26,363
Write it down. Put it in a book.

631
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,658
Are you asking me to give up?

632
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,202
No.

633
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,165
I can't tell you to do that, Mulder.

634
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:43,755
But I can tell you that
I won't be coming home.

635
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,008
Scully.

00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:50,804
Mulder, I've got my own battles to fight.

638
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,307
-Don't do this.
-Please don't argue with me.

639
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,267
Don't do this now.

640
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,938
I don't know what else to do.

641
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,379
Well, good luck, then.

642

MRS. FEARON: Dr. Scully?

645
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:49,821
We'd like to speak with you if we may,
about Christian.

646
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:54,910
-Have you been in to see him?
-Yes. He was sleeping. But we've...

647
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,872
We've changed our minds about
going forward with this new treatment.

648
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,960
But you don't even know
if it's working yet.

649
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,588
We think that Christian's
been through enough.

650
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,258
We want to put our faith in God now.

651
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:13,178
-I see.
-MRS. FEARON: It's nothing against you.

652
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,763
No.

653
00:57:14,847 --> 00:57:16,890
If you were a mother, you'd understand.

654
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,727
Have you spoken to Father Ybarra?

655
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,943
Yes. But the decision is ours.

656
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,867
What if it did work?

657
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:42,249
What if we found
we'd made the wrong choice by stopping?

658
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,921
You're saying you can save my son?

659
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,094
I'm saying I don't want to give up now.

660
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:01,143
But, lo and behold,
when we were about to hit the tarmac,

661
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:05,772
and all of a sudden the plane gears up,
and we're back up in the air again.

662
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:11,486
I say, "Honey, isn't this fantastic?
We're going to die together."

663
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,740
Turns out there was a plane
parked on the tarmac

664
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:18,285
and we missed colliding with it
by seconds.

665

01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,233
Yes. I said, "Don't give up."

701

I need to know why you said that.

702

Do you know what it is that I do?

707
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:11,041
No. I can see you're a woman of faith.

708

But not in the same things
as your husband.

709

He's not my husband.

710
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,506
-Do you care to tell me about yourself?
-No!

-What?

In a position to judge?
And yet you've judged me, haven't you?

714
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,973
You deserve to be judged.

this vile box of monsters home?

717

even as we hate ourselves,

719
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,528
That doesn't make it any less sickening.

720
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,696
And where do they come from,
these appetites,

721

these uncontrollable urges of ours?

722
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,575
Not from God.

01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,579
Not from me.
I castrated myself when I was 26.

01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,597
He told me,

1032
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:37,892
"Don't give up."

1033
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:43,398
And I didn't. And it saved your life.

1034
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:49,028
(VOICE BREAKING) But I've put that boy
through hell.

1035
01:37:49,696 --> 01:37:52,573
And I have another surgery
scheduled for this morning

1036
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:55,660
because I believed
that God was telling me to.

1037
01:37:56,995 --> 01:37:59,622
Through a pedophile priest, no less.

1038
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:05,002
What if Father Joe's prayers
were answered after all?

1039
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:08,172
What if he were forgiven

1040
01:38:09,216 --> 01:38:11,300
because he didn't give up?

1041
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,351
Try proving that one, Mulder.

1042
01:38:26,024 --> 01:38:27,984
I'm due at the hospital.

1043
01:38:35,742 --> 01:38:36,993
Scully?

1044
01:38:38,829 --> 01:38:40,705
Why would he say that?

1045
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:45,334
"Don't give up."
Why would he say such a thing to you?

1046
01:38:50,299 --> 01:38:52,341
I think that was
clearly meant for you, Mulder.

1047
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:56,220
He didn't say it to me. He said it to you.

1048
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:02,935
If Father Joe were the devil,

1049
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:06,647
why would he say the opposite
of what the devil might say?

1050
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:11,527
Maybe that's the answer.

1051
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,738
You know, the larger answer.

1052
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:16,657
What do you mean?

1053
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:19,160
Don't give up.

1054
01:39:26,251 --> 01:39:29,629
Please don't make this
any harder than it already is.

1055
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:34,175
It's okay. Okay.

1056
01:39:36,553 --> 01:39:38,763
(SOFTLY) If you have any doubts,

1057
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,349
any doubts at all,

1058
01:39:42,684 --> 01:39:45,436
just call off that surgery this morning.

1059
01:39:48,857 --> 01:39:51,192
And then we'll get out of here.

1060
01:39:54,947 --> 01:39:56,614
Just me and you.

1061
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:05,289
As far away from the darkness
as we can get?

1062
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:10,419
I'm not sure it works that way.

1063
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:13,256
I think maybe the darkness finds you,

1064
01:40:13,465 --> 01:40:14,674
and me.

1065
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,302
I know it does.

1066
01:40:23,725 --> 01:40:25,309
But let it try.

1067
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:50,895
(SIGHS)

1068
01:41:51,938 --> 01:41:54,398
Are you ready to begin, Dr. Scully?

1069
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,045
Yes.

1070
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:28,969
(BROKEN PLAYING)

1071
01:44:57,207 --> 01:45:03,587
Dead state I can feeI the weight
Light streaming in through the open grate

1072
01:45:04,047 --> 01:45:10,761
Two thread score tearing up the floor
Out in the aIIey with the trigger draw

1073
01:45:11,638 --> 01:45:17,893
Numb hands I can see the strand
HoId it together with a severed band

1074
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:25,401
Three Iost years I've been crying here
l'm over, l'm over, l'm over, l'm broken

1075
01:45:26,278 --> 01:45:33,117
Strung out with the wings of the dawn
Hole in the black, soul in the storm

1076
01:45:33,743 --> 01:45:40,499
Torn down through the cracks in the dark
We're miIes adrift, we're inches apart

1077
01:45:44,087 --> 01:45:50,175
I'm hit, I can feeI the grit
Sat in the asher on the beaten brick

1078
01:45:50,802 --> 01:45:57,558
Two thread main running through the vein
Out in the center with a mirrored cane

1079
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:04,648
Numb feet I can hear you speak
HoId it together with a severed streak

1080
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:12,239
Three fuII years I've been crying here
l'm over, l'm over, l'm over, l'm broken

1081
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:20,039
Strung out with wings of the dawn
Hole in the black, soul in the storm

1082
01:46:20,498 --> 01:46:27,296
Torn down through the cracks in the dark
We're miIes adrift, we're inches apart

1083
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:34,470
Stood up on the side of the earth
Thrown back to the track to the dirt

1084
01:46:35,013 --> 01:46:41,435
Two thread Iose an hour a day
We're miIes adrift, we're inches away

1085
01:47:31,861 --> 01:47:38,784
Strung out with wings of the dawn
Hole in the black, soul in the storm

1086
01:47:39,244 --> 01:47:45,749
Two thread Iose an hour a day
We're miIes adrift, we're inches away

1087
01:47:49,671 --> 01:47:53,090
We're miIes adrift, we're inches away
