00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:19,611
<i>WERNER HERZOG: These images taken
under the ice of the Ross Sea in Antarctica</i>

2
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,246
<i>were the reason
I wanted to go to this continent.</i>

3
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:31,293
<i>The pictures were taken by a friend of mine,
one of these expert divers.</i>

4
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:37,088
<i>The best connection is on
military planes out of New Zealand,</i>

5
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:41,065
<i>loaded with chained-down parts
of polar stations.</i>

6
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:52,445
<i>Most of the passengers had tucked
into their laptops and their books,</i>

7
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,708
<i>and many of them were sleeping.</i>

8
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:05,392
<i>Who were the people I was going to meet
in Antarctica at the end of the world?</i>

9
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:07,358
<i>What were their dreams?</i>

10
00:03:14,336 --> 00:03:18,830
<i>We flew into the unknown,
a seemingly endless void.</i>

11
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:24,808
<i>I was surprised that
I was even on this plane.</i>

12
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,849
<i>The NationaI Science Foundation
had invited me to Antarctica,</i>

13
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,408
<i>even though I left no doubt
that I would not come up</i>

14
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,886
<i>with another film about penguins.</i>

15
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:40,994
<i>My questions about nature,
I let them know, were different.</i>

16
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,730
<i>I told them I kept wondering</i>

17
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:52,137
<i>why is it that human beings put on
masks or feathers to conceaI their identity?</i>

18
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:58,879
<i>And why do they saddle horses
and feeI the urge to chase the bad guy?</i>

19
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,413
Hi-yo, Silver!

20
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:12,950
<i>And why is it that certain species
of ants keep flocks of plant lice as slaves</i>

21
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:15,529
<i>to milk them for droplets of sugar?</i>

22
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:22,332
<i>I asked them why is it
that a sophisticated animaI like a chimp</i>

23
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:24,962
<i>does not utilize inferior creatures?</i>

24
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:30,708
<i>He could straddle a goat
and ride off into the sunset.</i>

25
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,890
<i>Despite my odd questions, I found myself
landing on the ice runway at McMurdo.</i>

26
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:57,705
<i>For most of the austraI spring and summer,
which lasts from October through February,</i>

27
00:04:57,872 --> 00:05:01,740
<i>planes can land on
the 8-foot thick ice of the Ross Sea.</i>

28
00:05:03,945 --> 00:05:07,608
<i>In the distance,
the mountains of the Transantarctic range.</i>

29
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:12,510
<i>McMurdo itself is situated on an island.</i>

30
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:18,617
<i>The Ross Sea is the largest bay
in the continent.</i>

31
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:22,219
<i>This bay alone covers the size
of the state of Texas.</i>

32
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:38,339
<i>On this very same frozen ocean,</i>

33
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:43,179
<i>the early explorer's ship
got wedged into moving ice flows.</i>

34
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,511
<i>Here, Shackleton's expedition
evacuates their vesseI,</i>

35
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:52,559
<i>which would later come to ruin,
leaving them stranded there.</i>

36
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,765
<i>Everything in this expedition was doomed,</i>

37
00:06:07,876 --> 00:06:11,778
<i>including the first ancestor
of the snowmobile.</i>

38
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,216
<i>The idea was too big for
the technicaI possibilities 100 years ago.</i>

39
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,813
<i>At that time,
every step meant incredible hardship.</i>

40
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:44,606
<i>The first thing that caught my eye
upon landing</i>

41
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:47,408
<i>was the humongous bus and its driver.</i>

42
00:06:57,392 --> 00:07:02,125
<i>- We're clearing the apron now, thank you.
- Hey, you're welcome.</i>

43
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:11,762
This is Ivan the Terra Bus.
It's one of seven in the world,

44
00:07:11,873 --> 00:07:15,468
weighs 67,000 pounds
and is the largest vehicle on the continent.

45
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:19,914
What do you do when you are
back home? Are you a taxi driver?

46
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,175
I am not a taxi driver at home.

47
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:25,878
Before I came to Antarctica,
I was actually a banker in Colorado.

48
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,387
And after two years there,
I changed my pace a little bit

49
00:07:29,591 --> 00:07:32,355
and decided to help
the people of Guatemala,

50
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,864
so I joined the Peace Corps, and there
I worked in small business development.

51
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,001
Just realized that the world's
not all about money.

52
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:43,466
<i>Where I lived in Guatemala
was in the northern part.</i>

53
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:50,204
<i>It's a Kekchi Mayan village, 99% Mayan,
and therefore nobody spoke Spanish.</i>

54
00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:53,376
<i>I had to learn the Mayan dialect, Kekchi.</i>

55
00:07:55,116 --> 00:07:59,883
<i>When I first moved to Chisec, I was just out
on a normaI walk, and before I knew it</i>

56
00:07:59,988 --> 00:08:03,924
<i>I had six people with machetes
chasing me down, wanting to talk to me.</i>

57
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:08,027
Turns out the little brother
told them I was there to steal children.

58
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,359
I was, however, not there to steal children.

59
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,928
<i>They took me back to my:. My judge
and jury was the 14-year-old boy in the town</i>

60
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,336
who could speak both Spanish and Kekchi.

61
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,271
<i>Luckily, they let me go,</i>

62
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,812
<i>and we ended up being
great friends over the two years.</i>

63
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,149
The jury acquitted you.
- I was acquitted. I made it out of there.

64
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:31,649
But it could have been dangerous.

65
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:35,621
It is, it is.
And, you know, a story not too long ago is,

66
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,782
a lady was just taking a picture of a child,

67
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:42,158
you know, the same type of group of people
with machetes, and she wasn't so fortunate.

68
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:45,257
- She didn't make it out.
- What happened to her?

69
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:48,301
She was killed, by a machete.

70
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,571
<i>Approaching McMurdo Station,
the largest American base,</i>

71
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:58,646
<i>in fact the largest settlement in Antarctica.</i>

72
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:02,845
Right there is Captain Scott's hut,
built in 1902.

73
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:06,119
<i>During the austraI summer,</i>

74
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:10,590
<i>about 1,000 people live here
experiencing a strange state,</i>

75
00:09:11,726 --> 00:09:14,092
<i>five months of no nighttime.</i>

76
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:20,030
<i>McMurdo serves as a logisticaI hub</i>

77
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:24,137
<i>and provides fixed laboratory facilities
for research.</i>

78
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:28,304
<i>All the decisions about scientific projects</i>

79
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:32,243
<i>are the domain of my host,
the NationaI Science Foundation.</i>

80
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:37,707
<i>Day to day logistics
are run by a defense contractor.</i>

81
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:42,884
<i>I had been told by some
disgruntled former inhabitants</i>

82
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:46,791
<i>that they ran things
in the spirit of a correctionaI facility.</i>

83
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:56,059
<i>Actually, they were decent people,
just too concerned for my personaI safety.</i>

84
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,742
<i>Of course, I did not expect
pristine landscapes</i>

85
00:10:02,844 --> 00:10:07,008
<i>and men living in blissfuI harmony
with fluffy penguins,</i>

86
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:12,347
<i>but I was still surprised to find McMurdo
looking like an ugly mining town</i>

87
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:16,480
<i>filled with Caterpillars
and noisy construction sites.</i>

88
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:55,955
<i>Who are the people
who drive the heavy machinery,</i>

89
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,758
<i>and what brought them to Antarctica?</i>

90
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:06,903
<i>It's a long story.
I've explored many different</i>

91
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:12,905
lands of the mind and many worlds of ideas,

92
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:17,879
and I started before I even knew
how to read and write.

93
00:11:17,985 --> 00:11:21,352
<i>My grandmother was reading
The Odyssey and The lliad to me,</i>

94
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:25,823
so I started my journey in my fantasy,

95
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:28,794
before I even knew the means

96
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,764
of accomplishing it, but my mind
and my psyche was ready for it.

97
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,667
I was already traveling with Odysseus
and with the Argonauts

98
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:42,708
and to those strange and amazing lands,
and that always stayed with me,

99
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,679
that fascination of the world,
and that I fell in love with the world.

100
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:53,412
And it's been very powerful
and has been with me this whole time.

101
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,184
And how does it happen that
we are encountering each other here

102
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,624
at the end of the world?

103
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:05,756
I think that it's a logical place to find
each other because this place works

104
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:10,463
almost as a natural selection for people that

105
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:14,398
have this intention to jump
off the margin of the map,

106
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:18,411
and we all meet here where
all the lines of the map converge.

107
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,141
<i>There is no point that is
south of the South Pole.</i>

108
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:29,751
And I think there is a fair amount
of the population here

109
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:34,226
which are full-time travelers
and part-time workers.

110
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:36,159
So yes, those are the professional dreamers.

111
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:40,633
They dream all the time,
and, I think, through them

112
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:45,463
the great cosmic dreams come into fruition,

113
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:49,441
because the universe dreams
through our dreams,

114
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:53,810
and I think that there is

115
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:56,713
many different ways for the reality

116
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:01,084
to bring itself forward, and dreaming
is definitely one of those ways.

117
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:03,281
<i>As banaI as McMurdo appears,</i>

118
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,047
<i>it turns out it is filled
with these professionaI dreamers.</i>

119
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,720
At night, I was laying
in my bed here in McMurdo.

120
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:18,698
I am again walking across the top of B-15.

121
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,324
Might as well be
on a piece of the South Pole,

122
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:24,336
but yet I'm actually adrift in the ocean,

123
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:29,902
a vagabond floating in the ocean,
and below my feet

124
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:32,707
I can feel the rumble of the iceberg.

125
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:36,271
I can feel the change, the cry of the iceberg

126
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:39,911
as it's screeching
and as it's bouncing off the seabed,

127
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:43,957
as it's steering the ocean currents,
as it's beginning to move north.

128
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:48,893
I can feel that sound coming up
through the bottoms of my feet

129
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:53,490
and telling me that this iceberg
is coming north. That's my dream.

130
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:11,875
So here I'm sitting in this lovely warm lab
and just outside is the environment

131
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:16,218
that Scott and Shackleton first faced
when they came here about 100 years ago.

132
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:22,753
Unlike Scott and Shackleton, who viewed
the ice as this sort of static monster

133
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:25,832
that had to be crossed
to get to the South Pole,

134
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,767
we scientists now are able to
see the ice as a dynamic living entity

135
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:35,331
that is sort of producing change,
like the icebergs that I study.

136
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,372
For me, it's been a wild ride.

137
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,883
First of all, I found out that the iceberg
that I came down to study

138
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:48,012
<i>not only was larger than the iceberg
that sank the Titanic,</i>

139
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:51,691
<i>it was not only larger than the Titanic itself,</i>

140
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:55,284
<i>but it was larger than the country
that built the Titanic.</i>

141
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:56,454
That's pretty big.

142
00:15:57,598 --> 00:16:04,333
This is B-15. So what we see here
is the white cliff. It's about 150 feet tall,

143
00:16:04,438 --> 00:16:09,705
so that means that there's over
1,000 feet of ice below the water line.

144
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,008
This iceberg is so big
that the water that it contains

145
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:19,576
would run the flow of
the river Jordan for 1,000 years.

146
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:25,785
<i>It's so big that the water that is inside of it
would run the river Nile for 75 years.</i>

147
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:32,156
<i>MacAYEAL: This is a little bit
of video that we shot</i>

148
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:34,496
<i>when we were flying up to the iceberg.</i>

149
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:38,231
<i>It looks big and it looms above us,
even if we're on an aircraft</i>

150
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:42,571
<i>flying above the iceberg,
the iceberg is always above us.</i>

151
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:46,477
<i>It's above us because it's a mystery
that we don't understand.</i>

152
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:52,118
<i>Here's a picture of what it looked like once
we had arrived in the center of the iceberg.</i>

153
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,948
<i>We put out our instruments.</i>

154
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,617
<i>Now we're gonna have an opportunity
to monitor how the iceberg drifts north.</i>

155
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,252
<i>They're so big, there's an element of fear.</i>

156
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,662
<i>We don't know, really,
what's going to come ahead</i>

157
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,827
<i>when they eventually begin to melt
in the ocean beyond Antarctica.</i>

158
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:17,511
What we're seeing now here
is a time-lapse sort of animation

159
00:17:17,611 --> 00:17:22,048
of satellite imagery of the sea ice
and of the continent of Antarctica.

160
00:17:22,183 --> 00:17:24,777
And what you see are three shades of gray.

161
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:27,854
This sort of lighter shade of gray
is the sea ice,

162
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:32,118
and these little bits and pieces here,
these are titanic icebergs.

163
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:37,596
This little fellow right here, he's not a very
big iceberg compared to these other ones,

164
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:42,963
but that guy there might be the size of
the island of Sicily in the Mediterranean.

165
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,631
It's like a little tiny bumblebee
zipping around in a circle,

166
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:50,074
happy to be in the warm waters
as it's drifting north.

167
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:58,116
I'd be happy to see Antarctica as a static,
monolithic environment,

168
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:03,782
a cold monolith of ice, sort of the way
the people back in the past used to see it,

169
00:18:03,891 --> 00:18:08,385
but now our comfortable thought
about Antarctica is over.

170
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:12,057
Now we're seeing it as
a living being that's dynamic,

171
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:18,194
that's producing change, change that
it's broadcasting to the rest of the world,

172
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:23,333
possibly in response to what the world
is broadcasting down to Antarctica.

173
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:27,175
Certainly on a gut level
it's going to be frightening

174
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:30,910
to watch what happens
to these babies once they get north.

175
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:48,465
<i>What environment would the men
of Shackleton's expedition encounter</i>

176
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:50,969
<i>if they returned in a next life?</i>

177
00:18:55,543 --> 00:18:59,377
<i>Shackleton, seen here,
would finally make it to the Pole,</i>

178
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,143
<i>a quest he had to abandon
a mere 100 miles short of it.</i>

179
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:08,146
<i>Would there be any ice left?</i>

180
00:19:08,255 --> 00:19:12,453
<i>Would he have to construct
an artificiaI Antarctica in a studio</i>

181
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,360
<i>and try to find his route through
papier-mache icebergs?</i>

182
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:32,241
<i>Would our only modern recourse
be to create ice with machines?</i>

183
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:35,775
This is Frosty Boy, here in McMurdo.

184
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,512
It's the equivalent of ice cream in the States,
and it's a really big hit.

185
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,717
Everybody loves it. It's what they go for
three or four times a day.

186
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:48,625
And it has the texture of ice cream,
but it's not quite ice cream.

187
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:54,663
There's a lot of crises that happen
in McMurdo when the Frosty Boy runs out.

188
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:57,599
It's bad news.

189
00:19:57,705 --> 00:20:03,974
Words circulate everywhere throughout
McMurdo when Frosty Boy goes down.

190
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,943
It's really good stuff.

191
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:11,776
<i>From the very first day,
we just wanted to get out of this place.</i>

192
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:19,254
<i>McMurdo has climate-controlled housing
facilities, its own radio station,</i>

193
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,163
<i>a bowling alley and abominations
such as an aerobic studio and yoga classes.</i>

194
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,894
<i>It even has an ATM machine.</i>

195
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:37,702
<i>For all these reasons, I wanted to get out
into the field as soon as possible.</i>

196
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:47,013
<i>But before we could do that, it is mandatory
that every inhabitant of McMurdo</i>

197
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:51,353
<i>attend survivaI schooI
before being allowed to leave.</i>

198
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:59,929
<i>This two-day exercise
is called Happy Camper.</i>

199
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:15,312
<i>Students learn to build
survivaI trenches and igloos.</i>

200
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:20,376
<i>The bad news is, that night
you have to sleep in your own construction.</i>

201
00:21:20,554 --> 00:21:24,547
As long as I end up with 10 fingers
and 10 toes at the end, it's all good.

202
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:40,740
Oh, God, sorry!

203
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,833
We just need to break ourselves
into two different groups now.

204
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:49,505
We're gonna brief this group over here
for the burning vehicle scenario first,

205
00:21:49,616 --> 00:21:52,244
then we're gonna come back over
and we're gonna brief

206
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:55,754
the bucket head white-out scenario
for everybody else.

207
00:21:55,856 --> 00:22:00,555
Essentially, we're trying to create conditions
where we wouldn't be able to see.

208
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:06,156
The wind is so severe, the snow is blowing
so severely. Very, very cold.

209
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:11,499
Exposed skin might actually
create frostbite instantaneously.

210
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:15,268
The winds are so severe
you could be blown off of your stance

211
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,075
of just simply standing out,
and visibility is pretty much none.

212
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,838
You can't see flag to flag.

213
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:25,385
You might not be able to see your hand
in front of your own face.

214
00:22:25,486 --> 00:22:29,115
Therefore,
what we're gonna do as a simulator

215
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:34,991
is incorporate a bucket to simulate
a white-out condition

216
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:38,258
to a point where I can barely hear myself.

217
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:44,702
You can't necessarily even hear me, and
I certainly can't see any of you right now.

218
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:49,869
So that's the whole idea
behind the bucket head

219
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:54,311
is to actually be a white-out simulator,
and it works really quite well.

220
00:22:55,449 --> 00:22:58,680
So, some of the parameters
for this are gonna be,

221
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:01,220
we're gonna start inside the sea-ice hut.

222
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:03,380
I said I was gonna go to the bathroom,
and in fact I did.

223
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,085
I needed to go to the bathroom, right.
So, I've gone out.

224
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:09,526
I've been gone for
quite some time now though,

225
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,327
you know, like 10, 15.
All of a sudden 20 minutes, you're like,

226
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,631
<i>"First off, where's the chocolate,
second off, where's Kevin?"</i>

227
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:19,434
Are you with us, Number One?
- Number One is out.

228
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:25,144
<i>The goaI is clear,
to find the instructor next to the outhouse.</i>

229
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:27,611
Number Two is out.

230
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,581
Number Three out. Number Three out.

231
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:33,847
All right, Number One, you're
gonna have to walk in one simple direction,

232
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,650
<i>and I'm gonna keep the:.
Pull on one rope for me.</i>

233
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:37,985
Four out.

234
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:42,690
<i>It looks pretty good: They seem
to be heading in the right direction.</i>

235
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:44,056
Five out.

236
00:23:44,932 --> 00:23:46,126
Six out.

237
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:52,196
<i>But very soon the front man veers
off-course, pulling everyone else with him.</i>

238
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,528
<i>- Pull the rope, somebody:.
Hey, anybody out there?</i>

239
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,258
Out here. Number Three is here.

240
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:24,604
- Where you at, Number Two?
- Find him?

241
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:58,162
- Did we find the guy?
- No.

242
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,503
Okay, I think we're gonna go this way.

243
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,842
Follow me this way, guys. This way, guys.

244
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:11,317
Hold on, hold on.

245
00:25:12,452 --> 00:25:15,046
So part of what we want to do here
as an educational opportunity

246
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:17,248
is see if they realize what they've done,

247
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:20,019
come back to a hut
and come up with a new game plan,

248
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:24,257
or if they just keep going down
that cascading error phenomenon,

249
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,423
where one mistake
leads into another mistake

250
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:29,195
which leads into a third,
and it just gets really bad.

251
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,666
Who's pulling on this line?

252
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:33,103
- Me.
- Number One.

253
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,233
Number One, don't pull on that.
That's the line going back to the hut.

254
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,971
- I got the end.
- Okay, back to the hut?

255
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,613
- Back to the hut.
- Back to the hut.

256
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:42,204
Back to the hut.

257
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,144
<i>But rather than
pulling everyone in,</i>

258
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,414
<i>last man first along the rope,</i>

259
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:51,456
<i>they drift completely off-course.</i>

260
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,721
- Number Two is here. Is Number Three here?
- Number Three is here.

261
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,091
Number Four?

262
00:25:58,465 --> 00:26:01,957
- Towards the sun.
- No, not towards the sun.

263
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:04,170
- Left.
- We need to go left.

264
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:06,269
Left, stay left.

265
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:09,433
We don't know where he's standing though,
so left might be different for him.

266
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,474
- Correct.
- Number Two.

267
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:13,812
- Okay, Number One.
- I'm here.

268
00:26:13,914 --> 00:26:18,908
<i>For most of our time here,
we had postcard-pretty weather conditions.</i>

269
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:26,218
<i>This was frustrating because I loathe
the sun both on my celluloid and my skin.</i>

270
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:35,193
<i>So it almost came as a relief when a few
days later, the weather suddenly changed.</i>

271
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:53,419
<i>The storm soon broke and we were allowed
to venture out of McMurdo for the first time.</i>

272
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:02,451
<i>We set out on snowmobiles, in front of us
miles and miles of frozen ocean.</i>

273
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:09,498
<i>We were heading toward a field camp
of scientists who study seals.</i>

274
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,608
<i>It was amazing to consider</i>

275
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:20,146
<i>that a mere six feet under us
was the expanse of the Ross Sea.</i>

276
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,396
<i>These scientists here
are particularly interested</i>

277
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:24,306
<i>in the feeding cycle of the Weddell seaI.</i>

278
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:27,269
<i>In just a few short weeks,</i>

279
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:32,713
<i>pups grow rapidly, while mothers lose
some 40% of their body weight.</i>

280
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:52,271
<i>Bagging the seaI's head keeps the animaI
calm as the scientists extract a milk sample.</i>

281
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,512
<i>Well, this really is quite
a wonderfuI group of animals to work on.</i>

282
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,954
<i>Weddell seals in particular,
you can see they're very big.</i>

283
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,587
They're very strong,
and yet they allow us to work with them.

284
00:29:17,697 --> 00:29:20,632
They're not very aggressive,
nor are they very timid.

285
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:25,137
Even though they struggle somewhat
when you have them in a bag or in a net,

286
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,331
when you release them, they lie down.

287
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:30,342
There's the mother behind us
who we just worked on,

288
00:29:30,444 --> 00:29:32,139
and she's just lying quietly with her pup.

289
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:35,180
We've had pups start to nurse within
a couple of minutes of releasing them.

290
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:40,275
So even though they are a bit perturbed
at being handled,

291
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:43,982
they recover very quickly from it
and seem to behave normally after that,

292
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,289
and really that's the ideal for us is to have
an animal species that we can work on

293
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:54,163
that will not be so disturbed by the work
that's being done on them

294
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:55,461
that they behave abnormally,

295
00:29:55,569 --> 00:30:00,063
'cause we want to know how these
animals survive, under these conditions.

296
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,437
<i>In a field laboratory
adjacent to the colony,</i>

297
00:30:07,547 --> 00:30:09,640
<i>they prepare the milk samples</i>

298
00:30:09,749 --> 00:30:13,913
<i>that may ultimately provide insight
into human weight loss.</i>

299
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:18,615
<i>This was just collected. It's still warm
from the animal. So if you see that:.</i>

300
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,494
See, it's like, you know,
it's almost like pouring wax.

301
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:26,726
It's really something else. And if I let this
cool down, it would get pretty pasty.

302
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:30,826
I wouldn't be able to pour it like that at all.
It's at body temperature right now.

303
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,470
<i>The milk of the Weddell seal
is about 45%fat.</i>

304
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:40,774
<i>It's about 60% dry matter, 65% dry matter.</i>

305
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,075
It's very, very high in protein.

306
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,946
<i>It's about 10 to 12% protein
and contains no lactose at all,</i>

307
00:30:46,186 --> 00:30:47,346
which is very unusual.

308
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:50,920
And there's many things
about this place that are very unusual,

309
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:56,519
and one of the things that I find
very fascinating is how quiet it gets.

310
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,824
It's the quietest place.

311
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:00,798
When the wind is down,
when there's no wind,

312
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,426
it wakes you up in the middle of the night
because there's no wind,

313
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:04,868
and there's no sound at all,

314
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:07,838
and if you walk out on the ice,
you can hear your own heartbeat,

315
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:08,965
that's how still it is.

316
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,543
<i>And you can hear the:.
You can hear the ice crack,</i>

317
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:14,739
and it sounds like there's somebody walking
behind you, but it's just the ice.

318
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:18,579
It's sort of, you know,
these little stress cracks moving all the time,

319
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,652
because we're actually,
right here we're on ocean.

320
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,918
<i>We're not on solid ground, so:.
And you can hear the seals.</i>

321
00:31:25,025 --> 00:31:27,619
<i>You can hear the seals call,
and it's the most amazing sound.</i>

322
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,321
<i>They make these really inorganic sounds.</i>

323
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,257
<i>They sound like,
I don't know, Pink Floyd or something.</i>

324
00:31:35,368 --> 00:31:38,428
<i>They don't sound like mammals,
and they definitely don't sound like animals.</i>

325
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:42,875
It's really out of this world, I can say that.

326
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,514
<i>You get used to
a surface being solid,</i>

327
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,317
and you sort of think in your mind
that you're on land, and then all of a sudden

328
00:31:57,424 --> 00:31:59,415
you'll hear the sound
coming up through the floor.

329
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:03,155
<i>- You'll hear the chucks and the whistles:.
- And the booms.</i>

330
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:04,787
<i>And the booms that come which are the:.</i>

331
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:07,458
You realize there's
a whole world underneath you,

332
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:11,367
that seals are moving and competing
and fighting beneath you under the ice

333
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:15,305
while you're here sleeping in a tent
or working in a lab hut.

334
00:33:28,948 --> 00:33:33,442
<i>We soon returned to
the prosaic world of today's McMurdo.</i>

335
00:33:35,021 --> 00:33:40,288
<i>David Pacheco works in maintenance
and construction as a journeyman plumber.</i>

336
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:43,789
<i>He prides himself on his heritage.</i>

337
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:48,095
<i>He is part Apache
but has claims to yet another lineage.</i>

338
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:55,365
It's funny, but I'm revealing my hands
and they are very distinct,

339
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:59,809
and I was told by my doctor
who operated me that

340
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:04,247
it is from the Aztec
and the Inca's royal family.

341
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:10,755
An anthropologist told me that,
and one of our daughters is very similar,

342
00:34:10,857 --> 00:34:13,155
but everywhere I go,
I try to find somebody. See?

343
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,659
And I can turn it around too,
if you wanna see it this way.

344
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,890
It's very distinct, the line here,

345
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:25,198
and I was at awe when they told me
it was from the royal family of the Indians.

346
00:34:25,305 --> 00:34:30,333
When you work, with which fingers
do you work best or point best?

347
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,138
I don't know if I should say this. It's funny,

348
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:36,341
but in school I used to not reach
the chalkboard with this,

349
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,418
so I used to point with this,
and they called my father in

350
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:40,918
and said that I was being a bad boy,

351
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,648
but I still have the habit
of pointing like that.

352
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,987
I have a long ribcage.
He could not find the gallbladder.

353
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:52,827
<i>I have a long ribcage like the Aztecs
used to have, I guess, and:.</i>

354
00:34:55,034 --> 00:35:01,598
If you can come to Antarctica, please do.
Plus, be aware of global warming. It's real.

355
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:08,443
I'm a green person. I'm as green as I can be.
I build adobe homes, solar homes.

356
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:15,511
<i>I'm a contractor back home, too, but it's
so hard for a small minority to make it, but:.</i>

357
00:35:57,096 --> 00:36:00,463
Spirit, the fire of my ancestors.

358
00:36:15,248 --> 00:36:19,810
<i>Our next journey took us
85 kilometers over frozen ocean.</i>

359
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,294
<i>We were heading from Ross Island
in the direction of mainland Antarctica.</i>

360
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:36,168
<i>The empty interior beyond these mountains</i>

361
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:40,069
<i>is larger in size than
continentaI North America.</i>

362
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:46,941
<i>The vast majority of it is
covered in a layer of ice 9,000 feet thick.</i>

363
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:50,745
<i>We were heading for New Harbor,</i>

364
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,878
<i>a diving camp
which lies on the coastline of the ocean.</i>

365
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:58,981
<i>To the right is the frozen sea
where they dive.</i>

366
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,185
<i>The camp itself is built on firm ground.</i>

367
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:16,169
<i>We were welcomed by my friend
Henry Kaiser, a musician and expert diver,</i>

368
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:20,440
<i>whose underwater footage
it was that brought me to this place.</i>

369
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,945
<i>We had arrived at an opportune time
and went straight to this shelter</i>

370
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:30,489
<i>which protects a primary diving hole
next to New Harbor camp.</i>

371
00:37:32,692 --> 00:37:36,890
<i>Sam Bowser is the head
of the scientific field team.</i>

372
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,226
<i>We found him in a pensive mood.</i>

373
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:43,131
Sam Bowser,
this is a special day for you?

374
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,400
<i>Well, I think:.</i>

375
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:52,035
I think everyone should stop
when they've reached a point

376
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:55,546
where they've done
what they've wanted to do,

377
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:59,015
and today is probably gonna be
my last Antarctic dive, I think.

378
00:37:59,118 --> 00:38:00,210
<i>I think we've accomplished what:.</i>

379
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,949
At least, I've accomplished
what I've set out to do here,

380
00:38:04,057 --> 00:38:09,859
and it's time to pass the ball off to
the next generation of biologists, I think.

381
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:12,124
So, it is a bit of a special day.

382
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:17,066
<i>I had heard that he was also
a great science fiction fan.</i>

383
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,731
The creatures that are down there
that are like science-fiction creatures,

384
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,142
they range in the way that they would
gobble you up from slime-type blobs,

385
00:38:27,046 --> 00:38:30,675
but creepier than classic
science-fiction blobs.

386
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:32,876
These would have long tendrils
that would ensnare you,

387
00:38:32,986 --> 00:38:35,216
and as you tried to get away from them

388
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:38,688
you'd just become more and more ensnared
by your own actions.

389
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:42,420
And then after you would be frustrated
and exhausted,

390
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:47,322
then this creature would start to move in
and take you apart.

391
00:38:47,433 --> 00:38:49,367
So that's one example
of one of the creatures.

392
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:52,961
Then there are other types of worm-type
things with horrible mandibles

393
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:57,540
and jaws and just bits to rend your flesh.

394
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:03,115
It really is a violent,
horribly violent world that

395
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:07,983
is obscure to us
because we're encased in neoprene,

396
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,612
you know,
and we're much larger than that world.

397
00:39:10,857 --> 00:39:13,519
So it doesn't really affect us,
but if you were to shrink down,

398
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:18,222
miniaturize into that world,
it'd be a horrible place to be. Just horrible.

399
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:21,425
And this is a world
earlier than human beings.

400
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:25,163
Do you think that the human race
and other mammals

401
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:30,538
fled in panic from the oceans
and crawled on solid land to get out of this?

402
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:34,170
Yeah, I think undoubtedly
that's exactly the driving force

403
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,215
that caused us to leave the horrors behind.

404
00:39:37,383 --> 00:39:40,648
To grow and evolve into larger creatures
to escape

405
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:44,883
what's horribly violent
at the miniature scale, miniaturized scale.

406
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,685
Yeah.

407
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:59,870
<i>The water under the ice is
minus 2 degrees Celsius.</i>

408
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:07,076
That keeps us insulated from the cold.

409
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:18,380
Want me to open it up?

410
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:19,890
- Yeah. Ready?
- Yeah.

411
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:40,136
<i>Dive operation. Time right now is:.</i>

412
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,048
<i>I'll give you a call back at about 2:30.</i>

413
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:58,094
<i>To me, the divers look like astronauts
floating in space.</i>

414
00:40:59,265 --> 00:41:02,792
<i>But their work is extremely dangerous.</i>

415
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:06,803
<i>They are diving without tethers
to give them more free range.</i>

416
00:41:09,442 --> 00:41:11,876
<i>But here you can't trust a compass.</i>

417
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:17,348
<i>So close to the magnetic pole, the needle
would point straight up or straight down.</i>

418
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:23,789
<i>Somehow you have to find
your way back to the exit hole</i>

419
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,791
<i>or you are trapped under the ceiling of ice.</i>

420
00:43:39,025 --> 00:43:42,961
So I selected some areas
that have the tree foraminifera,

421
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:46,862
and they're the ones we're interested in
right now, to find out if they're carnivores,

422
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:51,369
whether or not they eat shrimp-like
creatures, multi-cellular creatures.

423
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:56,271
And also I found a few of the urchins
that have, I think,

424
00:43:56,375 --> 00:44:00,675
they're the ones that have
a parasitic worm that lives in their anus.

425
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:03,475
It's a pretty beautiful scarlet worm,

426
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:07,279
but it must be a horrible way to make a life,
I would think.

427
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,827
<i>I tell you, gentlemen,
science has agreed</i>

428
00:44:15,928 --> 00:44:18,624
<i>that unless something is done,
and done quickly,</i>

429
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:24,033
<i>man as the dominant species of life on Earth
will be extinct within a year.</i>

430
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,897
<i>Sam Bowser likes to show</i>

431
00:44:29,008 --> 00:44:32,637
<i>doomsday science fiction films
to the researchers.</i>

432
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,312
<i>Many of them express grave doubts about
our long-ranging presence on this planet.</i>

433
00:44:41,687 --> 00:44:45,145
<i>Nature, they predict, will regulate us.</i>

434
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:49,057
<i>Stay in your homes.
I repeat, stay in your homes.</i>

435
00:44:49,161 --> 00:44:51,459
<i>Your personaI safety,
the safety of the entire city</i>

436
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:55,933
<i>depends upon your full cooperation
with the military authorities.</i>

437
00:44:56,035 --> 00:45:01,974
<i>Yes! Cities, nations, even civilization itself
threatened with annihilation.</i>

438
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:05,203
<i>Because in one moment of
history-making violence,</i>

439
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:10,007
<i>nature, mad, rampant,
wrought its most awesome creation.</i>

440
00:45:10,116 --> 00:45:13,176
<i>For born in that swirling inferno of
radioactive dust</i>

441
00:45:13,452 --> 00:45:18,480
<i>were things so horrible,
so terrifying, so hideous</i>

442
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:21,888
<i>there is no word to describe them.</i>

443
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:32,259
<i>We may be witnesses to
a biblicaI prophecy come true.</i>

444
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,965
<i>And there shall be destruction
and darkness come upon creation,</i>

445
00:45:36,475 --> 00:45:39,239
<i>and the beasts shall reign over the Earth.</i>

446
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:41,711
<i>Yes, the Earth,
infested by swarms:.</i>

447
00:45:41,814 --> 00:45:45,773
This is just the flower part.
The body is somewhere in the dirt over there.

448
00:45:45,885 --> 00:45:49,377
<i>All that the divers had brought
back from the ocean floor</i>

449
00:45:49,488 --> 00:45:54,983
<i>were a few spoonfuls of sand containing
the strange single-celled creatures</i>

450
00:45:55,094 --> 00:45:57,460
<i>the scientists are studying here.</i>

451
00:45:58,731 --> 00:46:04,101
<i>They are known as tree foraminifera,
primordiaI single-celled organisms.</i>

452
00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:08,666
<i>They branch out in the shape of trees.</i>

453
00:46:08,774 --> 00:46:13,302
<i>The branches give off pseudopodia,
microscopic false feet</i>

454
00:46:13,412 --> 00:46:19,146
<i>that gather and assemble grains of sand
into a protective shell around the twigs.</i>

455
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:25,149
These are the pseudopodia
that are secreted by foraminifera.

456
00:46:25,257 --> 00:46:28,658
They're long, thin, tendril-like projections.

457
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:31,823
What the foram does is it wakes up,

458
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:35,697
sends out the pseudopods and then just
grabs every particle in its environment

459
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:38,201
and pulls them in toward its body.

460
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:43,097
There's a certain pattern to the way
that they sort the particles.

461
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:46,336
They can select particular grains
out of everything in the environment

462
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:50,006
and just end up with them.
They're beautiful masons.

463
00:46:50,716 --> 00:46:54,243
Could that be
a very early appearance of intelligence?

464
00:46:54,386 --> 00:46:58,049
- I say it with great care.
- Yeah, I have to say it with great care, too,

465
00:46:58,157 --> 00:47:01,490
because there are stories about

466
00:47:01,594 --> 00:47:05,121
how these particular organisms
have fit into that debate.

467
00:47:05,264 --> 00:47:07,391
Turn of the last century, for example,

468
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,129
there was a scientist,
a British scientist named Heron-Allen

469
00:47:11,237 --> 00:47:14,673
who, apparently, during one of the debates

470
00:47:14,773 --> 00:47:17,503
in one of the British societies was

471
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,943
pointing out the fact that
every definition of intelligence

472
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:26,074
that was being formulated could be
fulfilled by these single-celled creatures.

473
00:47:28,153 --> 00:47:31,850
<i>Borderline intelligence,
yeah, at the single-celled leveI.</i>

474
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,618
<i>I mean, it is a manifestation
of the best of our abilities, really,</i>

475
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:39,628
<i>the way that they build their shells.
It's almost art.</i>

476
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:31,204
<i>I noticed that the divers,
in their routine, were not speaking at all.</i>

477
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,442
<i>To me,
they were like priests preparing for mass.</i>

478
00:50:02,941 --> 00:50:08,072
<i>Under the ice, the divers find themselves
in a separate reality,</i>

479
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:13,282
<i>where space and time
acquire a strange new dimension.</i>

480
00:50:13,419 --> 00:50:17,685
<i>Those few who have experienced the world
under the frozen sky</i>

481
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,751
<i>often speak of it as
going down into the cathedraI.</i>

482
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:50,591
<i>Back from the strange world
underwater, scientists study the samples.</i>

483
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:56,833
<i>One of the foremost scholars in the world
in his field, Dr: Pawlowski,</i>

484
00:54:56,935 --> 00:55:00,769
<i>studies the DNA sequences of foraminifera.</i>

485
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:07,004
<i>What looks esoteric is in fact one of the
fundamentaI questions about life on Earth.</i>

486
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,510
<i>In the same way that cosmologists search
for the origins of the universe,</i>

487
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:20,121
<i>the scientists here are tracing back
the evolution of life to its earliest stages.</i>

488
00:55:23,628 --> 00:55:28,122
<i>Sometimes the building blocks
of the sequences all seem to fit.</i>

489
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:34,829
Jan, what have you found today so far
on the sample that we found?

490
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,805
- Three new species.
- Three new species.

491
00:55:36,908 --> 00:55:39,399
Three new species on the dish.
That's fantastic.

492
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:43,470
- This is from the ROMEO site.
- Yeah, from the ROMEO site.

493
00:55:43,582 --> 00:55:49,043
It's one small silver and two elongated ones.
I don't know what it is.

494
00:55:49,154 --> 00:55:51,088
<i>We have to do the DNA, too.
We don't know:.</i>

495
00:55:51,189 --> 00:55:53,350
Is this a great moment?

496
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:57,118
- Yeah, yeah, this is.
- Yeah, any time you increase

497
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,687
the known diversity of these types
of creatures, it's pretty exciting.

498
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,768
Yeah. That is very special.

499
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,406
Apologies to rock musicians everywhere.

500
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:22,108
<i>Once the importance
of the discovery has sunk in,</i>

501
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,419
<i>Sam Bowser and his group plan to celebrate
the event in their own way.</i>

502
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,395
<i>They are rehearsing for
a late-night outdoor concert.</i>

503
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:36,391
<i>After the helicopter had dropped us off
back at McMurdo,</i>

504
00:57:36,862 --> 00:57:43,461
<i>nobody was around: The sundiaI showed
that it was close to 1:00 a:m.</i>

505
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:03,514
<i>It did not feeI like night,
so we had a look around.</i>

506
00:58:03,622 --> 00:58:09,424
<i>This unobtrusive building
had raised my curiosity for quite a while.</i>

507
00:58:46,498 --> 00:58:51,492
<i>Here amongst unripe tomatoes,
we ran into this young man.</i>

508
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,535
<i>How did he end up in this place?</i>

509
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:58,172
Oh, yeah, well, you know, I like to say,

510
00:58:58,276 --> 00:59:01,040
if you take everybody who's not tied down,
they all sort of

511
00:59:01,146 --> 00:59:03,273
fall down to the bottom of the planet, so,

512
00:59:03,381 --> 00:59:06,350
<i>you know, I haven't been:.
That's how we got here, you know.</i>

513
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:08,681
We're all at loose ends
and here we are together.

514
00:59:08,787 --> 00:59:11,278
I remember
when I first got down here I sort of

515
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:14,552
enjoyed the sensation of recognizing people
with my tribal markings.

516
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:17,753
<i>You know, I was like,
"Hey, these are my people:"</i>

517
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:23,494
PhDs washing dishes and, you know,
linguists on a continent with no languages

518
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,627
and that sort of thing, yeah. It's great.

519
00:59:25,737 --> 00:59:29,264
Yeah, specifically I was in
a graduate program, and we had lined up

520
00:59:29,374 --> 00:59:33,868
to do some work with
one of the people who was

521
00:59:33,979 --> 00:59:38,211
identified as a native speaker
and a competent native speaker of

522
00:59:38,316 --> 00:59:41,285
one of the languages
of the Winnebago people, the Ho-Chunk,

523
00:59:41,386 --> 00:59:43,377
<i>I think is how they pronounced it, and:.</i>

524
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:46,382
<i>To make a complicated story short,</i>

525
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:52,487
<i>he ran into New Age ideologues who made
insipid claims about black and white magic</i>

526
00:59:52,597 --> 00:59:54,963
<i>embedded in the grammar of this language.</i>

527
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:57,261
<i>Some of the oral tradition
that had been passed along:.</i>

528
00:59:57,369 --> 01:00:00,463
<i>Hence, in this stupid trend of academia,</i>

529
01:00:00,572 --> 01:00:03,803
<i>it would be better to let the language die
than preserve it.</i>

530
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:05,535
<i>:.you know, I could document a language:.</i>

531
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,943
<i>He had to destroy his entire PhD research.</i>

532
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:12,814
<i>So just imagine, you know, 90%</i>

533
01:00:12,917 --> 01:00:16,216
of languages will be extinct
probably in my lifetime.

534
01:00:16,388 --> 01:00:18,253
It's a catastrophic impact

535
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:21,922
to an ecosystem to talk
about that kind of extinction.

536
01:00:22,027 --> 01:00:25,190
Culturally, we're talking
about the same thing. I mean,

537
01:00:25,297 --> 01:00:28,460
you know, what if you lost all of

538
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,261
Russian literature, or something like that,
or Russian, you know? If you took all of the

539
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:36,739
Slavic languages and just they went
away, you know, and no more Tolstoy.

540
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:42,007
<i>It occurred to me that in the time
we spent with him in the greenhouse,</i>

541
01:00:42,113 --> 01:00:45,378
<i>possibly three or four languages had died.</i>

542
01:00:46,651 --> 01:00:50,109
<i>In our efforts to preserve
endangered species,</i>

543
01:00:50,221 --> 01:00:53,213
<i>we seem to overlook something
equally important.</i>

544
01:00:54,993 --> 01:00:59,259
<i>To me,
it is a sign of a deeply disturbed civilization</i>

545
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:04,324
<i>where tree huggers and whale huggers
in their weirdness are acceptable,</i>

546
01:01:04,436 --> 01:01:08,202
<i>while no one embraces
the last speakers of a language.</i>

547
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:21,208
<i>McMurdo is full of characters
like our linguist.</i>

548
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:26,120
<i>The bleak MoteI 6-drabness of
the corridors is misleading.</i>

549
01:01:27,926 --> 01:01:32,863
<i>Behind every door there is someone
with a speciaI story to tell.</i>

550
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:42,366
<i>Back in the '80s, I took a garbage
truck across Africa from London to Nairobi.</i>

551
01:01:42,841 --> 01:01:46,607
<i>That was a trip: Four months in
a garbage truck: It was horrible.</i>

552
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:51,011
<i>On numerous occasions we came pretty
close to, I don't know about dying,</i>

553
01:01:51,116 --> 01:01:53,243
<i>but pretty close
to being in some straits where</i>

554
01:01:53,351 --> 01:01:56,752
we didn't know if we were gonna get back
out of it, you know.

555
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:59,824
We got taken over by the military in Uganda,

556
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:03,655
and we were kidnapped, basically.
Truck was turned around

557
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:07,254
and we were going back to Entebbe.
We got out of that one.

558
01:02:07,365 --> 01:02:13,031
We were trying to wait for
this ferry in Wadi Halfa,

559
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,032
the one that blew up and 800 people died.

560
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:18,837
Well, we didn't get on that one.
We took off across a desert,

561
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:22,709
and we got stuck. We got stuck for five days

562
01:02:23,148 --> 01:02:29,815
<i>of absolute agony, of clawing
this truck with:. We were using plates,</i>

563
01:02:29,921 --> 01:02:34,290
just the dinner plates that we were using
for dinner, clawing at the tires.

564
01:02:34,926 --> 01:02:38,760
We had no water.
He had used all the water tanks for gasoline,

565
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:42,026
so basically we had a cup of water a day
or two cups.

566
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,928
<i>Her story goes on forever.</i>

567
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:47,436
<i>She dealt with a bout of malaria,</i>

568
01:02:47,605 --> 01:02:53,237
<i>with a herd of angry elephants pursuing her
through tsetse fly-invested swamps.</i>

569
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:57,644
<i>Got caught in a civiI war,
spent a night in a bombed-out airport,</i>

570
01:02:57,749 --> 01:03:00,718
<i>with rebels fighting and shooting
in a barroom brawI,</i>

571
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:04,186
<i>and was finally rescued
by drunk Russian pilots,</i>

572
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:07,315
<i>slaloming around crater holes
in the runway.</i>

573
01:03:07,525 --> 01:03:11,291
<i>This is how you get yourself
to any place in Antarctica.</i>

574
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:17,961
<i>At the so-called Freak Train event
at one of McMurdo's bars,</i>

575
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:23,569
<i>Karen is, not surprisingly,
one of the most popular performers.</i>

576
01:03:26,578 --> 01:03:30,412
<i>This is her famous
"TraveI as hand luggage" act.</i>

577
01:03:35,453 --> 01:03:37,318
Yeah, take her home.

578
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:49,323
- Thought of another one.
- Yeah.

579
01:03:49,434 --> 01:03:53,700
I traveled from Ecuador to Lima, Peru
in a sewer pipe.

580
01:03:55,807 --> 01:04:00,642
<i>Forgot to mention that.
I hitchhiked once from Denver to Bolivia</i>

581
01:04:00,979 --> 01:04:05,143
<i>and back up,
and we got a ride from a truck in:.</i>

582
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:10,984
<i>It was a flatbed truck with three huge sewer
pipes on the back, so I spent:. It was days</i>

583
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:16,553
in the back of this truck, in a sewer pipe,
watching the world go by just like that.

584
01:04:16,661 --> 01:04:19,061
That's all you could see.

585
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:25,329
<i>TraveI for those who have been
deprived of freedom means even more.</i>

586
01:04:26,104 --> 01:04:29,437
<i>These are the ones you'll find in Antarctica.</i>

587
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:32,908
<i>Libor Zicha works as a utility mechanic.</i>

588
01:04:33,011 --> 01:04:36,174
<i>He lived like a prisoner
behind the Iron Curtain.</i>

589
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,144
You escaped.
And how big a drama was that?

590
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,711
<i>Oh, it was, wasn't a drama, but:.</i>

591
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:49,054
<i>The tragic events surrounding his escape
haunt him to this day.</i>

592
01:04:49,494 --> 01:04:51,758
<i>If we can:.</i>

593
01:04:54,365 --> 01:04:58,062
- You do not have to talk about it.
- Okay. Thank you.

594
01:04:59,037 --> 01:05:03,804
For me, the best description of
hunger is a description of bread.

595
01:05:04,943 --> 01:05:07,878
A poet said that once, I think,

596
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,943
and for me the best description of freedom
is what you have in front of you.

597
01:05:13,051 --> 01:05:14,382
You are traveling a lot.

598
01:05:14,485 --> 01:05:15,645
- That's right, yeah.
- Show us.

599
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:20,690
That's my freedom,
and I will be glad to show you.

600
01:05:23,428 --> 01:05:27,956
<i>He keeps a rucksack packed
and ready to go at all times.</i>

601
01:05:28,066 --> 01:05:33,333
<i>Inside is everything he needs
to set out in a moment's notice.</i>

602
01:05:33,438 --> 01:05:39,502
<i>a sleeping bag, a tent, clothes,
cooking utensils.</i>

603
01:05:42,246 --> 01:05:43,941
How much weight is this all?

604
01:05:44,048 --> 01:05:49,782
<i>It's:. I usually don't go over 20 kilos.
That's my limit,</i>

605
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:53,084
and it's a limit also for airlines.

606
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:01,829
<i>Some of the contents of his backpack
are quite surprising.</i>

607
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,215
That's about the size of the raft.

608
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:23,685
- How quickly can you leave?
- Oh, I am always ready.

609
01:06:23,821 --> 01:06:30,693
My bag is always prepared,
and I am always ready for adventure

610
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:34,564
and exploring new horizons.

611
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:44,770
<i>Back in the days of Amundsen,
Scott and Shackleton,</i>

612
01:06:45,076 --> 01:06:48,637
<i>scientific exploration of Antarctica began,</i>

613
01:06:48,746 --> 01:06:53,445
<i>and this opening of the unknown continent
is their great achievement.</i>

614
01:06:56,487 --> 01:07:01,015
<i>But one thing about the early explorers
does not feeI right.</i>

615
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:07,689
<i>The obsession to be the first one
to set his foot on the South Pole.</i>

616
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:14,628
<i>It was for personaI fame
and the glory of the British Empire.</i>

617
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:21,644
<i>This is Shackleton's originaI hut,
preserved unchanged for 100 years.</i>

618
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:28,815
<i>But, in a way, from the South Pole onwards</i>

619
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,718
<i>there was no further expansion possible,</i>

620
01:07:31,823 --> 01:07:36,556
<i>and the Empire started to fade
into the abyss of history.</i>

621
01:07:38,996 --> 01:07:42,762
<i>It all looks now like an extinct supermarket.</i>

622
01:07:50,975 --> 01:07:54,604
<i>On a culturaI leveI,
it meant the end of adventure.</i>

623
01:07:56,247 --> 01:08:01,116
<i>Exposing the last unknown spots
of this Earth was irreversible,</i>

624
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,580
<i>but it feels sad
that the South Pole or Mount Everest</i>

625
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:08,750
<i>were not left in peace in their dignity.</i>

626
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:16,890
<i>It may be a futile wish
to keep a few white spots on our maps,</i>

627
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:22,072
<i>but human adventure, in its originaI sense,
lost its meaning,</i>

628
01:08:22,173 --> 01:08:26,075
<i>became an issue for the
Guinness Book of World Records.</i>

629
01:08:30,748 --> 01:08:34,844
<i>Scott and Amundsen
were clearly early protagonists,</i>

630
01:08:35,186 --> 01:08:39,384
<i>and from there on
it degenerated into absurd quests.</i>

631
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:44,885
<i>A Frenchman crossed the Sahara Desert
in his car set in reverse gear,</i>

632
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:49,595
<i>and I am waiting for the first barefoot runner
on the summit of Everest</i>

633
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:54,262
<i>or the first one hopping into the South Pole
on a pogo stick.</i>

634
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:01,171
<i>Well, I had this idea of breaking
a Guinness record in every continent,</i>

635
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:03,473
and Antarctica would be the sixth,

636
01:09:03,948 --> 01:09:07,714
so, now I'm trying to think of a way
to get to Antarctica.

637
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:11,311
<i>Ashrita Furman did not want
to traveI this way,</i>

638
01:09:11,422 --> 01:09:15,415
<i>because he already holds a
Guinness record in this discipline.</i>

639
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:18,223
<i>And also in this one.</i>

640
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:23,357
<i>So, he decided upon the more prosaic
approach and took an airplane.</i>

641
01:09:23,668 --> 01:09:25,260
We flew down to Antarctica.

642
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,462
Anyway, it was thrilling
because I'm in Antarctica,

643
01:09:27,572 --> 01:09:29,472
<i>and I'm trying to break a Guinness record.</i>

644
01:09:29,574 --> 01:09:31,906
Being in Antarctica
is like being on the moon.

645
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:36,105
<i>It's so:. I mean, it's so peaceful.
It's so pure.</i>

646
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:39,672
It's so desolate.
I mean, it's just a great place.

647
01:09:44,856 --> 01:09:49,589
<i>Antarctica is not the moon,
even though sometimes it feels like it.</i>

648
01:09:51,963 --> 01:09:53,487
<i>Yet, on this planet,</i>

649
01:09:53,598 --> 01:09:58,558
<i>McMurdo comes closest to what
a future space settlement would look like.</i>

650
01:10:08,646 --> 01:10:12,776
<i>We left McMurdo for the penguin colony
at Cape Royds.</i>

651
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:15,809
<i>Everyone spoke about penguins,</i>

652
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,823
<i>however, the questions I had
were not so easily answered.</i>

653
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:26,262
<i>I was referred to a penguin expert out there</i>

654
01:10:26,564 --> 01:10:29,328
<i>who had studied them for almost 20 years.</i>

655
01:10:31,302 --> 01:10:34,169
<i>I was told that he was a taciturn man,</i>

656
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:39,574
<i>who, in his solitude, was not much into
conversation with humans anymore.</i>

657
01:10:40,244 --> 01:10:43,771
<i>But Dr: Ainley gave his best effort.</i>

658
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:46,441
Well, here we are at Cape Royds.

659
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:52,784
This is 2006,
and it's just about the 100th anniversary

660
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:57,156
of the first penguin study
that was ever done,

661
01:10:57,428 --> 01:11:00,329
which was done here at Cape Royds by

662
01:11:00,431 --> 01:11:03,400
<i>a person that was part
of the Shackleton expedition.</i>

663
01:11:07,004 --> 01:11:10,963
They all had a good winter,
and they're very fat.

664
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:13,309
They've

665
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:19,142
claimed their territories and eggs have
been laid and females have left,

666
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:23,482
and now there's just males
that are sitting on eggs,

667
01:11:24,689 --> 01:11:28,921
using their fat reserves
and waiting for females to return

668
01:11:29,026 --> 01:11:31,893
to relieve them and then go to sea.

669
01:11:34,265 --> 01:11:37,063
<i>I tried to keep the conversation going.</i>

670
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:41,995
Dr. Ainley, I read somewhere
that there are gay penguins.

671
01:11:42,573 --> 01:11:44,564
What are your observations?

672
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,780
<i>I've never:.</i>

673
01:11:52,249 --> 01:11:55,309
<i>Or strange sexual behavior.
Can you talk about:.</i>

674
01:11:55,453 --> 01:12:00,891
<i>Yeah, there has been:. I've seen
triangular relationships where there's</i>

675
01:12:01,993 --> 01:12:06,396
one female and two males,
and the female lays the egg,

676
01:12:07,898 --> 01:12:13,063
or eggs, and the males and the female
trade off over the season.

677
01:12:15,806 --> 01:12:22,678
There are mis-identities, initially,
of the sex of penguins.

678
01:12:25,116 --> 01:12:29,382
Somebody recently described
what they call prostitution where

679
01:12:30,855 --> 01:12:35,724
<i>a female, who is out
collecting rocks for her nest,</i>

680
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:38,192
<i>and, of course, some penguins are:.</i>

681
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:40,729
<i>The only way they collect rocks
is to steaI them from others.</i>

682
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:43,959
<i>So, in order to do that,
they have to be very submissive</i>

683
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:49,364
in order to get close to a male,
who's maybe advertising for a mate,

684
01:12:49,473 --> 01:12:56,106
and so she'll come in, sit in his nest,
and sometimes they'll copulate.

685
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:59,543
But, really, her idea is to get a rock,

686
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:03,416
and so, as soon as she can,
she escapes with a rock.

687
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:12,424
Dr. Ainley, is there such thing
as insanity among penguins?

688
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:17,360
I try to avoid the definition of insanity
or derangement.

689
01:13:17,468 --> 01:13:22,804
<i>I don't mean that a penguin
might believe he or she is Lenin</i>

690
01:13:22,907 --> 01:13:27,367
<i>or Napoleon Bonaparte,
but could they just go crazy</i>

691
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:30,572
<i>because they've had enough of
their colony?</i>

692
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:39,050
Well, I've never seen a penguin
bashing its head against a rock.

693
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:43,691
They do get disoriented.

694
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:48,026
<i>They end up in places they shouldn't be,
a long way from the ocean.</i>

695
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:57,335
<i>These penguins are all heading
to the open water to the right.</i>

696
01:14:01,579 --> 01:14:05,675
<i>But one of them caught our eye,
the one in the center.</i>

697
01:14:06,884 --> 01:14:11,378
<i>He would neither go towards the feeding
grounds at the edge of the ice,</i>

698
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,753
<i>nor return to the colony.</i>

699
01:14:15,759 --> 01:14:20,458
<i>Shortly afterwards, we saw him heading
straight towards the mountains,</i>

700
01:14:20,564 --> 01:14:22,589
<i>some 70 kilometers away.</i>

701
01:14:25,369 --> 01:14:29,066
<i>Dr: Ainley explained
that even if he caught him</i>

702
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,334
<i>and brought him back to the colony,</i>

703
01:14:31,442 --> 01:14:35,606
<i>he would immediately head right back
for the mountains.</i>

704
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:39,414
<i>But why?</i>

705
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:53,990
<i>One of these disoriented,
or deranged, penguins</i>

706
01:14:54,331 --> 01:14:57,061
<i>showed up at the New Harbor diving camp,</i>

707
01:14:57,168 --> 01:15:00,934
<i>already some 80 kilometers away
from where it should be.</i>

708
01:15:05,776 --> 01:15:10,713
<i>The rules for the humans
are do not disturb or hold up the penguin.</i>

709
01:15:10,814 --> 01:15:14,750
<i>Stand still and let him go on his way.</i>

710
01:15:18,322 --> 01:15:23,385
<i>And here, he's heading off into the interior
of the vast continent.</i>

711
01:15:24,428 --> 01:15:29,695
<i>With 5,000 kilometers ahead of him,
he's heading towards certain death.</i>

712
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:46,240
<i>The last field camp we visited
was at Mount Erebus.</i>

713
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:51,253
<i>This active volcano is 12,500 feet high.</i>

714
01:15:52,556 --> 01:15:57,994
<i>It is of particular importance, as inside
the crater the magma of the inner earth</i>

715
01:15:58,195 --> 01:16:00,220
<i>is directly exposed.</i>

716
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:05,231
<i>There are only two other such volcanoes
in the world,</i>

717
01:16:05,703 --> 01:16:09,662
<i>one in the Congo and the other in Ethiopia.</i>

718
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:13,267
<i>Because of politicaI strife in those places,</i>

719
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:18,178
<i>it is actually easier to conduct field studies
here in Antarctica.</i>

720
01:16:20,084 --> 01:16:25,078
<i>First thing, we were instructed in
the etiquette of dealing with this volcano.</i>

721
01:16:26,023 --> 01:16:30,119
One very important thing to keep in mind
when you're on the crater

722
01:16:30,227 --> 01:16:34,527
is that the lava lake
could explode at any time,

723
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:40,434
and if it does, it's vital to keep
your attention faced toward the lava lake

724
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:44,805
and watch for bombs
that are tracking up into the air

725
01:16:44,942 --> 01:16:50,005
and try to pick out the ones that might be
coming toward you and step out of the way.

726
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:55,915
The last thing you wanna do is turn away
from the crater or run or crouch down.

727
01:16:56,053 --> 01:17:00,513
Keep your attention toward the lava lake,
look up and move out of the way.

728
01:17:02,459 --> 01:17:07,453
<i>We were fortunate that the lava
lake was not enshrouded in mist this day.</i>

729
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,824
<i>This here is the new observation camera.</i>

730
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:17,873
<i>William Mclntosh is the leader
of the team of volcanologists here.</i>

731
01:17:18,976 --> 01:17:22,969
This camera is designed for prison riots
or to be explosion proof,

732
01:17:23,447 --> 01:17:26,974
and it's coated with this thick
Teflon housing.

733
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:31,087
Here's the lens here. This is a camera.

734
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:37,222
The camera inside is made by a small
company in Canada, Extreme CCTV.

735
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:41,028
<i>The inside housing is specifically
designed for explosion:.</i>

736
01:17:42,466 --> 01:17:43,455
<i>:.to be explosion-proof.</i>

737
01:17:43,567 --> 01:17:47,697
There's a bang from the lava lake
right now. No bombs, though.

738
01:17:55,579 --> 01:17:58,878
<i>This is the magma lake
filmed 30 years ago.</i>

739
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:06,415
<i>At that time, there was a bold attempt
to descend into the crater.</i>

740
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:18,395
<i>Halfway down there is a plateau.</i>

741
01:18:18,702 --> 01:18:23,002
<i>From there, it is a gaping hole straight down
into the magma.</i>

742
01:18:43,293 --> 01:18:46,091
<i>They were in for near disaster.</i>

743
01:18:56,273 --> 01:19:02,610
<i>The magma exploded, striking one of the
climbers, who got away with minor injuries.</i>

744
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:15,520
<i>Today, the lava is monitored
by Dr: Mclntosh's camera.</i>

745
01:19:47,624 --> 01:19:52,561
<i>Dr: Clive Oppenheimer, a true Englishman
from Cambridge University,</i>

746
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:58,499
<i>surprised us with his tweed outfit, which
he wears as a tribute to the explorers of old.</i>

747
01:19:59,636 --> 01:20:04,130
<i>He analyzes gas emissions
from volcanoes all over the world.</i>

748
01:20:04,741 --> 01:20:07,801
If this were one of those active
volcanoes in Indonesia,

749
01:20:07,911 --> 01:20:11,312
I'd be far more circumspect
about standing on the crater rim.

750
01:20:11,415 --> 01:20:14,316
This is a very benign form of volcanism,

751
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:20,487
and even the eruptions we've seen in the
historic period are relatively minor affairs.

752
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:23,722
If we go back into the geological record,

753
01:20:23,827 --> 01:20:25,590
we see that there are huge

754
01:20:26,763 --> 01:20:30,824
volcanic eruptions,
massive, explosive eruptions that produced

755
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,336
thousands of cubic miles of pumice,

756
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:37,237
showering large parts of the Earth
with fine ash,

757
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:41,701
and these have been demonstrated
to have had a strong impact on climate,

758
01:20:42,179 --> 01:20:45,671
and one of the biggest of these events,
74,000 years ago,

759
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:49,177
has been argued even to have affected
our human ancestors

760
01:20:49,286 --> 01:20:51,186
<i>and may have played an important role in</i>

761
01:20:51,555 --> 01:20:54,991
<i>the origins and dispersaI of early humans.</i>

762
01:20:58,328 --> 01:21:02,526
So these events will recur, and I think
the more we understand about them,

763
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:07,161
the better we can prepare for
their eventuality.

764
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:17,069
<i>For this and many other reasons,
our presence on this planet</i>

765
01:21:17,314 --> 01:21:20,147
<i>does not seem to be sustainable.</i>

766
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:25,244
<i>Our technologicaI civilization makes us
particularly vulnerable.</i>

767
01:21:26,723 --> 01:21:31,251
<i>There is talk all over the scientific
community about climate change.</i>

768
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:37,464
<i>Many of them agree the end of human life
on this Earth is assured.</i>

769
01:21:40,537 --> 01:21:44,303
<i>Human life is part of
an endless chain of catastrophes,</i>

770
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:48,973
<i>the demise of the dinosaurs being just
one of these events.</i>

771
01:21:50,647 --> 01:21:52,877
<i>We seem to be next.</i>

772
01:21:59,022 --> 01:22:04,289
<i>And when we are gone, what will happen
thousands of years from now in the future?</i>

773
01:22:07,731 --> 01:22:11,167
<i>Will there be alien archeologists
from another planet</i>

774
01:22:11,501 --> 01:22:15,733
<i>trying to find out what we were doing
at the South Pole?</i>

775
01:22:18,075 --> 01:22:22,910
<i>They will descend into the tunnels
that we had dug deep under the pole.</i>

776
01:22:25,082 --> 01:22:30,850
<i>It is still minus 70 degrees here,
and that's why this place has outlived</i>

777
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,513
<i>all the large cities in the world.</i>

778
01:22:37,194 --> 01:22:39,094
<i>They walk on and on.</i>

779
01:22:58,782 --> 01:23:00,306
<i>And then this.</i>

780
01:23:00,884 --> 01:23:05,787
<i>As if we had wanted to leave one remnant
of our presence on this planet,</i>

781
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:10,793
<i>they would find a frozen sturgeon,
mysteriously hidden away</i>

782
01:23:11,294 --> 01:23:15,321
<i>beneath the mathematically precise
true South Pole.</i>

783
01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:41,156
<i>They stash it back away
into its frozen shrine for another eternity.</i>

784
01:23:44,428 --> 01:23:48,524
<i>And then they find more,
memories of a world once green.</i>

785
01:23:52,135 --> 01:23:57,402
<i>As if the human race wanted to preserve
at least some lost beauty of this Earth,</i>

786
01:23:57,874 --> 01:24:02,277
<i>they left this,
framed in a garland of frozen popcorn.</i>

787
01:24:12,656 --> 01:24:15,250
<i>Back at the base camp of Mount Erebus,</i>

788
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:22,657
<i>due to the considerable altitude,</i>

789
01:24:22,999 --> 01:24:26,901
<i>once in a while the volcanologists
need medicaI care.</i>

790
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:33,601
<i>But soon we find them back at work.</i>

791
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:43,803
My face is frozen.

792
01:26:23,486 --> 01:26:25,454
Quite cold up here today.

793
01:26:31,595 --> 01:26:36,430
Just by having that fantastic lava lake
down there with all that energy,

794
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:41,603
we still have to bring old petrol generators
up to the crater rim.

795
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:59,116
<i>Man versus Machine, Chapter 53.
Professor Clive Oppenheimer on Erebus.</i>

796
01:27:01,224 --> 01:27:05,422
Hands in pockets,
waiting for it to start spontaneously.

797
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:09,162
He could be waiting a long time.

798
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,468
Have you ever seen two men kiss
on the top of Erebus before?

799
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:17,997
Pushing back the frontiers.

800
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:19,735
It's R-18, okay?

801
01:27:22,312 --> 01:27:24,303
I like working with Harry.

802
01:27:29,419 --> 01:27:31,785
<i>Along the slopes of the volcano</i>

803
01:27:32,022 --> 01:27:38,154
<i>there are vents where steam creates
so-called fumaroles, bizarre chimneys of ice,</i>

804
01:27:38,495 --> 01:27:41,430
<i>sometimes reaching two stories in height.</i>

805
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:52,366
<i>It is possible to descend into some of them.</i>

806
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:59,647
<i>You only have to be carefuI
to avoid the ones containing toxic gasses.</i>

807
01:31:11,474 --> 01:31:14,875
<i>At the foot of Erebus, out on the sea ice,</i>

808
01:31:14,978 --> 01:31:18,846
<i>the two tallest buildings on this continent
are located.</i>

809
01:31:19,582 --> 01:31:23,450
<i>In these hangars,
scientific payloads are being readied</i>

810
01:31:23,586 --> 01:31:26,612
<i>for their balloon launch
into the stratosphere.</i>

811
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:44,268
<i>We were interested in
the neutrino detection project.</i>

812
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:48,037
<i>Scientists are planning
to lift an observation instrument</i>

813
01:31:48,144 --> 01:31:51,409
<i>40 kilometers up into the stratosphere</i>

814
01:31:51,514 --> 01:31:55,575
<i>in search of almost
undetectable subatomic particles.</i>

815
01:32:02,025 --> 01:32:07,088
<i>As it rises, this small-looking bubble
of helium will expand</i>

816
01:32:07,263 --> 01:32:11,757
<i>to fill the entire skin,
which here still looks like a white rope.</i>

817
01:32:12,802 --> 01:32:18,468
<i>It will eventually form a gigantic globe
more than 300 feet in diameter.</i>

818
01:32:20,677 --> 01:32:22,770
<i>When it reaches the stratosphere,</i>

819
01:32:22,879 --> 01:32:26,872
<i>the detector will scan
thousands of square miles of ice</i>

820
01:32:26,983 --> 01:32:31,750
<i>without encountering electricaI
disturbances from the inhabited world.</i>

821
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:37,256
<i>Prior to the launch,
we were inside the hangar.</i>

822
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:42,263
<i>The neutrino project is led by
Dr: Gorham of the University of Hawaii.</i>

823
01:32:42,498 --> 01:32:48,061
So, what we're trying to do
with this instrument is to be the first

824
01:32:48,171 --> 01:32:53,234
scientific group to detect the highest
energy neutrinos in the universe, we hope.

825
01:32:53,743 --> 01:32:57,543
Yeah, but, Dr. Gorham,
what exactly is a neutrino?

826
01:32:58,214 --> 01:33:02,981
<i>The neutrino is:. It's the most ridiculous
particle you could imagine.</i>

827
01:33:03,219 --> 01:33:07,315
A billion neutrinos went through my nose
as we were talking.

828
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:10,991
A trillion, a trillion of them
went through my nose just now,

829
01:33:11,094 --> 01:33:12,857
and they did nothing to me.

830
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:16,659
They pass through all of the matter
around us continuously,

831
01:33:16,933 --> 01:33:22,098
in a huge, huge blast of particles
that does nothing at all.

832
01:33:22,405 --> 01:33:26,273
<i>They're like:.
They almost exist in a separate universe,</i>

833
01:33:26,376 --> 01:33:28,469
but we know, as physicists,
we can measure them,

834
01:33:28,578 --> 01:33:32,947
we can make precision predictions
and measurements. They exist,

835
01:33:33,049 --> 01:33:35,711
but we can't get our hands on them,

836
01:33:35,818 --> 01:33:38,651
because they seem to just exist
in another place,

837
01:33:39,088 --> 01:33:44,048
and yet without neutrinos, the beginning
of the universe would not have worked.

838
01:33:44,294 --> 01:33:46,819
We would not have the matter
that we have today,

839
01:33:46,929 --> 01:33:49,864
because you couldn't create
the elements without the neutrinos.

840
01:33:49,966 --> 01:33:53,527
In the very, very earliest few seconds
of the big bang,

841
01:33:53,636 --> 01:33:57,197
the neutrinos were the dominant particle,
and they actually determined

842
01:33:57,307 --> 01:34:01,801
much of the kinetics of the production
of the elements we know.

843
01:34:01,911 --> 01:34:04,937
So, the universe can't exist the way it is
without the neutrinos,

844
01:34:05,081 --> 01:34:08,642
but they seem
to be in their own separate universe,

845
01:34:08,751 --> 01:34:11,720
and we're trying to actually
make contact with that

846
01:34:11,821 --> 01:34:14,415
otherworldly universe of neutrinos.

847
01:34:15,591 --> 01:34:19,083
And as a physicist, even though

848
01:34:20,063 --> 01:34:24,124
I understand it mathematically
and I understand it intellectually,

849
01:34:24,267 --> 01:34:26,360
it still hits me in the gut

850
01:34:26,936 --> 01:34:30,337
that there is something here around

851
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:34,240
surrounding me almost like
some kind of spirit or god

852
01:34:34,344 --> 01:34:36,175
that I can't touch,

853
01:34:36,512 --> 01:34:39,072
but I can measure it.

854
01:34:39,182 --> 01:34:40,308
I can make a measurement.

855
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:43,681
It's like measuring the spirit world
or something like that.

856
01:34:43,786 --> 01:34:46,346
You can go out and touch these things.

857
01:34:47,857 --> 01:34:52,351
<i>Not surprisingly, we found
this incantation in Hawaiian language</i>

858
01:34:52,462 --> 01:34:54,396
<i>on the side of his detector.</i>

859
01:34:55,131 --> 01:34:58,464
<i>It was as if spirits had to be invoked.</i>

860
01:35:00,536 --> 01:35:04,472
<i>What would we see if we could film
the impact of a neutrino?</i>

861
01:35:05,475 --> 01:35:10,606
What you would see is, you would see
a lightning bolt about 10 meters long,

862
01:35:10,913 --> 01:35:12,847
about that thick,

863
01:35:12,949 --> 01:35:17,249
and it would blast at the speed of light
over this 10 meter distance,

864
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:21,153
and you would see the most beautiful
blue light your eyes have ever seen.

865
01:35:21,324 --> 01:35:23,383
<i>It happens in about:.</i>

866
01:35:25,728 --> 01:35:28,492
The entire impulse of radio waves

867
01:35:28,598 --> 01:35:32,159
is up and down in probably

868
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:35,760
one one-hundred billionth of a second.

869
01:35:36,539 --> 01:35:40,942
It just goes bang and it's gone,
and that's what we're looking for.

870
01:36:09,138 --> 01:36:13,199
There is a beautiful saying by an American,

871
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:20,382
a philosopher, Alan Watts,
and he used to say that through our eyes,

872
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,084
the universe is perceiving itself,

873
01:36:23,553 --> 01:36:28,183
and through our ears, the universe
is listening to its cosmic harmonies,

874
01:36:28,624 --> 01:36:33,027
and we are the witness
through which the universe

875
01:36:34,096 --> 01:36:37,588
becomes conscious of its glory,
of its magnificence.
