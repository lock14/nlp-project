00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:24,537
"She knew a trick.

1
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:29,675
"She knew how to turn her life into a movie
and watch things happen.

2
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:35,545
"Not to her,
but to a girl who looked just like her.

3
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:37,922
"Was she the runaway

4
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:41,790
"with everything she owned
in a ratty old backpack?

5
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:46,127
"Or, was she watching a movie about
a hitchhiking runaway on a lonely highway?

6
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:51,062
"A truck slowed till the girl squinted
in his headlights.

7
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,463
"But one good look at her

8
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:55,700
"and the trucker couldn't get out of there
fast enough.

9
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:58,637
"She didn't even have the strength
to curse him

10
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:02,010
"as she choked on the dust
of his spinning wheels."

11
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:58,367
I'm sorry, Mr. Norquist.
I know I should have this by now.

12
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:00,462
You've been distracted lately, Aubrey.

13
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,272
The next Young Artist Competition
is less than a month away.

14
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,603
I know. I know.

15
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,779
Watch this hand.

16
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,236
You see how easy?

17
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,098
Yeah.

18
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,172
I've been meaning to talk to you.

19
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:40,609
You know, I've been thinking, and...

20
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:45,140
I just... I don't know if I'm cut out
to play piano anymore.

21
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:49,986
Aubrey, all artists feel that way. Iùs normal.

22
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,558
No, I... I want to quit.

23
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,796
I mean, I barely made my winter admit
to Yale, and I could still blow it.

24
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,790
I just need to concentrate
all of my efforts into writing.

25
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,960
But you have a gift, an innate talent.

26
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,300
You won the Young Artist Competition.

27
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:09,034
I mean, how much more validation
do you need?

28
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,804
That was a long time ago, Mr. Norquist.

29
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:22,816
Hi, you.

30
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,308
<i>"She always felt like half a person.</i>

31
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:21,744
<i>"Half a person with half a soul.</i>

32
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:26,342
<i>"Sometimes, if she dreamed hard enough,</i>
<i>she could bring the two halves together.</i>

33
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:30,514
<i>"But she always woke to the same feelings</i>
<i>of loneliness and loss. "</i>

34
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,560
- Hey.
- Hi.

35
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,969
Where'd you find a blue rose?

36
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,471
I passed a place on the street. Here.

37
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:48,871
Thank you.

38
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:55,375
You okay?

39
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,142
Yeah.

40
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,513
Got me.

41
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:19,061
Sheriff, several federal agents
were seen entering city hall

42
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:21,606
- about an hour ago.
- Why has the coroner's report been sealed?

43
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,936
- Sheriff! Jennifer Toland...
- Please.

44
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,066
...disappeared almost two months ago.

45
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:25,804
Serial killers typically...

46
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:28,472
We have one dead girl,
and you're talking serial killer!

47
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,709
- You people astound me.
- Could you just give us a name?

48
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,249
Who has not yet found the aortic arches?

49
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,391
And the super-pharyngeal ganglia?

50
00:08:41,394 --> 00:08:42,486
The brain.

51
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,857
Yes, you can barely see that,
even under the microscope.

52
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,096
Is that all I am to you?

53
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:53,229
Just something to relax you
before the game?

54
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,035
If I cut a worm in half,
will it become two worms?

55
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:58,303
No, Pete, thaùs a myth.

56
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:02,880
Whaùs it gonna take for me and you
to be together?

57
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:05,041
A lot more than one blue rose.

58
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:08,143
Aubrey, I think I'm falling in love with you.

59
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:12,214
We barely know each other, Jerrod.

60
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,384
- You're delusional.
- No, I'm not.

61
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:17,361
I've never felt this way about a girl before.

62
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:18,862
- I just keep thinking about you and...
- Jerrod!

63
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:22,628
Can you point out for me
the female reproductive organs?

64
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:24,764
The seminal receptacles.

65
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,668
Yes, I can, actually.

66
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:31,869
That should be it.

67
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:39,274
Those would be
the male reproductive organs.

68
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,920
The female organs are at the other end
of the worm.

69
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:51,620
Looks like you need a little more experience
in the female anatomy.

70
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,200
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.

71
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:08,713
Jennifer TolanÔs body was discovered
early this morning.

72
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:13,680
Please don't ask me any questions.
I don't have the details.

73
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:25,193
<i>Nineteen-year-old female, 5'4 " tall.</i>

74
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,931
<i>Amputation of individual digits,</i>

75
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,668
<i>possibly on the same or successive days.</i>

76
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:42,278
<i>Full metacarpal amputation</i>
<i>approximately two weeks later.</i>

77
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:48,845
<i>Ragged cuts indicate</i>

78
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:54,689
<i>near-lethal levels of amphetamines</i>
<i>inducing a state of forced alertness,</i>

79
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:58,662
<i>suggesting the killer wanted the victim</i>

80
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:01,563
<i>fully conscious during each limb removal.</i>

81
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,806
<i>As we all know,</i>
<i>Jennifer TolanÔs body was found this week.</i>

82
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:25,281
<i>And we'd like to take a moment of silence.</i>

83
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:35,325
<i>Now, leùs get out there</i>
<i>and win this one for Jennifer Tolandl</i>

84
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:49,340
Come on!

85
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:34,710
<i>Curfew is one hour away.</i>

86
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:38,951
<i>Attention, curfew, for under 21,</i>
<i>begins in one hour.</i>

87
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:42,853
Why are you...

88
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:44,759
Just marry him
and start popping out babies.

89
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:47,890
No way. I'm done sleeping with guys
I'm not in love with.

90
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,901
Oh, like you were some kind
of a sex addict before.

91
00:13:51,003 --> 00:13:52,265
But Jerrod loves you.

92
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:57,070
I'll be 3,000 miles away in January.
I mean, I can't afford to fall in love.

93
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:58,143
Thaùs nice.

94
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:02,237
<i>Iùs like someone could stab you</i>
<i>and you'd never even know what...</i>

95
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:04,714
Iùs like Mardi Gras or something.

96
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:09,015
Yeah, I read this story about this killer
who sits behind people in movies

97
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:11,851
and stabs them with a needle right here.

98
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,619
You die like instantly.

99
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:16,593
Nobody even knows you're dead
until the movie's over and you don't get up.

100
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,027
Iùs so creep...

101
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,328
Beat them, baby! Owls, number one!
Leùs do this! Yeah!

102
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:23,402
Oh, my God!

103
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:25,595
Oh, so weird!

104
00:14:25,705 --> 00:14:27,502
Everybody is insanely crazy.

105
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:30,098
- Hey!
- Hey!

106
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:31,642
I'm looking for Jerrod.

107
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:34,372
- Oh, good luck.
- Oh, there he is! Jerrod!

108
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,141
- Jerrod!
- Aubrey, wait!

109
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,979
I'll meet you in front of the Fremont at 11:45.

110
00:14:39,518 --> 00:14:40,712
Jerrod!

111
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:08,340
Aubrey?

112
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:11,677
Aubrey!

113
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:14,813
Aubrey!

114
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:19,182
Okay, so I am officially freaking out.

115
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,193
I'm just gonna try her cell again,
and you've got to try Jerrod.

116
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,387
Okay.

117
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,694
- I think iùs coming from over here!
- Don't hang up your phone!

118
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:32,395
- Hello? Hey.
- Iùs me.

119
00:15:32,505 --> 00:15:34,029
Where's Aubrey?

120
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,898
What?

121
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,344
Okay, where did she park?

122
00:15:40,446 --> 00:15:42,277
Where'd she park her car?

123
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:44,713
- Come on, you rode with her.
- Yeah, it was on that street.

124
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:47,581
- Iùs that street, you know the one.
- No. No, I don't know the one.

125
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,314
- Tell me.
- Yeah, I do. Iùs in front

126
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,482
- of the little art gallery with the gate.
- Yeah.

127
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:54,555
- Wait!
- Wait a second!

128
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,058
There it is! There's her car!

129
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:25,745
Help!

130
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:26,875
No!

131
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:30,779
No!

132
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,361
She...

133
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:41,433
She lives on this thing.

134
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,724
Iùs her life.

135
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:46,666
Writing.

136
00:17:48,007 --> 00:17:49,736
She loves to write.

137
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:54,269
Mr. Fleming, I'm gonna have to
take that computer from you.

138
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,041
I need to make a copy of the hard drive.

139
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:58,639
Take it, please. Anything you need.

140
00:18:07,827 --> 00:18:09,089
Daniel,

141
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:13,224
is there any chance
that your daughter might have run away?

142
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:16,699
Was she unhappy about anything?

143
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,394
Aubrey? Unhappy?

144
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,707
No.

145
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:25,173
Not at all.

146
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,871
You sure about that?

147
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:31,616
Where were you
when Aubrey left for the game?

148
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:38,586
I was on a conference call,
so I was in the dining room, pacing.

149
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:41,091
You know, I always pace when I...

150
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:43,821
Do you remember saying goodbye to her?

151
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:48,156
Can you describe how she looked?

152
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:49,928
What her mood was?

153
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:03,946
You know, you don't always

154
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,573
think to take a mental picture
of your daughter

155
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:07,982
every time she leaves the house.

156
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:10,388
I used to do that, but...

157
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:14,585
"The Worrier," Daniel used to call me.

158
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,393
Do you have kids?

159
00:19:28,908 --> 00:19:30,773
It falls away, and...

160
00:19:33,846 --> 00:19:35,780
They always come back.

161
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:39,044
You know, they never don't come back.
It just...

162
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,056
Aubrey!

163
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,464
Aubrey!

164
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,388
Keep your eyes peeled!

165
00:22:30,155 --> 00:22:32,749
3:00 sharp? Yeah, good man.

166
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,726
Jesus.

167
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,095
Well, I hope our little investigation
doesn't interfere with bingo night.

168
00:23:11,363 --> 00:23:13,729
I feel like half a person, you know?

169
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:17,233
And, all of a sudden, it dawns on me,
this is Steve and Vicky.

170
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:19,702
Steve and Vicky this, Steve and Vicky that.

171
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:23,036
We're finishing each other's sentences here.

172
00:23:23,142 --> 00:23:26,077
Hell, we're finishing each other's thoughts.

173
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:51,126
Hey!

174
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:55,001
You okay?

175
00:23:57,509 --> 00:23:58,567
Hey!

176
00:24:08,554 --> 00:24:09,646
Yeah?

177
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,584
Susan!

178
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:15,159
Is she alive?

179
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:19,389
- Oh, God!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay. How bad?

180
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:36,211
Her blood pressure's increasing.

181
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,913
- She's fucking awake.
- For GoÔs sake.

182
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:42,043
Increasing her thiopental.

183
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:56,127
Orthopedic saw. Orthopedic saw, now.

184
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,872
Well! Hey, beautiful.

185
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:12,707
Nobody expected to see those eyes
for a while.

186
00:25:18,457 --> 00:25:21,085
- I'm in the hospital?
- You're safe now.

187
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:25,230
What hospital am I in? Where?

188
00:25:27,165 --> 00:25:28,132
I'll...

189
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,992
I'll get the doctor, okay?

190
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:47,780
Oh, my...

191
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,251
Oh, my God!

192
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:04,360
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

193
00:26:21,753 --> 00:26:23,118
Look, the press is asking questions.

194
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:27,021
- Now, I think what we should do...
- No, no, no. No comments, no leaks.

195
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:30,185
Aubrey Fleming is still missing
as far as the worlÔs concerned,

196
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:32,058
- and I want to keep it that way.
- Everyone at the hospital's

197
00:26:32,164 --> 00:26:34,632
been threatened with dismissal
and obstruction of justice charges

198
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,963
if they leak a word of this. We clear?

199
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,333
Plausible explanations. Okay.

200
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:42,839
Number one, he was done with her.
He left her on the side of the road to die.

201
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:45,535
But he didn't count on her will to live.

202
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:47,111
I don't buy it.

203
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,908
He wasn't done with Aubrey Fleming,
not by a long shot.

204
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:53,246
He only had her for what? 17, 18 days?

205
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:57,379
The sectioning was just getting started.
Her leg wasn't completely off.

206
00:26:57,489 --> 00:27:00,424
And why the hell would he sew her fingers
back onto her hand,

207
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:01,583
- and her hand back onto...
- But wait a minute.

208
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,183
Remember, Jennifer Toland drowned.

209
00:27:04,096 --> 00:27:06,758
I mean, now, iùs too early
for an accurate profile but...

210
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:10,033
I think the cutting is about punishment.

211
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:12,433
And when the punishment is over,

212
00:27:12,537 --> 00:27:15,904
he finds a way for the death to happen,
so he doesn't have to be there.

213
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:20,206
Now, he doesn't like the dying part,
but he's got to make sure it happens.

214
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,138
Dying freaks him out.

215
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:24,442
I think she escaped.

216
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:27,382
The only answer
that makes any sense to me.

217
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,414
Hey, honey pie.

218
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,324
Sure did miss you.

219
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:47,137
We're gonna have you home in no time,
and we can put all this behind us.

220
00:27:48,373 --> 00:27:49,362
Home?

221
00:27:49,474 --> 00:27:51,101
Isn't that right, Doctor?

222
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:53,302
Aubrey's been very brave.

223
00:27:53,412 --> 00:27:56,848
With any luck,
we'll have her out of the ICU tomorrow.

224
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,682
Who is Aubrey?

225
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:07,123
Who are you?

226
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:11,757
Who is...

227
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:13,660
- Who is Aubrey?
- No.

228
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,730
- Oh, my God.
- I don't...

229
00:28:17,836 --> 00:28:19,861
I just, I don't...

230
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,032
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.
Please, don't.

231
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:41,020
Aubrey Fleming,
session number one, 10:30 a.m.

232
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:44,358
I'm not Aubrey Fleming.

233
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:45,862
Then what should I call you?

234
00:28:45,964 --> 00:28:48,057
My real name would be nice.

235
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,965
Session number one, 10:30 a.m.

236
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:54,971
Dakota Moss.

237
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:57,507
Listen.

238
00:28:57,609 --> 00:29:01,545
I know I may look a little like
this Aubrey chick, or whatever her name is,

239
00:29:01,646 --> 00:29:04,877
but I'm not her, okay? I am not her.

240
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:08,210
Leùs get some housekeeping
out of the way first.

241
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:12,284
- Date of birth?
- June 9th, 1988.

242
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,358
Social Security number?

243
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:17,884
I don't have one.

244
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:21,464
Look, when you're raised by a crack addict
who thinks the less

245
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:24,194
that people know about you, the better,
it kind of sticks.

246
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:28,295
I made up a Social Security number
when I needed one,

247
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:31,705
but I couldn't keep a job long enough
for that to matter.

248
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,904
A job? You're fairly young to be working.

249
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:39,347
Yeah, well, I didn't grow up in New Salem.
I grew up in the real world.

250
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,518
You mentioned your mother.

251
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:44,021
Dead.

252
00:29:44,322 --> 00:29:45,721
How did your mother die?

253
00:29:46,158 --> 00:29:47,284
O.D.

254
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:51,629
How long ago?

255
00:29:55,967 --> 00:30:00,267
<i>Six, seven months ago.</i>
<i>We weren't really what you'd call close</i>

256
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:02,704
<i>since she'd started using again.</i>

257
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:07,074
<i>But I could always count on seeing</i>
<i>the palm of her hand on payday.</i>

258
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:11,309
<i>When she didn't come around,</i>
<i>I assumed she was dead.</i>

259
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:14,112
<i>Wasn't too hard to see that one coming.</i>

260
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:55,449
She was stupid.

261
00:30:57,028 --> 00:30:58,290
Pathetic.

262
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:01,098
And a junkie.

263
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,914
<i>Did your mother leave you anything?</i>

264
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,778
<i>Yeah. $11.</i>

265
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:35,388
Tell me something. Why does a shrink need
your Social Security number?

266
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:38,999
I like to have it for my files.

267
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,273
You're fuzz, aren't you?

268
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,944
I don't want to lie to you.

269
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:50,412
I am a psychiatrist,
but I also do work for the FBI.

270
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:52,346
I fucking knew it.

271
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,146
It doesn't mean I care any less
for the work we do here.

272
00:31:56,288 --> 00:32:00,247
You know, you're wasting your time
because I've got nothing to tell you.

273
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:03,725
In cases like these, there are specific details
that we withhold from the public

274
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:07,889
to separate the serial confessors
from the serial killer.

275
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:11,093
The pattern of your injuries is identical.
Not similar,

276
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,539
identical, with another young girl.

277
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,972
A murdered girl, from New Salem.

278
00:32:20,078 --> 00:32:21,340
Prove it.

279
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:35,492
Oh, my God.

280
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,792
Hello, Mrs. Fleming.

281
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:42,524
Hey.

282
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:45,034
Hi.

283
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:48,867
I brought some of your things
to make you feel more at home.

284
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:55,010
This is Mr. Gervais.

285
00:33:02,587 --> 00:33:03,952
All right.

286
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:08,458
Look, I'm sure you're a very nice woman.
Really. But I don't have a home.

287
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,996
And, yeah, I just want to know
when I get to get out of here.

288
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:17,194
You don't remember Mr. Gervais
and sleeping with him?

289
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,262
Nope.

290
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:26,874
And this is some of your...

291
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:31,481
Some... Some of Aubrey's favorite music,
on that.

292
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,944
Now, where are... Shit.

293
00:33:35,987 --> 00:33:38,080
How could I forget the earphones?

294
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:42,492
This was the most important thing in here.

295
00:33:42,594 --> 00:33:45,085
You love your music, and, you know,

296
00:33:45,196 --> 00:33:48,688
they use music to help
people come out of comas.

297
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,394
Do I look like I'm in a fucking coma?

298
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:01,036
What else you got in the bag?

299
00:34:01,146 --> 00:34:03,307
Whaùs that? Is it a picture?

300
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:04,404
Yeah.

301
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:07,916
<i>Dr. Mancuso to the ER.</i>
<i>Dr. Mancuso to the ER.</i>

302
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:09,111
Here.

303
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:15,620
Where...

304
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:18,326
Who gave you this?

305
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:19,993
Is something happening?

306
00:34:21,833 --> 00:34:23,164
When I was a little girl, I...

307
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:25,793
You were seven.

308
00:34:25,904 --> 00:34:28,429
We all went to Hawaii for Christmas.

309
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:34,310
The pictures are almost the same.

310
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:39,114
My bathing suit was different,
the water wasn't blue.

311
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:42,583
It was brown, actually.

312
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:44,848
And my mother took me there

313
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:47,151
as if it was some sort of treat or something

314
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:49,751
to watch freaking garbage float.

315
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,327
What is it, honey?

316
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:02,402
A lot of little girls look alike, I guess.

317
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,611
Whaùs this?

318
00:35:13,251 --> 00:35:15,276
You've got to understand that we are trying

319
00:35:15,386 --> 00:35:17,718
- to help your daughter, Mrs. Fleming.
- This is what you call help?

320
00:35:17,822 --> 00:35:20,655
- This isn't help. This is just more torture.
- I have full authority

321
00:35:20,758 --> 00:35:22,225
- to conduct this investigation...
- Don't!

322
00:35:22,327 --> 00:35:24,352
...in any way I see fit.
- You do not have full authority.

323
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:26,589
- I'm trying to prevent it happening...
- Hasn't she suffered enough?

324
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:28,393
...to another girl and mother...
- Are you just trying...

325
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,626
...because it will...
...to prolong our pain?

326
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:32,703
...Mrs. Fleming. It will.
- My God, where is your sympathy?

327
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:35,796
Your daughter is lucky to be alive,
but she will not be safe

328
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:39,809
until whoever did this to her is behind bars.

329
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,203
She's not safe.

330
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:14,608
Dakota, this is Julie Bascombe
and Phil Lazarus.

331
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:18,079
Yeah, I've seen them around.
Two of my prison guards.

332
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:23,487
The security measures are all
for your own comfort, Dakota.

333
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:27,583
Dakota, who cut you?
Thaùs all we want to know.

334
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:33,023
Look, once he finds out you're still alive,
he's gonna come after you.

335
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:35,292
Now, we've done everything we can
to keep this out of the press,

336
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,630
but iùs bound to get out sooner or later.

337
00:36:37,735 --> 00:36:39,794
So, you're gonna use me as bait,
unless I cooperate.

338
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:41,633
Is that what you're saying?

339
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,770
Dakota, help us, please.
You saw the pictures of Jennifer.

340
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:50,439
The same person who cut her cut you.
You can't deny that.

341
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:55,081
What do you remember
about the past few weeks?

342
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:58,881
Everything.

343
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,153
Everything? Thaùs unusual.

344
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,387
Dakota, who did this to you?

345
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:06,889
I don't know.

346
00:37:06,998 --> 00:37:10,024
- Were you blindfolded?
- You were locked up?

347
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:12,295
It doesn't matter
if it doesn't make sense to you.

348
00:37:12,403 --> 00:37:14,633
We'll put the pieces together.

349
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,139
All right, so I got this new job. Night shift.

350
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,377
What kind of job?

351
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:30,182
A hostess.

352
00:37:30,288 --> 00:37:32,153
At a gentlemen's club.

353
00:37:33,524 --> 00:37:36,425
Don't care how old you really are, kiddo.

354
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:40,657
Your ID says you're 21,
you're fucking 21 to me.

355
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:47,436
<i>An exotic dancer,</i>
<i>thaùs what the hostess job turned out to be.</i>

356
00:39:34,379 --> 00:39:38,213
<i>He coulÔve been there</i>
<i>the first night I danced. I don't know.</i>

357
00:42:53,711 --> 00:42:55,679
Everything about him was just...

358
00:42:56,581 --> 00:42:59,573
I don't know, was intense.

359
00:43:01,586 --> 00:43:03,110
I never really got to see his face.

360
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,051
How do you know it was the same guy
from the club?

361
00:43:05,156 --> 00:43:08,648
- I just knew.
- Was he tall? Thin? Stocky? What?

362
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:14,087
He was wearing blue gloves.

363
00:43:14,198 --> 00:43:16,826
- The rubber kind that doctors wear.
- Are you sure?

364
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:19,425
Look, I'm not sure about anything, okay?

365
00:43:19,537 --> 00:43:21,095
What about when he cut you?

366
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:23,271
You didn't see him then?

367
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:28,704
- No.
- Look, he gave you drugs, Aubrey. Okay?

368
00:43:28,813 --> 00:43:30,246
To make you watch.

369
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:33,181
To keep you awake,
so you'd have to have seen something.

370
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:34,376
I don't lie.

371
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,212
If I tell you I didn't see him,
I didn't fucking see him.

372
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:39,346
How do you know it was the same guy
who cut you, then?

373
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:42,051
You're right. I don't know.

374
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,754
Aubrey, you have got to
stop playing games with us.

375
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:48,855
Am I making myself clear?
We have to know the truth.

376
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:51,332
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
You want to know the truth?

377
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:54,336
Well, what about me? You think I don't?

378
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:56,338
How the fuck would you feel?

379
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,672
Fingers, leg, hand, gone.
I practically fucking died.

380
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:03,975
And now, I'm locked up
in the fucking hospital

381
00:44:04,081 --> 00:44:06,049
like a goddamn prisoner!

382
00:44:35,413 --> 00:44:37,244
So, what are you saying, Doctor?

383
00:44:37,348 --> 00:44:41,444
I don't know.
Usually iùs easy to find the inconsistencies,

384
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:42,746
the holes in the fantasy.

385
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:45,549
Even in the most extreme cases
of posttraumatic stress,

386
00:44:45,656 --> 00:44:49,820
you get a tiny measure
of the original person.

387
00:44:49,927 --> 00:44:52,896
You know what I think, Doctor?
I think we're wasting our time.

388
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:55,591
- I think this kid is lying through her teeth.
- No.

389
00:44:57,268 --> 00:45:00,169
She's not lying. She's...

390
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,537
I don't think iùs that simple.

391
00:45:07,645 --> 00:45:09,135
She was withholding deliberately.

392
00:45:09,246 --> 00:45:10,213
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:11,941
I thought she just ran out of imagination.

394
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:14,108
Aubrey Fleming is not short on imagination.

395
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:15,480
- Thaùs for sure.
- Okay.

396
00:45:15,586 --> 00:45:20,489
So, she gets to a certain point in her story
and she stops talking. Why?

397
00:45:20,591 --> 00:45:24,254
Sometimes people create alter egos
to relay information

398
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:27,728
that their primary personalities
would never reveal.

399
00:45:27,832 --> 00:45:30,426
So, why would the alter ego withhold?

400
00:45:31,402 --> 00:45:32,369
I don't know.

401
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,636
I think she doesn't tell everybody
the whole story

402
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,935
because she doesn't think
anybody's gonna believe her.

403
00:45:38,042 --> 00:45:41,011
I mean, she's not even sure
she believes what happened to her.

404
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:58,051
<i>... unconfirmed reports tonight,</i>
<i>in this News 5 exclusive,</i>

405
00:45:58,963 --> 00:46:00,521
<i>that the abducted teen has been found</i>

406
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:04,123
<i>and has been secretly held</i>
<i>at New Salem Hospital for over a week.</i>

407
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:05,930
<i>- News 5 will continue to update you...</i>
- Shit.

408
00:46:06,036 --> 00:46:08,231
<i>... on this story as it develops.</i>

409
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:56,176
No. No!

410
00:46:56,287 --> 00:46:59,017
No! Get off, get him off me!

411
00:46:59,123 --> 00:47:02,991
Aubrey! What happened?
Sweetheart, what happened?

412
00:47:03,093 --> 00:47:04,287
Honey, what happened?
Who did this to you?

413
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:06,761
- Somebody come in here!
- Get off of me!

414
00:47:06,864 --> 00:47:09,230
Iùs okay, iùs Daddy. Iùs Daddy.
Iùs okay. Iùs Daddy.

415
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,858
Iùs all right.

416
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:14,437
- Calm down and back away, Mr. Fleming.
- Don't you fucking touch me!

417
00:47:14,538 --> 00:47:17,996
Somebody came in here and sliced up
my little girl. I want you to find him now!

418
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,471
No! No!

419
00:47:47,137 --> 00:47:48,900
I am Aubrey Fleming.

420
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:53,270
My name is Aubrey Fleming.

421
00:47:53,377 --> 00:47:57,177
I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach,
and playing the piano.

422
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:00,182
I have never seen the inside of a strip club
or a crack house,

423
00:48:00,284 --> 00:48:02,809
and I have never sold my body
to hairy old men with B.O.

424
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,717
because I am perfect.

425
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:14,163
Say hello to your new state-of-the-art hand.

426
00:48:21,772 --> 00:48:24,138
Your nerve impulses get picked up
by sensors

427
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:27,802
that control six different sets of gears
and motors inside the hand,

428
00:48:27,912 --> 00:48:31,780
so the movements are incredibly lifelike
and precise.

429
00:48:31,882 --> 00:48:33,474
Iùs so creepy.

430
00:48:33,584 --> 00:48:35,814
No. Iùs beautiful.

431
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,582
Once we're sure everything works
the way iùs supposed to,

432
00:48:38,689 --> 00:48:40,589
we'll fit this over it.

433
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:48,425
Lovely.

434
00:48:49,566 --> 00:48:51,033
Step forward.

435
00:48:55,005 --> 00:48:56,529
Take your time.

436
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,642
Beautiful.

437
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:07,512
You're almost there, you're almost there.

438
00:49:09,987 --> 00:49:14,549
Excellent, excellent. You'll be back
on the dance floor in no time, Dakota.

439
00:49:14,658 --> 00:49:16,125
Iùs amazing.

440
00:49:16,226 --> 00:49:18,717
- Thank you.
- For?

441
00:49:18,862 --> 00:49:20,727
For calling me Dakota.

442
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,964
Just don't forget to plug it in
when you're not wearing it.

443
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:28,664
If the battery runs down,
iùs like dragging around a wooden leg.

444
00:49:28,772 --> 00:49:29,864
Okay.

445
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:47,749
I think we managed
to avoid all those reporters.

446
00:50:40,377 --> 00:50:42,345
Aubrey chose the colors?

447
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,442
Yeah. Aubrey. Aubrey chose everything.

448
00:51:07,137 --> 00:51:09,731
Thanks for putting me up for a while.
I appreciate it.

449
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:15,639
Well...

450
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:18,911
Looks like we're not the only ones
happy to see you home.

451
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:24,314
I don't like cats.

452
00:51:26,123 --> 00:51:27,488
Okay. Yeah.

453
00:51:29,093 --> 00:51:30,856
If you need anything, just...

454
00:51:39,536 --> 00:51:40,764
Hold it!

455
00:51:43,507 --> 00:51:45,475
- ID, please.
- Yeah, sure.

456
00:51:49,847 --> 00:51:51,007
Go on.

457
00:51:54,251 --> 00:51:56,048
Thaùs the boyfriend.

458
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:27,948
- Hey.
- Hi.

459
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:29,450
Dakota Moss.

460
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:32,621
Jerrod. Jerrod Pointer.

461
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,351
Sorry, I'm not really used to this thing yet.

462
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,923
Iùs fucked up though, huh?

463
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:46,268
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, sure.

464
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:49,100
Are those flowers for me?

465
00:52:49,206 --> 00:52:50,298
Yeah.

466
00:52:51,475 --> 00:52:52,669
Thanks.

467
00:52:54,945 --> 00:52:56,344
Might as well sit down.

468
00:53:04,254 --> 00:53:05,221
Iùs upstairs.

469
00:53:07,658 --> 00:53:09,956
Just keep forgetting to plug it in at night.

470
00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:13,795
I was supposed to protect you.

471
00:53:13,897 --> 00:53:15,797
So, you must be Aubrey's boyfriend.

472
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:18,159
Yeah.

473
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,296
I'm not Aubrey.

474
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:27,574
I'm really not Aubrey.

475
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:40,853
Aubrey wouldn't do that, would she?

476
00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:51,366
Can I get you guys anything?

477
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:55,834
Oh, hi, Mrs. Fleming.

478
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:00,009
We're gonna go upstairs.

479
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:05,008
- Could you? Thanks.
- Sure.

480
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:18,094
- Well, you coming?
- Yeah.

481
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:25,962
Oh, and Susan, would you mind putting
the blue roses in some water for me?

482
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:27,263
Thanks.

483
00:54:41,685 --> 00:54:45,121
There's only one of these,
so we better make it last.

484
00:56:31,428 --> 00:56:33,191
Don't stop! Oh, my God.

485
00:56:57,988 --> 00:56:58,977
Aubrey?

486
00:57:00,023 --> 00:57:01,320
Why are you doing this?

487
00:57:04,694 --> 00:57:06,355
Did she ever fuck you like that?

488
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,529
Did she ever fuck you at all?

489
00:57:15,472 --> 00:57:16,996
Do you think she'd start now?

490
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:22,040
Look, if you want me to call you Dakota,
I'll call you Dakota.

491
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:25,808
But if you're not Aubrey,
then how'd you get all cut up?

492
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,887
I don't know.

493
00:57:34,357 --> 00:57:36,257
I can't really explain.

494
01:00:15,185 --> 01:00:16,379
Oh, God.

495
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:41,671
I found that heroin ho just like that.

496
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:44,939
What happened to her hand?

497
01:00:45,048 --> 01:00:47,949
Why the hell you asking me?
How should I know?

498
01:00:48,685 --> 01:00:51,119
What happened to your hand, kiddo?

499
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,517
I'll be okay.

500
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:57,752
What happened to your hand?

501
01:00:57,861 --> 01:00:59,726
Damn, that bitch lost a lot of blood.

502
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:02,662
You can die from losing that kind of blood.

503
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,990
Dance.

504
01:01:05,101 --> 01:01:06,295
I'm just saying!

505
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,430
Dance.

506
01:01:09,272 --> 01:01:13,208
Marlene is out there, and she'll kick my ass
if I go out there while she's on.

507
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,970
You go out there.

508
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:29,615
So?

509
01:01:35,131 --> 01:01:36,689
I was just having a drink out back

510
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:41,066
and I dropped a glass.
Musùve cut myself when I picked it up.

511
01:01:43,506 --> 01:01:45,974
How you gonna get to the emergency room?

512
01:01:46,076 --> 01:01:49,341
Hospitals are for rich people. I'll be okay.

513
01:01:49,446 --> 01:01:50,811
How you gonna get home?

514
01:01:51,715 --> 01:01:53,239
I will be fine.

515
01:01:54,017 --> 01:01:56,315
You better take an extra towel.

516
01:02:07,997 --> 01:02:09,965
You got to hold it higher.

517
01:02:13,203 --> 01:02:15,398
You got to hold it higher than your heart.

518
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:33,315
Aren't you gonna ask me what happened?

519
01:02:37,393 --> 01:02:38,917
People get cut.

520
01:02:40,263 --> 01:02:41,662
Thaùs life.

521
01:02:49,506 --> 01:02:51,701
People get cut. Thaùs life.

522
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:55,404
Jesus.

523
01:02:56,212 --> 01:02:57,679
So my finger got cut off,

524
01:02:58,648 --> 01:03:00,172
but nobody did it.

525
01:03:01,317 --> 01:03:03,308
Who's gonna believe that?

526
01:03:05,088 --> 01:03:07,386
Look at you. You don't even believe it.

527
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,582
Yeah, I do.

528
01:03:09,759 --> 01:03:11,192
Thaùs because I fucked you.

529
01:03:15,665 --> 01:03:17,633
- What is it?
- My foot.

530
01:03:21,738 --> 01:03:22,705
Wrong foot.

531
01:03:24,073 --> 01:03:26,234
Iùs phantom limb pain.

532
01:03:28,611 --> 01:03:31,444
Iùs enough to make you
believe in ghosts, huh?

533
01:03:32,982 --> 01:03:35,075
You know,
maybe thaùs why ghosts are restless.

534
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:41,318
Because there's nothing left
of what they were except for the pain.

535
01:03:45,762 --> 01:03:47,161
I need your help, Jerrod.

536
01:04:08,952 --> 01:04:10,283
Piece of shit.

537
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:14,289
Hey. You got a condom, man?

538
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:16,187
- No!
- What? I'm serious. I'll buy it off you.

539
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:18,055
I'm sorry, kid. I don't have one.

540
01:04:19,362 --> 01:04:21,796
Hey, any of you guys got a rubber?

541
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,534
No, I'm... You don't carry rubbers?

542
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:28,130
Thanks.

543
01:04:35,812 --> 01:04:37,245
Hey, hey!

544
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:41,610
Where you headed, boy?

545
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:44,277
Just let me through, okay?

546
01:04:45,688 --> 01:04:47,713
- Go ahead, kid.
- Thank you.

547
01:04:57,634 --> 01:05:00,125
We're at the Tolands' house. Here.

548
01:05:03,506 --> 01:05:05,940
- Not so hard.
- Sorry.

549
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:07,873
So, this is it?

550
01:05:07,977 --> 01:05:11,105
- You want me to go in with you?
- No, iùs okay.

551
01:05:11,214 --> 01:05:13,910
You probably better go back.
They might get suspicious.

552
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:26,585
- Okay.
- All right.

553
01:05:26,696 --> 01:05:27,754
Bye.

554
01:06:12,141 --> 01:06:14,234
Why did you have to come here, Aubrey?

555
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:19,481
You've still got your life.
Nobody in this house has any left.

556
01:06:20,616 --> 01:06:22,811
And you're not cooperating with the police.

557
01:06:23,086 --> 01:06:26,283
I've heard all about it.
You know, you could help find the monster.

558
01:06:28,057 --> 01:06:29,786
I'm sorry, I can't.

559
01:06:39,068 --> 01:06:42,003
I know you didn't come over here
to upset us.

560
01:06:47,043 --> 01:06:49,011
Just seeing her room would be enough.

561
01:08:13,129 --> 01:08:14,323
Aubrey!

562
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:21,232
This is what they call protecting us?

563
01:08:21,337 --> 01:08:22,668
- Where the hell was Lanny Rierden?
- All right.

564
01:08:22,772 --> 01:08:25,002
Daniel, come on. Just calm down.
She's safe.

565
01:08:25,108 --> 01:08:27,076
I mean, he's mad because he knows
I'm telling the truth.

566
01:08:27,176 --> 01:08:31,738
- He knows Aubrey's still out there.
- Aubrey, please. Just shut the fuck up.

567
01:08:34,183 --> 01:08:36,208
Latest DNA test came back.

568
01:08:38,321 --> 01:08:41,085
Hello? Julie?
You want to take a look at them?

569
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:43,215
Take a look at this.

570
01:08:43,326 --> 01:08:46,625
I thought I should go over
Aubrey's hard drive one more time, right?

571
01:08:48,498 --> 01:08:51,899
<i>"She wrote down the name</i>
<i>and her real mother's last known address,</i>

572
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:56,631
"but it was what she saw next that
slammed her in the gut like a celestial fist.

573
01:08:56,739 --> 01:09:00,675
"She stared at the hospital records
in disbelief. It couldn't be true.

574
01:09:00,776 --> 01:09:03,267
"But there it was, in black and white.

575
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:06,143
"Not only did she have a mother
she'd never met,

576
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:08,581
"she also had an identical twin.

577
01:09:09,852 --> 01:09:14,755
"But Virginia Sue Moss had left town
with her twin sister almost 20 years ago.

578
01:09:14,857 --> 01:09:17,587
"How would she ever find her other half?

579
01:09:17,693 --> 01:09:20,856
"She knew only that she had to try.
She had no choice.

580
01:09:22,165 --> 01:09:23,792
"To be continued."

581
01:09:25,635 --> 01:09:26,897
Moss.

582
01:09:27,003 --> 01:09:28,994
As in Dakota Moss. Yeah.

583
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,765
- So this proves that...
- That she's always been

584
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,342
and always will be Aubrey Fleming.

585
01:09:34,443 --> 01:09:37,037
I mean, she's living inside a world
she made up.

586
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:41,412
So the DNA test comparing
Aubrey and Dakota...

587
01:09:41,517 --> 01:09:42,643
Came back identical.

588
01:09:43,419 --> 01:09:45,148
Damn right, it did.

589
01:10:00,036 --> 01:10:01,936
Higher than your heart.

590
01:10:13,749 --> 01:10:15,580
Odd, even.

591
01:10:16,686 --> 01:10:19,280
Right, left.

592
01:10:19,388 --> 01:10:21,982
Rest, motion.

593
01:10:22,091 --> 01:10:23,752
Peace, war.

594
01:10:25,294 --> 01:10:27,888
Love, hate.

595
01:10:27,997 --> 01:10:29,965
Two halves to everything.

596
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:33,558
Sometimes people get cut.

597
01:10:37,206 --> 01:10:39,606
Sometimes people get cut in half.

598
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:31,148
<i>Darker than the shadowy depths</i>
<i>of the deepest ocean,</i>

599
01:12:31,253 --> 01:12:35,952
<i>more infinite than the starry universe,</i>
<i>in three meager pounds,</i>

600
01:12:36,058 --> 01:12:40,119
<i>all the knowledge that ever was</i>
<i>or ever will be.</i>

601
01:12:40,229 --> 01:12:45,292
<i>I'm Art Bell,</i>
<i>and these are the mysteries of the mind.</i>

602
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:47,733
<i>The best documented case</i>
<i>of stigmatic twins</i>

603
01:12:48,537 --> 01:12:52,667
<i>is that of Joseph K., 35,</i>
<i>and his twin brother, Jacob.</i>

604
01:12:54,176 --> 01:12:58,442
<i>Jacob K. was a petty thief</i>
<i>with a gambling problem.</i>

605
01:12:58,547 --> 01:13:02,347
<i>He owed more than $5,000 to the mob.</i>

606
01:13:02,451 --> 01:13:06,080
<i>Unable to pay off his loan,</i>
<i>Jacob K. was targeted for assassination</i>

607
01:13:06,188 --> 01:13:09,521
<i>on the night of December 18th, 1944.</i>

608
01:13:12,762 --> 01:13:15,560
<i>The very same night Jacob K.</i>
<i>was gunned down,</i>

609
01:13:15,664 --> 01:13:20,601
<i>a deep puncture wound appeared</i>
<i>in Joseph K. 's neck in the same spot.</i>

610
01:13:20,703 --> 01:13:23,695
<i>Lacking all explanation,</i>
<i>authorities concluded</i>

611
01:13:23,806 --> 01:13:26,900
<i>that Joseph K. 's wound was self-inflicted.</i>

612
01:13:27,009 --> 01:13:30,172
<i>They failed, however,</i>
<i>to address just how he coulÔve known</i>

613
01:13:30,279 --> 01:13:33,339
<i>the precise location</i>
<i>of his brother's mortal wound</i>

614
01:13:34,316 --> 01:13:39,185
<i>or how both men happened to die</i>
<i>at the same hour, miles apart.</i>

615
01:13:43,759 --> 01:13:44,783
Hey.

616
01:13:44,894 --> 01:13:47,294
I saw the light. You all right?

617
01:13:48,364 --> 01:13:50,229
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

618
01:13:53,169 --> 01:13:56,002
This is a non-smoking house, young lady.

619
01:14:02,812 --> 01:14:04,575
And will remain one.

620
01:14:06,982 --> 01:14:10,679
You know, I think thaùs the first time
I've seen you...

621
01:14:17,927 --> 01:14:20,919
- I'm sorry.
- No, iùs okay. I shouldn't have.

622
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:24,162
I think I'm Aubrey's twin sister.

623
01:14:25,801 --> 01:14:27,393
Her identical twin sister.

624
01:14:27,503 --> 01:14:29,937
I mean, hospitals make mistakes.
We coulÔve been separated at birth.

625
01:14:31,607 --> 01:14:34,075
Look at this house,
this life that your daughter had.

626
01:14:34,176 --> 01:14:37,270
Why would I pretend to be some loser
if this was all mine, huh?

627
01:14:38,414 --> 01:14:40,245
Iùs like a bad dream, sweetie.

628
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:46,047
And someday very soon,
you're gonna wake up and realize the truth.

629
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:48,385
But iùs possible we could be twins, right?

630
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,088
You see?

631
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:57,464
You were all by yourself in there.

632
01:14:59,735 --> 01:15:02,533
No twin sister. Just you.

633
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:10,938
I'm not much of a crier, you know,

634
01:15:12,648 --> 01:15:14,775
but I cried when I saw this.

635
01:15:17,086 --> 01:15:18,678
Daniel and I...

636
01:15:21,156 --> 01:15:22,350
I fell.

637
01:15:24,026 --> 01:15:25,186
And

638
01:15:26,795 --> 01:15:30,959
they made me stay in my bed,
flat on my back, for about six weeks.

639
01:15:33,035 --> 01:15:35,128
Six weeks towards the end,
but it was worth it.

640
01:15:35,237 --> 01:15:37,899
I mean, there were times when I thought,

641
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:40,737
"I'm not gonna be able
to stand another moment of this."

642
01:15:41,577 --> 01:15:45,240
But there were also...
There were times when you'd get

643
01:15:45,347 --> 01:15:47,838
real still on me.

644
01:15:49,218 --> 01:15:53,245
And I'd take both my hands,
I'd put them on my belly, and I said,

645
01:15:53,355 --> 01:15:57,086
"Kick. Kick the hell out of me, girl.
Show me what you got."

646
01:15:57,192 --> 01:16:00,252
And you'd kick. Every time.

647
01:16:02,398 --> 01:16:04,423
The night you were born. Oh, my God.

648
01:16:05,668 --> 01:16:06,828
It was terrifying.

649
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:12,033
I barely saw you,
and they took you away from me.

650
01:16:12,141 --> 01:16:15,508
And it was...
It was touch-and-go for two whole days.

651
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:20,139
And then finally,
finally I had you in my arms.

652
01:16:22,184 --> 01:16:23,811
A little miracle.

653
01:16:26,322 --> 01:16:30,156
I'm not trying to prove you wrong,
you know?

654
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,256
I'm really just trying to help you see.

655
01:16:42,171 --> 01:16:43,365
I know.

656
01:16:47,242 --> 01:16:49,233
But you don't believe me.

657
01:16:55,384 --> 01:16:58,148
But you don't need me
to believe you, sweetheart.

658
01:16:59,321 --> 01:17:02,222
When I think we'll never be normal again...

659
01:17:06,695 --> 01:17:07,662
I...

660
01:17:08,897 --> 01:17:12,094
I see that about you. That strength.

661
01:17:15,938 --> 01:17:20,932
And I think, you know, we'll be all right.
No matter what.

662
01:17:21,043 --> 01:17:23,375
Different, maybe, but all right.

663
01:17:24,847 --> 01:17:26,474
<i>'C</i>ause you're a kicker, girl.

664
01:17:28,384 --> 01:17:29,817
You go right ahead

665
01:17:29,918 --> 01:17:33,752
and you kick your way
to the other side of this problem.

666
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:39,290
I'm gonna be there every step of the way
if you need me.

667
01:18:23,906 --> 01:18:24,998
Shit.

668
01:18:29,812 --> 01:18:31,302
<i>Dakota.</i>

669
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:05,134
I know what you did, Daniel.

670
01:20:05,941 --> 01:20:08,239
- Susan's baby died in the incubator.
- She what?

671
01:20:08,343 --> 01:20:10,106
You bought Aubrey
from the crack head down the hall

672
01:20:10,212 --> 01:20:11,236
because she had one to spare.

673
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:12,313
- You're Aubrey.
- Not me.

674
01:20:12,414 --> 01:20:13,381
- Hey, you're Aubrey.
- Not me, Daniel.

675
01:20:13,515 --> 01:20:14,504
- You were kidnapped...
- I'm not Aubrey.

676
01:20:14,616 --> 01:20:17,210
...and you were hurt, and you're home now.
- Daniel, I'm not Aubrey.

677
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:18,786
I'm her twin. Stop it!

678
01:20:20,322 --> 01:20:21,914
I'm her twin.

679
01:20:22,024 --> 01:20:24,891
Daniel, you're the only one who knows
that there are really two of us.

680
01:20:24,993 --> 01:20:27,359
- You have to help me.
- I'm trying to help you, honey. I am.

681
01:20:27,462 --> 01:20:29,089
No, I saw the envelopes.

682
01:20:30,232 --> 01:20:31,824
I saw the New Salem postmarks.

683
01:20:33,135 --> 01:20:34,932
A little cash on an ongoing basis.

684
01:20:35,037 --> 01:20:37,096
One hits the jackpot,
the other one gets stuck

685
01:20:37,206 --> 01:20:40,573
- with Virginia Sue Moss.
- Okay, enough, okay? Just...

686
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:44,404
I'm tired of this shit, okay? Just...

687
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:50,950
I'm gonna get you some ice.

688
01:20:51,053 --> 01:20:53,578
So you'd let both of us die
just to keep your secret?

689
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:54,713
No!

690
01:21:00,596 --> 01:21:03,463
She lost this one first. So did I.

691
01:21:06,235 --> 01:21:07,327
Fuck.

692
01:21:52,214 --> 01:21:53,272
Fuck!

693
01:22:32,054 --> 01:22:33,248
Oh, my...

694
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,265
Oh, my God.

695
01:22:52,841 --> 01:22:55,332
<i>I always felt like half a person.</i>

696
01:22:55,444 --> 01:22:57,241
<i>You know, half a person with half a soul.</i>

697
01:22:58,313 --> 01:23:01,077
<i>It never occurred to me</i>
<i>that I may possibly have a twin.</i>

698
01:23:01,984 --> 01:23:05,818
<i>All I had to go on was a gut feeling</i>
<i>and a New Salem postmark.</i>

699
01:23:19,401 --> 01:23:22,461
Look, Daniel, I know you may not care
about what happened to me.

700
01:23:23,438 --> 01:23:25,429
But what about Aubrey?

701
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,838
What about the girl you raised
to be your daughter?

702
01:23:27,943 --> 01:23:30,639
Everything that happens to Aubrey
happens to me.

703
01:23:31,646 --> 01:23:35,047
He still has her, okay?

704
01:23:35,417 --> 01:23:37,317
Now, are you gonna help me find her?

705
01:23:39,821 --> 01:23:41,152
- I can't.
- You can't?

706
01:23:41,256 --> 01:23:44,157
- I can't risk losing this.
- You're pathetic.

707
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:47,988
Go fuck yourself.

708
01:26:12,774 --> 01:26:14,833
"Blue ribbons are for winners.

709
01:26:16,144 --> 01:26:18,305
"Never settle for the red.

710
01:26:19,848 --> 01:26:22,214
"Rest in peace. Douglas."

711
01:26:35,564 --> 01:26:38,089
- Iùs okay, iùs me.
- I know who killed me.

712
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,758
You're alive, Dakota, okay? You're not...

713
01:26:39,868 --> 01:26:41,130
No, look.

714
01:26:50,545 --> 01:26:52,570
We really shouldn't go up there
without letting somebody know.

715
01:26:52,681 --> 01:26:56,117
- We don't have enough time.
- I know, I know, I know.

716
01:26:56,218 --> 01:27:00,450
<i>Dakota, there's not enough air.</i>

717
01:27:00,555 --> 01:27:02,648
- What is it?
- I can't...

718
01:27:02,757 --> 01:27:04,019
- Hold on. Just breathe.
- No, I can't breathe.

719
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:05,092
- Breathe. You're having a panic...
- I can't.

720
01:27:05,193 --> 01:27:06,990
- You're having a panic attack. Just breathe.
- I can't breathe.

721
01:27:07,095 --> 01:27:08,221
Iùs okay. Come on, breathe.

722
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:10,798
Iùs okay. Iùs okay.

723
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:13,959
You need to breathe. Good, good. Breathe.

724
01:27:26,648 --> 01:27:29,378
I shoulÔve believed you from the start.

725
01:27:30,919 --> 01:27:32,250
I'm sorry.

726
01:28:36,718 --> 01:28:38,413
<i>Dakota.</i>

727
01:28:45,193 --> 01:28:48,162
<i>Douglas Norquist.</i>

728
01:28:51,599 --> 01:28:54,159
<i>There's two halves to everything.</i>

729
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:19,855
Oh, come on. Just breathe, Aubrey.
Breathe. Slowly.

730
01:32:14,269 --> 01:32:15,531
Fuck you!

731
01:34:03,344 --> 01:34:04,709
Oh, my God.

732
01:34:08,483 --> 01:34:10,747
Daniel, come on. Wake up.

733
01:34:10,852 --> 01:34:12,547
Come on.

734
01:34:12,654 --> 01:34:13,848
Aubrey?

735
01:34:19,527 --> 01:34:20,619
Yeah.

736
01:34:23,264 --> 01:34:26,756
- I'm sorry.
- No! Come on, come on. I need you.

737
01:34:26,868 --> 01:34:28,733
Come on, stay with me.

738
01:37:30,084 --> 01:37:31,949
Why did you come back?

739
01:37:33,788 --> 01:37:35,813
You should be dead by now.

740
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:38,918
Why aren't you dead?

741
01:37:42,864 --> 01:37:45,332
I fucking buried you.

742
01:37:47,568 --> 01:37:49,763
How did you get away from me?

743
01:37:50,938 --> 01:37:52,929
How did you get out, huh?

744
01:37:55,343 --> 01:38:00,303
Now, I have to fucking do the whole thing

745
01:38:00,414 --> 01:38:04,009
all over again!

746
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:06,579
<i>Dakota.</i>

747
01:39:06,681 --> 01:39:09,775
