1
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
Born on the day in the city.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,800
I spell,

3
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
in my old Lisbon.

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,120
another life.

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,280
And with a knot of nostalgia.

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
in the throat.

7
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,160
I hear that a fado tunes.

8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,160
in the farewell.

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,840
And with a knot of nostalgia.

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,080
in the throat.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,920
I hear that a fado tunes.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
in the farewell.

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,640
It was in the taverns
the Alfama,

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,760
in a sad moment,

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,520
this song where he was born,

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,480
his regret,

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,200
in memory of those who are

18
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,280
like the wind,

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,160
in the eyes of someone who loves

20
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,200
and not give up.

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,800
In memory of those who are

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,400
like the wind,

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,760
in the eyes of someone who loves

24
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,800
and not give up.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,640
Glows when the old flame
feeling

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,120
I hear this sea that roars

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,320
while singing.

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,240
And from a Madragoa Bica,

29
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,160
at a time,

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,080
always returns this anxiety

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
at the time of departure.

32
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,000
Production

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,800
Script and direction

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,880
Which only lives in the past,

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,920
without goal

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,760
is a prisoner of fate

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,600
it invades ...

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,640
<i> beginning of the busy
nineteenth century with the arrival in Lisbon </ i></i>

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,400
<i> for work of thousands
people in rural areas, </ i></i>

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
<i> but the colonies
Africa and Brazil, </ i></i>

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,360
<i>fado  arises in courtyards,
brothels and taverns. </ i></i>

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,880
<i> This type of music has survived </ i></i>

43
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,280
<i> until today
in its original form, </ i></i>

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,920
<i>But two centuries later 
is an inspiration </ i></i>

45
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,120
<i>Portuguese  latitudes
saw it. </ i></i>

46
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,480
As a water source

47
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,520
My hand is transparent

48
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,600
in the eyes of my grandmother.

49
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Between land and sky

50
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,800
my grandmother knew black

51
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,840
those things of fate.

52
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,960
I see the sea leads

53
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,760
in the rivers of desire

54
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,960
who was born to sing.

55
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
The Zambezi
becomes the Tagus

56
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
chanted many times
to envy

57
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,000
Lisbon to live.

58
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,920
Lisbon to live.

59
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,120
I see a hair braiding

60
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,720
the warm and singing fado

61
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,680
in a shawl of tirabuzones.

62
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,880
Like a fairy tale

63
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,720
African drums
become guitars

64
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,680
and coconut in sunflowers.

65
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,000
My grandmother knew black

66
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,040
how to read things in the destination

67
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
in the palm of each eye.

68
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,280
Life does not want or like,

69
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,080
God told the witch

70
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,280
I was born to sing.

71
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,240
Girl, what's the matter,

72
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
you're angry with me?

73
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,240
Girl, what's the matter,

74
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,840
you're angry with me?

75
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,440
Is it because your black

76
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,400
was not inclined
at your feet?

77
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,080
Is it because your black

78
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,560
has not been inclined to your feet?

79
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,760
Let's make peace, my love,

80
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,560
I got here, to its knees.

81
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,600
Let's make peace, my love,

82
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,000
I got here, to its knees.

83
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,080
Let's make peace, my love,

84
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,520
here I got on his knees.

85
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,160
Here I am.

86
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,160
Here I am.

87
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Girl, what's the matter?

88
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,760
Why are you crying, do you?

89
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,800
Girl, what's the matter?

90
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,440
Why are you crying, do you?

91
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,040
But if I cry why

92
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,840
're angry with me.

93
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,880
Cry if I am right,

94
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,400
're angry with me.

95
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,320
Let's make peace, my love,

96
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,160
I got here, to its knees.

97
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,760
Let's make peace, my love,

98
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,920
I got here, to its knees.

99
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
Here I am.

100
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,960
Here I am.

101
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,840
Here I am.

102
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,040
Do not tell me what is the cause

103
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,880
that I do not talk
when I entered.

104
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,680
Do not tell me what is the cause

105
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,960
that I do not talk
when I entered.

106
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,400
It will be because your love

107
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,160
I was already over.

108
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,920
It will be because your love

109
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,520
I was already over.

110
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,480
It will be because your love

111
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,880
I was not over.

112
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,960
It will be because your love

113
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,720
I already finished

114
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,640
Let's make peace, my love,

115
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,360
I got here, to its knees.

116
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,280
Here I am.

117
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,800
Here I am.

118
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,440
The wind blows
too hard

119
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,600
so you can relax.

120
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,120
The wind blows
too hard

121
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,450
so you can relax.

122
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,520
There are in my thoughts

123
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,200
something that is going to stop.

124
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,080
There are in my thoughts

125
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,400
something that is going to stop.

126
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,240
Perhaps the thing of the soul

127
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,880
who believe that life is real.

128
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,320
Perhaps the thing of the soul

129
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,400
who believe that life is real.

130
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,680
Maybe this thing quiet

131
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,960
that makes my soul alive.

132
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,520
Maybe this thing quiet

133
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,640
that makes my soul alive.

134
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,920
Wind blows over,

135
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,200
I am afraid to think.

136
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,120
Wind blows over,

137
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,880
I am afraid to think.

138
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,200
My mystery myself Avivo

139
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,640
if I lost in meditation.

140
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,040
My mystery myself Avivo

141
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,360
if I lost in meditation.

142
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,200
Passing wind and forgets,

143
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,440
Dust rises and falls.

144
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,920
Passing wind and forgets,

145
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,520
Dust rises and falls.

146
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,400
Alas for me if I could

147
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,840
know what is inside me.

148
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,960
Oh, me if I could

149
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,440
know what is inside me.

150
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,480
Weep, weep fado,

151
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,240
a fado died.

152
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
Today, exactly a year ago

153
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,880
Severa who died.

154
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,320
The Count of Vimioso

155
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,280
suffered a hard blow

156
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,120
when they went to say:

157
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,760
"Your Severe perished."

158
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,440
Run to your grave

159
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
and still get to see his body.

160
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,080
"Goodbye, my Severa,

161
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,360
God give you good luck. "

162
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,400
In that heavenly kingdom,

163
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,360
with your guitar in hand,

164
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,800
become fado
the angels,

165
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,640
his world upside down again.

166
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,520
Until the San Pedro

167
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,480
sitting at the gate of heaven

168
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,040
andalusia come to see Severa

169
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,280
was to give palms
and to sing a fado.

170
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,280
Weep, fado, crying,

171
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Severa who perished.

172
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,160
The flavor was fado

173
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,010
it was completed.

174
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,820
Oh, street Capelâo

175
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,750
rushes of rosemary.

176
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,750
Oh, Capelâo Street,

177
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,750
rushes of rosemary.

178
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,270
If my love reaches prontito

179
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,960
besaré stone floor

180
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,480
she stepped on to the
while passing.

181
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,040
If my love

182
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,920
prontito arrives

183
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,240
besare stone floor

184
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,560
she stepped on to the
while passing.

185
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,200
I have the destination marking

186
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,930
soon
I saw you on.

187
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,160
I have the destination marking

188
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,250
soon
I saw you on.

189
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,600
Oh, my beloved gypsy,

190
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,400
andalusia embraced live fado,

191
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,000
hugging you die.

192
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,840
Oh, my beloved gypsy,

193
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,680
andalusia embraced live fado,

194
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,480
hugging you die.

195
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,530
Oh, my beloved gypsy,

196
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,560
andalusia embraced live fado,

197
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,120
hugging you die.

198
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,040
A nightingale told me,

199
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,680
viejito of Choupal,

200
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,600
the most beautiful fish

201
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,880
one died days

202
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,080
for having repudiated

203
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,880
His love fatal,

204
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,560
a young troubadour

205
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,440
which is love.

206
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,400
Also came to sing

207
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,160
their serenades

208
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,760
on the banks of the Montego

209
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,240
the genteel troubadour

210
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,840
no matter ever

211
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,960
gratae in their songs,

212
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,520
the poor who die

213
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,920
delivered to his love.

214
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,880
They say that since then

215
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,280
an echo murmurante

216
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,440
responding in Choupal

217
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,520
the band Estudiantina

218
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,000
is the voice of Tricana

219
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,880
he believes is the lover

220
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,160
until today there is still singing

221
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,480
its sad fate.

222
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,000
Tribute to Marceneiro Alfredo,
poet of the street.

223
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,120
A lifelong carpenter

224
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,160
to sing fado
until death.

225
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,720
Sad fado,

226
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,480
sad fado.

227
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,040
Carpenter.

228
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,400
Carpenter all his life.

229
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,880
Sad fado,

230
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,840
sad fado.

231
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,920
I was not born with a hammer

232
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
or follow the footsteps of my father.

233
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,240
No one wanted to be vague,

234
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
but wondered whether
what I wanted to be

235
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,520
I preferred to flee in a balloon.

236
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,760
Looking for my profession,

237
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,960
my way, in my training,

238
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,880
I found a notebook with no stripes,

239
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,840
Loose letters lost
a hatch.

240
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,120
I looked for a hammer

241
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,080
joined the words
and began to build.

242
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,160
First idea: A Window

243
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,560
to pass the truth

244
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,160
that is not in the novels.

245
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,640
A dark, lit a candle,

246
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,320
I felt the smell of sawdust
and I wanted to make the sequel.

247
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,120
Suddenly came to my mind

248
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,040
a door
to exit that cell.

249
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,400
I am

250
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,800
> carpenter to death.

251
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,920
> My blood flows and flows.

252
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,200
My love,

253
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,360
This also helps fado,

254
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,400
The day also consumed.

255
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,550
Soy

256
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,160
Carpenter's death.

257
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,080
My blood flows and flows.

258
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,800
Question
flavors and pains

259
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,000
which is my parents,
present and future.

260
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,320
Do not forget the crying
that is revealed in their faces.

261
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,640
I can not extinguish the flame.

262
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,520
The need another nail bed.

263
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,800
My body is delivered, exhausted.

264
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,920
Embrace my Karma,
which was accepted

265
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,960
and I need to return.
Need

266
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,200
sandpaper in one hand.
Limo imperfections.

267
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,640
Not trying to be perfect,
but the time I gently

268
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,520
maturing in each piece.
It is my goal.

269
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,200
I got letters all over the workshop.

270
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,640
No reward
while there is no money.

271
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,040
My mind just thinks
to have an idea.

272
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,040
Is the life of a carpenter.

273
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,070
Soy

274
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,720
Carpenter's death.

275
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
My blood flows and flows.

276
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
My love,

277
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
This also helps fado,

278
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
The day also consumed.

279
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,430
Soy

280
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,960
Carpenter's death.

281
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,040
My blood flows and flows.

282
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,000
Was given the gift
of construction

283
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,960
but with one condition:
Do not let

284
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,880
using the heart,
with conviction.

285
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,640
A mission that does not control,

286
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,600
the task of sculpting,
a feeling

287
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,440
or a simple scene.
Not in vain

288
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,560
always believe that I belong.

289
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,760
More
is to describe an emotion.

290
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,200
Let your mind wander, do not be afraid

291
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
make what you feel
in employment.

292
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,560
Write your vision,
do not be blind.

293
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,960
Use the hammer, no nails.

294
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,040
Breathe, stop, think.

295
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,760
Take off that tension.

296
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,520
Cree with inner strength

297
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,720
and forget what others think.

298
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,560
The flame should not be turned off.

299
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,480
It should not be shut down

300
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,640
the flame.

301
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,600
Caught the morning

302
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,720
like a child.

303
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,960
A rosebush interwoven,

304
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,640
a strain of hope.

305
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,440
As the body
the city

306
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,280
that early in the morning
dance rehearsal

307
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,400
of those,
force of will,

308
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,000
never tire of working.

309
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,720
Walk the street with the moon

310
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,280
in my Tajo
lights early.

311
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Vago for Lisbon
tide naked

312
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,120
which empties into the Rossio.

313
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,280
I'm a man of the city

314
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,240
that early in the morning
wakes up and sings,

315
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,120
and love for freedom

316
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,440
the city stands.

317
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,920
I go down the street
dazzled

318
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,320
by the full moon in Lisbon

319
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,040
until the moon in love

320
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,120
grows in the sailing of the canoe.

321
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,920
I am the seagull that defeat

322
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,600
any weather
at sea

323
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,000
I am the man who carries

324
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,760
the tide of people scared.

325
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,360
And when caught the morning,

326
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,160
capture the morning like a flower

327
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,720
at the edge of the penalty deflowered.

328
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,040
A blue margarita,

329
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,080
daisy of freedom

330
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,120
I want as anybody.

331
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,360
Daisy in this city

332
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,520
I want,

333
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,880
I want to.

334
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,160
In my hands, the morning

335
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,920
also opened the flower April.

336
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,280
Flower without fear, perfumed

337
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,280
with the aroma of the sea.

338
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
Flor de Lisboa, well loved,

339
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,560
I do not want

340
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,400
but now I want.

341
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,640
It was in the Travessa da Palha

342
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,760
where my lover, a scoundrel,

343
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,400
made my heart bleed.

344
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,840
Bringing to another lover,

345
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,680
came contours, petulant,

346
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,800
with an air of provocation.

347
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,000
Bringing to another lover,

348
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,720
came contours, petulant,

349
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,560
with an air of provocation.

350
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,920
In the tavern Friagem,

351
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,000
between a bunch of Fados,

352
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,040
I came to them without rancor.

353
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,200
Because the woman who brought

354
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,000
certainly not worth

355
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,280
or shade

356
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,680
my love.

357
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,880
Because the woman who brought

358
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,520
certainly not worth

359
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,480
nor the shadow of my love.

360
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
It was in the Travessa da Palha

361
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,080
where my lover, a scoundrel,

362
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,880
made my heart bleed

363
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,280
bringing another lover.

364
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,520
Came contours, petulant,

365
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,160
with an air of provocation.

366
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,280
Bringing to another lover,

367
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,480
came contours, petulant,

368
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,600
with an air of provocation.

369
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,080
In the tavern Friagem,

370
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,080
between a bunch of Fados,

371
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,880
I came to them without rancor.

372
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,160
Because the woman who brought

373
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,320
certainly not worth

374
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,080
or shade

375
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,600
my love.

376
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Because the woman who brought

377
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,520
certainly not worth

378
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,560
nor the shadow of my love.

379
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,920
To see who had more verve

380
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,840
sing a challenge

381
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,880
this one and me.

382
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,480
I left it up to the bitumen,

383
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
showing more fado,

384
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,680
proving to be more women.

385
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,840
I left it up to the bitumen,

386
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,840
showing more fado,

387
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,640
proving to be more women.

388
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,160
It was one of those scenes,

389
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,840
among many others in my life,

390
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,320
of which are never forgotten.

391
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,080
I only know that at dawn

392
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,360
when everything was finished,

393
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,720
we both went home.

394
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,600
I only know that at dawn

395
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,000
when everything was finished,

396
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,260
we both went home.

397
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,360
We both went home.

398
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,000
Return, life lived,

399
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,800
to enable it to see again.

400
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,920
Return, life lived,

401
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,040
so you can see again

402
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,720
one life lost

403
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,720
I never knew that life.

404
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,080
One life lost

405
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,560
I never knew that life.

406
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,400
I would not do again

407
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,440
those times.
What nostalgia.

408
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,280
I would not do again

409
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,600
those times.
What nostalgia.

410
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,920
Spring always returns,

411
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,120
the only thing that does not return
is youth.

412
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,120
Spring always returns

413
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,120
the only thing that does not return
is youth.

414
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,680
Time passes

415
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,640
and we were deceived.

416
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,280
Time passes

417
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,960
and we were deceived,

418
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,040
Now laughing,

419
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,520
Now crying.

420
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,120
Now crying,
Now laughing.

421
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,680
Now laughing,
Now crying.

422
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,200
Now crying,
Now laughing.

423
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,760
"My God, how time passes,"

424
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,680
say from time to time.

425
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,200
"My God, how time passes,"

426
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,520
say from time to time.

427
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,200
In the end,

428
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,040
is the time that remains,

429
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,800
and people going past.

430
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,760
In the end, is the time
that is,

431
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,840
and people going past.

432
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,400
Have known

433
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,120
they were going to die young

434
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,960
I would never have loved

435
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,400
anybody in this world.

436
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,880
Have known

437
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,520
they were going to die young

438
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,080
I would never have loved

439
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,040
anybody in this world.

440
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,840
This dance

441
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,760
is the dream of my hope

442
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,680
it has taught me

443
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,520
your love was false

444
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,280
flower.

445
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,600
This dance

446
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,080
is the dream of my hope

447
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,520
it has taught me

448
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,120
your love was false

449
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,680
flower.

450
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,400
At the farewell

451
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,160
cry a lot.

452
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,800
That hurt

453
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,360
and I cried too.

454
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,440
This dance

455
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,000
is the dream of my hope

456
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,840
it has taught me

457
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,520
faso was your love,

458
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,320
flower.

459
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,920
At the farewell

460
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,760
cry a lot.

461
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,120
That hurt

462
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,560
and I cried too.

463
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,600
This dance

464
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,160
is the dream of my hope

465
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,520
it has taught me

466
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,120
your love was false

467
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,600
my flower.

468
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,880
Love, when shown,

469
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,480
it is not known to display.

470
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,080
He knows how to look

471
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,760
but not knowing how to talk.

472
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,160
Who wants to say what he feels

473
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,480
do not know what to say.

474
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,840
If he speaks, it seems that lying.

475
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,320
If shut, it seems to forget.

476
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,600
Oh, if she guessed,

477
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,640
if I could hear the eyes ...

478
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,600
And if you look enough

479
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,240
to know
that are loving ...

480
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,800
But I feel much, shut up.

481
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,040
Who wants to say
what you feel

482
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,200
remains without a soul,

483
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,480
speechless,

484
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,640
and totally alone.

485
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,720
It was in the dry
wild leaves.

486
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,840
Who put you that name.

487
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,920
Soledad,

488
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,360
loneliness.

489
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,640
He knows what words are

490
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:17,080
before they put the sun.

491
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,640
As a dream of agony ...

492
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,680
These eyes of mine.

493
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,120
Soledad,

494
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,320
Little India.

495
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,760
Is it so fast? Do not stop?

496
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,040
Little Indian.

497
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,880
Little Indian.

498
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,840
In ash soil
abandoned.

499
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,920
What do you think?
Do not think anything.

500
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,320
Soledad,
loneliness.

501
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,800
Life is totally secret

502
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,440
as the stars

503
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,440
like the stars
in these ashes.

504
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,760
As the stars

505
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,960
like the stars
in these ashes.

506
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,840
Before they let the sun ...

507
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,280
Soledad.

508
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,480
Soledad.

509
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,680
- This is wrong here?
- Not very well.

510
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Well

511
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,960
only he would explain

512
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,480
who serves your destination

513
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,280
without penalty and without joy.

514
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,840
Your heart is so big ...

515
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:55,890
very nice too ...

516
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,590
It is by God's will

517
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,740
I live in anxiety,

518
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,880
cries are all mine,

519
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,800
and all my nostalgia.

520
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,960
It is by God's will.

521
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,420
What a strange way of life

522
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,200
have this heart of mine.

523
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:56,040
Lives lost in life,

524
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,000
Who would you give this gift?

525
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,120
What a strange way of life.

526
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,280
Celebrities independent

527
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,600
heart that does not control,

528
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,560
lives lost among the people

529
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:35,080
stubbornly bleeding,

530
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,280
heart independent.

531
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,200
I do not already over,

532
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,480
order to stop beating,

533
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,180
if you do not know

534
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,400
where to go,

535
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,880
Why insist on running?

536
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,360
I do not already over.

537
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,400
Grândola, brown village,

538
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,840
land of brotherhood.

539
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:09,280
The village is in charge

540
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,680
inside you, oh city.

541
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,680
Inside you, oh city.

542
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:24,640
The village is in charge,

543
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,200
land of brotherhood.

544
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,040
Grândola, brown village.

545
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,600
Oh, my muse fado,

546
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,040
oh, my gracious mother.

547
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,240
I leave you, shocked,

548
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,800
the first of April.

549
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,240
Do not be so ungrateful,

550
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,480
do not forget who I love you

551
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,880
and who in your dense jungle
lost and found.

552
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,240
This land still
will meet his ideal,

553
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,720
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

554
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,160
You know?

555
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,320
Basically I am a sentimental.

556
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,240
All the inherited blood
Lusitanian a good dose of lyricism.

557
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,240
In addition to syphilis, of course.

558
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,640
Although my hands are busy

559
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,160
torturing, drowning, degollando,

560
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:55,800
close your eyes my heart
and sincerely mourned.

561
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,080
With Culantrillo in the scrub,

562
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,120
rosemary in the reedbed,

563
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,360
liquors in the Moringa,

564
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,640
came a tropical

565
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,280
and the beautiful mulata

566
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,480
fits with the Alentejo

567
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:41,520
to which a bravata
stole a kiss.

568
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:48,840
This land still
will meet his ideal,

569
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,760
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

570
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,160
My heart is calm
by nature

571
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,880
hit my hand
Hard and fast.

572
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,440
So,
when everything is done,

573
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,960
lost,
I question myself.

574
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,920
If you take your hands
off my chest

575
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,840
is that distance
between intention and gesture.

576
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,360
And if you close with my hands
my heart

577
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:23,160
I am surprised the sudden
sense of incest.

578
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,080
In the heat of battle

579
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,200
boasts a sharp grip

580
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,600
but my chest is opened.

581
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,720
And if the ruling
announces brutal,

582
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,200
quickly
Blind runs his hand,

583
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,320
because if not,
forgiving heart.

584
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,600
Guitars and zanfona,

585
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,320
jasmine,
coconut trees and fountains,

586
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,280
sardines, cassava,

587
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,640
in a smooth tile.

588
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,080
And the Amazon River

589
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,040
traveled Trás-os-Montes

590
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,720
and a large wave
flows into the Tagus.

591
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,400
This land still
will meet his ideal,

592
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,440
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

593
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:26,120
This land still
will meet his ideal,

594
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,760
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

595
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,680
Me, I just miss me,

596
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,640
Lady of my life,

597
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,160
I say that's my dream

598
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,370
and I

599
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,080
by birth.

600
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,680
I bring a fado song

601
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,000
in my soul

602
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,880
well-kept.

603
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:30,000
Come inside my surprise

604
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,320
looking

605
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,160
My fado.

606
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,920
My fate, my fate.

607
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,240
My fate, my fate.

608
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,080
A friendship lost

609
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,840
can never return.

610
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,120
It was a feigned friendship

611
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,520
to go and play again.

612
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,360
It was a feigned friendship

613
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,120
to go and play again.

614
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,880
Nobody gives anything

615
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,640
without a change
a reward.

616
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,440
Nobody gives anything

617
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,760
without a change
a reward.

618
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,560
Only a friend can

619
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,320
love without giving.

620
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,680
Only a friend can

621
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,800
love without giving.

622
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,680
My mother, I sing at night

623
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,920
because the day I was punished.

624
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,080
And in the silence of things

625
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,320
I find the voice friend.

626
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,440
And in the silence of things

627
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,920
I find the voice friend.

628
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,120
My mother, I cry at night

629
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,600
this love
in which I sink.

630
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,560
Because words
of life

631
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,480
and no other world.

632
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,720
So I am this song

633
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,160
my mother, as a wound

634
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,920
that seen at night in my body

635
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,400
no destination, but with fado.

636
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,320
That seen at night in my body

637
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:44,000
Fado but with no destination.

638
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,280
Maybe I read fado

639
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,080
what I mean nobody.

640
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,040
And we pursue,

641
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:59,240
to hear him.

642
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,120
And we Pursuing

643
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,880
to hear him.

644
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,280
My love has sung

645
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,280
under heaven so superior.

646
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,200
Because I gave
each fado

647
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,680
as if it were the first.

648
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,960
Perhaps I did not ask fado

649
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,400
everything that I,

650
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,640
therefore, even if I forget,

651
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:39,000
he does not forget who I am.

652
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,440
So even if I forget,

653
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,720
he does not forget who I am.

654
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,960
Not to see you cry

655
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,360
and see you cry now.

656
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,040
Not to see you cry

657
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,440
and see you cry now.

658
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,200
For wanting stronger,

659
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,920
want to see you at all times.

660
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,080
Flying over time

661
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,200
when you talk and I listen.

662
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,000
But the hours of our life

663
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,200
each have one minute.

664
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:31,640
Permítete be at my side

665
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,560
and not ever go again,

666
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,600
for my heart,
poor,

667
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,840
living in a life time.

668
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,360
For my heart,
poor,

669
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,240
living in a life time.

670
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,400
I am not afraid to fame,

671
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,600
Alfama with bad reputation.

672
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,000
I am not afraid to fame,

673
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,640
Alfama with bad reputation.

674
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,360
Fame sometimes defamed

675
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,480
Good people, honest people.

676
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,160
Fame sometimes defamed

677
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,280
Good people, honest people.

678
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,840
Fado, come with me,

679
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,360
fado hear this from the street.

680
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,840
Fado, come with me,

681
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,800
fado hear this from the street.

682
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,240
And sing desafiándoos

683
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:37,200
in a typical old town.

684
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,920
And sing desafiándoos

685
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,920
in a typical old town.

686
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,920
Come on, as I said,

687
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,000
you have to do at dawn

688
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,120
how good was that the evening

689
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,920
in the old Alfama district.

690
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,480
I am not afraid to fame

691
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,720
Alfama with the bad reputation.

692
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,680
I am not afraid to fame

693
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,640
Alfama with the bad reputation.

694
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,400
I know that the world was talking,

695
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,760
and true evil.

696
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,600
I know that the world was talking,

697
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,280
and true evil.

698
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,040
So it was not always true

699
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,240
what they were.

700
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,240
So it was not always true

701
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:39,240
what they were.

702
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:43,200
Many people there wore

703
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,040
a very quiet life

704
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,560
a form of evil

705
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,160
was dotted with mud.

706
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,160
Fame

707
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,080
sometimes defamed

708
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,760
Good people, honest people.

709
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,240
Fame sometimes defamed

710
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,280
Good people, honest people.

711
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,080
Fado this is mine and yours,

712
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,200
a destiny that bind us

713
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,040
while it is denied

714
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,000
the strings of a guitar.

715
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,920
Whenever you hear the wail

716
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,800
a guitar playing

717
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,280
we feel lost

718
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,720
who want to mourn.

719
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:29,560
Oh, people of my land,

720
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,520
Now I come to realize

721
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,520
I feel sad that this

722
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,000
The received from you.

723
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,920
And it would seem tenderness

724
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,480
if I leave Acuña.

725
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,840
It would be more bitterness,

726
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,240
I sing less sad.

727
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,120
Oh, people of my land,

728
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:43,280
Now I come to realize

729
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,590
sadness that I feel

730
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,100
The received from you.
