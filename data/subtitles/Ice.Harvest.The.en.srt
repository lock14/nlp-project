1
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:27,545
<i>People always say...</i>

2
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,905
<i>there's no such thing</i>
<i>as the perfect crime.</i>

3
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:33,425
<i>But I don't agree with that.</i>

4
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:37,225
<i>If you plan things</i>
<i>carefully enough...</i>

5
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:39,705
<i>if you think through</i>
<i>every last detail...</i>

6
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:41,985
<i>if you have nerves of steel...</i>

7
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:45,105
<i>if you can remain calm</i>
<i>no matter what happens...</i>

8
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:47,465
<i>there should be no problem</i>
<i>you can't handle.</i>

9
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,985
<i>It's really all</i>
<i>a matter of character.</i>

10
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:52,265
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>if I had any character...</i>

11
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,425
<i>I wouldn't have stolen</i>
<i>$2 million from my boss.</i>

12
00:00:58,465 --> 00:00:59,825
<i>Christmas Eve.</i>

13
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:01,665
<i>Ho, ho, fucking ho.</i>

14
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:53,625
Well? How did it go?

15
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,305
Good. Went good.

16
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:59,545
How much?

17
00:03:00,585 --> 00:03:01,705
A lot.

18
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:07,545
Am I gonna have to slap
the shit out of you? How much?

19
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,145
Vic, it's a great big
fucking pile of money.

20
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:14,665
$2,147,000 and change.

21
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:22,945
Hmm.

22
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,945
My God,
we're actually doing this.

23
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,905
No, we're not doing it.

24
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:37,425
It's already done.

25
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,025
Look, don't be so worried.
The hard part's done already.

26
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,865
Everything worked
just like you said it would.

27
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:53,825
Yeah. I guess.

28
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,305
Just act normal
for a few hours
and we're home free.

29
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,185
Okay?
Okay.

30
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:00,385
Okay.

31
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,025
You wanna take the money
and not me?

32
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,465
You wanna take the money?

33
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:13,305
No. I don't know.
I was just...

34
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,305
Well, if you wanna
take the money...

35
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:16,785
I mean, if you think
you can do a better job...

36
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,145
of guarding $2 million...

37
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:21,345
No, no, no.
It should be you.
It should be you.

38
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,785
It's just we didn't
discuss that.

39
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:25,985
Are we through discussing it?

40
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,905
Or is there more to say
on the subject?

41
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,625
No, we're done.

42
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,905
Cool. Okay, shut the door.

43
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,465
Okay.
Okay. And, Charlie.

44
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,065
Yeah?
Act normal.

45
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:37,825
Yeah.

46
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,105
Oh, good! Good.
No, no, no.

47
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,985
No, no.
That's none of your business.

48
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:17,225
That's none of your
fucking business, all right?

49
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,145
I don't give a shit,
you toothless old whore.

50
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:35,785
Mom. Mom, I gotta go.

51
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:38,625
Don't you ever
touch her again!

52
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,345
Sidney! Sidney! No! No!

53
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:44,545
Don't hurt him.

54
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:46,625
Jeez, it's Christmas.

55
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,265
I love you.

56
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:50,825
Don't be an asshole.

57
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:53,225
Giselle, come on,
hop up there.

58
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,305
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

59
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:01,225
Hi, Charlie.
Didn't see you come in.

60
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,025
Who gave Rusti the shiner?

61
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:06,505
Her asshole boyfriend.
Some dipshit guitar player.

62
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:08,265
I swear to God,
if he comes in here again...

63
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:09,905
I'm gonna break his
fucking fingers.

64
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:17,945
Jesus, look at this place.

65
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:19,345
Just 'cause it's Christmas...

66
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:21,425
people all of a sudden
can't look at tits and ass?

67
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,705
Hi, Renata.
Hello, Counselor.

68
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,145
Not drinking tonight?

69
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,265
Just watching the floorshow.

70
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:30,505
Sidney, get my favorite
crooked lawyer a beer.

71
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:32,225
Actually, I'll take a rum.

72
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,385
Rum?
Mmm-hmm.

73
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,385
Rum and what?
Got any pineapple juice?

74
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:39,785
If you got one of those
little plastic umbrellas...

75
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,825
you can put that thing
in there.

76
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:46,305
What?

77
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:49,305
You look like the cat
that swallowed the canary,
is what.

78
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:52,185
Like you're about
to belch a feather.

79
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:58,305
Been working on
this acquisition deal
for a while...

80
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,745
and it finally came through,
so<i>...</i>

81
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:02,265
Is this
a Bill Guerrard thing?

82
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:04,665
No, this is a... No.

83
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:08,665
Charlie Arglist.

84
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:10,945
Man of mystery.

85
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:14,785
This mean
you're rich, Charlie?

86
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:16,585
'Cause if you are,
we could run away together.

87
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:18,625
It's a thought.

88
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:21,385
Leaving Wichita.

89
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,865
Damn right, it's a thought.

90
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,145
Come the first of the year,
there'll be no more
nude dancing in the city.

91
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:28,905
Which means
I'm fucked.

92
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:31,585
And don't tell me,
"Move out to the county,"
either.

93
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:34,265
Because Bill Guerrard's
got the county all to himself.

94
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:37,025
And I don't think
he's looking for competition.

95
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:39,105
Isn't that right,
Charlie?

96
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,905
You should let me
help you out.

97
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:44,385
If I was real smart,
I'd see this
as an opportunity.

98
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:47,585
I could, you know.
Could what?

99
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:50,625
Help you.
You, Charlie?

100
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:52,585
If you had that photo...

101
00:07:56,265 --> 00:07:58,625
Of Councilman Williams
and Cupcake?
Mmm-hmm.

102
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:03,585
Vic's got that photo.

103
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,385
And I know
he won't give it to me...

104
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:08,065
because I've asked him nice
and he just won't.

105
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:09,785
Well, he wouldn't
have to know.

106
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,265
Well, that would be
just about...

107
00:08:12,345 --> 00:08:15,385
the nicest Christmas present
you could give me, Charlie.

108
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:19,625
I'd have to think
of something extra nice
to give you in return.

109
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,945
No. Forget it.

110
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:31,505
I appreciate the thought,
but you'd be getting in
way over your head.

111
00:08:31,585 --> 00:08:34,785
Vic Cavanaugh
and Bill Guerrard eat guys
like you for lunch.

112
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,545
Sidney.
Yo.

113
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,905
I'll be back later
to close up.

114
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:44,265
It's against my religion
to give out personal advice...

115
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:46,945
but you should either sober up
or get real drunk.

116
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:06,305
That's fucking horrible.
Toss it and give me a beer.

117
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:19,625
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls."

118
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,025
Have you seen
Charlie tonight?

119
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,745
No. You just missed him.

120
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:41,945
How about Vic?
Seen Vic?

121
00:09:42,185 --> 00:09:43,865
No. Not yet.

122
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:46,025
Of course,
it is Christmas.

123
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,505
Yeah, right.
Christmas.

124
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:07,425
"As Wichita falls,
so falls Wichita Falls."

125
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,945
What sort of fucking moron
would write such a thing?

126
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,825
<i>Roy Gelles is in town.</i>

127
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:22,265
Vic, did you hear me?

128
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:23,745
<i>Roy Gelles is in town.</i>

129
00:10:23,785 --> 00:10:25,865
So what?
So he's looking for us.

130
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:27,945
So maybe he knows.
That's what.

131
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,545
Roy Gelles doesn't know shit.

132
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,265
Roy Gelles knows
what Bill Guerrard tells him.

133
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,025
And Bill doesn't know
shit either, so chill out.

134
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:34,865
Then what is he doing in town
on Christmas Eve?

135
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,745
Thank you, sweetie.
I appreciate it.

136
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,545
He's got a daughter in town.
Maybe he's visiting her.

137
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,905
<i>Like you said,</i>
<i>it's Christmas.</i>

138
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:43,065
That still doesn't explain
why he's at the Sweet Cage.

139
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:45,185
Listen, Charlie, don't go
squirrelly on me now, okay?

140
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:46,905
<i>Just stick to the plan.</i>

141
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:50,105
Maybe we should leave now.

142
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:51,265
<i>Well, we're not going to.</i>

143
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:53,865
In case you haven't noticed,
it's a fucking hockey rink
out there.

144
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,425
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

145
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:56,705
<i>What?</i>
Nothing.

146
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:58,665
<i>They say the rain</i>
<i>is supposed to stop</i>
<i>by midnight.</i>

147
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:00,905
By 5:00 in the morning,
we're in Kansas City...

148
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:03,025
where we enjoy a leisurely
breakfast at the airport...

149
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:04,985
and by 8:00, we're on a plane
to someplace warm...

150
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,705
where it's against
the fucking law to rain, okay?

151
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:08,825
Click.

152
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:10,945
Vic? Vic?

153
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,825
Fuck me.

154
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:18,905
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

155
00:11:24,665 --> 00:11:25,785
Fuck.

156
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,665
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

157
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:33,945
Hi, Mr. Arglist.
I didn't recognize you.

158
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:34,945
Hi.

159
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:37,665
Yeah. Boy, I didn't realize
how slippery that was.

160
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:40,865
Yeah. Didn't you notice
all the cars off the side
of the road?

161
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:43,185
I wasn't paying
close enough attention,
I guess.

162
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:46,945
You going somewhere,
Mr. Arglist?
No.

163
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,145
Hey, none of my business,
right?

164
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:51,425
I'd be careful, though.

165
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:53,905
We're gonna have this
freezing rain on
and off all night...

166
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,465
so I'd stay off the road...

167
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:59,385
and probably take it easy
with that, too.

168
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:01,345
The next guy
who pulls you over...

169
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,585
might be somebody
who don't know any better.

170
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:04,865
I definitely owe you one.

171
00:12:04,945 --> 00:12:07,905
All right. It's Tyler.
It's R.P. Tyler.

172
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,665
Remember my name
to Mr. Guerrard.

173
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:10,945
I will.

174
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,425
What is it?

175
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:15,905
Just kidding. Just kidding.

176
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,425
Have a merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

177
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,225
Dickhead.

178
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:28,385
I'm not working Christmas
for no fucking money,
Dennis.

179
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:29,625
I'm not.

180
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,545
I could be at home
spending Christmas
with my kids.

181
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,625
Your kids with
your husband, Francie.
They in Denver.

182
00:12:34,665 --> 00:12:36,545
Fuck you very much
for throwing that in my face.

183
00:12:36,585 --> 00:12:38,905
Look, you can cry
all you want,
but you're still going on.

184
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:41,025
You've been here long enough
to know the goddamn drill.

185
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,345
You wanna work
on the hot nights,
you gotta work on the cold.

186
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:44,705
Fuck it, Dennis.

187
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:47,705
I'm not paying Bill Guerrard
a $100 stage rental fee...

188
00:12:47,785 --> 00:12:51,385
so some old pervert can look
at my twat on Christmas
fucking Eve!

189
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:52,545
Go dance.

190
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,465
Tell you what.
Since it's Christmas Eve...

191
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:55,945
stage rental's on the house.

192
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,345
Hi, Charlie.
I didn't see you come in.

193
00:12:58,425 --> 00:12:59,385
Hi.

194
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:00,385
You mean it?

195
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:01,785
Uh-huh.

196
00:13:02,025 --> 00:13:03,265
Gee, thanks.

197
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:10,465
Since when are you a friend
of the working girl?

198
00:13:11,105 --> 00:13:13,985
It's Christmas, Dennis.
It's God's birthday.

199
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,945
Well, hello there, Councilman.

200
00:13:29,065 --> 00:13:31,625
So, Dennis, you're saying
you haven't seen Charlie,
huh?

201
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,945
Charlie? No.
Why do you ask?

202
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,465
How about Vic Cavanaugh?
You seen him?

203
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:39,145
Dude, I don't do henchmen,
man. I do strippers.

204
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:56,265
Hey, Frankie.
Is Vic around?

205
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,945
He's sitting over there.

206
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:00,225
Let me get you a drink.
Thanks.

207
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:02,465
Victor.

208
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:09,665
You know,
us being seen together,
tonight of all nights...

209
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,265
is probably not so smart.

210
00:14:11,305 --> 00:14:12,825
I would have called...

211
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:15,905
but I had
a bit of a situation.

212
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:20,905
So, guess who's
over at the Tease.

213
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:23,065
Roy Gelles.
I just spoke to him.

214
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:25,305
You just spoke to him?
Yeah, I spoke to him.

215
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,425
Come on, man.
What the fuck...
What did he say?

216
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:30,785
What's wrong with you?
He just called to wish me
a merry Christmas.

217
00:14:30,905 --> 00:14:32,225
Well, what
did you say?

218
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:33,865
Well, I wished him
a merry Christmas.

219
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:35,105
What did he say?

220
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:36,705
What the hell
are you so worried about?

221
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:39,225
Vic, I sue people
for a living.

222
00:14:39,465 --> 00:14:41,385
You sell them pornography.

223
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,105
Roy hurts people.

224
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:46,985
He makes it
so their knees and elbows
bend in both directions.

225
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:48,225
That worries me.

226
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,305
Let me ask you something.

227
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:53,625
Did I make a mistake
when I made you
my partner in this deal?

228
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:56,665
Hey! You didn't
make me your partner.
I am the one who showed you...

229
00:14:56,745 --> 00:14:59,425
how to steal $2 million worth
of Bill Guerrard's money.

230
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:02,465
Then I showed you
how to do it so he wouldn't
know what you'd done...

231
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:03,865
till it was too late.

232
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,145
What we've done, okay?

233
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:08,505
Remember that.
What we've done.

234
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:10,585
And here's the thing
about what we've done.

235
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,065
Mr. Arglist?

236
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:14,825
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

237
00:15:16,745 --> 00:15:19,465
Left to yourself,
you'd still be on
a barstool...

238
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,185
thinking about
how it could be done...

239
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:25,145
if somebody had
the balls to do it.
Which is me.

240
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,865
Don't poke, Vic, okay?
I get it.

241
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:36,785
Hello.

242
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:38,585
Yeah.

243
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:41,865
I know that.
I know that.

244
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:46,145
I know that, too.

245
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,705
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

246
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:58,025
So, I'll meet you
at the Velvet Touch at 1:00.

247
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:00,265
Just like we planned,
all right?
Who was that?

248
00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:04,065
Not that it's any
of your fucking business.

249
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:06,025
That was my wife.

250
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:08,065
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetie.

251
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:12,865
The lovely Gladys,
of whom you've heard me
speak over the years...

252
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,825
with tenderness
and affection.

253
00:16:14,905 --> 00:16:16,745
She was wondering
if I'm gonna be home...

254
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,505
in time for midnight worship.

255
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,425
I thought that's
who you were...
Oh, having dinner with?
No, no.

256
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:24,225
See, Gladys is
on the Subway Diet.

257
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:26,745
She has a couple
of foot-longs at lunch,
couple at dinner.

258
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,305
Buys her clothes
from Omar the Tentmaker.

259
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,545
But perhaps I'm being unkind.

260
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,465
Anyway, let me out of here.

261
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:39,865
Hey, Vic.
Yeah?

262
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:44,105
If you wouldn't mind,
you know,
in case we get separated...

263
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:46,465
tell me where the money is.

264
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,745
Excuse me, Mr. Arglist.

265
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:50,385
That's hilarious.

266
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:52,425
He's something else.
Yeah.

267
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,305
Mr. Arglist, I wonder
if I might have a word?

268
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:55,785
Sure. Vic!

269
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:58,225
Mr. Arglist,
I'm sorry
to bother you.

270
00:16:58,305 --> 00:17:00,185
I believe
you can help us.

271
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:03,545
Peter Van Heuten
is a friend of yours,
right?

272
00:17:03,905 --> 00:17:04,945
Yes.

273
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,825
He's in no shape to drive...

274
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:09,225
Charlie fucking Arglist!

275
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,825
Yo ho ho, mo-fo!
What are you doing here, man?

276
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:14,705
Hiya, Pete.
Merry Christmas!

277
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,625
It's good to see you!
Good to see you!

278
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,185
What are you doing here, man?
The real people are in there.

279
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:21,625
Let's go in here.

280
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:25,465
Everybody, I want
you to meet... Listen up,
a friend of mine...

281
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,305
This is Charlie Arglist,
the most talented
and handsome...

282
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:30,745
mob lawyer in all of Kansas.

283
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:33,745
I really wish
you wouldn't do that.
Come on.

284
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:36,825
Come on. That was
Vic Cavanaugh you were
hanging out with back there.

285
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:38,945
So what?
Hey, let me ask you
a question.

286
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,905
Is it true that one time...

287
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:43,905
he cut the hand off
of somebody
who stuck their fingers...

288
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:47,145
up the twazzallah
of a dancer
over at Tease-O-Rama?

289
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:48,225
Look around at the bar.

290
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,865
Do you see a lot
of one-armed men in here?

291
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,465
Because if they chopped off
the hand...

292
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:54,265
of every guy who tried
that with a stripper...

293
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:56,145
half the men in Wichita
would be wearing hooks.

294
00:17:56,225 --> 00:17:59,265
Are you trying to tell me
that these are just
normal guys you work for?

295
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:00,385
What are you doing here?

296
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,545
Trying to get my ashes hauled,
like everybody else!

297
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,465
<i>NoëI, Joyeux NoëI!</i>

298
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,465
It's all right.
He's drunk.

299
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:09,345
Sarabeth isn't performing
that function anymore?

300
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,945
Did she do that
for you oftentimes...

301
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,305
throughout your saga?

302
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,505
Occasionally.
Not very often.
Mmm-hmm.

303
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:18,945
Is she still wearing
flannel to bed?

304
00:18:18,985 --> 00:18:20,145
Silly me.

305
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,465
I thought, until I met
and married Sarabeth...

306
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:24,185
that it was
only little children...

307
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:27,585
who wore those things
with the feet sewn
on the bottom.

308
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,065
You could have warned me
about that.

309
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:30,945
And I'm actually
being kind of serious here.

310
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,625
I tried to, Pete.
I really did.

311
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,785
Yeah, bullshit. I was the end
of your alimony problem.

312
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,305
That's what I was.
Like hell. You were in love.

313
00:18:37,385 --> 00:18:38,465
With my wife.

314
00:18:39,665 --> 00:18:40,785
Love.

315
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,785
Someday somebody is going
to tally up the cost...

316
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,865
of that particular illusion.

317
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:50,065
Hey.
Yeah?

318
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:51,865
Did you ever go and...

319
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,465
The strippers?
Yeah, occasionally.

320
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:55,745
Yeah?
Yeah, sure.

321
00:18:55,825 --> 00:18:57,225
When I'm really desperate...

322
00:18:57,305 --> 00:18:59,545
or completely shit-faced,
or generally have
my head up my ass.

323
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,105
I'm all those three things
right now, baby. Let's go!

324
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:03,585
So how you doing
otherwise, buddy?

325
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:06,105
Great. Great. Really great.

326
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:09,945
Drawing a lot of buildings.
Making a fucking fortune.

327
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,105
Well, listen.
I gotta make a phone call.

328
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:17,345
If you just hold down
the fort here and remain calm.

329
00:19:17,425 --> 00:19:18,785
Remain calm.

330
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,945
Big mob lawyer.

331
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:35,425
Sweet Cage.
<i>Sidney, is Renata back yet?</i>

332
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,345
No. She just called.
Said she's on her way.

333
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:39,945
All right, listen...

334
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:42,065
when she gets back,
you tell her
I have that present...

335
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:44,305
that I mentioned for her
earlier and not to leave.

336
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:45,505
Okay? Bye.

337
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:47,705
Mr. Arglist.
Councilman.

338
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:49,225
I wonder if we might
have a quiet word.

339
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:50,785
Actually, I'm kind of...

340
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:54,785
Would you be good enough
to deliver a message
from me to Mr. Guerrard?

341
00:19:57,785 --> 00:20:01,345
Wichita is a community
of good people, Mr. Arglist.

342
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:02,465
Christian people.

343
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:05,185
Yeah, half of them
are in this very bar
trying to get laid.

344
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:08,865
That may well be.
But my point is,
some time ago...

345
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:12,865
in a moment of weakness,
I did a very foolish thing.

346
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:15,265
And that foolish thing
was photographed.

347
00:20:15,345 --> 00:20:18,945
I believe that photo
is in the possession
of a Mr. Vic Cavanaugh...

348
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:22,345
an associate of yours,
who refuses to surrender it...

349
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:25,505
despite several generous
offers for its purchase...

350
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:27,625
the last of which,
delivered not 10 minutes ago.

351
00:20:27,705 --> 00:20:29,345
People can be stubborn.

352
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:33,025
Do you think
Mr. Guerrard would be able
to persuade Mr. Cavanaugh...

353
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:34,065
Oh.

354
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:38,625
...to reconsider if
he understood his own
interests in the matter?

355
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,625
Well, Mr. Guerrard
is one of the most
persuasive men I know.

356
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:45,265
What kind of figures
are we talking about here?

357
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:46,865
Are we talking about four?
Five? Six?

358
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,745
Five, Mr. Arglist.
Low five.

359
00:20:51,545 --> 00:20:53,505
Councilman, I think
the photo in question...

360
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,585
might be closer
than you can possibly
imagine.

361
00:20:57,345 --> 00:20:59,905
You've given me hope,
Mr. Arglist.
Merry Christmas.

362
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:03,025
Wonderful season, isn't it?
So full of
mutual understanding.

363
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:04,305
Yeah.

364
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:13,225
You gotta know
the whole culture
is in the toilet...

365
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,665
if a guy dressed
like that can get laid
in a place like this.

366
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:19,665
Hey, you're flipping off
the mob here,
just so you know.

367
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,145
Did I mention to you that
I really wish you wouldn't
do that?

368
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:23,345
Yeah.

369
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:27,265
M- O-B, mob. Okay?
All right, let's go.

370
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,185
Right back at you, huh?

371
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,625
And there, that one, too.
There, see?

372
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,105
That's my chair in there.

373
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:00,185
You wanna know the truth?

374
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:03,425
I can't fill it.

375
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:09,625
Neither could I,
if it makes you
feel any better.

376
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:11,905
Listen, Charlie.

377
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:14,945
Before we go in,
there's something
I have to tell you.

378
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:18,945
It's been on my conscience,
and you can punch me
if you want to.

379
00:22:19,025 --> 00:22:20,905
I don't think
I'm gonna want to.

380
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:25,705
Back when you and Sarabeth
were still married
that last year...

381
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:26,705
Uh-huh.

382
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:28,705
...she and I
were fucking.

383
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:31,945
No kidding?

384
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:37,825
Like minks. Everywhere.
Kitchen table, your bed,
garage.

385
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:39,265
Wow.

386
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:42,945
Jesus, Charlie,
we were friends.

387
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:44,385
It doesn't make you angry?

388
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:47,105
Actually, it makes me curious.

389
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,425
Makes me wonder
who she's fucking now.

390
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:58,745
Yo ho ho!
Merry fucking Christmas!

391
00:22:59,825 --> 00:23:03,145
Guess who I brought with me?
Ghost of Christmas Past.

392
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,825
Ooh.

393
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:07,745
Marley!
Get the fuck in here.

394
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:09,985
Hey, everybody.

395
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:12,305
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

396
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,345
Hello, Charlie.

397
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:19,545
Come in
and have a piece of pie.

398
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,465
Hi, Dottie.
No, thank you. I'm fine.

399
00:23:21,545 --> 00:23:24,025
I just wanted to stop in
and wish you all
a very merry...

400
00:23:24,105 --> 00:23:26,825
Screw the pie, you old harpy.
We're here for dinner.

401
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:30,145
Turkey, cranberry,
stuffing, the works!

402
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,185
Thanks. Yeah.

403
00:23:35,745 --> 00:23:38,305
Yeah. Motherfucker.
Yeah.

404
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:41,345
Turkey-alurkey.

405
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:43,065
Pathetic.

406
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:45,305
What did you say, Stan?

407
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:48,225
You two are pathetic.
Makes me ashamed to be a man.

408
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:51,625
I'm pathetic?
I'm pathetic?

409
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:53,825
Who paid for that
hip replacement...

410
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:56,065
your insurance company
wouldn't cover, huh?

411
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:58,305
Dad, tell me that!

412
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:02,585
And who took care of
your mortgage payments
when you were recuperating?

413
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:04,385
And when you're
done with that...

414
00:24:04,505 --> 00:24:06,905
maybe you could
explain to me who it was...

415
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,825
raised his only daughter...

416
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,665
to be a cold, gossiping,
hypocritical bitch!

417
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:22,705
So, Spence, how you doing?
Go to hell.

418
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:26,305
Don't you talk
to your father that way.

419
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:29,145
He's not my father.
He didn't even send us
presents this year.

420
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:30,545
I hate his guts.

421
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:32,985
Is that right, Charlie?

422
00:24:33,065 --> 00:24:35,345
You didn't even send them
any Christmas presents?

423
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:37,425
No.
Christmas is tomorrow.

424
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:40,025
Guess what, Daddy?
I was in the Christmas play.

425
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,025
So what?

426
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,945
All you were was
Tiny Tim's sister, and you
didn't even have any lines!

427
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,345
And he didn't even
come to watch!

428
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:47,945
He would have,
but Mommy didn't
send an invitation!

429
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:52,065
I'm sorry, Charlie,
but maybe you should go now.

430
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,025
And perhaps you would give
Pete a ride home?

431
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,785
Sarabeth and the children
will be staying here tonight.

432
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:00,385
Okay.
Yeah.

433
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:01,505
Listen, sweetie,
I'm gonna go...

434
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:03,625
and I'm gonna come back
and visit you tomorrow,
all right?

435
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:06,945
Don't believe him, Melissa.
He's lying.
All he ever does is lie.

436
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:08,105
Shut up!

437
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:10,985
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

438
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:25,665
On the whole,
I thought that went well.

439
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:27,585
Yeah, it's good
to see the family.

440
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:30,585
What do you say,
one more drink?
The night is young.

441
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:33,985
All right, one more,
that's it.
Okay. One more.

442
00:25:46,105 --> 00:25:48,025
Melissa really misses you.

443
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,745
Not Spencer. He hates me.

444
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,025
You just gotta give him time.
He'll come around.

445
00:25:56,465 --> 00:25:59,065
Your leaving came
at an awkward age for him.

446
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:00,985
A clean break is best.

447
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:04,705
No, a clean break is easiest.
On you.

448
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:07,385
Oh.

449
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:10,785
Are you saying
you have no regrets?

450
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,865
Don't believe in them.

451
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:16,225
Bullshit.
Everybody has regrets.

452
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:20,025
Guys our age,
what else is there?

453
00:26:26,225 --> 00:26:27,825
I ever tell you
my father was a twin?

454
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:30,465
Identical?
Fraternal.

455
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:33,025
Looked a lot alike, though,
him and my uncle.

456
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:35,545
Different temperaments
completely.

457
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:38,065
My father, he's a cop.

458
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:40,825
By-the-book guy.

459
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:44,625
Believed in the law.
Wanted his only son
to be a lawyer.

460
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:47,105
Drank in moderation,
didn't smoke.

461
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:49,745
Kept up his
life insurance premiums.

462
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,705
Voted in every election,
not just for president.

463
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,745
Let me guess.
Uncle didn't vote.

464
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:58,945
He said he didn't want
to encourage the bastards.

465
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,985
In and out of jail
from the time he was 16...

466
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:04,665
drunk all the time,
fucked everything that walked.

467
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:08,025
Won a fortune playing poker,
lost it all the same way.

468
00:27:08,105 --> 00:27:10,145
Lost an eye in a fight.
Half his life...

469
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:13,305
So what
you're trying to say is,
you take after your uncle.

470
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,065
I wasn't finished.

471
00:27:17,865 --> 00:27:19,105
My father was 54...

472
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:22,345
when he died of
a massive embolism,
right here in Wichita.

473
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:26,785
My uncle
died the very next day...

474
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,265
in a car wreck in California.

475
00:27:32,705 --> 00:27:34,385
So the point is...

476
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:37,305
it is futile to regret.

477
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:41,985
You do one thing,
you do another...

478
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:44,345
I mean, so what?

479
00:27:45,345 --> 00:27:47,505
What's the difference?
Same result.

480
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:56,865
How many of these lights
you gonna sit through?

481
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:59,305
See if I tell you
another fucking story.

482
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,385
Sorry, guys, we're closed.

483
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:06,785
We just want one drink.
Each.

484
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:11,545
My friend's a mobster.
You might know that,
you might not.

485
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:15,265
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one,
on the house...

486
00:28:15,425 --> 00:28:16,705
if you drink it up and leave.

487
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:18,345
But I'm not opening
my register back up.

488
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:20,185
Thank you, gorgeous.

489
00:28:20,585 --> 00:28:24,385
Do you know
where this last drink
is going to take me?

490
00:28:24,545 --> 00:28:27,025
To that perfect stage
of drunkenness.

491
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:29,465
And then, do you know
what I'm going to do?

492
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:33,665
I'm going to go straight home,
go to bed, and dream of you.

493
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:39,705
I don't think
I'd pursue that
particular line.

494
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:41,345
You with him?
Yeah.

495
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,745
Makes no difference.
It's okay.

496
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:45,785
It's a free country.

497
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:48,785
And any man can dream
anything he wants to dream.

498
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:50,145
And tonight
I'm gonna dream of you.

499
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:52,065
All right,
I gotta make a phone call.
I'll be right back.

500
00:28:52,145 --> 00:28:53,465
Okay, behave yourself.

501
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,545
<i>Sweet Cage.</i>
Sidney, is Renata back yet?

502
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:58,105
No. Not yet.

503
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,625
But you won't believe
who just walked in.

504
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:05,145
Roy Gelles?
<i>No. Forget Roy Gelles,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

505
00:29:05,425 --> 00:29:07,105
That fucking guitar player.

506
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,065
The one who gave Rusti
the black eye.

507
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:10,425
What's going on?

508
00:29:10,505 --> 00:29:11,745
<i>I swear to God...</i>

509
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:15,385
if he gives Rusti
any trouble, I'm gonna
break his fucking fingers.

510
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:16,665
What's your name,
jock strap?

511
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:17,985
Which hand should I break?

512
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:20,145
I don't have the answer
to that question, Sidney.

513
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,305
<i>Listen, when Renata gets</i>
<i>back in, just tell her...</i>

514
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:23,985
I know.
You got a present for her.

515
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:26,105
I hope you don't think
she's gonna fuck you,
Charlie.

516
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:28,665
Think it's
out of the question?
<i>Absolutely.</i>

517
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:30,785
Merry Christmas, Sidney.

518
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:33,385
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, Charlie.

519
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:38,425
Would you like to know
what you're going
to be wearing...

520
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:41,105
in my little dream?
Disregard him.

521
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:42,185
Hmm.

522
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:46,385
That fish necklace,
and that's it.

523
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:49,025
Completely disregard him
tonight. He's drunk.

524
00:29:49,105 --> 00:29:52,465
Except for that necklace,
you're gonna be
one naked little Christian.

525
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,465
Pete, not that you're asking
for my advice...

526
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,665
but, listen, I would shut
the fuck up right now.

527
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:03,105
Yeah.

528
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,945
Hey. Sporty Nuts.
Pete.

529
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:11,305
If you don't get laid tonight,
fish necklace or no...

530
00:30:11,385 --> 00:30:13,545
it's 'cause
you're not trying, my son.

531
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,265
Pete, I hope you're
listening to me.

532
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:17,785
And if you play
your cards right...

533
00:30:19,105 --> 00:30:20,945
this hot-assed
little Jesus freak...

534
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:25,305
just might initiate you
into the Campus Crusade
for Cunnilingus.

535
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:29,825
Do you notice
that I am practicing
non-violent resistance...

536
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:33,185
in honor
of the Christmas holiday?

537
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:35,665
Because that's the way...

538
00:30:35,745 --> 00:30:39,585
baby Jesus
would have wanted me to do it.

539
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:46,785
That was unpleasant.
I think I scraped my tummy.

540
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:56,065
Hmm.

541
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:57,545
Oh, my nuts.

542
00:31:02,585 --> 00:31:04,545
I got it. I got it.

543
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,425
You sure?
I got it.

544
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:12,305
Oh, fuck.

545
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,905
Jesus Christ, Pete,
you had the whole
goddamn parking lot.

546
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:30,145
Why did you have
to throw up in the car?

547
00:31:30,225 --> 00:31:34,905
I think that boy drove
one of my testicles up
into my body cavity.

548
00:31:34,985 --> 00:31:36,385
Are you sure?

549
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:38,945
I don't know
where else it could be.

550
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,625
Okay, bounce me.

551
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:44,825
Again, again.

552
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:50,105
Now, three times fast.
Three times fast!

553
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:58,785
If you're trying
to shake the money
out of his pockets...

554
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:01,425
you gotta turn him
upside down first.

555
00:32:02,745 --> 00:32:03,905
Right.

556
00:32:04,905 --> 00:32:06,465
Think that did it.

557
00:32:06,585 --> 00:32:09,745
One, two. Yup.

558
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:11,905
We did it.

559
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:13,985
You have a good night,
Mr. Arglist.

560
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,585
Good night, now.

561
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:34,345
Take me home, buddy.
I know my limit.

562
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,585
You are home,
for Christ's sake, Pete.

563
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:44,105
Pants, pants, pants.

564
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:48,185
I got it, I got it,
I got it.

565
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,665
Do you remember
when you used to live here?

566
00:32:50,705 --> 00:32:52,185
Do you remember?
Yeah. I remember.

567
00:32:52,265 --> 00:32:54,145
This used to be your house.
Come on.

568
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:56,945
I got it, I got it, I got it.

569
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,065
I know the way.

570
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:00,105
Are you sure?
Buddy, I got it.

571
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:02,905
All right.
I got it, okay?

572
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,185
Man down.

573
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,665
Man down.

574
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:16,265
I thought I had it.

575
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:17,985
But I didn't.

576
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:20,425
I didn't have it.

577
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:27,065
Man still down.

578
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:30,225
Man remains down.

579
00:33:31,425 --> 00:33:33,185
Get some rest, pal.

580
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:25,745
Stop! Stop it!

581
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,265
Oh, fuck!

582
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:33,265
Oh my God!

583
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:35,185
Hi, Rusti.
Is Renata inside?

584
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:36,865
Oh, fuck!

585
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:39,545
Charlie, did you meet Donny?
Ronny.

586
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:42,905
Yeah. Donny had this
giant crush on me
back in high school.

587
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,265
Only I had no idea.

588
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:47,105
We had two classes together,
chemistry and something else.

589
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,305
We can't remember.

590
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:50,265
Anyway, so we're talking...

591
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:52,785
and remembering old times,
and guess what?

592
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:54,705
We're getting married.

593
00:34:54,785 --> 00:34:56,065
Oh, fuck!

594
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:57,745
Great.
Oh, God!

595
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:02,625
Listen. Let this night
be a reminder to you...

596
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:04,985
when you think
about using her...

597
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:07,265
As a punching bag.
All right?

598
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,305
All right?
Don't... All right?
Sidney.

599
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:11,865
Sidney.
All right.

600
00:35:12,745 --> 00:35:15,345
You do hear that siren, right?
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:19,105
Look, Charlie,
my blood was up, you know?

602
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:21,585
My mother's always telling me
I need to work on my anger.

603
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:23,665
Channel my energies
into something more positive.

604
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:25,105
Makes me
want to slap her silly.

605
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:27,305
Jesus Christ, Sidney,
you don't hit your mother,
do you?

606
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:28,585
Christ, no.

607
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:31,305
Charlie, I'm talking
about desires here,
that's all.

608
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:32,705
Urges and shit.

609
00:35:33,905 --> 00:35:35,785
Anyway, I gotta go.
Gotta pick up the kids.

610
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:37,225
We're going to Six Flags
tomorrow.

611
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:38,545
Good.
Yeah.

612
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,105
Is she back?
Oh, yeah.

613
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:42,465
She's gonna be pissed at me
'cause I'm leaving early.

614
00:35:42,545 --> 00:35:45,385
That's okay.
I got something for her,
to cheer her up.

615
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:48,705
Damn. You can read
the fine print
on the lubricant.

616
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:53,385
I didn't know you smoked.
I don't.

617
00:35:57,745 --> 00:36:00,625
I guess I thought
you'd be happier.
Happy?

618
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:04,865
I'm fucking ecstatic.
Can't you tell?

619
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:10,585
And in return for this,
you want exactly what?

620
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:13,465
Nothing.

621
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:16,265
Nothing.

622
00:36:18,705 --> 00:36:22,785
Charlie, I've been hearing
weird things about you
all night.

623
00:36:22,825 --> 00:36:23,865
Like what?

624
00:36:23,945 --> 00:36:26,505
Like waiving stage rentals
over at the Tease-O-Rama.

625
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,945
Comping dancers' drinks?
Not like you at all.

626
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,105
And now this.

627
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:40,145
Oh, my God.

628
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:43,945
You are leaving town.

629
00:36:53,185 --> 00:36:55,905
Have you and Vic
been dipping into the till?

630
00:36:55,985 --> 00:36:58,505
Steal from Bill?
That would be crazy.

631
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:06,505
Well, then there's only one
other possible explanation.

632
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:15,305
You're in love with me.

633
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,665
I've always liked you.

634
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,545
I've noticed.

635
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:33,225
Tell you what.
What?

636
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:37,545
Give me 45 minutes
to close up, then meet me
at my apartment.

637
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:39,745
All right.

638
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:41,545
Okay.

639
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:49,745
I forgot. Vic called.

640
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:53,785
Said to tell you
that you were right
and he was wrong.

641
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:58,465
Something about a guy
you thought might be
looking for you.

642
00:37:58,545 --> 00:37:59,985
Yeah?
He is.

643
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,225
This was when?

644
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:04,225
About half an hour ago.

645
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:08,465
Vic said for you to meet him
at the Velvet Touch
as soon as you can.

646
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,585
You sure nothing's going on?
Not a thing.

647
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:13,985
Don't forget to come back,
okay?

648
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:16,545
I won't.

649
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:38,065
Vic.

650
00:38:56,505 --> 00:38:59,185
<i>Harder. Oh, yeah.</i>

651
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,865
Vic, hate to interrupt!

652
00:39:08,785 --> 00:39:09,905
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

653
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,225
Come on, Vic.

654
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,665
<i>Don't stop.</i>

655
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:15,025
<i>Almost there.</i>

656
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:20,945
<i>Keep going. Keep going.</i>

657
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:30,665
Vic?

658
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:55,865
Fuck! Oh, fuck.

659
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:30,065
Mr. Arglist?

660
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:33,025
Oh, fuck!

661
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:39,345
Ouch, that had to hurt.
Yeah, it sure did.

662
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:41,385
What were you doing?

663
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:44,265
I was gonna be sick,
but now I'm okay.

664
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:46,905
Different car.

665
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,425
Yeah, it's my ex-wife's.
It's a long story.

666
00:40:50,065 --> 00:40:51,345
You don't look too good.

667
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:53,505
You want me to call somebody
to come get you?

668
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:56,385
No, no, I'm fine.
I'm headed home anyway.

669
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,505
Okay, Mr. Arglist.
You go home
and get some sleep.

670
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:02,145
And don't forget to put in
a good word for me
with Mr. Guerrard.

671
00:41:02,225 --> 00:41:04,305
I will, Officer.
Officer what?

672
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:08,625
Taylor.
Tyler.

673
00:41:09,225 --> 00:41:11,825
But it's pretty close,
though.
Yeah.

674
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:14,945
All right, tell you what.
When you go home...

675
00:41:15,025 --> 00:41:17,905
I don't think I'd come back
out again tonight,
if I were you.

676
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:20,265
No, I probably won't.
Good night to you.

677
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,145
Happy holidays.
Okay. All the best.

678
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:29,065
Oh, fuck.

679
00:42:46,305 --> 00:42:47,825
Hello?
<i>Renata.</i>

680
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:50,105
<i>Charlie.</i>
Listen.

681
00:42:50,665 --> 00:42:53,265
You were right.
Vic and I have been skimming.

682
00:42:53,345 --> 00:42:54,345
Well, duh.

683
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:56,425
<i>I think Roy Gelles</i>
<i>must have found out...</i>

684
00:42:56,505 --> 00:42:58,985
<i>and I think</i>
<i>he might have killed Vic.</i>

685
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:01,345
<i>That's terrible.</i>

686
00:43:01,425 --> 00:43:03,745
So, I was thinking
it might be best
if I left town.

687
00:43:03,825 --> 00:43:05,985
I was wondering
if you wanted to come with me.

688
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,985
You have the money?
What?

689
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,305
Which...
The money we're talking about.

690
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:14,065
That you and Vic
have been skimming.

691
00:43:14,145 --> 00:43:15,665
<i>Try to keep up, okay?</i>

692
00:43:15,745 --> 00:43:17,185
No. Vic had it.

693
00:43:17,465 --> 00:43:20,225
So, your idea is
that we should run away
together and be poor?

694
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:22,545
I thought I'd give it a shot.

695
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,105
<i>Here's the thing, though.</i>

696
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,465
Roy wouldn't have killed Vic
unless Vic told him
where the money was...

697
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:29,225
which means Roy has it now.

698
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:31,705
Well, why don't you sneak up
behind him...

699
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:35,305
and hit him over the head
with something and take it?

700
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:37,865
Me? You want me
to sneak up on Roy Gelles?

701
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:40,465
Charlie, think of this
as your defining moment.

702
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:42,705
<i>This is your chance</i>
<i>to be something more.</i>

703
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:44,305
Like a murderer?

704
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:46,625
<i>This is your chance</i>
<i>to start over, Charlie.</i>

705
00:43:46,705 --> 00:43:49,785
Our chance,
if that's what you want.

706
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:51,305
<i>If that's what I want.</i>

707
00:43:52,545 --> 00:43:54,545
Listen, I just gotta
ask you one thing.

708
00:43:54,985 --> 00:43:56,065
What?

709
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:01,705
I didn't have
a specific question planned.

710
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:03,505
Nothing, sorry.

711
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:04,785
Well, then...

712
00:44:54,465 --> 00:44:55,425
Gladys.

713
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,985
Gladys, it's me,
Charlie Arglist.

714
00:45:11,785 --> 00:45:13,665
Gladys, where is Vic?

715
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:20,585
It's a sweet thought, Charlie.
But she's already dead.

716
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:23,985
Jesus Christ,
you scared the fuck out of me!

717
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:27,665
I thought you were dead!
I thought Roy killed you.

718
00:45:27,745 --> 00:45:29,305
Well, he was going to.

719
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:32,105
But he got sidetracked.
You should have been there.

720
00:45:32,185 --> 00:45:33,825
He actually threatened
to shoot Gladys...

721
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:35,945
if I didn't tell him
where the money was.

722
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:36,985
But I think he was counting...

723
00:45:37,065 --> 00:45:39,385
on a level of commitment
and affection between
her and me...

724
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:40,745
that just simply wasn't there.

725
00:45:43,585 --> 00:45:44,985
Where is he now?

726
00:45:45,065 --> 00:45:47,065
Follow me.
You're gonna love this.

727
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:02,425
Hey, Roy!

728
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:05,505
You still alive in there?

729
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:09,465
You didn't asphyxiate yet,
did you?

730
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:11,345
Hey, Vic.

731
00:46:12,345 --> 00:46:14,945
Come a little closer,
so I can talk to you.

732
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,145
What's that, Roy?

733
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:19,345
Jesus fucking Christ!

734
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:24,985
Damn it, I took his gun.

735
00:46:27,145 --> 00:46:28,945
Guess he must have
another one.

736
00:46:29,065 --> 00:46:30,345
Must have.

737
00:46:30,505 --> 00:46:32,305
Is that you, Arglist?

738
00:46:34,865 --> 00:46:35,905
Hi, Roy.

739
00:46:35,985 --> 00:46:37,985
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna kill you.

740
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:39,145
You do know that, right?

741
00:46:39,225 --> 00:46:42,305
Roy, you must be
one fucking optimist...

742
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:44,505
if you think you're ever
getting out of that trunk.

743
00:46:44,585 --> 00:46:47,105
Let me out, Arglist.
I'm your only hope.

744
00:46:47,185 --> 00:46:49,985
Actually, you just told me
you'd kill me if you got out,
Roy.

745
00:46:51,785 --> 00:46:54,705
I didn't mean it.
Sounded like you did.

746
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:56,065
I was just pissed off.

747
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:58,025
It's cramped in here
and I'm claustrophobic.

748
00:46:58,105 --> 00:46:59,585
Come on.
Give me a hand.

749
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:01,065
Wanna go to the trunk?

750
00:47:01,145 --> 00:47:03,825
Already tried it.
Let's go to the back seat.

751
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,185
Ready?
Yeah.

752
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:10,185
That's one
big motherfucker.

753
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:14,585
One, two, three!

754
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:26,785
Oh, God damn.

755
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:29,465
We're gonna have to
take the door off.

756
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:32,585
It's not gonna fit.
You want me to get
the Mercedes?

757
00:47:32,665 --> 00:47:34,625
Mercedes? What Mercedes?

758
00:47:34,745 --> 00:47:37,625
My ex-wife's.
It's a long story.
Don't ask.

759
00:47:38,185 --> 00:47:40,625
There is no way
that this thing
is gonna fit...

760
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:43,385
in a piece-of-shit Mercedes
if it don't go in a Lincoln.

761
00:47:43,465 --> 00:47:45,785
No, they're surprisingly
spacious, Vic.

762
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:47,585
I'm offering you a deal,
Arglist.

763
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:49,185
Jesus fucking shit.
Give me something.

764
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:51,585
Don't be an idiot.
God damn it.

765
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:55,065
Fucking shut up!

766
00:47:58,025 --> 00:47:59,705
Shut the fuck up in there!

767
00:47:59,785 --> 00:48:02,425
You just keep
your fucking mouth shut, okay?

768
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:06,065
Piece of fucking shit!
God damn it!

769
00:48:11,145 --> 00:48:14,305
You keep that up,
you're gonna
spring the lock.

770
00:48:16,905 --> 00:48:19,745
What the fuck
were you thinking?
Why didn't you just shoot him?

771
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:21,505
And then you could have
put him in the trunk...

772
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:22,985
and you wouldn't need
that footlocker.

773
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:26,025
Because I want the pleasure
of seeing his big ass...

774
00:48:26,105 --> 00:48:29,105
sink to the bottom
of Lake Bascombe!
That's why!

775
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:32,145
Hey, Roy. Roy?

776
00:48:33,305 --> 00:48:36,545
I can't wait for you
to feel the icy water...

777
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,545
seeping into this trunk...

778
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,225
shriveling your balls
before you drown!

779
00:48:42,665 --> 00:48:44,465
What if he's reloaded?

780
00:48:48,465 --> 00:48:50,865
Well, he's folded up in there
like a card table.

781
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:52,745
How the hell
is he gonna reload?

782
00:48:52,905 --> 00:48:54,585
I don't know, Vic.

783
00:49:25,385 --> 00:49:26,825
She could never
do anything right.

784
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:29,425
Jesus.

785
00:49:33,385 --> 00:49:34,465
What?

786
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:38,785
Nothing. I just thought
you were gonna put
Roy in the trunk.

787
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:41,385
The footlocker might not fit
in the back seat, is all.

788
00:49:41,465 --> 00:49:43,145
You're the one
been going on...

789
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:44,625
about how spacious
these fuckers are.

790
00:49:44,745 --> 00:49:46,025
And now you're saying
it won't fit?

791
00:49:46,105 --> 00:49:48,545
It might.
I'm not sure,
is what I'm saying.

792
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:51,545
One night driving a Mercedes,
and already you're an asshole.

793
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,225
Come on,
help me get this thing.

794
00:49:59,145 --> 00:50:00,385
Ow! God damn it!

795
00:50:00,465 --> 00:50:01,865
If I could open
the fucking door...

796
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:09,425
Okay.

797
00:50:16,505 --> 00:50:19,145
Jesus, Charlie, you're right.
This thing is spacious.

798
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:22,265
There's no way it would
have gone in a Lincoln.

799
00:50:22,345 --> 00:50:24,265
Give me the key.
Oh, yeah.

800
00:50:25,265 --> 00:50:27,425
All right.
I gotta get my shit.

801
00:50:30,745 --> 00:50:32,265
Oh, Vic?

802
00:50:33,545 --> 00:50:34,665
What?

803
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:37,425
Whose thumb is this?

804
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:41,225
Oh, yeah. Good news, Roy.
Charlie brought your thumb.

805
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:48,945
So, you think you're
going to go back to Florida?

806
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:50,665
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

807
00:50:50,745 --> 00:50:52,585
Maybe you shouldn't tell me
where you're going...

808
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:54,145
and I shouldn't tell you
where I'm going.

809
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:56,585
I just think
it's safer that way.

810
00:50:56,665 --> 00:50:58,625
He's going to kill you,
Arglist.

811
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:00,505
That's where you're going.

812
00:51:00,585 --> 00:51:02,505
It's the truth, Arglist!

813
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:04,225
Think about it.

814
00:51:04,305 --> 00:51:06,705
Pay no attention
to the man in the trunk.

815
00:51:13,465 --> 00:51:16,265
He's got a gun, Roy. He could
shoot me now if he wanted to.

816
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:19,585
Uh-uh. He needs your help
to unload the car.

817
00:51:20,905 --> 00:51:24,545
Once he's deposited me
and his missus in the lake...

818
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:26,105
you're next.

819
00:51:26,505 --> 00:51:28,105
You know what, Roy?

820
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:30,745
One more word
out of that trunk...

821
00:51:31,065 --> 00:51:32,705
and I'm gonna shoot it
at both ends.

822
00:51:32,745 --> 00:51:36,545
Because the truth is,
I can't remember which end
your head's at.

823
00:51:43,825 --> 00:51:46,585
You know, the fact
of the matter is,
I should shoot you.

824
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:49,545
What were you doing
in there tonight?

825
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:52,025
What are you talking about?
Well, you're
waiving stage fees...

826
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:54,105
you're comping drinks,
being nice to people.

827
00:51:54,185 --> 00:51:56,065
You may as well
wear a fucking sign
that says:

828
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:59,225
"Hey, I just stole
a shitload of money
and now I'm blowing town."

829
00:51:59,305 --> 00:52:01,225
For Christ's sake...
Calm down! It's Christmas.

830
00:52:01,305 --> 00:52:02,825
Everybody's nice
on Christmas.

831
00:52:02,905 --> 00:52:06,145
No, Charlie. No.
Only morons are nice
at Christmas.

832
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:09,145
And that's a lot of people,
too, Charlie.

833
00:52:09,225 --> 00:52:11,785
Especially in Kansas.
But not everybody.

834
00:52:12,745 --> 00:52:14,945
What kind of man
shoots his own wife...

835
00:52:15,025 --> 00:52:17,345
in the back of the head
on Christmas Eve?

836
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,785
Roy, he already knows
that you shot her, okay?

837
00:52:20,985 --> 00:52:23,185
That's what he told you,
Arglist?

838
00:52:23,305 --> 00:52:26,265
What the hell
do I want to shoot
his wife for?

839
00:52:26,545 --> 00:52:29,585
Bill Guerrard knows
about this whole deal,
Arglist.

840
00:52:29,705 --> 00:52:31,705
That's not what
you said earlier, Roy...

841
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:33,905
when your thumb
was in the vise.

842
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,945
You'll never make it
out of Wichita.

843
00:52:36,025 --> 00:52:38,345
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but did I not warn
that asshole...

844
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:39,385
to shut the fuck up?

845
00:52:39,505 --> 00:52:41,025
You told him.
You got one chance, Arglist...

846
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:42,345
That's right. I told him.
Take the wheel.

847
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,385
...and that's me.
Take the fucking wheel!

848
00:52:46,865 --> 00:52:48,425
Think about it!

849
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:53,145
Fucking asshole.

850
00:52:55,265 --> 00:52:57,185
Well, I guess
that was the head end, huh?

851
00:52:59,305 --> 00:53:00,745
Where's the thumb?

852
00:53:01,505 --> 00:53:03,265
The thumb,
where's the thumb?

853
00:53:06,505 --> 00:53:07,745
Thank you, sir.

854
00:53:32,945 --> 00:53:34,425
There she is.

855
00:53:38,665 --> 00:53:40,585
It's kind of beautiful
out here, huh?

856
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:50,465
All right, give her a shove.

857
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:55,785
Well, come on.
Open the fucking door and help
me with this goddamn thing.

858
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,305
What do you think
we're here for?
Come on.

859
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:07,345
Jesus.

860
00:54:07,465 --> 00:54:09,465
Hang on! It's caught.

861
00:54:11,945 --> 00:54:12,985
Okay.

862
00:54:20,185 --> 00:54:21,145
Okay.

863
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:38,985
Now toss it over.
Come on.

864
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:53,185
For fuck's sake, Charlie,
come on.

865
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,825
Fuck, this is heavy.

866
00:54:59,905 --> 00:55:01,305
It says, "Keep off."

867
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:16,705
All right, ready?
Let's go.

868
00:55:17,145 --> 00:55:18,745
Think I'd rather push.

869
00:55:18,825 --> 00:55:21,465
Okay, fucking push.
I don't give a shit.

870
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:26,865
You're in the way, Charlie.

871
00:55:35,945 --> 00:55:38,585
Okay, let's go. Ready?
Yeah.

872
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:56,465
It's falling apart.

873
00:56:13,225 --> 00:56:15,425
You know what?
Put it up on its end.

874
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:16,865
Just shove it up.

875
00:56:16,945 --> 00:56:18,945
I mean, it's as deep here
as it is any place else.

876
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:21,105
Just throw
the fucking thing over.

877
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,545
Vic.

878
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:43,025
God damn it, Roy.
That was just blind
fucking luck, you asshole.

879
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:46,825
Give me a hand, Arglist.
I'm all stiff.

880
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:57,705
Now, as promised.

881
00:56:58,705 --> 00:57:01,745
Well, Roy, the good news is,
you're out of the trunk.

882
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:05,145
The bad news is,
you're down four quarts
of blood...

883
00:57:05,745 --> 00:57:07,465
and your gun's empty.

884
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:13,225
I'm going to kill you anyway.

885
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:15,545
Here, hold this.

886
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,345
That's an unrealistic goal,
Roy.

887
00:57:23,025 --> 00:57:24,665
You're dead, Roy.

888
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,465
Don't just stand there
pretending you're not.

889
00:57:39,145 --> 00:57:40,985
Jesus Christ, Charlie!

890
00:57:41,065 --> 00:57:43,905
Throw me a rope or something.
I can't swim!

891
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:45,745
I'm thinking, no.

892
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,145
You were gonna kill me,
right, Vic?
You asshole!

893
00:57:51,585 --> 00:57:53,345
Jesus, you're stupid!

894
00:57:57,065 --> 00:57:59,145
All right, that's it!
Fuck you!

895
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,625
Look, okay, I'm sorry!

896
00:58:02,705 --> 00:58:04,705
Charlie, I'm sorry!

897
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:07,345
I'm going to throw
the gun away! Look!

898
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:13,025
Oh, God, you have no idea
how cold this water is.

899
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,105
Charlie.

900
00:58:19,505 --> 00:58:20,545
So long, Vic.

901
00:58:21,425 --> 00:58:24,225
Don't you want to know
where the money is?

902
00:58:24,745 --> 00:58:27,825
I know where the money is.
It's in the back seat
of the Benz.

903
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:30,905
Not a chance! Not a chance.

904
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:33,905
I'm done talking to you, Vic.
I'm through listening to you.

905
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:36,545
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself!

906
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:39,665
Only hurry! Hurry!
I can't feel my legs!

907
00:58:39,745 --> 00:58:41,825
I'm dying here! I'm dying!

908
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:46,505
Charlie! God damn it!

909
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:51,225
I know what I did was wrong!
But, Jesus! Fuck!

910
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:57,865
I'm shot, Charlie.
I can't pull myself up!

911
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,105
Please. Please.

912
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:07,185
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be his name,
because...

913
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,825
We are kingdom come,
and will be done...

914
00:59:09,865 --> 00:59:12,545
and give us every day...

915
00:59:12,585 --> 00:59:14,945
our bread,
because we gotta eat...

916
00:59:19,505 --> 00:59:22,305
Charlie, is that you? Charlie!

917
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:27,025
I knew it. I knew it.
You're a good man, Charlie.

918
00:59:27,145 --> 00:59:28,545
You're a good man.

919
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:31,785
Vic, I wouldn't want you
to die alone.

920
00:59:38,145 --> 00:59:39,905
No! No.

921
00:59:41,105 --> 00:59:42,105
No!

922
00:59:57,865 --> 00:59:59,985
Vic! Vic, hold on!

923
01:00:01,105 --> 01:00:02,585
Hold on, Vic.

924
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:05,665
Is that all?

925
01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:08,585
Yeah.

926
01:01:16,785 --> 01:01:18,465
Stocking stuffers.

927
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:20,865
Big spender.

928
01:01:21,585 --> 01:01:24,385
Do you have any kids?
No.

929
01:01:24,425 --> 01:01:27,385
Then shut the fuck up.
Bag it.

930
01:01:32,425 --> 01:01:35,265
<i>Hello. Charlie?</i>
Renata.

931
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:37,465
I'd just about given up.

932
01:01:37,545 --> 01:01:38,985
I fucked up.

933
01:01:40,465 --> 01:01:41,665
Vic's dead.

934
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,065
What about Roy Gelles?

935
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,425
He's dead, too.

936
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,465
Why don't you come over?

937
01:01:50,785 --> 01:01:53,705
<i>I'll wait here for you.</i>
<i>The front door's open.</i>

938
01:01:53,825 --> 01:01:56,385
No. I don't see the point.
I mean...

939
01:01:57,105 --> 01:01:59,065
I don't have the money.

940
01:01:59,745 --> 01:02:01,625
Vic died before he told me
where it was.

941
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:05,545
You know what?
Money isn't everything.

942
01:02:06,225 --> 01:02:07,585
Excuse me?

943
01:02:08,585 --> 01:02:11,745
You know what I said before?
It's true, isn't it?

944
01:02:13,505 --> 01:02:17,225
<i>You're in love with me.</i>
Yeah.

945
01:02:18,145 --> 01:02:19,665
<i>Sure. I guess.</i>

946
01:02:20,705 --> 01:02:22,945
I've still got to ask you
something.

947
01:02:24,145 --> 01:02:25,105
What?

948
01:02:28,865 --> 01:02:31,985
I don't have it yet.
I'm sorry.

949
01:02:32,145 --> 01:02:34,945
<i>But you're coming over?</i>
Yeah. Sure.

950
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:36,745
See you.

951
01:03:16,385 --> 01:03:18,825
Take me with you, man.
Oh, fuck.

952
01:03:21,185 --> 01:03:23,385
Jesus, Pete.
No, I mean it.

953
01:03:23,745 --> 01:03:24,825
Take me with you, buddy.

954
01:03:27,465 --> 01:03:31,105
I can't do my life, man.
I can't do it.

955
01:03:31,505 --> 01:03:33,145
Just get some rest.

956
01:03:33,265 --> 01:03:35,465
I hate myself.
I want a new life.

957
01:03:38,545 --> 01:03:41,025
You don't want mine.
I really do.

958
01:03:43,265 --> 01:03:44,785
I'm in trouble.

959
01:03:46,465 --> 01:03:49,305
I'm in big fucking trouble.

960
01:03:49,385 --> 01:03:51,945
But that'd be great.
Don't you see?

961
01:03:52,105 --> 01:03:53,705
We go out in a blaze of glory.

962
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:59,065
Like men.
Like men, Charlie.

963
01:04:01,585 --> 01:04:04,225
No goddamn life left
for men anymore.

964
01:04:05,985 --> 01:04:07,265
Not here.

965
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:10,625
This country,
all that's left for men
is money and pussy.

966
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:15,785
But together,
you and me together...

967
01:04:25,585 --> 01:04:27,185
Don't you think?

968
01:06:09,185 --> 01:06:11,505
Come on. Hurry up.

969
01:06:11,585 --> 01:06:14,185
Bill Guerrard
is around here somewhere.

970
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,305
Oh.
Yeah, "Oh."

971
01:06:23,745 --> 01:06:25,145
Where is he?

972
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:26,945
Oh.

973
01:06:26,985 --> 01:06:29,505
Hide behind the door
and shoot him
when he comes in.

974
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,585
You don't happen to have
any bullets for this, do you?

975
01:06:32,985 --> 01:06:35,425
</i>

976
01:06:40,065 --> 01:06:41,665
Shotgun behind the bar.

977
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:44,105
"As Wichita falls...

978
01:06:44,385 --> 01:06:47,225
"so falls Wichita Falls."

979
01:06:50,025 --> 01:06:50,985
I like that.

980
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,705
And I'm gonna give
your pussy-whipped pal
Arglist...

981
01:06:53,825 --> 01:06:56,385
another 15 minutes
to rescue your sweet ass.

982
01:06:57,585 --> 01:07:01,425
After which time
I'm going to assume his brain
overruled his pecker.

983
01:07:01,865 --> 01:07:05,345
Well, Bill,
that's just not enough time.

984
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:07,705
He lives way across town.

985
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:11,185
Yeah? Well, that's your
bad luck. I should be home
in Kansas City...

986
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:13,825
watching my kids
open their Christmas presents!

987
01:07:13,865 --> 01:07:15,425
Now I gotta waste
the whole fucking day...

988
01:07:15,505 --> 01:07:17,145
Iooking for that nitwit!

989
01:07:18,185 --> 01:07:20,465
I'll never understand lawyers.

990
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:25,505
I mean, here they've got
a license to steal
from the general public...

991
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:28,305
all legal and aboveboard,
but is that enough?

992
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:31,065
Fuck, no!
They gotta steal
from their friends!

993
01:07:32,385 --> 01:07:34,985
Anybody
but a fucking lawyer...

994
01:07:36,305 --> 01:07:38,985
would consider
the consequences, right?

995
01:07:39,105 --> 01:07:42,625
That I would,
for an absolute certainty...

996
01:07:42,665 --> 01:07:46,185
castrate that son of a bitch
with a butter knife.

997
01:07:46,465 --> 01:07:49,505
And that would give
a normal person pause.

998
01:07:49,825 --> 01:07:51,465
But not a lawyer.

999
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:55,425
It defies the imagination,
you know.

1000
01:07:56,545 --> 01:08:00,825
How a woman like you
could throw in with
a couple of farthammers...

1001
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:02,905
like Cavanaugh and Arglist.

1002
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,625
Cavanaugh, he doesn't
have the brains...

1003
01:08:06,705 --> 01:08:08,145
to pull off
something like this.

1004
01:08:08,225 --> 01:08:10,785
And Arglist,
he doesn't have the guts.

1005
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,665
Maybe that's where you
came in, huh?

1006
01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:21,705
What did you do?

1007
01:08:22,985 --> 01:08:25,185
Did you encourage them both?

1008
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,025
Suppose you do luck out...

1009
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:43,425
and you get clear of Wichita
with all that money.

1010
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:44,665
At some point...

1011
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:48,225
you're gonna have
to get rid of at least
one of the peckerwoods.

1012
01:08:48,305 --> 01:08:49,945
And then what do you got?

1013
01:08:51,985 --> 01:08:53,505
A dick with no brain?

1014
01:08:54,145 --> 01:08:56,105
Or a brain with no dick?

1015
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:04,585
You know what, Bill?

1016
01:09:05,105 --> 01:09:07,025
You seem awfully tense.

1017
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:12,065
And I have this idea
of what might help you relax.

1018
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:15,785
You do, huh?

1019
01:09:15,865 --> 01:09:16,825
Mmm-hmm.

1020
01:09:29,825 --> 01:09:31,265
That you, Arglist?

1021
01:09:32,545 --> 01:09:33,945
Drop the gun.

1022
01:09:35,105 --> 01:09:37,905
Step away from the desk
and put your hands up.

1023
01:09:37,985 --> 01:09:40,785
Charlie,
don't be a fucking idiot.

1024
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:44,145
You've been watching
too many stupid old movies.

1025
01:09:44,705 --> 01:09:46,025
Why would I drop my gun?

1026
01:09:46,145 --> 01:09:47,825
I don't know, Bill.

1027
01:09:48,065 --> 01:09:49,425
Because I got
a big fucking shotgun...

1028
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:50,625
and I'll blow your head off?

1029
01:09:50,705 --> 01:09:52,905
Well, if you could do that,
you'd be me...

1030
01:09:53,025 --> 01:09:55,385
and I'd be a pissant lawyer
with a case of the shakes.

1031
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:57,665
Jesus, Charlie,
just shoot him!

1032
01:10:01,545 --> 01:10:02,825
If he was gonna
pull the trigger...

1033
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:05,305
he'd have done it when he came
through the door, girlie.

1034
01:10:05,385 --> 01:10:07,585
It's something they don't
teach you in law school.

1035
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:09,425
Which is a shame,
because...

1036
01:10:19,705 --> 01:10:21,185
Get his gun, Charlie.

1037
01:10:23,145 --> 01:10:24,585
Get his gun.

1038
01:10:25,505 --> 01:10:26,625
He's dead, Renata.

1039
01:10:26,665 --> 01:10:29,465
The fuck he is!
Sidney loads
that with birdshot!

1040
01:10:29,505 --> 01:10:30,865
Why would he? I mean...
Charlie.

1041
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:33,585
...from a liability
standpoint, that doesn't
make any sense at all.

1042
01:10:33,665 --> 01:10:34,785
Charlie!

1043
01:10:38,785 --> 01:10:40,425
Well, Arglist...

1044
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:43,425
now you've truly gone
and shit in your nest!

1045
01:10:47,545 --> 01:10:50,345
All right, girlie.
You first.

1046
01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:51,585
Mr. Guerrard?

1047
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:54,705
What's going on?

1048
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,905
Come here!

1049
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:19,865
Bitch!

1050
01:11:24,345 --> 01:11:25,425
Charlie.

1051
01:11:27,945 --> 01:11:30,825
I don't know why
I even bother with Kansas.

1052
01:11:30,945 --> 01:11:32,705
Do I hear an "amen"?

1053
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,705
My old man tried
to tell me...

1054
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:39,465
that I'd be better off
starting a church...

1055
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,185
and letting Jesus pay
for the mortgage...

1056
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:45,945
in this sorry-ass
backwards state.

1057
01:11:46,905 --> 01:11:48,225
I wouldn't listen.

1058
01:11:48,865 --> 01:11:49,945
Instead...

1059
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:54,265
I put my faith
in naked women and hand jobs.

1060
01:11:54,465 --> 01:11:57,985
Which have a proven track
record everywhere but here.

1061
01:12:03,105 --> 01:12:06,905
And now I've been disfigured
by a whisky-dick lawyer...

1062
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:11,545
who imagines he can kill me
with a shotgun loaded
for snake.

1063
01:12:13,985 --> 01:12:15,585
Serves me right.

1064
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:17,825
That's all I can say.

1065
01:12:21,065 --> 01:12:22,745
All right, girlie...

1066
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:25,385
this is the one
that's gonna kill you.

1067
01:12:26,785 --> 01:12:27,865
Bill.

1068
01:12:39,465 --> 01:12:40,425
Yuck!

1069
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,385
I will say, after this...

1070
01:12:59,425 --> 01:13:02,625
the holidays are never
gonna feel quite the same
to me.

1071
01:13:05,505 --> 01:13:08,505
How's the foot?
Shorter.

1072
01:13:09,545 --> 01:13:11,825
You don't happen to have
any morphine...

1073
01:13:11,905 --> 01:13:13,665
or Demerol or anything,
do you?

1074
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:15,905
Try this.

1075
01:13:20,385 --> 01:13:22,345
I have to give you credit,
Charlie.

1076
01:13:23,905 --> 01:13:27,305
You took your own sweet time
rising to the occasion...

1077
01:13:27,425 --> 01:13:30,665
but in the end,
you did the deed.

1078
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:33,985
'Deed you did.

1079
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:44,425
You really came through,
Charlie.

1080
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:48,585
The odds were definitely
against it, but somehow...

1081
01:13:48,705 --> 01:13:51,425
you managed to be
the last man standing.

1082
01:14:34,265 --> 01:14:35,865
I know what I wanted
to ask you.

1083
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:40,665
What?
Where are you actually from?

1084
01:14:41,305 --> 01:14:42,625
Originally.

1085
01:14:45,345 --> 01:14:48,105
Why do you keep
asking questions, Charlie?

1086
01:14:48,745 --> 01:14:50,385
What's it got to do
with anything?

1087
01:14:52,745 --> 01:14:54,465
I was just curious.

1088
01:14:55,865 --> 01:14:58,265
Wanted to know
where you came from.

1089
01:15:12,985 --> 01:15:14,985
It's a long story,
Charlie.

1090
01:15:15,105 --> 01:15:18,905
I think we've got plenty
of time to get to know
each other better.

1091
01:15:19,425 --> 01:15:21,785
Don't you?
Yeah.

1092
01:15:22,945 --> 01:15:24,025
I guess we do.

1093
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:26,465
It's just you and me now,
Charlie.

1094
01:15:31,225 --> 01:15:33,385
To the victor go the spoils.

1095
01:15:44,385 --> 01:15:46,505
You saved my life,
Charlie.

1096
01:15:47,425 --> 01:15:49,945
You're a different man,
just like I promised.

1097
01:15:52,665 --> 01:15:54,265
Can you feel it?

1098
01:15:55,905 --> 01:15:58,505
Yes. I can.

1099
01:16:02,465 --> 01:16:04,185
Charlie.

1100
01:16:07,585 --> 01:16:09,145
What'd you do?

1101
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:21,025
Oh! Damn stupid fuck!

1102
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,065
You stupid fucking whore!

1103
01:17:24,665 --> 01:17:27,425
You dumb, dumb fuck!

1104
01:17:27,465 --> 01:17:29,465
Your mother again?
Shit!

1105
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:33,385
Hi, Charlie. Yeah.
Who else?

1106
01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:38,505
Loans me her camper
and fails to mention
that it's out of gas.

1107
01:17:38,785 --> 01:17:41,985
If you've got a gas can,
you can siphon some from me.

1108
01:18:13,025 --> 01:18:14,305
Charlie.

1109
01:18:15,745 --> 01:18:18,065
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way...

1110
01:18:20,385 --> 01:18:24,225
but you're about
the nicest guy I know.

1111
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:29,625
I'm awfully sorry
to hear that, Sidney,
but thank you.

1112
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:33,305
Have a good time
with your kids at Six Flags.

1113
01:18:34,825 --> 01:18:36,425
Merry Christmas.

1114
01:19:22,505 --> 01:19:24,025
Nuts! Fuck!

1115
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,705
What was that?

1116
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,185
Nothing.

1117
01:20:10,665 --> 01:20:13,825
Morning, Pete.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1118
01:20:16,385 --> 01:20:17,865
Where are we?

1119
01:20:18,465 --> 01:20:20,025
We're in heaven.

1120
01:20:21,185 --> 01:20:22,425
Mmm.

1121
01:20:25,785 --> 01:20:28,545
They got pancakes?
They got everything.

1122
01:20:29,185 --> 01:20:30,265
Good.
