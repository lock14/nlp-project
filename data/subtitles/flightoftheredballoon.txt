Hey, balloon!
Come here.
Are you coming?
Come on.
Are you listening?
If you come...
I'll give you something.
Something bigger|than you can imagine.
I'll give you a hundred candies.
Two million caramel bars.
Anything you want if you come.
It's not listening.
Balloon, are you coming or not?
You heard me.
So you're coming with me?
One last time.
Are you coming back|to my place or not?
No answer.
So that's a "No."
You're so stupid.
Flight of the Red Balloon
Alas. Alas. Alas.
Thrice Alas.
What misfortune.
Qiong Lian. What price|are you paying for our dalliance?
The Dragon King|has sequestered your beloved.
He holds her|in the depths of the sea.
How can you hope to find her?
But you must try.|Find her.
- Throw yourself into the ocean.
Since my despair is boundless...
I will boil the ocean|until no drop remains.
My resolve will be dauntless.|Dauntless.
Know this|and tell the world.
I will boil the ocean dry|to find and rescue my beloved.
Yay, nothing will stop me.
You hear me?
What joy!
I will swim away|to alert my mistress.
We could|see your head, Mathieu.
So there was no surprise.
It was...
- At the start?|- Right.
We go on or go back?
We go on or go back?
Let's do it again.
Yes, let's do it again.
It's going a bit fast.|Take a breath.
Let's do it again.
Where from?
Yes, that's true.|I get tricked.
"The sea is rough."
Where did you say it was?
I'm fairly easy-going.|You don't need to be formal.
OK.
- You don't seem shy.|- Pardon?
You don't seem shy.
- You don't think so? I think I am.|- A bit shy?
No need to be, just relax.
OK, wait for me.
- Shall I close the window?|- No need.
Simon. OK?
- Everything OK?|- Yes.
Let me introduce Song.
She's the one I told you about.
You're OK?
You're trapped.|Hang on.
Why doesn't it work?
This car is really useless.
How does it work?
Anyhow, Simon, this is Song.|Song, Simon.
Get to know each other.
Anyhow, you need to get out.|Use my door, if you don't mind.
Climb across.
You're going to the bakery|to buy a cake.
Give me your things.
There's one bakery that Simon loves.|You'll show her the bakery?
- You'll show her the bakery?|- Yes.
He always buys a little cake
and has it when he gets home.
So I'll see you back there.|I have to go back to the rehearsal.
Let's see, what else?
The key... it's in his schoolbag.
Try to get it copied.
Does Simon know|where to get keys copied?
You know, don't you?
- I'll see you later.|- OK, see you later.
Show her where we live.|Tell her.
- See you later.|See you later.
- Bakery first or keys first?|- Let's do the keys first.
My name is Song.
And I'm Simon.
I was a student in Beijing.
- Where's that?|- In China.
I studied film.
- What kind of film?|- Pardon?
What kind of film?
Films in general.
Have you ever seen a movie called|The Red Balloon?
It's a really old movie,|made in 1956.
It's about a boy|and a big red balloon.
Give me a moment.
Can you see anything?
- Look, you see it?|- Oh, yeah.
Shall we go?
- The big door over there?|- Yes, next to the bin.
OK.
Watch out.
What's the entry code?
OK.
- Song?|- Yes?
What time is it?
Around half past five.|Half past five or six o'clock.
- You want to know exactly?|- No.
You want to sit down?
No, I'll stay on my feet.
Not too tired, holding the camera?
I'm fine.
That could be|my piano teacher, Anna.
Or it might be Mama.
Hello.
- I'm Anna, the piano teacher.|- All right.
My name is Song Fang.|Just call me Song, it's easier.
- You're Simon's new nanny.|- That's correct.
- Nice to meet you.|- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, Anna.|- Hello, scamp.
What's that you have there?
- It's just Song's camera.|- I see, it's not yours.
Been playing with it?
- Do you want me to do it?|- You'd better do it.
OK, get the score out.
Are we practicing scales?
Don't bother with that,|it's not worth the trouble.
OK.
Are we doing scales or this piece?
- Shall we start with scales?|- OK.
G scale or C scale?
Start with C scale.
Here we go.
Watch your posture.
Hi, how are you doing?
Hi, Simon.
Let's do it again.|You got mixed up with the fingering.
Watch your wrists|and sit up right.
Try to be relaxed.
Sorry.
My name is Song.|I'm looking after Simon.
Marc said you were coming.
I'm Marc's girlfriend,|who lives here.
I'm sorry, I forgot|Simon had a lesson today.
Have you made progress|on the next section?
- Is that a yes?
- Go on, show me.|- About here.
You got to there?
- Can I help you?|- I'm OK, thanks.
That wasn't bad.
You have to be|more precise, though.
You're hesitating. Read the score.|Watch the fingering.
Got it? Shall we do it again?|Be precise.
I'll come back later.
Good, apart from that bit.
Try again, just this section.
Hi, I need to use Suzanne's cooker.
Can I?
- You are...?|- I live downstairs, I'm Marc.
My name is Song Fang.|I'm Simon's new nanny.
- I see.|- We've already met.
I just need to use the cooker
because the piano lesson|hasn't finished yet.
Would you mind if I call Suzanne first?|Because it's my first time to...
- Go ahead.|- I'm sorry.
No, no problem.
I just want to clear it with her|because I'm new here.
You can put the...
Drop those in the kitchen,|I'll speak to her myself.
Unwrap the meat first.
Yes, I'll put it in the fridge.
Hello, Song speaking.
Hello, Suzanne,|I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you have a moment?
Yes, Marc is here.
Marc is here and wants a word.
- I'll pass you to him.|- Thanks.
Suzanne?|Yes, it's Marc.
Fine, thanks.
Listen, I'm preparing for a dinner party.
I'm doing a mutton stew.
It needs a long, slow cook.
I was going to do a leg of mutton|but I've ended up doing a stew.
Anyhow, it needs to cook|for four hours.
And meanwhile|I've also got to do vegetables.
I'm steaming them,|to serve with an aioli.
No, no, don't worry about that.
Of course if you'd like to join the dinner,|you'd be welcome.
Anyhow, what I'd like to do is...
No, no, it won't take that long,|I promise you.
The stew's already on.
No, no, don't worry.
No, don't worry...
Listen, in any case, the stew|is already on downstairs.
I just want to steam|the vegetables up here.
My little cooker's too small.
So you don't mind me doing|the veg up here?
OK?
OK, don't worry about that.
See you later.
- Agreed.|- OK.
It's fine, thank you.
Don't mention it.
Wait, I'm going to clear this mess.
We have to make sure we ventilate.|She doesn't want the kitchen to smell.
So we need to get the smaller one|from downstairs and bring it here.
- You're OK?|- Yes.
It smells.
Yes, Marc was here this afternoon.
Oh, I can't believe this.
They're a pain in the neck.
What a goddamn mess.
I'm sick of it.
Sorry.
Just look at this.
I don't believe it.
Can I help?
Unbelievable.
They're taking the piss.
Sorry.
You want a biscuit?
No, thanks.
Everything went well?
Yes, Simon's so nice.
He's...?
In the bathroom.
He's very gentle.
You managed to figure out|the schedule?
Yes, I had a look earlier on.
Any questions?
No, it's fine.|Anna was here.
She gave Simon his piano lesson.
- It went OK?|- Yes.
Great.|She's nice, isn't she?
Yes, she's nice|and you can see she loves Simon.
Yes, yes.
There's something I must give you.
This is for the door here.|And this is for the door downstairs.
Wait, you made copies,|I completely forgot.
Sorry about that.
Simon took me|to the key-cutter this afternoon.
Is that work you're doing there?
No, in fact...|Well, take a look.
I filmed Simon this afternoon.
Also to help me a bit|in remembering the way.
He looks good, doesn't he?
Yes, he has a nice face.
You know I saw your film?
I know I mentioned it before|But I really liked it.
- Really?|- Yes.
It's called Origins, right?
Damn it. Leave it, leave it.
I found it very touching.
That's great.
It has a certain abstract quality.
It reminded me of childhood.
My room was on a mezzanine too.
When my parents were together,
I could hear everything.|It was like an echo chamber.
When my parents|put the key in the lock,
I heard it.|Your film somehow brought all that back.
Sounds, images...
You know, that darkness|that's sometimes there in your imagery.
The kind of thing I remembered was...
my mother slamming the door.
My father pacing around the house.
Me, slipping into bed|with both of them,
trying to hold their hands.
Your film touches on very deep feelings|I'd almost forgotten.
- Who's that?|- I don't know.
Hello.
Hi.
- Would you like some tea?|- Would you like one?
I'd love one, thanks.
- We'll have to wait for a bit.|- That's fine.
Bit of a madhouse in the kitchen.
A bit, yes.
When will Marc get back?
He is back,|we're just waiting for our guests.
You think he could|spare me a moment?
Just for a chat.
There are things we need to discuss.
We have a real problem here.
I think he'll be up shortly,|you can talk to him then.
It's me again.
- Where's Suzanne?|- In the bathroom.
- Suzanne!|- What?
Guess who I'm with.
- I've no idea.|- Gregory.
We're still hoping you'll join our dinner.|It'll be ready very soon.
That's very kind of you, but I'm eating out|with Song and Simon this evening.
If you're sure...
I've already booked a table.
Have you heard from Pierre?
How's his novel coming along|in Montreal?
He's a bit stuck.
He's going to stay there longer.
I read a review of your new show.|Pretty good. In fact, it was a rave.
I didn't quite get it.|There's someone who boils the sea...?
Can you tell me more about it?
Not right now.
Is everything OK?
- Suzanne?|- What?
Anything wrong?
I'm fine.
OK then.|I'll stop by again.
See you.
I'll follow you.
There he is.
Mama loves puppets|like that lady there.
Louise told me.
Who's Louise?
My sister.|She lives in Brussels.
You have a sister?
Well... she's a pretend sister.
Because she's not my real sister.
Then what is she?
It's because my parents divorced.
That's all I know.
They're divorced, and Louise...
She's like a sister.
Except she's not my real sister.
I sort of understand.
There's a girl playing with puppets.
Who's disguised herself|as a man.
Actually, she's hiding,|disguised as a man.
- Which one?|There, on the statue.
So this girl is working the puppets...
and it's the one|below the man who is...
- in disguise.|- In disguise?
You come here often?
Yes, very, very often.
Who brought you here?
Depends when you mean.
- When I was small or when I got older?|- Hm?
When I was small or when I got older?
When you were small.
Daddy.
When did you start playing pinball?
- When I was two.|- Two?
- Or one.|- One?
You could walk at that age?
No, back then|I had to sit in a highchair to play pinball.
- By yourself?|- Yes.
Amazing. You were a child prodigy.
I don't know that much.
Your dad taught you to play pinball?
Yes.
And you used to|come here a lot?
- Yes, a lot.|- Every day?
Almost every day.
- Every second day.|- Hm?
Every second day.
Dad liked pinball too?
Yes, he loved it.
He was good at it?
Yes.
And who else?
My sister Louise.|the one who lives in Brussels.
She's the one who takes me to cafés|to play pinball these days.
Louise too?
Now she lives in...
Brussels.
And you see her...
Every summer.
She doesn't visit at other times.
She likes playing pinball too?
You have enough cash to pay?
- Hello.|- Hello.
Anyone there?
- What would you like?|- I'd like a mint cordial.
And a grenadine juice.
It costs one euro
for two songs.
What do you want to hear?
"Take Me Away"?
OK.
Input the number.|94.
And then 20.
Here you go.
- Are you sure?|- Yeah.
We have to wait.
# Towards the quays.|Where I'm weighed down
# By pressures and boredom
# The ships are docking|Their bowels emptied of cargo
# They come from the ends of the earth|Bringing feckless notions
# Tinged with reflections of blue skies|And mirages
# There's a sharp, lingering scent|Of unknown lands
# Of endless summers|Of living near-naked
# On beaches
# I, who have spent my whole life|Under northern skies
# I long to wash away the gray|By jumping on board
# Take me away|To the ends of the earth
# Take me away|To the land of wonders
# Surely my misery
# Would be more bearable|In the sunshine
# In the bars as night falls
# With the sailors
# When the talk is of women and love
# Glasses in our hands
# I lose track of things
# Suddenly my thoughts|Carry me off and set me down
# In a wonderful summer|On a distant shore
# There I see, reaching out her arms
# The lover who runs before me|As if possessed
Who is it?
Song and Simon.
- I'm up here.|- OK.
- Hot, isn't it?|- It is.
You want to sit here?
- I'm fine.|- Be careful.
- Hiya.|- Hello.
- Everything OK?|- Yes.
- You're OK?|- Yes.
Come here.|Do you want to eat your cake?
Yes.
Hello? Lorenzo?
It's Suzanne.
Hello... I've...
I've been looking...
I've been looking for|the tenancy agreement, but I can't find it.
Yes, but I can't find it.
Pierre has gone.
I don't know where he put it.|I've no idea...
No, I couldn't manage to.
No, I gave up|trying to join him there long ago.
I don't know|where he put the tenancy agreement.
Yes.
I can't find it.
I stuffed it away somewhere.|I don't know where he put it.
Marc says he doesn't have a copy.
I can't think where it might be.
I have nothing...
OK.
OK.
Yes?
OK.
Without the document,|there's nothing to be done?
OK.
Well, thanks anyway.
Bye.
Song?
- Song?|- Yes?
Can I ask you something?
I wonder if, next Tuesday...
Master Ah Zhong is giving|a glove-puppet demonstration.
I don't have a translator,|so do you think you could come?
My usual translator Yang|can't be there that day.
Sure. I don't usually|have classes on Tuesdays.
That's great.
So I can do it.|Roughly what time?
We'll go by train.|To Charleville-Méziéres, and then...
- I think it'll take the whole day.|- OK, I can do it.
I'll find someone to look after Simon.|He can probably stay with a friend.
Thanks.
You're having your snack?
- How was school today?|- All right.
He's the young scholar Zhang Yu.|I'll tell you what he says.
"How angrily|fate treats each of us differently.
"It's as if I'm engulfed in a dark cloud.
"My name is Zhang Yu.
"I lost both my parents when I was young,|and I'm an only child.
"I devoured the classics
"but never passed the imperial|examination for the civil service.
"Becoming a wanderer,
"I found refuge|in this Stone Buddha Temple.
"And tonight, I distract myself|by playing the guqin lute..."
When the characters first come on stage,|each speaks a poem.
It's a convention
which is repeated at every show.
They don't tend to improvise unless|the puppeteer is very experienced.
A mastercan afford|to change a few rhythms.
The sounds we hear at the start,
the percussions|that Master Ah Zhong utters...
It's fine today.
I'd like to...
offer him this postcard.
It's something I had|throughout my adolescence.
While I was at college|and doing my homework, all that.
For me...
it represents something|profoundly Chinese.
I'd like to give it to him
because I've had it for so many years.
He isn't playing|the guqin lute, but...
The card is old and worn.
But it means a lot to me.
Thank you.
I found it when I was|an au pair in London.
I went to the British Museum|every day.
- That's where I found it.|- All right.
You want to draw me?|- Yes.
You're ready?
- Shall I stand here?|- OK.
I can't see you.
Then you need a new sheet of paper.
There I can just see your shadow.
Maybe you can't see me clearly...
but you must be able to see my arms.
- Shall I keep my arms up?|- No.
Not like this?
We can't see a thing anymore.
We'll draw|a skull and crossbones.
We can start drawing the shapes|and then we'll refine it.
Hey.
Look at me.
Eggs first, is that right?
- I think so.|- OK.
- Two eggs?|- No... yes.
- Three.|- Three.
We're making egg pancakes.
So I should use three?|What do you think?
Another one.
Wouldn't two be enough?
OK.
- Does Suzanne make pancakes too?|- Not always.
- Always?|- Not always.
- And you like pancakes?|- Yes.
I hope they come out right.
- It requires strength.
Let me see.
Why don't you give it a rest?
Hello.
- Is Suzanne here?|- No.
We have an appointment.|Hello, Simon.
Hello.
I'm here to see your mother.|You know where she is?
- You're making pancakes.|- Yes. Actually I'm learning how.
I'm Song Fang.|Call me Song.
Lorenzo. I'm Lorenzo.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Simon's new childminder.
Where is your mother?
Dunno.
She's probably tied up|with her puppets.
OK, then I'd better help you|with the pancakes.
That's great.
Would you like some water|or something?
Sure, I'd like a glass of water.
- We can wait for her together.|- OK, I'll be back in a sec.
What are you shooting?
I'm filming... what she's doing.
How she makes the pancakes.
Nothing to film now.
Are you having one yourself?
- Would you like a pancake?|- Yes, I'll try one.
I put sugar in the mix already.
Already? Pancakes are great|when they're very, very sugary.
Not too hot?
Watch out, they're very hot.
- I'll take one.|- I'll get some plates.
What is she up to?
Who?
Suzanne.
Why are you meeting her?
To discuss Marc.|You know Marc?
- Yes.|- That's why I'm here.
Plates, great idea.|Thanks.
- Hot?|- Scalding.
Mmm!
- They're delicious.|- Really?
All to the good.
Gives me a reason to wait.
I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry.
I completely forgot you were coming.
OK, Simon?
Give me a kiss.
Better late than never.
Forgive me,|I'm doing a show at the moment.
And it's all... rather difficult.
- We've been tucking into pancakes.|- Great.
I made four.
It's hot.
Presents.
Father Christmas.
I chose one I know you like.
And that's for your head.
It will help me to think.
Mama, you seem rushed.
Yes, I'm always rushed.
That's better.
And what's this?
Mind the lamp.
What is it? Take a look.
And this is for you, Song.
- Take it, it's for you.|- OK, thanks.
Sorry, I'm really thirsty.
We need wine glasses.|Waiting has made me thirsty.
I'll get some.
Why are you so rushed, Mama?
Because I have|so many things to do.
You know,|I stopped by at the grocery store.
And then at the baker's.
I looked in on Richard...|There was no end to it.
So that everyone would be happy.
See, I wanted to show you|my bank statements.
See, here's the proof.
There, he paid.|This month, he paid.
That was at the start.|He paid every two or three months.
The third month there, not paid.
Not paid, not paid, paid...
- He paid at first and then stopped?|- He paid for about a year.
Since then, scot-free.
This is Marc the scriptwriter, right?|Aren't the two of you friends?
Yes, kind of friends,|but friendship can run out.
He's living there,|but Louise is due to come and stay.
- I'll show you.|- How long since he last paid?
How long since he last paid?
At least a year, and back in the first year,|he paid erratically, when he felt like it.
It's true that he's not that well off.|At least, that's what I thought.
Then I got a look|at his bank statements.
I looked at his bank statements|and I realized that he does have money.
When is your daughter|coming back to Paris?
She's due to study in Paris.
Now, where is it...?|Remember where it is?
- Amongst those things.|- What are you looking for?
- Here's the proof.|- What's this?
- The tenancy agreement.|- It's your lease?
It's actually a photocopy.|He has the original, better ask him for it.
It looks pretty rough.
It should be enough.|We were just told to put it in writing.
- You should have called me.|- I wanted to ask you about these, Song.
I have these reels.
I filmed my grandfather,|who was a puppeteer.
I borrowed the camera from friends.
It'd be great if you could copy them|onto a disc for me.
I'll ask about it at the school.
Here's another one.|What is this? 8mm?
Yes, I think so.
Anyhow, if you can do it,|that would be really great.
I'll ask.
It's my box of secrets.|The magic box.
I can race through this agreement.
Tell you what you can do if you like.
Sending him a registered letter|will be useless.
You could send in bailiffs.
Send him an order to pay
and then take control|of his bank account.
And then, if he's hasn't gone|within two months...
I have to give him|some time to move out.
It's true that I'd like|to do up the place a bit.
Especially downstairs.
Since Mother died, we haven't|redecorated at all. It needs a lick of paint.
I don't want to throw Marc out right away.|I have to give him time.
But he has to feel|under some pressure to go.
Louise is due back to study.
- Next month, in June.|- Listen, let's freeze his bank account.
And then two or three months later,|we can ask a judge to evict him.
But that would take time,|probably between eight and twelve months.
- And it wouldn't be cheap.|- That's too long.
Especially if your daughter stays there|when she decides to study in Paris.
Yes, yes, she's supposed to come.
Anyhow, he's bound to go|when he finds his account frozen.
You want to send in bailiffs?
- Shall I start proceedings?|- Yes, I think so.
Anyhow, it's an old piano.|So don't worry too much.
It's OK.|Good piano to learn on, though.
It's seen better days...|But it still sounds good.
Nice to learn|on a piano like this.
Shall I take that thing?
Yes, if you don't mind.|Put it down on the second landing.
We call it a roller.
Superman.
Anything I can do...
No, we'll be fine.|We've got it balanced.
All is in the balance.
Song. Wait a bit down there.
- Simon. Hey. Wait for a moment.|OK.
Which way round does it go?
The other way, please.|Move it to the right.
I'm hurting just looking at you.
Come on in, come on in.
Can you get it through?
Yes, it's tight but we'll manage.
- Wow!|- To be frank, it's a close-run thing.
Where would you like it, Madame?
Over there, I thought.
You think it will fit?
Yes, it'll fit.
Your eyes are like calculators.
That's what we're paid for.
I was going to get you drinks.|What? Fruit juice?
Just water for me, please.
If the piano had been any bigger,|we wouldn't have got it up the stairs.
It was hard enough as it was.
It was... I don't know...|a fruit juice for this gentleman.
Thank you, Madame.
So how much do I owe you?
- Wait, we'd better get it off the rollers.|- Let's do that.
- I'll slide it out.|- Go ahead.
- Thanks so much, you're very kind.|- Just doing our job.
You were saying|how much I owed you?
- It depends whether it's cash or a check.|- Cash.
Then we won't have|to charge you the V AT.
- Three hundred should do it.|- Three hundred?
I'll have to get it retuned,|because it's really...
Please share this between you.
Thank you very much.
OK then, thanks a lot.
Just doing our job.
But we could have chosen|an easier one.
You must have|accidents sometimes.
I have... twice.|I broke my shinbone once.
And then I fell off a roof in 1993.
I broke my cervicals C1 and C2,|the ones you use to turn your head.
Seven breaks here, eight here.
A year off work.
You had insurance cover?
I sure did.
But if I hadn't been doing this job,|my shattered vertebra would have moved.
Thanks to this work,|my lower back is well muscled.
The orthopedic surgeon told me
my shattered vertebra|would have cut the nerves
which control the arms and legs.
I could have been|tetraplegic or paraplegic.
But you take phone calls|while carrying things upstairs.
I can do anything.|It's true.
- I saw that thing in your ear.|- It's very practical.
But do you take calls|while you're on the stairs?
It happens.
So you take bookings wherever.
All I have to do is push one button,|the rest is automatic.
You have everything?
Thank you so much.
Many thanks, Madame,|good afternoon.
Nice to meet you, have a nice day.
Come on, come on.
Ta-da!
Surprise, surprise.
- You've tidied up.|- I completely forgot the piano stool.
Did you close the door?
What's that?
It's Song's camera.
So you play pinball these days?
Why have you moved|the piano up here?
It'll be easier this way.
You can have your lessons here.
It makes sense.
It will be more convenient.
But what's Anna going to do?
She'll come here.
How will she know to come here?
We'll call her|and tell her it's upstairs now.
What's with the guy in green|with the red balloon?
In front of the cafe?
That's what I was telling you about.
I want to make a short film|about red balloons.
This is what I was shooting today|with Simon.
The boy in green is just there|for safety's sake.
He's all in green
so that I can later...|what do you call it?
- Erase him?|- Yes, erase him on the computer.
- Incredible what you can do now.|- This way...
But why in green?
I think it's because green is a color|you can erase digitally.
I'm not that strong|on the technical stuff myself.
Anyhow, when it's done,|you should only see the red balloon.
- You like being in the film?|- Yes.
Will you show me?
Yes, when it's finished.
- I haven't yet done the...|- OK.
I meant to give you back Origins.
- Thanks so much.|- You're welcome.
It's a bit messy, isn't it?|Looks tidy to me.
I've done those transfers from 8mm.
- Those reels you gave me.|- I'm sorry to have...
Do you fancy that?
- Sorry to have bothered you with it.|- No, it was nothing.
- Would you like that?|- No, thanks.
I even learnt something from it.
- I should pay you something for it.|- No, I have some money left.
- No, look, I put you to all that trouble.|- It's true. I'll show you.
It's the kind of thing|I'll be doing professionally.
- So it's been good.|- I'd like you to take it.
I have money left over.
I've started totting up|this week's expenses, I'll show you.
There's money left over.
I'll leave it there because I think|I should definitely give you something.
Here, this week's expenses.
Oh, the receipts. Thanks.
- The cost of the transfers is there too.|- How much was it?
- Not that cheap, it cost 99 euros.|- Wait, I haven't given you enough money.
But you have.|For the other stuff...
Let's not discuss it any more.|You take this and we're square.
OK.
I have to leave for the studio now.|You and Simon, pick me up there.
I've booked a restaurant for us,|together with Master Ah Zhong.
Kiss kiss.
Have I forgotten anything?
Keys.
My notebook.
See you later.
- From now on, keep the door closed.|- All right.
- You want some juice?|- No.
Nothing at all?
I want to have a go on my PlayStation.
- I'm gonna have a go on my PlayStation.|- OK, do that.
Here we go.
Ladle.
I'll manage. I'll manage.
Here we go.
The 324th ladleful.
The 4622nd ladleful.
What is this|handsome young man doing
with that huge cooking pot|on the shore?
Can you not see that|I am mightily occupied?
Leave me.|I have much to do.
It is my intention to evaporate all this water.|Then I will find my beloved.
You believe by doing this|you can dry this huge expanse
in all its depth,|its vastness and its blueness?
I know,|I am merely a humble mortal.
But I don't need... But I need|my two arms and all my concentration.
So please be on your way, Great Lady,|I have no time to lose.
Your devotion|has touched me.
Your tenacity overwhelms me.
I will make this marriage possible.
Ah, yes.
And how?|By means of what miracle?
Furthermore, who are you?
I am...
How to say... I am...
I am no ordinary mortal.
Long ago I went to the mountains|to gather rare herbs.
I ate them, I ate so many of them
that I grew hair all over my body.
After that, I found|I couldn't bear raw meat.
My body became lighter and lighter.
And I was... how to say...
I was...
I was transfigured.
They call me Mao Nu.
The hairy woman.
How can you help me?
Here.|Take this golden coin.
Throw it in your cooking pot|with the sea water.
When you have boiled off|a liter of water,
the sea level will drop|by one thousand meters.
Boil off two liters
and the level will drop|by two thousand meters.
Boil the cooking pot dry
and you will see|the bottom of the ocean.
And when that happens,
the Dragon King will be forced to change|his mind and allow you two to be united.
How may I thank you,|Oh Great Immortal?
May grace be upon you.
Boil the vast ocean dry.
Simon, look.
What is it?
Just a moment.
Who's that?
That must be
my sister.
You recognize her?
She has the same hairstyle|she has now.
It's Louise. She was three|or four then. You weren't yet born.
So I couldn't really know,|I just guessed.
That must be grandpa.
It's your great-grandpa.|He was my grandpa.
"How are you,|my dear little Louise?
"It's so nice to see you.
"What do you have to tell me?"
"I don't know...|My name is Louise."
"I know that your name is Louise."
I can't hear anything.
Maybe I'm deaf?
I can't hear a thing.
No, it's because it's|an 8mm film. Song transferred it to video.
What's an 8mm film?
You know,|those little cameras.
Ah yes, the little ones.|- But there was no soundtrack.
How do you know|what she says?
I make it up.
Hello.
Yes, yes, it's me.
Where are you calling from?
And you didn't have your computer,|you couldn't answer my emails.
You turned off your mobile.|It wouldn't even record messages.
Of course, but that's the problem -|you never do these things deliberately.
You have to let me know."I'm leaving|Montreal, I'll call you when I get back."
Meanwhile weeks and weeks go by|without a word from you.
Anyhow, we found the tenancy agreement.|Actually Simon found it.
I've brought in a lawyer.
Obviously.
Not at first, but you know how long it is|since he paid any rent?
How long?
He's loaded. That's why my nerves|are in such a state.
It's not even a question of money.
He pretends to have money problems...
What?
I've seen his bank statements,|so I know better than you.
In any case, I need this apartment|as Louise is coming back.
I loaned it, you used it for your writing,|but you left two whole years ago.
It's time your buddy took a hike.|Sorry, but that's how it is.
The place needs fixing,|it's in a disgusting state.
It all needs repainting.
He doesn't even contribute|to the electricity bills.
Or the water bills.
I'm sick of it.|It's easy for you, you're not here.
I sit here like a fool, waiting for news.|You don't send me any money either.
I tell you, I'm sick of it. I'm on my own.|I need support, I need a man beside me.
There's no one beside me.
No. You never, never ring.
What about me? I'm a man.|Not a kid or a little girl.
How long have you been away writing|your little book? I tell you, I'm sick of it.
I'm a man. I'm a boy.
Louder, I can't hear you.
Here you go.
Hello?
Who? Yes.
Where are you?|Yes, where are you?
He's in Montreal.
I'm sick of it.|Sorry, you must excuse this.
Don't worry.
- Sorry, but it's an intolerable situation.|- What?
Tell him to come back.|I'm sick of it, I've put up with enough.
It's all shit.
Yes, I got my marks.
I got 20 out of 20 in math.
In mathematics.
Mind the step.|Here we go.
Wait for me.
How long has he been|practicing the piano?
I don't really know, I've only recently|begun looking after him.
Maybe a year|or a little more than that.
- That means he's motivated.|- I think he likes playing the piano.
- Careful, there's a step.|- You go first, I'll follow.
The staircase.
- Bonjour.|- Bonjour.
That's Simon saying "Hello" to you.
The pianist.
Maybe one day.|The piano's here.
Simon, this is William,|the piano tuner.
Can you tell me|what make of piano it is, please?
I'm not sure how to pronounce it.
- Hu... fe...|- Hupfeld?
I know.
Do you need anything?
I have everything I need, thanks.
- Is Suzanne here?|- No.
Would you like something to drink?
No thanks, you're very kind.
- What are you playing?|- It's a Game Boy.
Hello?
Suzanne's out.
Just a moment.|Simon, it's Louise.
Hello, Louise.
Yes. Yes.
I'm just playing a game on PlayStation.
On your Game Boy.
Huh?
Yes.
No.
Uh... no.
No.
Yes.
And what are you up to there?
More or less the same as me.
That's the piano.
Oh, I forgot to tell you,|we moved the piano.
Yes.
Yes.
Actually, he didn't want...
Mama, she...
I thought we were friends.|Is this any way to behave?
At a certain moment,|we stop being friends.
Have I ever complained about|Simon coming down for his...
Like you coming up to do your cooking|and everything else.
- You've become hateful.|- I've had enough of it.
I'll tell you something,|Pierre is never coming back.
Damn it.
You want to speak to Mama?
I can't believe this.
- It's Louise.|- Who is it?
Damn.|Hello?
Yes.|No, I'm OK.
I have a few little problems.|But it's OK.
How are you, my darling?
No, darling.|Why do you want to stay in Brussels?
How's your grandpa's|high blood pressure?
Listen, it's great that you're helping,|but you have to take care of yourself too.
You have your studies.
It's really a good thing|that you're taking care of him.
I'm proud of you, but you'll soon|have to apply to university.
Then you'll have other prospects,|and then... who knows?
We don't have to decide right now.
What else have you got to tell me?
You know I miss you|and I want to see you.
OK, let's speak again a bit later.
I'll have calmed down by then.
A big kiss... Bye-bye.
What's going on?
You know,|grown-ups are a bit complicated.
Come over here.
- Did you have a good day?|- Yes.
- What did you do at school?|- I worked, as usual.
What did you work at?
- Math.|- Math?
And spelling.
What did you learn?
Multiplication.
And...
Addition?
No, we've done that.
Subtraction?
No, we've done that too.
In writing, we learned to do|all the capital letters.
Which ones?
- All of them.|- Really?
Look at me.
- Are you OK?|- Yes.
- Like this, or this, or this?|- Which?
- This big or this big?|- Like that.
Great.
- Have you had your snack?|- Yes.
You found your way here all right?
Yes, someone came to guide me.
Song, you found him OK?
- Can you get it back in tune?|- Mm.
Will you play us something|when it's done?
Maybe, maybe not...|I don't know.
I know.
If there are bum notes,|it won't be the piano's fault anymore.
I'm sorry.|My situation is not easy.
Problems are common.
It should be sorted soon.|I hope so, anyway.
- How are you doing?|- Fine.
Here you go.|Shall I take these?
Are you hungry?
- Yeah.|- Hm?
A bit.
- I'm a bit thirsty.|- Thirsty?
We can buy something on the way.
- OK?|- Yes.
- What would you like?|- Dunno.
I'm thirsty.
Yes, I know,|I'll buy something soon.
Simon.
Simon.
What?
You're asleep?
With your... bear?
Are you OK like that?
Yes.
Have a little sleep.
Here we go.
Come closer.
Come on.
You can sit down.
Sit down here. On the floor.|You'll see better.
- Sit down on the floor.|- It's like it's been done with felt pens.
It's like it's been done|with felt pens, yes.
- Now, tell me what you see in this picture.|- A little girl.
A little girl,|but it could be a little boy,
because at that time,|boys dressed like that.
- Really?|Yes, that's why we came.
So what is this little boy|or girl doing?
Looking for something.
A red balloon... That's right.
Maybe he's aiming at it.
Yes, maybe he's going to aim to hit it.
- What do you see in the background?|- His parents.
They might be his parents.
- They could be ghosts.|- Or perhaps they're ghosts.
Does it seem like a happy picture|or a sad one?
A happy one.
- It's a bit happy and a bit sad.|I see. And why is that?
Because one part is dark|and there's sunlight in the other part.
That's right.
The child is in the sunlight.
Now, where do you think the painter was|when he painted this picture?
What does he see from his position?|Where do you think the painter was?
- Somewhere high up.|Yes, high up.
It's strange.|Can we see the tree trunks?
- No. Then what do we see?|- The treetops.
The treetops.
So we get the impression|that the whole scene
is viewed from high up.
- It's kind of high-angle shot.|- Or a low-angle shot?
Look again at the two people|in the background, standing there.
Don't we have the impression|that they're facing us?
Meanwhile, everything else in the picture|seems to be seen from above.
It is a high-angle shot.|Or from the side.
Maybe they're just|keeping an eye on the child.
So maybe they are|the child's parents.
And what do we see over there|in the corner?
A ball.|A red balloon.
Yes, that's right,|a red balloon.
- I saw a film about a red balloon.|Is that so?
Maybe the painting is called|The Red Balloon.
Maybe they're the boy's playmates.
Maybe they're the boy's friends.|Maybe they're grown-ups.
What about the red balloon?|What do you think he's doing with it?
- They're playing.|- Or maybe the other boys asked him:
"Shall we play?"|"Yes, I'll go and fetch a ball."
Yes, maybe. Maybe there are|children behind, is it what you mean?
Other children who we can't see.
Maybe they have scored a goal|and he was the goalkeeper
- and he failed to stop the ball.|Maybe.
No, that's true,|but it must be another game.
Maybe they're playing rugby|and they've thrown the ball somewhere.
What's the shape|of the red balloon?
It's round.
Yes, it's round.|It's not...
# Chin-chin
# In the blue of the evening
# Chin-chin
# Drinking Pomerol or Pommard
# Chinese cheers
# On the banks of the Loire
# Chin-chin
# That's where I lost hope
# Chin-chin
# Flavors I've forgotten
# The Spleen
# When I drink La Veuve fanée
# The impact
# It overwhelms my palate
# Chin-chin
# I clink glasses to your health
# Remember
# We who loved life
# Hot milk, cinnamon, clear water
# Now I drink every night
# And it's a nectar
# With a bitter taste
# Chin-chin
# The sky grows heavy
# Chin-chin
# I've drunk too much Saint-Amour
# Chagrin
# By bar-light
# Chin-chin
# To you, my red balloon
In homage to Albert Lamorisse
and based on his film Le Ballon Rouge.
