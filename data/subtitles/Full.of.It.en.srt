1
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,547
. We come on the sloop John B.

2
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,217
. My grandfather and me.

3
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:04,026
. Around Nassau town we did roam.

4
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,693
. Drinkin' all night.

5
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,569
. Got into a fight.

6
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,197
. Oh, yeah.

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,403
. Well, I feel so broke up.

8
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,378
. I wanna go home.

9
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,643
. So hoist up the John B's sail.

10
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,845
. Hoist up the John B's sail.

11
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,652
. See how the mainsail sets.

12
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,681
. Call for the captain ashore.

13
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,285
. Let me go home.

14
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,191
. Let me go home.

15
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,502
. I wanna go home.

16
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,299
. Yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,966
. Well, I feel so broke up.

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,201
. I wanna go home.

19
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,436
. De de.

20
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,835
. De de de.

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,643
. The first mate he got drunk.

22
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,310
. Fell in the captain's trunk.

23
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,047
. Doo doo doo doooo.

24
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:06,115
. The constable had to come and take him away.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,721
. Sheriff John Stone.

26
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,592
. Why don't you leave me alone?.

27
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,760
Yeah yeah.

28
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,794
. Well, I feel so broke up.

29
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,864
. I wanna go home.

30
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,773
Ha ha ha!

31
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,723
Hey, you're not nervous, are you?

32
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,952
A little.

33
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,086
Oh, Sam!

34
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:46,121
You're a kind, caring, responsible young man.

35
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,634
And I know that if you just be yourself...

36
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,966
Everyone's gonna end up loving you as much as we do.

37
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,199
And that is a whole heck of a lot!

38
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,866
Ohhhh!

39
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,042
Love you, buddy.

40
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:02,236
Mmmm!

41
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,080
I love you guys, too.

42
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,277
Thanks.

43
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,470
Yeah, man, short is the new tall!

44
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,736
Are you sure he's a senior?

45
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,594
Nice haircut.

46
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,926
Thanks. M-My mom cuts it.

47
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,703
You must be Sam Leonard!

48
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,900
Yes. - I'm Principal Hayes.

49
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,431
But if you prefer to call me Marcus...

50
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,376
that's perfectly all right with me.

51
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,878
Thanks. Thanks, Marcus.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,347
Come on, I'll walk you to your locker.

53
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,441
I just want you to know what a pleasure it is...

54
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,851
to have you joining our student body for your senior year.

55
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,219
I'm-well-I-I'm glad to be here too, sir.

56
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,817
Great! Really great!

57
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,486
Of course, your parents have already informed me...

58
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,189
that you're in the running for the Math Association scholarship.

59
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,754
That's quite an accomplishment.

60
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,663
Well-I-I haven't won anything yet but-

61
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,758
but thank you.

62
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,703
This is your locker. It's one of my favorites.

63
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:36,038
This... is your welcome package.

64
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,140
Go Possums!

65
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,306
Sam, you have a great first day!

66
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,641
Hey, Jack!

67
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,144
Those are fantastic new sneakers you have on.

68
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,836
What is that you were humming?

69
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,280
Oh, it-it was nothing.

70
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,546
No, I liked it, what was it?

71
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,484
Uh, Sloop John B by The Beach Boys.

72
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,511
Shhh! - Who?

73
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,115
Uh, they were pioneers of surf music back in the '60s.

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,218
Oh. Can you sing that song you were humming...

75
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,819
so I can see if I know it?

76
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,056
Well-well... all right.

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,227
Um...

78
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,204
. So hoist up the John B's sail.

79
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,833
. See how the mainsails set.

80
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,436
. Call for the captain ashoooore.

81
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,971
. Let me go home.

82
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,644
You know it? - No, no, keep going.

83
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,347
. I wanna go home.

84
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,754
. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

85
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,989
. De de de de de de.

86
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,324
. De de de.

87
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,254
They can't hear you, little man!

88
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,498
I... I don't know the rest.

89
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,835
You gotta toughen up, newbie.

90
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,647
And... I would have gone with...

91
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,087
something more like Surfin' USA...

92
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:32,091
or Little Deuce Coupe.

93
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,938
All right, let's hit the showers.

94
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,376
Hey, hold on. Who's uh... Sam Leonard?

95
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,346
I got your parents' note...

96
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,247
and wearing your bathing suit in the shower is fine.

97
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,117
Thank you, sir.

98
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,712
You need a note to get out of gym.

99
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,344
Uh... no.

100
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,786
Condoms.

101
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,223
Actually, I was... just looking for a little guidance.

102
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,852
What exactly does that have to do with me?

103
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,828
Aren't you a guidance counselor?

104
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,132
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Have a seat, buddy.

105
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,566
Don't drop anything.

106
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:03,840
"Why don't you tell me a little bit about your problem, name?"

107
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,475
Today was my first day here...

108
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,281
and-and I thought this school might be different...

109
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,845
but I'm already getting absolutely killed.

110
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,221
"Life isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. "

111
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,984
Oo, well... uh, right.

112
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,289
I start out being myself, you know?

113
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,027
I- I try being friendly and nice...

114
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,002
but... clearly I'm doing something wrong.

115
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,869
I believe it was Thomas Jefferson that once said...

116
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,671
"Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom. "

117
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,873
Come on, man! I need some real help here.

118
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,545
This is my senior year, you know.

119
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,078
I definitely can't do another year as the short, weird kid.

120
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,318
Look, what do you want, pal? You want tail, is that it?

121
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,227
No! I... I mean, yeah, someday, but...

122
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,199
It's not what I'm after. I just-I just want one last shot at being cool.

123
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:59,728
Yeah, and I want to live next to a Xanax factory, with no locks.

124
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,240
It's not gonna happen.

125
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,800
Listen, I know where you're coming from.

126
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,004
I was there once, OK?

127
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,876
Rough childhood, right?

128
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,508
Mommy drinks too much, daddy's in and out of jail, is that it?

129
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,711
My dad's a flight attendant for-

130
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,346
I'm sorry, your dad's a stewardess?

131
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,623
OK, I'm sorry.

132
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,094
All right, a-are you good at anything?

133
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,687
Are you good at video games, sports...

134
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,891
forging your parents' signatures...

135
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,491
I'm-I'm somewhat of a math whizz.

136
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,728
Mm. - At my last school...

137
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,761
my teacher used to call me his prince polynomials.

138
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,572
Don't ever say that out loud again, OK?

139
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,781
All right, hey, kid.

140
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,046
Kid?

141
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,386
You wanna know the truth? OK.

142
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,654
I'll tell you the truth.

143
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,163
The truth is, the truth sucks.

144
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:05,467
We live in a moral cesspool of lies.

145
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,904
I've tried to live my life honestly and look at me.

146
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,204
I'm a high school guidance counselor...

147
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,709
with a freakishly high tolerance...

148
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,939
for prescription pain medication.

149
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,345
You think this is my dream?

150
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,281
You think when I was a kid growing up I had posters...

151
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:19,648
on the wall of guidance counselors?

152
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:22,782
Look, if you wanna get anything out of life...

153
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,517
you gotta put some spin on the ball, OK?

154
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,822
You want-You want kids here to like you at school, you lie.

155
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,521
Lie about who you are...

156
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,496
where you're from, what you got.

157
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,465
They'll believe you because they're dumb, OK?

158
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,866
In fact, if you remember one thing...

159
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,995
from your 5 years of high school...

160
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,199
in our society winners always lie...

161
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,867
and liars always win.

162
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,913
And don't do drugs.

163
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,473
. Let me go home.

164
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,075
. Why don't you let me go home?.

165
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,950
. Hoist up the John B's sail.

166
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,818
. Hoist up the John B's-.

167
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:01,190
. Feel so broke up. -. Yeah-eah-eah!.

168
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,854
. I wanna go home.. Chug-A-chug.

169
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,090
Ha ha ha!

170
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,065
Hey, hey! What about our-

171
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,398
I'm sorry... But you should go now.

172
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,869
Thanks.

173
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,036
Dude, sweet as sugar syrup.

174
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,807
Uh, yeah, I know it's totally embarrassing having...

175
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,442
my parents drop me off...

176
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,886
while my, um... uh...

177
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,219
Porsche is in the shop.

178
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,020
You have a Porsche?

179
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah, she's getting all...

180
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,229
pimped out right now.

181
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,663
So, uh, just, you know...

182
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,599
keep it on... D.L.

183
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,143
Hey, um, idiot. - Oh, hey.

184
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,341
When you signed this picture yourself...

185
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,713
you misspelt Carmen.

186
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,012
Heh heh.

187
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,616
Yeah, man, who's Camren Electra?

188
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,983
Ah, come on- come on guys that-

189
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,254
that's not-that's not cool.

190
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,921
I mean, everybody-

191
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,657
everybody knows that she's...

192
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,686
dyslexic.

193
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,725
Trust me, I-I know...

194
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,260
sh-she's a friend from back in L.A.

195
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,829
Great girl.

196
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,534
You know, now that I think about it I'm...

197
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,907
pretty sure she is dyslexic.

198
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,639
Yeah, you know what? I think...

199
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,273
I remember reading something about that too.

200
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,749
Where-Where are you going? - Kyle?

201
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,776
I know...

202
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,751
Out of all the others...

203
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,384
I have chosen you.

204
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,451
Excuse me?

205
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,588
I didn't have time to do my homework...

206
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,064
so I have chosen you to give me the answers.

207
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,260
And, if I like your work...

208
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,464
we can have an arrangement where you give me the answers...

209
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,166
for the rest of the year.

210
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,276
I didn't do it either.

211
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,012
Yeah, you should probably- you should probably just...

212
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,241
choose someone else...

213
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,249
please...

214
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,080
because I...

215
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,176
I really suck at math.

216
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,619
Seriously, I'm-I'm like-

217
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,088
I'm like a preschooler.

218
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,425
All right, everyone...

219
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,862
let's have your homework.

220
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,428
Yes. Thank you, thank you.

221
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,865
Thank you.

222
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,305
Can you hand me your homework, please?

223
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,004
I don't have it.

224
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,315
Now, why would that be?

225
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,475
M- My dog ate it?

226
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,711
Ha ha ha.

227
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,387
Your dog ate it?

228
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,050
Uhh...

229
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,855
He has this fetish and he's constantly eating my homework.

230
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:55,493
I'm not sure that joining the no-homework club...

231
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,764
your first week here...

232
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:01,204
is the best way for you to get that math scholarship.

233
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,680
Any more forced singing?

234
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,648
Oh, hey.

235
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,123
I'm Annie.

236
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,821
Sam.

237
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,496
Good morning, readers. - Morning, Mrs. Moran.

238
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,328
Hey, Mrs. Moran.

239
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,918
Please don't tell me you're one of those guys...

240
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,887
who actually thinks he has a shot with his teacher.

241
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,849
Ahem. No. No, no, no, no, no.

242
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,884
Not one of those guys.

243
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,720
Because I actually do have a shot.

244
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,232
Really?

245
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,701
And why is that?

246
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,000
W- Well-

247
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,029
let's just say that...

248
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,172
if things ended up getting hot and heavy...

249
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,941
wouldn't be the first time.

250
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,108
At my last school my social studies teacher...

251
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,412
had like this huge crush on me...

252
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,147
like she was in love with me, like she wanted to marry me.

253
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,711
She ended up leaving her husband...

254
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,950
was forced to resign.

255
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,016
Because of that, now I know...

256
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,960
that Mrs. Moran will be into me as well.

257
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,920
Are you drunk?

258
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,365
All right, for our Othello project...

259
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,426
I'd like everyone to partner up with someone today...

260
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,800
so that you can all get started.

261
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,067
I hate group projects.

262
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,006
I always end up doing all of the work.

263
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,067
Huh. Tell me about it.

264
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,441
You wanna partner up?

265
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,040
Ha ha.

266
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,380
I guess it can't hurt to share a grade...

267
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,617
with a guy who's having a steamy affair...

268
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,454
with the teacher.

269
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,309
. I'm comin' over.

270
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,009
. See me down at the station.

271
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,779
. By the lane with my hands in my pocket.

272
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,810
. Jinglin' a wish coin.

273
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,446
. That I stole from a fountain.

274
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,219
. That was drowning all the cares in the world.

275
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,226
. When I get older.

276
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,626
. Climbin' up on the back porch fence.

277
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,153
. Just to see the dogs runnin'.

278
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,666
. With a ring and a question.

279
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,032
. And my shiverin' voice is singin'.

280
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,502
. Through a crack in the window.

281
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,869
. Na na na na na.

282
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:51,205
. I better go it alone.

283
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,337
. Na na na na na.

284
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,645
. I better go it alone.

285
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,674
. Na na na na na.

286
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,182
Hey.

287
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,883
So, you wanna go sit over there?

288
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,256
They totally humiliated you yesterday.

289
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,388
That table is the land of milk and honey.

290
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,023
It's the same in every school.

291
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,899
Always laughing, always cool and charming.

292
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,028
Always happy. I mean, who wouldn't want that?

293
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,164
Please, that's just what they want you to think.

294
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,730
Trust me, their lives suck...

295
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,037
just as bad as ours.

296
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,741
Hey, hey, hey. - What?

297
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,270
Who's that?

298
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,249
Vicki Sanders.

299
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,549
There you go, start dating her...

300
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,850
and you can sit there all you want.

301
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,523
Sam? - What?

302
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,362
You know I'm joking, right?

303
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,800
It's-It's perfect. Heh.

304
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,394
It's exactly what I gotta do.

305
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,633
No, she dates basketball players.

306
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,573
Specifically, Kyle Plunkett.

307
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,508
You'll get assassinated if you ask her out.

308
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,377
Or maybe... just... maybe...

309
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,937
She'll say yes and before you know it...

310
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,710
I'll be sitting over there, swapping "how do you dos"...

311
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,809
with the Bridgeport elite. - Ha.

312
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,475
I'm sorry, this seat's saved.

313
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,035
Ha ha ha.

314
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,240
But there wasn't even a chair here.

315
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,478
Oh. There is now.

316
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:40,576
Thank you.

317
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,009
Ha.

318
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,386
Look at this kid. Isn't he short?

319
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,618
Heh heh. - What a loser.

320
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,285
Where's the golf course?

321
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,296
Ha ha ha ha!

322
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,424
Shall we go shopping for engagement rings now?

323
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,333
Actually, if you must know...

324
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,530
it went just as I expected.

325
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,439
Wow. You set amazingly low goals for yourself.

326
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,806
I like it.

327
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,071
You can't just expect her to jump into my arms...

328
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,510
right in front of Kyle.

329
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,808
But there was something there?

330
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,610
Oh, yeah, definitely...

331
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,447
I mean, tch, we have major chemistry.

332
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,180
So, you've been here what, a day?

333
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,688
And already Mrs. Moran and Vicki Sanders...

334
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,021
are lusting after you.

335
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,459
Uh, well, you know...

336
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,826
they're, uh, different.

337
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,957
Really? How are they different?

338
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,202
Well, you s-you see...

339
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:35,263
V- Vicki is more of the, ahem...

340
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,003
dangerous stalker, sex in the bathroom...

341
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,203
Spanish soap opera type, and-

342
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,212
OK, stop. That's not possible.

343
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,077
I have Spanish with Vicki...

344
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,551
and she can't conjugate a verb to save her life.

345
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,746
Cut the crap. Look, I-I get it...

346
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,379
you're lying to-

347
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,482
to jazz up your otherwise miserable life.

348
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,459
But... hanging out with them...

349
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,327
really cannot be worth all this.

350
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,858
Some of you guys may've heard, um...

351
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,302
my, uh, my house got vandalized after our last loss...

352
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,533
Uh, again. Heh heh heh heh. - Ha ha ha!

353
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,871
Uh, so we're-

354
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,341
we're gonna be cutting practice a little short today...

355
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,310
so I can go buy a new garage door.

356
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,870
Ha ha ha ha ha.

357
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,046
Ha ha ha ha ha.

358
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,857
Ha ha ha. - Woo!

359
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,950
Ha!

360
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,393
Does he shave his legs?

361
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:36,265
Uhh, start with two lines of lay-up drills.

362
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,201
Hey. Who are you?

363
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,068
I'm, uh, Sam Leonard.

364
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,404
Wh-Who sent you? - Uh, n-no one.

365
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,704
I- I'm the student that transferred into your P.E. class...

366
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,711
and I was really hoping to be on the team.

367
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,178
Oh, yeah? We're last in our conference...

368
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,544
we're in the middle of a 4-game losing streak, right?

369
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,014
Oh, but-yeah, but it's not always...

370
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,607
about winning, right? It's-

371
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,744
Not in Bridgeport. Heh heh.

372
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,186
Come on, kid, I'm-

373
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,621
I don't even think we'll have a uniform that'd fit you.

374
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,318
I mean, the-the shorts are gonna go up to your nipples...

375
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,489
I was the star point guard at my... uh, last school.

376
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,224
Was that a boys' school?

377
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,732
Seriously, Coach...

378
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,929
I never, never miss a shot.

379
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,730
My bad.

380
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,873
. Pistol of fire, pistol of fire.

381
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,714
. Pistol of fire.

382
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,311
. Shattered the frame.

383
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,413
. Go hug your sister.

384
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,287
. Go love your sister.

385
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,451
. Go hug your sister.

386
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,053
. One and the same.

387
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,653
. Aaaow!.

388
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,756
. Come home 'fore that rooster crows.

389
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,529
Aaagh!

390
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,071
Well, I've got my basketball scholarship.

391
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,515
Awesome! - What's a scholarship?

392
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,781
Check this out. Not only does he play like a girl...

393
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,448
but he must be hung like one too.

394
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,252
Ha ha ha ha.

395
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,355
It-it-it-it's not small.

396
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,023
Oh, yeah, man. - Yeah, right.

397
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,794
Look, look...

398
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,960
if you just admitted you had a micro...

399
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,527
we would tease you a little and then let it go.

400
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,869
But when you lie to our faces it insults us...

401
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,465
and we have to make an issue out of it.

402
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,770
Ha ha ha.

403
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,641
So, just admit you're sporting a chapstick-

404
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,305
Ha ha ha! Chapstick! Ha ha!

405
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,042
And we'll let it go! - The-

406
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,312
The-The truth of the matter is...

407
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,477
I'm hung like a newborn.

408
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,713
Oh! Ha ha ha! - See!

409
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,314
Even he admits it. - Ha ha ha.

410
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,222
7 pounds, 18 inches.

411
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,562
The-The coach made me promise to keep it covered...

412
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,927
so I wouldn't hurt your self-esteem...

413
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:47,192
right before the next game.

414
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,665
Dude, that would-

415
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,634
that would really scare me.

416
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:53,536
What? You're not believing this dwarf?

417
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,614
Hey, guess who got 2 tickets to Homecoming.

418
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:13,146
Ah, you're joking, right?

419
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,582
Get in.

420
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,391
Will Vicki be picking you up...

421
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,403
or will you be escorting her on your bike?

422
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,201
Uhh, I'm not gonna ask Vicki.

423
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,437
Why, what happened? I thought you guys really had something.

424
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,568
That is just it.

425
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:36,547
I got a note in my-my locker, from Kyle...

426
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,811
basically warning me to stay away from her.

427
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,943
Well, that sounds really threatening.

428
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,113
He said that if I didn't stay away from her...

429
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,782
well, then he would douse me...

430
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,156
in some sort of common household cleanser...

431
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,219
pull me behind his truck...

432
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,165
and, uh, hook my nuts up to a car battery.

433
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,189
Ha. - Yeah.

434
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,225
I think he even wrote it in blood.

435
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,830
Who are you gonna ask, then?

436
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,467
. Well, I'm reading this poem and it's so profound.

437
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,238
. And I-I like its rhythm and I.

438
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,405
My mom's an artist. Avant-garde.

439
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,938
Her work's way out there.

440
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,177
Very famous, Jill Leonard, perhaps you heard of her?

441
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,742
...And I start to realize...

442
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,617
You wanna go to Homecoming?

443
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,713
. Lies, lies, lies, lies...

444
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,155
My name's Sam Leonard, and my dad's...

445
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,658
a pretty big rock star.

446
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,286
Isn't your dad a little old to be a rock star?

447
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,523
Uhh... Well, yeah-well it's not-

448
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,089
It's not really a-a current band.

449
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,122
Well, what band is it?

450
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,293
Poison.

451
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,769
Ha ha. - Poison?

452
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,272
That horrible hair metal band from the '80s?

453
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,003
Anyway, my dad's like making this huge comeback...

454
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,567
so if you're at all interested in maybe...

455
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,772
getting some backstage passes... -. Lies, lies, lies...

456
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,111
maybe you and I could talk about it at Homecoming.

457
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,276
. Lies, lies, lies, lies...

458
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,183
5, 6, 7, 8!

459
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,812
Got kicked out of my last school...

460
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,789
for sending the principal to the hospital.

461
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,793
And if this new one even looks at me funny...

462
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,060
he might be making a trip to the E.R. as well.

463
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,533
Awesome.

464
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:04,865
So, I was thinking, you know...

465
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,370
maybe you wanna go to Homecoming with me...

466
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,872
to watch me kick his ass!

467
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,034
. Lies, lies, lies, lies.

468
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,805
. Lies lies, lies lies.

469
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,711
. Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies, lies.

470
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,578
So, you find your big Homecoming date yet?

471
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,018
No. And I literally asked out every girl in school...

472
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,645
who doesn't take the short bus.

473
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,519
Well, I don't take the short bus.

474
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,219
Yeah, but, I'm only trying to ask out girls...

475
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,558
who I'm 99% sure will say no.

476
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:31,994
You're a full 100%.

477
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,225
Well, that was in the past.

478
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,359
Things change, people change.

479
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,727
All right.

480
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,069
Annie, do you wanna go to Homecoming with me?

481
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,836
No, I hate Homecoming.

482
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,536
Appreciate it.

483
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,377
Good evening?

484
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,508
How do you like your Brussels sprouts?

485
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,281
Oh, yes, hello! - Mmmm!

486
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,287
They're great.

487
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,583
Really?

488
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,681
I'd have 'em every meal if I could.

489
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,419
I appreciate you calling.

490
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,017
Well, thank you.

491
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,225
Sam, that was your math teacher...

492
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:08,630
Mr. Von Der Ahe.

493
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,635
He's worried you might be getting off on the wrong foot...

494
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,604
since you didn't do your first homework assignment.

495
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,037
Sam, is this true?

496
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,132
I can't believe that you'd jeopardize...

497
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,200
your chance at the scholarship like this.

498
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,075
No, no. I-I did my homework.

499
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:23,740
Oh, so you're saying the teacher's lying?

500
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,477
I did my homework but I told him I didn't.

501
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,712
So you're the one who's lying.

502
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,276
Yeah, I guess, in a way, but-

503
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,154
You know what they say about liars, don't you, Sam?

504
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,818
That-That their pants are on fire?

505
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:40,988
Oh, no, please don't.

506
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,296
Sam! Sam.

507
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,137
Uh-

508
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,777
Leonard family meeting will now come to order!

509
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,449
Hank Leonard. - Here.

510
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,117
Jill Leonard. - OK, we are clearly all here-

511
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,455
Jill Leonard.

512
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,085
Here.

513
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,254
Sam Leonard.

514
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,558
Are-Are you kidding? You know I'm here-

515
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,327
Sam Leonard. - OK.

516
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,564
You know what? Here.

517
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:19,831
You know the meeting rules...

518
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,668
nothing but the truth.

519
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,037
Now, why have you been lying?

520
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,634
You guys have no idea how hard it is out there.

521
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:27,269
I'm down in the trenches every day...

522
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,337
trying to make people actually like me.

523
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,713
A- A-And do you know how embarrassing it is...

524
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,980
having my entire family drop me off at school...

525
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,316
in that piece-of-crap car...

526
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,151
kissing and hugging you like some sort of baby?

527
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,315
Do you?

528
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,120
Well, Sam, w-what can we do to help?

529
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,649
Nothing!

530
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,062
Uh, look, Sam...

531
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,727
Baby, if you could just explain to us why you lied.

532
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,793
Because lying works.

533
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,929
People actually like me when I lie.

534
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,803
No, Sam, you have got to be yourself!

535
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,307
People will love you-

536
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,833
Oh, Dad, cut it, that's the biggest lie of all.

537
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,778
Being yourself works great if you're actually great...

538
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,338
but what if you're a massive loser like me?

539
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:05,747
OK, that is it!

540
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,149
No more lying, end of story!

541
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,813
No! Not end of story!

542
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,789
My life sucks and lying is the only thing that makes it better.

543
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,086
That's why I lied today...

544
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,592
and that's why I'm gonna lie tomorrow...

545
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,790
and that's why there's nothing anyone can do to stop me!

546
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,163
Oh!

547
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,867
Oh, that's great. That's really just great!

548
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,892
What are you-

549
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,121
Let go!

550
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,032
Just-Look, just gimme the-

551
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:52,354
. I've spent my whole life surrounded.

552
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:58,059
. And I've spent my whole life alone.

553
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,000
. I wonder why I never wonder why.

554
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,594
. The easiest things are so hard.

555
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,265
. Oh, something.

556
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,434
. Something for nothing.

557
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,377
. Oh, something.

558
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,539
. Something for nothing.

559
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,049
Good morning, Sam! How you doin', fella?

560
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:20,209
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

561
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,082
Well, I was just wondering how you're getting along.

562
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,088
You know what, Marcus?

563
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,022
I don't need you wondering about me anymore, OK?

564
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,423
I can wonder just fine myself, thank you.

565
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:29,824
Y- You all right, Sam?

566
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,795
Keep it up and find out.

567
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,533
Annie, there is something really wrong with me.

568
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,561
You just figured that out?

569
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,630
No, I'm serious.

570
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,232
Morning, readers. - Hey, Mrs. Moran.

571
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,708
I don't know what it is, OK?

572
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,644
All I know is that something really freaky is going on.

573
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,644
Hi, Samuel.

574
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,379
Oh, uh-hi...

575
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,412
Mrs. Moran.

576
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,723
Ahem.

577
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,057
All right, before we get started today...

578
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,289
I'd like to know who you're partnered up with...

579
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,660
for our Shakespeare project, so, uh, Kevin-

580
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,599
Uh, I'm with Paul.

581
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,158
Alexis? - Ashley.

582
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,533
Mm-hmm.

583
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,529
Samuel?

584
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,337
Oh, Annie.

585
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,713
Oh.

586
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,459
Right. In Shakespeare's Othello...

587
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:40,259
who can tell me what is the core irony of lago?

588
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,301
Annie.

589
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,138
The core irony of lago...

590
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,303
is that he's viewed by everyone in the play...

591
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,973
as a moral and trustworthy individual...

592
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:58,448
of the highest order.

593
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,951
But his true character is that of an immoral liar...

594
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,577
who manipulates everyone...

595
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,884
in the name of bettering his personal circumstances.

596
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,049
No! Wrong.

597
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,919
Samuel?

598
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,363
I- I-I don't know.

599
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,833
But I think some pretty bad stuff happens.

600
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,859
Ha ha ha.

601
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,970
That is exactly right.

602
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,407
The core irony of Shakespeare's Othello...

603
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:32,678
is, as Samuel so eloquently points out to us...

604
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,686
some pretty bad stuff does happen.

605
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,987
Thank you, Samuel.

606
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,888
What is this?

607
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,162
My homework.

608
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:52,760
It's five-sixteenths of your homework.

609
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,772
Look, Mr. Von Der Ahe, I swear...

610
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,502
I could do this stuff in my sleep.

611
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,874
In that case you'll have no difficulty...

612
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,505
in solving the problem on the board.

613
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,881
All right.

614
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,756
What?

615
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:30,305
First let's take the square of, I think, right here.

616
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,275
Addition it.

617
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,572
Over 2.

618
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,249
Do you have the answer, Sam?

619
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,720
It's unsolvable.

620
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,285
Can't be done.

621
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,591
Ha ha ha.

622
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,033
Hey, good workout, buddy, killer stuff.

623
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,508
Holy Jesus!

624
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,601
Is that thing real?

625
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,737
Dude, it's like a firehose!

626
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,646
Oh, no, no, it's thicker. It's like... bridge cable.

627
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:48,875
. Hoo hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo hoo.

628
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,944
. hoo hoo.

629
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,477
. Well, it's mine.

630
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,819
. And I'm happy.

631
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,825
. I can't help it it's just me.

632
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,087
. If you're wondering what happened.

633
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,389
. That's keepin' me laughin'.

634
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,090
. Just you look and you can see.

635
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,120
. It doesn't matter what they think.

636
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,826
. Doesn't matter what they say.

637
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,994
. Doesn't matter 'cause I'm happy now.

638
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,334
. If you think at any time that they listened to me.

639
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,736
. They'd see.

640
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,766
. I'm happy 'cause I'm me-e-e.

641
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,577
. I'm happy.

642
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,809
. I can't help it, it's just me.

643
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,375
. If you're wonderin' what happened that's keepin' me laughin'.

644
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,011
. Just look and you will see.

645
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,612
Annie.

646
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:30,951
Not even a passing glance at their table...

647
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:33,156
are you feeling OK?

648
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,164
Yes...

649
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,222
I...

650
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,756
am. - Oh.

651
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,027
I just hit puberty.

652
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,833
Overnight? - N-Yes!

653
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,533
You've gotta check it out, it's the most beautiful thing...

654
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,870
I've ever seen.

655
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,273
I even had to adjust it.

656
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,542
I think you're gonna have to adjust your medication...

657
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,912
because it's obviously way too low.

658
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:54,042
I'm serious. I-I don't know what's going on...

659
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,746
but something really freaky is happening.

660
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,447
Hello.

661
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,384
How are you today, Sam?

662
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:07,761
Sam?

663
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,163
Uh-

664
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,189
Fine.

665
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,099
I was just wondering if you were...

666
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,125
Uh...

667
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,401
Hello.

668
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,339
Oh, I didn't even see you there.

669
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,036
So, I'm organizing Homecoming this year...

670
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,543
and I'm just trying to figure out who's coming.

671
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,671
I'd rather be flogged with wet bamboo.

672
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,210
Oh.

673
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,774
What about you, Sam?

674
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,516
Sam?

675
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,522
Uh-

676
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:32,853
I am so...

677
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,357
going to Homecoming.

678
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,689
Fantastic...

679
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,695
because I think this could be the best Homecoming ever.

680
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,857
I too think this could be the best Homecoming ever...

681
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:42,888
Vicki Sanders.

682
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,660
You've gotta be kidding me.

683
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,568
I mean...

684
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,596
Who knows what could happen there?

685
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,805
Well...

686
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,370
goodbye...

687
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,404
Sam.

688
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,582
I told you something was happening.

689
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,919
Ha ha, OK, that was a little weird.

690
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,447
It's been happening all day.

691
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,083
Almost cold-cocking Principal Hayes...

692
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:12,459
Mrs. Moran flirting with me... - Don't forget your...

693
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,431
Mm. So funny you should remember that.

694
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,957
You were so proud of it.

695
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:23,796
Oh, my God.

696
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,967
What? What's wrong?

697
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,738
All my lies are coming true.

698
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,211
You're about to fly off the planet, man.

699
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,306
No, no, seriously, think about it.

700
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,283
Each and every one of those things, I lied about.

701
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,612
The broken mirror.

702
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,520
OK, Sam, your lies are not magically...

703
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,457
coming true overnight.

704
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,325
It's just a big series of coincidences, OK?

705
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,421
I promise. - Jesus had his doubters too.

706
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,727
Wow, OK, um...

707
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,256
that's my cue, I gotta go.

708
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,826
Or maybe something magical...

709
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,838
clashes with your jaded, cynical view of the world.

710
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,499
Are you just saying all this...

711
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,474
to get out of writing the Othello paper?

712
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,635
No, I'm gonna do it.

713
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,202
OK, so, um...

714
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,578
let's meet in 2 hours in the library.

715
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,077
OK.

716
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,585
I'll see you at 6.

717
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,883
2 o'clock, Sam...

718
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,183
In the library.

719
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,520
Don't let me down.

720
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,657
Ahem. - Oh, hey.

721
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,326
Are you and that girl from lunch dating?

722
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,267
Uh-no, uh, no.

723
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,203
Good.

724
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,637
Ahem, look, I'm way hungry.

725
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,005
Do you wanna go get something to eat?

726
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,304
I- I'd like to...

727
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,243
Really, but-

728
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:37,076
I- I'm supposed to meet Annie some time soon...

729
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,945
in the... library...

730
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,075
to work on a project.

731
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,415
Well...

732
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,251
are you sure that you can't join me?

733
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,780
Um. - Hm?

734
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,816
No.

735
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,623
Good.

736
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,493
Let's go. Heh.

737
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,610
OK, I have like the ugliest nose...

738
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,174
in the world.

739
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,083
You're crazy, it's-it's beautiful.

740
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,179
Aww. That's sweet.

741
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,349
Look, I have to get going.

742
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,689
Have to meet Kyle.

743
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,855
But I'm having a party at my house this weekend.

744
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,329
Do you think you might be able to make it?

745
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,730
Yeah! I-

746
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,529
I- I mean...

747
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,092
Yeah, sounds-sounds phat.

748
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,535
Cool.

749
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:06,168
. Going to a party...

750
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,301
. Going to-.

751
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,099
What the-

752
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,373
Sally Berkeley.

753
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,885
Woman as landscape.

754
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,149
Heady, Jill, heady.

755
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,985
But this begs the question...

756
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,287
are the legs opening or closing...

757
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:29,451
on the female experience?

758
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,757
It's very third rate.

759
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,930
Aw, is this- is that a woman's-

760
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,469
Oh! Mom! Mom!

761
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:44,935
What's going on here?

762
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,340
Impromptu art jam, Sam.

763
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:50,108
I had to show some friends my latest work. Self Portrait In Pink!

764
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,548
Oh! Oh, God! OK.

765
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,211
Oh, God. All right.

766
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,982
Childhood trauma. Childhood trauma. Childhood trauma.

767
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,855
Don't mind us, sweetie. Just grab yourself a latte and a scone.

768
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,485
Childhood trauma. Childhood trauma.

769
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,591
Childhood trauma. Childhood trauma.

770
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,892
Oh! Oh!

771
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,202
OK. Childhood trauma. Childhood trauma. Childhood trauma.

772
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,707
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

773
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,834
More of my lies are coming true.

774
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,106
My mom paints female...

775
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,307
you know.

776
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,045
Female private parts now.

777
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,316
And why would you lie about that?

778
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,947
I didn't. I lied about her being...

779
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,821
an avant-garde artist and now our house...

780
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,054
is some sort of installation art piece.

781
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:39,763
Look, Annie, that's why I'm calling.

782
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,059
What other lies have I told?

783
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,565
Well, let's see. Here's one-

784
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,034
"I'll meet you in the library at two o'clock, Annie. "

785
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:47,865
I'm sorry.

786
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,835
But, uh, the guidance counselor...

787
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,640
called me in for like a really important meeting.

788
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,238
Sam, I've met the guidance counselor.

789
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:02,578
Oh, look, Annie, I'm super sorry I flaked on you.

790
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:07,150
Well, sorry doesn't write our paper by tomorrow.

791
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,954
It's not gonna be a problem. I'll do it.

792
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,894
All by myself, OK? I promise.

793
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,396
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

794
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,370
Get-Gimme-

795
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,970
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

796
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,080
Gimme that homework.

797
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,848
No!

798
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:49,058
Gimme the homework! Gimme!

799
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,100
Ugh!

800
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,949
Si, si. Ciao. - Mom?

801
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,717
A critic saw one of my pieces...

802
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,089
at the community center...

803
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,094
told his friends.

804
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,789
And when you get traction in the art world...

805
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,730
you've gotta leverage it.

806
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,131
I... guess.

807
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,466
Look, Mom, do you think you could help me with something?

808
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,835
Love to, but my agent wants me in Gstaad for an opening...

809
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,430
so, uh, perhaps when I get back.

810
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,942
Sure.

811
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:37,004
Uh, well, then, do you know if Dad's around?

812
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,311
I- I just really need to talk to somebody.

813
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,011
There's some pretty weird stuff going on.

814
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,214
Oh-

815
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,092
Oh, my God.

816
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,655
Dad, what are you wearing?

817
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,259
I just got in from my gig.

818
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,963
What gig?

819
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:04,031
Man, this comeback tour's way harder than I expected it to be.

820
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,905
Ah.

821
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,071
So you're in Poison.

822
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,477
Was in Poison, son. Was.

823
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:15,280
But, ah, this solo gig is gonna put me...

824
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,015
right back up on the top again. Whoo!

825
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,215
Ow.

826
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,121
God, you smell like Pabst Blue Ribbon.

827
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,457
That's a compliment coming from Vincent Van Beaver over there.

828
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,224
It's art, Hank.

829
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,662
Maybe to a gynecologist.

830
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,461
I have to get to the airport.

831
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,195
Are you sober enough to drive Sam to school?

832
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,465
I doubt it. He can drive himself.

833
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,528
What?

834
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,473
Yeah, I really gotta hit the rack.

835
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,273
Just try and keep her under 100, huh, Sambo?

836
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,775
Under 100?

837
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:48,807
Sambo?

838
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,179
Ugh!

839
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,122
Dad?

840
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,330
Mom?

841
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,571
. Well, I'm a weapon of mass destruction.

842
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:14,340
. Got no apologies for a hyper concussion...

843
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,369
I may not die a virgin after all.

844
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,984
. Take your love and turn it into obscenity.

845
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:34,292
. You say that I don't care about.

846
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,425
. All the little things that you care about.

847
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,594
. All the-.

848
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,534
. I don't care about.

849
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,510
. All the little things that make you wanna shout.

850
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,952
. Ah, me me me me, is all you say that I care about.

851
00:45:56,987 --> 00:46:00,684
. Me me me me, is all I ever wanna talk about.

852
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,717
. Me me me me, is what you think that I care about.

853
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,094
. Me me me me, is all I really wanna-.

854
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,672
That is a gorgeous car you have there, Sam.

855
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:23,980
. And all the kids on the street.

856
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:27,040
. They think I'm neat neat neat neat neat.

857
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,850
Did you finish the paper?

858
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:36,484
You've got to be kidding me.

859
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,688
Look, when it's your life you're messing up, that's fine...

860
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,321
but don't bring me down with you.

861
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,956
Look, I'm sorry, OK?

862
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,193
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

863
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,997
How? She's gonna give us an F on the paper, Sam.

864
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,371
Maybe not.

865
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,377
Hey. - Hey.

866
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,246
So, uh...

867
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,582
you're never gonna believe this, but...

868
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,985
my-my dog ate my paper.

869
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,956
And-and it-it's kinda hard to read...

870
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,979
but if you still want it-

871
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:09,754
I definitely still want it.

872
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,192
OK.

873
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,890
Looks like you have a very bad dog, Samuel.

874
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,296
Did you spank her like a naughty bitch?

875
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,323
Because she sounds like a naughty bitch.

876
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,535
We-We, uh-W- We discip-discipline her sometimes.

877
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:25,670
Oh. Well, it looks like you need to discipline her harder.

878
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:28,706
Wow.

879
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:31,043
OK? Well, uh-

880
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,140
OK. Thank you so much...

881
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,014
for being so cool about that.

882
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,145
I'm just gonna go back to my seat now.

883
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:42,221
I have a feeling we're gonna do great on this paper.

884
00:47:50,767 --> 00:48:00,375
Henderson sucks! Henderson sucks!

885
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,708
Defense. Defense, that's your man!

886
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,406
What is that?

887
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,255
Henderson sucks!

888
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,296
I got it!

889
00:48:15,331 --> 00:48:17,822
What? No, ref! - 15 green, halt.

890
00:48:17,867 --> 00:48:19,061
Come on! - That's 5, Coach.

891
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:20,500
Hey, hey, hey! - Come on!

892
00:48:20,536 --> 00:48:22,629
That's 5. You're done, son. - No!

893
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:23,661
What? What? What? - Hey, hey, hey, hey...

894
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:25,196
you gotta sit down. - No, ref!

895
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:27,004
That's 5 fouls, Kyle. He says you gotta sit.

896
00:48:27,043 --> 00:48:28,476
What?!

897
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,671
Coach, you need a replacement.

898
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:33,909
I don't got anybody else. They're all fouled out.

899
00:48:33,949 --> 00:48:35,712
What about the little guy over there?

900
00:48:39,055 --> 00:48:41,023
How about we play with 4? - 5 or you forfeit.

901
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:42,285
Fine.

902
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:46,886
Leonard, you're in.

903
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,362
What?

904
00:48:48,397 --> 00:48:50,058
You're in.

905
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,828
Ha...

906
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,510
I'm open, I'm open!

907
00:49:08,551 --> 00:49:10,178
I'm open!

908
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,719
I'm open!

909
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:16,254
What's going on?

910
00:49:22,064 --> 00:49:24,430
That's our basket, douchebag!

911
00:49:24,467 --> 00:49:26,332
Just stay the hell back here...

912
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:28,366
and try not to touch the ball.

913
00:49:29,038 --> 00:49:30,733
You suck!

914
00:49:32,908 --> 00:49:34,808
Come on!

915
00:49:35,311 --> 00:49:36,744
I got it, I got it.

916
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:59,861
Yeah! Yeah!

917
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:01,597
OK, let's run that play again.

918
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:13,711
. I wanna check into the paris Hilton.

919
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:15,876
. Trade inside like Mr. Milken.

920
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:18,079
. I scream in cherries, it's very necessary.

921
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,520
. To pick me some Halle berries.

922
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:22,854
. You better believe I want to try it.

923
00:50:22,892 --> 00:50:25,258
. To climb the mountains of Salma Hayek.

924
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:27,524
. Hotter than lava, Brazilian hot mama.

925
00:50:27,563 --> 00:50:31,090
. it's Adriana, it's Adriana Lima, oh!.

926
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:34,935
. Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!.

927
00:50:35,337 --> 00:50:36,504
Time, time, time! Get in here...

928
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:38,803
Get in here. Huddle up. Come here, come here, come here.

929
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:42,238
AII-All right, boys...

930
00:50:42,278 --> 00:50:43,745
what did I always tell you the possums' motto was?

931
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:45,974
When the going gets tough, we lay down and play dead?

932
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:47,778
Yeah, yeah. - O-Only tonight...

933
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:49,284
we stand a chance, so let's get out there...

934
00:50:49,318 --> 00:50:51,115
and try to win this thing right here, right now!

935
00:50:51,153 --> 00:50:54,145
76-74, so the only shot we can think about taking is a-

936
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,487
3- pointer. - Free throw!

937
00:50:55,524 --> 00:50:57,355
Free throw is one point.

938
00:50:57,393 --> 00:50:58,860
I know. - Leonard, look on the scoreboard.

939
00:50:58,894 --> 00:51:00,486
We're down by... what?

940
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:03,696
Uh, 13 and a half.

941
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:06,360
What? - S-Seven-eighths.

942
00:51:06,402 --> 00:51:07,596
But-but then you have to carry the one, so-

943
00:51:07,636 --> 00:51:09,536
We need a 3-pointer. - OK.

944
00:51:09,572 --> 00:51:10,766
What play shall we do, Coach?

945
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:13,902
What does it matter? You get the ball to Leonard...

946
00:51:13,943 --> 00:51:15,342
he can kick it in, for all I care.

947
00:51:15,377 --> 00:51:17,242
Anybody got a better idea than that?

948
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:19,804
No. - Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

949
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,680
Give it to me.

950
00:51:21,717 --> 00:51:25,209
possums! - Ohhhhhhh!

951
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:26,687
We really got this.

952
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:29,519
Nothing to worry about.

953
00:51:47,776 --> 00:51:56,213
. Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!.

954
00:51:56,252 --> 00:52:00,154
. Oh, oh, oh, oh!.

955
00:52:00,189 --> 00:52:02,589
. I'm on fire.

956
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:05,992
. Yeah, Mama, let's have some fun!.

957
00:52:06,028 --> 00:52:09,156
. Come on! Come on!.

958
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:13,697
Hello, BDI.

959
00:52:13,736 --> 00:52:15,829
I can prove it. - What?

960
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:17,862
That my lies are coming true.

961
00:52:19,408 --> 00:52:21,774
Sam? - Uh-Look out the window.

962
00:52:23,479 --> 00:52:25,743
. Along with fear.

963
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:29,478
. There goes the fear again.

964
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,516
. There goes the fear.

965
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:49,729
. And cars speed fast.

966
00:52:49,772 --> 00:52:51,933
. Out of here.

967
00:52:51,974 --> 00:52:55,273
Hey, where did you get this car?

968
00:52:55,311 --> 00:52:56,642
You wanna come to a party?

969
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:59,079
No, not really.

970
00:52:59,114 --> 00:53:02,641
There's a huge basketball keg party at Vicki Sanders' house.

971
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:05,119
Really? Kegs, basketball guys...

972
00:53:05,154 --> 00:53:07,850
and Vicki Sanders. Let's go.

973
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:11,257
How can you adequately mock this party if you're not there?

974
00:53:11,293 --> 00:53:13,727
Look, just think about how much more above it all you'll be...

975
00:53:13,762 --> 00:53:15,855
if you come.

976
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:33,945
Yo, Bridge Cable, you the man! Ha ha!

977
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:36,577
Since when are you friends with the supersize kids?

978
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,712
Ha. I kinda helped win the game today.

979
00:53:38,754 --> 00:53:42,087
Kinda? He single-handedly won the game!

980
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:48,424
And now every girI at schooI is asking about him.

981
00:53:48,464 --> 00:53:49,692
Ha ha.

982
00:53:49,732 --> 00:53:52,132
Really? - Yeah. Ha ha.

983
00:53:52,167 --> 00:53:53,634
Who-Who spe-Who specifically?

984
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:55,330
OK, everyone wants to know...

985
00:53:55,371 --> 00:53:57,498
who you're taking to Homecoming.

986
00:53:57,539 --> 00:53:59,439
Uh...

987
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:01,340
I- I don't-I don't know. I'm still, you know...

988
00:54:01,377 --> 00:54:03,845
weighing up my-ahem-options. Right?

989
00:54:06,315 --> 00:54:07,873
Let's dance!

990
00:54:12,788 --> 00:54:14,756
Whoo! -. The sun shone down.

991
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,884
. The world seems right.

992
00:54:17,926 --> 00:54:22,829
. During the day it feels like night.

993
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:25,231
. I'm shot down, I-.

994
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:28,361
Dude, your girI is totally freaking Bridge Cable.

995
00:54:28,404 --> 00:54:33,205
. You never know what you might find.

996
00:54:48,757 --> 00:54:50,987
Oh ho ho ho!

997
00:54:51,026 --> 00:54:53,290
Man, I've never seen Vicki dance like that before.

998
00:54:53,328 --> 00:54:56,058
I've never seen anyone dance like that before.

999
00:54:56,098 --> 00:54:57,725
Ha ha ha!

1000
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,024
. I'm shot down.

1001
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:03,163
. I'm gripping tight.

1002
00:55:03,205 --> 00:55:08,438
. You never know what you might find.

1003
00:55:14,516 --> 00:55:16,040
I'm sure it's nothing, though, dude.

1004
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:18,383
Whatever. The kid is still a loser.

1005
00:55:20,556 --> 00:55:22,751
Is that Carmen Electra?

1006
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:26,186
Hm. Is Sam Leonard here?

1007
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:40,299
Hey. I heard about your game on the radio...

1008
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:43,641
and I just had to come by and say congratulations.

1009
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:47,108
I baked you a cake.

1010
00:55:47,149 --> 00:55:48,980
Heh.

1011
00:55:57,326 --> 00:55:59,385
Oh, Sammy.

1012
00:56:00,596 --> 00:56:02,996
I am so proud of you.

1013
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:08,496
That's my boy!

1014
00:56:08,537 --> 00:56:10,095
Whoo-hoo!

1015
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:11,333
Yeah!

1016
00:56:13,308 --> 00:56:14,900
Oh.

1017
00:56:17,012 --> 00:56:18,536
Cake, anyone?

1018
00:56:28,757 --> 00:56:31,089
Kiss me, my love.

1019
00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:33,651
What? - Kiss me, my love.

1020
00:56:33,695 --> 00:56:36,459
Wait, wait, wait. Vicki, what about Kyle?

1021
00:56:36,498 --> 00:56:37,795
Oh, he's cooI with this.

1022
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:44,233
Look, just because she went into the bathroom...

1023
00:56:44,273 --> 00:56:48,175
with a really well-hung basketball star slash rock star...

1024
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,906
who drives a porsche and hangs out with smokin' hot mamas...

1025
00:56:50,946 --> 00:56:54,347
that doesn't mean anything's going on.

1026
00:56:54,383 --> 00:56:56,214
Yeah, maybe they're just chatting.

1027
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:01,785
Oh, Vicki Sanders' left boob.

1028
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:04,420
Unbelievable.

1029
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:06,617
Can I...?

1030
00:57:07,663 --> 00:57:09,426
Ohhh!

1031
00:57:10,098 --> 00:57:11,190
Thank you.

1032
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:13,895
OK. OK. OK.

1033
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:15,403
Enough of the kids' stuff.

1034
00:57:15,437 --> 00:57:17,837
I'm ready, Sam.

1035
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:19,204
OK.

1036
00:57:20,709 --> 00:57:22,472
For what? - To lose my virginity.

1037
00:57:22,511 --> 00:57:23,535
Wh-What? To-To me?

1038
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:24,671
To you! - Now?

1039
00:57:24,713 --> 00:57:26,146
Now.

1040
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:28,081
Vicki, we're in a bathroom. Don't you want it to be speciaI?

1041
00:57:28,116 --> 00:57:29,913
Oh...

1042
00:57:29,952 --> 00:57:32,614
that's what you're supposed to say.

1043
00:57:36,024 --> 00:57:38,049
It's a belt. - Shh!

1044
00:57:38,093 --> 00:57:39,355
No, I think it-

1045
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:45,793
Oh... my... God!

1046
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:49,496
Make love to me!

1047
00:57:49,538 --> 00:57:51,597
Huh? Grrr!

1048
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,834
Yaaaargh!

1049
00:57:55,577 --> 00:57:57,977
It's not what you think. - Yes, it is.

1050
00:57:58,013 --> 00:57:59,412
Grrr!

1051
00:58:01,683 --> 00:58:04,413
Grr! Grrrr!

1052
00:58:04,453 --> 00:58:05,784
please don't kill me!

1053
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:08,579
Grrr!

1054
00:58:08,624 --> 00:58:10,251
Sam!

1055
00:58:10,292 --> 00:58:12,590
Agh! Agh!

1056
00:58:12,628 --> 00:58:14,596
Oh!

1057
00:58:14,963 --> 00:58:17,955
Go, Sam! Go!

1058
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:21,736
Go!

1059
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,982
. Ah, me me me me, is all you think that I care about.

1060
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:48,258
. Me me me me, is all I ever wanna talk-.

1061
00:58:49,564 --> 00:58:51,191
Nice car!

1062
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:54,361
You are my lover.

1063
00:58:54,403 --> 00:58:56,030
You're my boyfriend now.

1064
00:58:56,071 --> 00:58:58,539
I'm over Kyle, I love you now.

1065
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:02,476
Are they going out now, or something?

1066
00:59:02,511 --> 00:59:04,638
Hey, Sam! Hey!

1067
00:59:05,047 --> 00:59:07,174
Hi, Sam.

1068
00:59:07,215 --> 00:59:09,240
Bridge Cable!

1069
00:59:09,284 --> 00:59:12,082
Sam, can I talk to you?

1070
00:59:13,822 --> 00:59:15,756
This-This'll just take a minute.

1071
00:59:15,791 --> 00:59:17,224
OK.

1072
00:59:21,196 --> 00:59:23,858
So, uh, what's up?

1073
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:27,829
Oh. Um... OK.

1074
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:30,667
Well, uh...

1075
00:59:30,706 --> 00:59:33,174
what I wanted to tell you is...

1076
00:59:34,543 --> 00:59:35,532
um...

1077
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:38,512
uh...

1078
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:41,778
I bought two tickets to Homecoming.

1079
00:59:41,817 --> 00:59:43,682
You? Homecoming? - Ha ha.

1080
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:46,347
Annie, thi-this is huge.

1081
00:59:46,388 --> 00:59:48,322
Wh-What-What made you change your mind?

1082
00:59:48,357 --> 00:59:50,757
You were so excited about it, so...

1083
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:54,990
I thought... what the hell?

1084
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,863
So, uh, who are you going with?

1085
00:59:58,867 --> 00:59:59,959
Uh...

1086
01:00:00,002 --> 01:00:01,264
Um...

1087
01:00:01,303 --> 01:00:03,294
You're not the only one that-that hasn't been...

1088
01:00:03,338 --> 01:00:05,329
completely honest here.

1089
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,342
Ha ha. I just-I just...

1090
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:12,574
think that-that what we have...

1091
01:00:12,614 --> 01:00:13,876
together is really cooI...

1092
01:00:13,915 --> 01:00:15,348
and I just thought...

1093
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:19,410
maybe we could explore it a little further.

1094
01:00:19,454 --> 01:00:21,012
Wow.

1095
01:00:22,491 --> 01:00:23,617
I- I don't-

1096
01:00:23,658 --> 01:00:24,852
I don't know what to say.

1097
01:00:25,994 --> 01:00:28,554
Oh, God, this is so high schooI.

1098
01:00:31,299 --> 01:00:32,891
Do you wanna go to Homecoming with me?

1099
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:40,705
Um... But I'm with-I'm with Vicki.

1100
01:00:40,742 --> 01:00:43,609
But... Vicki's a stupid ho.

1101
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:46,444
Yeah, OK, but...

1102
01:00:46,481 --> 01:00:49,348
you don't just leave the hottest, most popular girI in schooI...

1103
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:50,874
for-

1104
01:00:52,954 --> 01:00:55,013
For someone like me.

1105
01:00:56,825 --> 01:00:58,725
Annie, I-I didn't mean it like that...

1106
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,022
it was just-

1107
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:04,724
You are pathetic.

1108
01:01:07,903 --> 01:01:10,133
I got a call from a scout at State last night...

1109
01:01:10,172 --> 01:01:13,141
saying that I'm no longer on the recruiting list.

1110
01:01:13,175 --> 01:01:16,872
This kid stole my girlfriend, my point guard position...

1111
01:01:16,912 --> 01:01:19,107
and my future in one day.

1112
01:01:19,147 --> 01:01:21,741
He even stole my parking spot, for Christ's sakes!

1113
01:01:21,783 --> 01:01:24,479
That parking spot thing, man, that's totally uncalled for.

1114
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:26,248
This kid needs to pay!

1115
01:01:26,288 --> 01:01:27,550
Yeah. You know what?

1116
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:30,023
How about we dress him up as a cheerleader...

1117
01:01:30,058 --> 01:01:31,889
push him into a stall in the girls' bathroom...

1118
01:01:31,927 --> 01:01:33,121
and give him a swirlie?

1119
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:34,560
Oh, yeah. Ha ha!

1120
01:01:34,596 --> 01:01:36,257
Wait. Or, or we could, uh-

1121
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:37,458
smear peanut butter in his hair...

1122
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:39,091
Yeah. - shave off his eyebrows...

1123
01:01:39,134 --> 01:01:41,125
and then parade him round the cafeteria at lunch.

1124
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:42,431
That's awesome. - Ha ha ha!

1125
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:44,166
Or, or, or...

1126
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:45,468
how about we douse him...

1127
01:01:45,507 --> 01:01:48,169
in some sort of common household cleanser...

1128
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:49,768
pull him behind my truck...

1129
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:52,837
and hook his nuts up to my car battery?!

1130
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:05,050
I just wanted to have this little sit-down with you, Sam...

1131
01:02:05,093 --> 01:02:09,189
uh, because Mr. Von Der Ahe has informed me that...

1132
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:12,564
you haven't turned in any homework since you started.

1133
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:16,696
I have no choice but to...

1134
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:19,434
take you out of the running for the math scholarship.

1135
01:02:19,474 --> 01:02:24,673
It's also district policy that I put you on probation.

1136
01:02:24,713 --> 01:02:26,738
Which means, unfortunately...

1137
01:02:26,781 --> 01:02:28,772
that one more slip-up and...

1138
01:02:30,986 --> 01:02:32,544
I have to expeI you.

1139
01:02:35,357 --> 01:02:37,848
Are you sure there isn't anything you'd like to say?

1140
01:02:39,194 --> 01:02:40,923
Bite me, Marcus!

1141
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:50,369
I get two monkeys...

1142
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:56,209
Well, I get the coconut monkeys then.

1143
01:02:56,244 --> 01:02:57,506
Oh, fine!

1144
01:02:57,546 --> 01:02:59,514
Hank, I'm tired of fighting about the coconut monkeys.

1145
01:02:59,548 --> 01:03:02,517
Go ahead and take the coconut monkeys.

1146
01:03:02,551 --> 01:03:04,644
What's going on? What- What are you guys doing?

1147
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:06,551
Dividing up our stuff.

1148
01:03:06,588 --> 01:03:07,987
We're getting divorced.

1149
01:03:08,023 --> 01:03:09,923
Didn't you read the post-It Note we put on the fridge?

1150
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,619
The-the post-it?

1151
01:03:12,494 --> 01:03:13,859
What?

1152
01:03:13,895 --> 01:03:15,226
We've just grown apart.

1153
01:03:15,263 --> 01:03:17,561
I mean, I'm a rock star on his comeback...

1154
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,829
and she paints hoo-has.

1155
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:21,335
How could it ever work?

1156
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:22,461
Look, we'll talk more about this later...

1157
01:03:22,504 --> 01:03:23,801
but I'm supposed to be in prague.

1158
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:26,602
No, you-you can't leave, I-I need you guys.

1159
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:28,871
Aww, Sam, I know it may seem...

1160
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:31,538
like your world's coming to an end but it's not, OK?

1161
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:35,243
It's just adolescence. This too shall pass.

1162
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:38,081
No, Mom, it's about more than that.

1163
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:39,245
Look, I told all these lies...

1164
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:41,187
and-and now they've magically come true...

1165
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:43,657
Mmm! - and-and I can't get out of it.

1166
01:03:43,692 --> 01:03:46,525
He gets his creativity from my side of the family.

1167
01:03:46,561 --> 01:03:48,392
No, I'm-I'm telling the truth.

1168
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:49,863
I'm not Iying.

1169
01:03:51,066 --> 01:03:52,863
Da-Dad, I'm literally failing out of schooI.

1170
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:55,199
I'm not getting the M.A.A. Scholarship.

1171
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:56,568
Tommy Lee didn't go to college.

1172
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:58,539
Education is overrated.

1173
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,871
Go to the university of life!

1174
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:02,809
Bam!

1175
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:04,471
Gotta go. My cab's here.

1176
01:04:04,512 --> 01:04:06,503
Yeah, I'm late for my sound check.

1177
01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:13,687
Where's it-

1178
01:04:16,258 --> 01:04:18,658
Leonard family meeting!

1179
01:04:20,195 --> 01:04:22,857
Leonard family meeting!

1180
01:04:22,897 --> 01:04:25,388
Sam Leonard-here!

1181
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:28,231
Jill Leonard!

1182
01:04:30,939 --> 01:04:31,906
Hank Leonard.

1183
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,465
Sorry, son. My fans need me.

1184
01:04:35,877 --> 01:04:38,869
Ha ha! Whoo-hoo!

1185
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,177
Dad, come back! Dad, please!

1186
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,619
Dad!

1187
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:48,282
Ungh!

1188
01:05:31,499 --> 01:05:32,727
. Lie lie lie lie lie.

1189
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:34,200
. You lie lie lie lie lie.

1190
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:35,964
. Tell me why, tell me why.

1191
01:05:36,004 --> 01:05:37,733
. Why d'you have to lie?.

1192
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:40,798
. Should've realized that you should've told the truth.

1193
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:44,573
. Should've realized you know what I'll do.

1194
01:05:44,612 --> 01:05:50,073
. You're in suspension.

1195
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:53,986
. You're a liar.

1196
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:59,987
. Now I wanna know, now, now, now I wanna know.

1197
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:03,486
. Why you never look me in the face.

1198
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:06,591
. Broke a confidence just to please your ego.

1199
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:10,092
. Should've realized you know what I know.

1200
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:15,906
. You're in suspension.

1201
01:06:15,944 --> 01:06:18,674
Oh, my God, my nuts! -. You're a liar.

1202
01:06:23,084 --> 01:06:26,110
. I know where you go, everybody you know.

1203
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:28,987
. I know everything that you do or say.

1204
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:32,618
. So when you tell lies I'll always be in your way.

1205
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,651
. I'm nobody's fooI and I know all.

1206
01:06:34,696 --> 01:06:37,221
I loved your paper, SamueI. It read like a poem.

1207
01:06:37,265 --> 01:06:38,425
Thank you, Mrs. Moran.

1208
01:06:38,466 --> 01:06:39,694
Oh, it's not Mrs. Moran anymore.

1209
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:41,326
Mr. Moran and I have separated.

1210
01:06:41,436 --> 01:06:43,370
And I need... a man.

1211
01:06:43,405 --> 01:06:47,671
. You're in suspension.

1212
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:53,212
Oh, look, more children.

1213
01:06:53,248 --> 01:06:55,341
We'll just have to finish this tonight.

1214
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:56,543
What? We will?

1215
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:57,983
I'm chaperoning the Homecoming dance.

1216
01:06:58,019 --> 01:07:00,214
Don't be late.

1217
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:03,614
I love you! I love you, SamueI! I love you!

1218
01:07:04,959 --> 01:07:07,860
. You're a southern man, you're a northern souI.

1219
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:10,990
. You're a west-ender, you got an eastern souI.

1220
01:07:11,032 --> 01:07:15,298
. But you're no one at all.

1221
01:07:17,372 --> 01:07:20,500
. You're a rich man, you're a poor man.

1222
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:23,636
. You're this man, then you're that man.

1223
01:07:23,678 --> 01:07:28,138
. But you're no one at all.

1224
01:07:30,251 --> 01:07:33,186
. You're a liar, you're a winner.

1225
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:36,657
. An expert and a beginner.

1226
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:41,219
. But you're no one at all.

1227
01:07:42,931 --> 01:07:45,957
. When the wind blows that's when you know.

1228
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,128
. That your nose grows and your face shows.

1229
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:53,664
. That you're no one at all.

1230
01:08:08,356 --> 01:08:11,484
. You're a hard rock with your own space.

1231
01:08:11,526 --> 01:08:14,723
. You're a disgrace but you've got your grace.

1232
01:08:14,762 --> 01:08:18,163
. But you're no one at all.

1233
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:23,969
BDI, where the only thing colder than the ice cream...

1234
01:08:24,005 --> 01:08:26,701
is my attitude. This is Annie. How may I help ya?

1235
01:08:26,741 --> 01:08:28,572
Ooh, FYI...

1236
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,975
I'm pregnant.

1237
01:08:30,011 --> 01:08:31,410
What?

1238
01:08:49,364 --> 01:08:50,626
Don't you want a family?

1239
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:52,496
Yeah, yeah, yeah, someday, but-

1240
01:08:52,534 --> 01:08:55,526
Wait-It's not even possible, we never actually got to... you know.

1241
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,128
So let's start right now, then.

1242
01:08:57,171 --> 01:08:59,469
So you're not- So you're not pregnant.

1243
01:08:59,507 --> 01:09:01,975
Oh, God, I hope he has your eyes.

1244
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:03,409
Why did you-

1245
01:09:03,444 --> 01:09:05,036
Come on!

1246
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:09,549
Oh, my God, you're insane. I gotta get out of here.

1247
01:09:09,584 --> 01:09:11,051
Come on! Come on. - Ah!

1248
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:14,452
Haven't you always wanted to do it in a public toilet?

1249
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:17,351
Are you horny?

1250
01:09:17,926 --> 01:09:19,860
Let's make love!

1251
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:22,795
Come on, you're driving me crazy!

1252
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:32,738
And when were you gonna tell me about all this, huh?

1253
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,139
Mrs. Moran.

1254
01:09:34,175 --> 01:09:35,142
Hi.

1255
01:09:38,413 --> 01:09:40,313
No-no, wait. Mrs. Moran, wait!

1256
01:09:40,348 --> 01:09:41,975
Wait. Wait.

1257
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,814
Come on, it's time for the big announcement.

1258
01:09:50,258 --> 01:09:54,422
And this year's Bridgeport Homecoming king and queen...

1259
01:09:54,429 --> 01:09:56,454
are...

1260
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:06,739
Vicki Sanders and Sam Leonard!

1261
01:10:13,514 --> 01:10:18,679
. I don't remember what day it was.

1262
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:25,386
. I didn't notice what time it was.

1263
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:32,729
. AII I know is that I fell in love with you.

1264
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:36,203
. And if all my dreams come true.

1265
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:40,196
. I'll be spending time with you.

1266
01:10:40,241 --> 01:10:43,108
. Every day's a new day...

1267
01:10:43,144 --> 01:10:46,841
Just like to take this moment to congratulate our newly crowned...

1268
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:49,543
Homecoming king and queen!

1269
01:11:04,732 --> 01:11:06,723
And...

1270
01:11:06,768 --> 01:11:09,100
to our king...

1271
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:13,097
Whoo! Yeah!

1272
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:14,938
SamueI Leonard...

1273
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:19,376
I would just like to say...

1274
01:11:21,349 --> 01:11:22,714
that I am madly in love with you.

1275
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:26,185
Which is why it hurt so much...

1276
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,881
to find you trying to have sex with Vicki Sanders...

1277
01:11:27,922 --> 01:11:29,150
in the faculty restroom.

1278
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,054
What?

1279
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:31,615
Mrs. Moran, think about your career.

1280
01:11:31,659 --> 01:11:34,924
Oh, screw my career! What is my life without you, Sam?

1281
01:11:35,897 --> 01:11:37,728
probably pretty fine.

1282
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:42,259
And to our-ha, mmm-

1283
01:11:42,303 --> 01:11:44,271
our...

1284
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:51,743
filthy skank queen, Vicki Sanders...

1285
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:54,145
I would just like to say to you...

1286
01:11:57,685 --> 01:11:58,743
Ah!

1287
01:11:58,786 --> 01:12:01,220
You ball-breaking whore!

1288
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:03,916
Ah!

1289
01:12:07,528 --> 01:12:10,827
Are you sure there isn't something you need to be telling me?

1290
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:16,468
Actually, there is something...

1291
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:21,041
that I need to be telling you, Marcus.

1292
01:12:31,819 --> 01:12:33,719
Oh, no. Oh.

1293
01:12:33,755 --> 01:12:35,723
Mr. -I'm sorry, Mr. - pri-principaI Hayes.

1294
01:12:35,757 --> 01:12:37,190
. Sloop John B!.

1295
01:12:37,558 --> 01:12:38,889
. Sloop John B!.

1296
01:12:39,427 --> 01:12:40,451
. Sloop John B!.

1297
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:46,464
Mrs. Moran!

1298
01:12:46,501 --> 01:12:48,662
. We come on the sloop John B.

1299
01:12:48,703 --> 01:12:51,194
. Grandfather and me.

1300
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:55,107
. Around Nassau town we did roam.

1301
01:12:55,143 --> 01:12:58,010
Mrs. Moran! Mrs. Moran! -. Drinking all night.

1302
01:12:58,045 --> 01:13:00,775
. Got into a fight.

1303
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:02,180
. Well, I feeI so broke up-.

1304
01:13:02,216 --> 01:13:04,616
Oh!

1305
01:13:04,652 --> 01:13:06,813
Guys! Mrs. Moran!

1306
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:08,754
Guys! please, you don't understand.

1307
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:11,281
Take him to the parking lot! - No! No! No! No! No! Guys!

1308
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:15,056
. The constable had to come and take him away.

1309
01:13:15,096 --> 01:13:17,360
Oh, please. - What are you doing, Kyle?

1310
01:13:17,398 --> 01:13:18,888
Come on, man, this is crazy. What are you doing?

1311
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:20,400
What does it look like I'm doing?

1312
01:13:20,434 --> 01:13:22,994
I'm gonna pull him behind my truck!

1313
01:13:23,037 --> 01:13:25,403
Kyle, this is crazy!

1314
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:27,066
Kyle, look, look, we were just going to rough him up a little.

1315
01:13:27,108 --> 01:13:29,508
But you know what, I think you're taking these threats a little too literaI!

1316
01:13:29,544 --> 01:13:31,375
I'd like to second that.

1317
01:13:31,412 --> 01:13:34,108
Damn it! I've flooded it again!

1318
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:35,945
Kyle, relax! Kyle!

1319
01:13:35,983 --> 01:13:38,213
No! Move!

1320
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:39,810
Grrrr!

1321
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:42,414
Let's make you look good tonight, Chapstick!

1322
01:13:42,456 --> 01:13:44,390
Oh, thank you, Lord!

1323
01:13:44,425 --> 01:13:45,858
Kyle!

1324
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:49,056
You get to skip all the way to the car battery on your nuts!

1325
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:52,190
What? Wh-Kyle, please, can we just talk about this, buddy?

1326
01:13:52,233 --> 01:13:54,292
Kyle, you don't wanna do this.

1327
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:55,632
You're only doing this 'cause I lied...

1328
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,967
and said you wanted to do it.

1329
01:13:57,004 --> 01:14:00,804
Are you saying I'm your puppet? - No, no, no, no!

1330
01:14:00,842 --> 01:14:03,902
Kyle, buddy, I'm just saying- I'm just saying-

1331
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:05,344
You don't wanna do this!

1332
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:07,677
Oh, yes I do!

1333
01:14:07,715 --> 01:14:10,445
. This is the worst trip I've ever been on.

1334
01:14:10,484 --> 01:14:12,850
Kyle! Kyle! Think about your life.

1335
01:14:12,887 --> 01:14:14,149
Grrr!

1336
01:14:14,188 --> 01:14:15,246
You're gonna wear out your battery.

1337
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:16,779
Grrr!

1338
01:14:16,824 --> 01:14:18,792
Just go ahead and do it, my life can't get any worse.

1339
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:19,884
Grrr!

1340
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:24,258
Everybody freeze! You're all under arrest!

1341
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:26,766
. Let me go home I really wanna go home.

1342
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:28,268
Or-Or maybe it can.

1343
01:14:28,436 --> 01:14:32,522
. Oh! I feeI so broke up I wanna go home.

1344
01:14:32,557 --> 01:14:36,609
. I wanna go home.. I wanna go home.

1345
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:45,145
Hey there, gangster.

1346
01:14:46,787 --> 01:14:50,279
There goes my guidance counselor of the year award.

1347
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,284
Hey.

1348
01:14:54,328 --> 01:14:59,391
Listen, uh, I'm sorry about the advice I gave you the other day.

1349
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:02,163
Although everything I said is basically true.

1350
01:15:02,203 --> 01:15:04,296
Everyone does lie.

1351
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:06,135
But that doesn't make it right.

1352
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:09,199
And more importantly, I don't think it's gonna make you happy.

1353
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:13,304
In fact I think honesty and happiness go hand in hand.

1354
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:17,750
Though try telling my psycho ex-wife that.

1355
01:15:17,785 --> 01:15:20,219
Anyway...

1356
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:22,484
principaI Hayes has dropped all the charges...

1357
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:24,548
and I've talked him into giving you detention...

1358
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:27,584
for the rest of the year instead of expelling you.

1359
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:33,392
Th-Thank you. If-

1360
01:15:33,434 --> 01:15:35,834
If you could only get me out of all these lies.

1361
01:15:38,706 --> 01:15:41,334
I believe it was Thomas Jefferson who once said...

1362
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:44,606
"Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom. "

1363
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:49,743
OK. Wow. - Thank you!

1364
01:15:51,652 --> 01:15:53,711
Did I say something usefuI?

1365
01:15:56,023 --> 01:15:58,116
I'm leaving you. - What?

1366
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,957
Now, now, I realize you're like the most beautifuI girI ever...

1367
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:03,725
and I'm, um, me...

1368
01:16:03,764 --> 01:16:06,198
but, uh... we have nothing in common.

1369
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:08,531
And I don't even really like you.

1370
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:11,595
That's fine. We'll just have a sexuaI relationship, then.

1371
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:13,300
No commitment, no companionship...

1372
01:16:13,341 --> 01:16:16,674
just wild uninhibited sex whenever you wanna have it.

1373
01:16:16,711 --> 01:16:20,807
people do that? - I have no self-esteem, Sam.

1374
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:26,184
Girls like me never do. I will do whatever you want me to do.

1375
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:29,280
No! No, no, no. Vicki, OK?

1376
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:31,621
We're done. I'm sorry, this has gone way too far.

1377
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:33,718
Uh, it's over. Goodbye.

1378
01:16:38,265 --> 01:16:40,961
AII-star!

1379
01:16:41,002 --> 01:16:44,199
I gotta tell you. You have turned my whole life around.

1380
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:46,172
I haven't had a-I haven't had a death threat in a week.

1381
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,175
I gotta quit the team.

1382
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,836
The truth is, I'm not good at basketball.

1383
01:16:49,877 --> 01:16:52,437
Uh... sorry.

1384
01:17:05,559 --> 01:17:10,106
00:46
