1
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,827
Tie him up.

2
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,454
The hands are not the issue.

3
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,376
The fight is the issue.
The battle is the issue.

4
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:12,131
Who imposes the terms of the battle
will impose the terms of the peace.

5
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,591
You think he has a handicap? No.

6
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,887
The other guy has a handicap
if he cannot control himself.

7
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,724
You control yourself, you control him.

8
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,895
Take him to court.

9
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,900
A man distracted is a man defeated.

10
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,236
That's right.

11
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,823
You heard that before, huh?
Heard it again.

12
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,872
- Take him to court.
- Taking him to court.

13
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,418
Good. Cut him down. Fight's oÎ½er.
That's it.

14
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,713
Fight's over. Finish it here. It's over.

15
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,429
Okay. Improve the position.
Improve the position.

16
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:04,433
Keep the weight on his head.
What next?

17
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,312
Watch the slam. Keep your head up.

18
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,065
Nice. Nice. You felt that, huh?

19
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:16,236
Good. Keep your back.
Keep your back. Let's do it.

20
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,826
Okay. Okay. Improve.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

21
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,458
Good. Good, you felt that. Good.

22
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,754
Okay.

23
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,924
Improve the position.
Improve the position.

24
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,134
Good.

25
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,804
Take him to Brazil. Good, good.

26
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,558
Arm bar. See that? Excellent.

27
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:54,191
Triangle. Hold. Insist. Insist on it.

28
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,652
Insist on the move.

29
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,155
Good. Now what?

30
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,700
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

31
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,829
Good. Good hit.

32
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,875
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

33
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,710
Breathe. You know the escape.

34
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,547
You know the escape.
Breathe. Breathe.

35
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,841
There's always an escape.

36
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,721
You know the escape.
You know the escape. Breathe.

37
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,266
- There's always an escape.
- I'm passing out.

38
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,185
All right.

39
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:38,026
Great class.

40
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,115
Great. Hey, stick around.

41
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,829
You don't fight your way clear?

42
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,831
I was passing out.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,376
There is no situation
you cannot escape from.

44
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,336
You know the escape.

45
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,214
You know the escape. Show it to me.

46
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,342
Show it to me. Show me the escape.

47
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,719
Good!

48
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,222
Good. You know the escape.
You just got tired. What's the lesson?

49
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,933
- Don't get tired.
- Let the other guy get tired.

50
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,812
You wanna fight like a black belt, huh?

51
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,440
You wanna test for the black belt?

52
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,653
- Snowflake, give him his wish.
- All right. Raise your hands.

53
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,739
Well, your hands. Get them up, up.

54
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:27,701
Administer the fight.
Administer the fight.

55
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,538
Insist. Insist.

56
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,335
You told me this training
saved your life.

57
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,253
This is how you repay me?

58
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,465
Breathe through it. The moÎ½es work.

59
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,550
Defend the neck.

60
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,055
Take the fight out of your face.

61
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,223
Well, that's it. Officer down.

62
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,477
That makes you mad, huh?

63
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,687
Control your emotions.

64
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,775
Control your emotions. Breathe.

65
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,904
Breathe.

66
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,656
All right, all right. Okay, okay, okay.
That's it.

67
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,284
That's it. That's it.

68
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,248
Good.

69
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,169
Hit the showers.
Come back in. Good.

70
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,259
You okay?

71
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,305
- Yeah. He's good. He's good.
- Good.

72
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,817
Hi, I'm lost. I can't find
the fucking pharmacy.

73
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,693
What?

74
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,071
I don't know.

75
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,575
Well, you said I had to find it
before 8.

76
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,331
All right, thank you. Okay.

77
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:34,327
Hey, hey. Wait, wait!

78
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,538
Stop!

79
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,422
That's the one.

80
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,633
Hi. Hi, yeah, I missed the guy.

81
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,303
I'm gonna need your help
with some of those things.

82
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,016
No, a regular doctor's not gonna fill
the prescription.

83
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,268
What?

84
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,229
Because he's closed.

85
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:07,402
The prescription's not gonna stand up
at a straight pharmacy.

86
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,780
All right, but I need a-

87
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,202
All right. Okay.

88
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,718
Hello? Hi, this is Sondra Terry
with Southside Jiu-jitsu.

89
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,431
Yeah, I have
your inÎ½oice number 20903.

90
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,269
Yeah, you indicate you did not receive
our payment.

91
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,776
Okay, but on my record it shows that-

92
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,821
Look, I'm trying to run a business
just like you and-

93
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,159
Oh, wait.

94
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,166
As all the world knows,
tomorrow's Wednesday.

95
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,460
So be on Wednesday's schedule.

96
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,381
Nine a. m., Beginning Self Defense,
15, I'm washing the mats.

97
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,968
You're gonna have to train if you
want that black belt, Officer Joe.

98
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,636
Mike?

99
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,846
What, you want the officer
to walk you home?

100
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,765
It's rough out there.

101
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,934
After he gets his black belt
he can walk me.

102
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,770
- That would make me feel secure.
- How?

103
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,648
I know his fucking pants
aren't gonna fall down.

104
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,487
Hey, by the way,
weren't you gonna buy a new rig?

105
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,323
- I was thinking about it.
- Oh, you were thinking about it.

106
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,827
I tell you what. Why don't you take
some of that good off-duty money...

107
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,830
...and buy a new shoulder rig. Why?

108
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,208
A shoulder rig's
nothing but a handle.

109
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,669
Excuse me. Who's the-?

110
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,254
- It's all right. Come in.
- Hi.

111
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,505
- Mike?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,840
I belieÎ½e I-

113
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,550
- Can you come here?
- Take it easy.

114
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,343
Yes, thank you. I was driving-

115
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,345
Take off your coat.
How can we help you?

116
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,930
Look, I hurt your car, okay?

117
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,349
Hey, Joe, take the lady's coat.
Come on.

118
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,352
I'll pay you cash so we can just-
No! Stay away from me!

119
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,230
- Miss.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

120
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,656
I'm a police officer!

121
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,564
The wind blew something in
through the window.

122
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,067
- The wind blew something in?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,320
Yeah. Sure.

124
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,113
Y'all okay?

125
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,823
Yeah. We're fine.

126
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,117
You want me to start the cleanup?

127
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,536
Yeah, thanks, Snowflake.

128
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,082
What am I gonna say,
"She tried to kill a police officer"?

129
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,917
You sure?

130
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,252
I'm sure.

131
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:20,261
It's okay.

132
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:45,203
- I'm an attorney. I can't-
- The officer thinks it didn't happen.

133
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,831
I'm sorry, I don't...

134
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,291
He thinks it didn't happen.

135
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,318
You were going to the mountains.

136
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,903
No, that's funny.

137
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,530
Joe? Joe still inside?

138
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,157
- No. He just left.
- Left?

139
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,659
Yeah. Maybe he went to the club.

140
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,495
- What happened to the window?
- Isn't he on at the club?

141
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,748
That's funny.

142
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,208
Weren't you going to the mountains?

143
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,211
- Why would he go to the club?
- Isn't he working tonight?

144
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,424
The club? No, no, no. He hasn't
worked at the club in months.

145
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,677
Listen, I have to tell him something.

146
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,847
Okay? Tell him.

147
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,474
- Why?
- Why what?

148
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,184
Why hasn't he been working there?

149
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,187
Yeah, no. Listen, I gotta get home.

150
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,795
Officer Joe let the girl walk.

151
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,671
Yeah. I suppose he did.

152
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,007
That was generous of him.

153
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,843
Yeah, I think so.

154
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,429
Why did he do that?

155
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,265
He didn't wanna bring dishonor
on the academy.

156
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,685
- Yes, of course.
- I need a black belt for him.

157
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,064
He didn't want to bring dishonor
on the academy.

158
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,360
Yes. Thank you.

159
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,365
The car?

160
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,076
The girl drove into your car.

161
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,954
I didn't look at that.

162
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:54,415
They want cash to get the window
boarded up.

163
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,584
Do you have any cash?

164
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,128
And on your business...

165
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:03,633
...for which you have no cash,
we need to replace the window.

166
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,343
Your check bounced.

167
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,428
My check?

168
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,431
To the martial arts supply.

169
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,643
Mike, we're short.

170
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,895
You have no cash.

171
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,774
If we pay the window,
I can't make the rent.

172
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,153
Hello?

173
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,596
You need to ask Ricardo for a loan.

174
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,726
Mike. You go ask him for a loan.

175
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,498
Hey, Mike.

176
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,125
Hey, Billy.

177
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,878
Jimmy, you can't smoke in here.

178
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,590
- We got Mike Terry down here.
- Fucking world turning into a dungeon.

179
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,219
He's sorry. He's busy. Five minutes.

180
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,679
Ricardo said that?

181
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,224
Bruno. Ricardo's out.
Put the cigarette out.

182
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,398
- Fine. I'll take a beer.
- You ain't got no bouncer?

183
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,942
- Just weekends now.
- Officer Joe?

184
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,320
Billy. Billy, I'll roll you for this drink.

185
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,155
I hardly think so. Joey the cop?

186
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,407
- Yeah.
- Quit.

187
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,534
Come on. I'll roll you for this drink.

188
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,411
Here, you check out this die.

189
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,664
- So where you been, the cruise ships?
- He works the cruise ships.

190
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,125
- Why'd Joe quit?
- Yeah, hold on a second.

191
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,835
Check this out.

192
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,675
You ever seen that?

193
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,970
I'm fucking fantastic. Somebody buy
me this fucking drink.

194
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,597
- Officer Joe. Why'd he quit?
- What?

195
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,808
Why'd Joe quit?

196
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,103
Because Bruno wasn't paying him.
They never paid him.

197
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,980
They never paid him?

198
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,071
Coming from that Brazilian
jujitsu background...

199
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,783
...I spent time with Silva years ago
before he moved into MMA...

200
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,036
...and he'd showed me
his secret technique...

201
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,788
...his grandfather showed him.
we've been doing that...

202
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,124
...since I was 12
in high school wrestling...

203
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,793
We have a deal
or we don't have a deal?

204
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,255
He's gonna have his hands full
with Morisaki, but it's gonna be great.

205
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,966
I don't know why
everybody is not coming to this fight.

206
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,718
The main event for the IFA-

207
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,889
We got a deal. What good's a deal
if nobody's making any money?

208
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,474
Ricardo won't do it.

209
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,644
What, he's too pure? What, it's not
elegant? That elegant life he liÎ½es?

210
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,064
How long's that gonna last?
Answer me that.

211
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,857
Morisaki's gonna do it?

212
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,317
This bullshit?

213
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,779
Morisaki's a whore. He's gonna do
whatever the fuck I tell his people.

214
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,822
If he did this, he'll do anything.

215
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,118
"The gold and ivory-studded belt is
worth one-quarter of a million dollars.

216
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,497
It was presented to Taketa Morisaki
by the Emperor of Japan. "

217
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,956
Is he on the level?

218
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,585
The belt's a fucking nationaI treasure.
It's worth a quarter of a mil.

219
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,879
He's going to give it to Ricardo
if he loses?

220
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,673
It's publicity. It's publicity.

221
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,511
It's something to tell the papers.
It's a story.

222
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,305
"I am a samurai,
should this gaijin defeat me...

223
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,390
...I will surrender my fucking belt. "

224
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,850
And wilI he?

225
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,645
Look, we're not selling tickets.

226
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,647
Sell the tickets, sell the show...

227
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,316
...and we'll figure that out
on the way to the bank.

228
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,902
The point is
you've got to sell the show.

229
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,529
Ricardo's the biggest in Brazil.

230
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,281
Read the street signs,
we're in America.

231
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,368
Morisaki's doing his part,
you've gotta do yours.

232
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,245
Ricardo's gotta do his.

233
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,122
Where the fuck is he?

234
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,541
Pay-per-view is pulling back
on the promotion.

235
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,794
We need a gimmick.
One more time.

236
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,797
Ricardo brings the old man
up from Brazil.

237
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,051
He fights for the honor of his mentor.
Morisaki brings the belt.

238
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,179
He fights for the emperor.
What do you got? A grudge match.

239
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:04,267
It's back to the '30s,
black against white, Irish against Jew.

240
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,563
A racial grudge match.
Get me some velocity. Velocity.

241
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,731
Or else it's just two monkeys
in the ring.

242
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,240
We'll speak English here
in front of my friend.

243
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,992
Marty,
this is my brother-in-law.

244
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,244
Mike Terry.
Could I have a word with you?

245
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,958
I'm trying to do business, Mike.
What do you want?

246
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,751
I gotta talk to you about money.

247
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,086
- Money?
- Yeah.

248
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,422
You want money? Tell you what.

249
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,508
Fight on the undercard.
I'll put you on the undercard.

250
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,510
Round robin,
winner takes home 50 grand.

251
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,972
You got a good chance to take home
the money. Fight on the undercard.

252
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,932
Joe Collins, the cop.

253
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,060
- Joe Collins, the cop?
- Yeah. Your bouncer.

254
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,065
- He worked here several months-
- All right. All right, all right, I got it.

255
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,650
Did you ever pay him?

256
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,028
- Did I pay him?
- Yeah.

257
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,156
- What the fuck do you care?
- Did you pay him?

258
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,575
No, I heard you.
What business is it of yours?

259
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,951
The guy's got a family.

260
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,453
What the fuck are you saying?

261
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,289
This guy's got a family and I owe him
some money and what?

262
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,541
- Is this business of yours?
- Did you pay him?

263
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,502
I told him, as I recall,
he would have to wait for his money.

264
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,129
He got hot-headed and quit.

265
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,812
Yeah. This is Bruno Silva.
Put him on.

266
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,775
Chet Frank just walked into the bar
without his wife.

267
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,444
Without his bodyguard. No. No.

268
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,655
Get a news crew outside and-

269
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,240
Who did they get the tip from?

270
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,575
Some cabby driving by,
the fuck do I care?

271
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,661
Chet Frank just walked into my bar.

272
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,996
Would you call the newspapers?
Thank you.

273
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,166
Thank you for stopping by.
How's my sister?

274
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,464
- I'Il have a caipirinha.
- I'Il have another one too.

275
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,175
- I'Il take care of the lady's drink.
- How you doing?

276
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,512
- Everything's a fucking struggle.
- Take the high ground, huh, Chet?

277
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,389
- Yeah, right.
- The lady thanks you.

278
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,848
Anything for beauty.

279
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,017
Nobody's tough
when it comes to beauty, huh?

280
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,769
Indeed. Indeed. My pleasure.

281
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,439
Excuse me. I'd like to buy that.
She's a friend of mine.

282
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,899
I admire your taste.

283
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,901
What? I'm sorry, what did you say?

284
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,528
I said, I admire your taste.

285
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,030
I heard what you said.
I don't know what it means.

286
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,991
- All right.
- What does it mean?

287
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,868
Whatever you want it to mean.
I'Î½e had a tough day.

288
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,372
And what the fuck is that to me?
Fucking tough guy in the movies.

289
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,874
- Look-
- Where's your protection, tough guy?

290
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,293
I didn't know you knew her.

291
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,795
You insulted me, then you insulted
the young woman.

292
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:42,216
And don't you have a wife? Didn't I
actually read that you have a wife?

293
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,677
I didn't come to fight.
I came for a drink.

294
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,804
Well, maybe you came
to the wrong place.

295
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,472
You know what? Just calm down.

296
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,808
I'm calm. You fucking calm down.

297
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,562
- I have some ideas.
- No, I don't think you do.

298
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,314
Oh, I don't?

299
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,818
I just wanna have a drink.

300
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,658
How do you like that, man?
Come on!

301
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,493
Take that.

302
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,915
All right! Make a lane.

303
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:02,046
Hey, baby, you can hear me.
You can hear me.

304
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,134
- I'm all right.
- Ambulance?

305
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,970
He's got a guy or something?

306
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,931
I'm sure they made the call.

307
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,851
Hey, pal. Why'd you come out
alone, huh?

308
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,480
You looking for trouble?

309
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,821
He's okay. He's all right.

310
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,671
They banished the professor
down here, huh?

311
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,683
Here you go.

312
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,564
- I thought Joey was on the door.
- Nope.

313
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,357
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Lenny.

314
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,984
What the fuck happened?

315
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,237
I don't know. Some kind of bar fight.

316
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,825
Show it to me.

317
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,536
What are we talking about here?

318
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,038
Couple of bad boys
jumped on a movie star.

319
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,707
How about that?

320
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,293
Loomis has them
out at the ambulance.

321
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,087
What happened to them?
Did they fall down?

322
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,256
Something like that, I think.

323
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,469
Our friend here is all by himself.

324
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,972
Jesus Christ.

325
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,143
You got the tape.
I never threw a punch.

326
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,187
I'm a stone-cold victim.

327
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,814
What happened to the other guys?

328
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,483
How would I know?

329
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,194
What about you?

330
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,280
Nobody knows who I am.

331
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,405
You didn't get the loan.

332
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,950
Ricardo wasn't there.

333
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,118
Did you ask Bruno for it?

334
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,123
You didn't ask for it.

335
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,503
Are you afraid of money?

336
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,591
You tell me how we can run
your academy without money.

337
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:57,179
You tell me that so I can do it
and not disturb you in your purity.

338
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,474
How am I gonna run my business?
All the time you need me...

339
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,977
...alI the time,
all of my money's going to yours.

340
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,315
There are some things
I don't understand.

341
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,071
My father made money.
My brothers make money.

342
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,741
And you are somehow too pure.

343
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,995
You're too pure to compete.

344
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,663
- It-
- It weakens the fighter.

345
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,916
- That's right.
- Because a competition is not a fight.

346
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,835
That's correct.

347
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:32,131
And what about
the fighter's family, Mike?

348
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,177
What do they eat
while he's being so pure?

349
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,515
I have to take money
from my business...

350
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,434
...which is making money.

351
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:47,187
You replace the window,
you can't pay your rent.

352
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,524
The insurance
will replace the window.

353
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:54,695
You want to turn your friend in?
Your precious friend?

354
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,905
- Yeah.
- Your prize student?

355
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,159
The policeman?

356
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,704
The girl tried to kill him,
and he let her go.

357
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,497
The girl, he'd turned her in...

358
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,042
...the cops would have said
it was attempted murder.

359
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,251
And wasn't it?

360
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,046
- It was an accidental discharge.
- Was it?

361
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,716
She's disturbed, all right?
The girl was disturbed.

362
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,468
And now what? You're her doctor?

363
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,721
She walks into your academy,
you take responsibility for her crime?

364
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,182
They would prosecuted her.
She would go to jail.

365
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,226
It would haÎ½e ruined her life.
So, yes, he gave her a pass.

366
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,396
And you think it was noble.
The code of the warrior.

367
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,899
- You think it's noble.
- No. I think it's correct.

368
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,403
Well, that's fine. Except, as we report
the wind blew in the window...

369
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,199
...it was an act of God, and not
covered under our specific policy.

370
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,950
And so until we find the money...

371
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,745
...we have to live
with the window boarded up.

372
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,625
And you tell me how that brings
money into your business.

373
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,587
Hello.

374
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,091
Hi, Nikki. Yeah.

375
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,677
No, I can't order the new fabric now.

376
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,555
No, I can't.

377
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,100
I can't.

378
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,353
Of course I'm going to reorder.

379
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,608
Okay. Nikki, I'll see you
in 10 minutes. Okay?

380
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,819
Okay. Bye.

381
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,324
Now I have to fix the window.
Where I'm getting the cash...

382
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,953
...to buy the fabric for my business
without which we cannot eat?

383
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,081
One moment.

384
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,043
Where did you get that cut?

385
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,590
Thank you.

386
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,634
It's for you.

387
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,226
What is it?

388
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,811
It's an invitation.

389
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,314
- Who is it from?
- From Chet Frank.

390
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,774
- Chet Frank?
- Yeah.

391
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,277
We're invited to his house
for dinner tonight.

392
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,657
- To Chet Frank's house?
- That's right.

393
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,670
Really?

394
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,515
Where's Joe?

395
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,642
Mike, tell him,
what's the best weapon?

396
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,061
- Best weapon is a flashlight.
- Tell him why.

397
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,355
So you can look deep
in the other guy's eyes.

398
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,733
They had a dustup
at the Sao Paulo last night.

399
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,942
Is that right?

400
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,862
- Two ran into a Cuisinart.
- Can't believe everything.

401
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,282
Lenny and Loomis saw the tape.
Said it was better than Titanic.

402
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,409
We gonna ride,
or you still getting pretty?

403
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,703
- I'Il be right out.
- Wished I was there, Mike.

404
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,914
Yeah. I wish I was there too.
Hey, Mike.

405
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,541
You come down
because of that thing?

406
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,418
Thing? What thing?

407
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,045
I got something for you.

408
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,885
- No.
- Yeah.

409
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,348
- I don't deserve it.
- It's overdue.

410
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,143
Belt is just symbolic.

411
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,606
The belt, as Snowflake says,
is just to keep your pants up.

412
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,030
Thank you.

413
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,450
What thing?

414
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,744
- What?
- You said, am I here about the thing?

415
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,913
The thing with the girI
that never happened.

416
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

417
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,421
Open it later.

418
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,173
What is it?

419
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,926
Well, apparently, it's a wristwatch.

420
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,261
Yours? Whose is it?

421
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,597
It's yours. I set you up with a job
with my people...

422
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,599
...who apparently stiffed you.

423
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,601
Yeah. You went to the club.

424
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,186
Why didn't you tell me
they weren't paying?

425
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,771
You know, I...

426
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,400
Well, they paid you now.
That thing, take it and pawn it...

427
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,610
...and take your wife to the mountains.

428
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,739
What does the black belt mean?

429
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,117
That I represent the academy.

430
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,202
Then respect your teacher.

431
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,055
Hey. What's going on?

432
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,476
Who ordered this?
Who's paying for this?

433
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,994
Mr. Terry, I am heartily ashamed
of what I did. I'm so sorry.

434
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,496
I will, of course, make it well.
This is a check...

435
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,081
...for the damage to your car.

436
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,501
I would like to contact the officer
to thank him for what he did.

437
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,462
I don't know
what you're talking about.

438
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,381
Mr. Terry, I'm an attorney.
I know what the officer did.

439
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,760
Out of courtesy,
he refrained from actions...

440
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,055
...that might have sent me to jail
or to an institution.

441
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,973
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Richard.

442
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,809
Who do you like
in the Morisaki fight?

443
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,478
One of them's gonna win.

444
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,856
- Little word from a little bird?
- Yeah. I don't play that.

445
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,651
- If you did, who would you like?
- I can't help you.

446
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,694
You sure? You help me,
I'm gonna help you.

447
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,530
A word to the wise on this fight
is sufficient to put...

448
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,574
...money in your pocket.
Who does it hurt?

449
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,786
I can't help you, Richard.
You know as much as me.

450
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,704
I know as much as you.

451
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,089
Mr. Terry...

452
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,550
As you can see...

453
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,430
...I have a problem.
I have something of a problem.

454
00:32:56,057 --> 00:33:00,894
Is there some way
that I can help you?

455
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,407
You work with the police.

456
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,826
I'Î½e trained the police.

457
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,620
And what do all the belts mean?

458
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,623
The white belt is someone
who walks in off the street.

459
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,751
Black belt is someone the teacher
recognizes as fit to instruct.

460
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,338
In between we have blue, purple
and brown.

461
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,969
What do you have to do
to get a red belt?

462
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,804
There's only one.

463
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,891
All right. I'm not going to touch you.

464
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,605
But if you were to hold me,
could I strike you?

465
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,818
If you put your arms around me
and held me? Could I strike you?

466
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,529
With your knees.

467
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,366
If you turned your body slightly
and grasped me...

468
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,828
...could I strike you? From there?

469
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,122
- No.
- What?

470
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,707
No.

471
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,215
Could I strike you now?

472
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,301
No.

473
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,595
Where can I strike you?

474
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,696
Don't stand there.

475
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,036
An enrollment form.

476
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,500
Should you wish to continue
your instruction.

477
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,267
Yeah.

478
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,187
I'm looking at scene 87-C. I got it.

479
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,023
Well, enough is as good as a feast.

480
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,025
Let's take a walk. Come on.

481
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,237
Excuse me, but I have to ask you,
where did you get your dress?

482
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,615
- I made it.
- Oh, she made it.

483
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,075
Do you cook too?

484
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,578
- But where did you get the fabric?
- The fabric. I made that too.

485
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,788
You made that?

486
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,249
Yeah. Since I was a kid in Rio.

487
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,042
You made the fabric?

488
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,877
Yeah. I have a company in Brazil.

489
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,047
No. I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

490
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,217
Come and sit down. Lucy and I just
wrote a book about fabrics.

491
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,261
- Really?
- Yes.

492
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,347
We have a company. She has her
degree in it, in textiles.

493
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,516
I love this fabric.

494
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,185
I have some people,
my family's people, in Brazil...

495
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,812
...and they are the ones that-

496
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,272
- I love this fabric.
- Really?

497
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,440
- Yes.
- I would love, if you guys want...

498
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,235
...I can show you more.
I have tons of colors.

499
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,696
So, what is jujitsu?

500
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,699
You use one fighter's strength
against him?

501
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,909
Yes, in a way.

502
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:07,205
You let him use his strength
and you use your understanding.

503
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,416
So it's a form of wrestling.

504
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,001
Yeah.

505
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,503
Like we see in the mixed
martial arts competitions.

506
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,713
Yeah, that's right.

507
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,506
- You compete?
- No.

508
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,049
Because?

509
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,094
Competition is weakening.

510
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,555
Because it's fixed.

511
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,932
Two guys in a ring,
people betting money.

512
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,144
It may be fixed.
Any one fight may be fixed.

513
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:35,150
- But you train people to fight.
- No. I train people to prevail.

514
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:40,113
In the street, in the alley, in combat.

515
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,449
The bodyguard, the cop, the soldier.

516
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,118
There's one rule:
Put the other guy down.

517
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:50,957
You have to train in order to do that.
Any staged contest must have rules.

518
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,628
Everything has rules.
The problem is sticking to them.

519
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,300
Your wife. She's a beautifuI woman.

520
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,642
Yes, she is.

521
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,644
Booze. Women.

522
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,688
What in this life
doesn't get you in trouble?

523
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,816
Turn to the side.

524
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,319
Everything has a force.

525
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,155
Embrace it or deflect it.
Why oppose it?

526
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,245
How you doing? You healing up?

527
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,539
- I'm good.
- Well, you're young.

528
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,170
So there's the neckline,
the waistline...

529
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,798
- ... and the hemline. Right?
- Right.

530
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:44,844
So if you bring the hemline down
in this direction...

531
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,138
- ... it gives a better rhythm. Right?
- Yeah.

532
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:52,769
Yeah. And if your repeat
on the fabric is 1 foot, let's say.

533
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,688
Repeat of 1 foot? It's too costly.

534
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,691
That's what I'm saying.
Not from my people in Brazil.

535
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,858
You can get this fabric?

536
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,736
Absolutely. I make the fabric
and have it to you in a week.

537
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,405
- Zee.
- Yeah?

538
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,699
He's got to be on the set
in five hours.

539
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,743
Zena, let's let these nice people
go home.

540
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,370
Sure, honey.

541
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,882
- Thanks, pal.
- You're welcome.

542
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,052
Take care of that thing
for tomorrow morning.

543
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,595
You bet, Chet.

544
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,557
Movies. We get up early
in the morning like the military.

545
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,225
You in the military?

546
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,602
Yes, I was.

547
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,231
I'Î½e never seen Chet socialize
on a schooI night.

548
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,816
The guy saved his life.

549
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,069
- Zena?
- Oh, thank you.

550
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,238
Tomorrow.
I want to see you tomorrow.

551
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,574
Those are all my numbers
right there.

552
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,161
Mike.

553
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,831
- Mike, tell them the story.
- No. They want to go to bed.

554
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,833
Come on, baby. Tell them the story.

555
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,252
- The fighters before a fight.
- Three marbles.

556
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,464
Each fighter has a two-in-three odds
of choosing the white marble.

557
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,715
White marble's a pass.

558
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,176
White marble's a pass.
What if he picks the black?

559
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,262
- Black marble is a handicap.
- What does that mean, "a handicap"?

560
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,057
- You lose the use of an arm, or-
- Because?

561
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,100
You never know
when you may be disabled.

562
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,102
Thank you for a beautiful evening.

563
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,772
Thank you for having us
to your lovely home.

564
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,984
A fighter gets a handicap.
Do they do that in competitions?

565
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,028
- No.
- Well, they should.

566
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:29,115
A lot of money in that.
It'd be like a reality show.

567
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,284
Chet wants you to come down
to the set.

568
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,660
Can you do that?

569
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,622
Yeah. Okay.

570
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,217
Mike. Over here.

571
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,636
Yeah, well, hold up.

572
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,139
Chet's a little bit late.
He's a little bit late.

573
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,141
What do we need
to make you comfortable?

574
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,393
- Abby?
- Yes, Jerry?

575
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,521
Get him a script.
Put him in a trailer if he wants.

576
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:03,525
Chet's running late.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Abby. Abby.

577
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,778
Yeah, they want all the scenes
up in costumes on set right now.

578
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,659
WilI you pay attention?
WilI you pay attention?

579
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,578
Come on, what are you gonna do,
stab me with your purse?

580
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,664
Come on!

581
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,041
No, no, no. This is bullshit!

582
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,127
You gotta stab me
with the fucking thing.

583
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,796
- I'm trying, George.
- Well, try harder! Let's go!

584
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,425
Come on. Come on, stick me.

585
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,219
Come on. Come on.

586
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:36,683
You gotta make it real.

587
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,352
You listening to me
or am I talking to a fucking wall?

588
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,651
Make it look real.
You've gotta make it look real.

589
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,238
Chet ain't gonna look reaI
if you don't make it look real.

590
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,241
Anybody can do this fucking move.

591
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,368
- You.
- Me?

592
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,496
Yeah, you. I'm gonna show him
how to do the fucking move.

593
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,417
Come. Take the knife.
Ain't gonna hurt you. It's rubber.

594
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,464
Mike, what the fuck
are you doing here?

595
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,048
I don't know. Jerry Weiss.

596
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:12,302
- You coming on the show?
- No. He just got all wannabe.

597
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,054
- He ask if you were in the military?
- Yeah.

598
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:19,100
- You tell him what you did?
- No. He didn't ask.

599
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,395
You take the fucking knife.

600
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,898
He's Chet. I'm you.

601
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,859
You take the fucking knife and-

602
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:32,530
Well, what we have here
is a wise guy.

603
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,108
How the fuck are you?

604
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,528
I'm good. I don't wanna take up
any of your time.

605
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,446
No, they're shooting something else.

606
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,449
They're always something else
to shoot. Step in my office.

607
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,246
What are we shooting today?

608
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,751
"Meet me, 0-dark 30, AOC."

609
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,504
I never served.
I know I didn't miss anything.

610
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,422
But what are you gonna say?

611
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,009
But how would I know?
Fucking guy who lucked out.

612
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,136
- Here you go, Chet.
- Thanks, dolI.

613
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,766
Yeah, I'm just a fucking guy
who lucked out.

614
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,190
I drink too much.

615
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,611
I fool around. You know how hard it is
for a man to step out?

616
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,949
A famous man?
And who can you trust?

617
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,660
What were you doing in the bar?

618
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,664
- I went in to get a drink.
- Why didn't you bring your protection?

619
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,500
I wanted to get into a fight.

620
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,461
- Why didn't you fight him, then?
- I wanted a beating.

621
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,464
- What, are you a psychiatrist?
- No, I'm a fighter.

622
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,883
If that ain't strong enough,
you tell me.

623
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,136
Thanks, babe.
What are we shooting today?

624
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,388
Gulf War flashback.

625
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:25,059
That's right. It's not my department...

626
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,854
...but what are these numbers
doing on my boot?

627
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,857
If the guy had been in combat,
they'd be worn off.

628
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,859
The sizes would be worn off, right?

629
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,278
- It's not the sizes.
- No?

630
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,822
Guys in the desert, they'd...

631
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,908
...ink their number in the platoon
on their boots.

632
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,495
That way, if their legs got blown off
or their bodies got blown apart...

633
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,206
...somebody in their platoon
would know who it was.

634
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,511
"0-dark 30. AOC."

635
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,681
- What does AOC mean?
- "Ass on curb. "

636
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,642
"Ass on curb. "

637
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,604
That's good. Is that something
a guy would say?

638
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,399
He might. It's old army. World War I I.

639
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,778
Maybe the guy learned it from the guy.
It's good.

640
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,405
Yeah? Are you free tonight?

641
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,240
You, me and Jerry.

642
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,577
I wanna meet over at Fiori's
after we wrap.

643
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,915
I wanna make you a co-producer
on this film.

644
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,462
Yeah, hey. This is Mike Terry.

645
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,174
Yeah, George Koriani asked me
to send him some materials.

646
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,177
Yeah. I found it.
Do you want me to fax it to you?

647
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,637
Okay. I'm gonna fax it.

648
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,223
I'm gonna have dinner
with Jerry and Chet tonight.

649
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,434
Yeah, okay. Okay.

650
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,770
They wanna put it in the movie.

651
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,438
Put what in the movie?

652
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,275
It's Desert Storm.
It's a bunch of combat.

653
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,778
George is doing this.
George is doing the stunts.

654
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,239
- George is doing the stunts?
- Yeah.

655
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,952
Then why do they want you for?

656
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,287
They want me to be a producer.

657
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,998
What does that mean?

658
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,793
To begin with,
they wanna use my training idea.

659
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,129
Gulf War.
They're training for hand-to-hand.

660
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:20,633
The captain in the film, he's training
the guys using my training method.

661
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,514
Sondra Terry.

662
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,516
Lucy, hi.

663
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,768
Yes. Yes. I'll be right out.

664
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,355
Yeah, yeah, I'm bringing the sample.
Okay, bye.

665
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,317
- Sorry, babe. You were saying?
- They want me to be a producer.

666
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,738
I'm gonna head out to the set, and
then I'm gonna go to dinner with-

667
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,534
What?

668
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,287
Who's gonna take
the beginners class?

669
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,667
Baby. Let the wheel come around.

670
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,294
Just let it come around.

671
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,046
Sometimes you can just let
the wheel come around.

672
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,631
I can't just cancel the class.

673
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,175
What message does that send?

674
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,635
Baby, you made Joe a black belt.
Right?

675
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:08,723
And so he's qualified to uphold
the honor of the academy.

676
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,018
Let him teach the class.

677
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,813
Okay? Okay?

678
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,692
Let him teach the class.

679
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,571
Okay.

680
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,200
Let the wheel come around.

681
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:38,377
Good for you.

682
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,547
I gotta go.

683
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,675
See you later, okay?

684
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,181
They're gonna take me
in their company.

685
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,397
Yeah, this is Mike Terry.

686
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,442
Yeah, did you get the fax
I just sent you?

687
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,780
Okay, good. I'm gonna go through
the whole script here.

688
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,743
Yeah. It's all about authenticity.

689
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,638
Am I supposed to meditate?

690
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,643
No. Just sit for a moment.

691
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,774
All right.

692
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,821
I don't understand.

693
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,573
The first step is the hardest.

694
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,366
And what is the first step?

695
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,827
To leave the outside outside.

696
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,384
I think I've come to the wrong place.
I'm so sorry.

697
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:55,848
Conquer your fear,
and you'Il conquer your opponent.

698
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,267
Yes.

699
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,021
Mr. Terry...

700
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,774
...a man raped me.

701
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,195
He held a knife to my throat,
a man twice my size.

702
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,530
And then he raped me.

703
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,574
He held a knife to your throat?

704
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:18,204
Yes. Look, I appreciate
what you'Î½e done, it's just that...

705
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:22,541
...I don't think there's anything I could
learn here that would really-

706
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,002
There's no situation that you cannot
escape from.

707
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,215
There is no situation that you cannot
turn to your advantage.

708
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,384
A man was gonna cut my throat.

709
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,678
Like this?

710
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:38,099
Don't move. There's a knife there.
There's a knife there. Grab my arm.

711
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:41,394
Drag it toward me.
Toward me. Good.

712
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,438
Now, move to the right.
Move to the right and behind me.

713
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,733
Move to the right and behind me.
Good. Now stab me with the knife.

714
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,860
Good. Stab me with the knife.

715
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:53,906
Good. Stab me with the knife.
Stab me with the knife.

716
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,242
Let's hear it. Let it out.

717
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,161
Let it out. Let it out.

718
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,596
It's all right.

719
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:21,809
There's no one here but the fighters.

720
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,604
Yeah.

721
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,649
Yeah, yeah, this is Mike Terry.

722
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,193
Yeah, I'll put that stuff together
for you.

723
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,821
Yeah.

724
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,699
It is good. Yeah.

725
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,328
Yeah. No, I'm working
on the script now. Yeah.

726
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,539
Okay. No, thank you.

727
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,625
Hey, Joe. Thanks for coming in.

728
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:51,088
I want you take the evening class.
White belts.

729
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:56,469
Hip escape, escape the mount,
pass the guard, arm bar.

730
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,892
- What time you going on-shift?
- I've been suspended.

731
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,688
- The wristwatch was hot.
- The wristwatch?

732
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:11,984
The gold watch the guy gave you,
you gave me. I pawned it. It was hot.

733
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,152
It was hot?

734
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,945
- Two-dollar pistol.
- You pawned it?

735
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,323
I did. The pawnshop called it in.

736
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,783
The captain wants to know...

737
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,951
...what I'm doing
with a hot $20,000 watch.

738
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,370
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him...

739
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,956
I told him I gotta telI him tomorrow.

740
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,292
He suspended me.

741
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,506
Tell him where you got the watch?

742
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,674
I didn't wanna hurt the academy.

743
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,677
I couldn't tell him
you gave me a hot watch.

744
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,055
Well, no. Let me clean it up.
It's easy.

745
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,682
- It's easy.
- It's easy?

746
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,726
Yeah, these guys, these guys
I'm sure.

747
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,853
The guy gave me the watch.
He got stiffed.

748
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,106
It's easy. I'm sure he'd wanna know.

749
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,942
Take the class. Sweat it out.
Sweat it out.

750
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,736
It's okay, Joe. It's easy.

751
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,760
Sorry I'm late.

752
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:24,098
Chet might be shooting till dawn.
He wraps early, he'Il come down.

753
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,308
He sends his regrets.

754
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,602
Here's what he wanted to talk
to you about.

755
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,229
And you should get a lawyer...

756
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,523
...he wants to make
an arrangement with you.

757
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,277
He's got some big ideas,
some of them might even be mine.

758
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,321
Here's one of them.
This could be money.

759
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,825
Luccha, Luccha.
What would you like to drink? Pinot.

760
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,869
- No. I'm good.
- You don't drink?

761
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,454
- I used to.
- You don't anymore?

762
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,748
Jerry...

763
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,086
...there's a problem.
And I need you to help me work it out.

764
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,588
Of course.

765
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,591
It's difficult for me to say.

766
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,634
Best way I know? Spit it out.

767
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,554
Chet gave me a lavish gift.

768
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,472
- A lavish gift.
- All right.

769
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,225
There was a money issue
and I asked a friend to pawn it.

770
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:11,353
- Pawn it?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

771
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,898
- Chet sent you a wristwatch.
- Yeah.

772
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:17,776
And you pawned it.
Hey, look, look, he gave it to you.

773
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,403
It yours to do with as you want.

774
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,197
- Jerry, how you doing?
- Hey, Billy.

775
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,948
- How you doing.?
- You got a minute?

776
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,409
- I'Il catch up with you.
- I got something Chet would like.

777
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,619
I'll come right over.

778
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,746
- I was going to call you about it.
- Okay.

779
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,751
Somebody pawned the watch
Chet gave you.

780
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,628
And he was told
the watch was stolen.

781
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,463
- Stolen?
- Yeah.

782
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:41,634
Son of a bitch.
Some motherfucker sold...

783
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:45,721
Someone sold Chet Frank
a hot watch. Goddamn it.

784
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,473
I can't use a celI phone in here.

785
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,768
I'm gonna to use the phone.
I'm gonna clean this up right now.

786
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,360
But she gave me this number.

787
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,071
She. Mrs. Frank gave me this number.

788
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,574
I called the other number
and it's out of service.

789
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,577
It's out of service.

790
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,454
Thanks.

791
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,374
Their numbers are all out of service.

792
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,877
How come it's out of serÎ½ice
if they gave me yesterday?

793
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,921
- Who?
- Zena Frank.

794
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,673
I had a meeting with Jerry.

795
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,676
They've changed the number.

796
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,721
I'Î½e ordered $30,000 worth of fabric.

797
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:12,182
I placed an order to Brazil
for $30,000 worth of fabric.

798
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,351
Lucy Weiss, please.

799
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:18,355
She's on vacation.

800
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,318
She won't take my call.

801
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,819
I had a meeting with Jerry.

802
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,072
- What did you do to screw this up?
- You placed an order to BraziI.

803
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,824
What did you do?

804
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,659
You placed an order for $30,000.

805
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,952
- Yes.
- Why?

806
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,912
Zena told me it was a done deal.

807
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,081
They were gonna use my fabric
in their shop.

808
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,292
- Where did you get the credit?
- What?

809
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,754
- Where did you get $30,000 credit?
- I paid cash.

810
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,589
- What?
- I paid cash. Are you deaf?

811
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,758
Do you know what's happening
to my life?

812
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,509
Where did you get the cash?

813
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,054
I took out a personal loan
for two weeks.

814
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,806
I was gonna get the fabric. We-

815
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,434
I was gonna be part of their company.

816
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,396
You took out a personal loan
for $30,000 for two weeks?

817
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,358
- From whom?
- It was a done deal.

818
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,734
Now it's not a done deal.

819
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,903
I wasn't even gonna need it
for two weeks.

820
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,613
They told me
they would write me-

821
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,032
Who gave you the loan?
Who gave you the loan?

822
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,451
Richard gave me the loan.

823
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:19,792
You borrowed $30,000
from a loan shark?

824
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,587
Are you crazy?

825
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,472
She spent it.

826
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,350
She spent it.
She spent the 30 grand I gave her.

827
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,559
That's right.

828
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,062
She said she wanted the money
for two weeks.

829
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:44,191
She spent the-
What the fuck am I gonna do?

830
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,987
What can you give me?

831
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,865
How soon could you get it to me?

832
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,326
Richie, if you could carry me.

833
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,954
The money ain't mine, Mike.
The money ain't mine.

834
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,665
I gave it out on my word.
I owe that money to my guys.

835
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,000
You understand? It ain't mine.

836
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,586
Now, what do you own
that you could turn to cash?

837
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:08,257
What do you got
that you could liquidate, huh?

838
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,509
Something for you?

839
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,095
It is an Asian samurai
training technique...

840
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,930
...going back to the 17th century.

841
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:19,351
Every fighter in the tournament, each
match, each fighter will pick a marble.

842
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,271
Should he pick a white marble'
he'll be given a pass.

843
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,858
Should he pick a black marble'
he'll be given a handicap.

844
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:29,027
For the fighters on the undercard,
each one could get a handicap?

845
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:32,739
That's right. The samurai say
that this approximates-

846
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:34,700
What do you got that's worth money?

847
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,828
- where one can never tell
if they might become disabled.

848
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,455
So there you have the undercard.

849
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,874
In the main event
we have bad blood evidently...

850
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,084
...between Morisaki
and your brother Ricardo.

851
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,878
Morisaki feels he's been insulted.

852
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,797
That is correct. It is unfortunate,
but this competition...

853
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,884
...has turned into a grudge match
between my brother and Morisaki.

854
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:54,887
Under the laws
of intellectual property, the copyright...

855
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,182
...that is the possession of the idea
and alI profits...

856
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,142
...deriÎ½ed from its exploitation...

857
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,395
...belongs to Mr. Terry.
The three marbles-

858
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,063
You can't copyright an idea.

859
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,941
You can't, but you can copyright
its expression...

860
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,860
...which he has done, through use...

861
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:13,071
...through exploitation of his system,
in order to earn his liÎ½ing.

862
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,032
- It's a historical form.
- Which idea-

863
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,201
- It's a historical form.
- It's not.

864
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,827
- The Japanese-
- That's nonsense.

865
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,747
It was discovered in a training manual
in the 19th century.

866
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,583
You show it to me in one,
we'Il pack up and go home.

867
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,877
You show me where he
eÎ½er transcribed-

868
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,004
He has a document
of his training regime...

869
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,423
...that he's used for many years
in his academy.

870
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,926
So he says. And I'll give you that.

871
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,261
Who's seen this form
outside of his academy?

872
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:38,805
We can assume the Silvas
and your client had access.

873
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,642
- The presumption of access.
- You can assume whatever.

874
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:45,646
The courts will concur the relationship
between the parties being so close-

875
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,607
Is that your case? Is that
what you wanna roll the dice on?

876
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,567
You sure you wanna play
in this league?

877
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:54,446
What do they want?
Let's financialize the problem.

878
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,576
No. Not. Please ask him to wait.

879
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,455
However...

880
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:07,292
...my client's prepared
to relinquish today.

881
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,836
To relinquish all rights to his creation.

882
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,463
In return for what?

883
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:15,133
In return for a payment of $200,000.
Payable today.

884
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,177
- That's a lot.
- It's a great idea.

885
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,762
- It's a good idea.
- It's great.

886
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,806
Or why would you be promoting it?

887
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:28,063
No, ask him to wait. He's gotta wait.

888
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,816
Your name could be here.

889
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,278
You wanna make some money?

890
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,905
Fight on the undercard, $50,000.

891
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,033
I saw you fight.
You've got a month to train.

892
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,995
You wanna make some money?
Give me a call.

893
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,830
I'll make you some money.

894
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,498
Thank you. That's very generous.

895
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,459
Today we need a cash payment
of $200,000.

896
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,128
You know, I don't think so.

897
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:55,257
- Mr. Brown, I tried to stop him.
- It's okay. It's your new partner.

898
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,929
It's Jerry Weiss, the producer.

899
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,181
I faxed him a copy
of the training sheet.

900
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,399
It's conspiracy. You gave the one guy
the information...

901
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:15,068
...who gave it to the other guy,
who denied it...

902
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:18,947
...as A, it's theft,
B, it's conspiracy to defraud.

903
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:22,409
You wanna get cute, you threaten
with criminal prosecution under RICO.

904
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,619
I'm glad I caught you.

905
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,912
I think you're about to become
a wealthy man.

906
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,914
Blew your case back there,
didn't you?

907
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,541
If I could just have one moment.

908
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,044
I will need some time
to formulate our new demands.

909
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,338
Of course.
But I wanna show you something.

910
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,215
Joseph Collins. Los Angeles Police.

911
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:40,552
On the night of June 12th, you stole
his weapon and fired on him.

912
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,221
Here's the ejected shell
from his pistoI.

913
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,599
It has your fingerprints on it.

914
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,893
Officer Collins did not file a report.

915
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,520
He is also prosecutable,
we'Il see to it that he is.

916
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:51,938
Prosecuted for?

917
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,232
Witness to the attempted murder
of an officer.

918
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,400
Oh, please.

919
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,777
- Which he suppressed.
- Why?

920
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,654
- In exchange for a bribe.
- A bribe?

921
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,406
This will end his career
with the police and send him...

922
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,451
...as well as the person who suborned
him to jail, with the assailant.

923
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,661
A bribe?

924
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,747
Your client gave him a wristwatch
worth $20,000...

925
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,791
...in exchange for his silence.

926
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:13,960
I'Î½e contacted the officer
and shared with him the alternatives.

927
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,338
You withdraw your claim
or we'll subpoena him...

928
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,715
...force him to incriminate you
and Mr. Terry...

929
01:01:18,883 --> 01:01:20,425
...for which you will stand triaI.

930
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,678
How would you like to proceed?

931
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,807
I'd like to proceed directly to court.

932
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,852
From the academy, I'll need
notebooks and journals from day one.

933
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,562
Thank you for your time.

934
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,440
Speak to no one about this case
from now on in.

935
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:06,012
You motherfucking son of a bitch.

936
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:10,392
What have I got? What have I got?
Nothing. Nothing.

937
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,646
Do you know what the pension is
for an officer who kills himself?

938
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,400
What is the pension of a suicide?

939
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,986
Do you know? It's nothing.

940
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,155
- Tell him. Tell him.
- Ma'am.

941
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,867
Please don't touch that.

942
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:30,662
He didn't wanna bring disgrace
on you.

943
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:35,417
I have no husband.
I have no husband.

944
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,837
I can't pay my bills.
I can't pay my rent.

945
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,299
And now I don't eÎ½en have
his pension. And for what?

946
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:46,178
For what? For your stupid principles?

947
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,680
You are a sick fool.

948
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,017
How am I going to live?

949
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:55,020
Who's gonna pay these bills?
Who's gonna pay these bills?

950
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,523
Are you? Are you? Are you?

951
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,317
Are you gonna take care of me, huh?

952
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:03,028
- What are you gonna do?
- I need you to step outside now.

953
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,281
How about that, huh?

954
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,034
All right.

955
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:28,506
Okay. Copies
of state regulations signed.

956
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:33,386
All right, we wanna get the main on,
if possible, by 11 p. m.

957
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:36,556
First elimination: Romero, Sanchez.

958
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:37,766
- Right here.
- Here.

959
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,644
Up second, Terry and Garcia.

960
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,939
Winner goes on to the second round.

961
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:48,818
All right, it's new,
but it's fairly straightforward.

962
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:52,906
As your match is called,
you wilI be walked to the ring.

963
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:57,535
We wilI now go to the ring, then I will
release you to the undercard room.

964
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,747
Now, no one is allowed
in the undercard room...

965
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:04,209
...but fighters and trainers.

966
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:08,213
Our part of the broadcast
starts at 8 p. m.

967
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,423
The broadcast starts at 8 p. m.

968
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:15,303
We wilI be calling the first fight
at 8: 15.

969
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:19,683
So you will take your corner.
The referee will calI you out...

970
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,311
...and an official
will perform the ceremony.

971
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,731
The officiant,
who will be wearing this mask...

972
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,858
...will show the bowl.

973
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:32,404
He will show the bowl
and the marbles.

974
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:36,199
He will then raise the bowl
and you will choose.

975
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,743
Black is the handicap.

976
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,664
The handicaps will be chosen
by the referee.

977
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,543
They are: left arm bound...

978
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,420
...right arm bound...

979
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,431
Okay, if you have no questions,
make your way back...

980
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:02,600
...to the undercard room. Thank you.

981
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:19,951
Yamato-damashii
is the undying spirit.

982
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,412
The spirit and honor of the samurai.

983
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,123
Yamato-damashii is a way of life.

984
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,417
Good. Good. Good.

985
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:32,547
- Sanchez, Romero. Sanchez, Romero.
- Come on. Good.

986
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,133
This fight is sanctioned by...

987
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:40,472
...and will be fought under the rules
of the California State Commission.

988
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,974
While the fighters are in the ring...

989
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:45,310
...they'll be under
supervision of the referee.

990
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:50,148
Any judgment made wilI be final
and subject only to disqualification...

991
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,776
...pending a drug test.

992
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,821
Trainers, I wanna see those cards
and I wanna see them signed.

993
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,659
Be strong. Grab the shoulders.
Grab the shoulders.

994
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:05,580
- is a legaI document signifying
your acceptance of the rules...

995
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,208
...under the statutes
of the State of California.

996
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:15,673
First fight. Sanchez and Romero.

997
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:19,427
And Dylan here is explaining what
the three possible handicaps could be.

998
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,346
What are they?
Break them down for us.

999
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,724
They'll basically draw from the bowl
a black or two white marbles.

1000
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:26,976
If you get a white,
you're getting a pass.

1001
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,228
If you draw the black...

1002
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:30,688
...you're gonna haÎ½e
one arm tied to your body...

1003
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:33,399
...or both arms tied to your body
or a blindfold.

1004
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,236
- Fighting with a blindfold?
- Yeah. How's that sound?

1005
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:40,782
That sounds like fun. Well, it's gonna
be fun for the audience tonight.

1006
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,460
Great to be here tonight.
Mike Goldberg with Josh Rafferty.

1007
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:37,839
Josh, the explosion of mixed martial
arts is unbelievable.

1008
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,508
Why do you think this sport
is so popular?

1009
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:59,360
It was a good warm-up.
It was awesome.

1010
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,615
Don't worry about them back there.

1011
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,009
Do you have your mouthpiece?

1012
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:26,638
Do you have your mouthpiece?
All right.

1013
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,562
Do you have your mouthpiece?

1014
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,273
Okay.

1015
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,460
Yeah, okay. Just take it easy.

1016
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,474
Ladies and gentlemen...

1017
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:57,061
...Bobby Sanchez has drawn
the handicap...

1018
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,939
...and he will fight one-armed.

1019
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:03,943
Bobby Sanchez has drawn
the handicap...

1020
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:06,821
...and he will fight one-armed.

1021
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,825
Welcome to the IFA.

1022
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,608
Okay, fighters, move forward.

1023
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,904
I went over instructions
in the dressing room.

1024
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:50,698
Do you have any questions?
Do you have any questions?

1025
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,867
Fight hard. Fight clean. Fight fair.

1026
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,619
Okay, touch gloves.

1027
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,245
To your corners.

1028
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:01,793
Okay, here we go.
Judge. Judge. Judge.

1029
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,545
Are you ready?
Are you ready? Fight!

1030
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:45,211
Terry and Garcia on deck.
Terry and Garcia.

1031
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,008
Terry and Garcia, next up.

1032
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:47,231
Stop, stop, stop!

1033
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,655
Stay down. Stay down. Stay down.

1034
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:04,415
Winner.

1035
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,263
By submission, at one minute-five
of the first round...

1036
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:22,225
...Felix Romero.

1037
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,272
Our next bout in 15 minutes
will feature...

1038
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:34,111
...Mike Terry and "Toro" Garcia.

1039
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,696
Okay.

1040
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:39,200
This fight is sanctioned by
and will be conducted...

1041
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,370
...under the rules
of the California State Commission.

1042
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,871
While they're in the ring...

1043
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,998
...they'll be under discretion
of the referee.

1044
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,376
Any judgment rendered by the judge
is final...

1045
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,336
...pending the outcome
of a drug test.

1046
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,629
Let's see the gloves.

1047
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,298
Your acknowledgement
of the physician's statement...

1048
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:58,177
...is a legal document signifying
your acceptance of the rules...

1049
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:00,429
Terry and Garcia.

1050
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:03,432
Let's see the blue card. All right.

1051
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,976
Let's go.

1052
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,812
Let's go. We got some people
waiting out there.

1053
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,314
Let's go. Come on.

1054
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,651
From Los Angeles, California,
a well-known figure...

1055
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:18,573
...in the martial-arts world,
a champion at close combat...

1056
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,993
...making his first appearance
in competition...

1057
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,037
...at 179 pounds...

1058
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:27,873
...Mike Terry.

1059
01:16:50,063 --> 01:16:52,773
Excuse me. You can't smoke here.

1060
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:00,197
Well, I don't know about you,
but I love it.

1061
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:02,742
And I think boxing is as dead
as Woodrow Wilson.

1062
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:03,951
What a fight.

1063
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,912
Yeah, I've got eyes on the fighters.
They're walking.

1064
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:11,584
Okay, handlers, keep a hand
on your boy, keep your eyes on me.

1065
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:15,838
You know the drill. We've been
through this before. Let's go.

1066
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,466
We'll be under here
for about 15 minutes...

1067
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,302
...then the man will come through
to take you to the ring.

1068
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,388
When you get to the ring,
listen to the ref.

1069
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,182
Sorry.

1070
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,101
I'm handing them off. I'm coming up
now under the bleachers.

1071
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:32,521
The undercard. What did we just see
in the first eÎ½ent, Dylan?

1072
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,066
Here's what we saw.
Here's what the IFA has done...

1073
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:37,610
Eyes on the prize, Mike.
Eyes on the prize.

1074
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,820
This is your road game.

1075
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:43,115
There's Terry, an unknown.
Hey, you saw the fight.

1076
01:17:43,283 --> 01:17:45,242
What do you think
of this new competition?

1077
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:48,621
One guy has a handicap. How would
that effect you as a fighter?

1078
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:51,499
After the fight, after the fight.
Leave my guy alone.

1079
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,168
They're coming down
the stairs, right?

1080
01:17:59,591 --> 01:18:01,634
Goddamn shame, Mike.

1081
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,136
Goddamn shame about Joey.

1082
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,514
He thought the world of you, Mike.

1083
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:16,524
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a very
special guest with us tonight.

1084
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,777
From Sao Paulo, Brazil...

1085
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:22,613
...the Redbelt himself...

1086
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:29,453
...the Professor,
Grandmaster Joao Moro.

1087
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:49,640
You. You, the fighter.
Back up. Back up.

1088
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:53,811
Back it up. Take it all the way.
Let's move it. Back up.

1089
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,524
It's fixed? The fight is fixed?

1090
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:43,319
Of course it's fixed.
What the fuck do you think?

1091
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,322
Hey, how you doing?

1092
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:56,916
What do you want?

1093
01:19:57,083 --> 01:20:01,629
You brought the old man up
from Brazil for this bullshit?

1094
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:04,215
You run your business, I run mine.

1095
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:07,551
Who I brought to where
is of no concern to you.

1096
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:10,763
- His life. His teachings.
- What do you know of his teachings?

1097
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,390
What the hell do you know
of his teachings?

1098
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:18,521
This is my family business,
and it is a business, okay?

1099
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:22,316
What the hell did you think it is?
There's television out there.

1100
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:26,695
It's about to be big business,
and no one has forgotten you.

1101
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:29,406
So cool down and sit down.

1102
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:31,826
None of the fighters know
the fight's gaffed.

1103
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:35,329
You weren't supposed to know.
You weren't supposed to know.

1104
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,666
- I don't get it.
- We pick who gets the white marble.

1105
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,336
Here's what you're missing.
Here's what you inÎ½ented. The thing?

1106
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,797
It's not a way to ensure
the fight is fair.

1107
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,842
Any two guys fighting for money,
no way the fight is fair.

1108
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:51,303
What you did is a way to fix the fight
without the fighter's knowledge.

1109
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:53,430
You stole my idea.

1110
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:57,434
How about that? So look, what?
Who gets the pass tonight? You.

1111
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:00,938
Every fight tonight, the other guy
gets the handicap. You win.

1112
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:03,941
You go home with the 50 grand.
You settle your various debts.

1113
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:07,236
How about that?
Make a name for yourself.

1114
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,530
I love a fighter. What the fuck?

1115
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,116
All right, alI right,
Ricardo's gotta rest.

1116
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,284
- Hold on.
- Are we done?

1117
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:14,535
- And.
- Aren't we done?

1118
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,580
And you come back in three months
for the rematch.

1119
01:21:17,747 --> 01:21:20,875
Ricardo fights Morisaki
to retake the crown.

1120
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,461
You're throwing the fight tonight?

1121
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:27,089
Everything in life,
the money's in the rematch.

1122
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,592
You told him he wins tonight?

1123
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:34,013
You'd throw the fight
in front of the Professor?

1124
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:36,432
The Professor an old man.

1125
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,642
He no longer has family to support.

1126
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,312
Terry? Terry?

1127
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:46,984
Fifteen minute warning on deck.
Fifteen minute warning.

1128
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:58,162
The cop died.

1129
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,790
Everybody dies.
You wanna help his widow?

1130
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,298
What about the stolen watch?

1131
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:12,509
My friend, he shot himself because
someone gave me a hot watch.

1132
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:14,845
Fellow sold me a watch.
I got a deal on a watch.

1133
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,389
How do I know where it came from?
I gave it to you.

1134
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:19,516
Is he fighting or you wanna call it?

1135
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:22,811
What kind of motherfucker pawns
a watch he got from Chet Frank?

1136
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:29,944
How'd you know
how the window broke?

1137
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:31,153
That ain't important.

1138
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,155
- We were the only ones there.
- Leave it.

1139
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:35,324
A guy killed himself
because a window broke.

1140
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:36,742
How'd you know?

1141
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,453
Your wife sold you out.

1142
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:45,250
Well, who did you think
you married?

1143
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,672
Brazilian princess
married the soldier.

1144
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:52,758
Five years
and the soldier's pumping gas.

1145
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,510
A smart girl's gonna move on.

1146
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:57,763
Your fight or I'm calling the fight
and you're out.

1147
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,979
Either way, Mike. Either way,
sometimes you gotta do business.

1148
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,897
Pack it up. We're going home.

1149
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:48,207
Ladies and gentlemen...

1150
01:24:48,374 --> 01:24:51,335
...on the undercard,
there's a substitution.

1151
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,797
Our next fight, a substitution.

1152
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,008
Juan "Toro" Garcia...

1153
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:01,720
...and fighting
in place of Mike Terry...

1154
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:05,724
...Steve "Moose" Malloran.

1155
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:11,563
Steve "Moose" Malloran
will fight Juan "Toro" Garcia.

1156
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:15,109
But jujitsu can,
if all else goes wrong...

1157
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,528
...give you the ability
to turn the fight around.

1158
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:20,572
And turn the fight around is exactly
what we saw here tonight.

1159
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,075
Teacher breaks up boys
fighting in the schoolyard.

1160
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:26,203
Asks one boy, "You like to
fight?" He says, "No. I like to win. "

1161
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,914
Well, after all, Dylan,
isn't that what it's all about?

1162
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:31,667
And that's why we're here
at the IFA tonight.

1163
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:35,170
- We out?
- Thanks.

1164
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:40,592
- Want me to take the mike, Dylan?
- I'Il see you at ringside in five minutes.

1165
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,140
Mr. Flynn!

1166
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:49,101
- Hey, hold on!
- Mr. Flynn!

1167
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,853
Mr. Flynn!

1168
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:53,480
Hey! Stop him! Stop him!

1169
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:55,774
Mr. Flynn!

1170
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,444
Mr. Flynn, I need to talk to you!

1171
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:05,200
- Mr. Flynn!
- Mike, Mike.

1172
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:08,078
- I need to talk to you!
- Stop him!

1173
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:09,872
WilI somebody stop him?

1174
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:12,332
Mr. Flynn,
I need to tell you something.

1175
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:20,799
Somebody stop him.

1176
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:24,761
What's wrong with you, huh?
You wanna fight?

1177
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:26,430
Why don't you go to the ring?

1178
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:27,848
Just a moment.

1179
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:33,478
- Mike, you hear me?
- I'm going to rip it open.

1180
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:36,565
Oh, you're gonna fucking rip it open?
All right, great.

1181
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,157
You think you're going to the ring?
Yeah? You're going nowhere.

1182
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:48,118
You're going nowhere. You see?

1183
01:26:48,286 --> 01:26:50,037
You're going nowhere.

1184
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:54,958
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
That's right. That's right.

1185
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,228
I'm ending this charade.

1186
01:27:39,671 --> 01:27:41,630
I'm going to the ring.

1187
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:46,551
You're going to the ring to do what?
To do what? To ruin my business?

1188
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,845
- That's right.
- I'd prefer you didn't do that.

1189
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:50,639
I understand that.

1190
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:54,768
You know? My sister's not wrong.
You are wrong.

1191
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:58,146
You know what you are?
You're addicted to poverty.

1192
01:27:58,314 --> 01:27:59,481
I'm going to the ring.

1193
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:02,401
I'm talking to you.

1194
01:28:02,568 --> 01:28:04,319
Okay.

1195
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,822
You wanna play?

1196
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:11,368
Okay. Let's do this thing.

1197
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:15,372
Let's play the game.

1198
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:21,253
a relatively new sport.

1199
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:23,880
It's only been here in this country
for 14 years...

1200
01:28:24,048 --> 01:28:27,384
...a little longer than that in Brazil
and Japan, but still relatively-

1201
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,886
After alI, that's what this is about.

1202
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,805
The old meets the new.

1203
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:35,976
I'm excited about the undercard
here tonight. For these competitors...

1204
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:40,230
Tommy. Tommy, check this out.

1205
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,649
You've gotta see this.

1206
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:01,752
- That's Terry.
- That's Mike.
