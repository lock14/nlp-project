1
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:18,262
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:22,134
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:33,341
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:36,039
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:39,610
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:39,822 --> 00:01:41,756
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,158
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,022
...l'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,527
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:55,127
-Your file shows no kills, and it takes--
-Two.

11
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,085
Shame.

12
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:14,754
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,987
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,025
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,395
True.

16
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,638
How did he die?

17
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,307
Your contact?

18
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:32,998
Not well.

19
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,942
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,182
Well...

21
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,615
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:32,750
The second is--

23
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,561
Yes.

24
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,423
Considerably.

25
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:37,465
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,233
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,665
That's all my organization
will guarantee.

28
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:25,742
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:28,211
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

30
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:31,113
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:38,190
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,020
No.

33
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,890
I believe in
a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,363
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,830
Agreed.

36
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:48,832
And I can access it
anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:50,230
Yes.

38
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,418
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

39
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:13,288
<i>...of Skyfleet stock.</i>

40
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:17,364
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

41
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,730
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:23,633
Just do it.

43
00:09:58,408 --> 00:10:00,875
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:06,073
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,328
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:25,432
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,327
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,596
-Sorry?
-Put your hand down.

49
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:39,570
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

50
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:13,720
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,320
...my dear general.

52
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,553
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,195
All in.

54
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,127
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:30,338 --> 00:20:32,432
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,199
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:04,566
-We have less than 36 hours. I can--
-No. No, no.

58
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,502
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:11,439
Give our guests
five minutes to leave...

60
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,944
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:27,257
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:29,953
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

63
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,358
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:35,263
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:38,269
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:38,574 --> 00:21:41,134
And how the hell
could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,210
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:46,813
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,539
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

70
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,377
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

71
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:53,417
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:11,692
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,390
Sorry.

74
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,398
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:17,265
Or yourself.

76
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:19,497
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,232
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,036
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:26,180
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:28,076
We wanted to question him,
not kill him.

81
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:32,486
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:33,746
I did.

83
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,948
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

84
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:38,955
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:42,986
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:44,688
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,027
Hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

88
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:50,467
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:50,672 --> 00:23:52,502
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,575
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

91
00:23:55,777 --> 00:23:58,108
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,904
The same way
I found out your name.

93
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:03,049
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for--

94
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:05,720
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,917
I knew it was too early
to promote you.

96
00:24:10,459 --> 00:24:14,394
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:16,790
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,941
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:31,509
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:34,843
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

101
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,914
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:39,519
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

103
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:42,246
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

104
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,219
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:51,056
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:53,290
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:54,866
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,971
Because these bastards
want your head.

109
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:01,631
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

110
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:10,974
And Bond...

111
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,982
...don't ever break into
my house again.

112
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:19,858
Ma'am.

113
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:35,400
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:42,638
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:56,450
Hello.

116
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,785
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

117
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,296
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,642
<i>Security to car park.
Security to car park.</i>

119
00:27:48,844 --> 00:27:50,538
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:32,134
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

121
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:35,782
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,383
Okay.

123
00:29:38,886 --> 00:29:42,253
-We have an ocean-view villa.
-Perfect.

124
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:47,625
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

125
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:51,788
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,093
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know--?

127
00:29:54,301 --> 00:29:56,736
-Mr. Dimitrios.
-Right.

128
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:59,670
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:59,874 --> 00:30:01,568
Isn't the type
to take bad news well.

130
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:05,413
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:08,674
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:10,317 --> 00:30:11,615
Thank you.

133
00:31:12,713 --> 00:31:15,410
-What?
-He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:18,050
You woke me
to share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:20,221
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

136
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,480
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:25,557
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

138
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,125
<i>Well, I'm doing my best to find out.</i>

139
00:31:28,328 --> 00:31:32,197
<i>-Who's he looking at?
-Alex Dimitrios.</i>

140
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,227
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:46,712
Now known associates....

142
00:31:58,425 --> 00:31:59,858
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:16,277 --> 00:32:18,939
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:19,881 --> 00:32:21,609
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:24,046
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,886
-Look what just happened.
-Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:27,087 --> 00:32:28,316
Yeah.

148
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:37,163
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:39,595
-Oh, good evening. How are you?
-Good evening.

150
00:32:51,246 --> 00:32:53,180
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:53,381 --> 00:32:55,041
I'm in.

152
00:32:57,451 --> 00:32:59,146
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:01,823 --> 00:33:04,586
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

154
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,423
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,563
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:16,259
I heard you.

157
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:18,667
Five to call.

158
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:23,574
-Action's to you.
-Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:25,143
Ace high.

160
00:33:26,815 --> 00:33:28,281
Check or bet.

161
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:29,972
-Check.
-And to you.

162
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:32,118
Five thousand.

163
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:37,521
Five to call.

164
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,736
-Check.
-Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,734
All in.

166
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,207
No, wait.

167
00:33:57,612 --> 00:33:59,078
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:01,814
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:08,411
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,956
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,152
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

172
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:27,101
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,545
Three kings.

174
00:34:39,721 --> 00:34:41,483
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,088
Trip aces.

176
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,384
Aces win.

177
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,427
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:56,202
Thank you.

179
00:34:56,403 --> 00:34:57,871
Sir.

180
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:32,369
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,570
No wonder he was
in such a foul mood.

182
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:39,005
My mistake.

183
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:40,474
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:44,516
That would really send him
over the edge.

185
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,652
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:48,945
Well, perhaps you're just
out of practice.

187
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,027
Perhaps.

188
00:35:58,231 --> 00:35:59,960
Well, what about
a drink at my place?

189
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,858
Your place?

190
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:06,137
-Is it close?
-Very.

191
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,411
One drink.

192
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,333
Good evening, sir,
and welcome back.

193
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:43,442
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,750
<i>I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.</i>

195
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,621
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:06,322
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:10,603
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:13,373
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:15,541
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,740
I have someone else
willing to do the job.

201
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,742
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:23,344
...and payment.

203
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:37,956
You like married women,
don't you, James?

204
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,360
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:46,101
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:49,275
You, my husband....

207
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,139
I had so many chances
to be happy...

208
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:54,711
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:57,612
Why can't nice guys
be more like you?

210
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,048
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,251
Yes.

212
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,826
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:15,701
What makes your husband
a bad man?

214
00:38:15,902 --> 00:38:18,463
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,333
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:24,204
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:24,878 --> 00:38:30,181
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

218
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:32,851
How afraid?

219
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,219
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:45,958
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:51,297
Now would seem
an appropriate time.

222
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:53,871
Does "ellipsis"
mean anything to you?

223
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:05,184
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,717
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:09,849
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,956
<i>I'm on the last flight
tonight to Miami.</i>

227
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,788
<i>Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.</i>

228
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:17,327
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:17,532 --> 00:39:20,295
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:26,239
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,603
...so you have all night
to question me.

232
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:34,914
In that case...

233
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:36,242
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,815
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:46,123
<i>Good evening. Room Service.</i>

236
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:50,126
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:51,559
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,233
<i>-With everything?
-Yes, with everything.</i>

239
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,527
<i>-And would that be for two, sir?
-What?</i>

240
00:39:56,737 --> 00:40:00,001
<i>-For two?
-No, for one.</i>

241
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:34,835
Wait here.

242
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:42,076
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:48,418
<i>Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...</i>

244
00:40:48,623 --> 00:40:51,456
<i>...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...</i>

245
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,422
<i>...nervous and vascular systems.</i>

246
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:57,422
<i>Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?</i>

247
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:02,324
<i>I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.</i>

248
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,690
<i>This is edutainment.</i>

249
00:42:30,056 --> 00:42:32,217
<i>--fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...</i>

250
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,293
<i>...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.</i>

251
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,967
Hello.

252
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:54,079
Hello.

253
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:06,248
<i>Do not leave your vehicle unattended.</i>

254
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,019
<i>Welcome to Miami
International Airport.</i>

255
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,358
<i>Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted....</i>

256
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,353
-Yes.
-It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,293
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

258
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:56,766
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:59,530
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

260
00:45:00,007 --> 00:45:02,668
-Sorry, can I put you on hold?
-I thought you might.

261
00:45:07,114 --> 00:45:09,844
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:13,675
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:36,476 --> 00:45:38,809
-The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
-What about it?

264
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:42,244
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:23,657 --> 00:46:24,681
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:24,891 --> 00:46:26,483
<i>Bond? Bond!</i>

267
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:31,588
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:33,733
<i>It's launching today.</i>

269
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:37,929
I gotta go.

270
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,998
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:07,768 --> 00:52:09,632
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:47,530
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:53,137
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,840
Someone talked.

275
00:54:25,672 --> 00:54:27,572
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:27,773 --> 00:54:29,833
I'm gonna get a few more photos....

277
00:54:44,224 --> 00:54:47,250
Quite the body count
you're stacking up.

278
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:50,791
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,625
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

280
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:56,427
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

281
00:54:56,635 --> 00:54:57,603
No.

282
00:54:57,804 --> 00:55:01,262
-Not your name, what you were after?
-No.

283
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:02,907
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,873
Knew where to put his hands
on weapons...

285
00:55:05,077 --> 00:55:06,510
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:06,713 --> 00:55:08,340
He worked with anyone
who had money.

287
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:11,914
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,018
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:17,679
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:17,891 --> 00:55:19,653
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,420
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

292
00:55:22,628 --> 00:55:27,190
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:56,463 --> 00:55:57,952
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:00,789
Yes.

295
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:08,833
<i>When they analyzed
the stock market after 9l11...</i>

296
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:12,340
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:16,376
<i>When the stocks hit bottom on 9l12,
somebody made a fortune.</i>

298
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,643
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:19,853 --> 00:56:21,081
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:21,288 --> 00:56:25,054
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:29,284
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:30,297 --> 00:56:32,197
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:32,398 --> 00:56:35,333
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:35,534 --> 00:56:37,230
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:41,498
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:44,472
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

307
00:56:44,677 --> 00:56:47,237
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:49,414
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

309
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:53,882
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:57,487
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

311
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,523
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

312
00:57:00,726 --> 00:57:02,092
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:04,525
If he loses,
he'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:04,731 --> 00:57:07,563
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:09,496
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:09,702 --> 00:57:12,364
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:16,132
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,373
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:23,016 --> 00:57:27,349
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

320
00:57:27,554 --> 00:57:30,717
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:31,423 --> 00:57:33,255
No.

322
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,954
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:38,197 --> 00:57:39,494
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:41,063
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:41,934 --> 00:57:43,960
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

326
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:47,436
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:05,992 --> 00:58:07,686
Thank you.

328
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:16,065
I'm the money.

329
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:19,632
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:22,074 --> 00:58:24,168
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

331
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,206
"Vesper."

332
00:58:27,414 --> 00:58:29,905
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

333
00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:32,117
Thank you.

334
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:33,980
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:34,186 --> 00:58:36,621
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,849
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,393
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:42,594 --> 00:58:45,119
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:49,666
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:49,869 --> 00:58:52,894
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:56,007
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:59,378 --> 00:59:00,777
What looks good?

343
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:10,818
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

344
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:12,992
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

345
00:59:13,193 --> 00:59:15,855
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

346
00:59:16,396 --> 00:59:18,295
So that would be
what you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:23,164
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:25,860
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

349
00:59:26,072 --> 00:59:27,436
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:30,005
-And you're good at reading people?
-Yes, I am.

351
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,905
Which is why
I've been able to detect...

352
00:59:32,112 --> 00:59:34,239
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:37,815
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

354
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:41,079
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,777
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:42,989 --> 00:59:45,548
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:45,759 --> 00:59:47,989
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

358
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:50,219
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

359
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:52,590
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,391
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:56,858
You worry you won't
be taken seriously.

362
00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:00,061
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

363
01:00:00,273 --> 01:00:01,831
True, but this one
overcompensates...

364
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,871
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:04,077 --> 01:00:06,443
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

366
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:09,114
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

367
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:12,648
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:12,851 --> 01:00:15,047
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

369
01:00:15,255 --> 01:00:18,018
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

370
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:22,552
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

371
01:00:22,762 --> 01:00:25,856
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

372
01:00:26,065 --> 01:00:28,726
...l'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:31,704 --> 01:00:33,637
All right.

374
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:37,067
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:37,277 --> 01:00:39,643
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

376
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,746
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:41,947 --> 01:00:43,847
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

378
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:46,610
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

379
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,753
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

380
01:00:48,954 --> 01:00:51,822
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:54,516
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

382
01:00:54,726 --> 01:00:56,717
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,657
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:03,135 --> 01:01:04,967
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,934
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:09,539
...since Ml6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:09,742 --> 01:01:12,005
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

388
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,407
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

389
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:15,706
You know...

390
01:01:15,914 --> 01:01:19,851
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

391
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,719
-Rolex?
-Omega.

392
01:01:22,922 --> 01:01:24,753
Beautiful.

393
01:01:25,257 --> 01:01:26,918
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:27,126 --> 01:01:29,958
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:30,163 --> 01:01:31,527
No, of course not.

396
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:33,425
But it wouldn't be a stretch
to imagine.

397
01:01:33,632 --> 01:01:35,793
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:38,094
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:39,572 --> 01:01:41,699
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

400
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,342
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

401
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:46,512
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:48,503
You noticed?

403
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:50,706
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,248
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:52,652 --> 01:01:54,210
Skewered.

406
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,047
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:57,891 --> 01:01:59,380
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:01,923
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:20,411
-Hotel Splendid, sir?
-That's right.

410
01:02:22,681 --> 01:02:24,911
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

411
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:41,228
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:44,664
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:48,373
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:48,574 --> 01:02:51,271
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:54,646
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

416
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:56,405
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest--

417
01:02:56,615 --> 01:02:58,811
-I am not.
-You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:00,985
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:03,086
We've been involved
for quite a while...

420
01:03:03,684 --> 01:03:05,447
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:05,652 --> 01:03:08,018
But my family
is strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:08,222 --> 01:03:10,952
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:11,157 --> 01:03:14,422
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

424
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:17,128
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:17,331 --> 01:03:19,298
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

426
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,264
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:22,503 --> 01:03:23,594
Smart?

428
01:03:24,204 --> 01:03:25,900
Single.

429
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:47,115
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

430
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:50,195
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:50,396 --> 01:03:53,126
-Welcome, Mr. Bond.
-You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:53,766 --> 01:03:56,099
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,103
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:04,902
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:09,074
Very funny.

436
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:11,251
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

437
01:04:11,452 --> 01:04:13,351
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

438
01:04:13,721 --> 01:04:15,951
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

439
01:04:16,155 --> 01:04:18,521
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

440
01:04:18,726 --> 01:04:21,023
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

441
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:23,753
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

442
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,690
And now he knows
something about you.

443
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,094
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,532
Take the next one.

445
01:04:30,737 --> 01:04:33,605
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

446
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:35,565
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:35,775 --> 01:04:38,108
-It was left for you.
-Thank you.

448
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:10,766
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:49,949 --> 01:05:55,148
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

450
01:05:58,659 --> 01:06:00,217
Does he know
we've been watching him?

451
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:03,088
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:07,630
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

453
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,235
I'm afraid if you get
into trouble here...

454
01:06:10,436 --> 01:06:14,168
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:17,505
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:17,945 --> 01:06:21,472
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

457
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:25,016
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

458
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:27,119
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,878
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:29,956 --> 01:06:32,152
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

461
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:34,327
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:34,527 --> 01:06:37,155
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:37,364 --> 01:06:40,527
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:43,931
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:53,206
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:53,414 --> 01:06:57,373
...but the accountants seem
to be running Ml6 these days.

467
01:06:58,452 --> 01:07:01,648
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

468
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:04,119
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:08,753
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

470
01:07:08,961 --> 01:07:12,556
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:12,766 --> 01:07:17,099
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:22,668
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:07:28,148 --> 01:07:29,512
Yes?

474
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:31,844
For you.

475
01:07:33,019 --> 01:07:35,510
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,322
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:39,525 --> 01:07:41,824
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:44,394
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

479
01:07:44,597 --> 01:07:46,327
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:46,532 --> 01:07:48,932
Do you think you can
do that for me?

481
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:51,070
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:54,072
Thank you.

483
01:08:06,085 --> 01:08:07,313
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:08,521 --> 01:08:10,853
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

485
01:08:11,057 --> 01:08:12,217
This is the latter.

486
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:15,623
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

487
01:08:16,063 --> 01:08:17,689
How--?

488
01:08:18,498 --> 01:08:19,966
It's tailored.

489
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:22,726
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:19,051
-Good evening, sir.
-Good evening.

491
01:09:20,993 --> 01:09:22,654
Thank you.

492
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,567
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:35,775 --> 01:09:37,868
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:39,078 --> 01:09:41,877
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

495
01:09:42,082 --> 01:09:44,515
Well, we wouldn't want that,
would we?

496
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:55,952
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:56,162 --> 01:09:58,756
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

498
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,899
Five communal cards,
two in the hole.

499
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,131
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:04,337 --> 01:10:05,565
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:10,399
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:13,511
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:13,713 --> 01:10:15,806
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

504
01:10:16,015 --> 01:10:18,746
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

505
01:10:18,952 --> 01:10:20,112
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:22,048
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

507
01:10:22,256 --> 01:10:24,382
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,957 --> 01:10:26,686
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:27,127 --> 01:10:28,287
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:28,494 --> 01:10:30,929
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

511
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:40,498
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:56,248
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:04,594
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:04,797 --> 01:11:07,823
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:08,034 --> 01:11:11,493
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

516
01:11:13,606 --> 01:11:15,631
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:40,591
Four players.

518
01:11:43,203 --> 01:11:44,533
It's your bet.

519
01:11:46,073 --> 01:11:47,539
Check.

520
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,537
Check.

521
01:11:53,846 --> 01:11:55,905
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:09,128 --> 01:12:10,390
Call.

523
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:14,929
Fold.

524
01:12:17,136 --> 01:12:19,537
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:25,277
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:39,350
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:42,462 --> 01:12:45,453
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

528
01:12:45,664 --> 01:12:48,690
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:49,235 --> 01:12:51,430
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:55,242 --> 01:12:57,641
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:59,613 --> 01:13:00,806
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:01,014 --> 01:13:03,676
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:06,212
Call.

534
01:13:11,358 --> 01:13:12,518
Hello.

535
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:16,320
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:16,529 --> 01:13:19,658
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

537
01:13:19,865 --> 01:13:20,832
Champagne.

538
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:26,403
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:37,484 --> 01:13:38,780
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:48,957
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

541
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:53,792
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,796
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:00,036
Fold.

544
01:14:07,413 --> 01:14:09,746
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,689
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:20,894 --> 01:14:22,588
Three measures Gordon's,
one of vodka...

547
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:24,627
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

548
01:14:24,831 --> 01:14:27,663
-...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
-Yes, sir.

549
01:14:27,868 --> 01:14:30,734
-You know, I'll have one of those.
-So will I.

550
01:14:31,704 --> 01:14:32,932
Certainly.

551
01:14:33,873 --> 01:14:37,775
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:39,975
That's it?

553
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:42,872
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:43,082 --> 01:14:44,243
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,194
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:08,707 --> 01:15:10,038
You taste nice.

557
01:15:10,243 --> 01:15:13,177
-I thought we dispensed with covers.
-No.

558
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,077
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:17,283 --> 01:15:18,807
-Is he watching?
-Yes.

560
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,077
Good.

561
01:15:20,287 --> 01:15:23,051
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:23,256 --> 01:15:25,019
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:25,225 --> 01:15:28,194
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

564
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:30,386
Check.

565
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,862
-You know, that's not half bad.
-Up to you.

566
01:15:33,065 --> 01:15:34,966
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

567
01:15:36,502 --> 01:15:39,063
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:39,405 --> 01:15:40,667
What do you mean?

569
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:43,065
The twitch he has to hide
when he bluffs.

570
01:15:43,275 --> 01:15:47,405
-Bluffs? He had the best hand.
-Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:47,613 --> 01:15:49,809
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

572
01:15:50,015 --> 01:15:51,984
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

573
01:15:52,185 --> 01:15:53,708
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,751
-Did you get the bug?
-Yes.

575
01:15:55,956 --> 01:15:57,820
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:58,024 --> 01:15:59,547
Thank you.

577
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,793
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,996 --> 01:16:06,021
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:06,865 --> 01:16:08,298
Call.

580
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:11,871
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:14,407 --> 01:16:16,931
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:17,143 --> 01:16:18,905
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

583
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:23,572
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:52,412 --> 01:16:58,180
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,650
So?

586
01:17:01,854 --> 01:17:03,981
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:04,189 --> 01:17:05,520
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:05,725 --> 01:17:08,659
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:32,618 --> 01:17:36,247
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:40,283
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:43,162 --> 01:17:44,720
Where is my money?

592
01:17:49,269 --> 01:17:50,462
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

593
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:52,899
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:57,543 --> 01:17:59,204
Thank you.

595
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,644
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:05,185 --> 01:18:06,981
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:08,787 --> 01:18:10,516
Open that.

598
01:18:26,538 --> 01:18:28,597
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:30,838
All of it.

600
01:18:44,323 --> 01:18:48,283
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:52,832 --> 01:18:54,560
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:55,835 --> 01:18:57,631
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:58,270 --> 01:18:59,863
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:09,783 --> 01:19:12,717
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:26,064 --> 01:19:27,032
Stairs.

606
01:19:31,537 --> 01:19:34,166
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:34,774 --> 01:19:37,333
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:41,689
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:41,896 --> 01:21:45,127
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:45,332 --> 01:21:48,359
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:53,792
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:57,832
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:58,038 --> 01:22:59,266
A little.

614
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:03,034
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:07,271
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:12,878
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

617
01:24:13,914 --> 01:24:15,779
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:31,365 --> 01:24:33,197
That's better.

619
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:38,603
You cold?

620
01:24:38,806 --> 01:24:40,206
Yeah.

621
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,307
Here.

622
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:41,297
You have any trouble
with the bodies?

623
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,796
Less than some.

624
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:01,315
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:02,256 --> 01:26:04,953
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,390
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

627
01:26:09,029 --> 01:26:11,260
How's our girl?

628
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,997
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,114
Call.

630
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,720
Fold.

631
01:26:35,923 --> 01:26:37,891
And call.

632
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,252
Three players.

633
01:26:44,865 --> 01:26:46,628
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,496
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,033
Call.

636
01:26:53,774 --> 01:26:54,742
And call.

637
01:26:59,913 --> 01:27:01,211
Three players.

638
01:27:05,552 --> 01:27:06,542
Check.

639
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,220
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:23,104 --> 01:27:25,537
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:37,217 --> 01:27:41,518
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:41,722 --> 01:27:43,747
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:46,792
It's up to you.

644
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,333
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:04,775
Seems someone knows
something I don't.

646
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:07,007
Fold.

647
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,978
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:09,184 --> 01:28:10,742
It's up to you.

649
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,399
Two.

650
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,261
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:33,297
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:46,250
I'm all in.

653
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:56,027
Well, it's 14 million
and 500,000.

654
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:58,563
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:05,570
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

656
01:29:06,507 --> 01:29:09,238
-Call.
-Call.

657
01:29:09,676 --> 01:29:12,042
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:16,180
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:18,408
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:31,365 --> 01:29:35,063
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:42,235
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:42,911 --> 01:29:44,070
Please.

663
01:29:44,279 --> 01:29:46,577
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:50,113
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,220
Good game.

666
01:30:27,354 --> 01:30:30,688
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,591
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:36,528
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:37,332 --> 01:30:40,323
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

670
01:30:40,534 --> 01:30:41,967
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

671
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:44,470
Sorry?

672
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:46,435
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,039
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:50,573
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:53,837
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:54,047 --> 01:30:55,447
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:55,649 --> 01:30:57,618
All you're going to do now
is lose more.

678
01:30:58,252 --> 01:30:59,412
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:02,488
-I'm sorry?
-I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:04,391 --> 01:31:06,655
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:07,427 --> 01:31:09,190
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:11,832 --> 01:31:14,426
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:37,324 --> 01:31:38,484
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:41,490
-Shaken or stirred?
-Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,944
-James.
-Get the girl out.

686
01:32:09,222 --> 01:32:10,189
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:13,484
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:17,322
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:19,332 --> 01:32:20,731
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,426
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

691
01:32:23,637 --> 01:32:25,902
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,274
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:29,976 --> 01:32:31,341
No.

694
01:32:34,681 --> 01:32:38,618
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:41,481
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

696
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:44,649
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

697
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:49,728
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:53,430
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:56,694
Does it look like
we need the money?

700
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:10,341
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:12,552 --> 01:33:14,247
Why not?

702
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:19,215
Bet.

703
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:22,956
Raise.

704
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:40,412
And fold.

705
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:44,618
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:47,947
Call.

707
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:50,650
Raise.

708
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:54,315
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:56,831 --> 01:33:58,765
-Fold.
-Thank you.

710
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,295
Fold.

711
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,097
Fold.

712
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:14,447
Thank you.

713
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:15,615
Wins.

714
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:37,896
Deal me out.

715
01:34:38,905 --> 01:34:42,033
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:45,569
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:49,676 --> 01:35:52,077
-Who is it?
-It's 007.

718
01:35:53,747 --> 01:35:56,307
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:58,485 --> 01:36:00,920
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

720
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,750
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:04,057 --> 01:36:05,217
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:06,949
Remove the defibrillator
from the pouch.

723
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:09,493
<i>-Do we know what it is yet?
-We're still scanning.</i>

724
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:17,865
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:26,514 --> 01:36:28,481
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,581
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,412
<i>...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?</i>

728
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:36,350
<i>-As soon as it reads charged--
-Lidocaine. That'll work.</i>

729
01:36:36,556 --> 01:36:39,024
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:39,225 --> 01:36:40,658
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:43,226
<i>There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.</i>

732
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:48,099
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:50,600
<i>That'll counteract the digitalis.</i>

734
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,704
You're going to pass out
in a few seconds.

735
01:36:55,909 --> 01:36:57,342
You need to keep
your heart going.

736
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:58,773
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:07,319
-Bond, push the damn button!
-Do it now!

738
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:57,170
-You okay?
-Me?

739
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:03,101
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

740
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:06,972
-Now get yourself off to a hospital.
-I will do.

741
01:38:07,981 --> 01:38:09,381
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:09,582 --> 01:38:12,313
You're not seriously
going back there?

743
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:16,788
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:18,426 --> 01:38:20,018
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:23,764 --> 01:38:25,322
-All in.
-Call. All in.

746
01:38:25,533 --> 01:38:28,127
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:30,136 --> 01:38:32,037
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:35,975 --> 01:38:38,409
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:48,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:50,948
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:55,988
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:56,197 --> 01:38:57,960
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:58,164 --> 01:39:01,362
The big blind is now
1 million dollars.

754
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:09,568
Four players.

755
01:39:12,378 --> 01:39:13,743
It's your bet.

756
01:39:17,784 --> 01:39:18,944
-Monsieur Bond?
-Check.

757
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:22,987
-Check.
-Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:27,987
Check. And check.

759
01:39:28,429 --> 01:39:30,020
All check.

760
01:39:30,363 --> 01:39:31,557
Four players.

761
01:39:36,569 --> 01:39:37,969
-Check.
-Check.

762
01:39:43,877 --> 01:39:46,038
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:49,471
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:57,253
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:57,457 --> 01:40:00,018
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:08,865
Raise.

767
01:40:10,436 --> 01:40:11,631
Raise.

768
01:40:11,838 --> 01:40:15,104
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:48,833
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:53,109
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:11,998 --> 01:41:15,594
Well, I think I will call you
on that one.

772
01:41:22,443 --> 01:41:23,636
Call.

773
01:41:35,521 --> 01:41:39,720
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

774
01:41:39,926 --> 01:41:42,657
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:48,234
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:59,801
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:20,091
A higher full house.

778
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:21,768
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:28,969
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:46,025 --> 01:42:48,516
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:50,195
A straight flush.

782
01:42:50,396 --> 01:42:51,694
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,992
The high hand.

784
01:42:58,706 --> 01:43:00,229
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,538
-For you.
-Thank you very much.

786
01:43:05,979 --> 01:43:07,172
Congratulations.

787
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:10,908
-He's all yours.
-Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:17,890 --> 01:43:19,051
Congratulations.

789
01:43:19,259 --> 01:43:21,123
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:23,853
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:27,724
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,010
Thank you.

793
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:51,523
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:51,725 --> 01:43:54,353
They're going to extract him
before dawn.

795
01:43:55,061 --> 01:43:57,029
You know, I think
I'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:58,431 --> 01:44:00,229
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:04,597
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:10,301
-I thought that was quite a good line.
-It was a very good line.

799
01:44:11,545 --> 01:44:13,034
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:17,645
-Not so much it as you.
-Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:23,957 --> 01:44:25,515
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:27,961 --> 01:44:30,225
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:33,627
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

804
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:35,461
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:36,369 --> 01:44:37,837
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:43,270
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:52,615
You can switch off so easily,
can't you?

808
01:44:52,985 --> 01:44:55,180
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

809
01:44:55,788 --> 01:44:58,814
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

810
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,989
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:02,628 --> 01:45:04,789
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:04,997 --> 01:45:06,590
Just because
you've done something...

813
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,926
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:12,037
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

815
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:14,207
You think I can't take
my own advice?

816
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:17,770
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:20,337
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

818
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:28,412
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:30,350
Good night.

820
01:45:30,556 --> 01:45:31,887
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:51,177 --> 01:45:53,009
Mathis.

822
01:47:44,957 --> 01:47:48,894
I'm afraid your friend Mathis
is really...

823
01:47:50,162 --> 01:47:51,960
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:37,465
You've taken good care
of your body.

825
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:46,501
Such a waste.

826
01:49:49,846 --> 01:49:51,677
You know...

827
01:49:52,048 --> 01:49:55,176
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

828
01:49:55,385 --> 01:49:57,579
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:49:57,787 --> 01:50:01,314
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:02,826 --> 01:50:03,985
And of course...

831
01:50:04,194 --> 01:50:07,162
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

832
01:50:07,363 --> 01:50:10,025
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

833
01:50:10,734 --> 01:50:14,363
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

834
01:50:20,444 --> 01:50:22,344
The only question remains...

835
01:50:23,846 --> 01:50:26,007
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:28,085 --> 01:50:31,212
I want the money.

837
01:50:49,939 --> 01:50:53,376
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

838
01:50:53,577 --> 01:50:55,943
So all I need from you
is the password.

839
01:51:05,721 --> 01:51:08,953
The password, please.

840
01:51:13,195 --> 01:51:15,493
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:15,698 --> 01:51:17,564
...down there.

842
01:51:18,335 --> 01:51:19,801
Would you mind?

843
01:51:27,543 --> 01:51:30,944
No! No! No!

844
01:51:31,914 --> 01:51:35,612
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

845
01:51:35,819 --> 01:51:38,252
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:40,189 --> 01:51:41,680
Yeah!

847
01:51:42,926 --> 01:51:46,225
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:51:51,902 --> 01:51:57,340
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

849
01:51:58,641 --> 01:52:00,632
I died?

850
01:52:00,844 --> 01:52:02,140
-I died?
-Yes.

851
01:52:02,345 --> 01:52:05,314
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:05,515 --> 01:52:07,345
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

853
01:52:07,551 --> 01:52:10,384
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

854
01:52:10,587 --> 01:52:11,985
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:12,189 --> 01:52:14,247
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:14,457 --> 01:52:17,256
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:17,461 --> 01:52:20,453
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:20,663 --> 01:52:23,462
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

859
01:52:25,002 --> 01:52:28,631
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:29,872 --> 01:52:31,931
The big picture.

861
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:42,079
Give me the password...

862
01:52:42,284 --> 01:52:44,219
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:50,984
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:04,073 --> 01:53:06,201
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

865
01:53:06,409 --> 01:53:08,207
No.

866
01:53:10,046 --> 01:53:11,947
So I think...

867
01:53:16,485 --> 01:53:19,921
...l'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

868
01:53:33,069 --> 01:53:35,333
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:36,238 --> 01:53:38,729
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:38,942 --> 01:53:43,402
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:07,037 --> 01:54:08,435
Francesco.

872
01:54:09,372 --> 01:54:11,271
Francesco.

873
01:54:23,987 --> 01:54:26,113
Vesper.

874
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:29,890
Vesper.

875
01:54:32,028 --> 01:54:33,551
No.

876
01:54:34,363 --> 01:54:35,694
Not him.

877
01:54:35,899 --> 01:54:37,798
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:39,636 --> 01:54:40,796
No.

879
01:54:41,637 --> 01:54:43,662
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:46,443 --> 01:54:48,239
Not him.

881
01:54:50,146 --> 01:54:51,306
Any ideas?

882
01:54:55,051 --> 01:54:58,885
-What?
-Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:02,323
Where is she?

884
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:05,260
Sleeping.

885
01:55:05,862 --> 01:55:09,127
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

886
01:55:10,233 --> 01:55:11,894
It's just odd...

887
01:55:12,101 --> 01:55:16,003
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:16,206 --> 01:55:19,538
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:22,837
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:23,380 --> 01:55:25,109
No.

891
01:55:26,582 --> 01:55:28,015
Shame.

892
01:55:29,685 --> 01:55:31,414
Drink up.

893
01:55:34,823 --> 01:55:36,984
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:37,194 --> 01:55:39,219
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:39,429 --> 01:55:41,055
Help us?

896
01:55:41,264 --> 01:55:43,493
Or help you?

897
01:56:23,872 --> 01:56:25,033
Hello.

898
01:56:25,242 --> 01:56:27,073
Hello.

899
01:56:28,778 --> 01:56:30,074
You all right?

900
01:56:30,713 --> 01:56:32,875
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:33,082 --> 01:56:37,712
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:38,854 --> 01:56:40,845
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:44,594 --> 01:56:47,688
If you'd just been born...

904
01:56:48,364 --> 01:56:50,628
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:53,595
You have me there.

906
01:56:56,273 --> 01:56:58,969
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:01,043 --> 01:57:02,568
I can?

908
01:57:02,779 --> 01:57:06,646
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

909
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:10,551
Does this mean
that you're warming to me?

910
01:57:10,753 --> 01:57:12,948
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:13,155 --> 01:57:14,588
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:14,791 --> 01:57:18,658
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as....

913
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:22,757
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:23,332 --> 01:57:26,234
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:29,261
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:32,042 --> 01:57:35,671
-Hello.
-Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:37,113 --> 01:57:39,842
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:42,041
My apologies,
I do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:42,252 --> 01:57:44,243
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

920
01:57:44,453 --> 01:57:47,287
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

921
01:57:47,489 --> 01:57:49,617
I'm afraid not.

922
01:57:50,827 --> 01:57:53,694
If you would type in
the account number.

923
01:58:00,770 --> 01:58:02,168
And now the password.

924
01:58:02,971 --> 01:58:04,131
You can do that.

925
01:58:04,841 --> 01:58:06,899
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:13,881
V-E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:24,728 --> 01:58:26,524
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:26,729 --> 01:58:29,596
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:31,434 --> 01:58:34,664
-Auf Wiedersehen.
-Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:41,243 --> 01:58:42,643
You know, James...

931
01:58:45,247 --> 01:58:48,149
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

932
01:58:48,350 --> 01:58:51,649
...was your smile
and your little finger...

933
01:58:51,854 --> 01:58:54,585
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,662
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:10,539 --> 01:59:14,408
-I have no idea.
-But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:21,615
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

937
01:59:22,351 --> 01:59:24,479
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:24,686 --> 01:59:25,914
That's that.

939
01:59:27,423 --> 01:59:29,984
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:31,226 --> 01:59:33,717
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:34,596 --> 01:59:37,064
Whatever is left of me....

942
01:59:37,533 --> 01:59:40,400
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:41,237 --> 01:59:43,204
...whatever I am...

944
01:59:43,405 --> 01:59:45,896
...l'm yours.

945
02:00:47,337 --> 02:00:50,328
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

946
02:00:51,073 --> 02:00:52,904
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

947
02:00:53,109 --> 02:00:54,302
Mathis?

948
02:00:54,511 --> 02:00:56,536
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

949
02:00:56,746 --> 02:00:59,180
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

950
02:00:59,748 --> 02:01:01,306
That's how he wiped me out.

951
02:01:01,518 --> 02:01:05,180
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

952
02:01:05,387 --> 02:01:07,582
I can't believe it.

953
02:01:07,789 --> 02:01:09,381
No, neither could I.

954
02:01:09,859 --> 02:01:12,259
I thought he had my back.

955
02:01:12,929 --> 02:01:14,725
But there you go, lesson learned.

956
02:01:16,131 --> 02:01:18,532
Does everyone have a tell?

957
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:22,198
Yes.

958
02:01:25,140 --> 02:01:26,904
Everyone.

959
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:29,140
Everyone except you.

960
02:01:33,615 --> 02:01:35,640
I wonder if that's why I love you.

961
02:01:37,686 --> 02:01:39,621
You love me?

962
02:01:40,155 --> 02:01:42,420
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

963
02:01:42,625 --> 02:01:44,819
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

964
02:01:45,461 --> 02:01:49,521
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

965
02:01:50,432 --> 02:01:51,865
You're serious.

966
02:01:52,835 --> 02:01:54,734
Like you said...

967
02:01:55,305 --> 02:01:57,000
...you do what I do for too long...

968
02:01:57,206 --> 02:02:00,003
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

969
02:02:00,208 --> 02:02:03,076
I'm leaving with
what little I have left.

970
02:02:05,081 --> 02:02:07,173
Is that enough for you?

971
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:53,421
-Come on.
-No. No.

972
02:03:53,922 --> 02:03:57,119
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

973
02:03:57,326 --> 02:03:59,520
What's the time?

974
02:04:01,764 --> 02:04:03,823
How much do we need
to float for a month?

975
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:06,063
I've got plenty.

976
02:04:06,269 --> 02:04:10,204
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

977
02:04:13,141 --> 02:04:15,474
You stopped wearing the necklace.

978
02:04:15,677 --> 02:04:18,841
Yeah. It was time.

979
02:04:19,047 --> 02:04:21,778
Time enough to get over someone?

980
02:04:26,555 --> 02:04:29,922
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

981
02:04:38,634 --> 02:04:40,533
Though apparently not
your employer.

982
02:04:44,974 --> 02:04:48,204
Back in one month.

983
02:04:49,278 --> 02:04:51,677
Come on. I'll get the money...

984
02:04:51,881 --> 02:04:54,042
...you get supplies.

985
02:05:23,712 --> 02:05:26,146
I'll see you back here
in half an hour.

986
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:53,073
-Hello, M.
-I got your note.

987
02:05:53,275 --> 02:05:54,936
<i>Yes?</i>

988
02:05:55,144 --> 02:05:56,975
We'll talk about that later.

989
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:00,171
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

990
02:06:00,382 --> 02:06:02,943
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

991
02:06:06,655 --> 02:06:09,488
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

992
02:06:09,692 --> 02:06:12,990
<i>Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.</i>

993
02:06:13,195 --> 02:06:15,356
So you'll be depositing it today.

994
02:06:15,698 --> 02:06:18,326
On my way to the bank right now.

995
02:06:18,734 --> 02:06:21,430
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

996
02:06:21,904 --> 02:06:23,064
<i>Hello.</i>

997
02:06:23,271 --> 02:06:26,672
Mr. Mendel? I'm having trouble
accessing the funds in my account.

998
02:06:26,876 --> 02:06:28,707
It was transferred
to the account number...

999
02:06:28,911 --> 02:06:31,208
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1000
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:37,251
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1001
02:06:39,956 --> 02:06:41,787
-Where?
-The Venice branch, of course.

1002
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:43,219
St. Mark's Square.

1003
02:06:45,595 --> 02:06:47,289
<i>Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?</i>

1004
02:08:59,996 --> 02:09:01,155
I'll kill her!

1005
02:09:02,163 --> 02:09:03,358
Allow me.

1006
02:13:23,292 --> 02:13:25,260
I'm sorry, James.

1007
02:16:36,918 --> 02:16:39,648
<i>She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.</i>

1008
02:16:39,854 --> 02:16:41,914
<i>They were very much in love.</i>

1009
02:16:42,324 --> 02:16:45,451
<i>He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.</i>

1010
02:16:45,661 --> 02:16:50,620
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1011
02:16:50,833 --> 02:16:52,198
We should've picked up on it...

1012
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:54,630
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1013
02:16:54,836 --> 02:16:56,361
...we forget to watch our friends.

1014
02:16:58,005 --> 02:16:59,870
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1015
02:17:00,209 --> 02:17:02,439
She left her cell phone.

1016
02:17:02,644 --> 02:17:05,010
She must have known I'd check it.

1017
02:17:05,814 --> 02:17:07,975
She knew you were you.

1018
02:17:09,050 --> 02:17:11,281
<i>-Well, at least this clears Mathis.
-No.</i>

1019
02:17:11,486 --> 02:17:13,113
-No?
-No.

1020
02:17:13,322 --> 02:17:15,813
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1021
02:17:16,023 --> 02:17:18,355
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1022
02:17:19,161 --> 02:17:20,924
You don't trust anyone,
do you, James?

1023
02:17:21,129 --> 02:17:22,755
<i>No.</i>

1024
02:17:23,264 --> 02:17:25,529
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1025
02:17:26,334 --> 02:17:28,530
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1026
02:17:29,271 --> 02:17:30,431
Will do.

1027
02:17:32,708 --> 02:17:34,073
If you do need time....

1028
02:17:34,275 --> 02:17:35,538
<i>Why should I need more time?</i>

1029
02:17:36,677 --> 02:17:39,942
The job's done,
and the bitch is dead.

1030
02:17:40,882 --> 02:17:42,680
James...

1031
02:17:43,317 --> 02:17:46,718
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1032
02:17:47,322 --> 02:17:49,016
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1033
02:17:49,224 --> 02:17:53,183
<i>She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.</i>

1034
02:17:53,395 --> 02:17:55,556
<i>I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.</i>

1035
02:17:57,131 --> 02:18:00,123
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1036
02:18:01,236 --> 02:18:04,171
<i>And now we'll never know
who was behind this.</i>

1037
02:18:04,372 --> 02:18:06,933
<i>The trail's gone cold.</i>

1038
02:19:34,462 --> 02:19:36,362
<i>-Hello.
-Mr. White?</i>

1039
02:19:36,565 --> 02:19:38,055
<i>We need to talk.</i>

1040
02:19:38,265 --> 02:19:40,130
Who is this?

1041
02:20:10,432 --> 02:20:12,423
The name's Bond.

1042
02:20:12,634 --> 02:20:14,567
James Bond.
