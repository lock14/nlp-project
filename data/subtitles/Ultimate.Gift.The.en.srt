00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,939
Mr. Hamilton.
Mr. Hamilton.

335
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,525
- [Door Closes]
- Hey.

336
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,694
Mr. Hamilton, sir.
Please.

337
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,741
I think it's only fair I know
the amount of money we're
dealing with here. Don't you?

338
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,743
I've been gone for a month.

339
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,997
Just tell me...
What do I have to do?
What is it?

340
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,041
Red said,
"a series of gifts."

341
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,544
But let me add
a personal note.

342
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,464
I, too, think
this is a waste of time.

343
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,259
But it will end shortly,
because you are going
to fail.

344
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,471
I expect you to fail
and to fail miserably.

345
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,556
Now, if you do want
to continue,

346
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,892
make an appointment
with Miss Hastings.

347
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,772
Okay. Look.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Hamilton.

348
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,275
[Sighs]

349
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,154
I've been acting like a moron
about this whole thing,
and I'm sorry.

350
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,657
And now I... I see exactly
what you and Red
have in store for me,

351
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,784
and I think
it's exceedingly beneficial.

352
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,580
So, what's the next gift?

353
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,250
You'll know.

354
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,757
[Engine Revving]

355
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,978
Howdy.

356
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,399
[Door Closes]

357
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,454
Wait! Wait!

358
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,207
That's an $8,000
paint job!

359
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,334
[Shouts]

360
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,336
[Chuckling]

361
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,964
You don't begin to live
until you've lost
everything.

362
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,508
Heck, I've lost everything
three or four times.

363
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,177
It's the perfect place
to start.

364
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,513
Now, for most
of your adult life,

365
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,890
you have been
the life of the party...

366
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,394
and an easy touch
for a lot of weak
hangers-on.

367
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,146
Now let's see who
your real friends are.

368
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,566
[Device Beeps]

369
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,236
I was at your funeral,
and there wasn't
a single person there...

370
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,615
who wasn't on your payroll
or didn't have something
to gain from your death.

371
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,368
What exactly is he
asking me to do?

372
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,746
He wants you to come back
at the end of the month...

373
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,957
with one true friend.

374
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,967
[Laughing]
Thank you.

375
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,889
- And how were
the lobster tails?
- It was fine, thanks.

376
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,017
The lady was enjoying
the Montrachet.

377
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,357
And sir, the Margaux.

378
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,318
I hope it met
your expectations.

379
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,570
It was terrific.
Thank you.

380
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:59,283
We don't get
too many requests
for the '78.

381
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,202
It's a bit too pricey
for some of our patrons.

382
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,459
I'll just leave this
with you then.

383
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,630
[Sighs]

384
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,258
Caitlin, where do you
see our relationship?

385
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,597
What are you asking me,
Jason Stevens?
Just thinking.

386
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,475
How long have we
been going out?

387
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,311
Uh, an appropriate
amount of time.

388
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,647
Long enough.
See? My thoughts exactly.

389
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:34,360
I was thinking that maybe
it's time to take us...
more seriously.

390
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,195
Yes?

391
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,156
But there's something
I want to ask you first.

392
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,077
Jason, if you're
talking about a prenup,
isn't that sort of passÃ©?

393
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,829
Well, see, I'm in...
I was thinking...

394
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,248
[Clears Throat]
Excuse me, sir.

395
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,834
The charge card company
declined the charge.

396
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,630
That's impossible.
I don't have a credit limit.
Just run it through again.

397
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,175
It's always our practice
to run it through again,

398
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,260
but they declined.

399
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,890
Okay.

400
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,018
So, I was thinking, um,

401
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,272
well, maybe, it'd be a good time
for me to move in with you.

402
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,193
Uh, you move in with me?
Why? Half my wardrobe's
at your penthouse.

403
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:20,114
Just for a change of scenery.
Besides, I'm remodeling
my place.

404
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,826
A remodel? But...
Who's your designer?
I know everyone in town.

405
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,787
I should've said
I'm beginning to remodel.

406
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,623
I've only really started
with the demolition.

407
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,545
I'm sorry, sir.
Your bank is on the line.

408
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,630
They'd really like
to speak with you.
I must insist.

409
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,799
Look, guys. I'm having
a little bit of a setback.

410
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,009
It's nothing
that can't be fixed.
All right?

411
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,888
[Sighs]

412
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,435
[No Audible Dialogue]
Sweetie, I'm switching
accounts right now,

413
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,563
and I'm...
temporarily out of money.

414
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,023
Is there a way
you could pay for this?

415
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,530
[Breath Quavers]

416
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,283
Jason, you're, um...

417
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,911
You're, uh,

418
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,791
asking me
to pay the bill?

419
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,711
- It's...
- [Sniffles]

420
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,844
[Sighs]

421
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,929
â™ªâ™ª [Blues]
You owe me.

422
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,599
[Sputtering]
What?

423
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,018
Yo, dude, I'm rollin' over.

424
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,020
What do you mean
I can't?

425
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,523
I have been there for you
countless times.

426
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,817
You owe me. That's it.
Bottom line.

427
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,153
Who was the one
who loaned you
10 grand last year?

428
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,781
I could come up
with a better excuse
when I was 12 years old.

429
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,909
All I need is a place to sleep.
I don't get what the problem is.

430
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,661
You can let me
spend the night
one night. Hello?

431
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,247
[Man: Recorded Message]
Sorry. Your service
has been disconnected.

432
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,709
Can I help you?
Yeah, shut up.
No. Nothing, thanks.

433
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,337
[Man]
â™ª Thrill is gone â™ª

434
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,883
[Knocking]
â™ª The thrill is gone awayâ™ª

435
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,346
[Gasps]
Jason.

436
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,556
Um... Uh,
what a surprise.

437
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,726
Mom, you're never
gonna believe this.
I'm afraid I can't let you in.

438
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,480
I'm having a bit
of a situation.
I need some help.

439
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:20,484
I need to borrow some money.
Of course you do.
Everyone needs money.

440
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,820
[Clears Throat]
Uh... [Sighs]

441
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,240
Didn't your grandfather
leave you anything?

442
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,575
What are you talking about?
He hated me.

443
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,619
Jason, he did not.

444
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:35,040
He didn't come around much,
but, uh, I always thought
it was because of me.

445
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,251
It doesn't matter.
Do you have any extra
spending cash?

446
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,462
I would love
to help you.

447
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,881
But I can't.
You can't?

448
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,009
They told me specifically
that you would be
comin' around for money...

449
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,053
and that I was not
to give you anything.

450
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,098
But I'm your son, Mom.
That's what you're
supposed to do.

451
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,851
If I violate
their instructions,

452
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:57,271
I am out everything...
everything.

453
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,023
So for the sake
of the greater good,

454
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,526
I must insist
that you leave.

455
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,611
I'm not gonna upset
the whole applecart...

456
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,905
just because you're facing
a few challenges.

457
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,868
I'm sorry. I just
cannot help you.

458
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,245
Thanks.

459
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,139

Ow!

[Can Clattering]

461
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,703
Hey, man. You're...
You're on my bench.

462
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,958
You're on my bench.

463
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,253
Beat it.

464
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,215
A simple "no"
would have sufficed.
Fine. No.

465
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,011
- No, what?
- No, you cannot
sit on this bench.

466
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,263
This is not your bench.
This is a city bench.

467
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,391
Go sit on another bench.
But it's my bench.

468
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,769
I've gotjust as much
right to it as anybody.

469
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,271
- It's a free country, you know.
- [Laughs]

470
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,273
See, that's where
you're wrong.

471
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,651
Name one thing
in this country
that's for free.

472
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,654
You need money for everything.
Without money, you're nothing.

473
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,156
Look at you.
No money. No food.

474
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,200
No family. No friends.
Nothing.

475
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,119
Besides, I'm sitting
on this bench now.

476
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,372
This is my bench.
Okay?

477
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,670
I'll flip you for it.

478
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,713
Fine.

479
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,390
- [Murmurs]
- [Sighs]

480
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,559
I have a quarter.

481
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,980
Thanks.

482
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,822
[Scoffs]
Oh.

483
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,825
Well, aren't you gonna
chase him for it?

484
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,411
Beat it, kid.

485
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,330
I've been watching you.
You're not a real bum.

486
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,959
We saw you at a funeral.
Quite the entrance.

487
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,797
- What were you doing at...
- My mother and I come here
for lunch every day.

488
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,633
Except, right now,
she doesn't know
where I am.

489
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,928
- [Woman In Distance]
Emily!
- [Sighs] Whatever.

490
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,432
Emily!
Oh! Emily.

491
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,060
- You must really
be having a bad life.
- Come on. Right now.

492
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:45,230
I was just having
a pleasant conversation
with this gentleman.

493
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,568
- Leave us alone, please.
- Dear, don't be ridiculous.
Sorry to disturb you. Come on.

494
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,820
That's okay. I'm not the one
who's disturbed.

495
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,864
Some friend you are.

496
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,866
Thanks a lot, poser.

497
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,035
You know what I've said

Well, from what I hear,

524
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,206
he could have another month

any compensation
for this friendship?

Tell Hamilton
I'm good for it.
Just pay that bill.

665
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:29,016
- Your other hundred.
- [Murmurs]

666
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,477
Well, push "Play."

667
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,647
Our lives should be lived
not avoiding problems,

668
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,735
but welcoming them
as challenges
that will strengthen us...

669
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,155
so that we can be
victorious in the future.

670
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,243
So, now that I've given you
the gift of work and friends
and the value of money,

671
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,328
let's discover
the gift of family.

672
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,414
Now this is a tough one,

673
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,833
but see if it's even
remotely possible...

674
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,753
to get something positive
out of our family.

675
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:00,214
See if they truly know
how to count their blessings.

676
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,342
If my doctors
are remotely accurate,

677
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,928
this assignment might even
fall on Thanksgiving.

678
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,514
[Chuckles]
How appropriate.

679
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,642
He's joking, right?

680
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:18,024
[Man On P.A.]
Dr. Allen,
you're wanted in O.B.

681
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,277
Dr. Allen, please report
to Obstetrics.

682
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,447
- Hey, where's the girl?
- Who, Emily?

683
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,491
She's with God.

684
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,709
Oh, there's my best friend.

685
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,880
Listen, about the other day...

686
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,470
So, now you know
all about me.

687
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,432
No more mysteries.

688
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:55,019
Look, I'm really sorry.
Shut up.

689
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,104
Don't be pathetic.

690
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,943
I wonder if he takes
advance orders.

691
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,862
For what?

692
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,490
For my place.

693
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,076
You know, up there.

694
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,037
What do you think
it's gonna be like?

695
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,331
Butterflies.

696
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,583
Lots of butterflies.

697
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,879
Did you know, God...

698
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,882
paints every color
on a butterfly
with his fingers.

699
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,136
I didn't know
you thought about
stuff like that.

700
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:34,016
I think about dying.

701
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,979
There's something
basically unfair
about a person dying.

702
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,732
[Crying]
I even hate the idea.

703
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,407
You know, I, uh...

704
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,450
I don't know much
about God or-

705
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,538
or Jesus.

706
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,624
But I can promise you
that those arms
are meant for you.

707
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,507
What's gonna happen
to my mom?

708
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,759
I really don't hate her,
you know.

709
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,846
[Crying, Sniffling]

710
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,983
[Sniffles]

711
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,152
Did I mention...

712
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,781
I wouldn't be upset
if you kissed her?

713
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,581
Do you think
your mom and I...

714
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,708
Okay. It's official.

715
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,003
You are the slowest person
I have ever met.
[Chuckles]

716
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,797
You two were made
for each other.

717
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,799
I knew that
back in the park.

718
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,428
- In the park,
I looked like a bum.
- Let's not be delusional.

719
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,139
You were a bum.

720
00:48:55,223 --> 00:49:00,353
So, what are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

721
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,235
Mrs. Drummond?
Yes.

722
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,989
I want to send Emily's
charts and blood work
off to a specialist...

723
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,951
see whether or not
she's a candidate
for another transplant.

724
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:20,748
Oh. Uh, will that give her
a better chance than chemo?

725
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:26,212
Unfortunately,
chemotherapy isn't
going to be enough.

726
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,633
I'm sorry.

727
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,635
Thank you.

728
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,142
[Crying]

729
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,083
[No Audible Dialogue]

730
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:22,393
So when I found out
I was pregnant,

731
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:26,397
he was getting ready
to leave for college and, uh,

732
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,774
didn't want anything
to get in his way.

733
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:35,114
And Emily... she's...

734
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:40,286
She's the best decision
I ever made.

735
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,210
So, apparently,

736
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,297
someone came by
and covered my back rent.

737
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:56,218
Was it you?

738
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,137
Thank you.

739
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,432
[Sniffles]

740
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:04,935
I have a question for you,
and I hope I'm not being
out of line here.

741
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,396
I was wondering if you'd like
to join me for Thanksgiving.

742
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,524
Oh. Um, thanks.

743
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,069
That's nice of you to ask,
but I can't.

744
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:17,990
Um, obviously, Emily
needs me here, so...
But thanks.

745
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,076
Well, it's too bad,
because you're missing out...

746
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,746
on a splendid example
of a way-too-wealthy American...

747
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,123
dysfunctional thing.

748
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,584
- It's... Yeah.
- Oh.

749
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:32,129
You know, I have
the strangest feeling
I might have enjoyed it.

750
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,805
What are you
thinking about?

751
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,807
Nothin'.

752
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,684
You're thinking
about Jason.

00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,774
[Clears Throat]

754
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,365
Yeah. He's weird,
isn't he?

755
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,450
He's a good weird.

756
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,162
You know, he,
uh, invited me...

757
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,040
over to Thanksgiving
with his family.

758
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:13,129
Oh, really?
Yeah. Of course, I told him,
"Whatever, loser."

[Both Chuckle]

760
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:19,218
I think you should go.
Absolutely not.

761
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:25,599
I wouldn't dream of missing
Thanksgiving with you.

762
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,688
[Jason]
So why'd
you decide to come?

763
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:35,192
My daughter banished me.
[Chuckles]
Oh.

764
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,528
So I have you by decree.

765
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,156
Mmm, knowing Emily...
by design.

766
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,158
[Nurse]
Mission accomplished.

767
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,410
Two completely
opposite people,

768
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,871
who wouldn't have had
a chance without me,

769
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,498
destined to make
each other miserable.

770
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,007
You okay, Jason?

771
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,427
Oh. Don't tell me
you've never been
on a bus before.

Wow.

Brace yourself.

776
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,199
Jason, seriously.

777
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,994
I'm willing to bet that they are
perfectly normal people.

780
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:50,517
- â™ªâ™ª [Continues]
- This is nice.

781
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,520
Thank you.

782
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:57,691
You know, I had my firm
do an informal audit-

783
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,278
just the financials
of the publicly held side.

784
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:04,490
And there's still
several hundred million
floatin' around.

785
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,993
[Jack]
Well, you knew him
better than I.

786
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,580
Most of those companies
were privately held.

787
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,833
[Bill]
Maybe we should check into
some of his favorite charities.

788
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,836
They do have to report
large contributions.
That's a great idea.

789
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,006
Daddy always was a sucker
for a begging hand.

790
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:25,678
Hmm. Unfortunately,
you're right.

791
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,640
And what sort of business
does your family
come from, Alexia?

792
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:32,601
Um, health care.

793
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,770
Oh, how wonderful.

794
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,356
Well, we have a wing
in the hospital downtown.

795
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,358
A couple of wings, I think.

796
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,360
Or is it
a couple of hospitals?

797
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,862

I always forget.

is receiving great care

Great sector... health care.

Little flat in the third quarter,
but poised to rocket.

Okay. I'd like
to propose a toast.

- [Tapping On Glass]
- [Bill]
Yes. To each other.

803
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,883
For suffering through a year
of great adjustment.

804
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,052
[Jack]
Uh, excuse me.

805
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,388
Does anyone else seem to notice
it smells a little like...

00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,974
[Sniffs]
Cowhide in here?

807
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:17,146
And how are those
sin stocks of yours
doing, Jack?

808
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,357
What's wrong with a little
investment in alcohol,
tobacco and firearms?

809
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:25,696
- Over the stench of oil?
- [Bill] And what's wrong
with oil, thank you very much?

810
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,116
My money's just as
green in Manhattan
as anywhere else.

811
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:36,540
So, who does get
the rest of the estate?

812
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,169
Sarah?

813
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:43,964
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,176
Well, you were
the last one in there.

815
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,971
No, I wasn't.
Well, that's just
ridiculous, darling.

816

When we left, you were
the only one there.

- Ah. Jason.
- [Jack]
Do enlighten us, Jason.

819

You certainly could not
have been the one...

of Red's estate.

821
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:11,450
- [Ruth] Or are you?
- Is that why you insisted we
get together for Thanksgiving...

822
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,828
so you could reveal
your newly enhanced
trust fund to us?

823
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:19,375
It's Thanksgiving.
I was hoping maybe we could
all go around the table...

824
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,919
and each say something
that we're most thankful for.

825
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:27,299
[Others Laughing]

826
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,802

Again?

than anyone here...

with the late,
great Red Stevens.

for your inheritance?

walk away from all that.

The greatest gift
she gave me...

Go ahead, Jason.

1174
01:26:16,754 --> 01:26:19,298
[Jason]
Mr. Hamilton, look. One way
or another, this is over.

1175
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,300
Either I was in South America
way too long,

1176
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:23,844
or I missed the deadline
or whatever,

1177
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:26,597
but what I'm about to do
is way more important.

1178
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:29,099
And I know you have no reason
whatsoever to trust me,

1179
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,936
but I need to borrow
my grandfather's jet.

1180
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:36,857
And I need it now.

1181
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:40,444
I want to take Alexia
and Emily to Gus's ranch
for a late Christmas.

1182
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:43,530
Jason, do you know
what you're doing?
Look, I have no control...

1183
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:47,784
Uh, what, um, Mr. Hamilton
was saying was that, uh,

1184
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:52,664
he'll be sending along
Red's next gift on your
Conversay.

1185
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,875
You have your bags
packed within the hour,

1186
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,920
and, uh, he will
have the jet fueled...

1187
01:26:58,004 --> 01:26:59,922
and ready to go.
[Jason] Thank you.

1188
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:02,925
This means so much to me.
And, Hamilton,

1189
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:06,261
I promise I'm gonna take back
all those nasty thoughts about
you being the Grinch.

1190
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:11,183
Thanks again.
Merry Christmas.
[Exhales]

01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:14,728
[Emily, Jason, Alexia]
â™ª Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the wayâ™ª

1192
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:17,981
â™ª Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh
Heyâ™ªâ™ª

1193
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,983
Hey, Gus!

1194
01:27:22,946 --> 01:27:24,905
What is this?
Snow in Texas?

1195
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:28,700
Had it trucked in.
Ho, ho, ho!

1196
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,955
All right, Hector,
hit it!
[Gasps]

1197
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,083
- [Chuckling]
- [Gasps]

1198
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,710
- Merry Christmas.
- Gus, this is Emily.

1199
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,505
Hi, Emily. Welcome.
Alexia.

1200
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:44,424
Hi.
Alexia,
how ya doin'?

1201
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:46,593
And there he is.
Hey.

1202
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,471
[Chuckles]
I'll get your bags.

1203
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,115
[Alexia]
I see why you chose
this place.

1204
01:28:08,199 --> 01:28:10,200
[Jason]
I wish I could
take the credit.

1205
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,537
Emily said her wish was to go
horseback riding with you.

1206
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:16,665
What?

1207
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:18,959
Emily...
[Crying]

1208
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,044
What? What's wrong?

1209
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,716
She's...

1210
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:29,052
She's terrified of horses.

1211
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:33,056
I'm the one who loves horses.

1212
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,687
[Alexia]
Oh, Jason,
it's so beautiful.

1213
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:40,772
Thank you.
Thank you.

1214
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:05,714
[Gus]
Well, this is what I was
tellin' you about.

1215
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:08,467
Pretty, huh?
[Jason]
It's beautiful.

1216
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:13,055
Hey, come here.
I wanna show you something.

1217
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,140
Gonna be okay, sweetie?

1218
01:29:32,116 --> 01:29:34,034
Alexia,

1219
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:37,788
there's something
I need to do.
What?

1220
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,790
For Emily.

1221
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,006
And now for me.

1222
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,637
And Gus.
[Laughs]

1223
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:00,811
How about that?

1224
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:06,358
[Owl Hooting]

1225
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:18,120
[Sighs]

1226
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:20,205
[Beeps]

1227
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:23,083
When I achieved my dreams,
it was like going home...

1228
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,460
to a place
I'd never been before.

1229
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,504
You don't know that feeling,
do you?

1230
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,216
The first few gifts
I've given you
have been practical.

1231
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:35,262
Show up, do this, do that.

1232
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:39,349
And then the gifts started
needing you to provide input.

1233
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,560
They needed intuition.

1234
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:44,813
Still, your average person
is too weighted down.

1235
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:49,025
Jason, you need to be free,
free to dream.

1236
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:52,946
You need to come up
with a dream, then act on it.

1237
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:57,367
Jason, this is the time
for you to dream.

1238
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,540
[Owl Hooting]

1239
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:07,836
[Jason]
You thinkin'
about butterflies?

1240
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,006
[Emily]
No, Jason,
I'm looking at the stars.

1241
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:15,177
You know,
I set this whole thing up...

1242
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:17,971
because I thought you wanted
to go horseback riding,

1243
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:20,015
not your mom.

1244
01:31:20,099 --> 01:31:23,602
Get real. Horses are
smelly and sweaty.

1245
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:25,562
[Chuckles]

1246
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:30,484
So, sweetie,
what's your dream?

1247
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:33,570
If you could dream
of anything... anything...

1248
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,573
what would your dream be?

1249
01:31:37,783 --> 01:31:40,619
My dream?

1250
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:43,079
My dream was a perfect day.

1251
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,918
And I'm just finishing it.

1252
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:52,422
My dream was to be
with people I love,

1253
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,717
who love each other,
that love me.

1254
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:13,944
What about you, Jason?

1255
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,947
What's your dream?

1256
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:22,786
[Sighs]
I don't know.

1257
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:28,208
For as long as I can remember,
all I wanted to do was have fun.

1258
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,504
Now I don't have a clue.

1259
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,967
It's okay.
Guys are clueless.

1260
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:38,969
[Laughs]

1261
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:41,721
Hey, you have to know this.

1262
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:45,183
Even if you don't
have a dream of your own,

1263
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:47,185
you gave me mine.

1264
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:49,521
That counts
for something.
Mmm.

1265
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:53,191
Of course.

1266
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:02,325
Look at her.
Isn't she beautiful?

1267
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,327
[Chattering]

1268
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:07,163
I mean, except for
her choice in lipstick.

1269
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,165
[Laughs]

1270
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,128
But you have to admit,

1271
01:33:13,212 --> 01:33:16,840
even if you got nothing
else out of the deal but her,

1272
01:33:16,924 --> 01:33:19,301
you'd still be a huge winner.

1273
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:21,386
[Laughing]

1274
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:29,102
Don't blow it. Knowing you,
you're likely to do it.

1275
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,191
[Sighs]

1276
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:37,527
Merry Christmas, Jason.

1277
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,202
Merry Christmas.

1278
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:54,377
Up until now,
I have only existed.

1279
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:57,339
I've, um...

1280
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,675
I've drifted through life
day to day,

1281
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,720
thinking that
that was enough.

1282
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:06,890
And honestly, I don't know
if I have my own dream.

1283
01:34:08,934 --> 01:34:12,562
But I do know I can help
others fulfill theirs. I know it.

1284
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:20,612
Jason, will you excuse us
for a few minutes?

1285
01:34:22,531 --> 01:34:24,532
Hamilton & Partners.

1286
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:28,244
[Elevator Bell Dings]

1287
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:39,881
We've deliberated and evaluated
whether or not your answer...

1288
01:34:39,965 --> 01:34:44,344
conforms with the expressed
desires of Red Stevens,

1289
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:48,390
and we find
that your answer does.

1290
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:53,895
Therefore, we are releasing
an amount allocated
for you at this time.

1291
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:58,024
That is, uh,

1292
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:03,279
$100 million to do with
whatever you please.

1293
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:09,869
All of us here at the firm
want to congratulate you, Jason,

1294
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:11,871
for sticking it out,

1295
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:15,041
putting up with some
very harsh conditions...

1296
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:17,544
and prevailing.

1297
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:19,629
Congratulations, Jason.

1298
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:28,221
So that's it?

1299
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:31,683
[Chuckles]
Yes, I... I think so.

1300
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:34,894
No, don't get me wrong.
It's not the amount.

1301
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,980
It's, uh...

1302
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:41,067
It's just-

1303
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:43,153
I don't know. I was...

1304
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:45,196
expecting a different
feeling or...

1305
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,451
something.

1306
01:35:51,203 --> 01:35:55,498
I think that's
because now you...

1307
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,500
are a different person.

1308
01:35:59,336 --> 01:36:01,963
And, uh...
And, no,

1309
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:04,048
we won't cash
that check for you.

1310
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:07,594
[All Laughing]

1311
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:10,764
Okay, so he is the best
architect in town.
That's great.

1312
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:13,391
Tell him I want
a meeting with him
first thing Monday morning.

1313
01:36:13,476 --> 01:36:16,436
â™ªâ™ª [Woman Singing]
And how much is that?

1314
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,730
I want to tour that property
as soon as possible.

1315
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:23,026
Oh, that's amazing.
We'll have a meeting at the bank
in, let's say, what, a month?

1316
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,528
[Man] That would depend on how
many vehicles you were talking.
[Beeps]

1317
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:28,031
I'm sorry.
Can you hold on?
Certainly.

1318
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:31,367
Yeah?
[Man #2] Mr. Stevens,
a... a young lady to see you.

1319
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,369
Great. Send her up.
Okay.

1320
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:35,622
I'm sorry.
[Man #1]
Will it be a large number of-

1321
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:37,624
Yeah, there are gonna be
plenty of cars.

1322
01:36:37,708 --> 01:36:40,835
Okay, we'll have to
look into it and let you know.
Okay, thank you.

1323
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,921
You're welcome.

1324
01:36:43,923 --> 01:36:45,924
â™ªâ™ª [Continues]
[Sighs]

1325
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:58,520
Oh, I like the remodel.

1326
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:03,024
Where have you been?

1327
01:37:03,108 --> 01:37:05,109
In and out of prison.

1328
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:08,029
Mmm.
Good to hear.

1329
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:11,658
No visible tattoos.

1330
01:37:11,742 --> 01:37:13,868
I missed you.
Hmm.

1331
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:17,914
- What's this?
- Oh, it's nothing.

1332
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,875
That's a nice round number.

1333
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:24,504
Somehow I don't think you'll
be having any more credit card
problems, will you?

1334
01:37:24,588 --> 01:37:27,632
You know, um,
you still owe me a dinner.

1335
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:29,634
How could I ever forget?

1336
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,720
I missed you.

1337
01:37:36,767 --> 01:37:38,768
I think I still
remember my way around.

1338
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,854
Why don't you meet me
in a few minutes?

Ah, Mr. Hamilton, Miss Hastings,
I'm so happy you came.

Please. I insist.

[All Murmuring]

1352
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,718
It's called Emily's Home.

1353
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:57,513
It's for a dozen or more
families experiencing
extraordinary health challenges.

1354
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:02,226
Now, over here
will be the homes.

1355
01:39:02,311 --> 01:39:04,687
They're part of
the same complex,
yet individual dwellings.

1356
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:08,608
Families are gonna
be able to live together
while they face their problems.

Now, obviously, there's
gonna be plenty of parking.

1358
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,572
Over here is gonna be
a state-of-the-art
employment center...

single or married, who need
to earn some sort of income...

What's missing?

1363
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:29,504
Oh, yeah.

If you look at the prospectus
in front of you, page 5.

1367
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:40,556
The total initial outlay
will be $350 million.

1368
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:45,478
Your part will be to underwrite
the financing and a loan
guarantee of 250 million.

1369
01:39:45,562 --> 01:39:48,189
I'm gonna be
putting up the first

Mr. Stevens, this is all well

Excuse me. I'm sorry
for interrupting, but I didn't
phrase this as a question.

1372
01:39:57,616 --> 01:40:01,911
You are gonna do this.
You made this much off my

as mayor of Charlotte,

1388
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:45,283
it is my extreme honor

1389
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:48,870
the ground breaking

01:42:52,749 --> 01:42:58,254
in that the namesake
and the inspiration
for this incredible project...

Of course.

We understand you went
outside the boundaries
of our instructions...

1404
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,857
What?

1405

I'm talking about.

Over the course
of several days,

1409
01:44:38,814 --> 01:44:41,190
this investigator
personally witnessed
and recorded the subject...

1410
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:46,153
as he committed various
misdemeanor infractions
for which he was never cited.

1411
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:52,535
Nevertheless, illegal
activities did occur.

1412
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:56,872
Panhandling,
bordering on assault,

1413
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:04,338
stealing private property,
resale of stolen items,

1414
01:45:08,343 --> 01:45:12,054
street vending
without a permit,

1415
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:14,056
jaywalking.

1416
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:18,644
It is the opinion
of this investigator that
the subject is a reprobate...

1417
01:45:18,729 --> 01:45:22,523
and not capable of completing
the 12 gifts laid out
in Red Stevens's will.

Jason.
Yeah?

1422
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:57,099

the $100 million?
All of it?

1423
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:02,188
Yeah, so what?
Well, if you're
standing here now,

1424
01:46:02,272 --> 01:46:07,401
it means that
not only have you succeeded
in receiving all of my gifts,

1425
01:46:07,486 --> 01:46:10,946
but have done so beyond
the boundaries that I have set.

1426
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:16,285
I guess that means
that I have succeeded as well.

accomplish in life,

1428

01:52:08,304 --> 01:52:10,264
[Exhales]

1503
01:52:10,348 --> 01:52:13,642
â™ª Thank you, Lord
Thank you, Lord â™ª

1504
01:52:17,772 --> 01:52:21,066
Well, you don't begin to live
until you've lost everything.

1505
01:52:21,151 --> 01:52:24,611
Wait! Wait!

1506
01:52:24,696 --> 01:52:28,323
That's an $8,000 paint job!
[Groans]

1507
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:30,576
Heck, I've lost everything
three or four times.

1508
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,911
It's the perfect
place to start.

1509
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:35,289
â™ª Somethin' changed
inside me â™ª

1510
01:52:35,373 --> 01:52:40,669
â™ª Broke wide open
all spilled out â™ªâ™ª

1511
01:52:40,754 --> 01:52:45,132
And Emily... she's...

1512
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:50,387
She's the best decision
I ever made.

1513
01:52:51,473 --> 01:52:54,516
What's gonna
happen to my mom?

1514
01:52:54,601 --> 01:52:56,685
I really don't hate her,
you know.

1515
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,687
[Crying]

1516
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:01,440
[Sniffles]

1517
01:53:01,524 --> 01:53:04,777
[Man]
â™ª If I had a legacy â™ª

1518
01:53:04,861 --> 01:53:06,779
â™ª There's something
I'd like â™ª

1519
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:08,947
[All Laughing]

1520
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:11,533
- Salud.
- Salud.

1521
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:13,452
[All]
ISalud!

1522
01:53:13,536 --> 01:53:15,996
Salud.

1523
01:53:16,998 --> 01:53:20,292
[Laughing]

1524
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:23,879
â™ª Never did I fearâ™ª

1525
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:30,803
Jason, you need to be free,
free to dream.

1526
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:33,889
You need to come up
with a dream, then act on it.

1527
01:53:33,973 --> 01:53:37,184
And honestly, I don't know
if I have my own dream.

1528
01:53:39,187 --> 01:53:41,939
But I do know I can help others
fulfill theirs.

1529
01:53:42,023 --> 01:53:46,610
â™ª A piece of the gifts
you gave to me â™ª

1530
01:53:47,612 --> 01:53:50,322
Uh, I do have to
give away some money.

1531
01:53:50,406 --> 01:53:52,908
You're getting
less mysterious by the minute.

1532
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:57,246
She owes $1,600
in back rent.

1533
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:59,414
Pay it.

1534
01:53:59,499 --> 01:54:01,625
You're a hundred
dollars short.

1535
01:54:01,709 --> 01:54:05,003
Tell Hamilton I'm good for it.
Just pay that bill.

1536
01:54:05,088 --> 01:54:10,384
â™ª This will be
my legacyâ™ª
â™ª Be my legacy â™ª

1537
01:54:11,386 --> 01:54:13,929
So, apparently,

1538
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:17,933
someone came by
and covered my back rent.

1539
01:54:18,935 --> 01:54:20,936
Was it you?

1540
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:24,731
Thank you.

1541
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:28,068
â™ª Much more than
we'll ever know â™ª

1542
01:54:28,152 --> 01:54:31,280
â™ª If you had a legacy â™ª

1543
01:54:32,907 --> 01:54:34,908
What would
your dream be?

1544
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:39,079
My dream?

1545
01:54:39,163 --> 01:54:41,123
My dream was
a perfect day.

1546
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,836
â™ª What are the gifts
you'll leave behind â™ª

1547
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:50,299
And I'm just
finishing it.

1548
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:54,219
â™ª It's right inside
your dreams â™ª

1549
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:59,016
â™ª It's your legacy
It's your legacy â™ª

1550
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:02,269
- I love you, Son.
- I love you too.

1551
01:55:05,398 --> 01:55:07,649
Good-bye, Jason.

1552
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:11,278
[Echoing]
â™ª Your legacy
Your legacy â™ª

1553
01:55:11,362 --> 01:55:15,198
â™ª And it's right inside
your dreams â™ª

1554
01:55:15,283 --> 01:55:18,869
â™ª On the page
you gave to me â™ª

1555
01:55:18,953 --> 01:55:22,539
â™ª It's right inside
your dreams â™ª

1556
01:55:22,624 --> 01:55:26,293
â™ª It's the gift
you gave to me â™ª

1557
01:55:26,377 --> 01:55:30,505
â™ª Your legacy
Your legacy â™ª

1558
01:55:30,590 --> 01:55:33,800
â™ª Your legacy â™ª
â™ª Your legacy â™ª

1559
01:55:33,885 --> 01:55:37,471
â™ª It's right
inside your dreams â™ª

1560
01:55:37,555 --> 01:55:41,350
â™ª It's the gift you
gave to me â™ª

1561
01:55:41,434 --> 01:55:45,145
â™ª It's the gift
you gave to me â™ª

1562
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:48,899
â™ª The gift â™ª
â™ª Your legacy â™ª

1563
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:52,486
â™ª The gift
you gave to me â™ª

1564
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:56,490
â™ª Is your legacy â™ª
â™ª Your legacy â™ªâ™ª
