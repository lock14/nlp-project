I'd rather not.

It's so gorgeous.

Everything smells so fresh
after the storm.

We seem to have escaped
relatively unscathed.

26
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:37,861
Oh, the buddleia's
knocked about a bit, though.

27
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,243
The tide was quite high
last night.

28

Yes.

29

What's that?
Janet, quick, come here.

30
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:57,084
What's that? At the end of the beach.
That black thing?

- I can't see it.
- There ...  there.

33
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,760
I think it's a body.

34
00:04:07,034 --> 00:04:09,298
I'll telephone Pendered.

35

[Ursula]:
Where do you think he's gone?

36
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:15,735
I don't know. Perhaps he's doing
his nets or something.

37
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,902
Did you telephone Dr. Mead?

38
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,810
Yes, of course.

39
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:27,486
[Ursula]:
Do you think he's dead?

40
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:36,653
I suppose the sensible thing
would be to turn him over.

41
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:38,824
Oh, God.

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,061
Oh, Janet, you do it.

He's alive.

44
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:59,149
The tide's low enough
for you to get round the point.

45
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:01,554
See if you can find
Pendered... and Luke.

46
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:03,353
Get them to bring a stretcher.

47
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,485
And ask Mrs. Pendered
for some brandy.

48
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,095
Go on!
He's barely alive!

49
00:05:11,134 --> 00:05:14,592

to find Dr. Mead.

[Man]:
What you got there, missus?

51
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:33,722
I should have thought
that was obvious, Mr. Pendered.

52
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:41,155
[Pendered]: I don't know where he's
come from. Ain't no sign of a wreck.

53
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,927
- You hear anything, Lukey?
- No.

54
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,662
That's enough for now.

55
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,829
[Pendered]:
Get him on the stretcher.

56
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,443
Be careful with that ankle.
I think it's broken.

57
00:05:55,513 --> 00:05:57,814
Lift on three, Lukey.

58
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,609

[Janet]:
Did you send Gallow for Dr. Mead?

60
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:04,385
[Ursula]: Yes, I suggested
he came straight to the house.

61
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:05,423
Good.

62
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:10,126
Good heavens!
What's going on here?

63
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:12,187
Dorcas, we have a visitor.
Is the spare room ready?

64
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:15,427
- I'll do it, Miss Janet.
- This way, Mr. Pendered.

65
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,129
We have to go
straight up the stairs.

You can get out for a start.

68
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:24,801
I was talking to the magpie.

69
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:28,778
- You should've been more polite.
- Oh, get on with it.

70
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,881
He's decent.
You can come in now.

71
00:06:36,757 --> 00:06:40,318
He's obviously exhausted.
That ankle's gonna take some time.

72
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:43,625
Doesn't have much to say
for himself, does he?

73
00:06:43,697 --> 00:06:46,564
Perhaps he doesn't understand.
He doesn't look English.

74
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:50,730
Yes, well, leave him to sleep.
I'll take a look in the morning.

75
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:52,795
I'll see myself out.
- Thank you, Doctor.

Don't keep building up
that fire.

If he doesn't have a fever now,
he soon will have.

78
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:02,976
We'd better leave him. There's nothing
we can do for the moment.

You'll wake him up.

gets up from her nap.

- Is she?

he's gonna need a chamber pot

<i>Wie ist dein name?</i>

182
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:27,773
Marowski. Andrea.

183
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:30,849
Andrea Marowski.

184
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,617
<i>Ja.
[Janet laughs]</i>

185
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,215
<i>[Janet]:
Ich Miss Widdington.</i>

186
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:38,023
<i>Und das ist mein schwester.</i>

187
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:39,562
Ursula.

188
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:40,930
Ursula.

189
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,532
[Cheering]

190
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,038
- Young, see?
- What?

191
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:51,767
Young.

192
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:54,145
He never would've won
if I hadn't had a bad leg.

193
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:57,877
Bad leg? You haven't got
any skill in your fingers.

194
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:01,783
How's your castaway
getting along then, Doctor?

195
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:04,414
Pretty bashed about
a bit, actually, Jon.

196
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,856
God knows where he came from.
Bugger doesn't speak

197
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,325
a word of English.

198
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:10,658
He isn't from around here,
that's for sure.

199
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,858
[Men laughing]

200
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,400
Christ Almighty, Lukey!

201
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:17,402
What the hell's the matter
with thee?

202
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:30,912
[Ursula]: When did Dr. Mead
say he'd be here?

203
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,852
When he's finished his surgery.

204
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,913
So what do people from Poland
have for breakfast?

205
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:38,754
Probably some
awful kind of sausage.

206
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,596
But I'm sure porridge
will do him much more good.

207
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,461
We'll soon find out.

208
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:58,276
Nothing wrong with his appetite.
- Glad to hear it.

209
00:14:58,346 --> 00:15:00,507
Are the sisters of mercy
in attendance?

210
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:02,607
Yes, we are.

211
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:05,517
Good morning, Doctor.
Shall we go up?

212
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:07,145
Morning, Janet.

213
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,416
I'm glad to see that bruise.

214
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,986
Doesn't look very pretty,
but better it's there than not.

215
00:15:15,064 --> 00:15:18,465
Eh, nurse? What's his temperature?
- It's a little over.

216
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:21,196
Make sure he drinks
lots of water.

217
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,898
So, Polish, is he?

218
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,634
It would appear so.

219
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,538
What are you going
to do with him?

220
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,804
What do you mean,
"do with him"?

221
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,746
He can't stay here forever.

222
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:37,809
No. When he's recovered,
that's for him to decide.

223
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:37,579
You look a little flushed, dear.

224
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:39,173
Do I?

225
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:43,920
Perhaps you should
get some fresh air.

226
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:47,083
Well, when it's a little cooler,
I will.

227
00:16:49,628 --> 00:16:52,529
Well, it's time
for my rest, I think.

228
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,594
I'll look in on the patient.

229
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:16,388
Hello.

230
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,057
Hello.

231
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,391
I've had an idea.

232
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,960
Now, look.

233
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:29,959
I say the word,

234
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:33,973
and you repeat it after me.

235
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,838
You understand?

236
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,174
Never mind.
You'll soon catch on.

237
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:40,681
"Chair."
Now you say it.

238
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:42,744
"Chair."

239
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:44,510
Chair.

240
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:47,120
Very good! Very good!

241
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:50,421
"Door."

242
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:52,220
Door.

243
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:54,524
Oh!

244
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:56,325
Uh, "clock."

245
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:59,390
- Clock.
- Yes.

246
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:00,798
"Mirror."

247
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:03,562
- Mirror.
- Very good.

248
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:05,902
"Curtain."

249
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,306
- Curtain.
- Yes!

250
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,242
"Bed."
- Bed.

251
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,750
"Ursula."
[Laughs]

252
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:25,225
Ursula. Me. Ursula.

253
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:26,522
Ursula.

254
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:29,895
[Ursula]: Now I'm going
to take the paper away.

255
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:33,634
- Window.
- Window.

256
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:35,604
Yes! Very good!

257
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:41,478
We're learning English.

258
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:44,014
He might be, Ursula.

259
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,812
You are making holes
in the furniture.

260
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:54,756
[Man on radio]: Another sausage,
and he still owes for the brushes.

261
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:56,157
[Audience laughs]

262
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:59,458
Well, now I'm going to get on
with my little song.

263
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,327
[Laughing]

264
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,731
Excuse me laughing. I know
what's coming but it's awfully good.

265
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:06,292
[Louder]: But I'd like to have done
my dance for you tonight,

266
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,202
[lower]: 'cause my dancing...

267
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,208
- I can hardly hear it.
- I don't want it to disturb Andrea.

268
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,370
Anyway, you don't like Arthur Askey.
- That's beside the point.

269
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,709
"Ghastly little man,"
you call him.

270
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,980
Right.

271
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,816
I might as well go to bed.

272
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,915
You coming?

273
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,221
Not for a minute, no.

274
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:29,727
[Man singing on radio, indistinct]

275
00:19:32,097 --> 00:19:34,224
[Humming]

276
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,232
[Dorcas]:
So you want pilchards, do you?

277
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:42,104
[Janet]: I think so.

278
00:19:42,175 --> 00:19:44,643
We always
used to use coley fish.

279
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:49,080
I'm sure. I think
pilchards would be better.

280
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,242
You gonna make it, are you?

281
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:57,513
All right. What did
he think of my pasties?

282
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,221
He loved them.

283
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,159
Ha! Thought he might.

284
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:04,557
Don't forget the washing.
Looks like rain.

285
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,693
You know...

286
00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:12,535
When Andrea's able to walk,
he's going to need some clothes.

287
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:15,166
Yes, I know.
- I thought I'd use some

288
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:18,575
of the money Aunt Elizabeth left me
to get him a new outfit.

289
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:21,171
Why?

290
00:20:20,248 --> 00:20:21,943
What do you mean, "why"?

291
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:24,247
Why not use our joint account?

292
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:25,718
What?

293
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,982
We're both responsible for him.

294
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:31,389
And I was the one
who saw him first.

295
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:36,230
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

296
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:41,631
Very well.
We'll use the joint account.

297
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:44,570
- Don't be angry with me.
- I'm not angry with you, Ursula.

298
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:46,334
I'm just gonna get the washing.

299
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,808
No, no, I'll do it.
I'll do it!

300
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:06,827
Oh, Ursula.

301
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,461
[Men chattering]

302
00:21:11,535 --> 00:21:13,867
[Dorcas]: Not cheap, is it?

303
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:16,565
[Man]: It is for everyone else.
You can afford it.

304
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,403
It's just as well.

305
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,534
[Men chattering]

306
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:24,944
[Dorcas]: I want some pilchards.

307
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,812
[Man]: No more left.

308
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:29,045
What do you mean,
haven't got any left?

309
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,746
I did have half an hour ago.

310
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,118
What have you done
with it, then?

311
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:33,249
All right. Phyllis has
got 'em up at the shed.

312
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,486
She'd better have.

313
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,229
[Woman]:
What's she want pilchards for?

314
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,962
Stargazey pie.

315
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,970
What's the matter
with coley fish?

316
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,733
She wants pilchards.

317
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:51,140
Can she tell the difference?
[Chuckles]

318
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,237
[Janet]: Andrea seems
a lot brighter.

319
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,283
Why don't you take him up
a cup of tea?

320
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,348
Ursula.

321
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,219
Ursula.
- What?

322
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,522
Don't you think
you're being rather silly?

323
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,391
Silly now, is it?

324
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:13,193
Oh, for goodness sake!

325
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,269
How many?

326
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:42,020
[Janet]: I think we need some more.

327
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,086
Mm-hmm.
[Janet chuckles]

328
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:48,562
It hasn't let up for a minute.

329
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:54,304
I said-
- I heard you.

330
00:22:56,811 --> 00:22:59,177
I think
you should apologize.

331
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,407
What for?

332
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,971
For snapping at me.

333
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,488
Right.

334
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:08,147
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:12,350
I'd call that perfunctory.

336
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:15,225
Ursula.
- You can be so insensitive.

337
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:18,696
On the contrary.

338
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:20,098
<i>Sehr gute?</i>

339
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:22,137
What did you say?

340
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:24,931
Nothing.

341
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:28,408
[Thunder rumbling]

342
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:30,638
Ursula, I'm sorry
if I upset you.

343
00:23:30,712 --> 00:23:32,441
Thank you.

344
00:23:36,252 --> 00:23:38,516
Don't you think
you're behaving rather oddly?

345
00:23:38,588 --> 00:23:41,250
Janet, you've apologized.
I've accepted your apology.

346
00:23:41,324 --> 00:23:43,315
Just leave it at that, please.

347
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:54,696
- All right for you?
- Get out.

348
00:23:58,374 --> 00:24:00,467
Jump in.
You'll get soaked.

349
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:02,408
Oh, bloomin' heck!

350
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:05,038
I knew this was comin'.

351
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:07,176
Oh, what's all this about?

352
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,819
It's for your patient.

353
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:11,548
Ain't my patient.

354
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:13,317
[Dorcas]: Bit of a fog in here.

355
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,588
She were a cracker
40 year ago.

356
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:21,331
Do you think
he's ready for this?

357
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:24,300
If it gets him from the bed
to the chair, it's a start.

358

would be a soldier if he were at home?

by the German government

368

Hello?

1086
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,944
Mr. Pendered?

1087
01:24:27,022 --> 01:24:28,956
It's Janet Widdington.

1088
01:24:29,024 --> 01:24:32,516
Yeah... Hello.

1089
01:24:32,594 --> 01:24:35,028
We're rather worried
about Andrea.

1090
01:24:35,097 --> 01:24:38,589
We were expecting him
for supper, and we-

Well... thank you.

1096
01:25:04,961 --> 01:25:06,792
Janet, what's happened?

1097
01:25:06,863 --> 01:25:08,194
They've gone.

1098
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,799
What do you mean?

1099
01:25:13,169 --> 01:25:14,830
I mean Andrea is gone.

1100
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,139
With that woman.

1101
01:25:19,743 --> 01:25:22,211
I don't understand.

1102
01:25:22,279 --> 01:25:24,179
Andrea...

1103
01:25:24,248 --> 01:25:28,617

getting on the train to London.
