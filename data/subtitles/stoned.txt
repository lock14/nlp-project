1
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,438
Sorry, we were cut off.

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,200
That's right, Rolling Stones.

3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,994
You said the Harper Twins
were snowed in.

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,509
We can take their place.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,678
My name? Brian. Mr. Jones.

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,155
The Stones' manager.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,794
7.30 sound check? Great.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,070
We'll see you then.

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,993
# I am the little red rooster #

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,749
# Too lazy to crow for day #

11
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,071
# I am the little red rooster #

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,160
# Too lazy to crow for day #

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,194
# Keep everything in the farmyard #

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,631
# Upset in every way #

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,754
# Dogs begin to bark and... #

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,114
# Hounds begin to howl #

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,039
# Dogs begin to bark and... #

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,959
# Hounds begin to howl #

19
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,833
# Watch out, strange cat people #

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,394
# Little red rooster's on the prowl #

21
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,673
# If you see my little red rooster #

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,194
# Please drive him home ##

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,390
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

24
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,794
Hold him up! Pull him up!

25
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,833
Brian!
Brian!

26
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,032
Pull him up, for God's sake!
I'm coming!

27
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,118
Help him up, Frank!
Brian!

28
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,794
Brian!

29
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,589
Brian!

30
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,399
Brian, come on!

31
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,353
Oh, my God, Brian!

32
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,238
Come on, Brian! Brian!

33
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,270
Please help me.

34
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,320
Call an ambulance!

35
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,597
Brian!

36
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,351
Oh, my God, Brian!

37
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,589
Brian!

38
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,433
Brian!

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,555
Studio A.

40
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,910
Is Tom there?

41
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,352
Tom Keylock? He went out.
I'll tell him when he gets-

42
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,471
What?
D Oh-oh-oh-oh d

43
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,831
Brian?
D Whoo d

44
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,439
Shit. Really?

45
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,833
Mick? Keith?
Come to the phone. It's urgent.

46
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,229
Brian! No!
Someone, please!

47
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,237
<i>This is the BBC World Service.</i>

48
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,429

51

<i>Mr. Jones' brand of rock 'n' roll,

54
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,435
<i>of the so-called British

55
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,428
<i>Le décès de Brian Jones représente la

56

<i>Il symbolise la débauche et la

60
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,871
Called Tom.

61
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,071
He's on his way down here.

62
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,510
Everything will be all right.

63
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,469
Come on, Frank.

64
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,116
What, you're telling me your missus don't
want you doing building work for Brian Jones?

65
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,275
The thing is, Tom,

66
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,710
she'd just like me
to find a job on a site in London.

67
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,797
I mean, we spent
all that fucking time away at Keith's-

68
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,479
Oi!

69
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,035
Watch the ash on Keith's upholstery.

70
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,356
No, I reckon you should chuck
your bit on the side, mate.

71
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,676
What's her name?
Joan? Put it in the past.

72
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,996
New job, new horizons.

73
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,237
Anyway, working for Brian's not
the same as working for Keith.

74
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,192
You're gonna need a clear head.

75
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,994
I mean, Keith was never there
half the time, was he?

76
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,758
Are you really
The Rolling Stones' manager?

77
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,794
Road manager, love. I don't shove
bits of paper round a desk.

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,434
I look after them. My boys.

79
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,074
Will Keith Richards
mind us being in his house?

80
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,510
Now, why would he give me the keys

81
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,871
if he had a problem with me showing a
beautiful woman round his beautiful house?

82
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,958
Frank?

83
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,991
Why don't you take Joan here
on the tour?

84
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,591
Yeah, come on. I'll show you the room
I'm building for Keith's guitars, eh?

85
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,073
Yeah, you chuck her.

86
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,432
I'm elbowing that Janet. Can't understand
half the words she uses, for a start.

87
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,838
Frank tells me you're a nurse.
I like intelligent birds.

88
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,469
Do you want me
to show you Keith's bedroom?

89
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,671
I thought the others
might have got there first.

90
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,475
Oh, no. Frank wouldn't
do a thing like that.

91
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,275
Trust me, Frank,
there's plenty more fish in the sea.

92
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,033
Actually, I think it's quite nice here.
What with the fire and all that.

93
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,196
Don't you?

94
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,997
You should think of me
as your protector, Janet.

95
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,713
You can always rely on me.

96
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,350
If the missus finds out,
I'll be hung out like a kipper.

97
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,632
But like I said,
new job, new horizons.

98
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,072
Brian wants a lot of work
done on this place.

99
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,918
He only bought it
a couple of months ago.

100
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,553
So the money's
got to be good, then?

101
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,718
You just get your feet
under the table, mate.

102
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,358
D Mm-hm, mm-hm d

103
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,399
d You better come on d

104
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,955
d In my kitchen d

105
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,676
d It's going to be raining outdoors dd

106
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,630
Tom, my man!
I forgot you were coming.

107
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,671
Brian, meet a mate of mine.

108
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,394
Frank Thorogood.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,514
One of the best builders around.

110
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,833
Nice place.
I told you, Frank did Keith's gaff up.

111
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,109
Anyone who's good enough for Keith
is good enough for me.

112
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,834
Oh, I found that camera you lost.
Oh, great.

113
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,157
Don't you two worry about it,
your secret's safe with me.

114
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,158
So, what do you mean, secrets?

115
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,115
It stands to reason, don't it? You
two love-birds alone with a camera.

116
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,232
Did your glasses get all steamed up
looking at the pictures, lover?

117
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,318
Cool it, Anna. He's just
trying to mess with our minds.

118
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,351
Isn't that right, Tom?

119
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,109
I won't charge for the processing.

120
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,757
Fuck it, Tom! There's other girls
apart from her on that film.

121
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,473
Blimey! Oh, dear!

122
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,319
Well, they all look the same to me,
so maybe she won't notice.

123
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,035
Brian, you lying bastard!
You said you were at the studios.

124
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,595
I'm going back to London!

125
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,638
You know, maybe you'd do better off
without her around for a bit, eh?

126
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,592
Be a bit of peace and quiet,
knock off a few tunes.

127
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,030
I don't knock off tunes, Tom.

128
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,913
<i>Parts of it go back
to the Domesday Book, 900 years.</i>

129
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,156
A.A. Milne owned it for a long time.

130
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,309
Christopher Robin,
Winnie-the-Pooh. All written here.

131
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,592
They ran wild in this garden.

132
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,394
So, what do you want doing, then?

133
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,469
Well, I want some lights in the pool

134
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,956
and some beams in the kitchen
so it matches the rest of the house.

135
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,469
There's tons to be done.

136
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,432
I'm having ideas all the time.

137
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,756
Come on, Heffalump.

138
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,837
Fetch!

139
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,712
And the drainage is up the spout.

140
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,109
Well, I can take a look at that.

141
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,833
Oh, I got drunk one night. They're
not as expensive as you might think.

142
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,317
What sort of budget,
then, for the work?

143
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,398
The office can deal with the details.

144
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,239
So, what did Tom tell you about me?

145
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,193
I bet he said I was paranoid.

146
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,879
Right?

147
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,310
<i>No.</i>

148
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,269
Eh, Tom?

149
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,759
I ain't sure about this.

150
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,919
Course you are. You did it
at Keith's gaff. You know the score.

151
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,759
Patience is the name of the game.

152
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,111
You keep Brian happy
and you're in the gravy.

153
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,516
You'll be staying above the garage, weeknights.
Check it out. It's got a bog and everything.

154
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,750
I'll keep the interfering bitch
away for a few days.

155
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,428
Give you time
to settle in with the boys.

156
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,633
<i>Enjoy, my son! Welcome to
The House at Pooh Corner.</i>

157
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,829
<i>Hello, I'm Julian
and this is my friend Sandy.</i>

158
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,076
<i>Oh, it's Mr. Horne!</i>

159
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,748
<i>Oh, how bona to vada your eke!</i>

160
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,994
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

161
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,792
Brian.

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,592
Photographer.

163
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,234
Why can't people leave me alone?

164
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,351
What, you want me to get rid of him?

165
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,918
Oi! What do you think
you're doing, eh?

166
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,838
Sling your hook!

167
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,555
You come round here again,
I'll break your neck!

168
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,837
Well, he's gone.
Do you mind if I use your blower?

169
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,712
<i>He was the strangest man.</i>

170
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,356
Joe?

171
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,710
It's Frank.

172
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,718
I need a cab to Chichester.

173
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,596
Where am I?
You can't go. I mean, Anna's gone.

174
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,670
Well, I'll need to go over there to get
my boys together for the morning.

175
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,998
Sod them all!
I'm not staying here on my own.

176
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,355
You can cook?

177
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,831
I'll call you back.

178
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,113
Got any eggs?

179
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,314
So you were at Keith's?
Yeah, that's right.

180
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,954
He's a cool guy.

181
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,515
I didn't see that much of him,
to be honest with you.

182
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,598
Always travelling
with that girlfriend of his.

183
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,758
Anita.
Yeah, that's the one.

184
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,111
People think I'm a druggie,
but I'm not anymore.

185
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,595
Now I'm just a boozer.

186
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,109
I've had convictions,
you know, Frank.

187
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,471
Yeah, I read about it in the paper.
Yeah.

188
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,750
The lying English press.

189
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,428
They print
the law's version of all that shit.

190
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,837
They even started
trying to plant the dope on me.

191
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,031
That's all behind me now.

192
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,357
Fuck them.

193
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,154
Well, I guess they were
right about one thing.

194
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,396
<i>I was always my own worst enemy.</i>

195
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,672
When your brother gets home, you are to go straight
to your room and do your homework. Is that clear?

196
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,235
Yes, Mum.

197
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,991
And close the door, Barbara.

198
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,913
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

199
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,350
Is it Mary?

200
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,790
Is something wrong?

201
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,033
No, she's a perfectly healthy
14-year-old,

202
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,674
<i>aside from the fact
that she's three months pregnant</i>

203
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,677
<i>and she claims that you're the father.</i>

204
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,075
Brian.

205
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,149
You should be locked away
for this, you bastard!

206
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,473
Couldn't she see a doctor?

207
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,831
I mean, aren't there clinics now?

208
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,879
Oh, you want to become
a murderer, do you?

209
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,548
As well as a molester?

210
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,637
You make me sick.

211
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,999
Look at this filth! This evil filth!

212
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,868
D Every time
I'm walking down the street d

213
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,750
d Some pretty mama
Start breaking down d

214
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,632
d Please stop breaking down dd

215
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,031
<i>All I had was my music.
And then I got the guys together.</i>

216
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,515
Which one of you smart alecs
changed the bloody locks?

217
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,870
Now chuck the keys down right now!

218
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,310
You and your hairy friends
owe three months' rent!

219
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,318
They're out.
No, they're not. I can hear them!

220
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,432
Oh, physically they're here
but astrologically speaking-

221
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,596
Don't give me that codswallop!

222
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,030
Look, when they stop playing
I'll send them over with the dosh.

223
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,356
You mind you do.

224
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,436
Keep playing, lads.
We could be here till Christmas.

225
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,393
You're gonna be big, big, big.

226
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,352
And forget these perky clubs.

227
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,075
I helped Epstein break the Beatles in
the US and I can do the same for you.

228
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,955
You need a proper producer,
a manager, and I'm your man.

229
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,113
As spokesperson for the band,

230
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,757
I can safely say
we don't want to be the Beatles.

231
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,430
When I brought the guys together,
it was for the blues, man.

232
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,279
Lennon and McCartney
write pop songs.

233
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,189
And so should you,
but red-hot and dangerous.

234
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,152
Lose the suits, burn the house down.

235
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,036
Come on, guys. If the Beatles
are Christ, you're the Antichrist.

236
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,432
<i>Andrew was right, we did
become big. Everywhere.</i>

237
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,236
It's just the U.S. Of A that's
the problem. They won't let me in.

238
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,149
Not that I care. It's them, my band.

239
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,191
Mick's organised
yet another American tour

240
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,473
and because of the convictions,
the lawyers say I'm a...

241
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,954
liability.

242
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,794
So you're stuck here, then.
Till the suits sort it out.

243
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,878
Meantime, I think
I'll get legally stoned.

244
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,750
Cheers, Frank.
Cheers, Mr. Jones.

245
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,153
Brian.

246
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,754
Hi, Keith. Yeah, listen, I think I've got
something. Let me just play it to you.

247
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,599
Keith's not here right now.
Call back later.

248
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,313
Nita, is that you?

249
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,794
Anita?

250
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,070
Follow me.

251
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,072
Thank you.

252
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,509
I was watching you on-stage.

253
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,272
You were laughing at the riots.

254
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,069
I'm a bad person.

255
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,430
Then I must be too.

256
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,077
I'm Anita.

257
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,590
I'm Brian.

258
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,154
Everybody knows who you are.

259
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,160
You're not unhappy I kidnapped you?

260
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,998
Feel free to kidnap me any time.

261
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,714
Mick and Keith might not like it

262
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,195
but I'm going to love it.

263
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,710
Anita?
Hm?

264
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,558
<i>Merci.</i>

265
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,233
<i>Livrer sur le D</i>

266
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,908
<i>de Nadie.</i>

267
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,715
Lysergic acid diethylamide.

268
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,989
LSD.

269
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,998
But should you have it?

270
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,310
See the serpent's tongue?

271
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,990
<i>Fais attention. Ne lui
donnes pas trop la première fois.</i>

272
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,953
He thinks you might not like
what you find beyond the door.

273
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,230
But I like the gatekeeper.

274
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,679
What you find beyond the door.

275
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,869
# One pill makes you larger #

276
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,433
# And #

277
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,438
# One pill makes you small #

278
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,111
# And the ones
That Mother gives you #

279
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,632
# Don't do anything at all #

280
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,512
# Go ask Alice #

281
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,591
# When she's 10 feet tall #

282
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,838
# And if you go chasing rabbits #

283
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,749
# And you know you're going to fall ##

284
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,671
Volker. This is my new friend Brian.

285
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,155
It's exciting that
Anita has agreed to act in my film.

286
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,032
To act?

287
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,869
Of course. I would be honoured if
you would consider writing the music.

288
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,356
In my new film
she performs a murder.

289
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,555
Music to murder to? Interesting.

290
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,153
# When men on the chessboard #

291
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,433
# Get up and tell you where to go #

292
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,313
Maybe it isn't planned.
Maybe it's just murder.

293
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,273
# And your mind is moving low #

294
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,109
# Go ask Alice #

295
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,791
# I think she'll know #

296
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,638
# When logic #

297
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,673
# And proportion #

298
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,475
# Have fallen sloppy dead #

299
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,719
# And the White Knight
Is talking backwards #

300
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,516
# And the Red Queen's
"Off with her head!" #

301
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,712
# Remember #

302
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,755
# What the Dormouse said #

303
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,953
# Keep your head #

304
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:32,111
# Keep your head ##

305
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,394
Frank?

306
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,559
I need some female company.
You'll have to drive me up to London.

307
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,716
I can't drive.

308
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,195
Why not? Course you can drive.

309
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,992
I've only got the one eye.

310
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,116
Which one is it?
That's for you to find out, isn't it?

311
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,072
Lost it for king and country.

312
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,109
You're no use as a driver.

313
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,237
I'm not a driver.

314
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,431
I'm a fucking builder.

315
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,353
Brian?

316
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,588
All right. All right, then, cheers.

317
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,154
See you tomorrow, yeah?

318
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,275
# Wouldn't it be nice
To get on with me neighbours? #

319
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,909
# But they make it very clear
They've got no room for ravers #

320
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,357
# They stop me from grooving
They bang on me wall #

321
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,950
# They're doing me crust in
It's no good at all #

322
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,596
# Lazy Sunday afternoon #

323
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,712
# I've got no mind to worry #

324
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,198
# I close my eyes and drift away #

325
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,353
# Aroo de do de do
Aroo de do de di day #

326
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,597
# Lazy Sunday afternoon #

00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,315
# I've got no mind to worry #

328
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,196
# Close my eyes and drift away ##

329
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,509
Frank?

330
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,950
What?
Want to take a gander at this?

331
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,879
Coming.

332
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,792
Boys.

333
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,238
D Can't stop breaking down d

334
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,272
Pour your own.
Cheers.

335
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,709
Can you move it over there?

336
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,069
# I can't walk the streets
Consolidate my mind #

337
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,874
# Some no-good woman
Keeps on breaking down #

338
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,275
It's a brick wall.

339
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,913
It just doesn't feel right.

340
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,429
# Please stop breaking down ##

341
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,435
Where over there?

342
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,355
# You Saturday-night women
You love to ape and clown #

343
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,836
# You won't do nothing but tear
A good man's reputation down #

344
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,349
# Stop breaking down #

345
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,076
# The stuff I got'll bust
Your brains out, baby ##

346
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,236
Hi, Brian.
Great!

347
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,710
Fantastic.

348
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,834
Um, tell Frank
it was in the right place before.

349
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,117
Fucking ponce.

350
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,709
Just ignore the ponce.

351
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,354
We can keep this going all summer
and not even break a sweat.

352
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,393
But he flaunts that bird in our faces!

353
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,479
Just remember to keep your hands
off, otherwise it'll all be over.

354
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,789
When are we gonna
get paid proper, Frank?

355
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,399
I'm sorting it out.

356
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,670
Yeah. Yeah, all right, Frank.
Look, I'll fix it.

357
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,440
Look, I gotta get some money
to Brian's builders.

358
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,790
Can we talk about this, Tom?

359
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,632
Hello? Can I ask you to hold?

360
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,708
Brian's constantly overspending.

361
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,832
The clothes. The travelling.

362
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,957
Just the lifestyle.

363
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,196
Way above the other four.

364
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,676
And then there's the lawyers' fees,
and it's not just the drug bust.

365
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,714
There are five women all claiming
to be the mothers of his children.

366
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,911
The others are gonna have to approve any
more large sums being spent on his house.

367
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,117
Yeah, well, I need cash now.

368
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,314
These boys don't get paid, then what
we've spent so far goes down the toilet.

369
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,070
This is the last payment
without approval.

370
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,948
Brian has no incomings.

371
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,030
He's not touring. He's not writing any songs.
He's not even at the recording sessions anymore.

372
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,232
But it's still his band, though, isn't it?
Is it, Tom?

373
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,279
Well, he thinks so, mate.
He thinks so.

374
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,395
Boys, boys, this song is great.

375
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,398
Just needs a little more work.
Later, man. We're going down the pub.

376
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,878
No, it'll just take half an hour.
We'll see you in the pub, Brian.

377
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,548
See you down there, mate.

378
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,274
I hope you've got some money, then.

379
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,640
I can't do you both
at the same fucking time, can I?

380
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,635
Here we are!
Hey, Tom!

381
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,831
This is nothing,
just the down payment.

382
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,429
So get those down your throats
and this in your pockets.

383
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,393
That's it. Cheers, Tom.

384
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,150
Great.
What you doing?

385
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,834
Tom, I'm the one
who should be paying them.

386
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,474
You're right, Frank.
That's a good point.

387
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,671
Everyone should know their place.

388
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,270
You know, you should've called me
earlier. I'd have come down like a shot.

389
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,519
Pity Brian's not around. Could've had
a word with him about taking the piss.

390
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,518
Yeah, well, we got more done today with
him out of the house than all last week.

391
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,154
What's up here, Tom?

392
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,550
Yeah, you have
a look around, darling.

393
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,115
I thought you was dumping her.

394
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:33,108
I am. This is it.
You know, the big E.

395
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,871
Bring her down here, give her a bit
of excitement, then, "Boof!" Finito.

396
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,150
Well, come on. Tea break's over.

397
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,875
So is Frank taking Brian Jones
for a bit of a ride, then?

398
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,035
What you on about?

399
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,438
It's just that that's what Joan said
Frank was doing at Keith Richards'.

400
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,631
"Skimming off,"
is that the expression?

401
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,400
No.

402
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,239
Frank's as good as gold.
Nah, she's just-

403
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,273
She's just pissed off because he's
giving her the elbow, that's all.

404
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,630
Mm, yes.

405
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,196
A woman scorned
can be a vengeful creature.

406
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,630
Yeah.

407
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,511
Come on.

408
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,549
Who's been sleeping in my bed?

409
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,113
Thank you, Frank.
That's all right.

410
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,832
So are you like Tom,
got these birds on the side?

411
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,749
I got a girl, yeah.
I bet you have, you dirty dog.

412
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,632
What's Tom's woman like?

413
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,434
Janet? Leggy, posh.

414
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,755
Mm, nice. So have you had her?

415
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,598
You must be joking.

416
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,633
Come on, Frank.

417
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,229
Haven't you ever heard of free love?

418
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,151
She's beautiful, isn't she?

419
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,752
Yeah, very.

420
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,468
If you want her, you can have her.

421
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,716
You can.

422
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,032
But Anna only goes with real men,
don't you, honey?

423
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,956
I know.

424
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,677
Why don't you show her your stuff,

425
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,791
some press-ups?

426
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,873
How about starting with 50?

427
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,756
You must be able to do 50.
Even I can do 50.

428
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,270
I'm sure she'll show you
some form of appreciation.

429
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,354
Fifty, eh?

430
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,996
One, two, three, four,

431
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,599
five, six-

432
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,432
I knew you was having me on.

433
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,435
The next 50 will be harder.

434
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,279
I wonder what she'll do then.

435
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,470
All right.

436
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,956
One, two...

437
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,235
There. Fifty.

438
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,152
I'm into brain not brawn.

439
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,276
Come on, let's go up.

440
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,156
Come on, Frank!
We're still mates, aren't we?

441
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,830
I mean, love the beam, man.

442
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:32,911
# Beautiful miracle
Pardon my lyrical rhapsody #

443
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,509
# But can't you see #

444
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,598
# You've captured me #

445
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,994
# Being so glamorous #

446
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,272
# Can't you be amorous
Just with me? #

447
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,835
# Make it soon #

448
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,873
# Take a look at the moon #

449
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,719
What's it like
at this Brian Jones', then?

450
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,354
All right. Swimming pool and all that.

451
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,154
All right for some.
# -around the cornerd

452
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,432
# When I'm around you #

453
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,835
# Let's go cuddle in a corner #

454
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,077
# Any cosy little corner #

455
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,236
# Love is just around the corner #

456
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,396
# And I'm around you ##

457
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,558
Hello?
Frank, it's me. I need you here.

458
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,034
The cover's blown off the cesspit

459
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,471
and if it keeps on raining,
we're going to be engulfed in poo.

460
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,478
Brian, how did you get my number?
Don't get all paranoid on me, Frank.

461
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,434
Only one of us is allowed to be
paranoid. That's the arrangement.

462
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,191
I'm sorry. Look, just get in a cab
and I'll pay for it. Thank you, Frank.

463
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,994
All right, I'm gonna have a bath.

464
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,593
Anna!
I'm in the bath!

465
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,149
Anna? Frank's arrived.

466
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,072
There's no cover on it.
I know.

467
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,998
It's only there.

468
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,236
Shall we put it back on?

469
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,115
Thanks, Frank.
Couldn't have done it without you.

470
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,677
Let's go up to the house. Anna can fix
us some grub and a nice stiff drink.

471
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,791
Carrot juice?

472
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,479
Anyone?

473
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,910
Mm?

474
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,556
Morning.

475
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,518
Thanks.
Good party?

476
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,109
Far-out.

477
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,034
Missed you last night at the studio.
Had the groove down.

478
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,789
Could've been really something.
Like old times.

479
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,594
Get those guitars weaving again
is what we need.

480
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,439
Are you gonna put down
some tracks today?

481
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,958
Can't right now.

482
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,389
Brian, you can't like them
recording without you.

483
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,434
I'm not exactly in love
with the music we're playing now.

484
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,074
Keith can lay down my stuff.

485
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,396
It's really not that difficult.

486
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,276
Brian, you've forgotten
I go to Munich today. The film.

487
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,710
Can't you push it back a bit?

488
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,878
I'd like to, but it's a film.

489
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,676
So you could go to the studio.

490
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,474
Don't tell me what to do!

491
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,154
I can do whatever I bloody well like!

492
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,111
Brian? Brian!

493
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,274
Brian.

494
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,198
Brian!

495
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,756
It's not just his funeral, Keith.

496
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,397
It's ours as well.

497
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,592
Keith, he's right, you know.
It's just another wasted session.

498
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,917
Cat just needs a break, that's all.

499
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,955
Stop!

500
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,749
<i>Und schnitt. Danke.</i>

501
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,518
<i>Sclussklappe.</i>

502
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,199
Okay.

503
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,719
Anita,

504
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,639
<i>jetzt wieder...</i>

505
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,391
<i>Sind Sie fertig, oder?</i>

506
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,068
Brian? Where have you been?

507
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,840
Volker keeps asking.
You got the rushes, yes?

508
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,600
Yeah. Yeah, don't worry, Anita.

509
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,189
I've been working night and day.

510
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,237
<i>Hab immer noch das Drehbuch.</i>

511
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,395
Why are we on holiday

512
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,229
if you have to be finished
with the music in two weeks?

513
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,910
I want to be proud you,
Brian, and you just keep-

514
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,918
I need more time.

515
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,839
What's wrong?
You're a wreck!

516
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,239
I'm going home. I'm telling Volker
to get someone else to do the music.

517
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,993
Don't leave me.
Get out! Look at yourself!

518
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,475
You can't handle the drugs!

519
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,629
We take drugs. We do.
You, me, Keith-

520
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,073
I can handle them, Brian! Keith
can handle them! You, you just-

521
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,477
You just fade away!

522
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,399
You drink too much,
you take too many fucking drugs!

523
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,670
You can't even get it up
without hitting me!

524
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,919
That's what you like.
Not all the time.

525
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,311
You're not leaving.

526
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,670
You're fucking pathetic.

527
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,079
That was wonderful, Brian. Thank you.

528
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,236
Jesus.

529
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,518
Frank! Frank!

530
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,117
Sorry, Brian. Didn't I tell you
I was emptying the pool?

531
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,629
Don't worry about that.
It's the sound, Frank.

532
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,559
Watch that step there.
Come on, I'll show you.

533
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,796
I'm just gonna lower it down.

534
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,114
Right, Frank, start the tape.

535
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,836
Wait, grab this.
Now, why don't you to take this?

536
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,355
Give it a shake.

537
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,994
That's it. Come on, get into it.

538
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,794
Use your hand like this. Like this.

539
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,316
Into the microphone.

540
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,391
Come on! Get into it!

541
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,795
That's it. Feel the music.

542
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,150
Come on, Frank, come on!

543
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,635
That's it!

544
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,950
All right, lads. Knock off.

545
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,311
Nice one, Frank!
What, 3.30?

546
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,830
You coming to the boozer?
Later maybe.

547
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,709
Shit.

548
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,875
Definitely a six, Frank.

549
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,119
What do you think?
Someone's in trouble.

550
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,233
You did restock, didn't you?
Course I bloody did.

551
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,353
You know, you play quite well
for a bloke with one eye.

552
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,869
Have you ever heard of the
blues legend Blind Willie Johnson?

553
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,550
No.
He was a very cool guy.

554
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,070
So your partial blindness
makes you partially cool, Frank.

555
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,272
Thank you, Brian.
I'll go and get the booze, eh?

556
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,628
What are you doing in my room?

557
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,039
Do you know what'd happen to Brian
if the cops found this here?

558
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,595
It's only grass, Frank.

559
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,234
The black bombers are his prescription.
I need to hide them from him.

560
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,273
You don't care about him, do you?

561
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,359
Prison would kill that boy.
What are you now, his babysitter?

562
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,228
I'll keep these from now on, eh?

563
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,912
And this. If I told Brian about this,
he'd chuck you on the spot.

564
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,918
Maybe he'd chuck you, Frank.

565
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,951
He's got you now.

566
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,517
You need to keep in with him to get
your bread. I know what you're doing.

567
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,354
I'm not the hanger-on.

568
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,271
Hello?

569
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,839
Mick and Keith?
They want to come down tomorrow?

570
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,349
Yeah, Brian will be here.

571
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,516
Thank you. Bye.

572
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,230
Do you want to tell him?

573
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,597
If Mick and Keith are coming down tomorrow,
I'll get some more booze in, eh, Brian?

574
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,395
I'll leave you to it, then.

575
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,477
D Paper sun d

576
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,760
d On the run dd

577
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,759
Loved your movie, Anita.

578
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,511
Brian's music was amazing. But I'm
not so sure about my performance.

579
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,836
You were wonderful, darling.

580
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,714
What do you see?
Clouds look like big fucking rats.

581
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,469
Need their arses blown off.

582
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,075
Somebody give me a gun.

583
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,952
We're changing. It's like we're part
of some experiment.

584
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,957
Like something amazing's
going to come from it.

585
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,869
I'm going somewhere, that's for sure.

586
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,719
I'm going to hell, Brian.

587
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,273
Race you.

588
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,709
Don't you feel her power?

589
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,592
You want to fuck her!

590
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,360
Oh, shut up!
Man-

591
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,028
Fucking hell, Brian.

592
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,800
And you want to fuck him.

593
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,477
I know that. I've seen the way
you've been looking at each other.

594
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,433
I'm telling you, I don't care.

595
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,717
I honestly don't care.

596
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,710
Brian, this is stupid, man.
Keith! I love you, man.

597
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,951
I want you to have a good time.

598
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,392
This is our party.
This is just part of the experiment.

599
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,797
We can do whatever we want.

600
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,910
I don't want him, damn it.

601
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,309
If you want to fuck Keith-

602
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,875
What are you doing?

603
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,196
Don't be so bourgeois.

604
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,392
Besides, I'm ordering you.

605
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,518
Gysin, where's the dealer?
The Eggman?

606
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,996
In bed, asleep?

607
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,152
Gysin, can you get me some coke?

608
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,192
No.

609
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,755
LSD, MDT,

610
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,030
hashish,

611
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,394
psilocybin.

612
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,316
I suppose that'll have to do.

613
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,229
Why don't you go
and look for Anita, Brian?

614
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,839
Anita can take care of herself.

615
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,678
Tom, get the car!

616
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,756
Brian?

617
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,677
What's going on?

618
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,633
This is just part of the experiment.

619
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,791
What are you doing?
You know what I'm doing.

620
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,754
I don't want to! I don't want to.
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

621
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,235
Get off. Get off!

622
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,829
Aaahh! Please!

623
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,237
You experiment with Keith?
You made me! No!

624
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,512
Experiment with me!

625
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,752
Stop!

626
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,679
Stop!

627
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,549
Hello?

628
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,594
<i>Look, I've been ringing and
fucking ringing. What's going on?</i>

629
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,234
Nothing. It's- It's all coming together.

630
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,591
<i>You want to talk to Brian?
No, I don't want to talk to Brian.</i>

631
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,678
Your missus has been calling my missus.
You've not been home for three weeks.

632
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,713
<i>What's happening, Frank?
Nothing!</i>

633
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,037
I just had a lot of work
on my plate, that's all.

634
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,117
Yeah, well, just so you know,

635
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,630
I'll be back to take care of things
after everything goes khaki, all right?

636
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,190
He missed a bit.

637
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,916
Where's the arsehole?

638
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,873
Tom?

639
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,230
Get us out of here.
Fuck.

640
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,155
She kept fucking him.

641
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,033
I don't know about anything, but
Joan's gonna take you to the airport.

642
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,629
Come on, Anita. Come on, come on.

643
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,113
Come on, Tom!
Just put your foot down.

644
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,509
Don't touch the car!

645
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,439
What do you mean, we've checked
out? "We" is standing right here!

646
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,029
Where are the others?
Gone.

647
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,959
Gone? What, disappeared?

648
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,310
Just like that?

649
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,035
Did they leave a message?
No, sir, just this.

650
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,116
What's this?

651
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,073
I'm not paying the fucking bill.

652
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,311
# With your pencil in your hand #

653
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,476
# You see somebody naked #

654
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,116
# And you say, "Who is that man?" #

655
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,990
# You try so hard #

656
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,988
# But you don't understand #

657
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,637
# Just what you'll say
When you get home #

658
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,036
# 'Cause you know
Something is happening #

659
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:44,869
# But you don't know what it is #

660
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,719
# Do you #

661
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,434
# Mr. Jones? #

662
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,631
# Your raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?" #

663
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,234
# Somebody points to you
And says, "It's his" #

664
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:12,553
# You say, "What's mine?" #

665
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:15,638
# And somebody else says
"Where what is?" #

666
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,071
# And you say, "Oh, my God!
Am I here alone?" #

667
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,272
Hi, guys. Great to see you. Come in.

668
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,756
# 'Cause you know
Something is happening here #

669
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,555
# But you don't know what it is #

670
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:35,629
# Do you, Mr. Jones? ##

671
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,999
So. You fellas don't make it
down here very often.

672
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,077
Looks like a nice one.

673
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,793
Hey.

674
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,117
You got some live Hendrix. Cool.

675
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,880
Yeah. He sent one over.

676
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,273
Look, Brian, we've got this tour.

677
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,110
Even if the lawyers can get you into
the States, you're never at the studio.

678
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,392
We need a guitarist
who knows the new material.

679
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,555
Mm.

680
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,433
And we- I mean, you're not...

681
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,551
You're out, cock.

682
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,352
You're fired.

683
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:27,955
What we thought,
what the management figured out,

684
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,750
you'll get 100 grand now, and 20
for every year the band keeps going.

685
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,791
Sure.

686
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:42,430
Come and see us
at the studio, you know?

687
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,234
So long, mate.

688
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,833
You'll get your act together, man.

689
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,677
# I'm gonna tell you
How it's gonna be #

690
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,031
# You're gonna give your love to me #

691
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,952
# I'm gonna love you night and day #

692
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,828
# Well, love is love
And not fade away #

693
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,237
# Well, love is love
And not fade away #

694
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,432
# My love is bigger than a Cadillac #

695
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,318
# I'll try to show it
When you drive me back #

696
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,830
# Your love for me
Has got to be real #

697
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,191
# Want you to know just how I feel #

698
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,313
# Love is real, not fade away #

699
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,510
# Love is real, not fade away #

700
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,919
# Yeah #

701
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,119
# Oh, love is love
Don't fade away d

702
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,034
# Love is love
Don't fade away #

703
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,479
# Love is love
Don't fade away #

704
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,036
# Love is love
Don't fade away #

705
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,554
# Love is love
Don't fade away ##

706
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,398
Brian, what happened?
Nita?

707
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,269
You've got my pills, haven't you?
Anna told me.

708
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,836
I need one.

709
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,349
I don't think you need
anything else, Brian.

710
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,757
Frank, they're my prescription.
I need them.

711
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,110
I don't think you need-
I need them.

712
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,270
Do you want any, Frank?
No.

713
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,549
Frank?

714
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,036
Come on.

715
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,475
Can't you do something, Frank?
What?

716
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:10,719
He needs your help. I thought
you were supposed to be in control.

717
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,434
Now, then, Keylock's here.

718
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,078
Oi, Brian! Oi, oi, oi! Come on.

719
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,554
What are you doing, mate?

720
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,598
Just clearing out the crap.

721
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,430
Yeah, well, you don't want
to destroy this stuff, eh?

722
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,596
It could be worth a fortune.

723
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,915
Sure.

724
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,556
When are you getting
your new band set up, eh?

725
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,513
You know, there was
a call from Hendrix at the office.

726
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,310
He's a cool cat.

727
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,590
We've been talking
about getting it together.

728
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,075
He called?
I'll take over.

729
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,431
I can handle that.

730
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,996
Get that down you.

731
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:21,911
I'm out of the band, Tom.
I know, son.

732
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,429
But it's for the best.

733
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,519
Oi.

734
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,999
You don't need that.

735
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,475
What the fuck happened?

736
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,468
I don't know. He got hold
of something, went fucking crazy.

737
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,796
It's been like a madhouse down here.

738
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,913
Yeah, well, don't worry about it.
Maybe I should get Janet down.

739
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,115
Thought you'd given her the big E.

740
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,231
I'm just thinking
that we might need a nurse,

741
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,271
what with Brian going all loose.

742
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,072
Shame she wasn't here this morning.
Oi!

743
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,717
Hey, Frank, you stick to this kind
in the future, all right?

744
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:24,433
When you gonna get
your hair cut, Frank?

745
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,110
It's only been a few days.

746
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,880
It's just the drugs
are leaving your system, you know.

747
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,638
I still feel terrible.

748
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,991
# Good morning
The world is bright #

749
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,668
# And you sit tight
And you'll be right... ##

750
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,632
<i>And here's more sensational news.</i>

751
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,319
<i>After months of speculation,</i>

752
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:28,310
<i>Brian Jones, founder member of The Rolling
Stones, said he is to quit the group.</i>

753
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,590
<i>In an official statement today
he said-</i>

754
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,078
<i>I no longer see eye to eye with the
others over the disks we are cutting.</i>

755
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,316
<i>We no longer communicate musically.</i>

756
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,592
<i>The Stones' music
is not to my taste anymore.</i>

757
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,759
<i>I have a desire to play my own brand
of music rather than that of others,</i>

758
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,952
<i>no matter how much
I appreciate the musical concept.</i>

759
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,310
<i>The only solution
is to go our separate ways,</i>

760
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,796
<i>but we shall still remain friends.
I love those fellows.</i>

761
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,991
What do you think?

762
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,589
You look beautiful.

763
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,591
I am Sir Brian, king of the castle.

764
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,679
Sir Brian was meant
to write his music in paradise,

765
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,598
not a building site.

766
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,870
So you gonna get rid of them, then?

767
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,958
I've got to fire someone
I didn't even hire in the first place.

768
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,789
Yeah. It'll be just you and me.

769
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,912
Just us? Never.

770
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,473
# The man I love #

771
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,549
# I took from my best friend #

772
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,269
# Some joker got lucky #

773
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,992
# And stole him back again ##

774
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,751
Brian?

775
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,913
Brian!
Fucking ponce has locked us out!

776
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,634
What do you reckon I'd get for this?

777
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,355
You wouldn't know too much about money,
would you? Or we'd have seen some.

778
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,917
What about those guitars in there?
Must be worth a bit.

779
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:20,955
They wouldn't notice if you nicked
one. If you had the balls, that is.

780
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,071
You're just a fucking brickie.
What do you know about anything?

781
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,792
I'm coming!

782
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,392
<i>Hello?</i>

783
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,352
Tom? It's Frank.

784
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,710
<i>Frank, I'm just on my way out
so call me later, yeah?</i>

785
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,230
No, it's getting messy down here now.
The boys want paying.

786
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,714
Yeah, well, maybe I'll get down there,
maybe I won't, all right?

787
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,195
Well, maybe you should.

788
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,630
Tom, I'm owed.

789
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:00,678
All right. Go down the Stones' office this afternoon
and whatever Brian owes you will be waiting for you.

790
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,438
Thanks, Tom.

791
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,397
It's been touted as a free concert

792
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,673
but really it's a way of introducing
the new boy who's replacing Brian.

793
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,872
Yeah, Mick Taylor.
He's quite gorgeous, actually.

794
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,993
Look, I'm gonna have to go. Yeah.

795
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,358
Hiya. Is Tom Keylock around at all?

796
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,836
You're Mr. Thorogood?
Yeah, that's right.

797
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:37,715
He left this for you.
Good.

798
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,630
I ain't having that.
There ain't enough money there.

799
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,957
And there's a mistake. It says "full
and final payment for all services. "

800
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,355
There's no mistake.

801
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,630
Mr. Jones isn't happy with your work.

802
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,829
And quite frankly,

803
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:01,477
The Rolling Stones are no longer
willing to finance your shenanigans.

804
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:03,830
Until Mr. Jones
opens a separate account,

805
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,190
that's all you're getting from us.

806
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,153
Good day, Mr. Thorogood.

807
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,317
You ain't firing me.
There's 8 grand still owing.

808
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,476
You ain't getting away with it.

809
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,110
All good things
come to an end, Frank.

810
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,392
Don't worry, you'll get your money.
That's why you have to go.

811
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,670
It's built up too much.

812
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,319
I don't want the work completed.

813
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,353
For chrissakes,
don't you want the fucking job done?

814
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,109
I've done all this work.
I could still finish it.

815
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,392
I need space. I need peace.

816
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,114
I've got my own work to do now.

817
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,356
I thought it was agreed.

818
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,558
Oh, so that's it, then?

819
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,878
Look, you're good company,
you're fun to wind up.

820
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,479
But you're...

821
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,591
a fucking terrible builder.

822
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,477
Yeah.

823
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,358
Well, I ain't going nowhere
till I get my money.

824
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,438
Well, I'm going...

825
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,835
swimming.

826
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,749
Get the door, would you?
And what's for supper, Frank?

827
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,633
Tom?

828
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:00,319
The door was open.
Are you okay, Frank?

829
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,711
Things will work out, Frank. Let's
just try and have a lovely evening.

830
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,911
Yeah.

831
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,714
Let's have a lovely evening, eh?

832
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,274
We're not hungry.

833
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,439
All right, Anna.
You might change your mind, eh?

834
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,072
Ungrateful cow.

835
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,031
No fucking manners.

836
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:19,834
So, what now?

837
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,713
I go back home,
see what work's around.

838
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,911
Had enough of this gaff anyway.
Mm.

839
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,953
Stonesville. A very strange place.

840
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,639
Yeah.

841
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,118
This is nice.
Can't quite place the seasoning.

842
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,751
Parsley.

843
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,599
Have you spoken to Tom?
I called him today.

844
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,189
He ain't coming down here.

845
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,109
Told me he don't want
nothing more to do with you.

846
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,880
He let me down today and all.

847
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,071
That's Tom all over, isn't it?

848
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,636
That's his trouble, just not reliable.

849
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,510
Come on.

850
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,792
I want to get smashed tonight.
Last night and all.

851
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,468
I'm not really a vodka drinker.
Come on.

852
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,672
Put a little lemonade with it, eh?

853
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,035
Cheers.

854
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,032
Strong?
Mm-hm!

855
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,196
Oh. Oh, Tom.

856
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,960
I knew you'd come.

857
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,989
Frank! Stop it!

858
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,115
Frank, get off!

859
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,560
A touch more Jane than Tarzan,
I'm afraid, Frank.

860
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,558
So says the ponce with a girl's barnet.

861
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,239
Ha-ha, very droll.

862
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,115
Come on. Don't tell me you wouldn't
like to look like me, be like me.

863
01:22:56,320 --> 01:23:00,871
What, look like you? You're a freak.
There's only one freak in this pool.

864
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,631
Piss off, you poof.
Ho-ho!

865
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,631
That's stupid. You're acting like kids.

866
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,912
You've both had enough.
Come on, Brian.

867
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,592
Well, you sure can pick them.

868
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,554
Oh? Well, who should I pick,
Frank? You?

869
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:24,990
Do you want to replace Anna?

870
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,112
Why don't you piss off, eh?
I'm not a poof like you.

871
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:37,795
Come on, Frank.
You swing both ways, don't you?

872
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,394
Maybe you, me and Anna
should have a threesome.

873
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,238
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.

874
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,793
I think you should get out.

875
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,152
Honestly, I'm fine. Could you grab
my inhaler? It's in the music room.

876
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,874
Okay. I'll be right back.

877
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,828
Ha-ha-ha!
Like it underwater, do you?

878
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,270
Fuck off, you arsehole!
Arsehole? Who you calling arsehole?

879
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,156
Arsehole!

880
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,914
Where do you think you're going, eh?

881
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,790
Quite strong for a ponce, ain't you?

882
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,278
It's a fucking joke! Never serious.
I'll get you!

883
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,278
Don't you laugh at me,
Brian-sodding-Jones.

884
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,590
Mate.

885
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,871
Tom?

886
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,036
Tom?

887
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,790
There.

888
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,630
I need a towel.

889
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,076
Brian, I-

890
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,873
Brian?

891
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,516
Brian?

892
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,749
Brian!

893
01:26:57,960 --> 01:27:00,315
Oh, fuck! Brian!

894
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,435
Brian!

895
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,232
Brian!

896
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,431
Frank! Frank!

897
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,915
Frank!

898
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,877
<i>Ja, men det var jättelänge sen.</i>

899
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,070
Anna? Will you
come down here, please, now?

900
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,795
Get off the phone. This is a private-
Now, please. It's Brian.

901
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,672
Get off the phone.
This is a private call.

902
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,836
I can't swim, Anna.

903
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,232
Brian?

904
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,789
Oh, my God!

905
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,275
Damn it, get help!

906
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,393
# Well, I followed him #

907
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,355
# To the station #

908
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:35,432
# With a suitcase in my hand ##

909
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,596
Oh, my God!

910
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,518
Tell us again what happened,
in your own words.

911
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,597
I told you. I saw Brian.

912
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:47,031
He was lying facedown at the bottom
of the deep end of the pool.

913
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,595
<i>Janet and I jumped in
and after a struggle, we got him out.</i>

914
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:54,032
<i>And that's your sworn statement,
is it, Mr. Thorogood?</i>

915
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,716
# Well, it's hard to tell #

916
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,549
# It's hard to tell #

917
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:10,472
# When all your love is in vain ##

918
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,155
Cops held you a while.

919
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:21,148
Yeah, well, they just hammered me
with the same questions.

920
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,555
"What was he drinking?"
"Was he on drugs?"

921
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,513
Yeah, well, pop star dies like that,
drug squad got a result, haven't they?

922
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,551
Did my name come up?

923
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,153
Nah.

924
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,271
Janet?

925
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,789
Said she was a friend of mine.

926
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,516
Well, sometimes you've got to lie,
haven't you? For everyone's sake.

927
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,631
Tom-
You were supposed to look after him.

928
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,479
What the fucking hell happened here?

929
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:49,188
It's been building for months,
hasn't it?

930
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,868
You've let yourself go.
Look at the state of you.

931
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:04,115
What are you doing?
Brian's stuff, isn't it?

932
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,356
I don't want kids ransacking the place

933
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,677
and I don't want Plod finding any
drugs he might've hidden in his clobber.

934
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:13,918
I look after my boy.

935
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:18,193
He was trouble to me alive
and he's trouble to me dead.

936
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,634
You're well out of it, sacked.
Now look what I've got to do.

937
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,799
I gotta get a statement, I gotta get that
Swedish bint on a plane out of here.

938
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,879
<i>Supposed to be with the lads. They're
recording Top of the Pops today.</i>

939
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,839
And then there's you.

940
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,071
I'll cover your arse
because it's my arse too.

941
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:50,478
Your stupid games
could've ruined both of us, Frank.

942
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,114
I don't want to know the truth!

943
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:58,115
We both know it was
your fucking fault either way.

944
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,234
Come on, you give me a hand.

945
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,315
# And all my love #

946
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:18,473
# Is in vain #

947
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:34,512
# Oh, oh, yeah ##

948
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,040
Without Brian Jones
they're finished as a rock band.

949
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:02,312
I mean, in the next 12 months.
You mark my words.

950
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,751
No, they'll do all right without Brian.

951
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,991
We all will.

952
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,190
Tom, my man.

953
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:39,108
Look at them all.

954
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,395
Isn't it fabulous?

955
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,917
Thanks for making a martyr of me.

956
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,156
If it wasn't for you, I'd still be alive

957
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,432
and no one would care.

958
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,110
You know that isn't true.

959
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,749
It was you screwing
with Frank's head what did it.

960
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:07,195
Because you had nothing better
to do. Because you didn't have her.

961
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,832
Nita.

962
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,949
<i>Just had to go and
screw it up, didn't you?</i>

963
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:24,555
Your problem is,
you were never happy.

964
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,751
Even Frank was happy.

965
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:30,510
You're wrong, you know, Tom.

966
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:34,235
I was happy
somewhere in the middle there.

967
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,234
But the thing with happiness was...

968
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,559
it was boring.

969
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,273
# Time #

970
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,596
# Is on my side #

971
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,916
# Yes, it is #

972
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,111
# Time #

973
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,550
# Is on my side #

974
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,752
# Yes, it is #

975
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:14,952
# Now, you always say #

976
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,913
# That you wanna be free #

977
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,511
# You'll come running back #

978
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,039
# Just like I hoped you would, baby #

979
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,798
# You'll come running back #

980
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,718
# I won't have to cry no more #

981
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,797
# You'll come running back #

982
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,069
# Uh-huh #

983
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,556
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

984
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,796
# Time #

985
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,389
# Is on my side #

986
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,830
# Yes, it is, yeah #

987
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,679
# Time #

988
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,836
# Is on my side #

989
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,473
# Uh-huh #

990
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:47,635
# I know that #

991
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:50,308
# You're searching for good times #

992
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:54,154
# But just wait and see #

993
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,920
# You'll come running back #

994
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,432
# Well, I can't #

995
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,596
# Get the devil #

996
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,791
# Outside of me #

997
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,036
# Outside of me #

998
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,151
# No, I can't #

999
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,112
# Get the devil #

1000
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,038
# Outside of me #

1001
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,310
# Outside of me #

1002
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,397
# But I hate the world #

1003
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,431
# And everything I see #

1004
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:37,471
# Everything I see #

1005
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,875
# Everything I see #

1006
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,752
# And I'll never #

1007
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,791
# Get the devil #

1008
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,991
# Outside of me #

1009
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,555
# Outside of me #

1010
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,996
# But I hate the world #

1011
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,077
# And everything I see #

1012
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,157
# Everything I see #

1013
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,271
# Everything I see #

1014
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,516
# I know the meaning of the word #

1015
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,517
# When it came to me #

1016
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,676
# When it came to me #

1017
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:17,711
# When it came to me #

1018
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,036
# I don't live #

1019
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,276
# I just breathe #

1020
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,993
# I don't give #

1021
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,475
# And I don't receive #

1022
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,511
# And I'll never #

1023
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,438
# Get the devil #

1024
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:32,312
# Outside of me #

1025
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,909
# Outside of me #

1026
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,715
# Well, I don't get #

1027
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,558
# All the good things #

1028
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,591
# You said I'd see #

1029
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:21,030
# You said I'd see #

1030
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,151
# And I don't #

1031
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:24,998
# See the light #

1032
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,156
# Surrounding me #

1033
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,191
# Surrounding me #

1034
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,516
# But I see lovers #

1035
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,517
# Walking free #
