1
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:34,015
Shh! Shh!

2
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:19,751
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

3
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:27,425
This is our last home game, people.

4
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,298
And I don't understand
what the problem is.

5
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,371
Look at the person next to you.

6
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,468
Do it!

7
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:41,574
Look at the person behind you.

8
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:47,349
I don't think we need the smiles.
Thank you.

9
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:51,221
Now we're all part of a formation.
Every pers...

10
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,223
Every person matters.

11
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:59,726
Every step is an anticipation of the next.

12
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,691
If you don't think you have a complete
concept of what we're trying to do...

13
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,271
...then we should just pack up
and go home right now.

14
00:03:08,507 --> 00:03:10,600
And I mean it.

15
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:18,881
But if you want to attempt to explore
the physical, musical possibilities...

16
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,455
...of making something substantial,
then we focus, and concentrate...

17
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:28,320
...but you have to wanna do it.

18
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,154
You have to want it deep inside you.

19
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:34,127
Do you have a sledgehammer
in your heart?

20
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,733
Because I have a sledgehammer
in my heart.

21
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:39,097
I found it when I was your age.

22
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:41,296
And I lived in that future.

23
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:44,374
Are you ready to live into that future?

24
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:48,138
Are you ready to be my sledgehammer?

25
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,322
Eighty-six the fried rice.

26
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,761
Whoo! I can see your underpants.

27
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,031
I'll be with you in just a minute, all right?
Is everything okay?

28
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,370
Barb! Barb! Barb!

29
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:55,706
Barb, what...? Barb, what this is?

30
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,871
Shh. Keep it down.
- What is it?

31
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,483
<i>It's moo goo gai pan. It's Chinese.
Can't you read...?</i>

32
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,517
- That's what this is for.
- Buy more pens.

33
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,655
- I can write it down.
- No lipstick, please.

34
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:07,257
- That's all I had at the time, sorry.
- Barb, listen.

35
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:10,519
- Next time, you do it right, otherwise...
- All right, fine.

36
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,858
- Don't argue with me, please.
- I'm not arguing. I didn't have a pen.

37
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:17,229
- Let's go to kitchen, come on.
- I'm not supposed to be working today.

38
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,563
Let's not argue in front of the customers.

39
00:05:19,738 --> 00:05:22,263
Save me, Annie.
- Let's go, come on.

40
00:05:25,176 --> 00:05:26,700
Shit.

41
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:35,413
- Sorry. I didn't even see it.
- Careful.

42
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:37,077
You okay?

43
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,018
It's bleeding.

44
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:44,253
You working tomorrow?
- I gotta work a frigging double.

45
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,397
Oskar's making me come in
and do inventory.

46
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:49,761
I gotta count wontons or something.
It's all for talking shit to him.

47
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,300
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

48
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,512
Arthur, what are you doing?

49
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,913
Just finishing taking out the garbage
and stuff.

50
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:12,789
- I found 20 bucks.
- Do you need a ride?

51
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:15,653
I don't know.
My mom is supposed to pick me up.

52
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:17,920
Come on, it's cold. Get in.

53
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,859
Okay.

54
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:25,997
How are your parents?

55
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,101
They're okay.

56
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,001
Has the neighborhood changed much?

57
00:06:34,212 --> 00:06:37,841
A little, but not really. Nothing major.

58
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,142
What about that girlfriend of yours
in the house with all that poison ivy?

59
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,845
- No, she wasn't my girlfriend.
- Whatever.

60
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:47,958
There was never any point where l...
I've never had a girlfriend.

61
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:50,924
You guys got married. We had a ceremony.
I married you guys.

62
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:53,997
When? That doesn't... It was like a joke.
It was... We were 5.

63
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,929
It's real, it's binding. We got cups.

64
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,797
No.

65
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:05,003
She divorced me, she took everything.

66
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,636
That sucks.

67
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:28,554
- Yeah?
- Sweetheart, I didn't hear you come in.

68
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,224
- I didn't realize it was so late.
- Yeah.

69
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:36,133
How'd you get home?
Was I supposed to come get you?

70
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,135
- Annie gave me a ride.
- Oh.

71
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:40,334
Really? How's she doing?

72
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:42,139
She's okay.

73
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:44,306
How's her mom doing? Did you ask?

74
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,074
I didn't ask.

75
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:53,289
Yeah.

76
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:58,061
You okay?

77
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:01,390
Tomorrow's gonna be hard.

78
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,103
- Good night.
- Good night, Mom.

79
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:08,762
I love you.

80
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,875
Love you.

81
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,667
Now that you've made
a complete mess of the house...

82
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,971
...well, I suppose it's time for a cigarette.

83
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:53,847
I'm not happy, Lou.

84
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:55,042
I'm just not happy.

85
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,744
You know what, Don?

86
00:08:56,921 --> 00:08:59,719
This is your decision.
These are choices you're making.

87
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:04,954
I just don't know
how I'm expected to be...

88
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:09,463
...a good husband and father if I'm,
you know, if I'm just half here.

89
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:12,865
I don't wanna hear any more
of your bullshit excuses.

90
00:09:13,037 --> 00:09:15,938
Get your things,
and be out of this house by morning.

91
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:33,788
Oh, you gotta be kidding. Gross.

92
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,450
Hey listen, you've got time to give me a...
Well, look at you.

93
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:39,358
What, you got another job interview?

94
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,795
No. Yesterday I got a spot
working for Rafe.

95
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:43,866
I think I'm gonna spend the day
with Tara.

96
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:47,163
You were gonna give me a hand
getting your stuff from the attic.

97
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,067
Oh, yeah. No, I don't have time, Dad.

98
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,504
I thought we'd get our picture taken
at the mall.

99
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,102
What? Me and you?

100
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,769
No, me and Tara.
I'm late, I gotta pick her up.

101
00:09:55,947 --> 00:09:58,541
What are you doing with Rafe?

102
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:02,152
I start tomorrow,
at the carpet warehouse.

103
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,222
It's not my dream job or anything.
I'm doing some consulting.

104
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,519
Why don't you talk to Spider
about that real estate development?

105
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,389
I think you'd be a natural in sales.

106
00:10:11,563 --> 00:10:13,656
Or you know what?
Joe Dunham could use a hand.

107
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,891
I was talking to him about ethics
and ethnic labor.

108
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:20,060
Dad, where's my comb?
Have you seen my comb?

109
00:10:25,677 --> 00:10:27,042
Ah!

110
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,140
Where the hell's my comb?

111
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:31,214
How are you doing for money?

112
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,816
I'm okay. I'm okay.

113
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:37,682
I thought maybe you could take Tara
out for a little treat, on her grandparents.

114
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:39,345
Where's my comb, Mom?

115
00:10:39,524 --> 00:10:41,754
There's your toothbrush in the sink.

116
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,829
- Here. Here you go.
- Thanks.

117
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:48,693
- How's the tie?
- It looks fine.

118
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,959
Too short? Too long?
- It's all right.

119
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,569
You see the stuffed rabbit
I got her? It's incredible.

120
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:55,706
Where are you taking her?
- Marsden Pond.

121
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,171
Maybe out to the mall.
The picture people are there.

122
00:10:58,343 --> 00:11:01,073
I think it'd be nice to get
some wallet size for you guys.

123
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,806
I always get nervous when those
people try to take my picture. I don't know.

124
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,974
It'll be nice. You look nice.

125
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:08,982
I'm gonna be late.
Annie's gonna be mad.

126
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:11,121
Tell her hello for us.

127
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:12,614
I will.

128
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,226
We love you no matter what your job is.
You've always got a room here.

129
00:11:16,394 --> 00:11:21,331
I love you guys. I love you, grandpa.
Lay off that apple jack. Come on, Bomber.

130
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:28,596
- I don't know what else to do.
- Nothing, he's not a child.

131
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:31,699
You forgot the rabbit.

132
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,244
Morning, Arthur.
- Morning.

133
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:46,684
Okay, I'm off.

134
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:50,654
I'm not gonna have a phone put in
till Monday.

135
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:57,090
If you need to get in touch with me
you just call me at the school, okay?

136
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,232
All right.

137
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:02,863
- Is there a football game tonight?
- No.

138
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,872
No? You don't have a show?

139
00:12:05,043 --> 00:12:07,011
- Next week's the game.
- Oh.

140
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,771
You wanna help your dad with his bags?

141
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,078
Yes.

142
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:21,083
- Dad, you need a hand?
- Yeah, I'd love it.

143
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,492
You know this has nothing to do
with you, right?

144
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,931
Right? It's not like you're not gonna
see me anymore.

145
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,593
It's...

146
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,398
I'll be right nearby in the campus.

147
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:40,636
In this new apartment complex,
it's really nice. It's a little small...

148
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:43,175
...but it's nice.

149
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:46,973
So call me anytime.

150
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:48,379
Thanks.

151
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:52,580
All right. Well, have fun.

152
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:56,591
- Come on, I'll drive you to school.
- No. I'll walk, I'm fine.

153
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,695
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

154
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:01,559
All right. Well, you better hurry,
you don't wanna be late.

155
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:04,759
Arthur, your trombone.

156
00:13:06,604 --> 00:13:08,071
This is it, dude.

157
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:09,968
Yeah.

158
00:13:15,747 --> 00:13:17,237
Okay.

159
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:35,895
The rabbit, man. I forgot the rabbit.

160
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:39,899
Damn it. Damn it!

161
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,802
Ah!

162
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,923
Hey, Glenn. Sorry, we've all
been sick, I've been sleeping on the couch.

163
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:04,425
Oh, yeah? Camping out?

164
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,063
Tara! Your daddy's here!
- Are you feeling better?

165
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,393
I would have brought some chicken soup.

166
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:16,399
- How are your folks?
- Oh, you know...

167
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:18,235
...sick of me staying with them.

168
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,343
At least my dad is.

169
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:21,876
- How's your mom?
- Good.

170
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,708
Good, good. Good.

171
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:26,610
Tara!

172
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,719
Where's that little booger?
Hey. Hey, baby.

173
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,755
Come on, cool overalls.

174
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:37,292
Yeah. Who made those overalls?

175
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:41,056
- My mommy.
- Mommy? Hey, sweet. High-five.

176
00:14:41,232 --> 00:14:43,427
All right. Good going, Mommy.

177
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,660
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

178
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,965
I got some... I'm a little muddy.
I got some on your carpet.

179
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,664
And you got some on your pants.

180
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:54,339
Hey, where would you like to go today
with your old dad?

181
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:56,480
Would you like to have
your picture taken?

182
00:14:56,647 --> 00:15:01,209
- I'm finishing my picture.
- Okay. Where would you like to go?

183
00:15:01,385 --> 00:15:04,183
- Marsden Pond? You love the pond.
- No!

184
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,255
- Here, come on, let's go.
- She's cranky...

185
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:09,018
...because of her ear infection.
- No.

186
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:12,720
All right, I'm just gonna
take a little breather here.

187
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:15,661
Come on, pumpkin.
Go have fun with Daddy, okay?

188
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,929
You can take Stinky Bear.
All right, I'll see you later. Love you.

189
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,273
Pudgy Bear, sit down right there.

190
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:29,811
Yeah.

191
00:15:29,981 --> 00:15:31,539
You been doing okay?

192
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:34,583
Yeah, I'm good. I'm, you know, sure.
I'm perfect.

193
00:15:34,752 --> 00:15:37,016
Okay, well, just make sure
she's buckled in there.

194
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,053
Yeah. Hey, let's buckle you in. Come on.

195
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:42,989
Buckle myself in.
- You wanna bring her home around 5:00?

196
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,529
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I still got a key,
so if you're not here I'll just...

197
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:51,532
Oh, well, you know, actually we had
the locks changed a few weeks ago.

198
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,069
- So your key probably won't work.
- Who's "we"?

199
00:15:56,574 --> 00:15:58,132
Me.

200
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,036
I did.

201
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:02,075
Okay. Cool beans.

202
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,506
- Hey, say goodbye. Goodbye. Okay.
- See you later. Love you. Bye.

203
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:10,814
See you later. Let's go.
Oh, my goodness. Snoring.

204
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:15,391
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

205
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,426
How's that? Is that better?
Now it's not so bright, huh?

206
00:16:18,596 --> 00:16:23,033
- No.
- You look like a helicopter pilot, in Vietnam.

207
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,864
You look like that... You look, you know,
you look like Tom Cruise.

208
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,063
Thanks.

209
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,177
If Tom Cruise was a little girly-girly,
he would look like you.

210
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:39,409
A little girly?
But now he's a big boy.

211
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,050
He is a big boy.

212
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,516
<i>There's a lot of junk food
on this list, Mom.</i>

213
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:46,122
Doctors don't tell you to watch
that for no reason.

214
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,589
All the food in the fridge tastes like shit.

215
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:54,694
This should be enough money
to cover a few substitute meals.

216
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,425
If it isn't, you can get rid of the cookies.

217
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,899
I like them in the afternoon
with my coffee.

218
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:04,508
Especially this time of year,
but I don't absolutely have to have them.

219
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:06,500
Ditch the cookies.

220
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,042
When will you be back?

221
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:09,804
I got a bunch of errands.

222
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,449
- How's Glenn?
- Fine.

223
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:15,744
- Say hello to him for me.
- I do, Mom, all the time.

224
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,547
You know what I wish?

225
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,349
Mom, forget it.

226
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:22,458
I just wish the two of you were happy.
That's all I'm gonna say.

227
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,287
I'm leaving.

228
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,191
I love you.

229
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:32,092
It's just bullshit.
Every corner looks the same now.

230
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:35,170
Every city is becoming
one beige strip-mall.

231
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,773
Nobody cares about choices or character...

232
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:40,069
Hey, Arthur.
- Hi.

233
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:44,681
- Tell Lila to calm down.
- I'm just freaked out.

234
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:47,409
Lily told me they're putting
fast food in the cafeteria.

235
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:50,418
- That makes me wanna throw up.
- Yeah, that's...

236
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:53,113
That's kind of... I hate throw-up.

237
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:59,321
I like your shoes.

238
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:01,089
What's wrong with them?

239
00:18:09,774 --> 00:18:12,299
Dude, I gotta tell you
about what went down last night.

240
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:14,802
It was crazy.

241
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:17,607
- What?
- I can't tell you here.

242
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:19,844
Too many kids, remind me later.

243
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,552
Okay.

244
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,617
So, your dad move out today?

245
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:26,222
Yeah.

246
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:30,523
- Swipe any of his pornos before he left?
- Only the Chinese one.

247
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,026
I don't know why.
It's not like I'm gonna watch it.

248
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,131
<i>You didn't take
The Vagina Threat.</i>

249
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,927
<i>That's not what it's called,
it's called Triple Pussy...</i>

250
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:41,663
Whatever. Okay, okay. That's disgusting.

251
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,999
I gotta take a dump.

252
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,966
Fuck.

253
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,343
Now, what's up with those two sluts
that are obsessed with you?

254
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:53,074
They're Lila and Lily.
They transferred from B.H. Best...

255
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,741
- Do you think he's cute?
- B.T. Best.

256
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,218
- A couple weeks ago. Sisters.
- Can you say that in Spanish?

257
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:03,991
Arthur?
- Yeah.

258
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,229
Hey.

259
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,567
You like that?

260
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,802
What do you think of daddy's belt?

261
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:53,034
That's a very big belly.

262
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,772
Yeah, that's when Daddy used to drink
that beer. That's nasty.

263
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,142
Ugh!
- Ugh.

264
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:02,410
- I don't like beer.
- I don't like it anymore either.

265
00:20:02,586 --> 00:20:03,610
Mommy...

266
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,052
You tell your mommy,
Daddy's not drinking beer anymore.

267
00:20:07,224 --> 00:20:10,819
You have great teeth.
Show me more of them.

268
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:13,555
- Show me your cheese mouth.
- Look at my teeth.

269
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:16,859
Don't you want that...?
That's Daddy's dingle berry. Don't do that.

270
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:19,092
You two make a lovely family.

271
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,205
- Can you take care of this blemish I have?
- I can take it off.

272
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,204
- Don't worry.
- I want this to be perfect.

273
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,104
- Come on, Tara.
- Smile, please.

274
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:29,769
Oh, God, in the name of Jesus Christ,
bless this food we are about to eat...

275
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:34,179
...so that we may ask
that all our actions and intentions...

276
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:37,479
...be directed to your praise and spirit,
Father God, Lord God...

277
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,680
...and our own good, Father God.

278
00:20:39,857 --> 00:20:43,190
And the good of those with whom
we come in contact.

279
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:47,794
We love you, Father God.
We magnify you, Jesus.

280
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:50,399
Blessed is he who comes
in the name of the Lord.

281
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:51,660
You peeking?

282
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,429
Hosanna in the highest. High-five!

283
00:20:56,106 --> 00:20:57,835
Did you change your shampoo?

284
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,374
Mm-hm.
- Why?

285
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,708
- You don't like it?
- No, I thought we talked about this.

286
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,051
- I like it.
- Good.

287
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,119
I like it.

288
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,887
How's Barb?

289
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:17,920
Come again?

290
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:19,820
How's it going with you and Barb?

291
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:21,521
Catch the ball.

292
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:25,963
Can we just not talk about Barb? I'd like
to not think about my wife right now.

293
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:27,603
Okay. I'm sorry.

294
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:29,329
How'd he get rolled?

295
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:33,638
It's been really nice, I don't know why
I always have to over-analyze everything.

296
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:35,870
Because you're like...

297
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,811
- I don't know what it is, you just gotta...
- Just more for you.

298
00:21:39,984 --> 00:21:41,679
It's the journey.

299
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,944
- You know the old saying?
- No.

300
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:46,180
"Yesterday's history,
tomorrow's a mystery...

301
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:49,520
...today is a gift,
that's why they call it the present."

302
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,521
And, yes, I read that on a pamphlet.

303
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,991
What are these underpants?

304
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,361
What do you think of the bowling balls
in the marble bag?

305
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:04,772
Arthur. Hey, look. The signs are true.

306
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:06,933
Smell. What do you think it smells like?

307
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,305
- Paint.
- Yeah.

308
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,579
Don't wash it off.
You could keep it as perfume.

309
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,047
Oh, yeah?

310
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:16,186
What class are you heading to?

311
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:17,581
Photography.

312
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,986
I signed up to take yearbook photos
as an art credit.

313
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:23,752
I gotta get my camera fixed, though.
What about you?

314
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:27,929
Um, history.

315
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:35,631
Who's that guy that was talking about me
in Spanish class?

316
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:37,797
That's just Warren.

317
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:40,833
He's a shitty kisser, man.

318
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,103
And I'm just kidding.
It's not like I know.

319
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:48,642
Yeah, sure.

320
00:22:49,887 --> 00:22:51,787
I think he's a weirdo.

321
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,726
Here.

322
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,119
- What's this?
- It's a pencil.

323
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,561
Present. Here.

324
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,968
In case you need to write anything down
in geography class.

325
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,401
It's photography.

326
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:13,065
Or chew something,
write something down, erase something.

327
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:17,578
You never know.

328
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:25,649
Rafe, how you doing? Hey, man.
- Mate. Good to see you.

329
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,724
I just wanted to come by,
Tara's in the truck, I gotta split...

330
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:30,951
...but I wanted to tell you I'm
super pumped.

331
00:23:31,128 --> 00:23:34,063
- I wanna know what time you want me.
- Eight a.m. I was reading...

332
00:23:34,231 --> 00:23:36,756
Eight a. m? I'll be here quarter to eight.
I'm pumped.

333
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:40,529
I was reading some Matthew today.
This is about the parable of the lost sheep.

334
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:42,171
- Really?
- Yep. And you know what?

335
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,864
- It reminded me a little of you, mate.
- Oh, yeah, well.

336
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:48,170
Lost to the fold, you know?
Because this is what Christ said, right?

337
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,905
You're lost to the fold,
but you've got to understand...

338
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:52,776
...the Lord is always with you.

339
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:55,316
I feel the Holy Spirit
coming through me right now.

340
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,454
- That's what He's saying.
- I'm telling you.

341
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,112
He's saying you can be lost,
but you can be found.

342
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,317
I feel like it. It's happening right now.
Tara's waiting for me in the truck...

343
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,565
How was the market?

344
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:12,133
Crowded.

345
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:18,105
You never lose that smell, do you?
Nasty cigarettes.

346
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:20,243
Mom, do you have bread?

347
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,839
You didn't put it on the list,
I would have gotten it.

348
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:26,505
It's all right.

349
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:28,880
- Did you eat?
- Nope.

350
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:32,715
- Mom, you gotta eat.
- I eat. I eat all the time.

351
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,085
Mom, come home with me.
I'll make you something.

352
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:37,386
You can watch Tara there.
I'll drive you home.

353
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:40,655
I like her to sleep in her own bed
once in a while.

354
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:42,890
I don't want to leave in this cold.

355
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,227
Yes, you do. Come on.

356
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:50,702
Daddy stepped in the doggy doo-doo.

357
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,532
Yeah, it's not that funny.

358
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,234
Don't push me.

359
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,607
- You don't wanna be pushed?
- Don't push me. No.

360
00:24:57,781 --> 00:24:59,942
- What do you want?
- Mommy.

361
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:05,449
Okay, just take, here, just take it,
take it easy. We're gonna find Mommy.

362
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:08,750
We're gonna find Mommy. Pudgy bear.

363
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:11,486
Pudgy, pudgy bear.
- Pudgy, pudgy bear.

364
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:14,187
Pudgy-wudgy b...
- You're a Pudgy-wudgy-wudgy bear.

365
00:25:14,364 --> 00:25:15,922
Pudgy-pudgy-pudgy bear.

366
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:27,935
Okay, you knock.

367
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,703
Go ahead.

368
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:32,245
Yeah, there you go.

369
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,078
You kids came in the back.
So cold out there.

370
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:39,018
We went for a walk down
by the pond. Saw the ducks. It was fun.

371
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,893
- Little Miss Independence.
- It's good to see you here, May.

372
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:48,964
Your wife kidnapped me.
Thinks I'm starving to death.

373
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,963
- She must be blind.
- What does she know?

374
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,227
- I was wondering...
- What is this all over her?

375
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:56,566
Oh, that's just some banana.
I think she wandered off and...

376
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,708
What do you mean "she wandered off"?

377
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:03,142
Well, I was talking to Rafe and I told her
to stay by in the truck with Bomber.

378
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,476
Bomber's your dog, Glenn.

379
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:09,176
Tara's not a dog, she's a child.
You don't just leave your kid in the car.

380
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:13,420
Annie, you gotta go to work.

381
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,922
We're eating early.
Making tuna noodle casserole.

382
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:18,084
There's extra if you'd like to stay, Glenn.

383
00:26:19,463 --> 00:26:22,364
Yeah. No, I...

384
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,629
Yeah.

385
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:29,470
Arthur, it's Saturday night.

386
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,904
You gotta quit this job
before you get sucked in.

387
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:34,976
- You should enjoy high school.
- Oh, no, work is fun.

388
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:36,442
No, it's not.

389
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:39,480
Shouldn't you be out on a date
or something?

390
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:43,319
- Should I?
- Well, I thought you'd have a girlfriend.

391
00:26:43,487 --> 00:26:46,479
Oh, yeah?
- Oh, you know, you're cute.

392
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:48,488
Glad you think so.

393
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:52,023
Don't give me that.
Haven't the girls caught on yet?

394
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:01,596
Ever tell your mom about that time
you busted me on the counter with Glenn?

395
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:05,538
- When you were supposed to be in bed.
- That was awesome.

396
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,402
I was like, "What are you guys doing?"

397
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:12,906
I totally used to give you baths.

398
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,985
We had some good times
though, right?

399
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:20,589
For the most part.

400
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,520
Sometimes you were a little obnoxious.

401
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,325
- I'm sorry.
- It's too late.

402
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:28,989
No more bedtime stories?

403
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,259
Nuh-uh. You're on your own.

404
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:33,995
Oh, my God, I am waiting on
the cutest family of dwarfs.

405
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:36,537
- That sucks.
- I just wanna take them home.

406
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:40,734
Oh, boy. Am I interrupting
an intimate, tender moment?

407
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,606
No. We were just talking.

408
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:44,974
Is that medieval birthday party
still out there?

409
00:27:45,148 --> 00:27:48,845
Yeah, gosh, I hate watching fake wizards
and barbarian nerds eat Chinese food.

410
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:52,011
It's so disgusting. Oh, my God,
you better get a haircut.

411
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:54,680
Or no one's gonna wanna adopt your ass.

412
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:57,884
Not even Fannie's Annie over there,
you know what I'm saying?

413
00:27:58,061 --> 00:28:00,154
Two and two's 22, you know?

414
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,490
Did she get you?

415
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,524
Hey, Glenn's here.

416
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,263
God.

417
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:14,633
- Oh my God, you were looking at her ass.
- No, I wasn't.

418
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,711
You were.
You were checking her ass out.

419
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,643
It's fine. I'm not gonna tell her.

420
00:28:18,815 --> 00:28:22,251
Look it, Annie is hot.
She's really hot, man.

421
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,116
Wish she wasn't having so many problems,
you know what I'm saying?

422
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,952
I was driving by,
and I thought I'd say hello.

423
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:35,258
- I'm working.
- Cool, I know. I just...

424
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:39,061
I just, I was wondering if you wanted
to go out and get dinner.

425
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:40,627
Glenn, I'm working.

426
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:45,002
Well, you know, me too.
Yeah. I got a new job.

427
00:28:45,175 --> 00:28:47,939
- You got a job?
- Yeah, I wanted to tell you about it.

428
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:52,138
That's kind of why I thought
we should go out. To celebrate.

429
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:58,378
Not tonight, no, not now,
but like tomorrow night, or sometime.

430
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:02,489
Just dinner. I think there's some things
we should talk about.

431
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,719
- Like what?
- You know...

432
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:12,628
I don't wanna talk about it here,
with this guy, Rob or whatever.

433
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:14,464
Wait, so you got a job?

434
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:16,105
- Yeah.
- I mean, are you working?

435
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:21,370
It's not like Rafe just hooked you up
at the carpet warehouse or something?

436
00:29:21,545 --> 00:29:24,139
Well, actually, yeah.

437
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:27,912
You know, it's not amazing,
Annie, but I'm trying, you know?

438
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:30,053
It's temporary. We'll see what I can get...

439
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,714
I know. I'm sorry. I ju...
I didn't mean it that way.

440
00:29:35,092 --> 00:29:36,457
I'm really happy for you.

441
00:29:36,626 --> 00:29:39,254
Yeah, I can tell it's a thrill.

442
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:41,830
You're having a real party.

443
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:47,969
You know, my mom blames me
for our separation.

444
00:29:48,138 --> 00:29:52,632
You know, I'm not as much of a screw-up
as you think I am.

445
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:55,334
You used to love that little dance I'd do.

446
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:58,208
Yeah, things changed, Glenn, a little bit.

447
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,609
Yeah. Well, you know...

448
00:29:59,783 --> 00:30:03,685
Hey, why don't you tell me all about
all those amazing changes...

449
00:30:03,854 --> 00:30:07,153
...tomorrow night or sometime,
over some spaghetti and meatballs?

450
00:30:07,324 --> 00:30:10,816
Glenn, you win, whatever.

451
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:12,552
You call that a kick? Come on.

452
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:48,696
<i>I really like the pencil that you gave me.</i>

453
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:50,423
Isn't it cool?

454
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,761
It's a wonderful gift.

455
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:57,134
What's that mean?

456
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:59,798
Importance of fungus.

457
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:05,278
Important in the ecosystem
as decomposers.

458
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:15,119
"Feel like a rock star. Have fun. Travel."

459
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,884
Nope.

460
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:19,761
"Compassionate, energetic, creative."

461
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,158
No.

462
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:24,266
These are good.
These are good for children.

463
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:27,699
You got a lot of durability here
with the...

464
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:33,241
A lot more fiber density in your Berbers.
And, it depends, what are you looking for?

465
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,174
Something more plush, not the Berber.

466
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:38,906
Okay. Do you have any children?
Or anything else, or...

467
00:31:39,082 --> 00:31:40,674
- Furry, furry children.
- Say again?

468
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:43,012
- Furry children.
- Furry children.

469
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:45,279
So you got a hamster, guinea pig?

470
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:48,447
- Four dogs.
- Four dogs? Whoa.

471
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:54,359
How about sort of a beige, greenish,
sort of semi-Berber...

472
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:57,364
...semi-plush? What about that?
Your dog can bounce around...

473
00:31:57,534 --> 00:32:01,163
...but you can be comfortable. Now,
you got a dog pooping around on that...

474
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,966
...you're gonna be fine.
But I think with the...

475
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,769
We're looking more for leakage
than the other.

476
00:32:07,944 --> 00:32:12,176
I see what you're saying.
Yeah, yeah, well, you say leakage?

477
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,648
Are you all Christians? No?

478
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,352
Christians?

479
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:19,846
This is a slang dictionary?
Yeah.

480
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:23,720
Let's look up "blowjob." Here it is.

481
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:26,954
"Fellatio, fellator, or fellatrix."

482
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,757
Fellatrix, I like that.

483
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:30,797
- Or, "An unpleasant..."
- Shh.

484
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,765
Wait. She was looking.

485
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:37,202
It can also be
"an unpleasant experience or a situation."

486
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,467
- I beg to differ.
- I don't think so.

487
00:32:39,643 --> 00:32:43,704
I very much beg to differ on that one.

488
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:26,453
Is that what you're wearing?
- It's not a date, Mom.

489
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,854
I'd think you'd be happy for him.
He finally got a job.

490
00:33:30,026 --> 00:33:32,824
Oh, big deal.
I have a job, and I take care of Tara.

491
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,520
Just be nice this once.

492
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:38,156
I'm always nice. It's just enough trouble
trying to navigate my own life...

493
00:33:38,335 --> 00:33:42,294
...without worrying if poor fragile Glenn's
gonna try and kill himself again.

494
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,270
Where are you going?

495
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,968
I'm just going out for a little bit.

496
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:52,080
Grammy's gonna sleep over, okay?

497
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:54,716
I wanna go. I wanna see Daddy.

498
00:33:54,884 --> 00:33:57,148
No, honey.
Mommy has to go out on her own.

499
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,254
You can stay here with Grammy.

500
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:04,115
- Oh.
- Tara. Don't touch, okay?

501
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,023
Okay.

502
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,433
Damn it, Tara! How many times
do I have to tell you...

503
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:13,967
...not to play with my stuff?
Come on! Get out of here!

504
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:18,737
Calm down, it's just a spill.
- My whole life's a fucking spill!

505
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:22,172
- Tough day?
- Yeah. I'm just stressed.

506
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:25,041
- My brain's all over the place.
- Don't be stressed.

507
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:26,204
Okay.

508
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:32,452
Tara had a fit tonight, wanted to come.

509
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:35,557
Just, it was a tough day.

510
00:34:36,092 --> 00:34:38,754
I know how that can get.
She does that to me all the time.

511
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:41,590
- "I want Mommy, I want Mommy."
- Yeah.

512
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:44,490
So you're mad at her, huh?

513
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:48,694
Yeah. I mean, more at myself.

514
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:50,897
You know how I can get.
I just...

515
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:55,238
- I get frustrated and I lose it.
- Mm-hm. Yeah, well, you know...

516
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:57,505
...when she gets like that
there's nothing you can do.

517
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,548
No, nothing. And my mother acts
like it's all my fault.

518
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:04,346
Hm. Like she never yelled at you.

519
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:08,817
I actually don't think she really ever did.

520
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:13,059
Hey, excuse me a second.

521
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:17,461
Hi, can I just borrow your pepper?
Just for a second? Thanks.

522
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:20,501
I like the big mug, you know?

523
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:27,269
So let me take care of her more
and take the burden off of you, you know?

524
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:30,845
I don't think I'm really comfortable
with that right now, Glenn.

525
00:35:31,614 --> 00:35:33,639
Yeah, I know.

526
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:39,114
I don't care what the judge said,
I'm not a dangerous person.

527
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:44,420
I wanna be a good father, you know.
I am a good father.

528
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:46,619
You know I am.

529
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:50,027
And I love Tara very, very, very much.

530
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,558
I know that you do.

531
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:55,904
So, I just... I think you should let me.

532
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:00,404
Thank you.

533
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:06,374
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about?

534
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,742
What do you mean?

535
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:11,443
You said you had stuff
you wanted to talk to me about.

536
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:16,158
You know, I just wanted to take you
to a nice restaurant, you know?

537
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:27,967
I have to ask you something.

538
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:31,306
I found this... I found this in your pants...

539
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:35,274
...and it's a receipt from the Stardust Motel
and it's from last Friday...

540
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:39,074
...when I worked that double,
and that's your signature.

541
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:40,978
Right there, that's your signature.

542
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:44,143
Sweetie, you know
I don't have a credit card.

543
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:47,585
Okay.

544
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,821
- Um, are you fucking Annie?
- Oh, boy.

545
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:58,126
Why would I do that?

546
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:44,609
You didn't have to pay for your half.
- It's okay. It's not a big deal.

547
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:47,875
Hey, would you like to go see
a movie with me next week?

548
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:50,952
I'm probably working.
- Your mom says you got Thursdays off.

549
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,918
I don't have every Thursday off.
I'd have to check my sched...

550
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,251
And stop asking my mother
about my schedule.

551
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:58,394
Yeah. Do you just not wanna
go out with me?

552
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:02,964
No, it's complicated, you know?

553
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:05,697
- Are you seeing somebody?
- Glenn, stop.

554
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,894
- Stop what? What?
- Glenn. You're doing it again.

555
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:11,734
- What am I doing?
- You're being insecure. Stop it.

556
00:38:11,908 --> 00:38:15,469
It's just a little weird
being asked on a date by your husband...

557
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:20,412
...and after everything...
- I'm fine. I'm fine. God.

558
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:23,017
All that is done.
I'm just trying to make a connec...

559
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:25,518
Is it done? Are you fine?

560
00:38:25,855 --> 00:38:29,222
I'm fine. I'm all better. Seriously.

561
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,519
I mean, you know, can't you tell?

562
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,364
Well, your ears got bigger.

563
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:39,364
Yeah, I got weird ears. Well, just...

564
00:38:39,535 --> 00:38:41,833
Just think about going out
with me again sometime.

565
00:38:42,005 --> 00:38:44,371
- Okay. No, I will, and...
- Just think about it.

566
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,508
Thanks.

567
00:38:47,477 --> 00:38:48,739
- Well...
- Well, I'm gonna go.

568
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,708
Okay.

569
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,705
- Didn't go too well, did it?
- It was good.

570
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:56,644
It's okay.

571
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:58,719
I love you.

572
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,541
<i>Hello?
- Barb?</i>

573
00:39:25,715 --> 00:39:29,583
<i>Is this Annie? Listen, Nate isn't gonna
be able to meet you right now.</i>

574
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:33,210
<i>I'm talking with him.
I'm talking to my husband, all right?</i>

575
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:37,052
<i>God, what's up with you?
Why did you do this?</i>

576
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:39,753
Barb, I'm sorry.

577
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,864
<i>I don't care whether you're sorry,
and I don't care what you say.</i>

578
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:44,966
<i>Don't ever call here again.</i>

579
00:40:04,253 --> 00:40:06,221
I hope you don't think
you're staying here.

580
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:08,289
Where am I gonna go, huh?

581
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,450
She said if she found me at home
when she got home she'd kill me.

582
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:14,187
Well, I could tell you
where a nice motel is.

583
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:18,593
- That's so stupid.
- She's sleeping.

584
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:20,531
Sorry.

585
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:26,872
She found a carbon from the motel.

586
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:29,511
She just sprung it on me.
I didn't know what to say.

587
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,512
- What was I supposed to say?
- So you told her it was me?

588
00:40:32,682 --> 00:40:33,876
Huh?

589
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,018
- Did you tell her it was me?
- Yeah, I told her.

590
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,449
- I'm not gonna lie to her.
- What do you mean?

591
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:41,590
- You lied to her for weeks.
- You were the first name she came up with.

592
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:43,555
Oh, and you said yes?

593
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:48,788
Fuck.

594
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,968
- You hungry?
- No. Fuck.

595
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:15,847
Go back to sleep.

596
00:41:16,025 --> 00:41:17,890
It's okay.

597
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:22,321
- Okay, go back to sleep.
- Here, Mommy.

598
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:24,966
Thank you.

599
00:41:25,968 --> 00:41:27,959
Come on, baby, it's late.

600
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,900
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

601
00:41:30,072 --> 00:41:32,540
- My doll fell on the floor.
- Did it?

602
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,233
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

603
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,412
Snuggle down, baby.

604
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:46,883
Hey.

605
00:41:47,056 --> 00:41:49,081
Hey.
- What's all the ruckus?

606
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:52,056
You drinking? You drinking?

607
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:56,289
I'm drinking.
Can I get a beer and something short?

608
00:41:56,466 --> 00:41:58,832
Where do I begin?

609
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,508
Mmm.

610
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:10,646
Hey, Annie.
What's happened to Barb, please?

611
00:42:12,381 --> 00:42:14,349
Barb, can we talk?
Can I talk to you?

612
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:16,485
We can talk
when you quit this fucking job.

613
00:42:16,652 --> 00:42:17,710
I can't quit. I can't.

614
00:42:17,887 --> 00:42:19,479
Apparently, you can do whatever
you wanna.

615
00:42:19,655 --> 00:42:21,816
- Come on, Annie.
- Will you listen to me?

616
00:42:21,991 --> 00:42:23,219
You did this to yourself!

617
00:42:23,392 --> 00:42:26,452
Guys, what the hell are you doing?
What you doing? What's going on?

618
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:28,597
Annie, I wanna know
what's going on here.

619
00:42:31,267 --> 00:42:34,259
I can't believe you're here right now.
I don't wanna look at you.

620
00:42:34,437 --> 00:42:36,803
There's no excuse.
I'm not gonna make up something.

621
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:39,373
- I thought we were friends.
- We are. We are friends.

622
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:42,807
Just because your relationship fell apart
doesn't give you any right...

623
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:47,040
...to tear mine down. Until I can find
another job, I don't wanna look at you.

624
00:42:47,216 --> 00:42:48,740
I don't need this bullshit.

625
00:42:48,918 --> 00:42:50,351
Annie, phone call.

626
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:54,687
Fucking bitch.

627
00:42:54,957 --> 00:42:57,152
Fuck. Coffee. Be right back.

628
00:42:57,326 --> 00:43:00,454
<i>I know what's happening.
I know what's happening and I forgive you.</i>

629
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,929
<i>We're all forgiven. I believe that.
I have to believe it.</i>

630
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,433
Please leave me alone, Glenn.
Do you want me to have to call the police?

631
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:11,562
And don't give me that born-again bullshit,
and stop spying on me!

632
00:43:11,741 --> 00:43:15,336
<i>are you having sex with him in our house?
In our bed?</i>

633
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:17,672
<i>How can you do...?</i>

634
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:21,112
I love Nate, Annie.
You should know that.

635
00:43:21,284 --> 00:43:23,149
God, you kill me.

636
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:30,623
My dad got this for me last summer.
I haven't really used it, though.

637
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:35,258
- See anything you wanna take a picture of?
- No.

638
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:36,693
Life-affirming...

639
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:40,666
- Dad?
- Arthur?

640
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,360
What are you doing here?

641
00:43:42,538 --> 00:43:44,972
Taking my friend to get her camera fixed.

642
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:46,472
- Hi.
- Hi.

643
00:43:46,642 --> 00:43:49,577
- Lila. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi. Nice to meet...

644
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:51,946
- Hello, I'm Marcia.
- Hi.

645
00:43:52,114 --> 00:43:54,742
Marcia. Hi, I'm Marcia.

646
00:44:00,156 --> 00:44:02,021
<i>Hansel thought it strange
that they...</i>

647
00:44:03,259 --> 00:44:05,557
Look, he's got blue-suede shoes
like Elvis.

648
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:06,990
Aha.
- Mm-hm.

649
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:09,358
He's like Elvis
except without the amphetamines.

650
00:44:09,532 --> 00:44:12,797
- Look. Candy!
- I know. It's terrific.

651
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:19,033
- What are you doing?
- Eating candy.

652
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:21,510
Have you eaten anything
good for you today?

653
00:44:21,677 --> 00:44:24,271
- Want some candy?
- She had a pickle.

654
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,109
- What did you have to eat today?
- Let her have some candy.

655
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:30,184
Why should she have candy?
- Okay, try decaf.

656
00:44:30,353 --> 00:44:33,220
- What's the matter?
- Look, do not do what I told you not to do!

657
00:44:33,389 --> 00:44:35,357
Spit that out now!

658
00:44:35,725 --> 00:44:39,217
Tara. Okay, you know what?
You, young lady, are gonna listen...

659
00:44:39,395 --> 00:44:41,022
- Stay out of this.
- What's the deal?

660
00:44:41,197 --> 00:44:44,189
We're gonna go upstairs and bath
and you're gonna wash your face.

661
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:48,167
Annie! Get that car out of here!
- Goddamn it.

662
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,202
Don't get mad at me.

663
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:57,971
Whose car is this, man?

664
00:44:59,148 --> 00:45:03,278
- Annie! Who you got in there?
- It's okay.

665
00:45:03,653 --> 00:45:05,518
Oh, man.

666
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:08,381
Nice car.
- Don't touch my car.

667
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:11,349
- Don't touch my fucking car, man.
- That's a nice car.

668
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:13,324
Don't touch my car.
- For a pimp.

669
00:45:13,496 --> 00:45:16,727
You can't be on this property, chief.
You understand?

670
00:45:16,899 --> 00:45:19,629
Hey, man, don't fucking tell me
I'm not allowed here.

671
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:22,300
- This is my house, man.
- Not anymore.

672
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,098
That's my family in there.

673
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:26,741
- That's far enough.
- Aren't you a nurse, Buster Brown?

674
00:45:26,909 --> 00:45:28,433
Go home, will you? Go home.

675
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:32,809
Hey, Annie, you don't take my calls?
You don't want me to see my daughter?

676
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,973
Aren't you supposed to be
selling carpets?

677
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:38,177
- Come on, get out of here. Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

678
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:41,881
What are you, a kung fu guy?
What are you, kung fu? You kung fu?

679
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:52,092
You better get your head and your ass
wired together.

680
00:45:52,268 --> 00:45:53,599
- Yeah. Peace.
- You understand?

681
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:56,670
- I'll suck you right up my tailpipe, bro.
- Jesus loves you.

682
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:59,967
Piece of shit.
- Tailpipe my...

683
00:46:00,142 --> 00:46:01,905
Motherfucker!

684
00:46:02,078 --> 00:46:06,378
Motherfucker! That's my house!
That's my house!

685
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:11,316
That's my wife! That's my wife!
That's my wife!

686
00:46:12,755 --> 00:46:14,052
That's my kid!

687
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,116
You wanna party with Nate?
- Fuck you, man!

688
00:46:18,294 --> 00:46:21,559
Do you wanna party with Nate?
- Fuck you! Fuck you!

689
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:23,995
Do you wanna party with Nate?
Do you?

690
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,293
Get off him, Nate.

691
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,546
I shall go through this furnace unscathed.

692
00:46:42,718 --> 00:46:44,549
I bit my lip.

693
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:47,249
Go home, Glenn.

694
00:46:47,656 --> 00:46:49,317
Go home.

695
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:54,628
Yeah.

696
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:04,869
Yeah.

697
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:24,290
Hello.
- You scared me.

698
00:47:33,302 --> 00:47:34,701
What's that word that means...

699
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,771
...for how you hold your mouth
when you're playing?

700
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,066
Embouchure.

701
00:47:39,241 --> 00:47:41,971
Yeah, your embouchure's funny.

702
00:47:42,344 --> 00:47:45,074
Pbbt.
- That's funny.

703
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:48,611
I'm not doing it. I can't.

704
00:47:49,351 --> 00:47:51,182
Why are you here so late?

705
00:47:51,353 --> 00:47:55,756
I had to take an Algebra II test
that I skipped last week.

706
00:47:55,925 --> 00:47:57,256
How'd you do?

707
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,452
You know, I'm pretty good at math.

708
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:07,460
Can I show you something?

709
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,333
Where did you take these?

710
00:48:12,007 --> 00:48:15,408
We move a lot,
so every time we get to a new place...

711
00:48:15,578 --> 00:48:18,945
...I like to capture my first impressions.

712
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:23,183
So these are all here?

713
00:48:23,352 --> 00:48:26,583
Yeah. You must not be very observant.

714
00:48:26,755 --> 00:48:28,916
Not really.

715
00:48:29,091 --> 00:48:32,288
I listen, and I remember things better
that way.

716
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:34,759
Yeah? I'm not a very good listener.

717
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,329
Hm.

718
00:48:46,876 --> 00:48:50,403
- Do you need a ride?
- No.

719
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,513
- You sure?
- Yeah.

720
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:56,742
Thanks for letting me see your pictures.
They were really good.

721
00:48:56,919 --> 00:48:57,977
I'll see you.

722
00:49:01,757 --> 00:49:03,349
Hi.

723
00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:05,283
Who's that interesting girl?

724
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:07,929
- She's new in school.
- New in school?

725
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:10,565
Yeah, she's nice.
She takes nice pictures.

726
00:49:11,066 --> 00:49:12,658
Lila.

727
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:15,703
She seems nice.

728
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:17,338
Yeah.

729
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,400
Mommy?

730
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:55,407
- Yeah?
- Can I play outside?

731
00:49:56,578 --> 00:49:58,842
Honey, Mommy's not feeling well today.

732
00:49:59,014 --> 00:50:01,346
I wanna go.

733
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:03,712
Come snuggle with Mommy.
There's cartoons.

734
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:07,754
Just for ten minutes and then
we can go outside and you can play.

735
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,693
You know that girl you saw me with?
You know she's just a friend, right?

736
00:50:16,865 --> 00:50:20,801
- It's just, she's like a regular person.
- All right.

737
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,804
- That I met, and...
- You met her before you left Mom?

738
00:50:24,974 --> 00:50:29,240
Yeah, technically,
but she works at a bank and...

739
00:50:29,411 --> 00:50:32,437
I mean, it's not a relationship
you should trouble yourself over.

740
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,777
- It doesn't mean anything.
- You had your arm around her.

741
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:40,149
- Well, it doesn't mean anything.
- Well, then why are you doing it?

742
00:50:40,322 --> 00:50:46,557
Because sometimes we do things
we can't explain.

743
00:50:55,237 --> 00:50:56,261
Tara?

744
00:50:58,507 --> 00:51:00,304
Tara?

745
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:07,179
Tara?

746
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:13,015
Tara?

747
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:20,289
Tara!

748
00:51:27,036 --> 00:51:28,435
Tara!

749
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,705
Sweetie?

750
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:46,281
<i>Overbrook assisted Living.</i>

751
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:48,047
<i>Nate Petite, please.</i>

752
00:51:48,223 --> 00:51:50,282
<i>I'm sorry.
Who are you wishing to speak with?</i>

753
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:53,895
<i>Nate. I need to talk with him.
It's an emergency.</i>

754
00:51:54,063 --> 00:51:56,361
<i>He's already left his shift for the morning.</i>

755
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:04,700
Claire?

756
00:52:18,487 --> 00:52:20,512
Tara!

757
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:31,562
Glenn!

758
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,137
<i>Hello?</i>

759
00:52:36,305 --> 00:52:40,002
Barb? It's Annie.

760
00:52:40,509 --> 00:52:42,204
Are you there?

761
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:46,106
I need help.
I don't know what else to do.

762
00:52:46,682 --> 00:52:49,446
What happened to you and dude?
Are you guys living together?

763
00:52:49,618 --> 00:52:51,848
Who, David?
- Mm.

764
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:54,915
- Yep.
- No, I'm straight.

765
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:59,215
<i>Yeah, we still...
We're living together. It's going pretty good.</i>

766
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:08,692
Tara! Tara!

767
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:33,685
Tara!

768
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:35,796
Annie!

769
00:53:41,236 --> 00:53:42,294
Tara!

770
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:45,798
Annie!

771
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,510
Annie?

772
00:53:54,483 --> 00:53:57,418
You all right? Oh, God!
Oh, my God.

773
00:53:57,586 --> 00:54:00,316
Listen, the cops are here, all right?

774
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:04,152
I don't know where Nate is but I know
they're out looking for Glenn, all right?

775
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,521
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

776
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:10,928
We're all part of a team here.
We work together. We're committed.

777
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:13,465
- You can't afford to be late.
- I know.

778
00:54:13,635 --> 00:54:17,002
It's not all right.
There are a lot of people relying on me.

779
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:20,198
- They're relying on you.
- I know. I know.

780
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:24,004
Now, don't give me any of your crap.
I just want you to hear me out.

781
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:26,374
- Listen to what I gotta say.
- Glenn?

782
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:27,973
Yeah?

783
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,016
- Can I speak to you for a minute?
- Yeah, what's going on?

784
00:54:38,794 --> 00:54:41,319
When's the last time
you saw your daughter?

785
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:50,236
Your husband's on his way.

786
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:52,639
Can I get you anything?

787
00:54:52,808 --> 00:54:54,139
Glenn didn't have Tara?

788
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:57,403
No.
- Then why aren't you looking for her?

789
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:01,982
We have people out.
We're trying to do everything.

790
00:55:03,752 --> 00:55:08,246
It's mostly dog hairs.
Samples from the truck.

791
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:11,988
- You get pictures?
- Yes, sir.

792
00:55:16,565 --> 00:55:18,624
What happened to your lip?

793
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,633
I got in a fight the other night.

794
00:55:21,803 --> 00:55:24,363
Yeah, with who?

795
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:27,007
My wife's new boyfriend.

796
00:55:27,643 --> 00:55:30,476
- Jesus Christ, Glenn.
- I don't know why you think...

797
00:55:30,646 --> 00:55:32,705
...he has anything to do with this.
- Livvie.

798
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:36,442
No, it's my house.
You should be talking to her.

799
00:55:36,785 --> 00:55:38,878
She won't even let him
see his own daughter.

800
00:55:39,054 --> 00:55:40,715
That's what he says.

801
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:44,154
- Well, doesn't that tell you something?
- Okay, what's going on?

802
00:55:44,326 --> 00:55:45,759
What now? What, what now?

803
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:49,090
Are we gonna sit down
and have a little dinner? What's happening?

804
00:55:49,264 --> 00:55:52,097
I'll take you to join the search
after we're done here.

805
00:55:54,536 --> 00:55:57,505
I gotta piss like a racehorse.
Can I go to the bathroom?

806
00:55:57,673 --> 00:56:00,164
You're capable. You could do it.

807
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:02,074
Do what?

808
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:04,872
Take her. Take her from her mother.

809
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:12,279
I would never hurt Tara.

810
00:56:12,454 --> 00:56:14,888
I didn't say you'd hurt her.
- I didn't do anything!

811
00:56:15,057 --> 00:56:19,357
I didn't do anything, okay?
I didn't do anything.

812
00:56:23,732 --> 00:56:25,563
I hope that's right.

813
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,071
Come here.
Let me have your hand for a sec.

814
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:39,409
"Hey, you."

815
00:56:40,082 --> 00:56:42,141
With a exclamation point.

816
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,978
Hey, you.

817
00:56:48,423 --> 00:56:49,947
So why are you smiling?

818
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:52,025
I've never seen you without your glasses.

819
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:55,630
Yeah. Because I think
I look funny without them.

820
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:57,856
You know what else I think?

821
00:56:58,033 --> 00:57:01,332
I think I like you.

822
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:08,137
And I think you like me too.
And you're just afraid to say it.

823
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:13,044
At least, I want you to like me,
because...

824
00:57:13,415 --> 00:57:16,145
Huh? What's that?

825
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,948
When you smile, I think it's attractive.

826
00:57:23,558 --> 00:57:28,393
And I'm totally not even sure
what I'm saying anymore right now.

827
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:29,723
Why?

828
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,158
Don't leave.

829
00:57:32,334 --> 00:57:36,031
I'm nice, aren't I?
I'm really nice, actually.

830
00:57:36,204 --> 00:57:39,264
And I like you so much,
and I made it so clear...

831
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:42,968
...and I just have so much fun
when we hang out.

832
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:45,636
I just, like, I couldn't tell.

833
00:57:45,814 --> 00:57:48,146
I did say that I liked you.

834
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:49,908
- What?
- See?

835
00:57:50,085 --> 00:57:51,109
What?

836
00:57:51,286 --> 00:57:55,518
Do you have any idea
how adorably cute you are?

837
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:57,089
- No.
- Right now.

838
00:57:59,661 --> 00:58:00,855
Come here.

839
00:58:01,029 --> 00:58:02,360
No, you come here.

840
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:04,021
Come here.

841
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:05,866
No.

842
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:07,862
Meet halfway.

843
00:58:17,345 --> 00:58:19,745
<i>Students,
can I have your attention, please?</i>

844
00:58:19,915 --> 00:58:23,248
<i>We are concluding school early today,
so that as of this moment...</i>

845
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:26,353
<i>... we may assist the community
in a local situation.</i>

846
00:58:26,822 --> 00:58:30,280
I can't imagine what you're going through.
I have a daughter myself and...

847
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:33,485
Get your fucking hands off me.
- Easy.

848
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:35,857
You don't have her?

849
00:58:36,298 --> 00:58:38,232
I don't have her.

850
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,434
Where's your boyfriend?

851
00:58:42,904 --> 00:58:44,599
I don't know.

852
00:58:56,718 --> 00:58:57,878
What's going on?

853
00:58:58,053 --> 00:58:59,714
- Where have you been?
- I was at work.

854
00:58:59,888 --> 00:59:01,981
No, you weren't.

855
00:59:07,696 --> 00:59:09,926
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

856
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:14,962
All right, listen up, people.
Come on, now. Take a seat.

857
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:16,797
We got a little girl missing.

858
00:59:16,972 --> 00:59:20,032
She's been out there now for somewhere
between two and three hours.

859
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:22,642
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna partner up.

860
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:24,938
And I want you to keep
your partner in sight...

861
00:59:25,113 --> 00:59:28,412
...as we search the area
within a four-mile radius.

862
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:32,519
The little girl's name is Tara.
She's 4 years old.

863
00:59:32,687 --> 00:59:35,747
Let's get out there
and let's bring her home safe.

864
00:59:35,924 --> 00:59:37,357
That's Annie's daughter.

865
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:40,260
<i>We're looking for a little girl.</i>

866
00:59:40,729 --> 00:59:45,166
Four years old.
Brown eyes, brown hair, brown eyes.

867
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:49,963
If you find something you believe
to be important, do not touch it.

868
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:53,403
We will send the appropriate person
to take a look at it.

869
00:59:53,575 --> 00:59:56,339
We have people here trained
to deal with the situation.

870
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:59,309
Thank you for your cooperation.

871
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:02,848
All right, don't lie.

872
01:00:03,018 --> 01:00:06,681
You were making love to Lily La-La-Lupe.

873
01:00:06,855 --> 01:00:08,880
Whatever her name is.

874
01:00:09,424 --> 01:00:13,224
You were under the bleachers.
You were naked. I saw it.

875
01:00:13,395 --> 01:00:15,124
Don't lie.

876
01:00:22,904 --> 01:00:26,670
We're supposed to look
from here to the highway fence.

877
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:28,365
Well, she wouldn't be down here.

878
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,443
Tara!

879
01:00:31,246 --> 01:00:33,771
She probably just fell asleep
under her bed.

880
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:35,211
I did that.

881
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:38,011
Hey, you got any weed?

882
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:40,518
Yeah.
- All right.

883
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:45,015
Fuck.

884
01:00:46,962 --> 01:00:48,827
Here's cool.

885
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:02,710
This beats the shit out of band practice.

886
01:01:19,394 --> 01:01:20,952
I'm feeling very positive.

887
01:01:21,129 --> 01:01:23,359
This is some good shit.

888
01:01:24,699 --> 01:01:26,667
This is fucked up.

889
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:30,967
Say something if you see the cops.

890
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:32,299
You're paranoid.

891
01:01:39,414 --> 01:01:42,212
- Check it out. A mitten.
- Fuck.

892
01:01:42,617 --> 01:01:43,709
Don't touch it.

893
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,067
What the fuck is that?

894
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:06,728
Can I help you, sir?
- That's my son.

895
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:09,028
- I'm here to see my son.
- Your son is fine.

896
01:03:09,237 --> 01:03:12,229
You're gonna have to wait over there.
Step back, all right?

897
01:03:12,407 --> 01:03:14,307
Okay, okay. Arthur?
- I think that...

898
01:03:14,476 --> 01:03:15,966
Arthur?

899
01:03:17,145 --> 01:03:21,241
- Mom, Dad's here. Dad's here.
- Just, I'll be right...

900
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:23,213
Lou.

901
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:27,083
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's safe.

902
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,700
I need to get back
to my son. I'll call you.

903
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:50,671
Arthur, I'm gonna ask you
to do me a favor.

904
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:58,412
To not bottle this up inside, okay?

905
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:01,853
It's easy for...

906
01:04:02,323 --> 01:04:05,781
For us to block out the things
that upset us.

907
01:04:07,462 --> 01:04:09,362
That's what I do.

908
01:04:12,734 --> 01:04:15,100
That's what most people do.

909
01:04:16,337 --> 01:04:19,829
But it's important
that you feel through this.

910
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:23,239
It's so important, I can't tell you.

911
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,056
Oh, Lord, my God,
if I have done this, if there is wrong in me...

912
01:05:09,224 --> 01:05:11,784
...if my hands have already acquired
enough from evil...

913
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,587
...plunder the enemy without cause.

914
01:05:13,761 --> 01:05:15,729
Let the enemy pursue me
and overtake me...

915
01:05:15,897 --> 01:05:20,459
...and trample my life to the ground
and lay my soul in the dust.

916
01:05:23,204 --> 01:05:26,970
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want me to do?

917
01:05:29,143 --> 01:05:31,941
What do you want me to do, God?

918
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:38,977
You okay?

919
01:05:40,088 --> 01:05:41,646
No.

920
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:49,257
Do you need me?

921
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:03,976
Father God, I...

922
01:06:04,145 --> 01:06:07,137
I have bad, bad dreams, Father God.

923
01:06:07,315 --> 01:06:10,807
I have really very, very, bad dreams.

924
01:06:13,755 --> 01:06:16,952
<i>I couldn't sleep last night...</i>

925
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:19,252
<i>... thinking about Annie.</i>

926
01:06:20,528 --> 01:06:23,088
<i>I don't know how to comfort people.</i>

927
01:06:26,234 --> 01:06:29,226
I hate when I say a stupid thing.

928
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:38,268
Stupid things you say
make me like you even more.

929
01:07:25,827 --> 01:07:28,261
Mom? Who built the snowman?

930
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:30,795
I did. Do you like it?

931
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,296
It's okay.

932
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:34,492
What are you doing?

933
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:40,201
I got a letter from your father today,
and I tore it up.

934
01:07:49,951 --> 01:07:51,976
He misses us.

935
01:07:54,022 --> 01:07:56,616
I think he wants his family back.

936
01:08:12,373 --> 01:08:15,809
Hey. Where's my wife?

937
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:18,601
- I want my wife.
- Hey. Listen to me.

938
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:21,840
- You can't be here now, man.
- Yeah, listen, I wanna talk to Annie.

939
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:26,282
All right, all right, just stop!
Just stop right there.

940
01:08:28,222 --> 01:08:31,555
You know,
everybody's been through a lot lately.

941
01:08:31,726 --> 01:08:35,287
Why don't you just leave Annie alone
right now? Okay?

942
01:08:37,398 --> 01:08:41,732
You think you're a tough guy
because you got a baseball bat?

943
01:08:44,906 --> 01:08:48,137
You think you're a tough guy
because you pushed my face in the snow...

944
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:49,936
...and you got a baseball bat?

945
01:08:50,111 --> 01:08:53,478
You think you're a badass?
Let me tell you something.

946
01:08:54,348 --> 01:08:56,248
I'm bad.

947
01:08:58,686 --> 01:09:00,449
I'm bad.

948
01:09:02,156 --> 01:09:03,453
You know...

949
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:06,951
...after Annie first left me
I tried to kill myself.

950
01:09:07,128 --> 01:09:09,062
Did she tell you that?

951
01:09:11,165 --> 01:09:14,760
I drove my car off a bridge on purpose.

952
01:09:15,269 --> 01:09:18,568
Yeah, I landed, a hundred-foot drop.

953
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:22,133
Bam.

954
01:09:22,643 --> 01:09:24,110
There was an explosion.

955
01:09:24,278 --> 01:09:27,509
And I sat there,
upside down without a scratch...

956
01:09:27,682 --> 01:09:29,616
...just dizzy.

957
01:09:29,784 --> 01:09:33,276
And then I got out and I looked up...

958
01:09:35,156 --> 01:09:37,750
...and I saw the sky...

959
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:42,462
...and I realized that in everything
there has to be meaning, you know.

960
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:45,394
I'd been living for myself...

961
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:49,434
...and God saved me from that fall.

962
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:55,833
I had the power to do real big things,
you know?

963
01:09:56,377 --> 01:09:59,312
You know what it says in the Bible, huh?

964
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,880
It says, "God will save you."

965
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:03,880
You're an adulterer.

966
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:06,246
But God doesn't hate you.

967
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:11,483
If you recognize your wrongs
and ask me to forgive you...

968
01:10:14,362 --> 01:10:18,128
...l'll give you everything,
everything I have.

969
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:22,360
Glenn, will you go home?
Please?

970
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:26,563
I gotta work in the morning, okay?
In fact, everybody has to work tomorrow.

971
01:10:26,741 --> 01:10:28,299
So just... Just go home.

972
01:10:28,509 --> 01:10:32,275
I forgive you.
I don't even know you, but I forgive you.

973
01:10:32,446 --> 01:10:34,539
Believe me, it counts.

974
01:10:35,349 --> 01:10:38,079
But I don't forgive Annie.

975
01:10:38,252 --> 01:10:42,814
I'm trying, you know? I'm praying.

976
01:10:45,459 --> 01:10:47,154
But she rejects me.

977
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:51,222
She makes it...

978
01:10:51,399 --> 01:10:55,199
She makes it hard, you know?

979
01:11:00,942 --> 01:11:03,934
She let my baby...

980
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:07,505
She let my baby die.

981
01:11:08,082 --> 01:11:11,017
She let my baby die.

982
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:14,916
I just wanted to come and say hi,
you know?

983
01:11:15,756 --> 01:11:19,817
I just wanted to talk to her, man.

984
01:11:22,763 --> 01:11:25,493
Why can't I just talk to her?

985
01:11:26,133 --> 01:11:29,125
I just wanna say hi, you know?

986
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:34,765
Glenn.

987
01:11:34,942 --> 01:11:37,638
- Think you're tough, huh?
- Glenn.

988
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,011
- Oh, come on.
- Can you do that?

989
01:11:43,384 --> 01:11:45,579
Can you do that?

990
01:11:45,753 --> 01:11:48,517
All right, Glenn, it's time to crash.
Let me call you a cab.

991
01:11:53,828 --> 01:11:55,989
I forgive you.

992
01:11:56,163 --> 01:11:57,755
Glenn?

993
01:12:27,762 --> 01:12:30,629
Will you come back inside?
It's freezing out.

994
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:35,801
He used to make me laugh.

995
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:39,735
He told me I was beautiful.

996
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:42,709
He had this way
of making me feel like...

997
01:12:42,877 --> 01:12:45,607
...everything was gonna work out
in the end.

998
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:52,476
Well, you gotta realize,
people don't stay the same.

999
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:57,219
You know, you guys were together
a long, long, time.

1000
01:12:57,391 --> 01:13:00,554
He was the only man
I've ever been with until you.

1001
01:13:03,164 --> 01:13:06,622
He wasn't happy deep down
and neither was I.

1002
01:13:11,205 --> 01:13:13,105
You should go.

1003
01:13:19,814 --> 01:13:22,078
Don't say that.

1004
01:13:24,618 --> 01:13:27,018
Who's Tricia Farr?

1005
01:13:29,857 --> 01:13:31,882
She's a girl that I work with. Why?

1006
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:34,789
Were you fucking her when it happened?

1007
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,695
Were you?

1008
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:38,889
She's fat.

1009
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,398
At the motel,
while I was searching for Tara?

1010
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:44,037
I told you. I was out shopping
for Christmas presents.

1011
01:13:44,205 --> 01:13:46,070
Was it in the same room?

1012
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,676
Did you light candles and bring wine
and smell her hair?

1013
01:13:49,844 --> 01:13:54,110
- Okay, listen, can we just go back inside?
- No, not until you've gone.

1014
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:58,877
Look, you wanna go.
I want you to go.

1015
01:13:59,653 --> 01:14:02,747
I don't wanna take care of you anymore.

1016
01:14:03,257 --> 01:14:06,784
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
taking care of people.

1017
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:09,691
I wanna take care of myself.

1018
01:14:12,366 --> 01:14:16,200
Even after what I did to her,
Barb was there for me.

1019
01:14:18,005 --> 01:14:20,235
There are good people.

1020
01:14:33,287 --> 01:14:34,811
Mm-mm.

1021
01:14:34,989 --> 01:14:38,789
Shake it, Freddy!
Yeah! Do that one-legged bitch.

1022
01:14:43,898 --> 01:14:47,891
Come on. Shake it up, shake it up.

1023
01:14:49,537 --> 01:14:53,029
It's a victory! Yes!

1024
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,451
Dance!

1025
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,661
Fucking dance, motherfucker!

1026
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:45,739
Mom?

1027
01:17:48,082 --> 01:17:49,777
Mom?

1028
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,381
So, um,
why did you send Mom that letter?

1029
01:17:58,058 --> 01:18:03,462
- I mean, you're kind of making her insane.
- Come on, dude.

1030
01:18:03,631 --> 01:18:06,623
You know that letter was between
your mom and me, you know?

1031
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,997
And she does have a tendency
to dramatize.

1032
01:18:10,371 --> 01:18:13,568
That's not it. That's not it, Dad.

1033
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:17,443
You gotta stop going back and forth.

1034
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:22,281
You gotta decide what you want.
You gotta make up your mind.

1035
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:24,041
And that you wanna repair it now.

1036
01:18:24,218 --> 01:18:27,085
What do you expect for her to do?
What do you expect us to do?

1037
01:18:27,254 --> 01:18:30,655
- All right, that's enough.
- Don't. Don't. Let me finish.

1038
01:18:30,824 --> 01:18:34,191
You left Mom and me
because you're selfish.

1039
01:18:34,361 --> 01:18:37,762
And we recognize that,
and we deal with it.

1040
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:42,199
But that other lady, she didn't.
She didn't love you, did she?

1041
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:43,836
Did she leave you?

1042
01:18:44,004 --> 01:18:46,905
She didn't put up with what sucks
about you, right?

1043
01:18:51,278 --> 01:18:52,768
You know, the other day...

1044
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,772
...when I saw you and your mother
at the, uh...

1045
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,319
The accident...

1046
01:19:02,623 --> 01:19:06,684
...I wanted so much to hold her,
I wanted to be there...

1047
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,023
...for you, more than anything.

1048
01:19:10,197 --> 01:19:13,223
And, now, I...

1049
01:19:15,235 --> 01:19:20,195
I just have this urgent need
to keep trying.

1050
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:29,115
<i>Annie, Glenn just came by my house,
I thought I should tell you.</i>

1051
01:19:29,283 --> 01:19:30,307
You okay?

1052
01:19:30,484 --> 01:19:34,011
<i>I'm fine. He brought over some pictures
he'd taken with Tara.</i>

1053
01:19:34,188 --> 01:19:38,215
<i>I told him I could take a set for you,
but he didn't want to leave them with me.</i>

1054
01:19:38,392 --> 01:19:39,620
Did you call the police?

1055
01:19:39,793 --> 01:19:44,127
<i>He was very polite. Kept calling me "Mom."
He even had a cup of tea.</i>

1056
01:19:44,298 --> 01:19:47,233
<i>- I think maybe he's coming out of it.
- So you didn't call them?</i>

1057
01:19:47,401 --> 01:19:49,835
<i>- I did. I thought you'd want me to.
- Good.</i>

1058
01:19:50,003 --> 01:19:51,630
<i>I don't know what they're gonna do.</i>

1059
01:19:51,805 --> 01:19:53,739
I don't know either. I'm glad you called.

1060
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:56,009
We should talk about this later,
Mom, okay?

1061
01:19:56,176 --> 01:19:59,577
<i>Okay, honey. Bye-bye. I love you.</i>

1062
01:19:59,747 --> 01:20:01,009
Is everything okay?

1063
01:20:01,181 --> 01:20:02,239
I don't know.

1064
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:05,385
Well, you're welcome to stay at my house.
Or stay with your mom.

1065
01:20:05,552 --> 01:20:07,747
You should be somewhere safe.

1066
01:20:09,223 --> 01:20:12,317
Arthur, you okay?

1067
01:20:14,328 --> 01:20:15,693
Oh, shit.

1068
01:20:17,998 --> 01:20:22,230
- Come on, let's just go back inside.
- No. Stay here with me.

1069
01:20:28,509 --> 01:20:29,840
I brought you something.

1070
01:20:31,445 --> 01:20:33,106
You're not supposed to be here.

1071
01:20:33,647 --> 01:20:36,411
I brought you some pictures of Tara
that you don't have.

1072
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,016
Your mom said you'd like them.

1073
01:20:38,185 --> 01:20:41,552
You heard what the police said, Glenn.
You're not supposed to be here.

1074
01:20:41,722 --> 01:20:46,421
These are pictures of me and Tara
I got taken at the mall.

1075
01:20:47,327 --> 01:20:49,887
Annie, this is hard for everyone,
you know?

1076
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:52,622
And, I'm just...

1077
01:20:53,133 --> 01:20:55,067
I just wanna...

1078
01:20:56,136 --> 01:20:58,468
We can't forget about Tara, you know?

1079
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,436
I don't want them.

1080
01:21:01,975 --> 01:21:03,340
Okay.

1081
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:05,341
I'm just gonna...

1082
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:09,572
- I'll leave them here.
- Why won't you listen to me?

1083
01:21:09,983 --> 01:21:12,577
I don't want them!
I don't want anything from you!

1084
01:21:12,753 --> 01:21:14,744
Let's go back inside.

1085
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:21,754
Why don't you listen, Glenn?
Don't you fucking listen?!

1086
01:21:21,929 --> 01:21:25,660
That's our daughter. You're throwing
pictures on the ground, of our daughter.

1087
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:28,495
- I'm gonna go call the cops.
- Shame on you. Shame on you.

1088
01:21:28,669 --> 01:21:30,159
You fucker!

1089
01:21:30,337 --> 01:21:33,670
Get off. Don't push me. Don't push me.
Don't push me, Annie. Get off me.

1090
01:21:33,841 --> 01:21:35,172
Get off me!

1091
01:21:35,342 --> 01:21:38,140
Goddamn you, Glenn!
- Shut up.

1092
01:21:38,312 --> 01:21:39,973
Get the fuck out of here!
- Shut up!

1093
01:21:40,147 --> 01:21:42,911
Stay out of it!
It's not your fucking business!

1094
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,074
- Get out of here!
- Get out of here!

1095
01:21:45,519 --> 01:21:47,817
Fucking finished!

1096
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:54,086
I tried to do something nice for you,
and I...

1097
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:58,227
I'm sorry.

1098
01:22:00,801 --> 01:22:05,135
<i>She used to babysit me
when I was younger, for years.</i>

1099
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:10,642
She used to let me stay up
till past midnight.

1100
01:22:14,615 --> 01:22:16,105
I had a crush on her.

1101
01:22:18,852 --> 01:22:21,514
I used to drop my toys on the floor.

1102
01:22:22,522 --> 01:22:26,014
She'd have to bend down,
pick them up.

1103
01:22:26,193 --> 01:22:28,252
I could see right down her shirt.

1104
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:31,654
<i>She stayed over once.</i>

1105
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:35,965
My parents went out of town.

1106
01:22:37,738 --> 01:22:39,899
I saw her naked.

1107
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:46,871
I took my mom's little makeup mirror...

1108
01:22:49,149 --> 01:22:50,912
...tilted it under the bathroom door.

1109
01:22:52,152 --> 01:22:54,347
<i>I watched her shower.</i>

1110
01:22:59,493 --> 01:23:01,757
<i>She was beautiful.</i>

1111
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,492
How are you this morning?

1112
01:24:14,668 --> 01:24:16,863
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

1113
01:24:17,037 --> 01:24:18,868
How are you? You look nice.

1114
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:20,165
Thank you.

1115
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:24,140
I've got an interview
at Gillis and Petrosky.

1116
01:24:24,311 --> 01:24:28,247
They need personnel for their non-profit.
Maybe if I get off my ass.

1117
01:24:32,552 --> 01:24:35,350
- What?
- What's the glow for?

1118
01:24:35,655 --> 01:24:38,180
- Did you have Lila over last night?
- No.

1119
01:24:39,526 --> 01:24:40,959
Don't you bullshit me.

1120
01:24:41,128 --> 01:24:44,586
At least somebody's getting
some action around here.

1121
01:24:44,965 --> 01:24:48,230
I just hope you didn't make
that poor girl climb out the window.

1122
01:24:48,402 --> 01:24:51,428
- She could twist an ankle and sue you.
- What is this?

1123
01:24:51,605 --> 01:24:55,598
I found it in the mailbox this morning.
Looks like your father made me a mix tape.

1124
01:24:55,776 --> 01:24:59,610
- For what? What for?
- I don't know, I haven't decoded it.

1125
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,873
Let's check it out.

1126
01:25:02,049 --> 01:25:06,577
He wants me to go to your football game
with him on Friday. What do you think?

1127
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:19,598
So silly. Don.

1128
01:25:26,006 --> 01:25:30,033
<i>Teaching us that
denying ungodliness and worldly lust...</i>

1129
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:33,907
<i>... we should live soberly, righteously,
and godly.</i>

1130
01:25:34,081 --> 01:25:37,175
<i>Whereabouts in this present world,
looking for that blessed hope...</i>

1131
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:40,911
<i>... and the glorious appearing of the great
God and our savior Jesus Christ...</i>

1132
01:25:41,088 --> 01:25:45,286
<i>... who gave Himself for us,
that He might redeem us from all iniquity...</i>

1133
01:25:45,459 --> 01:25:50,328
<i>... to refine to Himself a peculiar people,
zealous of good works.</i>

1134
01:25:50,497 --> 01:25:53,159
<i>Thee, these things speak
in exhorted refute...</i>

1135
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:55,801
<i>... with all authority
let no man despise thee.</i>

1136
01:25:55,969 --> 01:25:57,266
<i>Now, get something straight.</i>

1137
01:25:57,437 --> 01:26:00,998
<i>When you're saved by grace,
grace is the teacher that tells you...</i>

1138
01:26:01,174 --> 01:26:05,167
<i>... that you are not to live in sin anymore.</i>

1139
01:26:05,345 --> 01:26:07,677
Yeah, I know. I know.

1140
01:26:22,129 --> 01:26:24,996
What's going on, mate? Where you been?
Cops came back.

1141
01:26:25,165 --> 01:26:26,894
Yeah, I know, I know.

1142
01:26:27,067 --> 01:26:29,331
I didn't do anything,
everything's all screwed up.

1143
01:26:29,503 --> 01:26:32,495
- Well, does Annie know where you are?
- No, no, no.

1144
01:26:32,672 --> 01:26:37,803
I'm gonna disappear for a while, Rafe,
and I just wanted to thank you for...

1145
01:26:38,678 --> 01:26:40,077
...being patient with me.

1146
01:26:40,247 --> 01:26:42,909
I know you went out on a limb,
and I'm letting you down...

1147
01:26:43,083 --> 01:26:44,414
...by ditching out like this.

1148
01:26:44,584 --> 01:26:46,814
- Do you need some money or something?
- No.

1149
01:26:46,987 --> 01:26:50,013
No, no, no, no, I just wanted to...

1150
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:52,055
...come by and tell you that I love you.

1151
01:26:52,225 --> 01:26:55,353
God loves you to the max.

1152
01:26:55,529 --> 01:26:57,360
All right?

1153
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:05,804
Is your mom gone?
- Mm-hm.

1154
01:27:05,972 --> 01:27:08,065
She has a job interview.

1155
01:27:08,241 --> 01:27:10,232
Sorry, breakfast is a little cold.

1156
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:13,277
That's okay. Thank you.

1157
01:27:13,446 --> 01:27:14,572
Thank you.

1158
01:27:14,748 --> 01:27:16,807
Hurry up, eat fast, get dressed.

1159
01:27:17,484 --> 01:27:18,678
We'll be late for school.

1160
01:27:18,852 --> 01:27:23,812
So why don't we take our time a bit?

1161
01:27:35,902 --> 01:27:40,532
I can't see you that well,
but I'm sure you look great.

1162
01:27:42,475 --> 01:27:44,340
Now we're talking.

1163
01:27:44,511 --> 01:27:46,274
It's your turn.

1164
01:27:51,985 --> 01:27:54,078
It's hard to get a good angle
with the helmet.

1165
01:27:54,254 --> 01:27:56,381
You could take it off.

1166
01:28:11,805 --> 01:28:13,329
Mom?

1167
01:28:14,407 --> 01:28:16,034
Dad?

1168
01:28:18,345 --> 01:28:20,040
Mom?

1169
01:28:22,749 --> 01:28:24,683
Grandpa?

1170
01:31:53,827 --> 01:31:56,625
Let the evil of the wicked
come to an end.

1171
01:31:56,796 --> 01:31:59,356
My name is not Glenn.
I am born with the water.

1172
01:31:59,933 --> 01:32:02,458
I am one with the spirit of Jesus Christ.

1173
01:32:33,867 --> 01:32:35,061
Shh.

1174
01:32:35,235 --> 01:32:38,500
- Please, I didn't do anything.
- Shh.

1175
01:32:39,239 --> 01:32:41,070
Just be quiet.

1176
01:32:42,408 --> 01:32:44,069
- Where's your gun?
- I don't know.

1177
01:32:44,244 --> 01:32:46,212
- Where's your gun?
- I don't know.

1178
01:33:04,597 --> 01:33:06,258
Are you supposed to have work today?

1179
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,024
Yeah.

1180
01:33:08,868 --> 01:33:12,031
- Did you eat?
- Please, don't do this.

1181
01:33:12,205 --> 01:33:13,433
Just be quiet, okay?

1182
01:33:13,606 --> 01:33:17,337
I'll go somewhere, okay? I'll leave.
You'll never have to see me again...

1183
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:21,708
Shh! Don't talk. I told you, don't talk.

1184
01:33:21,948 --> 01:33:24,746
- I don't wanna do this either, okay?
- Well then, don't.

1185
01:33:24,918 --> 01:33:28,979
No. No, we're gonna do this.
We're gonna do this.

1186
01:33:30,957 --> 01:33:32,686
Take off your shoes.

1187
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:34,659
No.

1188
01:33:37,764 --> 01:33:40,164
Annie, I don't wanna get angry right now.

1189
01:33:40,333 --> 01:33:42,927
Don't fucking get angry.
I'm not taking off my shoes.

1190
01:33:43,136 --> 01:33:45,627
- Goddamn it! Take them off!
- Fuck you!

1191
01:33:45,805 --> 01:33:47,102
No! Take them off!

1192
01:33:47,273 --> 01:33:49,833
- Fuck you!
- Take... Goddamn it!

1193
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:53,171
- I had our baby, you asshole.
- You what?

1194
01:33:53,346 --> 01:33:55,507
I had our baby, you asshole!

1195
01:33:55,682 --> 01:33:58,378
- You had our baby? Fuck you!
- Fucking talk to me like that.

1196
01:33:58,551 --> 01:34:00,519
It's your fault the baby's dead!

1197
01:34:00,687 --> 01:34:02,245
Take the fucking shoes off!

1198
01:34:02,422 --> 01:34:05,983
Take them off! Take them off!
Take them off, now!

1199
01:34:13,733 --> 01:34:15,291
Fuck!

1200
01:34:16,035 --> 01:34:17,593
Fuck!

1201
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:19,397
Shh.

1202
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,368
All right, sit down.

1203
01:34:49,535 --> 01:34:51,127
Sit down.

1204
01:35:43,589 --> 01:35:45,079
You gonna be still?
You gonna be still?

1205
01:35:46,859 --> 01:35:50,659
Shh. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1206
01:35:53,066 --> 01:35:55,296
It's okay. I'm sorry.

1207
01:35:55,468 --> 01:35:57,561
Shh.

1208
01:35:58,705 --> 01:36:01,105
Shh.

1209
01:36:06,312 --> 01:36:10,646
Shh. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1210
01:36:11,551 --> 01:36:13,985
I love you very much, you know?

1211
01:36:14,487 --> 01:36:16,614
Fuck you!

1212
01:36:28,668 --> 01:36:30,465
It's okay.

1213
01:36:59,398 --> 01:37:01,195
It's okay.

1214
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:17,372
- Here.
- Uh! Uh.

1215
01:37:25,625 --> 01:37:27,149
It's all right.

1216
01:37:27,994 --> 01:37:30,428
It's okay. Kneel down.

1217
01:37:30,596 --> 01:37:32,223
Kneel down.

1218
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:44,373
You're real sweaty.

1219
01:37:45,845 --> 01:37:46,869
I'm sorry.

1220
01:37:51,584 --> 01:37:53,552
Tell me when you're ready.

1221
01:38:05,698 --> 01:38:07,791
I'm ready.

1222
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:39,990
Scoot over, Bomber. Scoot over.

1223
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:43,658
That's a good boy. That's a good boy.

1224
01:38:45,037 --> 01:38:46,129
Come on.

1225
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:58,075
That's a good boy.
It's okay, boy, don't be scared.

1226
01:38:58,251 --> 01:38:59,479
It's okay.

1227
01:38:59,652 --> 01:39:01,381
Fuck.

1228
01:39:02,021 --> 01:39:04,387
I forgot the rabbit.

1229
01:39:04,690 --> 01:39:06,885
Fuck. Fuck.

1230
01:39:17,403 --> 01:39:19,030
Go. Go.

1231
01:39:33,019 --> 01:39:34,509
Hi.

1232
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:42,818
Hi.

1233
01:40:51,697 --> 01:40:56,498
You never know what fate
has in store for you, sweetheart.

1234
01:40:57,570 --> 01:41:01,199
It's funny how you can tell
the fake smiles in pictures.

1235
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:05,041
You notice people don't bring
out cameras on sad days?

1236
01:41:05,211 --> 01:41:06,872
Mm.

1237
01:43:02,061 --> 01:43:04,120
Bomber!

1238
01:43:05,764 --> 01:43:08,107
Bomber!

1239
01:47:04,903 --> 01:47:06,894
