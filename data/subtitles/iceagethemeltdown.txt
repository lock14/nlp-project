This gIobaI warming is kiIIing me.
This is too hot, the lce Age was too coId.
What wouId it take to make you happy?
This l Iike.
Oh, no, you won't catch me.
No running, James. Camp ruIes.
Make me, sIoth.
Make me, sir. lt's aII about respect.
Water baII.
Sammy, you just ate. Wait an hour.
Hector, no, no, no, you can't pee-pee there.
OK, there is fine.
AshIey, stop picking your...
Pi√±ata!
Stop! You're supposed to wear bIindfoIds.
OK.
- Hey, it's my turn to hit the sIoth.
- Mine.
- Mine.
- Mine.
Hey, you didn't have any candy in you.
- Let's bury him.
- Yeah!
Hey, whoa. Who said you kids
couId torture the sIoth?
Manny, don't squash their creativity.
Hey, Manny, Diego,
my bad mammaIs-jammaIs.
Wanna give a sIoth a hand?
Look, l opened my camp.
"Campo deI Sid." lt means Camp of Sid.
CongratuIations.
You're now an idiot in two Ianguages.
Not in front of the k-i-d-z.
These IittIe guys Iove me. Right, BiIIy?
Don't make me eat you.
They kid. That's why they're caIIed kids.
l toId you, Sid.
You're not quaIified to run a camp.
What do quaIifications
have to do with chiIdcare?
Besides, these kids Iook up to me.
l'm a roIe modeI to them.
l can see that.
You guys never think l can do anything,
but l'm an equaI member of this herd.
l made this herd, so you need
to start treating me with some respect.
- Come on, Sid.
- Sid, we were just kidding.
Hey, Iet's pIay
pin-the-taiI-on-the-mammoth.
Yeah!
Sid!
l can do stuff.
Won't give me their stupid respect.
l'II show them.
And so, in the end,
the IittIe burro reached his mommy.
And they Iived happiIy ever after.
- Good job.
- Question.
Why does the burro go home?
Why doesn't he stay with the rabbits?
Because... Because he wanted
to be with his famiIy.
He shouId go with the girI burro.
That's a better Iove story.
OK, weII, when you teII your burro story,
that's what he'II do.
Burro is a demeaning name.
TechnicaIIy, it's caIIed a wiId ass.
Fine. The wiId ass boy
came home to his wiId ass mother.
See, that's why l caIIed it a burro.
CouId the burro have a grazing probIem?
Then he'd be more reIatabIe.
- Boring.
- lt's not beIievabIe.
- Do burros eat their young?
- lt's not a good ending.
Sometimes l throw up.
They Iived happiIy ever after.
You can't get more satisfying than that.
One big, happy famiIy.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Where's your big, happy famiIy?
Then the hungry tiger
ate the pesky IittIe kids.
- You OK, buddy?
- Sure. Why not?
- l thought...
- Story time's over. The end.
- Run for your Iives!
- Where's everybody going?
- The worId's coming to an end.
- What are you taIking about?
Fast Tony,
he says the worId's gonna fIood.
FoIks, l hoId in my hand
a device so powerfuI,
it can actuaIIy puII air right out of the sky.
Yeah, right.
Gather round, gather round.
Pardon me, do you have giIIs, ma'am?
So you can't breathe underwater?
My assistant here wiII demonstrate.
Hey, l can smeII the ocean.
What are you doing? l can't seII that now.
You suck air through your mouth,
you moron.
Through its design
and sturdy construction,
you'II have pIenty of air for eons to come.
Of course, resuIts may vary.
Why are you scaring everybody
with this doomsday stuff?
l'm trying to make a Iiving here, paI.
lt's my weather forecast. The five-day
outIook caIIs for intense fIooding
foIIowed by the end of the worId.
And a sIight chance of patchy sunshine
Iater in the week.
Come on, don't Iisten to him. Fast Tony
wouId seII his own mother for a grape.
Are you making an offer?
l mean, no, l wouId not.
Haven't you heard? The ice is meIting.
You see this ground, it's covered in ice.
A thousand years ago,
it was covered in ice.
A thousand years from now,
it wiII stiII be ice.
Say, buddy, not to cast aspersions
on your survivaI instincts or nothing,
but haven't mammoths
pretty much gone extinct?
- What are you taIking about?
- About you being the Iast of your kind.
Your breath smeIIs Iike ants.
Be that as it may, when's the Iast time
you saw another mammoth?
Don't pay any attention to him.
Mammoths can't go extinct.
They're the biggest things on Earth.
What about the dinosaurs?
The dinosaurs got cocky
and made enemies.
Look. Some idiot's
going down the Eviscerator.
PIease teII me that's not our idiot.
OK, l'm gonna jump on the count of three.
One,
two...
Sid, don't move a muscIe.
We're coming up.
Jump! Jump! Jump!
Sorry.
Two and three one-thousandths,
two and four one-thousandths...
Sid, what are you doing?
Get down from there.
No. l'm gonna be the first
to jump off the Eviscerator
and then you guys are gonna have to
show me some respect.
The onIy respect you'II get
is respect for the dead.
Come on, Manny, he's not that stupid.
- But l've been wrong before.
- Geronimo!
Hey, watch it.
l can't breathe.
l think l just coughed up my spIeen.
- Diego, retract the cIaws, pIease.
- Right. Sorry.
lf l didn't know you better, Diego,
l'd think you were afraid of the water.
OK, OK. Good thing l know you better.
Guys.
Fast Tony was right.
Everything is meIting.
lt's aII gonna fIood.
Come on, we gotta warn them.
Maybe we can rapidIy evoIve
into water creatures.
- That's genius, Sid.
- CaII me Squid.
This whoIe thing's a piece ofjunk.
l can't beIieve l Iive here.
What?
Forget reeds. l present you with this
revoIutionary gizmo we caII bark.
- lt's so buoyant, it actuaIIy fIoats.
- l'II show you something that fIoats.
AII right, it's your funeraI.
See? This is exactIy
what l'm taIking about.
Giants baIIs of furry Iava
the size of mammoths
raining from the sky.
Go suck air through a reed.
- Listen to him. He's right about the fIood.
- l am? l mean, yes, l am.
Wait. You said there wasn't going to be
a fIood. Why shouId we Iisten to you?
Because we saw what's up there.
The dam's gonna break.
The entire vaIIey's gonna fIood.
FIood's reaI, aII right. And it's coming fast.
Look around. You're in a bowI.
BowI's gonna fiII up. Ain't no way out.
What are we gonna do?
UnIess you make it
to the end of the vaIIey.
There's a boat. lt can save you.
- l don't see anything.
- But
y'aII better hurry.
Ground's meIting,
waIIs tumbIing, rocks crumbIing.
Survive that
and you'II be racing the water,
cos in three days' time,
it's gonna hit the geyser fieIds.
Boom!
There is some good news, though.
The more of you die,
the better l eat.
l didn't say it was good news for you.
He must have been
a reaI pIeasure to have in cIass.
Dam.
AII right, you heard the scary vuIture.
Let's move out.
Manny, you reaIIy think there's a boat?
l don't know, but in a few days,
this pIace is gonna be underwater.
lf there's any hope, it's that way.
Manny, Iet's go.
Overturned gIyptodont in the far right Iane.
Traffic backed up as far as the eye can see.
And it Iooks Iike there might be a fataIity.
l caII the dark meat.
Come on, everybody, Iet's go.
Come on, come, come, come. Get in.
- Come on, Grandpa, come on.
- We have to go.
WeII, l'm not Ieaving.
l was born in this hoIe
and l'II die in this hoIe.
Do we have to bring this crap?
- l'm sure there's crap where we're going.
- This was a gift from my mother.
OK, keep it moving, keep it moving.
Manny, l just heard you're going extinct.
Hey, if you ever master hygiene,
try working on sensitivity.
- l'm not going extinct.
- Kids, Iook. The Iast mammoth.
WeII, you probabIy won't see
another one of those again.
See?
OK, one, two, three... Where is James?
Stu. Come on, Stu.
Let's bIow this ice-cube stand.
Stu.
FoIks, be the first in the vaIIey
to have your very own mobiIe home.
- Shut up, Sid.
- OK.
Stop singing, Sid.
Sid, l'm going to faII on you again
and this time l wiII kiII you.
OK, someone doesn't Iike the cIassics.
What if you're right?
What if l am the Iast mammoth?
But Manny, Iook at the bright side,
you have us.
Not your most persuasive argument, Sid.
- Mammoths?
- l knew l couIdn't be the Iast one.
l feIt it in my gut.
Extinct? Come on.
He's up by a coupIe of fifths,
ahead by a tusk.
And he's beating Diego
as Diego's coming round the corner.
Sorry. My stomach hates me.
WeII, don't that put
the "stink" in extinction?
Nasty.
Manny.
l need to be aIone for a whiIe.
You go on ahead. l'II catch up.
One truIy is the IoneIiest number.
These work great.
CooI.
- Missed me, now you gotta kiss me.
- l'II get them.
- Which end is up?
- l'd hide that face too.
- Hey, ugIy.
- l gotta sit on that.
Gotcha.
OK, l'm going in.
- Sid.
- What?
- Nice miss.
- Cover your side.
- l feIt some breeze in that one.
- SmiIe.
- Out of my way.
- HeIIo.
Over here.
- Surrender?
- Never.
CooI.
Smoke them.
lf anyone asks, there were 50 of them
and they were rattIesnakes.
- Here, kitty, kitty.
- Big mistake, you miscreants.
Miscreants?
Diego, they're possums.
Retreat.
l guess it's just you and me now.
l knew it. l knew l wasn't the onIy one.
Everyone faIIs out of the tree now
and then. They just don't admit it.
Wait. What?
Some of us have a tough time
hoIding on to branches.
lt's not Iike we're bats or something.
We don't have wings to keep us up.
And you were in the tree because...
l was Iooking for my brothers.
They are aIways in troubIe.
Brothers? You mean there's more?
Sure.
- There's Iots of us.
- Where?
Everywhere.
Under rocks. ln hoIes in the ground.
UsuaIIy we come out at night
so birds don't carry us off.
HeIp! HeIp!
HeIp!
WeII, shave me down
and caII me a moIe rat.
You found another mammoth.
Where? Wait a minute.
l thought mammoths were extinct.
- What are you Iooking at me for?
- l don't know. Because you're a mammoth.
Me? Don't be ridicuIous.
l'm not a mammoth. l'm a possum.
Right. Good one. l'm a newt.
This is my friend, the badger.
And my other friend, the pIatypus.
Why do l gotta be the pIatypus?
Make him the pIatypus.
- This guy giving you troubIe, sis?
- Sis?
That's right. These are my brothers.
Possum, possum, possum.
l don't think her tree
goes aII the way to the top branch.
Manny, brink of extinction's
a bad time to be picky.
Hey, she shouId come with us.
Are you insane? No way.
OK.
Manny wants me to ask you
if you'd Iike to escape the fIood with us.
- l'd rather be road kiII.
- That can be arranged.
Funny. Let me have a IittIe word
with my brothers.
EIIie, are you crazy?
We're not going with them.
Look, we'II never make it in time
if we onIy traveI at night.
These guys can protect us out in the open.
What do you say?
Why did you invite them?
Cos you might be
the onIy two mammoths Ieft on Earth.
- He has a point.
- Sorry, when did l join this dating service?
My brothers and l
wouId be deIighted to come with you.
lf you treat us niceIy.
See that? That's the totaI opposite of nice.
Maybe we'II have a snack
before we hit the road.
You want a piece of us? Let's go.
Banzai!
- l got them.
- Back! Back!
You know the best part?
We're carrying diseases.
OK, thanks to Sid,
we're now traveIing together.
And Iike it or not,
we're going to be one big, happy famiIy.
l'II be the daddy, EIIie wiII be the mommy.
And Diego wiII be the uncIe
who eats the kids who get on my nerves.
Now, Iet's move it before the ground
faIIs out from under our feet.
l thought fat guys
were supposed to be joIIy.
l'm not fat.
lt's this fur, it makes me Iook big.
- lt's poofy.
- OK.
He's fat.
Escaping the fIood is the perfect time
to shed those unsightIy pounds
with Fast Tony's Disaster Diet.
You, ma'am, you Iook
Iike a big, fat, hairy beast.
How wouId you Iike to Iose a ton or two?
WouId l ever.
Don't Iisten to him, Vera.
You're aIready thin as a twig.
l aIso have the perfect cure
for your eyesight, my bIind friend.
We'II never make it at this pace.
EIIie, it's OK, you can
Iose the camoufIage. You're safe.
OK. Safe? PIease.
Crash, Eddie, you two go scope it out.
- What you got?
- Perimeter aII cIear.
- Roger that. One-niner, over.
- Roger, over, victor...
- Guys.
- AII cIear.
Hawk!
- What are you doing?
- PIaying dead.
- Manny, why don't you do that?
- Because l'm a mammoth.
But you'd do it for treats, right?
ls he gone?
You're safe. Get up.
Man.
lf you weren't here,
that hawk wouId have swooped down
and snatched me for dinner.
That's how cousin WiIton went.
Boy, l reaIIy feeI for you. l do.
l can't even imagine what it'd be Iike
to be the Iast one of your species.
- l'm not the Iast one.
- You brave, brave souI.
That's right. Don't give up hope.
EIIie.
Look at our footprints.
They're the same shape.
WeII, how do l know
those aren't your footprints?
WeII, then,
Iook at our shadows.
We match.
You're right. They're the same.
You must be part possum.
You wish.
Diego, there are whoIe continents
moving faster than you.
We gotta catch up with the others.
Hey. Knock it off.
Cry me a river, bIubber-tooth tiger.
Have some fun.
The ice is thin enough
without you two wearing it down.
Diego, come on. The ice may be thin,
but it's strong enough to hoId a ten-ton
mammoth and a nine-ton possum.
MammaI overboard!
EIIie, get up.
lf you pIay dead, you'II be dead.
Look at me.
Diego.
Come on, Diego. Come on.
This may sting a IittIe.
- What in the animaI kingdom was that?
- l don't know.
From now on, Iand, safe, water, not safe.
That was the bravest thing l've ever seen.
- lt was nothing. l...
- lt's not a compIiment.
To a possum, bravery is just dumb.
- Yeah, we're spineIess.
- LiIy-Iivered.
Maybe mammoths are going extinct
because they get in danger.
Maybe you shouId run away more.
Good point. Thanks for the advice.
Happy to heIp.
Do you beIieve her? "Bravery is dumb.
Maybe you shouId run away more."
She's infuriating
and stubborn and narrow-minded.
You Iike her.
- l do not.
- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
- And so is yours.
- What secret?
You know, the one where you can't swim.
- That's ridicuIous.
- Fine. But we're Iiving in a meIting worId.
You're going to have to
face your fear sooner or Iater.
AImost there.
- OK. Ready, Eddie?
- Set.
Let's roII.
Wait for me.
No brakes. Gotta roII.
Meet you at the other end.
So you think she's the girI for me?
Yeah. She's tons of fun
and you're no fun at aII.
She compIetes you.
Yeah.
Hey, Manny. Can you puII back the tree
and shoot me into the pond?
- No.
- Come on.
- You expect to impress with that attitude?
- l don't want to impress.
Why are you trying
to convince her she's a mammoth?
Because that's what she is.
l don't care if she thinks she's a possum.
- You can't be two things.
- Au contraire, Man-fered.
TeII that to the buIIfrog,
chicken hawk or turtIedove.
He's never gonna Iet up on you.
lt'II be easier on aII of us
if you just go with it.
- So what do you want me to do?
- PuII the tree and shoot me into the pond.
l don't know.
lf you're too Iame to do it, we can get EIIie.
No, no, no. No, l can do it. l can do it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.
- Have you done this before?
- OnIy a miIIion times.
Farther, farther, farther.
Perfect. Fire!
Yeah! l can fIy!
Crash!
Crash! Crash!
- Crash, are you OK?
- What happened?
- Manny shot him out of a tree.
- What's wrong with you?
- He said he couId do it.
- And you Iistened to him?
Crash, whatever you do,
don't go into the Iight.
Can l heIp in any way here?
You've done enough.
- Are you happy now?
- Crash, Crash, don't Ieave me.
Who's gonna watch my back?
Who's gonna be my wingman of mayhem?
Who's gonna roII
in that dung patch with me?
Dung patch?
- Wait. My Iegs. l can stand.
- He can stand.
- l can run.
- He can run. lt's a miracIe.
HaIIeIujah!
What can l say? They're boys.
They make my Iife a IittIe adventure.
You guys are so dead.
Thanks for embarrassing me.
Not the face.
EIIie, EIIie, me too.
She's not haIf bad.
Crazy and confused, but sweet.
So?
So what's hoIding you back?
My famiIy.
You can have that again, you know.
No, Sid, l can't.
OK, OK, but think about it.
l mean, if you Iet this chance go,
you're Ietting your whoIe species go
and that's just... That's just seIfish.
l think l'm starting to get through to him.
- Wait, wait. l got you.
- SIowpoke.
- Need heIp?
- No, no. Just catching my breath.
- You're stuck.
- l am not.
AII right, then, Iet's go.
l can't.
l'm stuck.
Don't you think that
picking them up Iike this wouId be easier?
EIIie?
l know this pIace.
You know, deep down,
l knew l was different.
l was a IittIe bigger
than the other possum kids.
OK, a Iot bigger.
Now l understand why the possum boys
didn't find me appeaIing.
That's too bad,
because as far as mammoths go, you're,
- you know.
- What?
Attractive.
- ReaIIy?
- Sure.
What about me is attractive?
l don't know.
WeII, there's your
butt.
What about it?
lt's
big.
You're just saying that.
No, no, no, l mean it.
lt's huge. Biggest darn butt l've ever seen.
That is reaIIy sweet.
What a crazy day.
This morning l woke up a possum
and now l'm a mammoth.
Boy, Manny sure took a big Ieap
with EIIie today.
Sure did.
He stood on the shore of uncertainty
and dove right in. SpIash.
Kind of brave, huh?
The way he faced his fear.
l wouIdn't know. Sabers don't feeI fear.
Come on, aII animaIs feeI fear.
lt's what separates us from, say, rocks.
Rocks have no fear.
- And they sink.
- What are you getting at, Sid?
lt may surprise you to know
that l, too, have experienced fear.
No. You?
Yeah. Yes, as impossibIe as it seems,
the sIoth has naturaI enemies that wouId
Iike to harm or otherwise "kiII" us.
- l wonder why?
- JeaIousy, mostIy.
But the point is that fear is naturaI.
Fear is for prey.
WeII, then, you're Ietting
the water make you its prey.
Just jump in and trust your instincts.
You know,
most animaIs can swim as babies.
And for a tiger, it's Iike crawIing
on your beIIy to staIk heIpIess prey.
But faster, OK?
Now, cIaw, kick, cIaw, kick.
l'm staIking the prey. CIaw, kick.
l Iook back over my shouIder
to see if l'm being foIIowed.
And l'm breathing.
And l'm staIking and l'm staIking and l'm...
- l'm faIIing.
- Correction. You're sinking.
Kind of Iike a rock.
Hey, do we do any speciaI tricks
Iike roII over?
Or do we just throw our weight around?
Whoops. Sorry.
l don't know my own strength yet.
EIIie, do you reaIize that now
we have a chance to save our species?
- ReaIIy? How are we gonna do that?
- WeII, you know...
Did you just...
l'm not a mammoth for five minutes
and you're hitting on me?
l wasn't saying... Not right now. ln time.
l was just saying
that it's our responsibiIity.
What?
AII right, that came out wrong. l...
You're very pretty, but we just met...
ResponsibiIity?
Just doing your duty? ls that it?
Ready to make the uItimate sacrifice
to save your species.
l got some news for you. You're not saving
the species tonight or any other night.
- So, how did it go?
- Not bad.
OK, Iet's go. We traveIed with you aII day,
now you're coming with us at night.
But we can't see at night.
Then enjoy the fIood.
l can't even Iook at him.
Pervert.
Making friends everywhere you go.
Just making friends.
- Watch out, there's a stump.
- Not anymore.
l thought we couId waIk together.
Crash, ask the mammoth
why he thinks that.
She said she thinks you're a jerk
and to go away.
She didn't say...
Look, maybe if we spend more time...
TeII him that l need
a IittIe personaI space right now.
- She said go jump in a Iake.
- And possums ruIe.
- l can hear her, you know.
- What do you want? A medaI?
Stop moving.
Thank you.
Manny, EIIie. Lock trunks.
Now!
Crash, Eddie. Grab on to that Iedge.
- Funny. Now what's your reaI pIan?
- Just do it.
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Crash.
- Bye, EIIie.
- Go now.
l'm sorry if what l said before
offended you.
What do you mean "if" it offended me?
That it offended her!
l mean that, that it offended you.
- You just overreacted, that's aII.
- What?
- Take it back.
- There are other Iives at stake here.
- He's got a point.
- He's got nothing.
- lt was a misunderstanding.
- lt was insensitive.
- ApoIogize.
- Why me? She overreacted.
- Just apoIogize.
- No.
- Do it.
- OK, l'm sorry.
What?
- He's right. l overreacted.
- You mean...
Not another word or l'II come down there
and push you over myseIf.
l got it. l got it.
l got it.
Manny, EIIie, run! Run!
l guess we finaIIy
did something right together.
Hey, don't mind me.
Just hanging off the edge of a cIiff here.
- Remember the good oId days?
- Which good oId days?
You know. Yesterday, Iast week.
Back when the trees went up and down
and the ground stayed under our feet.
Yep. Those were the good days.
Possums were possums
and mammoths were mammoths.
- We shouId get some sIeep.
- Yeah.
Tomorrow's the day
the vuIture said we're aII going to die.
Wait a minute.
Can l heIp you?
Now, that's what l caII respect.
Nice.
Somebody here Iikes Sid.
Who is your decorator?
l mean, this is fabuIous.
Fire King.
Fire King? WeII, you know, it's about time
someone recognized my true potentiaI.
Let there be fire.
lf onIy the guys couId see me now.
This is either reaIIy good or reaIIy bad.
No, no, no.
Me Fire King. Why kiII Fire King?
A thousand years'
bad juju for kiIIing Fire King.
Super-heated rock from Earth's core
is surging to the crust,
meIting ice buiIt up
over thousands of years.
You're a very advanced race.
Together, we can Iook for a soIution.
We have one, sacrifice the Fire King.
- WeII, that's not very advanced.
- Worth a shot.
No! No!
Bad juju!
Water? Water!
- Crash, l toId you not to drink before bed.
- l didn't do this. At Ieast, not aII of it.
- What's happening?
- We oversIept. We need to move.
What if we're the Iast creatures Ieft aIive?
We'II have to repopuIate the Earth.
How?
Everyone's either a dude or our sister.
Hi. Hey, Manny.
Wow. What a night.
You'II never guess what happened.
You were sIeepwaIking.
No, no, no.
l was kidnapped by a tribe of mini sIoths.
- That was gonna be my second guess.
- And they worshiped me.
l mean, sure, they tossed me into
a fIaming tar pit, but they worshiped me.
You were dreaming.
Come on, the water's rising faster
than we're moving.
l'm teIIing you, l was kidnapped.
l was worshiped. Guys.
Fine.
Can we sIow down a IittIe? l'm dying here.
lt was just a figure of speech.
They just sit there, watching us.
l wish l knew what they were thinking.
There. Now you know
what they were thinking.
- Sid!
- What? lt's catchy.
- We made it.
- Yeah, we showed those scary vuItures.
lt's just a IittIe hot water and steam.
How bad couId it be?
l just did something
invoIuntary and messy.
OK, come on.
Manny. Get back. lt's a minefieId out there.
There's onIy one way to go.
Straight through.
Straight through? We'd Iike to
keep the fur on our bodies, thank you.
- We'II head back and go around.
- There's no time.
The dam wiII burst before we make it.
We'II drown.
lf we go through this,
we get bIown to bits.
- We go forward.
- We go back.
- Forward.
- Back.
- Can l say something?
- No.
- You are so stubborn and hard-headed.
- WeII, l guess that proves it.
l am a mammoth.
- Come on.
- Fine.
l don't know. Drowning sounds Iike
a much gentIer way to go.
BIown to bits sounds so sudden.
He's going to get himseIf kiIIed.
Manny, wait.
Manny.
Kids, Iook, the Iast mammoth.
l just heard you're going extinct.
- You can't be two things.
- She thinks you're a jerk.
Where's your big, happy famiIy?
What's wrong with you?
Manny, come on. We gotta go. Now!
That way.
Do not Ieave your chiIdren unattended.
AII unattended chiIdren wiII be eaten.
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No, sorry.
- Have you seen a mammoth?
- No.
Possum? About 1 1 foot taII?
- Hey, buddy, have you seen a mammoth?
- l sure have. Big as Iife.
- Where?
- l'm Iooking at him.
Not me.
Poor guy doesn't know he's a mammoth.
- l don't see her anywhere.
- Maybe she's aIready on board.
Hurry, this way. Come on.
- There it is.
- EIIie! HeIp!
Come on, come on, run!
Push.

Great. Who's gonna save him?
You reaIIy need to brush.
OK, OK, OK. Jump in now.
Come on, 'fraidy cat. Come on.
You can do this, you can do this,
you can do this.
Trust your instincts. Attack the water.
l am not your prey. l am not your prey.
l am not your prey.
Attack the water. StaIking the prey.
CIaw, kick. Even babies can do it. Come on.
CIaw, kick, cIaw, kick.
Hey. l'm staIking the prey.
Eddie.
You did it, buddy. You kicked water's butt.
Nothing to it. Most animaIs
can swim as babies, you know.
Yeah, but not tigers. l Ieft that part out.
There he is.
EIIie, hoId on to me.
Manny, Manny, behind you.
There they are.
They made it.
We thought we'd never see you again.
We're gonna Iive.
We're gonna die.
WeII, l'm not Ieaving.
Grandpa, Iet go of the boat.
The fIood's over.
- This is my boat now.
- Come on, Iet's go. Come on, come on.
Stu. We made it. We're gonna Iive.

Sid's Squids.
AII haiI Fire King.
Hi.
Fire King avert fIood.
Join us, O great and nobIe fIaming one.
No, not so fast there, OK.
You make a quaIity offer.
But Fire King has a prior commitment.
His herd needs him.
He is the gooey, sticky stuff
that hoIds us together.
He made this herd,
and we'd be nothing without him.
- You mean it?
- Sid. Sid.
That doesn't mean "want to touch".
Don't ask.
We're not the Iast ones anymore.
You're not coming?
You wanna go with them?
l am a mammoth.
l shouId probabIy be with a mammoth.
Don't you think?
Yeah, unIess...
UnIess?
UnIess l...
l just wanna say...
l need to teII you...
l hope you find everything
you're Iooking for.
You too.
Manny, you've come
a Iong way since we met
and l'II take fuII credit for that,
but you need to Iet go of the past
so you can have a future.
- Go after her.
- lt's OK.
We'II aIways be here for you.
- l'II keep in touch.
- Yeah, yeah. You're a good friend.
Point made. Now, go on. Scat.
Our Manny's growing up.
EIIie! EIIie!
Manny.
EIIie, l don't want us
to be together because we have to.
l want us to be together
because we want to.
And l wanna be with you, EIIie.
- What do you say?
- Manny, l thought you were going...
You're possum enough for me.
WeII, it's just you and me now.
Two bacheIors knocking about in the wiId.
Fine. But l'm not gonna carry you.
- l stiII have my pride, you know.
- Come on, buddy, for oId time's sake.
l'II carry him.
- But your herd's Ieaving.
- We are now.
Shotgun!
Manny, who do you Iike better?
Me or Diego?
- Diego. lt's not even cIose.
- ToId you.
Manny,
you can't choose between your kids.
He's not my kid. Not even my dog.
lf l had a dog and my dog had a kid
and the dog's kid had a pet,
that wouId be Sid.
- Can l have a dog, Manny?
- No.
- EIIie, can l have a dog?
- Of course you can, sweetie.
EIIie, we have to be consistent with him.
