<i>GIRL:
I live on top of the world,</i>



<i>in the never-summer mountains
of Wyoming,</i>



<i>8,000 feet closer to the sky.</i>



<i>In my mountains,
when spring finally comes</i>



<i>to save me
from a perpetual winter,</i>



<i>the world comes to life again,</i>



<i>and I remember
what it is I'm here for.</i>



<i>I'm the only daughter
in a long line of ranchers.</i>



<i>And when we let our horses out</i>



<i>for the first time
every spring,</i>



<i>I love to watch them
rediscover the world.</i>



<i>I can see in them an expression
of my own restless spirit.</i>



<i>Charged with an appetite
for adventure,</i>



<i>they take to the land
without hesitation.</i>



<i>They are pure power.</i>



<i>When I see them running
wild and free,</i>



<i>I often think
of the first horses</i>



<i>and how they were
the true pioneers of America.</i>



Thank you, sir.



Time's up, Katy.



See ya!



How'd you do?



Not too bad.



Oh, Katy!



I'm so glad I saw
you before you left.



Can you give this
to Howard for me?



Not a problem.



Thanks.



I think I'm gonna be seeing
a lot of you this summer.



- Um, bye, Gracie.
- See you next year, Miranda.



Hey, Jenny, wait up.



Kathy McLaughlin.



Yes?



You need to come see
the headmaster.



- Bye! See ya!
- Have a good summer!



Seems like I dropped
you off yesterday.



Daddy.



Let's go home.



Okay.



Howard!



This is so cute, it's crazy.



What do you think?



Too many horses?



Too much?



Too babyish?



- Shall we do it?
- Mom!



I know, I know: chill.



You got it.



She's here!



My baby.



Has anybody seen my daughter?



Mom!



I missed you so much!



How are you, baby? Oh...



Oh, thank you.



Howard!



What?



This is from your fan club.



Hey, you okay?



Oh, he's gonna kill me.



How bad could it be?



- Worse.
- Worse?



- Mm-hmm.
- You can tell me later.



I think your mom will finally
sleep through the night.



Who wants to go runnin'?



Guess I can't avoid
the inevitable.



Got to face him some time.



What is it, Yankee?



Hold on!



Yankee!



You scared it off!



Norbert, it's your lucky day.



Oh, is that right?



You ready to meet
a miracle on four legs?



Three-year-old stallion
I been saving just for you.



- Something, ain't he, honey?
- Mm, beauty.



Yeah, I can't use
any more quarter horses.



I mean, any profit
in middle manning horses



is fading faster
than a mountain sunset.



I'll get Howard
to bring her around.



No, now, I don't need him
for the rodeo, either.



Folks are just bored with
calf-roping and barrel racing.



Howard!



Well, here's my check.



Now, just hold on a minute.



Now, I don't need
any more horses- unless...



You might have something
a little more interesting.



For instance?



<i>Mestengos.</i>



Mustangs.



That's right, wild horses.



More loco the better.



- Morning. - Hey.
- Morning, hon.



No mustangs around here.



Them four-legged parasites



can strip ten acres
of grassland overnight.



Wild horse racing's
my biggest draw now.



I had a purse last year
near $10.000.



Only takes one mustang
foal to ruin a herd,



and then my quarter
horses wouldn't be



pure quarter horse
anymore, would they?



All I'm saying is,
if you had a herd



of mustangs around here,
I'd buy 'em all.



If I had a herd of mustangs
around here, I'd be ruined.



Rob, it's fine. It's fine.



Well...



Nell, it's always
a pleasure to see you.



Thanks.



But as for your
husband here, uh...



Gelding would be my suggestion.



I'll see y'all next year.



Bye.



There goes money
we already spent.



It's easy being a rancher
with good luck.



We'll get by, like always.



Howard, call your sister,
start muckin' the stalls.



Yes, sir.



Mm!



She left before I got up.



She what?



- I'll go do it myself.
- You good boy.



Where's Katy?



She must've taken Yankee out.



And for your dining
pleasure, gentlemen,



wild gooseberry pancakes
with crème fraiche



and rosemary chicken sausage.



Well, who lives better than us?



Uh, let me think...
the Rockefellers.



Speaking of which,
you gonna put your brand



on that little schoolgirl
this summer?



You know, Jack, we stopped



branding our females
a few years back.



Isn't that right, Rob?



Kinda miss it, though.



Well, take it from an expert...



Don't let that little flicka



get away.



The what?



It means, uh, “pretty girl”
or something.



That's what Gus calls Katy.



Oh, he does, does he?



A flicka is just a
young girl- innocent.



You can see in her face
the beauty she will become.



I, uh, I think it's Swedish.



My mama used to call my
little sister flicka.



I just saw a lion
on the mountain.



Dad, it was right there
in front of me.



And this horse, this mustang,
it just ran off the lion...



S-Slow down, Katy. Was it
a lion, or was it a horse?



- It was both. We need to do something.
- Where'd you see this lion?



I don't know where I saw it
exactly, but it was there.



Oh, did you see Sasquatch, too?



Somebody ask your opinion?



Katy, wait.



Wh-What is this on your face?
You have blood all over you...



It was a lion. Honest.



Well, as long as
we're being honest,



do you have something
you need to tell me?



About school?



- Did you tell him?
- I didn't say anything.



The headmaster faxed this
to us this morning.



Do you want to read it?



Help me understand
something, Katy.



He said he gave you the topic
to your final essay in advance,



and you turned in
a blank paper.



Not one word in two hours
for the exam.



I wrote it in my head.



I just didn't... put it down.



In your head. Hmm.



Wouldn't have made
a difference, anyway.



They just want us to spit back



exactly what they want to hear.



I have an opinion;
It's just not their opinion.



Well, their opinion is
that you should repeat



the year, just throw it away.
Do you realize what



this family does without so
that you can go to a private school?



Truck's passing 200,000 miles?



Well, let's see if it'll do



another 50.
The barn roof's



about to blow away, we'll patch
it again for the umpteenth time



and all so you can go



to a fancy boarding school.



But I go along
because your mother



wants you to go to college.



Hey, your father wants it, too.



Well, now we'll have to worry
if she'll even graduate.



Thirteen...



Howard, can't you see the rot?



Fourteen...



Fifteen...



Come on.



Sixteen.



Dad...



I think we should bring
that mustang in.



Seventeen.
Not now, Katy.



But that lion
can take down a horse, and...



Katy?



I could probably find her again.



No.



I'll help her.



This doesn't concern you,
does it?



No, sir.



If you live on a ranch,
you have to contribute.



That's how we get by.



Here's your summer:



You're gonna do your chores,



you're gonna help your mother,



and you're gonna
write that essay.



Then maybe I can talk 'em
into passing you.



Yes, sir.



And then maybe we'll
talk about horses.



You ready?



Eighteen...



A trim.



Split ends- that's it.



Sweetheart, just a few inches
for the summer.



- No.
- You stop it.



I get better-reasoned arguments
from the hens.



Short hair makes me look
like a boy.



No, that would be impossible.



You're so beautiful.



What's that thing that,
uh, Gus said?



You're a-a... a flicka.



A flicka?



Yeah, a pretty girl.



So, how's your friend Stephanie?



Shallow... vain...



The usual.



Since when?



Since Eric.



Or was it Justin?
Lost track.



Well, you never know
what'll happen.



People can surprise you.



I guess so.



Surprise!



I'm gonna get you!



Whoo-hoo-hoo!



Okay, okay.



Looks good...



Harry, is that you?



You look good, big boy.



Look at you...



I'm so happy to see you. I am.



What is she thinking?



There she is.



Whoa, down, boy.



Come on!



Let's get her.



Hyah!



Hyah! Hyah!



Keep 'em moving, boys.



Howard!



Yeah, I got 'em this side.



Come on, keep going.



Something's bothering them.



You know what it is?
It's that A. D. D.



- What's going on? Take it easy.
- Come on, keep going.



Hyah! Hyah!
I don't hear anything.



Yes!



Mustang!



Damn!



Let her through.



Hold 'em back!



- Come on!
-Jack, on this side!



She's taking the herd.



Jack, get ahold of this thing.



All right.
Gus, get the herd.



I didn't want the lion
to get my horse.



Your horse?



That animal doesn't belong
to you or anyone else.



Must've separated
from some herd.



I'm surprised it's still alive.



What are you gonna do with her?



I don't have to do a dang thing
with that loco creature.



Ain't worth the price
of a bale of hay.



Ain't Norbert looking
for mustangs?



Get her behind the fence.



Keep her clear of the herd.



Aw, hell! Forget it, Jack-
I'll take her.



Welcome home.



Hey, Howard,
where's your dad at?



Don't ask.



Something Katy did?



- You guessed it.
- Oh...



Thank you.



So... how bad?



Gimme a category.



Oh, I don't think he made
a category for this one yet.



Open the gate!



Aw... come on, now.



Hold still.
Get around here.



Come on.



She's scared to go through.



Hyah! Hyah!



That's the wild horse.



Isn't she beautiful?



Wow, she's something,
that's for sure.



That's a dangerous animal.



She's just scared.



I'd say she's
about two years old.



Yeah, two years wild.
And I'll bet most of it alone.



She'll calm down, once I



- start training her.
- What?



No one's riding that loco thing.



I'm calling Norbert
after supper.



No. I can ride her.



No, you can't!
And you won't.



I won't tolerate it, Katy.



After that stunt
you pulled today?



If you're gonna live
under my roof,



you're gonna follow my rules.



Look at me!



Nobody goes in there
without my permission.



Come on.



Howard!
Get the horses.



Calm down, Flicka.



You named her?



Flicka.



That is the word, isn't it?



Oh, yeah.



Uh, beautiful, um...



Young girl.



Well, you got
the “girl” part right.



I didn't see the vet bill.



Someone want to grab this last burger?



How much?



You know what I've been
thinking about lately?



If quitters never win, why are you supposed
to quit while you're ahead?



Or, how good
can a bedtime story be



if it's supposed
to put you to sleep?



- Right.
- How much?



$1,648.32.



$1,600?!



That's just unacceptable.



Well, I'll speak to the horses.



I don't remember my daddy
ever giving horses shots.



They were healthy,
they took care



of themselves.
Ain't that right, Gus?



Oh, sure. Back then, horses
mucked their own stalls,



nailed on their own shoes,



even chipped in
with the rent money.



Don't call Norbert!



I think I'll have that burger.



Hey, you.



I don't care what he says.



She's my horse.



Calm down. Give me
a chance to talk to him.



He doesn't listen
when he's this mad.



You know what they say...



Anger is just fear
on the way out.



Nice try.



He's not afraid of anything.



I don't know, you could scare
the heck out of anybody.



Yeah, right.



When you were three,



you climbed out of bed,
unlatched the kitchen door



and walked outside.



He found you
in Lightning's stall.



That horse was crazy,
he could've killed you,



and you were laughing.



I don't remember that.



Yeah, well, he does.



Parents have this kind of...
selective memory.



Sometimes I think I can't
remember what I did yesterday,



and then I swear I can remember
every injury, every close call,



every... “another inch
and they could've been killed, ”



that ever happened
to my children.



Try and understand



what it feels like
to be responsible



for something you love so much.



Good night.



Give her the horse.



No.



Come on, honey,
training her own horse



will make her responsible
for something,



and-and she'll feel
proud of herself.



Here it comes- psychobabble.



This isn't about psychology,
Nell, this is about discipline,



and I'm not gonna
reward bad behavior.



That sure sounds
like psychology to me.



No horse.



That's right.



Sorry, girl, that was my fault.



Maybe you should wash up.



Or someone might think you
slept on the ground all night.



You ready for the Price Clu...?



My sweetheart.



Hey, girl.



You want it?



Well, you're gonna have
to come and get it.



But you'd have to trust me
to do that, wouldn't you?



That's enough for tonight.



See you tomorrow.



You can have Chariot.



It's not the same thing.



Well, four legs, a tail...



Food goes in the front,
out the back.



Well, as long as you're
here, he'll be yours.



Not a problem-
'cause I won't be here.



I mean, on the ranch.



Yeah, I know what you mean.



I said I'd give the ranch a try,
I tried it.



It's not working for me.



I think I'm gonna take



that scholarship from B. U.



If I can borrow
somebody's backbone.



So will you tell him?



Why would you want
to leave Wyoming?



Oh, I don't know, how about...



Restaurants where you don't
have to drive up to the window...



He needs you
to keep the ranch going.



Hey, keep your voice down!



Nobody can hear us way out here.



What?



You didn't know?



He's got hidden cameras
and microphones everywhere.



Can you read me, Dad? Over.



What's that?



Yeah, yeah, I'll tell her.



Okay. Over and out.



He said... he doesn't need me.



He said



you're the one he needs.



He just doesn't realize it yet.



You're such a good girl.



Okay, now,
I'm gonna try something new.



Okay?



I'm gonna try this hackamore.



Okay, good girl.



Good girl.



It's okay, it's okay. Shh.



It's okay.



Oh, my...



All right, here we go.



I'm just gonna open...



Flicka, calm down.



You'll wake them all up.



Come on.



Good girl.



Good girl.



Good girl.



Okay,



I'm just gonna try
this hackamore.



Nothing to be scared of.



It's okay.



Okay, let's try this again.



Good girl.



See? Isn't so bad.



Okay.



Shh.



Hey, Dad, uh,



- I been thinking...
- How they look?



Well, pretty much
the same as yesterday.



That can change in a heartbeat.



Right.



You know, animals are
a lot like us, son...



They'll...
always find a way



to tell you exactly
how they're feeling.



You just got to learn
to listen to 'em.



Let's bring 'em in.



- Yeah.
- Let's go!



- Hyah!
- Hyah!



- Watch yourself, Jack!
- Let's go!



Come on! Come on!



He said I can't ride you,



but I don't believe him.



Well... got to find out
sometime, right?



Prove 'im wrong, right, Flicka?



Thank you.



Come on!



You're not supposed
to go in there.



What's it to you?



You could get hurt.



Besides...
that's what your father said.



How long are you gonna be
afraid of my father?



Um... forever.



And you, why are you sneaking out here
in the middle of the night



if you're not scared?



Because I have to.



Then don't let nobody stop you.



Good night.



Babe.



You want to take a ride?



Sure wish you would.



Bye!



We'll be back for dinner, Mama.



- Beautiful.
- Hi, Rick.



Hey.



Esther went out shopping
with her interior decorator.



You know, at this point,
it'd be cheaper



just to adopt that lady.



Hey, handsome.



Aw, thanks.



What do you think
about the horse?



That's a nice bandanna.



Yeah. Some...
some girl gave it to me.



- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.



-Just any old girl?
- No one special.



Bet she'd like to see you at that rodeo.



You gonna come and cheer her on?



If she's good to me.



Did you tell them?



I will.



I'm waiting for the right time.



When is there ever going
to be a right time?



Why don't you just
tell them the truth?



“I changed my mind,
I'm gonna take the scholarship.”



It's easier said than done.



I don't know, I...



I feel like a cartoon.



My-my feet are running,
but I'm just not moving.



I think everyone writes
a story in their head



that eventually becomes
their life.



And if you don't
write it yourself,



then someone else is
gonna write it for you.



That's not gonna happen
to my story.



Am I in your story?



- How's it going?
- Hey.



This was the Chapman Ranch.



12,000 acres.



Last piece sold off
about two years ago.



You mean they just left?



With a great deal of money
in their pockets.



Our marketing people did
a magnificent job.



If you're ever curious...



I'm curious now.



What do you got there, about...



5,000 acres, more or less?



Well, mostly less.



You could get about 20
spectacular home sites



out of that ranch,
and keep your house,



and a hundred acres.



We can't graze our herd
on a hundred acres.



Uh, sweetie, everything
changes in this life.



You know, one day some lucky
guy's gonna marry you.



What are you gonna do if
he doesn't want to ranch?



Break off the engagement.



Ah, wait'll you fall
in love, sweetie.



Well, then I guess
I won't fall in love.



You wouldn't sell
our ranch, would you?



Now, Katy, don't
get all worked up.



But we wouldn't sell;
We're not like them.



It's time to go.
You get in the truck.



You didn't even tell us
you were gonna sell the ranch.



We're not discussing it.



You are?



I was just talking to the man.



I guess it can't hurt.



I mean, just to explore
all your options.



Yeah. All my options.



I can't believe you would give
our land to strangers.



Katy!



It's crazy! Loco!



That's enough!



Hey, hon, how'd it go?



Rob?



Prodigious day, Mom.



I don't even want to know.



Crazy.



What happened
to your movie posters?



I'm moving into my Zen phase.



I hate him.



Tonight you do.



But he never understands me.



I know.



And now you're going away.



Oh, come on.



I'm changing time zones,
not solar systems.



But once you're gone,
you'll never come back.



Hey, girl.



You came to me.



You know me.



Let's ride.



Good girl.



Good girl.



Okay.



Slowly walk.



Good girl.



Yes, Flicka!



I knew we could do it!



Let's go out.
What do you say?



Come on, girl!



Whoa, Flicka.



Whoa! Wait!



Whoa!



Hold on, Flicka!



Whoa!



Hey! Hey!



- You all right?
- Flicka went that way.



- What happened?
- She got bucked off the mustang. We're on it.



Are you hurt?



No!



You couldn't have planned



a better way
to get yourself killed.



Rob, don't.



Don't what?
Don't be her father?



You're not protecting her,
you're crippling her,



and she'll end up being
as useless as that dang mustang.



Flicka isn't useless.
She wants to learn.



No, she doesn't.



You want something
that doesn't exist.



- It's time you see her for what she is.
- I know what she is!



How do you know a dang thing
about that creature?



Because we're the same!



You did this behind my back.



She was excited,
she got carried away.



Don't-don't make excuses
for her.



It's the same as if she
had lied to my face.



You just don't get it.



There's got to be a better way.



Well, if there is,
I don't... I don't know it.



Okay.



Go slow now.



Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.



Flicka!



No! No, you can't take her!



Katy, listen,
it's better this way.



She's never been
inside a trailer before.



She's gonna be fine, sweetie.



She's gonna be a rodeo star.



She's scared!



She can't see the sky!



Stop it!



No!



Katy! Katy!



You're not my father anymore.



Unload Flicka, before you
look like a damn fool!



What is wrong with you?



You made this decision
without me,



because you know it's wrong.



I'm done discussing this.



Well, I'm not done.



Katy found Flicka.



She should decide.



Until you're running
this ranch,



I'll make the decisions
around here!



I don't want to run your ranch!



- Howard!
- No, I'm sick of this place!



You know what,
I've given it a lot of thought,



and guess what?



I'm never gonna be
a rancher. Never.



I want to go to college.



Wh-Why didn't you say anything?



'Cause this is what
you wanted me to do.



Katy wants this ranch.



I don't want any part of it.



I'm sorry you feel that way.



Norbert... take your horse.



Hope to see you folks
at the fairground.



No! Please! No!



- Please!
- Let's move it.



Gus!



Flicka!



No!



Stop! Stop!



<i>The stories we hear</i>



<i>about how the West was won
are all lies.</i>



<i>The history of the West
was written by the horse.</i>



<i>Wherever a settler
left his footprint,</i>



<i>there was a hoof print
beside it.</i>



<i>Men came further and further
west to stake their claim</i>



<i>in the great
American wilderness.</i>



<i>But they encountered a strength
that couldn't be tamed.</i>



<i>Wild horses.</i>



<i>Mustangs.</i>



<i>The settlers
called them parasites</i>



<i>that would strip the land
and starve their own herds.</i>



<i>They couldn't domesticate them,
so they destroyed them.</i>



<i>Isolated and hungry,
they were on their way</i>



<i>to disappearing
from the face of the earth.</i>



<i>Sometimes
when the light disappears,</i>



<i>an afterimage remains,</i>



<i>just for a moment.</i>



<i>Mustangs are an afterimage
of the West,</i>



<i>no better than ghosts,
hardly there at all.</i>



<i>No one really wants them,</i>



<i>not ranchers, not city people.</i>



<i>That's their destiny.</i>



<i>Let them disappear
once and for all,</i>



<i>along with all
the other misfits, loners</i>



<i>and relics of a wilderness
no one cares about anymore.</i>



<i>Lucky for us,
a few mustangs survived,</i>



<i>hidden away in the mountains.</i>



<i>We need to protect them,</i>



<i>for they are the hope
for some kind of living memory</i>



<i>of what the promise of America
used to be...</i>



<i>and could be again.</i>



Whoa.



Don't say anything.



Just get on.



Come on.



When the kids were little,
I'd tuck 'em in



and say, “I'll love you
till the mountains tumble down.”



Right now, I feel like



they could blow away
at any second.



Before Dad died,



he asked me if I wanted
to sell the ranch and...



Take the money.



I said, “Over my dead body.



No way, no how.”



I thought that's what
he wanted me to say.



But, no, he... he seemed
almost disappointed.



He... he said he felt
like that he was giving me



something that didn't
make any sense anymore.



Maybe he's right.



But then I...
I see these kids,



they're hanging out
in the mall,



they're sullen, they're lazy.



Got no ambition, got no dreams.



This is the only
way that I know



how to save our children.



Honey, Howard
doesn't need saving.



He'll be fine wherever he goes.



But Katy, honey,
we could lose her.



She's... smart and she's strong,
but she can't survive out there.



Our daughter lives
in a fantasyland.



So do you.



Look at you, sitting on top
of cowboy mountain



looking down at the world
passing by.



When are you gonna look
at your daughter



and realize that she's you?



And that's why
I love her so much.



They want to go
to the rodeo, you know?



She wants to see Flicka.



Yeah.



They expect me to say no.



Yep.



I bet I'd really blow
their minds if I said yes.



Then they'd see how diabolical
I can really be.



You are such a bad boy.



I love it.



Race me back?



Let's go. Come on.



Come on, Belle.



Last one back's naked first.



Hyah!



I'm gonna win!



Yeah, right!



Gotcha!



Want to go swimming?



No, thanks.



It's a thousand degrees
in here.



I'm busy.



You really want to go swimming.



What's he gonna say?



Well, that's his problem.



I'm gonna go see
if the coast is clear.



Mom!



Nobody's home.



Let's go.



Are you sure about this?



Hey, we'll be back
before anybody even knows.



Come on.



I'm hot.
Are you hot?



Oh, yeah.



Oh, yeah!



Miranda?



Close your eyes, cowgirl!



What's going on?



Well, somebody tell me.



Miranda saw Flicka.



Where?



At the fairgrounds when I
was practicing the course.



How did she look?



What?



I've never, ever



been scared around horses,
not in my entire life,



but those horses
that she was with...



What?
Don't stop. Tell me.



You'd really have to work hard
to make horses that angry.



Listen, I'm sorry, Katy.



I just thought
you'd want to hear.



The cowboys in that race are crazy.



But they say the purse
is over $8,000.



Oh, money's no good if you're dead.



I can win that race.



My demented sister is even
more demented than I thought.



Riders get to choose
their horses, right?



Yeah.



I choose Flicka, I win.



If you can stay on her.



I can.



You're too young to enter.



You're not.



Bad idea.



Brilliant idea.



If I buy Flicka back
with the prize money,



she won't be Dad's horse anymore,
she'll be mine.



And if she wins,
someone'll want her foal.



That's money in my pocket.



And if he tries to sell
our land, I'll buy that, too.



Whoa, whoa, Katy, she is
way too dangerous to ride.



Maybe for you but not for me.



I only have to stay on her
for a few seconds.



I've already done that.



Miranda?



Oh...



The people have spoken.



No, the inmates have
taken over the asylum.



Come on, let's see you
walk it like you talk it.



Drown me, please.



Hey! Hey!



Whoa! Whoa!



Oof! That aftershave'll
scare the livestock.



Oh. But the ladies
find it reassuring.



Yeah, it let's 'em know
I'm sensitive,



not just a... sexy beast.



Can we get going?



Oh, Jack, you stink.



Busted.



Let's go! Come on!



I'm coming!



Well, what'll it be
tonight, boys,



crazy eights or canasta?



Canasta it is.



Ladies and gentlemen,



welcome
to the Red Gulch Roundup!



Now, for those of you
that may be visiting



our beautiful state
for the first time,



welcome to Wyoming!



In our grand entry today,



our flags are being carried
by Miss Rodeo America



and her lovely assistant.



And all of our beauty
a-horseback.



Now in the center



of the arena is the world
champion trick roper,



Mr. Gene McLaughlin!



They say in every cowboy's life,
he gets a...



Good horse, a good woman
and a good loop.



All right, folks,
it's rodeo time,



but it seems that Miss Rodeo
America needs my assistance...



Aw, honey, how could you
eat that stuff?



It makes me sweeter.



You're already sweet.



There she is!



...the barrel race!



All right, ladies, cowgirl up.



Mm, mm, mm.



Introducing our next
barrel racer, Miranda Koop.



Come on, baby!



Here she comes around



the first barrel.



Quick.



Another great run.



Coming to the third barrel...



Out she goes.



That's okay.



That's okay.



Hyah, hyah!



She's mine, boys.



Katy, I'm scared.



I'm not, not even a little.



What do you think?



I think I should be
the voice of reason.



We're runnin' out of time.



Hold on.



You need gum.



Yeah, okay.



Wait here.



Here's your receipt.
Good luck to you, partner.



- Thank you, sir.
- You bet.



How you doing, Norbert?



Oh, what you say, Wagner?



- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hiya, Norbert.



Can I help you?



Yeah, uh, I want to register.



For an event.



You gonna tell me which one,
or do I have to read your mind?



The wild horse race.



Wild horse race.



That takes a team of two.



Mm-hmm.
That's my partner.



Outside.



That little bitty feller?



Good luck.



I need $50.



Yes, sir.



Fifty.



Gotta sign this waiver.



Right there.



Report to the corral.



Pick yourself out a hoss.



- Here you are, darling.
- Thank you.



The event rolls at 5:00 p. M. sharp.
Here's your receipt.



Thank you.



And if you come to your senses
and want to back out...



You lose every penny.



Good luck.



It's okay, Flicka.



Doggone, Billy!



Hey, get outta there,
you lunatic!



You choose your horse
like everybody else,



or you can take a hike!



Do the rules say you can put
a baby cradle on a horse?



Quiet down!



All right, gather 'round, boys.



Shout 'em out.



Fourth team takes
the black filly.



Son, you just lost a race.



That horse is truly loco.



Boys, next time
you see your horse,



it'll be in the ring,
trying to run you over.



All right, now.



Good luck!



Ladies and gentlemen,
and cowboys...



The wild horse race
is about to start.



Now, if you've got
a weak heart...



Hey!



- Kick some cowboy ass.
- Thanks.



...or you just ate
a big meal, I suggest you...



Don't you dare get hurt.



Dang! Norbert.



You know what we say to our
first group of riders...



Welcome to our...



Do you think he recognized us?



- I don't know.
- Let's bring 'em in!



Come on.



Now, direct your attention
to the chutes.



That ain't no earthquake
beneath your feet.



That's wild horses
coming at you.



Look at those crazy devils.



They've never been saddled,
never haltered.



Angrier than a cowboy
who just totaled his pickup.



Here's how it works.



In a few moments the horses...



- No way.
- What?



Are you freaking crazy?!



Just try and stop me.



...the boys have gotta grab
'em, saddle 'em,



then ride 'em
between a pair of barrels,



and any rider
that stays on that long...



Your group's up next.



...wins $8,000.



- I'm giving my number back.
- Go ahead.



So, let's bring in
the first set of victims.



I mean, cowboys.



Team number one, this is



Jimmy Miles and John Bull.



Team number two, the Eggan boys.



Second generation,
Wade and Trace Eggan.



Team number three- Chris Fadey
and Big John Slim.



And this next team of kids,
they are so green,



they've got moss
oozing out of their pores...



- Hi, Norbert. How are you?
- Well, well, well.



Hi, how are you?



Guess you changed your mind
about mustangs, didn't you?



Come again?



Well, you're here
to see your boy



ride that wild horse,
aren't you?



- My boy?
- Howard?



Yeah.



What are you talking about?



Well, he's up now.



Where is he?
I'm gonna kill him.



- Follow me.
- Where's Miranda?



I don't believe this.



...the first four teams...



Riders, get ready.



Here we go.



Don't let anybody back out,
boys. Your life's on the line.



Let's go for it.



Ten...



Nine...



Eight...



Seven...



Six...



Five... four...



Three...



Two...



One...



Aw, let her rip, boys!



Get back, Loretta.
Here they come.



Four of the toughest broncs
you're ever gonna see.



Remember,
one man's gonna give chase;



One's gonna try
to get him saddled.



You see this black filly,
number 14...



She is out of control.



- Get her! Get her!
- Whoa!



That's a bad old girl to have
to deal with in this dance.



Them boys got more
than they bargained for,



taking that horse.



Now this is the height
of insanity...



We've got a man on right here.



Almost on.



Oh, my Lord, my mother
could've rode better than that.



Two riders up,
one still unsaddled.



Heads up, boys!



Oh, that is not the recommended
way to dismount a wild horse.



This is insane.



There it is, on the far side.



Take a chance,
put your life on the line.



Dropped him like a two-ton rock,
split him like a $2 suitcase.



He's wide open,
and he is all done.



Flicka!



Boy, I hope one of these guys
wins this thing...



Easy, girl.



Hey.



I see Howard.



...the last time we see...



It's Katy.



Oh, my God.



Rob! Rob!



Lookee here!



Some lunatic just jumped
out of the VIP section.



He's here.



What's he doing
in the middle of the arena?!



- Look!
- I'm an idiot.



He's never gonna
let me keep her.



-Just win.
- It won't make any difference to him.



- He doesn't want either of us.
- Let go!



Look at that crazy fool, this guy is still at it.



Where is he going?!
What's going on?



Katy, let go.



Ya... come on.



Look a-here,
jumped on bareback.



What in the world is going on?



I'm gonna set you free, girl.
Hyah!



Ladies and gentlemen, number 14...
is gonna be the winner.



Katy!



14, folks,



is not stopping at the barrels.



I've never seen anything
like this in my life.



I've been watching this
for 40 years.



So, call the state troopers
in Wyoming.



He's headed for Cheyenne.



I don't think he can stop
that black filly.



I don't know what to do.



Where do we go, Flicka?



Nothing you can do.



What'd they say?



Can't get a helicopter
here till morning.



Boys lost the trail.



Probably won't be able to pick
it up again till daylight.



- Norbert, gimme a horse.
- Two horses.



Y'all need to calm down.



No, we're not gonna calm down
till we find our daughter.



She'll go home.



No, honey, she can't.



Not in the mountains,
not in the dark.



Not Katy- Flicka.



Hey, our mountains
are her home, too.



You're right.
Let's go.



When we get back to the ranch,
we're riding out.



Weather's coming in.



This is our creek, isn't it?



You brought us back.



Thank you, girl.



Let's go home.
Come on.



What is it?



What is it, girl?



What is it, girl? Huh?



It's okay, girl.



It's okay.



It's okay, girl.



Come on.



Come on, it's okay.



No!



No!



Get away from her!



No!



Flicka!



Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.



God! Get up.



Oh, God.



Oh, my God.



Flicka, get up, please.



Get up!



Somebody help me!



Get up!



Get up, please!



- Hyah! Hyah!
- Let's go.



- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah!



Hyah!



I'll search the ridge.



I'll take the south meadow. Katy!



I'm gonna check the creek.



You should go back.



Not a chance.



Katy!



Katy!



Katy!



Katy!



Aah...



Oh!



Katy?



Oh, baby.



It's gonna be okay, baby.



Daddy's got you.
Come on.



Dad... the lion got her.



You're gonna be all right, baby.



It's all right.



Flicka.



Is she all right?



Find Jack.
Go to the creek.



That horse is hurt bad.



<i>A hundred and two.</i>



I don't know if it's accurate.
It's an old thermometer.



No.



The doctor can't land
in the storm.



So... no.
So, we'll wait.



Okay.



What do I look for?



A hundred and five.



Can that be right?



Howard, get some more ice, son.



Flicka!



Flicka!



What's Katy's shirt
doing around her neck?



She tried to stop the bleeding.



Oh, she's cut deep.



We ought to take away her pain.



You gonna shoot her?



What do you think?



How bad's the horse?



Go back and put her down.



She'll hear the shot.



She'll think it's thunder.



No, she won't.



Look, Katy's smart.



She sees things...



Little details
most people ignore...



The ones that make
a difference.



She'll know it's Flicka.



I can't let that animal suffer.



I'll do it myself.



- Dad?
- Don't.



I'm sorry.



I really screwed up.



Look at me.



You're a good man.



Yes, sir.



Now, you stay with your mother.



Yes, sir.



Are you gonna kill Flicka?



I'm just gonna have
a look at her, baby.



It's okay, Daddy.



You can shoot us.



Katy!



It's okay, baby.
It's okay.



Damn!



Flicka!



Shh!



It's okay.



Dang it.



Oh, dear God.



Oh...



Oh, look at her.



It was a lion.



There's no good reason
she's alive.



There's a very good reason
she's alive.



She's got mustang blood in her.



She's a fighter...



Just like our girl.



Don't worry.



The doctors will be
here in the morning.



Let's get her to the barn.



Come on, sweetie.



Come on, Flicka.



Come on, honey.



The day you were born...



...and they gave you to me...



...I felt my hands were
too rough to hold you.



And you cried
no matter what we did...



...but your mom said
that that was a good sign.



You were strong.



That wasn't much comfort
when I was holding you



and pacing back and forth
all night.



All you did was look at me
with those big, beautiful eyes.



I made all kinds
of promises to you



if you would just go to sleep.



Katy...



I forgot to keep
those promises...



...and I'm sorry.



Do you forgive me?



I'll tell you every day
how proud I am of you



and how proud I am
that you're my daughter.



Just stay with me...



Please.



Daddy.



Her fever's broke.



I want to see Flicka.



No, it's okay, sweetheart.



Oh, babe...



Katy, can you come downstairs
for a minute?



It's my fault Flicka's dead.



I don't think so.



Come on outside.



Flicka!



Baby!



You're alive.



It's going
to be okay now, okay?



Aw...



Your mother's been taking
good care of her...



But when you're better,



I expect you to take
care of her yourself.



But you said if I don't get
back into school...



Yes, that's what I said,
and I meant it.



So Dad sent them your essay.



I told them I didn't know much
about writing,



but I sure as heck
know about the West.



So does my daughter,



and it's right there
in her essay...



Every opinionated,



ornery, hot-blooded
part of it.



What did they say?



What does anyone say
to your father?



“Yes, sir.”



I love you, Daddy.



I love you, sweetie.



<i>I believe there is a force</i>



<i>in this world that lives
beneath the surface...</i>



<i>something primitive and wild
that awakens</i>



<i>when you need an extra push
just to survive...</i>



<i>...like wildflowers that bloom</i>



<i>after a fire turns
the forest black.</i>



<i>Most people are afraid of it</i>



<i>and keep it buried
deep inside themselves.</i>



<i>But there will always be
a few people</i>



<i>who have the courage to love
what is untamed inside us.</i>



<i>One of those men...</i>



<i>...is my father.</i>



<i>There was once a time</i>



<i>when Americans came west
to discover their destiny.</i>



<i>Today, they seem to move
around every which where,</i>



<i>restless and unsettled...</i>



<i>but I think they're still
looking for the same thing-</i>



<i>a place where they can be
optimistic about the future,</i>



<i>a place that helps them to be
who they really want to be...</i>



<i>...where they can feel
that this life makes sense...</i>



<i>...a place where they can feel</i>



<i>what I feel
when I am riding Flicka.</i>



<i>'Cause when we're riding,
all I feel...</i>



<i>...is free.</i>
