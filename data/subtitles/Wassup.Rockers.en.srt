1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
D

2
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:47,357
<i> what is your frame?
Is your frame? </ I></i>

3
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,565
<i> - My frame ...
- Do you have a 200? </ I></i>

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,162
<i>Yes  Do not come any closer than that. </ I></i>

5
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,079
My name is Jonathan Velasquez.
I have 14 years.

6
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:01,483
I turned 14 on ... May 5.

7
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:08,316
Also skate. We are forming a
band and I am a friend of the guitarist.

8
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:14,926
Also I have another friend, Rico.

9
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:18,526
Turned 14 last Sunday.

10
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,845
He also skates.

11
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:24,796
And also ...

12
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:29,760
Rico's brother.
His name is Carlos.

13
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:34,600
He is 16, and skating ...

14
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:37,406
... But not much because it has
a little overweight.

15
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,076
Sperm is also Bola.

16
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:46,035
His name is Milton Velasquez,
but no one called that.

17
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:49,956
They call Sperm Ball.
My brother gave him that nickname ...

18
00:01:50,447 --> 00:01:53,644
... When we met, because
we met before ...

19
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:56,725
... Than others.

20
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:00,957
So ... also ...

21
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:04,396
I guess he likes
masturbating because ...

22
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:09,118
... Each time you shower
masturbating ...

23
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:11,926
... And shows us how they
sex mother and father.

24
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,402
And then he laughs ...

25
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:17,684
... And then insults in Spanish.
That's funny.

26
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:22,084
Robert's brother is Porky,
is also 16.

27
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:27,325
Is addicted to pornography.

28
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:31,719
Is said to Porky
liked a girl ...

29
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:34,043
... But she liked another boy ...

30
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:38,075
Porky ... then angry.
And then tried to commit suicide ...

31
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:40,756
... Drowning in the toilet.

32
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:43,879
But then, when he ran out of air ...

33
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:47,084
... What he did was,
head out of sink ...

34
00:02:47,847 --> 00:02:50,281
... Took a deep breath and put
back into the water.

35
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:54,761
And when he was committing suicide,
opened the door and got angry.

36
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,040
Then going to choke to death ...

37
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:01,404
... And walked with a belt
hanging.

38
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:07,319
He started to eat
with a belt in the neck ...

39
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,637
... Because I wanted to commit suicide.

40
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,522
That's why.

41
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,158
And all because, supposedly,
the girl he liked ...

42
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:24,322
... I wanted to another subject,
named Frank, and then ...

43
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,282
... He wanted to kick his ass.

44
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,480
But he could not.

45
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:50,680
And that's all.

46
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:56,405
What other history
want to tell you?

47
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:12,401
WHAT TAL, Rock?

48
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:58,922
Hi, Mom.

49
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:49,846
Milton.

50
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,205
I'm sick.

51
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,958
You know what? I've heard
enough trash tonight.

52
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,165
Come on up.

53
00:08:57,047 --> 00:09:01,040
Carlos! Arise!
You must go to school!

54
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:04,921
What you're lazy!
Arise!

55
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:06,719
So what? I do not care.

56
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:15,479
Arise, Porky.

57
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:24,960
Hurry.

58
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:26,725
You're not even dressed.

59
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,317
- I'm already dressed.
- Fuck you.

60
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,763
You woke me me
and now you want me -

61
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,403
Hurry with the weights.

62
00:10:36,087 --> 00:10:37,520
Only five more.

63
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:42,004
You need a break.
I saw you doing sixty.

64
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,637
Hurry up, be late to school.

65
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:49,322
- To hell with the school.
- Not even you dressed!

66
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,638
Damn, I know.

67
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:57,524
For that invented
rooms behind.

68
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,360
He fell.

69
00:13:33,007 --> 00:13:34,884
Hey, what are you doing?

70
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,959
That's my ball, filthy Mexican!

71
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,836
I'll tell my brother
and you'll meet him.

72
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,441
- I'm from El Salvador.
- Who asked you to you?

73
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,563
Do they wear tight clothing?

74
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,281
Why? You want clothes?

75
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:52,041
Do you keep your testicles
in your pocket?

76
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,362
- I think so.
- In the pocket.

77
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,918
Would you like to hold?

78
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,765
It is the will, because
GPS are y. ..

79
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,443
... Will destroy. One
one the patearemos.

80
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,126
Fuck you.

81
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:06,444
Get off my street.

82
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,963
Go to eat their burritos
and Get out of my door.

83
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:15,324
I told them to go, or my brother
they all kick ass.

84
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:17,086
I do not care.

85
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,641
This is GPS and destroy
you all.

86
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:26,766
- GPS, honey.
- GPS will destroy you.

87
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:30,836
- I am of JPS.
- To hell with JPS.

88
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,606
Beware!

89
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,526
What?

90
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,436
You're a rocker, go to the devil.

91
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,924
To hell!

92
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:38,765
My God.

93
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:18,279
Let me ask you this
to see if it hurts.

94
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:26,835
- What is this? It is a kiss.
- What?

95
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:29,839
- Do you have a kiss mark?
- How could I have a?

96
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,364
Come on, Jonathan,
we leave!

97
00:16:35,487 --> 00:16:36,681
Come on, go!

98
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:43,923
We'll play in Gina's party
on Saturday night.

99
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:45,162
Tomorrow?

100
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:48,120
Yes, but will practice on my
home tonight. Can you come?

101
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,885
Do not think I can go.

102
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:53,079
Maybe I can go for a few moments
after going home.

103
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,239
Come at 4:30.

104
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,366
Here comes Rosalia.

105
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:50,241
- Hello, Jonathan.
- I go skating.

106
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:54,958
I think Jonathan
is very handsome.

107
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:57,557
Yes, but I have a girlfriend.

108
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:00,316
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

109
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,515
- Did they?
- No, but I wanted to.

110
00:18:57,607 --> 00:18:59,086
- Did not you?
- No.

111
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,079
- Why not?
- Do not want to take off my pants.

112
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:05,724
Dude, you're a fool.

113
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,677
The first time I did,
she was mad.

114
00:19:10,447 --> 00:19:13,041
You remember my girlfriend
the sixth grade?

115
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:17,965
He invited me to his house
after school.

116
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:21,519
I went to his house.
Not planned to do it ...

117
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:24,600
... But the situation arose,
and I took off my shirt first ...

118
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:27,076
... And I said, "Take off your shirt."

119
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,685
She wore two shirts,
and I had to take off ...

120
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:30,204
... Pants for her
take off another shirt.

121
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:33,319
And then I took off
clock and her bra ...

122
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:36,723
... I took off a sock,
and she took off her pants.

123
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:40,556
So we were in underwear
and remove us at once.

124
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,639
And then I rode it ...

125
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:47,036
... And tried to introduce
per half hour.

126
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,925
I could not find the hole.

127
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:51,800
He did it too low or too high ...

128
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:55,765
... And then found the hole
and pushed hard ...

129
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:58,158
... And she began to mourn.

130
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,444
But then you knew that
get her wet ...

131
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,196
... Before you take it.
My brother told me. "

132
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:07,922
And then I heard his sister
speak and thought that would come.

133
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,045
So I hid
behind the door naked ...

134
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:14,190
... And she kept looking at me
and ashamed.

135
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:17,760
I took the door key and returned
to bed under the covers ...

136
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:20,642
... And started making it again.

137
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:23,676
And then I heard the gate open ...

138
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:26,162
... And asked: "Did you hear that?".

139
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:28,599
She said: "Yes, my dad."

140
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:32,566
And to hear that
I ran away.

141
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:37,566
I jumped the fence to the neighbor's house ...

142
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:40,726
... And I walked.
I think his father saw me.

143
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,566
And then went home
and thought to call it ...

144
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:47,681
... But I was ashamed and did not go to
school for two weeks for that.

145
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:51,403
And when I went to school
and saw her, only said "hello."

146
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,561
- Do not worry, Bola Sperm.
- It's Milton, silly.

147
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:57,526
"Milton?

148
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,436
I do not want to call me
Sperm Ball.

149
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:02,199
My name is Milton.

150
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:04,366
Okay ...

151
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,966
Sperm ... Ball.

152
00:21:57,847 --> 00:21:59,758
He is a young heavy.

153
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,800
Where is Jonathan?

154
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,520
He had something to do.

155
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,398
- Are you okay?
- Yes

156
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:50,439
How unpleasant.

157
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,724
Yes, I turned too fast.

158
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,242
Faster! Faster!

159
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:37,406
The Gotcha!

160
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:20,118
- Let's make a duel of brothers.
- Let us do it!

161
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,039
Where are you from, brother?

162
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:30,875
This is bandit territory, silly.

163
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:39,200
Give me strong!
You want strong?

164
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:40,925
I will give you strong!

165
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:45,444
What messes with my legs
or is the destination path?

166
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:50,276
This brother always leaves me a son!

167
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,317
Do not stop! Do not stop!

168
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,723
- Way to go.
- I have a gift for you.

169
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,320
Do not stop!

170
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,001
Do not stop!

171
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,645
Merry Christmas!

172
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:18,837
They look like greyhounds
when put that way.

173
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:23,084
Try to look
like a hound dog.

174
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:27,476
- It has wings!
- Shake.

175
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:31,241
Enough,
give me my dog, my friend.

176
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,358
Doing that will kill him.

177
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,882
He has had lots of sex.

178
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:42,524
Cindy, go to Mom's bedroom.

179
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,082
- Damn it Johnson?
- Shut up.

180
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:50,005
Why you treat
your sister?

181
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,517
Always abusive.

182
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,435
- Where did you get that?
- Sperm Ball he stole.

183
00:27:59,607 --> 00:28:01,996
- I do not call it that.
- What's your name?

184
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:04,078
- Milton.
- What is the difference?

185
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:06,442
The girls they would
Sperm someone named Bola.

186
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:08,678
You think they would
someone named Milton?

187
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:14,717
Maybe not, but I will not
I call Sperm Ball.

188
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,564
My name is Milton.

189
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:27,358
Why do they call you
Sperm Ball?

190
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:31,006
I gave him that nickname because
One day he returned from school ...

191
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:35,046
... I do not know where it came from, but jumped
from behind the trash can ...

192
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,642
... And I said, "What's your name?".

193
00:28:37,727 --> 00:28:40,480
And I did not pay attention, and I saw
had pornography in his hand.

194
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,842
And I was about 11 years.

195
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:44,685
He was 12, silly.

196
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,799
Never mind, I was a kid
and very pale ...

197
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,326
... And because he had a
strange hair that day -

198
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,725
It was an African.

199
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:54,883
- His semen was red?
- Yes, all red!

200
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:59,195
He did not know his name ...

201
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:01,397
... So we call sperm ball.

202
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,637
I asked him to call me "Shake."

203
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:11,364
And we do not change Sperm Ball.

204
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:15,082
Jonathan, I must go.
My mother will be home.

205
00:29:15,207 --> 00:29:16,435
All right.

206
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:25,442
Rico!

207
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:33,562
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

208
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,126
- Bye.
- Bye.

209
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:17,800
This is mine.

210
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:40,160
"Hi, haters"!

211
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:43,966
What about that?

212
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:47,278
What about "Hi, haters"?

213
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:56,726
Who the hell hit you?

214
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:02,636
- I heard the music outside.
- You do not live near here.

215
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:07,080
Passed through here.
They have beer.

216
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,635
I like beer, makes me crazy.

217
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:11,240
I do not mess with girls.

218
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:22,765
Jonathan, do you want to do something?

219
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:24,406
No, I'm fine.

220
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,678
Want to go to the bedroom?

221
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:41,323
- Why would you think?
- Because everyone else did.

222
00:33:41,447 --> 00:33:42,641
That's right.

223
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,927
Rosalia and I remember when
we did the first time.

224
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,682
I was a virgin, and she
knew what he was doing.

225
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:57,397
He took advantage of that.
I felt used.

226
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:03,117
How many believe that
Rosalia has done?

227
00:34:03,287 --> 00:34:06,040
Fifteen, twenty.
Only 14 years old.

228
00:34:06,687 --> 00:34:08,723
Yes, I remember the time
he wanted to do with me ...

229
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:11,759
... And I said no because
not want to do with 18 subjects.

230
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:16,686
Gosh, my life sucks.

231
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:19,961
One day I went home
the best friend of my brother.

232
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,446
There was a girl named Gina
who liked me.

233
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:27,121
I was drunk
and fell asleep on the toilet.

234
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:29,559
She took off her pants.

235
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:31,962
I woke up and we were having sex ...

236
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:34,159
... And I had no condom.

237
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:38,361
Then people told me
who had become pregnant ...

238
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:43,122
... And I cried on the shoulder
a girl.

239
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,040
Gina told him he did not want
I had to do with the baby.

240
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,799
That was not my problem.

241
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:50,880
The devil.

242
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:53,722
Do you really think that got pregnant?

243
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:55,479
If you had sex, yes.

244
00:34:56,767 --> 00:35:00,316
That's my luck. My life sucks.

245
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,397
You like kinky sex, right?

246
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:07,756
She knows a lot. I do not like.

247
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:14,285
I would like to have sex
with this slut now.

248
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,526
Porky, and stop drinking ...

249
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,563
Because every time ...
you get drunk you cry ...

250
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:20,239
... And we listen.

251
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,125
Hell, I'll go somewhere
where they do not hear me mourn.

252
00:36:26,487 --> 00:36:29,126
Would you be angry if you
ask if you're a virgin?

253
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:32,359
No.

254
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:39,557
- I caught you now!
- Jonathan?

255
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,842
Jonathan, you're an envious!

256
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,758
Never succeed in doing so.

257
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:06,078
What are you doing?

258
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,044
What the hell is wrong with you, child?

259
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:10,443
You're stupid, man.

260
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,685
I have Danny's car.

261
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:29,999
He lent me the car.

262
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,040
Does the trunk open?

263
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:55,326
Come on, stupid. Close the door.

264
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,442
- Hello, Lily.
- Hello, Jonathan.

265
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:11,038
You will travel in the trunk.

266
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:15,675
What are you doing here?

267
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:18,446
I stayed at the home of Sandra.
I'm taking the bus.

268
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,400
We are going to Beverly Hills.
We can take if you want.

269
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:25,760
I do not know, there are many children
in the car do not know if it fits.

270
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:28,204
We can travel in the trunk.

271
00:38:58,647 --> 00:39:00,000
<i> Hey, do not stop. </ i></i>

272
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,637
All the girls like to Jonathan.

273
00:39:04,807 --> 00:39:06,559
That's right.

274
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:10,077
- Get all the girls.
- Honey, do you want a ride?

275
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,446
Never get sex
with this car.

276
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,837
Jonathan, how are you back there?

277
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,766
Jonathan! Have fun.

278
00:39:24,527 --> 00:39:27,200
There are some speed bumps,
Hang on to something.

279
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:37,322
Stop the car.

280
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,960
Turn it off.

281
00:39:45,207 --> 00:39:46,959
Hands-on view, gentlemen.

282
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,323
Relax. Hands down.

283
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:54,877
I stopped because your registration expired.

284
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:57,202
- Let your license.
- I have.

285
00:39:57,407 --> 00:39:58,920
- Do not have a license?
- No.

286
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:01,282
- Does anyone in the car is licensed?
- No.

287
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,725
- Do you know that we take the car?
- Yes, I know.

288
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:08,556
I suppose you are happy
have a car now.

289
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,245
Not for us.

290
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:12,757
It is faster than their bikes.

291
00:40:15,007 --> 00:40:16,918
Do you like The Ramones, child?

292
00:40:17,847 --> 00:40:20,281
They are great.
I saw them play in 1987.

293
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:23,280
- Yes? What was it?
- Great.

294
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:15,520
Here I am on myself.

295
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:32,803
This is boring.

296
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:36,602
- The bus is taking too long.
- I know! When will he come?

297
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:41,158
I have no sperm!

298
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:43,807
My wife is waiting for me!

299
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:46,317
I should have left
pregnant last night.

300
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:50,804
If not pregnant today
I cut the tomatoes!

301
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:52,919
He says they are dry!

302
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,202
It's going to break my ribs!

303
00:41:56,567 --> 00:41:57,966
Ten!

304
00:42:00,487 --> 00:42:01,840
Five!

305
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,920
- And then ...
- Will give you strong and ugly?

306
00:42:07,647 --> 00:42:10,286
- Will give you strong and ugly?
- Strong and ugly!

307
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,919
The break them all!

308
00:42:15,127 --> 00:42:17,083
They smell like shit!

309
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:22,046
- Porky, "turn it off?
- No, I went to the bath house today.

310
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:33,920
We did it!

311
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:41,521
Where's my shoe?

312
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:56,439
My damn finger!

313
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:00,519
Do you think it is broken?

314
00:45:57,407 --> 00:46:00,126
- Are you all right, Rico?
- My knee!

315
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:45,239
A good jump, Jonathan.

316
00:46:54,447 --> 00:46:55,880
Damn!

317
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:11,757
Look what a beautiful ass.

318
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:16,396
I would like to see him without pants.

319
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:30,961
Damn!

320
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:42,640
Heaven.

321
00:47:44,167 --> 00:47:45,680
Look.

322
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,523
- I like small.
- Does the child?

323
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:00,958
Full body and firm ass.

324
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,080
Hello.

325
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:17,877
- Where are they?
- In South Central.

326
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:19,446
We're from the ghetto.

327
00:48:21,087 --> 00:48:24,477
- You're a good skater.
- Today is not a good day.

328
00:48:26,527 --> 00:48:28,358
We live in Beverly Hills.

329
00:48:28,967 --> 00:48:32,277
My house is there.

330
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,204
You can come anytime.

331
00:48:35,727 --> 00:48:36,955
All right.

332
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:45,477
It has a pink font
and that red Thunderbird out.

333
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:50,802
Come whenever you want.

334
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:54,799
I'm serious.

335
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:00,961
Jade, come on. I see my
coach at 3:00.

336
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,320
- I said "we"!
- No need to pull it well.

337
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:11,046
- Have you talked to you, you fucking Mexican?
- I am Guatemalan.

338
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,078
Sorry, I Guate!

339
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,521
Goodbye.

340
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:24,446
- Bye.
- Bye, homosexuals.

341
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:11,965
Lincoln 1, I'm in
Beverly Hills high school.

342
00:50:12,047 --> 00:50:14,117
I have seven Hispanic
on skateboards.

343
00:50:27,127 --> 00:50:29,322
Boys, come here.

344
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:37,322
Come on.

345
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:43,276
Sitting with hands on knees,
for viewing. Go!

346
00:50:48,207 --> 00:50:50,801
- Did you see the signs?
- What signs?

347
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:53,117
- All of "No skating."
- Where?

348
00:50:55,287 --> 00:50:57,596
Hands on knees
for viewing.

349
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:05,284
What did we do?

350
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:09,846
Where are they?

351
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:11,840
In South Central.

352
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:13,685
We're from the ghetto.

353
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:15,838
What are you doing
in Beverly Hills?

354
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:18,239

429
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:07,718
- They do not belong to this place.
- Why are we in South Central?

00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:10,645
- Yes
- Fuck you.

431
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,924
"Come here! Sit!

Leave!

438
00:55:37,887 --> 00:55:39,764
This burger tastes like penis.

439
00:55:46,047 --> 00:55:47,321
Turn around!

440
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:52,680
Give me your hands!

441
00:55:54,287 --> 00:55:55,640
Stand still!

Standing!

444
01:00:20,527 --> 01:00:22,802
Here is where you live
the white girl.

445
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:24,406
That's not the house.

446
01:00:24,527 --> 01:00:27,087
Yes, the source looks rosy
and the red car.

447
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,640
It's home.

448
01:00:57,967 --> 01:01:00,117
I found it. Go ahead.

449
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:37,761
- Hello. Are you thirsty?
- Yes, I have thirst.

450
01:01:37,887 --> 01:01:40,401

- Want to see my room?
- Yes

452
01:02:32,047 --> 01:02:34,845
Drinks.

453
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:42,596
- I can see your room?
- Come on.

454
01:02:59,287 --> 01:03:01,118
You are not circumcised.

455
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:04,680
No, I'm Latino.
Why? Does it look different?

456
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:08,885
It looks dangerous.

457
01:03:22,287 --> 01:03:24,437
Are you wealthy?
How can you afford this?

458
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:29,245
- My father.
- What does your father do?

459
01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:32,643
- Do not know.
- Great.

460
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:39,564
Always on the phone
cell, plays golf and stuff.

461
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:41,360
That's it.

462
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:44,155
- What's yours?
- I have no father.

463
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:47,324
- Have you ever met your father?
- No

464
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:50,163
I have one brother and my mother.

465
01:03:50,647 --> 01:03:52,444
Do you have good relationship
with them?

466
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:56,126
- Good how?
- I do not know ...

467
01:03:56,247 --> 01:03:59,000
... Good ...
Do you talk to them ...

468
01:03:59,807 --> 01:04:02,082
- ... Or do things as a family?
- No.

469
01:04:02,687 --> 01:04:04,120
We are brothers.

470
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,117
Do you have good relationship with
the boys who are you?

471
01:04:12,727 --> 01:04:14,638
No, only friends.

472
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,286
- Why not?
- Because I am not gay.

473
01:04:19,247 --> 01:04:22,398
In good standing
not mean they are gay.

474
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:25,759
Are they best friends?

475
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,483
No, we call best friends.

476
01:04:28,887 --> 01:04:30,605
We are all equal.

477
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:32,644
How so?

478
01:04:33,727 --> 01:04:36,002
- We are all equal.
- Equal how?

479
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,323
We are different, but we are equal.

480
01:04:38,324 --> 01:04:40,479
I can not say that a
only my best friend.

481
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:43,198
We're just friends.

482
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:48,400
And your friends?

483
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:52,320
They're all alike ...

484
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:54,916
... Like you said. But they are -

485
01:04:55,327 --> 01:04:58,080
It is difficult to know who
your true friends.

486
01:04:58,887 --> 01:05:00,525
Why?

487
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:03,719
They are hypocrites.
I stabbed in the back.

488
01:05:04,607 --> 01:05:06,165
Why?

489
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:10,517
I do not know. It's a good question.

490
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:14,566
You get used and are
things in Beverly Hills.

491
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:16,286
Where are you?

492
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:21,164
- Living in the ghetto.
- What do you mean by that?

493
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:23,966
- In South Central.
- How is this place?

494
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:26,800
Dangerous. Can not
walk the street alone.

495
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:28,559
Steal or attack you.

496
01:05:28,647 --> 01:05:31,525
He's a menace.

497
01:05:33,327 --> 01:05:34,919
What madness.

498
01:05:35,087 --> 01:05:36,839
Why come here?

499
01:05:37,087 --> 01:05:39,760
To skate where we met.

500
01:05:40,087 --> 01:05:42,317
Did you come here
just to skate?

501
01:05:48,887 --> 01:05:52,323
- Always use this?
- Yes, I never take it off.

502
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:54,204
Look at your hair.

503
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:59,082
- What is wrong with my hair?
- Nothing, but covers your face.

504
01:05:59,887 --> 01:06:02,162
- Here you go.
- Yes

505
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:06,237
- It's funny.
- What?

506
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:09,481
You are different from boys
I know.

507
01:06:10,727 --> 01:06:13,002
Do you care much
what people think of you?

508
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:14,600
No. ..

509
01:06:14,847 --> 01:06:17,407
... I do things
my way and the way I like.

510
01:06:17,647 --> 01:06:19,558
Nobody tells me what to do.

511
01:06:19,687 --> 01:06:22,759
Yes, you have your own style.
That's great.

512
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:27,157
- What would you say?
- We are called rockers.

513
01:06:27,647 --> 01:06:31,401
Think we are rockers
why we use the long hair ...

514
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,762
... And the pants and tight clothes.

515
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:40,004
And we do not care, but we
say: "What, rock?".

516
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:44,317
- They say, "What, rock?".
- Yes

517
01:06:44,927 --> 01:06:47,885
We get angry because of that,
we are not rockers.

518
01:06:48,127 --> 01:06:51,278
But we do not fight.

519
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,921
They are the ones who fight.

520
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:57,442
- What kind of people?
- Black people.

521
01:06:57,607 --> 01:07:00,167
- Really?
- They want to be like them.

522
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,442
And when black girls
play with your hair or something ...

523
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,396
... Want to braid
or something ...

524
01:07:08,247 --> 01:07:09,441
... I do not allow
touch my hair.

525
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,636
Why?

526
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,683
It may be dirty.

527
01:07:13,527 --> 01:07:15,563
Too bad.

528
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:17,600
They are bad with us
we are bad with them.

529
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:22,523
Heavens, no one gets along
where you live.

530
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:24,320
No.

531
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:26,557
Have you ever fought with someone?

532
01:07:26,687 --> 01:07:28,518
- Many times.
- Why?

533
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:32,357
They spur you on,
you say you are gay or something ...

534
01:07:32,567 --> 01:07:35,525
Abofetearte want ... or something ...

535
01:07:36,047 --> 01:07:38,242
... Play with you.

536
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:42,517
Just because you use
tight pants?

537
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,363
"They're used to that?

538
01:07:45,487 --> 01:07:48,559
Something like that always fight
or are in trouble.

539
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:51,122
Do your friends always support you?

540
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,835
- What do you mean?
- Can you help?

541
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:56,720
Yes, we help,
so we are friends.

542
01:07:57,367 --> 01:08:00,279
They won many fights Yes
or lost a lot?

543
01:08:00,407 --> 01:08:04,116
I do not know, but I never
I lost a fight or something.

544
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:07,962
"Or something"? Probably
struck it with your skateboard.

545
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:09,464
I never hit a
anyone with my skateboard.

546
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:10,761
Really?

547
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:14,245
I do not want to kill anyone.

548
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:19,959
We did not win the fights,
but not hit us or anything.

549
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:24,284
- Did you ever fight?
- No. ..

550
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,166
... There is nothing why
fight. Actually it is ...

551
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:30,760
... But people do not
likes to do that.

552
01:08:31,327 --> 01:08:34,000
Here we fight them ...

553
01:08:34,367 --> 01:08:38,042
... And some are calm because
although the hit ...

554
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:41,523
... Want to keep fighting, at least
want to hit you once.

555
01:08:42,207 --> 01:08:44,118
What if you hit the first time?

556
01:08:44,247 --> 01:08:47,284
They will continue trying.
But some stops.

557
01:08:47,527 --> 01:08:50,644
They learn the lesson
they can not conquer.

558
01:08:53,487 --> 01:08:55,637
That's the way there.

559
01:08:56,767 --> 01:08:59,440
My friend died two days ago.

560
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:03,796
Near my house, a street.
- Did he die? How?

561
01:09:03,927 --> 01:09:07,124
- I shot.
- Are you shot? You saw him?

562
01:09:07,247 --> 01:09:09,522
- No.
- Are you sad?

563
01:09:09,647 --> 01:09:11,922
Yes, it was great.

564
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,043
What is the worst thing you've seen?

565
01:09:15,287 --> 01:09:17,204
For someone when you
shot in the head.

566
01:09:17,205 --> 01:09:19,121
Really? Heaven.

567
01:09:20,847 --> 01:09:23,486
- What did you do?
- I ran.

568
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:26,082
Do we run?
How close were you?

569
01:09:26,527 --> 01:09:28,597
Nearby, about 6 meters.

570
01:09:28,767 --> 01:09:32,203
Did you know the victim?
Who was he?

571
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,365
A subject.

572
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:36,086
Are you sad?

573
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:38,000
I do not know.

574
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:42,284
Is all well there?
"Except for you?

575
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:46,045
- It's a complicated place.
- Why?

576
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:48,442
Because they always try
cause problems.

577
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:51,035
And then bring their families.

578
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:55,725
And when the family comes
everyone says we encourage you ...

579
01:09:56,207 --> 01:09:59,756
... Because we are problem ...

580
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:02,917
... And it is they who incite.

581
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,601
You know how mothers,
believe them to their children.

582
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,640
So things are.

583
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:11,840
Heaven.

584
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:46,483
You can take the
pants, if you want.

585
01:12:11,647 --> 01:12:13,797
- What the hell?
- Damn! What is this?

586
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:15,440
Leave him alone!

587
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:17,439
Let me go, you bastards!

588
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:27,000
Rico!

589
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:38,326
Damn!

590
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:43,839
No! Basta!

591
01:13:43,727 --> 01:13:45,285
Call the police!

592
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:54,646
My nose!

593
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:03,035
Go!

594
01:15:55,967 --> 01:15:57,320
Damn!

595
01:16:28,207 --> 01:16:30,118
Just give me five minutes.

596
01:16:30,207 --> 01:16:31,606
There are many white girls.

597
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:47,515
Hello.

598
01:16:50,487 --> 01:16:52,842
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

599
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:54,725
What's your name?

600
01:16:55,047 --> 01:16:56,321
Kico.

601
01:16:56,527 --> 01:16:57,846
Kico.

602
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:04,245
- Where are you, Rico?
- I'm from the ghetto.

603
01:17:04,807 --> 01:17:07,526
You're so adorable. Look.

604
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,764
You are so punk rockers.

605
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:24,443
They are like the Mexican Ramones.

606
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:26,398
That's great, I love it.

607
01:17:26,527 --> 01:17:28,040
Do you speak English?

608
01:17:29,567 --> 01:17:31,717
What is this garbage watermelon?

609
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,281
And these damn cookies.
This is very gay.

610
01:17:34,407 --> 01:17:36,523
- Okay.
- I drink whiskey, I can not -

611
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:38,877
Now shut up.

612
01:17:39,007 --> 01:17:42,636
So are Marina and Alex
Theme parties are always ...

613
01:17:42,767 --> 01:17:44,564
Boring ... blah, blah, blah.

614
01:17:44,687 --> 01:17:48,999
Yes, I do not like anything
what is happening.

615
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:52,602
- I am more than New York style.
- You look like on both coasts.

616
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:05,565
Hello!

617
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,644
Beautiful! Smile!

618
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:15,923
Thank you. Think pink.

619
01:18:16,207 --> 01:18:18,675
Hello, you look beautiful.
Hello! Hi, Sarah!

620
01:18:35,887 --> 01:18:37,400
We listen to Madonna.

621
01:18:38,807 --> 01:18:41,446
Perfect! Will my new
advertising campaign!

622
01:18:42,647 --> 01:18:45,036
Luce hurt, someone to do something.

623
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,646
No, thanks.

624
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,165
Got health?

625
01:19:03,127 --> 01:19:05,402
I have six medics,
a pool and jacuzzi.

626
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:07,284
I'll show you.

627
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:48,925
Sorry about the mess.

628
01:19:51,767 --> 01:19:53,598
These are my works.

629
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:56,840
You know, you could be a model.

630
01:19:57,007 --> 01:20:00,522
I'm too thin.
I urinate.

631
01:20:08,047 --> 01:20:09,605
Over here, honey.

632
01:20:16,287 --> 01:20:17,686
Sorry.

633
01:22:09,087 --> 01:22:11,237
I return with my friends.

634
01:22:14,967 --> 01:22:17,117
Just trying to help
your career.

635
01:22:17,727 --> 01:22:19,445
My what?

636
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:30,441
What the hell?

637
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:45,121
Louie!

638
01:24:20,407 --> 01:24:23,558
- How many?
- Six, wearing a mask.

639
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:27,363
You know my policy: Shoot
first and ask questions later.

640
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:29,717
They were boys of color,
so naturally ...

641
01:24:30,847 --> 01:24:32,246
I understand.

642
01:24:32,327 --> 01:24:34,477
We must keep this quiet ...

643
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:36,159
... Away from newspapers.

644
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:38,478
It would be great news
for them.

645
01:24:38,567 --> 01:24:41,286
Unofficially
is a Mexican child ...

646
01:24:41,367 --> 01:24:43,676
... Probably illegal, illegal.

647
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:45,447
I will ensure that
smoothly.

648
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:46,727
Very good.

649
01:24:58,367 --> 01:25:01,643
Ten years ago, working in Beverly
Hills, we know these things quiet.

650
01:25:02,407 --> 01:25:05,080
I like many movies.
I am a great admirer.

651
01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:01,804
What do you think happened to Louie?

652
01:26:02,727 --> 01:26:06,163
We jumped the wall
and heard the shot.

653
01:26:11,007 --> 01:26:14,158
It's a bad job. We lost
two friends in one day.

654
01:26:16,647 --> 01:26:18,319
I'm tired of being here.

655
01:26:19,887 --> 01:26:21,559
I too, want to go home.

656
01:26:21,887 --> 01:26:23,843
Is it wrong ...

657
01:26:29,887 --> 01:26:31,843
... Left behind a friend.

658
01:26:32,087 --> 01:26:34,237
We leave it to a friend!

659
01:26:34,807 --> 01:26:38,117
- We could have died.!
- I know, but let a friend.

660
01:26:39,687 --> 01:26:41,757
We could not do anything.

661
01:26:43,647 --> 01:26:45,319
I hate this place.

662
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:49,201
We ran as women.
It was like a brother.

663
01:26:49,367 --> 01:26:52,165
Do not even know
what happened.

664
01:26:52,247 --> 01:26:55,478
Maybe he's dead, maybe
is good, but is injured.

665
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:58,001
I do not think he is okay.

666
01:27:01,127 --> 01:27:03,595
Here, no one can help.

667
01:27:03,967 --> 01:27:06,686
No one is going to help.

668
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:10,760
Damn white, provided
believe they are better.

669
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:14,437
Better than we who
are Hispanic and poor.

670
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:18,758
It is very cold. We have nothing.

671
01:27:19,247 --> 01:27:20,999
What now?

672
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:23,557
We must find
way back home.

673
01:27:23,647 --> 01:27:25,160
How? Where are we?

674
01:27:25,247 --> 01:27:27,841
We should be in the middle
from nothing, damn.

675
01:27:28,007 --> 01:27:30,123
We go home.

676
01:27:30,207 --> 01:27:31,845
I do not know how to get there.

677
01:27:34,687 --> 01:27:37,042
I have hunger and cold, walk.

678
01:27:37,327 --> 01:27:39,795
Let us move or we will be here
overnight.

679
01:28:59,607 --> 01:29:02,838
- Hello, we are lost.
- Everybody is looking for them, guys.

680
01:29:03,687 --> 01:29:06,599
We get them out of here before
that the police find them.

681
01:29:09,887 --> 01:29:12,481
I know. I'll call Manuel.

682
01:29:12,607 --> 01:29:16,122
You take care of them.

683
01:29:16,247 --> 01:29:18,715
- Okay.
- Escóndanse! Here comes the lady.

684
01:29:21,967 --> 01:29:23,685
Do not worry.

685
01:29:26,167 --> 01:29:28,727
- Who is this child?
- From my sister.

686
01:29:28,807 --> 01:29:31,275
I'm sorry, madam,
I know how I found it.

687
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:33,318
What a handsome boy.

688
01:29:34,807 --> 01:29:38,880
With a face like that
you have lots of sex.

689
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:41,999
With sex as this must
have a face ... I mean -

690
01:29:42,287 --> 01:29:45,438
With that face, there are many girls.

691
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,446
When?

692
01:29:49,327 --> 01:29:50,965
I do not know.

693
01:29:51,167 --> 01:29:52,680
What happened?

694
01:29:52,967 --> 01:29:54,958
Look at that beautiful ass. What happened?

695
01:29:55,047 --> 01:29:57,766
- A dog.
- Damn dogs!

696
01:29:58,327 --> 01:30:01,683
If you you take care of dinner ...

697
01:30:01,767 --> 01:30:04,327
... I take care of you.

698
01:30:04,447 --> 01:30:07,519
Come with me.
Come in, honey.

699
01:30:47,607 --> 01:30:49,518
Take a bit.

700
01:30:54,727 --> 01:30:56,479
It's fun to be neat.

701
01:30:57,127 --> 01:30:58,879
It's fun to be neat.

702
01:30:59,007 --> 01:31:00,918
I'm having so much fun.

703
01:31:18,007 --> 01:31:19,440
- Where is Rico?
- We must go.

704
01:31:19,527 --> 01:31:21,119
- No time.
- Not without Kico.

705
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:34,326
Stop looking at my
bust it forever ...

706
01:31:34,327 --> 01:31:35,725
... I look at the bust, you see
what I mean?

707
01:31:36,807 --> 01:31:39,560
- Yes, ma'am.
- "Yes, ma'am"?

708
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:45,044
Go! We must leave!

709
01:31:46,327 --> 01:31:50,161
Jonathan, ever the same.
Damn, envious.

710
01:33:46,967 --> 01:33:48,804
What?

711
01:33:48,805 --> 01:33:50,642
I think this is
where my mom.

712
01:33:51,247 --> 01:33:53,477
- Do you have a car?
- I can drive.

713
01:33:53,607 --> 01:33:55,245
Must be of age.

714
01:33:55,367 --> 01:33:57,642
- No, no.
- Let me in!

715
01:33:58,167 --> 01:33:59,964
"I can help?

716
01:34:02,567 --> 01:34:05,286
- Back, friends, should be higher.
- Mom!

717
01:34:05,567 --> 01:34:07,125
Mom! Mom!

718
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:10,643
- Back we go.
- What's your name?

719
01:34:11,447 --> 01:34:13,483
- Nina.
- He left.

720
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:16,246
She said her son did not return last night.

721
01:34:17,207 --> 01:34:18,765
One minute!

722
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:48,765
Where are you?

723
01:40:48,847 --> 01:40:50,326
From anywhere.

724
01:40:50,487 --> 01:40:52,762
Why are you wearing clothes so tight?

725
01:40:53,527 --> 01:40:55,597
Because we do not care
what you think.

726
01:40:55,727 --> 01:40:57,046
Sure.

727
01:41:05,567 --> 01:41:07,558
What, rock?

728
01:41:50,847 --> 01:41:53,202
Goodbye, Ball Semen.
I mean, Milton.

729
01:41:54,967 --> 01:41:56,195
Milton.

730
01:41:56,767 --> 01:41:58,962
Milton.
