2
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,593
Mr. Kurtainbaum,

3
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,862
why did you decide to continue production
on "The Game of Death"?

4
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,870
I feel I personally owe it to Bruce
to finish this picture.

5
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,372
This was his passion project,

6
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,500
his statement to the world.

7
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,771
This was his "Gone with the Wind".

8
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:23,544
Ronney, how do you plan on
completing the movie without its star?

9
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,074
You see, we are going to do
a worldwide search

10
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:31,613
for the man who will literally
be stepping into Bruce Lee's shoes

11
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,955
to complete his performance.

12
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:39,090
Ronney, won't it be obvious
that it's someone else playing Bruce Lee?

13
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:43,363
Film reality, my man,
it's made in the editing room, you know?

14
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,065
Eisenstein, you know,
he taught us that with associative editing,

15
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,370
and that was 50 years ago.

16
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,138
We're only limited
by our own imaginations.

17
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,914
We meet again, Bob.

18
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,179
Yeah.

19
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,354
I knew you were a snake,
Leroy Jackson.

20
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,255
Yeah.

21
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,820
Well, it doesn't matter
because I will destroy both of you.

22
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,334
Have you met
my sirens of fury?

23
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,361
Oh, you've joined the Nazi Party.

24
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,919
Poor birds.

25
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,726
I feel sorry for all of you
in the afterlife.

26
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,291
Ninjas!

27
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:32,907
Aaargh!

28
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,579
You know, I really don't know why
people keep confusing me and Bruce.

29
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,143
I mean, seriously,
we are two totally different actors.

30
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,921
Yes, but...
don't you see the obvious similarities?

31
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,421
Look, the cat wears
a yellow jumpsuit on the big screen,

32
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:56,935
I'm always wearing a blue one.
He's Bruce Lee, I'm Breeze Loo.

33
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,063
It's kind of like Pepsi and Coke.
I can guarantee one thing -

34
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,166
anyone who's taken that Pepsi Challenge
can definitely taste the difference.

35
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,236
Is it true
you don't do your own fighting?

36
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:11,306
That's correct.
I mean, why should I, right? I'm an actor.

37
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:15,377
There's a name for actors that do
their own fighting. They're called stuntmen.

38
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,721
To me, acting's all right here,
in the eyes.

39
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,590
What do you think
of Bruce Lee's acting?

40
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,130
You know,
I wouldn't really know.

41
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,462
I've never seen any of his films.

42
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,160
Really?

43
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:34,730
Come on, I've done 14 films in
the last two years. I've been a little busy.

44
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:39,506
Why are you
entertaining the idea of finishing his film?

45
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,515
The cat and I are peers.
I figure if I was the one who passed early,

46
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,814
I hope he'd have done
the same for me.

47
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,217
Yes, master.

48
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,486
Would you like another?
What do you think?

49
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,959
- I think that was pretty good.
- I liked that one. You sure?

50
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:00,864
- I asked Saraghina to be my manager.
- Yeah, but I'm still his lady.

51
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,130
It's the ultimate when you get to
work with someone you love.

52
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,536
Yeah, yeah.
I'd do anything for Cole.

53
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,474
What is it
you are doing at these studios?

54
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,841
Well...

55
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,210
You go first, honey.

56
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,739
Well, I'm here to be in
my first Hollywood movie.

57
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,150
- I feel really blessed.
- Yeah, yeah.

58
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,018
I was at this swap meet
and I found this flyer

59
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,686
that said that "The Trombone Thief Part 3"
was needing someone to play the butler.

60
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,698
I only have one line, but I think it's a big
deal because they're already on part three.

61
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,860
Yeah, plus this gives us momentum
to go into "The Game of Death".

62
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,804
- It's a perfect career move.
- Cole Kim, we need you on the set now.

63
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,440
You look great.
You look great.

64
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,978
OK.

65
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,037
Best butler ever.

66
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,956
- I think it's one of those European films.
- Yeah, maybe.

67
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,171
- You do golden showers?
- Um...

68
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,334
I-I'm Cole Kim.
I-I-I'm playing the butler.

69
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,811
Well, go change into your butler outfit
and sit outside the door.

70
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,407
As I'm humping the blonde
and chomping on the Oriental's furburger,

71
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,044
look through the peephole
and whack off, OK?

72
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,987
- Go. Wardrobe.
- Whack off?

73
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,390
Yes, whack off.
The fucky-sucky is reserved for me.

74
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,826
Daylight, come on.

75
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,887
- Change.
- Forget you.

76
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,427
Amateurs.

77
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,800
Get me another butler, OK?
Quickly.

78
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,672
Aim low. I want to see the hardcore. If you
don't see the hardcore, don't shoot. OK...

79
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,109
And... action.

80
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:00,041
Now stick it right in her ass.
That's it. A little deeper.

81
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,947
Bend over.

82
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,014
Please.

83
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,587
Oh, that's...

84
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,656
that's great.

85
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,562
Today's my first day as a doctor.

86
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:22,870
Seven years of schooling,
three years as a resident.

87
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:29,612
Today's my last day as a doctor.
I'm quitting to become an actor.

88
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,877
I'm a little confused.

89
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,010
For as long as I can remember,

90
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,351
I've always wanted to be a ninja,
or an actor.

91
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,291
So then why did you choose
to go into the medical field?

92
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,793
Um...

93
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,492
When I was 15,
my mom got ill.

94
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,794
Before she died,
she asked me for one thing -

95
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,064
to become a doctor.

96
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,165
Today I've fulfilled
that promise to her.

97
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,235
And tomorrow
I try to fulfill my promise to myself.

98
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:06,309
Do you think she intended
that when she asked you to be a doctor?

99
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,785
I kept a promise.

100
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,655
That's all I can say.

101
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,786
So how do you intend
to jump into the industry

102
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,957
after all these years
of medical school?

103
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:25,436
You know, I've done my best to incorporate
my theater training into my medical career.

104
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,538
Very good, Victor,
but it's more like a groan from below.

105
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,010
Right,
and you're having a kidney stone,

106
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:43,147
so the pain is in your lower abdomen
or groin. Try again.

107
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:47,716
As an intern, I came up with the idea
to work with actors as patients

108
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:51,627
so that med-school students
could have real people to diagnose.

109
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,790
Sort of like community theater,

110
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,959
except everyone's sick.

111
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,400
All the time.

112
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,200
How about film experience?

113
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,505
I've done some film work
here and there.

114
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,738
I got to work as a stunt double.

115
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:11,511
I've even worked as Breeze Loo's
stunt double a couple of times.

116
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,685
It's not exactly
what I want to do, but...

117
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:20,783
I get to combine two things I love the most -
acting and martial arts.

118
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,091
Addey, Addey,

119
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,193
Addey, Addey, Addey.

120
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,999
Hi, kids!

121
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,097
Hi, Addey!

122
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,268
Do you know
what my name is?

123
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,006
Addey the Astro-duck!

124
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,877
Say it again!

125
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:47,318
I was hired by NASA's outreach division to
raise awareness about the Skylab project

126
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,854
and the space race
against the Russians.

127
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:53,358
I make public appearances
as Addey the Astro-duck

128
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,224
and they treat me like a king.

129
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,058
Especially moms.

130
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,588
Is space exploration
an important issue for you?

131
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,330
Actually, no. I think there are
far bigger problems here on Earth

132
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,531
and here in this country.

133
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,667
- Can you elaborate on that?
- Racism for one.

134
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,304
Our people have been oppressed
for far too long.

135
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,371
- Really?
- Yeah.

136
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,907
There have been no reparations
for the abuse our people suffered

137
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:23,422
building the railroads
in the 1860s.

138
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:27,516
That's just the tip
of the proverbial iceberg.

139
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,618
But, Tarrick, um...

140
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:32,630
aren't you Caucasian?

141
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,757
I'm half Chinese.

142
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,427
So, um...
so, Tarrick,

143
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,871
why do you want to audition
for The Game of Death?

144
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:46,241
I admire Bruce Lee as a role model
for the Asiatic community.

145
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:52,410
I try to be the same. Maybe my work is on
a smaller, more humble, grass-roots level,

146
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,216
but I think that reaching out
to promote the yellow brotherhood

147
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,155
certainly has its place.

148
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,254
Do you really feel like
you have a shot at getting the part?

149
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,529
Nothing has ever been given to me.
My life has been a continual struggle.

150
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,936
It's that very struggle
that fuels my art.

151
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,375
You call me "slanty eyes."

152
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:24,405
I stay silent. But my eyes
can see the damage being done to me.

153
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,646
# Railroad worker

154
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,878
# Railroad worker

155
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,024
Emasculated half-man.

156
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,259
I don't deny there's a piece of me
long-dead on the tracks.

157
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,632
But I am railroaded every day.

158
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,899
Tracked and trapped.

159
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,475
But never defeated.

160
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,206
Never defeated.

161
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,808
But also...

162
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,849
never free!

163
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,209
Let's face it, leading men and ladies
are white. You can't deny it.

164
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,048
But what about the people they visit,
the ones they encounter?

165
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,918
The noble savages,
the angry Pygmies,

166
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,584
the exotic geishas
and the street thugs.

167
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,093
All of them?
Colored folks.

168
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,859
And when I say "colored,"
I mean all colors.

169
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,924
Hollywood needs these colors
to paint their pictures.

170
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,835
And I'm the one
who delivers the variety.

171
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:58,905
I represent Latinos,
Orientals and Afro-Americans.

172
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:03,608
Hell, I even got clients
who are Afro-Latinos and Latin-Orientals.

173
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,809
You want 'em, I got 'em.

174
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,383
Some of my clients
have even stepped into the spotlight

175
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,787
and made a real name
for themselves,

176
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,758
courtesy of Roy Thunder.

177
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,464
Clear. Go!

178
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,693
Just relax.

179
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,722
Troy Poon was the costar
of a hit primetime TV show.

180
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,665
Chang.

181
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,704
Bring this clown
down to the squad car.

182
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:03,230
Hey, man,
I ain't gonna do your laundry.

183
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,244
"Hey, man,
I ain't gonna do your laundry."

184
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,507
Troy's tag line swept the nation.

185
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,049
J.J. Walker had nothing on him.

186
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,204
Wow.

187
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,366
It's Rob Force.

188
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,969
You know, the last time we met,
you had the gun to my head.

189
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,536
I should have shot you
when I had the chance.

190
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,413
Woulda, coulda, shoulda,
Robbie.

191
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,282
Any last requests?

192
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,057
Hey, Chang, why don't you send for
someone to pick up this rotting corpse?

193
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,761
Hey.

194
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,304
I ain't gonna do your laundry.

195
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,808
- You know what I like about you, Chang?
- What?

196
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,673
Absolutely nothing.

197
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,913
It was the highest-rated show
in the country on Friday nights.

198
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,318
But after only nine episodes,

199
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,380
something horrible happened.

200
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:30,759
Dean Silo, best known for his
role as tough-talking detective Rob Force,

201
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,855
was found dead early this morning
in his Beverly Hills home.

202
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,197
I'm here on the scene
with Officer Williams.

203
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,760
Officer Williams,
when did Dean Silo pass away?

204
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:45,071
Well, the preliminary report put the time
of death at approximately 3:37 a.m.

205
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,602
And the circumstances
surrounding his demise?

206
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,514
Well, based on the position
of the body of the deceased

207
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,676
and several pieces of evidence,

208
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:57,688
it appears that Mr. Silo
was in the midst of self-asphyxiation

209
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,317
and attempted autofellatio
at the time of death.

210
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,384
Thank you, Officer Williams.

211
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:07,694
Traces of several substances
were found in, on or around the body,

212
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:12,863
including amphetamine, morphine,
Dramamine, codeine, Sizzlean, quinine,

213
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:17,307
Quaaludes, pre-ludes, mescaline,
methadone, metha-dust, angel dust,

214
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,901
Mercocet, Percocet, Darvocet,

215
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,777
Roxicet, Vicodin,
OxyContin, tin,

216
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,043
LSD, CPC, PYT,

217
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,143
amphetamines, barbiturates
and Elmer's Glue.

218
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,782
Also, several male juvenile
pornographic magazines

219
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,884
and a giant Nazi flag
were strewn around the body,

220
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:41,558
and the deceased was wearing
a Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard's outfit.

221
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,602
Needless to say,
Troy's show got canceled,

222
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,401
and all the networks
refused to air the reruns.

223
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,887
For me, a job in sales
is the same as an acting gig.

224
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,222
You know,
I mean, it really is.

225
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,727
The only difference is you, um...

226
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:14,391
you're performing
in front of a smaller crowd.

227
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,403
Hello, how are you?
My name is Troy Poon.

228
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,906
Do you have a moment?
I'd like to show you a great product.

229
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,568
Aren't you...?

230
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,738
A-a-aren't you...?

231
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,151
Aren't you that guy?
Th-the one on the television?

232
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,779
- Yes, yes, that's me.
- Oh!

233
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,255
Do you have a moment?
I'd like to show you the...

234
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,884
Why not?

235
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,758
- Don't mind the mess.
- The more mess, the better.

236
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,821
That's what this thing is for.

237
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,868
And as you can see,
the MegaVac cleaning machine

238
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:53,132
is extremely simple
to put together.

239
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,073
See? I mean,
it doesn't get any better than this.

240
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,074
It's beautiful.

241
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,376
Its sucking power is unrivalled.

242
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,408
Oopsie!

243
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,216
Let's see how the new MegaVac
cleaning machine handles the job.

244
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:14,123
Sorry to interrupt,
but could you say it?

245
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:18,129
- Excuse me?
- That little thing you say about the laundry.

246
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,223
Please say it for us,
just once?

247
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,461
- Cheese!
- Me, me, me!

248
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,470
- Go, go, go.
- Ready? OK, here we go.

249
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,803
Ready?
Everybody, "Cheese!"

250
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,427
Well, hello!
There are quite a lot of you here...

251
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,302
So today
is the first day of your auditions.

252
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,347
What are you experiencing
right now?

253
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,646
I imagine this is how Godard felt
when he was casting "Breathless ".

254
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,280
Yeah, yeah.
But on to the new Bruce Lee.

255
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,756
So, I' m thinking...
Here's what I'm thinking.

256
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,692
A loud, intimidating type,
like a... like a...

257
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:26,094
like a hip Genghis Khan,
you know?

258
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:31,228
Well, he needs to be the silent, calm type
with an inner strength.

259
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,828
Oh, yeah. Of course.
Well, that's what I meant.

260
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,069
You know, I don't mean "loud"
in, like, a volume sort of way,

261
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,201
like, "I'm Bruce Lee,"
screaming.

262
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,611
I meant that he has
an intense internal power.

263
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,014
Ronney... When you work with
these young directors,

264
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,780
you very often have to
give them what they need,

265
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,049
even though
they're not aware they need it.

266
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:56,220
You know, 90% of filmmaking,
it's the casting.

267
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,856
So this is the time
to lend my support to a young director.

268
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,026
You know, give him
my years of experience. Right now.

269
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,939
Well,
I love open auditions.

270
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,307
All bets are off
and anything is possible.

271
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,438
You never know when you might discover
the next Pat Morita

272
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,109
or the new Esther Rolle.

273
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,889
You got a great look.

274
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,952
Great look.

275
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,862
Roy Thunder, talent manager.

276
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,528
"Colored people"?

277
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,594
Last time I checked,

278
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,071
yellow was a color, my man.

279
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,212
The casting process isn't about
which of us is better than the other

280
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,980
or who's more right for the part.

281
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,250
Honestly, it all comes down to
covering your bases.

282
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,314
For example,
I happen to know

283
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,587
Cassie thinks I'm a great lay.

284
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,153
She rode me for six days last summer,
I got a spot on "Sanford and Son."

285
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,495
Now, that may be a coincidence,

286
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,264
but I'm not willing to
take the chance that it was.

287
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,741
You are the best in the room.

288
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,005
You are filled with strength

289
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,205
and power.

290
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,182
But all around you is weakness

291
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,184
and insecurity.

292
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:34,182
They are afraid of you because
they all know that the part is yours.

293
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:39,254
Open your eyes
and look at them.

294
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,526
Really look at them.

295
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,763
They're weak.

296
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,840
Weak.

297
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,002
Hey, is...

298
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,740
Hey, I think that's Breeze Loo.

299
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,945
Cole? Cole,
you're disrupting my exercise.

300
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,646
- But it's Breeze Loo!
- Who cares? You're Cole Kim.

301
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,485
- I gotta go meet him.
- Well, he's the competition.

302
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,855
But he's Breeze Loo!

303
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,960
Solid, baby. Solid.
Peace.

304
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,557
- Hey, Mr. Loo.
- Hey, brother.

305
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,297
- My name is Cole Kim and I'm a big fan.
- Very cool.

306
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,740
Yeah, I love Fist of Führer and
I've seen Exit the Serpent, like, 17 times.

307
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,178
- Oh, that's a lot of times, brother.
- And your moves, they're, like, flawless.

308
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,012
Yeah, how do you kick three guys
at the same time?

309
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,348
Oh. Saraghina,

310
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,614
Mr. Breeze Loo.

311
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:41,523
It was like he was sleeping
with the enemy. I couldn't believe it.

312
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:45,058
Oh, I didn't think it was a big deal.
He was a nice guy.

313
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,999
It made you soft.

314
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,298
- It made you lose your edge.
- Edge?

315
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,670
Yeah, you asked him
to autograph your shirt.

316
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,574
Well, what else
was he supposed to sign?

317
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,440
Cole, come on.

318
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:04,915
Look, imagine you saw Warren Beatty.
I mean, what would you do?

319
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,545
OK, Breeze Loo
is no Warren Beatty.

320
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,114
He can beat up three guys
at the same time.

321
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,421
Oh, Reggie!

322
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,758
How you doin', baby?

323
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:23,028
This cat makes me look real good
on the big screen, don't you, Reg?

324
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,436
Hey, baby.
I'm here to see the director.

325
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,033
Oh, great.
Um, your name is...?

326
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,245
It's Loo. Breeze Loo.

327
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,275
OK, all right.

328
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,583
Oh.
OK. Mr. Loo.

329
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,956
You are in group C, so it's gonna be
about an hour before we send you guys in.

330
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa, kitty cat.

331
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,565
I ain't here to audition.
I'm here to meet the director.

332
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,895
Oh.

333
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,528
You know,
the director is unavailable right now, so...

334
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,734
what I can do
is I can put you into group A.

335
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:10,542
- Do you mind if I use your phone?
- Of course. We have a pay phone outside.

336
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,553
One of your current clients
will be auditioning.

337
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,491
Oh, Troy.
I got him this amazing opportunity.

338
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,052
Not the usual Oriental bit part.

339
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,328
I'm talking leading yellow role
in a film with serious distribution.

340
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,893
That's like Nixon visiting me in Watts.
It just don't happen, baby.

341
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,804
- Thunder, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, Troy.

342
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,605
- Hey, now.
- We got this dynamite interview going.

343
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,737
Troy, look...

344
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:46,612
- Man, we're... Look, Troy...
- Thunder, listen to me.

345
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:50,382
Why, huh?
Why did you send me here?

346
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:54,824
- It's a big part.
- This is not a part. It's a body-double gig.

347
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,555
But it's an opportunity.

348
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,258
I... I can't believe
you're actually trying to sell me on this.

349
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,496
Look, Troy, come on, man.
Look what's out there.

350
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,231
You don't wanna go back
to playing delivery boys.

351
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,297
No, of course not.
But this?

352
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,608
This is even more insulting.

353
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,106
Troy, what have you got to lose?

354
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,318
You know what?

355
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:27,415
You ain't doing shit
for colored people, Thunder.

356
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,619
Troy, hold it, man.
Look.

357
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,893
You're making a big mistake.

358
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,097
Yeah.

359
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,841
- Big mistake.
- OK!

360
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,110
OK!

361
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,211
OK, hello, everyone.

362
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,547
Hi.

363
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,419
Hello... Don't stand behind me.
Thanks so much. Over there.

364
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:04,087
Hi, everyone. I wanted to welcome you
to the auditions for The Game of Death.

365
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,598
My name is Eloise.
I am the casting director.

366
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,066
This is Ronney.
He's the director of the film.

367
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:14,162
I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate
you being here today.

368
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,232
I'm very grateful and I appreciate
your time and patience. Absolutely.

369
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,778
So, look, to find the best man
for the role, guys,

370
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,939
we are going to have
three rounds of auditions.

371
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:27,610
Not six, three.
It's just so you can all see this.

372
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:31,087
OK, and it's gonna be
a really, really fun process.

373
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,420
So how about,
just to kick it off,

374
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:39,191
raise your hand if you have
formal conservatory training

375
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,097
with an emphasis
on Shakespeare.

376
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,329
- Wow. That is...
- Good for you.

377
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,202
Very good for you.
I love the classics. Excellent.

378
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,505
How about all of you eager people
with your hands up in the air

379
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,546
can follow Cassie here
right out that door?

380
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,174
Thank you so much.

381
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:03,812
It's pretty simple. I have found over the
years that actors with all of that training,

382
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,857
they spend so much time
connecting to their inner truth,

383
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,452
they don't connect to the average
moviegoer, you know what I mean?

384
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:15,022
And our Bruce Lee needs to be the kind
of guy Middle America can really relate to.

385
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,732
Someone... someone like Larry in Omaha
would drink a Bud with.

386
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:26,334
You know what I mean? The last thing we
need is some educated, snooty Bruce Lee

387
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:28,743
to alienate America.

388
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,804
Right, Ronney?

389
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,807
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

390
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:38,448
So what's gonna be
happening during today's audition?

391
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:42,516
Well, today, in this round,
we give the actors sides -

392
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,189
these pages right here
with basically their lines on them.

393
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:49,062
And, um...
it's a cold reading today,

394
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,602
meaning the actors
have never seen the lines.

395
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:57,438
Specifically, what qualities
are you looking for from these gentlemen?

396
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:01,502
Well, it depends on the person.
Everyone brings something different,

397
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:06,448
but I would like to see the relationship
between the text and the subtext.

398
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:11,353
It's very important what an actor brings in
on his own, which is in-between the lines,

399
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,984
but what he also does
with the text, you know?

400
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,120
You offended me.

401
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,191
You offended my family.

402
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,067
Great. Thank you.

403
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,570
My name Remi Nguyen.

404
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,010
I would like very much
to be part of your movie.

405
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:47,082
In my village in Vietnam, I dreamed of
being on the big Hollywood movie screen.

406
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,627
My parents, they would be
proud to see me that way.

407
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,161
But they didn't make it
out of Saigon.

408
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,298
I dedicate this to them.

409
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,941
OK. Let's get started.

410
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,148
You offend me.

411
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,242
You offend my family.

412
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,249
That was nice.
Can I give him a note?

413
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,451
Can you try it one more time?

414
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:27,089
But I want you to think about
your family stuck in Saigon.

415
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,465
You offended me.
You offended my family.

416
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,905
You have offended me!

417
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,569
You have offended my family!

418
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,236
You offended me.

419
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:46,882
You offended my family!

420
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,886
You offended me
and you offended my family.

421
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,856
Hi-yaaah! Whoo!

422
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,416
Can we lose the glasses?
I'd really like to see...

423
00:29:56,494 --> 00:30:00,328
I wouldn't bother. I think he's just bad.
I think he's just... I think...

424
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,131
I think you're not ready for this.
I don't... Let's not... Let's move on.

425
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,677
You offended me.

426
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,876
You offended my family.

427
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,744
Mm-hm.

428
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,950
Can you hold on one second?

429
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,949
I think
we should ask him to do a move,

430
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,929
see if we can inspire
some more aggression.

431
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,329
- Is that all right?
- Oh, yeah.

432
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,927
OK. Maybe just to get
a little bit more voice out of you...

433
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:44,134
I see the outfit. Do you know a little karate,
a little jujitsu or something?

434
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,878
I do.

435
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:53,942
Would you mind... Maybe you can say
the line, this time doing some type of move.

436
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,626
You offended me.

437
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,365
You offended my family.

438
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,838
- Better.
- Way better.

439
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,568
- A lot better.
- Way better.

440
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,641
- There he is.
- Here I am.

441
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,875
- The man.
- You look great, Breeze.

442
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,007
- Do I?
- Yeah, you look fantastic.

443
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,348
Thank you, brother.
Thank you.

444
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,047
- I have a question, though.
- Shoot.

445
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:34,614
- You are a powerful agency.
- That's the word in the street.

446
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,661
You cats are in the Hollywood big three,
am I not right?

447
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,459
- Number one in the big three.
- Wow.

448
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:45,298
- That must mean you have a lot of muscle.
- Might makes right.

449
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,897
How many feature films have I starred in
in, let's say, past two years?

450
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,238
- 14.
- Wow! You cats remembered.

451
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,778
Of course.
You're a star, Breezy.

452
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,837
Oh, stop that. Stop.

453
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,940
- Just the truth, man.
- Thank you.

454
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,043
- But I'm a bit confused.
- Why is that?

455
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,419
If you cats
are such a powerful agency

456
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,924
and I'm such a big star,

457
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,758
then why the fuck am I standing here
like a motherfucking idiot

458
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,559
at this goddamn
motherfucking cattle call?

459
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,998
There must've been
some sort of mix-up.

460
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,468
- A little confusion, that's all.
- Confusion?

461
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,438
What is so fucking confusing
about offer-only?

462
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,738
- We'll straighten it up.
- Do you know how humiliating this is?

463
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,041
I can only imagine.
It's awful. It's awful.

464
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,411
Breezy.

465
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,578
I know this place, it's like
a concentration camp, it's beneath you...

466
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,781
It's offer-only, you dig?

467
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,689
You got it.
Trust me, I'll take care of this.

468
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,125
Let's take care of this, fellas.

469
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,461
- It's done.
- Good.

470
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:51,434
I thought
he was completely contrived.

471
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:58,333
He had no subtext, you know?
There were no layers.

472
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,468
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
I don't disagree.

473
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:04,709
I completely hear what you're saying.
He's not a very strong "actor," you know,

474
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:09,583
but as I understand it, we're looking for
a star, not an "actor," you know?

475
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,350
And, I mean,
they're completely different animals.

476
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:18,293
For star searching, I think it comes down to
something more immediate and visceral.

477
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,354
- Like what?
- Fuckability.

478
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,366
I simply ask myself,
"Do I want to fuck that guy?"

479
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:26,870
Since we're looking for the new Bruce Lee,
the question should be:

480
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,805
"Do I need to fuck this guy?"

481
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,833
- You know?
- Give me an example.

482
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:36,004
- Charlton Heston.
- Are you serious?

483
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,608
Oh, yeah. How do you think he got to be
Moses, Ben-Hur, the guy with the apes?

484
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,779
The world wants to fuck
Charlton Heston.

485
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,557
This guy, here,
he's no Charlton Heston, but I'd fuck him.

486
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:53,461
After a few gin and tonics,
I would fuck him silly.

487
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,227
I mean,
he deserves a callback for sure.

488
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,600
All right, well, who...
who in this group would you fuck sober?

489
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,473
Hm. Sober.

490
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,304
Yeah.

491
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,606
Ooh, him.

492
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,839
Him? A star?

493
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:14,044
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?
Charisma, sensitivity, presence.

494
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:18,748
He's got that, you know,
refugee survivor grit. Yeah.

495
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,348
Oh, and I would...
I'd fuck him good.

496
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,987
I mean, look, I'm not saying he'd be
a Steve McQueen kind of movie star,

497
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:30,194
but, you know,
he's got Gene Hackman potential for sure.

498
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,533
Oh, yeah.
I'd fuck him.

499
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,037
- Right?
- All right.

500
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,098
So who would you fuck,
unconditionally?

501
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,239
Unconditionally...

502
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,142
So is someone gonna say,
like, "action"?

503
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,617
- Would you like that?
- If you like it.

504
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,313
- Sure.
- I will.

505
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,585
This is Ronney, the director.
So he's gonna call "action."

506
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,149
- Thank you.
- OK.

507
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,288
Action.

508
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,390
You've offended me
and you've offended my family.

509
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,927
Cole, can I ask you to do it again?

510
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,302
Of course, sure.
Do you... I...

511
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,433
If you want me to change it around
or something, I can...

512
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,501
Could you wait one second?

513
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,139
I think
he needs to be more intense.

514
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,810
- Yeah. Yeah. Um, just...
- Maybe... Yeah, go ahead.

515
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,753
- Maybe a little more intensity.
- You seem happy that they offended you.

516
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,017
- You shouldn't...
- I'm happy to be here.

517
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,753
That's really nice
and we're thrilled to have you,

518
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:34,764
but, Cole, maybe a little, you know, anger.
Anger is hurt turned out.

519
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,801
I think...
I think maybe a little anger.

520
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,935
You've offended me
and you've offended my family.

521
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,000
- Oh...
- What?

522
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:53,039
Oh, come on. I mean, maybe if he had the
teensiest bit of confidence, but this guy?

523
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,813
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, no, I...

524
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:59,584
Yeah, I would still fuck him,
even without the confidence.

525
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,648
No, you think so,
but you wouldn't.

526
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:05,321
Oh, yes, I would.
I would. And...

527
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,159
he...

528
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,223
wouldn't have to
buy me dinner beforehand.

529
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,599
I would just... fuck him.

530
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,539
All right, Ronney, are you listening to
yourself? 'Cause now you just sound silly.

531
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,009
What? Who are you
to tell me who I wanna fuck?

532
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,681
No, you're totally right.
You're right.

533
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,483
You can want to fuck whoever you please
'cause you're the director.

534
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,887
Absolutely. I'm sorry.
You're right.

535
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,425
- It's OK.
- Mm-hm.

536
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,857
Hi!
I am so sorry, everyone.

537
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,799
I know you've been so patient.
Thank you for waiting.

538
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:48,862
We are finally ready, and before I put the
list up, I just want to congratulate all of you.

539
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,706
We saw some really wonderful
auditions today.

540
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:57,414
Congratulations.
Have a good night.

541
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,640
Excuse me.

542
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,715
Yeah! Yes!

543
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,619
All right!

544
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,051
I told you! I told you.

545
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,720
- Look.
- We made it?

546
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:32,913
So, Raja,
how do you feel right now?

547
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,986
All I can say is I did my best.

548
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,064
Do you think that you'll return
to your career in the medical field?

549
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:50,896
Probably not.

550
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:55,098
I heard Warner's
is doing a musical about Geronimo.

551
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:59,068
Maybe I could pass for an Indian.

552
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:13,949
So, Breeze, how often
do you get to relax like this near the pool?

553
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:20,591
You know what most people don't realize?
Being an actor is a 24-hour job, man.

554
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,395
Like right now, I'm working.

555
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,027
I'm taking the time
to fine-tune my appearance

556
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:30,540
in order to be that image that's
on the screen that's bigger than life, baby.

557
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:34,977
See, Breeze Loo isn't just the cat that
you see sitting in front of you right now.

558
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,981
No. Breeze Loo is an idea.

559
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:41,246
He's a force of nature
that includes each individual out there

560
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,688
that keeps that Breeze Loo juggernaut
alive and pumping.

561
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,452
I work very hard
at what it is that I do.

562
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:53,896
All I ask is for those individuals out there to
do the exact same thing - pull their weight.

563
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,592
That's why I fired my agents.

564
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,465
So, then,
what's your next career move?

565
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,370
I got the Bruce Lee audition tomorrow.

566
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,379
But what about your refusal
to audition and your "offer-only" policy?

567
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:14,043
I realized it's a bit premature for me to be
considering any offers at this point in time,

568
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:18,350
mainly because the producer and director
really don't know how much they need me.

569
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,186
So, I'm gonna go through
this audition process,

570
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:24,955
they're gonna see firsthand
how much better I am than the competition,

571
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,022
and then they're gonna pay the full price
of what the Breezy Breeze is worth.

572
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,728
$500,
that's what we paid for Breezy.

573
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:37,235
- We couldn't have children of our own.
- Oh, we certainly tried, but, uh...

574
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:42,143
Well, we got Breezy when we lost Penny,
and that was horrible.

575
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,775
Yeah. Yeah, Penny was
our cocker spaniel and she died and...

576
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:50,412
my wife was so upset,
so, uh...

577
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,516
to make her feel better,
we got Clarence.

578
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,685
- Breeze.
- Breeze.

579
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,893
$500, that's what it cost.

580
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,764
- Tom, don't talk prices.
- Why not? That was a lot of money then.

581
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:08,100
Well, Breezy certainly is
generous with us.

582
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,163
He gave us this house

583
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,438
and a big Cadillac
and all this art.

584
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:18,608
Oh, yeah, we sure as hell won't forget
what he looks like, that's for sure.

585
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:23,843
My dad fought in the Korean War.
That's where he met my mom and me.

586
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:28,085
Yeah, most guys, they would
have made the women leave the babies,

587
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,320
but not Cole's dad.

588
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,726
If not for him,
I never would've met Cole.

589
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:36,392
Yeah, we grew up in Alabama
where I was the only Asiatic

590
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,163
and Saraghina
was the only Colombian in town.

591
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,533
Mm.

592
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,868
We weren't very popular.

593
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,670
Yeah, if I got hit in the head
with a bottle,

594
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,007
I knew it was the white kids.

595
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:52,182
If it was a rock,
it was the black kids.

596
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:56,184
It all hurt the same.

597
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,881
We dreamed of leaving the South.

598
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:02,585
We even tried
getting rid of our Southern accents.

599
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,118
We'd sit around for hours,
talking like our favorite movie stars.

600
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,792
Mm-hm.
Mine was Grace Kelly.

601
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,059
Mr. Rogers.

602
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,167
Buddha never bowled!
He won't be bought and sold!

603
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,972
Buddha never bowled!
He won't be bought and sold!

604
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,181
Buddha never bowled!
He won't be bought and sold!

605
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,350
Buddha never bowled!
He won't be bought and sold!

606
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,577
Buddha never bowled!
He won't be bought and sold!

607
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,449
Buddha never bowled!
He won't be bought and sold!

608
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,852
Tarrick's always been very active,

609
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,987
just like his dad.

610
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,895
Many men abandon their families with
all sorts of pathetic excuses, but Derrick,

611
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,495
Tarrick's dad,
was in his own league.

612
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:54,675
First of all, he was a real narcissist. He
named his sons Garrick, Tarrick and Erick.

613
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,373
If we had girls,
what would he have named them?

614
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,848
Anyway,
the marriage didn't work out,

615
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,717
mainly because Derrick
was an abusive drunk.

616
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,278
I can't believe
I put up with that shit.

617
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:10,657
He moved to Cincinnati after the divorce.
I was relieved, to tell you the truth,

618
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:14,220
but to completely cut off all contact
with the kids, his own sons,

619
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,766
I mean, who does that?

620
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:22,238
He wanted a new family, fine, but guess
what he had the balls to name the kids?

621
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:26,174
Garrick, Tarrick and Erick, same goddamn
names in the same goddamn order.

622
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,234
Who does that?

623
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,476
I used to have meaty roles
that any actor would kill for.

624
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,113
I was entrusted to play characters
well beyond my age range

625
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,656
and from various walks of life.

626
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,923
But that was college.

627
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,258
Hey, man,
have you seen my brownies?

628
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,327
I saw them.

629
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,498
And then I ate them.

630
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:01,735
You what?
That's my evidence!

631
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,645
I don't know what to tell you, man.

632
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,013
The more I ate,
the hungrier I got.

633
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,587
- That will be 14.39.
- Yeah!

634
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,830
You know what?
You're nothing but a big...

635
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,099
Now, that's what I call
saved by the bell.

636
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,469
- Hi.
- That'll be 11.76.

637
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,304
Well, the good news is,

638
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:40,407
I've been in 12 feature films
and 23 TV shows.

639
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,783
OK, that will be...

640
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,323
...9.69.

641
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,986
And the bad news is,
every role except for one

642
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,461
was a Chinese
food delivery boy.

643
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:57,934
Last week,
I got a call from this agency.

644
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,061
They said they wanna represent me.

645
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,571
I mean,
this could be huge for my career.

646
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,076
- Gentlemen, this is Troy Poon.
- There you are.

647
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,304
They're one of the biggies.

648
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,837
Finally, representation with power.

649
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,440
They can fight
for my artistic integrity.

650
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:18,249
- Thank you for coming in. Appreciate it.
- It's good to be here.

651
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,416
- We think you're a movie star.
- So no more TV.

652
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,519
We are gonna
reintroduce you to the world in a big way.

653
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:28,394
I just got you a meeting
with this hip young director

654
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:31,559
who is starting
a major motion picture,

655
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,933
and he's looking for a yellow lead.

656
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:37,269
- This flick has a built-in audience.
- A lot of action.

657
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,777
- Some cool camera work.
- Groovy soundtrack.

658
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,108
We're talking
major opportunity.

659
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,205
You ever hear of Bruce Lee?

660
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,410
Anyway, he's hotter now
than when he was alive.

661
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,857
Imagine, getting to be Bruce Lee.

662
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,894
Right when it matters most.

663
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,134
What in the hell was that?

664
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,703
Huh?

665
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:19,142
Cole, why did you choose
Saraghina to be your manager?

666
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,377
When I told her
I was going to be an actor,

667
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,512
I think the idea of me
kissing other women upset her.

668
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:28,490
Well, I mean,
when you feel so strongly for someone,

669
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,724
it's hard to see them do something like that
with someone else.

670
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,233
What if there's
a kissing scene in The Game of Death?

671
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,462
Saraghina's gonna be
right there with me,

672
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:43,438
and she's gonna realize
it's not a big deal, right, hon?

673
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,308
How has
your relationship been affected

674
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,744
by your new
professional partnership?

675
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,306
It's been, um...
a bit challenging,

676
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:58,753
because as his girlfriend,
I try not to tell him what to do,

677
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,723
but as his manager,
I have to tell him what to do.

678
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,556
No, you don't.
We can figure it out together.

679
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,324
But I'm your manager.
You asked me to be your manager.

680
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,729
- I know.
- That's my job.

681
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,995
I'm doing my job.
What do you expect me to do?

682
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,264
You're doing a great job, honey.

683
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,001
No, I'm not.
You know, you don't even listen to me.

684
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:21,670
I'm trying to help you, but you're
running around getting autographs,

685
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:27,240
you're eating chili fries when you're
supposed to be fit and... I don't know.

686
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,047
- What? See?
- I wind up feeling like your mother.

687
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,520
- I'm listening, OK?
- Oh, baby.

688
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,525
I'm serious.
You're doing a great job, OK?

689
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,720
You're doing a great job.

690
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,765
Can you pass me a napkin?

691
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:07,152
So, round two, I thought, you know,
they all take karate classes and things,

692
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:11,058
so I needed something that was going to
separate the boys from the men.

693
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:13,119
Ten-hut!

694
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,289
Attention!

695
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,895
Give us one line facing front. Now!

696
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:25,499
So I thought Mac and TJ,
having had all that Vietnam experience,

697
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,942
you know, killing,
you know, babies

698
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:31,879
and running around
hurting civilian people,

699
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:34,611
I kinda feel like
they have a life experience

700
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:39,054
that is gonna lend a little, uh...
a little gutso to this process.

701
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:45,287
I understand we're here to help you
pretend to be real men. Is that right?

702
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,121
That's kinda funny to me.

703
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,726
'Cause on the battlefield,
you're either a shit bag or the real deal.

704
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,294
There's no mistaking the two.

705
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,136
See, the real men,
they march towards the danger,

706
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:04,147
and the shit bags, they stay back
'cause they never grew the balls to battle.

707
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:09,244
Tell you the truth,
you all look like shit bags to me.

708
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:15,781
But you'll get a chance to prove me wrong.
You will engage in one-on-one combat.

709
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,885
See if any of you
have any fight in you.

710
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:22,398
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir, sir!

711
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,058
Oh.

712
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,728
A military boy.

713
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,135
You serve for Uncle Sam?

714
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,374
N-no.

715
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,040
Fuckin' pussy.

716
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,877
Whoaaaa!

717
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,213
Who do we have here?

718
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,722
- What's your name, boy?
- Remi Nguyen.

719
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,383
"Nguyen."
Isn't that a commie name?

720
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:51,325
No, I fight the Vietcong!

721
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,665
Sneaky bastards, aren't they?

722
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,724
What's so funny, douche face?

723
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:01,600
- Nothing.
- Oh.

724
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,607
You think you're
something special, don't you?

725
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,176
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

726
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:11,305
We think it's sad
what America has come to.

727
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:15,542
All you pinko fuckin' hippies
taking our freedom for granted.

728
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,986
Mac here, he gave up his eye
for your freedom.

729
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:22,753
And you wanna know
how you showed your gratitude?

730
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:26,762
I said, do you wanna know
how you showed your gratitude?

731
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:31,096
You spit on us and burned our flag
after we went through hell for you.

732
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:34,262
Never knowing where the next bullet
was gonna come from.

733
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,830
Going into a village,
not knowing who to shoot, who to kill.

734
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,376
Tell 'em how it was, Mac.

735
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:45,347
- Hearing and smelling goddamn commies.
- Right, talk about the hell, Mac.

736
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:49,010
Crawling on our bellies while
those bastards were tunneling under us,

737
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:51,680
ready to slice and dice us
and eat us for dinner.

738
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,485
- That's hell! Hell was...
- Tell 'em!

739
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,083
Hell was getting called a gook
by your own platoon

740
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,618
while they step on your body
and leave you for dead in My Lai village.

741
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,791
That's hell!
Thinking you're the enemy!

742
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:07,268
Spitting up blood,
gasping for air,

743
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,862
choking on your own vomit.

744
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,803
But let me make this clear.

745
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:26,645
I would have gone through that hell
14 times over to serve my country.

746
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,725
Huh!

747
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:38,664
He has better legs. Much better legs.
I mean, we need to start thinking about...

748
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:41,568
That was good.
That was good too.

749
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,765
Yeah, kill him.

750
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,614
No, no. Cross him off.
He did not take that hit.

751
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,939
Breeze Loo, what do you
think about today's part of the audition?

752
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,808
I'm not exactly sure
what this round is for, man.

753
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,814
I mean, aren't we auditioning
for an acting role?

754
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,943
It's a little overwhelming at times,
you know?

755
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,011
You're in front of Mr. Loo like that
and he's your idol.

756
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:37,686
I mean, I've seen him in tons of movies.
That's the reason I became an actor.

757
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:02,208
Come on!

758
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,959
Fight! Huh!

759
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,025
Stop dancing!

760
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,871
It was the last straw, really.

761
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,878
I just couldn't take it anymore,
you know?

762
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:33,939
It was bad enough
that my client, Cole, choked,

763
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,509
but I just couldn't handle

764
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:41,614
the disappointment I felt
towards my boyfriend, Cole.

765
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,682
You know, it was just...

766
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,024
It was... too much.

767
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,759
So...

768
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,426
so that's why
I broke up with him.

769
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,874
But I'm still his manager, though.

770
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:59,533
And, um...

771
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,737
So now I can guide his career

772
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:07,442
without any of the guilt
or the conflict or the drama.

773
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:11,419
I need to talk to you.
Turn off the camera. I said shut it off!

774
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,718
- We're...
- Get out!

775
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,987
Shut your face!
Get out!

776
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:21,922
- You need to calm down!
- I want you back.

777
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,592
We agreed
this is how it needs to be.

778
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,829
No!

779
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,269
You stupid face!

780
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:44,512
Finally.
It was my chance to prove my value,

781
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,556
show 'em who I really am,
you know?

782
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,650
The color of my skin,
my economic class...

783
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,094
None of it mattered.
I was expressing myself.

784
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:57,759
The room was captivated,
I could feel it.

785
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,531
And then he showed up.

786
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:03,630
- Eli, hi! Ronney.
- Hey, how are ya?

787
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,005
When my step-cousin
was abroad,

788
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,443
he caught Eli in a movie
and tipped me off immediately.

789
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,571
I mean,
he may be unknown here,

790
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:15,175
but he just won
the New Zealand Oscar for best actor.

791
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:19,848
And I think it's just a matter of time before
he is the next David Carradine. You know?

792
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,185
G'day, guys.

793
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,126
That guy Eli waltzed in late
like he owned the fucking place.

794
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,892
He didn't even show at the first round
of auditions. How fair is that?

795
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:32,867
Some of us
know what struggle is.

796
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,565
Some of us had to fight
to get where we are.

797
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:40,771
Eli is not "some of us."

798
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,144
How's it all going,
everyone?

799
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,476
- It's good.
- Great.

800
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:48,278
- Yeah, it's good fun.
- Eli...

801
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:53,254
- Yeah, he's pretty good.
- It's so obvious. It is!

802
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,985
I mean,
he is Bruce Lee, you know?

803
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,358
Well, hold on. I mean,
let's not get carried away with ourselves.

804
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,057
We have a few
very, very solid options.

805
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:06,159
Close the deal and cancel the next round.
There's no need to keep looking.

806
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,728
What?
What are you talking about?

807
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:14,038
It would be a waste of everyone's time
to keep looking.

808
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:18,937
OK, Ronney, you oughta know,
that's just not how it's done.

809
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,745
I'm the director.

810
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,344
Cast him now.

811
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,283
So, Eli,

812
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,261
what's it like
to be offered this role?

813
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,756
Well, there's a certain amount
of satisfaction that I feel

814
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,962
when my work is acknowledged,
you know?

815
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:44,996
What challenges do you
expect when you take over for Bruce Lee?

816
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,101
Well, you mean
if I choose to take the role?

817
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:53,081
Are you suggesting
you're not gonna accept the part?

818
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:58,519
There's... there are some questions I need
answered first, before I agree to anything.

819
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:02,684
- Like what?
- Well, firstly...

820
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,818
am I working with
the right people?

821
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:07,089
You know,
it's important to me.

822
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,063
Secondly,

823
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:13,831
is this really a safe and nurturing
environment for me?

824
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,894
And third...

825
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,944
How is this for my career,
you know?

826
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,002
I'm trying to build one,

827
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,344
so it's important right now.

828
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:31,411
You know, this cat, Eli, does he have
anything going on in his eyes? No.

829
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:37,358
Does he even indicate for one second
what's going on up here - why he fights?

830
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,487
- No.
- I see.

831
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:45,091
But do you think that his presence
in the competition will affect your chances?

832
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:49,434
Absolutely not. The cat's parlor tricks
are just an act of desperation

833
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:53,636
because he knows he doesn't have
what it is that I was innately born with -

834
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:56,804
true power and the ability to destroy
with my very presence.

835
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,949
This is just unacceptable.

836
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:04,282
All I asked for was a fair fight.
Instead, I'm stuck here.

837
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:07,687
We're stuck here, in limbo.

838
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,056
Waiting.

839
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,758
The studio just doesn't get it.

840
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,765
Eli's not even American,
he's not even close to American,

841
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:22,567
and they're allowing him to come in here
and hijack this whole process.

842
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,940
Typical.

843
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,102
Foreigners coming in here
and taking our jobs.

844
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:32,478
We Asian-Americans have it bad enough.
This is just insult to injury.

845
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,074
So what's about to happen next?

846
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,917
- Well, Eli called a meeting.
- Of course he did.

847
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,424
- Well, what do I do?
- It's... Ronney, it's an actor thing, OK?

848
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:46,394
You just stroke his dick a bit
and, you know, he'll feel better.

849
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,864
It's standard procedure, OK?

850
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,958
- G'day, fellas!
- Hi.

851
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,299
- I got you some coffee.
- Thank you.

852
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:58,807
Hey, Eloise.
I just need to speak to the director alone.

853
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,341
- Oh!
- Yeah.

854
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,072
- Alone.
- You mean us?

855
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,517
No, just the boom guy.
Of course I mean you.

856
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:14,485
- All right.
- What's on your mind?

857
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,516
Ronney?
What happened?

858
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,080
Are you OK?

859
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,859
Do you wanna talk?
I'm here for you. Ronney?

860
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,196
Is this his home?

861
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:06,935
Eight.

862
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:09,001
Here he is.
Number nine.

863
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:12,536
You couldn't
pay me enough to live here.

864
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,014
Ronney!

865
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,415
Ronney, can we talk, honey?

866
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:23,256
All right, come on.
Look, it's not like he's Jesus or something.

867
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:28,491
I mean, we can do a lot better than,
you know, Eli from New Zealand.

868
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,364
Ronney?

869
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:36,565
All right, Ronney, not to state the obvious
or anything, but Eli? Not a team player.

870
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,941
Eli cares only about Eli. He would have
been a nightmare to work with, trust me.

871
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,241
What's your next move?

872
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,612
You don't have to touch me.

873
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,082
Ronney.

874
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:51,120
Ronney, sweetheart?

875
00:59:51,187 --> 00:59:55,055
Goddamn fucking...
goddamn fucking pussy!

876
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:03,161
OK, Ronney. Ronney, we haven't even
seen the other actors on screen yet!

877
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,291
You know,
and that's where it counts!

878
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,394
Do you know how many amazing stars
seem just... pathetic?

879
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:13,306
They were shit until they were projected on
the silver screen. That is how it goes.

880
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,903
I mean,
our best is probably still with us.

881
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,213
Ronney...

882
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,115
All right.

883
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,584
Ronney,
here's what I'm gonna do for you, OK?

884
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:31,957
I am going to handle everything
from here on, all right?

885
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:35,520
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna run the screen tests myself

886
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:39,591
and I will make the final choices
for the studio, OK?

887
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,933
So don't you worry about it.

888
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:47,342
OK, let's go!
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

889
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,401
Oh. Hi.

890
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,171
Well, well.

891
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:26,443
- You made it.
- Surprised?

892
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:30,316
I'm only surprised
that it took you so long.

893
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:35,219
It takes time
to track down cowards like you.

894
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:38,317
I wasn't the one
who ran away last time.

895
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,794
That's because
you were hiding behind the army of venom.

896
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:46,528
Excuses, excuses.

897
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,366
I'm shocked to see
you're fighting your own battles.

898
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,602
You will pay for your audacity.

899
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,939
Run, baby, it's a trap!

900
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:58,213
Kimberly,
I'm not going anywhere without you!

901
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,647
I've got to hand it to you, brother.

902
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,778
You always did have
good taste in women.

903
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:12,225
- Brother.
- In school, you always got the pretty ones.

904
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,354
Unlike me.

905
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:19,664
- You can't let the past be your master.
- And you can never master the past.

906
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,068
But, my dear brother,

907
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,538
I can seize the present!

908
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,633
Oh!

909
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,844
You keep her out of this, brother.
This is between you and me.

910
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,849
We're not kids anymore.
You can't tell me what to do.

911
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:40,685
And besides,
you're in no position to call the shots now.

912
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,748
I can't let you
get away with this.

913
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:48,195
Move another inch closer
and you will have a very dead girlfriend.

914
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:51,597
Do you really think
I'm gonna let stand here...

915
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:55,535
Do you really think
I'm gonna stand here and let...

916
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,304
I'm sorry. Can we just cut that
and we'll just start from the top?

917
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,367
No, we're fine, Breeze.

918
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,175
Why don't we go six lines back
when I enter the forest?

919
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,443
- It's not necessary.
- He's good, I'm good.

920
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,610
He's seen all he needs to see.
I'm good.

921
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:13,519
- Yeah, but we don't have a clean take.
- We've seen it. We've seen it.

922
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,989
- It's enough?
- Yeah.

923
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,221
- Thank you, Breeze.
- Thanks, Breeze.

924
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,930
That's ridiculous. They cut you off
and you were just getting started.

925
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,531
I thought we were
working with professionals!

926
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:36,544
I agree. That's why you need someone
who will fight for you, someone like me.

927
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,307
Cole, are you ready?

928
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,940
You call me.

929
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,246
- Thanks.
- Cole, are you ready?

930
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,313
Cole?

931
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,821
OK, let's go.

932
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,622
Roll camera.

933
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,666
Mark it.

934
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,462
Set.

935
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:00,866
Action.

936
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:05,271
Look at you.
You're powerless.

937
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:09,206
Tongue-tied, brother?

938
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:14,081
You may be holding the cards,

939
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,675
but you have nothing.

940
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:23,550
That's why you're trying to
take everything away from me.

941
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,188
But it won't work

942
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:30,357
because you have to
live with yourself.

943
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,469
Who are you,

944
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,937
really?

945
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:41,841
You're the worst kind of villain that
pretends to be something that they're not,

946
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,505
a monster who acts like
they care about people,

947
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:49,074
but then will betray them
when they least expect it.

948
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:53,884
Yeah, I may have been a fool for trusting
you, but that was my biggest crime.

949
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:56,322
But you...

950
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:59,452
Oh, you'll get what you deserve.

951
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,730
Maybe not now,

952
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,927
but all your lies
will catch up to you,

953
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,699
and you will be left alone

954
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:12,707
to see yourself

955
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,834
and suffer.

956
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,776
Wow!

957
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,406
- Wow.
- Where's he going?

958
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:23,577
Cole, that was...
Cole? Oh, my...

959
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,580
Where's Breeze?

960
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:30,592
Where the fuck is Breeze?

961
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,596
A screen test to me is like
going to the bathroom for anyone else.

962
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:37,224
It's not exactly fair.
I have much more camera time

963
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,825
than pretty much any
of the other candidates.

964
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:43,963
You know, for me, it's the difference
between preparation and actually acting.

965
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,531
It's pretty seamless.
It's not really there.

966
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:48,668
Hey, fucker.

967
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,735
Cole?

968
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,479
Cole, Cole, Cole!
What are you doing?

969
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:57,542
Get off me!

970
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:01,356
- Cole! Cole!
- You asshole.

971
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,916
- Stop that!
- Stop it! You're gonna hurt him.

972
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,997
- Cole?
- Breeze. Breeze, are you OK? Breeze!

973
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,535
- Oh, my God!
- Breeze, can you hear me?

974
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:16,765
- Are you OK?
- Can you hear my voice? Guys! Breeze!

975
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,070
- What's happened?
- Is everyone OK up there?

976
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,632
Cole,

977
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:26,842
what was it like
to see Saraghina talking to Breeze?

978
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:34,311
She just betrayed me
in front of my face.

979
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,128
That's all I have to say.

980
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:46,833
Breeze,
what do you think of Cole Kim now?

981
01:06:46,902 --> 01:06:51,635
He's a coward. Only a true coward
would Pearl Harbor someone like this.

982
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:56,804
- Why did he attack you?
- It's the price of fame, baby.

983
01:06:56,879 --> 01:06:59,973
What are the chances
of you getting this part?

984
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:02,984
Well, was it even a question
from the start?

985
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,145
I mean, seriously, take a look.

986
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:09,658
I'm the real deal, baby. I mean,
this is a big-time Hollywood studio film.

987
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:14,219
Do you think the studio was considering
giving it to one of those other cats?

988
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,161
Come on.

989
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,564
Hey, Doc.

990
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,261
Reggie!

991
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:24,966
When did you become a doctor?
What the hell is going on here?

992
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,239
My name is Raja.

993
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,336
Really?

994
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,589
Cole.

995
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:43,056
Cole is intense.

996
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:47,528
- He did some really good work.
- He did, but, uh...

997
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:52,968
I'm sorry. I gotta go with my gut,
and the gut never lies.

998
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,796
OK. Well, uh, I don't know.

999
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:59,272
He's kind of...

1000
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,707
I don't feel comfortable
around him at all.

1001
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,541
- Really?
- No. He's really creepy.

1002
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,744
Well, Ronney,
Jack Nicholson's kind of creepy.

1003
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:09,876
I mean, creepy's...
creepy's in.

1004
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:13,918
No.

1005
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,220
All right.

1006
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,124
OK, got it.

1007
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,356
Well, you know what?
We've got Breeze.

1008
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:23,955
I mean,
Breeze is a pretty safe bet.

1009
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,094
Makes sense.

1010
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:29,433
OK.

1011
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,133
All right, so Breeze.

1012
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,937
- Yes.
- OK.

1013
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:36,477
- Cole and Breeze.
- OK.

1014
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:39,876
- Anyone else?
- No.

1015
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,782
No. No one else is really gonna cut it,
I don't think.

1016
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:46,413
Well, we need to find one or two more
for the studio, cover our ass.

1017
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,481
Yeah, fine. Fine.

1018
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:53,723
I have my pick,
so you can choose the backups.

1019
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:01,394
OK, well, Cassie, uh...
why don't you choose the backups, OK?

1020
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,303
OK.
Sure, yeah.

1021
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,110
They will tell you you are not unique,
you are not one of a kind.

1022
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:16,583
You are. You are,
and in your poetry, when you speak...

1023
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,779
Oh, my God, Breeze!

1024
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,279
Oh, my God.
What happened?

1025
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,187
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse us.

1026
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:33,460
What in the hell is going on here?
First of all, where in the hell is Cole?

1027
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:36,937
- I've been calling him. He's not picking up.
- Fuck.

1028
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:41,409
OK, can someone tell me why the fuck
the white guy showed up, please?

1029
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:45,208
- He's like a fucking fungus.
- I asked you for two backups...

1030
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,545
Hey, Dad. Hey!

1031
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:55,052
Mr. Kurtainbaum, I would like to
introduce you to the finalists for the film.

1032
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,307
- Would you get 'em out of here, please?
- What?

1033
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,072
- Please go. Get 'em out.
- Out of the office?

1034
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,205
Now. Now.

1035
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:27,182
Go... You too, please.
Please.

1036
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,349
I'm gonna ask you once,
please go.

1037
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:32,189
- Go.
- Just a few minutes?

1038
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:38,393
This will just take a few minutes.
I told you once, I told you twice, now go!

1039
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:43,231
Are you guys
fucking retards or what?

1040
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:46,638
We just spent a week of good money
on this bullshit!

1041
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:51,874
Do you have any idea -
any idea - what's going on here?

1042
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:56,316
You give me some crippled Chink, a white
guy and some guy who's obviously, what?

1043
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:59,115
Two feet taller
than the real Bruce Lee!

1044
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:01,418
God!

1045
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:04,118
You're... you're fired.

1046
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,354
- And you're fired!
- Dad! Dad!

1047
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,157
- Fired!
- Dad, please!

1048
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:10,323
Ronney
had a vision of a man...

1049
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,893
- A vision, my ass. Go! Go!
- But we can't find him. OK, OK.

1050
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,734
Please, would you go...

1051
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:20,969
- Go!
- Dad, please? Dad, please!

1052
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,443
Son, go!

1053
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,017
Oh, you.
Who said you could stay?

1054
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:34,283
Take your fucking fishing pole
and go fish somewhere else,

1055
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,620
but not in my pond!

1056
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:44,597
So how do you plan on
completing the film now?

1057
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,734
We're in the business of making money.
It's very simple.

1058
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:55,675
We own some footage of someone
who's very famous, but he's dead.

1059
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:59,908
We need to find someone who looks like
him so he can walk around for an hour

1060
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:05,181
so we can package the picture
and sell it as a whole movie.

1061
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:06,653
Huh?

1062
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,486
What's so hard about that?

1063
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:14,860
Are you gonna conduct
another search to find a replacement?

1064
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:18,297
Search?
What search are you talking about?

1065
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:23,168
I can go down to fucking Chinatown
and find someone who looks just like him.

1066
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:25,365
Five minutes.

1067
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,842
But would that be
the right person for the part?

1068
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:32,346
Faster than you could say
egg foo yung.

1069
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:35,474
- Egg foo yung.
- I found him.

1070
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:38,315
And his brother.

1071
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,354
# Hey

1072
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:48,191
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1073
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,493
# No satisfac...
it's satisfac...

1074
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,557
# No satisfaction

1075
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,398
# Keep on dancin'

1076
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:59,999
Howdy, pardners. It's EZ Breezy, bringing
you the best deals in the Wild, Wild West.

1077
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:04,444
This Gremlin's a peppy critter that'll outrun
any rapscallion that dares to race it.

1078
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:09,246
That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
It's got 63,000 miles and it's listed at $470.

1079
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:12,549
$470?
I think that's hogwash!

1080
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:16,580
I'll give it to you for $440. That's right,
I said $440 and I'm not bluffing,

1081
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:21,322
but you gotta mosey on down here mighty
quick 'cause this here Gremlin's going fast!

1082
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,093
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1083
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,396
# No satisfac...
it's satisfac...

1084
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,402
# No satisfaction

1085
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,700
# Hey

1086
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,365
# Keep on dancin'

1087
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:34,705
# Hey

1088
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,345
Frankly, that audition process
was eye-opening for me.

1089
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:43,977
It made me realize that the only way
to effect change is from a position of power.

1090
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:49,217
No longer will I be at the mercy
of someone else's whims, you know?

1091
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:53,728
- What is it you're doing now?
- Directing and starring in my first film.

1092
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,663
But it's not just a movie
I'm creating,

1093
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:00,031
it's a...
it's a watershed event.

1094
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:04,004
Till now, the Asian-American male
has been neutered and castrated

1095
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:09,669
by being systematically excluded
from the sexual landscape of America.

1096
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:13,647
Is that why
you went into pornography?

1097
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:15,307
It's a revolution.

1098
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,648
- # Keep on dancin'
- # Hey

1099
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,877
- # Keep on dancin'
- # Hey

1100
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,283
- # Keep on dancin'
- # Hey

1101
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,518
# Keep on, keep on

1102
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,527
- # Keep on dancin'
- # Hey

1103
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:30,027
- # Keep on dancin'
- # Hey

1104
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,123
So, Cole and Saraghina,

1105
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:35,295
what's been happening
with you two?

1106
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,828
Well, we were having a few problems
but, well, we worked them out.

1107
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:41,899
Mm-hm,
and we're getting married.

1108
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,105
I just can't imagine
my life without her.

1109
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,217
# Hey

1110
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:56,052
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1111
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,354
# No satisfac...
it's satisfac...

1112
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:00,019
# No satisfaction

1113
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,222
# Hey

1114
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:04,322
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1115
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,796
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1116
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,303
# So I keep on dancin'

1117
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:12,932
# I got no car,
got no clothes, got no dough

1118
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,135
# Live at home with my ma

1119
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,440
# She tells me, "Get a job

1120
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,708
# "Go to school, go to church "

1121
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:21,908
# Get my hand out her purse

1122
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:24,145
# Or at least do some dirt

1123
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,449
# Maybe then, I'll have work

1124
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:27,955
# With my family

1125
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:32,016
# I can't be a doctor, lawyer or athlete,
I'm the black sheep

1126
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:36,258
# Girls think I'm nasty,
they don't stop, they just walk past me

1127
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:38,060
# Hey

1128
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,931
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1129
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:43,198
# No satisfac...
it's satisfac...

1130
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,240
# No satisfaction

1131
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,070
# Hey

1132
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:49,167
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1133
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:51,641
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1134
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:53,874
# So I keep on dancin'

1135
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:56,042
# Is it the way I look
or the way I flow?

1136
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,450
# And I understand
I ain't your typical Joe

1137
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,613
# I'm a dude with the jewels
and expensive clothes

1138
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,884
# But I'm down to pay dues
for my crew to close

1139
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,426
# You make action happen,
no relaxin'

1140
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:07,621
# Blood, sweat and tears,
you can feel the passion

1141
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:10,164
# 21 songs,
12 months for the track list

1142
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,393
# Why's it getting slept on
like a mattress?

1143
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,230
# Stop the snoozing
and stay awake

1144
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,328
# The rhyme's cocaine
straight to your brain

1145
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:18,635
# And it's A- OK,
go and have a taste

1146
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:21,107
# Of the dopest cuts
from around the way

1147
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:23,303
# Hey

1148
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,780
And... action!

1149
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:28,213
Action! Oooh!

1150
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:32,276
Oh, that looks terrible.
Yeah, that's really bad.

1151
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,015
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1152
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,087
# I ain't got no satisfaction

1153
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:48,526
Oh, baby, that was so sexy.
Do it again.

1154
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,196
Oh, I like it!

1155
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,799
- I'm gonna gash your head open!
- Do it!

1156
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,433
This is like Crash.

1157
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,843
Look at his face, dude!

1158
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,076
Last-take shuffle!

1159
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,942
Spin kick?

1160
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:10,757
Action!

1161
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,885
# No satisfac...
no satisfac...

1162
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,759

You know,
