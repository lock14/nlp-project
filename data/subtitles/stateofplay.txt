50
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:34,078

Yes, sir.

Who told you that?

57
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:55,795
You just did.

58
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,437
You got the names of the victims for me?

59
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,005
You gotta be kidding me.

60
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,807
<i>You know I'm gonna find out anyway.</i>

61
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,575
Not from me.

62
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,273
Okay. You want to play a little confirm or deny?

63
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,281
<i>I'm not playing this game with you, Cal.</i>

64

Look, Don, I got a living to make, all right?

65
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,186
I got mouths to feed, goldfish.

66
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,018

67
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,085
Okay.

68
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:22,526
Two victims, one shooter?

69
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:23,794
Confirm.

70
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:25,663
One dead, one in the hospital?

71
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,832
Confirm.

72
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,567
Drug related?

00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,695

What?

82
00:05:57,016 --> 00:06:01,713
Sonia Baker was killed in an accident on the Metro this morning.

83
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,717
They identified her by her staff badge.

84
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:10,185
Horrible news for all of us.

85
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:13,029
<i>But, Stephen, we're scheduled to start now.</i>

90
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:42,524
Talk to me about this shooting.

91
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:43,992
<i>You know, one guy's still alive.</i>

92
00:06:43,993 --> 00:06:45,427
Deshaun Stagg?

93
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,062
<i>No, he's dead.</i>

94
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:48,663
The other guy on the bike, Vernon Sando.

95
00:06:48,664 --> 00:06:50,664
Hey, Gene, did you read the guinea pig piece I filed?

96
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:51,799
<i>Yeah, I'll get to it, Ferris.</i>

97
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
<i>Because it's a great human interest story.</i>

98
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:53,934
<i>Yeah, human interest.</i>

99
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,069
<i>So what's the deal?</i>

100
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,138
<i>Stagg's drug deal goes wrong, and this guy just rides by?</i>

101
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,640
Yeah, something like that, I think.

102
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,975
<i>That's a remarkable feat of survival.</i>

103
00:07:00,976 --> 00:07:03,376
<i>Well, at least it's got a little bit of a zip code to it.</i>

104
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:04,744
<i>Georgetown's the angle, right?</i>

105
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:07,647
No, no, the angle is that this guy Vernon Sando

106
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,082
has got an MBA from Duke.

107
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,350
<i>What's he doing on a bike?</i>

108
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,551
<i>He's buying a pizza franchise.</i>

109
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:13,086
You know, they make you ride the bike

110
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:14,553
for the first six months, learn the ropes.

111
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:17,055
<i>He's got a wife, two kids, mortgage, total citizen.</i>

112
00:07:17,056 --> 00:07:18,490
<i>What's his condition?</i>

113
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:19,620
<i>Critical, non-reactive.</i>

114
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,093
<i>Paragraph 3. He's in a coma.</i>

115
00:07:21,094 --> 00:07:23,762
Okay, let me know.

116
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,855
I will.

<i>who was the lead researcher for this committee</i>

<i>The circumstances of her death are not yet clear.</i>

<i>Well, I'd like to send my condolences to her family.</i>

Oh, my God, are those tears?

<i>50 bucks says he's balling her.</i>

130
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,629
50 bucks?
Wait, you owe me 50 bucks.

131
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,331
Bad Congressman! Bad.

132
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:38,932
What a scumball!

133
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:41,534

134

<i>Let's hope she's not 5'2" and 300 pounds.</i>

135

Gene, Gene, what is your obsession with fat girls?

136
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,909
If you want to have sex with Pete, you should just say it.

137
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,177
Not tonight, I got a headache.

138
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,511

00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,620

143
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,180
<i>as soon as Ms. Baker's death was announced.</i>

144
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:15,266
<i>Hey, Joe, Cal McAffrey over at the Globe.</i>

Just calling about that shooting in Georgetown last night.

146
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,397
I heard the dead kid had a couple of priors as a purse snatcher.

147
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:25,701
Got any more details for me?

148
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,615

 Online side.

156
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:48,096
Uh'hu.

00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:57,738

<i>"single girl in the corridors of power" kind of thing,</i>

00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:04,212

<i>at your friend's hearing.</i>

164
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,145
Is there a question on the horizon?

165
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:13,086
Yeah. Have you spoken to him today?

166
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:16,123
Are you trying to make me part of your story?

167
00:10:16,124 --> 00:10:19,060
<i>No. I'm trying to get a little context.</i>

168
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:21,494
Context, re: Dirt?

169
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,522
Well, do you think he was having an affair with that girl?

170
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:29,068
Gee, Della.

171
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,236
Yeah.

172
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:33,272

247
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,113
Yeah, she told me you behaved like a pig.

249

Well, piggish.

250

252
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:28,691

256
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:38,334

I see you redecorated.

279
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:25,501
Yeah. I moved that couch a couple of feet.

280
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,367
Looks good.

00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:43,250

00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:57,655
The nature of the beast, public office.

289
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:04,995

Look, Cal,

291
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,413

292
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:17,006
Hey.

293
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:21,147
I deserved it, all of it.

294
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:27,620

You know?

298
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:47,236
This whole thing with Sonia, what happened, it just snuck up on me.

299
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:50,937
She was an amazing woman,

300
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:54,939
beautiful and really funny, smart,

301
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:58,981
and she, you know, she adored me.

302
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:04,353
That was nice, you know, for a change.

303
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,499
Have you called the parents?

304
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,236
<i>No, I haven't called the parents.</i>

305
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:16,604
You should.

<i>Tomorrow, you're gonna make a condolence call.</i>

307
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,608

<i>"He never so much as called after our daughter's suicide. "</i>

309

312
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:47,150

No.

318

You show this to anybody?

319
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,616
Well, I thought about firing it up on YouTube.

Hey, you know what?

321
00:19:07,186 --> 00:19:10,821
This is the moment where I ask you how stupid could you be.

322
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:12,822

<i>Because we're gonna fight back with our own facts.</i>

328
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:27,767

00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:28,460
Well, why?

348
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,828
Do you have a pen?

349
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:31,489
Yeah.

350
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:35,267
<i>- Lieutenant Leon Comey.
- Pen, pen, pen.</i>

351
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:38,031
Write that
down. C-O-M-E-Y.

352
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,703
<i>C~O~M~E~Y.</i>

353
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:44,008
202-555-0167.

354
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,144
<i>He's gonna show you an off-the-record preview</i>

355
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,079
of the security camera tapes from the Metro station.

356
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,015
What, you mean... Do you mean, like, now?

357
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,190
Yeah, like now.
Sorry.

358
00:20:53,216 --> 00:20:54,150
Who am I calling?

359
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,252
I was trying to get Della Frye the reporter.

360
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:57,198
<i>Oh, jee, I'm sorry.</i>

361
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:59,188
<i>I thought that I was talking to the guy</i>

362
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,790
<i>who wouldn't give me the time of day this morning.</i>

363
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:05,961
Look, I am just trying to help you get a few facts in the mix

364
00:21:05,962 --> 00:21:08,665
next time you decide to upchuck online.

365
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,966
What?

366
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:17,401
<i>I'm not doing it. I'm not.</i>

367
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:27,308
DELLA: Wake up.

368
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:44,028
Does anybody know where Room 514 is?

369
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,359
514A or 514B?

370
00:21:50,237 --> 00:21:52,738
<i>It doesn't say.
 Is there a big difference?</i>

371
00:21:52,739 --> 00:21:53,578
Big enough.

372
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:56,961
You looking for Uniform Squad or Investigation?

373
00:21:57,977 --> 00:22:01,207
<i>I don't know.
Cal McAffrey sent me.</i>

374
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:03,482
<i>Why didn't you say so?</i>

375
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:05,449
<i>You Cal's new assistant?</i>

376
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:07,549
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

377
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,717
Hey, can I see that?

378
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:13,491
<i>Yeah, it's right down the hallway here.</i>

379
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,559
Thank you.

380
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,393
Like a police escort?

381
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:18,128
<i>No, I'm okay.
Thank you.</i>

382
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:18,942
<i>Hey, no trouble.</i>

383
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:21,331
<i>I'm just grabbing some dinner here real quick.</i>

384
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:23,868
So, how long have you known Cal?

385
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:25,495
Too long.

386
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,409
<i>What's your title? Okay, Sergeant.</i>

387
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,077
I can file a public records request

388
00:22:34,078 --> 00:22:36,307
and get the information anyway.

389
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,054
You got nothing?

390
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:47,022
No.

391
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,892
<i>They've got 56 cameras covering the track platforms.</i>

392
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:52,395
There are three blind spots in the entire system,

393
00:22:52,396 --> 00:22:54,662
and Sonia Baker went down in one of them.

394
00:22:54,663 --> 00:22:56,464
You got copy for me, Cal?

395
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:58,767
The shooting delivery guy, what are we doing?

396
00:22:58,768 --> 00:22:59,901
<i>I'm on it.</i>

397
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:02,003
Well, I got Marty lined up to take some pictures of the family.

398
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:04,105
<i>If you'd like, I can send somebody out there with him.</i>

399
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:06,073
He can do the crying, you can do the nuts and bolts.

400
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:07,097
<i>No. No need. I'm on it.</i>

401
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:08,208
<i>You'll have it tonight.</i>

402
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,176
<i>You're on it.</i>

403
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,846
Okay. You know what you gotta do?

404
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:14,648
Call Leon, all right?

405
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:16,617
Just sort of push him for the details.

406
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:18,151
Ask him a few more questions.
You know...

407
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:20,049
9 suicides in 20 years.

408
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:22,688
There were 5 accidental deaths,

409
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:24,190
three from people trying to get their stuff

410
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:25,625
off the tracks before the train came

411
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:28,194
and two of the psycho-on-stranger pushing attacks.

412
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:30,390
Did Collins sleep at your place last night?

413
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:32,723
- What?
- Hmm?

414
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:36,903
I was just trying to get my facts straight.

415
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:40,735
Excuse me.
ella here.

416
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,244
<i>Yeah, just a sec.
He's right here.</i>

417
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:48,235
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

418
00:23:49,382 --> 00:23:52,043
<i>It's Anne Collins.</i>

419
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,044
<i>Hey, I'm not at my desk at the moment.</i>

420
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,384
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

421
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,050
Yeah.

422
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:04,028
You know, look into the two psycho-on-stranger cases,

423
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:06,330
see if anything correlates or anything connects.

424
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:07,819
Mmm-hmm.

425
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:18,302
<i>- Hello? CAL: Hey.</i>

426
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:20,731
<i>- You okay?
- No.</i>

427
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:22,911
There are paparazzi on my lawn,

428
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:27,075
<i>so I guess that entitles me to half off on Us Weekly.</i>

429
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:30,280
<i>I've been trying to call you.</i>

430
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:33,215
I had my phone off.

431
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,089
<i>You talk to Stephen yet?</i>

432
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,057
No.

433
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,662
They want me to come down for a press conference.

434
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:45,654
<i>Well, you know if you don't, they're gonna toss him on the bonfire.</i>

435
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,602
<i>You know, I'm not that hurt.</i>

436
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,798
<i>I'm not even that surprised.</i>

437
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,809
<i>It's just so humiliating, you know.</i>

438
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:58,512
<i>Tell me you didn't know about her.</i>

439
00:24:58,513 --> 00:24:59,679
<i>I didn't.</i>

440
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,171
I did not know about her, okay?

441
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:04,911
<i>I'll take the train down.</i>

442
00:25:05,553 --> 00:25:08,044
Will you buy me a drink after?

443
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:12,825
Of course. Hey, just call him, all right?

444
00:25:12,826 --> 00:25:14,660
<i>Just call Stephen.</i>

445
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:16,856
Thanks.

446
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,807
CAL: Deshaun Stagg.

447
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:31,543
Be nice if they could spell his name right.

448
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:33,211
<i>No one's even come to get his stuff yet.</i>

449
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:34,845
<i>It's appalling.</i>

450
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:36,780
Never happen to a white man.

451
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:38,815
<i>Skip it.
I'm not in the mood.</i>

452
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,717
What, no love, no politics?

453
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:42,553
What are we gonna talk about?

454
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,321
<i>We're not.
You gotta get outta here</i>

455
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:46,482
before we both get into trouble.

456
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:50,059
<i>They're saying it was only one shooter. What do you think?</i>

457
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,788
No idea.

458
00:25:53,196 --> 00:25:54,897
What about drugs?

459
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,990
<i>It's a good bet.</i>

460
00:25:57,267 --> 00:25:59,234
Come on, Cal, leave that shit alone.

461
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:00,162
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

462
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:02,388
<i>I'm just checking out his cell phone.</i>

463
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:05,341
Watch, this will be the moment they decide

464
00:26:05,342 --> 00:26:07,176
to come and pick all this shit up.

465
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:09,412
Then what are you gonna do?

466
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:11,613
Write some articles, get me my job back?

467
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:13,582
You know I will.

468
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:15,311
Cal?

469
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,220
<i>Cal, for Christ's sakes, what do I tell Jack if he walks in?</i>

470
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,689
<i>Nothing, 'cause I'm done.</i>

471
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:27,994
<i>I'll give you a hug next time, all right?</i>

472
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,788
Bye.

473
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,065
Buy me a soda?

474
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,603
Not diet.

475
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,546
Thanks.

476
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:03,661
<i>Yo, yo, if you want to leave a message for Kippy,</i>

477
00:27:03,662 --> 00:27:05,229
<i>make sure you leave your number, all right?</i>

478
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,062
<i>That way I can call you back. Later for you.</i>

479
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:12,936
<i>AUTOMATED OPERATOR: We're sorry.
Your call cannot be...</i>

480
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:18,041
<i>MAN: Yo, who this?</i>

481
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,744
<i>It's me, man. Who that?</i>

482
00:27:19,745 --> 00:27:22,680
<i>Me who? Bitch, you the one got your number blocked!</i>

483
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:24,468
<i>Don't be fronting me, man.</i>

484
00:27:24,494 --> 00:27:26,049
<i>It's Deshaun. Come on.</i>

485
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,217
<i>- No.
- Where you at?</i>

486
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:29,219
<i>Who the hell gave you my number, fool?</i>

487
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,820
I was just talking to Kippy.

488
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:32,522
<i>- Skippy?
- Kippy, man.</i>

489
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:34,149
<i>This shit ain't funny, trick.</i>

490
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,968
<i>Hi. You've reached Sonia Baker.</i>

491
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:47,369
<i>I can't take your call right now,</i>

492
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,837
<i>but if you leave your name, number,</i>

493
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:52,534
<i>and the time you called, I'll be sure to get back to you.
Thanks.</i>

494
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:05,485
<i>Hi. You've reached Sonia Baker.</i>

495
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:06,987
<i>I can't take your call right now,</i>

496
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:08,455

<i>and the time you called, I'll be sure to get back to you.
Thanks.</i>

498
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:20,229
Excuse me.

499
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,868
Sonia Baker.

500
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,039
We got any kinda drug angle on her?

501
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,474
She ever arrested or rehabbed or anything like that?

502
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,806
<i>- Who's asking?
- Me.</i>

503
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,913
<i>You're not on the story.</i>

504
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:36,314
I gave you the Metro tapes idea, right?

505
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:38,215
Yeah.

506
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:42,678
<i>So are you trying to ruin what's left of her reputation?</i>

507
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:45,223
Are you doing this for Collins?

508
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,692
A little context on Sonia?

509
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,729
You gotta be kidding.

510
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:04,041
Hey, Maurice.

511
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,476
Hey, Cal, you getting your regular?

512
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:07,543
Yeah.

513
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:09,409
Sure. Hey, Jay!

514
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:14,417
I need a chili cheeseburger, a chili cheese fry, and a chili half-smoke.

515
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:16,748
I got the burger on!

516
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:20,051
Anybody get you yet?

517
00:29:28,264 --> 00:29:30,030
<i>- All right.
- You're a hungry man, eh?</i>

518
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:31,132
Yeah.

519
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,157
<i>How's it going, Happy?</i>

520
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:57,820
<i>That's a long way to go for another soda.</i>

521
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:04,129
You want to buy something from the last bag Deshaun ever stole?

522
00:30:04,131 --> 00:30:06,097
I need 500 bucks.

00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:25,383
Did you get the train okay?

544
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:26,617
What?

545
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,670
Did you get on the train all right?

546
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:31,379
Get through? Everything okay?

547
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,088
<i>You're gonna make small talk?</i>

548
00:30:39,864 --> 00:30:42,992
I will go check on the arrangements.

549
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:02,515
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

550
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:11,693
<i>It doesn't have to be a detailed statement.</i>

551
00:31:11,694 --> 00:31:14,696
<i>Short and dignified, and we'll be out of here.</i>

552
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:17,927
Dignified. Got it.

553
00:31:25,974 --> 00:31:28,041
<i>MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us here today.</i>

554
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,705
<i>Mr. And Mrs. Collins would like to give you a brief statement.</i>

555
00:31:48,961 --> 00:31:51,796
GIRL: Deshaun boosted this metal briefcase

556
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:54,993
from some guy outside of Starbucks.

557
00:31:55,368 --> 00:31:58,097
<i>That's what we did, you know?</i>

558
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,871
<i>Grab a guy's bag and sell it back to him.</i>

559
00:32:07,245 --> 00:32:11,737
<i>Usually we just got, like, people's business papers and shit.</i>

560
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:15,617
- This one?
- This one was different.

561
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:48,746
GIRL: There was a gun in there, too,

562
00:32:48,817 --> 00:32:52,775
and a little bag of these weird-looking bullets.

563
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,289
Did you see the guy that owned the bag?

564
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,189
No.

565
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:03,326
<i>I told Deshaun we shouldn't sell this bag back.</i>

566
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:05,231
I mean, you know, what about the girl?

567
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:08,668
But he needed a fix real bad,

568
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:13,305
and he and this guy figured out a time and place.

569
00:33:13,306 --> 00:33:15,603
And that was it.

570
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:20,813
My boy never came back.

571
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:24,140
You took these out of the briefcase first,

572
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:26,584
<i>and then you called her from Deshaun's phone.</i>

573
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:29,076
Her number was there, too.

574
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:31,223
I figured someone had to warn her

575
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:33,988
that this psycho was following her around.

576
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:37,494
<i>She just didn't pick up.</i>

577
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:40,264
<i>Mr. Collins moved to staunch a growing tide</i>

578
00:33:40,265 --> 00:33:42,734
<i>of hostility towards him this afternoon</i>

579
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:44,235
<i>when he appeared together with his...</i>

580
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,837
<i>...the long line of politicians' wives.</i>

581
00:33:45,838 --> 00:33:48,605
<i>We've had triumphs and disappointments,</i>

582
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:51,141
<i>and we've both made mistakes that have caused...</i>

583
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:55,946
<i>MAN: Apologize for his affair and offer an apology to his constituents.</i>

584
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,414
Can you believe this?

585
00:33:57,415 --> 00:33:59,678
<i>We're on six channels simultaneously.</i>

586
00:33:59,684 --> 00:34:02,549
<i>CAL: Who might have wanted Sonia dead?</i>

587
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:04,887
<i>What? Is there something in her history,</i>

588
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:06,155
<i>you know, something you haven't told me about?</i>

589
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:09,158
Some connections that might have got her in trouble?

590
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:12,995
No. No, no.
Wait, who...

591
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:14,129
Am I talking to my friend now,

592
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,654
or am I talking to a reporter?

593
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,567
I gotta be both.

594
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:22,037
<i>You ever heard of a guy called Deshaun Stagg?</i>

595
00:34:22,038 --> 00:34:23,104
No.

596
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:24,773
Was a kid. Minor criminal.

597
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:28,575
Drug addict.
Got shot and killed the night before Sonia died.

598
00:34:28,576 --> 00:34:31,340
<i>Cal, Sonia didn't have anything to do with drugs.</i>

599
00:34:31,746 --> 00:34:33,881
<i>Look, Stephen, I'm telling you things</i>

600
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:35,949
<i>that I haven't even discussed with the paper.</i>

601
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,051
Okay, you gotta think about this.

602
00:34:38,052 --> 00:34:40,520
Who might have wanted Sonia dead?

603
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:00,440
<i>CHRIS: Who is this man here in all the photographs where she's crying?</i>

604
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:02,805
<i>CAL: We don't know that yet.</i>

605
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:07,772
And what was her background before she started working with Collins?

606
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:10,449
DELLA: Well, she has some very random moments in her resume.

607
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,918
She was... She waitressed a couple times.

608
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:15,052
She had a string of bad debts.

609
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:17,154
Shoplifting conviction two years ago.

610
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:19,190
<i>Don't they do background checks on the Hill?</i>

611
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:21,325
DELLA: She wrote position papers for Collins

612
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:23,427
about bank regulations and the SEC.

613
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:25,429
I mean, a lot of people thought she was a star.

614
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,865
She was also the lead researcher on the Point-Corp hearings.

615
00:35:30,134 --> 00:35:31,794
CAMERON: So?

616
00:35:33,237 --> 00:35:37,537
Stephen represents the loss of a lot of money for those guys.

617
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:42,244
Look, what if all of this is just an attempt

618
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:44,508
to marginalize Stephen Collins?

619
00:35:45,648 --> 00:35:47,516
<i>CAMERON: You've gotta love him for it, haven't you?</i>

620
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:50,819
I mean, you give him 24 hours, body in the alley,

621
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,620
and this geezer will turn it into

622
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:54,355
a full-blown corporate conspiracy.

623
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:55,623
<i>You don't see any connection?</i>

624
00:35:55,624 --> 00:35:57,284
No.

625
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:59,561
<i>All right.
Let's go through what we know, okay?</i>

626
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:02,498
The guy that was stalking Sonia Baker,

627
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:05,796
he shot Deshaun Stagg and Vernon Sando.

628
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:10,705
Deshaun Stagg, of no fixed abode, he boosts a briefcase.

629
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:13,441
Now, in that briefcase are these photographs,..

630
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:17,934
...and according to our source, a little baggie of weird bullets.

631
00:36:18,646 --> 00:36:21,480
Metro PD ballistics tell me the casings at...

632
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:24,338
...the crime scene were reloads, untraceable.

633
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:29,484
The slugs were hand cast at twice the weight of store-bought bullets,

634
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:31,390
<i>X'ed for expansion.</i>

635
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:34,621
So that means that the shooter intended to kill.

636
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:39,660
Stagg and Sando were both double-tapped,
one bullet in the spine, one in the head.

637
00:36:39,686 --> 00:36:43,835
That is the mark of a pro, or at the very
least, somebody with a military background,

638
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:46,327
perhaps even Special Forces.

639
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:52,868
Point-Corp founded by, staffed by 100% ex-military.

640
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,106
<i>I think that's a connection we can't ignore.</i>

641
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,852
Chris, how long before we have to hand these over?

642
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,905
CHRIS: Time to verify, consult relevant case files,..

643
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:11,017
..outside counsel, 48 hours, tops.

644
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,230
<i>But if this is evidence, don't they need to see it now?</i>

645
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,500
<i>How's he doing?</i>

646
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:48,862
Hey, you gonna let me know if I gotta call the ID team, right?

647
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,694
<i>NURSE: I'll let you know.</i>

648
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,972
Walter Schroyer, Army buddy of your libidinous friend,..

649
00:37:58,973 --> 00:38:01,307
..gives his moving tribute to Stephen Collins

650
00:38:01,308 --> 00:38:04,777
in that ass-wipe excuse of a paper and not to us. Why?

651
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:08,212
CAL: Platitudes, padding and fluff.

652
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:10,415
<i>I'm a journalist.
 I'm not a publicist.</i>

653
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:11,883
CAMERON: I want to bring some more people in

654
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:13,285
to work with you on this, Cal,

655
00:38:13,286 --> 00:38:16,321
on the political side, people with real experience.

656
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:17,823
<i>I'm thinking Ted Moody.</i>

657
00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:19,258
<i>I mean, Ted's perfect for this.</i>

658
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:21,859
Are you taking me off the story?

659
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,929
No, no. Not off, just off point.

660
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,299
<i>If this is as big as he says it is, a big "if,"</i>

661
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,635
<i>then it's gonna be good for you.</i>

662
00:38:29,636 --> 00:38:31,670
How? How is that good?

663
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:33,504
Well, watching seasoned reporters

664
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:35,273
that work on a big story, you know,

665
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:37,041
<i>being a part of it all, you'll learn a lot.</i>

666
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:38,776
So, Ted Moody, what do you think?

667
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:39,977
<i>Don't let her do it.</i>

668
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:43,481
<i>And, Cal, if you're on this,
 I want this to be clean through and through.</i>

669
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:45,582
<i>Tell her to forget it. It's your gig.</i>

670
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:48,074
You got it. Get loud now.

671
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,719
<i>Excuse me.
You're defending her now?</i>

672
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,518
<i>She's fine. I can work with her.</i>

673
00:38:52,556 --> 00:38:54,691
<i>But, Cal, she's inexperienced.</i>

674
00:38:54,692 --> 00:38:55,892
<i>Inexperience isn't fatal.</i>

675
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:58,519
<i>I'm not giving up the story!</i>

676
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,264
I just... Sorry. I just...

677
00:39:02,265 --> 00:39:05,401
If I could just have a few more days with it,

678
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:08,700
<i>I promise you I'm not gonna let you down.</i>

679
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,202
<i>For Christ's sake.</i>

680
00:39:14,076 --> 00:39:16,477
<i>Don't throw those dewy cub reporter eyes at me.</i>

681
00:39:16,478 --> 00:39:18,070
<i>It's nauseating.</i>

682
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,582
And fuck you very much.

683
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:24,209
Pleasure.

684
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,888
<i>This is Nurse Leif and myself...
The lab work's back.</i>

685
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:29,423
<i>It's the panel 13 you ordered?</i>

686
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:32,292
Yeah, well, we called for a neurologist a half hour ago.

687
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:34,660
<i>You can't use that phone here, sir.</i>

688
00:39:34,661 --> 00:39:37,527
<i>Hey. What's up, Carnes?
 How you doing?</i>

689
00:39:37,798 --> 00:39:38,964
Yeah. Yeah.

690
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:40,466
<i>Looks like that Sando guy's waking up.</i>

691
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,265
You sending anyone over?

692
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:49,542
You ever been to D.C. Hospital?

693
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:50,643
No.

694
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:52,478
<i>Don't worry about it.
It's easy.</i>

695
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:55,514
<i>CAL: All right, there's a uniformed officer on the third floor ICU.</i>

696
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:57,550
- Okay.
- Write it down. Got a pen?

697
00:39:57,551 --> 00:39:58,684
- Yes.
- Here.

698
00:39:58,685 --> 00:40:00,185
- I have a pen.
- Okay.

699
00:40:00,186 --> 00:40:02,954
<i>The uniformed officer's name is Brown.</i>

700
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:04,055
- Okay?
- Brown.

701
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:05,226
Third floor ICU.

702
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,492
Tell him that Detective Bynes,

703
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:08,793
B~Y-N~E~S, Joe Bynes...

704
00:40:08,794 --> 00:40:10,028
Okay.

705
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:11,622
All right, he cleared you for access.

706
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:13,890
Access for what?

707
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:17,634
<i>Vernon Sando, the pizza guy, looks like he's coming around.</i>

708
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:19,436
<i>That's your side of the story.</i>

709
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:20,871
Excuse me?

710
00:40:20,872 --> 00:40:22,669
You heard me.

711
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:25,842
You want me to go and sit around in some hospital,

712
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:29,479
waiting for a guy who looks like he might be coming out of a coma,

713
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,676
while you clean up the rest of the story?

714
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:35,685
I mean, is that what that was all about in there?

715
00:40:35,686 --> 00:40:39,488
Look, this is a real story.

716
00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:41,390
<i>It's not open for interpretation.</i>

717
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:43,258
It does not require opinion.

718
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:46,819
We got two dead bodies, and we got a guy in a coma,

719
00:40:47,163 --> 00:40:49,029
and we got us with a lead that nobody else has got.

720
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,231
So you gotta make a decision,

721
00:40:50,232 --> 00:40:51,966
because I have to follow another lead tonight,

722
00:40:51,967 --> 00:40:55,164
and I cannot be in two places at one time.

723
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:57,339
So, are you gonna be okay slumming it

724
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,035
<i>to find out if Vernon Sando's coming around or not?</i>

725
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,471
Good.

726
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:09,316
<i>If we're gonna work together, we gotta work together.</i>

727
00:41:09,317 --> 00:41:11,512
Yeah? Deal?

728
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:20,293
All right, see you later.

729
00:42:06,503 --> 00:42:08,334
Excuse me.

730
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:25,054
<i>Don't tell me you're still lost.</i>

731
00:42:25,055 --> 00:42:26,822
Hey, what are you doing here?

732
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:28,949
Working.

733
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,021
<i>You're Officer Brown?</i>

734
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,362
<i>You're who I'm looking for.</i>

735
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:36,922
<i>I knew you'd come around.</i>

736
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:37,942
How about Sando?

737
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:39,267
Is he coming around?

738
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:41,568
Yeah, yeah, it looks that way.

739
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:43,837
<i>They're sending a detective over right now.</i>

740
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:45,239
Maybe get an ID.

741
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,002
Really?

742
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:48,942
I gotta take this.

743
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:50,277
Yeah, go ahead.

744
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:52,608
Yeah, Officer Brown.

745
00:42:53,947 --> 00:42:55,505
No, sir.

746
00:42:55,816 --> 00:42:57,715
You okay?

747
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:02,515
My dad did warn me about politicians.

748
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:07,482
The only people he hated more was journalists.

749
00:43:09,262 --> 00:43:11,252
Smart man.

750
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:15,967
<i>I'm making you nervous.</i>

751
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,162
You always did.

752
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:22,706
Well, they say sex is the best way to ruin a friendship.

753
00:43:22,707 --> 00:43:23,842
<i>They do, do they?</i>

754
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:24,910
<i>And who's they?</i>

755
00:43:24,911 --> 00:43:28,580
<i>What, Cosmopolitan magazine?
 Teen Beat?</i>

756
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:30,172
Come on.

757
00:43:30,849 --> 00:43:33,183
<i>Tell me, please, it didn't ruin ours.</i>

758
00:43:33,184 --> 00:43:35,914
<i>It hasn't ruined anything.</i>

759
00:43:59,242 --> 00:44:00,709
NURSE: Pulse is 82.

760
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,846
BP is 105 over 79, O2 sats 94.

761
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:06,581
He seems stable.

762
00:44:06,582 --> 00:44:09,383
<i>DOCTOR: Okay, let's do another blood work-up, CBCs...</i>

763
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:11,285
<i>- Miss, you cannot be in here.
- I'd just like to</i>

764
00:44:11,286 --> 00:44:12,753
- ask him a couple of questions.
DOCTOR: Miss, please!

765
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:14,021
<i>- No, I'm sorry.
- Come on. Look.</i>

766
00:44:14,022 --> 00:44:15,890
<i>You know you're not supposed to be in here.</i>

767
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:17,551
I know. I just...

768
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,219
Get on the ground!

769
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,365
OFFICER BROWN: Stand back! Stay down.

770
00:44:45,418 --> 00:44:46,999
<i>That's a colleague of mine.</i>

771
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:48,287
<i>I'm gonna have to go.</i>

772
00:44:48,288 --> 00:44:50,623
<i>I'm really sorry. I'll see you soon.</i>

773
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,352
Alright.

774
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,050
OFFICER: Let him through.

775
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:01,566
Blockade, let him through.

776
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,667
Hey, Ricky!

777
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:04,260
Let him through.

778
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,602
Della!

779
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:16,770
You okay? You all right?

780
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,918
- Della, tell me it's not yours, right?
- What is it?

781
00:45:22,919 --> 00:45:24,253
<i>It's just a little bit of blood.</i>

782
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,122
<i>It's all right.
I got it, I got it, I got it.</i>

783
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,290
<i>It's okay.</i>

784
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,416
<i>It's okay.</i>

785
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,023
<i>It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.</i>

786
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,969
Oh, my God, Cal, we could have stopped this!

787
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:42,404
What, by being psychic?

788
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:45,906
No.
We should have given the police that file.

789
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:49,843
What if there were fingerprints on the photographs?

790
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:53,248
<i>God, Cal, we can't just let people get hurt like that.</i>

791
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:55,050
<i>Look, it's over.
It's all right. It's okay.</i>

792
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:56,785
<i>We can't just keep letting people get killed.</i>

793
00:45:56,786 --> 00:45:58,819
<i>No, it's not okay.</i>

794
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,821
<i>It's okay. It's over.
It's over.</i>

795
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:02,812
<i>It's over.</i>

796
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:05,890
<i>All right? It's okay.</i>

797
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:15,768
<i>CHRIS: You're sitting on evidence in an execution homicide.</i>

798
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:17,737
<i>How do you think that's gonna play with the family of the guy</i>

799
00:46:17,738 --> 00:46:18,805
that just got shot last night?

800
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:19,939
<i>Chris, let's be productive.</i>

801
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,040
<i>Hold on, I'm actually not done.</i>

802
00:46:21,041 --> 00:46:23,642
Our reporter made a full statement last night.

803
00:46:23,643 --> 00:46:24,743
CHRIS: What, you had these when?

804
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:25,877
<i>Cam, don't answer that!</i>

805
00:46:25,878 --> 00:46:26,981
When did you have these?

806
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:27,946
You want subpoenas?

807
00:46:27,947 --> 00:46:29,181
<i>I'll get on the phone right now.</i>

808
00:46:29,182 --> 00:46:29,717
We called you!

809
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:31,550
We called you before we called outside counsel.

810
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:33,552
<i>A little late.
It's a little late.</i>

811
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:35,883
Give me a break.

812
00:46:38,857 --> 00:46:40,791
How you doing, Don?

813
00:46:40,792 --> 00:46:42,259
<i>I'm hanging in, Cal. You?</i>

814
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,091
Good. Good.

815
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:48,498
This source have anything else I might need to do my job?

816
00:46:48,499 --> 00:46:49,632
Wait a minute.

817
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,901
Nothing, all right?
This was it,

818
00:46:51,902 --> 00:46:54,563
<i>and we've kept it for less than a day.</i>

819
00:46:55,072 --> 00:46:58,641
<i>Detective, until last night, we didn't actually know what we had here.</i>

820
00:46:58,642 --> 00:47:00,506
Bullshit.

821
00:47:01,144 --> 00:47:03,645
<i>DONALD: Who do you think I am, Bambi's baby brother?</i>

822
00:47:03,646 --> 00:47:04,880
No, sir.

823
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:06,816
You knew exactly what you had.

824
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:10,286
You just decided that your need was greater than ours,

825
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:11,987
and now you have blood on your hands.

826
00:47:11,988 --> 00:47:14,647
CAL: Hold on. CAMERON: Detective, look.

827
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:16,959
The thesis that we are pursuing

828
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,563
involves a certain company that Congressman Collins is investigating.

829
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:23,665
DONALD: What, this is corporate conspiracies

830
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:25,733
that threaten the highest levels?

831
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:29,036
<i>All my years on the job, I've only ever seen that on TV.</i>

832
00:47:29,037 --> 00:47:32,440
<i>All the years I've known you, you've only ever watched sports on TV.</i>

833
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:36,610
CAMERON: So, Detective, in exchange for our cooperation,

834
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:39,312
can we be assured that you will open your books to us?

835
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:41,872
Quid pro quo?

836
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,854
<i>If we decide to go public with this, we'll give you six hours,</i>

837
00:47:47,855 --> 00:47:49,088
<i>but that's the end of it.</i>

838
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:50,890
This is an open homicide investigation.

839
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:52,725
You slow us down, endanger the public

840
00:47:52,726 --> 00:47:54,493
any more than you already have,

841
00:47:54,494 --> 00:47:55,795
<i>it won't be pretty.</i>

842
00:47:55,796 --> 00:47:57,263
<i>For the record, I'm still not happy</i>

843
00:47:57,264 --> 00:47:58,697
the way you presented the evidence.

844
00:47:58,698 --> 00:48:01,893
<i>I'm just gonna put that out there.</i>

845
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:06,571
CAMERON: Police gossip being what it is,

846
00:48:06,572 --> 00:48:08,540
<i>I'm guessing that even Entertainment Tonight</i>

847
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:11,409
will know as much as we do within 48 hours.

848
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,710
<i>So we've gotta have something solid today.</i>

849
00:48:13,711 --> 00:48:16,313
That means no assumptions, no unnamed sources.

850
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:17,619
Not fast and loose.

851
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:19,637
I want this thing wrung out.

852
00:48:19,985 --> 00:48:24,148
<i>Damned if we can't do a better job of it than those cops.</i>

853
00:48:25,224 --> 00:48:27,554
Della, how are you?

854
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:29,519
<i>I'm good.</i>

855
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:31,028
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

856
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:32,229
Good, okay.

857
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,397
Well, you take Sonia Baker, okay?

858
00:48:33,398 --> 00:48:35,265
I want to know everything that we can about her,

859
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:38,101
who she knew, who she blew, the color of her knickers.

860
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:40,432
Got it. Point-Corp?

861
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:42,104
Okay. Hank and Pete, you work with Cal.

862
00:48:42,105 --> 00:48:43,539
Cool.

863
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,174
The rule on this one is discretion.

864
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:49,545
This is not a good subject for gossip over drinks at the Monocle,

865
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:52,784
or spliffs in the stationery cupboard, you.

866
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:54,762
<i>I'm... I'm offended, truly.</i>

867
00:48:54,763 --> 00:48:55,784
CAMERON: Well, be offended.

868
00:48:55,785 --> 00:48:57,686
Go downstairs, get your stuff, bring it in here,

869
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:59,821
because this is your new home.

870
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:01,490
Go on!

871
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:04,121
- Okay! Yes, yes, yes.
- Speed of light.

872
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,932
Cal? Any conflict of interest here?

873
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:18,430
Nope.

874
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:21,941
<i>SLATOFF: Perhaps this is a good opportunity</i>

875
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:23,810
<i>to address another issue that's been discussed</i>

876
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:27,146
<i>during these hearings, your price structure.</i>

877
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:29,615
<i>Surely, and I thank you for giving me</i>

878
00:49:29,616 --> 00:49:32,482
<i>an opportunity to touch on that today.</i>

879
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:35,255
<i>Our price structure follows the Defense Department model</i>

880
00:49:35,256 --> 00:49:37,857
<i>as established in the first Gulf War,</i>

881
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:40,392
<i>adjusted, of course, for inflation.</i>

882
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:43,896
<i>Happily, what's costing us so much this time around</i>

883
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:48,066
<i>are some incredible advances in on-field medical care.</i>

884
00:49:48,067 --> 00:49:49,671
<i>But, simply, we're now keeping more...</i>

885
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:52,037
<i>Sir, I'm sorry. Just... when...</i>

886
00:49:52,038 --> 00:49:54,338
<i>When you were in the military, did you see any combat duty?</i>

887
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:55,940
<i>No, sir, I did not. No.</i>

888
00:49:55,941 --> 00:49:57,975
<i>Do you think if you had, you might see things differently?</i>

889
00:49:57,976 --> 00:49:59,877
<i>MAN: We're all aware of your war record, Congressman.</i>

890
00:49:59,878 --> 00:50:01,379
<i>STEPHEN: I'm not talking about my record.</i>

891
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,948
<i>I'm talking about the numerous allegations of atrocities</i>

892
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:08,118
<i>committed by Point-Corp and its subsidiary contractors</i>

893
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:10,787
<i>against the civilian population in Iraq and Afghanistan.</i>

894
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:13,924
<i>MAN: Those are unsubstantiated allegations.</i>

895
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:16,593
<i>Okay. This is straightforward.</i>

896
00:50:16,594 --> 00:50:20,029
<i>Since a war on terror was declared,</i>

897
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:24,728
<i>has your personal net worth gone up by more than $250 million?</i>

898
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,940
<i>Straightforward question.</i>

899
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:35,043
<i>Excuse me, I was told that personal financial data</i>

900
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:38,046
<i>would not be addressed in open session.</i>

901
00:50:38,047 --> 00:50:39,878
<i>Adapt.</i>

902
00:50:41,884 --> 00:50:43,717
<i>Isn't that your slogan?</i>

903
00:50:43,718 --> 00:50:45,913
<i>"Adapt and Achieve?"</i>

904
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:49,456
<i>It's on the brochure here.</i>

905
00:50:49,792 --> 00:50:51,448
<i>"Commoda et Confice".</i>

906
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:53,261
<i>You have it in Latin.</i>

907

<i>MAN: Your point being?</i>

908
00:50:54,562 --> 00:50:56,863
<i>Putting war in the hands of mercenaries</i>

909
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:59,099
<i>and those who consider it a business</i>

910
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,401
<i>is a contradiction in terms in any language.</i>

911
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:03,904
<i>May I remind you, sir, that the wars</i>

912
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:06,373
<i>this country fought, that defined it,</i>

913
00:51:06,374 --> 00:51:09,442
<i>were fought despite what they cost, not because of it.</i>

914
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:12,278
<i>I didn't come here for a lesson in morality, Congressman.</i>

915
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:14,714
<i>No, I expect you didn't.</i>

916
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:17,316
<i>Well, especially from you.</i>

917
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:18,884
<i>The men who work for Point-Corp,</i>

918
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:21,052
<i>the men you dishonor by calling them mercenaries</i>

919
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:26,456
<i>are, by and large, retired American military personnel.</i>

920
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:30,328
<i>It's a great system, isn't it?</i>

921
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:34,431
<i>We pay to train these men, and you get rich by killing them.</i>

922
00:51:44,141 --> 00:51:46,809
<i>PETE: Point-Corp, well, they're on a roll.</i>

923
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:49,679
<i>They just bought 60,000 acres to expand their facility.</i>

924
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,014
- 60,000 acres?
- Yeah.

925
00:51:51,015 --> 00:51:52,081
Where?

926
00:51:52,082 --> 00:51:54,450
In Conway, North Carolina.

927
00:51:54,451 --> 00:51:57,386
The locals call it Little Baghdad.

928
00:51:57,387 --> 00:51:59,354
Not so little.

929
00:51:59,355 --> 00:52:03,026
<i>HANK: They've also got some interesting real estate locally.</i>

930
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:05,962

931
00:52:05,963 --> 00:52:07,530

<i>"Medal of Freedom Initiative".

933
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,300
<i>PETE: It's a lobbying interest.</i>

934
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:13,835
<i>HANK: Yeah, according to the website,</i>

935
00:52:13,836 --> 00:52:15,303
<i>MOFI, Medal of Freedom Initiative,</i>

<i>PETE: We went down there.</i>

942
00:52:28,147 --> 00:52:29,617
<i>The place is totally empty...</i>

943
00:52:29,618 --> 00:52:31,952
<i>Like they're just waiting for all their new recruits.</i>

944
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:34,320
Did they outsource to Mumbai or something?

945
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:38,018
Or are they just getting ready for an expansion?

946
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:40,084

<i>I just...</i>

954
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:03,915
Hey, Michael, I need someone to help me dig

955
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:06,184
a little deeper into Point-Corp.

956
00:53:06,185 --> 00:53:07,953
I need somebody on the inside,

957
00:53:07,954 --> 00:53:10,818
somebody who knows the way they operate.

958
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,494
<i>WOMAN: She owed everybody money.</i>

959
00:53:16,495 --> 00:53:18,930

00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:20,896

00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,333
<i>- I winn.

00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:24,934
- You can't move.

963
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,070
Who is this? He looks familiar.

00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,150

<i>How'd you get it?</i>

981
00:54:06,774 --> 00:54:09,143
I had to agree to go on not one,

982
00:54:09,144 --> 00:54:11,908
but two dates with a sweaty guy named Vic.

983
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:16,215
<i>Don't even ask me.</i>

<i>Rhonda Silver's number.</i>

<i>Nope, that's what you call damn fine reporting.</i>

<i>I'm actually an old friend of Rhonda's from school.</i>

993

I'm in town for the day, and I thought maybe I'd stop by and see her.

994
00:54:50,248 --> 00:54:52,416
Do you think I could show up at her work?

995
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:54,942
Would that be all right?

996
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:11,657
Actually, sir, can I call you back?

997
00:55:12,736 --> 00:55:14,725
That page and the next page.

998
00:55:14,971 --> 00:55:17,706
HANK: This guy, Jerry Symes, local politician,

999
00:55:17,707 --> 00:55:19,541
he campaigns against the expansion,

1000
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,310
and then he dies in a freak car accident.

1001
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:23,612
<i>CAL: All right, what does "freak car accident" mean?</i>

1002
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:25,480
<i>Middle of the day...
He's driving on the open road...</i>

1003
00:55:25,481 --> 00:55:26,614
- No witnesses. Perfect weather,
- 30 miles an hour...

1004
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:27,815
- No skid marks...
- Car turns over... Oh!

1005
00:55:27,816 --> 00:55:31,018
And the police think
it might be sleep apnea.

1006
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:34,511
Cal. Sorry, I really
need to talk to you.

1007
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:37,892
What do you got?

1008
00:55:37,893 --> 00:55:39,326
So, I was looking for images of Sonia

1009
00:55:39,327 --> 00:55:41,895
in the Metro security footage, right?

1010
00:55:41,896 --> 00:55:47,232
And 20 seconds after she went into the blind spot, this guy appears.

1011
00:55:47,402 --> 00:55:49,130
Okay?

1012
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:55,305
I think that I saw him last night at the hospital.

1013
00:56:01,182 --> 00:56:03,308
Are you sure?

1014
00:56:16,862 --> 00:56:18,529
<i>Michael, it's Cal.</i>

1015
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:22,761
Your Point-Corp insider, I need to meet him, now.

1016
00:56:52,729 --> 00:56:54,462
I want you to know something.

1017
00:56:54,463 --> 00:56:56,164
I love my country.

1018
00:56:56,165 --> 00:56:57,432
I love the military.

1019
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:58,633
My aim here is to save them.

1020
00:56:58,634 --> 00:56:59,869
You understand my terms?

1021
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,037
I will not give you my name.

1022
00:57:01,038 --> 00:57:03,606
I will not give you my rank in the Point-Corp military structure,

1023
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:05,373
or the in and out dates of my service.

1024
00:57:05,374 --> 00:57:07,364
Understand.

1025
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:10,111
<i>CAL: I'm looking for a guy that Point-Corp</i>

00:57:11,847 --> 00:57:13,281
Total deniability.

1028
00:57:13,282 --> 00:57:15,583
Our mutual friend at DOD thought

1029
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:18,278
you might be able to help us find him.

1030
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,282
<i>I don't know. I'll check it out.</i>

1031
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,795
<i>So, what's your understanding of the Point-Corp MO?</i>

1032
00:57:27,796 --> 00:57:29,263
Their MO?

1033
00:57:29,264 --> 00:57:31,464
They do whatever the hell they want.

1034
00:57:31,465 --> 00:57:33,633
These soldiers are answerable to no one.

1035
00:57:33,634 --> 00:57:35,768
<i>They're loyal to nothing but a paycheck.</i>

1036
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:38,571
<i>It's the Muslim terror gold rush.</i>

1037
00:57:38,572 --> 00:57:40,773
- You've been watching these hearings?
- Yeah.

1038
00:57:40,774 --> 00:57:43,275
So, the head of the committee there, Stephen Collins...

1039
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:44,509
<i>He's finished.</i>

1040
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:46,912
<i>They'll just keep knocking him down until he goes away.</i>

1041
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:48,847
<i>Do you have any idea what he's threatening here?</i>

1042
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:52,017
This is $30 or $40 billion annually.

1043
00:57:52,018 --> 00:57:53,719
<i>That's wrath of God money.</i>

1044
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,087
The hearings are saying 3 or 4.

1045
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:58,723
Overseas.
The real money is what Point-Corp

1046
00:57:58,724 --> 00:58:01,692
stands to make in its domestic operations.

1047
00:58:01,693 --> 00:58:03,661
<i>I wasn't aware that they had any.</i>

1048
00:58:03,662 --> 00:58:08,325
Who was sent in for crowd control after Hurricane Katrina? Us.

1049
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:10,266
Private security contractors deputized

1050
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:12,598
to shoot at American citizens.

1051
00:58:12,937 --> 00:58:16,737
<i>Who's training Chicago police on new interrogation techniques?</i>

1052
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:19,709
Soon, Point-Corp will take over from the NSA

1053
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:22,940
on phone taps, terrorist databases, all of it.

1054
00:58:23,214 --> 00:58:25,181
<i>It's a fundamental restructuring</i>

1055
00:58:25,182 --> 00:58:27,741
of domestic intelligence policy.

1056
00:58:28,018 --> 00:58:30,954
It is the privatization of Homeland Security.

1057
00:58:30,955 --> 00:58:33,722
Billions and billions of dollars.

1058
00:58:33,723 --> 00:58:36,258
<i>Now you really think they're gonna forfeit all that</i>

1059
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:38,327
<i>because some hero from the seventh district</i>

1060
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:40,329
<i>of Pennsylvania thinks that they should?</i>

1061
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:41,819
Hey.

1062
00:58:42,966 --> 00:58:46,067
<i>CAL: I just got told by a former Point-Corp employee</i>

1063
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:48,770
<i>that they have a plan to monopolize domestic security</i>

1064
00:58:48,771 --> 00:58:50,605
<i>that's worth about $40 billion a year.</i>

1065
00:58:50,606 --> 00:58:52,373
<i>Is that true?</i>

1066
00:58:52,374 --> 00:58:54,242
<i>STEPHEN: Yes.
 CAL: How?</i>

1067
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:56,843
You cannot connect anything that I tell you back to me.

1068
00:58:56,844 --> 00:58:58,111
- You understand?
- Of course.

1069
00:58:58,112 --> 00:58:59,601
Okay.

1070
00:59:00,248 --> 00:59:03,517
Last year, 47 companies bid on major Homeland Security contracts.

1071
00:59:03,518 --> 00:59:06,253
Of those, 16 companies were granted the bids.

1072
00:59:06,254 --> 00:59:10,389
Of those, I could make connections between 14 companies,

1073
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,425
<i>and I'm not just talking about someone leaving one company</i>

1074
00:59:12,426 --> 00:59:13,526
and go work for another.

1075
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:15,494
<i>I'm talking about shared banking practices.</i>

1076
00:59:15,495 --> 00:59:17,396
<i>I'm talking about collusive behavior.</i>

1077
00:59:17,397 --> 00:59:19,865
<i>Now, my belief is, when all's said and done</i>

1078
00:59:19,866 --> 00:59:22,267
and when the veil is pulled away,

1079
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:25,896
you will not see 14 individual companies.

1080
00:59:26,038 --> 00:59:30,373
You will see one company. You understand?

1081
00:59:31,244 --> 00:59:32,578
<i>And you've been digging around</i>

1082
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:33,845
trying to make those connections clear.

1083
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:36,177
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

1084
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:38,983
And Sonia was working on that?

1085
00:59:38,984 --> 00:59:40,985
She was my lead researcher.

1086
00:59:40,986 --> 00:59:42,954
She was involved in everything we did.

1087
00:59:42,955 --> 00:59:45,623
<i>They're gonna get you, Stephen, one way or another.</i>

1088
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:49,259
They got 40 billion good reasons to want you out of the way.

1089
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,761
You gotta go on the record.

1090
00:59:50,762 --> 00:59:52,196
Swing the spotlight back on them.

1091
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:55,188
You gotta protect yourself, man.

1092
00:59:55,967 --> 01:00:00,129
You go out there and find me evidence

1093
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:03,534
<i>linking Sonia's death to Point-Corp.</i>

1094
01:00:04,808 --> 01:00:07,001
I will go on the record.

1095
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:10,109
I will shout this thing from the rooftops.

1096
01:00:10,613 --> 01:00:12,671
I can do that.

1097
01:00:16,152 --> 01:00:18,360
<i>Alright. I gotta get back.</i>

1098
01:00:18,386 --> 01:00:19,888
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

1099
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:22,323
- Stephen.
- Yeah?

1100
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:24,358
Just watch your back.

1101
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:26,622
You, too.

1102
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:37,270
Hi. Is Rhonda here?

1103
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:39,534
Yeah, she's just right over there.

1104
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,974
<i># Whoa #</i>

1105
01:00:40,975 --> 01:00:43,511
<i># I'm walking on sunshine #</i>

1106
01:00:43,512 --> 01:00:45,346
<i># Whoa #</i>

1107
01:00:45,347 --> 01:00:47,981
<i># I'm walking on sunshine #</i>

1108
01:00:47,982 --> 01:00:49,816
<i># Whoa #</i>

1109
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,885
<i># And don't it feel good #</i>

1110
01:00:51,886 --> 01:00:53,086
Yeah!

1111
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:56,954
<i>DELLA: Cal, you're not gonna believe what Sonia's old roommate just told me.</i>

1112
01:00:57,424 --> 01:00:59,792
<i>You're right.
 I don't believe a word of it.</i>

1113
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:02,027
You got no corroboration, no independent witness,

1114
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:04,196
and she obviously has a financial motivation.

1115
01:01:04,197 --> 01:01:06,265
<i>We've got Sonia Baker's roommate claiming</i>

1116
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:08,300
she had a threesome with Stephen Collins,

1117
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:09,468
and you want to ignore that?

1118
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:10,846
I am not saying ignore it.

1119
01:01:10,872 --> 01:01:12,170
I am saying consider it.

1120
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:14,171
Consider how it impacts everything else we have,

1121
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:16,173
and consider that she is full of shit!

1122
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:18,543
<i>Yeah, but, Cal, she's also saying</i>

1123
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:21,979
<i>that Stephen paid off Sonia's $40,000 credit card debt.</i>

1124
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,381
That is a story.

1125
01:01:23,382 --> 01:01:25,282
<i>Somebody's gonna put that on the front page.</i>

1126
01:01:25,283 --> 01:01:28,084
Okay, is that the right thing to do?

1127
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:30,376
<i>Look, it's your half of the story.</i>

1128
01:01:30,402 --> 01:01:31,521
<i>It's your scoop.</i>

1129
01:01:31,522 --> 01:01:34,650
Your decision. 
Do whatever you want.

1174
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:12,287
I tried to call.

1175
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:17,093
I mean, I actually did call about 12 times, but I hung up every time.

1176
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:20,632
<i>Well, you know, I'm glad you dropped by,</i>

1177

<i>'cause I've been wanting to talk to you.</i>

01:02:27,341 --> 01:02:29,976
Remember you brought that girl from Humboldt?

1179
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:31,444
Soleil, or whatever her name was.

1180
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:32,612
Luna.

1181
01:02:32,613 --> 01:02:35,513
<i>Luna. That's right.</i>

1182
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:39,049
And you two were stoned the whole time.

1183
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,150
Yep.

1184
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:42,120
You managed to flip the boat, and we lost everything.

1185
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:43,154
We had to walk the rest of the way...

1186
01:02:43,155 --> 01:02:44,222
We flipped the boat?

1187
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,981
You did.

1188
01:02:45,992 --> 01:02:48,226
It was an adventure.

1189
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,395
That's what you kept saying.

1190
01:02:50,396 --> 01:02:51,596
Irish wine.

1191
01:02:51,597 --> 01:02:53,391
Whiskey?

1192
01:02:54,102 --> 01:02:56,531
<i>- Cheers.
- Slainte.</i>

1193
01:03:01,643 --> 01:03:03,867
- So...
- So...

1194
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,581
- I've been...
- I wanted to ask...

1195
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:09,113
- Sorry.
- You first.

1196
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,881
I was wondering,

1197
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:19,795
do you think Stephen could have pulled together $40,000 without you knowing?

1198
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,996
What?

1199
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,264
Well, it's a story that might break

1200
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,834
that basically accuses Stephen of doing something

1201
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:29,273
that would require his having access to a large amount of cash.

1202
01:03:29,274 --> 01:03:32,176
I was just wondering, could he do that?

1203
01:03:32,177 --> 01:03:33,478
A story that might break?

1204
01:03:33,479 --> 01:03:35,413
You mean something that you're involved in?

1205
01:03:35,414 --> 01:03:37,315
- Indirectly.
- What're you doing?

1206
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:38,921
I'm trying to help Stephen.

1207
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:40,586
I'm trying to protect you.

1208
01:03:40,587 --> 01:03:42,845
Bullshit!

1209
01:03:44,424 --> 01:03:47,115
You always do this.

1210
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:51,363
Sometimes I feel like we all made this deal,

1211
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:55,502
and it works out great for you and Stephen, and not for me.

1212
01:03:55,503 --> 01:03:56,970
And instead of us just figuring it out,

1213
01:03:56,971 --> 01:04:01,869
you guys are just fine walking around as if nothing ever happened.

1214
01:04:06,782 --> 01:04:08,744
Okay.

1215
01:04:11,787 --> 01:04:13,688
Okay, let's start over.

1216
01:04:13,689 --> 01:04:15,157
I come here to tell you that I'm thinking..

1217
01:04:15,158 --> 01:04:19,023
...about walking away from my marriage, and you say what?

1218
01:04:19,196 --> 01:04:21,166
I say it's too late.

1219
01:04:21,192 --> 01:04:23,357
We're way past this.

1220
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,501
You made your choice.

1221
01:04:25,502 --> 01:04:27,004
Because you wouldn't step up.

1222
01:04:27,005 --> 01:04:29,502
What do you mean?

1223
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,471
Not then, not now, not in college.

1224
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:39,050
I'm saying that you're asking me for something that's not real.

1225
01:04:39,085 --> 01:04:41,776
That's what I'm saying.

1226
01:04:43,423 --> 01:04:45,647
Annie...

1227
01:04:57,071 --> 01:04:59,673
We have two mortgages.

1228
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:01,976
We have the place in Virginia.

1229
01:05:01,977 --> 01:05:04,245
We've got the apartment here.

1230
01:05:04,246 --> 01:05:05,680
Basically, we spend everything we make,

1231
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:09,584
so there's no way Stephen could have given anyone $40,000..

1232
01:05:09,585 --> 01:05:12,583
..without me knowing about it.

1233
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:16,791
Annie... It's okay.

1234
01:05:18,963 --> 01:05:21,654
Now I'm just a source,

1235
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:24,993
so the pressure's off.

1236
01:05:56,337 --> 01:05:59,437
<i>- Hello?
- Who's the great-looking blonde, Cal?</i>

1237
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,275
Who's this?

1238
01:06:01,276 --> 01:06:03,409
<i>Across the street.</i>

1239
01:06:17,661 --> 01:06:20,386
I like your style, man.

1240
01:06:20,997 --> 01:06:22,231
I got something for you.

1241
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:24,834
And you couldn't just ring the doorbell?

1242
01:06:25,003 --> 01:06:26,904
Precautions.

1243
01:06:26,905 --> 01:06:31,008
The guy in the photo, I asked around. He's definitely a grunt.

1244
01:06:31,009 --> 01:06:34,479
Buddy of mine used to see him at security trade shows.

1245
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,351
Never knew his name, but he worked for an old-timer called Fred Summers.

1246
01:06:39,352 --> 01:06:42,316
Does alarm installations, shit like that.

1247
01:06:42,388 --> 01:06:44,956
Here's Fred's address.

1248
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:47,285
Crystal City.

1249
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:53,062
Thanks.

1250
01:08:21,499 --> 01:08:23,000
Mr. Summers?

1251
01:08:32,545 --> 01:08:34,012
Hey.

1252
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:36,613
Who you looking for?

1253
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:38,389
Fred. Fred Summers.

1254
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:39,617
Do you know him?

1255
01:08:39,618 --> 01:08:40,685
Fred's not here.

1256
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:42,354
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

1257
01:08:42,355 --> 01:08:43,990
You live here.
 You're his roommate.

1258
01:08:43,991 --> 01:08:46,181
- Sorry.
- Okay.

1259
01:08:46,194 --> 01:08:47,661
Do you know where he might be?

1260
01:08:47,662 --> 01:08:49,296
He's overseas. He shipped out last week.

1261
01:08:49,297 --> 01:08:51,024
- Overseas like...
- Look,

1262
01:08:51,025 --> 01:08:52,499
I don't really know what Fred's into, okay?

1263
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,368
He ships out, and he comes back.

1264
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:57,537
Okay.
Could you pass a message?

1265
01:08:57,873 --> 01:09:00,200
Take it easy.

1266
01:09:00,542 --> 01:09:02,971
All right. Okay.

1267
01:09:17,329 --> 01:09:19,430
Hey, Joey?
Cal McAffrey.

1268
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:20,798
Yeah, yeah, shut up.
Listen! Listen!

1269
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,990
Tell Bill he's gotta send some cops to 566...

1270
01:13:21,532 --> 01:13:23,235
DELLA: So?
DONALD: No sign of the guy.

1271
01:13:23,236 --> 01:13:25,637
Did you get a name?

1272
01:13:25,638 --> 01:13:27,340
How about the apartment?

1273
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:28,854
You find something?

1274
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:30,375
Nothing?

1275
01:13:30,376 --> 01:13:32,444
Place belongs to a guy named Fred Summers,

1276
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:35,848
except Fred passed away last March.

1277
01:13:35,849 --> 01:13:38,551
Neighbors say that his nephew stays there from time to time..

1278
01:13:38,552 --> 01:13:40,820
..while the probate is being worked out.

1279
01:13:40,821 --> 01:13:42,622
Except he doesn't have a nephew.

1280
01:13:42,623 --> 01:13:45,349
You're catching on fast.

1281
01:13:45,527 --> 01:13:48,362
Cal, I thought we had an understanding.

1282
01:13:48,363 --> 01:13:50,197
You were supposed to share your information with us.

1283
01:13:50,198 --> 01:13:51,298
Do you remember that?

1284
01:13:51,299 --> 01:13:55,836
Don, I went there to talk to a guy named Fred Summers, right,

1285
01:13:55,837 --> 01:13:57,439
who I now find out is deceased.

1286
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,275
Do you think I would've gone there

1287
01:13:59,276 --> 01:14:01,076
if I knew what I was gonna be walking into?

1288
01:14:01,077 --> 01:14:02,578
Just happened to be there, huh?

1289
01:14:02,579 --> 01:14:04,213
Yeah.

1290
01:14:04,214 --> 01:14:05,848
Now, do you mind if I get back on with my story?

1291
01:14:05,849 --> 01:14:08,418
It's not a story. It's a case!

1292
01:14:08,419 --> 01:14:12,355
And... And just so you know, a girl by the name of Mandi Brokaw,

1293
01:14:12,356 --> 01:14:15,854
16, junkie, turned up dead tonight.

1294
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,657
Probable homicide.

1295
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:21,465
She look familiar?

1296
01:14:21,466 --> 01:14:22,800
We got her fingerprints off of those

1297
01:14:22,801 --> 01:14:25,901
surveillance photos you so kindly gave us.

1298
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:33,736
<i>Hello, I'm Rhonda Silver.</i>

1299
01:14:34,748 --> 01:14:39,111
<i>Like I said, that's what he called "being in committee".</i>

1300
01:14:40,888 --> 01:14:42,822
I know you got shot at last night,

1301
01:14:42,823 --> 01:14:44,725
and I know I should be making you a nice cup of cocoa,

1302
01:14:44,726 --> 01:14:47,094
but I'm just so bloody angry!

1303
01:14:47,095 --> 01:14:51,458
I mean, the decision, I'm assuming, was that this was not news.

1304
01:14:51,633 --> 01:14:53,767
We... Look, we didn't...
We were worried that...

1305
01:14:53,768 --> 01:14:56,438
It was my call, Cam. All right?

1306
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:58,640
I didn't, and I don't believe her.

1307
01:14:58,641 --> 01:15:01,076
She's not credible.

1308
01:15:01,077 --> 01:15:02,777
She was just trying to sell us her sexy

1309
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:05,080
scrapbook photos of her friend, Sonia Baker.

1310
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:06,281
Her dead friend.

1311
01:15:06,282 --> 01:15:08,819
Yeah, well, why the hell couldn't we have printed that?

1312
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:11,722
A waitress comes forward with a claim about a sex scandal.

1313
01:15:11,723 --> 01:15:13,357
Great, that's an A-1 story.

1314
01:15:13,358 --> 01:15:14,925
Then he denies it.
There's another story.

1315
01:15:14,926 --> 01:15:17,561
And then... And then one of them cracks, and there's another story.

1316
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:19,297
Meantime, people are reading about it,

1317
01:15:19,298 --> 01:15:22,166
and they're reading us about it, because we had it first!

1318
01:15:22,167 --> 01:15:23,268
Except we didn't, did we?

1319
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:26,404
No, no, no, 'cause some wanker decided it was beneath us.

1320
01:15:26,405 --> 01:15:28,873
Look at her, come on!
 Look at her!

1321
01:15:28,874 --> 01:15:29,909
She's a sideshow!

1322
01:15:29,935 --> 01:15:31,310
It's a smear campaign.

1323
01:15:31,311 --> 01:15:33,045
It's exactly what these companies do

1324
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:34,747
to destroy people who get in their way.

1325
01:15:34,748 --> 01:15:39,214
The true story here, the real story here, is Point-Corp.

1326
01:15:39,319 --> 01:15:44,321
The real story is the sinking of this bloody newspaper!

1327
01:15:45,093 --> 01:15:47,124
Christ!

1328
01:15:51,266 --> 01:15:53,735
We have new management to answer to now, Cal,

1329
01:15:53,736 --> 01:15:57,205
and they are interested in sales, not discretion.

1330
01:15:57,206 --> 01:15:59,775
And how am...
 How am I gonna tell them that we are now behind a story

1331
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:02,603
we were once in front of?

1332
01:16:03,646 --> 01:16:06,916
Well, we're running with what we've got today.

1333
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:09,278
No! No.

1334
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,155
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

1335
01:16:12,156 --> 01:16:13,790
We've got more than enough to go with.

1336
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:16,428
You run with it, and you're gonna frighten off the wildlife.

1337
01:16:16,429 --> 01:16:18,029
And we haven't got the rest of the story.

1338
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:22,166
I do not give a shit about the rest of the story!

1339
01:16:22,368 --> 01:16:26,538
We're going to press... tonight.

1340
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:29,231
You've got eight hours.

1341
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,878
WOMAN: You look tired. Want some coffee?

1342
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:35,274
Yeah, that's nice.

1343
01:16:37,017 --> 01:16:39,820
Can you hold on for one second?

1344
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:42,189
George, a word with you for a minute?

1345
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:44,721
- Sure, Steve.
- Thanks.

1346
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:47,869
Listen, I just wanted you to know my speaking up..

1347
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,626
..in the hearings the other day was not meant..

1348
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:53,300
.. in any way as a gesture of disrespect to you

1349
01:16:53,303 --> 01:16:57,439
or a lack of gratitude for the support that you've shown me.

1350
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,674
No, no. Not at all.

1351
01:16:58,675 --> 01:17:00,609
It was a very impressive performance.

1352
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,678
You have your passions, I understand that.

1353
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:03,724
All right, good.

1354
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,749
Well, that's a relief to know.

1355
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,518
You have your show horses, and you have your work horses.

1356
01:17:08,519 --> 01:17:12,347
I'm sure we can all find a way to get along.

1357
01:17:19,631 --> 01:17:21,365
There's no way.

1358
01:17:21,366 --> 01:17:23,067
There is no way we can meet that deadline.

1359
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:23,682
Yes, we can.

1360
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,138
All right, guys, we're getting our balls busted.

1361
01:17:26,139 --> 01:17:26,639
What'd you got?

1362
01:17:26,665 --> 01:17:28,174
All right, the guy you had us check out,

1363
01:17:28,175 --> 01:17:30,410
Dominic Foy, turns out he's a gold mine.

1364
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:31,511
CAL: Dominic?
- Foy.

1365
01:17:31,512 --> 01:17:34,347
- Right.
- He's a guy I keep hearing about.

1366
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:37,583
A friend of Sonia's in all the surveillance photos where she's crying.

1367
01:17:37,584 --> 01:17:41,155
- And he's in Rhonda's cell phone shots.
- Mmm..hmm.

1368
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,256
Okay, so, is this Halloween,

1369
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,024
- or is he some kind of freak?
 PETE: Freak.

1370
01:17:44,025 --> 01:17:45,459
He runs a legitimate PR business.

1371
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,827
Handful of corporate clients.

1372
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,395
Just likes to party on the weekends.

1373
01:17:48,396 --> 01:17:50,231
PETE: Special parties.

1374
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,000
- Tell him the good part.
- Yeah,

1375
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,568
mostly works out of the Daily Grill,..

1376
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:55,069
..but guess where his registered office is?

1377
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:56,738
- Where?
- Guess.

1378
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:57,872
Where?

1379
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,541
HANK: The Watergate.

1380
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:02,145
- Oh. PETE: Not only that, Suite 413.

1381
01:18:02,146 --> 01:18:05,782
Same suite as the Medal of Freedom Initiative, which is...

1382
01:18:05,783 --> 01:18:09,111
The lobbying subsidiary of Point-Corp.

1383
01:18:15,861 --> 01:18:17,328
Let's get him on tape.

1384
01:18:17,329 --> 01:18:18,896
PETE: You want me to call Rodney and get the gear?

1385
01:18:18,897 --> 01:18:20,164
Yeah, same place.

1386
01:18:20,165 --> 01:18:22,033
What... I'm sorry.

1387
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:23,868
You want to put him on tape?

1388
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:25,730
Yeah.

1389
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:28,707
What are we, cops now?

1390
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,242
That's totally illegal.

1391
01:18:30,243 --> 01:18:34,046
If Dominic Foy can connect Sonia Baker to Point-Corp,

1392
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:35,380
he's gonna be under a lot of pressure

1393
01:18:35,381 --> 01:18:37,451
to recant anything he might tell us, all right?

1394
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:38,398
So we put him on tape.

1395
01:18:38,424 --> 01:18:39,386
That's our insurance.

1396
01:18:39,387 --> 01:18:41,622
And why do you think he's even gonna talk to you?

1397
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:43,491
Because he's scared.

1398
01:18:43,492 --> 01:18:45,192
How do you know?

1399
01:18:45,193 --> 01:18:47,485
Because I'm gonna scare him.

1400
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:23,533
Hey, is that your Cadillac out there?

1401
01:19:24,804 --> 01:19:26,272
Yeah.

1402
01:19:26,273 --> 01:19:30,609
V-8 XLR, 320 horsepower, adaptive cruise control, heads-up display?

1403
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:33,078
- That's the one.
- That's a hell of an impressive car.

1404
01:19:33,079 --> 01:19:35,270
Yes, I know.

1405
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:40,211
What do you got in your gay-rage?

1406
01:19:40,354 --> 01:19:43,557
- Excuse me?
- Your gay-rage. Your garage.

1407
01:19:43,558 --> 01:19:45,125
- Alright.
- You drive the same thing?

1408
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:49,331
- No, I don't. I have a 1990 Saab.
- Oh.

1409
01:19:49,332 --> 01:19:50,674
Yeah. I got velour seats.

1410
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,498
The passenger side one's ripped,

1411
01:19:52,499 --> 01:19:55,504
but... huh, it gets me from A to B, you know.

1412
01:19:55,505 --> 01:19:57,105
Sorry to hear that.

1413
01:19:57,106 --> 01:20:00,708
If only I could get a job in PR, right?

1414
01:20:03,714 --> 01:20:05,381
Who the hell are you?

1415
01:20:05,382 --> 01:20:07,750
Do you read the newspapers, Dominic?

1416
01:20:07,751 --> 01:20:09,253
- Sometimes.
- Okay.

1417
01:20:09,254 --> 01:20:11,422
I got something I wanna run by you, all right?

1418
01:20:11,423 --> 01:20:12,414
It ain't finished.

1419
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,791
I'm still working it up.

1420
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:16,760
Let's see how you feel about this.

1421
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:19,463
"Dominic Foy, a D.C. Public relations figure..

1422
01:20:19,464 --> 01:20:22,435
..with known ties to defense contractor Point-Corp

1423
01:20:22,436 --> 01:20:25,738
was yesterday linked to the death of a Capitol Hill staffer "Sonia Baker".

1424
01:20:25,739 --> 01:20:28,274
Alright, come on, what...
What're you a reporter?

1425
01:20:28,275 --> 01:20:29,298
This is not cool.

1426
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,043
This is definitely not cool.

1427
01:20:31,044 --> 01:20:32,846
- Very unprofessional.
- I'm just sitting here...

1428
01:20:32,847 --> 01:20:34,281
<i>Cal McAffrey from the Globe.</i>

1429
01:20:34,282 --> 01:20:35,682
Congratulations.
Keep it.

1430
01:20:35,683 --> 01:20:37,918
That's gonna run tomorrow unless

1431
01:20:37,919 --> 01:20:39,319
you can tell me what I need to know today.

1432
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,188
- I don't think so.
- I got a car out the back.

1433
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:43,390
I got a nice, safe place where you and I can talk.

1434
01:20:43,391 --> 01:20:44,790
Hey, hey, Saab.

1435
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:46,894
I don't know anything about anything, alright?

1436
01:20:46,895 --> 01:20:49,090
I'm a PR guy.
Got it?

1437
01:20:49,091 --> 01:20:50,998
Be that as it may, there's two ways

1438
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:53,167
this article can run, Dominic.

1439
01:20:53,168 --> 01:20:58,942
Without your name or with your name, and maybe even a photo from your website.

1440
01:20:58,943 --> 01:21:02,545
Now, who knows who that's gonna piss off and how badly?

1441
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:04,948
I'm trying to be your friend, Dominic, all right?

1442
01:21:04,949 --> 01:21:09,416
I'd hate to see you end up under a train like Sonia Baker.

1443
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,423
And you promised never to use my name, right?

1444
01:21:12,424 --> 01:21:13,758
Yes, I did.

1445
01:21:13,759 --> 01:21:15,693
This place is nice?
 It's classy?

1446
01:21:15,694 --> 01:21:18,191
- I'm gonna be
comfortable? - Uh-huh.

1447
01:21:36,718 --> 01:21:38,619
<i>DOMINIC: What kind of dump is this?</i>

1448
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,487
<i>Where have you brought me?</i>

1449
01:21:40,488 --> 01:21:42,089
<i>No booze in the mini-bar.</i>

1450
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,592
<i>There's no On Demand on the TV.</i>

1451
01:21:44,593 --> 01:21:45,960
<i>What kinda hotel is this?</i>

1452
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:47,862
<i>Little bit more of a motel, I'd say, isn't it?</i>

1453
01:21:47,863 --> 01:21:49,764
<i>CAL: Nobody's gonna find you here, Dominic.</i>

1454
01:21:49,765 --> 01:21:51,466
<i>DOMINIC: How are your beer-getting skills, sweet pea?</i>

1455
01:21:51,467 --> 01:21:54,437
<i>You want to go get Uncle Foy a nice frosty?</i>

1456
01:21:54,438 --> 01:21:55,771
<i>I'll time you. Christ.</i>

1457
01:21:55,772 --> 01:21:58,007
So, let's start from the beginning.

1458
01:21:58,008 --> 01:22:00,801
Where did you meet Sonia Baker?

1459
01:22:01,278 --> 01:22:02,878
Why don't we start with a little compensation?

1460
01:22:02,879 --> 01:22:06,284
This guy's stoned off his face, and now he wants a beer.

1461
01:22:06,285 --> 01:22:08,319
- Can I have one?
- Yeah.

1462
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,154
What's he taking exactly?

1463
01:22:10,155 --> 01:22:13,958
- Dude, downers.
- This guy's losing his shit.

1464
01:22:13,959 --> 01:22:17,095
For what? For what? Me helping you out.

1465
01:22:17,096 --> 01:22:19,531
Me losing my business. Me...

1466
01:22:19,532 --> 01:22:21,700
This bed's disgusting.

1467
01:22:21,701 --> 01:22:23,836
Compensate me, okay?

1468
01:22:23,837 --> 01:22:27,806
Okay, so you want to be paid to help solve Sonia's murder?

1469
01:22:27,807 --> 01:22:29,776
Save it, all right?
 I'm in PR.

1470
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:31,177
I know a little bit about phrasing questions.

1471
01:22:31,178 --> 01:22:32,712
Why don't you try phrasing it like this?

1472
01:22:32,713 --> 01:22:35,815
Would I like to be paid for helping you get a book deal?

1473
01:22:35,816 --> 01:22:37,350
Nobody's here for a book deal.

1474
01:22:37,351 --> 01:22:38,818
Really? Everybody wants a book deal.

1475
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:41,156
And I'd like my cut, okay?
That's just fair.

1476
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:42,891
When did you meet Sonia?

1477
01:22:42,892 --> 01:22:44,559
Compensation, compensation.

1478
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:46,061
You came here to talk, Dominic.

1479
01:22:46,062 --> 01:22:49,164
You know, mouse, I'm the talent and I don't like the vibe.

1480
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:51,600
So why don't you change that up, okay?

1481
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:52,935
It's a non-smoking room.

1482
01:22:52,936 --> 01:22:54,830
It's under your name.

1483
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:56,973
He's a douche. I love this guy.

1484
01:22:56,974 --> 01:22:58,808
<i>I wanna call my lawyer.</i>

1485
01:22:58,809 --> 01:23:00,610
<i>I think you should think that through.</i>

1486
01:23:00,611 --> 01:23:02,779
<i>Can we get a signal in this rat hole?</i>

1487
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,482
<i>Why don't you think it through? Hmm?</i>

1488
01:23:05,483 --> 01:23:08,051
Dominic, let me just lay this out for you one more time,

1489
01:23:08,052 --> 01:23:09,386
<i>because I don't think you're getting it!</i>

1490
01:23:09,387 --> 01:23:11,054
- So I'll lay it out for you! Okay?
- Relax.

1491
01:23:11,055 --> 01:23:13,524
I'll lay it out for you nice and clear!

1492
01:23:13,525 --> 01:23:16,862
The newspaper can slant this any which way they want to,

1493
01:23:16,863 --> 01:23:20,065
and they can make you the one and only principal source.

1494
01:23:20,066 --> 01:23:21,993
How do you think that's gonna go down with your friends

1495
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:23,035
- at Point-Corp?
- Not great.

1496
01:23:23,036 --> 01:23:24,203
And anybody else you're connected to?

1497
01:23:24,204 --> 01:23:27,202
Don't do that. Please don't do that.

1498
01:23:32,513 --> 01:23:37,377
The more you talk, the more you give us,

1499
01:23:38,186 --> 01:23:39,987
the more protected you are.

1500
01:23:39,988 --> 01:23:42,383
That's the way we work.

1501
01:23:43,659 --> 01:23:47,228
And your compensation is your anonymity,..

1502
01:23:47,229 --> 01:23:50,798
..and that is all you're gonna get from us.

1503
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,340
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1504
01:23:59,443 --> 01:24:01,010
Great.

1505
01:24:01,011 --> 01:24:02,213
DELLA: Okay, how's it going in here?

1506
01:24:02,214 --> 01:24:04,582
Sounds frigging great.
We're just about ready.

1507
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:06,217
- Let's do it. DELLA: Great. Good.

1508
01:24:06,218 --> 01:24:07,284
Come on.

1509
01:24:07,285 --> 01:24:08,819
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm gonna open the door,

1510
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,120
and I'm gonna let you say it.

1511
01:24:10,121 --> 01:24:11,388
You have to talk to her.

1512
01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:12,857
Cal is asking us to push the deadline.

1513
01:24:12,858 --> 01:24:14,259
We really can't afford to keep doing

1514
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:15,594
this type of thing.
Where the hell are they?

1515
01:24:15,595 --> 01:24:17,495
You saying that as if I should know?

1516
01:24:17,496 --> 01:24:18,763
Yeah, well, you just spoke to him.

1517
01:24:18,764 --> 01:24:20,465
Yeah, well, they didn't tell me where they were.

1518
01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:21,700
$20,000 an hour.

1519
01:24:21,701 --> 01:24:23,201
Yeah... All right!

1520
01:24:23,202 --> 01:24:25,370
Bugger off!

1521
01:24:31,012 --> 01:24:32,701
Shit.

1522
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,888
It was just this guy, okay, that I knew from the clubs, alright?

1523
01:24:39,889 --> 01:24:42,223
And he worked for a PR firm, a very big one.

1524
01:24:42,224 --> 01:24:44,009
- Name?
- And... No, I'm not gonna give you...

1525
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:45,797
..his name, he's a friend, okay?

1526
01:24:45,823 --> 01:24:46,928
He had this, uh...

1527
01:24:46,929 --> 01:24:48,329
He had this...

1528
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:49,698
Well, the company that he worked for had a client,

1529
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:52,468
- a very special client.
- Name?

1530
01:24:52,469 --> 01:24:55,004
I'll give you that one. Point-Corp.

1531
01:24:55,005 --> 01:24:57,866
And they wanted a special employee.

1532
01:24:58,241 --> 01:25:00,706
<i>They needed a girl.</i>

1533
01:25:01,446 --> 01:25:04,410
I thought of Sonia.

1534
01:25:07,753 --> 01:25:09,886
You got that?

1535
01:25:11,623 --> 01:25:15,027
I'm sorry, are you saying that Sonia was working for Point-Corp?

1536
01:25:15,028 --> 01:25:16,995
Like a steel trap, this one.

1537
01:25:16,996 --> 01:25:18,897
Don't lose her to another paper.

1538
01:25:18,898 --> 01:25:20,198
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1539
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:22,067
Turn it up, turn it up.

1540
01:25:22,068 --> 01:25:23,870
<i>DOMINIC: She was a perfect fit.
She had balls.</i>

1541
01:25:23,871 --> 01:25:25,939
- She was smart.
- She was in debt.

1542
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,173
- And she was in debt, exactly.
- Yeah.

1543
01:25:27,174 --> 01:25:30,176
They paid her $26,000 a month.

1544
01:25:30,177 --> 01:25:31,577
Whole hell of a lot more than they gave me.

1545
01:25:31,578 --> 01:25:32,712
<i>- They paid me a flat 20.
- It's big.</i>

1546
01:25:32,713 --> 01:25:34,180
Did they tell you what the job was?

1547
01:25:34,181 --> 01:25:36,117
No, they did not.
She told me what it was, though.

1548
01:25:36,118 --> 01:25:37,285
She told me about Collins.

1549
01:25:37,286 --> 01:25:39,154
She told me about spying on him.

1550
01:25:39,155 --> 01:25:42,023
And did they want Sonia to sleep with Collins?

1551
01:25:42,024 --> 01:25:44,426
No. She got on her back all by herself

1552
01:25:44,427 --> 01:25:47,196
and screwed everything up, didn't she?

1553
01:25:47,197 --> 01:25:49,365
How did they get her onto Collins' staff?

1554
01:25:49,366 --> 01:25:50,499
That I'm not gonna tell you.

1555
01:25:50,525 --> 01:25:51,267
You can forget it.

1556
01:25:51,268 --> 01:25:54,603
You can kidnap and torture someone else for that toughie.

1557
01:25:54,604 --> 01:25:55,805
- We have a deal.
- Yeah.

1558
01:25:55,806 --> 01:25:57,873
- I've done my work.
- Nobody's here to screw you,

1559
01:25:57,874 --> 01:26:01,611
but we need to know who was working this on the Hill.

1560
01:26:01,612 --> 01:26:03,540
Mmm-hmm.

1561
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:04,627
From the Hill, huh?

1562
01:26:04,653 --> 01:26:07,117
Well, from the Hill, they found a guy to fix it.

1563
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:08,819
- Name?
- No.

1564
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,489
- Who?
- Leave it.

1565
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:11,757
- Who?
- Come on.

1566
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:12,992
<i>What, are you not hearing me?</i>

1567
01:26:12,993 --> 01:26:15,294
Forget it.
 I'd be afraid to start that

1568
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:18,463
sweet ass Caddy every morning.

1569
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:20,733
I mean, keep in mind if I was driving

1570
01:26:20,734 --> 01:26:22,335
that wheelbarrow Saab of yours,

1571
01:26:22,336 --> 01:26:25,561
I'd probably blow it up myself with me in it.

1572
01:26:25,873 --> 01:26:27,430
You seen that thing?

1573
01:26:27,456 --> 01:26:29,376
It's like a lawn mower.

1574
01:26:29,377 --> 01:26:32,375
I'm gonna get you another beer.

1575
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,343
Hey.

1576
01:26:34,383 --> 01:26:35,483
Oi.

1577
01:26:35,484 --> 01:26:38,675
Are you sleeping with that guy?

1578
01:26:39,654 --> 01:26:41,355
I mean, what are you doing here?

1579
01:26:41,356 --> 01:26:43,491
Are you sleeping with him?
Hmm?

1580
01:26:43,492 --> 01:26:44,884
Or you got a guy.

1581
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,710
You got a guy, right?

1582
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:48,664
<i>DOMINIC: Donna?</i>

1583
01:26:48,665 --> 01:26:50,923
<i>DELLA: Della.
DOMINIC: Della.</i>

1584
01:26:51,135 --> 01:26:54,971
I got a guy. Got a girl, too.

1585
01:26:54,972 --> 01:26:56,774
Right?
I don't wanna eave anybody out.

1586
01:26:56,775 --> 01:26:59,510
Hey, Stephen.
How did you find Sonia?

1587
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:00,811
STEPHEN: What?

1588
01:27:00,812 --> 01:27:02,079
How did she come to work in your office?

1589
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,747
Was somebody...
Did somebody recommend her?

1590
01:27:03,748 --> 01:27:05,282
What're you talking about?

1591
01:27:05,283 --> 01:27:06,784
<i>I think you've been played.</i>

1592
01:27:06,785 --> 01:27:07,851
Really?

1593
01:27:07,852 --> 01:27:09,654
<i>Who gave you her name?</i>

1594
01:27:09,655 --> 01:27:10,381
<i>- What is this about?</i>

1595
01:27:10,407 --> 01:27:11,523
<i>- Don't dick around about this,</i>

1596
01:27:11,524 --> 01:27:13,058
Stephen, all right?
Two questions.

1597
01:27:13,059 --> 01:27:14,626
How the hell did she come to work in your office,

1598
01:27:14,627 --> 01:27:18,160
<i>and the name of the individual who recommended her?</i>

1599
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:24,937
Fergus.
George Fergus.

1600
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:28,537
<i>Said she was the daughter of an old family friend.</i>

1601
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:32,647
Doug Sponder's bachelor party.

1602
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:35,216
<i>You remember that hotel, the Americana?</i>

1603
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:36,484
Yes.

1604
01:27:36,485 --> 01:27:39,293
Get here now, alone.

1605
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:41,704
I'm in Room 408.

1606
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:46,361
I'll meet you at the office.

1607
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:47,729
Stephen, we're late already.

1608
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:48,864
I'll call in.

1609
01:27:48,865 --> 01:27:50,632
Stephen, we are late already.

1610
01:27:50,633 --> 01:27:52,357
- I'll call in.
- Okay.

1611
01:28:01,746 --> 01:28:02,847
Don't check your voicemail.

1612
01:28:02,848 --> 01:28:06,317
Cameron's going on a rampage about this deadline.

1613
01:28:06,318 --> 01:28:07,752
So, did you cue it where I asked?

1614
01:28:07,753 --> 01:28:09,354
HANK: Close enough.
- Okay.

1615
01:28:09,355 --> 01:28:12,657
So, guys, I'm gonna need you to clear the room.

1616
01:28:12,658 --> 01:28:15,121
- That means you, too.
- What?

1617
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:19,298
<i>CAL: I got Stephen Collins coming in here.</i>

1618
01:28:19,299 --> 01:28:21,000
It's gonna be a lot more comfortable for him

1619
01:28:21,001 --> 01:28:23,259
if you're not here, alright?

1620
01:28:23,637 --> 01:28:25,429
Tell me you're kidding.

1621
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,777
<i>DELLA: Since when does the subject of an investigation</i>

1622
01:28:29,778 --> 01:28:32,347
<i>get his own private preview of another subject's interview?</i>

1623
01:28:32,348 --> 01:28:33,781
<i>That's crazy!</i>

1624
01:28:33,782 --> 01:28:36,017
You're polluting the story!

1625
01:28:36,018 --> 01:28:37,352
Special circumstance.

1626
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:39,645
What? What?

1627
01:28:39,722 --> 01:28:42,091
Is it that he's a congressman, or that he's your friend,

1628
01:28:42,092 --> 01:28:44,226
or that you have a crush on his wife?

1629
01:28:44,227 --> 01:28:46,690
Could you fill me in here?

1630
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:48,364
All of the above.

1631
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,533
<i>DELLA: Oh, my God, you're such a hypocrite!</i>

1632
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:53,503
<i>This is my story, too, and you are about to kill it forever</i>

1633
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,238
by letting him come in here.

1634
01:28:58,042 --> 01:29:00,143
I'm gonna bring him in.

1635
01:29:00,144 --> 01:29:02,345
I'm gonna sit him down, show him this.

1636
01:29:02,346 --> 01:29:04,047
I'm gonna get him on the record,

1637
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:06,877
then we've got both sides of the story.

1638
01:29:11,658 --> 01:29:13,484
Hey.

1639
01:29:13,626 --> 01:29:15,953
CAL: Stephen Collins, Della Frye.

1640
01:29:15,995 --> 01:29:18,323
Congressman.

1641
01:29:18,532 --> 01:29:20,533
You know this guy?

1642
01:29:20,534 --> 01:29:21,634
No.

1643
01:29:21,635 --> 01:29:24,633
You don't recognize him at all?

1644
01:29:24,672 --> 01:29:25,952
I don't know.
Maybe.

1645
01:29:25,978 --> 01:29:27,040
Is this in here?

1646
01:29:27,041 --> 01:29:28,860
No, no, it's next door.

1647
01:29:28,886 --> 01:29:30,678
He's sleeping it off.

1648
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:33,040
Sit down.

1649
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:35,542
Okay.

1650
01:29:37,786 --> 01:29:41,582
CAL: Point-Corp wanted to plant someone on your staff.

1651
01:29:42,059 --> 01:29:45,494
This guy, Dominic Foy, he finds Sonia.

1652
01:29:45,495 --> 01:29:46,800
He takes a fee.

1653
01:29:46,826 --> 01:29:49,323
George Fergus does the rest.

1654
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:50,533
No. That's not possible.

1655
01:29:50,534 --> 01:29:54,071
They paid off her debt, and they paid her monthly to report back

1656
01:29:54,072 --> 01:29:56,506
every single thing that you were doing.

1657
01:29:56,507 --> 01:30:00,802
And when she went dry, they killed her for it.

1658
01:30:01,879 --> 01:30:04,377
How do you know this?

1659
01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:09,520
<i>DOMINIC: And so I get a call, I gotta go down to a street corner.</i>

1660
01:30:09,521 --> 01:30:10,595
<i>I gotta buy a magazine.</i>

1661
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:11,856
<i>I gotta meet some new guy.</i>

1662
01:30:11,857 --> 01:30:13,157
<i>This guy, you know,</i>

1663
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,195
<i>he's some hardcore, thick-neck, corn-fed,</i>

1664
01:30:15,196 --> 01:30:17,230
<i>Navy-SEAL-looking guy, you know?</i>

1665
01:30:17,231 --> 01:30:19,966
<i>And he's all up in my face, scaring the hell out of me</i>

1666
01:30:19,967 --> 01:30:21,668
<i>because he's pissed off and...</i>

1667
01:30:21,669 --> 01:30:23,603
- When was this?
DOMINIC: This is like a month ago.

1668
01:30:23,604 --> 01:30:25,505
You know, he's pissed off because

1669
01:30:25,506 --> 01:30:27,375
Sonia's not giving him anything anymore.

1670
01:30:27,376 --> 01:30:28,643
And what did he want you to do about it?

1671
01:30:28,644 --> 01:30:29,616
He wants me to fix it.

1672
01:30:29,642 --> 01:30:31,912
He wants me to fix it, like one of my hair dryers.

1673
01:30:31,913 --> 01:30:33,080
And did you?

1674
01:30:33,081 --> 01:30:34,839
<i>I tried.</i>

1675
01:30:35,517 --> 01:30:37,518
<i>I tried. I called.
She wouldn't take my call.</i>

1676
01:30:37,519 --> 01:30:38,488
<i>I go over there.</i>

1677
01:30:38,514 --> 01:30:39,821
<i>I try to talk to her.</i>

1678
01:30:39,822 --> 01:30:41,390
<i>She's crying.</i>

1679
01:30:41,391 --> 01:30:42,364
<i>DELLA: Why is she crying?</i>

1680
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:43,725
<i>She's scared somebody's after her?</i>

1681
01:30:43,726 --> 01:30:46,557
<i>DOMINIC: No, she's crying because of Collins.</i>

1682
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:48,096
<i>She was in love with him,</i>

1683
01:30:48,097 --> 01:30:51,233
<i>and she was pregnant,</i>

1684
01:30:54,973 --> 01:30:57,504
<i>and she didn't tell him.</i>

1685
01:30:59,177 --> 01:31:01,346
<i>She didn't tell him, and, you know,</i>

1686
01:31:01,347 --> 01:31:04,249
<i>she was petrified that he's gonna find out what she did,</i>

1687
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,684
<i>and then he's not gonna want her,</i>

1688
01:31:05,685 --> 01:31:07,652
<i>and he's not gonna want the baby...</i>

1689
01:31:07,653 --> 01:31:10,422
<i>She got so wrecked about it that she burned</i>

1690
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:12,023
<i>thousands of dollars worth of paychecks.</i>

1691
01:31:12,024 --> 01:31:13,659
<i>Who does that?</i>

1692
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:16,128
<i>And I tried to get her to just relax</i>

1693
01:31:16,129 --> 01:31:18,531
<i>and to think about the publicity,</i>

1694
01:31:18,532 --> 01:31:23,269
<i>or think about an abortion, or think about, you know, her word.</i>

1695
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:24,269
<i>"Just keep your word.</i>

1696
01:31:24,295 --> 01:31:25,173
<i>And what about how</i>

1697
01:31:25,174 --> 01:31:27,041
<i>"your decisions are gonna affect me?"</i>

1698
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:31,379
<i>And then she's dead, you know? I hear it's a murder,</i>

1699
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:32,780
<i>and so I don't want anything more</i>

1700
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:35,073
<i>to do with this thing, you know?</i>

1701
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:38,354
<i>I'm just terrified, and I wanna go someplace warm,</i>

1702
01:31:38,355 --> 01:31:39,755
<i>and I wanna come back to a clean slate.</i>

1703
01:31:39,756 --> 01:31:43,125
<i>And you guys write your article and just get them off me.</i>

1704
01:31:43,126 --> 01:31:44,654
<i>I'm nothing.</i>

1705
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:48,118
<i>I'm nothing to those guys.</i>

1706
01:31:50,234 --> 01:31:51,801
So you were right, man. Okay?

1707
01:31:51,802 --> 01:31:53,303
And now we can prove it.

1708
01:31:53,304 --> 01:31:54,638
I get you on the record.

1709
01:31:54,664 --> 01:31:56,806
We can nail these mothers to the wall!

1710
01:31:56,807 --> 01:31:58,975
Sliberty? We can nail them to the wall, all right?
We win!

1711
01:31:58,976 --> 01:32:00,979
- Yeah. Just...
- All right?

1712
01:32:02,882 --> 01:32:06,318
Just... Will you just give me a minute?

1713
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:08,453
Okay.

1714
01:32:08,454 --> 01:32:11,055
He just needs a minute.

1715
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:15,361
Shit!

1716
01:32:15,362 --> 01:32:17,196
Get off... Get off of me!

1717
01:32:17,197 --> 01:32:19,489
You fucking...

1718
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:22,368
Help!

1719
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:24,332
Stephen!

1720
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:28,901
Get up! What're you doing?

1721
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:31,772
- Hey, stop!
- No!

1722
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:36,285
CAL: Come on, man!
Hey! Hey!

1723
01:32:36,286 --> 01:32:37,386
Get off!

1724
01:32:37,387 --> 01:32:39,520
What the hell are you doing to him?

1745
01:32:48,466 --> 01:32:50,292
CAL: Stephen!

1746
01:32:52,703 --> 01:32:54,068
Stephen!

1747
01:32:54,094 --> 01:32:57,140
Stephen! Stephen!

1748
01:32:57,141 --> 01:32:58,735
Hey, I'm trying to help you, man.

1749
01:32:58,761 --> 01:33:00,378
Yeah.
She was pregnant, Cal.

1750
01:33:00,379 --> 01:33:02,013
Did I need to hear that?

1751
01:33:02,014 --> 01:33:04,148
Yeah. Huh?
 You couldn't tell me yourself?

1752
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:05,397
You had to do it like that?

1753
01:33:05,423 --> 01:33:06,784
Was that important to you...

1754
01:33:06,785 --> 01:33:07,885
I thought you'd want to hear the truth.

1755
01:33:07,886 --> 01:33:09,289
That's right.

1756
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:11,124
You were just seeking the truth, that's all.

1757
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:12,492
You're just... You're a truth seeker.

1758
01:33:12,493 --> 01:33:13,827
That's all.
 You can't help it.

1759
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:14,817
It's who you are.

1760
01:33:14,843 --> 01:33:16,329
You're such a hypocrite.

1761
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:17,464
You're not interested in me.

1762
01:33:17,465 --> 01:33:21,836
Me coming here was all about you and getting your story.

1763
01:33:21,837 --> 01:33:23,806
I trusted you.

1764
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:26,362
You're my friend!

1765
01:33:27,042 --> 01:33:28,309
You were supposed to be my friend

1766
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:30,841
when you were screwing my wife!

1767
01:33:30,879 --> 01:33:32,447
You're my friend, Cal.

1768
01:33:32,448 --> 01:33:34,911
I never would've done this to you!

1769
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:39,187
I'm sorry, Stephen, okay?

1770
01:33:39,188 --> 01:33:40,856
I'm sorry about all of it.

1771
01:33:40,857 --> 01:33:43,792
Please, look, I've been an asshole,

1772
01:33:43,793 --> 01:33:46,196
and I can understand why you hate me for it.

1773
01:33:46,197 --> 01:33:50,701
You've just gotta put aside how you feel about me

1774
01:33:50,702 --> 01:33:52,385
and stay with this.

1775
01:33:52,411 --> 01:33:53,827
We're so close.

1776
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:02,809
Every single part of this, I have put myself on the line.

1777
01:34:04,483 --> 01:34:06,411
Stephen.

1778
01:34:11,057 --> 01:34:12,985
Stephen!

1779
01:35:08,655 --> 01:35:10,756
I need a minute with Congressman Fergus.

1780
01:35:10,757 --> 01:35:15,393
<i>Tell him it's Cal McAffrey from the Globe, and I'm on a deadline.</i>

1781
01:35:27,542 --> 01:35:28,978
Fuck him.

1782
01:35:28,979 --> 01:35:30,976
Asshole.

1783
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:36,040
It's all right.
 I saw that.

1784
01:35:36,066 --> 01:35:41,918
Just give him this card and tell him it's an issue that directly concerns him.

1785
01:35:47,098 --> 01:35:50,232
Sir?
He asked me to give you this.

1786
01:35:55,674 --> 01:35:57,705
Excuse me.

1787
01:36:02,414 --> 01:36:03,716
Congressman.

1788
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:05,850
That Cal McAffrey.

1789
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:11,724
What's up?
How'd you find me?

1790
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:14,260
I followed the trail of crumbs, Congressman.

1791
01:36:14,261 --> 01:36:15,763
I need a confirmation from you

1792
01:36:15,764 --> 01:36:18,432
for an article that we're running tomorrow.

1793
01:36:18,767 --> 01:36:20,668
I have been told that you recommended

1794
01:36:20,669 --> 01:36:22,503
to Greer Thornton to hire Sonia Baker,

1795
01:36:22,504 --> 01:36:23,637
is that correct?

1796
01:36:23,638 --> 01:36:25,327
So?

1797
01:36:27,209 --> 01:36:30,578
So if it turns out that Sonia Baker was, in fact, gathering information

1798
01:36:30,579 --> 01:36:32,247
..on Stephen Collins' committee findings..

1799
01:36:32,248 --> 01:36:33,813
..and passing that information back to the..

1800
01:36:33,839 --> 01:36:35,450
... very company that was being investigated

1801
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:39,054
and that company is complicit in her murder,

1802
01:36:40,191 --> 01:36:42,759
well, Jesus Christ, it's not gonna look too good for you,

1803
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:45,062
is it, Congressman?

1804
01:36:45,063 --> 01:36:48,926
One, never use the Lord's name in vain with me.

1805
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,336
Two, how could you even assume

1806
01:36:52,337 --> 01:36:55,139
that a bright, naive, 25-year-old girl

1807
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:58,001
was what, a double agent?

1808
01:36:58,177 --> 01:37:01,713
Mr. McAffrey, I went to bat for a young girl

1809
01:37:01,714 --> 01:37:03,882
whose family I met and respected,

1810
01:37:03,883 --> 01:37:06,452
a family that seemed like

1811
01:37:06,453 --> 01:37:10,522
the wholesome ideal upon which this country was founded.

1812
01:37:10,523 --> 01:37:13,819
And Sonia Baker's mother's first name is?

1813
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,619
Pardon me?

1814
01:37:17,645 --> 01:37:21,455
You heard me, family friend.

1815
01:37:27,043 --> 01:37:28,510
Do you really think that your new owners,

1816
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:30,178
these responsible corporate citizens,..

1817
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:35,612
..are going to allow you to publish this..

1818
01:37:35,852 --> 01:37:38,748
..speculative drivel?

1819
01:37:39,289 --> 01:37:41,057
You are gonna be out of a job before..

1820
01:37:41,058 --> 01:37:46,354
..the devil can even say your name, son.

1821
01:37:49,468 --> 01:37:51,499
Janine.

1822
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:57,308
Sonia's mother's first name is Janine.

1823
01:38:15,963 --> 01:38:17,230
<i>CAL: You're missing the point.</i>

1824
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:18,498
<i>You didn't see his face.</i>

1825
01:38:18,499 --> 01:38:19,287
<i>I saw his face.</i>

1826
01:38:19,313 --> 01:38:21,334
<i>Fergus is at the heart of this story.</i>

1827
01:38:21,335 --> 01:38:23,672
<i>CAMERON: This story is dead, Cal.</i>

1828
01:38:23,673 --> 01:38:27,009
One way or another, Point-Corp pushed

1829
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:28,710
Sonia Baker in front of that train.

1830
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:30,445
Oh, really?
The trouble is,

1831
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:33,415
our new corporate owners won't let me print any of this

1832
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,718
unless I have one of the major players on the record.

1833
01:38:35,719 --> 01:38:38,855
On the record, Cal!

1834
01:38:38,856 --> 01:38:40,824
And the only person who could do that won't.

1835
01:38:40,825 --> 01:38:42,392
Would you like to tell me why?

1836
01:38:42,393 --> 01:38:45,561
Or is it just that you shagged his wife?

1837
01:38:53,004 --> 01:38:55,160
Maybe you'd like to explain to me how,..

1838
01:38:55,186 --> 01:38:57,826
..when and why MediaCorp chopped off your balls.

1839
01:38:58,109 --> 01:39:00,780
This is as big and as connected as it gets.

1840
01:39:00,781 --> 01:39:03,616
You follow any fissure of this, it's a massive story.

1841
01:39:03,617 --> 01:39:05,952
You got Fergus, you got Point-Corp,..

1842
01:39:05,953 --> 01:39:08,287
..and now you got MediaCorp, all connected,..

1843
01:39:08,288 --> 01:39:11,719
..all in collusion, all playing for the same country club.

1844
01:39:11,826 --> 01:39:13,327
I didn't realize you'd taken up the game.

1845
01:39:13,328 --> 01:39:18,031
Oh.
Oh, Cal, if there's any corruption involved here, it's coming from you.

1846
01:39:18,032 --> 01:39:21,368
You have injected yourself in this story right from the beginning,

1847
01:39:21,369 --> 01:39:23,662
and we all know why.

1848
01:39:24,406 --> 01:39:26,841
It's over, Cal, as far as you're concerned.

1849
01:39:26,842 --> 01:39:29,635
I can't protect you anymore.

1850
01:39:29,879 --> 01:39:33,414
And right now, I'm not too sure I'd want to.

1851
01:40:00,246 --> 01:40:02,641
You want the story?

1852
01:40:04,851 --> 01:40:08,213
Yeah. Come on.

1853
01:40:22,872 --> 01:40:28,532
I was first introduced to Sonia Baker

1854
01:40:28,911 --> 01:40:33,571
in April of 2007.

1855
01:40:34,584 --> 01:40:38,387
She was hired as a research assistant on my staff.

1856
01:40:38,388 --> 01:40:43,652
She was recommended by the Majority Whip,

1857
01:40:43,929 --> 01:40:49,430
Congressman from West Virginia, George Fergus.

1858
01:40:50,569 --> 01:40:57,140
Three months into her time there, Sonia and I began

1859
01:40:58,611 --> 01:41:02,109
a romantic relationship.

1860
01:41:02,315 --> 01:41:08,021
<i>I have e-mailed copies of documents to you, which show beyond doubt</i>

1861
01:41:08,022 --> 01:41:10,757
<i>the corruption between members of my own party.</i>

1862
01:41:10,758 --> 01:41:16,096
I now know that she had been placed in my office as a spy.

1863
01:41:16,097 --> 01:41:18,333
<i>Point-Corp's tentacles reach into every corner</i>

1864
01:41:18,334 --> 01:41:20,302
<i>of the ever-growing private security industry,</i>

1865
01:41:20,303 --> 01:41:21,870
<i>both at home and abroad.</i>

1866
01:41:21,871 --> 01:41:23,472
<i>Not only does this pose a great...</i>

1867
01:41:23,473 --> 01:41:25,007
<i>But it is a violation of our laws.</i>

1868
01:41:25,008 --> 01:41:26,141
<i>A monopolistic business...</i>

1869
01:41:26,142 --> 01:41:28,477
obstruct and otherwise destroy

1870
01:41:28,478 --> 01:41:31,409
my investigation into Point-Corp.

1871
01:41:31,648 --> 01:41:34,984
Sonia was paid to make regular reports to Point-Corp...

1872
01:41:34,985 --> 01:41:37,754
Left unchecked, I believe that within five years,

1873
01:41:37,755 --> 01:41:40,356
Point-Corp will have its own standing army on US soil.

1874
01:41:40,357 --> 01:41:41,725
<i>into their fraudulent practices...</i>

1875
01:41:41,726 --> 01:41:44,161
<i>It will control our intelligence-gathering apparatus...</i>

1876
01:41:44,162 --> 01:41:45,084
What happened in committee?

1877
01:41:45,110 --> 01:41:46,347
She had access to everything...

1878
01:41:46,348 --> 01:41:48,732
<i>we were doing and effectively crippled our investigation.</i>

1879
01:41:48,733 --> 01:41:53,394
<i>It is a frightening vision and one which must be stopped.</i>

1880
01:41:54,474 --> 01:41:58,611
However, when my relationship with her grew,

1881
01:41:58,612 --> 01:42:01,714
she ceased her spying on their behalf,

1882
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:05,249
<i>and I believe they killed her for it.</i>

1883
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:09,189
STEPHEN: For people like this, who I've spent

1884
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:12,225
the last year and a half of my life investigating...

1885
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:17,065
<i>Innocent civilians are really little more than disposable lives,</i>

1886
01:42:17,066 --> 01:42:21,293
thought of as collateral damage.

1887
01:42:22,037 --> 01:42:25,968
<i>And I believe it was simply the public nature of my position that</i>

1888
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:30,177
saved me from a similar fate.

1889
01:42:32,616 --> 01:42:38,413
So, as political suicides go,

1890
01:42:38,989 --> 01:42:41,385
how was that?

1891
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:51,799
CAMERON: Thank you, Congressman.

1892
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:07,488
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1893
01:43:07,489 --> 01:43:09,679
He was set up.

1894
01:43:10,825 --> 01:43:15,519
She was sleeping with him for $26,000 a month. I mean...

1895
01:43:18,367 --> 01:43:19,634
Sliberty.

1896
01:43:19,635 --> 01:43:21,529
Cal.

1897
01:43:23,539 --> 01:43:25,009
- You all
set? - Mmm-Hmm.

1898
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:27,707
Okay. Let's go.

1899
01:43:49,569 --> 01:43:52,404
- You still here?
- Yeah.

1900
01:43:52,405 --> 01:43:56,508
I thought you would've been down at your desk blasting it online.

1901
01:43:56,509 --> 01:43:59,811
Well, you know, a piece this big, people should probably have newsprint...

1902
01:43:59,812 --> 01:44:03,540
..on their hands when they read it, don't you think?

1903
01:44:04,752 --> 01:44:07,887
I'll do Collins, Fergus, Point-Corp,

1904
01:44:07,888 --> 01:44:09,389
and corporate and government malfeasance.

1905
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:11,124
- Okay.
- You do Sonia Baker...

1906
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:14,796
The murder, Mandi, Rhonda Silver.

1907
01:44:14,797 --> 01:44:17,465
- And the Dominic Foy connection, alright?
- Yeah.

1908
01:44:17,466 --> 01:44:19,234
- Retire to the neutral corner.
- Okay.

1909
01:44:19,235 --> 01:44:21,698
- Gentle. - Got
it... - Thank you.

1910
01:44:30,614 --> 01:44:32,682
Sir, it's Robert Bingham.

1911
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:35,184
I'm sorry to call you directly.

1912
01:44:35,185 --> 01:44:39,151
I want to assure you that I'm ready to finish what we started.

1913
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:41,782
Goodbye.

1914
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:56,903
I won't be more than an hour.

1915
01:46:03,051 --> 01:46:05,878
- Hey, guys.
- Evening, sir. How you doing?

1916
01:46:17,433 --> 01:46:20,001
- Hello. CAL: Is it a night for it?

1917
01:46:20,002 --> 01:46:24,732
Oh... uh, yeah, yeah, I think it is.

1918
01:46:32,217 --> 01:46:33,579
So, how old are you?

1919
01:46:33,605 --> 01:46:35,553
Actually, don't... tell me.

1920
01:46:35,554 --> 01:46:37,188
It would just make me sick.

1921
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:39,357
You never ask a girl her age.

1922
01:46:39,358 --> 01:46:41,505
Well, see, I look at you, and I don't see a girl.

1923
01:46:41,531 --> 01:46:42,493
I just see a reporter.

1924
01:46:42,494 --> 01:46:45,197
- At last.
- Anyway, back to the story.

1925
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,862
- Yes.
- So I had this... uh,

1926
01:46:47,863 --> 01:46:49,568
- English teacher in high school.
- Mmm-hmm.

1927
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:53,073
He was a kind of a long-haired hippie kinda guy.

1928
01:46:53,074 --> 01:46:54,373
Mmm-hmm.

1929
01:46:54,374 --> 01:46:57,510
- He had a pen problem.
- Yeah. Oh.

1930
01:46:57,511 --> 01:46:59,429
He solved it by having a piece

1931
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:01,381
of leather string around his neck,

1932
01:47:01,382 --> 01:47:03,282
and that's where he'd keep his pen.

1933
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:04,650
Smart.

1934
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:06,552
- So I started thinking,
 - Mmm-hmm.

1935
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:09,290
"My friend Della's got a pen problem.

1936
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:11,493
"How do I solve it?"

1937
01:47:11,494 --> 01:47:13,495
- And I came up with this.
- What is it?

1938
01:47:13,496 --> 01:47:16,931
I call it the "Della Frye Nubian Princess,

1939
01:47:16,932 --> 01:47:20,336
"'I'm never without a pen"' celebratory necklace.

1940
01:47:20,337 --> 01:47:22,095
Oh, it's beautiful!

1941
01:47:22,121 --> 01:47:24,896
I always wanted one of these.

1942
01:47:28,912 --> 01:47:31,444
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1943
01:47:34,452 --> 01:47:39,054
You know, I wanted to tell you something about Anne Collins.

1944
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:41,287
Okay.

1945
01:47:58,045 --> 01:48:00,770
I was just talking to her.

1946
01:48:04,185 --> 01:48:05,285
How does Anne Collins know that

1947
01:48:05,286 --> 01:48:08,046
Sonia Baker was earning $26,000 a month?

1948
01:48:10,492 --> 01:48:12,284
What?

1949
01:48:14,129 --> 01:48:16,130
How does she know how much Sonia Baker was earning?

1950
01:48:16,131 --> 01:48:17,600
- We know that.
- Yeah.

1951
01:48:17,601 --> 01:48:19,335
How does Anne Collins know that?

1952
01:48:19,336 --> 01:48:25,201
Well, I mean, Stephen must have heard it in the Foy interview.

1953
01:48:25,442 --> 01:48:31,012
We played him a specific part of that tape, and that figure is never mentioned.

1954
01:48:48,534 --> 01:48:52,296
Cal. Wait, what're you doing?

1955
01:49:02,884 --> 01:49:06,486
DELLA: What're you doing? Cal?

1956
01:49:11,894 --> 01:49:13,461
Uh... you gonna fill me in?

1957
01:49:13,462 --> 01:49:16,063
Just tell Cameron, "Hold the story".

1958
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,678
What?

1959
01:49:18,704 --> 01:49:22,059
Cal? Cal!

1960
01:49:24,941 --> 01:49:26,801
Shit.

1961
01:49:51,538 --> 01:49:54,433
Who's Robert Bingham, Stephen?

1962
01:50:05,654 --> 01:50:08,345
Who is Robert Bingham?

1963
01:50:26,277 --> 01:50:28,842
Are the police outside?

1964
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:31,779
No.

1965
01:50:33,384 --> 01:50:37,283
I saved Robert Bingham's life in Kuwait in '91.

1966
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:39,958
He was a 17-year-old kid.

1967
01:50:39,959 --> 01:50:42,260
He was a good soldier.

1968
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:45,088
He was proud of what we did.

1969
01:50:45,264 --> 01:50:50,403
The Army was his life, and he had problems when he got discharged.

1970
01:50:50,404 --> 01:50:54,039
So you had a guy that you knew to be unstable

1971
01:50:54,642 --> 01:50:57,777
do what, exactly? Scare her?

1972
01:50:57,778 --> 01:50:59,145
Maybe beat her up a little?

1973
01:50:59,146 --> 01:51:02,216
No, Cal. I had him follow her.

1974
01:51:02,217 --> 01:51:03,283
Why?

1975
01:51:03,284 --> 01:51:07,078
Because I knew she was hiding something from me.

1976
01:51:07,555 --> 01:51:08,922
Because when I'd... I'd be at her house..

1977
01:51:08,923 --> 01:51:10,791
..and a fax would come in, she'd get nervous.

1978
01:51:10,792 --> 01:51:13,462
Because there were phone calls late at night.

1979
01:51:13,463 --> 01:51:15,264
I was suspicious.

1980
01:51:15,265 --> 01:51:19,068
I asked Bingham to observe her and report back to me.

1981
01:51:19,069 --> 01:51:21,862
That's all.

1982
01:51:22,539 --> 01:51:23,740
You're a liar, Stephen.

1983
01:51:23,741 --> 01:51:26,576
He was more upset about what she was doing than I was.

1984
01:51:26,577 --> 01:51:28,912
You have to understand what the military means to Bingham.

1985
01:51:28,913 --> 01:51:31,448
He hates Point-Corp for what they're trying to do to it.

1986
01:51:31,449 --> 01:51:32,983
In his mind, she just had to stop.

1987
01:51:32,984 --> 01:51:34,484
But she did stop, right?

1988
01:51:34,485 --> 01:51:36,954
She tore up her paychecks, and she put her life at risk for you.

1989
01:51:36,955 --> 01:51:39,390
Yes, but I didn't know that.

1990
01:51:39,391 --> 01:51:42,694
I didn't know that he was gonna kill her.

1991
01:51:42,695 --> 01:51:44,462
I didn't know he had killed her.

1992
01:51:44,463 --> 01:51:46,464
When I found out, my thought was just the same as yours.

1993
01:51:46,465 --> 01:51:48,401
I thought Point-Corp had done it.

1994
01:51:48,402 --> 01:51:49,469
And when you did find out?

1995
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:50,537
What was I supposed to do?

1996
01:51:50,538 --> 01:51:52,272
- Tell someone.
- I tried.

1997
01:51:52,273 --> 01:51:53,473
- When?
- When I came to your house,

1998
01:51:53,474 --> 01:51:54,841
and I wanted to talk to you about it,

1999
01:51:54,842 --> 01:51:55,942
and all you cared about was the story.

2000
01:51:55,943 --> 01:51:58,612
No, Stephen, I cared about helping you.

2001
01:51:58,613 --> 01:52:00,581
Bullshit. Bullshit.

2002
01:52:00,582 --> 01:52:03,284
All you cared about was clearing your conscience over this little soap opera

2003
01:52:03,285 --> 01:52:05,119
- you have with Annie.
- So you used me.

2004
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:06,554
- No, Cal.
- The same way as you used Bingham.

2005
01:52:06,555 --> 01:52:07,698
I was suspicious of her.

2006
01:52:07,724 --> 01:52:08,556
I brought him in.

2007
01:52:08,557 --> 01:52:10,559
That's all it was! It was a mistake!

2008
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:11,827
It's my responsibility.

2009
01:52:11,828 --> 01:52:13,061
I should never have done that.

2010
01:52:13,062 --> 01:52:15,330
But I never asked him to kill her.

2011
01:52:15,331 --> 01:52:18,158
He owed you his life!

2012
01:52:19,435 --> 01:52:22,128
That's why you called him.

2013
01:52:22,173 --> 01:52:25,171
You called him, and you used him,

2014
01:52:25,310 --> 01:52:28,378
like you've been trying to use me.

2015
01:52:28,379 --> 01:52:31,849
One to kill, and one to cover it up.

2016
01:52:31,850 --> 01:52:34,504
If Point-Corp and Fergus hadn't hired her, none of this would've happened!

2017
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:35,653
No. This is not about Bingham

2018
01:52:35,654 --> 01:52:37,555
and Point-Corp and Fergus, man!

2019
01:52:37,556 --> 01:52:41,159
It's about you and the decisions that you have made

2020
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:44,226
that have led to four people being killed.

2021
01:52:44,898 --> 01:52:48,533
One of them was delivering a pizza, Stephen.

2022
01:52:49,736 --> 01:52:54,065
Cal... What're you gonna do?

2023
01:52:54,608 --> 01:52:57,403
You know what I'm gonna do.

2024
01:52:59,314 --> 01:53:04,917
You know... it's laughable, your sense of your own self-worth.

2025
01:53:05,654 --> 01:53:06,147
Why is that?

2026
01:53:06,173 --> 01:53:07,955
'Cause... nobody reads the papers anymore?

2027
01:53:07,956 --> 01:53:09,158
Is that it?

2028
01:53:09,859 --> 01:53:12,461
It's just another story, a couple days of shit-storm,

2029
01:53:12,462 --> 01:53:14,296
and it's wrapping paper?

2030
01:53:14,297 --> 01:53:16,365
You know, in the middle of all this gossip and speculation

2031
01:53:16,366 --> 01:53:17,599
that permeates people's lives,

2032
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:19,201
I still think they know the difference

2033
01:53:19,202 --> 01:53:21,504
between real news and bullshit.

2034
01:53:21,505 --> 01:53:24,274
And they're glad that someone cares enough

2035
01:53:24,275 --> 01:53:26,776
to get things on the record and print the truth.

2036
01:53:26,777 --> 01:53:30,079
Cal.
Please, Cal, don't do this. Please.

2037
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:33,012
I'm asking you as your friend.

2038
01:53:34,954 --> 01:53:37,321
You got about three minutes before the cops get here.

2039
01:53:40,626 --> 01:53:44,023
I thought you said you didn't call 'em.

2040
01:53:44,598 --> 01:53:46,492
I lied.

2041
01:54:34,553 --> 01:54:38,456
A good soldier fights for his country and his friends.

2042
01:54:40,359 --> 01:54:44,462
But these guys, they wanna make it all about the money.

2043
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:48,134
You wanna live in a world like that?

DONALD: Drop the weapon!

2045
01:54:50,337 --> 01:54:53,107
The story about Stephen comes out, whether I write it or not.

2046
01:54:53,108 --> 01:54:54,608
COP 1: Drop your weapon!

2047
01:54:54,609 --> 01:54:56,377
COP 2: Drop it!

2048
01:54:56,378 --> 01:54:58,045
I'd rather be nothing.

2049
01:54:58,046 --> 01:55:01,044
COP 1: I repeat, drop your weapon!

CAMERON: Well, aren't you gonna send it?

2051
01:57:07,223 --> 01:57:11,882
I've only been holding the front page for 4 hours, after all.

2052
01:57:11,895 --> 01:57:13,995
You send it.

2053
01:57:18,269 --> 01:57:20,930
Good night, everybody. See you tomorrow.

2054
01:57:26,111 --> 01:57:27,211
Good night.

2055
01:57:27,212 --> 01:57:28,970
Good night.
