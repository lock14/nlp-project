1
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:37,287
There was a time when the fearsome,
beautiful land of Alagaësia...

2
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:42,250
...was ruled by men astride mighty dragons.

3
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,296
To protect and serve was their mission.

4
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:50,091
And for thousands of years,
the people prospered.

5
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,510
But the riders grew arrogant...

6
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,306
...and began to fight among themselves
for power.

7
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,436
Sensing their weakness...

8
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:07,484
...a young rider named Galbatorix
betrayed them...

9
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,157
...and in a single bloody battle,
believed he had killed them all...

10
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,290
...riders and dragons alike.

11
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:27,545
Since then, our land
has been ruled by Galbatorix.

12
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,048
He crushed all rebellion...

13
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:34,302
...including the freedom fighters
known as the Varden.

14
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:40,058
Those that survived fled to the mountains.

15
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,894
There they hoped for a miracle...

16
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:46,856
...that might even their odds
against the king.

17
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:56,616
Our story begins one night...

18
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,621
...as Arya, an ally of the Varden,
rides for her life...

19
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:07,210
...carrying a stone
stolen from the king himself.

20
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:14,843
l suffer without my stone.

21
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:18,430
Do not prolong my suffering.

22
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,050
Miles away,
a young boy ventures out hunting.

23
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,262
His life and Alagaësia...

24
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,557
...will never be the same again.

25
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,159
-Give it to me...
-Durza.

26
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,994
...and l'll let you live.

27
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:49,080
ls there anyone
who trusts the word of a Shade?

28
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:20,570
Where did you send it?

29
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,865
Poor Durza.

30
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:28,203
How will you tell the king you failed?

31
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:31,766
Come with me.

32
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:35,478
Two more patriotic volunteers
for the king's army.

33
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:39,774
My sons are not fighters.
The men you take, they never return.

34
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:43,611
Every village must do its share.

35
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:47,156
Rejoice. your sons will be heroes.

36
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,336
Expensive taste, Eragon.

37
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,510
The king's strip. The best cut there is.
The fat just melts into the meat.

38
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:12,932
How much?

39
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,977
Too much for a poor farm boy.

40
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,982
l have something. Something to trade.

41
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,989
What is this? Some kind of stone?

42
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,868
-l found it.
-Stole it, more likely.

43
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,953
l was hunting.

44
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,541
Hunting in the Spine.

45
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,259
Put it back. lt belongs to the king.
Tell no one you have it.

46
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,928
you'll endanger the whole village.
Now get out.

47
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,849
l don't need that sort of trouble here.
Get out.

48
00:07:57,186 --> 00:08:00,480
Look at this. A necklace.

49
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:05,652
Now, where'd a fool like you
find such an appetizing string of jewels?

50
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:11,074
-lnteresting you should ask.
-ls that right?

51
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,619
l was walking up the lane the other day,
admiring them sitting on a branch.

52
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,788
Clap of thunder,
they f ell dead at me feet.

53
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,416
So l thought,
"Well, l can't leave them there.

54
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,043
Someone might trip."

55
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,422
-So l hung them up there, out of the way.
-Do you know what l think?

56
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,633
-What's that?
-l think you're a thief.

57
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,885
-A poacher.
-Oh, no.

58
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,596
l confiscate them all
in the name of the king.

59
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,724
Don't try anything.

60
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,274
Well, l'll just cut them down
for you then, shall l?

61
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,653
-Grab those.
-Sorry l didn't pluck them.

62
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,281
Take care of  the little bones.

63
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,909
Hate to see you choke.

64
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,421
All hail Eragon.
The mighty hunter returns.

65
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,635
yeah. With his invisible catch.

66
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,597
What happened, did you get scared
when the deer growled?

67
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,440
No respect f or the hunter?

68
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,610
Don't you ever learn?

69
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,660
Shall we have another lesson today?

70
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,333
you f ight like an old goat, Roran.

71
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,844
Mind my breakf ast.

72
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,306
-you're too slow, Roran.
-Wake up, dreamer.

73
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:01,350
That sounded like your head.

74
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,066
Hey. Come on, boys. That's enough.
Come on, Roran.

75
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,188
Eragon?

76
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,191
l'm leaving.

77
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,861
l'm old enough to be recruited now.

78
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,781
Before the soldiers come looking for me.

79
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,243
l won't serve in the army.

80
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,080
l'll send word when l've settled.

81
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,166
-But what--?
-He knows.

82
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,210
l already told him.

83
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,799
Where will you go?

84
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,928
l don't know yet.

85
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,765
All l know is l'm going.

86
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,685
Roran? Eragon?

87
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,562
Come on.

88
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,698
Roran told you then?

89
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,243
your day will come too, Eragon.

90
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,746
And you will decide for yourself
the kind of lif e you wish to lead.

91
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,958
Uncle, l like my life right here.

92
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,423
What many men seek
is often right under their nose.

93
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,469
But for some,
the unknown is too hard to resist.

94
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,639
ls that why my mother left?

95
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,189
My sister was in a great hurry
when she left you here.

96
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:17,028
Whatever her reasons, we can only trust
they were for your own good.

97
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:22,366
Besides, had she not,
l wouldn't have gained another son.

98
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,505
Take these.

99
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:40,509
l've been saving them for you.

100
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,471
your blessing is all l need.

101
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,316
Take care of  yourself, Roran.

102
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,113
Goodbye, Father.

103
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:22,176
Be strong, brother.

104
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,974
And work on that aim.

105
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,894
you may make a hunter yet.

106
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,493
Not a stone.

107
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,912
An egg.

108
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,422
Well, look at you.

109
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,385
What are you?

110
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,809
Well, you're not a bird.

111
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:36,143
Where is it?

112
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,400
Too late.

113
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:55,913
lt's hatched.

114
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,718
Look at what you did.

115
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:14,515
Eragon, wake up.
Get on with your chores.

116
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,437
Hungry?

117
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,910
Go on.

118
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,413
Drink while it's still warm.

119
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,592
l'm sorry. That's all there is.

120
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,616
So much f or our rat problem.

121
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,920
My king, Galbatorix.

122
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:29,423
As you feared, the dragon has hatched.

123
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,384
But to a mere farm boy.

124
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,803
To whom is not the issue.

125
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,307
When the Varden learn
that the legend is real...

126
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,227
...they will be encouraged
to challenge me.

127
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,148
And l am not interested
in being challenged.

128
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:50,694
There is no one left for you to f ear,
my king.

129
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:57,993
Beyond these borders
are remnants of the resistance.

130
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,914
Dwarves. Elves. The Varden.

131
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:08,003
l can't let them have hope.

132
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:18,138
Do not let them reach the Varden.

133
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,474
l will find the boy...

134
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,520
...and kill him before he becomes a man.

135
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,536
Where's your mother?

136
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,498
Did she abandon you too?

137
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,670
Did she leave in a great hurry?

138
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:23,162
Ra'zac.

139
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,668
kill the rider.

140
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,633
Nothing f rom my boys.

141
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,096
Not a word.

142
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,973
Their mother's heart is broken.

143
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,559
And for what?

144
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:49,063
More death? More suffering?

145
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,524
Easy, Horst. The soldiers will hear you.

146
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,984
What's that matter?

147
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,529
Speak or not speak.
lt makes no difference.

148
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,241
Quiet, Brom.
A fool like you has nothing to lose.

149
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,620
No argument there.

150
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,790
Don't mind me.

151
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,420
But it wasn't always like this, was it?

152
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:20,469
There was a time when our land flourished
without cruelty and f ear.

153
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:27,101
A time of dragons and Dragon Riders.

154
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:32,523
Those days are long gone.
Old Brom is going on with his stories.

155
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,944
Don't pretend you've forgotten.
Men astride magnif icent beasts.

156
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,489
No one could def eat them.

157
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,118
Until, that is, one of their own...

158
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,287
...a rider named Galbatorix...

159
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,667
...decided to take all the power for himself
and cut down any rider who opposed him.

160
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,336
Enough, bef ore you hang by a tree.

161
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,171
No!

162
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,216
Let him finish.

163
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:06,265
-And one day, he will pay for his crime.
-Are you deaf? Be on your way!

164
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,393
The time of Dragon Riders...

165
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,396
...will come again.

166
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,702
And then Brom said:

167
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,955
"The time of the Dragon Riders
will come again."

168
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:38,380
Well, first, l think you need to fly.

169
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,383
yes, you did it!

170
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,205
She's gone.

171
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,297
-What's happening?
-Brom was right, Eragon.

172
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,509
The time of the Dragon Riders
has come again.

173
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,803
you can hear my thoughts?

174
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:12,099
l have waited 1 000 years
to hear your thoughts.

175
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,560
And now you can hear mine.

176
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:19,314
l am Saphira. And you are my rider.

177
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,316
Rider?

178
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,594
Get out.

179
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,766
ls it true?

180
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,186
What you spoke of?

181
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:42,481
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

182
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,441
l want to know more.

183
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,027
Please?

184
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,695
Tell me about the dragons.

185
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,242
Did anybody follow you here?

186
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,871
How big will they grow?
When do they breathe fire?

187
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,916
keep your voice down.

188
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,921
you mocked the king
in front of his soldiers.

189
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:13,512
l always say,
"Better ask forgiveness than permission."

190
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,347
Then tell me.

191
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,642
-Tell me about the dragons.
-Go home.

192
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,105
Mind your corn. Till your fields. All right?

193
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,899
you'll just get yourself into trouble.

194
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,860
What does it make you, then?

195
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,780
A liar or a coward?

196
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,117
l know.

197
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,285
l know your story is true.

198
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,337
l told you.

199
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,673
His name is Eragon.

200
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,682
The boy. The boy took it with him.

201
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,853
He lives on a farm,
the furthest one in the valley.

202
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,564
Please, don't kill me.

203
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:13,215
Eragon. lt's you they want.

204
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,636
-Take me down.
-You're in danger.

205
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,430
What are you doing?
l have to warn my uncle.

206
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,225
lt's too late. There's nothing you can do.

207
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,686
Hold on.

208
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,109
You're ridiculous. Hold on.

209
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,408
-l'm begging. Please put me down now.
-l can't. They'll kill you.

210
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,038
-Take me down now.
-You stupid boy.

211
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,926
l'm slipping.

212
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,056
Take me down now.

213
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,226
You're giving me no choice.

214
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,826
Uncle? Uncle.

215
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,849
Eragon?

216
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,856
l should have been here.

217
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,150
To warn him.

218
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,945
-This is your fault.
-You would have met the same fate.

219
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,990
No. l could have saved him.

220
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,743
Go away.

221
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:07,621
And stay away.

222
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,175
Uncle, l'm sorry.

223
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,199
-you?
-Let go of me.

224
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,160
-Where's your dragon?
-Gone.

225
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,621
-What do you mean, "gone"?
-l sent her away.

226
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,498
you can't stay here and mourn him--

227
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,042
l'm not going anywhere.
Not until l bury him.

228
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,759
-There.
-What are you doing?

229
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,429
A funeral fit f or a king. Come.

230
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,227
-Let go.
-Listen...

231
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:16,022
...they killed him, but they were after you.
lf we stay here, we're both dead.

232
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,525
Now get on that horse. Go on.

233
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,610
Get up there.

234
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,447
-Who are you?
-Ride. Now. Go on.

235
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,430
Come on, boy. Ride.

236
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,019
-Why here?
-Because l said here.

237
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:42,817
-Call your dragon.
-My uncle was killed because of her.

238
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,111
She was protecting you
against the Ra'zac.

239
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,156
-l could have killed them.
-That's the spirit.

240
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,575
One part brave, three parts fool.

241
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:52,786
What, you don't think l could do it?

242
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:56,790
The Ra'zac kill mercilessly.
That's what they do.

243
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:00,376
-But a boy of  1 5, 1 6--
-Seventeen.

244
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,296
Seventeen. Forgive me.

245
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,508
Well, l think even a 1 7-year-old boy...

246
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,845
...might probably last a minute
against Durza's assassins.

247
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,264
Then l'll find Durza and kill him.

248
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,351
Durza's a Shade.

249
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:22,857
A sorcerer possessed with demonic spirits.

250
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:27,612
Find Durza,
you'll be no better off than your uncle.

251
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,992
you just pray to heaven he doesn't find you
because the king won't rest until he does.

252
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,787
you are the Varden's only hope.

253
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,706
-Who are the Varden?
-Rebels. Outcasts.

254
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:43,837
Men who are brave or mad enough
to oppose Galbatorix.

255
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,881
They built a stronghold
in the Beor Mountains.

256
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,425
How do you know all this?

257
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:54,681
Because l've been about a bit.

258
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,520
l've seen things...

259
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,064
...you could never imagine.

260
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,776
Now call your dragon.

261
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,573
She's f ar away by now. She can't hear me.

262
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,535
Shall we have an agreement
not to lie to each other?

263
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,123
l know she hears your thoughts.
Now call your dragon.

264
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,756
Saphira? Can you find us?

265
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,012
l never left you.

266
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:58,119
-l'm sorry for what l said.
-l understand.

267
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,246
You loved him very much.

268
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,629
-And who might this be?
-This is Brom.

269
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,839
He knows about dragons.

270
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:14,510
He knows about dragons?
l'll be the judge of that.

271
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,557
Easy. l think he's a friend.

272
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,727
Muscular.

273
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,147
Graceful proportions.

274
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,067
Talons...

275
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,361
...nicely curved.

276
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,490
Legs a bit thin.

277
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:39,160
Only my voice is gentle, old man.

278
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:42,080
Spikes sharp.

279
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,290
All in all...

280
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,417
...a fine young dragon.

281
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:50,463
Well, he does know a bit about dragons.

282
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:55,468
And soon, strong enough to ride.

283
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:58,096
Not me. l won't do it again.

284
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,016
My story was about you, Eragon.

285
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:05,353
lt is your fate to be a Dragon Rider.

286
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:10,608
The Varden need a rider
if they are to defeat Durza and the king.

287
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:15,280
-l didn't ask for any of  this.
-But you were chosen nevertheless.

288
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,575
A dragon will only hatch
if it feels the presence of its rider.

289
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,661
lt'll wait forever, if it has to.

290
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,498
What he says is true.

291
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,625
But now it's found you.

292
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:30,962
lt will serve you and only you,
and that's put your life in danger.

293
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,842
-Because it chose me?
-No.

294
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:40,513
Because the easiest way for the king
to destroy your dragon is to kill you.

295
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:46,644
A rider will live on if  his dragon is killed.

296
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,813
But if a rider dies....

297
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,735
So does his dragon.

298
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,189
Handsome blade.

299
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,108
Simple...

300
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,361
...and to the point.

301
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,240
The farm boy evaded the Ra'zac.

302
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:49,999
Bring me his head.

303
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,132
Durza will send his Urgals after us.

304
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,969
Ahead, five hard days ride,
is the river town of  Daret...

305
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,138
...the last outpost before the foothills.

306
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:07,392
Now, if we can get there without
being discovered, we have a chance.

307
00:37:08,102 --> 00:37:11,646
Tell Saphira to fly above us
and scout the countryside f or Urgals...

308
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:16,025
...or worse, Ra'zacs.
lf they find us, we'll have no chance.

309
00:37:16,193 --> 00:37:19,862
And tell her only to come to us at night.

310
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,072
Do as he says.

311
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,907
But be careful.

312
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:25,368
You be careful.

313
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,985
This way.

314
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:18,045
Urgals. They used to be the king's enemies.
Now they're his guard.

315
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,800
Oh, they're closer to us than l thought.
We better stay off the roads.

316
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:26,387
-Why can't we take them?
-Quiet.

317
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,891
you're not ready to take anything yet.

318
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,769
l have skills. l can fight.

319
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:37,273
My cousin, Roran and l.

320
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:39,400
We've trained.

321
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,779
-With swords.
-Well, then...

322
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:46,115
...perhaps l've underestimated you.

323
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:53,539
Right, then.
Let's see these skills of yours.

324
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:56,250
you know, this won't be fair to you,
old man.

325
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,877
Humor me.

326
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:04,175
Oh, dear.
Well, l see the effect of your training.

327
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,389
Good. Good.

328
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,603
Don't get overconfident.

329
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:26,656
lt won't be your cousin Roran
you're fighting.

330
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,116
And it won't be wooden staves, either.

331
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:40,711
l could've beaten him.
l just didn't want to hurt the old man.

332
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,089
Of course you could have.

333
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,882
Don't dragons breathe fire?

334
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,803
She's not old enough to sustain a flame.

335
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,305
Lucky for you.

336
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,776
How did you do that?

337
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,238
What did you just do?

338
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,658
l started a fire.

339
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,498
He doesn't trust me.

340
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,668
Maybe we need to trust him first.

341
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,879
Now get to sleep. With any luck,
tomorrow, by the end of the day...

342
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,090
...we will have
slipped through Daret unseen.

343
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:32,847
Then it's the foothills of the Beor Mountains
and a straight shot to the Varden.

344
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,475
Eragon, wake up. Come on, wake up.

345
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,018
We're at the village of  Daret.

346
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:23,272
We'll leave the horses here.
keep Saphira close.

347
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,260
Buy us some bread down there.

348
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,263
Come back, meet me here.
l won't be long.

349
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,183
Don't talk to anybody.

350
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,999
Do you wish Angela to read your fortune?

351
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:10,129
-But l have no money.
-Did Angela ask for money?

352
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:15,801
knucklebones of a dragon.

353
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,304
They will tell me everything about you.

354
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:33,652
This is difficult.

355
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,573
A young life so tangled.

356
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:40,910
But you have been long awaited
by many races.

357
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,162
Great battles rage around you.

358
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,082
lt can't be. l don't understand.

359
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:52,338
you have powers you do not acknowledge,
but there is a doom upon you.

360
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:55,549
Part of it lies in a death
that rapidly approaches.

361
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,719
No. lt's already happened.

362
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:04,350
And a girl.
She calls to you in your dreams.

363
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,728
She's part of your past...

364
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,105
...and your future.

365
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,275
Who is she? Tell me her name.

366
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,997
Do l have to do everything myself?

367
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,834
-The f ortuneteller--
-Did she tell you about him, huh?

368
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,418
Come on.

369
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,088
Where's everybody gone?

370
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,221
-She told me my future.
-The f uture is for the living, Eragon.

371
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,308
Come on!

372
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,542
Saphira!

373
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:45,034
Eragon.

374
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,180
My hand. lt burns.

375
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,807
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

376
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,936
My head.

377
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:15,105
Feels like l've been kicked by a horse.

378
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,857
What happened?

379
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:21,195
Most new Dragon Riders take years to learn
what you discovered by instinct.

380
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:24,698
-What was that?
-Magic.

381
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,204
l was only reacting.

382
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:34,708
Magic comes from dragons.

383
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,379
lt flows through the riders
who command them.

384
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,134
-Saphira.
-She's fine.

385
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:48,180
But she felt your f ear as her own.

386
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,725
your bond with her is strong.

387
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:54,228
-Those were Urgals, weren't they?
-yes.

388
00:46:54,396 --> 00:46:57,231
-Did l kill them?
-yes.

389
00:46:57,816 --> 00:47:00,192
But death is nothing to celebrate.

390
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,364
Magic must be your last resort.

391
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,701
lt has rules. lt has limitations.

392
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:13,414
Before you cast a spell, you must learn
the ancient language of the elves.

393
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,712
Brisingr means "fire." ls fire.

394
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:23,382
The thing is the word.
know the word and you control the thing.

395
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,926
Before you can cast a spell...

396
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:30,347
...you must have the physical strength
to withstand its effect.

397
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:34,059
Some spells may leave you weakened.

398
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:37,271
Other spells,
as you found out on the bridge...

399
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,815
...can leave you unconscious.

400
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:43,235
And yet other spells,
if you use them before you're ready...

401
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,404
...will kill you.

402
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,449
l can teach you the words...

403
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,619
...but the limits of your strength
you must learn for yourself.

404
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:00,210
-What's the word for tree?
-Tree is traevam.

405
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,466
And the branch?

406
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,764
And when a dragon and rider are truly one,
then they see as one.

407
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:16,560
And tha's "skulblakas ven."

408
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:25,235
Well, since we've announced ourselves
so spectacularly to the world...

409
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:28,322
...we're gonna have to find
another way through these hills.

410
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:33,911
Of course, that would be a lot easier
if you were flying.

411
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,502
Did someone mention flying?

412
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,839
Are you ready to try again, Dragon Rider?

413
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,925
l didn't do so well last time.

414
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,095
We didn't do so well.

415
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:58,018
You can thank Brom for the saddle.

416
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,859
No, that's not so bad up here.

417
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,204
Not so bad at all.

418
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:26,630
yeah!

419
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,258
Lean.

420
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:33,303
Not that much!

421
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,692
Feel how she moves, Eragon.

422
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,319
How she turns. And when she accelerates.

423
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,238
Come on, let's see what you got.

424
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:53,991
You want speed? Here we go.

425
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:59,246
Hold on, Eragon.

426
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,504
You asked for it.

427
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:09,506
There you go.

428
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,224
When we're truly one...

429
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:23,437
...you can fight from everywhere,
even from the tail.

430
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,606
l wanna try it.

431
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,192
Maybe not yet.

432
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,155
Oh, it's easy. l can do this.

433
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:43,332
Maybe not yet.

434
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,008
Maybe l can try this.

435
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,264
Fantastic.

436
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,520
you always see like this?

437
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,232
That's nothing. Watch this.

438
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,180
What's wrong?

439
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,183
Ra'zacs.

440
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,352
Brom.

441
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:48,730
This time they die. Now, go.

442
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:50,399
With pleasure.

443
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,655
Come on. Come on.
Eragon, stay out of this.

444
00:51:56,823 --> 00:51:58,824
Lower, Saphira, lower.

445
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:24,975
Eragon. Above you.

446
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,563
Come on.

447
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,684
Protect your dragon.

448
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:13,940
your irresponsibility
nearly cost Saphira her life.

449
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,109
Don't worry about me.

450
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:18,528
l'm stronger than he thinks.

451
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,615
Do you not listen to anything l tell you?

452
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:26,286
"Better to ask forgiveness
than permission."

453
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:37,464
your duty is to reach the Varden alive.

454
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:40,842
Let's talk about truth
bef ore we start talking about duty.

455
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,470
What are you talking about?

456
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:49,810
l thought we agreed
not to lie to one another...

457
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:55,148
...Dragon Rider.

458
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,943
Of course.

459
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,197
Not anymore.

460
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,164
Where's your dragon?

461
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:14,167
Dead.

462
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:24,553
She was murdered by another rider
with this sword...

463
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,763
...Za'roc.

464
00:54:28,224 --> 00:54:30,350
That sword is a dragon killer.

465
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,853
The rider's name...

466
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:36,148
...was Morzan.

467
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:42,821
Galbatorix won him over.

468
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:49,703
And while she was trying to protect me...

469
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,747
...my dragon was killed.

470
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,459
Better we...

471
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:58,837
...than our riders.

472
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:04,634
So l set out to search for Morzan.

473
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,679
And l found him.

474
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:14,269
l took his sword
and l drove it through his heart.

475
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:18,231
And as he died, so did his dragon...

476
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:24,446
...the last, except for the king's.

477
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,284
So l hid out in Carvahall...

478
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,496
...with a shame...

479
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,249
...l rightly deserved.

480
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:42,255
Because of me,
the days of the Dragon Riders were over.

481
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,510
Then you came.

482
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:49,262
you both came.

483
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:53,808
And now the days of the riders
have come again.

484
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:30,470
Bring me the boy, l said.

485
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:36,309
Bring me his blood...

486
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:41,731
...l said.

487
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,110
But you...

488
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:50,907
...you bring me nothing.

489
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:10,844
you.

490
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:18,143
Congratulations.
you've just been promoted.

491
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,816
l tire of this.

492
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,986
l'll bring the boy to me.

493
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,222
Tell me your name.

494
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:00,185
-Eragon.
-Eragon.

495
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:03,813
l am Arya, Princess of Ellesmera.

496
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,857
We are allies with the Varden.

497
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:08,526
you're the only one who can save me.

498
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,528
But how do l find you?

499
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:14,074
Durza holds me prisoner at Gil'ead.

500
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,969
-Where are you going?
-To find Arya.

501
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,306
How do you know that name?

502
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:40,684
She's Durza's prisoner.

503
00:58:41,602 --> 00:58:43,269
l'm going to free her.

504
00:58:43,521 --> 00:58:47,524
That's out of the question.
Gil'ead's in the opposite direction.

505
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,277
We can't start going back.
We're almost there.

506
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:57,158
l won't let you do that.
lt's too much of a risk.

507
00:58:57,326 --> 00:59:00,995
The egg was sent to me.
l'll decide what risks l take. Not you.

508
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,707
Eragon, this is more than about just us.

509
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,084
-lf l don't, she'll be killed.
-yes.

510
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,837
And it's a sacrifice she's happy to make...

511
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:11,631
...because she values your life over hers.

512
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,300
-l won't let her die.
-lf she dies...

513
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:18,012
...then she'll join the countless others
who have died waiting for you.

514
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,558
As the Varden now wait for you.

515
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,688
you must try and understand.
lt's your life that's important.

516
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:31,818
l do understand.

517
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,613
One false move, one reckless decision...

518
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,032
...and everything is lost.

519
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,371
lt's good to be brave,
but sometimes it's better to be wise.

520
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:48,168
-Eragon, listen to me.
-your shame is not mine.

521
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:53,381
you forgot what it means
to be a Dragon Rider.

522
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,092
l will save her.

523
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,345
-Eragon--
-Please don't, Saphira.

524
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,639
l'm the rider and l say we go.

525
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,491
You'll draw too much attention.

526
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,619
We'll have to wait for night
and l'll go in alone.

527
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:27,123
Those walls hold death, Eragon.

528
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:32,170
Not today, not for us.
l'm going to save her life. l can do this.

529
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:34,839
Our power is greatest
when we're together.

530
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:39,677
We can't truly be together
until l become as strong as you.

531
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,434
Move along, now.

532
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,355
Move faster.

533
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:55,276
Make way.

534
01:00:57,696 --> 01:00:59,989
keep up. Come on.

535
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,692
Eragon.

536
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,821
-you shouldn't have come.
-But in the woods....

537
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:25,408
Leave me here. Go. Now.

538
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:27,035
lt's far too late for that.

539
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:34,083
Forgive me if l stare.

540
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:39,172
l knew you were young, but even then
l expected someone a little more....

541
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,050
Well, more.

542
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:05,657
A young magician.

543
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:07,533
How quaint.

544
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,120
Do you already feel it
draining your strength?

545
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,464
They say as a Dragon Rider
draws his last breath...

546
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:26,260
...he can hear the dying screams
of his dragon.

547
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,057
Out of the way!

548
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,020
No!

549
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:40,692
you'll have to do much better than that.

550
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,541
-Get out.
-No. Not without you.

551
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:58,251
Come on. Let's go.

552
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:01,838
Go.

553
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,679
Take Za'roc.

554
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:25,903
Saphira, can you carry three?

555
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:27,905
Not for very long.

556
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:44,505
l suggest you leave quickly.

557
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,595
Come on. Let's get out of  here.

558
01:04:54,016 --> 01:04:55,433
Come on.

559
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:57,351
-Archers ready.
-Over here.

560
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,480
Higher. They're on the roof.

561
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:05,443
l can't. The weight, it's too much.

562
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:25,379
Eragon?

563
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,260
Durza....

564
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:33,805
-Durza....
-Durza's dead.

565
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,682
Did you pierce him through the heart?

566
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,855
you can only kill a Shade
if you pierce him through the heart.

567
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:48,444
-We must get help.
-Where?

568
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,906
-From the Varden.
-yes.

569
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,283
Go to the Varden.

570
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,372
Take this.

571
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,294
Go...

572
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,755
...without me.

573
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:11,926
No. l need you.

574
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:13,928
No, Eragon.

575
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:18,099
lt's l who've always needed you.

576
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:23,062
you gave me my lif e back again.

577
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:27,900
Take care of  Saphira.

578
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,736
Without her...

579
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,533
...you'll find lif e is hardly worth living.

580
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:38,411
l won't let you die.

581
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,080
Not for my mistake.

582
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,026
you are not strong enough...

583
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,904
...yet.

584
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:17,366
That's the spirit.

585
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:22,079
One part brave, three parts fool.

586
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,213
Forgive me.

587
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,260
Eragon. Let him die with pride...

588
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,685
...as a Dragon Rider.

589
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,815
l can't breathe fire yet...

590
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:35,236
...but l can do this for Brom:

591
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:49,208
Now time cannot ravage him.

592
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,919
Who will remember him?

593
01:08:53,714 --> 01:08:55,798
Many people will...

594
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:57,466
...because of you.

595
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,564
Eragon.

596
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,945
A Shade has poisoned her.
Someone's coming.

597
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:11,374
l need to get you to the Varden.
How do l find them?

598
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:36,607
-This one's been following us.
-Stand up.

599
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:41,570
All my life, l dreamed of dragons.

600
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,532
Who are you?
And why are you following us?

601
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:47,535
l'm Murtagh.
And you need me, Dragon Rider.

602
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:50,830
-Thanks, but l'll be fine without you.
-you seek the Varden.

603
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:56,001
l know the mountains,
every valley and stream.

604
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:59,296
She'll suffer if you go astray.

605
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:02,675
Why did you risk your life for us?

606
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:06,095
My f amily was slaughtered
by the king's men when l was a boy.

607
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:10,182
l heard rumors.
They said a rider had appeared.

608
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,019
Eragon. We must go.

609
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:20,192
lf there were ever a time for retribution,
this was it.

610
01:11:20,861 --> 01:11:23,362
lf you can show me
the quickest way to the Varden....

611
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:25,197
To the Varden it is.

612
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:34,206
you'll learn to trust me, Dragon Rider.

613
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,964
l'm not the only one
you need to convince.

614
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:15,122
We'll have to go by foot from here.

615
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:24,006
Saphira? keep Arya safe until l call.

616
01:12:24,174 --> 01:12:28,010
l will, but hurry. The Urgals are closing in.

617
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,824
Thanks again.

618
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,993
Don't mention it.

619
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:57,873
Tell me your vision
looked something like this.

620
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:00,626
Come on.

621
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:39,123
The task was simple: bring the boy to me.

622
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,793
There were complications.

623
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:45,004
yes, so l've heard.

624
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:47,840
Complications do tend to happen.

625
01:13:48,008 --> 01:13:52,511
But fortunately for you,
your incompetence may work in my f avor.

626
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:55,764
The boy has led us directly to the Varden.

627
01:13:56,933 --> 01:14:01,103
And so the job falls upon you, Durza...

628
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:05,899
...to remind those who resist my rule...

629
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:09,361
...that as long as l am king...

630
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:14,408
...disloyalty will be punishable by death.

631
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:20,497
Gather my army and follow them.

632
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,626
Leave no one alive.

633
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,589
-Move up there.
-Come on, get them on there.

634
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:34,637
Which one of you is the rider?

635
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,847
l am. My name is Eragon.

636
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:41,644
l am Ajihad, leader of the Varden.

637
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,438
lf you are the rider, call your beast inside.

638
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:47,941
lf it attacks, you will die first.

639
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:53,364
Saphira? Bring Arya, but be cautious.

640
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:15,552
How is Arya?

641
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:18,138
She's holding on.

642
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:21,266
Her heart beats faintly.

643
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,903
She's been poisoned by a Shade.

644
01:15:34,406 --> 01:15:36,782
Our healers will make her well.

645
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,283
Watch over Arya.

646
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:39,702
But be careful.

647
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,122
You be careful.

648
01:16:06,438 --> 01:16:09,732
-There are Urgals on the mountain.
-Urgals.

649
01:16:10,984 --> 01:16:13,235
They're scouring the mountain
as we speak.

650
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:16,321
Time is short.
l must know if you're with us.

651
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:19,408
We'll be greatly outnumbered.

652
01:16:23,455 --> 01:16:24,913
We've come to join you.

653
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,310
-Seize him.
-No.

654
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:54,651
He's with me. He saved my lif e.

655
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:58,989
He is the son of Morzan, the traitor.

656
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:04,119
ls it true?

657
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:07,664
A son doesn't choose his father.

658
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:11,668
This was the only thing he ever gave me.

659
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:17,090
l hated that man until the day he died.

660
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:21,053
Lock him up.
lf he tries to escape, kill him.

661
01:17:22,472 --> 01:17:25,140
-Let go of me.
-l've no time to take chances.

662
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:29,436
The Urgals' presence here can only mean
that the king's men are not f ar behind.

663
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:34,900
These cowards will hide no more.

664
01:17:35,777 --> 01:17:39,488
Tonight, we destroy the resistance.

665
01:17:44,077 --> 01:17:46,411
Annihilate.

666
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:58,340
But the boy is mine.

667
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:13,605
-Excuse me. l should have knocked.
-lt's fine.

668
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,941
My f ather asked me to bring you to him.

669
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:20,404
l'll be ready in just a moment.

670
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,993
Arya has responded well
to our healers' work.

671
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,246
-Her strength runs deep.
-When can l see her?

672
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:33,917
She's resting now.
Only she can answer that.

673
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,104
Check those rails.

674
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,274
They're af raid of me.

675
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,818
Why wouldn't they be?

676
01:19:00,445 --> 01:19:03,989
There's no retreat from here,
nowhere else to hide.

677
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:06,909
The suspicion has kept us alive
all these years.

678
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:11,663
When word spread
of a new Dragon Rider...

679
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:16,001
...we were expecting someone
who was more...

680
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,254
-...well....
-More than me.

681
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:24,635
l've heard it before.

682
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:27,429
More heat. Add more heat.

683
01:19:28,723 --> 01:19:31,391
-your armor is ready for you.
-Take your positions.

684
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:33,518
Come on, harder.

685
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:36,063
We must prepare for battle.

686
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:59,378
lt's not as easy as it looks, is it?

687
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:08,762
you look fit for battle.

688
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,643
-Positions.
-Ready?

689
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,396
Urgals are here.

690
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,481
Be strong, Eragon.

691
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:23,318
The search for a rider
has been long and dangerous.

692
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,613
Some of us have carried the egg
for as long as we can remember...

693
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:32,285
...hoping it would hatch,
when f ate finally carried it to you.

694
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:35,831
Why me?
l'm just a f arm boy from Carvahall.

695
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:40,335
Because that is who Saphira chose.

696
01:20:45,008 --> 01:20:47,509
l barely even recognize myself.

697
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:02,774
They worked through the night...

698
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:05,819
...to protect our greatest hope...

699
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,947
...and our leader who rides her.

700
01:21:13,745 --> 01:21:15,412
lt's time.

701
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,597
Take your positions.

702
01:22:05,505 --> 01:22:08,340
Ready the archers!

703
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,651
l need to know, Saphira. Why me?

704
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:13,029
You choose a leader for his heart.

705
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,158
But l'm not without fear.

706
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:19,035
Without fear there cannot be courage.

707
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:24,207
But when we are together,
it is our enemies who should be afraid.

708
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,751
And are we together, Saphira?

709
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,880
As one?

710
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:41,141
l'll take that as a yes.

711
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:48,940
Loose!

712
01:23:56,824 --> 01:23:58,491
Now!

713
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,788
lnto the sky, to win or die!

714
01:24:10,338 --> 01:24:11,963
Fire!

715
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:21,806
yeah!

716
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:29,856
Let me out! Let me out!

717
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:33,860
Let me out of  here! Let--!

718
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:17,922
-Oh, no.
-Time to return the favor.

719
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:25,180
l guess we're even!

720
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:46,409
Come! Taste the blood of  your dragon!

721
01:26:47,203 --> 01:26:48,787
Let's finish this.

722
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:02,967
What is that thing?

723
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:05,011
Dark magic.

724
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,643
Closer, so we can reach his heart.

725
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:14,521
This time, rip it out of his chest.

726
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,065
Saphira!

727
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:01,067
Hear her scream!

728
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:18,418
Saphira, you're hurt.

729
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,129
Don't worry about me.

730
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,548
Keep your mind in the fight.

731
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:45,653
What's happening? My vision's f ailing.

732
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:48,823
lt is not you, but me.

733
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:53,495
This wound weakens me.

734
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:59,792
Easy, Saphira.
We're gonna get through this together.

735
01:29:05,132 --> 01:29:06,591
l'm losing strength.

736
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:13,473
l know what l have to do.

737
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,533
Now!

738
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:43,795
That's for Brom.

739
01:29:46,632 --> 01:29:48,383
l expected more.

740
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:28,590
Saphira!

741
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:48,151
We did it.

742
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:50,486
Saphira?

743
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:54,032
Together.

744
01:30:57,411 --> 01:31:02,957
Whatever life there is in me, take it.

745
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:06,127
Eragon, no.

746
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:13,259
Even you don't have a heart...

747
01:31:13,427 --> 01:31:17,555
...strong enough for both of us.

748
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:09,000
Slowly, rider.

749
01:33:10,461 --> 01:33:12,170
Saphira?

750
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:18,259
Some friends can't be replaced.

751
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:32,690
Well, luckily, some don't have to be.

752
01:33:35,194 --> 01:33:37,904
Saphira. l didn't think l could do it.

753
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:42,325
You shouldn't have. lt was reckless...

754
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:44,118
...but l'm glad you did.

755
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:47,705
Wasn't it an old, wise man who once said:

756
01:33:47,873 --> 01:33:50,792
"One part brave, three parts fool"?

757
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:55,129
Brom would be proud of you.

758
01:33:57,216 --> 01:33:58,966
Of us.

759
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:02,637
And Arya?

760
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:06,390
Thought that might come up.
Get changed.

761
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:08,768
She's off to Ellesmera.

762
01:34:08,936 --> 01:34:12,522
But what horse was ever born
that could outrun a dragon?

763
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,947
you never gave me a chance
to say goodbye.

764
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:05,449
There was no time.

765
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:08,703
Galbatorix will try to avenge this defeat.

766
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:11,247
l must return to my people in Ellesméra.

767
01:35:11,415 --> 01:35:13,624
And you must prepare the Varden.

768
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:21,841
you lost those who were dear to you.

769
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:25,428
you've paid a great price for your courage.

770
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:32,560
Did you know the people of the Varden
already tell stories about you?

771
01:35:34,563 --> 01:35:36,772
Legend of Eragon,
the great Shade-slayer...

772
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,774
...spreads throughout Alagaësia.

773
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:42,528
Well, you know how legends go.

774
01:35:42,696 --> 01:35:45,323
People will believe
just about anything these days.

775
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:50,411
When will l see you again?

776
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,667
Time moves quickly.

777
01:35:56,835 --> 01:36:01,631
Only yesterday you were a farm boy.
Today you are a hero.

778
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:07,929
Tomorrow may see us together again.

779
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,893
Then l'll be waiting for tomorrow.

780
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,903
Tomorrow will come...

781
01:36:24,613 --> 01:36:26,739
...sooner than you think.

782
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:36,958
Take care of  him, Saphira.

783
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:38,834
l will.

784
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:57,561
Come.

785
