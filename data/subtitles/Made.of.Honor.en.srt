00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:40,504
Wow...

3
00:00:47,996 --> 00:00:49,744
Looking good...

4
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:55,786
Oh, yeah, nice to see you.

5
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:00,658
Hey...

6
00:01:00,754 --> 00:01:02,777
That dress needs dry-cleaning.

7
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:06,215
- Here you go.
- Thank you kindly, Monica.

8
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:10,866
Monica, Monica?
Oh shit, Hillary.

9
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:16,937
Okay...

10
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:20,385
- Hi, Bill.
- Oh hey Snow white.

11
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,706
Where's 11B?

12
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:26,783
Bingo.

13
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:29,833
What did you say
that thing was?

14
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,911
It's time for a little action.

15
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:40,105
Monica... It's Bill.

16
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:43,329
I've got some dictation
for you, Monica.

17
00:01:43,425 --> 00:01:46,278
I've got a big secret
for you, Baby.

18
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:49,112
How did you get up here
so soon?

19
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,263
Monica.

20
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:07,137
Oh my eyes..
I can't see.

21
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,150
Who let you in.?

22
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:11,789
What happened...
Where's Monica?

23
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:12,897
What happened to Monica?

24
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:14,218
- How did you get in here?

25
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,737
She told me where the key was.

26
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:16,791
- I can't see.

27
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,496
Did she say it was ok to
dry-hump her roommate?

28
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:19,736
She said, you would be in the...

29
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:20,976
library cause you
were a geek...

30
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:23,585
I am not a geek..
God.

31
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:27,345
My God.
What was that, mace?

32
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:31,384
'Eternity', by Calvin Klein.

33
00:02:35,585 --> 00:02:39,648
I gotta be so careful who I
get into bed with from now on.

34
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,738
It would be a big adjustment
for you, wouldn't it?

35
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:46,181
God.

36
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,924
I do that every time.

37
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,965
I've invented a solution
for that. Seriously.

38
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:53,467
It is something that
goes around the...

39
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:55,005
coffee cup, so you
don't burn your hand.

40
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:57,070
I'm gonna call it
'The Coffee Collar'.

41
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,126
Brilliant idea.

42
00:02:58,222 --> 00:02:59,926
I know all about you.
I know you whole wrap.

43
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:02,406
- You do?
- Yeah. You're a senior...

44
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:04,918
who prays on freshmen.
You've slept...

45
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:06,198
with half my floor.

46
00:03:06,294 --> 00:03:09,065
- Well, half your
floor was female.

47
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,000
Whatever.

48
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:11,209
And you once met Bono,

49
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:13,047
which I suspect is
total bullshit.

50
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:15,487
No, it's true.
He signed my CD.

51
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:17,487
It's upstairs in my room
with my...

52
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,518
'Coffee Collar',
if you wanna see it.

53
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:24,048
- Are you hitting on me?
- No. I'm going of your look.

54
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:27,096
- My look...
- Yeah, doggy bull look.

55
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:30,369
- Are you calling me a dog?
- No, it's a theory I have.

56
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,688
- Oh, Casanova has a theory.
- Yeah. When a girl...

57
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:34,271
is attracted to a
guy, she has a look.

58
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,369
It's her tell, like poker.

59
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,665
It's the same look a dog gets,

60
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,169
right before you
put down the bowl.

61
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,996
- You're offensive.
And you're crazy.

62
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:42,170
No, I'm honest.

63
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,889
I believe honesty is the best
policy.

64
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:44,469
Alright...

65
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,328
You want me to be
honest with you?

66
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,851
- Sure.
- I'm majoring in fine art.

67
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:49,237
- Right.

68
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,890
I'm studying the
golden proportions...

69
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:53,610
of the human face. And you're
nose is bent and...

70
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,790
and it drips down
at the bottom.

71
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:55,970
A feature that is
accentuated...

72
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,701
by the thinness of
your upper lip.

73
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:58,443
And your eyes,

74
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,051
are too far apart,
but they have to be...

75
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:02,892
to accommodate that bent nose.
And I feel sorry for you,

76
00:04:02,988 --> 00:04:05,126
that you have to validate
yourself through...

77
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:06,971
insatiable-meaning
less-ego-sport-sex,

78
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,691
with insecure girls
like my roommate.

79
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:13,700
I... Would never have sex with
someone... Like you.

80
00:04:17,061 --> 00:04:18,685
Hey come here.

81
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:20,413
That was amazing.

82
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:21,992
- What was?
- The honesty.

83
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:25,493
That was better than sex
without the... The crying.

84
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:26,736
- Actually it did
feel pretty good.

85
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:27,534
Yeah, no one's ever...

86
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,611
been that honest
with me before.

87
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,334
It's called a friend.

88
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,694
I'm Tom, by the way.

89
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,393
- Hannah.
- Hannah? That's a palindrome.

90
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,023
Well, good night.

91
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,461
Good night.

92
00:04:39,182 --> 00:04:41,069
- Your hands, Clammy...

93
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:44,481
Well, I can see that
you're knocked out.

94
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:52,903
Tom, is that you?
Can I see your Bono-autograph?

95
00:04:57,784 --> 00:05:00,385
She's all yours, friend.

96
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:04,665
Monica, get some sleep.

97
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:16,946
MADE OF HONOR

98
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:24,467
Subs by: Macco

99
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,151
What time is it?

100
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:28,390
I'm late.

101
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:32,593
What are you doing tonight?

102
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,034
I don't do 'back to backs'.

103
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,035
- Isn't that what we
were doing last night?

104
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:42,777
No, that was
something different.

105
00:06:42,873 --> 00:06:44,663
'Back to Backs' is
seeing each other two...

106
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,506
nights in a row. You
know I don't do that.

107
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:48,491
- Couldn't you just break
one of your stupid rules?

108
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:49,547
No.

109
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:50,602
- For me.

110
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:53,876
I'm sorry, but I
don't break the rules.

111
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:56,194
I have a rule about that.

112
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,515
See you next week.

113
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,143
Thanks.

114
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:48,319
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

115
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,712
Can I get a grandee drip,
and a decaff,

116
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:52,973
triple grandee, non-fat,

117
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:54,993
extra hot, stirred
milk Como Macchiato.

118
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,273
With whip cream,
extra caramel.

119
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:00,760
Fill that 70% of the way.
Thank you.

120
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:08,314
Here, let me put a 'Coffee-
Collar' on that.

121
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:08,810
- Thank you.

122
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,393
I hear that the guy
that invented that...

123
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,314
gets a dime for each one used.
- You're kidding.

124
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,523
I am not.
That could add up.

125
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,161
I think I picked up
yours by accident.

126
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:19,035
Sorry about that.

127
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,310
- That's alright. Thank you.
- Any time.

128
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,721
Bye-bye.

129
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:33,164
Gloria.

130
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:19,007
Morning.

131
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:20,440
Good morning, Hannah.

132
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:22,392
Coffee, the way you like it.

133
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:24,532
Perfect timing. I
just finished...

134
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:25,872
working on his balls.

135
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:29,890
That's eh... Yeah.
So I made a reservation.

136
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:33,233
- So what rule is this?
- No 'back to backs'.

137
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:34,513
Isn't that the same as the...

138
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:35,921
'no more than once
a week'-rule?

139
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:36,953
No, the 'no more than
once a week'-rule...

140
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:37,562
works Monday to Fridays.

141
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:39,214
So theoretically
you could have a

142
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,402
Sunday night and Monday
without breaking it.

143
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,123
Exactly, you got it.

144
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,322
Here we go.
Hey, good morning.

145
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,402
Can I get the steamed buns...

146
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:49,520
the scalloped
steamed ducklings...

147
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,004
and the vegetarian
and shrimp steamed...

148
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,203
- Thank you.
- For what?

149
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:55,848
You know how much I
love the fried stuff.

150
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:57,036
You look after me.

151
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:58,804
Excellent.
So, what did you say?

152
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,504
- She was hurt,
but you know...

153
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,044
But you where honest, right?

154
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,684
What? I was.
I am. Always.

155
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,999
I know you are, but
it's just shocking...

156
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,925
to see how you use
it as a shield.

157
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,085
Maybe I should lie.
Be more like Dennis Philips,

158
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:13,100
and say whatever it takes
to get a woman into bed.

159
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,485
No, do not be like
Dennis Philips.

160
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,966
- He's so gross.
- He only hit on you once.

161
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:19,006
At my father’s funeral.

162
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:21,165
Okay, so he's not known
for his sensitivity.

163
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:24,046
Oh, God.
Anyways...

164
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:26,934
- What?
- Nothing.

165
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:28,547
I know that 'nothing'.
It's not...

166
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:29,287
nothing, it's something.

167
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,407
- 'Anyway'...?
- Anyway we both know,

168
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,197
you don't need to
lie to get a woman...

169
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:33,647
into bed.

170
00:10:33,743 --> 00:10:34,727
Gloria.

171
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:36,967
I don't wanna lose that.
Can I keep that? Thank you.

172
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,847
See there's another rule too.
The 24 hour-rule.

173
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:40,748
I can't call her for another
24 hours.

174
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:43,801
Cause then it appears
that I'm too desperate.

175
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:45,688
You know, Dan sent
me another letter?

176
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,768
Asking you to move to Canada
and marry him again?

177
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:51,399
- A slice of apple-crumb pie?
- No, we did that last time.

178
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:53,197
- You guys broke up
like a year ago.

179
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:53,730
19 months.

180
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:54,991
- You're counting?

181
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,330
No. He is... It
was in the letter.

182
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:59,209
Lemon butter cream cup?

183
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,914
Not feeling the
cream cup today.

184
00:11:02,057 --> 00:11:03,497
- Cranberry orange muffin?

185
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:05,490
Hannah, come on.
You're losing it.

186
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:08,162
- I know, I know... Okay.
- Think about it.

187
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:09,630
- Come on. You're
disappointing.

188
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:10,610
I got it, I got it...

189
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,891
- Yeah.
- Wait, I so have it...

190
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,459
Cream cheese sorrel brownie.

191
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,139
You're so good.

192
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,931
What do you think of this?
I think we should get this.

193
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:29,646
Tom, I am not going to another
one of your fathers weddings.

194
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:32,493
Thank you.
Hannah? Please?

195
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:34,573
Take one of the girls you've
been rubbing up against.

196
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,332
'No weddings or
family events'.

197
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,372
That's right.
I forgot that rule.

198
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:40,837
- It gives the
wrong impression.

199
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,852
It does.

200
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:45,906
- Is this made with
real alligator?

201
00:11:46,002 --> 00:11:47,173
Yes, baby-alligator.

202
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,901
- You should be
ashamed of yourself.

203
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,174
Look at you.

204
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,695
Hello there...
And who would you be?

205
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,695
I love you. Yes I do.
I love you.

206
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,270
You're so pretty. Yes you are.

207
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,015
You're beautiful. Yes you
are. Your beautiful face...

208
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:05,455
I love you, love
you, love you.

209
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,537
You should try saying that to
a human sometime.

210
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:09,896
What?
A human?

211
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:12,184
To say it to a human?.

212
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,536
You're sweet.
Love you.

213
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,128
Hannah, please.
Come to the wedding.

214
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:19,081
He gets married and
I go. I go because...

215
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:21,217
he's my father and I
care deeply for the man.

216
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:22,844
And everybody knows
he doesn't love...

217
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,137
them, and they don't love him.

218
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,859
It's pathetic, it
breaks my heart.

219
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,138
I don't know what to say.

220
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:28,552
You know when someone's
making a mistake...

221
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:29,777
and it's not your
place to interfere.

222
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:31,858
You simply say:
'I'm happy you're happy'.

223
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,617
- I'm happy you're happy.
- Yeah.

224
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,707
Okay. I'll do that.

225
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:38,022
I promise you, this is the...

226
00:12:38,118 --> 00:12:39,698
last time I'll
ask you to come.

227
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,355
And then I'll find
somebody else...

228
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:42,691
to come to the next funeral.

229
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:45,108
Hannah, please.

230
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:49,707
That's cute.

231
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:53,987
- Last time.
- Thank you. Thank you.

232
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:06,966
She gets the
apartment in the city,

233
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:08,061
and 30 grand a month.

234
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:10,075
Right.
Right, okay.

235
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:11,353
You get the house in
the Hamptons, she's...

236
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:12,541
asking for the
apartment in the city,

237
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:14,262
and 30 grand a month.
- Thirty? But...

238
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,982
Are you still negotiating
a pre-nup?

239
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,341
Now the party starts...
My son is here.

240
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:20,931
Dad, you’re getting
married in 10 minutes.

241
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:22,735
Dad, please, I can't breathe.

242
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:24,448
- Did you bring
the lovely Hannah?

243
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:25,503
Yes, I did.

244
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:26,581
You know, if you
don't act on that...

245
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:27,743
pretty soon, you know
what I'm gonna do?

246
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,798
- No.

247
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,103
I'm gonna make
her my number 6.

248
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,632
Seven...
This is number 6.

249
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,784
- Yeah.
- My God, you are pretty.

250
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,264
Dad.

251
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,262
- I used to be
that pretty once.

252
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:42,384
Dennis, look how
pretty my boy is.

253
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,885
Yeah, he's beautiful.
They won't...

254
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:45,385
accept a minimum
of 5 times a week.

255
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:47,043
- She promised 5, I want 5.

256
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,536
What did she promise
you, 5 times a week?

257
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:51,551
- 4 times?
- Two.

258
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:53,995
No, no...
We're not done yet.

259
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,980
- She says 3, with
a bi-monthly BJ.

260
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,218
This is disturbing.

261
00:13:58,313 --> 00:13:59,745
4 and make it weekly.

262
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:02,453
Wait, no... Driver
go around the block.

263
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,138
We are not even close...

264
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,152
What was that?

265
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:10,907
Come on.
Come on, tell me.

266
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,467
- Say what you gotta say.
- I'm happy, If you're happy.

267
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,747
No, no...'You're
too old for her dad'.

268
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:18,227
'She doesn't love you,
this is embarrassing'.

269
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:19,668
'You're gonna rack up
your fifth divorce'.

270
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,682
- Sixth.
- Sixth.

271
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:26,428
- I'm happy, if you're happy.
- Bullshit.

272
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:28,348
Go for 4 if you exercise more.

273
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,269
She says you can't gain
any more weight.

274
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:31,629
- Take it. Deal.
- Deal.

275
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,710
I told her I weigh 10 pounds
more than I do.

276
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,269
- Ain't love grand?
- Sign the both please.

277
00:14:35,365 --> 00:14:36,324
What's he signing now?

278
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,470
His current pre-nup and
his last divorce-papers.

279
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:40,484
That's just great...

280
00:14:43,037 --> 00:14:46,118
Your good. Thank you.

281
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:27,640
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

282
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,574
- Did you tell your
dad you love him?

283
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,834
I told him I cared for him.

284
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,434
You can't even
tell your father.

285
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,795
- I don't get that.
- It's a 'Guy thing'.

286
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:38,763
No, it's a 'Tom thing'.

287
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:42,354
- You're an 'I love you-slut'.
- Are you kidding me?

288
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,109
You say it all the time.
To everybody.

289
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:46,278
- Oh, this looks so good.

290
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:47,716
Yeah, it looks
good doesn't it?

291
00:15:47,812 --> 00:15:51,269
I should have ordered
this. this look good.

292
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:54,137
You always order
better than I do.

293
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:58,037
It's lemon, right? It's good.
I'm ordering that from now on.

294
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,157
- No, you won't.
- Why?

295
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,121
I need you to order
the chocolate cake...

296
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:02,057
so I can have some.

297
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:05,165
- There's my 'son'.
- There you go...

298
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:09,886
Oh, you're bad boy
I'm gonna spank you.

299
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:13,791
You know what I would like
to say to you? Is that...

300
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:15,624
- I want you to
listen to me, Tom.

301
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:16,678
Yeah.

302
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:18,812
If you need any advice...

303
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:21,398
- or you need any advice...
- Right.

304
00:16:21,495 --> 00:16:24,756
Or you got girl problems,
I don't know...

305
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:27,611
I need you to think
of me how you...

306
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:28,999
would a real mother.

307
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,483
- Yeah that's
exactly what I...

308
00:16:30,578 --> 00:16:31,920
Look at this beauty, will you?

309
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,935
Hello, Sweety

310
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,460
Drunk as the night I first
met her.

311
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:42,226
- You are a bad
influence on her.

312
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,281
Me?

313
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,295
- Last shot?
- Thanks.

314
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,673
- I'm stealing you away...
- Last one...

315
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,411
- He does know that he
can just date, right?

316
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,637
No, I don't think he does.

317
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:57,504
- To mothers.
- To mothers. Cheers.

318
00:17:00,011 --> 00:17:01,929
Careful.

319
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,409
Nice...

320
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,076
Oh God...

321
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:16,244
Hide me.

322
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,299
- What?

323
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:18,956
It's my dad’s
patient coordinator.

324
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,239
Yeah, don't look,
don't look...

325
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:21,084
There... Don't look.

326
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,677
She's obsessed with me.

327
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,477
She's created a website called
'allthingstom. org'.

328
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:27,611
- A Psycho blogger?
- Yes.

329
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,605
Okay. Come on...
Dance with me.

330
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,185
- Watch yourself.
- She's kind of cute.

331
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,605
- Oh stop it.
- I'm serious...

332
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,620
Keep going.

333
00:17:35,414 --> 00:17:39,774
Here. Right here. Hide me.
back side, side. Go, go...

334
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:44,951
The last blog was a
2 page description...

335
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,006
of my face.

336
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:48,041
See, she doesn't think
my nose is too...

337
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:49,527
bent or my lips are too thin.

338
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:52,599
- Who said that?
- You did. When we met.

339
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:54,613
- Well, I lied.
- What?

340
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:59,449
- I thought you were hot.
- Really?

341
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,728
Well, you told me I looked
like a dog.

342
00:18:00,824 --> 00:18:03,920
That was just cause I was
trying to sleep with you.

343
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,935
Why haven't you since?

344
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:10,168
Well... I like having you
in my life.

345
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:12,289
- ...
- Hi, Tom.

346
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:14,009
- Oh, hi.
- Did you see the new blog?

347
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,023
No, we haven't.

348
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:19,602
- Who's this?
- This? This is my girlfriend.

349
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,449
Why didn't you tell me you
we’re seeing someone?

350
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:23,490
Because I don't know you.

351
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:26,131
But we have a really, really
open relationship...

352
00:18:26,227 --> 00:18:26,453
- Really?

353
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:27,870
You know? I wanted to
talk to you about that,

354
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,410
- princess.
- Princess?

355
00:18:29,506 --> 00:18:31,811
I... I don't wanna be with
anybody but you.

356
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:33,062
I don't know if
I’m really quite...

357
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:34,211
ready to make that
commitment...

358
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:36,916
- Are you?
- You know my rules...

359
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,989
- I'm bit of an
emotional retard.

360
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,043
Yeah...

361
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:43,319
I think I need to
start a new blog now.

362
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,330
- That is so scary.

363
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:47,452
She's psychotic on top of P..

364
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:49,466
Oh, this is not good.

365
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,414
- Saia da minha frente.
- Ei.

366
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:03,654
Okay, good... She's gone.
Perfect. Let's go.

367
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,668
Good, come on.
What?

368
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,693
Do you remember that ancestral
home in Scotland,

369
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,455
with those amazing paintings
I told you about?

370
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,095
- It's all I think about.
- Stop it, Tom.

371
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:16,535
I finally got the board to
sign of...

372
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,454
on making editions to a
permanent collection.

373
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,895
Really?

374
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:21,400
But they want me to go to

375
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,255
Scotland for an
aquisitionship.

376
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:24,976
- When are you going?
- A couple of days.

377
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,033
- Couple of days?
For how long?

378
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:28,088
Six weeks.

379
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,103
That's a long time.

380
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,176
- That's great.
- You think?

381
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,888
Yes, it's a great opportunity
for you.

382
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:39,410
You're like the
'museum maiden of the Met'.

383
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,669
It's got a good ring to it...

384
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:45,985
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

385
00:19:48,265 --> 00:19:50,184
Six Sundays.

386
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,339
- That is six Sundays.

387
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,530
What am I gonna
do without you?

388
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:57,586
I can just imagine.

389
00:19:58,107 --> 00:20:00,179
- Yeah...
- What are you doing?

390
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,460
- I'm gonna jump.
- No, no.

391
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:02,740
- I'm gonna jump.
- Jesus.

392
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,012
Six Sundays,
how can I live without you?

393
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,139
Can you not take
anything seriously?

394
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:09,273
- Yeah, I can.
- Get down.

395
00:20:09,428 --> 00:20:11,172
- Let's get you another drink.

396
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:13,253
I think I've had
too many already.

397
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,009
- Thanks for coming
to the wedding.

398
00:20:15,105 --> 00:20:15,740
It was a ball,

399
00:20:15,836 --> 00:20:17,534
- I can't wait
for number seven.

400
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,653
It's coming up soon,
I have a feeling.

401
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,293
We also ask at this time that...

402
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:23,380
you turn off all your
electronic devices.

403
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:26,576
Please leave your
cell phones turned...

404
00:20:26,577 --> 00:20:29,430
off for the duration
of the flight.

405
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,423
- I'm not gonna be able
to play today, man.

406
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,638
If we don't have a
fourth, we are gonna...

407
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:47,743
end up playing with
'Tiny-Shorts Guy'.

408
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,984
- So?
- Hey, how's it going?

409
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,544
- Need another?
- No, our friend Paul,

410
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,195
- with longer
shorts, is coming.

411
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:52,543
Right.

412
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:55,024
No, Jenny signed him up
for some art walk thing...

413
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,745
Art walk? Are you serious?
Tell me something.

414
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,232
What do you think Jenny
did with his balls...

415
00:20:58,328 --> 00:20:58,984
when she cut them off?

416
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,664
Come on, guys,
marriage isn't that bad.

417
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,665
I agree. Without marriage
there would be no divorce,

418
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,986
and without divorce I wouldn't
have my condo in Aspen.

419
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,000
Bingo.

420
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:08,705
- Good one.
- What is he?

421
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:09,759
I'm serious, man.

422
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,905
Your missing out on
the best parts of life.

423
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:13,382
- The most important
part of life.

424
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:15,026
This coming from the
guy who's wife...

425
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:16,507
won't let him own porn.
He's gotta wank off...

426
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:18,906
to the underwear section
of the Sears catalogue.

427
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:20,870
I thought we weren't
gonna talk...

428
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:21,538
about that?

429
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:22,580
What's the matter with you?

430
00:21:22,677 --> 00:21:24,027
You are single and
you've been single,

431
00:21:24,123 --> 00:21:25,226
ever since...
What was her name?

432
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:26,399
- Sophomore year.

433
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:28,827
Plim... Pimpkin,
Pimpkin, that's it.

434
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:30,627
Pimpkin dumped you for him.

435
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,230
Sophomore year, you've
never been the same...

436
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:33,348
you haven't been
able to sleep.

437
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:34,403
- Scarred...

438
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:36,827
Yeah. You have no
idea, how nice it is...

439
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:38,700
to have someone who
is gonna be there,

440
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:39,948
no matter what, whatever.

441
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:40,754
- Snaps to that.

442
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,509
And you don't know
how nice it is...

443
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,549
to sleep with a different
girl every night.

444
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:47,356
- That's true.
- Nice recital.

445
00:21:48,116 --> 00:21:50,349
You got the best of
both worlds, Tom.

446
00:21:50,445 --> 00:21:51,039
No, it's true.

447
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,550
I can sleep with
whoever I want.

448
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,150
But I still get to hang
out with Hannah afterwards.

449
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:54,961
- Perfect setup.

450
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:56,629
Yeah, well maybe
not for Hannah...

451
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:58,161
- What's that
supposed to mean?

452
00:21:58,257 --> 00:21:59,549
Come on, Tom. She's a woman.

453
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:00,790
Yeah, I got that.

454
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:01,830
- You sure?
- Yeah.

455
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:04,751
Tom, she's pushing 30.
You think her idea of...

456
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:07,111
'Happily ever after' is
coming home to you...

457
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,190
and hanging out after
you got laid?

458
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,895
- Makes you think, right?
- Yeah.

459
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,512
- Hallo?
- Hey.

460
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:23,863
- Hi.

461
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,671
How's the weather in England?

462
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:28,833
It's great.
Only I'm in Scotland.

463
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,240
Right, right.
So it's sunny?

464
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:38,433
It's 3 in the morning.
- Oh, right. Sorry.

465
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,448
- So it's dark.
- Yeah.

466
00:22:40,522 --> 00:22:43,456
Have you seen the
Loch Ness Monster?

467
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:45,385
- I know, terrible joke...

468
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:46,946
Was there something important?

469
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,826
Yeah. You'll
never guess what happened.

470
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:50,856
- What?
- They filled in the pot hole.

471
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:53,643
- The pot hole?
- On 83rd.

472
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:56,715
- Terrific... Hey, Tom?.
- Yeah?

473
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:58,692
- I'm gonna go
back to sleep now.

474
00:22:58,788 --> 00:22:59,747
Ok. Sure.

475
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:01,587
Love you.

476
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:04,129
Good night...
Call me tomorrow.

477
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:17,801
- This stuff's all old...
- Yeah, that's the point.

478
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,658
- Let's go to Fendi...
- Fendi? No.

479
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:22,362
We're here,
let's just stay here.

480
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:24,237
I'm not into old stuff.

481
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,958
Why do you talk like
a six-year-old?

482
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:27,973
I'm not.

483
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:31,470
The line is too long...

484
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:33,201
- Can't we just go
somewhere else?

485
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:33,398
No.

486
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:35,230
This is the best
bakery in the world.

487
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:37,111
That's why it's worth
waiting in line.

488
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,191
Come on.
We'll play a game.

489
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,040
- Wanna play a game?
- Yeah, I can play a game.

490
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,399
Okay. Good.

491
00:23:42,495 --> 00:23:44,942
- Tell me what to order.
- Why?

492
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:48,636
You'll see. It will be fun.
Make a suggestion.

493
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,999
- A cookie.
- No, you have to be specific,

494
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:53,298
like what type of cookie...

495
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:56,567
A really big cookie.

496
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,452
Tom, your phone's ringing...

497
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,250
Hallo. Hallo?

498
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,289
Hallo...

499
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,674
- What's wrong?
- Just an important call.

500
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,076
That's because you are
an important person.

501
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:27,330
Wait. Hey...

502
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:28,644
We will have...

503
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,475
2 fried dumplings,
2 of the wantons...

504
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,084
and 6 of the fried
'pork-thingies'.

505
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,417
- Yeah. But that's
fried. It's not healthy.

506
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:38,484
Oh, come on. Have
some of the fried...

507
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,500
It won't hurt you.

508
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:43,118
Thank you.

509
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:45,773
Move, please..

510
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:48,331
God.

511
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,412
This is unbelievable.

512
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:52,446
- Hallo?
- Hey, hallo?

513
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:54,967
- Hallo?
- Hannah?

514
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:56,646
- Hallo?
- Hey.

515
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:59,507
Tom?
Tom is that you?

516
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,521
- Tom?
- Hallo?

517
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:03,079
Hallo? You're cutting out,

518
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:05,167
I can't hear anything
you're saying.

519
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:07,607
Tom? I'm stuck in a
thunderstorm.

520
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:10,108
I'm surrounded by a world
of cows.

521
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:11,838
- I'll call you when
I get to the hotel...

522
00:25:11,934 --> 00:25:12,567
I can't hear you.

523
00:25:12,663 --> 00:25:14,581
Tom?

524
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,695
Hallo.

525
00:25:30,058 --> 00:25:32,097
Hallo. Hallo?

526
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,616
Hallo?

527
00:25:42,859 --> 00:25:44,779
I hate Scotland.

528
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,853
- Having a hard time?
- We're having a hard time...

529
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:15,933
- Oh yeah? Want a hand?
- Thank you, sir.

530
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:17,374
- Yeah.
- We would love it.

531
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:19,934
- You'd better sit down, sir.
- ...

532
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,814
- Sit down.
- Sit, sit, sit.

533
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:23,828
Here we go.

534
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:26,334
- Thank you.
- No, no, thank you.

535
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,174
- Thank you.
- Have a good afternoon.

536
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,189
You were wonderful.

537
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:45,656
- Desista enquanto pode.
- Here we go.

538
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:48,456
- Come on, Scott.
- Let's go.

539
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:49,395
What you got, Gar?

540
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:51,176
What you got, Gar?
What do you got?

541
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:54,045
- Come on.
- What do you got, Gary?

542
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:55,756
Foul. Foul, Tom.

543
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:57,698
What the matter
with you today?

544
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:01,626
Ahh... I think I might have
feelings for Hannah.

545
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:06,118
Come on, come on...
Let's just play.

546
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:08,384
It's just...

547
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:10,281
Without her, something’s off,

548
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:11,619
and it's got me
thinking that maybe...

549
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:15,464
there's more to life than
just sleeping around.

550
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:18,660
- I don't understand...
- I'm not following...

551
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:21,253
Come on, let's just play.
Come on.

552
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,327
- I'll take it out.

553
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:24,212
I know exactly what
you mean, Tom.

554
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:26,428
Thanks. Here you go.

555
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:28,859
I'm gonna tell Hannah.
When she gets home.

556
00:27:28,955 --> 00:27:30,589
I'm gonna tell her that
i wanna be with her,

557
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:31,821
not marriage,
just be together.

558
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:33,873
Yeah, that's romantic...

559
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:38,909
>You have one unheard
message<

560
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,842
Hey, Tom. I'm back.
God, I cannot wait to see you.

561
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:44,942
I don't care what you're
doing tonight, cancel it.

562
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,182
We're going to dinner.

563
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:47,582
Meet me at that new
trendy place,

564
00:27:47,678 --> 00:27:49,201
next to the small
Greek place we hated,

565
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:51,142
that used to be the
Thai-fusion place we loved.

566
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:55,396
Meet me there 8 o'clock,
I have so much to tell you.

567
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,255
- Hey, what have you got?

568
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,856
Hey Buddy. I'll
find you something.

569
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:11,870
Alright...

570
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,184
Here's something.
How many do you want?

571
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,185
- I'll take the yellow ones.
- Good choice. Ten bucks.

572
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,198
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

573
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:21,605
- Have a good night.
- I will.

574
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:31,466
- Sorry, is she already here?
- Over there.

575
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:33,480
Yeah, thanks.

576
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,357
Oh, God.

577
00:29:06,797 --> 00:29:08,033
- Tom, are you okay?

578
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:09,942
I'm alright. Are you alright?

579
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,390
I think I have a broken rib.

580
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:12,121
- Your flowers, sir.

581
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,471
They're not mine.
I'm fine, I'm okay..

582
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:14,830
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

583
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:16,790
- I'm so sorry.
- You alright?

584
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,750
- Here are your flowers.
- What, what...

585
00:29:18,845 --> 00:29:20,390
- You had flowers?
- They're not my flowers.

586
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:22,470
- They're your flowers.
- I didn't have flowers.

587
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:24,751
- Hi. It's so good to see you.
- I've missed you.

588
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:25,806
- Great.

589
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,591
Come here, there's someone
I want you to meet.

590
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:29,143
Oh good.

591
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:31,123
It started pouring
and suddenly it...

592
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:32,793
was just me in
a field of cows.

593
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:34,152
And, of course we're in Europe...

594
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:35,712
so there's no street
signs anywhere...

595
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:36,481
- and it's getting dark...

596
00:29:36,577 --> 00:29:37,472
And then she thought
she was in...

597
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:41,889
some bad werewolf movie.
'Stay off the moors, Lassie'.

598
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,525
Anyway... all of the
sudden, out of nowhere.

599
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:47,713
Colin comes riding
up on horseback.

600
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:49,393
- Can you believe it? A horse.
- Oh...

601
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,194
He asked me if I
needed any help.

602
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,433
You were a 'Lady in distress',
what was I supposed to do?

603
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:56,382
It was right out
of a Bronte-novel.

604
00:29:57,082 --> 00:30:00,355
So anyway... He shows me
to this charming little Inn.

605
00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:01,806
Were he proceeds to buy me...

606
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:03,594
the most awful dinner
I've ever had.

607
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,602
It was pretty bad,
even by Scottish standards.

608
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:09,155
Then we just spend the next...

609
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:10,356
month travelling
around the country,

610
00:30:10,452 --> 00:30:14,935
getting to know each other,
visiting museums... It was..

611
00:30:14,964 --> 00:30:16,882
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

612
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:25,364
So... When it was time for
Hannah to leave, I just...

613
00:30:25,764 --> 00:30:28,589
I don't know, I just...
Couldn't let her go.

614
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:30,356
- So I got down on one knee...

615
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:32,236
And he proposed.
And I accepted.

616
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:33,955
- Wow. That's
just... Huge, it's...

617
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:36,197
So the wedding's coming
together very quickly.

618
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:36,893
- Sounds like it.

619
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,278
We're gonna be
married in Scotland,

620
00:30:38,374 --> 00:30:39,366
- At Colin's
parents summer home.

621
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,518
It's gonna be a
pretty small thing.

622
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:42,515
We can't expect
too many people...

623
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:45,030
making the trip over
sea, just for a night.

624
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:46,358
- The Fourth?
- Right.

625
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:48,279
- That's two weeks.
- It's crazy, isn't it?

626
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,627
- Have you ever been
to Scotland, Tom?

627
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:50,359
You know, I haven't.

628
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:52,476
- You should see the wee
church we're gonna have.

629
00:30:52,572 --> 00:30:54,679
It's the same one Colin's
parent's were married in.

630
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:56,383
It's pretty spectacular,
just a walk...

631
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,239
from my distillery.

632
00:30:57,335 --> 00:30:57,771
- Distillery?

633
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:59,080
Colin's family owns
the largest...

634
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:01,848
whiskey distillery in
Scotland.

635
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:04,689
Tom.. Look, If you're
getting married

636
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:06,993
I expect to be
your 'Best Man'.

637
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:11,409
Tom... Will you be my
'Maid of Honor'?

638
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:16,447
Your 'Maid of Honor'?

639
00:31:18,449 --> 00:31:20,367
Sorry.

640
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,002
What is it with you, man?
I didn't...

641
00:31:26,098 --> 00:31:29,650
Excuse me... Excuse me.
Did you see that?

642
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,608
'Made of Honor'?

643
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:36,084
That's fun stuff.
But you're a guy.

644
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,284
Go ahead...
Just get it out.

645
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:40,364
So, what did you say?

646
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:41,763
- Did you say yes?
- No.

647
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:41,961
- No?

648
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:43,723
I didn't know what to say. I
told her I'd think about it.

649
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,303
You need to think
about whether your...

650
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:46,844
dress is gonna make
your ass look big.

651
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,564
- Give me a break, come on.
- Okay. Alright, let me think.

652
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,691
- Is she really
in to this guy?

653
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:51,644
You should have seen them.

654
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,925
Staring at him all moony
like he shits unicorns.

655
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:54,687
That's not good, man.

656
00:31:54,783 --> 00:31:56,164
I'm thinking you're
gonna have to do this.

657
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,524
You're gonna have to be
the Maid of Honor.

658
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:57,932
- What?

659
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,725
Yeah, I'm serious.
Think about it,

660
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:01,220
this will give you
an excuse to be...

661
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:02,325
around Hannah all the time.

662
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,028
Helping her out, being...

663
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:06,126
'the man behind
the curtain'...

664
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:08,178
You'll be her confident.

665
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:09,588
And you can use that
time to point...

666
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,166
out to Hannah that
this is really crazy.

667
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,190
- And that she doesn't
even know this guy at all.

668
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:14,607
No, I'm not gonna
do that. No way.

669
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:15,847
- What?
- No.

670
00:32:15,943 --> 00:32:19,692
Look, I don't know what your
other options are.

671
00:32:19,694 --> 00:32:21,220
You got a better
chance of stopping...

672
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:21,807
this wedding,

673
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:24,008
from 'inside'
than from another continent.

674
00:32:24,103 --> 00:32:25,944
And they say that you can...

675
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,960
shorten this and wear
it again, if you like.

676
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:30,897
Come on man. If you're
serious and you...

677
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:32,648
really want Hanna
back from this guy.

678
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,441
You're gonna have to
do whatever it takes.

679
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,737
Whatever.

680
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:51,035
- The dress is beautiful.
- Thank you.

681
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:53,915
- I am so happy
you're gonna do this.

682
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:54,970
My pleasure.

683
00:32:55,066 --> 00:32:57,510
For this wedding, I am willing
to do whatever it takes.

684
00:32:57,606 --> 00:32:59,371
- I'm so excited.
- Yeah, me too.

685
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,397
So let me tell you who the...

686
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,491
other bridesmaids
are gonna be.

687
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:02,611
- Okay.
- Okay. Stephanie...

688
00:33:02,707 --> 00:33:04,371
- Stephanie, great.
- And she loves you.

689
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:04,668
- Good.

690
00:33:04,764 --> 00:33:05,891
And my friend
Hillary, from camp.

691
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:06,930
Hillary, I don't know Hillary.

692
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,945
- She's the best
- Okay.

693
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:10,872
- And Melissa.
- Oh, no.

694
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,534
- I had to, Tom,
she's my cousin.

695
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,412
No, she hates me.

696
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:15,852
- Well, you broke her heart.
- She broke my nose.

697
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:18,133
- It was an accident.
- She hit me with her fist.

698
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,249
I was completely
honest with her.

699
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:20,333
I said: 'Look,
nothing serious'.

700
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:22,347
And she agreed.

701
00:33:22,428 --> 00:33:24,293
So sometimes our hearts don't
match our mouths.

702
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:25,533
That's good, you should
put that in your vows.

703
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,011
And, she's been
wanting to be my...

704
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:28,694
maid of honor since
we were 5 years old,

705
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,614
so now she's really gonna
hate you.

706
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,893
Here they are now.

707
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:34,631
Okay. Well as your
Maid of Honor.

708
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:37,011
I promise to keep the peace.

709
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:49,864
Oh, hi.

710
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,421
Yes. The bride to be.

711
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:54,015
- Hello, you must be Tom.
- And you must be Hillary.

712
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:56,030
You look gorgeous.

713
00:33:56,344 --> 00:33:59,608
Stephanie, how are you doing?
So good to see you.

714
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,617
- Are you kidding.
- It's you, Melissa.

715
00:34:01,713 --> 00:34:03,944
Look at that...

716
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,217
- This was great.
- This isn't awkward...

717
00:34:09,312 --> 00:34:11,344
Go on.
I'm gonna be fine.

718
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,458
- Tom, have you met Colin yet?
- Yes.

719
00:34:21,554 --> 00:34:25,067
- Isn't he dreamy?
- Absolutely.

720
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:29,089
Could someone please pass
me the Splendor?

721
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:32,195
Could someone who's
not a misogynist,

722
00:34:32,291 --> 00:34:34,248
please pass the Splenda?

723
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:38,100
- Hallo?
- Thank you, Stephanie.

724
00:34:38,196 --> 00:34:40,114
It's Colin, you guys.

725
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:45,188
Hi, babe.
Just a sec... Hi.

726
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:48,068
So cute.

727
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,461
We only have 9 days before
we leave for Scotland,

728
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,002
- so we have to act quickly.
- Exactly.

729
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:55,181
I've been a 'MOH' 6 times,
so I'll organize everything...

730
00:34:55,277 --> 00:34:56,941
that needs to be
done, even though

731
00:34:57,037 --> 00:34:58,701
I'm not officially
the 'MOH' here.

732
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,382
- What is a 'MOH'?
- M-O-H.

733
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,583
Maid Of Honor.

734
00:35:02,678 --> 00:35:04,742
- Yes.
- Oh, yes. That's clever.

735
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,310
No, it's going great.
Very smoothly.

736
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:12,223
So we got the bridal shower
bachelorette, dress fittings,

737
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,503
- The 'kilt'...
- I'll do the 'kilt'.

738
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,504
- Okay... perfect.
- Okay.

739
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,904
Shopping for Hannah's
true self...

740
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:18,372
- That's gonna be great.

741
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:20,255
So, what is
Hannah's true self?

742
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:23,286
It's lingerie. For her
wedding night.

743
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,757
How do you expect to be a good...

744
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:26,297
'MOH' if you don't
even know that.

745
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:28,856
- She's talking to me.
- No, I didn't..

746
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:31,945
- You just did.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Tom.

747
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,233
Did I break a rule?

748
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,464
How about we focus on the
wedding part?

749
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,625
- Good idea.
- Just for now...

750
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,186
Okay, I need, dress sizes.

751
00:35:39,282 --> 00:35:40,866
- I'm a four.
- Okay.

752
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:44,074
- Eight.
- Sorry?.

753
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:47,287
You know, Hillary...

754
00:35:47,383 --> 00:35:49,907
Do you think that maybe
you'd just be more...

755
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:52,530
- comfortable in
like a, twelve?

756
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,178
No, it will be fine.

757
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:55,771
- I'm doing the
Dr. Riverbed fast.

758
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:56,826
Oh, yeah.

759
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,307
- Yeah.
- What is that?

760
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:00,787
Water, peach raisin/apple
pectin /shark extract.

761
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:02,940
And Lowry's Seasoning Salt.

762
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,148
- What about food?
- Look.

763
00:36:05,244 --> 00:36:07,341
I'm going to look
amazing in that dress.

764
00:36:07,438 --> 00:36:09,588
I am going to meet a
Scottish man, and...

765
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:13,027
I'm gonna be happy.
Write down an eight.

766
00:36:13,123 --> 00:36:14,148
Got it.

767
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:16,468
What's your dress size,
Made Of Honor?

768
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:18,829
I don't know. What's your jock
size, Melissa?

769
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,843
That's enough. Enough.

770
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:24,309
Sorry. But will you guys
look at Hannah, please.

771
00:36:24,404 --> 00:36:26,324
She's happy, finally.

772
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,070
So please, for Hannah,
let's all just get along,

773
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,353
put a smile on our faces...

774
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:31,910
and pretend
everything's perfect.

775
00:36:32,006 --> 00:36:34,518
- Here she comes.
- Okay. Fine.

776
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:40,399
- What did he say?
- He's so sweet.

777
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,037
Isn't that great?

778
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,271
How's it going?

779
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:49,071
- Good, really good.
- Fantastic.

780
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:51,864
- And it's pretty much done.
- Perfect, really?

781
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,878
- Tom.
- Yes?

782
00:36:53,908 --> 00:36:55,961
- Here.
- What is this?

783
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:57,405
She does bridal
shower entertainment.

784
00:36:57,501 --> 00:36:58,992
And I hired her for
Stephanie's sisters shower,

785
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:00,900
and Hannah loved it.
She reads Tarot...

786
00:37:00,996 --> 00:37:01,712
cards and stuff.

787
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:03,193
That's great.
Thank you, Melissa.

788
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,314
I'm not doing it for you,
I'm doing it for Hannah.

789
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,473
Okay.
Thank you, for Hannah.

790
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:09,593
It should have been me...

791
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:10,594
- I'll talk with you tomorrow.
- Okay.

792
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:11,834
- Bye, Tom.
- Goodbye.

793
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,274
- Bye, Hillary.
- Nice meeting you.

794
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,274
You too, bye.

795
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,787
I just had a very nice
bonding moment with Melissa.

796
00:37:16,882 --> 00:37:18,634
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure.

797
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,434
My mother and grandmother are
coming in to town tomorrow.

798
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,795
And I have so much to plan...

799
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:24,740
I was wondering if you
and the boys could...

800
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:25,994
entertain Colin for the day.

801
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:26,647
- Entertain him?

802
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:28,396
Yeah, just kind of get
to know him and stuff.

803
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:30,409
- Sure.
- Cool.

804
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:35,196
So are you more proud of
'Scotch Tape' or McDonald's?

805
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:37,196
I think they're both American.

806
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:39,301
- So wait, you invited this
guy to play ball with us?

807
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:40,396
Yeah, he's the competition.

808
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:42,557
I need to get to know his
strengths and weaknesses.

809
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:43,859
I like his green shirts.

810
00:37:43,955 --> 00:37:45,996
Is that like a poly
blend kind of thing?

811
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:47,157
Yeah, it's my shirt...

812
00:37:47,253 --> 00:37:48,316
- It's your shirt?
- Yeah.

813
00:37:48,412 --> 00:37:49,836
- Looks good on him, huh?
- Yeah, real good.

814
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:51,951
Why don't you play with him?

815
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:53,518
Thanks.

816
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,398
Colin, have you ever played
basketball before?

817
00:37:55,494 --> 00:37:56,816
We would call this 'netball',

818
00:37:56,912 --> 00:37:59,037
back in Scotland, it's
more of a woman's game,

819
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:01,350
so, no I don't have much
experience.

820
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,919
- Hi, I do. Need one more?
- We're good.

821
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,679
Alright.

822
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:09,670
- Alright, 'girls', you ready?
- Yeah, I am.

823
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:10,999
Oh.
Use your hands.

824
00:38:11,095 --> 00:38:14,111
- You alright there?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

825
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:15,840
- I'm open. I'm open.
- Here we go.

826
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:18,520
You gotta hold on
to the ball, man.

827
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:20,073
Hold on to the ball.

828
00:38:20,169 --> 00:38:22,808
Homos. Homos.
Homos.

829
00:38:23,008 --> 00:38:24,760
Let's get the Scottish girl
out if the tree.

830
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:26,880
You wanna start a game cause
you didn't get that.

831
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,441
There you go.
Open. Open.

832
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:29,881
Here you go. That was good.
Good.

833
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,473
Good.
Amiga.

834
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:33,489
Shoot it. Guys.

835
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:36,201
- I like it.
- I'm sorry.

836
00:38:36,296 --> 00:38:38,890
- Come on.
- Get on the path.

837
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,482
You ok?

838
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:45,537
Ok, basket.

839
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:48,555
Put it in the basket.
Put it in the basket.

840
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:50,202
- You know what I'm learning?
The guy's a chump.

841
00:38:50,298 --> 00:38:51,763
Yeah.

842
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:54,383
- Wow, 'Fault'.
- There it is. That's it.

843
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:56,283
That's it. That's it.
We got it now.

844
00:38:56,379 --> 00:38:58,044
Hey, I look good now, don't I?

845
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,058
Here we go.

846
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,764
Put it in the basket.

847
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,878
- In the basket.
- Take a shot, chief.

848
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:13,124
- Sorry, guys.
- Did you see that?

849
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,204
Probably not allowed to just
stuff it in like that.

850
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,646
- He dunks the ball.
- Sorry. Sorry.

851
00:39:16,741 --> 00:39:18,814
He dunks the ball...

852
00:39:18,934 --> 00:39:21,258
That was awesome.
You can dunk.

853
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:23,525
He can dunk. That is awesome.

854
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:25,246
If that's allowed, why
don't you guys all do it?

855
00:39:25,342 --> 00:39:27,885
If we could, we would.
Right?

856
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:29,900
- Play?
- Guys.

857
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,575
- No.
- Yeah.

858
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:45,294
- Score.
- Yeah.

859
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:53,049
- Yes.
- Good game, yeah, good game.

860
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:54,450
My brother.

861
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:56,442
- Looks like you're
getting more competition..

862
00:39:56,538 --> 00:39:57,209
I know, I know...

863
00:39:57,305 --> 00:39:59,697
I love this guy.

864
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:15,779
Shit.

865
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:17,491
- You alright?
- Yeah.

866
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:19,505
What happening?

867
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:23,059
My boy's got mad cow disease.

868
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,211
We have got to get some dirt
on this guy.

869
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:28,071
I got a guy I use
when a spouse...

870
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:29,131
suspect infidelity.

871
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,921
Everybody's got
skeletons in the closet.

872
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:32,013
Nobody is squeaky-clean,

873
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:33,030
- and my guy's the best.

874
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:34,572
I don't know, it
just seems so cheap.

875
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:36,130
Don't worry, I'll
charge you double...

876
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:36,973
because you're rich.

877
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,492
I mean, it's a
cheap thing to do.

878
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:40,106
- He play's cheap,
you gotta match that.

879
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:41,173
How does Colin play cheep?

880
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,333
That whole thing with
Hannah, being Scottish.

881
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:45,293
Making her fall in love
with him in Scotland.

882
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:48,381
That 'monster thing' of his.

883
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,102
Fine.
Get the dirt.

884
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:56,414
That's cool.

885
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,016
Van Wyck Expressway
Kennedy Airport 1.5 mile

886
00:41:08,704 --> 00:41:10,905
What's he gonna do,
eat her?

887
00:41:11,743 --> 00:41:15,085
Come on, come on.
Take a breath. Take a...

888
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:22,183
Thanks, Tom.

889
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:26,380
- Yeah, have a great flight.
- Right. Thanks, mate.

890
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,905
Come on...

891
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:35,138
- I love you, Colin.
- Bye.

892
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:37,153
Bye.

893
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:44,507
- Yeah...
- My God.

894
00:41:44,787 --> 00:41:47,740
- Need some chap stick?
- Yeah...

895
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:49,619
So... What church should
we go to?

896
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,633
Grace's Church.

897
00:42:00,428 --> 00:42:02,700
Thank you so much for coming
with me to meet the reverend.

898
00:42:02,796 --> 00:42:04,860
- No problem.
- He is the sweetest man...

899
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:05,861
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

900
00:42:05,957 --> 00:42:07,810
He married my parents
and insisted...

901
00:42:07,906 --> 00:42:09,861
on coming to Scotland
to do my wedding.

902
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:11,941
Why didn't Colin stay and do
this with you?

903
00:42:12,037 --> 00:42:13,118
It was more important for him...

904
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:14,401
to go back to
Scotland to partition

905
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:15,357
The Grand Council...

906
00:42:15,453 --> 00:42:16,902
so Colin and I
could get married.

907
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:18,702
I don't know. Grand?
What does that mean?

908
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:21,079
I'm not Scottish
and his family...

909
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:22,134
is kind of...

910
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,022
What?

911
00:42:23,118 --> 00:42:24,775
Royalty.

912
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:26,575
Royalty?

913
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,909
- Royalty? Is he like a King?
- No.. No, he's a Duke.

914
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,470
A Duke?

915
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,393
- Hannah, darling.
- Reverend Foote.

916
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:45,925
And this must be the
lucky young man...

917
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,625
who is marrying our
beautiful Hannah.

918
00:42:47,721 --> 00:42:48,905
Oh, no.

919
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,224
- I'm not marrying him
- No...

920
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,848
This is Tom,
my 'Maid Of Honor'.

921
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:55,712
- Maid of Honor?
- Yes.

922
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:57,458
How about that...

923
00:42:57,554 --> 00:43:01,658
We have many gay and lesbian
members of the congregation.

924
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:03,672
Welcome.

925
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:14,686
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Reverend.

926
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:20,549
So...

927
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:22,184
- Let's talk
about the wedding.

928
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,488
Okay.

929
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:25,148
I need to get some details
about you and...

930
00:43:25,244 --> 00:43:27,161
- Colin.
- Colin, yes.

931
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:29,547
I want to work it
in to the ceremony.

932
00:43:29,643 --> 00:43:32,349
Okay. It was such a
whirl wind. Really...

933
00:43:32,445 --> 00:43:35,298
Yes, enlighten me.
Tell me about it.

934
00:43:37,037 --> 00:43:38,955
Hannah, darling.

935
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:40,455
Hannah, I think it's important...

936
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:41,909
to dig deep her
for the vows...

937
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:44,510
and tell the Reverend all
you know about Colin.

938
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:46,290
- All that you love about him.
- Okay.

939
00:43:46,386 --> 00:43:47,349
And not just the
obvious stuff,

940
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:49,296
but those unique
characteristics...

941
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:50,351
that are Colin.

942
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:54,910
Those things that make you
laugh and say...

943
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:56,925
'That's so Colin'.

944
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,792
Right...

945
00:43:59,888 --> 00:44:02,169
And then, maybe you
could get some...

946
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:03,792
information from Colin...

947
00:44:03,888 --> 00:44:06,196
and emphasize
their unique bond,

948
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:07,791
their shared history.

949
00:44:07,887 --> 00:44:09,806
Off course.

950
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,273
We could talk about
love at first sight.

951
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:15,313
Well, that's always a
crowd pleaser, but...

952
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:17,153
Hannah... Elaborate...

953
00:44:17,249 --> 00:44:20,999
Tell me more about him.
How you feel about him.

954
00:44:26,722 --> 00:44:28,074
Where did you meet?

955
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,534
- In Scotland...
- Modigliani.

956
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:31,944
Your first summer
in New York City,

957
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,634
you were dating a guy who
worked on Wall Street...

958
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,734
and he asked you to move in...

959
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,115
with him and you
weren't quite sure...

960
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:37,291
And it was right
around that time...

961
00:44:37,387 --> 00:44:38,435
that you 'discovered'
Modigliani...

962
00:44:38,531 --> 00:44:40,195
And became obsessed
with this painting...

963
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,754
of this woman who had this
blue scarf on, holding a baby.

964
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,602
And Hannah said: 'That...

965
00:44:44,698 --> 00:44:45,676
painting captured
the essence...

966
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:47,916
of that woman better
than any photograph'.

967
00:44:48,012 --> 00:44:50,116
I can't believe you
can remember that.

968
00:44:50,212 --> 00:44:51,252
I also remembered that she...

969
00:44:51,348 --> 00:44:52,876
freaked, because she
said she felt more...

970
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:54,274
passionate about that painting...

971
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,836
than she did but
'Mr. Wall Street'...

972
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:57,477
And she wondered if she could
ever meet somebody...

973
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,020
that could make her feel this...

974
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:00,517
passionate as
that work of art.

975
00:45:00,613 --> 00:45:02,531
That's good.

976
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:04,238
That's good.

977
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,077
Modigliani.

978
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:09,077
Now I know why you picked
him to be 'Maid of Honor'.

979
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,092
Yes...

980
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,587
Come on. Who's ready
to lose some...

981
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:16,398
money tonight. Because
I'm feeling lucky.

982
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:17,398
You guys are late.
How you doing?

983
00:45:17,494 --> 00:45:18,438
- How you holding up, champ?
- Stressed.

984
00:45:18,534 --> 00:45:20,452
What the hell is this?

985
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:22,070
- Hannah's shower's
in the morning.

986
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,040
Well where are we gonna play?

987
00:45:23,136 --> 00:45:24,879
We're not gonna play until
these baskets get done,

988
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:26,080
and everything else gets done.

989
00:45:26,176 --> 00:45:29,471
- What about this party mix?
- That's 'pot-pourri'.

990
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:30,879
This is perfect...

991
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:31,949
- Come on Felix,
take that off...

992
00:45:32,045 --> 00:45:32,959
Have you ever
had one of these?

993
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,520
- That's funny...
- You can't even see.

994
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:35,880
You'll have to,
to sleep with you...

995
00:45:35,976 --> 00:45:37,440
- Take this.
- You could be like blinded.

996
00:45:37,536 --> 00:45:40,178
No, I'm not playing
with baskets.

997
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:42,193
It's poker night.

998
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:45,160
You put 'Bayberry'
with 'Serenity'.

999
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:46,762
- You don't like?
- No, it's interesting.

1000
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:47,857
Just thought it
was obvious that...

1001
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,041
'Bayberry' worked
best with 'Harmony'.

1002
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:51,898
Really? I've been
putting 'Bayberry'...

1003
00:45:51,994 --> 00:45:53,674
with 'Tahitian Sunrise'.

1004
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,461
- That I like. That's Zen.
- Yeah.

1005
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:56,855
You know what I
like? I like how...

1006
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:58,482
you put the bat ball
right in the center.

1007
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:00,195
I like that so much
that I'm gonna...

1008
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,043
see you ball and raise
you another ball.

1009
00:46:02,138 --> 00:46:02,651
That's a good idea.

1010
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:03,763
We should definitely
have 2 balls...

1011
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:05,642
- Yeah. Do another ball.
- Hey, Dennis...

1012
00:46:05,738 --> 00:46:07,483
Come and curl some ribbon.

1013
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:09,495
I can feel my sperm
dying inside...

1014
00:46:09,591 --> 00:46:10,724
of me, one at a time.

1015
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,684
Shut up and grab a basket.
Come on, it's fun.

1016
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,844
I'm going to a strip club
to eat some meat.

1017
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,466
Then I'm gonna
get into a fight.

1018
00:46:17,532 --> 00:46:19,244
Call me when you find your
balls, Tom.

1019
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,204
Alright, tuff guy.

1020
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,441
Or maybe they're
in the basket,

1021
00:46:22,537 --> 00:46:24,677
next to the
'Tahitian Sunrise'.

1022
00:46:24,773 --> 00:46:27,276
Someone's afraid of his
feminine side...

1023
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:29,557
Look at that... Nice job
with the fluffing.

1024
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,685
Look at that.

1025
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,685
- Perfect. Perfect.
- What is that, my friends.

1026
00:46:32,781 --> 00:46:33,965
- Look at us.
- Come on.

1027
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:36,507
- Can't lose.
- Good work, huh?

1028
00:46:39,014 --> 00:46:41,867
Hello ladies.
You look lovely today.

1029
00:46:41,894 --> 00:46:43,486
- Tom.
- Oh, Hillary. How are you?

1030
00:46:43,582 --> 00:46:46,006
Good. Everything
looks wonderful.

1031
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:47,607
This is the best shower
I've ever been to.

1032
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:48,847
Really? You think so?

1033
00:46:48,943 --> 00:46:49,725
You know what, Hillary?

1034
00:46:49,821 --> 00:46:50,927
You should really
eat something.

1035
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:53,255
No, Tom. I'm fine.

1036
00:46:56,975 --> 00:46:58,687
Fine. I'm okay.

1037
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,029
What you ladies would go...

1038
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,560
through to fit
in to a dress...

1039
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,322
This pretty much blows
your rule out of...

1040
00:47:03,418 --> 00:47:05,288
the water about no women
allowed at your place.

1041
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:05,991
What good is a rule if you...

1042
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:06,809
don't break it
every now and then?

1043
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:09,288
I'm very, very impressed
Thank you.

1044
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:11,303
Listen to that.

1045
00:47:11,457 --> 00:47:14,554
Gay Gordon's party remix,
just for you.

1046
00:47:16,297 --> 00:47:17,870
Hear the horn.

1047
00:47:17,966 --> 00:47:19,369
- It's good isn't it?
- No.

1048
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:21,389
Let me turn it up there...
It's...

1049
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:22,969
- It's a little loud...
- What?

1050
00:47:23,065 --> 00:47:25,931
- It's a little loud.
- Okay. There you go.

1051
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:27,851
Look at this. Try this.
Haggis pink.

1052
00:47:27,947 --> 00:47:30,525
It's pepper, cheese,
chopped up baby...

1053
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:32,930
lamb lung, and cow
pituitary gland.

1054
00:47:33,026 --> 00:47:33,730
- How are you?
- ...

1055
00:47:33,826 --> 00:47:37,578
It's a Scottish delicacy.
Colin recommended it.

1056
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:41,012
Ladies, ladies.
Look...

1057
00:47:41,107 --> 00:47:43,459
What just came,
for Hannah.

1058
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,139
It's from Colin, everyone.

1059
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:50,893
Oh wait. There's a card.
There's a card, a card...

1060
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:52,906
For: 'Hannah'.

1061
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,662
'Hannah, my love, this
is the extremely...

1062
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:57,853
rare Scottish floral
bud thistle'.

1063
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:58,853
Thistle?

1064
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:01,933
'They only bloom for 4 hours
before they die'.

1065
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:04,893
He must have timed this out
perfectly...

1066
00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:06,262
Oh my gosh, when we first met,

1067
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:07,894
Colin promised that
he would roam...

1068
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,445
at the countryside to
find me one, and he did.

1069
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:13,830
Sweetheart, that's
the most romantic...

1070
00:48:13,926 --> 00:48:15,015
thing I ever heard.

1071
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:16,295
Thanks mom.

1072
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,295
Joan, good to see you.
It's been too long.

1073
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:20,174
Easter, wasn't it?

1074
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:23,215
Yes. You slept with our maid.

1075
00:48:23,311 --> 00:48:23,837
She told you?

1076
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,296
I didn't know she
spoke English.

1077
00:48:25,392 --> 00:48:26,336
Yes...

1078
00:48:26,432 --> 00:48:28,375
This is grandma Pearl.
You remember Tom?

1079
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:32,184
- How are you?
- Oh, yes, the fornicator.

1080
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:35,088
That's right.

1081
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:38,017
- Okay...
- Tom, this is awesome.

1082
00:48:38,113 --> 00:48:39,937
- It's great.
- Good. Thank you.

1083
00:48:40,032 --> 00:48:41,577
This is even better than
my sister's shower.

1084
00:48:41,673 --> 00:48:42,777
- Oh, really?
- Ahem...

1085
00:48:42,873 --> 00:48:43,897
Everything seems to
be doing well. Yes?

1086
00:48:43,993 --> 00:48:45,417
Sharon would like to know
where to set up.

1087
00:48:45,513 --> 00:48:47,617
- Who?
- The entertainment...

1088
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:51,953
Ah, yes... I mean good.
She should set up over there.

1089
00:48:52,026 --> 00:48:54,553
Hello everybody.
Hi, I'm Sharon.

1090
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,098
Good to see you all.

1091
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:58,370
Yeah, come on, right
down the front.

1092
00:48:58,466 --> 00:49:00,219
This was my idea, you know?

1093
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:01,512
I know how much
you loved her from

1094
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:02,659
Stephanie's sister's shower...

1095
00:49:02,755 --> 00:49:04,035
Before we start, I
would like for us...

1096
00:49:04,131 --> 00:49:05,139
all to take in
a deep breath...

1097
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:07,436
She wasn't at the shower...

1098
00:49:07,747 --> 00:49:08,900
- She wasn't?
- No.

1099
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:10,100
- And now exhale slowly...
- Really?

1100
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:11,579
Good job.

1101
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:14,460
It's very important to
reset our third eye.

1102
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:15,834
And connect to...

1103
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:18,376
the primal inside
of ourselves.

1104
00:49:18,397 --> 00:49:20,460
Before I present the
pleasure aids.

1105
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:21,941
Pleasure aids?

1106
00:49:22,037 --> 00:49:23,260
Now...

1107
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:26,292
These pleasures are
best used when...

1108
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,462
in tantric meditative state.

1109
00:49:28,558 --> 00:49:31,083
And today, I'm going
to show you ladies...

1110
00:49:31,178 --> 00:49:33,582
how to reach your
optimal sacred Chakra.

1111
00:49:33,677 --> 00:49:35,901
All of these aids are
for sale, ladies.

1112
00:49:35,997 --> 00:49:40,222
And look what we have here...
Edible panties.

1113
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:42,534
You look hungry.
Try to snack on these.

1114
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,548
There you go.

1115
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,143
Now ladies, what pleasure...

1116
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,135
party would be
complete without...

1117
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:50,464
Glow-in-the-dark
thunder beads?

1118
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,303
These are terrific.
And for you ladies, today...

1119
00:49:52,399 --> 00:49:53,775
Two for one.

1120
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:55,203
Okay?

1121
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:58,536
There you go.
Wanna try this out, princess?

1122
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:00,592
Where do these go?

1123
00:50:03,153 --> 00:50:05,767
From casual writing
to evening wear.

1124
00:50:05,863 --> 00:50:06,804
Gorgeous.

1125
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,937
Why don't you keep those?

1126
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,197
And they match your
ear rings.

1127
00:50:22,513 --> 00:50:24,432
Hannah, are you okay?

1128
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,107
You know that I've dreamt
of my wedding shower,

1129
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:29,707
ever since I was
10 years old?

1130
00:50:29,803 --> 00:50:30,707
No...

1131
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:32,085
Strangely enough, the image...

1132
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:33,508
of my grand mom,
pearl drape...

1133
00:50:33,604 --> 00:50:34,836
and glow-in-the-dark
thunder beads...

1134
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:35,507
wasn't part of it.

1135
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:37,521
It's not funny, Tom.

1136
00:50:38,556 --> 00:50:41,820
Do you have any idea how
important this is to me?

1137
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:45,666
The Gay Gordon, pink Haggis,
Dildo-sales woman?

1138
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:48,028
Just understand something,
Melissa set me up.

1139
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:51,712
Oh please. There's always
an excuse with you.

1140
00:50:51,837 --> 00:50:53,047
I never even should have asked...

1141
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:54,390
you to do this in
the first place.

1142
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:55,476
You don't even
believe in marriage...

1143
00:50:55,572 --> 00:50:56,030
for Christ sake...

1144
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:58,044
You know, I might.

1145
00:51:00,797 --> 00:51:02,717
I gotta get back.

1146
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:16,391
Melissa's pretty good.

1147
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:18,031
Look, the whole
goal here was to...

1148
00:51:18,127 --> 00:51:19,671
convince Hannah
that I've grown up,

1149
00:51:19,767 --> 00:51:22,344
and that she doesn't know
anything about Colin...

1150
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:24,885
That I'm the right
man for her.

1151
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,919
That did not happen.

1152
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,863
Stella. No, baby.
Don't eat buttons, okay?

1153
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,665
Yeah, but your still
the Maid of Honor, right Tom?

1154
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:35,353
I don't know. I think she
might have fired me.

1155
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:36,136
How does somebody...

1156
00:51:36,232 --> 00:51:37,472
get fired from
being Maid of Honor?

1157
00:51:37,568 --> 00:51:38,873
Tell me about it.

1158
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:40,768
- You know what?
I got an idea.

1159
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:41,114
Okay.

1160
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,994
To prove to Hannah that
you're the only man for her,

1161
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,074
we have to make you the best
Made of Honor, ever.

1162
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,546
Right.

1163
00:51:46,642 --> 00:51:48,176
- I'm out of loss.
Completely stunned.

1164
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:48,473
Great.

1165
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:49,874
My guy couldn't find any
dirt on Colin.

1166
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:51,835
This has never happened.
This guy's clean.

1167
00:51:51,931 --> 00:51:52,675
Glad that happened to me.

1168
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,354
You know, he's got
3 Guinness world records?

1169
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:54,703
- Cool.

1170
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:55,994
We don't need to know that...

1171
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:57,794
He's actually got
a Medal of Honor.

1172
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,641
That's funny, because we
got the Made of Honor.

1173
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:04,156
Let's stay focused.

1174
00:52:04,252 --> 00:52:05,791
Look, the point is,
we're not gonna...

1175
00:52:05,887 --> 00:52:06,715
get her off this guy.

1176
00:52:06,811 --> 00:52:08,876
Yeah, so we need to make
this not about Colin.

1177
00:52:08,972 --> 00:52:10,276
Yeah, we need to
make it about you.

1178
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:11,636
- Good...
- You gotta show her

1179
00:52:11,732 --> 00:52:13,156
That you're growing up...
- Finally...

1180
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:15,076
I am changing.
I am growing up.

1181
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:17,021
- Good.. Then this
should be easy for you.

1182
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:17,430
Great...

1183
00:52:17,526 --> 00:52:19,294
These are bridal
magazines from...

1184
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,677
18 different countries...

1185
00:52:20,773 --> 00:52:22,000
each with a feature article on...

1186
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,517
the duties of being
the Maid of Honor.

1187
00:52:23,613 --> 00:52:25,357
Perfect.'Über Bride'...

1188
00:52:25,452 --> 00:52:27,330
I got these guys in
Bangalore that we're...

1189
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:29,438
outsource to, they
translated them over night.

1190
00:52:29,534 --> 00:52:29,931
- Great.

1191
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:31,759
Nice 'appetizers'
there, Gary...

1192
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:33,478
- Here's the 'Main course'
- What have you got for me?

1193
00:52:33,574 --> 00:52:35,291
My wife Deb is a
A-type personality,

1194
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:36,959
she has to do
everything perfect.

1195
00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:38,118
- Sure...
- Love her...

1196
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:39,119
- Hate that about her.
- Right.

1197
00:52:39,214 --> 00:52:40,546
Anyway, she rented this when...

1198
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:42,239
she was gonna be
the Maid Of Honor...

1199
00:52:42,335 --> 00:52:44,019
for her yoga teacher.

1200
00:52:44,115 --> 00:52:47,621
This is 'the goods'.
You're gonna be wow-ed.

1201
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:50,325
12 Steps Down The Aisle

1202
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:57,521
Hi, I'm Elisabeth Hasselbeck
and I'm just so thrilled...

1203
00:52:57,617 --> 00:52:59,041
you've purchased this program.

1204
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:00,040
And I'm proud of you...

1205
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:02,320
Because it shows that
you're not happy being just...

1206
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,162
an ordinary friend
and loved one.

1207
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:06,888
No. You and I are
gonna work together...

1208
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:09,481
to make you the
perfect Maid of Honor.

1209
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:10,828
When we're through,
you'll know...

1210
00:53:10,924 --> 00:53:12,482
everything there is to
know about dresses.

1211
00:53:12,578 --> 00:53:15,962
Crockery, nuptial etiquette
and pleasing your bride.

1212
00:53:16,058 --> 00:53:18,323
What's the length...
of the bridesmaid dress?

1213
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:19,483
No longer than the brides.

1214
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:20,500
What if you know someone...

1215
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:21,842
won't be able to
attend the wedding?

1216
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:23,515
You got to send an
invitation anyway.

1217
00:53:23,611 --> 00:53:25,529
Receiving line?

1218
00:53:25,611 --> 00:53:27,529
Receiving line?

1219
00:53:27,611 --> 00:53:29,159
If there's a receiving
line, it means I've failed,

1220
00:53:29,255 --> 00:53:30,004
because Hannah's married.

1221
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,075
Right. It was a
trick question.

1222
00:53:32,172 --> 00:53:34,044
Who was the runner
up MVP in 1974?

1223
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,764
No, these questions all have
to do with Tom...

1224
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,724
being the best Maid Of Honor
he can be.

1225
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,084
Alright.

1226
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,957
I thought we were just
asking like... Questions.

1227
00:53:42,053 --> 00:53:43,558
Go sit down.

1228
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,365
Basic duties of the
Maid of Honor?

1229
00:53:45,461 --> 00:53:46,493
Manage the bridesmaids,

1230
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:48,325
carry the ring, and
support the bride.

1231
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,605
Basic duties as You as
the Maid of Honor?

1232
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:51,760
Show Hannah that I've matured,

1233
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:53,726
that I can take care of my
responsibilities fully...

1234
00:53:53,822 --> 00:53:55,606
and that I need to destroy
the wedding from within.

1235
00:53:55,702 --> 00:53:57,743
- What happens if you
fail at that task?

1236
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:58,798
Colin gets her.

1237
00:53:58,894 --> 00:54:01,127
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride.

1238
00:54:01,223 --> 00:54:02,886
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride.

1239
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:05,207
- What are we gonna do?
- Steal the bride.

1240
00:54:05,303 --> 00:54:07,221
Steal the bride.

1241
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:08,726
And remember...

1242
00:54:08,822 --> 00:54:10,486
Weather it is helping
with the seating chart...

1243
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:11,807
or giving your
opinion on the cake,

1244
00:54:11,903 --> 00:54:13,909
the perfect Maid Of Honor is...

1245
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:16,407
with her bride every
step of the way.

1246
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:18,768
You didn't have to clear your
whole day to do all this.

1247
00:54:18,863 --> 00:54:20,369
Are you kidding?
Off course I did.

1248
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,740
The perfect Maid of Honor is...

1249
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:23,369
with his bride every
step of the way.

1250
00:54:23,465 --> 00:54:25,200
A changed man...

1251
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:27,214
I am indeed.

1252
00:54:27,736 --> 00:54:29,569
I don't even know
where to begin.

1253
00:54:29,665 --> 00:54:30,890
When choosing a china
pattern,

1254
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:33,476
you need to think
about what type...

1255
00:54:33,572 --> 00:54:37,401
of entertaining you're open
to, foods you wanna cook...

1256
00:54:37,497 --> 00:54:41,170
Look. Now don't be afraid
to mix and mash.

1257
00:54:41,266 --> 00:54:43,770
It's important, even with
different styles and textures.

1258
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:46,250
What you wanna do, is stir
up the table.

1259
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:50,331
Make it come alive with color
and tenacity. That's the goal.

1260
00:54:50,427 --> 00:54:54,177
Also, at the end of the day...
You will find...

1261
00:54:55,299 --> 00:54:57,218
...Connections.

1262
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:59,338
Thank you very much.

1263
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:01,852
Let's go.

1264
00:55:01,947 --> 00:55:03,068
If you think I'm
good with plates,

1265
00:55:03,164 --> 00:55:04,492
wait till you see what
I do with linens.

1266
00:55:04,587 --> 00:55:06,493
- Lingerie, perfect.
- What about the linens?

1267
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:07,370
You'll be able to pick out...

1268
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:08,333
something for the
wedding night.

1269
00:55:08,429 --> 00:55:09,388
- No.

1270
00:55:09,484 --> 00:55:12,092
Are you crazy? You're the
perfect person for this job.

1271
00:55:12,188 --> 00:55:14,725
Who's taken off more lingerie
than you?

1272
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,920
let's put your 'whore-ing'
to good use.

1273
00:55:18,062 --> 00:55:19,980
Good point.

1274
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:24,094
So how did it go with the
Scottish Grand Council?

1275
00:55:24,189 --> 00:55:27,734
Great. Colin got them to
approve everything.

1276
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,748
Great.

1277
00:55:31,103 --> 00:55:32,741
So, I gotta tell you...

1278
00:55:32,836 --> 00:55:35,208
This is gonna
sound funny, but...

1279
00:55:35,304 --> 00:55:37,994
- I have to thank you.
- For what?

1280
00:55:38,623 --> 00:55:40,727
For asking me to be your
Maid of Honor.

1281
00:55:40,823 --> 00:55:44,004
I know this is gonna
sound crazy, but...

1282
00:55:44,185 --> 00:55:47,896
You've really opened my eyes,
to the whole idea of marriage.

1283
00:55:47,992 --> 00:55:50,763
- Yeah, right...
- No, seriously...

1284
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:54,578
- Have you met someone, Tom?
- No.

1285
00:55:54,674 --> 00:55:56,956
Then how can you be serious?

1286
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,943
I don't know, I just...

1287
00:56:05,225 --> 00:56:07,144
I don't know.

1288
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:26,212
What do you think?

1289
00:56:26,308 --> 00:56:28,346
Think Colin will like it?

1290
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:32,741
No... no.

1291
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:34,754
- What?
- It's just...

1292
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:37,693
It's cute.

1293
00:56:37,788 --> 00:56:41,061
'Cute'? I do not wanna look
'cute' on my wedding night.

1294
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:42,701
Just put this on.
Cover yourself up.

1295
00:56:42,797 --> 00:56:44,222
That's my coat.

1296
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,763
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Yeah.

1297
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,686
Here let me get you
in a cab. Come on.

1298
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:56,215
I can't believe this is my
last day in New York.

1299
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:58,512
What are you talking about?

1300
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,375
I've been meaning
to tell you, Tom.

1301
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:04,894
When I leave tomorrow,
I'm not coming back.

1302
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,176
I've decided to move to
Scotland, to be with Colin.

1303
00:57:09,272 --> 00:57:11,962
- You're leaving New York?
- I am.

1304
00:57:13,512 --> 00:57:15,744
It's exciting, you know?
It makes sense.

1305
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,257
He's next in line to take
over the family business...

1306
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,391
It's a whole new chapter.

1307
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:27,510
- You were amazing
today, you know that?

1308
00:57:27,606 --> 00:57:28,565
Oh, yeah?

1309
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:31,345
Yeah. I had no idea you could
juggle like that.

1310
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:33,466
- Yeah, well...
- I mean, women yes, china no.

1311
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:36,741
- Yeah, I know.
- You're always amazing.

1312
00:57:38,675 --> 00:57:40,592
Come here.

1313
00:57:46,356 --> 00:57:49,091
- See you in
Scotland soon, okay?

1314
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:51,246
Yeah, see you over there.

1315
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:54,993
I'll miss you.

1316
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:04,914
Scotland...

1317
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,076
Come, baby.

1318
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:21,110
He likes you.

1319
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,124
- Hi.
- Hey.

1320
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:24,958
- Nice dogs.

1321
00:58:25,054 --> 00:58:26,751
This is Hamish and
this is Callum.

1322
00:58:26,847 --> 00:58:28,879
- Callum?
- Yeah.

1323
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,270
What kind of dog is that?

1324
00:58:31,366 --> 00:58:33,732
- He's a Scottie.
- A Scottie?

1325
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,279
That's perfect.
Fuckin Scottie...

1326
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:49,905
I've never felt
like this before.

1327
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:51,152
So hopeless.

1328
00:58:51,248 --> 00:58:52,798
So, tell me again, why you...

1329
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:54,553
agreed to be the
Maid of Honor?

1330
00:58:54,649 --> 00:58:56,782
To be with her,
make her happy.

1331
00:58:56,877 --> 00:58:59,786
Figure out some way to
get her off of him.

1332
00:58:59,882 --> 00:59:01,586
Maybe that was all
wrong. Maybe he's...

1333
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:02,667
better for her than me.

1334
00:59:02,763 --> 00:59:04,786
He's Scottish, he can dunk,
he's perfect.

1335
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:06,962
Nobody's perfect.
But I tell you,

1336
00:59:07,058 --> 00:59:09,073
this whiskey comes
damn close...

1337
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,988
It was a gift from Colin.
He made it.

1338
00:59:12,084 --> 00:59:14,002
Swell.

1339
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:18,074
I can't go. I can't watch
Hannah marry this guy.

1340
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:20,628
She's moving to Scotland,
I've lost her already.

1341
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:21,684
- Crap.

1342
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,348
'...Love something,
set it free'.

1343
00:59:23,444 --> 00:59:27,194
Said by a pussy and used
by pussies ever since.

1344
00:59:28,204 --> 00:59:30,142
- Casablanca.'Bogie'
put's her on a plane.

1345
00:59:30,238 --> 00:59:31,197
Pussy.

1346
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:33,820
- 'Bogie’s a pussy?
- Big pussy.

1347
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:37,509
You know, I've only
truly been in love once.

1348
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:39,899
Most amazing woman
in the world.

1349
00:59:39,995 --> 00:59:41,630
She was my best friend.

1350
00:59:41,726 --> 00:59:45,446
But I was young, stupid,
and I messed it up.

1351
00:59:46,046 --> 00:59:49,079
In my great list of mistakes,
that was the greatest.

1352
00:59:49,175 --> 00:59:51,607
- Who was this?
- Your mother.

1353
00:59:53,286 --> 00:59:55,436
When I finally
found out how stupid

1354
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:57,871
I was and I decided
to fight for it...

1355
00:59:57,967 --> 00:59:59,886
I was too late.

1356
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,007
She wouldn't take me back.

1357
01:00:03,368 --> 01:00:05,286
She was right.

1358
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:09,175
And then it really
was too late.

1359
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:20,249
By the way...
I'm getting another divorce.

1360
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:26,368
Dad...

1361
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,329
Hey... Go and get her,
you pussy.

1362
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:37,495
- What about the dresses?

1363
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:39,203
UPS are delivering
them tomorrow morning.

1364
01:00:39,299 --> 01:00:42,152
- I gave you the
tracking address...

1365
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,275
I got it.

1366
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:46,323
So, Colin and Hannah are gonna
meet everyone at the house...

1367
01:00:46,419 --> 01:00:48,338
- Okay.
- Great.

1368
01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:49,924
- Thomas.
- Yeah?

1369
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,404
Go get 'em, Maid of Honor.

1370
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,459
- Yeah.

1371
01:00:52,554 --> 01:00:54,679
Make this the perfect wedding.

1372
01:00:54,774 --> 01:00:57,984
- And steal the bride.
- Thanks, guys. Thanks.

1373
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,325
Thanks for everything, man.
Thank you so much, alright?

1374
01:01:00,421 --> 01:01:01,380
- Alright, baby.

1375
01:01:01,476 --> 01:01:03,676
Alright. Alright,
alright. Get out of here.

1376
01:01:03,772 --> 01:01:05,691
I'll see you later.

1377
01:01:12,654 --> 01:01:16,847
- This is like a fairy tale.
- Hannah is SO lucky.

1378
01:01:16,943 --> 01:01:18,927
- I know.
- I wish I was her.

1379
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:21,203
- How has she ever
found such a great guy?

1380
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:22,365
We'll come visit her.

1381
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,909
- I know...
- Look at the time.

1382
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:54,095
What's your name?

1383
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:56,898
You're a pretty dog.
I love you.

1384
01:02:04,339 --> 01:02:05,432
- That's his house?

1385
01:02:05,528 --> 01:02:07,403
No, isn't this
the summer house?

1386
01:02:07,499 --> 01:02:09,398
The McMurray's have
homes for each...

1387
01:02:09,494 --> 01:02:11,764
season. This summer
home, is their smallest.

1388
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,332
They also have an Autumn home,
a Winter home, a Spring...

1389
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:16,172
I know the seasons,
thanks, buddy.

1390
01:02:16,267 --> 01:02:17,572
Somebody's richer
thank you, Tom.

1391
01:02:17,668 --> 01:02:20,104
I guess you are gonna have to...

1392
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,727
invent something
even stupider.

1393
01:02:41,582 --> 01:02:43,500
Oh, my God.

1394
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,480
The entire castle
was actually build...

1395
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:52,535
in 1220...

1396
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:55,260
- This is
incredible, isn't it?

1397
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:57,128
Yes...Wow...

1398
01:02:57,224 --> 01:02:59,594
Grandma Pearl, Joan, this is...

1399
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:02,870
my mother, Diedre
and my father, Mungo.

1400
01:03:05,024 --> 01:03:06,617
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1401
01:03:06,712 --> 01:03:07,064
- How do you do?

1402
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:07,937
Nice to meet you,
Joan. Pleasure.

1403
01:03:08,033 --> 01:03:09,457
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

1404
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:10,926
Everyone, I want you
to meet someone...

1405
01:03:11,022 --> 01:03:12,177
who is so special
to my Hannah...

1406
01:03:12,272 --> 01:03:14,965
and who has been her
life-long friend,

1407
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:17,249
and now her Maid
of Honor, Tom.

1408
01:03:17,345 --> 01:03:18,304
- Hi, how is...

1409
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,737
Did he just say he's
the Maid of Honor...

1410
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:21,817
He's a bloke?.

1411
01:03:21,913 --> 01:03:23,569
- How do you do?
- Very good, thank you.

1412
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:25,139
- Mungo.
- Mungo, pleasure. Thank you.

1413
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:27,339
Definitely gay.

1414
01:03:27,435 --> 01:03:29,775
And these are the bridesmaids.

1415
01:03:29,871 --> 01:03:32,317
Hillary, Stephanie
and Melissa.

1416
01:03:32,387 --> 01:03:33,898
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1417
01:03:33,994 --> 01:03:34,954
- Hi.

1418
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:38,052
Nice that you could
come. How do you do?

1419
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,066
How do you do?

1420
01:03:41,588 --> 01:03:45,452
- So... what do you think?
- I think, they think I'm gay.

1421
01:03:45,548 --> 01:03:47,660
Look can we get together,
talk, catch up?

1422
01:03:47,756 --> 01:03:49,595
- Tom, do wanna
see your chamber?

1423
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:50,100
Love to.

1424
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:52,560
- Okay, follow me
- Thank you.

1425
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,788
Thank you.

1426
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,948
Thank you.

1427
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,632
Now then... I think
just a few more...

1428
01:04:09,728 --> 01:04:12,455
sprigs of jipsoffle
at the front there...

1429
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:14,469
Lovely.

1430
01:04:14,671 --> 01:04:17,703
- What do you guys think?
- Oh.. It is gorgeous...

1431
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:19,522
- It is so pretty...
With the veil...

1432
01:04:19,618 --> 01:04:20,863
So shiny, and the volume...

1433
01:04:20,959 --> 01:04:22,997
Tom... What do you think?

1434
01:04:23,631 --> 01:04:28,072
Of...?
The hair. Yeah, it...

1435
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:31,313
This sash will
go on the dress.

1436
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:34,632
- Really?
- Tradition.

1437
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:38,465
What's up with that?

1438
01:04:38,561 --> 01:04:39,625
Well...

1439
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:42,546
I'm not.. entirely sure...

1440
01:04:42,642 --> 01:04:45,057
Oh no, you see...
It's attached up here...

1441
01:04:45,153 --> 01:04:46,601
Tom, you're the Maid of Honor,

1442
01:04:46,697 --> 01:04:48,345
it's good to just
be supportive...

1443
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,266
- I'm supportive.
- I don't think you are.

1444
01:04:50,362 --> 01:04:51,666
- No, I am.
- Listen to me...

1445
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,938
You're doing good,
you're good...

1446
01:04:54,034 --> 01:04:55,659
Hannah...

1447
01:04:55,754 --> 01:04:59,395
Actually, your hair...
Looks amazing.

1448
01:04:59,715 --> 01:05:01,633
- Really?
- Yes.

1449
01:05:02,716 --> 01:05:04,478
The games will be
starting soon.

1450
01:05:04,574 --> 01:05:05,827
Here are your costumes.

1451
01:05:05,923 --> 01:05:08,027
- Games?
- Costumes.

1452
01:05:08,123 --> 01:05:10,268
- Our costumes?
- What do you mean, games?

1453
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,667
The Highland games.

1454
01:05:11,763 --> 01:05:14,349
It's a tradition,
in honor of the wedding.

1455
01:05:14,445 --> 01:05:16,788
It goes right back to the time
when the groom had to prove...

1456
01:05:16,884 --> 01:05:19,169
that he was man enough to
deserve the bride.

1457
01:05:19,265 --> 01:05:22,301
If he didn't win, he
didn't get the bride.

1458
01:05:22,397 --> 01:05:24,516
No problem for my Colin...

1459
01:05:29,118 --> 01:05:32,542
Welcome, one and all
to the Highland Games.

1460
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:34,363
Men have travelled
from all four...

1461
01:05:34,459 --> 01:05:35,849
corners of this
great country...

1462
01:05:35,945 --> 01:05:38,771
to compete in feats of
strength and agility.

1463
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:43,595
But only one warrior will be
man enough to claim the bride.

1464
01:05:45,198 --> 01:05:47,902
One warrior that needs
no introduction...

1465
01:05:47,998 --> 01:05:50,031
is our very own
Colin McMurray.

1466
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:52,391
- Isn't Colin handsome?
- And coming up,

1467
01:05:52,487 --> 01:05:55,230
here, all the
way from America.

1468
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,800
Hannah's Maid of Honor, Tom.

1469
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,085
Who I think you can all agree,

1470
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:04,065
is wearing a rather
fetching mini-kilt.

1471
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:07,830
- Who was in charge of that?
- I have no idea.

1472
01:06:29,523 --> 01:06:31,915
They're really
giving their all.

1473
01:06:32,011 --> 01:06:35,104
And we're running
neck and neck...

1474
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,924
A Scottish man against a Yank.

1475
01:06:38,563 --> 01:06:40,189
Ladies and gentlemen,

1476
01:06:40,285 --> 01:06:42,840
the result of today's
Highland Games...

1477
01:06:42,936 --> 01:06:44,757
rests upon the 'Cable Toss'.

1478
01:06:44,853 --> 01:06:47,696
The competition is down to
2 competitors.

1479
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:50,238
A tree...
We're tossing a tree?

1480
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:55,803
What a toss.

1481
01:06:56,886 --> 01:06:58,804
Way to go, Colin.

1482
01:06:58,813 --> 01:07:02,075
Okay, Tom. Let's see
what you're made of.

1483
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:05,399
The whole competition rests
on this throw.

1484
01:07:05,495 --> 01:07:08,278
Look at that Yankee..

1485
01:07:08,374 --> 01:07:10,292
Alright. Okay..

1486
01:07:11,847 --> 01:07:14,487
Come on, Tom.
Oh gosh...

1487
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:17,200
Okay. I can do this.
I can do this. Okay.

1488
01:07:17,295 --> 01:07:19,213
Here we go. Great.

1489
01:07:19,648 --> 01:07:21,567
Okay. Okay.

1490
01:07:22,488 --> 01:07:23,640
Here we go. Here we go.

1491
01:07:23,736 --> 01:07:25,654
Here we go, Oh...

1492
01:07:26,728 --> 01:07:28,647
Watch out, watch out.

1493
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:47,529
That's gonna cost the Yank
the gold medal.

1494
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,090
- What an ass.

1495
01:07:50,186 --> 01:07:52,883
And the winner of the
Highland Games is,

1496
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:55,611
our very own Colin McMurray.

1497
01:08:06,092 --> 01:08:08,011
That's great.

1498
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:12,644
*For my love is
like a melody*...

1499
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:15,564
*That sweetly
played in June*...

1500
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:19,646
*As fair art thou,
my bonny lass*...

1501
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:22,925
*say deep in love am I*...

1502
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:28,586
*And I will love thee
still, my dear*...

1503
01:08:28,682 --> 01:08:32,175
*till all the
seas gang dry*...

1504
01:08:33,374 --> 01:08:38,534
*And I will love thee still,
My dear*...

1505
01:08:38,775 --> 01:08:43,976
*Though t'were 10
thousand miles*.

1506
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:48,848
Well done, My boy.

1507
01:08:48,944 --> 01:08:50,862
Well done.

1508
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:54,240
That was so....

1509
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:56,255
Well done, my boy.

1510
01:09:04,138 --> 01:09:06,862
Robert Burns, who
wrote that song,

1511
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:09,485
is Scotland's
most famous poet.

1512
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:14,038
No, no, Auntie. We haven't
had any 'bairns' yet,

1513
01:09:14,134 --> 01:09:15,570
so we haven't got
any names yet.

1514
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,130
'Bairns' means children.

1515
01:09:17,226 --> 01:09:18,966
I'm so sorry, I'm
having a hard...

1516
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:20,643
time understanding
your accent.

1517
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,819
- 'Ethel'.
- Excuse me?

1518
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:25,532
It's a name, for the children.

1519
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,579
- 'Ethel'.
- 'Ethel'...

1520
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:30,538
Little Ethel.

1521
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:35,180
Yeah. We won't be naming our
child Ethel.

1522
01:09:35,821 --> 01:09:37,684
Maybe if he was a teenager...

1523
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,892
My mother's third cousin was
the Duke of Ethel.

1524
01:09:39,988 --> 01:09:42,662
We're a long line
of 'Ethel’s'.

1525
01:09:43,502 --> 01:09:45,635
Maybe... Maybe we'll keep...

1526
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:48,992
it in the mix, maybe
as a middle name...

1527
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:02,701
- So, Hannah, do you
like the venison?

1528
01:10:02,797 --> 01:10:03,967
It's delicious.

1529
01:10:04,063 --> 01:10:07,015
Colin shot it.
He's a wonderful Shot.

1530
01:10:07,111 --> 01:10:09,016
- Stop, mum. You'll
make me blush.

1531
01:10:09,112 --> 01:10:11,648
And this is the moment.
I've just remembered.

1532
01:10:11,744 --> 01:10:14,775
- What moment is that?
- When Colin killed the deer.

1533
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:16,789
I filmed it.

1534
01:10:19,665 --> 01:10:21,865
Right between the eyes.

1535
01:10:23,984 --> 01:10:26,739
In fact, everything
we are eating...

1536
01:10:26,835 --> 01:10:29,363
this evening,
Colin has killed.

1537
01:10:29,785 --> 01:10:31,370
- To Colin.
- To Colin.

1538
01:10:31,466 --> 01:10:33,384
In your honor, Hannah.

1539
01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:35,982
That is so thoughtful...

1540
01:10:36,225 --> 01:10:39,976
I'm so sorry, I didn't kill
anything for you...

1541
01:10:45,946 --> 01:10:48,279
Gosh...
What did you get?

1542
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,819
- Uhm...
- I love chocolate.

1543
01:10:50,915 --> 01:10:53,186
Don't... Don't do that.

1544
01:10:53,947 --> 01:10:55,866
You want some...

1545
01:10:57,228 --> 01:10:59,266
Here. I'll give you some.

1546
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:11,949
Excuse me.
Reverend...

1547
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:17,741
Excuse me, sir. There you go.
Wonderful dinner, by the way.

1548
01:11:17,837 --> 01:11:19,723
- Delighted, Tom.
- And your wife is beautiful.

1549
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:21,736
Thank you very much.

1550
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,148
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

1551
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:28,001
A little birdie tells me
that Colin personally...

1552
01:11:28,097 --> 01:11:30,054
slayed each one of
these reindeer heads...

1553
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,069
- Tom...
- Alright.

1554
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,703
I say 'a little
birdie told me'.

1555
01:11:33,799 --> 01:11:35,895
He would have told
me, but Colin shot it.

1556
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:37,909
Listen, seriously...

1557
01:11:38,031 --> 01:11:41,495
Can we go somewhere private
and talk? It's important.

1558
01:11:41,591 --> 01:11:44,433
- Yeah.
- Should we go?

1559
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:49,710
Bagpipes...

1560
01:11:50,792 --> 01:11:52,984
Oh, My God...

1561
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,021
He's been playing the
bag pipes ever since...

1562
01:11:56,117 --> 01:11:58,858
he was 3 years old.
Practices every night.

1563
01:11:58,953 --> 01:12:01,433
- Every night?
- Never misses.

1564
01:12:04,674 --> 01:12:07,308
- What kind of
necklace is that?

1565
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:10,625
They're glow-in-the-dark
thunder beets.

1566
01:12:22,156 --> 01:12:25,396
- Hi, mom.
- I have something for you.

1567
01:12:28,716 --> 01:12:31,676
- Some evening, huh?
- Yes...

1568
01:12:33,797 --> 01:12:35,670
This is so you can
have a little...

1569
01:12:35,766 --> 01:12:36,981
piece of home with you.

1570
01:12:37,077 --> 01:12:38,995
Thank you.

1571
01:12:41,477 --> 01:12:43,917
Look at you...

1572
01:12:44,518 --> 01:12:48,478
There's you and Melissa.
You were about 5 there.

1573
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:52,711
Do you remember this?

1574
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:55,414
It was taken at the
lake, when you father...

1575
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:58,783
broke his arm, because of
that silly motorcycle of his.

1576
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:02,511
- I miss dad so much
- Me too, Sweetheart.

1577
01:13:02,607 --> 01:13:04,863
I just wish that he could
have been here.

1578
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:08,223
He was always so worried,
I was never gonna meet anyone.

1579
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:11,152
- No, he wasn't.
- That's Paris.

1580
01:13:11,248 --> 01:13:13,544
He could be so 'off
days' sometimes...

1581
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,032
What?

1582
01:13:15,128 --> 01:13:18,602
Well, it's just... He
was always convinced...

1583
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:21,145
that you were gonna marry Tom.

1584
01:13:21,201 --> 01:13:23,119
Really?

1585
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:29,723
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night, My Angel.

1586
01:13:31,682 --> 01:13:33,601
It's pulling off a band aid.

1587
01:13:33,696 --> 01:13:36,666
You just have to close
your eyes and do it.

1588
01:13:36,762 --> 01:13:38,535
- I just haven't
found the right time.

1589
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:40,546
What are you talking
about, 'right time'?

1590
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:43,299
Anytime is the
right time to say...

1591
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:45,095
'I love you, marry me'.

1592
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:46,151
- Right.

1593
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:47,748
Come on, what are
you there for, man?

1594
01:13:47,844 --> 01:13:51,068
Take the shot, win the game
and bring her home.

1595
01:13:51,164 --> 01:13:52,713
And stop running up
my long-distance...

1596
01:13:52,809 --> 01:13:54,195
phone bill with
these crazy calls..

1597
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:57,404
Right, right okay.
Thanks, Felix.

1598
01:13:58,525 --> 01:14:01,330
God, come on. You
can do this, Tom.

1599
01:14:01,426 --> 01:14:04,523
What's wrong with
me? You can do this.

1600
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:16,158
- Hey.
- Hey.

1601
01:14:16,254 --> 01:14:19,518
I thought we could go for a
walk and work on the vows.

1602
01:14:19,614 --> 01:14:23,120
- Good idea. I need some help.
- Good. Okay.

1603
01:14:26,247 --> 01:14:28,079
- What do you think?
- I think a lot of things.

1604
01:14:28,175 --> 01:14:29,266
I've been working
on them all week...

1605
01:14:29,362 --> 01:14:30,638
and I actually think
they're getting worse.

1606
01:14:30,734 --> 01:14:32,334
At first I went
for the 'emotion'.

1607
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,080
I thought: 'What
if Colin does it'?

1608
01:14:34,176 --> 01:14:35,520
Then I tried to be funny...

1609
01:14:35,616 --> 01:14:36,964
I don't know if Scots
have the same...

1610
01:14:37,059 --> 01:14:38,040
sense of humor as Americans.

1611
01:14:38,135 --> 01:14:39,416
So now I am back to
something basic...

1612
01:14:39,512 --> 01:14:40,586
and I totally think
I've geared...

1613
01:14:40,682 --> 01:14:41,560
off into something boring...

1614
01:14:41,656 --> 01:14:42,520
I'm crazy about you.

1615
01:14:42,616 --> 01:14:44,237
I think of you
all the time and

1616
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,601
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

1617
01:14:46,697 --> 01:14:48,353
Really?

1618
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:49,641
Really.

1619
01:14:49,737 --> 01:14:52,040
- That's so 'generic'.
- Generic?

1620
01:14:52,136 --> 01:14:53,881
- Yeah.
- Generic?

1621
01:14:53,977 --> 01:14:55,601
- It totally is.
- How can that be generic?

1622
01:14:55,697 --> 01:14:59,121
It sounds like something
you're supposed...

1623
01:14:59,129 --> 01:15:02,635
to say instead of what
your really feeling.

1624
01:15:03,171 --> 01:15:05,089
Alright. How about...

1625
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:12,326
Nobody in the world makes
me laugh the way you do.

1626
01:15:13,412 --> 01:15:15,330
You're my best friend.

1627
01:15:17,611 --> 01:15:20,171
I just wanna be with you.

1628
01:15:21,171 --> 01:15:25,012
Look, look.
There she is.

1629
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:28,524
Let's go, let's go.

1630
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:31,392
- Hannah, let's go.
- What is this?

1631
01:15:31,813 --> 01:15:33,917
- It's her 'taking out'.
- Her... What?

1632
01:15:34,013 --> 01:15:35,163
We dress her up and then we...

1633
01:15:35,259 --> 01:15:36,726
parade around one of
the pubs in town.

1634
01:15:36,822 --> 01:15:38,405
- That's weird...
- It's tradition.

1635
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:38,944
- Really?

1636
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,846
Then we fill a
toilet with salt...

1637
01:15:40,942 --> 01:15:43,166
and we sell your kisses
for change.

1638
01:15:43,262 --> 01:15:46,494
- Sell your kisses?
- Yep.

1639
01:15:48,054 --> 01:15:51,967
Come on, it's like a Scottish
Bachelorette-party.

1640
01:15:54,494 --> 01:15:56,495
Okay, Okay...

1641
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:10,296
- Okay, come on.

1642
01:16:20,137 --> 01:16:23,977
Change for kisses.
Right there...

1643
01:16:24,978 --> 01:16:26,896
Instead of Whiskeys.

1644
01:16:27,938 --> 01:16:29,683
It's her 'taking-out'.

1645
01:16:29,779 --> 01:16:32,469
She's got the
breath of an angel.

1646
01:17:09,661 --> 01:17:13,262
One more, alright, alright.

1647
01:17:18,022 --> 01:17:19,774
- Another.
- Another.

1648
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:21,788
Thank you.

1649
01:17:25,184 --> 01:17:27,102
This is all I have.

1650
01:18:10,307 --> 01:18:12,972
- Oh, my God. My
God, you guys.

1651
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,372
Let's go.

1652
01:18:14,468 --> 01:18:17,428
We have to get more kisses.

1653
01:18:18,268 --> 01:18:20,187
Kisses.

1654
01:19:21,754 --> 01:19:23,946
- I can't take it anymore.
- What are you doing?

1655
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:24,985
- Let's do it again.
- No.

1656
01:19:25,081 --> 01:19:27,067
- For old time's sake...
- Don't take that off.

1657
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:29,237
- I need to make
this up to you...

1658
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,658
Don't... take... this.

1659
01:19:30,754 --> 01:19:33,586
No, I'm really unhappy.

1660
01:19:33,682 --> 01:19:34,507
- That's fine.
- Tom...

1661
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:37,220
- It's okay. It's okay...
- I'm not happy at all.

1662
01:19:37,315 --> 01:19:39,288
- Get up...
- And I am in a really...

1663
01:19:39,384 --> 01:19:42,875
confusing place in my life
right now...

1664
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:45,548
- Confusing?
- Listen...

1665
01:19:45,644 --> 01:19:48,460
- I have had some whiskey...
- I can tell.

1666
01:19:48,556 --> 01:19:50,549
And I need you
to 'service' me.

1667
01:19:50,645 --> 01:19:52,385
- 'Service' you? I not
gonna 'service you'...

1668
01:19:52,481 --> 01:19:53,228
'Service me', bitch.

1669
01:19:53,324 --> 01:19:54,821
- Oh, my...
'Service me'.

1670
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:57,109
- Be quiet.
- You be quiet.

1671
01:19:57,205 --> 01:19:59,149
Everyone's sleeping...

1672
01:19:59,245 --> 01:20:01,109
- Get down.
- You can't get down.

1673
01:20:01,205 --> 01:20:02,069
You can't...

1674
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:04,286
- Be quiet.
- You be quiet.

1675
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:07,758
No. No. Get off.

1676
01:20:09,557 --> 01:20:11,518
Wait... Wait...

1677
01:20:11,838 --> 01:20:14,692
- Hannah...
- Bring me more whiskey.

1678
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,303
Hannah.

1679
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:21,431
It's Tom, let me in.
Let me in.

1680
01:20:21,527 --> 01:20:22,992
Go away, Tom.

1681
01:20:23,087 --> 01:20:25,151
No. Let me explain.
It's not what you think.

1682
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:27,352
- It doesn't matter now.
- Yes it does. Why did you...

1683
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:28,407
- Just... Go.

1684
01:20:28,503 --> 01:20:30,232
I'll go. Just tell me, why...

1685
01:20:30,328 --> 01:20:32,285
did you come to my room?

1686
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,792
Hannah... Why did you
come to the room?

1687
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:40,241
To talk about that kiss.

1688
01:20:46,361 --> 01:20:49,641
Please, don't...
Don't marry him.

1689
01:20:50,402 --> 01:20:52,946
- All these years, Tom...
- Don't marry him...

1690
01:20:53,042 --> 01:20:55,242
All this time...

1691
01:20:55,443 --> 01:20:58,554
- You're doing this now?
- I know...

1692
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:01,635
- How can you do this?
- I'm sorry... Just let me in.

1693
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:04,836
- No. I can't.
- Let me in.

1694
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:07,760
You're only doing
this now because...

1695
01:21:07,856 --> 01:21:10,140
you are afraid of losing me.

1696
01:21:12,004 --> 01:21:15,427
I need someone who's gonna
be there for me,

1697
01:21:15,484 --> 01:21:17,565
no matter what happens.

1698
01:21:21,365 --> 01:21:24,965
Someone who truly...
Loves me.

1699
01:21:28,446 --> 01:21:30,486
Someone I can trust.

1700
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:41,887
I'm marrying Colin tomorrow...
Tom.

1701
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:01,732
I can't be your
Maid of Honor.

1702
01:22:03,088 --> 01:22:05,009
I can't give you away.

1703
01:22:13,009 --> 01:22:14,928
I'm sorry, Hannah.

1704
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:19,302
I'm sorry, you and Tom
had a fight.

1705
01:22:19,931 --> 01:22:21,848
I'm his best friend.

1706
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:25,056
He's just afraid of
loosing me.

1707
01:22:27,331 --> 01:22:30,011
- He'll get over it.
- Ay.

1708
01:22:58,454 --> 01:23:00,845
- Suck it. Suck it.
- I am.

1709
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:02,967
- Okay. Suck it
in. Breath in...

1710
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:06,047
- Hold it...
- I'm trying, my God..

1711
01:23:06,143 --> 01:23:08,247
- I'll hold it in.
- Okay. Alright, alright.

1712
01:23:08,342 --> 01:23:12,896
- Give it to me..
- 1, 2, 3...

1713
01:23:14,975 --> 01:23:17,207
- Is it?...
- Oh, My God.

1714
01:23:17,303 --> 01:23:18,948
- It fits, it fits.

1715
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:21,736
- It fits.
- Well done.

1716
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:25,309
- Oh no. No, no...
- My God... no...

1717
01:23:51,098 --> 01:23:53,610
- Why are we stopping?
- An early flock.

1718
01:23:53,706 --> 01:23:55,625
A... What?

1719
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,818
Hi, Sweetheart.

1720
01:24:37,943 --> 01:24:39,860
I remember you.

1721
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:42,500
Hey.

1722
01:24:43,023 --> 01:24:44,941
Hi.

1723
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,784
I love you too.

1724
01:24:55,186 --> 01:24:57,103
Thank you.

1725
01:24:58,105 --> 01:25:00,550
Turn around,
I have to go back.

1726
01:25:25,827 --> 01:25:27,745
Oh, no.

1727
01:25:29,267 --> 01:25:33,101
Oh no.
Shit... Shit.

1728
01:25:33,197 --> 01:25:34,885
- Hey, I need
another ferry-boat.

1729
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:36,301
We only got the one ferry.

1730
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:37,356
- What?

1731
01:25:37,452 --> 01:25:39,852
And it's waiting over there
for the ceremony to finish.

1732
01:25:39,948 --> 01:25:41,536
- Is there another
way to get there?

1733
01:25:41,632 --> 01:25:42,220
You can drive.

1734
01:25:42,316 --> 01:25:43,010
- Drive... How long?

1735
01:25:43,106 --> 01:25:44,541
It will take about an
hour and a half...

1736
01:25:44,637 --> 01:25:46,061
- That's too long.
- You can swim.

1737
01:25:46,157 --> 01:25:46,526
- Swim?..

1738
01:25:46,622 --> 01:25:48,381
Or you can go on trip
around the shore.

1739
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:52,227
- That will take a wee while.
- Shore, right...

1740
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:55,782
A horse. A horse.
Hey, I need your horse.

1741
01:25:55,878 --> 01:25:57,796
- My horse?
- Yes.

1742
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:00,823
- Come down from there.
- I need to get to the church.

1743
01:26:00,919 --> 01:26:02,026
What do think you're
planning, you...

1744
01:26:02,122 --> 01:26:03,103
great fool? You'll
hurt yourself.

1745
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:04,157
I'll give you 3 cents for...

1746
01:26:04,252 --> 01:26:05,463
every coffee collar
used worldwide.

1747
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:06,518
- What?

1748
01:26:06,613 --> 01:26:07,855
Do you have any idea
how much money that is?

1749
01:26:07,951 --> 01:26:09,543
Good luck to you, then.
Her name's Nancy.

1750
01:26:09,639 --> 01:26:13,797
- I'll see you over there
- Thanks. Nancy, let's go.

1751
01:26:15,672 --> 01:26:18,197
Stick to the shore... Pass the...

1752
01:26:18,293 --> 01:26:21,229
monument, the church
is on the left.

1753
01:26:21,553 --> 01:26:24,195
What, in the name
of the wee man,

1754
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:26,209
is a 'Coffee collar'?

1755
01:26:26,552 --> 01:26:28,470
Go, Nancy.

1756
01:26:32,674 --> 01:26:36,026
This is just what
this nice dress needs...

1757
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:40,606
and it goes across the dress.
It looks really beautiful.

1758
01:27:03,036 --> 01:27:04,953
Please, be seated.

1759
01:27:06,997 --> 01:27:09,749
We are gathered here together,
in the sight of God...

1760
01:27:09,845 --> 01:27:10,692
- Give me your pin...

1761
01:27:10,788 --> 01:27:12,061
to witness this
congregation...

1762
01:27:12,157 --> 01:27:14,677
To join together this man...

1763
01:27:19,557 --> 01:27:22,004
This is a celebration of love.

1764
01:27:22,438 --> 01:27:24,156
For Colin, it's
through the memories...

1765
01:27:24,252 --> 01:27:25,471
of seeing his parent's love.

1766
01:27:25,567 --> 01:27:27,311
- ...As a child.
- It looks very nice.

1767
01:27:27,406 --> 01:27:29,161
And for Hannah, it's...

1768
01:27:29,257 --> 01:27:32,110
through the paintings
of Modigliani.

1769
01:27:32,126 --> 01:27:34,803
Therefore, if any man
can show just cause...

1770
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:37,512
why these two may not
be joined together...

1771
01:27:37,608 --> 01:27:41,194
Let him now speak,
or forever hold his peace.

1772
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,558
Tom?

1773
01:27:56,321 --> 01:27:58,065
Tom?

1774
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:00,079
Tom.

1775
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,962
Tom.
Tom?

1776
01:28:04,442 --> 01:28:06,360
Tom.

1777
01:28:07,042 --> 01:28:09,082
Tom...

1778
01:28:10,922 --> 01:28:12,114
Tom.

1779
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:14,867
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

1780
01:28:14,963 --> 01:28:17,047
- Tom, what are
you doing here?

1781
01:28:17,143 --> 01:28:19,227
I have to tell
you something...

1782
01:28:19,322 --> 01:28:21,240
Hannah...

1783
01:28:23,404 --> 01:28:24,636
Your hair looks awful.

1784
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:25,916
- It does?
- Yeah.

1785
01:28:26,012 --> 01:28:27,968
- What?
- And the sash...

1786
01:28:28,883 --> 01:28:30,801
It sucks.

1787
01:28:32,324 --> 01:28:34,243
But that hair...

1788
01:28:34,925 --> 01:28:37,212
- It's like a co-op
for parakeets.

1789
01:28:37,308 --> 01:28:38,749
What?

1790
01:28:38,845 --> 01:28:41,118
Look... Hannah...

1791
01:28:41,214 --> 01:28:43,668
I pride myself with
being honest...

1792
01:28:43,764 --> 01:28:44,789
with everybody.

1793
01:28:44,885 --> 01:28:47,883
But there's somebody
I've been lying...

1794
01:28:47,979 --> 01:28:50,391
to for a very long
time. Myself.

1795
01:28:50,487 --> 01:28:54,126
Because the truth it's...
It's scary.

1796
01:28:54,806 --> 01:28:58,511
And 10 years ago I got in bed
with the wrong girl.

1797
01:28:58,607 --> 01:29:01,379
She turned out to be
the right one.

1798
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:09,366
I love you, Hannah.

1799
01:29:10,088 --> 01:29:13,728
I always have...
And I always will.

1800
01:29:15,769 --> 01:29:17,686
Thomas Bailey...

1801
01:29:17,928 --> 01:29:21,649
You are the worst Maid
of Honor of all time.

1802
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:48,570
Oh, no.

1803
01:30:00,653 --> 01:30:02,437
I'm...

1804
01:30:02,533 --> 01:30:04,451
So...

1805
01:30:06,774 --> 01:30:08,853
Very, truly, sorry.

1806
01:30:14,934 --> 01:30:17,950
I don't expect you to
ever forgive me.

1807
01:30:21,974 --> 01:30:23,893
Just so you know...

1808
01:30:25,055 --> 01:30:27,255
You are the perfect guy.

1809
01:30:29,455 --> 01:30:31,982
Just not the perfect guy
for me.

1810
01:30:44,536 --> 01:30:46,454
Goodbye, Hannah.

1811
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:50,295
Colin...

1812
01:30:54,257 --> 01:30:56,849
- What did she say?
- She said I should dick you.

1813
01:30:56,945 --> 01:30:59,227
Oh yeah, that makes sense...

1814
01:31:02,099 --> 01:31:04,017
Arsehole.

1815
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:18,978
- I do.

1816
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:20,572
And Tom, do you take Hannah...

1817
01:31:20,668 --> 01:31:22,955
- to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

1818
01:31:23,051 --> 01:31:24,525
I do.

1819
01:31:24,621 --> 01:31:26,577
Now, this is the moment.

1820
01:31:29,260 --> 01:31:32,613
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1821
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:35,660
At last... You may
kiss your bride.

1822
01:31:59,983 --> 01:32:01,902
Oh my God.

1823
01:32:02,064 --> 01:32:03,982
- Number six?
- Seven.

1824
01:32:05,464 --> 01:32:08,777
You're absolutely glowing
tonight, grandma Pearl.

1825
01:32:08,873 --> 01:32:13,625
Thank you. It's very
nice of you to say so.

1826
01:32:24,425 --> 01:32:26,344
What are you doing?

1827
01:32:28,547 --> 01:32:30,970
I'm just making sure I got
the right girl this time.

1828
01:32:31,066 --> 01:32:34,586
You do.
Definitely.

1829
01:32:39,148 --> 01:32:43,827
- Oh, Monica...
- Oh, Bill...

1830
01:32:46,148 --> 01:32:53,827
