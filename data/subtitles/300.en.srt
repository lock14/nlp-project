1
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,475
The Commodore 64, the lawn dart...

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:12,437
...the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots,
Super Sugar Crisp...

3
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:16,065
...the LaserDisc and now,
back from the halls of obsolescence...

4
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:19,193
-...the Betamax machine.
-You are a lifesaver.

5
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:22,113
Less than 48 hours to become
an expert documentarian...

6
00:00:22,114 --> 00:00:24,782
...all my mom's old newsreels
are on Beta.

7
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:28,411
What? Dawson Leery eschewing
the ephemeral world of make-believe...

8
00:00:28,412 --> 00:00:31,205
...for the gritty realities of real life?

9
00:00:31,206 --> 00:00:34,959
Has the world spun off-course?
Was the Dalai Lama at Black Angus?

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,670
More like my mother's
been dangling a big, fat carrot.

11
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,090
Human interest story for the network
fell out at the last minute.

12
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:42,883
-And?
-And she says...

13
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:46,011
...if l can get her raw footage by Friday,
there's a chance...

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,515
-...it could be on the air that night.
-Hey, the chance of a lifetime.

15
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,643
-That'll make a guy change his vision.
-A temporary change.

16
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:56,147
When l get my foot in the proverbial
door, it's back to make-believe.

17
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:59,149
l don't know, Dawson.
You got an amazing opportunity here...

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,943
...to change your whole genre.

19
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:04,989
Real-life stories are more compelling
than anything you could dream up.

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,951
Real life is interesting, but never as
dramatic as a well-conceived narrative.

21
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:12,246
Look at what's happening in your life.
Are you telling me...

22
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:15,666
...that you could conceive of something
more thrilling, more sexy...

23
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:18,167
...more far-fetched?

24
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:22,548
All right, fine.
Who's your guinea pig?

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,800
-lt's Jack McPhee.
-l get it.

26
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,344
Gay kid joins losing
high-school football team...

27
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:30,222
...overcomes adversity,
battles antiquated stereotypes...

28
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:34,184
...and becomes the star. lf you mess
with that story, you're gilding the lily.

29
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:38,564
lt's a great story, but you can't just
turn the camera on and let it run.

30
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,065
-Why not?
-And hut!

31
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,985
That's what's happening here.
Seems pretty interesting.

32
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:45,529
My mom must've taped over her work.

33
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,656
Honey, this is Dawson.
Can you say hi?

34
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:50,368
-Hi.
-Smile at him.

35
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:53,037
ls that who l think it is?

36
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,946
This is Joey, Dawson.
Can you say hi?

37
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,585
Hi, Joey.

38
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:12,019
Once a heartbreaker, always
a heartbreaker, huh, Dawson?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

40
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:21,457
Good morning.

41
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,962
Why do you insist on degrading
your team colours like that?

42
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,506
Well, Grams, the fishnets
only come in black...

43
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:32,134
...and the matching leather whip,
it's on back order.

44
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,995
-Oh, Jennifer.
-Come on, Grams.

45
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:38,099
The entire notion of cheerleading
is just a sexist attempt...

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,601
...to try and objectify
the female body.

47
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:43,646
-l'm making a statement.
-You're making a mockery.

48
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:47,858
The mockery has been made.
l am simply pointing it out.

49
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,070
But l don't know how many more
pep rallies and spirit cookies...

50
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,905
...l can actually stomach.

51
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:55,699
Your school has
an important game coming up.

52
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,912
Right now, they need
your leadership and verve.

53
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:01,872
Back when l was on the pep squad...

54
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:05,000
...we relished the opportunity
to show off our team spirit...

55
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:08,311
...by wearing our uniforms to school.

56
00:04:10,882 --> 00:04:12,758
Grams, l hate to break it to you...

57
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:18,180
...but you were showing off
a bit more than just team spirit.

58
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:20,681
Jennifer.

59
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:40,857
'' Like, oh, my God.
Go, team.''

60
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:44,122
l thought you'd been possessed
by the school-spirit creatures...

61
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,083
-...from planet Overzealous.
-Not yet.

62
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:49,211
l am thinking about making a run for it
before the pods hatch.

63
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:51,797
-What do you say, Scully?
-Cut class with you?

64
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:55,134
Sounds delectable. l'll pass.

65
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,512
What if l told you that there was
a mission to my madness?

66
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:00,222
-Are you serious?
-But of course.

67
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:03,392
The monsieur in the stylish shirt
requests the madam...

68
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:06,436
...for a very pressing
appointment, yeah?

69
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:09,106
-What is it?
-Well, that would be the surprise part.

70
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:13,026
-Just tell me, Pacey.
-Let me think about that. Nope.

71
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:15,737
Well, fine. You won't tell me,
l'm not going anywhere.

72
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:19,783
Oh, Little Jo, you're so cute,
but friend to friend, honestly...

73
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:22,327
...check into some
''feigning disinterest'' classes.

74
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:26,831
Well, thanks. But trust me, Pacey,
l couldn't care less.

75
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:29,918
Well, okay. Whether or not
you're actually interested...

76
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,713
...you have about 1 0 seconds
to make up your mind. Starting now.

77
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:36,214
One. Two.

78
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:41,222
Three. Four.

79
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,977
Six seconds?

80
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,897
Six? l mean, come on,
have you no pride?

81
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:54,150
-l thought you'd last at least eight.
-l loathe you.

82
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,528
People are shocked
at how you've taken to the game.

83
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:59,113
Did you love football as a child?

84
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:01,366
l've only been playing football
a few weeks.

85
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,869
l think the only subject
l know less about is being gay.

86
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,246
l don't know.

87
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:08,957
Some things are instinct, maybe.

88
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,669
One thing Jack has learned is the
importance of starting practice on time.

89
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,379
Go stretch out to run your 40.

90
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,007
Taking a tenth off yesterday
doesn't mean you can coast.

91
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,842
-Gotta go, Dawson.
-No problem.

92
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:22,553
We can take care
of the Coach Leery interview.

93
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,597
-What do you say, Dad?
-Not now, Dawson.

94
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:28,142
-But, Dad, it's due tomorrow.
-Dawson, you can get an extension.

95
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:31,938
Me, l've got a game on Saturday
and l need these guys focused...

96
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,439
...on football. Okay?

97
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,567
Pick it up!

98
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:39,987
He wore it in the BC-Miami game.

99
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:42,782
Spit it out right after
throwing the Hail Mary.

100
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:46,243
When the whistle blew, my brother
ran onto the field and grabbed it.

101
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:48,412
Well, the dude's got
some big molars.

102
00:06:48,413 --> 00:06:52,124
They're crowns, actually.
Check out the number two bicuspids.

103
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,335
Remind you of anyone?

104
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:57,326
Hey, what's everybody looking at?

105
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:02,510
Oh, well, apparently, we're looking
at Doug Flutie's old mouthpiece.

106
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,011
A mouthpiece?

107
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:08,767
That was actually in his mouth?

108
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:11,684
Well, that's disgusting.

109
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:16,726
Henry says it's his good-luck charm.

110
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,444
Henry needs his head examined.

111
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,700
What am l gonna do, Jack?
l gotta do something.

112
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:30,496
Jen Lindley, her voice
is the sweetest music.

113
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:33,667
Her very name is fire in my loins.

114
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:41,164
Just a thought, Henry, but next time
you might wanna start by saying hello.

115
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:47,346
Hey, we missed you this morning
at the spirit table.

116
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,056
Where were you?
We were worried.

117
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:52,100
l stayed really late
at that pep rally yesterday.

118
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,770
-l have limits.
-ls this a low-iron day?

119
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,566
Yeah, try not to let anyone else see,
because it might hurt the auction.

120
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,360
-Auction?
-The silent auction.

121
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:05,280
You should be really proud. lt's the
most successful one we've ever had.

122
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:08,700
Like, half the senior guys
have already put in their bids.

123
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,452
What are you auctioning off?

124
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:13,663
Well, the winner gets to ride in
on the Minuteman mule...

125
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:15,165
...at the end of the game.

126
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,251
And receive a kiss
from the head cheerleader.

127
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:20,797
Oh, no, they don't.

128
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:25,009
-Now, Jenny--
-Jen. Okay? lt's Jen.

129
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:28,011
You know, this whole thing
started as a bad joke...

130
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:30,055
...an excuse to get out of biology...

131
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:34,893
...but do you see what it's turned into?
l have pranced around at pep rallies...

132
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:37,646
...without even knowing
what the hell '' pep'' is.

133
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,732
l have listened to prattle about
car washes, dance-a-thons...

134
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,235
...and dog-sitting until l could
puke up my homemade spirit cookies.

135
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:46,654
-Jenny--
-And despite the itch on my ass...

136
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:50,950
...from this polyester molest-me skirt,
l've done it all with a smile on my face.

137
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,827
But you know what?
The smile is gone.

138
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:55,038
There is no way
l'm gonna be sold off...

139
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,290
...like a harem girl
to the highest bidder.

140
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:02,131
Everyone has a limit,
and l've reached mine. l quit.

141
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:17,738
-'' ETS''?
-Stop. Drop that folder.

142
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,980
-Back away from the material.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,811
Keep your hands in plain sight.

144
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:27,612
Are you with
the Educational Testing Service?

145
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:30,531
-That's confidential.
-l hope nobody at Capeside High...

146
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,742
...has done anything wrong,
broken any rules...

147
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:34,827
...compromised the integrity
of the exam.

148
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:38,331
Passing along that information
would constitute a breach of security.

149
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,833
-Of course.
-Know where Principal Green is?

150
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:43,461
No, sir.
But before you go...

151
00:09:43,462 --> 00:09:47,256
...let me express my regret
and recalcitrance at this incident.

152
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:51,053
-Recalcitrance?
-l mean, repentance.

153
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:54,805
Repentance, as in contrition?
Compunction?

154
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:57,306
You know, contriteness.

155
00:09:57,851 --> 00:10:02,355
Good day, ma'am. Watch yourself.

156
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:12,239
This isn't a surprise, Pacey.
lt's a death march on a deserted road.

157
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,074
We're almost there.

158
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:17,077
-Why didn't we just drive?
-Because, Potter, on occasion...

159
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:19,997
...my father actually likes
to use his car.

160
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:23,083
So l risk my future
to stand in line at the post office...

161
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:27,504
...and then traipse five miles through
wilderness carrying a stupid package?

162
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:30,466
Did you ever think about
how much hormonal energy...

163
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,510
...you waste on these quick quips
and the biting banter?

164
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,055
Your life would be considerably
more productive...

165
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,932
...if you would just take some more....

166
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,810
Oh, what is that?
Some more.... Action!

167
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:45,022
-lf you took more action.
-Oh, like voluntary manslaughter?

168
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:47,983
Well, how about, like,
sticking out your thumb?

169
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:49,818
Oh, yeah? And what else?

170
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:52,863
Maybe hike up my skirt,
pout my lips...

171
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:55,699
...strike some sexy pose
for a horndog trucker?

172
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,659
Stick out your thumb,
you sexist toad.

173
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,954
l am not a sexist.
l am a pragmatist, okay?

174
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:02,623
You ever seen The Sure Thing?

175
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:05,667
That film elegantly portrays
one of life's simple truths:

176
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:09,463
A female on the side of the road,
even one with a perpetual scowl...

177
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,840
...can flag down a car
better than a guy.

178
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:14,009
l'm the only one
with an opposable thumb...

179
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:20,060
-...so l guess it's up to me to use it.
-And here's your chance.

180
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:36,405
Hi.

181
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:42,662
Today's your lucky day, Miss Potter.
Need a ride back to school?

182
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,163
Thanks.

183
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:51,337
Principal Green.

184
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:54,674
Thank God you are here. ln preparing
for our botany assignment...

185
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:57,677
...Josephine and l wandered
significantly farther away...

186
00:11:57,678 --> 00:12:00,889
...from the school than anticipated.
l was beginning to worry...

187
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,727
...that we weren't going to
make it home by nightfall.

188
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:08,228
That's a good one, Pacey.

189
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:12,483
Let it never be said that l'm
lacking in the creativity department.

190
00:12:12,484 --> 00:12:15,570
Let's hope you're not lacking
in calamine lotion either.

191
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:20,658
Now, put down the poison oak
and get your butts in my car.

192
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,159
After you, Josephine.

193
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:29,499
All right. Dad.

194
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,963
Dad.

195
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,924
l know you're busy.
l need 1 0 minutes of your time.

196
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:39,010
Can't it just wait till after the game?

197
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:41,721
l'll have plenty of time after Saturday.

198
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:43,764
Dad, l gotta FedEx this thing out.

199
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:47,205
-FedEx?
-Yeah. To Mom at the station.

200
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:50,021
Station?

201
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:53,482
-What are you talking about?
-The story l'm doing on Jack.

202
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,693
Your mother wants to do
a story on Jack?

203
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,362
l wanna do a story on Jack.
l am doing the story.

204
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:01,949
-This is gonna go on television? When?
-Hopefully tomorrow.

205
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,286
-Dad, we talked about this.
-l thought this was a school project.

206
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:07,413
lt is a project.
Remember last night...

207
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:09,457
...the blond-haired kid
moving his lips?

208
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,752
-That was me telling you this.
-Dawson, this is the last thing...

209
00:13:12,753 --> 00:13:15,421
-...that l need right now.
-Why is that?

210
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:18,799
Because football is a head game,
and l can't risk my best player...

211
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,970
...or any player, for that matter, losing
focus. l've worked too damn hard.

212
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:26,932
Forgive me if my future conflicts
with your precious football team.

213
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:29,101
Now, don't be so theatrical.

214
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:32,271
l have a football-loving principal
breathing down my neck.

215
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,565
l am trying to build something here.

216
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:38,652
What do you think l'm doing,
dabbling in a hobby?

217
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:41,864
lt's the kind of opportunity
l've waited for all my life.

218
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:44,365
All 1 6 years of it?

219
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,745
Oh, so the importance of dreams
is measured by age?

220
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:52,806
There will be plenty of other
opportunities, believe me.

221
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:58,422
-Are you telling me not to do this?
-l don't have to.

222
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:02,523
Because l know
you'll make the right choice.

223
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,997
-Hey.
-Hey.

224
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:36,209
You must be lost. Bimbo Cove is up
the creek, right past Brainless Bay.

225
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,004
Save your ammunition.
Eve and l aren't speaking.

226
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:44,384
-You mean you guys actually talked?
-Among other things, yes.

227
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,885
l need some advice.

228
00:14:47,722 --> 00:14:50,724
What else are dumped
ex-girlfriends for?

229
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,809
This is about my father.

230
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,644
Your father?
What about him?

231
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,814
He told me not to do the story
on Jack and the football team.

232
00:14:57,815 --> 00:15:00,900
-He did?
-Well, in so many words.

233
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,319
He thinks it might
jeopardize his career...

234
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,130
...his chances against Woodward.

235
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,201
No offence, Dawson, but doesn't
a nationally televised broadcast...

236
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,871
...kind of overshadow
a high-school football rivalry?

237
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:16,207
You'd have thought. l don't know.
Look at his point of view.

238
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,586
The last couple of years,
his cup hasn't exactly runneth over.

239
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:23,590
He had to give up his restaurant dream,
his wife stepped out on him...

240
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:26,050
...with the Capeside equivalent
of Ted Knight...

241
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,762
...and he's not exactly shining
as a substitute teacher.

242
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,682
lf you do the story,
he could lose more than the game.

243
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:37,187
-He could lose his self-respect.
-Yeah.

244
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,522
What do you think?

245
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,900
Well, l think that the swords
that are the father and son...

246
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,070
...have finally crossed in conflict.
l mean, face it, Dawson...

247
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:51,450
-...this is the stuff of Greek drama.
-Yeah, but is this tragedy or comedy?

248
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,579
Sometimes we fight our fathers
and they respect us.

249
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,126
And sometimes we fight them...

250
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:04,298
...and, well, we lose them forever.

251
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,969
You have to decide
how you wanna live your life.

252
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,847
You know,
what you can tolerate and....

253
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,808
And what you're willing to lose.

254
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:22,606
God, this is so important to me,
but if l do it, it's gonna kill him.

255
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,859
Well...

256
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,570
...l hate to tell you,
but according to Freud...

257
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:31,911
...that's exactly
what sons are supposed to do.

258
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,236
-l dubbed this for you.
-What's this?

259
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,071
Something l found.
Made me smile.

260
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,710
l guess now you can
call it a thank-you.

261
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:02,271
-lt must be dried saliva.
-No, it's a zipper mark from the pillow.

262
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:06,108
Yes, that bright sensation
in your eyes is indeed sunlight.

263
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,944
Rise and shine, dear girl.
These lovely young ladies...

264
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,071
...have an urgent matter to discuss.

265
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,533
l told you that l was finished
with cheerleading...

266
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,745
...and unless one of you is hiding a cup
of black coffee under her pompoms...

267
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,748
-...l suggest you leave.
-No, we respect your decision...

268
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,417
...to resign from the squad.

269
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,585
Madison accepted
the leadership challenge.

270
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,755
But please,
you must reconsider the kiss.

271
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,759
-Someone has bid $500.
-But they've specifically stipulated...

272
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,637
-...the kiss comes from you.
-l don't care if they bid...

273
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,682
...the kingdom of Brunei,
l'm not for sale.

274
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,935
What are we gonna tell
the children at the CCHPC?

275
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,104
The what?

276
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:48,400
The Capeside County Home
for Parentless Children.

277
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,612
Orphans? That--?
That's what the auction is for?

278
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,113
Orphans?

279
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,295
Miss McPhee.
Been looking for you.

280
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,006
-Principal Green.
-Yes. Listen, a critical problem...

281
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,301
...has been brought to my attention,
and l need to talk to you.

282
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:19,264
-What sort of problem, sir?
-lt's a disciplinary matter.

283
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,015
-Disciplinary?
-Yes.

284
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,142
l'm unable to discuss it
at length now...

285
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:29,023
...but come to my office Monday, we'll
go over all of our options in detail.

286
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:34,071
-Options. Yes, sir.
-Monday morning. Be there.

287
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,163
So since Mr. Witter's attempt
at lying to me was so creative...

288
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,375
...l've come up with a little
creative response in kind.

289
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,170
Coming from a just-minded soul like
yourself, l'm sure your punishment...

290
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,090
-...will be nothing but fair, sir.
-Thanks, Eddie Haskell.

291
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,802
-Where is your school spirit?
-l think l left it cowering in the bushes.

292
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:02,139
That is a gross misconception. l hurled
myself on the flames of responsibility.

293
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,642
l hope a tick crawled in your ear
and laid eggs.

294
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,019
Enough!

295
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,731
Honestly, l am not sure how
to get through to the two of you...

296
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,401
...but since you have an affinity
for one another...

297
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,202
...here's what l have in mind.

298
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,906
-No way.
-That's not gonna happen.

299
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,477
Oh, l'm glad to see
we're all in agreement here.

300
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,124
Can't believe he caught the thing.
lt was way over his head.

301
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,625
-Hey.
-Hey.

302
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,963
-What's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong.

303
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:38,300
-Why should anything be wrong?
-Because you're sitting in the stairwell.

304
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:43,806
Unless you're smoking or making out,
it's a cause for concern.

305
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,517
l'm going to meet Dawson
to check out the footage.

306
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,603
-You went through with it?
-Yeah. lt was cool. Went great.

307
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:52,147
Maybe today, but anything
could happen tomorrow...

308
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:54,775
-...to rock your safe little world.
-What?

309
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,027
Jack, maybe you
overlooked something.

310
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,154
Maybe--
Maybe you didn't see every angle.

311
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:01,406
Maybe you had a terrible
moment of weakness.

312
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:05,160
Maybe, without even realizing it,
you totally, irreversibly screwed up.

313
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:07,996
Andie, it's not a big deal.
Why are you so paranoid?

314
00:20:07,997 --> 00:20:11,667
Look, Jack, you could live your entire
life on the straight and narrow...

315
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,419
...driving towards something
you believe in. Then what?

316
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,924
One tiny little mistake,
one little error in judgment...

317
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:23,095
...next thing, your car's flipped over,
wheels still spinning and the radio on.

318
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,556
-What the hell are you talking about?
-About being publicly shamed.

319
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:30,185
Exposed for what you really are.
l'm talking about a life being ruined.

320
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:33,313
Cut short. Nipped in the bud.
About breaking Dad's heart.

321
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:36,066
-Dad?
-Think about how he's gonna feel, Jack.

322
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:40,237
His disappointment, his humiliation.
We are his pride and joy, Jack.

323
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:43,406
Think about how hard
he's worked for us over the years.

324
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,784
Now this, in the open,
for everyone to see.

325
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:48,286
Calm down.
lt's not like l'm still in the closet.

326
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:50,705
Dad already knows l'm gay.

327
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:53,506
l know-- Yeah, l know. l know.

328
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:58,546
l just want you to be careful, Jack.
Every action has a consequence.

329
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:01,987
Be sure you think
this thing through.

330
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:07,179
No one cares what I do off the field.

331
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:10,642
So you have no problem playing
against someone who's openly gay?

332
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:13,728
If a kid wears lipstick and rouge...

333
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:20,189
... we'll infringe on him, lik e we
infringe on anybody. No difference.

334
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:23,361
Well?

335
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:30,166
l just lost the first game
of my coaching career.

336
00:21:30,746 --> 00:21:33,246
lf you say so.

337
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,918
Dawson, that just went out
to 3 million people.

338
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,711
Not to mention...

339
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:41,631
...you interviewed
the opposing coach.

340
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:43,966
-So?
-So?

341
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:48,096
So two days ago, nobody knew
how good Jack was or who he is.

342
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:50,599
Now the whole world knows.

343
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:54,936
You might as well have gone out
and painted a bull's-eye on his back.

344
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:58,439
-You never explained that to me, Dad.
-lt's pretty damn obvious!

345
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,525
Not to me, it isn't.

346
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:02,860
lnstead of celebrating
my first success...

347
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:04,779
...we're worrying about a game.

348
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,240
Don't make me out to be
the bad guy, Dawson.

349
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:09,867
Yes, l'm angry,
just like you knew l would be.

350
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,704
This is a team that hasn't put a notch
in the win column in three years.

351
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:15,790
Are we saying
that l'm wasting my time?

352
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,293
-No, l want you to have perspective.
-l can't discuss this right now.

353
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:21,796
You have no idea
what you're talking about!

354
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:24,590
Thanks to you, l don't.
Ever since you took this job...

355
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,259
-...you haven't spoken to me.
-l talk to you.

356
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,762
Not the way you talk to the guys
on your team.

357
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:34,099
-You know what? They respect me.
-l respect you, Dad.

358
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,644
They're more the kind of son
you wish you'd had.

359
00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:39,021
That is not true.

360
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:43,400
Dawson, l hum the theme
from Close Encounters in my sleep.

361
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:45,277
l reach out to you.

362
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,863
When we can't find common ground,
l give you space.

363
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:50,616
-When l take it, you get pissed off.
-No.

364
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:54,787
l'm trying to break you out of your
self-centred world long enough...

365
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:58,665
-...to look out for other people.
-Why do l have to look out for you?

366
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,377
-What are you saying?
-l'm saying l parent you, Dad.

367
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:03,837
l walk in on you having sex.
l give you advice.

368
00:23:03,838 --> 00:23:09,788
l'm the kid around here.
And sometimes l might even act like it.

369
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:32,245
Come on, let's hit him!
Hit him!

370
00:23:49,592 --> 00:23:53,345
Go back to tetherball,
you limp-wristed homo.

371
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:57,682
-This is getting ugly.
-Crackback, damn it! Crackback!

372
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:02,343
Right guard blocks down.
Litvack takes out the end.

373
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:06,775
They're keying on Jack.
He's getting killed.

374
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:10,070
And our running game's DOA.
Walk it off, McPhee!

375
00:24:10,071 --> 00:24:12,822
-Good man! Walk it off!
-Walk it off?

376
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:16,785
-l am walking it off. You walk it off.
-You all right? Huddle up!

377
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:18,995
Let's go!

378
00:24:18,996 --> 00:24:23,041
So tell me the truth.
ls this all my fault?

379
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:26,712
ln a word, yes.

380
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:29,589
Look on the bright side, Dawson.

381
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,218
At least when this is all over,
you won't be on the 50-yard line...

382
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:38,097
...puckering your lips for some spoiled
brat with furry teeth and halitosis.

383
00:24:38,098 --> 00:24:41,351
-Just think of it as Method acting.
-lt's out of the question.

384
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:44,062
-l'll flip you for it.
-Not a chance.

385
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:46,356
-Forget it.
-Fine. l'll cut to the chase...

386
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,858
...and beg you.
Please, Joey. Please, please.

387
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,444
-Don't make me go out there.
-Pacey. Look...

388
00:24:51,445 --> 00:24:54,155
...l should be at work now
making much-needed money...

389
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:57,992
...but l'm standing on a football field
fighting over the rear end of a mule.

390
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:01,871
Fine. Fine.
l was just giving you fair warning.

391
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:06,668
-What?
-l tend to get carsick in back seats.

392
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:17,345
Principal Green?

393
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:22,433
l made a mistake. Well,
a terrible error in judgment, really.

394
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,227
There's no excuse for it,
so l won't waste your time.

395
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:29,023
But there is an explanation,
one that l can only pray...

396
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:32,693
...you'll find it in your heart
to understand.

397
00:25:32,694 --> 00:25:37,031
See, there's this guy.
And when l met him, it was like....

398
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:41,410
Like a shade going up in a dark room,
light suddenly pouring in.

399
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:45,748
He understood me in a way
that no one ever did or could.

400
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:49,960
And then, just as suddenly,
the room got dark again.

401
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,464
ln my mind, l mean.

402
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:55,341
See...

403
00:25:55,342 --> 00:26:01,598
...over the summer,
l was treated at a psychiatric hospital.

404
00:26:01,765 --> 00:26:06,365
l didn't have to stay long,
because l got better.

405
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:11,649
But when l came back,
l'd lost the guy.

406
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,944
He was my soul mate.

407
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:19,199
lt was like having an organ,
my heart...

408
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:22,785
...literally ripped from my body.

409
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:28,932
And all l could feel was cold
and empty, my future slipping away.

410
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:32,003
And l had lost the love.

411
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,381
So l was determined not to lose
my life. And that's why...

412
00:26:36,382 --> 00:26:39,426
...l stole the test
and that's why l cheated...

413
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:44,264
...because l wanted to try to keep it
from all getting away from me.

414
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:48,227
And l know that
l only made things worse.

415
00:26:49,437 --> 00:26:51,313
So...

416
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:55,414
...now all l can ask for
is your compassion.

417
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:08,913
And that ends the first half...

418
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:13,209
... with the Woodward War Eagles
leading the Capeside Minutemen 21-0.

419
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,628
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

420
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:18,129
To even the score.

421
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:21,968
Come on, guys.
You can't let them get to you.

422
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:24,846
They're psyching you out.
Taking us out of our game plan.

423
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:28,057
We're not moving the ball.
We're not firing out on defence!

424
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:32,187
Suck in that gut and go harder.
A long time ago...

425
00:27:32,188 --> 00:27:35,064
...there was a Chinese
warrior-philosopher.

426
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:37,525
General Sun Tzu.

427
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:42,405
Brilliant military strategist
who lived about 2000 years ago.

428
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:47,327
My dad's been telling me about him
ever since l was a kid.

429
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,370
What's with the bucket?

430
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:52,248
Turn our weakness into a strength,
like the general said.

431
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:56,210
We'll start by obscuring the numbers
so the other team can't find Jack.

432
00:27:56,211 --> 00:27:58,421
That might work
for a couple of plays.

433
00:27:58,422 --> 00:28:03,602
-That's why it's only phase one.
-So, what's phase two?

434
00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:20,568
Let's get up there
and hit somebody, now.

435
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:24,031
-Hit somebody!
-Here we go.

436
00:28:24,197 --> 00:28:26,240
Cross your fingers.

437
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:28,952
-Break!
-Come on!

438
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:38,462
Hey, coach, what's this?

439
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:50,521
Forty-two. Blue Turk, right.
Double slot.

440
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:55,186
Try and find the homo now!

441
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:58,604
Set. Hut!

442
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:06,447
Twenty-four to 21,
with seven seconds left.

443
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:08,324
The Minutemen have one last chance.

444
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:11,326
Can you get a step on him, Jack?
What do you think?

445
00:29:11,327 --> 00:29:13,997
l think my mascara's running.

446
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:16,707
No, just throw me the ball.
l'll catch it.

447
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:20,043
Consider it done.
All right, cradle out. Drill nine shiver.

448
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:22,337
Broadside option, flow-and-go.
On two. Ready?

449
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:24,798
-Break!
-It's fourth and 1 4.

450
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,419
The ball's sitting on the 25-yard line.

451
00:29:46,696 --> 00:29:50,476
-McPhee has it!
-Come on, let's hit him!

452
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:56,913
Touchdown! Touchdown!

453
00:29:56,914 --> 00:30:00,001
Capeside wins! Capeside wins!

454
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:06,089
What an incredible comeback!
After a long dry spell...

455
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,383
... Capeside is victorious.

456
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:14,098
Final score..
Capeside 2 7, War Eagles 24.

457
00:30:14,557 --> 00:30:17,977
Outstanding! Outstanding!

458
00:30:18,144 --> 00:30:20,395
-Mitch!
-Yes, sir.

459
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:23,732
That was one of the most
irreverent and imaginative...

460
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:25,316
...game plans l've ever seen.

461
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:29,877
-Congratulations, coach!
-Thank you. That's great--

462
00:30:31,157 --> 00:30:33,957
One good deed down, one to go.

463
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:37,370
Jennifer Lindley, once again
a victim of her own big heart.

464
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,871
Don't push it, buddy.

465
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,710
-l need to talk to you.
-Not right now, Andie.

466
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:47,880
No, sir, it's important. lt cannot wait.
We need to clear this up.

467
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:50,466
-Okay, what is it?
-Well, l made a mistake.

468
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:54,887
-A terrible error in judgment, really.
-What kind of mistake?

469
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:59,225
-There's no excuse for what l've done--
-What are you talking about?

470
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:01,936
-Didn't you wanna talk to me?
-lt was Monday.

471
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:04,647
l was gonna discuss it then,
but if you must know...

472
00:31:04,648 --> 00:31:11,348
...l'm forming a student disciplinary
committee, and l want you in charge.

473
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:15,700
Well, l could do that.
l mean, l would be honoured to do that.

474
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:19,328
Now, what was this mistake
you were talking about?

475
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:24,375
l shouldn't have interrupted you.
lt's a mistake to be so impatient.

476
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:26,919
But l'm working on it, sir.

477
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,381
-Okay. l'll talk to you later.
-Okay.

478
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:33,176
l'm working on it.

479
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:43,353
All right! Okay! Okay!

480
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,773
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

481
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,900
...the moment that you've all
been waiting for.

482
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:53,863
The winner of the silent auction,
who is entitled to one ride...

483
00:31:53,864 --> 00:31:57,908
...on the Minuteman mule
and one heart-stopping kiss...

484
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:00,911
-...from our head cheerleader.
-Ex-head cheerleader.

485
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:03,412
And here he is!

486
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:16,459
-That's a way, rookie!
-Get a horse.

487
00:32:16,845 --> 00:32:19,345
-Way to go, Henry!
-Henry?

488
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:24,978
How the hell did you get $500?

489
00:32:26,396 --> 00:32:29,399
-Way to go, Henry!
-Mouthpiece.

490
00:32:29,899 --> 00:32:32,150
Mouth--?

491
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:35,571
Wait a minute. You sold
your good-luck Doug Flutie...

492
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:38,740
-...memorial mouthpiece to kiss me?
-Come on, Henry!

493
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:42,494
-You gonna kiss her or what, huh?
-So romantic.

494
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:45,831
l don't know whether to gag
or be incredibly touched.

495
00:32:45,832 --> 00:32:48,291
-Don't be shy!
-Kiss her!

496
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:53,089
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss!

497
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:58,627
You-- You don't--
You don't have to...

498
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:02,181
...if you don't want to.

499
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:08,104
Come here, freshman.

500
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:26,496
Okay, okay. Everybody, go home.

501
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:30,333
-Show's over, folks. Go home--
-No, no. Not quite yet.

502
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:34,003
We have a little
unfinished business yet here.

503
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:37,048
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting to you your choice...

504
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:40,927
...for Capeside's 1 999
homecoming queen...

505
00:33:40,928 --> 00:33:44,306
...Miss Jennifer Lindley!

506
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:57,319
Oh, this isn't happening.

507
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:07,203
See? l told you everything
would work out fine.

508
00:34:07,204 --> 00:34:09,288
-You did?
-Yeah. Everything works out...

509
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:12,959
...for the best, as long
as you keep a positive attitude.

510
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,629
Positive attitude.
Okay, is this before or after...

511
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,050
...l disgraced the family's good name
and forever humiliated our father?

512
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,094
Don't worry about Dad.
He's over it.

513
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:26,764
He's probably out sailing or golfing.
l wouldn't give it another thought.

514
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,308
Andie, you're making my head spin.

515
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:32,228
Look, Jack, l am just glad it's over.

516
00:34:32,229 --> 00:34:35,607
l can't tell you how relieved l am.

517
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:38,814
Hey, so who won the game, anyway?

518
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:43,322
Somebody was so sweaty,
l couldn't breathe!

519
00:34:43,323 --> 00:34:45,658
Somebody wouldn't
let me take my shirt off.

520
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,077
Well, somebody forgot
to open the air vent!

521
00:34:48,078 --> 00:34:51,163
Well, somebody forgot to mention
there were air vents!

522
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:55,835
l told you we never should have
listened to those two slackers.

523
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:58,212
This is it?

524
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:00,713
This is the surprise?

525
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:03,133
lsn't she beautiful?

526
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,387
Yeah, in a Titanic post-iceberg
sort of way.

527
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:08,973
-Where did you get this?
-Friend of my brother's.

528
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,558
Works in the marina.
Rescued her after a hurricane.

529
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:16,647
The owner didn't want her, so l
convinced him to sell her for $200.

530
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,775
When l finish with this boat,
it will be sheer perfection.

531
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:22,444
-Look at that.
-Pacey, do you know...

532
00:35:22,445 --> 00:35:26,031
...how much money and time
it'll take you to even get this to float?

533
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:30,452
Yeah. Not a minute more or less
than as long as it takes me.

534
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:32,788
You watch, Potter.
Couple of months...

535
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:35,582
...l'll be sailing this baby
around the world.

536
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,417
Hate to tell you,
Captain Stubing...

537
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:40,295
...but you can't sail
around the world in a 20-foot boat.

538
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:43,215
-Sure, l can.
-Where will you put the supplies?

539
00:35:43,216 --> 00:35:46,510
The USS Minnow was no bigger,
and it fit Mr. Howell's money...

540
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:49,012
...the Professor's tools,
Ginger's clothes--

541
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,423
And where do you think
you're going?

542
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:57,229
-Permission to come aboard?
-Permission granted.

543
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,730
Thank you.

544
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:07,088
And now, the purpose
for our little foray into truancy....

545
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:12,145
-What do you say?
-''True love''?

546
00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:14,287
Yeah. lt's my girl's name.

547
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:16,456
Kind of high on the schmaltz factor,
huh?

548
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,957
Acutely.

549
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:22,254
-But sweet.
-Remember...

550
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:24,172
...l told you l needed your help.

551
00:36:24,173 --> 00:36:26,091
With what?

552
00:36:26,092 --> 00:36:28,594
Well...

553
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:31,261
...start sanding.

554
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:34,598
You are so overboard.

555
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,628
The night you were born,
l bawled like a baby.

556
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:36,367
Did you really?

557
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:40,414
l didn't know that.

558
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:44,515
Yeah, l think l cried
for 24 hours straight.

559
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,216
Holding you...

560
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:52,594
...so small in my arms.

561
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:57,431
l never knew l could
love anything so much.

562
00:37:57,432 --> 00:37:59,976
So fast.

563
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:02,643
So utterly.

564
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:05,607
Part of me was terrified.

565
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:13,656
Raising a son is more a matter of faith
than most people know.

566
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:16,201
So's being one.

567
00:38:16,785 --> 00:38:19,285
You're right.

568
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:27,754
-l think l realized something today.
-What?

569
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:32,466
That my job as a father
isn't to give you the whole picture...

570
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:36,512
...because the truth is,
l can't see it myself.

571
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:39,766
My job is to try and help...

572
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:44,688
...every now and then,
with a piece of the puzzle.

573
00:38:47,148 --> 00:38:50,944
-You have helped me, Dad.
-l hope so.

574
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:58,868
But your future, your expectations,
they belong to you.

575
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:03,164
Don't let anybody stand in the way.

576
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:07,751
Not even me.

577
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:11,612
You always push me
to be my own person...

578
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,425
...to think for myself.

579
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:19,644
l just did what you taught me.

580
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:31,149
What do you say we go home, pop in
Close Encounters or something?

581
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,650
Actually...

582
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:36,570
...l was thinking...

583
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:39,743
...how about a game of catch?

584
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:46,288
Give me that.

585
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:53,478
Why don't we leave the football
here on the field, where it belongs.

586
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:38,193
-Bye, Joey.
-Bye, Dawson.

587
00:41:39,305 --> 00:41:45,680
