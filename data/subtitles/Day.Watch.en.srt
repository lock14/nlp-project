1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,029
Why does the wind blow?

2
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:36,795
It wipes the tracks
where we have passed …

3
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:41,134
so that no one can tell
whether we still exist.

4
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:51,844
Long ago when warriors
of Light and Darkness …

5
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,408
clashed on the Bridge of Justice …

6
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:58,957
and blood was spilled …

7
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:03,859
the great Gesser’s heart
could not bear it …

8
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,727
and he stopped the battle.

9
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:11,929
But in due time, when the night
is longer than the day …

10
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:15,200
a new Great One will come.

11
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:18,537
The world will be
plunged into darkness …

12
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:21,078
and nothing can save it …

13
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,081
except the Chalk of Fate …

14
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:29,813
which is kept
in an impenetrable fortress.

15
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:34,450
And all who come for it
and pass through the gates …

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,618
perish in its endless maze.

17
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:40,096
—So had it always been—

18
00:01:40,198 --> 00:01:42,258
until Tamerlane came.

19
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:48,704
<i>Northern Iran
Tamerlane’s army</i>

20
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,248
Mercy!

21
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,807
Mercy! Mercy!

22
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:18,651
Please! I have done you no wrong.

23
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:20,987
—Don’t kill me!

24
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,584
The temple holds the Chalk.
It’s in there.

25
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:44,915
Long and hard have you
fought to be here, Tamerlane.

26
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,951
I will control
the fate of the world—

27
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,716
You can’t even
control your own fate.

28
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,069
What should I write?

29
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:09,230
—What is it you want?
—To live.

30
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,309
Then write that.

31
00:05:23,454 --> 00:05:25,718
The temple holds the Chalk.

32
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,391
You said that before.

33
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:39,836
Don’t kill me.
Don’t kill—

34
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:58,423
“From that time on, Tamerlane made
no more mistakes that he could not correct.”

35
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,355
You knew that?

36
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:05,362
Trainee Nazarova, just do me
a favour and put the book away.

37
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:07,261
<i>TAMERLANE</i>

38
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:10,266
Could it be?
The Chalk exists?

39
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,769
Anything you want to change?

40
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,362
Would you move the knee away?

41
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:18,601
Why do you always talk to me
like I did something wrong, huh?

42
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,473
—That’s enough. Just move your knee.

43
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,553
—“Happy New Year! Moscow 2006”

44
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:40,596
I’m starving.

45
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,134
Well, then … can I
take you out to dinner?

46
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,898
Yeah? Like where?

47
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:49,235
Here. Chinese.

48
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,139
Chinese? Sounds good.

49
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,610
Tomorrow at 6:00-no, 7:00.

50
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:57,341
—Yes?
—Yeah.

51
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,439
Um, all right.
We will then.

52
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,985
—If nothing happens.
—That goes without saying.

53
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:05,386
Is anyone out there near the Expo Centre?

54
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,685
Gorodetsky. I’m about five
minutes away from there.

55
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:10,762
Report of a human being attacked.

56
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:14,127
Another old woman.
Same pattern as before.

57
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,201
Stabbed with a large needle.
Attacked from behind.

58
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,264
The needle was placed so it entered
under the victim’s shoulder.

59
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,932
What’s happening?

60
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,483
The attacker is sucking the victim’s energy.

61
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,620
No I.D. on this one.
Be careful. He’s very dangerous.

62
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:43,627
Sorry. Can’t go there.
I’m with a trainee.

63
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,790
Read you.
1485, on our way.

64
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,531
Thanks, Anton. I knew you wouldn’t let me down.

65
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,199
Someone really needs
to deal with those Dark Ones.

66
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:03,079
Do not go into the Gloom without me.

67
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,514
—Hmm?
—Move slowly in there and breathe deeply.

68
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:08,711
And the second level
is out of bounds.

69
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,720
—What’s in there?
—Don’t know. Never been there.

70
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:13,255
They say mosquitoes.

71
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:16,759
—Even mosquitoes don’t live there.
—Boris Ivanovich said they did.

72
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,160
Well, of course, if he said so.

73
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,165
Only use the flashlight
for lighting, okay?

74
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,067
—What’s it do?
—Don’t touch this.

75
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,419
Right there!

76
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,048
Sveta. Sveta!

77
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,624
Sveta!

78
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,789
What the hell do you think you’re doing, huh?

79
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,130
Hey, Sveta! Who said you could
get out of the truck?

80
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:00,101
—And then, uh—
—Stop yelling at me.

81
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:02,264
He hurt me.

82
00:09:02,374 --> 00:09:05,070
My shoulder hurts me.

83
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,475
He stuck me under the shoulder.

84
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:11,413
And then—
then I fell over and—

85
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:14,144
You there! Hold it!
Freeze!

86
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,880
—Hold it! Freeze!
—Sveta!

87
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:18,388
—Stop!
—Sveta!

88
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,889
Easy, grandma.
Just hold on one second.

89
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,653
Okay? Easy. Hold on.

90
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,229
The bastards.
They all got away.

91
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,230
—Come on! Out of the way!
—Come back!

92
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,062
Move it! Make way!

93
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:32,432
Sveta!

94
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,174
—Stop!

95
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,019
Freeze! Don’t move!

96
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,990
Hey!

97
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,341
Don’t!

98
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,879
Stop! No!

99
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,313
Come back here!

100
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:57,081
Come back here!

101
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:05,929
Svetlana!

102
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,996
Come back!

103
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:19,102
Behind you!

104
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,371
Hurry!

105
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,778
Hurry up!

106
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:31,950
Behind you!
Behind—

107
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:45,265
Hold it! Hey!

108
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,965
—Stop!
—No!

109
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,542
—Don’t shoot!
—Wait!

110
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,389
Oh, God.

111
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,393
What’s with this
insubordination, huh?

112
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:13,429
Why did you have to stop me?
I almost had him.

113
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,797
—I’ll deal with him, understand?

114
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,666
How do you know that one?

115
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,136
—I just do.

116
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,139
But He’s a Dark One.

117
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,142
Dark, Light?
Who cares?

118
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:30,610
How did this happen to you, eh?

119
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:35,412
Just a lot of nice people
in the world.

120
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:40,024
“Day Watch” As long as this
ring is on you, you will do as I say.

121
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,615
—It hurts.

122
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:45,287
And is that bad?

123
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,490
Till death do us part.

124
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:55,701
—Sign here, please.
—What is this?

125
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,503
A contract.

126
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,513
—Another one?
—Well, obviously, you haven’t been able to sign one yet.

127
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,639
—Excuse me?
—It’s for the hall.

128
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:10,376
—The cost?
—A thousand … per hour.

129
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:14,380
For this?

130
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,791
You must have no shame at all.

131
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,830
—These are the times we live in.
—Uh-huh. Not for long.

132
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,463
Zavulon!

133
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,235
Yegor?

134
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:36,379
What happened to you?

135
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,745
You said to me that only Great Ones
can go into the second level of Gloom!

136
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:45,421
Give me a weapon!
Give it to me!

137
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,889
A few minutes ago …

138
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,484
near the Expo subway,
a murder was prevented.

139
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:53,256
A Dark One attacked a human
in full public view.

140
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,095
—Did you make an arrest?
—No, we didn’t.

141
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:59,260
—No case, no trial.
—We’ve recovered some physical evidence.

142
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,100
—What kind?

143
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,106
Now you’ve done it.

144
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,677
Who the hell was she?

145
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:10,770
Rogova, do you not tell your students that
committing murder happens to be a crime now?

146
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:12,782
No! No! No way!

147
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:19,019
Where’s your hat?

148
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:24,286
This is it? The best evidence you’ve got?

149
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,296
Yeah.

150
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,230
—What’d he look like?
—Don’t remember.

151
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,234
—You don’t remember, huh?
—No.

152
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:35,067
Okay, let’s give it to the lab and let them worry.

153
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:38,107
—Come on.
—Anton, let me have your car keys, will ya?

154
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,938
Forty-nine years
since I rode the subway.

155
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,537
—Yeah, happy to give’em to you, man.
—I got all day.

156
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:47,009
Here.

157
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,455
And how are you doing, Sveta? You feeling okay?

158
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,922
—Uh-huh.

159
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,254
You need to get something to eat.

160
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,488
Let’s find a restaurant.

161
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:01,121
Why didn’t you tell Semyon
you knew the kid?

162
00:15:02,232 --> 00:15:04,394
So now what do we do?

163
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,116
Where are you going?

164
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,990
If this damn hat’s a problem,
why don’t we just steal it, huh?

165
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:30,528
—Oh, what’s that? Hobo steaks again?

166
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,653
Of course not.
Willing donors.

167
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:35,163
I have a small request.

168
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:39,600
—My son, he just got his first blood license in the mail.
—Congratulations.

169
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:43,639
—But he doesn’t drink.
—By now they’ve already closed the Night Watch lab, Zavulon.

170
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:46,210
—Where do they store the evidence over there?
—In the archive.

171
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,870
You can have until the morning.

172
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,540
—All right. How do you want me to get there?
—Quickly.

173
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,085
Kostya was out,
so I signed for it …

174
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:57,086
but—but I didn’t know.

175
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,451
Is there a way we can
take care of this problem?

176
00:15:59,557 --> 00:16:02,889
—Your son is not a natural <i>Other</i>?
—Um, but, uh—

177
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:06,121
—No. He bit the kid himself.
—Because he had pneumonia, sir—in both lungs!

178
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,198
Guess Mom had pneumonia too.

179
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,528
You bitch!

180
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,698
—I’m sorry.
—It happens.

181
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:23,508
He needs to wait a bit.
You can do that.

182
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:27,072
Yeah? I’ll do anything.

183
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,813
Anything you need.

184
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,423
Anything, hmm?

185
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,515
That would be illegal.

186
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:42,398
You get that?

187
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,767
Get what? The Night Watch archive,
how am I getting the hat?

188
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,203
How? How?

189
00:16:50,307 --> 00:16:52,275
Well, let’s try asking the dad.

190
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:57,076
All right, food folks,
we need something for a growing boy.

191
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,912
All right! On the double!
On the double! Hustle it up now!

192
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:04,086
Here. Bottoms up.

193
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,181
—Drink it.

194
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,424
—Yeah?
—Mr Gorodetsky, I’m Yegor’s teacher, Galina Rogova.

195
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,625
—Your son lost his hat—
—Sorry. Wrong number.

196
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,797
You see hats like that
all over Moscow.

197
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:25,136
Well done.

198
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,575
You’ll go far.

199
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,977
—Diving into the second-level Gloom.
—That’s not much.

200
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,710
—I couldn’t push in there. Barely got my hand in.

201
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:36,286
Can we get a menu
so we can get some food?

202
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:38,287
You ordered already.

203
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:40,788
Hmm. Don’t remember.

204
00:17:40,892 --> 00:17:43,451
Good.

205
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,737
Why are you so … dirty?

206
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,641
You’re worse than me.

207
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,810
It’s Boris Ivanovich.

208
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:16,452
Well, Boris Ivanovich.

209
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:19,461
So, what are you doing?

210
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:23,432
Oh, we’re just sitting here
waiting for our dumplings.

211
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,503
—Don’t you have a lecture?
—Do I?

212
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:31,665
I forgot.
Uh, not tonight then.

213
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:35,268
—Tomorrow. 7:00.
—Mm-hmm.

214
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:43,682
Anton, you understand
that engaging in …

215
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:46,382
—informal relations with trainees is forbidden.

216
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:48,459
Well, it’s a little late
for that. Isn’t it?

217
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,460
—Here you go.
—Thank you.

218
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,223
As-salamu alaykum, Zoar.

219
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,458
Haven’t seen you for a while.

220
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,693
Everything going well for you?

221
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,701
It all goes just as it should.

222
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:02,034
See you later, Zoar.

223
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:10,076
Anton, she’ll soon be a Great One.

224
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:13,776
There is no room for two
Great Ones in this city.

225
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:16,182
You’re talkin’ about me.

226
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:19,119
No, Anton.
I mean your son.

227
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:21,920
If Yegor and Sveta cross paths …

228
00:19:22,026 --> 00:19:24,425
the world will be lost to darkness.

229
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:31,127
Look at you.
You are a Light One …

230
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,203
drinking dark beer.

231
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:37,740
Real nice talk, you know?

232
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:48,012
Go ahead.
Eat, Yegor. Eat.

233
00:19:48,118 --> 00:19:50,747
Tomorrow’s going to be a big day.

234
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:53,085
You’re going to need your strength.

235
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,090
—What’s going on tomorrow?
—Mmm.

236
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,126
We’ll be seeing a lot of guests.

237
00:19:57,228 --> 00:19:59,127
Granny Darya is being released …

238
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,493
so she’ll be there with Mashenka.

239
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:03,567
There will be presents.

240
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,932
So, anything you might like?

241
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,536
—It’s early for this.
—I won’t go.

242
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,640
We won’t force you.

243
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,446
Don’t want that to happen.

244
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,715
“On his deathbed,
Tamerlane told his servants …

245
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:27,814
“to bury him with his fist clenched.

246
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:29,826
His order was carried out.”

247
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:43,132
I need these dumplings
to take away, Zoar.

248
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,141
I’m going home.

249
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:47,676
—These are manti.
—Yeah, whatever.

250
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:52,478
Ah, “The Lives
of Remarkable People.”

251
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:57,748
Mm-hmm.
A remarkable life I’ve got, boy.

252
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:00,016
A son who is dark and unhappy …

253
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,318
and a girlfriend
with more talent than me.

254
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,656
Tamerlane had trouble with his son.

255
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,663
In those days, just how bad could
his problems have really been, huh?

256
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,563
He was killed.

257
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,397
You shouldn’t
drink any more, Anton …

258
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:17,304
—or you’ll really run into trouble.

259
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,842
You have a heart of gold, Zoar.

260
00:21:19,943 --> 00:21:21,775
—What do I owe you?
—A hundred.

261
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:24,211
—Here.

262
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,025
You were warned.

263
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:51,306
“The location of Tamerlane’s burial site …

264
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:53,468
“long remained a mystery.

265
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:57,207
“In 1941,
under Professor Gerasimov …

266
00:21:57,315 --> 00:22:01,375
“an expedition was organized
and went to Samarkand.

267
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:06,013
“But the war interfered, and all the records
of the expedition were scattered …

268
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:10,924
to various archives and research centres
dedicated to Central Asia.”

269
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,189
“Your house is connected.”
What is this nonsense?

270
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,435
Listen, Gorodetsky.

271
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:29,512
Seems your boy is in trouble.

272
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,708
They’ll disintegrate him.

273
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,875
I told you, wrong number.

274
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,819
What a sad excuse for a father.

275
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,790
It’s Yegor’s birthday tomorrow.

276
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,259
Did you remember that?
Huh?

277
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,354
—Get a present.
—Oh, a present?

278
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:50,262
—A hat.
—A head warmer?

279
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,531
Like this one.

280
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,709
You know how many there are
in Moscow like this?

281
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,711
I absolutely can’t help you.

282
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,077
—Can’t or won’t?
—Yeah.

283
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:07,810
—I’ll write to the Inquisition.
—Oh, please. Write who you like.

284
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:14,250
Drop dead, will you?

285
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:26,432
<i>Today we face an extremely strong rival.</i>

286
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:29,131
The entire nation
is watching this match.

287
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,266
Dangerous.
There’s the strike!

288
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:35,140
—Oh!
—And Ovchinnikov makes an amazing save!

289
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,907
Our team makes an immediate
counter-offence.

290
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:40,915
—Long pass.

291
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:44,282
Hey! Hey, come on!

292
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:46,288
Hey!

293
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,518
—<i>Good kick. Goal!</i>

294
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,924
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

295
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:16,477
Two time-outs.
That’s 15 minutes.

296
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:20,284
<i>Archive</i>
And then they take the penalty kicks.

297
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,290
—<i>So we’ve changed the score.</i>
—Goal! Goal! Goal!

298
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:24,292
—The balance has shifted—
—On the attack.

299
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:26,295
and the difference
is a dramatic one.

300
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,742
—Yes! Strike!
—Goal! Yeah!

301
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:53,750
<i>This is the turning point.</i>

302
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:57,555
<i>The main thing now is not
to go back to defence but attack!</i>

303
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,221
<i>And attack with great care.
Both these teams are strong.</i>

304
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,679
<i>Around back! There’s the strike!
It’s in! Goal!</i>

305
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:35,387
<i>“Central Asia, Special Vault.”</i>

306
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:48,911
<i>“Chalk of Fate”</i>

307

but you and me as well.</i>

316
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:33,816
—<i>It’s a great moment for us!</i>

317
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,006
Oh, you’re good.

318
00:27:07,357 --> 00:27:10,849
He gave me such a look, Alicia.
It scared the hell out of me.

319
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:13,361
—You mean no one’s covering you?
—I’m alone.

320
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:16,193
—Want me to come over?
—Thank you, but I’ll be all right.

321
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:18,200
—You be careful, okay?

322
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:21,237
Hello? Galya?
What is it?

323
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:24,330
Oh, sorry.
I’m just so exhausted.

324
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:28,138
—Call me later?
—You call me.

325
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:31,373
Yeah.
I need to get home.

326
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,349
Galina!

327
00:27:37,454 --> 00:27:39,355
Who’s there?

328
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:42,515
Enough with the jokes.

329
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,923
Who is this?

330
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,519
A judge.

331
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,997
Yes? And who would be on trial?

332
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,592
—You are.

333
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,440
This is 741.

334
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:07,409
Forensic team is on the scene.
Paramedics are gone.

335
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,979
They left a report.

336
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:13,208
Galya! Galya! Galya!

337
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:15,478
—Let me through!
—Let’s set up as close as we can.

338
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:18,316
—She’s my daughter!
—I’m sorry, but this area is closed.

339
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,321
—The team is working.

340
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:51,778
There are no wounds in evidence.
Why would you think it’s a homicide?

341
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:53,480
We know who killed the woman.

342
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:02,994
Let me tell you where you’re going to go!
Do you understand what I’m saying?

343
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:06,160
—Quit arguing! Go get me Zavulon!
—He’s unavailable.

344
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:08,635
—Did you tell him it was me?
—I did.

345
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:12,538
—Who’s with him?
—He can’t be disturbed.

346
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:16,398
You can’t go in there! No!

347
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:27,838
I did what you asked. You said you would help.

348
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:31,115
Go on to work. I’ll tell you
what to do next tonight.

349
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:37,792
—Hello.
—Don’t you worry about a thing.

350
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:48,128
Ever heard of knocking?
You might try it.

351
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:01,016
Oh, well, look who’s here!

352
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:03,347
You know, for some reason,
I can’t seem to get hold …

353
00:32:03,453 --> 00:32:05,819
—of your girlfriend, what’s her name.
—Rogova is dead.

354
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:14,988
Bastard!

355
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:19,368
You know who did it?

356
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,440
The man’s gone totally insane.

357
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,305
Galina met with Gorodetsky.

358
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:29,641
Evidence is what we need
to prove it.

359
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,714
—You think—
—Now get some!

360
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:34,916
—All right, I—
—Go now!

361
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:43,125
Can I take the wheels?

362
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,794

Ready?

378
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:05,407
Enough. What’s the deal?
Have a bad night?

379
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:08,739
—Are my eyes red?
—Mm-hmm. Come on.
We are going to see Gesser.

380
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,041
—Why?
—Come on. Come on. Move. Move.

381
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,945
There is a major influx
of Dark Ones in the city.

382
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,954
Checking by districts, we’re done
in Dimitrovka, Yaroslavka and Fili.

383
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:22,617
But, uh, in Bibirevo, uh,
we haven’t, uh—

384
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:25,126
—we haven’t gotten—
—Start.

385
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:27,253
a start yet.

386
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:30,800
No start yet. We simply don’t have
enough men to cover it.

387
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,425
—How’s it going?
—Shh.

388
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:36,994
There are just too many
of these Dark Ones gathering.

389
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:39,268
It’s getting dark during the day.

390
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:42,344
They are getting ready
for something big.

391
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:46,576
Ilya, do you remember Galina Rogova?

392
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:49,344
—Rogova?
—Yes, Rogova.

393
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:53,719
My opinion is, um, sHe’s dangerous.

394
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,452
—She could, uh, shatter the Truce.
—No, not anymore.

395
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,427
This morning Galina Rogova
was found dead.

396
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,126
She was discovered
in the hallway of her apartment.

397
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:10,164
There were no wounds anywhere.

398
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:14,175
Apparent cause of death:
total removal of life force.

399
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:41,032
Uh, all right, young lady,
use care now.

400
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:43,572
What’s she called?

401
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,807
Mashenka.

402
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,572
Masha Rogova.

403
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,581
This man familiar?

404
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,311
Uh, no.

405
00:35:56,586 --> 00:36:01,023
If you will allow it,
I am going to talk with Masha.

406
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:09,996
—Hello, Mashenka.
—Hi.

407
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:12,967
Oh, that’s a nice turtle.

408
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,902
He’s almost like a real one.

409
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:18,405
Do you know who this is?

410
00:36:19,509 --> 00:36:21,476
N—No.

411
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:26,740
Your mama is gone.

412
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:28,612
My mama is gone.

413
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,246
She went on a long trip.

414
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,320
Your mama didn’t go anywhere, honey.

415
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:41,396
Your mama is dead.

416
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:46,298
What do you mean, dead?

417
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,393
She’s dead and gone.

418
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,777
Grandma! Grandma!

419
00:36:54,878 --> 00:36:57,438
Ah, now what’s the matter?
What is it, dear?

420
00:36:57,547 --> 00:37:02,483
Grandma, Mama is dead.
Mama is dead and gone forever.

421
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:05,418
Oh, my poor darling angel.

422
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:07,489
Where did you hear that, huh?

423
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,717
The lady told me it was true.

424
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,059
What lady?
There’s no one here.

425
00:37:16,233 --> 00:37:18,496
Oh, my dear.

426
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:22,298
It was your mama, wasn’t it?
She came to say good-bye.

427
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:26,264
The bottom line is that
we’re being accused …

428
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:30,710
of a situation
which is … unfortunate.

429
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,907
A Light Other who either
doesn’t know that there is a truce …

430
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:37,349
or worse, is ignoring it.

431
00:37:40,657 --> 00:37:44,615
This is the state we find ourselves in.
Have a question?

432
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:47,929
No?

433
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,695
Thank you. You’re all free to go,
except for Semyon, Olga …

434
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:56,603
Ilya … and Anton.

435
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:02,668
Thank you for the compliment,
Boris Ivanovich.

436
00:38:12,222 --> 00:38:15,157
I have to conduct
an inside investigation.

437
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:21,898
Write your reports.

438
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:26,402
Where you were that night and …

439
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,530
whether your alibis
can be confirmed or not.

440
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,300
Ha!

441
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,652
Can I have the ball?

442
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,728
Come on.

443
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:55,389
—What is your major?
—Biology.

444
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:58,092
Mm-hmm.

445
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:01,364
Not drinking human blood,
is that what you study?

446
00:39:10,246 --> 00:39:12,771
You’re really kind of cute.

447
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:14,851
Shame you’re a vampire.

448
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:17,112
We might have been friends.

449
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:19,210
So you think we won’t?

450
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:21,516
Okay, maybe.

451
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:28,025
Easy there.
Tell me a story.

452
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,692
Your friend next door,
he around lately?

453
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:36,269
Why do you say He’s my friend?

454
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:39,206
—Come on back!
—Hey, I really can’t judge you.

455
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,800
—You can do whatever you want to do.
—Let’s go!

456
00:39:41,911 --> 00:39:44,072
You’re a Dark Other.

457
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,307
You could even make friends
with Light Ones.

458
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,248
Thank you, miss.
Your humour’s interesting.

459
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:55,255
You got the ball. Come on.

460
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,724
Last night, Galina Rogova
was killed at her home.

461
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:04,592
What’s that got to do with me?

462
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,329
Her daughter is five years old.

463
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,641
Kostya, we’re waiting!
Come on!

464
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:17,702
I saw her last night
talking to Gorodetsky.

465
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:21,079
Give us the ball at least!

466
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:23,083
Thank you.

467
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:26,621
Kostya!

468
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:28,690
<i>Boris Moiseyev</i>

469
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:40,391
—What have you got?
—Last night she met Gorodetsky.

470
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:42,438
—How did you find that out?
—A witness.

471
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:47,032
Hmm. Vampire Junior.

472
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,271
How did you know that?

473
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:52,007
Why don’t you come on over?
I miss you.

474
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,117
—Send Gorodetsky in.

475
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:02,157
When they killed Rogova,
Gorodetsky was in the archive.

476
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,625
—Hmm.
—Yes?

477
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,992
So he has an alibi.

478
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:11,795
—But he won’t confess to it, and quite right.
—Mm-hmm.

479
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:16,635
And so we’ll have no choice
but to turn him over to the Dark Ones.

480
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:20,175
What will they do with him?

481
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,677
I don’t know,
but they won’t get him alive.

482
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:24,679
—You’ve thought of something?

483
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,181
—Yes!

484
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:33,552
—Olga, have you seen the boss?
—Sit down.

485
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,199
Mmm.

486
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:56,373
I’m sorry, Olga.
I have to do this.

487
00:41:56,478 --> 00:41:58,878
—What?
—I know you do.

488
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:00,882
Well, I don’t.
But the problem—

489
00:42:47,896 --> 00:42:51,230
Are you completely out of your mind?

490
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,590
I’m sorry.

491
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:20,822
Anton, you never
would’ve agreed to it.

492
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:07,237
Anton.

493
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:11,480
It’ll be all right.

494
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:17,150
I need Gesser for a minute.

495
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:19,686
Get lost, you and Gesser.

496
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,054
Anton, no one gave you
permission to leave.

497
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,721
—What do we do with the voice?
—Not a problem.

498
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,923
Should be working. Give it a try.

499
00:44:30,032 --> 00:44:32,557
—Olga!
—Yes? Yes?

500
00:44:32,668 --> 00:44:34,603
Yes. Hmm. Great. Now I’m a tranny.

501
00:44:34,704 --> 00:44:36,695
You don’t like it?

502
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,070
How do you walk?
These are important details.

503
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:42,076
Anton, remember, I don’t smoke.

504
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:44,737
—Look, you’ve smudged your makeup already.
—I’ll manage.

505
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,748
Pay attention.
Nothing in your pockets.

506
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:49,682
That’s why you carry a bag.
Another thing—

507
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:52,186
You’re a woman now.
You need to keep your back straight.

508
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:54,255
Then why is my ass wiggling?

509
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:56,518
—Reflex reactions.
—You!

510
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:59,059
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

511
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:01,061
—Boris Ivanovich.
—Ilya, hello.

512
00:45:01,164 --> 00:45:03,063
—See you later.
—I was trying to, uh—

513
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:05,134
—Nothing to worry about.
—Nothing.

514
00:45:06,702 --> 00:45:10,730
—How long do I do this?
—Two or three days. Until we find the killer.

515
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,275
—So where do I stay?
—Work something out. Call one of the guys.

516
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:17,072
Hey, look, Semyon.
Semyon, hey, can I crash with you?

517
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:19,079
—Okay. Starting—
—Today.

518
00:45:19,181 --> 00:45:21,081
—Oh.
—No, no, no. Forget it.

519
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:22,445
—Boris.
—Sorry.

520
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:25,487
—We could try Svetlana, eh?
—Good idea.

521
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:29,684
—What do I say?
—Say that Boris Ivanovich
has a snoring problem.

522
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,490
Hold on!
Do I snore?

523
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,291
To sum up …

524
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:43,269
you have all now
learned the technique …

525
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:48,572
of detecting objects
hidden from us behind a barrier.

526
00:45:52,248 --> 00:45:54,239
Svetlana …

527
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:56,250
show us the miracle of enteroscopy.

528
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,615
Tell us who is at the door.

529
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:02,315
—It’s Anton Gorodetsky.

530
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,195
Hello.

531
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,856
Excuse the interruption.

532
00:46:09,965 --> 00:46:12,490
Please, Olga, not at all.

533
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:15,264
We’re privileged that you join us.

534
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:18,601
—Thank you.
—We’re studying the basics of enteroscopy.

535
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:23,509
—Since you’re here, maybe you’ll show
us a demonstration?
—Um—

536
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:25,637
—Just a small one.
—Well, timing’s not good now.

537
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:28,045
Just something. Anything.
It would mean a great deal to us.

538
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:32,485
—Really. Sorry. Now’s not good
for me. I’m here for Sveta—uh—

539
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:34,818
You smoke now?

540
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:38,188
—Excuse me.

541
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:42,458
Poor Svetlana.
What’s she going to do with him now?

542
00:46:49,271 --> 00:46:52,365
—Thank you. Let’s go.

543
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,219
—Pretty soon Anton should be here.
—He’s not coming.

544
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,585
—How do you know?
—He got stuck somewhere.

545
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,123
We were supposed to meet here
and go to a restaurant.

546
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:13,353
No time for that now.
I’ll tell you why later.

547
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:48,096
Uh, I have a question for you.

548
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:50,688
Mm-hmm?
Yeah, ask me.

549
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,132
How much do you like Anton?

550
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,275
You like him?

551
00:48:07,382 --> 00:48:09,543
He’s a little
strange sometimes—

552
00:48:09,652 --> 00:48:13,485
as if he were afraid of me.

553
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:17,190
Not as a woman, you know.

554
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:21,588
And not so much, uh, afraid.

555
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:23,791
—He just—
—Maintains his distance?

556
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,061
Uh, yeah.

557
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:29,161
Something like that.

558
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,175
—No surprise there.

559
00:48:34,277 --> 00:48:36,177
You’re destined
to become a great witch …

560
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:39,737
and He’s category three,
at a stretch.

561
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:42,750
I don’t care what his category is.

562
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:46,583
It’s all the same to me
as a woman. I love him.

563
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:50,786
Olga!

564
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:13,538
—Careful there.

565
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,550
You be careful!
You’re insane!

566
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:20,146
Look, I really know it’s none of my business,
but when you take a look at it, it’s obvious.

567
00:49:20,255 --> 00:49:23,123
I think he loves you
very, very much.

568
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:27,184
A lot! He’s just afraid—
afraid that one day there’ll come a time …

569
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,958
when you’ll be too far away
for anything to happen.

570
00:49:30,065 --> 00:49:32,864
Okay, yes, it’s possible.
Someday something could happen …

571
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,869
but right now,
in the present, I’m here!

572
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,166
Come on, Sveta.
Can’t you see that time is now?

573
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:39,297
It’s now.

574
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,400
Ladies, you all right?
We’ll be there in a minute.

575
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:44,742
—Stay right where you are.
We’re on our way.

576
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:48,273
Come on.
Let’s go.

577
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:52,547
Then at night I called him.
Come in.

578
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:55,146
He wasn’t home.

579
00:49:55,257 --> 00:49:57,452
I called his mobile,
and he hung up on me.

580
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,755
—Not important.

581
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:03,559
—So maybe he was busy.
—Or maybe he has someone.

582
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,793
He hasn’t had anyone for 12 years.

583
00:50:08,304 --> 00:50:13,003
Really? Then He’s got
some kind of complex.

584
00:50:13,108 --> 00:50:15,373
“Bio-complex.

585
00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:19,039
“Amazing natural way to enhance
all of your health characteristics …

586
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:21,047
and sex drive.”

587
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,050
—Here.
—Thanks.

588
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:27,516
Why are you looking at me?

589
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:31,525
I’m going to have a shower.
Would you put on the kettle?

590
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:34,356
Why hasn’t he had
a girlfriend for 12 years?

591
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:36,431
Bad time.

592
00:50:40,402 --> 00:50:43,235
Strange.

593
00:51:01,456 --> 00:51:03,425
Really. Why?

594
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:15,903
Sveta, listen.

595
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,771
Oh, God, how can I
possibly explain it?

596
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:24,847
Olga.

597
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:29,916
—Sometimes life throws a curve—
—Olga.

598
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:33,010
—and then everything is changed forever.
—Olga!

599
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:35,021
—Why forever?
—Olga!

600
00:51:35,123 --> 00:51:36,751
Huh?

601
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:39,349
Bring me a towel, please.
They’re in the cupboard.

602
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,106
—Not Olga.
—What?

603
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,570
What did you say?
I can’t hear you.

604
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:34,447
What are you doing?

605
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,710
Not Olga. Anton.
I love you.

606
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,755
What is it?

607
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,724
What are you doing?

608
00:52:50,498 --> 00:52:52,432
Not Olga. Anton.

609
00:52:52,534 --> 00:52:55,561
They switched our bodies.

610
00:52:59,942 --> 00:53:01,876
How dare you do this to me,
you bastard!

611
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:05,606
What made you think you could do a thing
like this to me now? I want you out!

612
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,878
You hear me? Out of my house!
How could you take advantage of me like this?

613
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,920
You—I don’t ever want
to see your face again!

614
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:14,045
You’re a real bastard!

615
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,885
Are you crazy? Get out!
Just get out of here now!

616
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:13,246
—Whoa!

617
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:15,543
— … nowhere near his best today.
—Oh!

618
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,550
Sergei Federov is not at his best.

619
00:54:17,652 --> 00:54:19,643
He’s got possession of the puck,
goes for the pass.

620
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:21,619
No, no, no!
Come on! Come on!

621
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:23,623
Pass back.
Markov grabs it.

622
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:26,092
Clear ice.
Body check.

623
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:29,164
—Oh!
—No flag on that play.

624
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:31,733
<i>Our team is taking
some big risks out there.</i>

625
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,701
—Come on! Come on! Go, go!
—No!

626
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,635
—You morons.

627
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:39,798
—What are they doing? They’re not thinking.

628
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,967
You should show this body
a little care.

629
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:44,672
What am I doing that’s bad?
I’m making sure it gets food.

630
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,943
<i> … Lines up and shoots.
No goal. Puck’s back in play.</i>

631
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:50,347
Each ounce of extra weight on her …

632
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,943
she’ll remove a full pound
of flesh from you.

633
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:04,123
That lock doesn’t work.

634
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:11,697
Gonna say hi?

635
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,311
Hi there, vampy.

636
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:27,721
—Yes, yes, yes!
—Look at that shot! It’s amazing! Look at this!

637
00:55:27,822 --> 00:55:30,552
That was a game! Ah!

638
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:34,925
Amazing how men will think of
anything not to keep a promise.

639
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,521
What do you mean?

640
00:55:37,632 --> 00:55:40,898
We made serious plans to go
to a restaurant.

641
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:43,903
Slapshot. Almost another goal.

642
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:47,771
—I’m not allowed. <i>That
was close. Not a very pleasing moment—</i>

643
00:56:10,965 --> 00:56:13,456
I need your son.

644
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:16,197
Uh, Kostya.

645
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:29,309
—Hi there, Kostya.
—Yeah, hi.

646
00:56:29,418 --> 00:56:31,146
Come.

647
00:56:32,253 --> 00:56:34,552
Uh, who’s this?

648
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,318
Papa, no.

649
00:56:56,612 --> 00:57:00,240
Have you seen Gorodetsky?
Because we can’t find him.

650
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,818
Too bad.

651
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,320
We think he switched bodies
with a young lady.

652
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:13,954
It’s really amazing
what people get up to.

653
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,092
To you. May you get out of
this mess as soon as possible.

654
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,590
Look, a Dark One.

655
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,240
What kind of Dark is he?

656
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:06,172
That boy at the Expo Centre,
he means a lot to you, doesn’t he?

657
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,181
You help him so much.

658
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,581
Are you trying to break me down?

659
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:13,887
Once again
I see what you are—

660
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:15,889
an idiot.

661
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:24,898
Off to suck someone’s blood …

662
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:28,960
and say a few incantations.

663
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:37,340
What do you want?

664
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:44,378
Would you know him
in a different body?

665
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:49,880
Hmm. Don’t know.

666
00:58:49,992 --> 00:58:51,960
Haven’t tried it.

667
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,896
Mine, for example.

668
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,637
Mean something?

669
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:57,188
Yeah. And this car is unreal.

670
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,126
I’m going.

671
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:07,599
—I need a minute.
—Don’t mix up the doors.

672
01:00:07,702 --> 01:00:10,797
The one with the boy’s
picture on it—not for you.

673
01:00:10,905 --> 01:00:13,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
01:00:18,947 --> 01:00:22,110
Oh! Damn it.

675
01:00:41,235 --> 01:00:42,396
They set me up.

676
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,653
—Good work, Anton.
Now they have the proof they want.

677
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:04,885
I didn’t do it.
It’s a coincidence.

678
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:07,052
It’s not a coincidence.
It’s a frame-up.

679
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:11,992
But Anton wasn’t there.

680
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,001
You shouldn’t have left the house.
You shouldn’t have been there.

681
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:24,077
Now they have the opportunity …

682
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:26,704
to do whatever they want with you.

683
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:35,083
Why aren’t we moving?

684
01:01:47,702 --> 01:01:50,762
—Next time say “please”.
—Zavulon!

685
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:14,822
I’m listening, Zavulon.

686
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:18,626
I am bringing a formal
charge of murder …

687
01:02:18,733 --> 01:02:20,998
against the Night Watch agent …

688
01:02:24,672 --> 01:02:27,574
Anton Gorodetsky.

689
01:02:27,675 --> 01:02:29,643
Are you?

690
01:02:29,744 --> 01:02:32,804
—Well, maybe we can find him.
—Oh, we’ll take him right now.

691
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:35,280
He’s not here.

692
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,820
The one we accuse
of committing murder …

693
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,322
is in the body of that young woman.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

695
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:47,822
You don’t have
the right to interfere.

696
01:02:47,929 --> 01:02:50,989
Stop this! Why aren’t you
doing anything?

697
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:54,932
Why? Why aren’t you doing anything?

698
01:03:15,056 --> 01:03:17,047
—No!
—That’s enough!

699
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:19,059
Listen to me.
We cannot interfere.

700
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:21,425
If you break the Truce,
they’ll kill you.

701
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,498
It will achieve nothing.

702
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,532
Line 22.

703
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:28,398
—Why is the trolley here?

704
01:04:35,804 --> 01:04:37,293
You have to stop this!

705
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:56,456
Step on it. Step on it. Come on.

706
01:04:56,557 --> 01:04:58,617
Let’s go.

707
01:05:00,027 --> 01:05:01,996

01:05:43,237 --> 01:05:45,831
If you can’t prove
before dawn …

710
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:50,434
that Gorodetsky is innocent in regard
to the deaths of the Dark Ones …

711
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:53,536
providing suitable evidence …

712
01:06:03,724 --> 01:06:06,023
we will issue a warrant …

713
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:09,291
for his elimination.

714
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:14,164

I’m writing an official
note of protest.

If you refuse to comply
with this order …

719
01:06:36,657 --> 01:06:38,557
the result will be war.

720
01:06:38,659 --> 01:06:42,186
This is a provocation
by the Day Watch.

721
01:06:42,297 --> 01:06:46,255
The Supreme Powers will not
be on your side in this.

722
01:06:46,367 --> 01:06:50,394
The charges brought by
the Day Watch are quite real.

723
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:53,838
Your protest will be turned down.

—Of course.

01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:21,792
Hmm. We should let the parrot fly.

—Mm-hmm. I need it.
—My body’s not good enough for you?

—What’s this?
—It’s a belt.

01:10:29,591 --> 01:10:32,617
No, it’s not.
It’s a weapon.

Purpose of visit?

767
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:38,498

Uzbek capital. And listen.

—Right. Yeah, yeah.

01:13:05,042 --> 01:13:07,601

No.

811
01:13:48,385 --> 01:13:52,115
Once a man of ours
found himself in danger.

812
01:13:53,224 --> 01:13:56,158
And he broke the Truce.

813
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:58,159
And …

814
01:13:58,261 --> 01:14:02,426
when he found himself
facing the inevitable punishment …

815
01:14:02,533 --> 01:14:06,492
there was a girl who tried to help him
in this, much as she could.

816
01:14:08,271 --> 01:14:11,729
Oh. It was Olga.

817
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:14,572
Later he was acquitted, and …

818
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:16,872
the Inquisition let him go.

819
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:21,440
—But the witch—
—Hasn’t changed at all.

very greatly just then—

821
01:14:26,323 --> 01:14:28,291
she was sentenced.

Boris Ivanovich.

824
01:14:37,935 --> 01:14:40,061
She was the real target …

825
01:14:41,104 --> 01:14:43,300
and I was only the bait.

826
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:45,636
She was the Great One.

827
01:14:46,676 --> 01:14:49,372
The Chalk isn’t in Tamerlane’s tomb.

828
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,041
How do you know?
Have you been there?

829
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:57,609
In ’41, Boris had problems,
and I needed the Chalk.

830
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:02,055
I arranged with archaeologists to organize
an expedition and went with them.

831
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:07,095
In Samarkand, an old man
came to me called Zoar.

832
01:15:07,197 --> 01:15:11,224
He said if we opened the tomb,
it would start a war.

833
01:15:12,903 --> 01:15:18,068
But I knew that I would have the Chalk
and I could change everything.

834
01:15:18,175 --> 01:15:20,609
When we opened the tomb,
there was an inscription.

835
01:15:21,878 --> 01:15:24,313
“I held the whole world
in my hand …

836
01:15:24,414 --> 01:15:27,578
but I can’t take it
where I’m going.”

837
01:15:27,685 --> 01:15:29,983
The Chalk was not in his right hand.

838
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:38,855
—What was Zoar doing?
—He worked in the government.

840
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:43,057
And with Tamerlane?

841
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:46,796
Pretty much the same thing.
Zoar as right-hand man.

842
01:15:52,509 --> 01:15:55,171
Right-hand man?

843
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:57,247
Oh, Zoar.

844
01:16:00,516 --> 01:16:02,484

845
01:16:02,586 --> 01:16:04,554
—Olga.
—Hmm?

846
01:16:04,654 --> 01:16:08,216
Let’s turn the plane around.
I know where the Chalk is.

847
01:16:08,324 --> 01:16:10,292

851
01:16:38,087 --> 01:16:40,921

I mean the magic Chalk.

852
01:16:41,024 --> 01:16:43,550
It’s the magic Chalk.

853
01:16:46,462 --> 01:16:49,158
—And where do the markings go?
—Well, here.

854
01:16:49,265 --> 01:16:51,597
—On the blackboard.
—And does it work?

855
01:16:51,702 --> 01:16:53,931
Every day.

856
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:00,510

01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,408

01:18:04,942 --> 01:18:06,966
The Chalk. The Chalk.
It worked!

866
01:18:07,077 --> 01:18:09,045
What a blessing
that you’ve come back.

867
01:18:09,145 --> 01:18:11,579
Wait. Why are you so cold?
You’re frozen.

868
01:18:11,681 --> 01:18:14,582
Now wait. Wait a second. Come on.
We’ll get you something to eat.

869
01:18:14,685 --> 01:18:17,085
That’ll warm you up.

870
01:18:17,186 --> 01:18:20,179
Zoar, get me something good and hot,
because I have a son today!

871
01:18:20,289 --> 01:18:23,020
Oh, sit. Sit. Sit down.
Please sit down. It really worked.

872
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:28,186
Maybe we should
wash your trousers too.

873
01:18:28,297 --> 01:18:30,765
Then what am I going to wear?

874
01:18:30,868 --> 01:18:34,599
—Hmm?
—And where are you going
to this time of night, huh?

875
01:18:34,704 --> 01:18:36,832
No. Go away. Go away.

876
01:18:36,939 --> 01:18:39,238
—Go away. I’m busy.
—What, are you ticklish?

877
01:19:12,242 --> 01:19:14,141
—Oh.

878
01:19:14,243 --> 01:19:18,543
Excuse me. I’m sorry to bother you,
but I’m looking for your neighbour.

879
01:19:20,184 --> 01:19:22,345
You’re not alone.

880
01:19:25,988 --> 01:19:28,287
Thank you.

881
01:19:33,130 --> 01:19:35,564
You have to be careful, Svetlana.

882
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,967
A vampire?

883
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:43,404
Yes, I’m a vampire!

884
01:19:43,506 --> 01:19:45,167
That’s me!

885
01:19:47,644 --> 01:19:50,442
Excuse him. Please.
Really. No laws are being broken.

886
01:19:50,546 --> 01:19:53,037
—I’m not accusing you of anything.
—Look.

887
01:19:53,149 --> 01:19:55,243
—I-I’m not.
—We have the registration.

888
01:19:55,351 --> 01:19:57,252
—I’m not accusing you.
—Here is a permit, see?

889
01:19:57,354 --> 01:19:59,219
And everything in
the fridge is good.

890
01:19:59,323 --> 01:20:00,756
—There’s some cheese, milk.
—I’m sorry.

891
01:20:00,856 --> 01:20:02,551
—Potatoes.
—Papa, go inside.

892
01:20:02,658 --> 01:20:04,889
—Don’t do this to yourself!.
—Kostya! Kostya!

893
01:20:16,006 --> 01:20:18,530
—Hello?
—Hello. Anton?

894
01:20:20,476 --> 01:20:22,604
—Who is it?
—It’s me, Svetlana.

895
01:20:22,712 --> 01:20:26,546
Svetlana. You know he has a family.

896
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:29,484
A son.

897
01:20:29,586 --> 01:20:31,712
Please don’t call him anymore.

898
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:01,516
Riceplov.
You eat it with your hands.

899
01:21:08,257 --> 01:21:10,225
You like it?

900
01:21:10,327 --> 01:21:12,921
Uh, Papa, will you
come and eat with us?

901
01:21:13,029 --> 01:21:17,363
—And who would that be?
—With me … and Mom.

902
01:21:17,466 --> 01:21:19,765
—Yegor, I can’t come with you.

903
01:21:19,869 --> 01:21:23,270
I have another … Life.

904
01:21:25,042 --> 01:21:26,975
—Yegor, understand—

905
01:21:28,878 --> 01:21:31,472
You’ll come anyway!

906
01:21:56,605 --> 01:21:59,039
Zoar, why didn’t it work for me?

907
01:21:59,141 --> 01:22:01,076
I put it where you told me to.

908
01:22:01,177 --> 01:22:04,806
This is the place
where my fate happens.

909
01:22:04,914 --> 01:22:08,145
Plov—that’s 150 roubles.

910
01:22:08,251 --> 01:22:11,583
And your fate is somewhere else.

911
01:22:11,688 --> 01:22:15,317
You can’t change
the fate of another.

912
01:22:15,425 --> 01:22:19,054
Every living person
must answer for his own.

913
01:22:19,162 --> 01:22:22,131
Do you remember where it was …

914
01:22:22,231 --> 01:22:24,826
you broke your own destiny?

915
01:22:26,703 --> 01:22:29,899
You waited … till now to say this?

916
01:22:30,006 --> 01:22:32,530
You didn’t ask.

917
01:22:34,411 --> 01:22:36,310
And so it’s my fault?

918
01:22:36,412 --> 01:22:38,846
I am sorry, Anton.

919
01:22:39,882 --> 01:22:41,850
What’s the matter?

920
01:22:47,189 --> 01:22:50,454
He took the Chalk.

921
01:23:05,742 --> 01:23:08,073
—Hello.
—Sorry. Uh, I know it’s late …

922
01:23:08,177 --> 01:23:11,578
—but could I speak with Yegor?
—Are you crazy?

923
01:23:14,216 --> 01:23:18,153
It’s 1:00 in the morning.
Yegor’s asleep.

924
01:23:45,715 --> 01:23:47,682
Listen. Can you take me
to the Expo Centre?

925
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:01,261
Zavulon! We found him!

926
01:24:01,363 --> 01:24:04,162
Go on! Finish him off!

927
01:24:04,266 --> 01:24:06,929
You idiots! I need him alive.

928
01:24:07,037 --> 01:24:11,302
Just run him around
for a while, okay?

929
01:24:44,975 --> 01:24:47,136
—Anton.
—Boris, I’ll look over this way.

930
01:24:47,243 --> 01:24:49,144
Is anyone here? Anton.

931
01:24:51,247 --> 01:24:52,840
Zoar?

932
01:24:52,948 --> 01:24:54,472
There isn’t anyone here.

933
01:24:56,485 --> 01:24:59,011
—What’s that?
—I think it’s his phone.

934
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:01,484
But why is it broken?

935
01:25:01,591 --> 01:25:04,150
The Dark Ones want the Chalk too.

936
01:25:04,261 --> 01:25:05,591
The big game begins.

937
01:25:26,882 --> 01:25:28,372
<i>9th Legion</i>

938
01:25:48,671 --> 01:25:51,970
What do you think you’re doing?

939
01:25:52,074 --> 01:25:54,042
What station is this?

940
01:26:00,516 --> 01:26:02,279
I’m gone.

941
01:26:14,396 --> 01:26:17,389
Okay. What’s going on?
Stay there!

942
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:18,831
I mean it!

943
01:26:18,935 --> 01:26:20,231
Stay there!

944
01:26:20,337 --> 01:26:21,667
Freeze!

945
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,136
Don’t move!
Don’t move!

946
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,140
Stop!

947
01:26:38,954 --> 01:26:41,822
Who was it you spoke to?

948
01:26:41,925 --> 01:26:44,587
I don’t know. They told me
not to call there again.

949
01:26:44,694 --> 01:26:45,682
Yegor.

950
01:26:47,096 --> 01:26:49,030
—Why was he here?
—The Chalk’s with him.

951
01:27:01,043 --> 01:27:04,444
—What is it?
—What?

952
01:27:04,546 --> 01:27:07,015
Just a sec.

953
01:27:08,818 --> 01:27:11,012
—Remember Yegor’s address?
—Got it.

954
01:27:11,121 --> 01:27:13,020
—Then let’s go.
—Right.

955
01:27:13,122 --> 01:27:15,148
—Please get her.
—Sveta.

956
01:27:19,194 --> 01:27:21,856
—Sveta?

957
01:27:27,136 --> 01:27:29,502
Flushed out.

958
01:27:56,865 --> 01:27:58,833
Wanted to get out of the cold, huh?

959
01:28:02,204 --> 01:28:04,502
Take me anywhere.

960
01:28:05,608 --> 01:28:08,076
Sure thing.

961
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,256
Uncle Zavulon,
why are we the Dark Ones?

962
01:28:55,358 --> 01:28:58,815
Imperfections are hidden
in darkness, Yegor.

963
01:29:00,296 --> 01:29:02,695
And people …

964
01:29:02,798 --> 01:29:05,131
always have their imperfections.

965
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:12,605
It allows us the luxury
of doing what we want.

966
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:16,904
Of being exactly who we truly are.

967
01:29:17,947 --> 01:29:20,939
Gives us the gift of love.

968
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:30,184
Look what I found, Uncle Zavulon.

969
01:29:30,292 --> 01:29:31,920
The Chalk of Fate.

970
01:29:37,533 --> 01:29:39,057
—Hello.
—Zavulon.

971
01:29:39,168 --> 01:29:41,136
—What now?
—Have you got the Chalk?

972
01:29:41,237 --> 01:29:42,863
No.

973
01:29:44,774 --> 01:29:48,368
—You do not have the right to touch it.
—I know that.

974
01:29:48,478 --> 01:29:51,105
So, what’s up with your shindig?

975
01:29:51,213 --> 01:29:54,944
—You are inviting me?
—No, but I’ll take some pictures.

976
01:29:57,220 --> 01:30:00,018
Slow down, Semyon.

977
01:30:00,122 --> 01:30:03,854
I want you to get everyone
over to the Hotel Cosmos.

978
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,224
—Where are you going?
—Ah, I need to change.

979
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:12,734
Alicia.

980
01:30:12,836 --> 01:30:16,430
You could correct your mistakes with it.

981
01:30:16,538 --> 01:30:19,667
—No. Why don’t you keep it?
—What about you?

982
01:30:19,775 --> 01:30:23,337
—I don’t need it.
—In your whole life, no errors were made?

983
01:30:23,445 --> 01:30:26,471
—I just don’t regret them.
—Then what should I do with it?

984
01:30:26,582 --> 01:30:28,516
You could give it to Alicia.

985
01:30:32,588 --> 01:30:34,556
What does she regret?

986
01:30:36,292 --> 01:30:38,260
What do women normally regret?

987
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:42,962
Loving wrong.

988
01:30:53,877 --> 01:30:55,845
Sure you’re making
the right decision?

989
01:30:55,944 --> 01:31:00,404
I just can’t live like this, scared to death
of shadows, fearing every phone call.

990
01:31:00,515 --> 01:31:02,484
Not me.

991
01:31:03,819 --> 01:31:06,050
I’m not afraid of anybody.

992
01:31:14,764 --> 01:31:17,528
Even if you’re like us,
you’re still a human being.

993
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:22,899
Human, Papa?

994
01:31:26,009 --> 01:31:27,976
Can you turn me back into a human?

995
01:31:31,747 --> 01:31:33,806
No. No.

996
01:31:33,917 --> 01:31:36,442
But listen.

997
01:31:40,323 --> 01:31:43,224
Son. Son!

998
01:31:43,326 --> 01:31:46,318
Listen here.
Wait a minute.

999
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:23,126
—Alicia, are you coming?
—Yes.

1000
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:25,324
—We’re starting.
—On my way.

1001
01:32:25,435 --> 01:32:27,493
And don’t fiddle with the ring.
It hurts.

1002
01:32:37,747 --> 01:32:39,715
Kostya.

1003
01:32:46,122 --> 01:32:48,582
Why did you come here?

1004
01:32:49,818 --> 01:32:52,412
Not welcome?

1005
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,046
You are.
Close the door.

1006
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:06,997
—Hello.
—Hello.

1007
01:33:08,569 --> 01:33:10,697
I’m going to take you from here.

1008
01:33:21,082 --> 01:33:23,073
Zavulon.

1009
01:33:24,118 --> 01:33:25,916
—Coming.

1010
01:33:27,021 --> 01:33:28,989
—I said—
—Good evening. I—

1011
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:30,853
Come back later.

1012
01:33:33,927 --> 01:33:35,360
—I’ll go.
—Kostya, wait.

1013
01:33:35,462 --> 01:33:37,761
—No.
—There’s something I have to explain to you.

1014
01:33:37,865 --> 01:33:40,528
—No need.
—I can’t do this. He feels everything I feel.

1015
01:33:40,635 --> 01:33:42,603
Do you understand?

1016
01:33:43,872 --> 01:33:47,774
—I can’t take it off.
—I’ll help you.

1017
01:33:49,176 --> 01:33:52,043
Don’t. He’ll kill you.

1018
01:33:52,146 --> 01:33:54,581
—I’m not afraid.
—I am.

1019
01:33:56,051 --> 01:34:00,078
—I believe I told you to come back later!

1020
01:34:00,188 --> 01:34:02,622
—Listen. I said—
—Come on. Time to go.

1021
01:34:03,757 --> 01:34:06,521
—And who’s this?
—Neighbour of Gorodetsky.

1022
01:34:06,627 --> 01:34:09,926
—Knows him in any disguise.
—Hmm.

1023
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:14,296
—So, where’s your dad?
—Uh—

1024
01:35:03,217 --> 01:35:06,483
The person you’re calling
is not in range now.

1025
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:16,792
—Does that hurt?

1026
01:35:25,273 --> 01:35:27,832
—Come on.

1027
01:35:27,942 --> 01:35:31,036
Come on. Stay. Stay.

1028
01:35:31,145 --> 01:35:33,944
—Come on.

1029
01:35:34,047 --> 01:35:35,981
Okay. Okay.

1030
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:40,645
You have no right to do this. This is against
the law. Stop it! You can’t do this!

1031
01:35:40,755 --> 01:35:42,722
—There we go.

1032
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:48,257
Okay. Let’s see now.
What have we got?

1033
01:35:48,363 --> 01:35:51,662
—I’m just following orders.
—Oh, yes. I understand. Absolutely.

1034
01:35:51,765 --> 01:35:54,496
I do just what I’m told.
Good bird. That’s Gosha.

1035
01:35:54,601 --> 01:35:59,198
—Gosha’s going to the hotel for some kid’s birthday.
—That’s it.

1036
01:35:59,306 --> 01:36:03,868
What idea do you have?
What idea do you have?

1037
01:36:03,978 --> 01:36:06,605
No. You won’t get away with it.

1038
01:36:06,713 --> 01:36:09,979
Everybody knows exactly
what your ugly face looks like.

1039
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:12,051
But—But—

1040
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:20,252
Not my style, of course.

1041
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:30,757
—Sorry. Running a little late.
Where’s the party going on?
—Top floor.

1042
01:37:33,533 --> 01:37:36,332
—Parrot’s on his way to you.
—Right.

1043
01:37:39,373 --> 01:37:42,137
—How’s the food?
—Not bad.

1044
01:37:42,243 --> 01:37:44,143
Hurry or you’ll miss out.

1045
01:37:44,244 --> 01:37:47,338
Uh, Victor, give me your coat.

1046
01:37:54,354 --> 01:37:56,015
Hey, Victor.

1047
01:37:56,123 --> 01:37:59,854
—How’s it going?

1048
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:05,529
Don’t “Victor” me.

1049
01:38:05,632 --> 01:38:06,530
<i>Security: Victor</i>

1050
01:38:06,634 --> 01:38:08,158
Oh.

1051
01:38:18,046 --> 01:38:20,207
—That’s not you.

1052
01:38:29,056 --> 01:38:31,184
Where is he then?

1053
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,960
—You know?

1054
01:38:48,943 --> 01:38:50,911
Yegor!

1055
01:38:51,645 --> 01:38:53,579
Yegor!

1056
01:39:04,458 --> 01:39:06,426
Yegor!

1057
01:39:08,029 --> 01:39:10,429
Yegor!

1058
01:39:20,207 --> 01:39:22,438
Yegor!

1059
01:39:27,381 --> 01:39:30,317
Who’s there?

1060
01:39:31,652 --> 01:39:34,416
—Yegor.

1061
01:39:57,912 --> 01:40:00,436
Quiet. Quiet.
Let his dad say a few words.

1062
01:40:01,882 --> 01:40:05,319
Did you forget
it was his birthday? Shame.

1063
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:08,047
Let’s punish the man.

1064
01:40:22,703 --> 01:40:25,296
Come on, Anton.
Say something.

1065
01:40:25,405 --> 01:40:27,305
He waited for you.

1066
01:40:27,408 --> 01:40:29,967
You’re a Light One.
You guys are good at this stuff.

1067
01:40:30,078 --> 01:40:32,046
Come on.

1068
01:40:45,592 --> 01:40:47,527
—I—

1069
01:40:51,265 --> 01:40:53,164
I, uh …

1070
01:40:53,266 --> 01:40:55,497
want to wish you …

1071
01:40:55,603 --> 01:40:57,502
happiness and good health.

1072
01:41:04,244 --> 01:41:07,270
Is that it?

1073
01:41:07,381 --> 01:41:09,872
And that everything …

1074
01:41:09,984 --> 01:41:13,783
in your life is … good.

1075
01:41:23,631 --> 01:41:26,122
I’ll tell you the rest later.

1076
01:41:26,234 --> 01:41:28,202
—Let’s leave here.
—No.

1077
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:30,395
Say it now.
Later will be too late.

1078
01:41:30,505 --> 01:41:33,302
Yeah. Sure.

1079
01:41:43,184 --> 01:41:46,744
For you, I wish only one thing:
that you learn how to forgive …

1080
01:41:46,854 --> 01:41:50,085
and that no one
you know ever tells you—

1081
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:52,751
Bravo!

1082
01:42:12,313 --> 01:42:15,770
You need to forgive him.
Your dad’s tired.

1083
01:42:44,912 --> 01:42:46,811
He’s been poisoned.

1084
01:42:53,854 --> 01:42:56,583
—I’m trying to exit. You mind?
—Intercept that vehicle immediately!

1085
01:42:56,690 --> 01:42:58,123
Got it.

1086
01:42:58,225 --> 01:43:00,659
You’re cutting me off!.

1087
01:43:09,502 --> 01:43:12,596
So that’s how the salad
came together, sonny.

1088
01:43:12,707 --> 01:43:16,073
—Now try a bite.
—What is it?

1089
01:43:16,176 --> 01:43:20,011
Which is more essential?
The ingredients or the effect?

1090
01:43:20,113 --> 01:43:24,413
Grandma, you ruined my life, so just back away.

1091
01:43:24,518 --> 01:43:26,952
—You did the same to me.
—Yeah?

1092
01:43:27,054 --> 01:43:30,784
Yeah. Thanks to you,
I got 12 years in the zoo as a toad.

1093
01:43:33,027 --> 01:43:35,426
Fancy that.

1094
01:43:35,529 --> 01:43:37,759
So what are we supposed
to be doing for you now?

1095
01:43:37,864 --> 01:43:39,923
Forgotten why you came here?

1096
01:43:40,033 --> 01:43:41,934
Maybe … Chalk?

1097
01:43:48,609 --> 01:43:50,838
Chalk, you say?

1098
01:43:57,518 --> 01:44:00,953
But there’s nothing to write on since
they tore down your apartment house.

1099
01:44:01,055 --> 01:44:03,523
You’re right.

1100
01:44:03,623 --> 01:44:05,956
The wall’s still there though.

1101
01:44:11,798 --> 01:44:13,733
Come here, you.

1102
01:44:15,435 --> 01:44:18,894
How about a grape?
Want a grape, huh?

1103
01:44:19,006 --> 01:44:22,703
No? Yeah. Just get me the Chalk,
and I’ll give it to you.

1104
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:24,903
—She won’t take it.
—Well-trained, huh?

1105
01:44:25,011 --> 01:44:28,345
—Very well-trained.
—Not eating.

1106
01:44:28,448 --> 01:44:31,282
—Yeah. Not eating.
—Well, I am.

1107
01:44:31,385 --> 01:44:33,376
Well done.

1108
01:44:33,487 --> 01:44:35,386
—Eating it all.
—Excellent.

1109
01:44:37,757 --> 01:44:40,693
Right now. Everything!

1110
01:45:21,735 --> 01:45:23,930
I think we’re
really close to him now.

1111
01:45:34,215 --> 01:45:35,909
Oh. Oh.

1112
01:45:36,015 --> 01:45:38,381
He got a license?

1113
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:41,453
Look out!

1114
01:45:41,555 --> 01:45:43,954
—Are you a complete idiot?

1115
01:45:44,057 --> 01:45:45,752
Fine!

1116
01:45:47,694 --> 01:45:50,926
—Stop it, Semyon. Pull yourself together.

1117
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,975
What are you doing?

1118
01:46:09,082 --> 01:46:11,846
Don’t. Step on it!
We’re late.

1119
01:46:38,813 --> 01:46:41,372
Shall I call the Inquisition?

1120
01:46:41,481 --> 01:46:45,885
No hurry.
We are missing a guest.

1121
01:46:56,796 --> 01:47:00,493
Zavulon, my friend!

1122
01:47:02,168 --> 01:47:04,659
Let’s have a beer.

1123
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:06,739
Come on now. No joking.

1124
01:47:06,841 --> 01:47:09,400
One beverage.

1125
01:47:11,011 --> 01:47:14,572
Watch it now, Gorodetsky.
The Inquisition’s taking you.

1126
01:47:14,681 --> 01:47:18,583
Me? I don’t think so.
Not at all.

1127
01:47:20,087 --> 01:47:22,078
I didn’t kill anyone.

1128
01:47:23,122 --> 01:47:24,920
And you know it.

1129
01:47:25,024 --> 01:47:27,050
Then who’s the right one?

1130
01:47:27,161 --> 01:47:30,130
Like in a detective story …

1131
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:32,756
it could be the man
who does the floors.

1132
01:47:43,743 --> 01:47:45,734
Or a butcher.

1133
01:47:47,614 --> 01:47:49,515
Valery Sergeevich!

1134
01:47:49,617 --> 01:47:53,177
What brings you here tonight?

1135
01:47:53,287 --> 01:47:56,551
I’ve come to get my son.

1136
01:47:56,657 --> 01:48:00,057
He came here for his boy too.

1137
01:48:02,229 --> 01:48:04,595
Kostya got a license.
First one.

1138
01:48:05,632 --> 01:48:07,725
Good for him.

1139
01:48:07,835 --> 01:48:09,734
You know, that’s not him.

1140
01:48:09,837 --> 01:48:12,237
Okay. Then what?

1141
01:48:13,606 --> 01:48:15,574
He’s harmless.

1142
01:48:15,676 --> 01:48:17,644
The son of his mother.

1143
01:48:17,744 --> 01:48:20,372
She was special, you know.

1144
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,846
More like his dad, I’d say.

1145
01:48:22,949 --> 01:48:25,475
Dark Ones.

1146
01:48:25,586 --> 01:48:27,280
Pay attention!

1147
01:48:27,387 --> 01:48:31,551
Would you like to know
who murdered Galina Rogova?

1148
01:48:42,502 --> 01:48:44,970
She was murdered …

1149
01:48:45,072 --> 01:48:48,302
and the one who did it—

1150
01:48:48,408 --> 01:48:52,606
Uh, that man is you.

1151
01:48:52,712 --> 01:48:55,078
Why me murder those folks?

1152
01:48:55,181 --> 01:48:57,240
Huh.

1153
01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:58,783
Those?

1154
01:48:59,886 --> 01:49:02,047
A very good thing to ask about.

1155
01:49:03,756 --> 01:49:05,952
Now, why were they killed?

1156
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:07,993
Huh? Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1157
01:49:08,095 --> 01:49:10,256
You know who put him up to it?

1158
01:49:10,363 --> 01:49:12,422
That’s the good part.

1159
01:49:17,904 --> 01:49:20,032
Now you die!

1160
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:23,439
Papa, no. No, Papa.

1161
01:49:23,543 --> 01:49:26,307
With this very knife.

1162
01:49:26,412 --> 01:49:30,007
I wanted … so much …

1163
01:49:30,117 --> 01:49:32,414
for you to be human.

1164
01:49:44,264 --> 01:49:46,630
No circumstances …

1165
01:49:46,734 --> 01:49:51,329
can ever justify the crime
of breaking the Great Truce.

1166
01:49:51,438 --> 01:49:54,873
So, do you confess your guilt now?

1167
01:49:54,975 --> 01:49:58,842
Yes. I do.

1168
01:49:58,945 --> 01:50:01,038
Last words?

1169
01:50:04,118 --> 01:50:06,086
What is, is.

1170
01:50:06,185 --> 01:50:10,212
The Inquisition declares the innocence
of Anton Gorodetsky.

1171
01:50:12,525 --> 01:50:15,586
You are free to go now.

1172
01:50:15,695 --> 01:50:19,792
Thanks, but I’m good here, you know.

1173
01:50:23,503 --> 01:50:26,496
—Papa.
—Kostya, I’ll explain it all.

1174
01:50:28,809 --> 01:50:31,106
Alicia, did you call them?

1175
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:33,110
No.

1176
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:36,340
Zavulon! Keep your word!

1177
01:50:36,449 --> 01:50:39,247
Hey, granddad.
Don’t spoil the mood.

1178
01:50:39,353 --> 01:50:42,913
—Just go away.
—They set him up. It’s not right.

1179
01:50:43,023 --> 01:50:46,015
Only one man set him up.

1180
01:50:58,706 --> 01:51:01,470
—Tango!

1181
01:51:15,555 --> 01:51:17,581
—Oh. Quiet. Quiet.
—Kostya.

1182
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:19,453
Just give me the Chalk.

1183
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:22,654
—Quiet. Quiet.

1184
01:51:25,265 --> 01:51:27,233
Leave me alone!

1185
01:51:28,234 --> 01:51:29,429
Ooh!

1186
01:52:22,122 --> 01:52:23,783
One is lost.

1187
01:52:25,225 --> 01:52:27,193
—One is found.

1188
01:52:27,293 --> 01:52:29,989
One goes.

1189
01:52:31,664 --> 01:52:33,724
Another arrives.

1190
01:52:34,801 --> 01:52:38,293
She’s here.
Now the guest list is full.

1191
01:52:39,773 --> 01:52:42,537
You’ve got to stop her,
Uncle Zavulon.

1192
01:52:45,345 --> 01:52:47,039
And death would be—

1193
01:52:47,146 --> 01:52:50,207
Melodrama, Yegor, is not my style.

1194
01:52:50,317 --> 01:52:52,216
I’ll do it.

1195
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:54,912
Hmm. She’s stronger, so be prepared.

1196
01:52:55,021 --> 01:52:57,819
Don’t do it.

1197
01:53:11,671 --> 01:53:13,400
—Svetlana.
—Anton!

1198
01:53:13,506 --> 01:53:16,340
Go. Just go home. Okay?

1199
01:53:16,443 --> 01:53:19,935
Look. I’ll explain all of it.

1200
01:53:20,046 --> 01:53:23,448
Everything. Later.
It’ll be better if you go.

1201
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:26,417
You know? Hey,
don’t be offended, huh?

1202
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:29,011
Oh.

1203
01:53:29,122 --> 01:53:33,057
It’s all just great here now.

1204
01:53:33,159 --> 01:53:35,252
Go home, please.

1205
01:53:35,362 --> 01:53:37,989
Uncle Zavulon, he doesn’t love her.

1206
01:53:38,097 --> 01:53:40,725
—He’s a Dark One now.
—No, Yegor.

1207
01:53:40,833 --> 01:53:42,859
Just casting shadows.

1208
01:53:42,970 --> 01:53:46,269
—Then what do we do?
—Hmm. Think, Yegor. What is there?

1209
01:53:51,078 --> 01:53:53,136
I stuck a needle in her.

1210
01:53:53,247 --> 01:53:55,771
In the Gloom the other day.

1211
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:58,978
I could drink her now.

1212
01:54:37,591 --> 01:54:40,753
—125. Three minutes to target.

1213
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:43,523
—320. Seven minutes.
—Thirty-four. Six minutes.

1214
01:54:43,630 --> 01:54:45,859
540. Two minutes.

1215
01:54:45,966 --> 01:54:47,865
518? 518?

1216
01:54:47,967 --> 01:54:50,731
518. One minute away from target.

1217
01:54:52,805 --> 01:54:56,104
On no account should anyone
start any heavy action without us.

1218
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:59,770
Hold your position, all units.
Repeat. Hold your position.

1219
01:55:22,735 --> 01:55:25,863
They’ve got us surrounded.

1221
01:55:35,082 --> 01:55:36,981
There’s no answer.

01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:46,185
Sveta.

1223
01:55:46,292 --> 01:55:48,988
It’s me. Look at me.
Don’t close your eyes, Sveta.

I’m losing you.

—Do not close your eyes.
—Hello?

1226
01:55:53,367 --> 01:55:55,561
Easy. Just help me out a little.

1227
01:55:55,668 --> 01:55:58,001
—If you can give me a little help—
—Hey, stupid!

1228
01:55:58,104 --> 01:56:01,006
—Come on, man! Open the door!
—I want you to stay on the line.

1229
01:56:01,108 --> 01:56:02,574
Open the damn door!

1230
01:56:02,676 --> 01:56:04,268
It’s been nice!

1231
01:56:06,113 --> 01:56:08,911
Don’t stop breathing.

1232
01:56:09,015 --> 01:56:10,846
Up you get, Sveta.
You’re doing well.

1233
01:56:10,951 --> 01:56:13,545
—Get that ramp in place!
—In front?

1234
01:56:13,653 --> 01:56:15,847
Yeah!

1235
01:56:15,956 --> 01:56:18,253
Talk to me. Come on, Sveta. Talk to me.

1236
01:56:18,358 --> 01:56:21,725
Tell me what’s happening.
Stay with me now.

1237
01:56:30,136 --> 01:56:32,867
—They’re crazy. Nuts.

1238
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:39,404
Well done, Sveta.

1239
01:56:39,512 --> 01:56:43,210
Great. Breathe. Breathe.
That’s good. Now, let’s get up.

1240
01:56:43,315 --> 01:56:46,149
You’re a beauty.
Now come on, Sveta.

1241
01:56:46,252 --> 01:56:48,653
We’re standing up.
Come on. Come on.

1242
01:56:48,755 --> 01:56:51,154
Up. Let’s go. Let’s go.

1243
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:15,145
Sveta.

1244
01:57:15,247 --> 01:57:18,411
—Yes? Hello?

1245
01:57:24,024 --> 01:57:25,992
Hello?

1246
01:57:26,092 --> 01:57:28,152
Olga?

1247
01:57:28,261 --> 01:57:32,162
—We’re almost there. Wait.
—I found Anton.

1248
01:57:34,835 --> 01:57:37,429
Only He’s drunk.
H—He doesn’t want to go anywhere.

1249
01:57:37,537 --> 01:57:39,936
Go practice now.

1250
01:57:45,244 --> 01:57:47,439
He was drugged?

1251
01:57:47,546 --> 01:57:51,984
You have to get out of there. It’s a trap.
And you stay away from Yegor. Do you hear me?

1252
01:57:52,085 --> 01:57:54,109
I understand.

1253
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:56,917
—Do you hear me?
—Yes, I hear you.

1254
01:58:01,494 --> 01:58:03,485
What do you want?

1255
01:58:06,233 --> 01:58:10,033
—I need Anton Gorodetsky.
—I need him too.

1256
01:58:11,770 --> 01:58:14,501
—We need to talk.
—No.

1257
01:58:14,608 --> 01:58:16,576
You’re a liar.

1258
01:58:16,676 --> 01:58:18,939
You really came to
take him away from me.

1259
01:58:19,045 --> 01:58:21,012
No.

1260
01:58:21,113 --> 01:58:23,309
He loves you too much.

1261
01:58:25,452 --> 01:58:27,351
And you.

1262
01:58:28,854 --> 01:58:32,154
Ladies and gentlemen …

1263
01:58:32,259 --> 01:58:36,889
it’s finally time for the main event
of our celebration …

1264
01:58:36,997 --> 01:58:40,728
which we’ve been patiently
waiting for a thousand years.

1265
01:58:40,833 --> 01:58:44,201
Today, a Great Other
appeared before us!

1266
01:58:44,304 --> 01:58:46,271
I’m not going to fight with you.

1267
01:58:46,372 --> 01:58:48,273
You don’t have a choice.

1268
01:58:48,375 --> 01:58:49,501
<i>Exit</i>


1269
01:59:06,292 --> 01:59:08,226
You strapped in?

1270
01:59:12,198 --> 01:59:14,689
We’ve chosen to start the battle.

1271
01:59:14,801 --> 01:59:17,895
And this time, we’ll be victorious!

1272
01:59:22,442 --> 01:59:24,569
Damn, He’s big.

1273
01:59:55,942 --> 01:59:58,739
Because if a single drop
of Dark blood …

1274
01:59:58,845 --> 02:00:04,010
is spilled anywhere,
I will tear the Truce apart!

1275
02:00:04,117 --> 02:00:08,485
And it is time to create
a brand-new world where we’re on top!

1276
02:00:19,231 --> 02:00:22,827
We made it.

1277
02:00:33,846 --> 02:00:37,305
How long are we supposed to
keep hiding in corners?

1278
02:00:37,417 --> 02:00:40,783
Who’s breaking a law here?
Is it us or them?

1279
02:00:40,886 --> 02:00:43,617
That’s the point, men.

1280
02:00:43,722 --> 02:00:46,453
—We know the faces of every one of them.
—That’s right!

1281
02:00:46,559 --> 02:00:49,323
Every single Dark, horrible one!

1282
02:00:49,429 --> 02:00:53,364
The people believe in our cause!
If we don’t give them protection, who will?

1283
02:00:53,466 --> 02:00:59,029
Because there is no longer anyone left anywhere
who is able to change the shape of fate!

1284
02:00:59,139 --> 02:01:02,073
Because that fate is now
here in our hands!

1285
02:01:02,175 --> 02:01:04,234
—And that’s the point!
—Listen!

1286
02:01:04,344 --> 02:01:07,313
Listen to me!
They want to start a war!

1287
02:01:07,479 --> 02:01:09,140
And over the world …

1288
02:01:09,248 --> 02:01:11,046
—there will be darkness, like eternal night!
—Hey.

1289
02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:12,550
And nothing can—

1290
02:01:12,652 --> 02:01:14,846
The two of them
in there, fighting—

1291
02:01:14,953 --> 02:01:17,514
—Now I’ll leave.
—Not happening.

1292
02:01:31,171 --> 02:01:33,070
What is this?

1293
02:01:54,694 --> 02:01:58,390
Blood! Blood!

1294
02:01:58,497 --> 02:02:01,091
Blood!

1295
02:02:01,201 --> 02:02:05,001
—So.
—So what?

1296
02:02:05,104 --> 02:02:07,971
—It’s started.
—Oh, no.

1297
02:02:08,073 --> 02:02:10,735
Blood! Blood!

1298
02:02:30,529 --> 02:02:32,828
—It’s begun.
—Gesser.

1299
02:02:32,931 --> 02:02:35,229
—Let’s go!

1300
02:02:45,845 --> 02:02:48,472
—Everybody out. Evacuate!
—Out!

1301
02:02:48,581 --> 02:02:52,346
—We have to evacuate the top floor now!
—Everyone out! Fire!

1302
02:02:52,452 --> 02:02:56,752
—Everyone! Evacuate!
—Fire. What the hell?

1303
02:02:58,056 --> 02:02:59,524
Fire! Fire!
Everyone leave now!

1304
02:02:59,626 --> 02:03:00,957
—Come on!
—Fire.

1305
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:03,028
—Get out. Hurry up.
—What’s going on out here?

1306
02:03:03,128 --> 02:03:05,029
Someone tell me.
What’s going on?

1307
02:03:05,131 --> 02:03:07,030
—Everybody out!

1308
02:03:13,773 --> 02:03:16,935
Anton.
Anton, where are you?

1309
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,845
Anton.

1310
02:05:10,189 --> 02:05:14,181
Panic in the streets as the people
of Moscow try to find some kind of safety …

1311
02:05:14,293 --> 02:05:17,922
for themselves and their families
in the midst of this devastation.

1312
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:33,310
They’re on the way back.

1313
02:05:33,412 --> 02:05:36,974
There’s a fire on this floor.
Everyone stay ca—

1314
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:40,409
—What is happening?
—There’s a fire. Run!

1315
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:43,454
Right, right, right!
I’m running! I’m running! I’m running!

1316
02:06:01,239 --> 02:06:02,935
The destruction
is tremend-

1317
02:06:27,734 --> 02:06:29,860
Getting good shots?

1318
02:06:29,969 --> 02:06:33,802
—A little dark.
—Hmm. The end of the world.

1319
02:06:36,141 --> 02:06:38,132

Find Alicia.
Get the Chalk from her.

1322
02:07:20,653 --> 02:07:24,054
—Alicia! Where is she? Do you know?
—Alicia? That way, I think.

1323
02:07:28,327 --> 02:07:29,520
Alicia.

1324
02:07:30,863 --> 02:07:32,831
Alicia, stop.

1325
02:07:34,634 --> 02:07:37,228
I’m too old to run around after you.
What are you doing?

1326
02:07:37,336 --> 02:07:40,065
Hold it. Stop.

1327
02:07:40,172 --> 02:07:43,336

1331
02:08:27,619 --> 02:08:30,020

—You can’t do it, Alicia.

—Believe me. There is no way
you can bring him back.
—I can change it!

—Because it’s not your fault.
Now hand the Chalk over to me!

—What difference does it make now?

All right.
So, do you agree?

02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:23,605
Well-

<i>No</i>

1387
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:30,914
No.

1388
02:14:31,015 --> 02:14:34,280
I think I can handle this.
On my own.

1389
02:14:38,224 --> 02:14:41,318
No case, no trial.

1390
02:14:43,028 --> 02:14:44,996
I’m sorry.

1391
02:14:51,403 --> 02:14:53,632
Got a smoke?

1392
02:14:58,610 --> 02:15:00,511
You sure?

1393
02:15:00,613 --> 02:15:02,581
I don’t smoke.

1394
02:15:05,650 --> 02:15:08,016
—Nothing?
—You sure?

1395
02:15:10,622 --> 02:15:12,591
I’m sure.

He’s human again.

1397
02:15:46,457 --> 02:15:48,358
He won’t know her.

1398
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:50,359
Yes, he will.

1399
02:15:56,167 --> 02:16:00,194
—No pushing them now.
—And no blocking, eh?

1400
02:16:00,305 --> 02:16:02,637
Guess who’s wrong.

1401
02:16:14,019 --> 02:16:16,078
Hey. Wait.

1402
02:16:20,391 --> 02:16:22,451
Who’s your daddy?

1403
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:24,529
Excuse me. I’m sorry.

1404
02:16:24,630 --> 02:16:27,724
Have we possibly met?
Somewhere else?

1405
02:16:29,068 --> 02:16:31,002
—Maybe we did.
—Yeah?
