00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:02,064
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man On Earth...

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:05,708
- I need to know what this pill is.
- Clozapine.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,012
Uh, Gail, it's a match.

4
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,448
(both laughing, clamoring)

5
00:00:08,483 --> 00:00:09,548
Looks like we have company,

6
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:11,750
and that company is a Yoda.

7
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:13,553
TANDY: Where the hell are you?

8
00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:15,855
(screaming)

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,059
(a la Yoda): Found a
Yoda, looks like we did.

10
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:27,233
I can't believe a kid's alive.

11
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:29,202
Poor thing, what he's been through.

12
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,196
Alone all this time.

13
00:00:31,202 --> 00:00:33,072
No family, no friends.

14
00:00:33,107 --> 00:00:34,941
Has he said anything at all?

15
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,246
Not yet.

16
00:00:36,253 --> 00:00:38,243
TANDY: Nah, words are just things.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,908
(chuckles) You guys'll find a way

18
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,347
to bond with him like I have.

19
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:44,183
Isn't that right, you little turkey?

20
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:47,420
What a connection.

21
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,323
So, look, I know what
you're all thinking.

22
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:51,091
You know, Tandy's the finder,

23
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:52,844
so, naturally, Tandy
should be the keeper.

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,084
No one's thinking that.

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,695
Yeah, there's no keeper
in this situation.

26
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,697
This is a child.

27
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:58,341
Or a Benji Buttons.

28
00:00:58,347 --> 00:01:01,264
Okay, if you still think
he's a Benjamin Button,

29
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,869
you shouldn't be anywhere near him.

30
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,105
Fine, he's a kid.

31
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:08,174
Look, I put in a lot of
hours out there in those woods

32
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,545
opening up my heart, and
making him feel the security

33
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,390
that only a father can provide.

34
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:15,563
Now, am I his literal father?

35
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,099
Probably not.

36
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:20,376
But am I spiritually his
father? Without a doubt.

37
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:22,978
So to quote the late Sir Paul McCartney,

38
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:24,902
and the even later Michael Jackson,

39
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,692
"That boy is mine.

40
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:28,528
That doggone boy is mine."

41
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:30,296
He doesn't belong to anybody,

42
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:31,742
you friggin' nimwood.

43
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:34,296
Maybe I can help. From
my work with strays,

44
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,152
I learned that the most
important thing you can do

45
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,859
- is project a feeling of calm.
- Yeah.

46
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:42,543
You know, just make him
feel comfortable, safe.

47
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:44,311
Hey, there, little guy.

48
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:45,978
- Hi.
- Just relax.

49
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,114
We're all your friends.

50
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,778
Is there anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

51
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:52,418
(all talking at once)

52
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:54,087
Hey, there, my little dude.

53
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:55,555
You want to take your mask off?

54
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,500
Okay, nobody takes that mask off.

55
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:59,378
He wears that thing forever, you hear?

56
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:00,561
Are you hungry?

57
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:02,668
You want some pizza?

58
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,799
(both gasp)

59
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,301
Well, there's that beautiful face, huh?

60
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,671
Hey, can you tell us your name?

61
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:12,840
Huh?

62
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,140
Oh, he's shy.

63
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,609
Okay, let me start.

64
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:17,411
My name is Tandy.

65
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:18,745
Okay, so, uh,

66
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:21,848
can you tell us your little name? Huh?

67
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,020
It appears we're dealing with a deaf.

68
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:28,688
Or, like, a Nell.

69
00:02:28,723 --> 00:02:29,956
CAROL: Okay, let me try.

70
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:32,247
I'm gonna say some common names,

71
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,606
and you just let me know if I guess it.

72
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:36,462
Daphne.

73
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,831
Smeegle?

74
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:39,800
LaFontaine.

75
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,501
Carol, those aren't common names.

76
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,909
Maybe not where you grew up,

77
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:45,634
but we had two LaFontaines on our block.

78
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,542
Oh, they were always
picking on poor Smeegle.

79
00:02:48,576 --> 00:02:51,604
- LaFontaines are notorious bullies.
- Guys!

80
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,180
His name's labeled right here

81
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,348
on the front of his backpack.

82
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,615
He's Jansport.

83
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,853
No, Tandy, that's the name
of the backpack company.

84
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,492
But it's got a nice ring to it, huh?

85
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,183
All in favor of naming
the kid "Jansport"?

86
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:03,991
You can't name a kid a backpack.

87
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:06,492
And I would never suggest
that we do that, okay?

88
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:09,562
But we can be inspired by
it. Okay, let's brainstorm...

89
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,497
Jan, Janice...

90
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:12,961
Oh, I like Janice.

91
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:13,908
Janice it is.

92
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:15,588
No, you're not naming him Janice.

93
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:17,538
Guys, look, he's obviously got a name,

94
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,838
and he'll tell us when he's ready.

95
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,552
But in the meantime, we
have to call him something.

96
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:22,776
I mean, kids need names.

97
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,211
It gives them confidence, self-esteem.

98
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,280
Half the kids in jail never had names.

99
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:29,102
That's why they give them numbers.

100
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,050
Ooh, how about Jansport?

101
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,284
Oh, we already did that one.

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,887
Uh, Jasport! Jasport.

103
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,622
Uh, Japort, Japah... Jasper. Jasper!

104
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,686
Jasper... what do you think?

105
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:39,490
Fine.

106
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:40,462
Is that okay?

107
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:42,031
Can we call you Jasper?

108
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,424
He loves it.

109
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,564
Hi, Jasper.

110
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,066
Hey, you want to play a game?

111
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:49,348
You do, huh? Tag!

112
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:50,819
(laughing)

113
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,143
Hey, bud. (chuckles)

114
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,383
It's good to get away
from those chumps, huh?

115
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:06,789
Just the boys, am I right? (chuckling)

116
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:10,489
Psych!

117
00:04:10,495 --> 00:04:12,057
Too slow, yeah.

118
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,793
Hey, I got a little something for you.

119
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:15,260
Hang tight.

120
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,168
(engine humming)

121
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:37,182
Jasper?

122
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:40,694
Jasper?

123
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:42,422
Huh.

124
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,656
(turning siren on and off)

125
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,826
(laughs)

126
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:52,584
Well, there you are,

127
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:55,502
you little, turkey, huh? (chuckling)

128
00:04:55,536 --> 00:04:57,470
Guess we're gonna have
to work on the meaning

129
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,276
of "hang tight," 'cause
you immediately took off.

130
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,975
No worries, bud.

131
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,478
Here, come on, check this out!

132
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,156
Look at this.

133
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:08,146
Isn't this cool?

134
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,617
This is called a margarita pool, Jasper.

135
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:11,987
Now, margaritas are

136
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,185
an adult beverage

137
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:14,653
that contain alcohol.

138
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,954
Now, what is alcohol?

139
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,057
Alcohol is what grown-ups drink

140
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:21,160
when they want to get
crunk; you know, loose.

141
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,228
Yeah, come over and check it out.

142
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:23,497
Oh, no, no, no, no! (laughs)

143
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:25,064
This one's for me, okay?

144
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:27,740
But don't you worry, 'cause I got you

145
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:29,940
a hot tub sundae!

146
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:32,672
Come on, Jasper, last
one in is a rotten egg.

147
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:33,646
(laughter continues)

148
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:35,584
Oh, very slippery.

149
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,257
Come on!

150
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:38,295
(laughs)

151
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:40,768
(singsongy): You're a rotten egg.

152
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,182
JK, bud. Oh, this is so great.

153
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,918
Look at this, look at this.
I got the whipped cream.

154
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:47,252
(laughs)

155
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:49,329
Some peanuts.

156
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,452
And some cherries, too, huh?

157
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,494
(laughs)

158
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:56,959
This is fun and delicious, huh?

159
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,067
Oh, that whipped cream has gone bad.

160
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,701
It's gone bad. Yes, it's rancid.

161
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:04,137
Where you going, bud?

162
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:06,038
You gonna get a big run-up?

163
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,274
Gonna cannonball me? Nice try.

164
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,875
Jasper. Jasper.

165
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,577
(accordion playing)

166
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,680
♪ Crack that whip. ♪

167
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,776
- Hey, Todd.
- Hey.

168
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:16,761
What are you up to?

169
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:18,893
Ah, just going to give
Melissa her medication.

170
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:20,731
Oh. How's that going?

171
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:23,598
Well, apparently it takes
a few weeks to see results.

172
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:25,057
But the side effects are coming in hot,

173
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,415
so that's a good sign.

174
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,089
You know, increased heart rate,

175
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,168
lots of sweats, tarry stools...

176
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:31,560
Don't need all the deets, Todd.

177
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,199
Copy that.

178
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:36,235
Hey, thanks again for your help.

179
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,971
I couldn't have done it without you.

180
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:47,524
Hey, bud.

181
00:06:48,838 --> 00:06:51,558
I know this all must
be so new and scary,

182
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:53,882
but I'd like to
introduce you to a friend,

183
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:56,055
who might just make you feel
a little more comfortable.

184
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,391
This is Gary.

185
00:06:59,822 --> 00:07:01,259
When I was all alone,

186
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,232
this little guy was everything to me.

187
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,398
A mother, a father,

188
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,733
a brother, a sister.

189
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,502
A distant uncle who tells it like it is.

190
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:11,937
And I'll be honest, a few days away

191
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,483
from being a lover.

192
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,255
But most of all,

193
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,810
he was my best friend.

194
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,663
Now I'd like him to be your best friend.

195
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,408
Oh, no, no, no, no!

196
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,519
Erica, stop! Gary!

197
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,667
Gary! No!

198
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,338
I saw what you did last summer.

199
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,125
- What?
- You and...

200
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,259
Todd.

201
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,661
Me and Todd what?

202
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,564
The way he touched your shoulder?

203
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,100
I thought the fireworks
would burn my face off.

204
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,874
Felt like the 4th of May over there.

205
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,877
You mean 4th of July?

206
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,442
No, the 4th of May...
International Walkers Day.

207
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,612
My family were avid
walkers. Big pedophiles.

208
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:04,415
Anyways, I thought
you two were broken up.

209
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,041
We are broken up.

210
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:08,168
Hell, friends can touch shoulders,

211
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,596
for God sakes, Carol.

212
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,331
Well, looks like this friend was

213
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,778
itching for some benefits.

214
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:16,528
Carol, why are you all
up in my butt about this?

215
00:08:16,533 --> 00:08:18,701
It's a tale as old as time.

216
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,707
Girl gets stuck in an
elevator, nearly dies.

217
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:25,271
Comes out scared, emotional, raw.

218
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,170
And then her scenester
ex-boyfriend swoops in

219
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:31,158
with his shoulder touches
and his sweet talk.

220
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:34,687
"Hey, babe, how you
feeling? You feeling raw?

221
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,334
I'll make it go away."

222
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,838
And then you boink all night.

223
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:40,731
Boink, boink! Breather. Boink!

224
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:43,238
Yeah, it's hot, and it's kinky,

225
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:46,298
and it's making the
voices in your head stop.

226
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,402
But the next day, you
wake up and he's gone.

227
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,937
And, PS...

228
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,740
(whispers): you're pregnant.

229
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:58,616
Yeah, Carol, I don't
think any of those things

230
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,018
are gonna happen,
especially that last part.

231
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,048
Got it.

232
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,619
Oh, God, I don't know
what you think you got,

233
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:08,221
but you might want to
spend some of the brain time

234
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,793
worrying about Tandy and that kid.

235
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,105
But they're doing great.

236
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:15,212
TANDY: Jasper! Jasper!

237
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:17,263
How dare you!

238
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,147
Are they?

239
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:21,000
Jasper!

240
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,769
We're not done here.

241
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:24,937
He trusted you, Jasper!

242
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:27,440
Oh, don't worry, you're
gonna be okay, okay?

243
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:32,011
- How's it going, Tandy?
- Not well.

244
00:09:32,047 --> 00:09:34,529
He just needs a little air transfusion.

245
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:37,894
Look, I hate to kick you
while you're down here,

246
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,229
but a lot of people
are a little concerned

247
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:43,467
that you might not have the
aptitude to be a care giver.

248
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:45,245
Carol, I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

249
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,826
I mean, I'm bending over
backwards for this kid,

250
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,588
pulling out all the stops.

251
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:52,331
But he's just acting
like a real LaFontaine.

252
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,565
Well, if he's misbehaving,

253
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:58,971
then maybe

254
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:01,307
you got to do something about it.

255
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:03,842
Have you seen <i>Mr. Holland's Opus?</i>

256
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,691
- No.
- Me, neither. I hear it's great.

257
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,048
But that same year,
there was another movie

258
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,528
that came out called<i>
Dangerous Minds.</i>

259
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:12,503
Oh, good, okay.

260
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,321
It's about a woman
named Michelle Pfeiffer,

261
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:18,057
who marches into an
inner-city classroom,

262
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:21,013
and for the first time in
the history of the world,

263
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,466
she wins kids over with
stern disciplinarianism.

264
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,866
She just lets her hair down and puts on

265
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,778
a tight-fitted leather jacket.

266
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,773
She flips her chair around

267
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:34,139
and doesn't take any guff.

268
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,125
Do you see at what I'm getting?

269
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,191
Look, I know you want to be a boy's man,

270
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:41,889
but I think right now,

271
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:45,498
you need to be a little
bit more of a Michelle.

272
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:48,236
Oh, I can be a Michelle.

273
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:52,892
Well, well, well, what
do we got here, huh?

274
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:01,211
So you think you're pretty cool, huh?

275
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,616
Mr. Tough Stuff?

276
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:05,907
Don't listen to nobody, no how, huh?

277
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:08,041
Well I got news for you, compadre.

278
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:10,342
There are rules around here.

279
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,879
Yeah, things that we do called "rules."

280
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,849
Everyone's got to follow... w-w-w-wait!

281
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,616
Now, w-wait, Jasper!

282
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,174
A cigarette?

283
00:11:19,674 --> 00:11:20,854
Give me that.

284
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,955
Where'd this come from?

285
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,022
J-Jasper!

286
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,890
Where these cigarettes coming from?

287
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,135
(laughs)

288
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:27,595
I found it.

289
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,469
The river always leads to the lake.

290
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:33,232
Look, I can play your game all day long.

291
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:35,467
So what's your next move, huh?

292
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:37,470
'Cause Tandy ain't going nowhere.

293
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,375
Consider us attached to the hip

294
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,296
like a pair of conjoined twinsies.

295
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,241
You know what those are?

296
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:43,615
They're twins attached by the skin.

297
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,711
Wait, wait, wait, where you going?

298
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,812
(stammers) Jasper!

299
00:11:45,846 --> 00:11:47,413
Jasper! (stammering) Don't leave!

300
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,565
Uh... I'll give you
your cigarettes back!

301
00:11:51,995 --> 00:11:53,986
I'll give them back, yeah.

302
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,794
If I give these back to you...

303
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,596
uh,<i> when</i> I
give these back to you,

304
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,138
will-will you do something for me?

305
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:08,129
(chuckles)

306
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:10,027
Like a puppet on a string.

307
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,365
(laughs)

308
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,855
Well, look who's out and about.

309
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,195
Hey, Melissa.

310
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,041
Oh!

311
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,870
Have you been Jazzercising?

312
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,432
TODD: Oh, no, she just woke from a nap.

313
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,080
Sweating's one of the side effects.

314
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,760
And tarry stools.

315
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:28,836
(sighs) Look, I'd love
to get into that later,

316
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:31,966
but let me just cut
to the Chase Manhattan.

317
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:34,951
I've noticed you've been
spending a lot of time

318
00:12:34,957 --> 00:12:36,591
with Mom lately;

319
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,587
touching shoulders and whatnot.

320
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,408
And I just need to know,

321
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,140
what are your intentions, Mr. Flores?

322
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,663
Uh, Mr. Flores?

323
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:48,665
Pedro Flores, inventor of the yo-yo?

324
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,120
I'm sorry, Carol, I'm not following.

325
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:53,600
Do you intend to wrap my
mom around your little finger

326
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:55,306
and toy with her, hmm?

327
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,008
Do a little down-up, down-up,

328
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,842
maybe walk the dog,

329
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,344
go around the world.

330
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,745
And once you've had your fun,

331
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,214
stick her in a drawer

332
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,716
with your Pogs and Tamagotchis.

333
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,585
Carol, Gail and I have
been through a lot.

334
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,320
I-I'd never do anything to hurt her.

335
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,355
Good.

336
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,356
Don't ever try anything funny, Todd,

337
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,825
'cause I'll be watching you.

338
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:16,927
Watching you like a hog.

339
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,563
(snorts)

340
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:25,812
Evening, everyone.

341
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,280
Oh, hey, Melissa, hey.

342
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:30,053
(chuckles) You been Jazzercising?

343
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,067
(chuckles) Keep it up, looking trim.

344
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:35,321
Anyway, a little birdie told
me there was a bit of concern

345
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,802
about my parenting skills.

346
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,340
Uh, in light of that,

347
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:39,610
I just wanted you all to know

348
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,082
that Jasper is dead.

349
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,157
- (gasps) No!
- What?

350
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:44,559
Uh... sorry, metorically, not literally.

351
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:45,355
Idiot.

352
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,874
Could've been a little
more clear about that.

353
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,167
- Yeah.
- But, yes,

354
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,952
I, you know, I
slaughtered the old Jasper,

355
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,338
I burned his corpse and
dumped his ashes in the toilet.

356
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,509
But like the phoenix, Jasper is reborn.

357
00:13:56,543 --> 00:13:57,588
And now,

358
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,812
it gives me the greatest of pleasures

359
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,682
to introduce you to... the new Jasper!

360
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,753
Jasper, what do we do
when we enter a room?

361
00:14:08,365 --> 00:14:10,591
(chuckles) What a gentleman.

362
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,962
Have a seat, please.

363
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,886
Jasper, I was just about to
ask you what we immediately do

364
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,772
upon sitting at the dinner table,

365
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,176
but looks like you beat me to the punch.

366
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,323
That's right, we put
our napkins in our laps.

367
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,096
Good job, Jasper.

368
00:14:34,115 --> 00:14:35,914
Good job.

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,419
(imitates explosion)

370
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:41,711
(laughs)

371
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:44,356
That's right, explosives,
even in fist form,

372
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,058
are only for adults.

373
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,144
I taught him about the
dangers of explosives.

374
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,004
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:50,264
GAIL: Wow. I-I got to say,

376
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,731
you do seem to have made some
progress with the little one.

377
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,368
Thank you, Gail. Now, Jasper,

378
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:58,408
what do we say when someone
pays us a compliment?

379
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,080
- Aw.
- (laughs)

380
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:02,552
Oh.

381
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,043
Jasper, you're doing so great.

382
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:07,154
Tandy, what are you passing Jasper?

383
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,806
Uh... (laughs)

384
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,946
A compliment for a job well done.

385
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:15,162
Oh, no, I think I saw you give
him something under the table.

386
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:18,804
Holy hell, he's giving him cigarettes.

387
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:20,092
- CAROL: Tandy?
- ERICA: Cigarettes?

388
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,312
- TODD: You've got to be kidding me!
- What?

389
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,981
Jasper, where'd you get
all those cigarettes?

390
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,931
Oh, come on, Tandy, we
all know where he got them!

391
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:26,495
Well, then somebody please tell me

392
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:28,259
- 'cause I'm in the dark here.
- Tandy!

393
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:29,335
What?! (stammering)

394
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,769
- Hello!
- Where'd that come from? What?

395
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,168
Jasper, did you put
cigarettes in my shorts pocket?

396
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:34,974
That's it, Tandy, I really don't think

397
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,775
you should have anything
to do with this kid.

398
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,393
But we share a special bond.

399
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,870
Yeah, they're called cigarettes.

400
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:41,780
But those have nothing to do with it.

401
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,817
Look, he loves me like a point person.

402
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:46,746
Well, then I think it's time
he picks a new point person.

403
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:48,421
Okay, Jasper.

404
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:50,956
Now when I say go, you're
gonna walk to the person

405
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,959
you want as your point person, okay?

406
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,793
And people who he doesn't go to?

407
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,995
No crying, please.

408
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:57,529
The system's not rigged.

409
00:15:58,364 --> 00:15:59,797
Okay, you ready?

410
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:02,434
(whispers): Look at that.

411
00:16:02,688 --> 00:16:04,687
Tandy, no cigarettes.

412
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,495
Nice try, Gail, but you can't just

413
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:09,109
spring a last-minute rule
on me here, right? Right?

414
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:09,942
No! No.

415
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:11,309
- Tandy, no.
- CAROL: Tandy, no.

416
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:13,312
Okay, fine, fine.

417
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,846
Okay, Jasper, you ready?

418
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:16,381
And go!

419
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:18,923
Jasper! Jasper! Jasp...

420
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:21,705
Aw, thank you, Jasper.

421
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,322
Okay, round one goes to Erica.

422
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,791
Uh, best of three. Come on, get up.

423
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:25,658
What?

424
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:26,826
Okay, so where do we stand?

425
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,226
Uh, Erica has 21,

426
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:30,615
Melissa got a quick three when
Erica went to the bathroom.

427
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:32,398
Uh, okay, so the tide turns now.

428
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,966
Here we go, best of 49.

429
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,735
No, we're done here.

430
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,135
CAROL: Tandy,

431
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:38,703
he picked Erica.

432
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,573
(softly): Let it go, bud.

433
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:44,976
I see. Okay.

434
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:48,380
And, uh, bud, you sure
this is, uh, what you want?

435
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,488
Then so be it, all right? (laughs)

436
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:57,856
You're going to need these, Erica.

437
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,091
- Oh!
- Tandy!

438
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,596
You know, I should've named you Brute,

439
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,566
'cause you stabbed me in the back.

440
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:07,922
(voice breaking): The back of my heart.

441
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:09,268
Oh.

442
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:18,490
Carol, what in high
heaven did you tell Todd?

443
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,509
I just told him that if
he ever messed with you,

444
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,419
- I'd give him the Pilbasian horns.
- Carol!

445
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,174
There are two men left in this earth.

446
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,635
Just two.

447
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:29,997
You're married to one of them.

448
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:32,833
So my options are pretty limited.

449
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:35,335
It's Todd or bust.

450
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:39,028
So if, in the future, I decide

451
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,674
that I want to get back
up on that Todd horse,

452
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,897
then I am gonna get back
up on that Todd horse

453
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:48,382
and I am gonna freakin' ride!

454
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:50,077
Do you got that?

455
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,151
Okay, I got it.

456
00:17:51,186 --> 00:17:52,607
- Good.
- I'm sorry.

457
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,520
You don't know how lucky
you are to be married

458
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:57,393
to that dumb son of a bitch,
so count your blessings,

459
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,930
'cause I'm about to
go get down and dirty

460
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,663
with a CPR dummy.

461
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:05,464
That's my day.

462
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,875
(slurping)

463
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:18,318
Hey, Tandy.

464
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:20,012
You doing okay?

465
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:22,604
Oh, yeah, I couldn't be happier.

466
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,976
Do you want to talk about it?

467
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,826
Carol, what if our baby doesn't like me?

468
00:18:33,832 --> 00:18:35,194
Oh, don't be silly.

469
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,563
No, I mean, I've been trying

470
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:39,465
so hard with Jasper, and
he's just not having it.

471
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,367
I'm just worried the
same thing's gonna happen

472
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:42,402
with our kid.

473
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:44,538
Tandy, our child's gonna love you.

474
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,272
And Jasper's gonna love you, too.

475
00:18:46,307 --> 00:18:48,375
You're a grower, not a shower.

476
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,997
- You think so?
- Hey, if it makes you feel better,

477
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,726
someone who said horrible
things about you in the past

478
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:56,983
just paid you a real nice compliment.

479
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:58,085
- Gail?
- No.

480
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,125
- Melissa?
- Nope.

481
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:00,230
- Erica?
- Guess again.

482
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,320
- Todd?
- Not today.

483
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:03,423
- Jasper spoke?!
- (laughs) What? No.

484
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,724
Carol, that's everyone.

485
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,148
Did you say Gail?

486
00:19:06,154 --> 00:19:07,260
Yes, I did.

487
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,990
Oh, you said that first.

488
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:09,895
Now I remember.

489
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,218
- Gail said something nice about me?
- Mm-hmm.

490
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:13,900
So you just hold that chin up

491
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:16,836
and let the world see
your beautiful neck.

492
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:18,939
'Cause our baby needs that.

493
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:20,273
And so does Jasper.

494
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:22,029
(chuckles)

495
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,086
Yeah.

496
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:33,375
Knock-knock.

497
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,022
Hey, Tandy.

498
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,457
I just wanted to come by and say

499
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:39,792
sorry for being such a sore loser.

500
00:19:39,827 --> 00:19:42,207
Figured it was time to
extend the old olive branch,

501
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:43,179
as they say.

502
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:44,284
So, here you go.

503
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,635
Okay.

504
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,451
I couldn't find an actual olive branch,

505
00:19:47,457 --> 00:19:49,126
so this is just a regular tree branch

506
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,968
with an assortment of
canned olives taped to it.

507
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:54,473
It sure is.

508
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,310
Well, thank you, I guess.

509
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:58,778
It's really sweet of you.

510
00:19:58,785 --> 00:19:59,980
I know.

511
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:03,115
Um, anyway, uh, how's-how's he doing?

512
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:04,116
Oh, he's good.

513
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:05,384
We had a lot of fun today.

514
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,819
Really tired him out.

515
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:08,555
Good.

516
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:10,525
Well...

517
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,991
Do you want to say good night?

518
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,660
Oh, I mean, I-I don't know.

519
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,828
- I mean, you know, he's sleeping.
- Tandy, just go say good night to him.

520
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,230
- Yeah, but I don't want to bug him, he's...
- Tandy, just go say good night.

521
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,768
- Really?
- Yeah.

522
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,029
Okay.

523
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:41,221
(chuckles)

524
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,583
Uh, okay.

525
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:46,859
Maybe just for tonight.

526
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,762
Good night, little guy.

527
