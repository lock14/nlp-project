1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Hi. My name's Caveh,
and I'm about to be married.

2
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,569
Um, this isn't my first time.
I've actually been married twice before.

3
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:42,134
Um, but I'm pretty sure
it's going to be the last time.

4
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:43,804
Um...

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,247
How can I know that for sure?
I can't, obviously.

6
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:50,946
My last two marriages fell apart because
I used to have this sex addiction problem,

7
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:53,114
and I don't really have that anymore.

8
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,158
Well, at least not in the way I used to.

9
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:57,693
Um...

10
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:01,857
You see, about ten years ago I started going
to these Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings.

11
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:05,264
Hi. My name's Caveh.
I'm a sex addict.

12
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:07,269
Hi, Caveh.

13
00:01:07,337 --> 00:01:11,740
For me, it all started in Paris
about seven years ago.

14
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:23,510
Actually, I wasn't able
to raise enough money to go to Paris,

15
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:25,781
so I'm just going to shoot it here
in San Francisco,

16
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:27,345
which is where I live now.

17
00:01:27,424 --> 00:01:29,654
So if you could just pretend this is Paris...

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,193
...and that I'm 23 years old.

19
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,503
So anyway, I was walking
down the street one day...

20
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:52,671
...when I saw this prostitute.

21
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,219
<i>The first thing that struck me</i>
<i>was what she was wearing.</i>

22
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:00,919
<i>But then I noticed her</i>
<i>uncanny resemblance to my wife.</i>

23
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:05,222
<i>I thought it was strange that I should be</i>
<i>so turned on by this woman,</i>

24
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:09,197
<i>and yet no longer the least bit</i>
<i>attracted to my wife.</i>

25
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:11,028
You fucking shut the fuck up!

26
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:13,433
<i>This is Caroline, my wife.</i>

27
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:15,403
<i>How I ended up marrying her</i>

28
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:19,602
<i>instead of the person I was</i>
<i>really in love with is a long story.</i>

29
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:23,737
<i>But I should probably start by explaining</i>
<i>that I never would have married Caroline</i>

30
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:25,906
<i>if it hadn't been for the fact</i>
<i>that she was French...</i>

31
00:02:27,884 --> 00:02:29,749
<i>... and that her visa was about to expire.</i>

32
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,219
<i>Actually, let me back up a second.</i>

33
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,489
<i>This is Anna.</i>

34
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:41,962
<i>She was my first real girlfriend</i>
<i>and the love of my life.</i>

35
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,897
<i>We had met in college</i>
<i>and had been together for two years.</i>

36
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,898
<i>Now, I should probably explain</i>
<i>that ever since I was a kid,</i>

37
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:55,206
<i>I was obsessed</i>
<i>with finding my soul mate.</i>

38
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,610
<i>Every time I would meet a girl</i>
<i>I would think,</i>

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,011
<i>"Is she the one?</i>

40
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:00,615
<i>"Is she the one?</i>

41
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:02,344
<i>Or is she the one?"</i>

42
00:03:02,986 --> 00:03:06,114
<i>I was constantly falling in love</i>
<i>at the drop of a hat,</i>

43
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:10,125
<i>but the girls I was attracted to</i>
<i>never seemed to be attracted to me.</i>

44
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,859
<i>Things went on like this for years,</i>

45
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,229
<i>and I was starting to despair</i>
<i>of ever finding a soul mate.</i>

46
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:20,265
<i>And then I met Anna.</i>

47
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:23,965
<i>She had the most beautiful soul</i>
<i>of anyone I had ever met.</i>

48
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:28,636
<i>And the two years we spent together</i>
<i>were the happiest of my life.</i>

49
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,649
<i>It seemed that nothing</i>
<i>could ever come between us</i>

50
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:35,513
<i>and that we would always be together.</i>

51
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:41,680
<i>The only problem was</i>
<i>that I was a philosophy major</i>

52
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,521
<i>and believed in free love.</i>

53
00:03:46,162 --> 00:03:49,290
<i>To me, monogamy was a form</i>
<i>of private property,</i>

54
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:52,129
<i>and I was against private property.</i>

55
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:53,794
Let me try one more a different way.

56
00:03:55,605 --> 00:04:00,065
<i>Our role models at the time were</i>
<i>Jean Paul Satre and Simone de Beauvoir</i>

57
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:03,078
<i>because they were said to have had</i>
<i>a polygamous relationship</i>

58
00:04:03,146 --> 00:04:05,114
<i>which had lasted their entire lives.</i>

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,742
<i>Anna had had affairs,</i>
<i>and so had I.</i>

60
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:13,779
<i>Of course, we both got jealous at times,</i>

61
00:04:13,857 --> 00:04:17,190
<i>but we believed that jealousy</i>
<i>was something to be transcended</i>

62
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,127
<i>and that it was possible to love</i>
<i>more than one person at a time...</i>

63
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:24,062
<i>... which is how I ended up</i>
<i>becoming involved with Caroline.</i>

64
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:30,468
<i>We had met in Paris</i>
<i>a few months earlier</i>

65
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,405
<i>and had spent three</i>
<i>idyllic days together.</i>

66
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:37,174
I know I said that we couldn't afford
to shoot in Paris, and we really can't,

67
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,715
but the actress playing Caroline,

68
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:44,242
her visa expired and she actually
had to go back to France

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,050
before we could finish the film.

70
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:49,853
Actually, let me back up a little.

71
00:04:49,926 --> 00:04:53,623
You see, I had a really hard time
finding a French actress to play my wife.

72
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,687
And then one day
I saw this woman on the street

73
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,960
who looked a lot like the real Caroline.

74
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:01,231
So I started talking to her
and found out that she was French.

75
00:05:01,304 --> 00:05:03,033
So I asked her to audition.

76
00:05:03,106 --> 00:05:06,735
So what do you do for money?
What's your business?

77
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:08,367
I have a make-up company.

78
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,435
Oh, really?
Are you a make-up artist?

79
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:13,277
Well, actually,
I teach people to do make-up.

80
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,408
Really? So you're
a make-up artist teacher?

81
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:16,679
Yes, I am.

82
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:18,311
Now, I should probably explain

83
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:21,289
that the real Caroline
was also a make-up artist,

84
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:25,987
which I took as a sign that I had found
the perfect person to play the role.

85
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:29,964
But then a few months later,
when we were about to do re-shoots,

86
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,933
something really weird happened.

87
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:35,198
Okay, something really weird
just happened.

88
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:40,903
I was looking for a French prostitute

89
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:43,411
to act in the movie
for the prostitute scene.

90
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,208
Where is it?

91
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,646
There it is.

92
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:51,483
I found this face that says Rebecca Lord.

93
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:53,181
So I open it...

94
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,418
And I'm like...

95
00:05:57,493 --> 00:06:00,223
"Porn Star Rebecca Lord, French."

96
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:04,357
And I'm like, "Wow, she looks
so much like Caroline."

97
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,328
I go down.

98
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:11,237
I'm like, "She looks
so much like Caroline."

99
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:14,435
And then it says here,

100
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,172
"working first as a make-up artist."

101
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,804
That's what Caroline was.

102
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:24,413
And then it says that she'll be visiting
San Francisco August 7th through 11th.

103
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:26,512
That's when we're shooting
our re-shoots.

104
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,784
And I'm like, "Wait a minute.

105
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:33,955
Caroline... is a prostitute?"

106
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,029
And then there's all these movies.

107
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,331
Here's her list of credits.

108
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:50,305
<i>Sluts of France.</i>

109
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:58,384
So I had inadvertently cast a porn star
to play my French wife.

110
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:01,320
But anyway, getting back to the story.

111
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,090
<i>We had met in Paris a few months earlier</i>

112
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:08,995
<i>and had spent three idyllic days together.</i>

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,968
<i>I had been totally honest with Caroline</i>

114
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:15,937
<i>about my relationship with Anna</i>
<i>and had even asked her...</i>

115
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,303
Do you ever get jealous?

116
00:07:18,374 --> 00:07:19,466
<i>To which she had answered...</i>

117
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:22,204
Life is too short for that.

118
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,838
<i>I was blown away by her answer</i>

119
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:28,372
<i>and I found myself starting</i>
<i>to fall in love with Caroline.</i>

120
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,682
<i>But I still believed that Anna</i>
<i>was the true love of my life.</i>

121
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,958
<i>But then a month later,</i>
<i>Caroline flew to the States to see me,</i>

122
00:07:38,027 --> 00:07:40,621
<i>and it was then that the trouble started.</i>

123
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:43,631
<i>You see,</i>
<i>Anna became jealous of Caroline</i>

124
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:46,634
<i>and insisted that I choose between them.</i>

125
00:07:46,702 --> 00:07:48,932
<i>I didn't want to choose between them.</i>

126
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,064
<i>I wanted to be able to see them both.</i>

127
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,836
<i>But then Anna got</i>
<i>a summer internship in New York,</i>

128
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:58,904
<i>and Caroline and I ended up</i>
<i>spending the summer together.</i>

129
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:02,212
<i>Which is why when her visa expired.</i>

130
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,914
<i>I offered to marry her</i>
<i>so that she could stay in the States.</i>

131
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:10,650
Now, I should probably explain
that I wasn't exactly the marrying type.

132
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,695
In fact, I was totally against marriage.

133
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:16,755
You see, I had grown up
during the Vietnam War

134
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,893
<i>and I saw marriage as pat</i>
<i>of the same capitalist system</i>

135
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:22,028
<i>that had produced</i>
<i>the genocide in Vietnam.</i>

136
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:32,412
<i>But I was also influenced</i>
<i>by performance at...</i>

137
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:36,675
<i>... and by the idea of life itself</i>
<i>as a kind of performance piece.</i>

138
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:43,054
<i>And to me the institution of marriage</i>
<i>was so inherently absurd</i>

139
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:46,254
<i>that I tried to subvert it</i>
<i>by treating it as performance art.</i>

140
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:47,421
I do.

141
00:08:47,497 --> 00:08:51,194
<i>Except that the joke,</i>
<i>as it turned out, was on me.</i>

142
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,634
<i>Because when Anna found out</i>
<i>that I had gotten married to Caroline,</i>

143
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,695
<i>she didn't take it so well.</i>

144
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,602
<i>And then I did something</i>
<i>incredibly dumb.</i>

145
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:04,603
<i>You see, Caroline and I were</i>
<i>about to run out of money...</i>

146
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:11,186
<i>... and the idea of having to get a job was,</i>
<i>in my mind, a fate worse than death.</i>

147
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:14,722
<i>The only occupation I was interested in</i>

148
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,418
<i>was that of famous filmmaker.</i>

149
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,791
<i>But the few experimental films</i>
<i>that I had made</i>

150
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:24,094
<i>hadn't exactly been greeted</i>
<i>with enthusiasm by the film world.</i>

151
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,074
<i>To remedy this situation,</i>

152
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:40,377
<i>I had recently written a script</i>
<i>about the French poet Arthur Rimbaud</i>

153
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:43,441
<i>which I was convinced</i>
<i>would revolutionize cinema...</i>

154
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:49,521
<i>... and which Caroline insisted it would</i>
<i>be easy to raise money for in France.</i>

155
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,152
It will be easy to raise money
for this in France.

156
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,991
<i>But moving to France</i>
<i>turned out to be a disaster.</i>

157
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:04,764
<i>Most of the film producers I approached</i>
<i>wouldn't even talk to me.</i>

158
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,708
<i>The few that did</i>
<i>just told me that I was nobody.</i>

159
00:10:10,146 --> 00:10:13,513
<i>Meanwhile, my relationship</i>
<i>with Caroline had started to unravel.</i>

160
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:19,110
<i>Caroline was insanely jealous of Anna</i>
<i>and would cry hysterically</i>

161
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:21,713
<i>whenever I would write her a letter</i>
<i>or talk to her on the phone.</i>

162
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,315
Hi, how are you doing?

163
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:26,691
<i>I was starting to feel trapped,</i>
<i>and it was hard not to blame Caroline</i>

164
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:31,256
<i>for having gotten in the way</i>
<i>of my relationship with Anna.</i>

165
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:34,462
<i>And then one day,</i>
<i>I got a letter from Anna</i>

166
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:37,165
<i>saying that she was going</i>
<i>to be in Amsterdam</i>

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,640
<i>and asking</i>
<i>if I would like to meet her there.</i>

168
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:42,775
<i>I was ecstatic.</i>

169
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:46,372
<i>I felt that I was finally being given a chance</i>
<i>to get back together with Anna.</i>

170
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:51,646
<i>But Caroline knew that if I left</i>
<i>I would never come back,</i>

171
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:53,712
<i>so she decided to jump out a window.</i>

172
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:57,893
<i>The thought of being responsible</i>
<i>for her death</i>

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,758
<i>- was way more guilt than I could handle.</i>

174
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,799
- Caroline! Caroline!
- No! No!

175
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:08,998
<i>So I agreed never to see Anna again.</i>

176
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:18,739
<i>It was by far the most</i>
<i>painful decision I ever made.</i>

177
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:22,309
<i>But I did it because years</i>
<i>of going to Sunday school</i>

178
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,616
<i>had taught me to equate virtue</i>
<i>with sacrifice.</i>

179
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,350
- Can I come down?
One more time.

180
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:34,624
<i>I should probably also explain</i>
<i>that when I was in college</i>

181
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,460
<i>I had once asked my friend Arnold...</i>

182
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:43,231
What's your, like, ultimate goal in life?

183
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:44,637
<i>And he had said...</i>

184
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,572
To be a saint.

185
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,633
<i>I'd been blown away by his answer...</i>

186
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:53,104
<i>... and I decided that I too</i>
<i>would try to become a saint.</i>

187
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:58,575
<i>Which is why,</i>
<i>when Caroline asked me</i>

188
00:11:58,654 --> 00:12:02,215
<i>to cut all ties with the only person</i>
<i>I had ever truly loved,</i>

189
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,088
<i>I agreed.</i>

190
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,494
<i>When I found out much later</i>

191
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:12,329
<i>that Anna had gotten married</i>
<i>to someone else,</i>

192
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:14,631
<i>I was devastated.</i>

193
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:19,698
<i>I had still been secretly hoping that Caroline</i>
<i>and I would eventually break up</i>

194
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:22,903
<i>and that Anna and I</i>
<i>would one day get back together.</i>

195
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:26,539
<i>But now I realized that it was really over.</i>

196
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:33,247
<i>I tried my best to transcend my feelings</i>

197
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:37,486
<i>and to resign myself</i>
<i>to a life of quiet desperation.</i>

198
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,757
<i>But the truth is I was incredibly angry.</i>

199
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,730
<i>I was angry at God,</i>

200
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:44,561
<i>I was angry at Caroline,</i>

201
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,124
<i>and I was angry at myself.</i>

202
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:50,400
<i>But mostly I was angry at Caroline.</i>

203
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:55,208
<i>And then one day</i>
<i>I was walking down the street</i>

204
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:59,008
<i>when I saw... this prostitute.</i>

205
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:03,779
<i>There was something about her</i>

206
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:07,721
<i>that turned me on in a way</i>
<i>that I had never been turned on before.</i>

207
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:11,683
<i>It was as if I had been hypnotized.</i>

208
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:23,837
<i>And then I suddenly found myself saying</i>
<i>something that I had never said before.</i>

209
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:25,669
<i>I said the words...</i>

210
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,447
Now, I should probably explain that I had
always considered myself a feminist

211
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:35,951
and had even marched
in an anti-pornography rally once.

212
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:39,721
<i>Which is why</i>

213
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:42,121
when I suddenly found
myself saying the words...

214
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,455
...I half expected the prostitute
to run screaming...

215
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:50,591
<i>... or to slap me in the face.</i>

216
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:56,862
<i>The fact that she didn't,</i>
<i>but smiled instead and said...</i>

217
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,533
<i>... made my head spin.</i>

218
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,824
<i>Afterwards, I was a nervous wreck.</i>

219
00:14:21,964 --> 00:14:23,955
<i>I couldn't get her out of my mind.</i>

220
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:38,370
Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:52,518
<i>I thought that if I masturbated,</i>
<i>I would get her out of my system.</i>

222
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:55,430
<i>But it didn't work.</i>

223
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:01,725
<i>So after several days</i>
<i>of compulsive masturbation,</i>

224
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:04,329
<i>I decided that I needed a new strategy.</i>

225
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:18,144
<i>You see, I knew that she was</i>
<i>just a regular person.</i>

226
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,919
<i>But in my mind, I had somehow made her</i>
<i>into an image of erotic salvation.</i>

227
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:28,758
<i>And it seemed that the only way to get her</i>
<i>off the erotic pedestal that I had put her on</i>

228
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:31,061
<i>was to have a real conversation with her.</i>

229
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:38,173
<i>Unfortunately, she wasn't there.</i>

230
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:56,555
<i>I was mad at myself for having wasted</i>
<i>so many hours of my day,</i>

231
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,889
<i>but I didn't want to leave empty-handed.</i>

232
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:34,625
<i>I asked that same question to every</i>
<i>prostitute that was there that day.</i>

233
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:37,029
<i>I might even have asked</i>
<i>some of them twice.</i>

234
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,567
<i>Afterwards, I felt strangely euphoric.</i>

235
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:46,702
<i>And I returned home feeling that I had</i>
<i>finally gotten this thing out of my system.</i>

236
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,672
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

237
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:54,204
<i>Instead of fantasizing</i>
<i>about just the one prostitute,</i>

238
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,683
<i>I was now fantasizing about all of them.</i>

239
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,547
<i>I went back the next day...</i>

240
00:17:00,623 --> 00:17:03,387
<i>and the next day...</i>

241
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:05,359
<i>and the next.</i>

242
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:09,858
<i>At first it was enough just to talk to them...</i>

243
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,561
<i>... and to fantasize</i>
<i>about them afterwards.</i>

244
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:21,342
<i>But after a while, just talking to them</i>
<i>was no longer enough.</i>

245
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:32,646
Now, I know that a lot of guys
in my situation

246
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:35,212
would have just gone ahead
and had sex with the prostitute

247
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,315
and not told their wife about it.

248
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:39,861
But I had this thing about honesty.

249
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:42,260
<i>You see, when I was a kid,</i>

250
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:45,630
<i>my mother found out that my father</i>
<i>had been cheating on her</i>

251
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:49,228
<i>and made him drive my sister and me</i>
<i>to this other woman's apartment</i>

252
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:52,398
<i>in order to humiliate him in front of us.</i>

253
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:55,068
<i>I was too young to know what sex was,</i>

254
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:57,510
<i>but I knew that it was a very bad thing</i>

255
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,878
<i>and that it was responsible</i>
<i>for my parents' divorce.</i>

256
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:04,146
<i>I was only eight years old at the time,</i>

257
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:06,210
<i>but I began to hate my father.</i>

258
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:09,189
<i>And I vowed to myself</i>
<i>that I would never be like him.</i>

259
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:27,939
You know, if you really need
to see a prostitute, you can.

260
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,946
I don't want to see a prostitute.
I want to try to resist.

261
00:18:32,014 --> 00:18:33,709
But I think I need your help.

262
00:18:33,782 --> 00:18:35,977
What do you want me to do?

263
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:38,349
I just need to be able to talk to you.

264
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,389
I think if I can talk to you about it,
I'll be less tempted,

265
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:43,220
and it'll be easier for me to resist.

266
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:45,886
You can talk to me about it.

267
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,588
I can?

268
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:49,995
Of course.

269
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,589
Ohh.

270
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:55,232
God, I feel so much better.

271
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:01,467
Are you tempted to have
intercourse with a prostitute

272
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:05,741
or just to get a blow job?

273
00:19:05,814 --> 00:19:07,714
Oh, no. Just get a blow job.

274
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:11,014
I would never want to have intercourse
with one. That would gross me out.

275
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,577
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

276
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:16,385
You're the only person I'd ever want
to have intercourse with.

277
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:17,891
You promise?

278
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,656
Yeah, I promise.

279
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,067
Is there anything I can do
to make you less tempted?

280
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:34,567
Maybe if you could give me
blow jobs more often?

281
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,270
I don't mind.

282
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:39,405
I can even give you a blow job
right now if you like.

283
00:19:41,617 --> 00:19:42,777
Okay.

284
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:49,549
<i>I felt guilty accepting her offer,</i>

285
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,991
<i>but I thought it might be a good idea.</i>

286
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:07,104
<i>I was still fantasizing</i>
<i>that she was a prostitute,</i>

287
00:20:07,176 --> 00:20:09,906
<i>but the fact that she knew</i>
<i>and accepted this part of me</i>

288
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:12,276
<i>made it different than before.</i>

289
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:17,284
<i>It made it something we were sharing,</i>
<i>something that we were doing together.</i>

290
00:20:17,352 --> 00:20:20,583
<i>And I felt that I was seeing Caroline</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

291
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:27,193
After I came, I was still hard.

292
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:30,356
This was something that had
never happened to me before.

293
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:33,367
It was as if my no longer
having to repress my sexuality

294
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:37,531
had suddenly unleashed a backlog
of repressed sexual energy.

295
00:20:37,606 --> 00:20:40,006
So Caroline offered to give me
another blow job.

296
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,107
To my astonishment, I was still hard.

297
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:51,209
So Caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job.

298
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:58,385
Afterwards, I was still hard.

299
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,988
I had never seen anything like it,
and I actually started to get scared.

300
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:08,264
I was afraid that my erection had become
permanent and would never go away.

301
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:10,805
Caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job,

302
00:21:10,873 --> 00:21:13,364
but I had recently
gotten a job as a film critic

303
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:16,036
and I didn't want to be late
to my first screening.

304
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:23,980
On the way there
my erection finally subsided.

305
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:35,324
At that moment I was filled
with boundless love for Caroline,

306
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,865
and I felt closer to her than ever before.

307
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,500
As part of our newfound intimacy,

308
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:46,473
I started pointing out to Caroline
the women I was attracted to.

309
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,532
I like that one.

310
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,044
That one?
She's gross!

311
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:53,172
Not to me.

312
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:56,615
- I like that one, too.
- You're kidding, right?

313
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:58,710
No, I'm serious.
She's exactly my type.

314
00:21:58,787 --> 00:22:00,186
But she's so vulgar.

315
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:03,986
I know. That's what I like
about her. It's true.

316
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:09,022
Did you see that woman?
I would love to have sex with her.

317
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:17,700
It was great to be able
to be totally honest with Caroline,

318
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:20,765
and I felt that I was finally having
the kind of open and honest relationship

319
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:23,072
that I'd always dreamed of.

320
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:26,408
Whoa! Look at those lips.

321
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,745
I would love a blow job from her.

322
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,010
Did you see that?

323
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,686
<i>But after a while,</i>
<i>Caroline couldn't take it anymore.</i>

324
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,704
- What's the matter?
- What do you think?

325
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:03,478
I'm sick and tired of you
staring at other women all the time!

326
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:05,679
- It's humiliating!
- What do you want me to do?

327
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,552
You want me to hide the fact
that I'm attracted to somebody?

328
00:23:08,623 --> 00:23:13,686
How would you like it if you saw me drooling
over every guy I was attracted to? Huh?

329
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:16,697
Well, I'd probably feel a little jealous,
but I'd try to transcend it.

330
00:23:17,966 --> 00:23:19,399
I would!

331
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:21,629
Didn't you say you wanted me
to be totally honest?

332
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:23,671
Well, I've changed my mind!

333
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,974
But my not being able
to be totally honest with her

334
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:33,276
made me feel alienated once again.

335
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:38,285
<i>And I started obsessing about the various</i>
<i>women I would see on the street.</i>

336
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:39,786
<i>I remember this one time,</i>

337
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:43,814
<i>I saw a woman on the subway</i>
<i>that I was particularly attracted to.</i>

338
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:49,820
<i>I don't know what I was thinking.</i>
<i>but I suddenly started following her.</i>

339
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,829
<i>For some reason, I was dying</i>
<i>to reach out and touch her butt.</i>

340
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,815
<i>And I was trying to get up</i>
<i>the courage to do this</i>

341
00:24:07,883 --> 00:24:10,852
<i>when her boyfriend suddenly appeared.</i>

342
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,850
<i>But I had been so turned on by her</i>
<i>that all I wanted to do was masturbate.</i>

343
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:25,867
<i>The only place I could find</i>
<i>was a confessional.</i>

344
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:34,034
<i>There was something</i>
<i>about masturbating in a confessional</i>

345
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,441
<i>that appealed to my sense</i>
<i>of transgression.</i>

346
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:42,472
<i>And it wasn't long before I had masturbated</i>
<i>in every cathedral in Paris.</i>

347
00:24:43,285 --> 00:24:47,278
<i>Meanwhile, Caroline and I had</i>
<i>started fighting more and more,</i>

348
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:50,119
<i>and I had started threatening</i>
<i>to have sex with a prostitute</i>

349
00:24:50,192 --> 00:24:52,285
<i>in order to get her</i>
<i>to stop fighting with me.</i>

350
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,555
I'm going to go have sex with a prostitute!

351
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:58,656
Fine! Go get your dick sucked
by a prostitute! See if I care!

352
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:06,402
Pssh!

353
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:10,468
<i>And then one day I somehow</i>
<i>managed to convince myself</i>

354
00:25:10,545 --> 00:25:14,845
<i>that I was hurting her more by constantly</i>
<i>threatening to have sex with a prostitute</i>

355
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,577
<i>than I would by just doing it</i>

356
00:25:16,651 --> 00:25:18,983
<i>and getting it out of my system</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

357
00:25:40,976 --> 00:25:43,843
<i>I wanted to reach out and touch her butt,</i>

358
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:46,472
<i>but I felt shy.</i>

359
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:48,709
<i>I didn't know if that was allowed.</i>

360
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,367
Uh...

361
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:04,749
Um...

362
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,239
<i>I was certainly tempted,</i>

363
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:40,687
<i>but I had every intention of resisting having</i>
<i>intercourse until she said the words...</i>

364
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:48,656
<i>For some reason, those words triggered</i>
<i>a chemical reaction in my brain.</i>

365
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,164
<i>And it was suddenly as if I had no choice.</i>

366
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,571
<i>I'm not sure why...</i>

367
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:04,309
<i>... but the fact that her delivery</i>
<i>was so unconvincing</i>

368
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:06,506
<i>just turned me on even more.</i>

369
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:38,073
There's something I have to tell you.

370
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:41,809
I know.
You had sex with a prostitute.

371
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:47,544
How'd you know?

372
00:29:49,924 --> 00:29:51,414
I can tell.

373
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,186
You're not mad at me?

374
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:57,797
No, I'm not mad at you.

375
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:03,968
I think it was the right thing to do

376
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:06,563
because now I've finally
gotten it out of my system.

377
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:12,302
I love you.

378
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:16,178
I know. Just please,
go take a shower.

379
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:42,243
So, tell me what happened.

380
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:47,911
I told her the whole story.

381
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:51,941
But when I got to the part about
the intercourse, she got pretty upset.

382
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,647
You had intercourse?

383
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,279
Yeah.

384
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:58,052
But I used a condom.

385
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,356
You promised you weren't going to!

386
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:02,396
I know, I'm sorry.

387
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:07,527
I tried not to, but I couldn't help myself.

388
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:14,666
She said the words "rape me,"
and I just got really turned on after that.

389
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:20,544
<i>Now, I think I should explain that this was</i>
<i>especially difficult for Caroline to hear</i>

390
00:31:20,615 --> 00:31:23,482
<i>because she herself had been raped.</i>

391
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:28,954
<i>I had hoped that being completely honest</i>
<i>would bring us closer together,</i>

392
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:31,457
<i>but I had seriously miscalculated.</i>

393
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:40,466
I don't want to have sex tonight.

394
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,935
I wasn't suggesting it.

395
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:45,666
It's not to punish you, you know.

396
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,729
I know.

397
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:50,335
It's just, I need more time to get over it.

398
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:52,845
I understand.
Take all the time you need.

399
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:55,375
Thanks.

400
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:04,018
<i>I was surprised at how little time</i>
<i>it took for her to get over it.</i>

401
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,125
<i>It only took three days.</i>

402
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:13,200
<i>After that, everything seemed</i>
<i>pretty much back to normal.</i>

403
00:32:13,268 --> 00:32:17,432
<i>Except for one thing...</i>
<i>Caroline started having fainting spells.</i>

404
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,331
Caroline! Caroline!
What's the matter?

405
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:24,742
I don't know.
I don't feel well.

406
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:29,010
<i>We went to see several doctors to try</i>
<i>to figure out what was wrong with her,</i>

407
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:31,574
<i>but none of them</i>
<i>could ever find anything.</i>

408
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:33,280
She's perfectly fine.

409
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:42,090
You know, it's been over two months
since we've had sex.

410
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:47,364
If you want me to suck you,
I'll suck you.

411
00:32:47,435 --> 00:32:49,164
That's not why I'm saying it.

412
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:51,899
I'm saying it because I think
maybe you're mad at me.

413
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:57,502
I'm not mad at you.
I just haven't been feeling well.

414
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:00,241
Okay.

415
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,055
Are you sure you don't want me
to give you oral sex?

416
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:12,388
Caveh, I really don't feel well.

417
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,654
Okay.

418
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:22,301
This went on for a whole year,

419
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,136
during which my desire to have sex
with a prostitute gradually returned.

420
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:49,322
<i>I tried to escape my marital unhappiness</i>

421
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:51,297
<i>by throwing myself into my work...</i>

422
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:52,526
Higher!

423
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:55,230
I said higher!

424
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:58,067
<i>... but I was unable to raise money</i>
<i>for any of my film projects.</i>

425
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,299
Higher!

426
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:05,110
What's the matter with you?
Can't you jump higher than that?

427
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,411
<i>Out of desperation, I had applied</i>
<i>to film school back in the States.</i>

428
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:25,499
<i>Soon after we moved to Los Angeles,</i>

429
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:29,229
<i>Caroline confessed to me that she</i>
<i>had fallen in love with my friend Gary...</i>

430
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:32,796
<i>... and then she fell in love</i>
<i>with my friend Keith...</i>

431
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:37,141
<i>... and then she fell in love</i>
<i>with my friend Teddy.</i>

432
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:40,408
<i>A week later</i>
<i>she and Teddy moved in together,</i>

433
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:42,881
<i>and a year later they were married.</i>

434
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:46,379
<i>This is the real Caroline.</i>

435
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:49,685
<i>I asked her to play herself in the movie,</i>
<i>but she declined.</i>

436
00:34:51,426 --> 00:34:53,826
<i>I tried to stay in touch over the years,</i>

437
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:57,854
<i>but after a while Caroline</i>
<i>stopped returning my calls.</i>

438
00:35:00,334 --> 00:35:04,168
I realize I haven't made it seem
like I was in love with Caroline,

439
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:07,173
but the truth is I really was,

440
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:10,267
as much as I was capable
of loving anyone.

441
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:13,245
I mean, I was only 26 at the time.

442
00:35:17,318 --> 00:35:22,187
<i>After the break-up, all I could think about</i>
<i>was finding someone to have sex with.</i>

443
00:35:36,204 --> 00:35:38,263
Hi, can I get in?

444
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,636
How much?

445
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:41,766
How much do you want to spend?

446
00:35:43,745 --> 00:35:44,905
Thirty?

447
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,742
Okay. Can I get in?

448
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:48,304
Okay.

449
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:57,148
- Hi, my name's Candy.
- Hi, I'm Bob.

450
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,955
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

451
00:36:16,944 --> 00:36:20,812
- Where are we going?
- Pull over right here.

452
00:36:36,164 --> 00:36:37,654
Can I have the money now?

453
00:36:37,732 --> 00:36:39,962
Oh, sure.

454
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:43,498
Um...

455
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,129
Do you have any change?

456
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:48,334
No, but If you give me 40,
I'll make it extra good.

457
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,207
Um...

458
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:53,075
Okay.

459
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,316
Look out for cops, okay?

460
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,728
Bye.

461
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:31,146
<i>Afterwards, I felt euphoric.</i>

462
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,782
<i>But by the time I got home,</i>

463
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:37,689
<i>I felt empty and depressed.</i>

464
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:42,189
<i>And I vowed never to have sex</i>
<i>with a prostitute again.</i>

465
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,265
<i>But then a few days later,</i>

466
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:50,236
<i>I found myself unable to stop obsessing</i>
<i>about that same prostitute.</i>

467
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,383
Wanna date?

468
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:09,753
<i>It was becoming a pattern.</i>

469
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:12,816
<i>Every time I would have sex</i>
<i>with a prostitute,</i>

470
00:38:12,894 --> 00:38:15,863
<i>I would feel empty</i>
<i>and depressed afterwards,</i>

471
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,330
<i>and I would vow never to do it again.</i>

472
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:22,358
And yet I honestly believed
that if I just did it enough times,

473
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:25,803
my desire to have sex with a prostitute
would eventually go away.

474
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,665
And then I met Christa.

475
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:57,363
<i>I was walking down the hallway</i>
<i>at film school</i>

476
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,770
<i>when I saw her for the first time.</i>

477
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,501
Hi.

478
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:06,739
<i>It was unusual for a woman</i>
<i>I had never met to say hi to me.</i>

479
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:11,278
<i>Because she did, I assumed</i>
<i>she wanted to have sex.</i>

480
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:19,716
<i>And then a few days later,</i>
<i>I saw her again.</i>

481
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:29,902
Excuse me.

482
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,569
Do you know
how to open these?

483
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:35,233
I can't figure it out.

484
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,437
I can try.

485
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:42,709
Here you go.

486
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:45,013
It just twists off, huh?

487
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:49,755
You like Capra?

488
00:39:49,824 --> 00:39:51,587
I love Capra.

489
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:55,525
- Hi, my name's Caveh.
- Hi, I'm Christa.

490
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,723
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

491
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,630
<i>So anyway, she invited me to a party</i>
<i>she was giving that Friday night...</i>

492
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:07,907
<i>... and I went,</i>
<i>hoping to have sex with her.</i>

493
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:13,275
- Is Christa here?
- Yeah, come on in.

494
00:40:20,354 --> 00:40:23,016
<i>I failed to get her to have sex with me.</i>

495
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,052
<i>But I did get her to lend me</i>
<i>a copy of her screenplay.</i>

496
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,120
<i>It was one of the best screenplays</i>
<i>I'd ever read.</i>

497
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,504
<i>And I felt that I had finally found</i>
<i>someone that I could relate to.</i>

498
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:46,012
<i>I called her immediately</i>
<i>and asked her out.</i>

499
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:58,484
<i>It was then that it happened,</i>

500
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:03,051
<i>I looked into her eyes</i>
<i>and I saw her soul.</i>

501
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:08,567
<i>Until then, she had just been someone</i>
<i>that I wanted something from.</i>

502
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:13,571
<i>But at that moment I suddenly</i>
<i>saw that she was a real human being,</i>

503
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:16,542
<i>with needs and feelings of her own.</i>

504
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,468
<i>It scared the shit out of me.</i>

505
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:35,090
<i>And then one night we were watching</i>
Vivre Sa Vie <i>by Jean-Luc Godard,</i>

506
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:37,926
<i>about a woman who becomes a prostitute.</i>

507
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,334
You know what I heard?

508
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,161
What?

509
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:46,638
I heard that Godard has
a prostitute fetish in real life.

510
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,538
Can you believe that?

511
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:50,509
Yeah.

512
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:56,476
I can't.
He seems so sensitive to women.

513
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,040
Well, that doesn't mean anything.

514
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,079
I mean, I'm sensitive to women,
and I have a prostitute fetish.

515
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,656
You're kidding, right?

516
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:08,422
No, I'm serious.

517
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:11,721
I can't believe that.

518
00:42:11,799 --> 00:42:14,427
Well, it's true.

519
00:42:14,502 --> 00:42:18,461
Caveh, how is that possible?
I mean, how can you justify that to yourself?

520
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:21,030
Well, I agree it's not
super spiritual or anything,

521
00:42:21,108 --> 00:42:24,043
but I don't think it's so terrible either.

522
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:28,070
Caveh, it's like rape!
Those women have no choice.

523
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:30,982
Everybody has a choice.
Or else nobody does.

524
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,814
I can't believe you're saying this.

525
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:34,616
Well, it's true.

526
00:42:36,957 --> 00:42:38,254
What are you doing?

527
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:41,624
I'm sorry. I have to leave.
I feel like I'm going to be sick.

528
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:44,357
Why, because I've had sex
with prostitutes?

529
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:46,058
Caveh, you don't understand.

530
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:49,967
I literally feel like
I'm going to throw up. I have to go.

531
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:53,472
Christa!

532
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:03,281
<i>A few days later, I saw her again.</i>

533
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,840
Hi.

534
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:06,179
Hi.

535
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:14,526
- Still feeling nauseous?
- No.

536
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,455
Sure you don't mind
being seen with me?

537
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:19,226
Stop it.

538
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,895
I'm sorry. I just felt like
you thought I was disgusting.

539
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,938
I don't think that.

540
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:28,506
It's not like I'm still doing it.

541
00:43:28,576 --> 00:43:30,669
I know. I'm sorry.

542
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:33,573
I don't want to have to
hide anything from you.

543
00:43:33,647 --> 00:43:36,172
- Don't you want me to be honest?
- I do.

544
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:39,582
Caveh, let's make up.

545
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:52,193
<i>A few weeks later</i>
<i>it was my birthday.</i>

546
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:56,768
<i>And I convinced Christa to take</i>
<i>Ecstasy with me to celebrate.</i>

547
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,668
- Okay.
- Thank you.

548
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:09,482
<i>That night, we felt closer</i>
<i>to each other than ever before.</i>

549
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,112
<i>But Ecstasy isn't just a love drug.</i>
<i>It's also a truth serum.</i>

550
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:16,088
I love you so much.

551
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,714
I love you, too.

552
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,759
- You do?
- I do.

553
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,694
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

554
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:28,891
Caveh, I don't.

555
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:32,561
I don't either.

556
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:35,669
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

557
00:44:35,743 --> 00:44:37,734
- You'll tell me the truth?
- Yeah.

558
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:43,216
There isn't anything that you've never
told me before, is there?

559
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,213
I can take it.

560
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:48,755
- Yeah, there's one thing.
- What?

561
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:51,882
I've been wanting to tell you
but I've been scared.

562
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:55,861
- Caveh, you can tell me anything.
- Okay. Okay.

563
00:44:57,398 --> 00:45:00,799
- Sometimes when we're having sex...
- Yeah?

564
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:03,098
...I fantasize about other women.

565
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,742
<i>Christa was devastated by my confession</i>

566
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,711
<i>and became hyper-sensitive</i>
<i>about other women.</i>

567
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:17,546
<i>She would notice them</i>
<i>even before I would</i>

568
00:45:17,618 --> 00:45:21,679
<i>and immediately scrutinize my face</i>
<i>for any sign of interest.</i>

569
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:25,350
<i>It was unnerving after a while.</i>
<i>So I tried to be upfront about it.</i>

570
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:26,950
She's pretty sexy.

571
00:45:27,027 --> 00:45:29,689
She's more your type
than I am, isn't she?

572
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,526
What are you talking about?

573
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:40,766
And then one day I was on my way
to meet Christa for lunch

574
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:43,207
when I decided to stop and get some gas.

575
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:53,815
<i>There was something about the way</i>
<i>the woman was bending over</i>

576
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:55,582
<i>that turned me on.</i>

577
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:08,024
- Hi. I'm really sorry I'm late.
- Caveh, I've been waiting.

578
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:10,935
I know, I'm sorry.
I had a little masturbatory episode.

579
00:46:11,004 --> 00:46:12,232
What?

580
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,967
I had to stop for gas, and...

581
00:46:16,043 --> 00:46:18,511
Did you just say
"a little masturbatory episode"?

582
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:20,171
Yeah. I had to stop for gas,

583
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:23,683
and there was this woman who was
kind of bending over to put gas in her car,

584
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:26,015
and she was really sexy,

585
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:31,183
and I just got really turned on
at the way she was bending over,

586
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:36,321
and I stopped at my apartment
so I could, you know, masturbate.

587
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:39,195
But it was really no big deal.
I just thought I should tell you.

588
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:40,426
I just...

589
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,271
- I just don't want to talk about it.
- What about truth?

590
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,574
- I don't want you to tell me every single day.
- Don't you want to know the truth?

591
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:54,841
I already know these things
are happening, Caveh.

592
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:57,475
I know you. I know you.
I understand you.

593
00:46:57,551 --> 00:47:00,042
And believe me,
it will be much better with us.

594
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,519
Don't tell me.

595
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:05,522
- I don't want to know.
- Okay, fine.

596
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:07,082
Don't tell me.

597
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:13,761
And then one night I happened to watch
a news program on massage parlors.

598
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:17,292
<i>Vice investigators say</i>
<i>they've recently found seven brothels</i>

599
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:19,396
<i>masquerading as massage parlors.</i>

600
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:22,909
<i>Police say these busts</i>
<i>are just the tip of the iceberg</i>

601
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:27,242
<i>and that many massage parlors</i>
<i>are actually fronts for prostitution.</i>

602
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:30,681
<i>This is Maya Ellington</i>
<i>reporting for Channel 3 News.</i>

603
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:45,528
Want a massage?

604
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,623
Um...

605
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,827
Yeah. Um...

606
00:47:48,902 --> 00:47:50,699
How much?

607
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,501
Forty dollars for half-hour.

608
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:55,041
Um...

609
00:47:55,108 --> 00:47:57,167
Does that include everything?

610
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:59,644
That includes a half-hour.

611
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:01,203
Um...

612
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:04,341
- Who gives the massages?
- Different girls.

613
00:48:04,418 --> 00:48:06,978
- Are you one of them?
- No.

614
00:48:07,054 --> 00:48:08,419
Um...

615
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,286
Can I see what they look like?

616
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:12,791
No. You have to pay first.

617
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:17,623
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

618
00:48:17,698 --> 00:48:19,188
- I'm sorry.
- Get out of here!

619
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:20,255
I'm sorry.

620
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:22,302
You get out of here!

621
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:23,893
Get out of here!

622
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:29,174
<i>I visited every massage parlor in L.A.</i>

623
00:48:32,513 --> 00:48:34,447
<i>At first, it turned me on</i>

624
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:38,110
<i>just to grab the receptionists' breasts</i>
<i>and get thrown out.</i>

625
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:42,920
<i>But after a while, even this</i>
<i>was no longer exciting enough.</i>

626
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:48,786
And then one day I had an idea.

627
00:48:57,237 --> 00:49:01,435
I think maybe the reason I haven't
been able to get over my prostitute fetish

628
00:49:01,508 --> 00:49:04,739
is because I've never really
gone all the way with one.

629
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,176
What do you mean?

630
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:08,680
Greg was my best friend at the time.

631
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:13,846
<i>We had met at UCLA and had made</i>
<i>a few student films together.</i>

632
00:49:13,921 --> 00:49:18,255
I mean, I've never really treated one
the way I do in my fantasies.

633
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:19,758
Which is how?

634
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:21,794
Which is pretty violent.

635
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:25,559
Like in my fantasies
I'll grab whoever it is by the hair

636
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:29,591
and I'll make her say things like
"I wanna suck your dick" and stuff,

637
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,571
and maybe call her a bitch or a slut,

638
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,575
and then start fucking her really hard
in the mouth and make her gag and stuff.

639
00:49:36,643 --> 00:49:37,905
Interesting.

640
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:40,538
But in real life, I've never done that.

641
00:49:40,614 --> 00:49:42,445
Why not?

642
00:49:42,516 --> 00:49:45,451
Because I want them to like me.

643
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,214
I see.

644
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:51,417
So what I'm thinking is that maybe
if I went to a prostitute one last time

645
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:55,086
and just did everything
I always fantasize about doing,

646
00:49:55,162 --> 00:50:00,031
then I think maybe I could get it
out of my system once and for all.

647
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,933
Will they let you do those things?

648
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:04,197
Um...

649
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:06,205
I assume.

650
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,665
Sounds like it's worth a try.

651
00:50:11,945 --> 00:50:13,435
It is, right?

652
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:15,913
Yeah, give it a try.

653
00:50:15,983 --> 00:50:19,043
But I couldn't do it behind Christa's back.

654
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,316
I mean, I had to tell her, right?

655
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:24,856
Are you serious?

656
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:27,621
Christa, I can't keep repressing my lust.
It's not healthy.

657
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:29,685
What do you want me to do?
Say okay?

658
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:31,287
- Yeah.
- Well, it's not okay.

659
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:34,232
If you have sex with a prostitute,
it's over between us!

660
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:37,498
Christa, please, try to understand.
It's just something that I have to do.

661
00:50:37,571 --> 00:50:40,301
I can't believe you'd be willing
to sacrifice our relationship

662
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,934
just in order to fulfill some sick fantasy!

663
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,001
I have no intention
of sacrificing our relationship.

664
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:47,069
I'd be doing this
to strengthen our relationship.

665
00:50:50,183 --> 00:50:52,947
Christa, how is this constructive?

666
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:58,588
The last thing I wanted was to lose Christa,

667
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:01,389
so I decided to get professional help.

668
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:06,865
My mother had like
a phobia about changing my diapers.

669
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:12,872
So she had like this aversion
to, you know, diapers.

670
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,204
Any recent dreams you can remember?

671
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:18,210
Um...

672
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:23,614
I had this dream
where I was sitting on the toilet,

673
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:26,812
and then I was getting
smaller and smaller,

674
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:28,650
and then I fell in.

675
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:34,255
I need you, Mommy!

676
00:51:34,327 --> 00:51:36,818
- Louder.
- I need you, Mommy!

677
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:39,195
- Harder.
- I need you, Mommy!

678
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,166
- That's it.
- I need you, Mommy!

679
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:43,529
- That's it.
- I need you, Mommy!

680
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:46,766
- Louder!
- I need you, Mommy!

681
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,172
<i>But none of it seemed to help.</i>

682
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:54,071
<i>Finally, after weeks</i>
<i>of struggling to resist,</i>

683
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:57,275
<i>I decided to do what I had been</i>
<i>struggling for weeks not to do,</i>

684
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,875
<i>even if it meant losing Christa.</i>

685
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:10,493
Take off clothes.

686
00:52:11,565 --> 00:52:12,930
Suck me.

687
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,990
You give me money?

688
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:16,296
Oh, yeah.

689
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,764
Um, twenty now,

690
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,570
and twenty later
if you do everything I say.

691
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:27,746
No, standing up.

692
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:34,313
Yeah.

693
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:39,521
Yeah.

694
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:41,891
Oh, wait.
First say, "I wanna suck your dick."

695
00:52:41,962 --> 00:52:45,762
No, wait.
First say, "I wanna suck your dick."

696
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:50,198
No understand very good English.

697
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:56,770
Say, "I want to suck your dick."

698
00:52:58,612 --> 00:53:00,375
No understand.

699
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:04,180
Say "I"...

700
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:08,381
No, wait. Say "I"..."I"...

701
00:53:08,455 --> 00:53:12,084
Say "I."
"I"..."I"...

702
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,820
"I." Say "I."

703
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:16,895
"I." Say "I."

704
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:22,868
<i>The fact that she had no idea what I was</i>
<i>saying took a lot of the thrill out of it.</i>

705
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:26,099
Okay, fine, just suck it.

706
00:53:31,645 --> 00:53:34,307
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

707
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:38,374
Suck it. Yeah, suck it, you bitch.

708
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:41,249
Yeah, suck it, slut.

709
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:42,652
Yeah.

710
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:49,328
Oh, yeah, you love it, don't you?
You little slut.

711
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:55,425
Hold on, hold on.

712
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:56,526
Um...

713
00:53:56,603 --> 00:53:58,366
Stand over here.

714
00:53:58,438 --> 00:54:01,373
Get over here. Yeah.

715
00:54:20,227 --> 00:54:24,288
<i>Afterwards, the most</i>
<i>amazing thing happened.</i>

716
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:27,527
<i>She patted me affectionately</i>
<i>on the butt and said...</i>

717
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:28,966
Come again.

718
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:38,574
<i>I had gone there to express that pat</i>
<i>of myself which I was most ashamed of,</i>

719
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:43,139
<i>and yet she had smiled at me afterwards</i>
<i>with acceptance and compassion.</i>

720
00:54:43,216 --> 00:54:46,549
<i>I felt that I had just had</i>
<i>a mystical experience</i>

721
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,282
<i>and that something inside me</i>
<i>had finally changed.</i>

722
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,621
<i>That night I went over to Christa's</i>

723
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:56,457
<i>to tell her that I was ready to be</i>
<i>in a committed relationship.</i>

724
00:54:56,997 --> 00:54:59,830
- What do you want?
- I want to get back together.

725
00:55:02,435 --> 00:55:05,302
<i>Christa was understandably skeptical</i>
<i>about my transformation...</i>

726
00:55:10,377 --> 00:55:14,837
<i>... but I eventually managed</i>
<i>to convince her that I was finally cured.</i>

727
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,515
Now at this point in the film,

728
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:23,283
there's supposed to be a scene
in which Christa is giving me a blow job.

729
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:25,722
Not a real blow job, a fake blow job.

730
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:30,229
But the actress playing Christa
has refused to do the scene.

731
00:55:31,197 --> 00:55:36,362
Do you feel like it's domineering
or something to women?

732
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:42,306
No, it's just something that I'm
not comfortable with doing on screen.

733
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,967
Could you please do it anyway?

734
00:55:44,044 --> 00:55:45,204
No.

735
00:55:45,278 --> 00:55:48,805
So if you could just imagine
that she's giving me a blow job,

736
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:51,851
and if you could also imagine
the following voice-over...

737
00:55:53,653 --> 00:55:56,850
<i>And sex suddenly became very different.</i>

738
00:55:56,923 --> 00:55:59,892
<i>Instead of fantasizing</i>
<i>that Christa was a stranger,</i>

739
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,987
<i>I tried to just be present</i>
<i>to what was happening.</i>

740
00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:06,123
<i>And it was overwhelming.</i>

741
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:09,032
<i>I felt almost too loved.</i>

742
00:56:09,102 --> 00:56:13,095
<i>I couldn't believe that another</i>
<i>human being could love me enough</i>

743
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:15,334
<i>to actually want to take my penis,</i>

744
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:18,536
<i>which I had always</i>
<i>considered ugly and dirty,</i>

745
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:20,340
<i>into her mouth,</i>

746
00:56:20,413 --> 00:56:23,177
<i>or would be willing</i>
<i>to swallow my semen.</i>

747
00:56:29,956 --> 00:56:31,583
- Hey, sweetie.
Hi.

748
00:56:31,658 --> 00:56:35,116
I missed you.
How's it going?

749
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:36,719
All right.

750
00:56:36,796 --> 00:56:38,286
Why, what's the matter?

751
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:44,562
There's something I have to tell you.

752
00:56:45,338 --> 00:56:46,498
What?

753
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:52,402
Remember I told you I was going
to see a movie with Robby tonight?

754
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,810
Yeah.

755
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:57,846
Well...

756
00:56:59,853 --> 00:57:01,480
Afterwards...

757
00:57:03,823 --> 00:57:07,350
I couldn't help myself,
and we started making out.

758
00:57:07,894 --> 00:57:10,454
What do you mean
you couldn't help yourself?

759
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,829
I don't know. It just happened.
I wasn't planning it or anything.

760
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:17,660
What do you mean by "making out"?

761
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:20,899
We just like kissed and stuff.

762
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:24,299
What do you mean "and stuff"?

763
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:28,337
We just fooled around a little.

764
00:57:31,117 --> 00:57:32,675
And then what happened?

765
00:57:34,154 --> 00:57:36,952
I'm supposed to see him
tomorrow night for dinner.

766
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,823
But I'm going to tell him I made a mistake
and I can't keep seeing him in that way.

767
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:45,128
Caveh, I'm sorry.

768
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:55,998
<i>I felt incredibly jealous, but I tried</i>
<i>my best to transcend my feelings.</i>

769
00:57:58,078 --> 00:58:01,570
I can't do this.
I feel like I'm kissing Robby.

770
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:04,344
I feel I can taste
his saliva in your mouth.

771
00:58:05,518 --> 00:58:08,681
Well, how do you think I feel
when you have sex with a prostitute?

772
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:14,252
I could see her point,

773
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:17,728
and I knew that I had no right to be jealous
after everything that I had put her through.

774
00:58:17,797 --> 00:58:20,322
But I just couldn't help myself.

775
00:58:21,901 --> 00:58:24,096
That night, I called Robby
at 3:00 in the morning

776
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:28,163
and I asked him as a personal favor to me
to please stop making out with Christa.

777
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:30,436
And he agreed.

778
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,206
Thanks, Robby.
I really appreciate it.

779
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,409
<i>But he lied.</i>
<i>They made out again the next night.</i>

780
00:58:37,484 --> 00:58:41,011
- You promised you wouldn't.
- I know. I'm sorry.

781
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:43,180
What were you thinking, Christa?

782
00:58:43,256 --> 00:58:45,986
I don't know.
I just couldn't help myself.

783
00:58:47,594 --> 00:58:50,188
<i>She was starting to sound like me.</i>

784
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:53,096
<i>Christa continued</i>
<i>to spend time with Robby,</i>

785
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,157
<i>and I just got more and more jealous,</i>

786
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:57,032
<i>more and more needy,</i>

787
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:59,128
<i>and more and more insecure.</i>

788
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:03,398
<i>So we started going to couples therapy.</i>

789
00:59:03,476 --> 00:59:06,741
So, Caveh,
what are you thinking right now?

790
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:16,188
I was thinking that I'm attracted to you.

791
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:23,928
<i>Meanwhile, our fighting</i>
<i>started to escalate out of control.</i>

792
00:59:26,866 --> 00:59:31,963
<i>And before I knew it, my desire to have sex</i>
<i>with a prostitute had returned.</i>

793
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:40,473
- How much?
- What do you want?

794
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:43,710
- How much for a blow job?
- 50 bucks.

795
00:59:43,783 --> 00:59:45,444
Let me think about it.

796
00:59:53,092 --> 00:59:57,324
<i>After that night,</i>
<i>I started cruising regularly,</i>

797
00:59:57,397 --> 00:59:59,228
<i>sometimes until dawn.</i>

798
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:03,669
And then I met Devin.

799
01:00:03,736 --> 01:00:05,704
Austin, Texas

800
01:00:05,772 --> 01:00:07,205
Fuck.

801
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:09,969
<i>I had been invited</i>
<i>by the Austin Film Society</i>

802
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:12,443
<i>to show a film that</i>
<i>Greg and I had co-directed.</i>

803
01:00:13,746 --> 01:00:15,714
<i>Devin was one of the organizers.</i>

804
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:16,771
Hey.

805
01:00:18,051 --> 01:00:21,350
<i>That night we ended up</i>
<i>getting stoned together,</i>

806
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:24,447
<i>and I found myself suddenly</i>
<i>feeling very attracted to her.</i>

807
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:35,991
<i>And then on my last day in Austin,</i>
<i>we decided to take mushrooms together.</i>

808
01:00:57,924 --> 01:01:01,826
<i>Tripping with Devin was one of the most</i>
<i>mystical experiences of my life.</i>

809
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:06,864
<i>I felt like we</i>
<i>understood each other in a way</i>

810
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:09,060
<i>that I had never thought possible</i>
<i>between two people.</i>

811
01:01:24,484 --> 01:01:29,148
<i>After we came down, I told her the whole</i>
<i>story of my relationship with Christa.</i>

812
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:32,089
You know, I bet she's
probably fucking Robby right now.

813
01:01:32,158 --> 01:01:34,922
- Caveh, you're crazy.
- Why am I crazy?

814
01:01:34,994 --> 01:01:39,055
Because you should be happy for her.
You should hope she's having a good fuck.

815
01:01:39,899 --> 01:01:42,629
You know, you're right. I should.

816
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:45,068
You know, I don't even
believe in monogamy.

817
01:01:45,138 --> 01:01:47,936
Fuck, man, neither do I.

818
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:52,267
<i>It seemed to me that I had</i>
<i>finally found the soul mate</i>

819
01:01:52,345 --> 01:01:54,609
<i>that I had been searching for all my life.</i>

820
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:56,774
Ow! What are you doing?

821
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:59,579
You see, there's this person here,
his name is Caveh.

822
01:01:59,652 --> 01:02:02,120
He's real. He exists.

823
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:05,957
- You mean me?
- Yeah, I mean you.

824
01:02:06,025 --> 01:02:11,156
Look, as noble as it is to try to sacrifice
yourself and your needs for her,

825
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,529
you have to be true to yourself
because you're real, too.

826
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:18,094
But the problem is I can't stand to hurt her.

827
01:02:18,671 --> 01:02:22,437
You're hurting her more by prolonging
a relationship that isn't working

828
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:24,635
than by ending it right now.

829
01:02:24,711 --> 01:02:27,544
Yeah, but I'm also scared.

830
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:32,073
I'm afraid of being lonely and horny

831
01:02:32,151 --> 01:02:35,917
and desperate and always on the prowl.

832
01:02:35,988 --> 01:02:37,250
I hate that.

833
01:02:37,824 --> 01:02:41,123
Those don't sound like very good
reasons for staying together.

834
01:02:41,194 --> 01:02:43,424
You're right.

835
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:49,191
I agreed with everything she said,

836
01:02:49,268 --> 01:02:52,465
but I wondered whether Devin would
be able to accept my prostitute fetish

837
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:54,335
any better than Christa.

838
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:59,000
But Christa's really been trying.
I mean, I'm fucked up, too.

839
01:02:59,078 --> 01:03:04,243
Like, for example,
I have this prostitute fetish.

840
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:09,118
Big fucking deal.
Everybody's got stuff like that.

841
01:03:09,188 --> 01:03:11,156
<i>When Devin said those words,</i>

842
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:16,287
<i>it suddenly struck me that it wasn't</i>
<i>my prostitute fetish that was the problem.</i>

843
01:03:16,362 --> 01:03:18,523
<i>It was Christa that was the problem.</i>

844
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:34,842
<i>On the way back to L.A.,</i>

845
01:03:34,914 --> 01:03:37,849
<i>I made up my mind</i>
<i>to break up with Christa.</i>

846
01:03:39,852 --> 01:03:42,878
<i>We had been together for 3 years.</i>

847
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,456
<i>This is the real Christa.</i>

848
01:03:46,526 --> 01:03:50,462
<i>For the first few years after our break-up</i>
<i>we weren't on the best of terms.</i>

849
01:03:51,264 --> 01:03:53,858
<i>But now things are better between us.</i>

850
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:57,334
<i>She's since gotten married</i>
<i>and recently had a baby.</i>

851
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:08,510
<i>After the break-up,</i>
<i>I couldn't stop thinking about Devin.</i>

852
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:13,452
<i>For the next month,</i>
<i>I wrote to her every day.</i>

853
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:18,680
<i>And when I received an invitation</i>
<i>from two European film festivals,</i>

854
01:04:18,758 --> 01:04:20,885
<i>I invited Devin to come along.</i>

855
01:04:26,132 --> 01:04:29,329
<i>Our first few days together were idyllic.</i>

856
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:34,403
<i>But then things got more complicated.</i>

857
01:04:42,815 --> 01:04:44,442
I think she likes you.

858
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:47,111
You think?
Definitely.

859
01:04:47,186 --> 01:04:50,747
I don't know. She's not really my type.
Not slutty enough.

860
01:04:50,823 --> 01:04:52,222
Yeah, right.

861
01:04:58,397 --> 01:05:03,494
You know, if you want to see prostitutes
while we're in Europe, feel free.

862
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:06,436
You can just go,
"Hey, Devin, catch you later,"

863
01:05:06,506 --> 01:05:08,565
and go and do your thing.

864
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:13,438
You know, I was thinking
about what you said earlier,

865
01:05:13,513 --> 01:05:19,474
and I just wanted to say that I really do
want to get over my prostitute fetish.

866
01:05:19,552 --> 01:05:21,076
You know, I do.

867
01:05:21,153 --> 01:05:23,519
But it did occur to me

868
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:26,922
that maybe if I could get you to watch
while I had sex with one,

869
01:05:26,993 --> 01:05:28,824
that might be really healing for me.

870
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:41,065
Caveh, that would be so intense for me.

871
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,437
Really?

872
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:46,301
Yeah, it would

873
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:50,475
It's just that like a lot of it
has to do with shame,

874
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,815
and I think that if you were watching,

875
01:05:53,886 --> 01:05:56,684
then it would be something
that we were doing together.

876
01:05:56,756 --> 01:06:01,750
And then I think that might help me
to not feel so much shame about it,

877
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:06,958
and then hopefully like I wouldn't feel
the need to do it as much.

878
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:09,160
The next day we rented a car

879
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:12,602
and drove to Milan to see
Leonardo da Vinci's <i>The Last Supper.</i>

880
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:15,971
Hey, a prostitute!

881
01:06:17,777 --> 01:06:19,972
Do you want to stop
and check her out?

882
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:21,877
I don't know.

883
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,618
Well, if you don't mind.

884
01:06:26,686 --> 01:06:28,881
Nah, go for it.

885
01:06:54,914 --> 01:06:56,882
So what do you think?

886
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,541
Do you wanna watch?

887
01:06:59,151 --> 01:07:02,609
If it's really important to you, I will.

888
01:07:03,956 --> 01:07:05,719
Thanks, Devin.

889
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:07,588
I really appreciate it.

890
01:07:21,907 --> 01:07:23,966
She doesn't want you to watch.

891
01:07:24,043 --> 01:07:26,068
So what do you want to do?

892
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:29,244
I don't know.

893
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:34,719
Let's just go.

894
01:07:34,787 --> 01:07:35,981
Okay.

895
01:07:56,242 --> 01:07:59,905
<i>On our last day in Italy,</i>
<i>I saw the girl from the boardwalk again.</i>

896
01:08:08,554 --> 01:08:12,923
<i>Her name was Paola, and it turned out</i>
<i>that she was an aspiring actress.</i>

897
01:08:13,926 --> 01:08:17,327
<i>She had seen my movie and liked it.</i>

898
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,626
Hey.

899
01:08:22,802 --> 01:08:24,702
Hey.

900
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:27,898
- How'd it go?
- Great. She gave me her shoes.

901
01:08:27,973 --> 01:08:29,133
No way. Cool.

902
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,176
Yeah, she saw my movie. We kissed.

903
01:08:31,243 --> 01:08:33,507
You kissed? Lucky you.

904
01:08:33,579 --> 01:08:35,979
It was an okay kiss.
Not like yours.

905
01:08:36,048 --> 01:08:37,413
Ohh.

906
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:41,013
Mm. Did you even notice
how I kept on riding

907
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,078
when you decided to go
and check her out?

908
01:08:43,155 --> 01:08:44,622
No, I guess I didn't.

909
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:46,658
Yeah. I just wanted to point it out

910
01:08:46,726 --> 01:08:48,717
'cause I don't think most girlfriends
would have done that,

911
01:08:48,794 --> 01:08:50,955
just take off and let you do your thing.

912
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,123
Yeah, I guess you're right.

913
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:57,898
I'd just like a little appreciation,
'cause most girlfriends wouldn't stand for it,

914
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,961
let alone make it easier for you.

915
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:01,529
Yeah, that's true.
Thanks, Devin.

916
01:09:01,607 --> 01:09:04,405
- Yeah, right.
- No, I really appreciate it.

917
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:06,104
Yeah.

918
01:09:06,178 --> 01:09:08,408
- But just do me one favor, okay?
- What?

919
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:09,880
- Just one.
- Okay.

920
01:09:09,949 --> 01:09:12,509
Just don't fuck her in our bed, okay?

921
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,212
Okay.

922
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:18,518
<i>I was surprised that she would care,</i>

923
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:21,856
<i>but I chose to be touched</i>
<i>rather than alarmed.</i>

924
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:28,160
<i>Paola had invited me to have a drink</i>
<i>with her and her friends that night.</i>

925
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:31,669
<i>I had asked Devin</i>
<i>if she wanted to come along,</i>

926
01:09:31,737 --> 01:09:34,001
<i>secretly hoping she would decline.</i>

927
01:09:35,207 --> 01:09:36,936
<i>But she didn't decline.</i>

928
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,610
<i>I couldn't decide where to sit,</i>

929
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:45,139
<i>I wanted to sit next to Paola,</i>
<i>but I felt I should sit next to Devin.</i>

930
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:49,483
<i>I decided to compromise</i>
<i>by sitting next to neither,</i>

931
01:09:49,555 --> 01:09:51,955
<i>thereby remaining equidistant from both,</i>

932
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:55,187
<i>like Christ in da Vinci's</i>
The Last Supper.

933
01:10:08,007 --> 01:10:11,170
I'm going to head back to the hotel.
I'll see you later.

934
01:10:11,243 --> 01:10:13,006
Don't you want to go swimming?

935
01:10:13,078 --> 01:10:16,605
No. Why don't you go
with your Italian friend?

936
01:10:17,616 --> 01:10:20,107
I'd rather go with you.

937
01:10:20,186 --> 01:10:23,349
Nah, go with her.
See ya.

938
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,334
Are you sure
you don't want to swim naked?

939
01:10:42,408 --> 01:10:44,103
Yes, I'm sure.

940
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:46,436
No, it'll be fun.

941
01:10:46,512 --> 01:10:48,639
- No.
- Really.

942
01:10:55,321 --> 01:10:57,050
Are you sure you don't want
to sleep together?

943
01:10:57,122 --> 01:11:00,649
Yes, I'm sure.
But maybe when you come to Torino.

944
01:11:00,726 --> 01:11:02,353
Great, I'll probably be old by then.

945
01:11:02,428 --> 01:11:04,259
I'll write to you.

946
01:11:05,531 --> 01:11:07,158
Okay.

947
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:11,499
And if ever you need someone
to act in one of your movies,

948
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,197
just give me a call.

949
01:11:13,272 --> 01:11:15,604
<i>That was the line</i>
<i>that made me hate myself.</i>

950
01:11:15,674 --> 01:11:16,971
Okay.

951
01:11:17,042 --> 01:11:19,943
<i>I felt like a sleazy</i>
<i>Hollywood film director.</i>

952
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:29,845
<i>On the way home, I had</i>
<i>a nightmarish vision of my future.</i>

953
01:11:29,922 --> 01:11:34,859
<i>I saw myself 20 years later,</i>
<i>aging and still alone.</i>

954
01:11:37,696 --> 01:11:42,531
<i>By the time I got back to the hotel,</i>
<i>I was feeling empty and depressed.</i>

955
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:48,197
<i>All I wanted was to get into bed</i>
<i>and snuggle up next to Devin.</i>

956
01:11:59,852 --> 01:12:01,251
Devin!

957
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:06,219
Devin!

958
01:12:17,703 --> 01:12:20,536
- So did you fuck her?
- No, I didn't.

959
01:12:20,606 --> 01:12:22,836
Why not? She wanted you.

960
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:24,842
Not enough, apparently.

961
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:28,540
Well, I almost fucked somebody.

962
01:12:28,614 --> 01:12:30,445
Who?

963
01:12:30,516 --> 01:12:32,643
Some dude that I met in a bar.

964
01:12:32,718 --> 01:12:34,583
Here.

965
01:12:34,653 --> 01:12:35,984
Sorry.

966
01:12:37,423 --> 01:12:39,550
<i>I felt jealous and insecure,</i>

967
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:42,059
<i>but I wanted to believe</i>
<i>that Devin and I were engaged</i>

968
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:45,324
<i>in a high-minded experiment</i>
<i>in self-transcendence.</i>

969
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:50,697
<i>The next day we flew to Munich.</i>

970
01:12:52,838 --> 01:12:55,432
Fuck, I've got such a fucking hangover.

971
01:12:56,508 --> 01:13:00,205
Excuse me, miss,
can I have a scotch, please?

972
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:02,042
One scotch?
- Yeah.

973
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:08,443
- I thought you had a hangover.
- I do. That's why I need a drink.

974
01:13:09,154 --> 01:13:10,746
Is that a good idea?

975
01:13:10,823 --> 01:13:13,553
It's the only way.

976
01:13:15,394 --> 01:13:18,227
It's true.
I know what I'm doing.

977
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:21,393
Okay.

978
01:13:22,768 --> 01:13:25,703
But this is my last drink.
I promise.

979
01:13:33,912 --> 01:13:35,379
You promised you weren't
going to drink anymore.

980
01:13:35,447 --> 01:13:39,440
Well, the guy kept buying me beers.
I couldn't really turn him down.

981
01:13:39,518 --> 01:13:42,453
- Why not?
- Free beers, man.

982
01:13:42,521 --> 01:13:46,958
<i>It was starting to dawn on me</i>
<i>that Devin had a drinking problem.</i>

983
01:13:47,026 --> 01:13:48,516
Now, I should probably explain

984
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:52,690
that the actress playing Devin
had a drinking problem in real life.

985
01:14:05,144 --> 01:14:07,908
The cause of and answer to
all of life's problems.

986
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,210
<i>But getting back to the story...</i>

987
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:15,184
Devin, stop it. You said that was
going to be your last one.

988
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:19,352
Why don't you go fuck a prostitute
and leave me alone?

989
01:14:20,492 --> 01:14:24,929
Devin, what are you talking about?
You said you were going to stop drinking!

990
01:14:25,664 --> 01:14:27,529
I guess I changed my mind.

991
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:31,631
Devin, I think you've had enough.

992
01:14:32,538 --> 01:14:35,200
Well, that's funny, Caveh,
because I don't think I have.

993
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:41,969
Fuck!

994
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,607
You fucking prick!
That shit's expensive!

995
01:14:52,491 --> 01:14:54,482
<i>I was starting to miss Christa.</i>

996
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:02,225
<i>That night, I spoke</i>
<i>to every prostitute in Munich.</i>

997
01:15:02,301 --> 01:15:03,290
Um...

998
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:08,033
<i>Blasen?</i>

999
01:15:08,107 --> 01:15:11,042
<i>- Blasen?</i>
<i>- Blasen. Ja. Blasen.</i>

1000
01:15:16,381 --> 01:15:20,841
<i>After conversing with the street prostitutes,</i>
<i>I made the rounds of the brothels.</i>

1001
01:15:44,009 --> 01:15:47,536
<i>There was one prostitute</i>
<i>I found especially tempting.</i>

1002
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,788
<i>I was dying to have sex with her,</i>

1003
01:15:57,856 --> 01:16:00,222
<i>but I managed to resist.</i>

1004
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,494
<i>And I returned to the hotel</i>

1005
01:16:03,562 --> 01:16:07,692
<i>excited to tell Devin</i>
<i>that I had successfully resisted.</i>

1006
01:16:12,538 --> 01:16:15,939
<i>The next day the film festival organizers</i>

1007
01:16:16,008 --> 01:16:19,944
<i>insisted that we pay a $300 fine</i>
<i>for damages to the room</i>

1008
01:16:20,012 --> 01:16:22,879
<i>and that we leave town</i>
<i>immediately after my screening.</i>

1009
01:16:26,084 --> 01:16:32,023
I am not having another drink
for a long time, I can tell you that.

1010
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:35,783
Well, good. I'm glad.

1011
01:16:40,866 --> 01:16:44,302
<i>Devin had a bad hangover</i>
<i>and slept all afternoon.</i>

1012
01:16:45,437 --> 01:16:49,237
<i>It was our last day in Munich,</i>
<i>so I decided to go sightseeing.</i>

1013
01:17:02,254 --> 01:17:03,778
Cheers.

1014
01:17:05,057 --> 01:17:06,922
Fuck you, Devin.

1015
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:19,037
Where are you going?

1016
01:17:19,705 --> 01:17:21,570
I'm gonna get a blow job.

1017
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,131
Okay, I'll come with you.

1018
01:17:26,011 --> 01:17:27,569
I don't want you to.

1019
01:17:27,646 --> 01:17:30,274
Why not? I thought
you wanted me to watch.

1020
01:17:30,349 --> 01:17:34,376
Didn't you say you wanted your girlfriends
to watch so you could feel "accepted"?

1021
01:17:34,453 --> 01:17:36,648
Well, I'm mad at you right now.

1022
01:17:36,722 --> 01:17:40,180
Well, hey, pal, it's your big chance.

1023
01:18:17,095 --> 01:18:19,529
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

1024
01:18:20,198 --> 01:18:21,187
Um, hi.

1025
01:18:21,266 --> 01:18:23,826
Um, I'm looking for a woman
who was here last night.

1026
01:18:23,902 --> 01:18:25,665
She had black hair.
Is she here?

1027
01:18:25,737 --> 01:18:30,436
She's going to be busy for another hour.
Maybe I can help you.

1028
01:18:30,509 --> 01:18:32,136
Um...

1029
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:34,178
I was really hoping to see her.

1030
01:18:34,246 --> 01:18:35,679
I am very good.

1031
01:18:35,747 --> 01:18:40,047
I'm sure that's true,
but I need to think about it.

1032
01:18:40,118 --> 01:18:41,415
Okay.

1033
01:18:45,557 --> 01:18:47,855
I don't see the one I came for.

1034
01:18:47,926 --> 01:18:51,453
So why don't you get your dick sucked
by one of these?

1035
01:18:52,464 --> 01:18:55,160
Because I liked the other one better.

1036
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:57,292
- Well, if she's not here...
- She is here.

1037
01:18:57,369 --> 01:19:00,566
She says she's with a customer.
She'll be done in an hour.

1038
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:04,575
An hour?
We're going to wait an hour?

1039
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:09,479
I need another drink.

1040
01:19:09,548 --> 01:19:13,075
Devin, we can't afford another drink.

1041
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,619
What do you mean
we can't afford another drink?

1042
01:19:15,687 --> 01:19:19,179
You bring your girlfriend to a brothel
and you won't even buy her a drink?

1043
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:22,590
Devin, we only have 200 marks left.
It's just enough for me to get a blow job.

1044
01:19:22,661 --> 01:19:24,652
It's not enough for a drink and a blow job.

1045
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:27,221
Man, fuck you, Caveh.
I want a drink.

1046
01:19:27,299 --> 01:19:29,733
Devin, you haven't even finished
what's in your glass.

1047
01:19:33,271 --> 01:19:34,863
There, it's finished.

1048
01:19:45,217 --> 01:19:46,377
Here.

1049
01:19:47,519 --> 01:19:49,111
Thank you.

1050
01:19:49,187 --> 01:19:53,180
Excuse me. The woman
you wanted is available now.

1051
01:19:53,258 --> 01:19:54,589
Follow me.

1052
01:20:02,934 --> 01:20:07,098
I'm sorry, I was looking
for a different woman with black hair.

1053
01:20:07,172 --> 01:20:10,903
- She was here last night.
- She's not here tonight.

1054
01:20:14,913 --> 01:20:17,882
- That wasn't her.
- What do you mean?

1055
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:19,849
The one I wanted isn't here tonight.

1056
01:20:19,918 --> 01:20:22,910
We waited a fucking hour
and she's not here?

1057
01:20:24,423 --> 01:20:25,651
Yeah.

1058
01:20:26,825 --> 01:20:29,259
So what do you want to do?
Do you want to go?

1059
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:33,357
I'm not sure.

1060
01:20:34,232 --> 01:20:35,722
I can't decide.

1061
01:20:36,501 --> 01:20:38,901
Well, why don't you
fuck one of those?

1062
01:20:39,771 --> 01:20:42,001
I don't know.
I really wanted that one.

1063
01:20:42,073 --> 01:20:44,871
You know, I'm not that attracted
to any of the other ones.

1064
01:20:45,544 --> 01:20:48,843
We came all the way here.
You might as well do it.

1065
01:20:54,453 --> 01:20:57,547
So, you want to go upstairs with me?

1066
01:20:57,622 --> 01:21:00,716
Um, maybe. I'm not sure.

1067
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:03,454
I can give you very much pleasure.

1068
01:21:03,528 --> 01:21:05,655
I'm sure that's true.

1069
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:12,427
So, are you ready?

1070
01:21:12,504 --> 01:21:15,496
Um, I don't know.
I can't decide.

1071
01:21:15,574 --> 01:21:17,371
Maybe I can help you decide.

1072
01:21:17,442 --> 01:21:18,602
Um...

1073
01:21:18,677 --> 01:21:21,908
- What do you think?
- Well, it's certainly very tempting.

1074
01:21:24,216 --> 01:21:25,444
Where are you going?

1075
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:28,645
Don't worry about her.
She'll be fine.

1076
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,178
- Where are they going?
- She won't hurt her.

1077
01:21:33,191 --> 01:21:36,024
Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

1078
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:55,208
Fuck you, Caveh!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1079
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,805
- Devin, calm down.
- Fuck you!

1080
01:21:57,883 --> 01:21:59,111
What did she say to you?

1081
01:21:59,184 --> 01:22:02,381
She was actually concerned
about me, unlike you!

1082
01:22:02,454 --> 01:22:05,184
She said, "Come with me,
and I'll take care of you

1083
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:07,248
and I'll make you feel better."

1084
01:22:08,426 --> 01:22:10,155
Did she mean sexually?

1085
01:22:10,228 --> 01:22:13,686
It's all you can think about, isn't it?

1086
01:22:13,765 --> 01:22:15,392
Well, is that what she meant?

1087
01:22:15,467 --> 01:22:17,025
I'm getting out!

1088
01:22:17,102 --> 01:22:19,866
Devin, no, wait!
Stop it! Close it!

1089
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,681
<i>When we got back to the hotel,</i>
<i>Devin insisted on giving me a blow job.</i>

1090
01:22:33,752 --> 01:22:38,189
<i>I told her I didn't want one,</i>
<i>but she held me down and forced me.</i>

1091
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:42,952
<i>I was scared the whole time that</i>
<i>she was going to bite my penis off.</i>

1092
01:22:46,698 --> 01:22:49,599
<i>The next morning we flew to New York.</i>

1093
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:02,273
How much?

1094
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,693
Let me pull it out for you.

1095
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,462
Get down on your knees.

1096
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:30,565
I'm not getting down on my fucking knees.
There's broken glass.

1097
01:23:30,642 --> 01:23:32,303
Oh. Sorry.

1098
01:23:49,394 --> 01:23:53,091
<i>The next day</i>
<i>we went our separate ways.</i>

1099
01:23:54,833 --> 01:23:58,599
<i>I wanted to say "I love you,"</i>
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

1100
01:23:59,638 --> 01:24:04,940
<i>But as I headed towards the gate,</i>
<i>I felt able to say it and wanted to.</i>

1101
01:24:06,544 --> 01:24:08,478
<i>But it was too late.</i>

1102
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:14,109
<i>This is the real Devin.</i>

1103
01:24:14,185 --> 01:24:16,710
<i>We remained friends over the years,</i>

1104
01:24:16,788 --> 01:24:21,623
<i>and she later appeared in a film I made</i>
<i>called</i> I Don't Hate Las Vegas Anymore.

1105
01:24:21,693 --> 01:24:25,151
<i>By then she had already</i>
<i>been diagnosed with cancer</i>

1106
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:29,030
<i>and had just undergone chemotherapy.</i>

1107
01:24:30,035 --> 01:24:32,230
<i>She died three years later.</i>

1108
01:24:41,746 --> 01:24:45,978
<i>On the way home,</i>
<i>I felt an overwhelming sense of loss.</i>

1109
01:24:47,118 --> 01:24:48,881
<i>Ever since I had met Devin,</i>

1110
01:24:48,953 --> 01:24:51,444
<i>I had believed that I had</i>
<i>finally found the one person</i>

1111
01:24:51,523 --> 01:24:53,457
<i>who could accept me the way I was.</i>

1112
01:24:55,994 --> 01:24:59,395
<i>But now I realized that I had been wrong.</i>

1113
01:25:01,433 --> 01:25:05,767
<i>I had once read somewhere that</i>
<i>everyone who comes into our lives</i>

1114
01:25:05,837 --> 01:25:09,705
<i>is a mirror for something inside us</i>
<i>that we're not seeing.</i>

1115
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:11,571
<i>So I asked myself</i>

1116
01:25:11,643 --> 01:25:16,546
<i>how Devin might be a mirror for something</i>
<i>inside me that I wasn't seeing.</i>

1117
01:25:17,082 --> 01:25:19,812
<i>At first I couldn't see it.</i>

1118
01:25:19,884 --> 01:25:24,014
<i>Devin was an alcoholic,</i>
<i>I wasn't an alcoholic.</i>

1119
01:25:24,923 --> 01:25:29,292
<i>But then it suddenly occurred to me</i>
<i>that even though I wasn't an alcoholic,</i>

1120
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:33,319
<i>I was kind of like an alcoholic about sex.</i>

1121
01:25:41,339 --> 01:25:42,863
- Caveh?
- Yeah, hi.

1122
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:44,306
Hi.

1123
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:47,606
<i>Back in L.A. I went to see a therapist</i>

1124
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,171
<i>who suggested I attend</i>
<i>a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting.</i>

1125
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:36,285
<i>I scanned the faces of the other men</i>
<i>in the room for signs of perversion,</i>

1126
01:26:36,361 --> 01:26:38,454
<i>but they looked just like anybody else.</i>

1127
01:26:42,233 --> 01:26:44,428
Good evening, my name is Ken.

1128
01:26:44,502 --> 01:26:46,732
I'm a recovering sex addict.

1129
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:48,466
Hi, Ken.

1130
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:53,307
Welcome to the Monday night male-only
meeting of Sex Addicts Anonymous.

1131
01:26:53,378 --> 01:26:55,346
This is a closed meeting.

1132
01:26:55,413 --> 01:26:59,076
Only those desiring
their own sexual abstinence, please.

1133
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:00,981
In S.A.A., we define abstinence

1134
01:27:01,052 --> 01:27:04,510
not as the complete elimination
of all sexuality from the addict's life,

1135
01:27:04,589 --> 01:27:07,456
but only of those
compulsive sexual behaviors

1136
01:27:07,525 --> 01:27:11,291
that lead to pitiful
and incomprehensible demoralization.

1137
01:27:11,362 --> 01:27:12,920
We leave it up to the individual to decide

1138
01:27:12,997 --> 01:27:16,057
which compulsive behaviors
he wishes to abstain from.

1139
01:27:16,134 --> 01:27:17,931
I said that I'm a sex addict.

1140
01:27:18,002 --> 01:27:20,732
Are there any other sex addicts present?

1141
01:27:24,642 --> 01:27:27,634
Hi, everybody. My name's Sasha
and I'm a sex addict.

1142
01:27:27,712 --> 01:27:28,974
Hi, Sasha.

1143
01:27:29,047 --> 01:27:32,983
Last week I finally took all my porn
and I just put it in a garbage bag

1144
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:36,646
and I just hauled it out
'cause I was just so sick of it.

1145
01:27:36,721 --> 01:27:39,315
And I think of all the hundreds
and thousands of hours

1146
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:42,917
I'm wasting in my car cruising...

1147
01:27:42,994 --> 01:27:44,552
...staying in sex clubs all night

1148
01:27:44,629 --> 01:27:48,030
when there's absolutely nobody
that I want to have sex with at all.

1149
01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:52,832
And it really started to affect
my work, my marriage...

1150
01:27:52,904 --> 01:27:54,633
<i>Everyone had a different addiction.</i>

1151
01:27:54,706 --> 01:27:57,470
<i>Ken was into gay bath houses.</i>

1152
01:27:57,542 --> 01:28:00,909
<i>Ron was a compulsive masturbator.</i>

1153
01:28:00,979 --> 01:28:03,846
<i>And Tom was a voyeur.</i>

1154
01:28:03,915 --> 01:28:06,543
<i>But their stories</i>
<i>all had one thing in common...</i>

1155
01:28:06,618 --> 01:28:09,348
<i>that the more they had</i>
<i>indulged their addictions,</i>

1156
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:12,116
<i>the stronger their addictions had become.</i>

1157
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:15,318
I'm in my hallway and I'm bleeding,

1158
01:28:15,393 --> 01:28:19,489
and I just realized that that's it,
I'm at fucking rock bottom.

1159
01:28:19,564 --> 01:28:24,968
And I really need some support tonight,
'cause it's been a really hard week.

1160
01:28:30,241 --> 01:28:33,938
It's 9:15. This is the time
we usually set aside for newcomers.

1161
01:28:34,012 --> 01:28:36,879
Would any of the newcomers like to share?

1162
01:28:41,452 --> 01:28:42,817
Yes.

1163
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:56,166
<i>As you can see, I'm not</i>
<i>very good at crying on camera.</i>

1164
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:58,930
But I did actually break down and cry

1165
01:28:59,003 --> 01:29:01,767
at that first Sex Addicts Anonymous
meeting that I went to,

1166
01:29:01,839 --> 01:29:05,036
and I actually happened
to tape record the meeting.

1167
01:29:05,109 --> 01:29:09,569
And this is actually the tape
that I made at that first meeting.

1168
01:29:10,548 --> 01:29:13,517
This was in 1991.

1169
01:29:13,584 --> 01:29:15,882
And I'm just going to play it for you

1170
01:29:15,954 --> 01:29:19,856
so you can hear what it sounded like.

1171
01:29:21,659 --> 01:29:24,822
<i>I feel really moved</i>
<i>by what everybody is saying.</i>

1172
01:29:24,896 --> 01:29:26,955
<i>What's your name?</i>
<i>- My name's Robert.</i>

1173
01:29:27,031 --> 01:29:29,397
<i>Hi, Robert.</i>

1174
01:29:29,467 --> 01:29:31,401
I didn't use my real name.

1175
01:29:34,105 --> 01:29:35,299
I'm blowing my nose.

1176
01:29:35,373 --> 01:29:37,238
<i>I used to be married and...</i>

1177
01:29:41,746 --> 01:29:43,270
<i>It's hard to talk.</i>

1178
01:29:46,384 --> 01:29:49,012
<i>I started seeing prostitutes and...</i>

1179
01:29:50,488 --> 01:29:52,820
<i>... it destroyed my marriage and...</i>

1180
01:29:55,226 --> 01:29:56,693
<i>Then I got...</i>

1181
01:29:58,529 --> 01:30:00,793
<i>... involved with somebody else and...</i>

1182
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:04,797
<i>... that just ended recently...</i>

1183
01:30:06,337 --> 01:30:07,964
<i>... for the same reason.</i>

1184
01:30:08,773 --> 01:30:11,139
Ooh, I hit the record button.

1185
01:30:12,276 --> 01:30:14,073
Anyway, that was, uh...

1186
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:17,709
That was that.
I mean, there's more, but...

1187
01:30:18,783 --> 01:30:20,250
Let's go back to the movie.

1188
01:30:20,318 --> 01:30:23,583
<i>I started going to meetings</i>
<i>regularly after that</i>

1189
01:30:23,654 --> 01:30:27,715
<i>and was eventually able to stop</i>
<i>having sex with prostitutes long enough</i>

1190
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:29,225
<i>to get married again.</i>

1191
01:30:31,329 --> 01:30:34,457
<i>Unfortunately, that marriage</i>
<i>didn't work out so well.</i>

1192
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:38,561
<i>Two years later, as our marriage</i>
<i>was falling apart,</i>

1193
01:30:38,636 --> 01:30:43,266
<i>I had sex with a prostitute</i>
<i>and told my wife.</i>

1194
01:30:43,341 --> 01:30:45,571
<i>She filed for divorce soon after.</i>

1195
01:30:47,211 --> 01:30:49,611
Hi, my name's Caveh.
I'm a sex addict.

1196
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:51,204
Hi, Caveh.

1197
01:30:51,282 --> 01:30:52,909
<i>It wasn't easy,</i>

1198
01:30:52,984 --> 01:30:56,579
<i>but after several more years of going</i>
<i>to meetings at least once a week,</i>

1199
01:30:56,654 --> 01:31:00,249
<i>I was eventually able to stop having sex</i>
<i>with prostitutes altogether.</i>

1200
01:31:00,324 --> 01:31:04,192
It's hard to explain
how I was eventually able to stop.

1201
01:31:04,262 --> 01:31:06,822
It wasn't just one thing.

1202
01:31:06,898 --> 01:31:12,200
But the way I think about it is in terms
of the story of Orpheus and the Sirens.

1203
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:17,867
<i>The Sirens were these mythical creatures</i>

1204
01:31:17,942 --> 01:31:20,137
<i>whose singing was so seductive</i>

1205
01:31:20,211 --> 01:31:23,578
<i>that anyone hearing them</i>
<i>would go insane with desire.</i>

1206
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:29,413
<i>Sailors would fling themselves</i>
<i>overboard to try to reach them,</i>

1207
01:31:29,487 --> 01:31:32,183
<i>only to die upon the rocks below.</i>

1208
01:31:33,724 --> 01:31:37,683
<i>But when Jason and the Argonauts</i>
<i>had to sail past the Sirens,</i>

1209
01:31:37,762 --> 01:31:41,198
<i>Orpheus, the greatest singer</i>
<i>in ancient Greece,</i>

1210
01:31:41,265 --> 01:31:43,199
<i>came up with an ingenious idea.</i>

1211
01:31:45,770 --> 01:31:47,897
<i>He simply started singing.</i>

1212
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,565
<i>And because his song was so beautiful,</i>

1213
01:31:51,642 --> 01:31:54,805
<i>the oarsmen had ears only for his song</i>

1214
01:31:54,879 --> 01:31:56,972
<i>and didn't even hear the Sirens.</i>

1215
01:31:58,783 --> 01:32:00,910
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>that's what happened to me.</i>

1216
01:32:02,286 --> 01:32:04,516
<i>I heard a more beautiful song.</i>

1217
01:32:16,567 --> 01:32:19,559
- And then I met Mandy.
- Hi.

1218
01:32:19,637 --> 01:32:22,538
<i>- This is Mandy.</i>
- We just went swimming.

1219
01:32:22,607 --> 01:32:26,668
<i>We met in a dance class</i>
<i>and fell in love soon afterwards.</i>

1220
01:32:29,113 --> 01:32:31,946
<i>We've been together for seven years now,</i>

1221
01:32:32,016 --> 01:32:34,985
<i>which is by far the longest</i>
<i>I've ever been with anyone.</i>

1222
01:32:36,888 --> 01:32:39,186
I love you, sweetie.
- I love you, too.

1223
01:32:39,257 --> 01:32:41,157
<i>Now, I'm not saying we never fight.</i>

1224
01:32:41,225 --> 01:32:44,217
Mandy, I was willing to talk about it.
You weren't.

1225
01:32:44,295 --> 01:32:46,286
<i>We fight a lot.</i>

1226
01:32:46,364 --> 01:32:49,197
Now he's in here and he's filming me.

1227
01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:52,703
<i>But fighting no longer makes me</i>
<i>want to go have sex with a prostitute</i>

1228
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:54,897
<i>or look for a new girlfriend.</i>

1229
01:32:54,972 --> 01:32:59,739
<i>Instead, I just hang in there</i>
<i>and really try to work it out.</i>

1230
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,272
I could go on and on
about how great she is,

1231
01:33:05,349 --> 01:33:07,340
but the wedding's about to begin.

1232
01:33:07,418 --> 01:33:09,318
Greg, let's do the boutonniere.

1233
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:38,874
Are you ready?
Here we go.

1234
01:35:36,767 --> 01:35:38,735
One, two, three.
