<i>BARNYARD 2006 (HDTV)</i>

2
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,100
All right, now.

3
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:27,787
I'm just heading to the fields, Duke.
I'll be back.

4
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:55,779
Clear!

5
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:00,097
Hey, Jerry, how's your mama?

6
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,482
Oh, yeah, it's a beautiful day.
Well, time to go to work.

7
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,004
Morning, Ben.

8
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:18,704
Thanks, Miles.

9
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,814
Let me know if you see Otis.

10
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,924
I'm staying out of that one.

11
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,185
- Okay, meeting's in five minutes.
- Okay, boss.

12
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,392
And I want everyone present.

13
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:30,790
Duke, have you seen Otis?

14
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,516
Nope, I haven't seen him.

15
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,201
Now where was I? Oh, oh, yeah.

16
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,765
The Jersey cows.

17
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,273
- Hey, Benny boy.
- Hi.

18
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:48,247
Hey, you seen Otis around?

19
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:50,740
Yes, I know exactly where Otis is.

20
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:53,810
You boys just steer clear
of Otis, all right?

21
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,015
Anything you say there, Ben.

22
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:57,455
We'll take a rain check
on the meeting, though.

23
00:02:57,551 --> 00:03:00,332
- Yeah, rain check.
- Yeah, that. Check.

24
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:01,387
Hey.

25
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:06,662
Hey, I stepped in something.
What's on my hoof?

26
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:08,869
Etta?

27
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,897
- Otis?
- Oh, Ben, don't worry.

28
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,487
I'm sure he's heading
for the meeting right now.

29
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:20,474
Okay, let go. Let go. I got it.

30
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:22,105
- He said, "Let go."
- All right. He's okay.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,887
All right, boys, here's the dealio.

32
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:29,011
It's a little creation of mine
I like to call "hill surfing."

33
00:03:29,107 --> 00:03:31,313
- Watch your hoof.
- I'll spot you. I'll spot you.

34
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:33,711
Are you sure this is safe, Otis?

35
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,726
Peck! Come on, safe?

36
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,794
It's completely safe!
Since when isn't surfing safe?

37
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,041
He's got a point.

38
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,823
Okay, salt lick.

39
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:47,811
- It's go time!
- I'll try it. I'm down.

40
00:03:47,907 --> 00:03:49,346
- Shotgun!
- Piggyback!

41
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,648
Never! You are all gonna die.

42
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,388
- Freddy?
- Nothing.

43
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,307
Wait a second. Photo op.

44
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,649
Okay, get together!

45
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:05,075
- Hey, Pig?
- What?

46
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:07,186
- Where'd you get that apple?
- This apple?

47
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,543
Oh, well,
it originally was attached to this.

48
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:15,435
Otis?

49
00:04:15,531 --> 00:04:18,120
What? What? What happened?

50
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:22,245
You know, it's times like this
when I really like to say...

51
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,684
Oh, caca!

52
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:26,273
You didn't do that!

53
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,238
Okay, okay! Look, this is bad enough!

54
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,828
Please, no one scream, "Tree!"

55
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:53,513
Tree!

56
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,337
Let's surf!

57
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:14,615
Hang on now, boys! Yeah! Hang hoof!

58
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,493
Otis? Are we supposed to
not yell, "Rock"?

59
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,801
We got a gusher!

60
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,037
Chicken farm!

61
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,668
Oh, I get it.
We can't yell "Tree" or "Rock",

62
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:57,394
but you get to yell, "Chicken farm."

63
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:11,879
Morning, everyone.

64
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,428
Okay, before we get started,
we have a birthday.

65
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:18,784
Everett the dog turned 13 today.

66
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,046
Boy, those dog years are rough, huh?

67
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,074
Also, remember it's...

68
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,420
Whassup?

69
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,407
Hey, Pop. Look, I know you're probably
looking for an explanation regarding

70
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:43,435
the exploded chicken on me,
and the sticky black... The oil stuff.

71
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:50,053
You are gonna love this! I'll tell you...
You the most, because

72
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,260
you, my friend, are a laugher.
And every...

73
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:54,658
- Didn't we all know that? Right?
- Just take a seat.

74
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:56,959
I'll... I'll take a seat.

75
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:01,755
Cool.

76
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,688
Oh, sorry about that.

77
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,045
Little tight.

78
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,690
As I was saying,

79
00:07:12,786 --> 00:07:15,184
remember tonight at the hoedown,
it's free cider night.

80
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,828
Hey. Hey, Pig,
I think there's a dead bee in your nostril.

81
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:21,514
That's not dead.

82
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:25,542
Okay, the first matter at hand:
gray market goods.

83
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,037
As if I needed to say it again.

84
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,969
The purchase of human articles
from the gopher underground

85
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,984
is strictly prohibited.

86
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,189
<i>Hello, Moto!</i>

87
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,109
Hey, Otis.
Yeah, listen, I think your Nikes are...

88
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:47,987
Yeah, this really isn't the best time.

89
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:48,083
Yeah, this really isn't the best time.

90
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:50,481
Hang on a second. Frankie, come here.
Frankie, come here.

91
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,687
No, I'm not... Come here. I'm not
gonna hurt you. Frankie, come here.

92
00:07:52,783 --> 00:07:55,757
<i>I told you never to do that again,</i>
<i>as long as I live!</i>

93
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:57,963
<i>Now, put it over there! Now!</i>

94
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,744
Sorry about that. Frankie's out of hand.

95
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,991
Oh, the Nikes. What's the make again?

96
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:06,690
Yeah. Yeah, I really should go,
Mr. Jordan Air.

97
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,225
Wrong number.

98
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,048
Thank you.

99
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:14,077
Second item.

100
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,817
Lest I remind you, this is coyote season.

101
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:18,968
That's right.

102
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,750
These are ruthless
and desperate creatures.

103
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,436
Rule number one: stay in groups.

104
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:29,519
Rule number two: stay inside
the perimeter of the fence at all times.

105
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,068
And number three: be careful out there.

106
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:35,082
Okay, let's hit it.

107
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,331
And leaving quickly. Walking out.
Walking out. Step, step, step wider...

108
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:46,400
Otis, why don't you stick around
for a minute?

109
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:48,031
He's scary. Bye.

110
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:50,621
Okay, Miles. What do you think?

111
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,443
I think you're lucky.

112
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,554
Most cows only have four hooves,

113
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,951
but you're gonna have an extra one
right up your...

114
00:08:57,047 --> 00:08:59,061
Okay, that's nice. Dad!

115
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:03,569
- Sit.
- And I'm sitting.

116
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,255
Okay. First off,

117
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:09,421
I don't even want to know
who was on the other end of that phone.

118
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,339
- It was the gophers, wasn't it?
- Well, I...

119
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:14,313
No, I don't want to know.
Was it the gophers?

120
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:17,285
- Here's...
- No, don't. I don't want to know.

121
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:21,026
Why do you do this to me?
How do you think that makes me look?

122
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,753
So this... This is about you?

123
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,055
Where were you this morning, Otis?

124
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,453
I was having a little fun.
I mean, you should try it.

125
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:30,714
It starts with a smile,
then slowly builds and...

126
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,400
You promised to help me
with the brush around the fence.

127
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,318
You know it's coyote season.

128
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:40,114
Geez, coyotes. I don't get it.
What's the big deal? They're coyotes.

129
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:44,334
Them tiny, us big!
What are they gonna do?

130
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:45,868
You have a lot to learn.

131
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:47,979
And you know what,
I don't get the fence thing.

132
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:49,705
Really, it can't keep them out.

133
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:52,775
That fence defines our space.

134
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,981
And as long as I'm still kicking,

135
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:59,106
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

136
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:01,313
Okay, that's what you do. You.

137
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,902
Okay, if you're trying to groom me
to be the big leader,

138
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:06,013
just give it up. It's not me, Pop.

139
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,026
I mean, if I were in charge,
things would be different.

140
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:11,192
Every animal for himself.
That's the way it should be.

141
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,535
Otis.

142
00:10:13,494 --> 00:10:15,892
A strong man stands up for himself.

143
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,440
A stronger man stands up for others.

144
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:21,646
Oh, shoot. You know, I forgot my pen.

145
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:24,236
- And your shift tonight?
- I'll be there.

146
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,730
Otis, you're gonna have to
grow up one day.

147
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:30,279
You'll never be happy
if you spend all your time goofing off.

148
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,581
No? Just watch me.

149
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:39,679
Manabunga!

150
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,983
Freddy, is this great or what?

151
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,915
Oh, yeah.
I could just eat your head right off!

152
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:57,136
I mean... You know, it's fun up here.

153
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:07,782
Pip?

154
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,469
I'd go with the wood on this one.

155
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,928
That's what I'm talking about!
Sweet mama!

156
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,517
Hey, there's animals over there!

157
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,450
Nice shoes.

158
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:45,477
<i>Oh, doctor!</i>
<i>What a game we have here today!</i>

159
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,081
Yeah!

160
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:53,247
<i>He got the ball on the 30.</i>
<i>He's down on the 20. Lifts it up...</i>

161
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:54,781
<i>It's a touchdown!</i>

162
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:56,988
Yeah!

163
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:36,793
Bacon!

164
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,232
Hamburger!

165
00:12:38,328 --> 00:12:39,862
Chorizo!

166
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,356
- Filet!
- What are you doing?

167
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:46,097
I'm naming the kinds of cuts of meat
to the animal I'm jumping on.

168
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:47,056
Machaca!

169
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,303
Pork chops!

170
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,221
Rump roast!

171
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:53,003
You know what?
You don't need to be doing this.

172
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,456
Oaty-oaty! Oaty-oaty!

173
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:58,375
Hi, Oaty.

174
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:02,019
Hey, Maddie. Looking good over there.

175
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,321
Chubba Face, you crazy cow.

176
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,678
Say, "I'm smooshy."

177
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:10,365
I am smooshy.

178
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:13,433
Okay, now you.

179
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,544
Say, "Boy, is it windy."

180
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:17,942
Boy, is it windy.

181
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,929
My turn, my turn.

182
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:26,670
- Okay, chick. Just run along now.
- Bye, Oaty.

183
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:31,466
All righty.

184
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:34,918
Hey, who is she?

185
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,796
They just showed up.
Farmer took them in.

186
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:39,523
Thank you, Farmer.

187
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:41,729
Yeah, something happened
with their herd.

188
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:43,839
They're the only two that made it.

189
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,566
She needs a friend.

190
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:47,099
Wait, wait, wait!

191
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:50,457
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
notice you over there.

192
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:54,967
Hey! Oh, look at you. You're all...

193
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:57,940
- Pregnant?
- Yeah, sure. I mean...

194
00:13:58,036 --> 00:14:00,241
Really? 'Cause, I mean,
it isn't that noticeable, you know.

195
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:01,968
I mean, especially when you
stand straight on,

196
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:03,598
and you don't look at it.

197
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:05,517
You know, when you turn to the side,
it gets a little lumpy.

198
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,724
I mean glowy. Glowy. It's a glow.

199
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,505
I'm... I'm Otis.

200
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,342
Back off, Daisy.
There's an "L" on that boy's forehead.

201
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,028
No, that's just me,
the contortion mouse.

202
00:14:18,946 --> 00:14:19,905
C!

203
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:21,152
X!

204
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:22,207
N!

205
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,988
- Q!
- Oh, man, you're killing me, dude.

206
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:29,400
Look, I just wanted to welcome you
to the barnyard.

207
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,415
I'm sure that you and your...

208
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:34,964
Not looking. The key word, "not".

209
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:37,649
Work with me. Not looking.

210
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,047
This is my friend, Bessy.

211
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,773
Yeah, she's a cupcake.

212
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,514
- It was nice to meet you, Otis.
- Yeah, too you.

213
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,775
You know what? Switch those.

214
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:50,694
Oh, boy.

215
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,434
There's nothing for you there,
but I kind of like her friend.

216
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:15,632
He's out!

217
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:23,786
All clear! Sweet!

218
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:31,459
<i>Now, every heifer, every cow</i>
<i>Hold tight to your udders now</i>

219
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,431
<i>Farmer Brown is bedding down</i>
<i>Let's turn this barn into funky town</i>

220
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,063
<i>Chickens on the left</i>
<i>Dance with your neighbor</i>

221
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:36,254
<i>Hogs, don't slobber on the pool table</i>

222
00:15:36,254 --> 00:15:37,597
<i>Hogs, don't slobber on the pool table</i>

223
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:41,529
<i>Try to go easy on the manure</i>
<i>It's a dance floor, not a sewer</i>

224
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:50,067
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>

225
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,369
Put this thing on hot!

226
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,725
<i>Better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

227
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,219
<i>You better hold on tight and pray</i>

228
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:01,961
<i>You better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

229
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:05,029
<i>Darling, you better run</i>
<i>'Cause I won't hold back them horses</i>

230
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,523
<i>Hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

231
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:10,784
<i>We will rumble and tumble</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

232
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:21,527
<i>Here we go again</i>
<i>Come grab your friend</i>

233
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:23,158
<i>Shake him up, shake him down</i>
<i>Try to get a good blend</i>

234
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,460
<i>Here we go, do-si-do</i>
<i>Here we go</i>

235
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:28,242
- <i>First you hold on tight</i>
- <i>Hold on tight</i>

236
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:30,735
- <i>Then you dance all night</i>
- <i>Dance all night</i>

237
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,845
<i>Hit the hay!</i>

238
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,340
<i>Better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

239
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,545
<i>You better hold on tight and pray</i>

240
00:16:38,217 --> 00:16:41,189
<i>You better hold on tight</i>
<i>When we go hitting the hay</i>

241
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:47,233
<i>Hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

242
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:50,493
<i>We will rumble and tumble</i>
<i>Night and day</i>

243
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,467
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

244
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:56,057
<i>With our backsides shaking</i>
<i>We'll go hitting the hay</i>

245
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:57,976
Wow! This is amazing.

246
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:06,224
What you looking at?

247
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:07,855
What? You want some of this?

248
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,677
Oh, yeah, I didn't think so.

249
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:12,363
Sit right here, honey.

250
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,472
The flowers are beautiful.

251
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:27,806
See? On time, just like I...

252
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:28,957
Right.

253
00:17:29,436 --> 00:17:30,970
Cramp! That's a cramp!

254
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:32,505
Oh, it's cramping!

255
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:38,548
And release.

256
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:40,849
- Hello, Son.
- Dad,

257
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:43,440
I've been thinking,

258
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,838
and I'm willing to accept your apology.

259
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,907
- Really?
- Sure. I mean, it's only right. I mean...

260
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:52,551
Okay.

261
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,924
I don't mean to let you down, Pop.
I'm just out trying to have some fun.

262
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,857
It's a beautiful night.

263
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:04,926
I remember when I used to
sit out here with your sister.

264
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,132
- I don't have a sister.
- Oh, yeah.

265
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,434
That was you, wasn't it?

266
00:18:10,969 --> 00:18:11,928
Thank you, all right.

267
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,229
So, are we okay?

268
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,531
- We're okay.
- Great.

269
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:17,779
See, 'cause I wanted
to ask you something.

270
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,601
My friends are all going
to the barn tonight,

271
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,807
and not that it matters either way to me,

272
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:22,959
but evidently, I'm needed.

273
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,069
I'm a sort of an integral part
of a musical number.

274
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,946
Yeah, I tried to tell them no, you know?
But they were just so...

275
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,536
I told them, "My dad's not gonna
wanna cover my shift.

276
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:34,373
"I mean, it's my shift, not his.
It isn't his!" You know?

277
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:37,442
"I don't want to be selfish.
What's mine is mine, and..."

278
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,457
What do you think?

279
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:42,335
Otis...

280
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,336
I never thought
I was gonna amount to much.

281
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:53,268
I certainly didn't think
I'd be in charge of anything.

282
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,050
But that all changed one day.

283
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,927
It was the day you showed up.

284
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:01,517
I head out into the meadow

285
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:04,395
and I see this little baby calf all alone,

286
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,504
stumbling around.

287
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:09,382
You know,
before you became a nightmare.

288
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:13,219
Well, I took you home that night,

289
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,727
and I know it doesn't sound possible,

290
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,934
but I looked up into the sky

291
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:22,523
and I would have swore

292
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,825
I saw the stars dance.

293
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,237
At that moment,
I knew my place was here,

294
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:31,635
taking care of things.

295
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:35,472
I guess you helped me realize that.

296
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:38,061
I love you, Son.

297
00:19:40,363 --> 00:19:42,377
- You still want to go, don't you?
- Yeah, I really do.

298
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,022
Not that your stuff... You know, the stuff
you're saying isn't nifty and everything...

299
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,653
No one says "nifty".

300
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,339
I say "nifty." I do, and sometimes
even "swifty." I'll say that.

301
00:19:50,435 --> 00:19:51,969
Very impressive.

302
00:19:52,353 --> 00:19:54,942
Go ahead, have fun. I'll cover your shift.

303
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:56,957
Thanks, Pop. You're the best.

304
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:58,396
- Otis?
- Yeah?

305
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:00,122
Be the stronger man.

306
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:02,040
Yeah. Yeah, that's
that saying thing, right?

307
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,766
"A strong man stands up for himself.

308
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:06,740
"A stronger man can
bridge the gap between..."

309
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,851
Got it locked in the vault.

310
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:12,496
See? I learn.

311
00:20:23,718 --> 00:20:25,732
<i>Mr. Boombastic</i>

312
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:30,816
<i>What you want is a boombastic</i>
<i>Romantic, fantastic lover</i>

313
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:34,365

<i>Say me fantastic</i>

314
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:38,297
<i>Touch me in me back</i>

315
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:40,215

00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:42,997
<i>Touch me in me back</i>

Who's here? Moo! It's me! Moo!

319
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:50,958
Whassup? Milk me!

320
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:52,301
Hey, babe.

321
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,384
My barn. That's right, my barn.

322
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,564
You're late. Come on.

323
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,674
He's a real winner, that one.

324
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:07,169
Oh, stop. I think he's kind of cute.

325
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:09,566
<i>Lay down in my Jacuzzi</i>

00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,320

Biggy Cheese!

330
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:27,694
We're gonna have some fun
tonight, y'all.

331
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,283
Hey, Buck.
Get your hooves off the stage.

332
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,490
You ain't in show business.

333
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,821
What, were you raised in a barn?

334
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:45,439
Well, you're a good horse. Okay...

335
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:48,413
What you looking at, Turkey?

336
00:21:50,906 --> 00:21:53,017
Somebody pass me
the cranberry sauce.

337
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:56,470
Dead turkey walking.

338
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:58,772
We all gonna die,
but we don't know the date.

339
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:01,074
We know your date, Thanksgiving!

340
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:09,131
Okay, to kick things off tonight,
I got a special treat.

341
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,146
Back by popular demand.

342
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:13,543
Ladies, this one's for you.

343
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,283
Our own Otis and the Crew!

344
00:22:24,095 --> 00:22:26,875
<i>Well, down on the farm</i>

345
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:30,520
<i>Where they all ask for you</i>

346
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,865
Parties all hours of the night.

347
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:44,140
What is that farmer up to?
You know what?

348
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:46,731
- I'm gonna call someone.
- Oh, leave him be.

349
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:49,705
Well, I'll just call whoever I want,
whenever I want to.

350
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,334
That's exactly what I'll do.

351
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,308
Because I know
what a rave is, Mr. Lump.

352
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:57,570
"I'm going to sit and watch TV
and be a lump."

353
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:01,118
Okay, Mr. Lumpy. It's just not right.

354
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:05,721
<i>They all ask for you</i>

355
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:09,367
<i>They all ask for you</i>

356
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,436
<i>Down on the farm</i>

357
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:20,589
<i>They all ask for you</i>

358
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:40,540
I'll check it.

359
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:46,294
It's all right. Calm down.
It's just the pizza guy.

360
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:47,829
I'm on it.

361
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,460
Watch out. I got it. I got it.

362
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:50,994
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

363
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,668
Thanks. You want change?

364
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:00,107
No, keep it.

365
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:02,696
So, you really ordered a lot of pizzas.

366
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,670
Well, yes.
We're having a big human party.

367
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:07,588
Just a party. A big one.

368
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:10,753
With us celebrating our humanness.

369
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,535
- Dude, I love parties! Can I...
- No.

370
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:17,564
Okay. Well, then, I'll see you.

371
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,949
Ouch!

372
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:27,635
My arm fell off.

373
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:29,841
My fake arm, I mean.

374
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:34,157
Wow, I am so sorry about that.

375
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:36,747
- Do you need any help?
- No, I don't like help.

376
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:41,927
It's just against my religion.
I'm a Nohelpian.

377
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,051
Cool, I'm a Lutheran.

378
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:47,873
What about this?

379
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,271
You know what? You keep it.
It's dirty now.

380
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,189
Really? All right.

381
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:54,396
Dude, I got a arm!

382
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:57,369
Yeah! Righteous!

383
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:24,802
<i>Well, I won't back down</i>

384
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:29,022
<i>No, I won't back down</i>

385
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:34,105
<i>You can stand me up</i>
<i>at the gates of hell</i>

386
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:37,174
<i>But I won't back down</i>

387
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:41,587
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

388
00:25:42,353 --> 00:25:45,711
<i>Won't be turned around</i>

389
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:50,314
<i>And I'll keep this world</i>
<i>from dragging me down</i>

390
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:53,578
<i>Gonna stand my ground</i>

391
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:48,153
Good evening, ladies.

392
00:26:48,826 --> 00:26:50,360
Sorry to call on you
so late in the evening,

393
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:52,470
but we did have a previous engagement.

394
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,704
Now, we're gonna take six of you.

395
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,486
Anyone makes a sound,
we don't mind the extra company.

396
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:03,788
Boys, take your pick.

397
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:06,569
You won't be taking any hens tonight.

398
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:10,982
And you're gonna stop us?

399
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:16,353
Is that what's gonna happen?
Are you gonna stop us, hen?

400
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:18,656
How are you gonna do that?

401
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:24,410
No, he is.

402
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:30,837
Ben. How are you, Ben?

403
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:33,426
We would've said hello,
had we seen you.

404
00:27:33,523 --> 00:27:35,248
Put the hen down, Dag.

405
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:38,990
Sure, Ben. Whatever you say.

406
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:42,059
We're just doing a little courting,
that's all.

407
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:44,553
You know how much we like the hens.

408
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:49,444
You know me, ladykiller.

409
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:53,186
You have us
at a bit of a disadvantage here, Ben.

410
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:55,296
There's six of us,

411
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,133
and only one old, fat you.

412
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,539
Oh, baby! Party time!

413
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:48,093
Otis!

414
00:29:48,764 --> 00:29:49,725
Otis!

415
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,767
Otis! Otis!

416
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:57,782
It's Ben.

417
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:08,621
Oh, no. No, no.

418
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:50,868
Yeah. You hang on there, buddy.

419
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,610
All right now, Otis. Just lift.

420
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:04,584
Ten and two. Ten and two.

421
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:09,475
Not like that. Now lift, and two.

422
00:32:10,723 --> 00:32:11,970
You dog!

423
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,204
Come here, fisherman.

424
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,469
What do we do now? Who's gonna
protect us from the coyotes?

425
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:37,675
Anybody got a pistol?

426
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:40,649
Order, here! Hey, am I bothering you?

427
00:32:40,745 --> 00:32:42,663
Let's get this meeting started.

428
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:45,156
- Duke, who's gonna run the meeting?
- That's what the meeting's about.

429
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:47,843
The meeting's about
finding someone to run the meeting?

430
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:49,376
Is that a good idea?

431
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:50,816
We should take a meeting about it.

432
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:53,118
Someone has to do this.
We don't have Ben.

433
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:55,899
Therefore, I would like
to nominate myself.

434
00:32:57,626 --> 00:32:58,968
Dogs are... Listen to me.

435
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,038
Dogs are watchful,
they're loyal, and very protective.

436
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,572
And they lick themselves.

437
00:33:03,668 --> 00:33:05,012
I don't want a leader who licks himself.

438
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,354
- Me, neither.
- That's nasty.

439
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,410
I can't even reach mine.

440
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:08,848
I don't do that.

441
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:11,054
Anymore.

442
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,219
One time, I was bored,
lonely, and a little snackish.

443
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,330
Yeah, I saw you drink
out of a toilet once.

444
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:19,591
- Hey, you drink potty water.
- You drink potty water!

445
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,715
My bowl was empty, my friend.
Come on, we're getting off track here.

446
00:33:24,675 --> 00:33:28,127
Duke, with all respect,
I think there are certain traits

447
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,622
that would make you unqualified
to be leader.

448
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,061
Yeah, such as?

449
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:42,898
Your point?

450
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,201
Hey, come on, I do that for fun,

451
00:33:45,776 --> 00:33:47,984
not 'cause I have to. Go on!

452
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:03,617
So, big deal. I fetch balls.
One little flaw.

453
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:17,238
This doesn't mean anything.

454
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:23,568
All right, all right, let's take a vote.
Come on, let's take a vote here.

455
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:26,254
All those in favor
of me being the new leader.

456
00:34:32,008 --> 00:34:33,160
Those opposed?

457
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,572
- Can you see my hand?
- Listen now, listen up.

458
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:41,312
You all know that Ben always
intended for Otis to take his place.

459
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:43,231
All right, Otis is in charge.

460
00:34:43,424 --> 00:34:45,437
I second that motion. Sweet!

461
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,440
Here we go.

462
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:56,371
Try and catch me.

463
00:34:58,386 --> 00:34:59,825
Stay in line.

464
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:02,127
Maddie, we don't want to lose you.

465
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:18,912
Oh, I think that would be just fine.

466
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:22,365
Oaty-oaty! Hey, Oaty!

467
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:30,519
Hey, Maddie, now really isn't a good...

468
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:34,163
What are you doing?
Would you stop? Come on.

469
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,712
Hey, hey, hey, guys, guys...

470
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:40,014
- Oh, goodness gracious.
- What is it? What is it?

471
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,950
Otis, it's a madhouse! Isn't it just great?

472
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,458
You got hit with a soccer ball.

473
00:36:21,355 --> 00:36:24,039
I thought I'd be the first
to congratulate you, Otis.

474
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:26,437
- You're in charge now.
- I'm what?

475
00:36:27,205 --> 00:36:29,027
Miles, I am not in charge, okay?

476
00:36:29,123 --> 00:36:32,481
I don't do "In charge".

477
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,550
- This is not my responsibility.
- I hear you.

478
00:36:35,646 --> 00:36:38,140
But you were elected fair and square.

479
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,728
Congratulations, boss.

480
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:45,812
Hey!

481
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:51,856
Have you all lost your mind?

482
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,829
It's daylight.
The Farmer's gonna be back.

483
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:58,089
This is so off limits.

484
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,296
Come on, Otis,

485
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,612
I know your weak spot.

486
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:07,202
Wild Mike!

487
00:37:07,585 --> 00:37:09,792
- What?
- Wild Mike.

488
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,533
Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

489
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:15,067
- Wild Mike.
- I'm not doing this, okay?

490
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:16,602
- There's no way this is happening.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

491
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,425
- Everybody just get back to your...
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

492
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:22,069
- Return to your designated quadrants.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

493
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:26,001
Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

494
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:27,728
- This is ridiculous!
- Wild Mike!

495
00:37:27,824 --> 00:37:31,085
I'm not gonna dance
just because you're getting Wild Mike.

496
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:33,195
- Pip, help me out here.
- Wild Mike. Wild Mike.

497
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,416
You can't fight it, Otis.
You're a born party animal.

498
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:41,444
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

499
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,706
Wild Mike! Wild Mike! Wild Mike!

500
00:37:50,078 --> 00:37:51,901
Let's boogie!

501
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:59,574
<i>We're heading for the West</i>
<i>Not heading for the East</i>

502
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:02,835
<i>We're gonna live our dream</i>
<i>'Cause we're wild and free</i>

503
00:38:02,931 --> 00:38:04,465
Look at that freaky thing.

504
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,288
What kind of animal is that?

505
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,782
I don't know, but he sure can dance.

506
00:38:23,074 --> 00:38:26,142
I say, let's kill it.
Give me that piece of wood over there.

507
00:38:38,227 --> 00:38:41,394
Sweet legs! Get the sweet legs!
I got the sweet legs!

508
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,940
Moo?

509
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,489
What did you do that for?

510
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:30,982
What else was I gonna do? He saw you.

511
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,996
You could have killed him!

512
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:37,984
I got a pulse.

513
00:39:40,286 --> 00:39:43,643
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.
This is so bad.

514
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:45,082
Baaad.

515
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:49,014
Everybody, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

516
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,179
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

517
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,729
What?

518
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:57,839
Come on. You're our leader. Lead us.

519
00:39:58,031 --> 00:40:00,045
That does not apply to this.

520
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:03,881
This is a totally, situationally
different suspect.

521
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,799
Hey, whoa, no.

522
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:08,485
- We gotta ditch the body.
- Stop it!

523
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:11,651
He knows too much.
We gotta take care of him.

524
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:15,104
- We gotta whack him.
- There will be no whacking, okay?

525
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,311
The Farmer's a good guy.
He's been good to us.

526
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:19,516
He's a vegan, God bless him.

527
00:40:19,613 --> 00:40:22,681
And what is a vegan, again?

528
00:40:22,777 --> 00:40:23,833
I know this one.

529
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:26,134
No, I got it. It means
you can't eat anything with a face.

530
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:27,860
No, no, no, that's a vegetarian.

531
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,875
Vegetarians have to eat
in the dark, right?

532
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,506
That's a vampire. Come on.

533
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:32,656
You can't eat cheese?

534
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:36,110
It's not just cheese.
Vegans can't have any dairy products.

535
00:40:36,206 --> 00:40:37,836
- Cake?
- Cake has egg products.

536
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:39,371
But you can't have any dairy.

537
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:43,688
No dairy? I love dairy.
Does that mean I can't be a vegan?

538
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:46,372
I love the smell of bacon.
There, I said it.

539
00:40:50,497 --> 00:40:51,648
Would you not do that?

540
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,238
It's not like we have a lot of options.

541
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:57,595
Boy, that's a doozy.
That thing's bigger than me.

542
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,650
Push it.

543
00:40:58,841 --> 00:41:01,528
- He wakes up, you got my back, right?
- Yeah.

544
00:41:08,817 --> 00:41:09,969
Come on. Come on.

545
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:14,189
Okay, watch this. Off his nose,
on the belly, on the floor. Check it.

546
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:23,109
Book.

547
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,468
Okay, now.
He was sitting here, he was reading.

548
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:36,633
- Something fell on his head, and...
- I got it.

549
00:41:42,005 --> 00:41:43,731
Too light.
Couldn't cause a bump like that.

550
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:45,267
I bet it could.

551
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:49,487
Would you cut it out?
We need something bigger.

552
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:51,309
Can I have the apple?

553
00:41:53,515 --> 00:41:55,242
What's with the look?

554
00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:12,603
He's buying it.

555
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:15,672
He's not buying it.

556
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:18,646
He's buying it.

557
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,044
He's not buying it.

558
00:42:22,003 --> 00:42:24,400
No, he's buying it.

559
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,584
Will you stop doing that?

560
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,517
Well, unless you get him a blindfold,
I'm going to kick him!

561
00:42:48,188 --> 00:42:49,627
Okay, let's go.

562
00:43:08,523 --> 00:43:10,536
There. See? Good as new.

563
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:12,743
I'll tell you,
this being in charge thing isn't so tough.

564
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:16,388
You know what I'm talking about?
You know what I'm talking about. Yeah.

565
00:43:27,034 --> 00:43:30,488
Yeah, hi. Hey, there.
Having a good day? Yeah.

566
00:43:32,022 --> 00:43:34,515
So, this was Otis's idea?

567
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,489
Oh, yeah.
We're like the second line of defense.

568
00:43:37,586 --> 00:43:42,093
We see or hear anything suspicious,
and I just signal Otis with a crow.

569
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:45,450
And I've really been
working on it. Listen.

570
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:56,193
Well, you know, in the moment,
it'll be really strong.

571
00:43:56,289 --> 00:43:58,783
But for now, we just stand watch.

572
00:43:58,879 --> 00:44:00,796
Yeah, watch.

573
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:12,114
Come and get it!

574
00:44:12,787 --> 00:44:14,609
Freddy, you okay?

575
00:44:14,801 --> 00:44:17,583
Boneless white meat!
What? I'm not hungry!

576
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,748
I mean, I don't wanna eat anyone...
Thing... You...

577
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:23,050
What happened? What? What? What?

578
00:44:27,174 --> 00:44:31,778
Okay, quick little once
around the barnyard, then, hello, party!

579
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:42,138
Hey, look at this.
It's our new inside connection.

580
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,344
Congrats, Otis.

581
00:44:45,302 --> 00:44:47,317
Oh, will you look at that?

582
00:44:50,865 --> 00:44:52,688
Don't wake up the cow.

583
00:45:03,334 --> 00:45:05,349
That's called cowtipping.

584
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:11,200
Oh, that so steams me!

585
00:45:11,487 --> 00:45:13,598
Man, I wish I could get
a hold of that little... I would...

586
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,803
Hey, I'm in charge, right?

587
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:19,161
Oh, we are so talking.
Are we not talking?

588
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:22,519
- Talking the talk and walking the walk.
- Walkie-talkie, huh?

589
00:45:22,614 --> 00:45:23,477
Let's go.

590
00:45:23,957 --> 00:45:26,930
Then I said, "That's called cowtipping."

591
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:38,152
I hear music over there again.
Do you hear music?

592
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,646
That farmer's out of control.

593
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:44,101
We should call someone.
We should call someone.

594
00:45:46,115 --> 00:45:47,745
- I smell buttermilk.
- Shut up! Shut up!

595
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:50,335
- What's that smell?
- Stop it! Stop it!

596
00:46:01,748 --> 00:46:04,050
Randall, there is a cow outside.

597
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,559
This is a cow farm.
You're gonna find cows outside.

598
00:46:08,655 --> 00:46:10,382
No, I mean right outside.

599
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:14,889
Right outside this house,
looming like a ghost. Like a reaper.

600
00:46:14,986 --> 00:46:17,959
No, cows don't like houses much.

601
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:22,276
They prefer it out in the meadow,
where they can get a graze on.

602
00:46:22,658 --> 00:46:26,400
Nathan Randall the Third,
I am not crazy.

603
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:29,374
I am medicated
for a chemical imbalance.

604
00:46:29,756 --> 00:46:33,305
Don't you sit there
and think that I am crazy.

605
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,814
Your mind's gone, woman.

606
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:40,403
Where'd it go? I don't know.

607
00:46:40,499 --> 00:46:42,129
It's gone.

608
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,653
- Oh geez, you're on my foot again.
- Sorry.

609
00:46:48,748 --> 00:46:51,914
This is so sweet.
This is so wicked sweet.

610
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,832
I love the new you, Otis.

611
00:46:53,927 --> 00:46:56,134
Okay, Igg,
you remember how to do this?

612
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:57,668
- Oh, he remembers.
- I remember.

613
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,395
- Yeah, he remembers.
- He's remembering.

614
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,546
Right now.

615
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:18,770
Well, pinch me, I'm dreaming.
Here is a first.

616
00:47:18,866 --> 00:47:21,072
Otis joining us on a joyride.

617
00:47:21,168 --> 00:47:25,292
- That's the animal sin of sins, huh?
- "Sin of sins," I like that.

618
00:47:25,388 --> 00:47:27,594
Hey, old Bud. Bud, you bring the stuff?

619
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:30,184
It's right here.

620
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,774
- Show it. Show it.
- It's right here.

621
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:34,117
- Show it.
- It's right here.

622
00:47:34,212 --> 00:47:35,747
- Show it.
- It's right there.

623
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:40,832
We're rebels! We're rebels!

624
00:47:40,927 --> 00:47:42,461
We're the wildest!

625
00:47:42,845 --> 00:47:44,380
There they are.

626
00:47:49,272 --> 00:47:51,861
- Too bad we can't go in there.
- Yeah.

627
00:47:51,957 --> 00:47:53,492
Breaks my heart.

628
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,851
Now remember, honey, I told you,

629
00:48:03,946 --> 00:48:06,441
we can't be staying out this late
on a school night.

630
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:09,222
"We can't be staying out late."

631
00:48:11,813 --> 00:48:14,018
Whatever. I'll do what I want.

632
00:48:14,498 --> 00:48:18,142
Do what I want, when I want,
'cause I want to do it.

633
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:24,090
You've come to the wrong place.

634
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:34,064
- What is that?
- I'm lactose intolerant.

635
00:48:34,256 --> 00:48:36,750
- Oh, man.
- Here we go. I know.

636
00:48:37,038 --> 00:48:39,340
- One, two...
- Yeah.

637
00:48:39,436 --> 00:48:40,492
Two, yeah.

638
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:42,121
Moo!

639
00:48:47,397 --> 00:48:49,795
That's called boytipping!

640
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:57,277
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on, move it!

641
00:48:57,373 --> 00:48:59,003
Let me out!

642
00:49:00,057 --> 00:49:01,784
Okay, go!

643
00:49:08,307 --> 00:49:09,937
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

644
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,951
Never go to meadows.
Never go to meadows.

645
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:13,678
Treat cows nicely.

646
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,693
Okay, no more Red Bull.

647
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,709
Put crowns on our heads,
'cause we are the kings!

648
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,410
Did you see his face?

649
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:37,658
- Price...
- Less.

650
00:49:37,754 --> 00:49:38,616
- Price...
- Less.

651
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:39,672
- Pr...
- Ice...

652
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,727
Less.

653
00:49:43,221 --> 00:49:46,195
A toast! To a new world order.

654
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,497
We are calling the shots now!

655
00:49:48,593 --> 00:49:50,895
- Yeah, it's all about us now.
- You've got that right, Otis.

656
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,197
Nothing can touch us.

657
00:49:55,595 --> 00:49:57,130
Oh, man! Oh, man!

658
00:49:57,225 --> 00:49:58,856
- Oh, man!
- Man, oh, man!

659
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:00,678
Let me out! You gotta let me out!

660
00:50:00,774 --> 00:50:03,940
<i>Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

661
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:05,954
Oh, no, they're talking to us now.

662
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,064
Pull over! You gotta pull over!

663
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,790
We can't pull over!

664
00:50:09,887 --> 00:50:11,134
Hang on!

665
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,339
What could be worse than this?

666
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,176
What we got here
is probably some teenagers

667
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:19,766
going out for a joyride
in their mom's car.

668
00:50:19,861 --> 00:50:23,028
Yeah, we'll shake them up a bit,
send them home. You know kids.

669
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:26,096
Nothing a little strip search
won't cure, yeah.

670
00:50:27,248 --> 00:50:28,974
Is this thing still on?

671
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:30,509
Is that a camera?

672
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:31,948
- This is it. Goodbye.
- They're taping <i>Cops.</i>

673
00:50:32,043 --> 00:50:35,592
Mommy! Mooo-mmy!

674
00:50:35,688 --> 00:50:39,429
Hey, relax. We can lose them.
I mean, it's just a car, right?

675
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:42,498
It's a chopper! It's a chopper!

676
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:44,800
We're gonna die!

677
00:50:44,896 --> 00:50:48,349
<i>We interrupt this program with</i>
<i>a breaking news story. Police are in...</i>

678
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,418
Would you look at that?
The world is going crazy.

679
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:55,638
These kids get all hopped up on
Diet Coke and Jolly Ranchers and just...

680
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,557
That's our car!

681
00:50:58,996 --> 00:51:03,408
That was a hoof.
There's a cow in our car! That is a hoof!

682
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,328
Yes, this is Nora Beady.

683
00:51:12,424 --> 00:51:14,247
What do you mean, "What now?"

684
00:51:14,343 --> 00:51:18,084
My car is on TV,
and I think there's a cow in it.

685
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:21,919
And I saw a cow outside my window.
I think they may be linked.

686
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,469
Don't think I can't call again, Gary.

687
00:51:29,497 --> 00:51:31,128
Oh, that's nice. Good.

688
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,539
They're gonna catch us
and they're gonna dissect us.

689
00:51:37,075 --> 00:51:38,706
We are ditching out!

690
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,133
Two all-beef patties, that's our future!

691
00:51:56,642 --> 00:51:57,793
Out! Run!

692
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,711
- Run!
- Stop touching me!

693
00:52:00,863 --> 00:52:02,780
They're making a run for it. Let's go.
Come on.

694
00:52:02,876 --> 00:52:06,521
<i>This is Gray Badger in Chopper 219.</i>
<i>We've got suspects in sight.</i>

695
00:52:07,192 --> 00:52:08,823
I'm chafing!

696
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:11,029
Okay. Hurry up, fellows.
They're right over there.

697
00:52:11,221 --> 00:52:12,181
Oh, milk me!

698
00:52:12,372 --> 00:52:13,331
Okay, here we go! Here we go!

699
00:52:13,427 --> 00:52:14,386
Milk me!

700
00:52:14,483 --> 00:52:15,729
Geez, these guys are big.

701
00:52:15,825 --> 00:52:16,976
I see them over there.

702
00:52:17,072 --> 00:52:18,510
Cut it right!

703
00:52:22,827 --> 00:52:24,362
We got them!

704
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:45,655
Could you guys believe that?
Did you guys see me?

705
00:52:46,423 --> 00:52:48,149
Me, I am fearless, baby.

706
00:52:48,245 --> 00:52:50,260
- Oh, yeah, fear...
- Less.

707
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:52,657
I think I rolled over my foot.

708
00:52:53,425 --> 00:52:55,823
We left it the same way we found it.

709
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:04,839
Okay, toodle-oo, Otis.
Same time tomorrow night?

710
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,674
Hey, guys, can you imagine
Ben doing something like that?

711
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,032
- No way. No way.
- We'd be in trouble.

712
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:13,470
- Trou...
- Ble.

713
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:37,162
Okay, explain to me exactly
why are we doing this?

714
00:53:37,258 --> 00:53:39,272
Because it's what my dad would do.

715
00:53:39,368 --> 00:53:41,671
Why don't you just go have fun,
all right? I can do this.

716
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,356
No way. We're homeboys.
I'm here with you.

717
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:45,796
Really, it's all right.

718
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:47,810
Okay, I tried! Later, dude.

719
00:53:48,002 --> 00:53:50,784
I'll bring you back a drink or something.
Be back.

720
00:53:57,306 --> 00:54:00,280
Come on back, I'm right here.

721
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,006
Mind if I join you?

722
00:54:02,102 --> 00:54:05,938
No. I mean, sure. I no mind you...

723
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:07,761
Geez, I can't even talk to you!

724
00:54:09,295 --> 00:54:10,926
Hang on a second.

725
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:16,969
Here. You know, just let me...

726
00:54:17,065 --> 00:54:19,653
No, I can still sit on my own, I think.

727
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:23,491
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, the baby's coming!

728
00:54:23,587 --> 00:54:24,642
What?

729
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:27,040
I made you jump.

730
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,493
Nice. Nice. Thank you.
I about swallowed my cud.

731
00:54:33,563 --> 00:54:35,865
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- My cud?

732
00:54:37,016 --> 00:54:40,372
- The night.
- Yeah, that, too. Yeah, it's nice.

733
00:54:43,442 --> 00:54:45,552
My dad had a thing about stars.

734
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:49,581
- Tell me, what was he like?
- My pop?

735
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:52,938
He was amazing.
Bigger than life, you know?

736
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:55,336
Funny, we're not even related.

737
00:54:55,719 --> 00:54:58,212
He found me and he took me in.

738
00:54:59,556 --> 00:55:03,201
I never thought about it before,
but everything he did was for me.

739
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:06,174
He's the only family I've ever known.

740
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:11,162
The last time we talked,
he told me that the night he found me

741
00:55:11,258 --> 00:55:15,958
he looked up into the sky
and he said that the stars...

742
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,562
God, I miss him.

743
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:27,371
What about you?
I mean, if that's too personal, you know.

744
00:55:27,467 --> 00:55:30,441
If I'm overstepping like a boundary or...

745
00:55:31,304 --> 00:55:33,415
You know what? Too bad. Cough it up.

746
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:34,565
Okay.

747
00:55:36,387 --> 00:55:38,210
Well, where do I start?

748
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,526
I was married, and life was good.

749
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:47,706
Yeah. It seems like
forever ago now, but...

750
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:50,487
One day, a bad storm rolled in.

751
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:55,379
Bessy and I were in the meadow
and we found a place on high ground.

752
00:55:56,722 --> 00:55:58,448
But when we went home,

753
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:03,628
well, everyone was gone.

754
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:08,712
You know what I think?

755
00:56:08,808 --> 00:56:11,589
I think some good things are gonna
start happening to you and me.

756
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:16,524
What, do you wanna be a hero, cow?

757
00:57:30,816 --> 00:57:33,214
Hey, you're Ben's kid.

758
00:57:33,981 --> 00:57:35,420
Otis, right?

759
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:38,875
So they left you in charge?

760
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,806
Oh, that's precious.

761
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:46,932
You thought you could fill his shoes?

762
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:50,768
Otis, where were you?

763
00:57:51,247 --> 00:57:55,947
Were you off having fun?
Laughing with your barnyard buddies?

764
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:58,441
Yeah, you could have made a difference
had you been there for him,

765
00:57:58,538 --> 00:57:59,592
but you weren't. Were you?

766
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:04,676
Okay, from here on out,
this is the way it's gonna work.

767
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:08,800
We show up, you look the other way.

768
00:58:09,183 --> 00:58:11,678
A few animals missing here and there.

769
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:14,555
Hey, it's the natural order of things.

770
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:17,050
It'll be our little secret.

771
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:20,119
Oh, and Ben's kid,

772
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:23,668
if you should think about getting
a sudden burst of courage,

773
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:26,161
we slaughter every animal in sight.

774
00:58:26,257 --> 00:58:29,231
Now, you go back,
make everyone feel all safe,

775
00:58:29,326 --> 00:58:32,588
and we'll be seeing you tomorrow night.
That's a date.

776
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,329
See you around.

777
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:40,644
"Round." You're fat.

778
00:59:42,031 --> 00:59:43,278
Hey, Pop.

779
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:46,827
I wanted to come by and...

780
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,582
Look, you were just a great dad.

781
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,418
You see, I...

782
00:59:56,994 --> 01:00:01,311
I don't know what I was thinking,
but, for a minute, I actually thought

783
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,229
I could take your place.

784
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:06,490
But those coyotes?

785
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,710
I mean, you'd have stood up to them
and you wouldn't have backed down.

786
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:15,314
I gotta tell you, I was so afraid.

787
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:21,837
You know, I know I always said
that I wasn't you, and I'm not.

788
01:00:24,331 --> 01:00:25,866
But I wish I was.

789
01:00:27,784 --> 01:00:29,510
I can't do it, Pop.

790
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:31,429
I gotta go.

791
01:00:32,484 --> 01:00:33,827
I'm sorry.

792
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:45,049
And Duke will handle things,
and everything will be fine.

793
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:48,310
Wait. What are you talking about?

794
01:00:48,407 --> 01:00:50,132
Could you just not say anything?

795
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,010
Okay, I don't want to make
a big thing about this.

796
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:56,654
Hey, everybody!
Otis is leaving the barnyard!

797
01:00:57,902 --> 01:01:00,108
- What's going on?
- I don't believe it.

798
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:08,356
Oat, seriously,

799
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:12,576
I mean, you and me,
we're like best friends.

800
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:14,304
No, Pip. It's over!

801
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:18,139
I'm leaving, all right? No big whoop.
Continue your day.

802
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:20,537
Come on, Otis, we'll do what you say.

803
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:22,552
That's the point.
I don't want you to do what I say.

804
01:01:22,648 --> 01:01:24,374
I don't want any of you
to have to listen to me.

805
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:26,197
Don't listen to him!

806
01:01:26,964 --> 01:01:28,787
Stop doing what I say!

807
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:34,637
Okay, so what you're saying is,
you'll stay if we don't do what you say.

808
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,885
Dead bee.

809
01:01:36,268 --> 01:01:37,516
Thanks.

810
01:01:38,571 --> 01:01:40,010
Again, alive.

811
01:01:40,106 --> 01:01:42,408
Duke, you're in charge.
Get the dogs together.

812
01:01:42,504 --> 01:01:44,518
You guys can handle things
better than I ever could.

813
01:01:44,614 --> 01:01:46,245
Sure, Otis. If you say.

814
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:49,122
I've got my own life to lead, all right?
I don't belong here anymore.

815
01:02:09,552 --> 01:02:11,758
- Hi.
- Hey.

816
01:02:13,005 --> 01:02:16,842
What happened, Otis?
Oh, please don't say, "Nothing."

817
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:19,911
Look, it's complicated.

818
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:23,461
If you're hurting, let me help.
I'd like to help.

819
01:02:25,763 --> 01:02:28,256
You know what happened?
I froze. Okay?

820
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:32,861
Last night, I didn't run the coyotes off.
I couldn't do anything.

821
01:02:33,819 --> 01:02:36,985
They're gonna come back tonight,
and I can't protect anyone.

822
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:41,492
Everyone here, they all trust me.
And I can't protect a single one of them.

823
01:02:43,027 --> 01:02:46,384
Otis, the best leader
isn't the biggest or the strongest.

824
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:49,742
The best leader is the one
who cares the most.

825
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:54,058
Yeah, that's a nice thought, Daisy.
That's a really nice thought.

826
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:59,046
I'll tell you one thing.
I am really going to miss Bessy.

827
01:03:04,704 --> 01:03:07,869
Okay. If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

828
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:10,940
But I just want you to know one thing.

829
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:14,775
Even if you do leave, I believe in you.

830
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,491
Otis! Otis!

831
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,028
All right, Peck, take it easy.
What's the matter?

832
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:40,865
They took... We got to... Come on!

833
01:03:43,743 --> 01:03:45,372
I found him, guys!

834
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:49,881
Otis, the coyotes. It just happened.

835
01:03:49,977 --> 01:03:53,334
They took Etta, Hanna,
maybe six, seven others, I don't know.

836
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,637
They've never come
during the day before.

837
01:03:55,828 --> 01:03:58,130
They knew I wouldn't be
expecting them until tonight.

838
01:03:58,226 --> 01:03:59,472
They played me.

839
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:01,008
- What?
- Nothing.

840
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:04,077
Otis, they took Maddie.

841
01:04:08,968 --> 01:04:10,887
Those coyotes are strong.

842
01:04:13,189 --> 01:04:14,340
What?

843
01:04:14,436 --> 01:04:16,738
The coyotes, they're strong.

844
01:04:17,793 --> 01:04:21,342
I was just wondering
what a stronger man might do.

845
01:04:40,812 --> 01:04:43,403
- You'll look after things?
- Be proud to.

846
01:04:44,937 --> 01:04:46,281
I'll be back.

847
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:03,928
- I'm going, too.
- No, Pip, stay here.

848
01:05:04,024 --> 01:05:06,422
You can't do this alone.
They could kill you.

849
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:08,438
Yeah, I guess they could.

850
01:05:47,284 --> 01:05:50,545
It's nice that you ladies
could join us this evening.

851
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:54,765
Thank you for being so patient.
We prefer dining at night.

852
01:06:00,713 --> 01:06:02,823
You're a wonderful species.

853
01:06:03,303 --> 01:06:07,523
I love chicken.
My favorite part is the skin.

854
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:09,249
You're a big meanie.

855
01:06:09,345 --> 01:06:11,359
- What?
- You're a meaner.

856
01:06:11,455 --> 01:06:15,387
Meaner, meaner.
Meaners got to eat, too.

857
01:06:15,483 --> 01:06:17,019
Leave her alone.

858
01:06:17,785 --> 01:06:19,128
This one's mine.

859
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:21,910
Cook her while I have the little one
for an appetizer.

860
01:06:22,006 --> 01:06:24,308
You know, because I'm a meaner.

861
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:31,789
Put the chick down, Dag.

862
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:38,984
- Otis!
- Oaty!

863
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:43,780
We suddenly got a burst of courage,
did we?

864
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,218
Okay. All right.

865
01:06:45,314 --> 01:06:48,766
Well, first, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take that chick from you.

866
01:06:48,862 --> 01:06:51,452
Then, while you're picking yourself
up off the ground,

867
01:06:51,548 --> 01:06:54,810
I'm gonna gather up the hens
and I'm gonna leave.

868
01:06:54,905 --> 01:06:57,879
And exactly how do you propose
you're going to do that?

869
01:07:05,743 --> 01:07:06,992
Kill him!

870
01:07:07,183 --> 01:07:10,156
<i>Well, I know what's right</i>

871
01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:14,185
<i>I got just one life</i>

872
01:07:15,336 --> 01:07:19,557
<i>In a world that keeps on</i>
<i>pushing me around</i>

873
01:07:19,652 --> 01:07:22,625
<i>But I'll stand my ground</i>

874
01:07:23,584 --> 01:07:26,751
<i>And I won't back down</i>

875
01:07:28,189 --> 01:07:30,875
<i>Hey, baby</i>

876
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,999
<i>There ain't no easy way out</i>

877
01:07:36,437 --> 01:07:38,548
<i>Hey</i>

878
01:07:38,644 --> 01:07:43,152
<i>I will stand my ground</i>

879
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:47,372
<i>And I won't back down</i>

880
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:49,674
Oh, you like that, yeah?

881
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,910
That should do. That should do.

882
01:08:05,116 --> 01:08:08,281
Well, look at the hero.

883
01:08:09,145 --> 01:08:11,927
You thought you could come
into my den?

884
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,763
Now, why don't you lay there and watch

885
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:18,353
while we eat your friends?

886
01:08:31,206 --> 01:08:32,740
What's this?

887
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:37,057
A strong man stands up for himself.

888
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,469
A stronger man stands up for others.

889
01:08:43,771 --> 01:08:45,498
This should be fun.

890
01:08:54,418 --> 01:08:56,144
I smell fear.

891
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,021
Shoot! I told you they can smell it!

892
01:08:59,118 --> 01:09:00,652
They can smell it?

893
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:04,586
Oh, yeah, I have it. I have a lot of it.

894
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,174
Just stick near me, guys,
and you'll be all right.

895
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,764
Yeah, I'll watch your juicy back.

896
01:09:10,148 --> 01:09:11,683
I mean, your regular back.

897
01:09:13,793 --> 01:09:15,519
- Hey!
- Sorry, man.

898
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:18,013
They're just pellets. I'm nervous.

899
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:20,507
That's your army?

900
01:09:25,878 --> 01:09:29,619
Something tells me you may want
to take a couple steps back.

901
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,430
Here we come!

902
01:09:36,526 --> 01:09:37,870
- Here comes trou...
- Ble!

903
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:39,212
- Trou...
- Ble!

904
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,650
- Trou...
- Ble!

905
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:53,695
Pip, talk me into it. Talk me into it.

906
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:56,093
Flip the lid a little bit.
You're mad! You're a pig!

907
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:58,204
- You're mad!
- Let's do this!

908
01:10:08,562 --> 01:10:12,111
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go right in your ear!

909
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:16,907
There's a mouse in my ear!
There's a mouse in my ear!

910
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:20,265
Oh, yeah. Step on it, baby!

911
01:10:25,827 --> 01:10:29,568
All right, come on.
Give me your best shot.

912
01:10:29,664 --> 01:10:32,637
Oh, sorry. Here. You know what?
Let me give you a hand.

913
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:35,707
Yeah, give him the puncher!
Smack him!

914
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:05,153
Well, well, whatever will I do?

915
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:13,307
Oh, don't worry,
I got something special for you.

916
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:33,928
I just love that little guy.

917
01:11:34,024 --> 01:11:35,463
Come on, hurry.

918
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,697
- No!
- Hi!

919
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,493
It tastes like chicken!

920
01:11:47,164 --> 01:11:48,220
Chicken!

921
01:11:48,315 --> 01:11:49,946
Chick, chick, chickity-chick, chicken!

922
01:11:50,042 --> 01:11:53,015
Come here,
you furry, four-legged chickens!

923
01:11:56,756 --> 01:11:58,387
Take it easy, man.

924
01:11:58,483 --> 01:12:01,264
Come on, what you got going?
There's nothing there.

925
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:11,623
Hey, Otis, look out!

926
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,638
- Behind you!
- Watch out!

927
01:12:16,611 --> 01:12:18,145
Watch out!

928
01:12:22,845 --> 01:12:24,285
Look behind you.

929
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:31,959
Remember me?

930
01:12:32,437 --> 01:12:33,876
I'm Ben's kid.

931
01:12:46,728 --> 01:12:49,414
Never come back!

932
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:55,073
- Pip?
- I'd have to go with the iron, man.

933
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:13,585
Then I said
I was gonna hit him with a stick.

934
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:16,176
We know. We know.
I heard you say that.

935
01:13:16,463 --> 01:13:17,805
Quite a night, huh?

936
01:13:17,902 --> 01:13:20,300
We took down the coyotes,
Peck learned to crow,

937
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,643
and by the time we get back,

938
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:23,849
we'll have a new member
of the barnyard running around.

939
01:13:24,616 --> 01:13:27,301
Daisy. She like went into labor
after you left.

940
01:13:29,028 --> 01:13:30,947
- Daisy's...
- She's having her baby, dude.

941
01:13:31,139 --> 01:13:32,481
What you think was gonna happen?

942
01:13:32,577 --> 01:13:34,304
She would just keep getting
bigger or something?

943
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,086
- Is she all right? We've gotta get back.
- Yeah.

944
01:13:37,182 --> 01:13:39,580
Doubtful we'll make it
back in time walking.

945
01:13:39,676 --> 01:13:41,882
I'm sure she's gonna be all right, Otis.

946
01:13:41,978 --> 01:13:44,471
Miles, I've got to be there.

947
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:52,145
Please remember, mister,
that I am a lady.

948
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:55,310
When you are with me,
your eyes are on me, not her.

949
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,025
We can call and tell them
where to pick them up.

950
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:23,126
Car!

951
01:14:26,866 --> 01:14:28,786
Righteous!

952
01:14:44,227 --> 01:14:45,379
Duke, what's happening?

953
01:14:45,476 --> 01:14:49,503
Otis, come on. You know, I think...
I'm pretty sure... Yeah, it's time.

954
01:14:57,177 --> 01:14:58,231
Boy.

955
01:15:24,033 --> 01:15:27,102
Otis, I was so worried.

956
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,173
Worried about what?
I so had that covered.

957
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:32,666
It's okay, I'm here.

958
01:15:35,256 --> 01:15:37,942
And I'm here for you, too.

959
01:15:39,956 --> 01:15:43,313
Okay, girl, you're doing fine.
Now, just breathe.

960
01:16:13,622 --> 01:16:15,541
Man, that looks like it hurts.

961
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:18,131
Oh, that's very profound, Insight-Man.

962
01:16:18,226 --> 01:16:20,240
Well, excuse me for being a pig.

963
01:16:20,337 --> 01:16:22,255
How come nothing's happened yet?

964
01:16:22,351 --> 01:16:24,557
She's gonna be all right, though, huh?

965
01:16:24,653 --> 01:16:27,626
Yeah, like, like...
What if it gets stuck or something?

966
01:16:27,722 --> 01:16:31,846
What? You mean like stuck halfway,
so she'd be a cow and a half?

967
01:16:31,942 --> 01:16:33,764
I didn't say "cow and a half."

968
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,396
Yes, you did. You just did.

969
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:39,329
- Hey, Duke, did I say "Cow and a half"?
- I'm not doing this.

970
01:16:39,616 --> 01:16:40,958
No, look.

971
01:16:46,425 --> 01:16:48,920
It's a beautiful little boy.

972
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:53,428
Go ahead.

973
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:02,060
He's perfect.

974
01:17:03,403 --> 01:17:05,610
What are you gonna name him?

975
01:17:06,089 --> 01:17:08,583
I was thinking I kind of like

976
01:17:10,309 --> 01:17:11,363
Ben.

977
01:17:17,311 --> 01:17:19,229
Oh, I think that's just great.

978
01:17:20,284 --> 01:17:22,107
Hey, there, little Ben.

979
01:17:24,697 --> 01:17:27,862
Hey, there, little buddy. Look at you.

980
01:17:29,013 --> 01:17:30,931
Look at my little buddy.

981
01:17:31,988 --> 01:17:33,234
Here you go.

982
01:17:45,032 --> 01:17:46,471
Hey, Otis, we were all talking,

983
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,157
and we know you may have
other plans, we understand that,

984
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:52,130
but we really, really appreciate
what you did around here.

985
01:17:52,225 --> 01:17:54,335
And, well, we were wondering,
I don't know,

986
01:17:54,431 --> 01:17:56,925
if maybe you planned
on staying around a little longer?

987
01:17:57,021 --> 01:17:59,419
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

988
01:17:59,611 --> 01:18:01,242
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

989
01:18:02,393 --> 01:18:04,982
<i>To take another's hand</i>

990
01:18:06,421 --> 01:18:08,052
I'll just say this,

991
01:18:08,148 --> 01:18:09,874
as long as I'm still kicking,

992
01:18:09,971 --> 01:18:13,998
no animal will be harmed
inside that fence.

993
01:18:20,713 --> 01:18:21,863
High paw!

994
01:18:23,207 --> 01:18:24,646
Hey, all right.

995
01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:32,128
<i>Freedom is a song</i>

996
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,005
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

997
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,594
<i>For people who are strong</i>

998
01:18:37,978 --> 01:18:40,183
<i>Freedom is a spirit</i>

999
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:43,253
<i>Freedom is a land</i>

1000
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:46,131
<i>Freedom is the courage</i>

1001
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:48,433
<i>To take another's hand</i>

1002
01:19:10,014 --> 01:19:13,275
I, Nora Beady, am a precious object

1003
01:19:13,371 --> 01:19:15,865
and shall treat myself as such.

1004
01:19:17,442 --> 01:19:22,292
Gosh, I wonder why...
I forgot to use conditioner, or...

1005
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:25,000
Or...or...
