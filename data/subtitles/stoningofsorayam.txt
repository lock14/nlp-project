00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.467
Do not be like a hypocrite,

2
00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.828
Who thinks he can hide their tricks

3
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:21.288
Over the loud chanting of the Koran

Stoning of Soraya M.

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:40.513

Kupayeh, Iran

12
00:06:42.526 --> 00:06:44,128
Stop here.

13
00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:50.518
Could you please help me?

14
00:07:02.452 --> 00:07:05.495
This radiator. Overheated.

15
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.059
Road heavy for them.

16
00:07:10.185 --> 00:07:13.092
Watch the car tomorrow.

17
00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.498
Listen, I need to get to the border at night.

18
00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:19.917
I'll pay you over.

19
00:07:20.108 --> 00:07:22.330
It is not a question of money.
I do not work today.

20
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.697
How Come?

21
00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:26.212
I'm tired.

22
00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:39.815
Watch later.
See what I can do.

23
00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:44.181
Just take me to the border.

24
00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:47.185
Yes I Am. To the border. I got it.

25
00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:50.032
I'll fix, if I can.

26
00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:54.228
Yonder Cafe?

27
00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:55.834
Yeah, up there.

28
00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:57.997
Thank U.

29
00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:01.770
I speak in English.

30
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.028
You say in English?

31
00:08:05.462 --> 00:08:06.903
I have to talk fast.

32
00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:10.518
In this village there is such,
what you do not know.

33
00:08:10.584 --> 00:08:12.919
They can not get away with it ...

34
00:08:13.272 --> 00:08:14.787
these devils.

35
00:08:16.342 --> 00:08:18.871
Do not pay attention to her.
It is old and sick.

36
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.092
These are your ancestors are old and sick.

37
00:08:21.127 --> 00:08:23.511
Despicable woman.
Now talk to strange men?

38
00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:25.353
Go Away! Be hid from our eyes!

39
00:08:25.957 --> 00:08:27.284
Go away!

40
00:08:32.827 --> 00:08:34.570
Sir, as the head of the village,

41
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:36.572
I welcome you.

42
00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:40.408
I and Sheikh Hassan, our mullah, would
to share with you our breakfast.

43
00:08:41.257 --> 00:08:45.405
As a representative of the authorities, I have
welcome guests of the village.

44
00:08:47.262 --> 00:08:51.707
Thanks, but I'm only here for those
to my car repaired.

45
00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:53.323
And I need to work on.

46
00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:57.996
And what kind of work?

47
00:08:59.931 --> 00:09:02.761
Just paperwork.

48
00:09:03.024 --> 00:09:04.357
A paper work.

49
00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:07.347
You accountant?

50
00:09:09.609 --> 00:09:10.885
Journalist.

51
00:09:13.213 --> 00:09:15.886
Your accent ... Where is he?

52
00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:21.075
I'm going back to France.
I live there.

53
00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:25.893
Our Ayatollah,
blessed Imam Khomeini

54
00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:28.198
visited in France.

55
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30.941
His well received there.

56
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34.340
Of course you have to eat. Come on!

57
00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:38.265
I am grateful to you, but no thank you.

58
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:42.504
Then, maybe, tea?

59
00:09:43.811 --> 00:09:45.451
Maybe another time.

60
00:11:56.767 --> 00:11:58.067
You saw someone?

61
00:12:00.683 --> 00:12:02.112
What is it?

62
00:12:02.854 --> 00:12:05.204
Are you fine. I love you, girl.

63
00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:08.897
Come on. Look. He is our guest.

64
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.886
I'll make him tea while you play.

65
00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:15.665
Come on, my dear girl.

66
00:12:16.632 --> 00:12:18.248
Do not worry. I'm here.

67
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:24.714
Sorry them. They have been through so much.

68
00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:26.073
Yours?

69
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.810
They daughter of my niece.

70
00:12:29.796 --> 00:12:30.751
Soraya.

71
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33.612
I Zahra.

72
00:12:35.382 --> 00:12:36.468
Zahra.

73
00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.946
Zahra,

74
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:43.918
Are you crazy?

75
00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:46.506
They think so.

76
00:12:48.544 --> 00:12:49.446
And then ...

77
00:12:49.689 --> 00:12:53.352
and invite a stranger into your home ...

78
00:12:54.802 --> 00:12:56.346
I tend to agree.

79
00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:00.695
Sit down, please.

80
00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.439
I'll pour you tea ...

81
00:13:06.213 --> 00:13:08.464
and then you decide who is crazy:

82
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.787
me or them.

83
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.467
Do you smoke?

84
00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:38.208
Ayatollah does not prohibit women from smoking?

85
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:47.697
Today I am old ...

86
00:13:48.838 --> 00:13:51.749
a hundred years older than yesterday.

87
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:55.915
But I can tell right from wrong.

88
00:13:56.727 --> 00:13:59.074
What happened here yesterday,

89
00:13:59.503 --> 00:14:00.717
was wrong.

90
00:14:02.173 --> 00:14:03.547
Yesterday.

91
00:14:06.696 --> 00:14:10.233
The Devil himself visited the site ...

92
00:14:13.882 --> 00:14:16.458
Allah the Merciful and knows it.

93
00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:20.009
God willing, and you know it too.

94
00:14:24.598 --> 00:14:26.163
Turn on your machine.

95
00:14:27.026 --> 00:14:29.985
Voices of women are not taken into account here.

96
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.432
I want you to take my voice with them.

97
00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:47.539
Why should I listen to you,

98
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.586
If, as you say ...

99
00:14:50.086 --> 00:14:53.893
voices of women anywhere in this country
are not taken into account.

100
00:14:54.652 --> 00:14:56.719
First, listen to my story.

101
00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:59.195
You'll learn why you should listen to.

102
00:15:10.763 --> 00:15:12.720
At this point, there are men,

103
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:15.195
that - wild dogs.

104
00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:19.115
Their hunt began not so long ago,

105
00:15:19.865 --> 00:15:21.974
Soraya with her husband ...

106
00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:23.399
Ali.

107
00:15:23.731 --> 00:15:26.269
Soraya agree, when you realize
it's good for her.

108
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.136
Yes, but women can be stubborn.
You ought to know this about his wife.

109
00:15:32.063 --> 00:15:33.189
You have to convince her.

110
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.789
God willing.

111
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.638
No! Convince her. She has no choice.

112
00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:37.895
God willing.

113
00:15:38.744 --> 00:15:40.190
Do not tell me this is your "God willing."

114
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.704
You're no more mullah than I am.

115
00:15:45.751 --> 00:15:49.385
I have proof of your prison of the past.

116
00:15:53.405 --> 00:15:57.008
You, those who committed a crime in the reign of the Shah,
now free ...

117
00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:00.984
... but we will not forgive the crimes in the future.

118
00:16:05.243 --> 00:16:06.235
Are you threatening me?

119
00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:08.042
Just remember ...

120
00:16:09.683 --> 00:16:10.872
who knows about you the truth.

121
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19.315
We are with you at the same time.

122
00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:23.650
But that thinks Soraya, I'm unsure.

123
00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:25.460
So influenced on it.

124
00:16:25.616 --> 00:16:26.899
Convince her.

125
00:16:47.922 --> 00:16:49.240
Look who's talking.

126
00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:51.275
Our "holy" Mullah.

127
00:17:00.409 --> 00:17:02.576
Peace to you, woman.

128
00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:16.489
Soraya?

129
00:17:19.113 --> 00:17:20.933
How are you?

130
00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:23.117
Ali does not.

131
00:17:28.864 --> 00:17:30.558
I want to talk to you.

132
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:34.230
What a beautiful girl.

133
00:17:54.396 --> 00:17:56.747
Ali, you complain.

134
00:17:57.669 --> 00:18:00.235
He says that you do not talk to him ...

135
00:18:00.236 --> 00:18:02.603
ignore it ...

136
00:18:02.604 --> 00:18:05.049
completely abandoned it.

137
00:18:05.104 --> 00:18:06.983
He is your husband.

138
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:10.232
He has every right, you know.

139
00:18:10.491 --> 00:18:11.721
All right.

140
00:18:11,968 --> 00:18:14.114
You can not him in anything to deny.

141
00:18:15.273 --> 00:18:20.874
Ali, my husband for 20 years,
set up our sons with him against me.

142
00:18:24.142 --> 00:18:28.630
He met a woman whom he wanted to marry,
but he can not have two wives.

143
00:18:32.043 --> 00:18:37.695
He will give you a house, furniture, girls ...

144
00:18:37.696 --> 00:18:42.948
and some land for cultivation.

145
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.165
However, the more he will not give you any of the material.

146
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:49.045
This tiny little house and rocky ground
not be able to provide me and daughters.

147
00:18:49.189 --> 00:18:50.785
His proposal - generous.

148
00:18:56.065 --> 00:18:58.696
Something else.

149
00:18:58.894 --> 00:19:02.968
With Ali's nothing you can do.

150
00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:09.943
I will provide you and your daughters.

151
00:19:11.994 --> 00:19:13.317
With all due respect, of course.

152
00:19:14.288 --> 00:19:16.928
I will visit you ...

153
00:19:16.929 --> 00:19:20.586
and we can get to know each other better.

154
00:19:24.041 --> 00:19:25.860
After some time ...

155
00:19:26.569 --> 00:19:28.782
you know this word - sigheh ...

156
00:19:28.784 --> 00:19:31.724
temporary wife.

157
00:19:33.448 --> 00:19:36.974
Fully sanctioned by Islam.

158
00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:38.499
Get Out!

159
00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:42.012
What is it? This is a private conversation.

160
00:19:42.042 --> 00:19:44.361
Leave this house right now ...

161
00:19:44.362 --> 00:19:48.502
Sheikh Hassan Mullah, whoever you was ...

162
00:19:48.603 --> 00:19:50.546
or I'll pick up the entire village.

163
00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:52.144
You should be ashamed of yourself.

164
00:19:52.244 --> 00:19:56.575
You dishonor the Holy Book, which you wear.

165
00:19:56.656 --> 00:19:58.724
Zahra, you misunderstand.

166
00:19:58.792 --> 00:20:01.008
I respect Soraya.

167
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.053
I came ...

168
00:20:04.054 --> 00:20:06.092
with pure intentions.

169
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.713
The only thing clear - this is your lust.

170
00:20:08.063 --> 00:20:10.016
Sigheh ... holy whore?

171
00:20:10.434 --> 00:20:11.859
How dare you?

172
00:20:11.957 --> 00:20:14.207
Let God's fury spilled on you rain.

173
00:20:14.461 --> 00:20:18.547
Let the undertaker will take you and your three generations.
Get Out!

174
00:20:20.024 --> 00:20:21.027
You witch.

175
00:20:21.937 --> 00:20:24.916
Your poison will return back to you and poison you.

176
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.113
And you, too.

177
00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:30.134
Wait and see.

178
00:20:31.406 --> 00:20:32.618
You will see both.

179
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:41.805
What happened to your marriage?

180
00:20:42.034 --> 00:20:44.019
Ali still admires prostitutes?

181
00:20:44.607 --> 00:20:45.995
Who is this other woman?

182
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.096
You're sleeping with him?

183
00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:52.343
You give him what should?

184
00:20:53.672 --> 00:20:55.436
Goes the rumor that will not let.

185
00:20:58.693 --> 00:20:59.529
Answer me.

186
00:21:12.562 --> 00:21:14.073
He takes what I owe him.

187
00:21:15.683 --> 00:21:17.835
I have nothing left to give.

188
00:21:21.492 --> 00:21:23.309
Divorce.

189
00:21:23.764 --> 00:21:25.865
Give him his.

190
00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:29.663
And be sigheh Hassan,
and my children will starve?

191
00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:31.399
No, I can not do that.

192
00:21:40.853 --> 00:21:42.950
This girl from the city. Who is she?

193
00:21:44.178 --> 00:21:45.284
Mehri.

194
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:48.319
Her name Mehri.

195
00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:57.994
She is 14 ...

196
00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:00.896
burning eyes.

197
00:22:12.557 --> 00:22:14.061
Her father - a doctor.

198
00:22:14.062 --> 00:22:15.816
He has money. He was hanged.

199
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.017
Ali promised to help him.

200
00:22:27.694 --> 00:22:29.234
In exchange for a daughter?

201
00:22:29.235 --> 00:22:31.274
I'm sure they have everything agreed.

202
00:22:42.879 --> 00:22:44.215
death

203
00:22:45.807 --> 00:22:47.523
How do you know?

204
00:22:47.774 --> 00:22:49.493
He boasts of his sons ...

205
00:22:49.494 --> 00:22:52.438
as if they should admire them for that.

206
00:23:01.053 --> 00:23:03.773
They plan everything - Ali and the mullah.

207
00:23:03.774 --> 00:23:05.873
We have to keep an eye on all of this.

208
00:23:32.839 --> 00:23:34.728
You shamed me, woman.

209
00:23:35.605 --> 00:23:36.647
In my own home.

210
00:23:37.866 --> 00:23:40.225
Before the man of God!

211
00:23:40.226 --> 00:23:42.832
I ridicule, an object of ridicule.

212
00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:44.460
How dare you?

213
00:23:44.461 --> 00:23:46.045
How dare you?

214
00:23:52.891 --> 00:23:54.693
Let her be quiet.

215
00:23:57.593 --> 00:24:01.608
Mullah Hassan came here today to offer ...

216
00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:05.246
divorce for your mother,
and she refused.

217
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.956
The woman did not put meat on the table.

218
00:24:09.957 --> 00:24:10.811
You're not giving me money.

219
00:24:11.353 --> 00:24:12.944
I can not make the meat with rice.

220
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15.066
In Mehri on the table always eat meat.

221
00:24:15.534 --> 00:24:16.675
And even more than that.

222
00:24:17.962 --> 00:24:19.872
She knows how to be a wife.

223
00:24:19.873 --> 00:24:21.066
Not to speak about it.

224
00:24:24.288 --> 00:24:26.979
We could move to the city,
closer to my work.

225
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.086
You could be the guards of the revolutionary regime.

226
00:24:29.087 --> 00:24:30.613
Enough.

227
00:24:33.442 --> 00:24:34.979
Father, we go with you?

228
00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.475
Of Course. Here you have nothing.

229
00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:42.385
But this woman does not want to see her husband
and sons happy.

230
00:24:42.387 --> 00:24:44.387
Why will not you let us go?

231
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.278
Only boys?

232
00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:48.594
What about our daughters?

233
00:24:49.718 --> 00:24:52.067
I do not want my children to go hungry.

234
00:24:54.082 --> 00:24:55.448
You have responsibilities.

235
00:24:56.479 --> 00:25:00.484
As her husband. As a father. According to the law and before God.
You can not leave us.

236
00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:03.141
And what about me?

237
00:25:03.484 --> 00:25:04.557
Your wife!

238
00:25:08.544 --> 00:25:10.643
Your Mullah gave me a proposition.

239
00:25:12.879 --> 00:25:13.560
Yes I Am.

240
00:25:16.155 --> 00:25:17.307
As if I'm a slut.

241
00:25:19.493 --> 00:25:21,200
What have you for a husband?

242
00:25:21.235 --> 00:25:24.696
Where's your honor? Your dignity?

243
00:25:24.848 --> 00:25:26.346
Do not say that my father!

244
00:25:33.224 --> 00:25:34.398
Get.

245
00:25:41.131 --> 00:25:42.653
Get this mess.

246
00:25:48.493 --> 00:25:49.701
Well!

247
00:26:19.932 --> 00:26:22.324
You owe me for this 25 fogs.

248
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.649
This is the world of men.

249
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.701
Never forget this, guys.

250
00:26:33.335 --> 00:26:34.159
Where are you?

251
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.829
- Come on.
- Where are you?

252
00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:50.046
Do not look at me like that.

253
00:26:52.391 --> 00:26:54.083
Do not look at me!

254
00:26:58.363 --> 00:26:59.306
Where the hell are you?

255
00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:01.599
Where are you ?!

256
00:27:09.881 --> 00:27:12.117
If he wants a divorce, you will have to pay.

257
00:27:12.118 --> 00:27:14.196
He will not pay. I know him.

258
00:27:17.935 --> 00:27:19.166
I'll talk with the head of the village, Ebrahim.

259
00:27:20.285 --> 00:27:21.751
He listens to me.

260
00:27:26.072 --> 00:27:27.668
After the death of my husband ...

261
00:27:31.157 --> 00:27:33.203
he wanted to marry me.

262
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.303
When I was a child, my parents
forced me to work for a man ...

263
00:27:41.304 --> 00:27:43.869
so they do not have to feed me.

264
00:27:45.987 --> 00:27:47.693
He did with me what you want ...

265
00:27:50.031 --> 00:27:51.639
Is that not fuck.

266
00:27:57.948 --> 00:27:58.890
Do you understand what I mean.

267
00:28:00.006 --> 00:28:03.618
Neither I nor my daughter in all of this will not come back.

268
00:28:05.596 --> 00:28:07.330
So protect them.

269
00:28:07.866 --> 00:28:10.898
Do not provoke. You're on this dishonor.

270
00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:12.575
Remember that.

271
00:28:14.066 --> 00:28:15,876
Can we stay here with you?

272
00:28:16.224 --> 00:28:19.302
No. Staying here will ignite only
his reproaches neglected.

273
00:28:27.699 --> 00:28:29.908
At home, they do not sleep quietly.

274
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:38.347
You have to help me.

275
00:28:38.703 --> 00:28:39.992
- My wife.
- What happened?

276
00:28:40.392 --> 00:28:41.925
She is ill.

277
00:28:41.986 --> 00:28:44.589
The doctor went to the city,
so I ran here.

278
00:28:45.298 --> 00:28:46.366
Yes of course.

279
00:28:49.637 --> 00:28:50.704
I'll go too.

280
00:28:51.449 --> 00:28:54.650
No. Remember what we talked about.

281
00:28:54.838 --> 00:28:55.767
Come on, Hashem.

282
00:28:56.272 --> 00:28:57.277
God bless you.

283
00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:08.472
God bless you, Zahra.

284
00:29:08.878 --> 00:29:09.964
Yes, I'm glad to help.

285
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:19.309
Back!

286
00:29:23.235 --> 00:29:24.422
Hire us too!

287
00:29:26.908 --> 00:29:27.883
Can you believe it?

288
00:29:37.963 --> 00:29:39.531
Stay here.

289
00:29:41.474 --> 00:29:43.415
Zahra would do something.

290
00:29:51.129 --> 00:29:52.752
Your mother is not feeling well.

291
00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:56.112
Mohsen, stay here, son.

292
00:30:17.353 --> 00:30:18.834
She is very strong.

293
00:30:20.912 --> 00:30:24.846
She gave birth to a child after 30 years of marriage.

294
00:30:26.635 --> 00:30:28.831
Nobody thought that she could,
but she managed.

295
00:30:30.031 --> 00:30:32.956
Thanks to God, she was born Mohsen.

296
00:30:46.371 --> 00:30:48.130
Tell me what it's all right.

297
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:52.487
Hashem ...

298
00:30:54.297 --> 00:30:56.345
I have to clean up the body for burial.

299
00:30:58.382 --> 00:30:59.478
I'm so sorry.

300
00:31:02.056 --> 00:31:02.728
No!

301
00:31:04.892 --> 00:31:06.935
You know the custom.

302
00:31:06.936 --> 00:31:10.545
The body of a dead woman can not see nobody,
even her husband.

303
00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:40.301
Her body is still here.
This looting is unacceptable.

304
00:32:45.558 --> 00:32:46.902
You should be ashamed.

305
00:32:46.903 --> 00:32:48.887
For what? She can no longer use it.

306
00:32:56.043 --> 00:32:57.828
- Put your back.
- I first saw her.

307
00:32:57.829 --> 00:33:01.360
These things belong to Hashem.
They may need it.

308
00:33:01.436 --> 00:33:02.993
Sewing machine?

309
00:33:03.296 --> 00:33:04.677
Yes, he does not know what the needle!

310
00:33:04.765 --> 00:33:05.986
I said, put it back.

311
00:33:06.076 --> 00:33:07.544
His wife died. And he's still alive.

312
00:33:09.297 --> 00:33:10.580
To do their work.

313
00:33:12,196 --> 00:33:12.742
Zahra!

314
00:33:13.062 --> 00:33:15.097
- Yes I Do?
- Come here!

315
00:33:23.811 --> 00:33:24.499
Zahra ...

316
00:33:26.422 --> 00:33:30.466
Hashem told us how you were good
to him and his dear wife last night.

317
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31.567
We are grateful.

318
00:33:32.096 --> 00:33:34.536
It should be taken to hospital.

319
00:33:34.537 --> 00:33:35.899
Someone could take her there.

320
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:39.805
For example, you, Ali.
In this your luxury car.

321
00:33:39.997 --> 00:33:41.819
But there are more important for you to passengers.

322
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.666
Not now, Zahra.

323
00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.074
All this does not matter.

324
00:33:45.413 --> 00:33:48.982
This is a time of trouble, and we worry about Hashem.

325
00:33:48.983 --> 00:33:51.055
Its not even buried.

326
00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.142
I did not want.

327
00:34:01.176 --> 00:34:05.557
Zahra, Hashem will not be able to cope alone.
Cooking, cleaning and Mohsen ...

328
00:34:06.646 --> 00:34:10,950
Such a boy without a mother,
take care of it quite hard.

329
00:34:13.942 --> 00:34:15.811
Could you talk to Soraya?

330
00:34:15.927 --> 00:34:18.592
We thought it might help him ...

331
00:34:18.593 --> 00:34:21.734
when she cope with her chores around the house.

332
00:34:21.907 --> 00:34:26.453
As a community, we care about each other.

333
00:34:31.093 --> 00:34:32.321
Oh, that's so, then how?

334
00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:35.448
You care, and it does all the work.

335
00:34:35.672 --> 00:34:36.740
Talk to her yourself.

336
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.794
Zahra, she will perceive better
if it is going to come from you.

337
00:34:51.184 --> 00:34:54.504
She perceive better if you ask her to pay.

338
00:34:57.788 --> 00:34:58.876
Of Course.

339
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.148
Naturally, it will be paid.

340
00:35:02.149 --> 00:35:04.865
That will be better, and it should be a good payment.

341
00:35:04.866 --> 00:35:06.395
And this will be her money.

342
00:35:06.396 --> 00:35:07.693
Her one.

343
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:09.081
Okay. What else?

344
00:35:10.026 --> 00:35:11.317
Her one.

345
00:35:11.319 --> 00:35:14.631
Any food or gasoline,
nor your women.

346
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20.417
You're sharp-tongued witch.

347
00:35:20.418 --> 00:35:22.837
Ali is good in shock, I guess.

348
00:35:24.174 --> 00:35:25.408
Enough! With this decided.

349
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.254
Soraya will work on Hashem.

350
00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:36.949
You go too far.

351
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.987
This is not like the old days.

352
00:35:38.988 --> 00:35:41.829
Shah was no more.

353
00:35:41.972 --> 00:35:43.838
How well I understand that.

354
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.869
I warn you as a friend.

355
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.452
Hold your tongue.

356
00:35:48.569 --> 00:35:50.026
Cooperate with them.

357
00:35:51.093 --> 00:35:53.263
Respect them.

358
00:35:54.269 --> 00:35:55.422
Give them what they want.

359
00:36:05.654 --> 00:36:07.835
This is exactly what you do, Ebrahim, is not it?

360
00:36:08.923 --> 00:36:10,378
But at what cost?

361
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12.146
You thought about it?

362
00:36:19.462 --> 00:36:21.488
You stopped them when they were examining her things.

363
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:23.115
God bless you.

364
00:36:23.128 --> 00:36:25.432
She spoke of you as a good friend.

365
00:36:35.458 --> 00:36:37.130
Put it somewhere safe.

366
00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:17.752
Mohsen, where are you?

367
00:37:18.664 --> 00:37:20.095
Give Soraya leave.

368
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24.132
You will return to cook dinner?

369
00:37:24.133 --> 00:37:26.882
Do not worry. I'll be back.

370
00:37:27.015 --> 00:37:28.875
- Okay.
- Okay.

371
00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:01.638
Stand still.

372
00:38:03.145 --> 00:38:04.838
This is ridiculous.

373
00:38:05.466 --> 00:38:08.502
I do not need a new skirt.

374
00:38:08.503 --> 00:38:10.673
You could make it to the one who will pay.

375
00:38:10.674 --> 00:38:12.874
Hashem said that I can do with fabric
whatever I want.

376
00:38:12.875 --> 00:38:14,172
I ride for you.

377
00:38:14.788 --> 00:38:15.704
Turn Around.

378
00:38:19.377 --> 00:38:21.542
Hashem is well with you drawn?

379
00:38:21.544 --> 00:38:23.653
It's boring, but nice.

380
00:38:24.791 --> 00:38:25.697
God bless him.

381
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.083
In fact, ...

382
00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:37.996
Could you keep it for me?

383
00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:44.061
This is what I have earned a long time.
Each Rial.

384
00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:47.126
I want to keep them safe,
in case ...

385
00:38:47.623 --> 00:38:49.483
If a pig is hungry?

386
00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:53.706
This is the beginning.

387
00:38:55.746 --> 00:38:57.077
Your chance to get away.

388
00:38:58.842 --> 00:38:59.669
Good For You.

389
00:39:04.932 --> 00:39:05.826
Beautiful.

390
00:39:05.828 --> 00:39:07.297
I look like a real lady.

391
00:39:09.296 --> 00:39:10.668
Thank you very much.

392
00:39:11.424 --> 00:39:12.522
She's beautiful.

393
00:39:25.106 --> 00:39:27.967
Okay, guys, well done.

394
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:33.181
When we go into the city, Father?

395
00:39:35.355 --> 00:39:36.137
Coming Soon.

396
00:39:43.769 --> 00:39:44.681
Thank you, boss.

397
00:39:50.163 --> 00:39:51.131
Thank you, boss.

398
00:39:51.132 --> 00:39:53.663
What about Mom and the girls?

399
00:39:54.567 --> 00:39:55.540
No problem.

400
00:39:56.417 --> 00:39:57.881
I'll take care of everything.

401
00:40:01.181 --> 00:40:02.209
Go home.

402
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:16.605
I think between Soraya and Hashemi something there.

403
00:40:16.636 --> 00:40:20.925
Soraya? She is not the type.

404
00:40:22.008 --> 00:40:24,266
How do you know?

405
00:40:26.305 --> 00:40:28.557
It works in his home ...

406
00:40:29.974 --> 00:40:33.884
he is a widower ...
they spend a lot of time alone ...

407
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:35.911
What are you talking about?

408
00:40:36.161 --> 00:40:38.939
Treason is punishable by stoning.

409
00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.529
That you want?

410
00:40:44.376 --> 00:40:47.152
If she dies, I will not have to
keep it, right?

411
00:40:47.153 --> 00:40:51.175
But she now earns money.
After some time, it will give you a divorce.

412
00:40:51.217 --> 00:40:52.777
Why so extreme?

413
00:40:52.778 --> 00:40:55.376
Because I can not wait!

414
00:40:55.577 --> 00:40:57.628
Who are you to be so right?

415
00:40:58.102 --> 00:41:00.651
I know the facts about you.

416
00:41:00.794 --> 00:41:03.477
One word - and that you stoned.

417
00:41:03.478 --> 00:41:05.081
But we will have to convince Ebrahim.

418
00:41:05.083 --> 00:41:08.363
He wants the evidence of witnesses.

419
00:41:08.479 --> 00:41:10.340
He has long known Soraya.

420
00:41:10.341 --> 00:41:11.496
I am a witness.

421
00:41:13.161 --> 00:41:14.278
Why do not you be a witness?

422
00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:17.882
I can not. The head of the village and I must
preside.

423
00:41:17.955 --> 00:41:19,220
You need someone else.

424
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20.754
Let us find someone.

425
00:41:20.875 --> 00:41:24.042
First, raise the noise in a factory ...

426
00:41:24.043 --> 00:41:26.305
... this shitty town.

427
00:41:54.854 --> 00:41:56.066
Good morning, Zahra.

428
00:41:57.042 --> 00:41:58.106
I am at your service.

429
00:42:01.909 --> 00:42:03.488
The new skirt?

430
00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:06.708
It looks like the fabric that I have seen in Hashem.

431
00:42:08.314 --> 00:42:09.711
Yes, she is.

432
00:42:09.712 --> 00:42:11.631
My niece sewed.

433
00:42:13.633 --> 00:42:15.701
I see you've still got the ring wife Hashem.

434
00:42:15.702 --> 00:42:17.613
Why is it?

435
00:42:17.614 --> 00:42:20.459
Unless he has a new woman
to give it to her.

436
00:42:22.434 --> 00:42:24.170
You hinted at Soraya?

437
00:42:24.172 --> 00:42:25.335
What is it you?

438
00:42:25.336 --> 00:42:26.882
Do not pretend innocent lamb.

439
00:42:26.883 --> 00:42:28.575
You all his life and spread rumors.

440
00:42:28.576 --> 00:42:29.708
Zahra law.

441
00:42:29.709 --> 00:42:31.073
You gossip.

442
00:42:31.074 --> 00:42:33.304
Shut up if you do not know what to talk about.

443
00:42:33.305 --> 00:42:35.990
Maybe that, and I know.

444
00:42:35.991 --> 00:42:37.730
There's nothing to know.

445
00:42:37.731 --> 00:42:39.912
I know that Soraya rejects Ali.

446
00:42:39.913 --> 00:42:41.889
Why else did he amuses himself with other women?

447
00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.215
Because he's a dishonest man.

448
00:42:44.216 --> 00:42:45.775
Ha! He as well as any man.

449
00:42:45.776 --> 00:42:47.894
Feed him and he is happy.

450
00:42:47.895 --> 00:42:52.310
Leave him hungry, and he will take what
thirsty, and you will also be blamed.

451
00:42:52.311 --> 00:42:54.989
I know Soraya. She's a good woman.

452
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.518
You're married to her?

453
00:42:56.519 --> 00:42:59.066
You can not blame Ali for the frigid wife.

454
00:42:59.067 --> 00:43:01.573
Nobody knows what happens between husband and wife.

455
00:43:01.574 --> 00:43:04.273
You ought to understand this, Leila.

456
00:43:25.196 --> 00:43:26.824
Beautiful, Mom?

457
00:43:26.825 --> 00:43:29.389
Yes, dear, very beautiful.

458
00:43:34.735 --> 00:43:36.758
Mom, who am I?

459
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:37.755
Dai guess.

460
00:43:37.756 --> 00:43:38.828
Cow?

461
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:40,950
Not a cow.

462
00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:42.609
Maybe the elephant?

463
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.169
Mom!

464
00:43:45.766 --> 00:43:48.236
Enough. We need to return to prepare lunch.

465
00:44:14.635 --> 00:44:15.913
I'm a rabbit!

466
00:44:18.934 --> 00:44:20.171
See ...

467
00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:24.457
Angels, Mom!

468
00:44:46.457 --> 00:44:47.173
Soraya.

469
00:44:47.992 --> 00:44:49.923
You scared me.

470
00:44:49.924 --> 00:44:51.656
You're early today.

471
00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.261
No work.

472
00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:56.512
Too few machines here.

473
00:44:57.939 --> 00:44:58.919
Where Mohsen?

474
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.207
Lay down to take a nap.

475
00:45:00.208 --> 00:45:02.615
He fell and tore knee.

476
00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:04.421
Cried, cried and fell asleep.

477
00:45:06.392 --> 00:45:07.539
Nothing serious.

478
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.006
Just a little scratch.

479
00:45:16.903 --> 00:45:18.972
I with all govern.

480
00:45:18.973 --> 00:45:20.727
Dinner on the stove.

481
00:45:22.156 --> 00:45:23.360
Smells nice.

482
00:45:23,361 --> 00:45:26.390
Yes, today was fresh lamb.

483
00:45:27.545 --> 00:45:29.395
Can stay ...

484
00:45:30.867 --> 00:45:32.011
sing with me?

485
00:45:34.506 --> 00:45:37.168
No, I really should go home.

486
00:45:38.196 --> 00:45:39.007
Of Course.

487
00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.625
Sometimes I ...

488
00:45:44.573 --> 00:45:47.190
I do not like to eat alone.

489
00:45:51.117 --> 00:45:52.454
Mohsen soon wake up.

490
00:45:56.261 --> 00:45:57.481
See you tomorrow morning.

491
00:46:26.577 --> 00:46:30.636
If you expect from me as from the head of the village,
trial ...

492
00:46:30.637 --> 00:46:33.829
I want meaningful, honest witnesses.

493
00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:40.015
Not your friends or gossips,
who do not like Soraya.

494
00:46:40.016 --> 00:46:46.578
Islamic law says that anyone
witness can testify.

495
00:46:58.085 --> 00:47:00.793
Give me the facts, not rumors.

496
00:47:06.048 --> 00:47:07.526
- Ebragim.
- Not now, Zahra, I'm busy.

497
00:47:07.527 --> 00:47:10.521
I know you involved in intrigues with respect to
Soraya and Ali.

498
00:47:10.556 --> 00:47:12.616
This does not intrigue! Just complaint.

499
00:47:14.056 --> 00:47:18.865
Ebrahim, I'm warning you.
I will not harm my niece.

500
00:47:21.112 --> 00:47:24.556
It would be necessary to wear muzzles women, not dogs.

501
00:47:24.557 --> 00:47:28.469
There is no better wife and mother than Soraya.

502
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.928
We all wondered why she ...

503
00:47:32.993 --> 00:47:35.244
spends so much time in Hashem.

504
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.286
I want to know what is happening.

505
00:47:46.287 --> 00:47:48.102
It's none of your business.

506
00:47:48.103 --> 00:47:49.594
What do you mean, woman?

507
00:47:52.258 --> 00:47:54.541
And I thought to marry you.

508
00:47:57.085 --> 00:47:58.480
However, Ebrahim.

509
00:47:59.572 --> 00:48:01.403
You have become a servant.

510
00:48:01.404 --> 00:48:07.329
You're no more than a slave, sigheh! Temporary wife!
The wife of a monster!

511
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:20.642
This intrigue. I do not know what they are,
but they turned against you.

512
00:48:20.643 --> 00:48:22.985
I just get a wife.

513
00:48:22.986 --> 00:48:25.279
Hardly deserves some intrigue.

514
00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.387
These men are up to something.

515
00:48:28.388 --> 00:48:31.390
You have to quit work.
You can not return to Hashem.

516
00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:35,351
Quit work? This work - my
only hope. I can not leave her.

517
00:48:35.352 --> 00:48:36.484
You can not stay on it.

518
00:48:36.485 --> 00:48:39.769
These same men offered me the job.

519
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.667
And now this is my job.

520
00:48:42.668 --> 00:48:43.595
I will keep it.

521
00:48:43.596 --> 00:48:45.131
Ali complains about you.

522
00:48:45.132 --> 00:48:46.994
- He always complains.
- And what did you tell him?

523
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49.567
It'S Nothing. If I say something, he beats me.

524
00:48:49.568 --> 00:48:53.028
You're not listening. And they can hurt you.

525
00:48:53.029 --> 00:48:55.887
This mullah could persuade a snake
swallowing its own tail.

526
00:48:55.888 --> 00:48:56.560
Enough!

527
00:48:56.561 --> 00:49:01.521
This is not the plot, it's just with my aunt
imaginative.

528
00:49:01.522 --> 00:49:06.078
You could never hear between the lines!

529
00:49:35.048 --> 00:49:36.209
Dear ...

530
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.494
... door.

531
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.896
Look, Hashem ...

532
00:50:12.587 --> 00:50:15.961
we want with you something to talk about.

533
00:50:17.168 --> 00:50:23.198
Ali saw Soraya input-output from you.

534
00:50:25.532 --> 00:50:26.931
He is a man suspicious.

535
00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:30.106
And do not trust his wife.

536
00:50:31.355 --> 00:50:32.637
In addition ...

537
00:50:35.258 --> 00:50:37.601
as you know ...

538
00:50:38.445 --> 00:50:40.280
I have ...

539
00:50:41.718 --> 00:50:46.405
before our Ayatollah enact
all standards of virtue ...

540
00:50:46.406 --> 00:50:48.771
orders as Sharia.

541
00:50:54.627 --> 00:50:56.801
Islam makes such a claim here.

542
00:51:01.775 --> 00:51:07.212
Of course, you could cause a judge from Tehran.

543
00:51:09.505 --> 00:51:12.073
But then it would not be in my hands ...

544
00:51:12.074 --> 00:51:15.351
but in the hands of an official who does not know you.

545
00:51:16.329 --> 00:51:17.147
Read here.

546
00:51:21.073 --> 00:51:22.488
I can not read.

547
00:51:35.167 --> 00:51:36.074
Hashem ...

548
00:51:41.862 --> 00:51:44.436
Are not we old friends?

549
00:51:45.475 --> 00:51:46.862
Yes, we ...

550
00:51:46.863 --> 00:51:48.865
Frankly.

551
00:51:48.866 --> 00:51:51.011
Man to man. Tell the truth.

552
00:51:51.759 --> 00:51:54.156
My wife is sleeping in your house?

553
00:51:55.427 --> 00:51:59.937
No, Ali. She's home every night.

554
00:52:00.982 --> 00:52:06.117
This is not the answer. It happens, lie down?

555
00:52:08.195 --> 00:52:09.649
I do not know.

556
00:52:10.646 --> 00:52:15.073
Hashem, be honest. You should know,
she was asleep or not.

557
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.844
I'm a simple man. I do not know where
you will go to such matters.

558
00:52:25.845 --> 00:52:28.586
- Sit down, Hashem.
- No, I have to go.

559
00:52:28.587 --> 00:52:30.647
I'll go, bye.

560
00:52:41.007 --> 00:52:42.523
Mohsen, give me a wrench.

561
00:52:45.592 --> 00:52:47.004
The key number 10.

562
00:52:48.906 --> 00:52:50.286
Next to the box with tools.

563
00:53:08.918 --> 00:53:09.744
Thank U.

564
00:53:09.745 --> 00:53:11.492
No problem.

565
00:53:11.493 --> 00:53:13,448
How are you, Mohsen?

566
00:53:13.449 --> 00:53:16.538
It's okay, son? Good boy.

567
00:53:16.539 --> 00:53:17.642
Hashem.

568
00:53:17,643 --> 00:53:20.246
We need 2 witnesses.

569
00:53:20.247 --> 00:53:22.723
One we already have.

570
00:53:22.724 --> 00:53:28.222
We can talk to the boy -
if he had seen that Soraya goes home.

571
00:53:29.348 --> 00:53:32.675
He does not understand what you're saying.

572
00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:34.578
Of course, does not understand.

573
00:53:35.202 --> 00:53:37.354
Yes, Mohsen?

574
00:53:44.024 --> 00:53:45.362
Good boy.

575
00:53:46.523 --> 00:53:48.664
Not to involve him in this.

576
00:53:48.665 --> 00:53:50.344
We can not.

577
00:53:50.345 --> 00:53:53.817
If my wife is obscene to you,

578
00:53:53.818 --> 00:53:55.975
perhaps you enjoy it.

579
00:53:55.976 --> 00:53:59.387
Such a man could also be charged with ...

580
00:54:00.448 --> 00:54:01.676
... and punished.

581
00:54:01.677 --> 00:54:05.922
In some cases, stoned together with a woman.

582
00:54:05.923 --> 00:54:07.908
What will happen to Mohsen ...

583
00:54:07.909 --> 00:54:11.114
if his father is not around?

584
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:13.668
Psychiatric Hospital?

585
00:54:13.669 --> 00:54:14.810
Or ...

586
00:54:17.412 --> 00:54:21.804
I could take him to jail and
personally take care of it.

587
00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:24.201
Mohsen, tell us.

588
00:54:26.492 --> 00:54:29.095
What is Soraya doing at home?

589
00:54:29.096 --> 00:54:31.075
It touches you?

590
00:54:31.076 --> 00:54:33.501
Enough! Enough!

591
00:54:34.406 --> 00:54:35.515
Stop it!

592
00:54:35.516 --> 00:54:38.916
Soraya lies in your bed, right?

593
00:54:40.186 --> 00:54:42.062
Why are you doing this?

594
00:54:42.529 --> 00:54:44.983
This is wrong.

595
00:54:45.234 --> 00:54:48.126
God sees.

596
00:54:49.884 --> 00:54:53.756
Hashem, tell us what Soraya sleeps in your bed.

597
00:55:00.569 --> 00:55:01.942
Okay.

598
00:55:03.247 --> 00:55:05.380
I do not know what she was doing.

599
00:55:05.381 --> 00:55:07.962
May be. When I was not at home.

600
00:55:07.963 --> 00:55:08.999
May be?

601
00:55:09.001 --> 00:55:12.456
One day I came home,
and she lay down to take a nap.

602
00:55:12.457 --> 00:55:13.952
She had a headache.

603
00:55:13.953 --> 00:55:17.426
She spoke the word, is not it?

604
00:55:17.427 --> 00:55:21.050
Words that used to say to me.

605
00:55:21.051 --> 00:55:23.834
Words that should be heard only her husband.

606
00:55:42.756 --> 00:55:44.546
You see what I'm saying?

607
00:55:47.973 --> 00:55:48.737
My God, my God.

608
00:55:54.257 --> 00:55:55.775
Lord, forgive me.

609
00:56:19.177 --> 00:56:21.138
My wife - whore!

610
00:56:21.139 --> 00:56:22.361
Bitch!

611
00:56:23.445 --> 00:56:24.817
You're a whore.

612
00:56:25.425 --> 00:56:26.366
How Come?

613
00:56:33.247 --> 00:56:36.090
She dishonored me!

614
00:56:38.016 --> 00:56:40.250
Help me.

615
00:56:41.908 --> 00:56:44.116
She has disgraced me!

616
00:56:49.187 --> 00:56:50.410
In my own home!

617
00:56:53.335 --> 00:56:54.193
Ali, leave it!

618
00:56:54.651 --> 00:56:56.292
It's none of your business!

619
00:56:57.282 --> 00:56:58.408
She's my wife!

620
00:56:58.409 --> 00:56:59.373
This shameless behavior!

621
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:01.401
She's my wife!

622
00:57:01.802 --> 00:57:03.489
She is not worthy of your protection!

623
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.090
Slut cheated on me!

624
00:57:06.091 --> 00:57:09.215
Are not you ashamed to gather here?

625
00:57:10.714 --> 00:57:12.398
She was with another man.

626
00:57:12.399 --> 00:57:14.817
- With whom?
- She slept with Hashem!

627
00:57:19.694 --> 00:57:21.292
She knows.

628
00:57:24.003 --> 00:57:26.025
This is true.

629
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:28.518
Calm down.

630
00:57:28.519 --> 00:57:30.228
Quietly.

631
00:57:30.229 --> 00:57:31.196
Come to my house.

632
00:57:32.413 --> 00:57:33.843
Ali, only you, me and Soraya.

633
00:57:33.844 --> 00:57:35.863
Bit, bring Ebrahim.

634
00:57:35.864 --> 00:57:37.626
We will solve this like civilized people.

635
00:57:39.012 --> 00:57:40.012
Come on.

636
00:57:40.013 --> 00:57:43.211
The old woman! You do not do this show!

637
00:57:43.212 --> 00:57:44.389
This is between me and my wife.

638
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:47.365
So you beat her in public?

639
00:57:47.366 --> 00:57:50.339
In my house. Come on, time is so important.

640
00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.224
See how it changed me?

641
00:57:52.225 --> 00:57:54.155
My wife is a traitor!

642
00:57:54.156 --> 00:57:56.363
We can not leave this crime unpunished.

643
00:57:56.364 --> 00:57:57.930
It should pay for it!

644
00:58:07.126 --> 00:58:08.274
You ok?

645
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.498
Run!

646
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:34.890
See you again in the spotlight.

647
00:58:34.891 --> 00:58:36.257
What is it this time?

648
00:58:36.258 --> 00:58:37.768
She was unfaithful to me.

649
00:58:38.391 --> 00:58:39.662
With Hashem.

650
00:58:40.532 --> 00:58:42.164
I suspected it. Now I know.

651
00:58:42.165 --> 00:58:43.346
I caught them.

652
00:58:43.347 --> 00:58:46.251
Soraya, is that true? You changed it?

653
00:58:46.252 --> 00:58:47.635
No, not really.

654
00:58:48.088 --> 00:58:49.340
Why do you lie?

655
00:58:49.341 --> 00:58:50.630
Everyone knows.

656
00:58:50.631 --> 00:58:53.263
You go to Hashem every day
to sleep with him.

657
00:58:53.264 --> 00:58:54.237
He is lying.

658
00:58:54.238 --> 00:58:56.953
I'm married. I never thought about this.

659
00:58:56.954 --> 00:58:58.699
You say you changed it.

660
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00.683
Then how?

661
00:59:02.184 --> 00:59:05.339
They stood close, whispering.

662
00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.786
I saw they touched each other's hands.

663
00:59:08.787 --> 00:59:10.335
The next day ...

664
00:59:11,002 --> 00:59:14.175
Again they were whispering.

665
00:59:14.176 --> 00:59:15.621
And smiled.

666
00:59:18.696 --> 00:59:19.408
This is true?

667
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:24.767
I told Hashem that wash house ...

668
00:59:25.568 --> 00:59:27.374
then come back to cook dinner.

669
00:59:27.375 --> 00:59:29.879
We smiled at each other.

670
00:59:30.965 --> 00:59:33.228
Hashem here. Now we know the truth.

671
00:59:33.229 --> 00:59:36.991
Talk to your employer - not a crime.

672
00:59:36.992 --> 00:59:39.705
To speak with a man - not a crime.

673
00:59:39.706 --> 00:59:42.811
Smile? Smile is not illegal.

674
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:53.582
Hashem, when you and Soraya whispering ...

675
00:59:54.621 --> 00:59:56.180
what are you talking about?

676
00:59:56.182 --> 00:59:57.499
We do not whispering!

677
01:00:03.375 --> 01:00:06.679
She was going to wash some clothes ...

678
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.069
then come back to cook dinner.

679
01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:13.398
then lie down for a nap.

680
01:00:13.399 --> 01:00:15.297
I never said.

681
01:00:15.298 --> 01:00:18.446
I do not have time to lie down.
I have too much work.

682
01:00:21.877 --> 01:00:24.154
Hashem, listen to me carefully.

683
01:00:25.553 --> 01:00:27,988
I want a straight answer.

684
01:00:28.669 --> 01:00:30.342
Yes or no. Got It?

685
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:38.085
Lee says Soraya

686
01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:41.588
that would like to relax in your house?

687
01:00:43.377 --> 01:00:44.309
Yes, I say.

688
01:00:46.587 --> 01:00:49,503
How was it. She kept me at home.

689
01:00:49.504 --> 01:00:51.675
She lies down in my bed.

690
01:00:55.494 --> 01:00:58.225
Says these words, which are only for the ears of her husband.

691
01:00:58.226 --> 01:00:59.442
This is a lie.

692
01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.678
I never stayed for a single extra minute.

693
01:01:02.679 --> 01:01:05.410
And the door is always open. I Swear!

694
01:01:06.723 --> 01:01:08.819
Why are you doing this?

695
01:01:09.987 --> 01:01:11.825
Why are you talking about?

696
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:13.785
I loved your wife.

697
01:01:14.681 --> 01:01:16.545
I took care of your son.

698
01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:19.941
These men asked me to work for you.

699
01:01:20.387 --> 01:01:22.383
I have not done anything wrong.

700
01:01:36.364 --> 01:01:39.631
Hashem, a man accuses his wife of infidelity ...

701
01:01:39.632 --> 01:01:43.457
can cause rage all over the city.

702
01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:46.644
Such crimes are not lenient.

703
01:01:47.888 --> 01:01:49.496
You have to be sure.

704
01:01:55.705 --> 01:01:58.162
He speaks the truth.

705
01:01:58.163 --> 01:02:00.119
I'm telling you the truth.

706
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.299
Ali himself - I told him ...

707
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.895
and Mullah Hassan

708
01:02:03.896 --> 01:02:05.366
so the entire city ...

709
01:02:05.367 --> 01:02:07.705
even gossips know.

710
01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:14.545
Nothing they do not know. They just repeat what
they hear.

711
01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:15.520
That does not make it true.

712
01:02:16.725 --> 01:02:19.084
I saw them whispering. They were holding hands.

713
01:02:19.085 --> 01:02:21.478
No! I smiled. I'm all smiles.

714
01:02:21.479 --> 01:02:23.047
As the village idiot.

715
01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:25.540
All I know. I am honest.

716
01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.499
They say you're pregnant.

717
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28.955
What? Pregnant?

718
01:02:28.956 --> 01:02:31.513
Wait 9 months and you will see that all
I am not pregnant.

719
01:02:40.919 --> 01:02:42.568
Soraya, two men accused you ...

720
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:45.676
... of misconduct,

721
01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.174
unworthy wife and mother.

722
01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.594
Can you prove your innocence?

723
01:02:55.595 --> 01:02:56.643
To prove?

724
01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.041
How do I prove my innocence?

725
01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:04.109
They accuse me.
They have to prove it.

726
01:03:07.469 --> 01:03:10.708
When a man accuses his wife ...

727
01:03:11.589 --> 01:03:14.142
she must prove his innocence.

728
01:03:15.608 --> 01:03:17.306
It's the law.

729
01:03:18.538 --> 01:03:20.355
On the other hand ...

730
01:03:23.708 --> 01:03:26.712
if a woman accuses her husband,

731
01:03:26.713 --> 01:03:29.335
she must prove his guilt.

732
01:03:29.944 --> 01:03:31.102
Do you understand?

733
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:32.467
Of course, it's obvious.

734
01:03:32.468 --> 01:03:35.385
All women are guilty,
and all the men are innocent.

735
01:03:35.386 --> 01:03:36.401
Right?

736
01:03:36.402 --> 01:03:38.017
Hold your tongue.

737
01:03:38.018 --> 01:03:39.209
Enough!

738
01:03:40.139 --> 01:03:41.198
Bastard.

739
01:03:53.282 --> 01:03:55.735
We've known each other all their lives.

740
01:03:55.736 --> 01:03:57.652
You can not lie to me.

741
01:03:57.653 --> 01:03:59.357
It's a conspiracy.

742
01:03:59.981 --> 01:04:02.428
This is because of the girls, whom he wants to marry.

743
01:04:02.429 --> 01:04:05.703
No, it's a crime.

744
01:04:07.288 --> 01:04:08.562
Serious crime.

745
01:04:09.993 --> 01:04:12.710
Crime against her husband ...

746
01:04:12.711 --> 01:04:15.177
... father of two sons ...

747
01:04:15.178 --> 01:04:16,770
the whole village.

748
01:04:17.781 --> 01:04:19.646
And all of Islam.

749
01:04:21.011 --> 01:04:23.209
That's what we are here, woman.

750
01:04:24.399 --> 01:04:26.664
Now let me begin my duties.

751
01:04:49.597 --> 01:04:50.940
What's wrong?

752
01:04:50.941 --> 01:04:53.448
Ebrahim sent us to stay with you.

753
01:04:53.449 --> 01:04:56.173
He gathers men for discussion.

754
01:04:58.049 --> 01:04:59.260
Who is with him?

755
01:04:59.261 --> 01:05:04.572
Of course, Ali and his friends ...

756
01:05:05.194 --> 01:05:06.754
Both your son, Soraya ...

757
01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:09.611
and Morteza Ramazani.

758
01:05:10.902 --> 01:05:12.695
My own father.

759
01:05:13.921 --> 01:05:16.531
He would agree with everything that they decide.

760
01:05:17.488 --> 01:05:19.399
All men do so.

761
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22.105
Did they ever intercedes for us?

762
01:05:36.003 --> 01:05:40.276
At my age the only penalty
for an offense against morality

763
01:05:40.277 --> 01:05:43.258
were fines or work on the community.

764
01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:45.926
Here another.

765
01:05:45.927 --> 01:05:48.159
You need to relax.

766
01:05:55.707 --> 01:05:59.075
I'll be back soon.

767
01:06:09.541 --> 01:06:12.780
Why are you wearing a black veil?

768
01:06:14.398 --> 01:06:16.311
I'm sorry. I'm nothing like that meant.

769
01:06:16.312 --> 01:06:18.655
I know what you're thinking.

770
01:07:26.527 --> 01:07:28.203
She was found guilty.

771
01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.331
Guilty.

772
01:07:30.332 --> 01:07:32.139
She is guilty.

773
01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.633
Guilty.

774
01:08:24.495 --> 01:08:25.726
Zahra!

775
01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:27.366
Zahra!

776
01:08:27.367 --> 01:08:28.177
Yes I Do!

777
01:08:31.895 --> 01:08:33.724
Salam, Zahra ...

778
01:08:33.725 --> 01:08:35.795
This is from Mullah Hassan.

779
01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:43.700
He asks for your signature.

780
01:08:55.575 --> 01:08:57.313
He wants my signature?

781
01:08:58.780 --> 01:08:59.689
Yes I Am.

782
01:09:15.095 --> 01:09:16.626
Come quickly!

783
01:09:16.627 --> 01:09:17.819
What did they decide?

784
01:09:19.383 --> 01:09:21.231
- There is no time.
- Tell me.

785
01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.010
We have to leave.

786
01:09:23.011 --> 01:09:23.643
Where?

787
01:09:23.644 --> 01:09:25.598
We have no car, no money.

788
01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:30.781
They're going to score you stones in an hour.

789
01:09:30.782 --> 01:09:32.227
Do you understand?

790
01:09:32.228 --> 01:09:33.428
Hurry!

791
01:09:50.647 --> 01:09:51.658
Sister!

792
01:09:53.264 --> 01:09:54.089
Sister, stop!

793
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:55.302
Go on, do not stop.

794
01:09:55.303 --> 01:09:57.451
Stop! Where are you?

795
01:09:57.452 --> 01:10:00.822
Leave us alone. We're leaving here.

796
01:10:00.823 --> 01:10:02.727
You do not go anywhere.

797
01:10:17.299 --> 01:10:19.082
So he still did it.

798
01:10:21.514 --> 01:10:23.821
He got rid of me.

799
01:11:29.266 --> 01:11:32.009
I want you to always wear it.

800
01:11:33.217 --> 01:11:35.222
Do not lose, my dear.

801
01:11:35.223 --> 01:11:36.441
Understand?

802
01:11:52.827 --> 01:11:55.155
And this is - you, my dear Kataneh.

803
01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.256
It belonged to my mother ...

804
01:12:00.703 --> 01:12:02.735
and to her - her mother.

805
01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:05.860
Someday you will give him his eldest daughter.

806
01:12:17.888 --> 01:12:19.227
Come here.

807
01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.877
I am afraid that my daughters will be as follows.

808
01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:02.924
Protect them, aunt.

809
01:13:02.925 --> 01:13:05.934
Only now they have value.

810
01:13:10.107 --> 01:13:11,445
Do not worry.

811
01:13:11.446 --> 01:13:14.215
When they are older, tell them about me.

812
01:13:15.704 --> 01:13:18.302
And they will not be ashamed of his mother.

813
01:13:20.877 --> 01:13:23.959
Soraya, I will tell them the truth.

814
01:13:24.986 --> 01:13:26.669
I tell her everything.

815
01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:29.041
I will tell it to the world.

816
01:14:10.907 --> 01:14:13.492
Dear God, help me.

817
01:14:15.969 --> 01:14:20.552
If what we are doing, according to the will of your ...

818
01:14:20.553 --> 01:14:24.224
then give me the strength to continue.

819
01:14:24.886 --> 01:14:27.998
Help me to do the right thing.

820
01:14:27.999 --> 01:14:31.905
But if it is against your will ...

821
01:14:32.414 --> 01:14:33.955
then give me a sign ...

822
01:14:33.956 --> 01:14:37.109
so I can stop it.

823
01:14:43.784 --> 01:14:45.180
Are you afraid?

824
01:14:46.288 --> 01:14:47.697
Not death.

825
01:14:50.009 --> 01:14:51.730
But to die ...

826
01:14:52.877 --> 01:14:54.377
stones ...

827
01:14:55.984 --> 01:14:57.153
it hurts.

828
01:15:04.347 --> 01:15:05.165
Mom.

829
01:15:06.422 --> 01:15:07.994
Mom, why did you have to die?

830
01:15:07.995 --> 01:15:10.175
In spite of this, son.

831
01:15:10.176 --> 01:15:11.630
Do not have anything to do with.

832
01:15:11.631 --> 01:15:13.421
You did something with Hashem?

833
01:15:13.422 --> 01:15:15.417
I did not do anything.

834
01:15:15,418 --> 01:15:18.139
Your father wants to get rid of me.

835
01:15:21.231 --> 01:15:23.377
Behave like a man, a fool.

836
01:15:24.508 --> 01:15:25.690
My dear Reza ...

837
01:15:41.055 --> 01:15:42.527
Sit down.

838
01:15:46.554 --> 01:15:48.614
Cry all you want.

839
01:16:39.513 --> 01:16:40.426
They are here.

840
01:16:50.608 --> 01:16:52.189
Get Up.

841
01:17:42.796 --> 01:17:45.775
Bastard! I got something for you!

842
01:17:45.776 --> 01:17:47.553
And even more. Who else wants?

843
01:17:47.554 --> 01:17:52.116
Show respect, please
a bit of decency, for God's sake.

844
01:20:03.282 --> 01:20:05.381
Soraya Manutchehri ...

845
01:20:05.382 --> 01:20:12.143
after numerous discussions
we passed sentence.

846
01:20:12.144 --> 01:20:15.082
Unanimously.

847
01:20:15.957 --> 01:20:18.633
Sentence - death.

848
01:20:18.634 --> 01:20:26.899
Death! Death! Death!

849
01:20:28.388 --> 01:20:30.702
Justice decided to ...

850
01:20:30.703 --> 01:20:35.978
that today, in Kupayehe, you'll executed.

851
01:20:57.098 --> 01:20:58.352
This woman ...

852
01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:01.910
defiled our village.

853
01:21:01.911 --> 01:21:05.981
She has to pay for his sins.

854
01:21:05.982 --> 01:21:10.034
With each stone that you throw,

855
01:21:10.035 --> 01:21:16.858
Your Honor returns.

856
01:21:36.209 --> 01:21:37.992
Greetings to all-all-all!

857
01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:41.333
Good afternoon, dear!

858
01:21:43.327 --> 01:21:48.273
We heard that in your village market day ...

859
01:21:48.274 --> 01:21:53.238
come and entertain you after heavy day's work.

860
01:21:53.239 --> 01:21:57.958
Come one, come all,
including children.

861
01:21:57.959 --> 01:22:00.030
Do not you see that we are doing?

862
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:01.786
Stand back and not interfere.

863
01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:08.730
After your prayers.

864
01:22:08.731 --> 01:22:10.261
We'll be around here ...

865
01:22:10.262 --> 01:22:14.311
Come see our show.

866
01:22:20.274 --> 01:22:22.227
Take a felon, and follow me.

867
01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.161
The time is now.

868
01:24:05.946 --> 01:24:07.452
Take off her veil.

869
01:24:15.078 --> 01:24:16.926
I will not cry.

870
01:24:17.703 --> 01:24:19.154
And do not you cry.

871
01:24:20.012 --> 01:24:23.426
Pray hard.

872
01:24:23.427 --> 01:24:26.348
God and heaven are waiting for you.

873
01:24:28.882 --> 01:24:30.393
Pray and for us too.

874
01:24:39.759 --> 01:24:40.759
Waste.

875
01:24:59.308 --> 01:25:01.894
Soraya Manutchehri, if you have something to say ...

876
01:25:03.324 --> 01:25:04.314
now is the time.

877
01:25:10.559 --> 01:25:12.104
This is your last chance.

878
01:25:27.893 --> 01:25:29.804
How can you do it?

879
01:25:32.462 --> 01:25:34.371
If you do not know me.

880
01:25:35.262 --> 01:25:36.485
I Soraya.

881
01:25:38.974 --> 01:25:40.738
I was in your homes.

882
01:25:43.559 --> 01:25:46.509
I share your meal. We were friends.

883
01:25:49.135 --> 01:25:51.519
How can you do this to me?

884
01:25:53.178 --> 01:25:54.604
I am your neighbor ...

885
01:25:57.202 --> 01:25:58.523
your mother ...

886
01:26:02.718 --> 01:26:04.083
your daughter ...

887
01:26:09.005 --> 01:26:10,640
your wife ...

888
01:26:16.009 --> 01:26:18.603
How can you do this to anyone else?

889
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:27.755
This is the law of God.

890
01:26:27.756 --> 01:26:32.005
God is great!

891
01:26:32.006 --> 01:26:33.925
God is the greatest!

892
01:28:00.253 --> 01:28:03.296
Close the ears, girls. Tightly. Like me.

893
01:28:12.206 --> 01:28:13,965
Enough. Stand aside.

894
01:28:24.156 --> 01:28:26.407
Morteza want to say something?

895
01:28:29.444 --> 01:28:33.375
What can I say?

896
01:28:35.971 --> 01:28:38.561
It is no longer my daughter.

897
01:28:40.833 --> 01:28:43.207
I'm not her father.

898
01:28:43.934 --> 01:28:47.205
Let us bring home this to the end and be done with it!

899
01:29:14.354 --> 01:29:16.556
No! Do not do it!

900
01:29:16.557 --> 01:29:19.565
Get away from there, woman!

901
01:29:20.558 --> 01:29:23.815
Stoned me! Instead it -
her young children.

902
01:29:23.816 --> 01:29:25.983
I'll take her place.

903
01:29:25.984 --> 01:29:28.358
Please Ebrahim, stoned me!

904
01:29:28.359 --> 01:29:30.861
Get away, Zahra. You have nothing to do with it.

905
01:29:32.661 --> 01:29:35.633
Please Ebrahim, I beg you.
I'll do anything.

906
01:29:35.634 --> 01:29:37.261
You do not do anything.

907
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:31.906
Give me more!

908
01:30:33.971 --> 01:30:35.970
God help me ...

909
01:30:36.868 --> 01:30:39.771
kill the whore.

910
01:30:44.865 --> 01:30:45.730
Ebrahim!

911
01:30:45.731 --> 01:30:48.152
It's a sign. Stones do not hit ...

912
01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:52.481
because God knows that she is innocent.

913
01:30:53.358 --> 01:30:54.755
Do something!

914
01:31:16.111 --> 01:31:18.037
Everything is fine, old man,
I'll take care of.

915
01:31:29.609 --> 01:31:30.812
The bastards!

916
01:31:30.813 --> 01:31:33.215
Murderers!

917
01:33:27.344 --> 01:33:31.108
Come on, guys. For God.

918
01:35:34.891 --> 01:35:36.009
Get to it!

919
01:35:38.872 --> 01:35:39.736
Throw it in!

920
01:39:41.984 --> 01:39:44.201
More bitch alive!

921
01:39:44.202 --> 01:39:45.765
All take the stones!

922
01:41:54.285 --> 01:41:55.412
That's all.

923
01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:04.855
Ebrahim, surely God Almighty forgive
you for what you did today.

924
01:42:59.965 --> 01:43:00.942
Is There.

925
01:43:19.857 --> 01:43:22.530
They did not allow us to bury her.

926
01:43:23.557 --> 01:43:27.019
We took her body and carried it to the river.

927
01:43:34.201 --> 01:43:37.100
In the city they celebrated.

928
01:44:04.974 --> 01:44:06.312
It happened yesterday.

929
01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:11.165
This morning, before dawn ...

930
01:44:11.787 --> 01:44:13.597
I returned to the river ...

931
01:44:15.214 --> 01:44:18.781
and buried what was left of her dog.

932
01:44:31.496 --> 01:44:32.528
Ah, there you are.

933
01:44:34.325 --> 01:44:35.678
Your car is ready.

934
01:44:47.596 --> 01:44:48.382
Thank U.

935
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:11.701
What happened?

936
01:45:11.702 --> 01:45:13.989
It'S Nothing. He goes to pick up his car.

937
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:16.908
We can not let him go so easily.

938
01:45:16.909 --> 01:45:18.640
He committed no crime!

939
01:45:18.641 --> 01:45:20.789
He is a journalist and writer.

940
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:23.122
Such things must remain within our borders.

941
01:45:23.123 --> 01:45:25,250
We need to know that Zahra told him.

942
01:45:25.251 --> 01:45:26.319
Be prepared.

943
01:45:43.463 --> 01:45:44.612
What happened?

944
01:45:44.613 --> 01:45:46.079
Are not you going to marry?

945
01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:49.939
Marriage will not. Her father was executed.

946
01:45:53.506 --> 01:45:55.693
And I like it.

947
01:46:05.564 --> 01:46:07.689
Then why all this happened?

948
01:46:08.309 --> 01:46:09.476
For nothing!

949
01:46:12.276 --> 01:46:14.899
You made me lie.

950
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:17.758
You beat her with stones on the area for anything!

951
01:46:17.759 --> 01:46:19,220
What are you saying?

952
01:46:20.463 --> 01:46:21.783
They scare me.

953
01:46:23.191 --> 01:46:25.779
They said that my son will be an orphan.

954
01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:27.805
All this was a lie.

955
01:46:28.898 --> 01:46:30.574
Leave me alone.

956
01:46:34.367 --> 01:46:35.619
Do not look at me like that.

957
01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:36.970
You, too, was involved.

958
01:46:36.971 --> 01:46:38.521
That's not true!

959
01:46:38.522 --> 01:46:40.365
You lied to me!

960
01:46:40.366 --> 01:46:42.741
What a lie! You are the head of the village!

961
01:46:42.742 --> 01:46:44.463
You led the proceedings.

962
01:46:45.446 --> 01:46:47.275
We can not let him leave.

963
01:46:59.470 --> 01:47:02.027
I hope Zahra not rob you of time?

964
01:47:02.710 --> 01:47:04.028
Not at all.

965
01:47:06.042 --> 01:47:07.748
She is mistress to tell.

966
01:47:07.749 --> 01:47:10.203
Such imagination. Why, Ebrahim?

967
01:47:10.204 --> 01:47:11.222
Yes I Am.

968
01:47:11.223 --> 01:47:14.463
Sometimes it is difficult to determine who is lying,
and who is telling the truth.

969
01:47:15.949 --> 01:47:18.279
I'll leave it to you, gentlemen.

970
01:47:23.673 --> 01:47:25.221
Why the rush?

971
01:47:26.135 --> 01:47:27.618
What do you have in the bag?

972
01:47:28.473 --> 01:47:29.416
Excuse me ...

973
01:47:29.417 --> 01:47:31.277
I have to pay my bill.

974
01:47:34.527 --> 01:47:35.465
You have already paid.

975
01:47:43.952 --> 01:47:45,300
I can not let you leave.

976
01:47:46.236 --> 01:47:47.491
What do you mean?

977
01:48:02.703 --> 01:48:03.715
You wrote it?

978
01:48:03.716 --> 01:48:05.340
This is my property.

979
01:48:05.341 --> 01:48:07.750
There is no private property.

980
01:48:07.751 --> 01:48:11.000
And we do not allow foreigners to interfere with us.

981
01:48:11.001 --> 01:48:12.522
I am not a foreigner.

982
01:48:22.166 --> 01:48:23.691
How dare you?

983
01:48:26.372 --> 01:48:32.303
I probably will in the near future a government agency.

984
01:48:35.007 --> 01:48:37.248
Do what you want.

985
01:49:09.543 --> 01:49:11.840
Grab it!

986
01:49:14.483 --> 01:49:15.584
- Now Ride.
- And you?

987
01:49:15.585 --> 01:49:18.974
I'll take care of her daughter. Do not worry,
they will do nothing.

988
01:49:28.321 --> 01:49:30.331
Not so hard, my friend.

989
01:49:38.589 --> 01:49:39.925
Get away!

990
01:49:48.935 --> 01:49:50,050
Ebrahim, what are you afraid?

991
01:49:50.051 --> 01:49:52.986
Justice has been done, is not it?

992
01:49:53.877 --> 01:49:55.694
God, whom I love, great.

993
01:49:59.779 --> 01:50:01.411
Is our village ...

994
01:50:01.412 --> 01:50:04.626
was not going to be an example for the whole country?

995
01:50:05.296 --> 01:50:07.447
Now the whole world knows.

996
01:50:08.039 --> 01:50:11.595
Yes I Do! The whole world knows what happened here.

997
01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:13.396
Yes I Do!

998
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:17.675
The world will know!

999
01:50:34.173 --> 01:50:37.173
When the Franco-Iranian journalist Freydona Saebdzham
published "The Stoning of Soraya M."

1000
01:50:37.174 --> 01:50:40.174
the book became an international bestseller and drew
attention to the practice of stoning in Iran,

1001
01:50:40.175 --> 01:50:43.175
as well as there are no rights for women.
Despite the denial of the authorities of this fact,

1002
01:50:43.176 --> 01:50:47.796
countless people, mostly - female
continue to sentence to death by stoning
in many countries around the world.

1003
01:51:01.632 --> 01:51:03.632
It is the only surviving photo
this Soraya Manutchehri,

1004
01:51:03.633 --> 01:51:07.097
did when she was 9 years old.
