1
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:40,651
SAVE ME

2
00:02:57,514 --> 00:02:58,844
But I'm hungry!

3
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:00,196
Come on.

4
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:04,029
Come on. Choose the driver. Come on.

5
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:14,656
Sure that you gotta go?

6
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:16,655
The room is free, I
was the kind of reception.

7
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,980
I have to go back to Gallup.

8
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,370
But today is Sunday ..

9
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:20,152
Yes.

10
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:21,448
Day of rest.

11
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,770
You should eat something.
You look bad.

12
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,410
Thank you.

13
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:26,002
Fuck you!

14
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,202
What is going on?

15
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:30,622
Sorry.
Come on.

16
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,751
I have all this for a party ...

17
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:33,271
Wait!

18
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,741
What happened to your knee?

19
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:39,007
Basebol.

20
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,540
Fucked up.

21
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,620
Pro?

22
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:44,616
I was pro when it was happened.

23
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:46,308
He was good!

24
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:48,980
Do not worry yet
I can throw a fast ball.

25
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,080
I bet you do.

26
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:52,992
Mike?

27
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:53,957
Fucked up!

28
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:55,992
Got some cash?

29
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:59,041
Eh tio, not carried in my
portfolio, then!

30
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,781
I have to put petrol
I have to return the Gallup

31
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,711
you said you were here.

32
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,171
Come on, Give it back.

33
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:06,924
Jesus!

34
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:08,304
It is only a twenty!

35
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:10,353
Fuck you man! You're a fucking?

36
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,361
Uncle, you're always so stoned?

37
00:04:12,361 --> 00:04:13,543
It becomes funny, know?

38
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:14,876
I thought you were a fucking,

39
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:16,605
if you were you would have
clearer ideas,

40
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,185
Wait, wait, wait.

41
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:19,561
Sorry.

42
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,671
You do not have to go, right?

43
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:22,011
If.

44
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:32,713
Bastard!

45
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:41,199
Mark?

46
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:44,104
Mark! Come on, my clients.

47
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:48,048
Mark?

48
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:50,169
Mark?

49
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:52,197
Crap!

50
00:05:05,203 --> 00:05:07,873
Dr. Navarro said that he'll be fine.

51
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:10,503
God is not finished with me yet, eh?

52
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:11,985
This is what am I supposed to say?

53
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,188
I am not sure Mark.
You can not stay here for free.

54
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,643
And do not come to my house!

55
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:17,393
Muy bien!

56
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,800
However, no
I hear your sermons.

57
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,290
Already said all he had to say.

58
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,242
Wash hands with me, brother.

59
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,847
You are incredible, even in this state.

60
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,667
You are so smart.

61
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,095
Maybe that's why you continue

62
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:33,293
while being more intelligent than you.

63
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,693
As Mark has worked for you?

64
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:35,853
I do not want to know!

65
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:37,230
I do not want to know more about it.

66
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,488
I do not want to know more about you.

67
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,398
So your choices are clear.

68
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,782
Why I do this?

69
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:46,352
Taylor is willing to talk to you.

70
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:49,129
You might want to consider a generosity.

71
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:51,346
There is nothing wrong with me.

72
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,204
So it keeps trying to kill you?

73
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:58,899
Brought the mother?

74
00:05:59,244 --> 00:05:59,584
No.

75
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:01,323
Liar!

76
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:02,138
Mother!

77
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:04,018
Mother!

78
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,071
If you would like to see it be here!

79
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,351
Paul fuck!

80
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:07,891
Fuck you!

81
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,258
Because the suit?

82
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:10,068
Idiot!

83
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,118
Because she came?

84
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:11,698
Shock!

85
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:13,688
Paul fuck!

86
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:14,784
Fuck you!

87
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:15,244
Mom!

88
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:16,931
Mom!

89
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:19,275
Mom!

90
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:20,946
Mom!

91
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,551
Mom!

92
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:27,397
Mom!

93
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:34,844
HOME OF GENESIS

94
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:02,568
No problem.
We will wait.

95
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:03,822
Okay.

96
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,609
Is correct, we are then.

97
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:06,419
Paul Malloy

98
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,628
You're going to bring it to the end of the afternoon.

99
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,497
Are willing to pay two months.

100
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:13,750
can not come before?

101
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,951
You know I like it
we are on the table for dinner.

102
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,341
If. I know, but ...

103
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:20,924
Surely we can use
This title is Adam.

104
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:22,495
I thought you had said that
he has a cocaine problem.

105
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:23,717
I can deal with that.

106
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:24,407
What is ...

107
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,370
I do not care.

108
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,880
Are all children of God.

109
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,178
God be praised.

110
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:44,213
You don 't like this bracelet.

111
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:44,553
No!

112
00:07:44,555 --> 00:07:46,065
No, I mean is ...

113
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,294
is very beautiful, is ...

114
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:51,177
petty,

115
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:56,720
I stay just a little jealous
when I see you use something that gave you Jack.

116
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,170
He had good taste.

117
00:08:03,655 --> 00:08:04,695
But I I love you.

118
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:12,107
Jesus Christ can change your life.

119
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:16,542
We know from his word
He allows our struggles.

120
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:18,631
For power
can be revealed in us;

121
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,251
He supervises and Glory!

122
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:25,990
I can not imagine a better life to be a vehicle

123
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,190
for power and glory of God.

124
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:32,134
Not having to deal with doubts about who I am,

125
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,450
is about having to deal on who is Him

126
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,310
And that is ...

127
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:38,048
deserved to live a life.

128
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:39,427
Amen.

129
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:45,083
we have also decided to maintain
Gary Cooper in our prayers.

130
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,838
Scott will visit later today,

131
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:49,340
and Scott, we want to be sure
to bring our love for your father.

132
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,570
Take it, thanks.

133
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:51,796
Praise Jesus.

134
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:53,044
Well ...

135
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:54,695
as we all know,

136
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,695
Today is the last day of Adam.

137
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,361
Not going to get.

138
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,686
And we want to wish you a safe journey,

139
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,570
Make a nice farewell.

140
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,659
As the adventure
world as a beacon of light and hope.

141
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:10,006
Another example of pride for the House of Genesis.

142
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:11,876
Let's join in prayer.

143
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:21,903
Amen.

144
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:24,842
Gayle, I gotta go.

145
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:25,981
Yeah, right.

146
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:30,378
Adam, like recitation
steps for the last time?

147
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:30,838
Clear.

148
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:36,308
We admit we are powerless
about our homosexuality,

149
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,762
and that our lives are uncontrollable,

150
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:44,892
We came to believe that a higher power
we can restore our own sanity.

151
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,229
Much time have you been here?

152
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,076
Half an hour more or less.

153
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,570
You missed a good cake turkey.

154
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:06,875
Okay dad?

155
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,181
¿Cuándo expected return?

156
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:12,801
Should I go?

157
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:17,813
Are you okay?
¿Quieres something?

158
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:19,044
I'm fine.

159
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:23,497
I went through the store ...

160
00:10:24,217 --> 00:10:27,537
Hector sends
completed, the business is going well.

161
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:30,244
The roof must be repaired.

162
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,130
I told you that years ago.

163
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,540
If.

164
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:40,837
I will train, sir.

165
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:44,436
At the local ...

166
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:46,072
If.

167
00:10:47,676 --> 00:10:49,609
And then go home,

168
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:53,049
I will make nice for when you return home.

169
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:56,461
You are trying to kill me.

170
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:01,204
Estou orgulhoso you, filho.

171
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,779
Proud to have vanquished the devil.

172
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:07,875
Yes, sir.

173
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,540
Hmmm!
Lydia!

174
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,608
It smells wonderful!

175
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,561
The fork to the left.

176
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,301
Be in my room.

177
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,766
Lester! it's your turn.
Ted is waiting for you.

178
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:59,256
I always get nervous
when a guy comes back.

179
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,720
And look at me.
I am the example of the fat.

180
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:03,338
I know!

181
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,887
Not that I suppone
worry about things like that.

182
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:07,817
is attractive.

183
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:13,264
Except for women, praised
Jesus and pass the condoms!

184
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:17,629
I love it when you do
laugh things that do not want.

185
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,789
Are best.

186
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,985
The truth is ...
I do not fit here.

187
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:25,047
everywhere. Never did.

188
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:25,967
My father ...

189
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,246
I said the stork,

190
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,594
I was in the wrong stack.

191
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:29,924
Therefore, it comes out.

192
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,618
I had 3 years, it was Halloween,

193
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:34,189
my father

194
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:38,375
I was caught by putting the
my mother's makeup.

195
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,985
Found it funny
but he gave me a good beating.

196
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,656
In the next Halloween
Superman made me go.

197
00:12:44,656 --> 00:12:45,937
Anyway ...

198
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:50,187
I hated the fact that he
I become the problem of others.

199
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,953
I am happy to be here.

200
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,249
Really listening ...

201
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,873
means a lot to see me
that people can be happy,

202
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:04,623
used to think that it was not possible.

203
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,162
I need to think about it!

204
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:27,516
Paul!

205
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:29,796
A pleasure to see you again.

206
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:30,136
Ted!

207
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:31,299
Gayle!

208
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,656
Thanks for doing this.

209
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,648
Espero que te ayude.
Come on Mark!

210
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:38,822
Mark ...

211
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:40,654
Gayle and Ted Taylor.

212
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,330
Gayle and Ted ...

213
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,899
his is my brother Mark.

214
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:46,815
It is a pleasure to meet you.

215
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,370
If! Welcome.

216
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,234
Welcome to Genesis.

217
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:52,572
Not really
you can stay for dinner, Paul?

218
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:53,702
I can not. I have to ...

219
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:54,692
I understand.

220
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,198
Well, God bless.

221
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:00,640
Thanks for everything.

222
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,910
May God bless you too, Paul.

223
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:05,505
Good luck Mark.

224
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:10,979
Give our AGRADECIMENTOS to your mother!

225
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:12,776
Very well then ...

226
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,915
because they enter
hen you're ready ...

227
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:18,732
there is a place for you at the table.

228
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:19,510
I carry your stuff.

229
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,140
I take it.

230
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:21,471
Well.

231
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,325
I take you to your room.

232
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:28,614
Muy bien!

233
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:31,062
This is the fellow.

234
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:34,545
Jude!

235
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:37,233
It's Mark.

236
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:38,305
Hi Mark!

237
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:39,045
He's Jude.

238
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,781
And this is Dustin.

239
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:45,114
Hello!

240
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:46,823
Dustin ...

241
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:48,918
legs!

242
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:03,165
Your room is here,
with Lester Barckey.

243
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:04,272
Lester is a good guy.

244
00:15:04,272 --> 00:15:05,492
You'll Like It.

245
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:14,555
I have to have a roommate?

246
00:15:14,555 --> 00:15:15,305
Everyone has.

247
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:17,451
Except for the fifth phase.

248
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,209
What is that? Scientologists or similar?

249
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:20,549
No.

250
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,421
The fifth phase of which are
take more time here.

251
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:26,458
And made what was proposed.

252
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,328
No matter.

253
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,377
Dinner is ready.
Bring the kids down.

254
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:32,033
I take it.

255
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:32,433
Mark!

256
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:35,405
Welcome to Genesis!

257
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:40,984
You can give a personal touch when you want.

258
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:41,964
I never do.

259
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,443
I did not get that gene.

260
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,288
God have the genes that you provided.

261
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:51,211
And you have the option to live in his image.

262
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,869
Talk to Lester before
to do something.

263
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:57,659
I am sure that you do not mind.

264
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:58,884
Will the key to that door?

265
00:15:58,884 --> 00:15:59,224
No.

266
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,441
Do not close our doors.

267
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,361
We have nothing to hide here.

268
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,921
Coming to dinner?

269
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:07,279
No.

270
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:13,143
So please come to my
office so we can begin.

271
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:15,648
I'll give you a moment.

272
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:30,118
Jude?

273
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:31,916
Dinner!
Already!

274
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:36,630
When you gonna cut that hair?

275
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,162
Samson had long hair.

276
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:39,406
You are not Samson.

277
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:41,506
Jesus had long hair.

278
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:44,465
Dinner!

279
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,054
Hello!

280
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:58,811
Scott Cooper.

281
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,528
You must be Mark.

282
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:01,532
if.

283
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:02,811
Welcome.

284
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,104
Coming to dinner?

285
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:06,435
Jesus! It's just what you think?

286
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:06,955
Food?

287
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,975
At mealtimes? Clear!

288
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:24,659
Hi Mark

289
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:26,594
*

290
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:28,855
Bill Prior.

291
00:17:29,107 --> 00:17:30,497
I take the fifth stage.

292
00:17:32,711 --> 00:17:33,051
If.

293
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:36,875
It means that I am
commissioned and helped Gayle.

294
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:38,389
Well.

295
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:38,964
If.

296
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:42,511
Many types
discouraged at level two or three.

297
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:43,654
You know why?

298
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:45,664
Nao Bill. Why?

299
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:48,653
Because they are weak.

300
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,333
<i> Lord, thank you for this meal.

301
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,146
<i> blessed the hands that prepared it.

302
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:02,635
<i> Bendecidnos and those at your service.

303
00:18:02,635 --> 00:18:05,246
And let us remember a <i>
for the good of others.

304
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,965
<i> Christ, Our Lord, we pray

305
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:07,545
<i> Amen.

306
00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:14,325
Thanks Lydia!

307
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,900
We are a Christian recovery program.

308
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,250
Specializing in sexual weakness.

309
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:25,154
Beyond the golden rules
that others expect to follow:

310
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:26,477
No coffee.

311
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:27,887
Not to nicotine.

312
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:31,613
Meals are at 6:00, 12:00 and 17:30.

313
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:35,675
And the second Sunday of each month
is set aside for fasting and reflection.

314
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:39,547
Good deeds, for six days
week, at 10:00, are mandatory.

315
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:42,899
And on Sunday witnessed the
religious service in the local church.

316
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,236
In regard to the defects,

317
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:47,992
Ted has nine years
victories on drugs and alcohol.

318
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:48,890
Blessed be the Lord.

319
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,146
And it will be a tremendous support to you.

320
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:54,463
Modesty and good hope
behavior in the talk and dress.

321
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:56,393
Walking daily
given at the beginning of each week

322
00:18:56,393 --> 00:18:58,372
including cleaning,
work, cooking facilities ...

323
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,013
Wait a minute.

324
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,025
We are not here to
make plates.

325
00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:01,425
Mark!

326
00:19:03,358 --> 00:19:04,748
This is a choice.

327
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,476
Your choice.

328
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,087
Understand?

329
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:11,281
is free to leave at any time.

330
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:13,081
But that is good news,

331
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,684
if you are ready for change

332
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:17,314
is in the right place.

333
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:22,277
And do it all for free?

334
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,507
Come on! Who pays for this?

335
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:29,057
Well, in truth, his brother
paid two months of his stay here.

336
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:29,517
Crap!

337
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:32,481
Shit!

338
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:37,052
That bastard!

339
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,581
Bill, let it be.

340
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,909
Mark, his brother was worried about you.

341
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,299
Of course it pays.

342
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:44,639
You know what? I do not need
nothing of it, okay?

343
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:46,285
Never again!
understand that?

344
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,405
You can have this ...

345
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:49,456
He will put out that in the face
like everything else.

346
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,707
Not going to stop doing that!

347
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:52,873
I think you should
spend the night here and pray ...

348
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,282
I do not want to pray, jódase!

349
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:55,502
Well, then think!

350
00:19:57,682 --> 00:19:58,833
And tomorrow we talk again

351
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,933
at this time, see how you talk.

352
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:03,951
Jesus Christ!

353
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,750
Sorry.

354
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:13,042
I can go to my room now?

355
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:13,322
If

356
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,949
but talk to Scott after dinner.

357
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:20,249
He must have a project to
which needs your help.

358
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,701
Gayle sent me here to
see if you need help.

359
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:32,381
But it seems to have everything under control.

360
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:41,912
Where can I find a
cigarette around here? Crap!

361
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:43,482
Smoking is not allowed.

362
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:48,092
And if you do not mind
might need your help.

363
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,240
Not bad.

364
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:56,333
Whatever. To me it seems
you're almost finished

365
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,330
Think you can?

366
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:11,796
He no longer has any side
to go but the streets.

367
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:12,966
Is used ...

368
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:15,775
to break out there.

369
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:19,785
I guess we have two days
before you decide to leave.

370
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:23,805
But we do not accept money from the brother?

371
00:21:23,805 --> 00:21:24,205
Gayle

372
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:25,877
Perhaps there is someone who can connect

373
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:27,718
Pastor Thompson or the Family?

374
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,382
Oh no!
And fucked before.

375
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:32,292
Besides that I have an election coming.

376
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:34,857
We then have two days to impress.

377
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:35,897
More or less.

378
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,860
impresses me less than 5 minutes.

379
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:43,214
Good night.

380
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:51,392
I ... I ...

381
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:54,399
Yo I love you, but ... but ... I can not.

382
00:21:54,811 --> 00:21:55,501
Okay.

383
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:58,145
Let me make you happy.

384
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:03,103
You do.

385
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:14,079
Crap!

386
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,018
Excuse me snoring.

387
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:24,911
They say that many times
is the result of unconscious cravings,

388
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,471
Alien and Predator.

389
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,304
You do not speak seriously?

390
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,404
No, I'm not.

391
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:38,342
Watch ...

392
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:41,008
if you go to pee

393
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:46,681
exit onto the front, so no
passing through the living room of Ted and Gayle.

394
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,160
The room is yours.

395
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:09,946
Are you going somewhere?

396
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:15,565
Why? You are the
guardian of this sacred place?

397
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,432
The first night is difficult.

398
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:22,474
What happened to the rule of non-smoking?

399
00:23:22,474 --> 00:23:24,284
Progress is not perfection.

400
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:27,424
I do not say anything if you do not say.

401
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,899
Sorry not to be stronger, but ...

402
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:33,569
kills vice, if you want it.

403
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:40,845
Okay?

404
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:41,909
I am.

405
00:23:43,466 --> 00:23:45,446
It is best that you stay tonight.

406
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,136
Go tomorrow.

407
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:51,555
There are no cars at this time
there is nobody on the road.

408
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:52,676
how long ago that you're here?

409
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:53,878
5 or 10 minutes.

410
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:54,969
I could not sleep.

411
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:56,369
I was referring to the local.

412
00:23:58,155 --> 00:24:00,185
Yes, I know what you meant.

413
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,225
Five months.

414
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:06,094
If you're here for five
months that I need more.

415
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:07,424
Hey, Are you okay?

416
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:09,902
're Sure you're okay?

417
00:24:09,902 --> 00:24:10,766
You look pale.

418
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:13,886
Who told you that
you're a fucking doctor?

419
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:14,798
Crap!

420
00:24:21,513 --> 00:24:22,373
TED!
GAYLE!

421
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:26,024
Breathe!

422
00:24:26,587 --> 00:24:27,220
Just breathe.

423
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,971
passing pattern, Ted.

424
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,424
You could send it to
a detox center.

425
00:24:31,424 --> 00:24:34,334
No! I will not return
to that hospital!

426
00:24:34,352 --> 00:24:37,128
You are right,
County General must go.

427
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:37,588
So?

428
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:40,661
you think with this win?

429
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,818
I do not know. The expert is you, ¿verdad?

430
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,393
Maybe I should call your brother.

431
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:46,733
No.

432
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,289
He is not my guardian!

433
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,039
I decide!

434
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,260
Then decide!

435
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:53,579
Taylor County General Hospital

436
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,999
Doctor, thanks for coming.

437
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:04,336
Thanks doctor.

438
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:10,196
Mark?

439
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:11,913
Mark?

440
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,110
You are oyéndome?

441
00:25:19,241 --> 00:25:20,461
¿Quieres back?

442
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:30,728
So that's a start.

443
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:35,143
I saw that miracles happen here.

444
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,878
Within time you'll have a miracle.

445
00:25:40,962 --> 00:25:44,371
You're going to start to see
things differently.

446
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:45,481
I promise that.

447
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,680
I do not want to be this way.

448
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:56,787
Here you are dear Mark.

449
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:20,147
My father died ...

450
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:21,799
with collapse of liver.

451
00:26:21,937 --> 00:26:23,111
Jesus did not save

452
00:26:23,111 --> 00:26:26,541
Alcoholism. So
I think there was that stretch.

453
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,152
So ... talking about ...

454
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:32,192
these last three weeks have been fuckin '.

455
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:33,382
Sorry.

456
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:34,717
But ...

457
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:38,075
Lester is cold, it makes me laugh.

458
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:41,797
Randall ....

459
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,966
is good for a joke
silly on occasion.

460
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,485
There was a time I was
As far as the entry ...

461
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,935
someone made me stop.

462
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:57,112
You know how it feels, right?

463
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,259
I think there is something here.

464
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:03,358
In the past I would be ..

465
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:06,538
in another county for
Now, no doubt

466
00:27:08,063 --> 00:27:09,403
Hello friend, sorry.

467
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,101
Sorry.

468
00:27:11,134 --> 00:27:11,644
What?

469
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:14,943
Should be grateful for haberte
have supported the first day.

470
00:27:14,943 --> 00:27:17,053
You mean when you faint.

471
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:19,029
All right.
Do not worry.

472
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:20,738
Without resentimentos?

473
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:25,782
All you do is try to help
while hindering my ego.

474
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:27,882
ZDE really think this works?

475
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:31,333
Depends on what
you mean it works.

476
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,493
Or want to live.

477
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:34,784
I had a lot of experience,

478
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,525
I acted my way now
I will try the others.

479
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:37,395
Hi guys.

480
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:40,827
And if I help
those houses with birds?

481
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,109
I look forward to that, Ted.

482
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:42,394
Well.

483
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:43,724
To work then.

484
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,727
I keep saying that we should
collect more than $ 10 for these things.

485
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:50,754
Mark is for charity.

486
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,384
Not for Telemarketing.

487
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:57,065
What happened?

488
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:01,439
Maybe we should charge more for yours.

489
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:07,778
It was just an idea.

490
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:10,154
I love as well as Maxine.

491
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,200
Already we are almost a year, you think?

492
00:28:15,508 --> 00:28:16,438
Sounds good.

493
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:22,553
Who would think that
I would reach this point?

494
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:24,003
But after five years

495
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,706
I had to get something, ¿sabes?

496
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:28,046
I have a resolution of orientation.

497
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,709
Perhaps not the best
how to put this.

498
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:33,579
I thought ...

499
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:35,441
to ask her to marry me.

500
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:38,233
But even I did not say anything.
I need to earn more money first.

501
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:39,525
She can not live here.

502
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:43,080
And I'm not sure
I live with her mother.

503
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,350
Are the only options for now.

504
00:28:45,845 --> 00:28:47,689
I make it work somehow.

505
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:49,470
To be perfectly honest,

506
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,957
not included this in my
final accounting report.

507
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:54,757
This new type, Mark ...

508
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,217
I had thought ...

509
00:28:58,663 --> 00:28:59,233
I know.

510
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:01,864
I know it's okay, what happens, but ...

511
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:05,710
dijistes that if you are not
speaks about it is the risk of doing so.

512
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,290
Now ...

513
00:29:06,657 --> 00:29:07,867
I trust my

514
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:09,272
ill for inaction

515
00:29:11,623 --> 00:29:13,293
but that does not stop the thoughts.

516
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:13,863
And I ...

517
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:16,494
I feel guilty before Maxine.

518
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:20,551
what I forgot
included in the report

519
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:21,531
And so ...

520
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,895
That is why I'm by count
to keep as far away as possible.

521
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:28,254
With regard to
drinking, I'm sober for five months

522
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:29,987
since the last time, so ...

523
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,666
I have a good control over that.

524
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,296
Not.

525
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,216
Things are getting better every day.

526
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:36,256
Thank God.

527
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:40,852
Yes, I think
main problem is here.

528
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:45,583
Randall!

529
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:47,654
Randall?

530
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:48,363
As we go?

531
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:48,933
That's it.

532
00:29:49,726 --> 00:29:50,293
We can stop there.

533
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,386
Disconnected before flooding here.

534
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:53,836
Somebody close the water.

535
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:54,898
I close.

536
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:04,987
low?

537
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:06,911
If.

538
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:08,410
OK

539
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:17,742
I told you that I'm afraid of heights?

540
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:37,943
Come on Justin.

541
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:41,822
Careful guys.

542
00:30:51,477 --> 00:30:53,647
Sorry, I did not want to frighten.

543
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,091
How long you've been there?

544
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,025
Few seconds.

545
00:30:58,168 --> 00:31:00,356
I thought that even
were on the roof with Mark.

546
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:02,686
No! No, we have found the leak.

547
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,569
Is at the base of the skylight.

548
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:08,255
Looks like you're having fun.

549
00:31:08,337 --> 00:31:09,438
¿Necesitas help with that?

550
00:31:09,438 --> 00:31:09,778
No.

551
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,310
I'm fine. I'm almost done.

552
00:31:13,943 --> 00:31:15,093
What color is it?

553
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:15,863
Why?

554
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:20,939
These lines of the jacket.
Say what color they are?

555
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:22,418
I do not know is ...

556
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:24,435
red.

557
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,800
Gayle know, at that ...

558
00:31:33,246 --> 00:31:35,276
night he went with Mark ...

559
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:37,967
That night?

560
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:40,338
I gave it a cigarette,

561
00:31:40,338 --> 00:31:41,206
Since I left, but ...

562
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:45,216
I think that was it
was sick, I regret that.

563
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:49,077
Scott Thanks for your honesty.

564
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:55,690
Problem that would lead me
the van to go visit my father?

565
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,620
You go alone?

566
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:57,717
If.

567
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,381
Ted holds the key.

568
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,304
Hey, buddy!

569
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:11,333
Nice to see you.

570
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,253
It's also good to see Hector.

571
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:16,468
Que pasa?

572
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:19,903
I have a small
leak in the roof of the Genesis,

573
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:22,209
I need some
things to repair the skylight.

574
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,319
Let's look.

575
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:27,852
I saw you talking with your father.

576
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:28,722
Me

577
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:30,117
If ...

578
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:31,283
He is ...

579
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:32,973
hard on your way.

580
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:36,435
It's good to see it though.

581
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:39,999
What gave to find Jesus?

582
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:40,919
Amen to that.

583
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:43,573
If so never worked with me.

584
00:32:44,435 --> 00:32:49,184
Or if it did, it was a feeling that
ended so quickly that neither I remember.

585
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:51,308
I remember my mother
not near

586
00:32:51,308 --> 00:32:52,575
I think that when she died,

587
00:32:52,575 --> 00:32:54,545
my father as he stood ...

588
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:57,012
ceased to live.

589
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:58,316
Except through me.

590
00:32:58,316 --> 00:33:00,038
So when my
father discovered that I was gay

591
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:01,368
acted as if I ...

592
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:03,398
he died too.

593
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:07,401
Or as if the person
he knew was dead.

594
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,770
So I looked
people like me

595
00:33:11,538 --> 00:33:12,705
I mean, I met gay people,

596
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,675
but the bars and parties ...

597
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:16,732
I felt ...

598
00:33:16,952 --> 00:33:18,601
as if the person I should be.

599
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:19,994
Was when I started thinking

600
00:33:19,994 --> 00:33:21,085
maybe my father is right.

601
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:22,647
Perhaps what I thought

602
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:24,097
his sentence was

603
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,410
was a deep love.

604
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,370
Being attracted by
men with men or go

605
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,462
that ...
that ...

606
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:31,113
need not be part of who I am

607
00:33:31,113 --> 00:33:34,073
because it is part
the image of God.

608
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:37,868
I think my father ...

609
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:40,258
is proud of me now.

610
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,562
Chocolate or strawberry?

611
00:33:57,431 --> 00:33:58,011
Strawberry!

612
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,770
And if you had told me chocolate?

613
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,839
I like to drink strawberry.

614
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,953
You sleep better?

615
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,500
Yes

616
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:21,241
Lester finally stopped snoring.

617
00:34:29,353 --> 00:34:32,053
How long were you in that hospital?

618
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:33,865
In that occasion?

619
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,122
Prior to this.

620
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:38,809
Three months.

621
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:41,102
What did you do?

622
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,814
It is not in the report of ex-gay?

623
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:44,214
Mark!

624
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:47,706
We take seriously what we do.

625
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:53,734
I tried to commit suicide.

626
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:54,134
How?

627
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:57,418
with a knife.

628
00:34:58,678 --> 00:35:01,048
It was my father, which follows from that?

629
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:03,548
must have felt an immense pain.

630
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,383
I did not feel anything,
was drugged at the time.

631
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,073
I wanted to say what you did.

632
00:35:09,183 --> 00:35:11,383
Well, he died for me.

633
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:13,687
Ironically.

634
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:17,303
Think it was because of what you did?

635
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:21,823
That is what my mother and
brother would like to believe.

636
00:35:22,282 --> 00:35:28,452
My father had entered on that path
long before the gay factor arose.

637
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:32,455
What the Bible says
about the repairs of shit?

638
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:32,975
Mark ...

639
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:34,035
That language.

640
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:34,973
Sorry.

641
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,349
I had a son.
642

642
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:43,312
Did you have?

643
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,550
Died.

644
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:50,487
After eight years.

645
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:53,167
How?

646
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:56,226
An overdose.

647
00:35:58,493 --> 00:35:59,943
How old was he?

648
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:05,496
Seventeen.

649
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:08,185
Was gay.

650
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:13,606
Then he committed suicide?

651
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:15,339
I do not think I wanted.

652
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:19,857
But he got there
lifestyle and drugs.

653
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:21,725
I was very young.

654
00:36:22,356 --> 00:36:23,166
So ...

655
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:24,957
Why not change?

656
00:36:24,957 --> 00:36:25,937
Did everything?

657
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:26,991
Mark

658
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,649
I do not change people.

659
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:33,917
Tries to show how
closer to Jesus Christ.

660
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:36,657
And let them make their own way.

661
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:42,623
Unless you already know the path.

662
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:50,253
You know how it is when people
who were near death?

663
00:36:50,253 --> 00:36:52,343
Speak to walk towards the light?

664
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:53,906
Well ...

665
00:36:54,362 --> 00:36:57,212
I think we do the same in life.

666
00:36:57,928 --> 00:37:00,498
But we walked towards the Lord.

667
00:37:00,854 --> 00:37:03,510
And sometimes that light is so bright ...

668
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,380
cegante is ...

669
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:06,875
but if we have faith ...

670
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,179
and continue to lead toward it,
taking a step every time ...

671
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:14,609
then we begin to see
that the light of the Lord ..

672
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,957
is within us.

673
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:19,424
And when we do ...

674
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:21,428
it overflows ...

675
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:24,775
and illuminates our path

676
00:37:25,997 --> 00:37:27,857
not to lose its way.

677
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,950
Never again.

678
00:37:44,021 --> 00:37:44,651
Ó Skies!

679
00:37:45,501 --> 00:37:48,111
And I seem sensible and decent.

680
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:51,266
You are!

681
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:53,897
Well ...

682
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:56,433
grateful.

683
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:04,963
That was nice.

684
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:14,899
Who would have said that Mark
were on our team.

685
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:16,125
We are all on the same computer.

686
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,445
It is not why we're here?

687
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,328
Today was fun.

688
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:25,294
If.

689
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:31,455
Lester seems to be fine.

690
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:32,215
Slowly.

691
00:39:35,568 --> 00:39:39,478
Just because I do not understand
seem to encourage Mark and Scott.

692
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:43,795
What?

693
00:39:45,507 --> 00:39:46,727
Do not trust him?

694
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:48,744
With whom?

695
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:49,775
Scott.

696
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:52,339
Do not be ridiculous!

697
00:39:54,132 --> 00:39:56,452
Not why is it that we fight here?

698
00:39:57,191 --> 00:40:00,351
A healthy friendship, nothing sexual men?

699
00:40:00,646 --> 00:40:03,680
Mean, they were playing baseball for the love of God!

700
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,020
If!

701
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:05,774
Gayle listens.

702
00:40:07,122 --> 00:40:09,282
You're right to be worried.

703
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,088
You know that Mark is ... clever.

704
00:40:12,374 --> 00:40:14,353
It is a flawed and invalid are ready.

705
00:40:14,353 --> 00:40:16,983
But perhaps we should give him a chance.

706
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:23,879
Contrary to this, there is no turning back.

707
00:40:24,496 --> 00:40:25,536
Back to what?

708
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:28,605
He reminds you to Ryan.

709
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:29,475
Please!

710
00:40:30,183 --> 00:40:32,268
Not it is happening here.

711
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:33,329
He just needs to be protected.

712
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:34,499
We need everyone.

713
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,940
Ryan was not your son.

714
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,089
Please do not use it well.

715
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:41,184
Sorry.

716
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,710
It is not fair.

717
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:46,573
Hey, maybe we should be leaving,

718
00:40:46,573 --> 00:40:47,443
moment

719
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:51,017
let them find their own way.

720
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:16,841
You awake?

721
00:42:18,742 --> 00:42:19,082
If.

722
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:24,945
With how many men had sex?

723
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:29,441
More than ten?

724
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:31,261
If.

725
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:36,785
Ever been in love?

726
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:39,341
Once.

727
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:41,797
Of a man?

728
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:45,058
If. A long time ago.

729
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:48,732
He knew?

730
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:52,142
knew.

731
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,475
Gayle said that I
I am blessed because I never

732
00:42:57,475 --> 00:43:00,975
I fell on my drive
homosexual weakness.

733
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:05,635
I do not know how to do it differently.

734
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:07,974
You ...

735
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,105
but the Bible says that if you ...

736
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:14,306
commit a sin of thought

737
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:17,096
is the same as comets in reality.

738
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:19,877
Think is true?

739
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:23,438
Not, perhaps.

740
00:43:24,637 --> 00:43:25,327
You think?

741
00:43:27,394 --> 00:43:28,494
I hope so.

742
00:43:34,898 --> 00:43:35,648
Good night.

743
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:39,036
Goodnight Lester.

744
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:42,611
Sinner.

745
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,461
Ladies and Gentlemen,

746
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:51,263
The lull is ...

747
00:43:51,263 --> 00:43:51,963
done!

748
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:16,757
So many think they will come?

749
00:44:17,284 --> 00:44:19,082
I think we should
wait a few twenty-five.

750
00:44:19,082 --> 00:44:21,648
Perhaps more
we must spread the word.

751
00:44:21,648 --> 00:44:22,228
Now ...

752
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,065
What to bring?
Five?

753
00:44:24,065 --> 00:44:24,465
Six!

754
00:44:25,057 --> 00:44:25,517
Crap!

755
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,390
Well, this was removed

756
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:32,831
GammonEmpire in March of last

757
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,193
Obviously, you should
Maxine invite Hollister.

758
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:38,083
She carried out with Bill for a year.

759
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,801
That's wonderful!

760
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,271
This is a. ..

761
00:44:41,484 --> 00:44:42,534
Bethany Mallow?

762
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:46,775
Heaven ... she ...

763
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:48,225
a little fatter, no?

764
00:44:48,225 --> 00:44:50,084
Not that is not adorable.

765
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:50,899
They are all adorable.

766
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:52,689
I only hope that
are free on Saturday night.

767
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:53,849
Well, I can ...

768
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:57,308
give a special word for six.

769
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:58,099
Grateful pastor.

770
00:44:58,099 --> 00:45:01,009
I can not say
how much I appreciate it.

771
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:02,994
is an important job.

772
00:45:02,994 --> 00:45:04,274
Praise God.

773
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:05,531
Pastor ...

774
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:10,110
I am not sure if Ted
have spoken to lately

775
00:45:10,648 --> 00:45:12,182
But the house needed repairs.

776
00:45:12,182 --> 00:45:15,443
And the guys are not
can do everything alone.

777
00:45:15,443 --> 00:45:15,903
Well ...

778
00:45:16,455 --> 00:45:18,675
We have some free beds, y. ..

779
00:45:19,524 --> 00:45:23,725
had no idea that the church
could help in the coming months

780
00:45:23,725 --> 00:45:24,305
Gayle ...

781
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:28,434
Who we are
happy to support this dance.

782
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:32,663
But we are trying our
aguante sister church in its foundations.

783
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:36,830
You know I always support
Genesis the way we can.

784
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,589
Yes, we supported him and
very grateful.

785
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:40,771
I was just thinking ...

786
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,041
We talked again after the dance.

787
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,237
It would be wonderful.

788
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:47,604
Grateful pastor.

789
00:45:54,078 --> 00:45:55,348
If it is so ..

790
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:56,031
Wait.

791
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:58,262
Yes?

792
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,740
Who?

793
00:46:27,478 --> 00:46:29,268
The Lord is my shepherd,

794
00:46:30,284 --> 00:46:31,674
I would not be lost.

795
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:35,421
He made me lie in green fields,

796
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:38,557
led me to calm water.

797
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:41,647
He restored my soul,

798
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:47,242
guided me through the paths of
justice for the glory of his name.

799
00:46:47,242 --> 00:46:50,962
Yes, though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death,

800
00:46:52,506 --> 00:46:54,136
no fear no evil

801
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:56,755
because He is with me,

802
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:00,489
your rod and your staff comfort me.

803
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:09,134
If a man lies with another man, as if
sleep with a woman, both have committed an abomination ...

804
00:47:14,524 --> 00:47:14,864
Father.

805
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,030
should be sentenced to death;

806
00:47:20,115 --> 00:47:22,205
their blood shall be upon them.

807
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:23,707
Father!

808
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:25,686
I ... I love you so much dad!

809
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:28,594
Why did this Scotty?

810
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:30,110
No!

811
00:47:31,035 --> 00:47:32,965
Your heart will have been disappointed.

812
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:36,999
Going to hell!

813
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:38,227
And I do not ...

814
00:47:38,585 --> 00:47:40,035
I will see you again.

815
00:47:42,255 --> 00:47:42,655
Jesus

816
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:46,231
Please take the brother Henry Cooper,

817
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:48,494
accept the kingdom of your father.

818
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,303
Why?

819
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:53,892
Father, no ...

820
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,880
Scott's father has just died.

821
00:48:11,786 --> 00:48:13,116
How is Scott?

822
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,080
Let?

823
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,230
Ted says he is okay?

824
00:48:21,176 --> 00:48:23,796
You never cry for you, right?

825
00:48:24,386 --> 00:48:26,101
By that hypocritical?
Are you kidding?

826
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:28,491
We should not blame others Mark.

827
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:30,679
The fault lies with us.

828
00:48:36,267 --> 00:48:38,937
Nothing worthy of salvation is simple.

829
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,310
We can pray?

830
00:49:06,826 --> 00:49:07,936
When you come back?

831
00:49:09,293 --> 00:49:10,793
an hour ago or so.

832
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:13,261
Ted gave me a ride.

833
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:19,964
Sorry.

834
00:49:24,483 --> 00:49:25,473
He hated me.

835
00:49:28,147 --> 00:49:29,720
I knew what happened.

836
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,010
Deus ... Leviticus ...

837
00:49:33,021 --> 00:49:35,407
I was probably still cheating,

838
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:38,207
thinking he was OK with me now.

839
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:41,624
I never thought it would be the last
I thing he would say.

840
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:45,126
Scott, he could be
delirious with drugs, not create.

841
00:49:45,126 --> 00:49:46,185
Cree in me.

842
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:49,285
You know, should not be imported.
But I care!

843
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,531
I am here because of him.

844
00:49:56,218 --> 00:49:57,438
What do you mean?

845
00:50:00,717 --> 00:50:01,577
I came here

846
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:03,987
two days after ...

847
00:50:04,997 --> 00:50:07,847
The doctor told me that he was dying.

848
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:09,657
Was going to do right.

849
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:10,810
Y. ..

850
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:14,163
Was true for some time.

851
00:50:15,374 --> 00:50:16,414
knew so well.

852
00:50:16,693 --> 00:50:17,673
Know.

853
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:20,399
Yet known.

854
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,320
No.

855
00:50:23,332 --> 00:50:25,032
Lately I have thought

856
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:28,714
that I am not here for him.

857
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,917
That's good.
You are here for you.

858
00:50:36,876 --> 00:50:38,786
That was not what I said.

859
00:50:44,564 --> 00:50:46,414
I think it's because I love you.

860
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,400
Much.

861
00:50:55,556 --> 00:50:56,306
Me too.

862
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,267
Can I ask you a cigarette?

863
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:11,516
If.

864
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:09,736
Forgive me.

865
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:13,041
It's all good.

866
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,912
We were going to smoke.

867
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:19,945
A smoking with you.

868
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:25,421
See you there.

869
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:40,846
Just do not understand the reasons
for which you want to go Lester.

870
00:52:41,156 --> 00:52:43,426
I thought you liked being here.

871
00:52:44,115 --> 00:52:45,855
You have much to give.

872
00:52:47,227 --> 00:52:48,147
For all of us.

873
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:52,531
and you know that this process takes time.

874
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,890
When I have questions ...

875
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:56,727
I know that is the Lord ...

876
00:52:57,736 --> 00:52:59,236
testing my faith.

877
00:53:04,656 --> 00:53:09,016
Remember what your father
was going on when you brought?

878
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:11,409
As was the broken heart?

879
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:16,918
We do not want to spend our
problems for your father, right?

880
00:53:18,269 --> 00:53:21,819
Not when we can
we deal with them the same here.

881
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,230
Cute child.

882
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,103
Step S11

883
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:39,451
We are determined not to
continue living in fear of the world,

884
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:43,799
believe that the victory of God's glory
dump all those who are against us in our favor.

885
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:45,260
Bringing the benefits of sorrows

886
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,710
order and disorder.

887
00:53:50,332 --> 00:53:51,022
Step 12s

888
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:55,593
We are determined to have
mature relationships with men and women

889
00:53:55,593 --> 00:53:58,074
learning the meaning
a partnership between equals.

890
00:53:58,074 --> 00:54:00,359
not seeking domination over others

891
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:02,459
or slavish dependence on them.

892
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:04,130
Grateful.

893
00:54:16,314 --> 00:54:19,963
I had hoped that
we could talk about last night.

894
00:54:19,963 --> 00:54:21,703
What are we listening?

895
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:22,819
I know.

896
00:54:24,705 --> 00:54:26,335
You can give me a hint?

897
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:30,506
There is a new mother in there.

898
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:40,308
He had hopes of talking
about what happened in last night.

899
00:54:40,308 --> 00:54:42,161
You are disculpandote by ...

900
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:44,091
you've taken advantage of me?

901
00:54:44,808 --> 00:54:45,148
If.

902
00:54:46,606 --> 00:54:47,476
A species.

903
00:54:51,095 --> 00:54:52,495
Do not use.

904
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:55,036
Want to forget, forget.

905
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,519
Not that I'm saying.

906
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:57,389
I just ...

907
00:54:59,182 --> 00:55:01,152
Afraid of love then?

908
00:55:02,877 --> 00:55:04,797
If Gayle discovers what she ...

909
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:07,175
What I am trying to say is ...

910
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:14,455
I know what you're trying to say is you are
better here and does not want anyone to ruin everything.

911
00:55:16,065 --> 00:55:17,960
I see them together consistently.

912
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,240
We must do something.

913
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,614
Endure just as it is.

914
00:55:20,614 --> 00:55:22,884
We have to keep on track!

915
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:24,768
Because always judge
Scott so harshly?

916
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:25,932
The Andrews will be here any moment.

917
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,849
You involved with
since the day he arrived.

918
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:28,309
Ted ...

919
00:55:28,732 --> 00:55:31,137
sometimes a boy
makes all the right things.

920
00:55:31,137 --> 00:55:33,808
but inside, we know that he
is not accepting Christ into your heart.

921
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:35,067
We saw that before.

922
00:55:35,067 --> 00:55:36,921
So we have to work harder.

923
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:39,860
He is a risk to others
Kids who can save.

924
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,600
Mark, you mean.

925
00:55:44,947 --> 00:55:45,757
Mr. Andrews

926
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:47,956
is about love

927
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:49,711
discipline

928
00:55:50,688 --> 00:55:54,688
and the sacred work of God
here and around the world.

929
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,980
Johnny, you had
opportunity to meet the residents?

930
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,500
Any.

931
00:56:00,386 --> 00:56:01,436
Like it?

932
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:02,871
They were friendly?

933
00:56:03,845 --> 00:56:04,185
If.

934
00:56:05,698 --> 00:56:08,138
Think you will like it here?

935
00:56:08,935 --> 00:56:10,160
He is very shy.

936
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,779
And this is the first
time to be away from home.

937
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:15,307
I think you'll like this,
wanted, ZnO?

938
00:56:15,307 --> 00:56:18,344
Sr.ª. Taylor, I think that
you and your husband is created

939
00:56:18,344 --> 00:56:20,214
a miraculous thing, but ...

940
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:23,497
This is only the first
premises visited,

941
00:56:23,497 --> 00:56:25,086
I want more time to ...

942
00:56:25,086 --> 00:56:27,006
decide, if you do not mind.

943
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,050
I understand.

944
00:56:28,243 --> 00:56:30,587
George, there is nothing
wrong with this place.

945
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,476
Almost all the same I think?

946
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:32,936
Well ...

947
00:56:33,476 --> 00:56:34,636
think that ...

948
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:36,698
wait to see the others.

949
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:38,838
The work we do here is excellent.

950
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:41,614
No control
programming or brain washed.

951
00:56:41,614 --> 00:56:42,784
Only the love of Christ.

952
00:56:42,784 --> 00:56:43,424
Sorry.

953
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:45,707
My wife did not want to say that.

954
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:50,207
We are all warriors for Jesus,
I wish you luck in your search.

955
00:56:50,715 --> 00:56:51,465
Good luck.

956
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,369
hate these dances.

957
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,686
I just ...

958
00:56:56,686 --> 00:57:00,114
I do not understand because we can not
learn to socialize ourselves.

959
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:02,427
And I do not like girls.

960
00:57:02,427 --> 00:57:04,703
I like you,
enough, just ...

961
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:06,403
these rituals forced ...

962
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,091
"Do this now"

963
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:09,904
"undoubtedly"

964
00:57:09,904 --> 00:57:12,044
"around the room here we go."

965
00:57:13,091 --> 00:57:16,433
Are not very
disappointed if you see me dance.

966
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:17,615
This is what I mean.

967
00:57:17,615 --> 00:57:19,148
Not that I do not know dance.

968
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:19,718
I know.

969
00:57:19,952 --> 00:57:21,692
Do not look in that direction

970
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:24,847
can dance,
not only with women.

971
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,140
Not with these women.

972
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:32,675
I hate when I look well.

973
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:33,845
Very tough.

974
00:57:34,186 --> 00:57:35,522
Do not put the cards on the table.

975
00:57:35,522 --> 00:57:36,342
Too ...

976
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:39,877
Little contact with
their true emotions.

977
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:42,360
Try to
tricks to survive.

978
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,350
and beaten regularly,

979
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,587
to fifteen years.

980
00:57:46,822 --> 00:57:48,502
To see what would work.

981
00:57:49,827 --> 00:57:50,167
Mark

982
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:52,059
Now that the roof is repaired

983
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:54,021
should spend more time with others.

984
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:54,771
Others?

985
00:57:55,192 --> 00:57:57,236
Well, I see you're fine with Scott, but ...

986
00:57:57,236 --> 00:57:59,216
I think Lester particular
will like to talk to you soon.

987
00:57:59,216 --> 00:57:59,676
Clear.

988
00:58:00,257 --> 00:58:00,752
He admires you.

989
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:02,022
I said yes.

990
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:03,755
Muy bien!

991
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:06,035
All ready for fun?

992
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:37,094
Thank you.

993
00:58:39,212 --> 00:58:42,712
Pastor, I knew that
we have sold six houses birds?

994
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:46,421
That's wonderful
for us and for the birds.

995
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:47,732
Well, you know what they say:

996
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,712
If they are built.

997
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,656
You did a good job.

998
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:52,402
And at the funeral.

999
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:53,617
I am happy for that.

1000
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:55,237
Your father would like.

1001
00:58:56,978 --> 00:58:58,643
A glass for friends.

1002
00:58:58,643 --> 00:58:59,333
For me?

1003
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:03,626
Scott told me you did
amazing things with the business.

1004
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:06,886
Probably not
say anything because of his father.

1005
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:09,063
There are not many secrets.

1006
00:59:18,274 --> 00:59:19,264
Want to dance?

1007
00:59:19,911 --> 00:59:20,721
Yeah, right.

1008
00:59:38,304 --> 00:59:40,110
This music is beautiful.
We have to dance.

1009
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,450
No.

1010
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,060
Come on!

1011
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:42,740
We have the stage and everything.

1012
01:00:59,134 --> 01:01:00,984
This is more ao meu gosto.

1013
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,321
Come on Daddy-Dancer.

1014
01:01:02,978 --> 01:01:03,438
Come on!

1015
01:01:03,547 --> 01:01:04,937
Okay, okay.

1016
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,781
It is shameful.

1017
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,909
The pastor is here.

1018
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:53,369
Gayle!

1019
01:01:54,248 --> 01:01:56,338
Do not make a scene, not today.

1020
01:01:57,244 --> 01:01:58,344
Do not do that.

1021
01:02:00,826 --> 01:02:02,956
While the pastor is looking

1022
01:02:02,956 --> 01:02:04,507
defendant should stop with that now.

1023
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:05,427
Stop what?

1024
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:07,785
You know what I'm talking about.

1025
01:02:07,785 --> 01:02:09,612
I said do not do this.

1026
01:02:09,612 --> 01:02:12,264
I do everything I need.

1027
01:02:12,264 --> 01:02:14,325
I'm tired of your games.

1028
01:02:14,325 --> 01:02:16,377
I thought it significábamos something for you.

1029
01:02:16,377 --> 01:02:19,358
That what we were getting
meant something.

1030
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:20,750
It is shameful what they are doing.

1031
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,640
So stop.

1032
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,322
Because you never like?

1033
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:23,959
Do not be ridiculous.

1034
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:24,791
No!
Why?

1035
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:25,191
Scott

1036
01:02:25,549 --> 01:02:27,107
is neither the time
or place for that.

1037
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:28,319
Ted, do not tell me
So to me, tell her.

1038
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:28,613
Scott!

1039
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:30,267
I wanted though
I would like Gayle,

1040
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:32,500
but I think I
does seem ridiculous to you.

1041
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,633
Let's relax.
We are all a bit tense here.

1042
01:02:34,633 --> 01:02:36,147
You encouraged this behavior.

1043
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:37,184
Gonna make a scene.

1044
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:38,713
Like when I
I stay well, not like you?

1045
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,173
Gayle!

1046
01:02:39,198 --> 01:02:39,878
What is it?

1047
01:02:41,418 --> 01:02:44,561
is because I am not breathing
crying on your shoulder?

1048
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:47,171
Or because I do not agree with your child?

1049
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,921
You do not have that right!

1050
01:02:53,747 --> 01:02:58,262
You are a wolf in sheep's clothing and I
I knew since I entered this house.

1051
01:02:58,262 --> 01:03:01,062
You never accept Jesus into your heart.

1052
01:03:01,551 --> 01:03:04,009
You were faking it all this time.

1053
01:03:04,009 --> 01:03:05,339
And now you see someone

1054
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:10,360
which seeks to find its
way you take advantage of their weakness.

1055
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,870
Sorry, you're asking me to go?

1056
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,230
I'm asking you.

1057
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:18,681
to stop!

1058
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,035
How is that again?

1059
01:04:01,498 --> 01:04:03,081
Hector gave me a ride, he ...

1060
01:04:03,081 --> 01:04:04,388
aAnne was to bring home y. ..

1061
01:04:04,388 --> 01:04:05,378
I went back to ...

1062
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,660
to catch.

1063
01:04:07,899 --> 01:04:08,419
Watch ...

1064
01:04:08,762 --> 01:04:09,982
calm, okay?

1065
01:04:10,122 --> 01:04:11,825
You can spend the night.
Tomorrow we can talk about ...

1066
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:12,165
No!

1067
01:04:12,278 --> 01:04:13,548
A shit!

1068
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:16,751
I do not think the time
it wasted my life!

1069
01:04:16,751 --> 01:04:18,071
In my ... I ...

1070
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:19,190
wasted in this place!

1071
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,887
You can make this work.

1072
01:04:20,887 --> 01:04:22,397
This is how it works.

1073
01:04:24,805 --> 01:04:26,135
Please do not go!

1074
01:04:26,728 --> 01:04:28,008
I have no choice.

1075
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:30,859
Can not feel it tomorrow, okay?

1076
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:32,879
It's not what I mean.

1077
01:04:34,149 --> 01:04:35,573
I know you're
accustomed to having what you want Mark.

1078
01:04:35,573 --> 01:04:37,213
But you can not have both.

1079
01:04:37,213 --> 01:04:38,483
That is not fair!

1080
01:04:39,317 --> 01:04:41,681
OK, I finally feel
good to me.

1081
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:44,641
This place is good,
these people are good!

1082
01:04:45,072 --> 01:04:48,272
I feel God through me.

1083
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:51,982
This thing happened
among us, not their plan.

1084
01:04:51,982 --> 01:04:53,492
You sure about that?

1085
01:04:56,457 --> 01:04:58,907
You can leave me at that door.

1086
01:05:07,706 --> 01:05:08,806
Good luck Mark.

1087
01:05:16,571 --> 01:05:19,121
Gayle is afraid to ride Scott.

1088
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:23,452
That was why she acted that way.

1089
01:05:24,596 --> 01:05:26,796
She did what she had to do.

1090
01:05:29,742 --> 01:05:30,492
You love him?

1091
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:32,479
What?

1092
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:33,703
No?

1093
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:38,240
You are in love with him?

1094
01:05:44,387 --> 01:05:45,487
Go back to sleep.

1095
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:52,784
Gayle and I saw this before, but ...

1096
01:05:54,754 --> 01:05:55,964
this was the worst.

1097
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,600
She manages to be ...

1098
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,182
which is the word?

1099
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:05,838
Ferocious!

1100
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,687
That was what I saw in it

1101
01:06:10,038 --> 01:06:11,848
know before.

1102
01:06:12,284 --> 01:06:13,384
It was at a retreat.

1103
01:06:14,913 --> 01:06:17,533
At that time took six months sober.

1104
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:19,332
She offered me work.

1105
01:06:19,332 --> 01:06:21,494
I needed the job, I accepted.

1106
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:23,035
Were known.

1107
01:06:23,035 --> 01:06:25,295
But Ryan was his weak point.

1108
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:30,492
She thought the
being gay was the problem.

1109
01:06:30,492 --> 01:06:33,062
When correcting this, the boy corrected.

1110
01:06:34,885 --> 01:06:36,755
The Genesis did better.

1111
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,487
I am not convinced

1112
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,567
we are the only way. But ...

1113
01:06:44,365 --> 01:06:45,815
I know that helped.

1114
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:49,574
That I know.

1115
01:07:00,198 --> 01:07:01,298
Scott left.

1116
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:07,033
It was what I heard in the
road at midnight.

1117
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:08,193
The others know?

1118
01:07:09,376 --> 01:07:10,356
I think so.

1119
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,309
Is there anything else?

1120
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:20,937
Lydia is doing a
small brunch, I will help her.

1121
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:22,217
That would be gentle.

1122
01:07:23,283 --> 01:07:23,683
Mark?

1123
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:24,569
Hello.

1124
01:07:27,048 --> 01:07:28,198
I know it hurts.

1125
01:07:29,444 --> 01:07:30,664
But it would be.

1126
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:34,037
He is going to solve it!

1127
01:07:39,527 --> 01:07:41,801
And let us not fall into temptation;

1128
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:43,371
But deliver us from evil

1129
01:07:43,955 --> 01:07:45,353
because yours is the kingdom.

1130
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:46,853
The power and glory,

1131
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:49,392
For all eternity.

1132
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:49,822
Amen!

1133
01:07:52,384 --> 01:07:52,844
Well ...

1134
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:55,177
think at this time

1135
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,375
all know that Scott left us.

1136
01:07:59,852 --> 01:08:01,892
Someone wants to talk about that?

1137
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:13,693
I love!

1138
01:08:15,723 --> 01:08:17,473
Nobody seems to want more.

1139
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:22,613
I saw a friend who was
Good, now Look at him.

1140
01:08:22,613 --> 01:08:26,803
There are roads that lead to
error and lead to different ends.

1141
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:28,798
What does that mean?

1142
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:30,522
It is assumed that
will make us feel better?

1143
01:08:30,522 --> 01:08:31,162
Lester ...

1144
01:08:31,197 --> 01:08:34,001
No! I liked the way
that things were taking.

1145
01:08:34,001 --> 01:08:36,532
Is not a sin, like your love,

1146
01:08:36,532 --> 01:08:39,250
love is a wonderful experience

1147
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,350
and should be shared ¿verdad?

1148
01:08:41,648 --> 01:08:42,801
It was not what we teach?

1149
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:45,311
I understand how you feel Lester.

1150
01:08:45,849 --> 01:08:47,784
But living through someone
that is not God

1151
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:49,781
is the correct way
for a lifetime of sadness.

1152
01:08:49,781 --> 01:08:50,173
But they ...

1153
01:08:50,173 --> 01:08:50,693
Lester!

1154
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,300
She is right.

1155
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:28,778
You spent your shirts for the mass?

1156
01:10:28,778 --> 01:10:30,518
Not yet.
I have to go through.

1157
01:10:36,518 --> 01:10:39,103
Do not forget,
Mark tomorrow to read.

1158
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,203
I forgot.

1159
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,770
We have the room to the night.

1160
01:10:49,005 --> 01:10:49,525
Well ...

1161
01:10:50,473 --> 01:10:51,573
is at home.

1162
01:10:53,063 --> 01:10:55,986
Maybe we can
repeat this one of those days.

1163
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:56,966
I think not.

1164
01:10:58,032 --> 01:10:59,707
Look, is not about you.

1165
01:10:59,707 --> 01:11:00,347
Just ...

1166
01:11:01,309 --> 01:11:02,989
You have someone at home.

1167
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:08,133
It is a little more complicated than that.

1168
01:11:09,074 --> 01:11:11,764
I heard that you are quarentones.

1169
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,484
Until then have plenty of time for that ...

1170
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:16,704
do not worry.

1171
01:12:20,514 --> 01:12:23,834
Reading is the
First Epistle to the Corinthians.

1172
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:29,074
Though I speak the languages
of men and of angels,

1173
01:12:29,074 --> 01:12:30,464
and do not have love,

1174
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:33,071
it sounds like metal,

1175
01:12:33,118 --> 01:12:34,908
or like the bell that tine.

1176
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:37,631
When I was a child,

1177
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:39,432
I spoke like a child,

1178
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:41,822
I felt like a child,

1179
01:12:42,782 --> 01:12:44,302
I thought like a child;

1180
01:12:45,476 --> 01:12:47,686
But when I became a man,

1181
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:50,057
I ended up with things as a child.

1182
01:12:50,473 --> 01:12:52,663
Because now we see in the mirror,

1183
01:12:52,663 --> 01:12:53,413
an enigma,

1184
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:55,433
but then

1185
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:56,475
face ...

1186
01:12:59,715 --> 01:13:00,635
face to face;

1187
01:13:02,592 --> 01:13:04,222
Now I know in part,

1188
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:06,650
but eventually met

1189
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,714
as also I am known.

1190
01:13:09,912 --> 01:13:10,782
And now,

1191
01:13:11,505 --> 01:13:12,665
remains the faith

1192
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:14,075
hope

1193
01:13:14,376 --> 01:13:15,116
and love

1194
01:13:16,744 --> 01:13:17,554
these three;

1195
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,944
but the greatest of these is love.

1196
01:13:25,274 --> 01:13:25,914
Thank you.

1197
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:50,701
Creis you that she thinks the same?

1198
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:52,449
She seemed proud, are not?

1199
01:13:52,449 --> 01:13:55,829
Maxine looks at me
many times that way.

1200
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:58,398
I will say one thing I know
here seems strange coming from me,

1201
01:13:58,398 --> 01:14:00,018
but I will say the same.

1202
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:04,096
I believe that Jesus
made this all possible.

1203
01:14:04,518 --> 01:14:07,135
I mean, I know
Gayle has more credence in that,

1204
01:14:07,135 --> 01:14:09,806
but I think I really
I caught the ball and tag, right?

1205
01:14:09,806 --> 01:14:10,906
Yes, it's true.

1206
01:14:11,425 --> 01:14:13,235
oventa days sober today.

1207
01:14:14,457 --> 01:14:16,027
Praised be the Lord.

1208
01:14:17,048 --> 01:14:18,618
Praised be the Lord.

1209
01:14:48,522 --> 01:14:48,982
Crap!

1210
01:14:49,835 --> 01:14:50,535
Relief!

1211
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:52,401
Relief!

1212
01:14:52,778 --> 01:14:53,878
Call 112!

1213
01:14:54,682 --> 01:14:55,502
Help me!

1214
01:14:58,747 --> 01:15:00,695
Call 112
and request an ambulance!

1215
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:01,095
Ya!

1216
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:09,190
Lester was!
I called 112.

1217
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,780
Jesus Christ!

1218
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:15,064
How long it takes so?

1219
01:15:15,064 --> 01:15:15,694
Not!

1220
01:15:19,482 --> 01:15:21,811
Lester get hear me?
Okay?

1221
01:15:21,811 --> 01:15:24,661
Ó Dios mio! Do something, please.

1222
01:15:25,051 --> 01:15:26,501
Do not let die.

1223
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,300
Mark!

1224
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:30,713
Mark!
For!

1225
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,570
Reach!

1226
01:16:33,933 --> 01:16:34,623
Reach.

1227
01:16:44,718 --> 01:16:45,758
It's all good.

1228
01:16:50,897 --> 01:16:51,587
All right.

1229
01:17:12,725 --> 01:17:14,616
So What Happens Now?

1230
01:17:14,616 --> 01:17:15,716
You will return?

1231
01:17:17,918 --> 01:17:20,768
Well, I have no where to go next.

1232
01:17:24,902 --> 01:17:26,942
I have to shuffle things.

1233
01:17:31,962 --> 01:17:33,362
Why did this?

1234
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:35,298
Not.

1235
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,439
Many reasons, but ...

1236
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:42,499
when I saw them together ...

1237
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:48,547
and you looked so happy, only
wanted to see two men taking it.

1238
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,540
Able to share that.

1239
01:17:52,703 --> 01:17:56,063
I know that is not correct
say, but ...

1240
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:01,046
I think not
consegiría live differently.

1241
01:18:01,046 --> 01:18:01,866
Excuse me.

1242
01:18:14,988 --> 01:18:17,538
Qeu are you going to do with this place?

1243
01:18:18,874 --> 01:18:19,914
Scotty does not know

1244
01:18:21,162 --> 01:18:23,032
wanted to be proud.

1245
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:28,532
Gave me a chance when all
the world thought I was not observant.

1246
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,323
You know that he was
proud of you too, right?

1247
01:18:32,323 --> 01:18:32,663
If.

1248
01:18:35,184 --> 01:18:36,744
How goes it?

1249
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:38,456
The what?

1250
01:18:38,968 --> 01:18:39,368
This.

1251
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:43,858
Well ...

1252
01:18:44,606 --> 01:18:45,648
If you have not noticed,

1253
01:18:45,648 --> 01:18:47,581
I do not think
a Cooper or a son.

1254
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:48,331
That is changing.

1255
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:50,267
If you want yours.

1256
01:18:52,652 --> 01:18:53,692
You serious?

1257
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:54,382
If.

1258
01:18:57,267 --> 01:18:58,767
Do not know what to say.

1259
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:01,711
Talk to Anne.

1260
01:19:02,551 --> 01:19:04,821
Gonna leave the city or similar?

1261
01:19:05,568 --> 01:19:06,558
Let's say ...

1262
01:19:07,094 --> 01:19:09,014
there are things greater than ourselves.

1263
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:34,661
Jude phoned me.

1264
01:20:36,724 --> 01:20:41,512
I'm surprised I did not
've counted what happened with Lester.

1265
01:20:41,512 --> 01:20:44,252
Gayle blame me because of him too?

1266
01:20:45,168 --> 01:20:46,601
She was disturbed.

1267
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:48,121
Mean stubborn.

1268
01:20:50,039 --> 01:20:51,959
He came here to correct me?

1269
01:20:52,069 --> 01:20:52,409
No.

1270
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:58,640
I came here to see you.
To learn how you are.

1271
01:21:00,468 --> 01:21:02,678
But it seems you are very good.

1272
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:06,647
Lester returned.

1273
01:21:08,224 --> 01:21:08,564
If.

1274
01:21:09,862 --> 01:21:10,782
Yes, I know.

1275
01:21:15,362 --> 01:21:15,762
Mark?

1276
01:21:17,961 --> 01:21:18,301
Yes?

1277
01:21:19,502 --> 01:21:20,782
It is better to come.

1278
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:22,914
I'm going now.

1279
01:21:26,613 --> 01:21:27,423
I will go.

1280
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:32,858
I will try to Arizona
some time, perhaps Los Angeles.

1281
01:21:32,858 --> 01:21:33,318
Really?

1282
01:21:44,679 --> 01:21:45,789
Vines to dismiss me.

1283
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:46,798
Okay.

1284
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:48,186
And there ...

1285
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:50,749
something important

1286
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:53,481
I want to know Gayle.

1287
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,072
I'm not shattered.

1288
01:21:59,828 --> 01:22:01,970
I do not know because some
time expected to change.

1289
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:05,518
If a man lies with another
as if man slept with a woman

1290
01:22:05,518 --> 01:22:09,123
both have committed an abomination
and both should be sentenced to death.

1291
01:22:09,123 --> 01:22:09,523
For!

1292
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:10,902
There are four more than before,

1293
01:22:10,902 --> 01:22:11,710
but this is the case,

1294
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:15,839
any person who cursed her
father or mother should be sentenced to death!

1295
01:22:15,839 --> 01:22:17,180
This is not a game Scott.

1296
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:18,487
God is not a game!

1297
01:22:18,487 --> 01:22:20,345
Ever seen those words?

1298
01:22:20,345 --> 01:22:22,846
Gayle, Jesus never said
nothing about homosexuality.

1299
01:22:22,846 --> 01:22:24,912
Not negotiated the path of salvation.

1300
01:22:24,912 --> 01:22:25,782
Goodbye Scott.

1301
01:22:26,063 --> 01:22:28,138
ever looked at yourself?

1302
01:22:28,138 --> 01:22:30,238
I mean, not kids

1303
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:32,443
but look, with no middle.

1304
01:22:32,443 --> 01:22:34,303
Why are you doing this?

1305
01:22:35,262 --> 01:22:37,462
That gives you the right
to accuse me of anything?

1306
01:22:37,462 --> 01:22:37,922
Gayle,

1307
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:40,101
is not as strong as thought.

1308
01:22:40,101 --> 01:22:42,301
And if you're not really giving,

1309
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:44,920
unable to cope with the confusion.

1310
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,844
Things have to be
clean and clear for you, but

1311
01:22:46,844 --> 01:22:48,284
Life is not so.

1312
01:22:49,862 --> 01:22:51,181
I do not know what it is.

1313
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:52,521
Bringing a child.

1314
01:22:54,274 --> 01:22:57,177
But I know what it is to have parents so full of hate

1315
01:22:57,177 --> 01:22:57,927
dying

1316
01:22:59,069 --> 01:22:59,889
cursing

1317
01:23:00,097 --> 01:23:01,247
instead of love.

1318
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:05,312
Is this what you really think?

1319
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:08,390
sincerely believe
you can convince me?

1320
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:10,221
You get to discuss with me

1321
01:23:10,221 --> 01:23:13,871
and change my mind
on what should be correct?

1322
01:23:14,765 --> 01:23:16,725
I know that love is real.

1323
01:23:18,753 --> 01:23:20,593
I know that love is good.

1324
01:23:24,218 --> 01:23:25,558
Mark, let's go.

1325
01:23:30,974 --> 01:23:31,374
Mark?

1326
01:23:37,735 --> 01:23:40,475
Gayle when I was with Lester

1327
01:23:43,327 --> 01:23:45,767
I felt I was clinging love.

1328
01:23:46,907 --> 01:23:48,587
I felt the love he had.

1329
01:23:51,846 --> 01:23:54,406
I felt every time he came.

1330
01:23:57,242 --> 01:23:58,642
I found something here.

1331
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:03,603
But is no longer here.

1332
01:24:04,432 --> 01:24:05,822
That is not true.

1333
01:24:06,299 --> 01:24:08,849
Nothing but love for you here.

1334
01:24:08,933 --> 01:24:10,771
In my heart,
all our hearts,

1335
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:12,401
I noticed that.

1336
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:16,142
In your fault
remember as you were sick?

1337
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:18,918
They do not want it
happen again, ¿verdad?

1338
01:24:18,918 --> 01:24:19,728
Think about it

1339
01:24:20,965 --> 01:24:22,245
as far as you can.

1340
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:25,370
Do not miss the course, you have light.

1341
01:24:25,758 --> 01:24:26,458
Remember

1342
01:24:27,275 --> 01:24:29,389
what we said that day in the car?

1343
01:24:29,389 --> 01:24:30,959
When we left the two?

1344
01:24:31,559 --> 01:24:33,429
Remember what feel?

1345
01:24:38,539 --> 01:24:39,049
I was

1346
01:24:39,454 --> 01:24:40,314
who you are.

1347
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,350
I know how to stay safe.

1348
01:24:45,417 --> 01:24:45,877
Gayle?

1349
01:24:47,521 --> 01:24:48,971
Ted is out of this.

1350
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,656
You have to let go.

1351
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:52,976
He is not Ryan.

1352
01:24:53,116 --> 01:24:54,156
Ryan died.

1353
01:24:54,481 --> 01:24:56,308
This is the sin I can not
let these small guys.

1354
01:24:56,308 --> 01:24:57,694
You can not save Gayle.

1355
01:24:57,694 --> 01:24:59,757
He has to do for himself

1356
01:24:59,757 --> 01:25:00,567
let it go.

1357
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:02,387
Let this happen?

1358
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:04,881
You look and let this happen!

1359
01:25:05,677 --> 01:25:07,187
Maybe you've done.

1360
01:25:10,656 --> 01:25:11,696
It's all good.

1361
01:25:15,389 --> 01:25:16,429
It's all good.

1362
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:18,659
Forget the past.

1363
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:22,580
Come on.

1364
01:25:36,017 --> 01:25:40,097
I need some
staff time to say goodbye.

1365
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:41,084
If.

1366
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:56,187
The answer is believing
there are consequences in this world.

1367
01:25:56,187 --> 01:25:59,590
And the judge of our actions, however much
we like to believe that we,

1368
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:00,160
is God.

1369
01:26:02,759 --> 01:26:04,858
Genesis is an expression of my faith.

1370
01:26:04,858 --> 01:26:06,412
The work of my life.

1371
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:12,012
Attempts to justify myself
to my son through my work there.

1372
01:26:14,804 --> 01:26:15,324
Ryan ...

1373
01:26:19,697 --> 01:26:23,256
Ryan came to me
when I was 16 and said:

1374
01:26:23,256 --> 01:26:24,176
I was gay,

1375
01:26:24,944 --> 01:26:27,920
said she did not want to change,
she did not want to live according to the Lord,

1376
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:34,040
and I told him to leave my house,
because they would not accept it under my roof.

1377
01:26:38,935 --> 01:26:41,205
And five months after he died.

1378
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:49,689
The day I told him to go
was the last time I saw my son.

1379
01:26:53,112 --> 01:26:56,172
I know I never
I will have more back.

1380
01:26:58,081 --> 01:27:00,411
If I can help a child ...

1381
01:27:00,427 --> 01:27:05,547
out of their misery, I will
everything in my power to achieve that.

1382
01:27:07,747 --> 01:27:10,777
Ryan showed me
only their weaknesses.

1383
01:27:13,112 --> 01:27:17,542
I knew there was a
child full of love in one package.

1384
01:27:18,345 --> 01:27:20,553
And despite being able to see it.

1385
01:27:20,553 --> 01:27:25,223
Through trial and disgust,
what I would have loved as Christ loved.

1386
01:27:26,642 --> 01:27:28,682
It could have been another.

1387
01:27:30,872 --> 01:27:32,672
Could have stayed home.

1388
01:27:35,863 --> 01:27:39,703
And over time could
have worked in his salvation.

1389
01:27:44,868 --> 01:27:45,738
But now ...

1390
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:49,571
I have the opportunity to save others.

1391
01:27:51,059 --> 01:27:52,149
And myself.

1392
01:28:01,386 --> 01:28:04,166
How I want to pass the check?

1393
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:57,042
I felt invisible until ...

1394
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:10,589
Mark?

1395
01:29:24,437 --> 01:29:26,417
May the Lord be with you.

1396
01:29:29,921 --> 01:29:30,611
He is.

1397
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,490
He is!

1398
01:30:55,632 --> 01:30:56,332
Welcome.

1399
01:30:56,607 --> 01:30:58,054
Welcome back John.

1400
01:30:58,054 --> 01:31:00,154
Welcome back to Genesis.

1401
01:31:03,066 --> 01:31:05,226
Demigod 666
