The shape of the pelvic bones
rules out childbirth as the cause...

Or not that long of a story.

879

- No, not at all.

Sure.

Excuse me, sir?

Hi. Greta?

903
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,194
Um, I'm really sorry.

908
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,005
No, actually, I'm coming home,
from Turkey.

00:58:54,714 --> 00:58:57,994
That's an interesting

It's people you need a manual for.

Um, lan asked me to dinner.

920
00:59:42,895 --> 00:59:45,131
I mean, I can be so
dense sometimes.

921
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:48,368
I didn't even know
that he liked me that way.

Did you?
- No.

923
00:59:51,437 --> 00:59:54,440
But, then again,
I can be pretty dense too so...

00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,400

something to you...

and he's really nice, and...

929

...he's really real.
For an actor, anyway.

I just thought, why
not give it a chance?

931
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:17,818
We have so much
in common anyway,

932
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:19,918

a dress rehearsal.

What is it, Carmen?
What's going on?

1238
01:20:03,546 --> 01:20:05,747
It's my mom. She just
went into labor early,

1239
01:20:05,847 --> 01:20:07,383
and I can't be at the hospital.

...to understand these
things that you...

01:25:40,014 --> 01:25:42,894
and I were never able to talk about.

01:25:43,152 --> 01:25:47,022
And what are these things

01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:50,322
That you loved Mom
more than I ever knew.

1335
01:25:52,862 --> 01:25:55,422

No one could have.

01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:01,735
It's just who she was.

If we're gonna get
through this, Dad...

1339
01:26:05,808 --> 01:26:09,888
...we have to start
taking care of each other, okay?

1340
01:26:12,348 --> 01:26:13,739
Don't you think that...

1341
01:26:13,839 --> 01:26:15,918
that's what she
would have wanted?

1342
01:26:16,018 --> 01:26:17,720
Yeah.

...I think I felt a little more
than I bargained for.

1349
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:27,833
Maybe I thought I
was being punished...

1350
01:28:28,817 --> 01:28:30,817
...for feeling too much.

1351
01:28:32,621 --> 01:28:35,501
Why didn't you just
talk to me, Tib?

1352

Because I can't lie to you
as well as I can lie to myself.

I've only seen pictures,
but it totally looks like him.

He's hot.
- Everyone, be calm, okay?

1566
01:43:09,664 --> 01:43:10,765
I'll do the talking.

No.
- What?

1568

Well, that's okay.

leaving tomorrow.

Yes.

1584
01:44:11,626 --> 01:44:13,645
I got into the graduate program...

It's called a 'sailor's moon.'

you good luck, eh?

Nothing happened.

Wait. That's why you guys
were acting so weird?

We didn't come to Greece
just for the pants.

1612
01:46:12,780 --> 01:46:15,984
Wait, I don't believe this.
Why would you guys lie to me?

1613
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:19,587
Because, Lena, we knew you
couldn't do it on your own.

And why didn't you tell us that
Kostos wasn't married, Lena?

1615

Why can't you just stop
thinking about it...

...and follow your heart?
- Because he broke my heart. He...
