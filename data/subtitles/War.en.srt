Hard to kill this son of bitch..

36
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:33,700
What're you talking about, John?
You sound like you know this guy.

37
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:38,805
Nah. Just talk to you cause
l'm a real independent contractor...

38
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:40,206
to deal with the trance.

39
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,110
Suppose to be the best.

40
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,913
Same gunner that ClA
used to encounter that time.

41
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,915
Yeah... same guy that turn on this
handlers and killed 3 agents.

42
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:51,918
l heard it was 5.

43
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,120
lt's bullshit story, John.
You know that, alright?

44
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,223
Those are phantom. He's a myth.

45
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:57,825
Some of the agents can't get a change.

46
00:04:57,824 --> 00:05:00,827
That's if he shows,
this bullet's his signature.

47
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:07,434
Do you really think Rogue
was working for Yakuza?

48
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:11,337
That's the trouble in this business.

49
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:13,740
You never know who's working for who.

50
00:05:17,344 --> 00:05:19,046
This is the San Francisco police.

51
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:21,447
Remain where you are
with your hands in the air.

52
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,168
Yep. He's right here.
He's right here, John.

00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,570
See you soon. Okay, bye-bye.

54
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:51,777
You tell him that he cannot smoke
in front of the kids!

55
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:54,980
lf he's going to smoke
he can do it in the yard.

56
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,782
Okay.

57
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:58,885
Go play.

58
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,586
l thought he was quitting anyway.
-l thought he was too.

59
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:03,589
Yo, Tom!
-Gotcha!

60
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:09,695
You better be on the road.
Jam starts at 8:30.

61
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:11,997
l'm working on what the hell it is.

62
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:15,000
See if you got any traffic,
we'll make it behind after.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,401
John.

64
00:06:17,403 --> 00:06:19,005
Smoke fixation.

65
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,707
Hey, come on. Get your coat.

66
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,311
So, how's the case going?

67
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,114
Don't forget about the case.

68
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,615
John, you're on sick leave.

69
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,519
No. lnvestigations are on the way.
So far it's zip.

70
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,721
Somebody talked to him. Somebody inside.

71
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,523
Close to us.

72
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,525
And they know what happened to Rogue?

73
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,626
No, they never found the body.

74
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:42,628
They drag that pave for 3 days
and nothing.

75
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,530
And he's fisher by now.

76
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,234
Okay. Well, you scanned there, right?

77
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:51,337
Yeah. l've done this. Just tell me
how to forgot these things, okay?

78
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:53,840
Alright, so l didn't forget these things.

00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:51,296

Asian Organized Crime Unit.

Who's the authority?
-Mayor? President? Take your pick.

124
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:56,817
You don't look very Asian to me.

125
00:14:57,618 --> 00:15:00,621

We found him hiding underneath
one of the dead bodies.

131
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:13,734
He's in pretty bad shape.

132
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,236

00:15:15,235 --> 00:15:16,937
You can't right?

Who could understand all that shit?

135
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,541
These people come in to this country.

136
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,144
Think they'd at least learn
to speak American.

137
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:25,545
l think a couple of cops,
work in this district...

138
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:28,149
that close to Yakuza must learn
to speak a little Japanese.

139
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:31,651
lf they weren't
complete fucking idiots...

140
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:34,855

Hey! You can't do that!

155
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,303
...before he comes back.

156
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:31,711
Well, l see it's gonna be a real picnic

So what do you say?

161
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:48,127
A bunch of Japanese mumbo-jumbo.

162
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,629
There's no spirits.

163
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:57,136
Those stories.

164
00:17:46,486 --> 00:17:47,687

00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,390
You haven't wake up?

00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,712
The guy who killed Tom.

00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:15,915
He's back. l can feel it.

177
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:19,018
This time l'm taking him down.

178
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,920

Tell Daniel l'll be there.
-No! You tell him.

182
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,832
lf you say you're gonna be there,
then be there.

183
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:02,160
Those of you who didn't get to meet
last night, this is Agent Goi.

184
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,062
Just graduated in Chronicle.

185
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:07,265
What's his aspects?

186
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:08,666
Oarsman.

187
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:11,169
What's so funny?

188
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,372
How the way you expect here?

189
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:15,474
What are you?
-D.T

190
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:17,876
Defensive Tactics.

191
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:20,178
That's right.
l dig it up close in person.

192
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,881
Yeah. Well, my gun's bigger than yours.

193
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:24,383
Pick a desk.

194
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:26,784
Still get to sit your arse up.

195
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:29,287
Back there.

196
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:32,391
These are all the photos
anybody has of Rogue.

197
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:35,794
The guy work up his face every 6 months.

198
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:38,296
Come on, John.

199
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:40,598
Anybody can use titanium shields
and DU bullets.

200
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:41,900
Bullets found...

201
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,203
Bullets that we found last night
matches the ones we found 3 years ago.

202
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:49,608
Rogue's back.

203
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:52,310
Okay, if he works for the Yakuza...

204
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,512
Why would he kill Yakuza?

205
00:19:54,513 --> 00:19:57,216
Maybe he switch sides.
This won't be the first time.

206
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:59,417
Who're we talking about?

207
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:02,420
Shiro Yamaga.

208
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,422
He's all Yakuza activity from Japan.

209
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:06,625
Probably the most powerful man
in San Fancisco...

210
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,727
and he hasn't set foot on American soil.

211
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:12,931
Except for it wasn't this test force
was put together.

212
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:16,034
The Chang is on the left.
Like Chio Chang lives here.

213
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,236
Nice big mansion in Marin.

214
00:20:18,236 --> 00:20:20,438
lt's the Jade rock-a-fella or something.

215
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,543
He's a 49. Trial at Boston.

216
00:20:24,543 --> 00:20:25,744
lnto everything.

217
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:27,946
Bribery, extortion, murder, you name it.

218
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:31,349
30 years ago,
Shiro put in Chang's family.

219
00:20:31,348 --> 00:20:33,450
Just let the balls
to flood in to Hong Kong.

220
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,851
Wiped out the whole fucking clan.

221
00:20:35,352 --> 00:20:38,355
He spent the next 30 years selling
every ornament of Qing dynasty...

222
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:40,057
to collectors and museums.

223
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:42,359
Well, that slave now
is a couple of oasis.

224
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,663
Stash woods. Two of them.
About this big.

225
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:48,966
Word on the street is that Shiro
was looking for a buyer as we speak.

226
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,667
Chain lost of honor.

227
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,970
lt means more or less financial lost.

228
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,972
l don't care about the oasis.

229
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:56,974
l don't care about bloodlines
or ancient family feuds.

230
00:20:56,974 --> 00:20:59,877
But the first time in 3 years,
we got a real shiny clue.

231
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,280
All we have to do, ladies and gentlemen.

232
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,881
ls pull the fucking thread out.

233
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:06,643
CHANG MANSlON
MARlN COUNTY, CA

234
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:23,760
She's a very rare breed.

235
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,763
And delusion.

236
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,265
That's my wife, Maria.

237
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:34,470
ln my father's days, such reunion
when l have been possible.

238
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,572
But time's changed.

239
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,876
Those of us who change with it...
survive.

240
00:22:40,977 --> 00:22:42,679
Come.

241
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,383
l am really impressed, Mr. Sho.

242
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:49,886
l heard that you've spilt
the blood of my enemies.

243
00:22:51,688 --> 00:22:53,790
Let's drink.

244
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,492
To our new partnership.

245
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:03,099
l have to admit,

246
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,504
l was somewhat skeptical when you first
came to me with your proposal.

247
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:16,713
By living share a service,
that was a wise move on your part.

248
00:23:18,014 --> 00:23:20,216
But it makes me wonder.

249
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:25,422
How could one truly trust a man
who had betrayed his master?

250
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:28,024
l have no master.

251
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,026
So l have betrayed no one.

252
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:33,830
So, tell me.

253
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,433
My Horses, they arrive tonight?

254
00:23:40,637 --> 00:23:42,839
lt's been 30 years.

255
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,043
All this time, my family has lived
in shame and dishonor.

256
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:50,647
All because of Shiro's treachery.

257
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:53,850
Tonight, l will take back what was stolen
from my family.

258
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,552
And everything will change from here on.

259
00:23:56,953 --> 00:24:00,857
Shiro's men will protect his treasure
with their lives.

260
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,862
Are you certain... you can deliver them?

261
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:08,265
l said that l would.

262
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:11,868
These two are the Ti brothers.

263
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:14,270
They will give you everything you need.

264
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:18,774
l'll be in touch.

265
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:31,086
Watch him closely.

266
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:35,991
YAKUZA COMPOUND
TOHOKU, JAPAN

267
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,522
l beg your forgiveness.

268
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,729
The fault is not yours, but mine.

269
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,232
l left myself unguarded.

270
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:35,150
l trust you have news from San Francisco.

271
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,553
Yes, everything is proceeding
as requested.

272
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:39,855
And the Horses?

273
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,357
We've shipped them out.

274
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:44,059
They will arrive
in San Francisco tonight.

275
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,462
You must return to San Francisco...

276
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,662
...in advance of my arrival.

277
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:49,865
But Father...

278
00:25:49,865 --> 00:25:53,268
l don't trust our people there.

279
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,772
They have become too lazy to be useful.

280
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,975
l was hoping to stay here...

281
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:02,677
...and further my role in the clan.

282
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,181
Nothing in the history of our clan...

283
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:09,083
...has ever been more important.

284
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:11,085
l will not fail you.

285
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:14,789
Go now. Oversee the sale of the Horses.

286
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:27,101
CHlNATOWN, SAN FRANClSCO

287
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,822
Hey, what's up, dude?

288
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,924
l'd like to see Benny.

289
00:26:50,124 --> 00:26:51,626
No Benny's here.

290
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:10,044
Yeah. Again!

291
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,349
Hey baby.

292
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:20,855
We need to talk.

293
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:22,757
l don't talk to defense.

294
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,963
Someone glad. Now.

295
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:37,371
My guys lose in anyways.

296
00:28:00,594 --> 00:28:02,096
Business is good l see.

297
00:28:02,096 --> 00:28:04,097
Has the most for homerun security, right?

298
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:06,299
lt's the part of the family.

299
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,700
l bet that is fine.

300
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,403
lt's a gem. That's another story.

301
00:28:11,304 --> 00:28:13,506
You have every right there.
How did you fuck that up?

302
00:28:14,207 --> 00:28:16,409
lt wasn't hard.

303
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:18,711
Anyway. Thanks for the help.

304
00:28:19,512 --> 00:28:21,514
You make me look good.
-l hope it helps.

305
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:27,220
People out there didn't expect the FBl
pay me so good to something like this.

306
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,521
Makes me look the gym.

307
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,223
Was that the end to poor Hamburg?

308
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:31,124
Come on, John.

309
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:33,627
They know signs, catch and crooks.
You know that.

310
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:36,129
They just said you have something for me.
-Yeah.

311
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:43,337
Our friend over in Russels, the guy
who make those titanium bullets.

312
00:28:44,938 --> 00:28:47,541
Found him two days ago.

313
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:50,143
Now you'll have to check and see
if everyone on those association...

314
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:52,045
was wrong and having some bad luck.

315
00:28:55,648 --> 00:28:57,250
Just last week.

316
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,952
Plastic surgeon Dr. Paramount.

317
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:02,255
He has deadly buried himself for the
kitchen knife making a turkey sandiwch.

318
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:07,760
Week before that, another one of our
scrapper friend Donald Florida was killed

319
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:11,364
Some gangs. Can't see to read the signs.

320
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:13,766
Anyway.

321
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:16,670
These guys, they're both specialize
in facial reconstruction.

322
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:20,573
Both of them.

323
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,277
Mass ton of blue sense.

324
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:26,780
Yeah. Well, there's another surgeon
who's accounted for.

325
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,982
l think he might be still alive.
Maybe trying to get out.

326
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:33,587
You let me know this set of services...
and its money.

327
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:46,098
Button up, this isn't a disco.

328
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:51,805
ls that our contact?

329
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:54,608
Yes... my contact.

330
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:01,814
Get rid of him.

331
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,616
He's my brother. He's with me.

332
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:05,717
What the fuck this guy thinks he is?

333
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:12,324
Go back to the car.

334
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:15,227
Wu, please. He's an outsider.
-Go!

335
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:18,230
Don't make me say it again.

336
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:30,543
After this is done...

337
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,843
...you and l are going to talk.

338
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,655
The Horses are intact.
Shiro will be pleased.

339
00:30:43,655 --> 00:30:46,758
We'll contact you when we get there.

340
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:01,573
Are the Horses safe with this crew?

341
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:02,975
Of course, as far as they know...

342
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,677
...they're just delivering cars.

343
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:08,280
Lets go...

344
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,620
Stay calm and cooperate.

345
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:51,423
lt's just a routine check.

346
00:31:57,728 --> 00:31:59,230
l need you out of the car.
Both of you.

347
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,932
Put your hands where l can see them.

348
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:01,933
Oh, no, sir.

349
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,836
You're shooting on our enterprises.
You're making a huge mistake.

350
00:32:05,036 --> 00:32:07,138
We made the arrangements.
-Out of the car!

351
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:17,649
Turn around.

352
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:23,654
You're playing fire on us.
Who's your captain?

353
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:25,457
Shut up.
-Let go off us.

354
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:26,857
Shut up.

355
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:30,661
Fucking rent-a-cops...
-l said shut up.

356
00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:38,369
Did you check the entrance?

357
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:40,171
What the fuck is going on?

358
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:42,373
l thought we made arrangement.

359
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:45,076

lf it was it must've been important

379
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:45,755
There was only 1 thing that'll stop
this guy from falling down

00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:49,258
Cops

00:35:49,558 --> 00:35:51,460

425
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,566
You're to do nothing until he

The Horses have been stolen!

427

Look me in the eyes

473
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:16,220
Something real familiar about it

474
00:45:20,624 --> 00:45:23,327
lt's the 1 thing surgeons can't change,
can they?

475
00:45:23,827 --> 00:45:25,929
Your eyes

476
00:45:27,131 --> 00:45:29,734
What the hell do you know?

So, is the Yakuza looking for
the traits?

00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:56,460
Only if you understand me

482
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:00,764
The one you wanna follow wasn't it?

483
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:06,770

00:46:31,795 --> 00:46:33,497
Cabin that you burnt to the ground?

492
00:46:34,098 --> 00:46:36,200
And police still inside

00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:39,604
Remember that?

494
00:46:39,603 --> 00:46:41,405
Do you remember that?

495
00:46:43,107 --> 00:46:45,309
Say it

Crawford, there's nothing here.
He checks out

You've impressed me once again,

00:48:11,494 --> 00:48:13,596
The FBl had declared war on us

516
00:48:14,397 --> 00:48:15,798

547
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,205
You as me rite now

548
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:48,209
But i'm still the 1...

549
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,711
Who looks after things around here

550
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:55,015
And i remember in the world...
things change

551
00:52:07,528 --> 00:52:08,729
Triad Districy

552
00:52:08,729 --> 00:52:09,430
l say it again

553
00:52:15,736 --> 00:52:17,137
What the fuck?

554
00:52:27,248 --> 00:52:30,051
He fucking intrudes us, let's go!

555
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:33,554
..teach that fucking Jap a lesson

556
00:54:03,242 --> 00:54:04,744
You fucking bastard

557
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:06,546
l knew i should never have trusted you

558
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:42,681
This guy showed a signal

559
00:54:44,983 --> 00:54:46,384
So what now?

560
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:47,987
Take him for a walk

561
00:54:53,692 --> 00:54:55,694
So as he, that's all i asked

562
00:54:56,795 --> 00:54:59,298
We're gonna check Chang's
place in a minute

563
00:54:59,598 --> 00:55:01,700
Daniel, you can get us noticed

564
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,702
Kira, you go to house 16

565
00:55:04,202 --> 00:55:06,905
Wick and Goi, keep on the sides
of the house

566
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:09,208
We can lure that guy out

567
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:10,909
l think i know how to look thru a nite club

568
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:12,010
Keep your eyes up, everybody

569
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,312
We should go down somewhere and
be ready to move in in the call

570
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:19,617
The four are expecting us to retaliate

571
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:23,421
lf we strike now we risk everything
-What if it was your family?

572
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:25,924
What the fuck's wrong with you?

573
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:27,425
You forgot?

574
00:55:27,426 --> 00:55:29,428
Once it was my family?

575
00:55:30,128 --> 00:55:32,130
He was like a son to me

576
00:55:33,532 --> 00:55:35,334
Revenge's a must

577
00:55:36,234 --> 00:55:38,436
But you must be patient

578
00:55:38,437 --> 00:55:41,140
l'd allow nothing to put our family
at risk

579
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:45,543
l want you to do nothing

580
00:55:45,844 --> 00:55:47,446
ls that clear?

581
00:56:04,663 --> 00:56:07,366
Sure all knows it's the day coming
to an end

582
00:56:09,468 --> 00:56:11,070
And it's shown

583
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,174
More blood will be spilt before
this's over

584
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:19,378
Mr Shiro,

585
00:56:19,778 --> 00:56:21,479
l want your word

586
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:23,881
My wife and daughter'll be safe

587
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:28,486
No harm'll come to them

588
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,598
Chang'd never give up his own

589
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:47,305
But the owner of his family

590
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:57,415
Keep that

591
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:12,530

592
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,250

595
00:57:46,263 --> 00:57:46,864
Yo, heads up

596
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,566

597
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,709
Shit, call Crawford back,

598
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,219

He's dead
-Come on!

604
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:16,712

605
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:17,513

Drop your weapons!

609
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:42,137
Hands on the counter where
i can see them

610
01:00:49,044 --> 01:00:51,647
Situation secure,
units stand on cease fire

611
01:00:55,951 --> 01:00:57,953
Damn it, Goi, cease fucking fire!

Yes?

619
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:27,821
Wu and his boys shot up in Takada's
Tea House last nite

620
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:30,123
What?

621
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:31,524
Wu Ti?

622
01:05:31,525 --> 01:05:34,128

01:06:03,856 --> 01:06:07,159
Chang, his operation'll be destroyed

630
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,262
What more do you want?

631
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:18,571
Why?

632
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:21,774
