2
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,004
Good morning, sir!

3
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,154
Dicky Chow!

4
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,027
Just look at yourself.
You're covered in dirt.

5
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,393
- I just...
- Don't move!

6
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,160
And don't give me the usual routine.

7
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,096
Why are you always so untidy?

8
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,840
What's the matter, Mr. Cao?

9
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,008
Explain yourself!

10
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,277
Let me talk to him.

11
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,249
Where did the dirt come from, Dicky?

12
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:34,617
Well, on my way to school,
I slipped and fell over.

13
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,681
Don't your mom or dad
bring you to school?

14
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,926
Mom died a long time ago
and Dad's very busy.

15
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,423
What does your dad do?

16
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,925
He's a coolie.

17
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,104
I'd like to meet him one day.
Would that be possible?

18
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,644
I don't think he has the time.

19
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,204
When he's available, then.
Will you let me know?

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,475
Go clean up before class starts.

21
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,482
Thanks, Miss Yuen.

22
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,321
I want to be a superstar.

23
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,088
- Like who?
- Nicole Kidman.

24
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,458
She gets $20 million for a movie.

25
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,727
I wouldn't mind being her either.

26
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,267
I want to be an entrepreneur.

27
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,830
What kind of business?

28
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,306
Any kind, as long as it's really big.

29
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,775
Big business always pays out.

30
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,171
Why not?

31
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,417
I want to be a poor person.

32
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,691
Stop!

33
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,326
My dad says
if you have integrity...

34
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,698
...don't bullshit, don't fight,
and study really hard...

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,001
...then people will respect you
even if you're poor.

36
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,526
Don't...

37
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,795
Don't come over here!

38
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,295
Put it down!

39
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,899
Go back to your seat!

40
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:03,826
The name of this amazing dog is CJ1.

41
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:08,996
It was developed jointly by U.S.,
French and German scientists.

42
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,727
Imagine! Jointly developed!

43
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,599
- Do you want a go?
- Yes, please.

44
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,672
Back off, loser!

45
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,279
There are only two in the world.

46
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:25,645
The U.S. President's daughter
has the other one.

47
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,751
- What are you doing?
- Eating noodles.

48
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,423
Stand up!

49
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,759
No matter how much you eat,
you are doomed to be a dwarf.

50
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,590
Now get lost!

51
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:43,462
The quality of the students
in this place gets worse every day.

52
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,867
What have we here, another alien?

53
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,866
- What are you doing?
- Eating rice.

54
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,171
You're just like a huge tub of lard.

55
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,678
Maybe you should
go see the doctor.

56
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,478
You eat so much.
It's horrible!

57
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:05,055
Someone call the police
to shoot this monster!

58
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,022
Eat to death! Giant monster!

59
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,285
What are you doing?

60
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,428
Bullies! Heroes don't hit women.

61
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,972
Not you again!

62
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,575
Ignore him.

63
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,877
Go away, poor boy.
We don't want you around.

64
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,250
Go away, poor boy.

65
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,230
Hi.

66
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,765
Hi.

67
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,929
You've been sent off the field too?

68
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,002
Yes.

69
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,701
Did you forget your sneakers?

70
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,513
I brought them,
but I didn't wear them on purpose.

71
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,944
Why?

72
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,047
Because I wanted to be with you.

73
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,528
Are all your shoes like that?

74
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:23,531
Yes, they are.
My dad gets them from the dump.

75
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,703
Your dad's so nice.

76
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,304
He is, actually.

77
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,799
But I so much want a new pair...

78
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,138
...because I really love sports.

79
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,513
I'd like you to keep the old ones.

80
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,911
Why?

81
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,250
Then we'd be punished together,
forever.

82
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,941
Get that panel up there.

83
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,268
Quickly!

84
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,174
You. Hurry up.

85
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,296
You're no longer needed. Go home.

86
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,295
Hey, boss?

87
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:31,033
With it being so hot right now,
my son can't sleep.

88
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,966
I need to buy an electric fan.

89
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,469
Can't you keep me on?

90
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,666
You should be
paying me back instead.

91
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,574
I paid all the bills
when your wife got sick and died.

92
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,409
Look at yourself.
You'll die before your debts are repaid.

93
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,586
You're starving yourself so your son
can go to that fancy school.

94
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,348
If my son can go to public school,
why can't yours?

95
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,549
Well, I want him
to have opportunities.

96
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,523
I don't want him to end up like me.

97
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,890
But you have to have capability.

98
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,429
He's highly capable.

99
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,066
I'm talking about you, not him.

100
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,904
All you have is a casual job
with no prospects.

101
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,402
How are you going to cope?

102
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,031
- I can manage.
- You can't manage!

103
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,341
- I can.
- You can't!

104
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,775
I can manage.

105
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,448
Very well. Block B. Foundations.

106
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,080
Thanks.

107
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,424
If you want to die, I can't stop you.
Shame on you.

108
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,003
You're back.

109
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,971
Can we have dinner? I'm starving.

110
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,410
Just step back a bit.

111
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,913
- What's going on?
- Turn round.

112
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,501
Come here.

113
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,626
What?

114
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,772
An electric fan!

115
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,373
That's so great! Is it real?

116
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,271
We finally have a fan!

117
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,345
- Now sit down and let me turn it.
- Quickly, Dad!

118
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,216
Dad, did you find this
in the garbage?

119
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,118
No, I bought it.

120
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,192
It cost a lot of money.

121
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,691
You were ripped off!

122
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,796
No, it was fine when I bought it.

123
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,330
So how come it's not working now?

124
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,731
Dumbass.
Use your head next time.

125
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,906
"Dumbass"?
Where did you get that from?

126
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,335
A guy in my class.

127
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,475
Oh, really? Well, let me tell you...

128
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,144
...we may be poor,
but we don't use bad language.

129
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,076
We don't steal. We don't rob.

130
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,547
We don't take things
that don't belong to us.

131
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,586
You must concentrate
on your studies.

132
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:44,085
I didn't study at all when I was young
and look where it's gotten me.

133
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,217
We're having an apple today?

134
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,617
Yes, we are.

135
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,221
But put it down now.

136
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,920
Finish your dinner first.

137
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,697
Hey, Dad, my sneakers
are worn out again.

138
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,130
Will you buy me some more?

139
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,396
I need you to get me a better pair,
or I'll be sent off the field again.

140
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,441
Got it. Don't worry.

141
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,646
You're still eating!
Lay off the cockroach.

142
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,420
You can get it after you've finished.

143
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,657
Nice. You've improved.

144
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,731
Not bad.

145
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:07,163
<i>There have been many sightings lately</i>
<i>of UFOs, Unidentified Flying Objects.</i>

146
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,404
What happened to the can'toons?

147
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,872
They'll be back in a minute.

148
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,512
<i>Could you please tell us</i>
<i>what happened?</i>

149
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,238
<i>I saw a flying object.</i>

150
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,509
<i>It flew from here to there</i>
<i>with a "whew" sound.</i>

151
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,579
<i>Can you describe the object</i>
<i>in more detail?</i>

152
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,485
<i>That object could really fly!</i>

153
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,523
<i>Though it wobbled a bit.</i>

154
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,160
<i>I suspect it had crashed before.</i>

155
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,329
<i>Crashed?</i>

156
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,226
<i>Yes, like a car crash.</i>
<i>It might have been broken.</i>

157
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,264
<i>I took a picture of it.</i>

158
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,168
<i>What kind of camera did you use?</i>

159
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,280
<i>It was expensive,</i>
<i>but I can't possibly tell you the make.</i>

160
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,948
<i>Did this particular flying object</i>
<i>make a sound?</i>

161
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:57,020
<i>It made some "whew" sounds like I just</i>
<i>told you. "Whew." Do you hear me?</i>

162
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,058
Unbelievable.

163
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,636
Don't run off like that.

164
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,817
Dad, this is called a CJ1.

165
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,320
Everyone at school has one.
They're great!

166
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,487
Really?

167
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,824
Let's go home. Put it back.

168
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,295
What's the matter?

169
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,398
Why can't I have it?

170
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,667
We'll buy it
after I get paid next month.

171
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,003
Now, put it down.

172
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,150
Let go!

173
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,792
Didrt you hear me?
I have no money.

174
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,967
If you buy me this,
I'll never ask for anything ever again.

175
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,659
I beg you.

176
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,699
What about this one?
What features does it have?

177
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,672
Let go.

178
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,641
Let go!

179
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,879
Let go!

180
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,724
Let go!

181
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,654
Come back!

182
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,659
Sir? Do you wish to buy that?

183
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,246
Come on, Dicky. Don't cry.

184
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,387
Stop crying now.

185
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,055
Good boy, stop crying.

186
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,416
Dicky.

187
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,586
Are you Mr. Chow?

188
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,421
I'm Miss Yuen, Dicky's teacher.
Good to meet you.

189
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,029
Miss Yuen. Good to meet you too.

190
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,733
Is Dicky well-behaved at school?

191
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,994
Yes, he's quite good.

192
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,198
He's in a really bad mood right now.

193
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,000
I know.
Kids just want every toy they see.

194
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,176
True.

195
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,244
Just happens I didn't bring
any money today, so...

196
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,677
Dicky, go to your dad.

197
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,243
Come here.

198
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,454
- I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
- Don't worry. He's like that.

199
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,517
In fact, I'd like to do a home visit.

200
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,558
He did tell me,
but I'm very busy at work...

201
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,958
I believe that a good education
doesn't just rely on the teacher.

202
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,463
That's why I'd like to involve you.

203
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,225
It'll be good for him.

204
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,264
Ah, yes. I see.

205
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,638
Dicky, I need to go now.

206
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,809
Don't be so grumpy.
And listen to your dad, okay?

207
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,212
Okay?

208
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,143
- I must go.
- Okay.

209
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,910
- Bye, now.
- Bye, now.

210
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,236
Dicky.

211
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,968
Look at me.

212
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,809
I have something
way better than CJ1.

213
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,451
Do you want to see it?

214
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,458
Are you sure?

215
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,458
In that case, I'll throw it away
and get back to work.

216
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,173
Goodbye, sir.

217
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,440
Goodbye.

218
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:07,713
Fanny.

219
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,514
Where's this amazing toy, then?

220
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,985
Look!

221
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,398
What's so great about that?

222
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,863
It's fun. Look!

223
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:27,200
It doesn't look that fun to me.

224
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,497
What do you think?

225
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,565
Actually, I agree. It's no fun.

226
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,072
Never mind. See you tomorrow.

227
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,912
What's that thing you're holding?

228
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,485
Nothing.

229
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,916
It looks like rubbish.

230
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,418
Says who?

231
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,028
This is way better than CJ1.

232
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,491
So, what's it called?

233
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,502
It's called CJ7.

234
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,771
Pathetic piece of crap.

235
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:05,602
Your dad found it in the garbage.

236
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,512
Don't talk about my dad like that!
I'm going to beat you up.

237
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,745
Oh, yeah?

238
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,428
Hello.

239
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,468
How many times
do I have to tell you?

240
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,664
We might be poor,
but we don't fight.

241
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,674
You really disappoint me.

242
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:16,143
Look at this.
Your uniform's all torn.

243
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,171
What was the fight about?

244
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,349
They were laughing at me.

245
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,017
What about?

246
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,094
Well?

247
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,665
Fine.

248
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,306
If you're not going to tell me...

249
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,881
...then I have no choice
in the matter.

250
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,030
Last chance!

251
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,636
It's moving!

252
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,392
There are ghosts.

253
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,900
Ghosts? Where?

254
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:47,963
There. In the ball.

255
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:51,108
Don't change the subject!

256
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,577
You think you can run rings around me,
but you're not as clever as you think.

257
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,740
Your uniform's a mess. What will
you wear for school tomorrow?

258
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,454
Do I have to
go hunt for another one?

259
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,858
I'll deal with you later.

260
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,539
There's a ghost!
Hanging over there!

261
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,803
Help! Ghost! It's horrible!

262
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,313
There's a red ghost hanging there!

263
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,750
Hanging! Too horrible!

264
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,320
Calm down!

265
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,882
It's a broken lamp. Can't you see?

266
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,897
Not again!

267
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,570
You're a ghost too.

268
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:58,402
Stop shouting! I'll send you outside
if you don't stop! Understand?

269
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,509
Are you on drugs or something?

270
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,687
What are you doing?

271
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,552
Please don't lock me in!

272
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,854
There's a ghost.
You have to believe me.

273
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,156
Let me out!

274
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:59,667
Please let me out!

275
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,079
Help me, Lord.

276
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,456
- Learned your lesson now?
- Yes, Dad.

277
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:07,926
Will you behave yourself now?

278
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,793
I will. I really will.

279
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,494
I have to get back to work.

280
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,533
Okay! Off you go.
Bye!

281
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,179
Are you from outer space?

282
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,978
Have you come to invade Earth?

283
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:45,457
I think you might be
an alien toy dog.

284
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,614
My name is Dicky.

285
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,983
Can I call you CJ7?

286
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,889
If you wag your tail,
it means you like it!

287
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,795
CJ7!

288
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,377
The apples in our house
are always rotten.

289
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,316
So how come this one's not?

290
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,888
You know magic?

291
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,164
Wow! It's so sweet.
You really do know magic.

292
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,731
I'm going to be rich!

293
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:52,016
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on Earth...

294
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,592
...then you really are
a superdog from space.

295
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:57,818
Go!

296
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,120
Oh, my God!

297
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,737
I have a test today and I've been
playing with you instead of studying.

298
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:54,247
But I really want to get 100.
Can you help me?

299
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,267
What's that you're making?

300
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,141
Dicky Chow.

301
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,613
Why are you
wearing those glasses?

302
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,718
My eyes hurt.
Do you want to take a look?

303
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:33,049
No, I don't. Sit down.

304
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,159
Begin writing now!

305
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,834
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

306
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,973
A fly?

307
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,010
Sorry, sir. There was a fly.

308
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,320
I now have the results
of today's test.

309
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,330
And for the first time,
Dicky Chow got 100.

310
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,036
- Thank you, sir!
- Hold on a minute.

311
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,046
I want to see those glasses.

312
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,698
Those super-glasses were fantastic!

313
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,464
It's P.E. Next,
so I'll need super-sneakers!

314
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,040
This is so exciting.

315
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,052
Excellence at the high jump...

316
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,887
...requires talent, hard work...

317
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,394
...training, a good night's sleep...

318
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,532
...and finally,
respect for your teacher.

319
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,361
This is my personal record.

320
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,003
So far no one has bettered it.

321
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,111
I have new sneakers today, sir.

322
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,545
Sir! He just broke your record.

323
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:03,130
Dicky, it doesn't ring true
that a kid can jump that high.

324
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,935
Be a good boy and do it again.

325
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,551
Dicky Chow.
What are those shoes you're wearing?

326
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,153
It's none of your business!

327
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,721
This is too much.

328
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,789
You drove me to this.

329
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,982
Come down!

330
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,350
- Dicky! Are you out of your mind?
- I...

331
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,050
Over here. Catch him!

332
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,816
Come to your senses, Dicky.

333
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:12,889
Miss Yuen, bitterness, like the sea,
is boundless.

334
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,890
Dicky!

335
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,195
Dicky Chow! How can you jump
so high? Come down this minute!

336
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:59,533
How on earth
can you sleep like that?

337
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,408
Wake up. It's nearly time for school.

338
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:08,482
What do I have to do
to get you up in the morning?

339
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,113
It was all a dream?

340
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,384
You're real.

341
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,889
I'm getting ready right now!

342
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,801
Dad, I'm going to get 100
on the exam today.

343
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,171
What?

344
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,771
I'm going to get 100!

345
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:30,998
Really?

346
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,440
Yes! All on my own! 100!

347
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,175
That's great.

348
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:55,594
If you can beat
the most vicious dog on Earth...

349
00:43:55,799 --> 00:44:00,031
...then you really are
a superdog from space.

350
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,261
Go!

351
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:26,860
Run!

352
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,687
So, what happened back there?

353
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,254
You're supposed to be
the superdog from space.

354
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:00,555
Don't tell me
you were just pretending.

355
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,494
Seriously.

356
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,226
I have to get 100 on the exam.

357
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:10,396
I need you
to work your magic for me.

358
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,603
Come on, now. Please!
I'm not joking.

359
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,606
You have to give me
magic weapons.

360
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,008
Time's up.

361
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,914
What?
But I haven't started yet.

362
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,318
What's with the turd?

363
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,289
Turd? It's not that!

364
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,326
Shows how much you know!

365
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,204
You set me up!

366
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,608
I'm going to kill you!

367
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,048
Give me the magic weapons now!

368
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,997
Why, you...

369
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,169
You...

370
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,194
Please, sir. Can I say something?

371
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,863
No, you can't.

372
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,058
You are a poor student.

373
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,896
You are always dirty,
and you are very wicked.

374
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,538
You discredit the school.

375
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,537
There's nothing more to say.

376
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,603
Now clean him up!

377
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,547
CJ7?

378
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,950
Please come out.

379
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,625
Why would I be mad at you?

380
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,092
We're good friends.

381
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,768
The turd wasrt important.

382
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,230
I've seen it all before.

383
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,975
Let's just forget it ever happened.
Okay?

384
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,574
In fact, I love you very much.
Do you know that?

385
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,816
CJ7? Come here.

386
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,321
Closer!

387
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,934
I'm going to stab you to death!

388
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:09,603
Rubbish dog from space.
You're low-tech and boring.

389
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,681
I got blamed and laughed at.
And all because of you.

390
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:17,945
If you're just an animal, then say so!
Don't pretend you have magic powers!

391
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,350
But did it ever say that?

392
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,518
Did I get it wrong?

393
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,464
Have I made a mistake?

394
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,761
I know I've made a mistake!

395
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,618
Wait!

396
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,119
Hey! Wait!

397
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,720
Wait!

398
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,697
Dicky! What's happened?

399
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:12,033
CJ7 has disappeared.

400
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,813
Look.

401
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:25,388
CJ7?

402
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,221
I'm sorry. I missed you so much.

403
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:32,327
I thought I'd never see you again.

404
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,999
And you're not angry with me.

405
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,567
You two already met?

406
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,277
Is it a toy?

407
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,571
Yes, it is.

408
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:55,016
And it can walk and move its eyes?

409
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,515
Where did you get it?

410
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,347
Someone at school lent it to me.

411
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,949
Where's the cover?

412
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,287
Where do the batteries go?

413
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,191
It doesn't need them. It's high-tech.

414
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:12,126
I've never seen
anything like it before.

415
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,500
Did you see that?

416
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,697
Yes, I did.

417
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,844
It's all bendy.

418
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,704
Don't! I have to give it back soon.

419
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,143
It's fine.

420
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,840
- What are you doing, Dad?
- Nothing!

421
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:45,159
See, I told you it'd be fine.
It gets its shape back. Look!

422
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,699
This is fun.

423
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:50,168
No more squeezing it!
That's enough!

424
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,007
Everything is high-tech nowadays.

425
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,738
Basically there's no future
for uneducated people like us.

426
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:03,149
Dad, I don't want
to lie to you, so...

427
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,516
...CJ7 came out of the ball
you gave me.

428
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:09,021
It came from outer space.

429
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,685
How many times
do I have to tell you?

430
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:16,662
We might be poor, but we don't lie...

431
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,596
...we don't fight...

432
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,999
...and we don't take things
that don't belong to us.

433
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,436
Study hard and be a useful person
in the future.

434
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,912
It's so hot.

435
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:39,232
Well, I'll be... The hottest night
and it starts to work. Lucky, or what?

436
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,431
I'm off to school now.

437
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,578
- Have you got your lunch box?
- Yes, I have.

438
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,179
Hey. How was the exam?

439
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,546
How come your head's gone red?

440
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,921
You don't look so good today.

441
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,594
Didrt you sleep last night?

442
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,593
Get inside and go to sleep.

443
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,402
You! Stop!

444
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,333
What's that thing inside your bag?

445
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,836
Nothing.

446
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:13,242
I need to check your schoolbag!

447
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,206
What for?

448
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,574
I don't have to tell you that.

449
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,244
Let go!

450
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,287
What's that?

451
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,126
Let me see.

452
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,233
Give it to me! Let me see first!

453
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,563
Give it to me! Don't pull!

454
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,566
Get it!

455
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,092
What is this weird thing?

456
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,231
Don't touch it!
Give it back to me!

457
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:10,865
Get the tool box!

458
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,665
Open it up and look inside.

459
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,896
Here.

460
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,768
Let him go!

461
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,872
Can't do it.

462
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:24,546
Try this.

463
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,679
No! Don't do that!

464
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,178
It's not working.

465
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,753
How is that possible?

466
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,569
You won't do that to my thing!

467
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,137
So what? Going to hit me?

468
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,604
You won't know what's hit you!

469
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:04,151
Let him go!

470
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:13,986
You let him go.

471
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:15,926
You let me go first.

472
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,441
I don't want a fight.

473
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,728
Don't force me to do this!

474
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:52,652
Are you okay?

475
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,228
I'm fine. Thank you.

476
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:56,857
You're welcome.

477
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,499
What's going on here?

478
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,230
Why were you fighting? Tell me!

479
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:07,441
You're going to stand here
until you tell me!

480
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:13,812
CJ7!

481
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,014
I knew you'd be okay!

482
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,712
Stop. Don't.

483
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:21,891
Good boy.

484
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,389
What is that thing?

485
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,391
Look! CJ7, sit!

486
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,027
That's cool.

487
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,928
What else does it do?

488
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,534
CJ7, happy face!

489
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:35,734
Angry face!

490
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:37,673
Sad face!

491
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,734
Saw a pretty lady!

492
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,037
Your apartment's on fire.

493
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,341
But you just won the lottery!

494
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:51,250
Oops! The whole family is dead.

495
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,820
You've got 100 on the exam!

496
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,292
Wicked.

497
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,519
Look!

498
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,337
Wow, fireworks!

499
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:12,670
Where did you get it?

500
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,467
I want one too.

501
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:15,974
I can't tell you that.

502
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,342
But I want to thank you
for not telling Mr. Cao about this.

503
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,538
Of course not!

504
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,184
We don't discuss
our business with adults.

505
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,683
- You have my word!
- You have my word!

506
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,717
Hey, you're amazing.
Do you want to be on our judo team?

507
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:32,861
They'd all make fun of me.

508
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:34,723
They wouldn't dare.

509
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,694
Would you make fun of her?

510
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,582
Look at this.
My son got 100 on his exam.

511
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,847
That's a great kid!

512
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,251
Yes!

513
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,256
- Look!
- Get away!

514
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:08,191
He got 100.

515
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:13,767
Boss.
My kid got 100 on his exam.

516
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,000
So he cheated.

517
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:21,275
What makes you say that?

518
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:24,378
My sors really smart, but even
he can't pass without cheating.

519
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,378
So how can your son get 100?
Hard to believe, dickhead.

520
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,448
You're not serious.

521
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:36,415
Look at the ink. He got zero
and changed it to 100. He's a liar.

522
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,252
But he's not like that.
I know him better.

523
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:42,692
Your son cheated.

524
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,799
- I can't let you say that.
- He cheated!

525
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:46,764
I'll hit you if you say that again.

526
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,868
Your son cheated.

527
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,563
You hit me? Just you try!

528
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,584
Your son cheated!
You hit me?

529
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,722
You're fired!

530
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,651
Your son cheated!

531
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,780
Quick!

532
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,480
Get inside.

533
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,653
Tell the truth.
Did you cheat on your exam?

534
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:44,993
No, I didn't.

535
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:49,358
I think you got zero,
then altered it to 100. Is that right?

536
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,095
Yes.

537
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:57,300
But that's not the same as cheating.
I didn't want you to be disappointed.

538
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:58,997
What's wrong with you?

539
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:02,143
It's so tough
to send you to that school.

540
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:04,844
I'm sorry, Dad.

541
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,809
I'll say it again.
Even though we're poor...

542
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,382
Okay! I know!

543
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,679
You're so annoying.
Can you stop going on about it?

544
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,659
I changed it. So what?

545
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,907
If there's nothing else,
I'm leaving.

546
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,148
What are you doing?

547
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,720
Why are you taking my things?

548
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:50,859
If you can't work hard,
then you don't get to play.

549
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,755
- Give it back to me!
- No.

550
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,589
Why are you taking my stuff?

551
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:57,925
Why? Because I'm your father!
And I can!

552
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:01,103
You're bullying me.
I don't have a dad like you!

553
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,738
You always get zeros.
I don't have a son like you.

554
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,601
Leave me alone!

555
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,036
Say it again!

556
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,541
Leave me alone forever!

557
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,110
Okay!

558
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:15,609
If you can use your own brains
to get over 60...

559
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,513
...then I'll leave you alone forever!

560
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,244
- It's a deal!
- It's a deal!

561
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:22,184
I'm going to get that grade.
Just watch me!

562
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,622
We'll see about that, Zero Hero!

563
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:29,093
That's not fair! I'll show you!

564
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,698
Don't bother me anymore!

565
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,066
What are you looking at?

566
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,119
- Mr. Chow.
- Miss Yuen.

567
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,413
- Is something wrong? Please come in.
- I won't, thanks.

568
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,717
But Dicky forgot his lunch box today.
Could you see that he gets it?

569
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:59,121
Sure. Let me ask someone
to open the gate.

570
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:03,321
No, please don't. If his classmates
see me, he'll never live it down.

571
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:04,499
How come?

572
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,258
- I have to go.
- Wait.

573
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:10,094
Dicky told me everything.

574
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,399
He was just being temperamental.

575
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:15,736
If you'd allow it, he could
come to my house after school.

576
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,810
We can talk about what happened.

577
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,014
And there's another exam tomorrow,
so I can help him to review.

578
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,411
What do you think?

579
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,045
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

580
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:27,222
- You're welcome. It's nothing at all.
- I appreciate this so much.

581
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,187
- It's just a small thing. Nothing, really.
- It's not nothing.

582
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,519
The thing is...

583
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:35,356
I can't give him very much myself,
and that makes me feel very guilty.

584
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:39,694
But if you were to help him study,
I could never repay you.

585
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,004
You really don't have to.
It's the least I can do.

586
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,633
Then I'll leave him in your hands.

587
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,872
Sure. You just leave Dicky to me.

588
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,838
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

589
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,839
How's the boss feeling today?

590
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,415
You dare to come back?

591
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:31,085
I have to. I need to eat.

592
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,736
I know I have a big mouth,
but I think we understand each other.

593
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:57,935
What?

594
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:01,947
I shouldn't have said that
about your son. Let's forget it. Here.

595
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:04,519
Well...

596
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,284
- But he really did cheat.
- Who doesn't, sometimes?

597
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,084
The kid is very smart.
I know he'll be successful.

598
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,453
I pray to God that you're right.

599
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,595
So take it and buy him some candy.

600
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,094
Hey! This is far too much.

601
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:19,734
Use it for books, then. Or school fees.
But now get back to work.

602
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,804
Today must be my lucky day.

603
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,066
I thought you'd never pass.

604
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:03,705
Good.

605
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,498
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

606
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,403
What's happening?

607
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,543
Where's your safety belt?

608
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:43,775
What's going on here?

609
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,776
Help!

610
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,116
Give me your hand!

611
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:56,257
Reach out! Give me your hand!

612
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,595
Why haven't these been moved?

613
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,365
What was that? Hey! Be careful!

614
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:20,308
I'm so sorry.

615
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:24,042
Dicky, you have to come with me.

616
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,691
Is this your house, Dicky?

617
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,636
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat?

618
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,709
Dicky, I'm going
to tell you something.

619
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:18,189
There was a terrible accident,
and your dad passed away.

620
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:44,526
There are some things
we can't control. Do you understand?

621
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,229
Don't talk anymore, miss.
I want to sleep.

622
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,125
Please leave me.

623
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,760
Dicky, open the door.

624
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:55,125
I'm sorry.

625
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:56,634
Miss Yuen...

626
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,570
...l'm very tired.

627
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:06,075
I need to sleep.

628
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,117
Dicky.

629
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,148
My dad won't leave me alone.

630
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:21,656
He'll be home when I wake up.

631
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,299
I need to sleep now.

632
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:30,403
Dicky.

633
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,680
Dad.

634
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:42,260
Why aren't you in your pajamas?

635
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:57,440
Hey. What's up?

636
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:02,311
Dad, don't ever leave me.

637
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:09,419
I'll listen to you...

638
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,488
...l'll study hard...

639
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:12,921
...I won't bullshit...

640
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,561
...I won't fight...

641
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:18,255
...and one day
I'll be a really useful person.

642
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:21,133
That's good.

643
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:42,186
CJ7!

644
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,354
How are you?

645
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,760
What's that noise?

646
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:54,764
Yeah, what is it?

647
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,637
Why are you so tired, CJ7?

648
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,551
What's happened to him, Dad?

649
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,552
Maybe the batteries have run out.

650
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,664
It wouldn't look like that!

651
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,663
But it's very high-tech.

652
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,661
<i>The new term starts soon...</i>

653
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:39,527
<i>... and we have a picnic</i>
<i>before going back.</i>

654
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,861
<i>Everybody's very happy.</i>

655
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,502
<i>Storm Dragon</i>
<i>doesn't fight anymore...</i>

656
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,038
<i>... because he's fallen in love.</i>

657
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,016
<i>Maggie likes me best...</i>

658
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:09,395
<i>... but my love is Fanny.</i>

659
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,298
<i>And she loves me very much too!</i>

660
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,341
<i>Johnny always takes what's mine.</i>

661
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,671
<i>Maybe he'll stop</i>
<i>when I tell the teacher about him.</i>

662
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:30,009
<i>Every pupil has his own true love.</i>

663
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,186
<i>And so has my dad.</i>

664
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:50,368
It's just amazing. When we saw you in
the hospital you appeared to be quite...

665
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:54,702
Dead, yes. But now I'm right as rain.
Not even the doctors can explain it.

666
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,105
And how have you been since then?

667
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,109
Well, I do have a bit of a problem.

668
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:00,781
What kind of problem?

669
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,007
I'm far too handsome.

670
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,848
Very funny.

671
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,225
I mean it.

672
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,794
<i>It's not easy to win a girl over...</i>

673
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:19,125
<i>... especially if you're not that funny.</i>

674
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:20,926
<i>But Dad won't give up.</i>
<i>He's my hero.</i>

675
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:25,630
You don't think I'm handsome,
Miss Yuen? You can't be serious.

676
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,378
<i>I'm so lucky</i>
<i>that I still have you, CJ7.</i>

677
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,412
<i>Every day, while you sleep...</i>

678
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,245
<i>... I close my eyes</i>
<i>and count to three...</i>

679
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:41,980
<i>... hoping when I look again,</i>
<i>you'll wake.</i>

680
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:46,149
<i>I want you back so much.</i>
<i>Where are you, CJ7?</i>

681
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:52,963
One, two, three...
