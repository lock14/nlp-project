1
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,300
Attaboy! Keep him busy!

2
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,412
One.
Jesus.

3
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,970
Two.
You got it.

4
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,640
Three.
He ain't getting up!

5
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:01,176
Four, five, six...

6
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:06,648
seven, eight, nine, ten.

7
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,326
Out!

8
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,662
Come here, Jimmy.

9
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,361
Get that sleeping beauty out of here!

10
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,163
That's ten in a row, Jimmy!
Ten!

11
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,608
<i>By a knockout, at one minute 46 seconds
in the second round...</i>

12
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,439
<i>tonight's light heavyweight winner...</i>

13
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,571
<i>from the great state of New Jersey...</i>

14
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,105
<i>the Bulldog of Bergen,
James J. Braddock!</i>

15
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,959
You're gonna be the next champ, Jimmy!

16
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,258
Hey, how you doing?

17
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,958
Just give them a few.
Leave them wanting.

18
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,432
You want to sign my name for me, too?

19
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,991
At least then they can read it.

20
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,229
You gave him a cold meat party.

21
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,532
Sign this for me,
Mr. Braddock.

22
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,933
You've been getting
stronger with every fight.

23
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,068
I've been seeing it.

24
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,341
You may favor the right, sure, but
you got no stage fright or nerves.

25
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,972
And you have never been knocked out.

26
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,279
You're in line.
That's all I'm saying, Jimmy.

27
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,114
You're gonna get your shot.

28
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,482
All right, let me see
what we got here.

29
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,858
$886 for Jeanette...

30
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,757
$772 for Lou and Whitey...

31
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:19,696
$1,000 for the ring fees,
my $2,658 and your $3,544...

32
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:24,499
makes $8,860. Stick that
in your mattress, Irishman.

33
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,304
When we get there, you gonna
come in and see the kids?

34
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,865
It's been a while. Come on.
They miss their Uncle Joey.

35
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,209
Yeah, that's very sweet. You
still married to the same girl?

36
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,578
I was this morning.

37
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,550
Well, congratulations.
Maybe I'll take a rain check.

38
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,608
And would you tell her...

39
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,812
will you tell her I
undercharged on the gym fees...

40
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,254
and no load on the towel? Would
you do that for me, please?

41
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,520
I will be sure to point
it out. I appreciate it.

42
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,687
You stop up at the
corner here somewhere, Frank.

43
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,458
Home to Jersey
for Mr. Adventure over here.

44
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,559
All right, see you, Frank.

45
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,288
I could kill you!

46
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,659
I like the sound of that.

47
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,028
Yeah, I like the sound of that a lot.

48
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,760
Jimmy.
Yeah?

49
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,028
My sister.

50
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,834
Daddy, did we win?

51
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,134
Yeah, we won.

52
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,266
How are you, Alice?

53
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,208
Good. That's wonderful, Jimmy.

54
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,507
Hey, Howard.

55
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,552
Thank you.

56
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,787
So tell me about him.

57
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,692
Was he a real slugger?

58
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:01,666
You know, you could come and watch.

59
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,566
No. You get hit...

60
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,269
every time, it feels
like I'm getting hit, too.

61
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,308
And I'm not half as tough as you are.

62
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,380
So, tell me about the girls.

63
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,549
Girls?

64
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,661
I was at the Garden,
it was a fight night...

65
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,594
Come on. There was one.

66
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,528
There must've been one.
No.

67
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,959
Blond?
Brunette.

68
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,670
Tall?

69
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,510
Like a gazelle.

70
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,607
I don't know how it is
she breathed up there.

71
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,142
Mr. Braddock!

72
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,982
You're so strong!

73
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:03,421
And your hands, they're so big.

74
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,328
You're so powerful!

75
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,500
Jimmy, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,902
I'm so proud of you.

77
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,805
Introducing...

78
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,840
two-time state Golden Gloves
title holder...

79
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,180
in both the light heavyweight
and heavyweight divisions...

80
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,214
21-0, with 16 wins
coming by way of knockout...

81
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,954
the Bulldog of Bergen,
the pride of New Jersey...

82
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,128
and the hope of the Irish...

83
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,691
as the future champion of the world...

84
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,467
James J. Braddock.

85
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,539
Ma, you woke me up.

86
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,778
Well, you
kicked the covers off, honey.

87
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,643
Now you go back to sleep, all right?

88
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,776
Good night, Mom.

89
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,479
Good night, sweetheart.

90
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,648
I can't find my socks.

91
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,015
Jim!
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,456
Mama?

93
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,661
Great.
I'm sorry, baby.

94
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,891
I washed them last night.
Took them right off your feet.

95
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,065
Don't you remember?
No.

96
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,130
Well, you were out like a light.

97
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,739
How do I keep them this warm?

98
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,751
Mama, I want to eat, too.

99
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,622
Mommy will get you some, honey.

100
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,422
Hey, Rosy-Rosy.
Good morning, good morning.

101
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,530
Got a notice yesterday.
Gas and electric.

102
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,466
Come on.

103
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,939
Okey-dokey, there we go.
I'll get the milk.

104
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,196
Well, I think there's some left over.

105
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,732
Yep.

106
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,205
You know, I got that
fight tonight at the armory.

107
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,975
Yeah, one guy, Abe Feldman.

108
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,080
That's $50, win or lose.

109
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,683
That's good.

110
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,616
If I beat him, maybe I can get
my purses back up to $75.

111
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,418
That would be great.

112
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,387
Rosy, use your fork, please.

113
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,629
Who needs a cow, huh?

114
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,601
Mama, I want some more.

115
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,369
I'm sorry, sweetheart. We
need to save some for the boys.

116
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,179
Here you go.

117
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,845
You know, Mae, I dreamed last night...

118
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,279
that I was having dinner at The Ritz.

119
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,182
With Mickey Rooney and George Raft.

120
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,347
Really!
Yeah.

121
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:01,382
And I dreamed I had a steak.
A thick, juicy steak.

122
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,922
Like this, Rosy.

123
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,061
And then I had a mountain
of mashed potatoes...

124
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,566
and I went back for ice cream
three times.

125
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,035
I'm stuffed.

126
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,267
I'm absolutely full.
I cannot eat another thing.

127
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,408
Want to give me a hand?

128
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,037
Jim.

129
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,366
Boys, hurry up. Don't dawdle.

130
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,338
Let's try and sleep a little more.

131
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,420
<i># Sure, business is bunk #</i>

132
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,648
<i># And Wall Street is sunk #</i>

133
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,714
<i># We're all of us broke #</i>

134
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,816

136
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,930
<i># Can't even get drunk #</i>

137
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,831
<i># And all the while

138
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,395

139
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,371

00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,532

00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,426
<i># Cheer up, smile, nertz ##</i>

150
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,863
I need nine men and only nine.

151
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,925
One. Two. Three.

152
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:56,202
Four. Five. Six.

153
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:05,210
Seven. Eight. Nine. That's it!

154
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,576
All right, let's get a move on!

155
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,716
Go on, get going!
Got a lot of work today!

156
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,833
Hey, Dad.
Hey.

157
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,742
No shifts today, Dad?
What're you doing, son?

158
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,647
I'm being good. I'm being
quiet. I'm being 'hayve.

159
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,009
Great.

160
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,382
Daddy!

161
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,115
Hey, Rosy-cheeks.
How you doing?

162
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,159
Daddy, Jay stole!

163
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,619
What?
Jay stole.

164
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,530
What's all this about?
See? It's a salami.

165
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,700
Young lady, your brother's
in enough trouble...

166
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,267
without you telling on him.
You understand?

167
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,911
It's from the butcher's.

168
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,541
And he won't say a word
about it, will you, Jay?

169
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,879
Will you, Jay?

170
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,153
Okay, pick it up. Let's go.

171
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,458
Do not test me, boy.
Right now.

172
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,068
Howard, stay here.

173
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,341
Okay, let's go! Come
on, give me a hand here!

174
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,678
Great, then you don't get paid!

175
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,722
Bye.

176
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,554
Don't forget to pick it up easy!

177
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,927
Marty Johnson had to go away to
Delaware to live with his uncle.

178
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,332
Why?

179
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,677
His parents didn't have
enough money for them to eat.

180
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,008
Yeah, well, things ain't easy
at the moment, Jay, you're right.

181
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:26,015
But there's a lot of people
worse off than what we are.

182
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,861
And just 'cause things ain't easy...

183
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,922
that don't give you the excuse
to take what's not yours, does it?

184
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,900
That's stealing, right?
And we don't steal.

185
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,568
No matter what happens,
we don't steal.

186
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,964
Not ever. You got me?

187
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,746
Are you giving me your word?
Yes.

188
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,976
Go on.
I promise.

189
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,253
And I promise you...

190
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,427
we will never send you away.

191
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,736
It's okay, kid.

192
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,969
You got a little scared.
I understand.

193
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,000
It's okay.

194
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,129
Jim, he's a very slow guy.

195
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,194
Just plants himself there.

196
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,599
So you just keep him steady.

197
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,969
Keep him trapped in the middle.
Keep dancing around him, okay?

198
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,841
You know what to do.
You know this type.

199
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,511
That guy's a bum.

200
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,643
Two bits will get a guy a seat.

201
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,583
And that guy gets to watch
you bleed and call you a bum.

202
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:11,556
And I know I gotta take it from
him, 'cause he's a paying customer.

203
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,997
I see.

204
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,425
Well, well, well.

205
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:21,466
Pardon me, miss. Allow
me to restate my position.

206
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,805
Mr. Abraham Feldman
is a novice fighter...

207
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,575
whose ass you should gently kick...

208
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,446
until it is humped up
between his shoulder blades.

209
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,219
That is, if it doesn't offend
your overly sensitive nature.

210
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,653
God knows.

211
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,969
Now, you see, that break's
still a few weeks away.

212
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,369
I know.
Yeah.

213
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,305
And you were gonna tell me
about this when?

214
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,173
It's gonna be fine. It's
not fine. No, it's not.

215
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,438
What the hell?
You don't tell me?

216
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,811
What the hell kinda crap is
that? I owe everybody money, Joe.

217
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,110
I can't get any shifts.

218
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,052
We ain't got any cash.

219
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,989
I got it.

220
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,262
Screw them.
I'll tape it double.

221
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,928
Thanks.

222
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,831
Keep up. Stay up.

223
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,731
Keep moving.
Keep your legs moving.

224
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,844
<i>And here comes Braddock</i>

225
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,005
<i>with his long-time manager,
Joe Gould.</i>

226
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,878
You're washed up, Braddock.

227
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,842
<i>And now for our main event.</i>

228
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,010
Hey, which one's us, pal?

229
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,246
<i>Jersey veteran
James J. Braddock...</i>

230
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,812
<i>is up against Hymie Caplin's
latest charge...</i>

231
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,256
<i>young Abe Feldman
from Schenectady, New York.</i>

232
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,315
Six rounder.

233
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,486
<i>Some might recall
that Braddock was once...</i>

234
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,996
<i>a light heavyweight title challenger.</i>

235
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,228
<i>His golden-boy peak ended
when Tommy Loughran...</i>

236
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,067
<i>handled Jim over 15 rounds
back in '29.</i>

237
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,266
<i>Since then,
the oft-injured Braddock...</i>

238
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,208
<i>has shown only a glimmer
of his early promise.</i>

239
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,905
<i>And the losses have started
to pile up.</i>

240
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,346
<i>But Braddock continues to battle.</i>

241
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,081
<i>And here comes
the popular Abe Feldman.</i>

242
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,950
<i>Feldman looks to be the real thing...</i>

243
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:20,117
<i>and showed some real moxie in his recent win
over Hans Birkie.</i>

244
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,626
Hey, who whipped Latzo?

245
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,065
I did.
Goddamn right.

246
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,930
Who KO'ed Slattery in the ninth...

247
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,529
when everybody said he didn't
have a rainmaker's chance in hell?

248
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,463
That'd have to be me, too.
Right.

249
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,374
And we're supposed to pucker our
assholes over this Abe Feldman?

250
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,377
The guy couldn't break wind.
No.

251
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,244
Hey, Jimmy.

252
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,214
Anyplace else you'd rather be?

253
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,616
No.
Good.

254
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,844
Now, what are you gonna do about it?

255
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,421
<i>Here we are halfway through the fifth.</i>

256
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,187
<i>And it's more of the same.</i>

257
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,921
<i>The boys clinch again.</i>

258
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:57,984
Break it up.

259
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,894
He's crushing my guy. Get him off!

260
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,123
Break!

261
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,426
<i>The boo-birds
have started flying here.</i>

262
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,698
<i>They want action from these fighters.</i>

263
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,898
<i>Feldman sticks a left
in Braddock's face.</i>

264
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,568
<i>Braddock's right hand
is his best and only weapon.</i>

265
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,407
<i>He'll show the left, but it lacks snap
and Feldman knows it.</i>

266
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,039
Come on, give these yokels
a shot in the ass!

267
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,114
<i>Feldman ducks a haymaker
but fails to follow up.</i>

268
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,691
<i>And another big right by Braddock.</i>

269
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,696
<i>Now, there's the Braddock
we all recall.</i>

270
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,392
<i>But it's one at a time.
It may not be enough.</i>

271
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,760
Come on!

272
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,260
<i>The referee pulls the boys apart.</i>

273
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,459
<i>And there's the bell to end the fifth.</i>

274
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,399
Easy now. Easy.

275
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,808
I saw that.
You bust it again?

276
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,205
I'm calling it, Jim.

277
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,413
You gonna use the left?
Okay, good.

278
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,645
You get in there but you
don't let him crowd you.

279
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,949
You work his belly, you
hammer his belly with the left.

280
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,388
Last round. Come on,
you got to show me something.

281
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,550
Give me a good one. You're
giving me an ulcer, Harry!

282
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,684
Shut up.

283
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,192
Work his belly with the left.
You got it?

284
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,993
Give him the flapdoodle with
the right because he don't know.

285
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,034
Right?
'Cause he's kind of stupid.

286
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,898
Okay? Last round.

287
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,701
Last round! Go get him!

288
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,134
The left!

289
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,705
Damn it, I wish he could find
his goddamn left.

290
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:56,714
That's it! Change it up!

291
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,806
Southpaw, that's it!

292
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,444
<i>Feldman prancing around,
looking for an opening...</i>

293
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,182
<i>but still few clean punches
by the fighters.</i>

294
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,656
<i>Braddock still pawing away
with the left.</i>

295
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,522
<i>Another ineffectual left from Feldman.</i>

296
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,394
<i>Braddock can hardly lift his arms.
He's slow on his feet.</i>

297
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,229
<i>At least Gould in his corner
is still throwing punches...</i>

298
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,166
<i>trying to urge his man on.</i>

299
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,106
Go home!

300
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,840
Go home, Braddock!

301
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,674
No holding, Braddock!

302
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,311
<i>Cavanaugh's working harder
than the fighters.</i>

303
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,583
Dry up!

304
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,351
<i>Another clinch.</i>

305
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:45,362
<i>It's as if 80 tough fights have finally jumped
on Braddock's back.</i>

306
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,027
You're a bum!

307
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,397
That's it!

308
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,499
<i>Cavanaugh pulls them apart,
and he's called the fight.</i>

309
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:58,907
<i>He's called the fight.</i>

310
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,406
<i>It's a "no contest. "</i>

311
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,177
<i>And the popcorn and the peanuts
are raining down.</i>

312
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,708
<i>And I'm afraid to say that's all these
fighters deserve...</i>

313
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,880
<i>for the show they put on tonight.</i>

314
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,483
<i>I'm telling you, it's sad to see
a fighter that was once...</i>

315
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,189
<i>the caliber of James Braddock
reduced to this.</i>

316
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,856
It's all right, Jimmy.

317
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,802
An embarrassment, that's what it was.

318
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,167
An embarrassment!

319
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,637
Where the hell's the purse?

320
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,333
You wouldn't have to be asking that...

321
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,376
if you gave a shit about your fighter.

322
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,776
Okay. He's fighting hurt.

323
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,909
Maybe you got a bunch of fat
and happy fighters at home...

324
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,975
can afford to rest a month between
bouts. I don't know. Lucky you!

325
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,520
Christ, he hardly gets
a punch in anymore!

326
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,949
Fights being stopped by
referees? He's pathetic!

327
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,920
Fights like that keep people away.

328
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,956
We're revoking his license, Joe.

329
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,759
Whatever Braddock was gonna do
in boxing, I guess he's done it.

330
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,938
Wait a minute.
That's all.

331
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:09,875
Oh, boy.

332
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,819
Mr. Johnston!

333
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,082
Jim.

334
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,618
What's going on?

335
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,956
You didn't tell him?
Yeah, of course I told him.

336
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,692
He wanted to hear it from you.

337
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,859
Come on, Mr. Johnston,
no contest?

338
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,032
I broke my hand.
Okay? It's legit.

339
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,398
You don't see me crying about it.

340
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,741
I don't see what you got
to complain about.

341
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,575
I still went out there, I still put
on a show. I did what I could do.

342
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,012
You know, we did that
boondock circuit for you...

343
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,606
me and Joe. Remember?

344
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,521
I didn't quit on you.
And I didn't quit tonight.

345
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,753
I didn't always lose.

346
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,790
I won't always lose again.

347
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,859
I can still fight.
Go home.

348
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,957
I can still fight. Go home
to Mae and the kids, Jim.

349
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,029
Go home? Go home with what?

350
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:12,200
Go home with what? A broken
hand from Mount Vernon?

351
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,807
Mr. Johnston!

352
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,407
Baby?

353
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,850
What happened?

354
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,522
I didn't get the dough.

355
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,324
They didn't pay up.

356
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,098
They called it a "no contest,"
said the fight was an embarrassment.

357
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,231
They decommissioned me.

358
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,869
Jimmy, what happened to your hand?

359
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,142
It's broke again in three places.

360
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,807
They said I'm through, Mae.

361
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,944
They said I can't be a boxer no more.

362
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,487
Mercy.

363
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:36,886
Okay.

364
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,331
Jimmy, if you can't work...

365
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,565
we're not gonna be able to pay
the electric, or the heat.

366
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,277
And we're out of credit
at the grocery.

367
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,747
So I think we need to pack the kids.

368
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,021
They could stay at my sister's
for a little while...

369
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:07,217
and I'll take in more sewing.

370
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,919
That way we could make
two, three breadlines a day.

371
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,518
I'll get doubles, triples,
whatever I can find.

372
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,893
Jimmy, you can't work.
Mae, I can still work.

373
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,455
Jimmy, you can't work.
Your hand's broken.

374
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,967
They see me lugging this around,

375
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,197
you're right, they won't pick me.

376
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,364
Not down the docks, not anywhere.

377
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,803
So we're gonna cover it up...

378
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,504
with the shoe polish.

379
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,874
Okay?

380
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,437
I'm sorry.
No.

381
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,477
No.

382
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,052
No.

383
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,317
I need five and only five!

384
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,686
Come on, Jake!

385
00:28:46,091 --> 00:28:47,456
One.

386
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,624
Two.

387
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:54,697
Three.

388
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,495
Four.

389
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,699
Five. That's it!

390
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,784
What the hell happened to your face?

391
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:22,091
I got in a fight.
Yeah?

392
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,190
What'd you go do that for?

393
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,757
That's a good question.

394
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,098
Mike Wilson.

395
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,331
Jim Braddock.

396
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,929
I used to follow a pretty good
fighter with that name.

397
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,277
And there's some other guy
going around using that name now.

398
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,245
Can't fight for shit.

399
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,646
Gambling man will lose
a lot of money on him. Twice.

400
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,956
That hand ain't gonna work.

401
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:57,358
You can't slow me down.
I need this job.

402
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,097
I need the job, too.

403
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,565
What's wrong with the goddamn hand?

404
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,379
You see us falling behind, Jake?

405
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,788
He's all right.

406
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,230
Appreciate it.

407
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,333
I'll get a cold beer.

408
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,396
Just a water for me, Quincy.

409
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,907
All I got today are big spenders.

410
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,910
Beer for him, too. I'm buying.

411
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,871
Don't hurt my feelings.

412
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,213
It's been a while, but... You
don't have to twist my arm.

413
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,384
Yeah, I used to be a
broker. Still lost it all in '29.

414
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,189
Yeah, me, too.

415
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:05,027
I had just about everything
I ever earned in stocks.

416
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,327
Even had a little taxi company.

417
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,799
I mean, who loses their dough
on cabs in New York City, right?

418
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,995
Well, I thought that one
was gold for the grandkiddies.

419
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,939
You know, there's people living
in shacks in Central Park.

420
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,703
Call it the Hooverville.

421
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,173
This government's dropped us flat.

422
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:24,807
We need to organize, you know?
Unionize. Fight back.

423
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:27,780
Fight? Fight what?

424
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,218
Bad luck? Greed? Drought?

425
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,816
No point punching things
you can't see.

426
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,121
No, we'll work a way through this.

427
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,889
FDR, he's gonna handle it.
Screw FDR.

428
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,424
FDR, Hoover, they're all the same.

429
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,194
You know, I come home one day.
I stand in my living room.

430
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,260
And between the mortgage and the
market and the goddamn lawyer...

431
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,134
that was supposed
to be working for me...

432
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,969
it stopped being mine.

433
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,942
It all stopped being mine.

434
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,541
FDR ain't given me my house back yet.

435
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,215
Mama, why can't I go to school?

436
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,224
Is it because I'm a girl?

437
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,723
Maybe. Hadn't thought of that.

438
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,061
Who's that man at our house?

439
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,471
Excuse me!

440
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:26,136
Can I help you?

441
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,073
I'm sorry, lady, you're past due.

442
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,512
No, you can't.

443
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,640
You can't.
There's kids.

444
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,215
If I don't, they let me go.

445
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,848
They already let two guys go.
Please.

446
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:43,787
This apartment, it's what we got
left that keeps us hanging on.

447
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,758
Lady, I got kids, too.

448
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,373
$6.74.

449
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,108
How much to turn it back on?

450
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,617
Four months. $44.12.

451
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:16,554
If I work 26 hours out of
every 24, it still won't add up.

452
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,961
We ain't got nothing.
Nothing left to sell.

453
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,906
All the guys
you could've married, huh?

454
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,608
Yeah.
What happened to those guys?

455
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,267
It's Howard.

456
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:05,733
Since this afternoon.

457
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,381
"Bless us, O Lord...

458
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,484
"and these thy gifts which
we are about to receive...

459
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,115
from thy bounty."

460
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,432
I'm all prayed out.

461
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:42,506
Here's more firewood.

462
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,447
Where are you going?
I said where are you going?

463
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,856
Go to hell,
you no-good bastard!

464
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,989
Go on, then!
We don't need you!

465
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:04,523
All right. Help me,
pick up some of that wood.

466
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,900
I got it, Mama.
All right, let's go, sweetheart.

467
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,336
All right, honey.

468
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,306
Nice and warm, huh?

469
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,946
Baby?

470
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,046
Baby?

471
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,982
Look at Mommy.

472
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,097
Sweetheart.

473
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,736
Mommy?

474
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,709
What's wrong?

475
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,582
Nothing, sweetheart.

476
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,520
Mommy will be right back, okay?

477
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:58,415
Howard's fever was getting worse
and then Rosy started to sneeze.

478
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,395
Where are they, Mae? Jim,
we can't even keep 'em warm.

479
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,493
Where are the kids?

480
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,402
The boys will sleep on the
sofa at my father's in Brooklyn.

481
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,166
And Rosy'll stay at my sister's.

482
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,901
Jimmy, we can't keep 'em!

483
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,637
You don't make decisions
about our children without me.

484
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,680
What if they get really sick?
We already owe Dr. McDonald...

485
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,772
If you send them away, then
all this has been for nothing!

486
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,044
It's just until we get back...
What else was it for?

487
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,313
If we can't stay together,
that means we lost!

488
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,480
That means we've given up!
I am not giving up!

489
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:41,389
I'm trying to protect our
children. Mae, I promised him.

490
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,791
Outside the butcher's.

491
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:44,850
I looked him in the eyes...

492
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,487
and I promised him
with all of my heart...

493
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,964
I would never ever send him away.

494
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,391
You can't do this.

495
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,431
You weren't here.

496
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,963
You can't break my promise.

497
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,006
Jim, you didn't see.
You weren't here.

498
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,447
I'm sorry.

499
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,224
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

500
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,762
What are you doing?

501
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,634
Jim?

502
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,199
Jimmy! Where you going?

503
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,704
Where you going, Jimmy?

504
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,895
That doesn't qualify you,
sir. What else can you tell me?

505
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,461
The problem is my wife
is losing all of her teeth.

506
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,098
I got a relief order for her.

507
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,439
The doctor says
it's due to insufficient diet.

508
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,808
She's still nursing the baby
on account of...

509
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,506
we can't afford milk for the family.

510
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:11,707
Okay.

511
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,454
I never thought I'd see you here, Jim.

512
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,659
He jumped up...

513
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,995
kicked his stool out of the ring...

514
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,698
and he was just, he was furious.

515
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,900
I grabbed the mike...

516
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,480
There's Jimmy Braddock.

517
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,323
The thing is, I can't afford to...

518
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,322
I can't afford to pay the heat.

519
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,022
I've had to farm out my kids.

520
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,962
You know, they keep cutting
shifts down at the docks...

521
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,128
and you just don't get picked
every day.

522
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,367
I sold everything I've got
that anybody would buy.

523
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,110
I went on public assistance. I
signed on at the relief office.

524
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:35,280
They gave me $19.
I need another $18.38...

525
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,351
so I can pay the bill
and get the kids back.

526
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,192
You know me well enough to know
if I had anywhere else to go...

527
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:48,965
I wouldn't be here.

528
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,607
If you could help me through this
time, I sure would be grateful.

529
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,658
Sure, Jim. Sure.

530
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:19,996
Good luck.

531
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,399
Jim.

532
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,906
Hey, Jimmy.

533
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,806
Here you go, Jim.

534
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,606
Good luck, Jim.

535
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,526
I'm sorry, Joe, I didn't...
I'm sorry.

536
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,238
What in the hell do you have
to be sorry about?

537
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,703
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.

538
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,484
How short are you?

539
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,855
About $1.50.

540
00:43:58,869 --> 00:43:59,961
Okay.

541
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,304
We're home! Hooray, we're home!

542
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:06,041
We're glad to be home!

543
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,472
Good.

544
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,348
Okay. All right.

545
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:24,058
Howard, don't jump on
the bed. Sorry, Mama.

546
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,993
Read to me, Jay.

547
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,788
"On his way up
and down the stairs..."

548
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,858
Do you like being
home? I like being home, too.

549
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,528
My little doll.

550
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,439
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

551
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,683
<i># Happy birthday, dear Howard #</i>

552
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,487
<i># Happy birthday to you ##</i>

553
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,089
Make a wish, kids.

554
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,385
Blow!

555
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,094
Hey, Howard, come on.
They're gonna cut the cake up.

556
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,395
You wanna line up, huh?

557
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:09,065
You looking forward
to some chocolate cake?

558
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,107
I liked it better when we had our own.

559
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,639
I can understand that.

560
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,375
Hiya, Howard. Hi.

561
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,346
Hey, your dad ever tell you
that I used to spar with him?

562
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,646
You hit the Father?
As often as I possibly could.

563
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,680
He was kinda tricky, though.
Hard to catch.

564
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,415
Go and get some cake. Go on.

565
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,227
Missed you at mass, Jimmy.

566
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,227
I can get an extra shift
on a Sunday, you know?

567
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,164
Don't you walk
away from me! James.

568
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,326
Mike, you hear me?

569
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,494
Excuse me.

570
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,437
Every day, "fix the world."
How about fixing your family?

571
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:43,939
What kind of father are you?

572
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,170
Too proud to cross the street
because she can't have her own cake?

573
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,712
And now you're drunk at
church, for Christ's sake.

574
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,908
That a joke, Sara? Making a
joke? I'm just saying it's enough!

575
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,713
Guys, where's the ref? Why
don't you stay out of this?

576
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,755
It's between man and wife. How
do you even call yourself that?

577
00:45:58,822 --> 00:45:59,811
What'd you say to me?
Come on.

578
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,914
Get your hands off me!

579
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,049
You've had a couple drinks.
It's Sunday.

580
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:04,526
No harm in that. Day of rest.
All washed up. Can't get a fight.

581
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,755
What, you want to fight me?

582
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,160
Mike, you don't have to do this.

583
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,493
I ain't got no beef with you.

584
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,931
Come on! Can't make it in the ring, huh?

585
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,696
Come on, Braddock,
I'll take your head off!

586
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,929
Jim, no!
Mike, you okay, baby?

587
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,375
Why don't you get off me?

588
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,776
Go to hell! The both of you!

589
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,612
Jesus, Jim, he wasn't gonna hit me.

590
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:29,776
Mike, wait!

591
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,791
Now, what it's all about is
rotating your body behind your fist.

592
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,994
Bang. That's right.
Right in the kisser, yeah.

593
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,060
There you go.

594
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,141
Good girl. You got a
better jab than your dad.

595
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,880
Boy, you are a brave man. Not
really. Mae's at the store.

596
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,842
That's a good one, kiddo!

597
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:06,515
You want to go play with the other
kids while I talk to Uncle Joe?

598
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,462
Joe Gould,
still looking dapper, I see.

599
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,664
Certainly. Gotta keep up
appearances, right?

600
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,599
Good to see you, Jimmy.
Nice to see you, Joe.

601
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,795
Nice day, huh?

602
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,238
Yeah.

603
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,174
You drove all the way out here
to talk about the weather?

604
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,011
Maybe I was in the neighborhood.
Did you ever think of that?

605
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,243
Little fresh air.

606
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,043
Joe, this is Jersey.

607
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,455
Yeah. Good point.

608
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:46,990
I got you a fight.

609
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,757
Go to hell. Come on.
You want it, don't you?

610
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:54,065
What, we gonna bring this up with
the Boxing Commission, or not?

611
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:57,265
Yes, and they'll sanction it.
This one fight, and one fight only.

612
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,866
It's not a comeback, right?
It's just one fight.

613
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,509
Why?
'Cause of who you're fighting.

614
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:03,904
How much?

615
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,471
Just once, ask me who
it is you're fighting.

616
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,915
How much?
$250.

617
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,881
You're on at the big show
at the Garden, tomorrow night.

618
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,184
You fight Corn Griffin, Jimmy.

619
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,350
Number two heavyweight
contender in the world.

620
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,154
Prelim before the championship bout.

621
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,422
You know, Joe, this
ain't funny. No, it's not.

622
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,430
And it ain't no favor, either.

623
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,864
Griffin's opponent got cut,
and he couldn't fight.

624
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,562
So they had to find somebody they
could throw in at a day's notice.

625
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:27,968
Nobody legit would...

626
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,674
Nobody would take a fight
with Griffin without training.

627
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:38,908
So I told them use the angle
Griffin's gonna knock out a guy...

628
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,014
never been knocked out.

629
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,413
You're meat, Jimmy.

630
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,184
Are you on the level, Joe?

631
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,950
Come on. Always.

632
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,259
For $250, I would fight your wife.

633
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,249
Now you're dreaming.

634
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,091
And your grandmother.
At the same time.

635
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,528
Teeth in or teeth out?
Take them out.

636
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,122
Then you're dead.
You're down, you're gone.

637
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,291
No chance.
$250?

638
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,664
250 bananas. Come here.

639
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,936
Get your programs here!

640
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,845
Programs here! 25 cents!

641
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,342
I mean, for Christ's sake,
100 and something fights...

642
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:15,885
you never been knocked out.

643
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,853
Who the hell goes and sells his gear?

644
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,513
80 fights as a pro, 50 as an amateur.

645
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,225
How soon they forget!
I'm so sorry.

646
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,354
Borrowed gear, borrowed robe.
Knock yourself out.

647
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:30,591
Joe.

648
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,832
I might as well get an Aooga horn
and chase him around the ring.

649
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,640
That's good.
You been drinking?

650
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:44,544
Are you trying to hurt my feelings?

651
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,012
You're just too loose. You're
spooking me. Sharpen up.

652
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,179
Come on, Joe, we both
know what this is, right?

653
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:55,588
I get to put a little more distance
between my kids and the street...

654
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,894
and I get to say good-bye
at the Garden.

655
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,594
Full house, night of a big fight.

656
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,265
Thank you very much.

657
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,402
Right. Come on, hurry up.

658
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,330
Let's get the lead out of here.

659
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,174
What the hell was that?

660
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,576
They ran out of soup
on the line this morning.

661
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:19,706
Ran out of soup
on the line this morning.

662
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,684
How the hell are you supposed
to fight on an empty stomach?

663
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,585
<i>Good evening.</i>

664
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:29,421

Eat, quick.

667
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,126
You got a spoon? For
Christ's sake, it's not there?

668
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,432
Come on, we gotta go anyway.
One bite, Joe.

669
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,473
I'll eat it with my fingers.
Whoa, hey!

670
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,670
I don't have time
to re-tape you.

671
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,843
Just sit tight,
and I'll find you a spoon.

672
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,980
For Christ's sake.

673
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,895
Is that a ghost
I'm seeing? An apparition?

674
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:09,159
Or is that James J. Braddock,
the Bulldog of Bergen?

675
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,934
How you feeling, Jimmy?
How's that right hand?

676
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,401
Braddock, you're up!

677
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,609

How you doing?

00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,325
Looking good, Jimmy!

693
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,637
"... was seen on his feet."
You got that?

694
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,173
<i>Before tonight's championship
battle, we'll bring you...</i>

695
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:27,005
<i>a special bout featuring Charlie Harvey's
soldier boy...</i>

696
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:28,708
<i>Corn Griffin.</i>

697
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,439
<i>Griffin is the fella that ran rings...</i>

698
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,641
<i>around the champion Carnera
in training.</i>

699
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,282
<i>And who's his opponent?</i>

700
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:37,479
<i>Looks like they dug old Jim Braddock
out of retirement...</i>

701
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,987
<i>at least for one more fight.</i>

702
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,850
<i>Hey, Mike! Griffin is up
in the ring now.</i>

703
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,154
<i>Braddock? Isn't that your buddy?
Look at the size of him!</i>

704
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,155
<i>In this corner...</i>

705
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:51,494
<i>the sensational heavyweight slugger...</i>

706
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,661
<i>from Fort Benning, Georgia...</i>

707
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:57,595
<i>who is punching a path
to the top of the division.</i>

708
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:00,736
<i>John "Corn" Griffin!</i>

709
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:08,373
<i>The popular battler...</i>

710
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,615
<i>who has never been KO'ed in more than
80 professional bouts...</i>

711
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,584
Quincy, beer. We got a fight!

712
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,852
<i>... the power-punching
veteran...</i>

713
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,451
<i>from North Bergen, New Jersey...</i>

714
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,824
<i>James J. Braddock!</i>

715
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,315
<i>The skinny from
the reporters at ringside...</i>

716
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,417
<i>is that Braddock
won't last two rounds.</i>

717
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,985
<i>Griffin is a five-to-one
favorite to do just that.</i>

718
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,589
<i>But Joe Gould claims
Braddock's right hand is fine.</i>

719
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,657
<i>Jimmy will need
two good hands tonight.</i>

720
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,239
<i>Griffin storms out of his corner!</i>

721
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,669
<i>Things are up-tempo right away.</i>

722
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,715
Come on, Braddock, make a fight of it!

723
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,017
Get out of it! Get out, Jimmy!

724
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,889
<i>Braddock takes a left to the body</i>

725
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:26,155
<i>and a hard right to the head!</i>

726
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,890
<i>Braddock's giving ground now.</i>

727
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,357
<i>A hard right!</i>

728
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,990
<i>Pins him in the neutral corner.</i>

729
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:33,062
Get outta there, Jim! Get out!

730
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,125
<i>Griffin's all over him!</i>

731
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,561
<i>Braddock taking hard jabs.</i>

732
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:40,665
<i>And Braddock is down.</i>

733
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,912
Shut up! I wanna hear this!
Shut up!

734
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,147
Jim? You're fine. Stay down.

735
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:58,125
One. Two.
Stay down! What's the hurry?

736
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,458
Three. Four.
Hey! Listen.

737
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:02,964
I liked the left. Try two lefts. Five.

738
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:04,295
Give him two lefts!
Six.

739
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,301
Pop, pop! Double it up.
Seven.

740
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,337
How 'bout it? Up, up.
Eight.

741
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,032
What the hell are you doing?
Let's go.

742
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,095
Nine.

743
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,499
Yeah, come on, Jimmy!
On your feet, come on!

744
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,008
<i>The referee waving Griffin in.</i>

745
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,670
Move in on that.

746
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,079
Nice move!

747
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,445
Bring him in!

748
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:25,484
<i>Snaps a stiff jab! Another!</i>

749
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,018
Welcome to New York.

750
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,992
Beautiful!

751
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:33,494
That's more like it!
Let me see that cut.

752
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,530
You look great!

753
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,200
It sure as hell beats working
on the docks!

754
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,534
Say, the two jabs look
sensational! They look sweet!

755
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,035
Now, he's loading up on you.
You see that?

756
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,238
He opens up after you jab him. You
gotta come in there with a right.

757
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:51,302
Real quick.

758
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,477
But you gotta stop
some of those left hands.

759
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,352
You see any getting past my head?

760
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:58,912
Keep moving!

761
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,555
<i>Griffin still winging big shots.</i>

762
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,754
<i>He wants to be the first
to stop Braddock.</i>

763
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,957
<i>Braddock gets in
another big right hand!</i>

764
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,228
<i>Snapped Griffin's head back
with that one.</i>

765
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,303
Come on!

766
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,704
<i>Griffin loading up.</i>

767
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:22,505
Move out!
Give him the slip, Jimmy!

768
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,410
<i>Another big flurry by Griffin!</i>

769
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,144
<i>Braddock hanging tough but, folks,
he is taking a beating!</i>

770
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:33,015
That's two rounds more
than I thought he was gonna go.

771
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,954
He's a half a step behind you.
Do you feel it?

772
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:38,993
Stick with it.

773
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,355
Busy, busy.

774
00:56:42,198 --> 00:56:44,325
<i>Six minutes of fury so far.</i>

775
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,196
<i>Braddock has the look of a man
trying to hold back an avalanche.</i>

776
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,740
<i>Griffin hits him with a left.</i>

777
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,800
<i>And Braddock is stepping
in post holes.</i>

778
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,972
Keep him in front of you!

779
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,775
Lure him in, Jim.

780
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,183
<i>Jimmy's finally moving his head.</i>

781
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,413
Pick your spot!

782
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:17,830
<i>And Griffin is down!</i>

783
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,537
Where the hell have you been,
Jimmy Braddock?

784
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,573
One. Two. Three.

785
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,513
<i>He's up at three.</i>

786
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,408
<i>The referee wipes his gloves.</i>

787
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,287
That's it!
No daylight!

788
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,051
Take it to him!

789
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,192
<i>Another big right by Braddock!</i>

790
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,798
Finish him, Jimmy!

791
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,802
Knock him back to the goddamn Ozarks!

792
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,811
<i>Griffin is ready to go!</i>

793
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,113
Be careful.

794
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:08,782
Get back.

795
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,910
Get back there.
Get back in your corner.

796
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,387
Jimmy!

797
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,466
<i>This fight is over!
This is incredible!</i>

798
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,367
<i>Corn Griffin, the number two
contender in the world...</i>

799
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,895
<i>has just been knocked out by Jim Braddock
in the third round!</i>

800
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,305
<i>What an upset!</i>

801
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,070
You son of a bitch!

802
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,338
<i>It's pandemonium here in the Garden!</i>

803
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,846
That's it, man, he did it!
I don't believe it!

804
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,976
You beautiful bastard!

805
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,618
Settle down, for Christ's sake!

806
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,617
Jesus H. Christ!

807
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,058
Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
Mary Magdalene...

808
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,998
all the saints and martyrs and Jesus!

809
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,395
Did I say "Jesus"?

810
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,071
Where the hell did that come from?

811
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,629
I don't know.
When my hand was broke...

812
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,971
I had to work down on the
docks and I had to use my left.

813
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,910
So, what?
No, that and luck.

814
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,072
Luck?
Sheer dumb-ass Irish luck.

815
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:14,412
Don't give me that
luck-of-the-Irish crap. No, sir.

816
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:17,544
Lucky? That's something you ain't
been in a long time, brother.

817
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:18,913
Everybody's due.

818
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,785
Due or not, I'll take it.
You had the left.

819
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,620
The left. But you were bouncy.

820
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,323
You were bouncing.

821
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:30,899
Unbelievable. Sliding,
slipping. You were like a cat.

822
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,366
I did that on hash.

823
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,063
Imagine what I would've done to
him if I'd had a couple of steaks.

824
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:38,934
Jimmy?

825
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,105
That was one hell of
a good-bye.

826
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:51,752
Here you go, fellas!
Have at him!

827
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,546
Jesus Christ!

828
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:29,485
Murder him, Maxie!

829
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,694
Primo!

830
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,721
This is fighting?

831
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,493
Why doesn't he just hit him
with a goddamn chair?

832
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,030
Griffin was supposed to fight
Baer next.

833
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:46,708
He should kiss your ass for
saving him from that thing.

834
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,726
Throw him down, Maxie!

835
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,398
Give it to him, Maxie!

836
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,110
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

837
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,347
<i>the new heavyweight champion
of the world...</i>

838
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,888
<i>Max Baer!</i>

839
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,697
Come on! He's home.

840
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:17,425
I won.

841
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,770
Hooray, he won! I knew you'd win!

842
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:26,965
He won, he won, he won!

843
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,443
Get the silverware.

844
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:37,848
So was it like you said? Or
are they letting you back in?

845
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,552
No, baby.
It was just one fight.

846
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,075
All right, I need
seven men, and seven only!

847
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:04,373
One. Two. Three.

848
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,417
Four. Five.

849
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,484
Thanks.

850
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:17,988
Braddock!

851
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:26,827
Listened in last night.
Was that really you?

852
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,163
Yeah.

853
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,208
Didn't think
I'd be seeing you back here.

854
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,176
It came up at the last minute,
you know?

855
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,678
It was a one-fight deal.
The purse was $250.

856
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:40,682
My end of that was a little less
than half. It was, like, $123.

857
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,809
We owed $118.
Left me with $5.

858
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,419
Makes you a rich man, huh?
Around here.

859
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:48,123
Good fight.
Thanks.

860
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,023
Dock seven.
Seven.

861
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:58,096
Hey, Jim.
Hey, Mike.

862
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:05,769
Good fight.
Thanks.

863
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:13,872
I wouldn't have hit Sara.
I know, Mike.

864
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:16,513
I couldn't live with myself
if I'd have hit her.

865
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:21,279
Just get so angry with all this shit.

866
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:28,892
You know, if you were gonna
win, you could've told me.

867
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,858
If I knew I was gonna win,
I would've bet on myself.

868
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,470
Why can't you ever listen
to me? I don't know.

869
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:39,101
<i>...to determine whether
the strikers were willing...</i>

870
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,336
<i>to submit to an arbitration situation.</i>

871
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,774
<i>Tension pervaded the New York
waterfront yesterday.</i>

872
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,973
Why don't you go play
with the boys, sweetheart?

873
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,039
Be careful.

874
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,350
Hey, Rosy.
Hi, Daddy!

875
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:02,390
You know, Joe Gould was just here.

876
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,197
Yeah, I saw.
You did?

877
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:11,472
He thinks the Commission
might be willing to...

878
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,741
reverse their ruling.

879
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,743
He thinks he can get me another fight.

880
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,447
He wants me to stop working
and get back in shape.

881
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,951
I thought it was just the one fight.

882
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:25,652
Well, yeah.

883
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:32,922
He fronted us $175 so I can train.

884
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:37,695
You know what that is right there?

885
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:39,400
That's a second chance.

886
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,268
That's what that is.

887
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:48,206
It's not that I'm not grateful...

888
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:53,311
or proud, honey.
I'm so proud of you.

889
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,319
But we got off easy
when you broke that hand.

890
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,353
We're back to even now.

891
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,416
Right. And nine months from
now, we're back in the same boat.

892
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:05,721
Baby, please.

893
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,429
We just don't have anything
left to risk.

894
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:09,657
Mae.

895
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:14,564
There's still some juice in these
legs, and I can still take a few.

896
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,363
Baby, please.

897
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:20,932
Just let me take them in the ring.

898
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,807
At least I know who's hitting me.

899
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,757
I'm gonna go and tell the kids.

900
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,165
Jay! Guess what.
What?

901
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,402
I got another fight!
Who with?

902
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,963
I don't know, but he's
going down. Hey, Howard.

903
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,706
Jesus.

904
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,350
Joe, open the door.

905
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,022
Joe! Open the damn door!

906
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:44,086
Don't hide in your fancy
apartment. I want to talk to you.

907
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:49,561
You are not gonna make my husband
your punching bag all over again.

908
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,226
We are just getting by, and
you're taking him from his work...

909
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,565
like some bloodsucking little leech!

910
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:57,500
And I will not let you get
him hurt again like that...

911
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:00,098
do you hear me?
I will not let you!

912
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,179
Guess you better come in.

913
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,490
How is it?

914
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,457
Too sweet per usual.

915
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,457
Really? Go figure.

916
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,130
Yours? Nice, thanks.

917
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,097
Sorry about that.

918
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:34,542
You just don't want folks
to see you down is all.

919
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,773
I didn't know.
I mean, I thought that...

920
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:42,409
Yeah, no. That's the idea.
Always keep your hands up.

921
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:51,526
Sold the last of it two days ago.

922
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:53,957
So Jimmy could train.

923
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,425
Why?

924
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,869
Sometimes you have an instinct, Mae.

925
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,935
You see something in a fighter.

926
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,971
You don't even know if it's real,
you're looking for it so bad.

927
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,257
Can't have no hope at all.

928
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,821
But this is crazy.

929
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,591
I mean, you don't even know
if you can get him a fight.

930
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,029
I'll get him a fight.

931
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:33,091
Believe me, if it's the last
thing I do, I'll get him a fight.

932
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,637
Honey. Go get us some
of those crackers, would you?

933
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:39,737
She looks good wearing the pants.

934
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,951
Can you ever stop yours?

935
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,123
When he sets his mind to a thing?

936
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,056
I wish I could.

937
01:10:07,303 --> 01:10:09,203
See, I never know
who it's harder on...

938
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:10,832
them or us.

939
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,175
We have to wait for them
to fix everything.

940
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,341
And every day...

941
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,447
they feel like they're failing us.

942
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,583
And really, it's just the
world that's failed, you know?

943
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:38,394
This is a lovely apartment. Thank you.

944
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,829
Now, what am I
gonna go and do that for?

945
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:45,968
You saw the papers.

946
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,067
<i>News had to print extra
copies the day after Braddock's fight.</i>

947
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:52,238
People are sentimental, you
know. Some people are sentimental.

948
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:53,804
Yeah, so tell me why I care.

949
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:58,311
You're still sore over the way
Braddock took down Griffin, fine.

950
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,413
I can understand that. It was a
heartbreak for a lot of people.

951
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,117
Yes. But look.

952
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,821
You got guys fighting
an elimination series...

953
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:11,991
over who gets a shot at Max Baer
for the championship in June.

954
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,825
John Henry Lewis,
he's your number two in line.

955
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,929
Now, he already defeated
Braddock once in Frisco, correct?

956
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,941
Say you put Braddock back
in the game against Lewis.

957
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,502
Lewis wins, you get your
revenge on Braddock...

958
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,878
and your boy has gotten
a topflight tune-up...

959
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,543
with full publicity before
Lasky, and what happens?

960
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,108
You make more money.

961
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:38,349
Now, say on the other hand, by
some minute, infinitesimal chance...

962
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,395
God forbid, Braddock beats Lewis.

963
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,259
Now you got a sentimental
favorite go up...

964
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,595
and lose against Lasky,
and what happens?

965
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,328
You'll make more money.

966
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,530
James, either way...

967
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:52,040
you're a richer man with Braddock
back in the ring than if he's not.

968
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,675
Come on, don't be foolish. We
both know the name of this game.

969
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,411
And it sure as hell
ain't "pugilism."

970
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,723
They ought to put your mouth
in a circus.

971
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,491
What do you say?

972
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,634
Don't chase him.
Go around, cut him off.

973
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:23,563
Time! James!

974
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,675
I got you a fight.
Yeah?

975
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,973
You're gonna fight
John Henry Lewis again.

976
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,205
Yeah!

977
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,770
Joey! I could kiss you!

978
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:35,282
No, please,
not in front of the fellas.

979
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,849
Isn't John Henry
one of Johnston's boys?

980
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,714
You let me worry about that, please.

981
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,916
Now I know why you won't kiss me.
You're all puckered out already.

982
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,059
Brother, you have no idea.

983
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:48,190
Lewis?
Kicked our ass in Frisco.

984
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:50,527
Yeah. Hey, Mike.
Who's "our ass" up there?

985
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,726
Joe Gould, Mike Wilson.
Mike Wilson, Joe Gould.

986
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:53,927
Hi.

987
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,936
That guy ain't been beat
in ten fights.

988
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:59,030
But you win on a long shot, and
that's a great payday for me.

989
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,101
That's great.
I'll keep that in mind, Mike!

990
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:05,044
You got more important things
to think about. Come here.

991
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,410
Now, I ain't gonna
bullshit you, all right?

992
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,976
Now, you win one,
I can get you another.

993
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:15,114
Win again and then things maybe
start getting serious around here.

994
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:16,851
Jimmy?

995
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,518
Win.

996
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,303
Look good.

997
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,712
Leverage.

998
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,615
That's it, James!

999
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,526
Be a bully, James!
Aggression, that's it.

1000
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:17,744
Thanks.

1001
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,087
I know this isn't what you wanted...

1002
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,425
but I can't win without you behind me.

1003
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,159
I'm always behind you.

1004
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,955
Thank you, baby.

1005
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:35,002
I got a great idea.
You want to come along?

1006
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:38,770
Come on, just this one time.
All right. Okay.

1007
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,139
Okay, I'll make that
a rain check then.

1008
01:15:08,971 --> 01:15:11,872
<i>Lewis, still moving well here
in the fourth.</i>

1009
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,869
<i>He dances in and out
before Braddock can react.</i>

1010
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,481
Don't let him set the pace, Jimmy!

1011
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,075
There you go.

1012
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,554
<i>Braddock slides to his right,
tries cutting down the ring.</i>

1013
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,830
John, get off the ropes.
Move out of there.

1014
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:45,533
<i>Lewis spins his way off the ropes...</i>

1015
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:48,337
<i>And looks to resume control
at the bell!</i>

1016
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:54,345
There we go. Suck it up.
Deep breath.

1017
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,077
Deep breath, deep.

1018
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,911
All right. That ain't bad. He's
even faster than I remember.

1019
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,922
Yeah. He's fast. Big deal.
You're not so bad yourself.

1020
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,686
What are you doing? You
beat this guy easy last time.

1021
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,126
He ain't the same guy.
You got to use your speed.

1022
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,561
Keep that jab in his face
and keep sliding to his right.

1023
01:16:09,631 --> 01:16:11,292
You see that.
Keep him in front of you.

1024
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:12,390
Cut him off, all right?

1025
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,493
And let go with the punches.
Hit him! He ain't gonna like it.

1026
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,631
I guarantee you, the more
you hit this bastard...

1027
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:19,867
the slower he's gonna get.

1028
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,433
He's an old man. He's too
slow. He can't keep up with you.

1029
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,001
Come on. Use that jab.
How's that cut?

1030
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,068
He's all right.

1031
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,341
Knock the legs out from under him.

1032
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,815
Trap him in the corner,
and really work him.

1033
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:30,442
Do not fight this fight his way.

1034
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,783
You make him fight
this fight your way!

1035
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,151
Let's go. You got him.

1036
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,554
<i>A left to the body
and a hard right to the head!</i>

1037
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:43,257
<i>A left-right-left by Lewis.
His dancing shoes are off.</i>

1038
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,799
<i>It's a fight now, folks!</i>

1039
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:48,531
Work his body, Jim!

1040
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,367
<i>Braddock punching well
with both hands now.</i>

1041
01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:52,949
<i>Toe to toe!
No one giving an inch.</i>

1042
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:57,722
<i>That left has some pop!</i>

1043
01:16:58,564 --> 01:17:01,158
<i>Jimmy's hoping those body shots
will pay dividends.</i>

1044
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:03,867
Keep him in there! Stay with him!

1045
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:08,396
Don't give him any room!
No room!

1046
01:17:09,808 --> 01:17:11,241
Get out of the corner.

1047
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:13,335
<i>Braddock pushing all the action now.</i>

1048
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:17,212
<i>Lewis can't discourage him.
Tremendous pressure from Jimmy.</i>

1049
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:20,809
<i>Lewis is running out of real estate in this
24-foot ring.</i>

1050
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,213
Jump on him!

1051
01:17:23,655 --> 01:17:25,316
<i>And Lewis is down!</i>

1052
01:17:29,328 --> 01:17:30,955
Gotcha. Good boy.

1053
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:32,394
Get up!

1054
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,760
One. There you go, get up!

1055
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:37,825
Two.
Come on.

1056
01:17:37,903 --> 01:17:39,302
Three.

1057
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:43,299
Four. Five.

1058
01:17:44,977 --> 01:17:46,035
Six.

1059
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:51,814
<i>The referee wipes his gloves</i>

1060
01:17:51,883 --> 01:17:53,407
<i>and Braddock steams
back to ring center!</i>

1061
01:17:53,485 --> 01:17:54,782
Close it down.

1062
01:17:55,621 --> 01:17:57,179
<i>Another big right by Braddock!</i>

1063
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:00,782
<i>Lewis is just a piece of meat
as Braddock is carving him up!</i>

1064
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:05,927
<i>Braddock is now dominating Lewis!
Here comes Jimmy!</i>

1065
01:18:19,411 --> 01:18:21,276
Side to side!
Side to side!

1066
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:24,006
<i>In the tenth, riding high
after his dazzling victory...</i>

1067
01:18:24,082 --> 01:18:25,481
<i>over John Henry Lewis...</i>

1068
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:28,417
<i>Jim Braddock has just hit
a wall named Art Lasky.</i>

1069
01:18:32,057 --> 01:18:33,752
He can't keep taking those body shots.

1070
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:36,225
I know. He's cracked
a couple of ribs for sure.

1071
01:18:38,604 --> 01:18:40,265
<i>Lasky walks through those jabs...</i>

1072
01:18:40,339 --> 01:18:42,307
<i>and keeps working on Braddock's body.</i>

1073
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:43,967
<i>But Braddock won't fold!</i>

1074
01:18:44,043 --> 01:18:47,308
<i>He's making Lasky work hard for every minute of
every round.</i>

1075
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:49,575
That's it, get on him!

1076
01:18:52,885 --> 01:18:55,479
There you go, James!
That's it!

1077
01:19:02,295 --> 01:19:04,525
<i>Lasky's starting to impose his will.</i>

1078
01:19:04,597 --> 01:19:06,997
<i>He's showing why Jimmy Johnston is
making noises...</i>

1079
01:19:07,066 --> 01:19:09,432
<i>about matching him
with Max Baer for the title.</i>

1080
01:19:13,406 --> 01:19:14,805
Break it up!

1081
01:19:15,641 --> 01:19:17,438
Come on. Break free.

1082
01:19:18,845 --> 01:19:20,039
Break.

1083
01:19:26,652 --> 01:19:29,052
Don't sit down. You're
not tired. You're fine.

1084
01:19:29,122 --> 01:19:31,818
Get that thing out of here!
He don't need it!

1085
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:33,290
Is he looking over at you?

1086
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:35,384
Shake your head
like you don't need it.

1087
01:19:35,461 --> 01:19:37,895
Shake your head like
you don't want it. There.

1088
01:19:37,964 --> 01:19:40,762
Why isn't he sitting down?
Pay attention.

1089
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:42,130
Yeah, now he's gonna wonder:

1090
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:44,795
"If Braddock is such an old
man, why is he still standing?

1091
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:46,532
Why is he still
coming at me?"

1092
01:19:47,607 --> 01:19:50,804
You're stronger than this guy.
Don't back up! Don't back off!

1093
01:19:51,778 --> 01:19:52,938
This guy is a bull-rusher.

1094
01:19:53,012 --> 01:19:55,879
He's gonna keep coming at you
all night until you stop him.

1095
01:19:56,215 --> 01:19:57,978
He can't back up.
You stop him.

1096
01:19:58,985 --> 01:20:00,816
You gotta beat this son of a bitch!

1097
01:20:00,887 --> 01:20:03,583
You gotta beat this son of
a bitch from the inside out!

1098
01:20:03,656 --> 01:20:05,556
You hear me?
You gotta get in there.

1099
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:07,115
You get in there and you hit him...

1100
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:09,388
and you keep hitting him
until you break his nose.

1101
01:20:09,462 --> 01:20:11,657
You fill his face with blood.

1102
01:20:12,465 --> 01:20:15,764
Beat him from the inside
out, Jim! From the inside out!

1103
01:20:16,302 --> 01:20:18,031
<i>Lasky continues to fire.</i>

1104
01:20:18,104 --> 01:20:20,368
<i>Braddock looks like
he's finally starting to wilt.</i>

1105
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:22,339
That's it!
That's more like it!

1106
01:20:24,577 --> 01:20:25,737
Back him up!

1107
01:20:27,914 --> 01:20:30,109
<i>Lasky now looking
to put a Grimm ending...</i>

1108
01:20:30,183 --> 01:20:32,014
<i>to Braddock's
fairy-tale comeback.</i>

1109
01:20:32,084 --> 01:20:34,018
<i>Lasky pounding hard shots to the body.</i>

1110
01:20:37,990 --> 01:20:39,981
<i>Braddock just took a tremendous shot!</i>

1111
01:20:40,059 --> 01:20:42,254
<i>A hard right to the head which knocked
his mouthpiece...</i>

1112
01:20:42,328 --> 01:20:43,488
<i>to the canvas.</i>

1113
01:21:12,558 --> 01:21:14,890
<i>Braddock just took Lasky's best shot!</i>

1114
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:16,519
<i>And it didn't even faze him!</i>

1115
01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:38,646
Get in there and take that sucker!

1116
01:21:40,386 --> 01:21:42,513
<i>He's showing tremendous determination!</i>

1117
01:21:48,294 --> 01:21:50,455
Right in there and get his nose!

1118
01:21:57,036 --> 01:21:59,027
<i>Braddock comes in
with a hard shot to the body!</i>

1119
01:21:59,105 --> 01:22:01,130
<i>The younger Lasky looks like
he's starting to wilt...</i>

1120
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,198
<i>under the pressure from the Bulldog of
North Bergen.</i>

1121
01:22:04,677 --> 01:22:06,235
<i>Braddock is now back on the attack!</i>

1122
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:08,976
<i>Another vicious combination
by Braddock!</i>

1123
01:22:09,048 --> 01:22:10,982
<i>And Lasky's flowing blood
from the nose!</i>

1124
01:22:11,617 --> 01:22:13,482
<i>The 15th and final round.</i>

1125
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:15,543
<i>Braddock now looks
like the younger fighter...</i>

1126
01:22:15,621 --> 01:22:17,282
<i>and grimly determined.</i>

1127
01:22:17,356 --> 01:22:20,223
<i>The Garden is on its feet! Jim Braddock will
not be denied!</i>

1128
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:24,625
<i>There's the bell! This one goes
to the scorecards.</i>

1129
01:22:26,899 --> 01:22:30,858
<i>And the winner
by unanimous decision...</i>

1130
01:22:31,337 --> 01:22:33,669
<i>James J. Braddock!</i>

1131
01:22:51,857 --> 01:22:53,347
Thanks, buddy.

1132
01:22:57,363 --> 01:22:58,728
Max? What?

1133
01:23:01,734 --> 01:23:03,497
Save a little bit of it...

1134
01:23:03,569 --> 01:23:05,230
Jimmy Braddock just beat Lasky.

1135
01:23:05,604 --> 01:23:07,265
They made him
the number one contender.

1136
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:09,035
Max, when are we gonna go to... Shut up.

1137
01:23:09,108 --> 01:23:10,973
Maxie, you...
Shut up!

1138
01:23:18,718 --> 01:23:21,186
I'm not gonna fight Jimmy
Braddock. He's a chump.

1139
01:23:22,521 --> 01:23:26,787
You tell Johnston to bring me
somebody who can fight back.

1140
01:23:27,393 --> 01:23:30,328
You gonna bust your contract?
It's done, Max.

1141
01:23:42,975 --> 01:23:45,034
That's him? Yeah?
Yes, it is.

1142
01:23:45,111 --> 01:23:47,045
I'm telling you. That's Braddock.

1143
01:24:29,188 --> 01:24:30,678
Hey, Mrs. Braddock.

1144
01:24:34,427 --> 01:24:35,860
Sara's here.

1145
01:24:36,228 --> 01:24:37,718
Yeah?
Yeah.

1146
01:24:37,797 --> 01:24:39,162
I got her to sleep.

1147
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:41,961
Hey, Jim.

1148
01:24:44,336 --> 01:24:46,099
Mike's gone missing.

1149
01:24:47,273 --> 01:24:48,570
How long?

1150
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:51,741
Three days.

1151
01:24:52,411 --> 01:24:54,971
I've been staying at my
brother's since Jake cut him.

1152
01:24:55,815 --> 01:24:58,340
Jake fired him?
I didn't know that.

1153
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:02,544
You know how Mike gets.
All his talk. So much trouble.

1154
01:25:04,824 --> 01:25:07,292
He's been sleeping nights
down in the Hooverville.

1155
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:10,226
My brother didn't have room
for both him and us.

1156
01:25:10,863 --> 01:25:13,855
Mike said, you know, if he had
to stay down there anyway...

1157
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:16,458
he was gonna try
to get everybody organized.

1158
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:20,537
Something's
wrong, Jim. I know it.

1159
01:25:21,674 --> 01:25:24,199
Now I'm hearing there's
some trouble in Hooverville.

1160
01:25:25,044 --> 01:25:27,444
He wouldn't leave me
and the baby for this long.

1161
01:25:29,181 --> 01:25:30,842
He just wouldn't.

1162
01:25:32,084 --> 01:25:34,177
I didn't know
who else to come to, Jim.

1163
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:45,559
Come on, out of
the way! Beat it! Move along!

1164
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,074
Get the hell out of here, coppers!

1165
01:25:59,512 --> 01:26:01,537
Mike? Mike Wilson!

1166
01:26:03,782 --> 01:26:04,771
Mike Wilson!

1167
01:26:07,887 --> 01:26:10,253
... do nothing. If
you let these Commies in here...

1168
01:26:10,322 --> 01:26:13,257
and start a riot, then what
do you think's gonna happen?

1169
01:26:13,826 --> 01:26:15,054
Get over here.

1170
01:26:15,127 --> 01:26:16,116
On your feet!

1171
01:26:16,795 --> 01:26:19,628
You pull a knife on me,
you son of a bitch?

1172
01:26:24,303 --> 01:26:25,895
What the hell happened here?

1173
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:28,633
We tried to break up
these agitators, peaceful-like...

1174
01:26:28,707 --> 01:26:30,607
but they charged us.
What is this?

1175
01:26:30,676 --> 01:26:32,769
The horses got spooked.
Wagons turned over.

1176
01:26:32,845 --> 01:26:35,075
Three or four of them got run
over. They're hurt pretty bad.

1177
01:26:35,648 --> 01:26:37,616
This is a
mess. One hell of a mess.

1178
01:26:37,683 --> 01:26:40,243
What did I tell you?
Get back.

1179
01:26:41,187 --> 01:26:43,519
Don't move those
two. Wait for the stretcher.

1180
01:26:44,156 --> 01:26:46,181
Keep those bastards back!

1181
01:26:48,427 --> 01:26:51,260
Get those guys next,
the ones who got trampled on.

1182
01:26:58,804 --> 01:27:01,637
Hey, Jim.
Mike.

1183
01:27:06,478 --> 01:27:07,945
You're gonna be okay, Mike.

1184
01:27:08,013 --> 01:27:09,605
Yeah, tell Sara.

1185
01:27:10,482 --> 01:27:12,712
Will you tell her I'm
gonna be... I'll tell Sara.

1186
01:27:12,785 --> 01:27:14,446
I'm gonna be late, Jimmy.

1187
01:27:55,527 --> 01:27:57,461
"Our Father, who art in heaven,

1188
01:27:57,529 --> 01:27:58,894
"Hallowed be thy name.

1189
01:27:58,964 --> 01:28:03,401
"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be
done on earth as it is in heaven.

1190
01:28:04,336 --> 01:28:06,327
"Give us this day our daily bread.

1191
01:28:06,405 --> 01:28:08,805
"And forgive us our trespasses...

1192
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:11,809
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1193
01:28:11,944 --> 01:28:16,142
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."

1194
01:28:28,727 --> 01:28:29,989
How about it, Pete?

1195
01:28:30,062 --> 01:28:31,791
All right,
fellas. Fellas, that's it.

1196
01:28:31,864 --> 01:28:33,991
Now, keep your questions short
and to the point.

1197
01:28:34,066 --> 01:28:35,761
We're gonna
start off with Frank Essex.

1198
01:28:35,834 --> 01:28:37,199
Frank Essex.

1199
01:28:37,269 --> 01:28:38,827
All right, take it easy, Petey, jeez.

You got a lot of reporters here today.

1202
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:44,202
A lot of people are interested
in this fight.

1203
01:28:44,276 --> 01:28:46,574
What do you got to say
to your fans today, Jimmy?

1204
01:28:49,348 --> 01:28:51,782
I guess I'm grateful
for the opportunity.

1205
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:58,087
I know that these days not
everybody gets a second chance.

1206
01:28:59,491 --> 01:29:01,516
You know, I have a lot
to be grateful for.

1207
01:29:01,593 --> 01:29:05,552
You know, I have three beautiful,
healthy, troublemaking kids.

You know, I have the prettiest

1210
01:29:12,938 --> 01:29:17,170
Two days ago, we ran a story about
you giving your relief money back.

1211
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:19,075
Can you tell our readers why?

1212
01:29:22,014 --> 01:29:24,608
I believe we live in a great country.

1213
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:28,415
A country that's great enough
to help a man financially...

1214
01:29:28,487 --> 01:29:30,284
when he's in trouble.

1215
01:29:31,156 --> 01:29:35,252
But lately I have had some good
fortune and I'm back in the black.

1216
01:29:36,962 --> 01:29:38,554
And I just thought I should return it.

1217
01:29:39,131 --> 01:29:40,359
Wilson, you're up.

1218
01:29:40,432 --> 01:29:41,456
Yeah, over here.

1219
01:29:41,533 --> 01:29:43,524
Listen, what's the first thing
you're gonna do...

1220
01:29:43,602 --> 01:29:44,660
if you make world champion?

1221
01:29:45,504 --> 01:29:49,270
First thing, I'm gonna have
to go and buy some turtles.

1222
01:29:49,408 --> 01:29:50,636
What's that? Turtles?

1223
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:52,142
Yeah, well, I said to the kids when...

1224
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:53,678
I was leaving the house
this morning...

1225
01:29:53,746 --> 01:29:55,338
that I was gonna
bring back the title...

1226
01:29:55,414 --> 01:29:57,211
and they thought
I said "turtle."

1227
01:29:58,917 --> 01:29:59,941
Yeah.

1228
01:30:00,018 --> 01:30:01,713
So naturally,
I don't want to let them down.

1229
01:30:01,787 --> 01:30:03,880
But if I could bring home
the title and a turtle...

1230
01:30:03,956 --> 01:30:05,856
they sure would be tickled.

1231
01:30:05,924 --> 01:30:08,051
You got that?
"Title, turtle," right?

It's been a while.

01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,929
What's changed, Jimmy?

1235
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,026
I mean, you couldn't win a
fight for love or money, right?

1236
01:30:18,103 --> 01:30:20,128
How do you explain your comeback?

1237
01:30:20,372 --> 01:30:21,839
Well, you know, the truth is, Jake...

1238
01:30:21,907 --> 01:30:24,341
for a number of years there
we was fighting injured.

1239
01:30:25,077 --> 01:30:28,137
I broke my hand more than once.

1240
01:30:29,047 --> 01:30:31,538
I got in a car accident one
time, we was on the road...

1241
01:30:31,617 --> 01:30:33,915
and I had to get that fixed.

1242
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,688
I had a run of bad luck.

1243
01:30:39,024 --> 01:30:42,187
And, this time around,
I know what I'm fighting for.

1244
01:30:42,261 --> 01:30:44,286

for Mrs. Braddock.

1250

Mrs. Braddock, my readers
would love to know...

1251
01:30:58,043 --> 01:31:00,341
how do you feel about the fact that...

1252

Max Baer's killed two men in the ring?

1253
01:31:03,949 --> 01:31:05,746
So how do you feel about that, ma'am?

1254
01:31:06,351 --> 01:31:08,251
Are you scared
for your husband's life?

1255
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,187
She's scared for Max Baer, is
who she's scared for, Mr. Lewis.

1256
01:31:11,256 --> 01:31:14,350
Okay, how about
one more question, folks?

1257
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:26,928
Said downstairs you wanted to see us.

1258
01:31:27,005 --> 01:31:28,905
Joe, Jim, come on in.
Have a seat.

1259
01:31:30,742 --> 01:31:32,107
Right here.

1260
01:31:34,513 --> 01:31:36,538
Editorial says
this fight is good as murder.

1261
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:40,814
And everybody associated with
it should be hauled into court...

1262
01:31:40,886 --> 01:31:42,478
and prosecuted afterwards.

1263
01:31:42,554 --> 01:31:44,681
They say the paper's getting
all sorts of letters...

1264
01:31:44,756 --> 01:31:46,621
from people saying
you're their inspiration.

1265
01:31:46,692 --> 01:31:48,421
Like you saved their lives
or something.

1266
01:31:48,494 --> 01:31:50,462
If you ask me, it's a lot of crap.

1267
01:31:50,829 --> 01:31:52,490
But if I'm gonna promote this fight...

1268
01:31:52,564 --> 01:31:55,226
I'm not getting hung out to
dry if something happens to you.

1269
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:56,631
You're all heart.

1270
01:31:57,769 --> 01:31:59,202
My heart's for my family, Joe.

1271
01:31:59,271 --> 01:32:00,863
My brains and my balls
are for business...

1272
01:32:00,939 --> 01:32:01,928
and this is business.

1273
01:32:02,007 --> 01:32:03,804
You got me?
Gotcha.

1274
01:32:08,046 --> 01:32:10,640
You will know exactly
what you're up against.

1275
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:13,317
And my attorney,
Mr. Mills...

1276
01:32:13,385 --> 01:32:16,445
will witness that I've done
everything in my power to warn you.

1277
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:21,759
You know, I seen the Carnera fight.

1278
01:32:22,661 --> 01:32:24,288
Carnera's height saved him.

1279
01:32:24,363 --> 01:32:26,160
He was knocked down 12 times.

1280
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:28,961
Exactly. Would've been worse
if he was shorter.

1281
01:32:29,034 --> 01:32:32,003
Baer had to punch up to hit
him. Took a little something off.

1282
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:42,571
That's Frankie Campbell.

1283
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:45,376
Stand-up fighter,
knows how to take a punch.

1284
01:32:47,185 --> 01:32:48,777
His style familiar, Jim?

1285
01:32:50,255 --> 01:32:53,884
Like looking in a mirror, huh?
Hey, he don't need to see this.

1286
01:32:53,959 --> 01:32:55,722
He'll see it
or I'll call off the fight.

1287
01:33:07,406 --> 01:33:09,374
You see that combination?

1288
01:33:09,441 --> 01:33:11,136
Campbell didn't go down
on the first punch.

1289
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:12,972
He was a tough guy.

1290
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:16,748
Second one killed him on the spot.

1291
01:33:23,655 --> 01:33:25,953
Just cut it off, will you?

1292
01:33:32,297 --> 01:33:35,926
The autopsy said that his
brain was knocked loose...

1293
01:33:36,468 --> 01:33:37,958
from the connecting tissue.

1294
01:33:40,572 --> 01:33:43,200
Consider your ass fully covered, okay?

1295
01:33:46,778 --> 01:33:48,268
Run it again.

1296
01:34:53,645 --> 01:34:55,374
Remember Ernie Schaaf?

1297
01:34:55,447 --> 01:34:57,745
Nice guy. You
lost one to him in '31.

1298
01:34:58,650 --> 01:35:00,914
Ernie took one of those
on the chin from Baer.

1299
01:35:01,386 --> 01:35:02,978
He was dead and didn't know it.

1300
01:35:03,055 --> 01:35:06,047
Next fight, first little nothing
jab put him to sleep forever.

1301
01:35:06,124 --> 01:35:07,523
Detached brain, they said.

1302
01:35:10,429 --> 01:35:11,555
Joe?

1303
01:35:12,898 --> 01:35:14,263
No snappy comeback?

1304
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:19,495
It ain't my skull the guy's
gonna try and stove in.

1305
01:35:20,539 --> 01:35:21,528
You want to think about it?

1306
01:35:24,376 --> 01:35:25,809
You think you're telling me something?

1307
01:35:27,713 --> 01:35:30,876
What, like, boxing's
dangerous, something like that?

1308
01:35:33,085 --> 01:35:35,849
You don't think triple shifts or
working nights on the scaffolds...

1309
01:35:35,921 --> 01:35:37,354
is just as likely to get a guy killed?

1310
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:42,050
How many guys died the other
night living in cardboard shacks...

1311
01:35:42,127 --> 01:35:43,185
trying to save on rent money?

1312
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:47,359
Guys who were trying to feed their
family. 'Cause men like you...

1313
01:35:47,432 --> 01:35:49,764
have not yet quite figured out
a way to make money...

1314
01:35:49,835 --> 01:35:51,166
out of watching that guy die.

1315
01:35:51,236 --> 01:35:54,603
In my profession,
and it's my profession...

1316
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:57,530
I'm a little more fortunate.

1317
01:36:03,982 --> 01:36:07,577
All righty then. You guys
have dinner here tonight.

1318
01:36:08,086 --> 01:36:09,519
Take your wives. It's on me.

1319
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:11,587
We'll snap some pics on your way out.

1320
01:36:12,624 --> 01:36:14,023
If you change your mind tomorrow...

1321
01:36:14,092 --> 01:36:15,821
at least we got some
good press out of it.

1322
01:36:15,894 --> 01:36:17,759
Good. Come on.

1323
01:36:29,775 --> 01:36:31,640
It's gorgeous!

1324
01:36:33,311 --> 01:36:35,506
Jimmy, can we get silver
faucets? Of course.

1325
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:37,571
How many you
want? A dozen? Right.

1326
01:36:37,649 --> 01:36:40,083
Listen. A little bird told me
to check the evening edition.

1327
01:36:40,152 --> 01:36:41,619
So let's see what we got.

1330
01:36:48,794 --> 01:36:51,058

You know what?
I got the bill here. Yeah.

1346
01:37:36,374 --> 01:37:39,366
Johnston. He's a big spender.
He's gonna leave a big, big tip.

1347
01:37:39,444 --> 01:37:41,378
Yeah. He's a real peach.

1348
01:37:41,446 --> 01:37:43,277
Gotta love the guy.
Right, sweetie?

1349
01:37:43,348 --> 01:37:45,111
Look at this.
This is me?

1350
01:37:45,183 --> 01:37:46,172
I know it is.

1351
01:37:50,121 --> 01:37:51,247
Jimmy.

1352
01:38:10,909 --> 01:38:12,001
Oh, boy.

1353
01:38:13,879 --> 01:38:17,246
You think Johnston set that
up? Oh, yeah. I think. Maybe.

Yeah?

1359
01:38:34,933 --> 01:38:37,197
Get the coats.
Jim.

1360
01:38:46,811 --> 01:38:48,540
Well, if it ain't Cinderella Man.

1361
01:38:49,881 --> 01:38:51,371
Thanks for the champagne,
Mr. Baer.

1362
01:38:51,449 --> 01:38:54,612
You're doing a great job publicizing
the fight. I really appreciate it.

1363
01:38:54,686 --> 01:38:57,985
I hope it's gonna be a very
successful night for both of us.

1364
01:38:58,056 --> 01:39:00,547
You keep telling people you're
gonna kill me in the ring.

1365
01:39:01,893 --> 01:39:03,326
I got three kids at home.

1366
01:39:03,395 --> 01:39:05,590
You're upsetting my family,
particularly my wife.

1367
01:39:05,664 --> 01:39:07,188
Listen, Braddock.

1368
01:39:07,966 --> 01:39:10,696
I'm asking you sincerely
not to take this fight.

1369
01:39:11,336 --> 01:39:14,601
Now, you seem like a decent
fellow. People admire you.

1370
01:39:14,973 --> 01:39:16,338
I really don't want to hurt you.

1371
01:39:17,609 --> 01:39:19,076
It's no joke, pal.

1372
01:39:20,578 --> 01:39:22,739
People die in fairy tales
all the time.

1373
01:39:22,814 --> 01:39:24,304
Hey, Max, how about a picture?

1374
01:39:24,382 --> 01:39:25,644
Hey, Jim! How about a shot?

1375
01:39:25,717 --> 01:39:27,480
There you go. Take it easy. Just smile.

1376
01:39:27,552 --> 01:39:28,883
One more!

1377
01:39:29,087 --> 01:39:31,647
Yeah. I think the smart thing
would be for you to take a fall.

1378
01:39:32,223 --> 01:39:34,350
Circus act's over, old man.

1379
01:39:37,462 --> 01:39:39,089
Right here, Max.
There you go.

1380
01:39:39,164 --> 01:39:42,031
I think I'll go a few rounds
with the dancing Baer.

1381
01:39:42,267 --> 01:39:43,734
Yeah, there you go.

1382
01:39:44,302 --> 01:39:46,361
Come on, Jim.
Very good. Okay.

1383
01:39:46,438 --> 01:39:47,905
Come on.
Okay.

1384
01:39:48,006 --> 01:39:51,498
Hey, we'll see you in the
ring. How about that, champ?

1385
01:39:51,876 --> 01:39:53,400
Come on. Let's go, Jim.

1386
01:39:53,478 --> 01:39:55,139
Max, my wife, Mae.

1387
01:39:55,714 --> 01:39:57,045
You ought to talk to him, Mae.

1388
01:39:57,882 --> 01:39:59,975
You are far too pretty to be a widow.

1389
01:40:01,886 --> 01:40:03,877
That's not nice, Max.
Not nice. Come on.

1390
01:40:03,955 --> 01:40:06,719
On second thought, maybe I can
comfort you after he's gone.

1391
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:09,851
Hey, I said shut your
goddamn mouth, you punk!

1392
01:40:15,633 --> 01:40:17,999
Sorry.
Send me the cleaning bill.

1393
01:40:19,337 --> 01:40:20,804
Get that, boys?

1394
01:40:21,206 --> 01:40:23,504
Now he's got his wife
doing his fighting for him.

1395
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:30,104
Yeah. Ain't she something?

1396
01:40:34,986 --> 01:40:36,214
All right. Get me a drink.

1397
01:40:47,532 --> 01:40:49,659
All right.
Three-punch combo, okay?

1398
01:40:50,068 --> 01:40:52,263
Pop, pop, bang. Come on.

1399
01:40:54,406 --> 01:40:55,395
Yeah.

1400
01:40:55,473 --> 01:40:57,373
Oh, that's good.
One more time.

1401
01:40:57,442 --> 01:41:00,240
Keep your thumbs tucked in.
Keep your elbows in.

1402
01:41:00,378 --> 01:41:02,278
All right.
That's enough, now.

1403
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:03,712
There's some sting in that.

1404
01:41:03,782 --> 01:41:05,181
That's enough, please.

1405
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:07,184
Good. Yeah, that's good. Bang!

1406
01:41:09,687 --> 01:41:11,416
I want a turn, Dad. All right.

1407
01:41:11,489 --> 01:41:13,753
Hey, where's your defense?
Come on, get your hand up.

1408
01:41:13,825 --> 01:41:14,814
I want a turn.

1409
01:41:17,095 --> 01:41:19,222
Left, right,
left. Pop, pop, bang.

1410
01:41:24,235 --> 01:41:25,896
Come on, Howie.

1411
01:41:27,806 --> 01:41:30,604
All right, that's enough!
No boxing in the house!

1412
01:41:30,875 --> 01:41:32,775
No boxing out of the house.
All right?

1413
01:41:32,844 --> 01:41:34,505
No boxing. Period!

1414
01:41:35,213 --> 01:41:36,703
You're gonna stay in school.

1415
01:41:36,781 --> 01:41:38,009
Then you're gonna go to college...

1416
01:41:38,083 --> 01:41:39,516
and you're gonna have professions.

1417
01:41:39,584 --> 01:41:42,815
Because you're not gonna have
your skulls smashed in, too!

1418
01:41:42,921 --> 01:41:45,355
Do you understand me?
Is that clear?

1419
01:41:54,099 --> 01:41:57,398
Hey, why don't you boys go and
get ready for bed, all right?

1420
01:42:20,758 --> 01:42:22,385
I used to pray...

1421
01:42:23,661 --> 01:42:26,095
for you to get hurt just enough...

1422
01:42:27,432 --> 01:42:29,491
so you couldn't fight anymore.

1423
01:42:30,368 --> 01:42:33,929
And when they took your license
away, even scared as I was...

1424
01:42:34,205 --> 01:42:37,504
I went to the church
and I thanked God for it.

1425
01:42:38,309 --> 01:42:39,936
'Cause I always knew...

1426
01:42:40,044 --> 01:42:43,502
a day might come
when it could kill you.

1427
01:42:44,082 --> 01:42:46,812
I just knew it, Jimmy.
And now it's here.

1428
01:42:46,885 --> 01:42:48,580
You just got the jitters, that's all.

1429
01:42:48,653 --> 01:42:51,451
He's killed two men, Jimmy!
What's worth it?

1430
01:42:53,191 --> 01:42:57,059
I have to believe I got some
kind of say over our lives. Okay?

1431
01:42:57,729 --> 01:43:00,254
You know, that if things are
bad, that we can change them...

1432
01:43:00,331 --> 01:43:02,299
we can make things better
for our family.

1433
01:43:02,367 --> 01:43:05,803
But I need you to be safe...

1434
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:07,337
Nothing's safe anymore, Mae.
... so much.

1435
01:43:07,405 --> 01:43:08,394
And without that...

1436
01:43:08,473 --> 01:43:10,703
I need you to be safe!
... nothing's safe at all.

1437
01:43:10,775 --> 01:43:11,969
All right.

1438
01:43:12,043 --> 01:43:14,910
I have stood by for all of it.

1439
01:43:16,014 --> 01:43:17,345
Until now.

1440
01:43:19,017 --> 01:43:22,111
Not for this, Jimmy.
I just can't.

1441
01:43:23,021 --> 01:43:25,251
So you train all you want.

1442
01:43:25,323 --> 01:43:28,258
Make a show of it
for yourself, for the papers.

1443
01:43:28,726 --> 01:43:31,092
But you find a way out of that fight.

1444
01:43:31,229 --> 01:43:33,754
Break your hand again if you have to.

1445
01:43:49,447 --> 01:43:50,436
Is he all right?

1446
01:43:57,555 --> 01:43:59,113
So, how's he doing?

1447
01:43:59,757 --> 01:44:01,952
He's old. He's arthritic.

1448
01:44:02,227 --> 01:44:04,787
And his ribs haven't been
right since the Lasky fight.

1449
01:44:05,496 --> 01:44:07,487
What's the bad news, sunshine?

1450
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:09,457
Joe!
What?

1451
01:44:09,534 --> 01:44:11,468
The reporters are here.
Jesus.

1452
01:44:11,536 --> 01:44:13,834
Right. Get rid of that
goddamn rib protector.

1453
01:44:13,905 --> 01:44:16,169
Jimmy!
Press is here, boy-o!

1454
01:44:16,241 --> 01:44:17,833
Get bouncing around in that ring!

1455
01:44:17,909 --> 01:44:20,742
Showtime! Big smiles!
You're the belle of the ball!

1456
01:44:20,812 --> 01:44:23,474
Baer don't need to know
about no goddamn ribs.

1457
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:54,533
Bye, Dad.

1458
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,087
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1459
01:46:33,177 --> 01:46:34,667
Hey, look. It's him.

1460
01:46:35,813 --> 01:46:36,973
There's Braddock!

1461
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:43,246
Maybe this is your day, Bulldog!

1462
01:46:43,321 --> 01:46:45,721
Look, it's him!
It's Jimmy, look, right there!

1463
01:46:45,790 --> 01:46:48,452
We're with you, Jimmy! You're
gonna beat him, Bulldog!

1464
01:46:53,931 --> 01:46:56,832
Well, look who's
here. Hi, Aunt Alice.

1465
01:46:56,901 --> 01:46:58,368
Come on in.

1466
01:46:59,537 --> 01:47:01,266
No radio, all right?

1467
01:47:02,306 --> 01:47:05,036
Yeah, sure.
All right. Be back soon.

1468
01:47:27,131 --> 01:47:30,328
Hello, Mae.
I came to pray for Jim.

1469
01:47:32,837 --> 01:47:34,498
So did they.

1470
01:47:35,673 --> 01:47:36,765
Yeah.

1471
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:48,851
They all think
that Jim's fighting for them.

1472
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:49,837
Hey.

1473
01:48:52,717 --> 01:48:53,741
Yeah?

1474
01:48:53,851 --> 01:48:55,978
Who beat that John Henry Lewis?

1475
01:48:59,257 --> 01:49:01,487
That Braddock guy.
Correct.

1476
01:49:02,927 --> 01:49:05,020
Who whupped that Art Lasky punk?

1477
01:49:05,429 --> 01:49:07,693
James J. Braddock.
Correct again.

1478
01:49:08,332 --> 01:49:09,959
Now, refresh me on this one.

1479
01:49:10,034 --> 01:49:13,299
Who was it took that Corn Griffin
and turned him inside out...

1480
01:49:13,371 --> 01:49:16,169
with no questions asked?
Who was that?

1481
01:49:17,208 --> 01:49:18,197
I used to think it was me...

1482
01:49:18,276 --> 01:49:19,709
but now I'm kinda thinking it was you.

1483
01:49:19,777 --> 01:49:22,211
No, don't you sell yourself short.

1484
01:49:23,047 --> 01:49:26,414
At some stage, you think maybe
you're gonna do some taping here?

1485
01:49:27,518 --> 01:49:29,076
Why not?

1486
01:49:34,992 --> 01:49:37,859
All right, let's see.
How's that?

1487
01:49:39,697 --> 01:49:40,823
What?

1488
01:50:00,351 --> 01:50:01,818
Excuse me, ma'am.

1489
01:50:10,494 --> 01:50:13,019
You can't win without me behind you.

1490
01:50:16,267 --> 01:50:18,667
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

1491
01:50:28,212 --> 01:50:30,237
Maybe I understand some.

1492
01:50:31,382 --> 01:50:33,247
About having to fight.

1493
01:50:34,819 --> 01:50:37,549
So you just remember who you are.

1494
01:50:38,689 --> 01:50:41,180
You're the Bulldog of Bergen...

1495
01:50:41,258 --> 01:50:43,658
and the pride of New Jersey.

1496
01:50:44,462 --> 01:50:46,396
You're everybody's hope.

1497
01:50:47,698 --> 01:50:49,791
And you're your kids' hero.

1498
01:50:51,268 --> 01:50:55,398
And you are
the champion of my heart...

1499
01:50:55,606 --> 01:50:57,267
James J. Braddock.

1500
01:51:07,318 --> 01:51:09,411
You know, you better get home.

1501
01:51:10,554 --> 01:51:13,045
You know, boxers hang around
places like this...

1502
01:51:13,124 --> 01:51:16,059
and you don't want to get tangled
up with that kind of crowd.

1503
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:19,392
Nice girl like you.
Yeah, okay.

1504
01:51:21,132 --> 01:51:22,895
I'll see you at home.

1505
01:51:29,206 --> 01:51:30,696
Please, Jimmy.

1506
01:51:32,977 --> 01:51:34,774
I'll see you at home?

1507
01:51:36,747 --> 01:51:38,305
See you at home, baby.

1508
01:51:58,402 --> 01:52:01,098
<i>From the ringside of the
Madison Square Garden Bowl.</i>

1509
01:52:01,172 --> 01:52:02,639
<i>Tonight, our coast-to-coast
hookup...</i>

1510
01:52:02,707 --> 01:52:05,005
<i>brings you the biggest
pugilistic event of the year.</i>

1511
01:52:05,076 --> 01:52:08,068
<i>Max Baer versus the Cinderella Man,
Jimmy Braddock.</i>

1512
01:52:10,114 --> 01:52:11,308
<i>And in a few moments...</i>

1513
01:52:11,382 --> 01:52:13,543
<i>the contestants for
tonight's championship bout...</i>

1514
01:52:13,617 --> 01:52:15,778
<i>will be making their way to the ring.</i>

1515
01:52:37,108 --> 01:52:38,632
God Almighty.

1516
01:52:46,917 --> 01:52:48,908
<i>Jim Braddock's rise
from the soup lines...</i>

1517
01:52:48,986 --> 01:52:52,319
<i>to number one heavyweight contender
has truly been miraculous.</i>

1518
01:52:52,389 --> 01:52:56,155
<i>No, never in all my years have I seen this arena
so quiet.</i>

1519
01:53:25,089 --> 01:53:26,852
You can do it, Jimmy!

1520
01:53:34,899 --> 01:53:37,493
<i>James J. Braddock,
the Cinderella Man...</i>

1521
01:53:37,568 --> 01:53:39,763
<i>who just a year ago
was standing in a bread line.</i>

1522
01:53:39,837 --> 01:53:41,998
<i>Braddock's a tremendous
underdog with the bettors...</i>

1523
01:53:42,072 --> 01:53:44,404
<i>but you wouldn't know it from the reaction of
the crowd.</i>

1524
01:53:44,475 --> 01:53:47,672
<i>Madison Square Garden is on its feet and the noise
is deafening!</i>

1525
01:53:47,745 --> 01:53:50,305
<i>An astonishing crowd is
gathered here this evening.</i>

1526
01:53:50,381 --> 01:53:52,906
<i>I saw people lining up to buy
tickets tonight who looked...</i>

1527
01:53:52,983 --> 01:53:54,678
<i>as if they were spending
their last dollar.</i>

1528
01:53:54,752 --> 01:53:57,346
<i>But they're here now
and 35,000 strong!</i>

1529
01:53:57,421 --> 01:53:58,718
<i>Listen to them!</i>

1530
01:54:17,975 --> 01:54:20,205
<i>We understand Max Baer
has left his dressing room.</i>

1531
01:54:20,277 --> 01:54:21,471
<i>There he is.</i>

1532
01:54:21,712 --> 01:54:24,146
<i>Max Baer has the look and swagger of
a Hollywood star.</i>

1533
01:54:24,381 --> 01:54:26,178
<i>Tonight, though,
there'll be no play-acting...</i>

1534
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:29,447
<i>not with Jim Braddock in the ring.
This fight is for real.</i>

1535
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,512
<i>The table's been set.
Let's get to the main course.</i>

1536
01:54:36,694 --> 01:54:38,184
Gentlemen, I gave you the rules

1537
01:54:38,262 --> 01:54:39,229
in the dressing room.

1538
01:54:39,296 --> 01:54:40,763
One minute to midnight, Cinderella.

1539
01:54:40,831 --> 01:54:42,321
Yeah? Your clock's
about ticked out, asshole.

1540
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:44,094
I'm here to enforce them.
I want clean breaks.

1541
01:54:44,168 --> 01:54:45,760
Tell laughing boy here,
no backhanding.

1542
01:54:45,836 --> 01:54:47,861
I don't want any backhanding
and hitting on the breakaway.

1543
01:54:47,938 --> 01:54:49,701
No low blows!
I'll take care of this, Joe.

1544
01:54:49,773 --> 01:54:52,241
You understand? You tell this
bohunk no grabbing, no manhandling.

1545
01:54:52,309 --> 01:54:54,243
Watch your goddamn language,
you nasty little shit.

1546
01:54:54,311 --> 01:54:55,676
Look at this! No low
blows means no low blows.

1547
01:54:55,746 --> 01:54:57,407
You gonna let this little
prick talk to me like that?

1548
01:54:57,481 --> 01:54:59,608
No hitting on the
breaks. It talks!

1549
01:54:59,683 --> 01:55:01,708
Holy mackerel, it talks!
Look at that!

1550
01:55:01,785 --> 01:55:03,878
Keep your hands up at all
times to protect yourselves.

1551
01:55:03,954 --> 01:55:06,013
Now, touch gloves
and come out fighting.

1552
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:08,024
Good luck. Go to your corners.

1553
01:55:08,092 --> 01:55:10,788
I'm gonna kick his Mick balls
up to the roof of his mouth.

1554
01:55:10,861 --> 01:55:13,329
That ought to be
a familiar taste for him, huh?

1555
01:55:15,499 --> 01:55:17,091
Come on, Jimmy boy!

1556
01:55:19,203 --> 01:55:22,502
Yeah, boys, get some
pictures here! Come on!

1557
01:55:31,482 --> 01:55:34,280
You can do this.
This guy is made for you.

1558
01:55:34,985 --> 01:55:36,953
Have a picnic, all right?

1559
01:55:41,458 --> 01:55:44,052
<i>There's the bell!
And the fight is on!</i>

1560
01:55:51,568 --> 01:55:52,728
<i>The boys come out...</i>

1561
01:55:52,803 --> 01:55:55,829
<i>and immediately Braddock
shoots a left to Maxie's jaw!</i>

1562
01:55:57,708 --> 01:56:00,609
That's it!
Take it right to him, Jimmy!

1563
01:56:02,413 --> 01:56:03,539
Now, now.

1564
01:56:03,948 --> 01:56:06,746
<i>Baer snaps Braddock's head
back with two right uppercuts.</i>

1565
01:56:07,151 --> 01:56:10,211
<i>It's always a question of which Max will show up
in the first round...</i>

1566
01:56:10,287 --> 01:56:11,982
<i>the killer or the clown?</i>

1567
01:56:19,596 --> 01:56:21,063
<i>Maxie doing well.</i>

1568
01:56:21,131 --> 01:56:23,895
<i>It looks like he's enjoying himself,
mugging for the crowd.</i>

1569
01:56:23,968 --> 01:56:25,526
Take it into him!

1570
01:56:26,437 --> 01:56:29,065
<i>A big flurry by Braddock!
A vicious right to the head!</i>

1571
01:56:38,048 --> 01:56:41,711
Take it easy, pal. I'll let
it go a couple of rounds.

1572
01:56:41,785 --> 01:56:44,686
<i>Madcap Maxie is heavily favored to put
the long snore on Braddock...</i>

1573
01:56:44,755 --> 01:56:45,779
<i>in the first round.</i>

1574
01:56:45,856 --> 01:56:47,619
<i>That big right hand of his
has dynamite in it...</i>

1575
01:56:47,691 --> 01:56:49,682
<i>especially when he traps
his man on the ropes.</i>

1576
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,285
He's gonna carry him
for a couple of rounds.

1577
01:56:56,233 --> 01:56:57,632
Braddock! Break it up!

1578
01:56:57,701 --> 01:56:59,430
Break it up, I said!

1579
01:57:00,904 --> 01:57:02,496
Go on, Jimmy!

1580
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:06,202
<i>Jim survived the round and
looked pretty good doing it.</i>

1581
01:57:06,276 --> 01:57:08,710
<i>Braddock will not be bullied.
Not tonight.</i>

1582
01:57:08,779 --> 01:57:10,679
When he does this horseshit,
knock it off.

1583
01:57:10,748 --> 01:57:12,215
He's trying to thumb you.
All right?

1584
01:57:12,282 --> 01:57:15,251
And then slip inside of there
and shorten up the punches.

1585
01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:17,787
All right? Shorten them up.
That's your turf!

1586
01:57:17,855 --> 01:57:19,652
Inside is yours!

1587
01:57:19,990 --> 01:57:21,082
Good job, Braddock!

1588
01:57:21,325 --> 01:57:22,314
Come on, Braddock!

1589
01:57:22,659 --> 01:57:25,355
<i>Well, no one expected Braddock
to go past the first round.</i>

1590
01:57:25,429 --> 01:57:27,021
Shorten them up.
Stay inside of him.

1591
01:57:27,097 --> 01:57:29,031
<i>The experts at ringside
were wrong again.</i>

1592
01:57:29,099 --> 01:57:30,930
<i>Shorten them up!
There's the bell!</i>

1593
01:57:31,001 --> 01:57:33,196
<i>And here we are in the second round.</i>

1594
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:35,062
That had some salt on it!

1595
01:57:35,139 --> 01:57:37,869
<i>Braddock lands a hard right
to the head.</i>

1596
01:57:38,075 --> 01:57:40,543
<i>Max swats him away with cool contempt!</i>

1597
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:42,876
<i>He appears to be toying with Braddock.</i>

1598
01:57:42,946 --> 01:57:44,607
<i>There's no other word for it.</i>

1599
01:57:44,681 --> 01:57:48,139
<i>Max struts around the ring
without a care in the world.</i>

1600
01:57:51,722 --> 01:57:54,520
Sharp, efficient,
tough, and short! Good.

1601
01:57:59,229 --> 01:58:00,821
Knock that on out.

1602
01:58:01,765 --> 01:58:04,233
<i>And Max responds with
swinging rights and lefts.</i>

1603
01:58:04,301 --> 01:58:06,292
<i>All power punches from Maxie.</i>

1604
01:58:13,577 --> 01:58:14,601
Break him!

1605
01:58:14,678 --> 01:58:17,841
<i>And Braddock punches
right to the head!</i>

1606
01:58:22,953 --> 01:58:24,181
Cover up!

1607
01:58:26,123 --> 01:58:27,750
Is that the right spot, Jimmy?

1608
01:58:27,825 --> 01:58:29,520
All right. Break it up!

1609
01:58:29,593 --> 01:58:31,493
Break it up, you two!
Stay clean!

1610
01:58:40,671 --> 01:58:43,970
How are those ribs?
Okay. All right. Take it easy.

1611
01:58:44,041 --> 01:58:46,475
Good pace. Good pace,
Jim. Take it easy. Just breathe.

1612
01:58:46,543 --> 01:58:49,569
Deep breaths. Relax.
Good rhythm.

1613
01:58:49,646 --> 01:58:51,341
You're looking great out there, Jimmy.

1614
01:58:51,415 --> 01:58:52,882
Yeah.
You look great.

1615
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:56,579
Hey, Jim?
If he goes for your body...

1616
01:58:56,653 --> 01:58:58,883
drop the elbows on him.
Teach him a lesson.

1617
01:58:58,956 --> 01:59:00,423
Break his goddamn hand.

1618
01:59:00,491 --> 01:59:02,015
<i>That round was tough to score.</i>

1619
01:59:02,092 --> 01:59:04,253
<i>Braddock landed several surprising
right hands.</i>

1620
01:59:04,328 --> 01:59:06,353
<i>And those thunderous
body punches by the champ...</i>

1621
01:59:06,430 --> 01:59:09,160
<i>should pay dividends
in the later rounds.</i>

1622
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:13,092
<i>In the fifth, Baer's smile is gone.</i>

1623
01:59:15,038 --> 01:59:16,062
Yeah, that's it!

1624
01:59:16,140 --> 01:59:17,664
<i>Jimmy comes in with a hard right...</i>

1625
01:59:17,741 --> 01:59:20,107
<i>then neatly slides off to Baer's left.</i>

1626
01:59:20,611 --> 01:59:23,705
<i>Avoiding the counterpunch,
Jimmy sticks a jab.</i>

1627
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:29,817
<i>And now the crowd is jeering and even laughing
at the champ.</i>

1628
01:59:29,887 --> 01:59:31,752
<i>And Maxie's none too pleased.</i>

1629
01:59:32,022 --> 01:59:33,250
All right, break it.

1630
01:59:33,323 --> 01:59:34,984
Break!

1631
01:59:35,592 --> 01:59:37,822
<i>Baer backhands Braddock
across the face!</i>

1632
01:59:37,895 --> 01:59:38,919
<i>That'll cost Maxie.</i>

1633
01:59:38,996 --> 01:59:40,657
You lousy shegetz!

1634
01:59:40,731 --> 01:59:41,993
That's a warning, Max.

1635
01:59:43,867 --> 01:59:45,198
I'm sorry.

1636
01:59:47,304 --> 01:59:48,931
How's that wife of yours?

1637
01:59:49,006 --> 01:59:50,166
Break!

1638
01:59:54,378 --> 01:59:56,642
She talk about me?
Knock off the wrestling.

1639
01:59:56,713 --> 01:59:57,805
All right. Break it up!

1640
01:59:57,881 --> 01:59:58,939
Quit fooling around, Max!

1641
02:00:02,419 --> 02:00:03,750
Low blow!

1642
02:00:03,820 --> 02:00:05,014
What was that?

1643
02:00:05,088 --> 02:00:07,852
Keep them up. Wake up,
you wet son of a bitch!

1644
02:00:13,063 --> 02:00:16,191
<i>Max salutes the crowd.
He's one of a kind, folks.</i>

1645
02:00:16,533 --> 02:00:18,501
She say my name in her sleep?

1646
02:00:20,070 --> 02:00:22,766
<i>Baer took a chin-full of Braddock's head
in that clinch.</i>

1647
02:00:22,839 --> 02:00:24,739
That's it! Work his body!

1648
02:00:28,879 --> 02:00:29,971
She miss me?

1649
02:00:30,047 --> 02:00:32,174
<i>Baer grips Braddock's head
in a headlock.</i>

1650
02:00:32,249 --> 02:00:35,514
Jesus! Hey, Maxila you
gonna punch him or pork him?

1651
02:00:35,586 --> 02:00:37,076
That's your job, asshole.

1652
02:00:37,154 --> 02:00:38,416
<i>Jimmy fights his way free.</i>

1653
02:00:38,488 --> 02:00:40,080
<i>Hey, buddy...
Gets a shot in to the head.</i>

1654
02:00:40,157 --> 02:00:41,181
You kidding me?
Fantastic!

1655
02:00:42,826 --> 02:00:44,191
You're gonna get hurt.

1656
02:00:44,962 --> 02:00:48,659
<i>Braddock keeps punching. They hammer each other,
toe to toe.</i>

1657
02:00:49,266 --> 02:00:51,257
<i>Okay, break!
There's the bell!</i>

1658
02:00:53,237 --> 02:00:55,228
Keep your hands up
and your mouth shut, Maxie.

1659
02:00:55,305 --> 02:00:57,830
You watching the fight or
the cute guy in the front row?

1660
02:00:57,908 --> 02:01:00,706
Take a seat, Maxie!
He's nothing, nobody.

1661
02:01:00,777 --> 02:01:02,176
The guy has got nothing!

1662
02:01:02,246 --> 02:01:03,838
Jesus! Sit down!

1663
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:07,639
Give me the sponge.

1664
02:01:07,951 --> 02:01:09,782
What are you doing?
Don't worry about it.

1665
02:01:09,853 --> 02:01:13,482
Well, quit screwing around.
Hey! Relax.

1666
02:01:14,024 --> 02:01:15,924
Give me the goddamn water.

1667
02:01:21,765 --> 02:01:23,460
Ten seconds!

1668
02:01:33,944 --> 02:01:36,344
Hit this guy. Cut him!

1669
02:01:37,047 --> 02:01:39,481
You cut him
down to size. Cut him!

1670
02:01:41,618 --> 02:01:42,880
Oh, shit.

1671
02:01:43,453 --> 02:01:45,614
<i>In the seventh,
the boys come out again.</i>

1672
02:01:45,689 --> 02:01:47,850
<i>And Max is all business now.</i>

1673
02:01:49,993 --> 02:01:51,483
Put him away, Max! Get him!

1674
02:01:51,561 --> 02:01:54,029
Attaboy, Maxie! Attaboy!

1675
02:01:54,097 --> 02:01:55,826
Slide it, Jimmy!

1676
02:01:57,401 --> 02:01:59,301
<i>Braddock starting
to look his age here...</i>

1677
02:01:59,369 --> 02:02:01,530
<i>as Baer pushes him around the ring.</i>

1678
02:02:02,005 --> 02:02:03,563
<i>Baer swings hard to the body.</i>

1679
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:05,835
<i>Braddock gets in a right to the head.</i>

1680
02:02:06,209 --> 02:02:07,801
Murder him, Maxie!

1681
02:02:17,354 --> 02:02:19,083
Jesus Christ.

1682
02:02:19,222 --> 02:02:21,315
<i>Baer with a tremendous shot
right there!</i>

1683
02:02:21,391 --> 02:02:23,723
<i>That was the hardest blow
in the fight!</i>

1684
02:02:28,765 --> 02:02:29,789
Oh, Christ.

1685
02:02:29,866 --> 02:02:31,197
<i>Baer turns him again...</i>

1686
02:02:31,268 --> 02:02:34,032
<i>with another right to the head.
Another right. And another.</i>

1687
02:02:41,611 --> 02:02:43,306
Push him, push him!

1688
02:02:54,458 --> 02:02:56,653
<i>Braddock gets in a vicious uppercut.</i>

1689
02:02:58,495 --> 02:02:59,894
<i>Baer keeps on punching!</i>

1690
02:02:59,963 --> 02:03:01,328
Jesus, Johnny!

1691
02:03:01,398 --> 02:03:04,094
Let him go! That's enough!
Break it up!

1692
02:03:04,601 --> 02:03:06,432
You're gonna go home
in butcher paper, pal!

1693
02:03:06,503 --> 02:03:08,698
To your
corners! Butcher paper!

1694
02:03:12,709 --> 02:03:14,939
All right.
Let me see that nose.

1695
02:03:15,445 --> 02:03:16,810
Get it out. You're okay.

1696
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:18,074
Let me see it.
Tilt your head back.

1697
02:03:18,148 --> 02:03:19,843
That's nothing.
That's a piece of cake.

1698
02:03:19,916 --> 02:03:21,884
Keep your head up.
Breathe through your mouth.

1699
02:03:21,952 --> 02:03:23,317
Breathe.

1700
02:03:23,387 --> 02:03:25,878
You got all your ugly friends
down from Jersey here.

1701
02:03:25,956 --> 02:03:27,981
They're dressed up nice.
They've come to see you.

1702
02:03:28,058 --> 02:03:31,425
You're putting them to sleep.
You're not turning him anymore.

1703
02:03:31,495 --> 02:03:34,259
Come on, pick it up.
Spit that out, boy-o.

1704
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:38,300
Good boy.

1705
02:03:39,202 --> 02:03:40,533
Come on.

1706
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:45,506
<i>The boys go after each other
immediately.</i>

1707
02:03:46,076 --> 02:03:47,976
<i>Braddock gets in a left to the body.
And a hard right...</i>

1708
02:03:48,044 --> 02:03:49,739
<i>Mae.
... to Max's head.</i>

1709
02:03:49,813 --> 02:03:51,542
<i>Baer comes swinging across
with a long, swinging...</i>

1710
02:03:51,615 --> 02:03:53,606
<i>It's the cops.
... right to Braddock's head.</i>

1711
02:03:54,317 --> 02:03:55,875
<i>Braddock stumbles away.</i>

1712
02:03:55,952 --> 02:03:57,817
<i>Baer tries that right again!</i>

1713
02:03:58,555 --> 02:04:01,456
<i>They come together. Braddock swings a left
and a right.</i>

1714
02:04:01,525 --> 02:04:02,617
Please, Ma.

1715
02:04:02,692 --> 02:04:04,717
<i>Max comes back with a left and
a right of his own.</i>

1716
02:04:04,795 --> 02:04:07,229
<i>Braddock sticks out a left!
Baer still after him.</i>

1717
02:04:07,297 --> 02:04:08,355
<i>Another left!</i>

1718
02:04:08,432 --> 02:04:11,560
<i>And a hard right by Braddock
that rocked Baer for a moment!</i>

1719
02:04:11,635 --> 02:04:13,466
<i>Baer tries that right again.</i>

1720
02:04:17,107 --> 02:04:18,472
<i>A hard right to Braddock's head!</i>

1721
02:04:18,542 --> 02:04:21,272
<i>Braddock is hurt.
His legs are gone.</i>

1722
02:04:29,319 --> 02:04:31,719
<i>Braddock sticks out a left!
Another left!</i>

1723
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:39,322
<i>Neither man will back down!
It's a slugfest, folks!</i>

1724
02:04:39,396 --> 02:04:41,125
<i>And there's the bell!</i>

1725
02:04:42,332 --> 02:04:44,960
<i>James J. Braddock has exhibited
a lot of heart here...</i>

1726
02:04:45,035 --> 02:04:47,663
<i>over 11 grueling rounds
with the champion.</i>

1727
02:04:47,737 --> 02:04:51,070
<i>Nobody expected him to last more than a few innings
with Baer.</i>

1728
02:04:51,141 --> 02:04:54,042
<i>Yet here he is.
And he's held his own.</i>

1729
02:04:54,611 --> 02:04:57,512
<i>But now we head into the championship rounds,
folks.</i>

1730
02:05:00,383 --> 02:05:03,250
Hey, Jim, look at me.

1731
02:05:05,222 --> 02:05:08,385
I swear to God, boy,
win, lose or draw...

1732
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:11,392
Thanks, Joey.
For all of it.

1733
02:05:13,196 --> 02:05:16,097
You son of a bitch.
All right. Stop talking.

1734
02:05:16,166 --> 02:05:17,497
Get in there!

1735
02:05:18,435 --> 02:05:19,959
And bury him!

1736
02:05:20,036 --> 02:05:21,503
Finish him off.

1737
02:05:21,671 --> 02:05:23,104
Come on, Jimmy!

1738
02:05:29,212 --> 02:05:31,271
<i>Here in the 12th,
James J. Braddock...</i>

1739
02:05:31,348 --> 02:05:34,112
<i>is showing this crowd
what heart is all about.</i>

1740
02:05:41,591 --> 02:05:43,456
<i>Jimmy seems to be timing that left...</i>

1741
02:05:43,527 --> 02:05:45,791
<i>and has slapped it away several times.</i>

1742
02:05:49,933 --> 02:05:52,993
Keep moving, boy-o!
You stay with him!

1743
02:05:53,603 --> 02:05:54,934
Son of a bitch!

1744
02:05:55,539 --> 02:05:58,508
<i>Braddock with a shoeshine.
Left, right!</i>

1745
02:05:58,842 --> 02:06:00,969
Am I seeing what I'm seeing?

1746
02:06:01,244 --> 02:06:03,178
Finish him, Jimmy. Finish him!

1747
02:06:03,246 --> 02:06:05,237
Braddock, Braddock!

1748
02:06:14,424 --> 02:06:17,291
<i>Maxie's glamour-boy smile
is now a bloody grimace.</i>

1749
02:06:18,662 --> 02:06:21,529
<i>This crowd is desperately
hoping for a Braddock victory.</i>

1750
02:06:21,598 --> 02:06:24,761
<i>But Mr. Baer might have something to say
about that.</i>

1751
02:06:28,138 --> 02:06:29,469
Holy crap!

1752
02:06:35,745 --> 02:06:36,973
Low blow!

1753
02:06:37,047 --> 02:06:39,242
That last low blow
will cost you the round, Max.

1754
02:06:39,316 --> 02:06:41,079
Jesus!
It'll cost you the round.

1755
02:06:42,886 --> 02:06:44,945
Why don't you just kick him
in the balls, huh?

1756
02:06:45,021 --> 02:06:46,010
Joe, back in your corner!

1757
02:06:46,089 --> 02:06:48,216
What are you afraid of,
you son of a bitch?

1758
02:06:48,291 --> 02:06:49,622
Get back to your corner!

1759
02:06:52,362 --> 02:06:53,852
Come on, Ref!

1760
02:06:55,332 --> 02:06:58,597
<i>McAvoy is on the verge of
losing control of this fight.</i>

1761
02:07:02,973 --> 02:07:05,066
Knock him on the ground, Bulldog!

1762
02:07:07,544 --> 02:07:09,512
Last round.
That's right! Next champ!

1763
02:07:09,579 --> 02:07:11,444
You better worry about Baer's
corner in this next round.

1764
02:07:11,514 --> 02:07:12,708
You know what I mean.

1765
02:07:12,782 --> 02:07:15,478
You won this one.
It's a cinch. It is yours.

1766
02:07:16,753 --> 02:07:19,722
But I want you to play it
cagey now. All right?

1767
02:07:20,023 --> 02:07:21,786
I know you don't like laying back...

1768
02:07:21,858 --> 02:07:23,985
but I want you to stay away
from his right...

1769
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:26,153
do you understand me?
Stay away.

1770
02:07:26,529 --> 02:07:27,826
Right hand.

1771
02:07:28,064 --> 02:07:31,261
You're behind.
Are you listening to me?

1772
02:07:31,334 --> 02:07:34,531
You want to lose the championship
to this goddamn nobody?

1773
02:07:34,804 --> 02:07:36,169
Hey. Come on, Jimmy!

1774
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:37,570
This is your night.

1775
02:07:40,010 --> 02:07:42,001
Stay away. Put him down!

1776
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:46,278
Use your right hand.
Right hand.

1777
02:07:51,821 --> 02:07:54,790
Ten seconds!
Come on now. Finish him.

1778
02:07:58,695 --> 02:08:01,687
It's the last round,
Jimmy. There ain't no more.

1779
02:08:02,332 --> 02:08:06,132
You play this bastard smart
and they can't take it from you!

1780
02:08:15,512 --> 02:08:17,343
<i>One more round to go, folks.</i>

1781
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:19,175
<i>McAvoy stands at center ring...</i>

1782
02:08:19,249 --> 02:08:21,444
<i>waiting for the fighters to join him.</i>

1783
02:08:42,872 --> 02:08:44,305
Touch gloves.

1784
02:08:46,609 --> 02:08:48,600
<i>The boys touch gloves at center ring.</i>

1785
02:08:49,579 --> 02:08:50,876
<i>And now they're right back at it.</i>

1786
02:08:50,947 --> 02:08:52,209
Oh, no, Jimmy!

1787
02:08:54,718 --> 02:08:56,083
Leave him alone!

1788
02:08:57,687 --> 02:08:59,416
Stay away from him!

1789
02:08:59,856 --> 02:09:01,346
That ain't laying back!

1790
02:09:01,424 --> 02:09:03,324
<i>Braddock's corner
is yelling at Braddock...</i>

1791
02:09:03,393 --> 02:09:04,655
<i>to stay away from Baer.</i>

1792
02:09:04,728 --> 02:09:06,525
<i>Because Baer is looking
for the knockout.</i>

1793
02:09:06,596 --> 02:09:08,496
Stay off him, Jim. Come on!

1794
02:09:11,301 --> 02:09:13,132
Right hand, Max. Yes!

1795
02:09:20,944 --> 02:09:22,411
What is he, stupid?

1796
02:09:25,648 --> 02:09:27,548
Step away!

1797
02:09:27,717 --> 02:09:30,277
<i>Braddock trying to survive
this brutal onslaught!</i>

1798
02:09:30,353 --> 02:09:32,048
Stay off him!

1799
02:09:32,956 --> 02:09:34,890
Don't let him touch you!

1800
02:09:34,958 --> 02:09:36,983
Hey, looking good, Maxie!

1801
02:09:41,564 --> 02:09:44,328
Watch the uppercut! Just
stay the hell away from him!

1802
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:47,028
<i>Baer cutting loose
with thunderous shots.</i>

1803
02:09:47,103 --> 02:09:48,331
<i>A left to the body.</i>

1804
02:09:48,404 --> 02:09:49,962
<i>Baer again with a right!</i>

1805
02:09:50,039 --> 02:09:53,167
<i>Braddock covering up,
trying to hang on.</i>

1806
02:09:53,643 --> 02:09:55,008
<i>Baer looking for the knockout.</i>

1807
02:09:55,078 --> 02:09:57,774
<i>He doesn't want this one
to go to the cards, folks.</i>

1808
02:09:57,847 --> 02:10:00,111
<i>They pound each other
with lefts and rights.</i>

1809
02:10:00,183 --> 02:10:02,276
<i>Braddock blocking
with his gloves and elbows.</i>

1810
02:10:02,352 --> 02:10:04,946
<i>Snaps a big right to Maxie's jaw!</i>

1811
02:10:14,264 --> 02:10:16,664
<i>Baer smashes him with a big right!</i>

1812
02:10:24,908 --> 02:10:27,138
<i>Braddock is back on the ropes.</i>

1813
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:15,922
<i>Braddock lands a crushing right.</i>

1814
02:11:16,693 --> 02:11:18,991
<i>Maxie desperately wants
to keep the crown...</i>

1815
02:11:19,062 --> 02:11:20,529
<i>from slipping away.</i>

1816
02:11:24,033 --> 02:11:25,864
Jesus Christ.

1817
02:11:31,574 --> 02:11:32,905
Stay with him!

1818
02:11:37,714 --> 02:11:39,682
<i>Both fighters are tired.</i>

1819
02:11:49,459 --> 02:11:51,859
<i>Baer is trying wildly
for the knockout!</i>

1820
02:11:52,161 --> 02:11:53,594
<i>But Jimmy is still standing...</i>

1821
02:11:53,663 --> 02:11:56,427
<i>and he's not only standing,
he's moving forward.</i>

1822
02:12:08,811 --> 02:12:12,076
<i>This is the finish.
Both boys are tired.</i>

1823
02:12:12,315 --> 02:12:15,773
<i>This is not boxing, folks.
This is a walloping ballet.</i>

1824
02:12:20,456 --> 02:12:21,753
Ten seconds!

1825
02:12:21,824 --> 02:12:23,815
Time's up!
Son of a bitch.

1826
02:12:37,674 --> 02:12:40,768
<i>That is the bell! It's over!
This fight is over!</i>

1827
02:12:42,912 --> 02:12:44,436
Son of a bitch!

1828
02:12:52,188 --> 02:12:54,850
<i>What a fight! Unbelievable!</i>

1829
02:12:59,028 --> 02:13:00,120
<i>Braddock came into this fight...</i>

1830
02:13:00,196 --> 02:13:01,959
<i>the biggest underdog...
Come on, sweetheart.</i>

1831
02:13:02,031 --> 02:13:03,430
<i>... in pugilistic history.
You did it!</i>

1832
02:13:03,499 --> 02:13:05,831
<i>For 15 rounds he gave it everything
he had...</i>

1833
02:13:05,902 --> 02:13:08,234
<i>against the younger,
stronger champion.</i>

1834
02:13:19,582 --> 02:13:21,607
<i>We are waiting for the decision.</i>

1835
02:13:22,819 --> 02:13:24,343
Mae, it's all right.

1836
02:13:29,826 --> 02:13:31,293
Hey, McAvoy!

1837
02:13:33,062 --> 02:13:34,996
What?
Help me out here. Help me out.

1838
02:13:35,064 --> 02:13:37,897
How did you score the fight?
Nine-five, one even.

1839
02:13:38,468 --> 02:13:39,435
Which way?

1840
02:13:39,502 --> 02:13:41,299
You'll have to read it
in the papers, Sporty.

1841
02:13:41,371 --> 02:13:42,565
Oh, come on!

1842
02:13:45,541 --> 02:13:47,406
What the hell is this crap?

1843
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:53,240
I'll tell you this much, they take
this long to make a decision...

1844
02:13:53,316 --> 02:13:55,648
they're gonna decide
to screw somebody.

1845
02:13:56,586 --> 02:13:57,985
Make a decision.

1846
02:13:58,121 --> 02:14:00,146
They're gonna rob this poor bastard.

1847
02:14:00,223 --> 02:14:02,384
Unbelievable bullshit.
You win it.

1848
02:14:08,931 --> 02:14:12,697
Come on, make a decision!
Tell us who won, come on!

1849
02:14:15,304 --> 02:14:18,000
<i>The crowd, on its feet
for almost the entire fight...</i>

1850
02:14:18,074 --> 02:14:21,066
<i>is still standing, yelling for who
they clearly believe...</i>

1851
02:14:21,144 --> 02:14:23,339
<i>to be the winner of this fight.</i>

1852
02:14:24,947 --> 02:14:28,144
<i>But they'll have to wait and see how the judges
scored it.</i>

1853
02:14:45,802 --> 02:14:47,929
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1854
02:14:48,671 --> 02:14:50,696
<i>we have your decision.</i>

1855
02:14:52,408 --> 02:14:54,171
<i>It's unanimous!</i>

1856
02:14:54,510 --> 02:14:59,004
<i>Winner, and the new world
heavyweight champion...</i>

1857
02:15:00,516 --> 02:15:02,643
<i>James J. Braddock!</i>

1858
02:15:19,469 --> 02:15:20,902
You son of a bitch.

1859
02:15:21,504 --> 02:15:24,064
<i>James Braddock
has defeated Max Baer...</i>

1860
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:26,938
<i>for the heavyweight
championship of the world!</i>

1861
02:15:28,511 --> 02:15:30,570
He won!

1862
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:49,691
You earned it.
Hell of a fight.
