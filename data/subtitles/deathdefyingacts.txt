1
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,792
<i>When I was very small,</i>

2
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,770
<i>I had a gift.</i>

3
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:29,688
<i>I saw things</i>
<i>other folk didn't see.</i>

4
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:36,876
<i>It was like looking into deep water</i>
<i>and seein' things on the other side.</i>

5
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,626
<i>As I grew up,</i>
<i>the gift vanished</i>

6
00:01:40,522 --> 00:01:42,605
<i>just like</i>
<i>my mam said it would.</i>

7
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,355
<i>And I saw the world</i>
<i>as it really was</i>

8
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,481
<i>with all its sweet lies</i>
<i>and trickery.</i>

9
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:53,335
<i>Then the Great Houdini</i>
<i>came into our lives</i>

10
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,044
<i>and changed everything</i>
<i>forever.</i>

11
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,446
C'mon, Harry...

12
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:10,739
Don't do this to me again!

13
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:33,553
Up! Up!

14
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:36,054
Get the bloody thing
up now!

15
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:08,660
<i>... the Sun,</i>
<i>the Four Winds and the Sea...</i>

16
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:11,473
<i>... bowed down before</i>
<i>the Great Houdini.</i>

17
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:13,349
<i>He was a god.</i>

18
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,432
<i>That's what it said</i>
<i>in my comics.</i>

19
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:17,724
<i>If you were Houdini,</i>

20
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:20,328
<i>you wouldn't be livin'</i>
<i>in a place with a leakin'roof,</i>

21
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,620
<i>worryin'how to pay</i>
<i>the coal man.</i>

22
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,745
<i>And you wouldn't be sittin'</i>
<i>on a damp step outside the pawnshop</i>

23
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:28,350
<i>waitin'for your mam to</i>
<i>hawk her weddin'ring...</i>

24
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:30,016
<i>... yet again.</i>

25
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,579
<i>No.</i>

26
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:36,475
<i>You'd be inside somewhere</i>
<i>warm and cosy eatin' cake.</i>

27
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:38,871
Close that!
We've got work to do!

28
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:41,997
That's the wedding ring,
back in the window then, is it?

29
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,871
Only good use
I ever had for it.

30
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:46,060
Mary McGarvie.
A dream come true.

31
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:47,309
Not for you!

32
00:04:47,414 --> 00:04:47,934
Benji!

33
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:50,748
Leave ma man alone,
ya Gypsy strumpet!

34
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:53,039
I wouldn't have your hand-me-downs
if you paid me!

35
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,914
You tarted-up hussy!

36
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:58,769
You frigid old piss-pants!

37
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,228
Floozy!

38
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,249
Bloody circumcision!

39
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,499
What?

40
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:06,061
It's in the Bible...

41
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,936
Oh, give me that!

42
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,979
<i>We were a real double act,</i>
<i>my mam and me.</i>

43
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:23,251
<i>It was just us against</i>
<i>the cruel world</i>

44
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:25,230
<i>livin'by our wits.</i>

45
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:29,814
'Scuse me.

46
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,043
'Scuse me, sir.

47
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:35,335
Woops, sorry!

48
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,585
Over here, Rose!

49
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,669
I told you
to wait on the corner!

50
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,960
- There y'are, sir.
- Thank you.

51
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:52,420
You'll be after your usual
posy of violets, Mr. Robertson?

52
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,546
'Aye. They were
always her favourites.

53
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:58,358
Oh! Pockets, eh?

54
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:04,296
- Thank you, dear.
- Thank you. See you tomorrow.

55
00:06:15,964 --> 00:06:21,902
'To Charles, with never ending
love, Your Violet'.

56
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,049
<i>'You play the game</i>
<i>or you go under.'</i>

57
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:30,132
<i>That's what mam always said,</i>

58
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:34,195
<i>And if it wasn't for her,</i>
<i>we would've drowned long ago.</i>

59
00:06:36,174 --> 00:06:37,632
'Deceased:'

60
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:42,320
'Violet Robertson
- died of heart-failure.'

61
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,550
You're that unfortunate.

62
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,988
It was your long lost aunt
a week ago, was it not?

63
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,697
My condolences, Mrs. McGarvie...

64
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:53,571
You're so kind...

65
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:59,405
You'll be wanting to...
examine the Records, no doubt?

66
00:07:00,448 --> 00:07:06,490
The information you need...
may be on the... tenth shelf...

67
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,635
Or even the eleventh...

68
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:17,740
It's the details of those dear
departed one later cherishes...

69
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:19,615
...don't you think?

70
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,262
'Cherishable details,'
Mrs. McGarvie.

71
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:26,178
How right you are.

72
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,888
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

73
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:47,743
Hello again!

74
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,119
Ah! Courtship!

75
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,264
Who's the baboon?

76
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,494
Who you callin' a baboon,
ya wee poof?

77
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,098
Enough monkey play!

78
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,495
No juveniles with us,
I trust?

79
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:05,662
Then this is your last chance
to see the Tantalising...

80
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:10,975
...Princess Kali
and her Dusky Disciple!

81
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,208
Oh, be still, girl!

82
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,729
At least that's
one of you decent!

83
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,396
Hurry! Hurry!

84
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:15,251
Where've you been?

85
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:17,439
Sorry!

86
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:31,711
Kali - Kasbah - Magicaram!

87
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,357
I'm receiving a message.

88
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,545
About time, eh?
I sent it a week ago!

89
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:42,545
I see a flower...

90
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:45,358
Gallery, mam...

91
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,796
Is there anyone here named...

92
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:51,296
...Rose?

93
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:54,630
'Aye! Up here! She's up here!
Darlin', get up!

94
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,380
That's a lovely pair of red knickers
you're wearing tonight, Rose!

95
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,881
Oh! Get away with you!

96
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,651
Prove her wrong, hen!

97
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:09,526
There is one I can see...

98
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:12,965
Such a lady!

99
00:10:14,007 --> 00:10:15,569
Like a queen!

100
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:19,215
The lady's in a garden...

101
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,445
...a beautiful garden.

102
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,466
Third row...

103
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:30,362
She's like a flower herself.

104
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,279
Not a rose

105
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:36,092
a deep, dark flower

106
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,051
violet.

107
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,781
Violet's all alone.

108
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:50,364
But there's a space
beside her for another

109
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,281
one left behind
in this world.

110
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:57,343
For a moment, I saw a funny
wee man in a bowler hat...

111
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,531
Why, it's Mr. Charles Chaplin!

112
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:05,573
No. Another Charles...

113
00:11:06,824 --> 00:11:09,220
...Charles Robertson.

114
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:17,034
Charles!

115
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:18,804
Charles!

116
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:21,409
Oh, I'm sorry, Charles.

117
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,118
Violet says you're not
looking after yourself.

118
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,576
Those cuffs are frayed.

119
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,242
Violet!

120
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:29,951
She wants to say something.

121
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:32,660
She says...

122
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:36,514
She's sorry her heart
'wasny stronger'...

123
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:39,431
Do you understand
what she means, Charles?

124
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:42,973
It's how she went!

125
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,056
Her heart gave out.

126
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,181
It's true. It's true.

127
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:52,870
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

128
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,953
Who's the one
who's lost his clock?

129
00:11:54,954 --> 00:11:56,724
Have you lost something,
Charlie?

130
00:11:56,725 --> 00:11:58,391
I lost my watch!

131
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,621
It comes...

132
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,913
It comes!

133
00:12:03,913 --> 00:12:07,350
From another world,
it comes!

134
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,537
It comes!

135
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,518
Now!

136
00:12:16,206 --> 00:12:18,706
There is an inscription,
oh wise one...

137
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,101
No, no, no.
Don't tell me!

138
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:23,810
I can see it...

139
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:30,165
'To Charles,
with never ending love... '

140
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:34,124
...Your Violet'.

141
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,062
There's a chill wind
in the garden.

142
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:48,500
- Violet has to go...
- Oh, no...

143
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:50,792
'Until we meet again.'

144
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,562
'Goodbye, Charles.'

145
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,896
Goodbye... Goodbye... '

146
00:12:55,897 --> 00:12:57,772
Oh, don't go, Violet.

147
00:12:57,772 --> 00:12:59,959
Don't cling to her, Charles.

148
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,730
Be patient...

149
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:03,501
Until you meet again...

150
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:07,252
<i>A glimpse of the afterlife?</i>
<i>Or just a glimpse of mam?</i>

151
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:08,189
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

152
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:09,960
<i>We gave them</i>
<i>what they wanted.</i>

153
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,398
<i>Showbiz isn't all</i>
<i>it's cracked up to be.</i>

154
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:16,836
<i>The manager skid-addled</i>
<i>and owed us for a whole month!</i>

155
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:19,753
<i>Mam said,</i>
<i>'See? That's men for you! '

156
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:24,753
<i>And so we ended up livin'</i>
<i>in a graveyard.</i>

157
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:27,670
<i>A wee bit before our time.</i>

158
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,691
What have you got to
laugh about?

159
00:13:31,317 --> 00:13:32,879
The theatre's closed.

160
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:35,171
Those comics won't
fill your tummy!

161
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:37,462
It's just
a wee bit of fun, mam!

162
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:40,380
Oh, you sound
just like your father!

163
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,463
'Just a wee bit o' fun, hen! '

164
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:44,651
Then all of a sudden,
there was you!

165
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:47,151
Hurry up!

166
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,985
<i>Mr. Houdini was the greatest</i>
<i>trickster of them all...</i>

167
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,486
<i>... and the whole world</i>
<i>loved him for it.</i>

168
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:02,777
<i>You couldn't imagine</i>
<i>someone like that</i>

169
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:04,757
<i>could want</i>
<i>for anything at all.</i>

170
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,550
Oh, go on, mam.
Read to me.

171
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,841
Itjust says what's
in the picture.

172
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:23,404
You can read it yourself.

173
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:28,092
'On her death bed,
Houdini's beloved Mother... '

174
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:31,843
'... spoke her last words

'Do Spirits Return? '

176
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,989
Houdini says -
'Prove it! '

177
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:43,406
'Now Famous Psychics try to
Discover Those Secret Words'

178
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:02,887
'Ten thousand dollars for whoever
transmits his mother's last words'

179
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:05,596
No one could pull off that one,
could they?

180
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,180
How much is
ten thousand dollars?

181
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:16,847
He's coming here!

182
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,410
To Edinburgh!

183
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:22,993
So he is...

184
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,014
<i>Me and mam thought</i>
<i>we could take on anyone</i>

185
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:27,473
<i>even the Great Houdini!</i>

186
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:42,578
Harry!

187
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,184
You still here?

188
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,746
Where else?

189
00:16:01,122 --> 00:16:02,997
You look fine, Harry.

190
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,601
I look like shit, Mr. Sugarman.

191
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:22,582
Let's go!

192
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:27,791
Hurry up!

193
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,666
Hurry up!

194
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:58,523
Hello, Edinburgh!

195
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:19,879
Houdini!

196
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,963
Mr. Houdini!
We love you, Mr. Houdini!

197
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,151
We love you! We love you!

198
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,589
Welcome back to Scotland,
Mr. Houdini!

199
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,839
Thank you, son.

200
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:40,402
That monster Nessie
still here?

201
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,381
'Aye, she's still here.

202
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,985
Well, who don't you tell Nessie
that this Harry Houdini's gonna

203
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:48,215
tie a knot in her tail and
fling her into the Scottish Ocean?!

204
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,986
What about $10,000, Mr. Houdini?

205
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,341
Are you psychic, Hamish?

206
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,486
'Cos I never met a reporter yet

207
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:53,945
who didn't know the truth
before it happened!

208
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:54,986
Oh, I don't know about that.

209
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:57,695
You put me in touch with my dear,
departed mother and it's all yours.

210
00:17:57,695 --> 00:17:59,674
- Still in good shape, Mr. Houdini?
- Never better!

211
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,341
They say you can take
a punch from any man.

212
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:02,696
Elbow these freeloaders!
Get rid of them!

213
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,196
You scared of ma boy's punch,
Mr. Houdini?

214
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:09,050
I'll take your punch, sonny!

215
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,759
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
give us some room please!

216
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:16,030
Watch yourself, Harry,
this mob can smell blood!

217
00:18:21,864 --> 00:18:23,322
Go on, son!

218
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:31,656
Have you done it yet?

219
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,303
You did it, Houdini!!

220
00:18:40,304 --> 00:18:43,845
<i>Yes, the whole world loved</i>
<i>Mr. Houdini.</i>

221
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:45,825
<i>But it could never be enough.</i>

222
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,741
<i>There was something</i>
<i>dark inside him.</i>

223
00:18:48,742 --> 00:18:52,492
<i>And poor Mr. Sugarman's job was</i>
<i>to keep that dark side at bay.</i>

224
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:55,200
It's such an honour to
have you with us...

225
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:56,138
Hey!

226
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:58,013
Be careful with that trunk,
you schmuck!

227
00:18:58,118 --> 00:18:59,159
Sorry, sir!

228
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,555
Mr. Houdini's very tired
after his journey.

229
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:03,221
I'll deal with it, boss.

230
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:08,431
Come on! Quick as you can!
Quick as you can!

231
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,931
There! Carefully...

232
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:14,056
A dollar!

233
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:16,765
Thank you, sir!
Thank Mr. Houdini!

234
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:21,556
Harry! Are you all right?

235
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:29,162
Harry!

236
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:31,975
Are you all right?

237
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:36,559
I think I can wipe my own arse,
Mr. Sugarman, thank you!

238
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:45,830
It's OK, Morry.

239
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,267
Nothin' to worry about.
The golden goose is still laying.

240
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:53,123
'Houdini's Mother Dies... '

241
00:19:53,748 --> 00:19:55,518
'Houdini in Mourning.'

242
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:04,165
'Houdini Finds
Hope in Spiritualism.'

243
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,415
'Lt's a fake, says Houdini.'

244
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,790
A very private man...

245
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:30,001
'My greatest ambition is to live
and die being worthy of

246
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,980
the mother who bore me.'

247
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,981
Another bereavement,
Mrs. McGarvie?

248
00:20:42,815 --> 00:20:45,106
I'm always happy for you to...

249
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:50,315
probe the higher shelves for
those 'cherishable details'.

250
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,941
I already have all
the details I need.

251
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,546
Listen to this...

252
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,567
'Madame Clare De Lune,
Psychic Extraordinaire... '

253
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:14,484
'... respectfully accepts
Mr. Houdini's Psychic challenge'.

254
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:15,943
Clare de who?

255
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:18,234
Clare de Lune,
it's French, goddamn it.

256
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:20,109
Get yourself an education,
Sugarman.

257
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:22,923
What do you think?
Do I look like a fruit?

258
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:25,423
Like a fruit?
You look beautiful, Harry.

259
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,297
I look like a fruit.

260
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:28,860
They've got class.
I like 'em.

261
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:32,090
If you wanna look like a fruit,
Morry, you wear 'em!

262
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:35,840
And as well you know,
I've got an education -

263
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,173
in Law and in Business Management.
I've got a Diploma.

264
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:41,361
I bought it in
your glorious country.

265
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,757
Harry, everyone's a fake.

266
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:45,841
As soon as you scratch the gold-leaf,

267
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:48,757
all of these so-called
psychics are just made of lead.

268
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:50,424
It's all hocus pocus,
mumbo jumbo.

269
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,821
- So?
- So why waste our time?

270
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:56,154
I don't want to be remembered
for a bunch of dumb stunts.

271
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,696
For once, this ain't about chains
and friggin' padlocks.

272
00:21:59,697 --> 00:22:01,259
It's about science.

273
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,134
It's about proof!

274
00:22:05,322 --> 00:22:07,301
You've been pushing yourself
too hard, Harry...

275
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:09,072
Oh, get off me!

276
00:22:09,802 --> 00:22:11,052
See this?

277
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:13,135
This is from
the Scientific American.

278
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,323
The Scientific American!

279
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:17,718
And my psychic experiment
is science!

280
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:22,095
Showbiz is Showbiz, Harry.

281
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:25,011
It's not about science...

282
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:27,407
It's about nickels and dimes.

283
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,387
Nickels and dimes.

284
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:31,887
Yeah, well, you look after
the nickels and dimes

285
00:22:31,992 --> 00:22:33,762
and I'll look after the science.

286
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,515
<i>Mistress of the Skies -
<i>that was my mam.</i>

287
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:08,869
Madam...

288
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:11,474
<i>She could just pluck</i>
<i>a character off a shelf</i>

289
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,807
<i>and act as swish as</i>
<i>the best of them...</i>

290
00:23:16,266 --> 00:23:21,266
<i>... and just about manage</i>
<i>to convince herself.</i>

291
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:50,644
We've got two hours
to check the tank.

292
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:52,832
The boys'll be set
by the time we get there.

293
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:54,498
Curtain's at 8:00...

294
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:55,436
How's Security?

295
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,728
Like Mrs. Clam with a headache.

296
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,543
'I am with you, my Harry,
even in dreams.'

297
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:24,397
'Your little darling wife, Bess'.

298
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:28,668
'Little darling wife'.

299
00:24:53,254 --> 00:24:55,024
Excuse me!

300
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,629
He's mine!

301
00:24:57,526 --> 00:24:59,713
I do Mr. Houdini.

302
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:01,067
Who do you think you are?

303
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:03,568
Who do I think I am?

304
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,797
I'm the one who does all
the bloody work around here!

305
00:25:39,613 --> 00:25:41,488
You little thief!

306
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:46,696
- I was just looking!
- Yeah, sure you were!

307
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,676
That's our audience you're
kickin' in the pants there,

308
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,030
Mr. Sugarman...

309
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:53,051
I'm sure she's OK.
You can let her go.

310
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,072
What's your name, kid?

311
00:25:58,365 --> 00:25:59,719
Lost your voice, huh?

312
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:02,948
When did you last hear it?

313
00:26:02,948 --> 00:26:04,406
Oh, wait, I know...

314
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:06,594
Help! Help!
I'm in here!

315
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:08,678
I'm in here!
I'm in here!

316
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:10,032
C'mon! Open up!

317
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:13,887
Open up! Open up!
Open up!

318
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:15,657
How's that for size?

319
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,637
Want a sandwich?

320
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:19,199
Yes please, Mr. Houdini!

321
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:20,762
The voice fits!

322
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:22,013
A little gummed up still,
but it works.

323
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,575
What else can you say?

324
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:25,450
Name's Benji, Mr. Houdini.

325
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,116
'Benji Mr. Houdini'.

326
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:28,992
Well, I'd drop the second part;
it's already spoken for.

327
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:31,180
Just plain Benji
sounds good to me.

328
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,201
'Just Plain Benji'
isn't much of a name either.

329
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:37,430
Well, we have a comedienne here,
Mr. Sugarman.

330
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,201
Maybe she can do the warm-up.

331
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:41,597
I'm not a comedienne,
Mr. Houdini.

332
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,785
No?
So what do you do for a living?

333
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,598
Rob banks? Train fleas?
Dance the Highland Fling?

334
00:26:46,702 --> 00:26:48,785
And steal from
dressing rooms?

335
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,598
I'm a psychic...

336
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:55,453
Well, more a sort of disciple...

337
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:57,744
Oh, a psychic's sidekick, huh?

338
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,703
'The Tantalising Princess Kali
and her Dusky Disciple'

339
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:03,578
That's you, huh?

340
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,662
We were top of the bill
at McTavish's Palace!

341
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,163
Top of the bill
at The Palace, eh?

342
00:27:08,267 --> 00:27:10,767
Well, I think I have a little
something for you too.

343
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,412
Tonight's performance.
Don't be late!

344
00:27:19,414 --> 00:27:21,184
Thanks, Mr. Houdini!

345
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:27,123
My mam doesny do tricks, like.

346
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:29,414
It's real, Mr. Houdini.

347
00:27:30,144 --> 00:27:31,498
It's no jiggery-pokery.

348
00:27:31,498 --> 00:27:34,206
Solid gold. I'm sure
she's great, kid. Goodbye.

349
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:36,603
- She's got 'The Gift'.
- 'Bye, 'bye, now.

350
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,375
Fellow travellers.

351
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,250
Dear friends.

352
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:53,063
Modern Science tells us
that Life...

353
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,604
...had its beginnings in the gloomy
depths of the great oceans.

354
00:27:57,126 --> 00:28:00,251
Our own little lives are
but a brief gasp...

355
00:28:00,668 --> 00:28:04,105
...before we plunge back down into
that dreamy darkness

356
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:06,084
from which there is no return...

357
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:08,480
Or is there?

358
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:12,543
I, Harry Houdini, shall discover
the Truth for all of us!

359
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:16,293
Naked we emerged from
that sea of the unconscious...

360
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,106
...and that is how I now
propose to travel.

361
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:27,752
Lights, please!

362
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,316
Ladies and gentlemen...

363
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:43,691
I entreat you; do not attempt to hold
your breath in emulation of me...

364
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,193
May God guide me...

365
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:53,693
...and have mercy
on my immortal soul.

366
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,116
Mama...

367
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:06,199
Mama!

368
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,116
Harry!

369
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,056
Get him out!!

370
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:41,411
Bravo! Bravo!

371
00:30:51,204 --> 00:30:52,662
Nearly two minutes over!

372
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:54,225
Then that's two minutes you
didn't know about, Morry.

373
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:55,370
You don't have to do this, Harry.

374
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:56,933
You don't have to push yourself
to the wire every time...

375
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:58,392
Yes I do!

376
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:24,644
I met Houdini!
I met Houdini!

377
00:31:25,374 --> 00:31:26,936
I met him, ma!

378
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:30,687
He's got these eyes thatjust burn
through to the back of your head!

379
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,666
He's incredible, ma!

380
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,166
You got caught!

381
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:45,896
What did I tell you?

382
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:49,647
Rule number one:
Never get caught!

383
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,960
So what did you find out?

384
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:02,772
Or were you too busy
making eyes at him?

385
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:08,086
Do you think
I like livin' like this?

386
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:11,627
Surrounded by grime and filth
and other people's hand-me-downs?!

387
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:13,398
I want new things.

388
00:32:13,816 --> 00:32:15,378
Nice things.

389
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:18,295
I want $10,000!

390
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,587
Did you find out anything, mam?

391
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,838
There wasn't a single personal
thing in his hotel suite.

392
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:34,025
Like he doesn't exist...

393
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:37,776
He has a fancy trunk
with his initials on...

394
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,901
The kind of trunk you
keep your secrets in.

395
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:45,693
A big trunk
that only takes a tiny wee key.

396
00:32:46,527 --> 00:32:50,173
Now where would Mr. Houdini
keep a key like that, eh?

397
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:54,132
And this...

398
00:32:57,362 --> 00:32:58,716
His mother.

399
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:03,508
It's a start.
I'll busk the rest.

400
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:07,049
Eat your tea now.

401
00:33:16,322 --> 00:33:17,363
Next!

402
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:21,009
Good afternoon, Mr. Houdini.

403
00:33:21,114 --> 00:33:24,135
I have, sir, a secret message.

404
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:26,114
It's from your mother.

405
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:28,406
It's in Hungarian,
isn't it, Jock?

406
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,864
You should have done
your homework, Hamish!

407
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:32,469
She didn't speak Hungarian -
she spoke German.

408
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:34,239
Next!

409
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,950
You're a hoofer.

410
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:53,928
Aye, sir! A hoofer, I am!

411
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,950
We're interviewing psychics.

412
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:59,241
Think of a number...

413
00:33:59,242 --> 00:34:01,221
Message from your mama...

414
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:03,826
Very cold, very cold.

415
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:05,701
Message Little Harry,

416
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:08,617
growing old, growing old.

417
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:14,868
Arky, parky, tory roop.
Rang tang, toozy Jock.

418
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:18,514
Eerie, orie! Eerie, orie!
You are oot!

419
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,431
Macbeth. Act 1. Scene 1.
Right?

420
00:34:21,432 --> 00:34:23,411
Alright, thank you very much
young ladies.

421
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:24,660
We'll let your mother know.

422
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,431
Out you go. Thank you now.
Very good.

423
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:28,202
She'll never forgive you,
Harry.

424
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:30,078
- Out you go.
- What did you say?

425
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:31,641
Forgive me for what?

426
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:33,828
I never hurt her
in my goddamn life!

427
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:35,286
What the hell's she
talking about, Sugarman?

428
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:36,954
10,000 American dollars.

429
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:39,141
That's what she was
talking about, Harry.

430
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,912
If God ever permitted an angel
to walk this earth,

431
00:34:41,017 --> 00:34:42,267
it was my mother!

432
00:34:42,996 --> 00:34:44,558
Ah, the Psychic's sidekick...

433
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:48,100
Do I have permission to kick our
audience in the pants this time?

434
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:49,767
Come on, kid. Clear off!

435
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:52,163
Mr. Houdini's had enough for
one day. Come on...

436
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:54,976
It's no' me. I told you.

437
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:56,956
It's my mam.

438
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:02,060
I'm sorry for the intrusion,
Mr. Houdini.

439
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,665
Mr. Sugarman, is it?

440
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:10,081
We have a psychic act
me and my daughter here.

441
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,790
Not such a wonderful act, really.

442
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,499
I wear a somewhat of
a revealing costume.

443
00:35:16,228 --> 00:35:20,290
I pretend to see those
on the other side.

444
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:23,103
Sometimes I really do.

445
00:35:23,937 --> 00:35:25,812
My mother would have called it
a travesty

446
00:35:25,813 --> 00:35:27,271
a waste of a God-given gift.

447
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:30,187
She used hers for healing,
didn't she, Benji?

448
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:32,896
Maybe I should have made
more of mine. But...

449
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:36,229
there's no man at home and
there's bread to put on the table.

450
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,460
I'm sorry, Mr. Houdini.
I'm so deeply sorry for your loss...

451
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,418
Last night I dreamed a dream.

452
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,628
I saw someone I've never met,
in a place I've never been.

453
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:57,378
A lady in a garden.

454
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:02,378
Her hair was silver
and she was small...

455
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:04,149
wearing a black dress...

456
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:07,274
and she was waving as if...

457
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,983
beckoning someone to her.

458
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:12,170
Does that mean something to you,
Mr. Houdini?

459
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:15,296
It means you read
the New York Times, Mrs...

460
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,858
McGarvie.

461
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:19,462
It was The Herald Tribune,
actually.

462
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:21,233
That picture was
syndicated all over.

463
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:22,796
Sometimes it works.

464
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,922
Sometimes you have to help
it along. Is that a sin?

465
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,902
I read a page unwritten...

466
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:38,006
I hear words...

467
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:40,298
yet unspoken...

468
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:46,132
But they all seem like shapes...

469
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:49,361
and colours to me now...

470
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:55,195
I'm sorry.

471
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,341
Did you say something?

472
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:58,425
No, no. I...

473
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,071
It's you...

474
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:05,717
I think you're the one
we've been waiting for.

475
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:08,738
<i>It was if the Earth</i>
<i>stopped turnin'.</i>

476
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:11,759
<i>That's what they say in</i>
<i>the great romances, isn't it?</i>

477
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,093
<i>But we didn't know</i>
<i>the half of it.</i>

478
00:37:34,887 --> 00:37:36,970
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, Harry?

479
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:39,262
Oh, come on,
it's got to be a sign.

480
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:40,928
You were there.
You saw her.

481
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,471
Now change that to
'scrupulous scientific conditions'.

482
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,179
'Scrupulous'.

483
00:37:53,118 --> 00:37:54,784
There are more things
in Heaven and Earth

484
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:57,910
than in all your audit books,
Mr. Shakespeare.

485
00:37:58,952 --> 00:38:01,035
More than $10,000?

486
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,306
Mr. Harry Houdini...

487
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:09,160
...announces the most extraordinary
Experiment ever staged

488
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,931
by modern science

489
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:14,057
that will prove beyond
all reasonable doubt...

490
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:16,869
the existence of an Afterlife.

491
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,370
Sealed inside this envelope,

492
00:38:24,787 --> 00:38:28,641
Mr. Houdini has written
the last words spoken to him

493
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:30,934
by his dear, departed mother

494
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:35,100
known only to him,
and shared with no one...

495
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:44,580
This safe will be lodged
at the Royal Bank of Scotland...

496
00:38:44,477 --> 00:38:47,185
until the day of
the Psychic Experiment,

497
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:52,081
which will be conducted under
scrupulous scientific conditions

498
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:54,685
in front of the world's press.

499
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:58,540
Mr. Houdini intends to contact
the departed soul of

500
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,520
his beloved mother...

501
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:10,416
We've died and gone to heaven!

502
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,980
Look at the Castle, mam!

503
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:25,834
And I can see right up Princes Street
all the way to the Scott Monument!

504
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:30,210
Oh! It smells like heather!

505
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,772
And it's all free!

506
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:33,960
Nothin' in this world's free.

507
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:37,294
Come Sunday, if we don't deliver
the 'secret words' our

508
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,940
Mr. Houdini wants to hear,
all this goes; itjust vanishes.

509
00:39:41,565 --> 00:39:43,544
But he's taken
a real shine to us!

510
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:44,899
The plan's workin'.

511
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,086
That's as maybe.

512
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:49,794
Something's going on.

513
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:52,191
It was too easy.

514
00:39:52,816 --> 00:39:54,274
I didn't do a thing.

515
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:57,192
Benji!

516
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,213
Oh. Come in...

517
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,171
Madam. From Mr. Houdini...

518
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:14,381
Why, thank you very much.

519
00:40:14,485 --> 00:40:15,630
Madam.

520
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:18,652
What's it say?

521
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,444
He's inviting me
to take luncheon.

522
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:25,528
Mam! This is it!

523
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:28,027
This is what we want!

524
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,028
But what does Mr. Houdini want?

525
00:40:36,675 --> 00:40:38,341
Would you stop skippin'
for a minute?

526
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:52,197
Excuse me,
we've got kids here!

527
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:55,217
Women and children! You got Male
and Female in the same cage here!

528
00:40:55,218 --> 00:40:56,676
There ought to be
a law against it!

529
00:40:56,676 --> 00:40:58,030
It's Nature, Mr. Sugarman!

530
00:40:58,135 --> 00:41:00,739
Well maybe Nature should
learn a bit of decency.

531
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:02,093
Monkeys are just like
you and me.

532
00:41:02,198 --> 00:41:03,760
You speak for yourself.

533
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,531
You're no different.

534
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:08,032
The Great Houdini says
'jump' - you jump.

535
00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:10,323
You're just a dancing monkey!

536
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,178
Let's go and look
at the Aquarium.

537
00:41:14,282 --> 00:41:18,761
They've got sharks and underwater
tortoises and all sorts!

538
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,740
Wanna know something, sweetheart?

539
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,449
What's that, Mr. Sugarman?

540
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:28,971
You ain't gonna take my
Mr. Houdini for that ten grand.

541
00:41:40,535 --> 00:41:42,722
<i>Mam and I were</i>
<i>keepin'him guessin'.</i>

542
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:46,784
<i>Luckily men are fools for a bit</i>
<i>'o glitter in a borrowed frock.</i>

543
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:48,973
Madam...

544
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,472
Mrs. McGarvie...

545
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,536
Forgive the intimacy of
our little restaurant.

546
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:56,994
News-hounds are everywhere.

547
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,328
I've never stayed
in a place like this before.

548
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:02,515
Something to tell
the grandchildren.

549
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:04,703
You got the flowers OK?

550
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:06,369
Oh, enough for a wedding.

551
00:42:06,995 --> 00:42:08,453
Won't you sit down, please?

552
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:10,328
Men don't spend money on flowers

553
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,516
just because they enjoy
the smell of them...

554
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:14,808
Oh, I just meant to be friendly.

555
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:16,579
Are you sure you
won't sit down?

556
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,287
Is this part of the audition?

557
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,788
Sit down, please.

558
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:38,351
Pick anything you like.

559
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:50,853
It's all in foreign.

560
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:51,687
Do what I do.

561
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:53,666
Pick a high number.
You can't go wrong.

562
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:00,854
That.
I'll have that one, please.

563
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:03,041
That's... bread, madam.

564
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:04,083
I'll have the same.

565
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:05,958
Bread all round.
Plain and simple.

566
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,729
Of course, sir.

567
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:09,709
Bread.
Plain and simple.

568
00:43:09,709 --> 00:43:12,625
Champagne for the lady -
best in the house.

569
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:16,480
Mrs. McGarvie.

570
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:18,355
This isn't me - all of this...

571
00:43:18,356 --> 00:43:20,126
I was raised
in Appleton, Wisconsin.

572
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:23,772
I sold papers, shined shoes,
and did conjuring tricks...

573
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:25,647
Just a regular Joe?

574
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:27,211
Well, you've done
your research, right?

575
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:29,919
You know everything there is
to know about me already.

576
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:32,732
Not everything.

577
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:36,691
A little old fashioned, maybe.
But I like 'em...

578
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:38,878
If you'll allow me...

579
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:50,754
I'm not a wee girl, Mr. Houdini.

580
00:43:52,526 --> 00:43:54,609
Harry, please.

581
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,193
What is it you want...
Mr. Houdini?

582
00:43:59,714 --> 00:44:02,943
I want to treat you as
the lady you so clearly are.

583
00:44:05,548 --> 00:44:07,110
That's all?

584
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:09,611
You're special, Mrs. McGarvie.

585
00:44:10,236 --> 00:44:11,590
You have a gift.

586
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,340
<i>The truth was,</i>
<i>she couldn't read him.</i>

587
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,319
<i>And she let him</i>
<i>get under her skin.</i>

588
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:20,861
We went on the Big Wheel and
Mr. Sugarman was sick!

589
00:44:22,841 --> 00:44:24,403
Back where I come from,
Mr. Sugarman,

590
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:26,695
we always acknowledge a lady.

591
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,029
Mrs. McGarvie!
I do apologise.

592
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:33,258
I hardly recognised you.

593
00:44:36,176 --> 00:44:37,426
I don't have the time

594
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,030
or the inclination to figure out
what it is you really want.

595
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:42,425
So I'll just leave you

596
00:44:42,531 --> 00:44:44,197
and your Mr. Sugarman
to your silly games...

597
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:46,072
- Mrs. McGarvie. Please...
- Benji!

598
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:47,947
Mrs. McGarvie!

599
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,510
Harry! Come here, Harry...

600
00:44:49,614 --> 00:44:52,739
If you run after her now
and make a scene...

601
00:44:52,844 --> 00:44:54,302
it'll be all over
the papers by morning.

602
00:44:54,407 --> 00:44:56,698
Then, where is your
great experiment? Hmm?

603
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:34,826
Harry!

604
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,056
Rise and shine!

605
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:39,931
Harry!

606
00:45:40,348 --> 00:45:42,327
- What time is it?
- It's late.

607
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:43,369
Well what did you
let me sleep through for?

608
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,349
Get yourself a louder bell, too!

609
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:51,078
Gentlemen of the press,
1.00 o'clock.

610
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:54,412
Worshipful Company of
Locksmiths, 2.30,

611
00:45:54,516 --> 00:45:57,745
and St. Andrew's Orphanage,
4.00 o'clock.

612
00:45:59,621 --> 00:46:01,808
Buy a bunch of shoes
for the kids...

613
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:04,517
Shoes? Fine...

614
00:46:13,164 --> 00:46:15,455
It's all right, mam.
He's gonna be ages...

615
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,476
Sorry, mam,
I couldn't help it!

616
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:25,873
Come on, kid!
Harry, do you want me to?

617
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:31,603
You want to look inside
Pandora's box, huh?

618
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:35,040
Take a peek
at the real Houdini.

619
00:46:37,437 --> 00:46:41,499
All yours.
No psychic gifts required.

620
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,000
No?

621
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,229
You disappoint me.

622
00:46:48,584 --> 00:46:51,084
Here's me thinking you
was the genuine article.

623
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:54,000
Solid gold - through and through.

624
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:56,292
I was embarrassed to ask.

625
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,688
I just needed something...

626
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:00,668
a personal item,

627
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:02,647
a wee token...
...a handkerchief.

628
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:04,314
That's all.

629
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:07,022
You see, it helps me
channel the energy...

630
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:08,689
my psychic energy...

631
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,252
Your 'psychic energy'?

632
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:15,148
I've seen mediums, crystal-gazers,
palmists, spirit-guides,

633
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:17,649
theatres fit to bust with
psychic energy, Mrs. McGarvie!

634
00:47:17,649 --> 00:47:19,107
And you know somethin'?

635
00:47:19,107 --> 00:47:22,648
Until somebody proves me wrong,
it's all moonshine!

636
00:47:22,649 --> 00:47:25,670
Con-artists and cheap chislers
out to fleece poor folks

637
00:47:25,566 --> 00:47:27,545
looking for
a little peace of mind!

638
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,775
So that's what this
whole charade's about?

639
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:34,525
Proving
'the Great Houdini' wrong?

640
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,838
I wasn't referring to you
personally, Mrs. McGarvie.

641
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,609
Here.
For your psychic energy...

642
00:47:46,714 --> 00:47:47,964
Thank you.

643
00:47:50,569 --> 00:47:53,590
10,000 dollars doesn't mean
much to you, does it?

644
00:47:53,694 --> 00:47:54,527
It's just a game.

645
00:47:54,631 --> 00:47:55,985
Don't mean that much to me?

646
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:59,631
When I was a kid, we used to sleep
7 in a bed half this size!

647
00:47:59,528 --> 00:48:02,236
Harry Houdini knows what
it means to be cold and hungry and

648
00:48:02,236 --> 00:48:03,694
without a dime.

649
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,445
The difference is, you left all
that behind, didn't you?

650
00:48:12,029 --> 00:48:14,216
This is the latest in 'slumber science,'
I'll have you know.

651
00:48:14,217 --> 00:48:16,404
Internally sprung.
Just like me.

652
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:22,759
You never sleep that
peaceful again, do you?

653
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,571
I don't think I slept right
since I was nine years old.

654
00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:27,550
Not at all?

655
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,155
Not a wink. Not since
I got a bed to myself.

656
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:32,447
You'll have to start
inviting people in.

657
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:35,885
I just can't hardly
remember the old days-

658
00:48:37,865 --> 00:48:39,948
the real days.

659
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:41,927
Like it was
somebody else's dream...

660
00:48:45,157 --> 00:48:48,178
Would you like to see
something real, Mr. Houdini?

661
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:14,222
- How'm I doin'?
- Oh, you could pass for a native.

662
00:49:14,222 --> 00:49:15,263
When in Rome...

663
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,451
That's what my ma
always used to say.

664
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:20,577
I wish you could've met her.
You would've got on like a house on fire.

665
00:49:20,577 --> 00:49:22,868
Don't go giving away
too much about her

666
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:24,431
they'll say we cheated.

667
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:26,201
Cheated? No.

668
00:49:26,307 --> 00:49:28,703
I'm not like those fakers, Mary
- those cheap chiselers.

669
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:29,744
I'm like you.

670
00:49:29,744 --> 00:49:31,931
Just trying
to earn an honest dollar.

671
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:36,620
Heads or tails?

672
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:40,057
Um... You choose.

673
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:41,933
Then I choose neither.

674
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:44,641
My penny for your dollar?

675
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,141
Heads or tails?

676
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:48,704
You choose!

677
00:49:55,163 --> 00:49:56,725
Magic!

678
00:49:57,455 --> 00:49:58,913
Magic.

679
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,996
Don't you love it?

680
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:03,705
I used to practice card tricks
and table magic 8 hours a day.

681
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:04,330
Really?

682
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:06,309
I studied locks and handcuffs
for 5 years solid.

683
00:50:06,414 --> 00:50:07,872
I got to know 'em all
back to front.

684
00:50:08,081 --> 00:50:10,372
I used run 10 miles a day,
push weights for 2 hours...

685
00:50:10,477 --> 00:50:12,456
Couldn't have had much time
for anything else...

686
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:14,123
I made time.

687
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,456
You know, when I was a kid,
I was Ehrich, The Prince of the Air.

688
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:19,540
I told mama I'd be a flyer -
done that!

689
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:21,415
Told her I'd be a movie star -
done that too!

690
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,707
Swore I'd be the greatest
escape man in the world.

691
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,145
Made all my wishes come true -
grabbed my own piece of immortality!

692
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,750
Mr Houdini, sir,
can I get your autograph?

693
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:31,208
Of course you can.

694
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:38,604
Thank you!

695
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:40,688
- Right.
- Thank you!

696
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:46,730
You're OK. You got your own piece
of immortality right there.

697
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:48,501
- Who? Benji?
- Yeah.

698
00:50:49,543 --> 00:50:51,626
You don't have children,
I can tell.

699
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:53,189
Make you old before your time.

700
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:56,731
Oh, that ain't so.
You're the living proof.

701
00:50:57,044 --> 00:51:00,690
'The Tantalising Princess Kali
and Her Dusky Disciple'.

702
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,356
Sounds like a fun act.

703
00:51:02,357 --> 00:51:04,023
'Hard graft'.

704
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:07,565
If I fail, we starve.

705
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,753
Well, I fail and I die.

706
00:51:19,025 --> 00:51:23,296
I don't think you want to get involved
with someone like me, Mr. Houdini.

707
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,859
Well, maybe I do...

708
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:55,487
Race you!

709
00:52:03,092 --> 00:52:04,862
Wait for me!

710
00:52:10,697 --> 00:52:12,051
It's locked!

711
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:13,925
Are you sure about that?

712
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,718
After you.

713
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,595
Benji!
Stay away from the edge!

714
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,866
Look at that!

715
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,616
It's beautiful.

716
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,700
Ladies and Gentlemen!

717
00:52:56,847 --> 00:53:00,284
I am to be suspended from
the roof of the very heavens -

718
00:53:00,285 --> 00:53:02,889
with neither net nor harness!

719
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:07,784
Only a five-strand rope will prevent me
from plummeting earthwards,

720
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:10,493
dashing my brains to
a thousand pieces!

721
00:53:11,327 --> 00:53:14,764
May God have mercy
on my immortal soul!

722
00:53:15,807 --> 00:53:17,161
No!!

723
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:29,557
Oh, no, I can't!

724
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:31,016
Oh, come on.

725
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:33,100
A foot in both worlds...

726
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:38,934
Oh, I can't look!

727
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:02,060
Mary...

728
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,644
I guess
I want to make it last...

729
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:10,290
No!!

730
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:12,791
Mam!

731
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,645
How did you do that?

732
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:24,250
Magic.

733
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:32,584
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Ladies and Gentlemen!

734
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:34,980
I beg your indulgence!

735
00:54:35,085 --> 00:54:39,564
The Maestro Houdini has been
taken ill with the condition

736
00:54:39,565 --> 00:54:42,481
of severe nervous exhaustion!

737
00:54:42,794 --> 00:54:43,939
There will be...

738
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:48,731
there will be a refund available
from noon tomorrow!

739
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:52,169
Mr. Houdini sends his regrets...

740
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:20,609
<i>To look into deep water and</i>
<i>see things on the other side</i>

741
00:55:20,506 --> 00:55:23,735
<i>Mr. Houdini would've given</i>
<i>anything to do that.</i>

742
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,443
<i>It's a gift some are given</i>

743
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:29,048
<i>whether you want to or not.</i>

744
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,236
Mam!!

745
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:48,112
Help me!!

746
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:51,341
Mam!!

747
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:14,990
Not asleep?

748
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:20,407
What happened with him?

749
00:56:20,407 --> 00:56:22,698
Nothing happened 'with him'.

750
00:56:23,324 --> 00:56:25,407
Harry's a gentleman.

751
00:56:27,074 --> 00:56:29,365
So you didn't get the key, then?

752
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,429
I'm not sure I care so much
about the key anymore...

753
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:37,179
We're in it for the money,
remember

754
00:56:37,284 --> 00:56:40,721
not for a roll in the hay like
you did with my Dad.

755
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,763
<i>That was when I saw it for real</i>

756
00:56:47,076 --> 00:56:48,846
<i>Mam was in love.</i>

757
00:56:49,264 --> 00:56:51,347
<i>And the trouble</i>
<i>with love is this</i>

758
00:56:51,973 --> 00:56:54,369
<i>Some people get left out.</i>

759
00:56:54,785 --> 00:56:56,764
'Harry Houdini Disappears! '

760
00:56:56,973 --> 00:56:59,056
'Harry Houdini Misses Show! '

761
00:56:59,369 --> 00:57:01,348
'Harry Houdini Messes Up! '

762
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:03,327
This whole psychic thing
is taking over.

763
00:57:03,328 --> 00:57:05,307
Do you hear me?
It's taking over!!

764
00:57:07,912 --> 00:57:09,370
These are from your wife!

765
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,140
Do you remember you had a wife?

766
00:57:11,558 --> 00:57:13,120
She's wiring you twice a day

767
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:16,350
and you're going ga-ga over some schiksa
with a cute line in chat!

768
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,016
Mrs. McGarvie's a lady...

769
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,996
...and I won't
have you forget that!

770
00:57:21,142 --> 00:57:23,642
We've got to get
our priorities in order!

771
00:57:27,184 --> 00:57:28,642
All right, Harry.

772
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:30,517
I quit!

773
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:34,372
You want to play poker
with me, Morry?

774
00:57:37,498 --> 00:57:39,685
First, I'm 'pushing it
to the wire'

775
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:43,644
and now the 'psychic'
thing's taking over.

776
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:48,748
About time you got your
priorities sorted, don't you think?

777
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:53,749
C'mon, buckle me up.

778
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,189
Put your shoulders back.

779
00:58:32,503 --> 00:58:35,524
You're walkin' like an old man,
ya mustache Pete!

780
00:58:45,837 --> 00:58:49,899
<i>It was up to me and Mr. Sugarman to</i>
<i>keep things on the right path.</i>

781
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:55,004
<i>The Great Houdini had</i>
<i>fallen for mam, all right.</i>

782
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:58,650
<i>But it was as</i>
<i>if he didn't want to admit it</i>

783
00:58:58,651 --> 00:59:00,213
<i>or couldn't.</i>

784
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:19,382
<i>Maybe the secret that Mr. Houdini</i>
<i>had locked away in his heart...</i>

785
00:59:19,278 --> 00:59:21,986
<i>was going to be a way out</i>
<i>for all of us.</i>

786
00:59:46,051 --> 00:59:50,322
Mr. Houdini gets some funny ideas
in his head sometimes, you know.

787
00:59:50,218 --> 00:59:52,509
Seven year itch, Mr. Sugarman.

788
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:54,593
All marriages go
through a rocky patch.

789
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:57,719
Mr. Houdini has a most
exceptional marriage.

790
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,114
Mr. And Mrs. Houdini
are soul mates

791
01:00:00,219 --> 01:00:01,677
they're like brother and sister.

792
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:03,552
There's the problem, then.

793
01:00:03,657 --> 01:00:05,532
That sort of talk
give you a thrill, does it?

794
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:06,990
What do you want, Mr. Sugarman?

795
01:00:07,095 --> 01:00:08,865
What do I want?

796
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:13,657
Do you know what this is?

797
01:00:14,804 --> 01:00:19,804
This is five hundred
Scottish pound notes.

798
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:22,095
I want you to take them...

799
01:00:22,721 --> 01:00:24,491
...and I want you to disappear.

800
01:00:28,972 --> 01:00:30,742
I'm not sure I want to disappear.

801
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:32,617
Yeah, you do.

802
01:00:33,139 --> 01:00:35,743
What schtick 'you gonna pull to earn
that ten thousand dollars, eh?

803
01:00:35,743 --> 01:00:38,347
It's not gonna happen.
It's specific

804
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:39,910
specific words he wants to hear.

805
01:00:40,014 --> 01:00:41,889
Take the money.

806
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,285
It's not on offer forever.

807
01:00:44,702 --> 01:00:48,973
If I fail Mr. Houdini's challenge,
you'll never see me again anyway.

808
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:50,535
So why are you so worried?

809
01:00:52,724 --> 01:00:54,182
He's right.

810
01:00:55,016 --> 01:00:56,682
You are special.

811
01:00:56,683 --> 01:00:58,349
Thank you very much.

812
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:01,682
You don't know how special.

813
01:01:02,204 --> 01:01:04,808
You have no idea.

814
01:01:07,621 --> 01:01:09,496
But you're going to find out.

815
01:01:10,121 --> 01:01:12,829
You don't scare me, Mr. Sugarman.

816
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,579
We're going dancing.

817
01:01:16,893 --> 01:01:19,705
Dancing? Oh!

818
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:24,497
Oh, yes. It's a dance he's
taking you on all right.

819
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:29,289
You're way out of your depth
on this one, Mrs. McGarvie

820
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,789
believe me.

821
01:01:57,626 --> 01:01:59,188
We're all incognito.

822
01:02:00,022 --> 01:02:01,167
Polka! Polka!

823
01:02:01,168 --> 01:02:02,938
C'mon, dance!
We've all got to dance!

824
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:05,022
Shake a leg, Mr. Sugarman!

825
01:02:08,564 --> 01:02:10,960
Come on, ya old mustache Pete!

826
01:02:12,627 --> 01:02:13,877
What do you think?

827
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:16,064
Do people choose the night
to do strange things,

828
01:02:16,169 --> 01:02:17,939
or is it the dark
that makes 'em act funny?

829
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:21,169
- It's the night, Harry.
- Of course.

830
01:02:21,169 --> 01:02:23,148
You do things you
wouldn't normally do

831
01:02:23,253 --> 01:02:24,919
ask all kinds of questions.

832
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,524
Like the ones
you never asked last night?

833
01:02:28,983 --> 01:02:30,128
Foxtrot!

834
01:02:32,837 --> 01:02:34,191
I've had enough!

835
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,670
Like men friends?

836
01:02:38,775 --> 01:02:40,233
Fathers

837
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:43,462
Mr. McGarvies. You never asked.

838
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,546
Maybe I didn't want to
know the answers.

839
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,546
Waste of time, all three of them.

840
01:02:54,923 --> 01:02:57,319
Haven't seen him this crazy...

841
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,339
since his mother died.

842
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:03,256
That's not 'crazy', Mr. Sugarman.

843
01:03:03,778 --> 01:03:05,548
That's 'love'.

844
01:03:10,237 --> 01:03:11,799
You're a good dancer.

845
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,195
I've never danced
like this before.

846
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:16,382
I thought you'd have a girl
in every port.

847
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,050
No.

848
01:03:18,154 --> 01:03:19,716
Tango!

849
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:42,947
You'll be leaving, won't you?

850
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:44,302
Montreal.

851
01:03:44,406 --> 01:03:45,551
Final date.

852
01:03:45,761 --> 01:03:47,219
Then we all go home.

853
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,781
Chicken soup for supper.

854
01:03:48,886 --> 01:03:51,386
Is it Mrs. Houdini
who makes this soup?

855
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:54,719
Cook makes the soup.

856
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:58,573
Mrs. Houdini serves it up.
You'd like her.

857
01:03:58,887 --> 01:04:00,762
I can't see us
washing dishes together.

858
01:04:00,762 --> 01:04:02,637
Maid does the dishes.

859
01:04:02,741 --> 01:04:04,720
Things change, Mary.

860
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:07,846
I'm the Great Houdini!
I make things the way I want 'em to be.

861
01:04:07,742 --> 01:04:08,887
You can't.

862
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:11,700
- Oh, I can. Believe me.
- Stop it!

863
01:04:12,117 --> 01:04:14,929
This is real.
I'm real...

864
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:17,013
- What's happening to me?
- You're dancing, Mary.

865
01:04:17,013 --> 01:04:19,513
Well, I don't want to
dance anymore!

866
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:30,868
Hey...
Don't worry, kid.

867
01:04:30,973 --> 01:04:32,743
There's no future in it.

868
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:37,744
I've got something
that might interest you...

869
01:04:53,684 --> 01:04:55,038
Mam!

870
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:02,017
Mr. Sugarman doesny like you

871
01:05:02,018 --> 01:05:04,101
says you're just a gold-digger.

872
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:06,705
You don't listen to any word
that Mr. Sugarman says.

873
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:07,956
Got it?

874
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:10,038
But, mam...

875
01:05:10,248 --> 01:05:12,644
- Mam?
- What?

876
01:05:13,164 --> 01:05:15,664
Mr. Sugarman's on our side.

877
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:27,332
Go on, mam...

878
01:05:44,001 --> 01:05:45,771
A dress...

879
01:05:59,419 --> 01:06:00,981
It's his mother...

880
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,169
She looks like you...

881
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:06,606
You're the absolute image of her,

882
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:08,273
when she was young.

883
01:06:08,274 --> 01:06:10,461
Took my breath away.

884
01:06:10,461 --> 01:06:17,440
Our Mr. Houdini was closer to his mother
than most sons even dream of.

885
01:06:20,358 --> 01:06:23,274
Maybe all this does
something for you? Hm?

886
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,504
Like I said, Mrs. McGarvie

887
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:29,212
way out of your depth.

888
01:06:39,422 --> 01:06:41,609
I thought you people were smart.

889
01:06:41,714 --> 01:06:43,172
We are.

890
01:06:43,381 --> 01:06:45,256
We're here for the star prize.

891
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,235
But you need the words.

892
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,110
You need his mother's dying words...

893
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,402
- It doesn't matter, mam...
- No, no...

894
01:06:52,236 --> 01:06:54,736
I'd put on his mam's pinny
if I had to

895
01:06:54,736 --> 01:06:57,965
I'd dress him, feed him,
clean him - whatever it takes.

896
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:00,674
You want me gone?

897
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:04,112
Well, you better start helping me,
Mr. Sugarman.

898
01:07:04,425 --> 01:07:06,925
If anyone knows the words

899
01:07:06,925 --> 01:07:08,070
you do.

900
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:10,050
Win the 10 grand
and you disappear. Right?

901
01:07:10,154 --> 01:07:12,133
That was always the deal.

902
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,925
I used to be a nice man, you know.

903
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:19,426
Can you believe it?

904
01:07:20,676 --> 01:07:23,905
I just got old and mean.

905
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:33,281
There aren't any words...

906
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:35,469
At least, if there were...

907
01:07:35,469 --> 01:07:37,656
Harry Houdini never heard them.

908
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:39,323
He was doing a show...

909
01:07:39,428 --> 01:07:41,511
Oh, he talks like he was there

910
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:43,490
He gives you every detail,
makes himself weep.

911
01:07:43,491 --> 01:07:45,574
I've heard it a million times.

912
01:07:45,678 --> 01:07:48,282
His big regret.
His deepest guilt.

913
01:07:48,387 --> 01:07:51,303
The moment
his mother needed him most...

914
01:07:53,596 --> 01:07:55,366
...he wasn't there.

915
01:08:02,034 --> 01:08:03,700
<i>At last...</i>

916
01:08:03,701 --> 01:08:06,826
<i>... our Mr. Houdini's secrets</i>
<i>were out in the open.</i>

917
01:08:10,264 --> 01:08:14,535
<i>The question was;</i>
<i>what would mam do with his future?</i>

918
01:08:14,848 --> 01:08:17,660
<i>Give him a glimpse of</i>
<i>the afterlife?</i>

919
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:20,577
<i>Or a bitter-sweet taste</i>
<i>of the here and now?</i>

920
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:24,015
<i>Love or money?</i>

921
01:08:25,786 --> 01:08:28,494
The safe is untouched.
You have my word on it.

922
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,891
'Aye, chief constable.
Agreed.

923
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:37,557
Mr. Houdini asks that you wear
his mother's wedding dress, madam

924
01:08:37,871 --> 01:08:41,829
in order to channel the psychic energy,
you understand.

925
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:50,892
Look at it, child.

926
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,600
Just look at it.

927
01:08:56,414 --> 01:08:58,289
He doesn't want me.

928
01:08:59,748 --> 01:09:01,727
He just wants his mama.

929
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,810
- Mr. Houdini?
- Mr. Houdini!

930
01:09:08,915 --> 01:09:10,269
Mr. Houdini!

931
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,624
What do you hope to prove
by this experiment?

932
01:09:11,728 --> 01:09:13,394
Well, well,
the 'psychic reporter'.

933
01:09:13,395 --> 01:09:14,749
We know the truth before it happens,

934
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:15,790
- isn't that right, Mr. Houdini?
- Not this time.

935
01:09:15,895 --> 01:09:17,353
This experiment
is nothing less than

936
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,854
a battle between Love
and Death, gentlemen.

937
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:21,937
Is Death final
or will Love triumph?

938
01:09:21,937 --> 01:09:23,187
Place your bets please!

939
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,104
What odds would you put on that,
Mr. Houdini?

940
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:31,105
Well, there's a headline, boys...
Houdini says: 'ls Death Final? '

941
01:09:33,605 --> 01:09:35,480
Ladies and gentlemen...

942
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,667
...fellow Investigators.

943
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:41,313
The aim of the Scottish Institute
for Psychical Research...

944
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,022
is to evaluate the evidence
for the paranormal

945
01:09:44,023 --> 01:09:47,252
under the strictest
scientific conditions.

946
01:09:47,252 --> 01:09:49,648
I assure you,
ladies and gentlemen

947
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:52,252
no phantom escapes us!

948
01:09:52,774 --> 01:09:54,753
We want Houdini!

949
01:10:08,087 --> 01:10:10,899
As my dear mother lay dying

950
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:14,754
departing this Earth
for a better place

951
01:10:14,859 --> 01:10:17,567
she spoke her
last sweet words to me

952
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:20,171
her devoted son.

953
01:10:21,214 --> 01:10:23,818
Those words are
engraved upon my heart...

954
01:10:23,922 --> 01:10:26,526
My heart,
ladies and gentlemen...

955
01:10:26,839 --> 01:10:30,485
Those words are known only to me.

956
01:10:32,673 --> 01:10:35,069
If Mrs. McGarvie's
psychic gift is genuine,

957
01:10:35,173 --> 01:10:38,298
God willing, she shall receive those
last words from the Other Side

958
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:40,590
and transmit them to us today.

959
01:10:49,654 --> 01:10:51,945
<i>Mam looked beautiful...</i>

960
01:10:51,946 --> 01:10:53,612
<i>Like an angel...</i>

961
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:56,738
<i>Maybe Mr. Houdini saw her...</i>

962
01:10:57,154 --> 01:11:00,279
<i>or maybe he saw</i>
<i>his own sweet mother.</i>

963
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:03,821
<i>It didn't matter.</i>

964
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:09,655
<i>In that moment, she was everything</i>
<i>he'd been waiting for.</i>

965
01:11:16,323 --> 01:11:19,344
There is no trickery here,
ladies and gentlemen.

966
01:11:19,657 --> 01:11:21,948
There is only faith and hope.

967
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,385
Mrs. McGarvie.

968
01:11:25,595 --> 01:11:27,157
Are you ready?

969
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,471
Mama, can you hear me?

970
01:11:55,389 --> 01:11:57,159
Dear little mother.

971
01:12:02,369 --> 01:12:04,244
Mama, please try.

972
01:12:04,973 --> 01:12:06,639
Ehrich's here.

973
01:12:07,994 --> 01:12:09,764
Your good boy's here...

974
01:12:46,019 --> 01:12:47,685
I can't do this...

975
01:12:48,206 --> 01:12:49,039
I can't take your money.

976
01:12:49,144 --> 01:12:50,914
Mary, wait!

977
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:06,436
Ehrich! Ehrich!

978
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:08,520
Where are you?

979
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:10,604
Go to your mother!

980
01:13:10,604 --> 01:13:12,895
I need you!

981
01:13:14,355 --> 01:13:16,021
Come, Ehrich.

982
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:21,021
Your Mama's so alone -
so afraid.

983
01:13:23,626 --> 01:13:24,667
Ich bin hier, Mama.

984
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:27,272
Wo bist du?

985
01:13:28,106 --> 01:13:31,022
Why you not come to me?

986
01:13:31,544 --> 01:13:34,252
- Mama, I'm here.
- Where are you?

987
01:13:34,356 --> 01:13:36,543
Mein gutes Kind.

988
01:13:36,648 --> 01:13:39,356
- Mama, I tried to get to you.
- I can't see you!

989
01:13:39,461 --> 01:13:41,127
- I tried to get there.
- Mama can't see you!

990
01:13:41,232 --> 01:13:43,107
I had to finish the show.

991
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:45,607
Mama, I'm sorry!

992
01:13:46,753 --> 01:13:48,107
I'm sorry, mama.

993
01:13:48,212 --> 01:13:52,795
Es tut mir leid, Mama.
Es tut mir leid...

994
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:56,129
Mama, forgive me.
Mama...

995
01:13:58,004 --> 01:14:03,316
Forgive me...

996
01:14:18,631 --> 01:14:20,610
He's waitin' for you

997
01:14:20,715 --> 01:14:22,902
the Angel with fire-red hair.

998
01:14:22,903 --> 01:14:24,986
Got wings too.

999
01:14:25,299 --> 01:14:29,153
Clock says noon -
sun goes black.

1000
01:14:29,153 --> 01:14:30,715
Watch out!

1001
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,799
Here he comes!

1002
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:35,091
Benji!

1003
01:14:41,029 --> 01:14:43,633
The envelope!
The envelope!

1004
01:14:43,738 --> 01:14:44,883
The paper is blank!

1005
01:14:45,092 --> 01:14:47,383
There's naught on the paper!

1006
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:49,675
There are no words!

1007
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:51,759
Can you explain this please?

1008
01:14:52,176 --> 01:14:54,884
Mr. Houdini? Explain!
What does it mean?

1009
01:14:58,635 --> 01:15:00,614
To my eternal shame...

1010
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:03,947
I never got there.

1011
01:15:04,156 --> 01:15:06,656
I was too late!

1012
01:15:06,657 --> 01:15:08,323
I'm sorry...

1013
01:15:08,323 --> 01:15:09,677
Harry!

1014
01:15:09,678 --> 01:15:11,657
Are you all right, Harry?!

1015
01:15:29,054 --> 01:15:32,075
<i>It wasn't death that scared</i>
<i>Mr. Houdini.</i>

1016
01:15:32,388 --> 01:15:35,513
<i>He'd been diving into</i>
<i>deep water all his life.</i>

1017
01:15:36,138 --> 01:15:38,742
<i>What scared him was the truth.</i>

1018
01:15:40,722 --> 01:15:43,326
<i>It wasn't his body</i>
<i>that was in chains</i>

1019
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,035
<i>It was his heart.</i>

1020
01:16:40,519 --> 01:16:43,227
God have mercy
on my immortal soul...

1021
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:33,440
Thanks for the money.

1022
01:17:37,191 --> 01:17:39,066
Or have you come to
take it back?

1023
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:41,253
It's not really about
the money, is it?

1024
01:17:41,254 --> 01:17:43,024
Now look what you've done to me.

1025
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,108
I only made you fall in love...

1026
01:17:45,838 --> 01:17:48,129
- Don't flatter yourself.
- I'm sorry.

1027
01:17:48,234 --> 01:17:49,796
That's all fine, then.

1028
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:51,671
Your Mama forgives you.

1029
01:17:51,776 --> 01:17:53,338
- Now you can get out!
- Mary...

1030
01:17:53,443 --> 01:17:56,880
That was not love.
That was infatuation.

1031
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,276
Another dance.

1032
01:17:59,381 --> 01:18:01,777
What was it?
A Polka or a Foxtrot?

1033
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:06,152
Another fling.
Just another fling.

1034
01:18:07,194 --> 01:18:09,590
But it never quite
happened, did it?

1035
01:18:10,111 --> 01:18:13,132
- Why was that?
- I'd never been there before.

1036
01:18:13,132 --> 01:18:14,902
I didn't understand
what was happening...

1037
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:15,840
Don't touch me!

1038
01:18:15,945 --> 01:18:18,341
I didn't mean that.
That ain't what I want.

1039
01:18:18,341 --> 01:18:20,737
So what does
the Great Houdini want?

1040
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:22,820
'Coz you don't want me.

1041
01:18:23,445 --> 01:18:28,341
I'm not your little darlin'-wife,
and I'm certainly not your mama!

1042
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,800
Mary, I'm afraid...

1043
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,570
Afraid of what?

1044
01:18:31,675 --> 01:18:32,612
Of me?

1045
01:18:32,613 --> 01:18:34,071
I'm afraid of myself.

1046
01:18:34,071 --> 01:18:36,675
Of what I feel for you,
what I want...

1047
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:39,800
I love you, Mary...

1048
01:18:44,489 --> 01:18:46,885
But it's just shameful...

1049
01:18:47,614 --> 01:18:50,322
Shameful?
Who taught you that?

1050
01:18:54,282 --> 01:18:56,886
It's not shameful, Harry.

1051
01:18:57,824 --> 01:19:00,011
It's what men and women do!

1052
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:04,178
It keeps the winter at bay...

1053
01:19:04,178 --> 01:19:06,469
...the loneliness at bay.

1054
01:19:07,825 --> 01:19:10,533
And sometimes,
if you're really lucky

1055
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:16,575
down amongst the sweaty sheets you
find a tiny bit of true human love.

1056
01:19:18,763 --> 01:19:20,429
Did you ever find it?

1057
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:22,409
That tiny bit of love?

1058
01:19:22,513 --> 01:19:23,971
No.

1059
01:19:25,222 --> 01:19:26,992
Not once.

1060
01:19:35,535 --> 01:19:37,826
They say it's easy, Harry.

1061
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:39,806
They say it's like falling...

1062
01:19:39,807 --> 01:19:41,786
No, falling's easy...

1063
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,015
I don't know if I've got
the nerve for this.

1064
01:19:48,557 --> 01:19:50,223
Me neither.

1065
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:08,143
Do you know what it was
made me fall for you?

1066
01:20:10,747 --> 01:20:12,726
I mean really you...

1067
01:20:16,164 --> 01:20:18,247
You looked so fierce.

1068
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:21,685
A fighter.

1069
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:25,540
I never much liked me.

1070
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,810
Well I do.

1071
01:20:47,313 --> 01:20:49,083
It's easy, isn't it?

1072
01:20:49,813 --> 01:20:51,896
Just like falling...

1073
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:15,128
<i>Mr. Houdini never asked</i>

1074
01:21:15,232 --> 01:21:18,044
<i>about the strange words</i>
<i>that came out of me.</i>

1075
01:21:19,191 --> 01:21:21,899
<i>He never asked where</i>
<i>I got them from either.</i>

1076
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,232
<i>He believed in me.</i>

1077
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:56,485
Harry...

1078
01:22:09,404 --> 01:22:11,279
You'll catch your death!

1079
01:22:12,842 --> 01:22:14,925
No. Quite the reverse.

1080
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:02,429
So...

1081
01:23:02,429 --> 01:23:04,720
Off to Montreal, is it?

1082
01:23:05,034 --> 01:23:07,325
Last one. Last time...

1083
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,929
No promises.

1084
01:23:10,764 --> 01:23:12,118
No.

1085
01:23:18,473 --> 01:23:20,660
You saved me, Mrs. McGarvie.

1086
01:23:20,764 --> 01:23:24,514
You saved yourself, Mr. Houdini.

1087
01:23:28,578 --> 01:23:30,557
You saved me too.

1088
01:23:53,893 --> 01:23:55,559
Lost your voice, huh?

1089
01:23:56,914 --> 01:23:58,580
When did you last hear it?

1090
01:24:06,706 --> 01:24:08,789
Take care of your mama for me.

1091
01:24:09,727 --> 01:24:11,810
Hey, I'll see you again.

1092
01:24:11,811 --> 01:24:13,998
Harry...

1093
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,625
Ma'am...

1094
01:25:04,628 --> 01:25:07,024
Angel with fire-red hair!

1095
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:09,524
Clock says noon!
Sun goes black!

1096
01:25:09,524 --> 01:25:12,128
Watch out!
Here he comes!

1097
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,941
Just gave him what he wanted.
It was easy...

1098
01:25:17,338 --> 01:25:19,213
You're goin' soft, you are...

1099
01:25:20,671 --> 01:25:24,942
It's like Mr. Sugarman said -
it's all just showbiz mumbo-jumbo.

1100
01:25:25,463 --> 01:25:28,171
All we've got is
what we can touch and see.

1101
01:25:32,027 --> 01:25:33,902
That's my girl...

1102
01:25:42,861 --> 01:25:44,631
<i>When I was very small,</i>

1103
01:25:45,153 --> 01:25:46,819
<i>I had a gift.</i>

1104
01:25:47,445 --> 01:25:50,674
<i>I saw things</i>
<i>other folk didn't see.</i>

1105
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:54,633
<i>As I grew up,</i>
<i>the gift vanished...</i>

1106
01:25:54,633 --> 01:25:56,820
<i>... just like</i>
<i>my mam said it would.</i>

1107
01:25:59,008 --> 01:26:01,091
<i>But mam was wrong.</i>

1108
01:26:06,613 --> 01:26:08,279
Let 'em get a good look, Morry.

1109
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,842
Mr. Houdini!

1110
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:20,155
Are you going to follow
in your mother's footsteps, Benji?

1111
01:26:20,156 --> 01:26:21,926
Benji! Give us the look!

1112
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:24,010
You know, the psychic look. Yes!

1113
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:27,447
Just got the message direct
from Heaven!

1114
01:26:35,887 --> 01:26:37,970
- Bravo!
- Get back!

1115
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:41,824
Hello, Montreal!!

1116
01:26:43,179 --> 01:26:44,012
Mr. Houdini!

1117
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,199
I'm a student at the College here -
I'm studying Business Management.

1118
01:26:46,304 --> 01:26:47,137
Business management, huh?

1119
01:26:47,346 --> 01:26:49,325
My friend here wants to shake
your hand too, Mr. Houdini.

1120
01:26:49,429 --> 01:26:51,616
Pleased to meet you, Mr. H.
You're a man who can take a punch, right?

1121
01:26:51,721 --> 01:26:52,762
Mr. Houdini
can take any man's punch!

1122
01:26:52,971 --> 01:26:54,846
Get these kids out of here!

1123
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:03,701
Isn't that right, Mr. Houdini?

1124
01:27:03,702 --> 01:27:04,222
What did you say?

1125
01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:06,097
Trick or treat?

1126
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,681
KO'd in the first round!

1127
01:27:15,474 --> 01:27:17,140
<i>Mam, what's wrong?</i>

1128
01:27:26,933 --> 01:27:29,329
Back! Get back! Get back!
Get back!!

1129
01:27:29,329 --> 01:27:31,412
I didn't mean to
hit him so hard!

1130
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:34,329
- Oh, saw that one comin'...
- Someone get a doctor!!

1131
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:36,620
Yes, sir!
Right away, sir!

1132
01:27:36,934 --> 01:27:39,225
You're going to be OK, Harry.
You'll be fine.

1133
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:40,579
I don't know, Morry...

1134
01:27:40,684 --> 01:27:43,392
Won't somebody call
a bloody doctor?!

1135
01:27:43,393 --> 01:27:44,955
This time I keep falling...

1136
01:27:44,955 --> 01:27:46,830
You're going to be fine, Harry...

1137
01:27:47,977 --> 01:27:49,643
Oh, God forgive me...

1138
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:51,934
I told them, Harry...

1139
01:27:52,456 --> 01:27:54,435
...that stuff about your mother.

1140
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:55,997
I told them.

1141
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,581
I know. I know you did,
Mr. Sugarman...

1142
01:28:02,353 --> 01:28:04,228
Catch me...

1143
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:07,155
<i>The Great Houdini</i>
<i>changed our lives...</i>

1144
01:30:07,677 --> 01:30:09,864
<i>... and for a wee short while,</i>

1145
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:12,365
<i>we taught him how to love.</i>

1146
01:30:13,927 --> 01:30:15,489
<i>And me and mam...</i>

1147
01:30:16,532 --> 01:30:18,407
<i>We had the here and now...</i>

1148
01:30:19,866 --> 01:30:21,636
<i>And we had each other.</i>

1147
01:30:28,876 --> 01:30:32,665
<i>Harry Houdini died of complications
from a ruptured appendice.</i>

1148
01:30:32,666 --> 01:30:39,832
<i>His last wish was a spiritist sance
on his death anniversary.</i>

1150
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:45,823
<i>It has been said, 
"If it is possible for anyone</i>

1151
01:30:46,724 --> 01:30:51,206
<i>to come back from the other side,
only Harry Houdini will.</i>
